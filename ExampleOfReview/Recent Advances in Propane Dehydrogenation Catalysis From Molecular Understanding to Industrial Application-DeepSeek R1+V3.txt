1. Introduction - What is the role of propylene in the chemical industry and why is propane dehydrogenation important?

Propylene is a cornerstone of the chemical industry, serving as a critical feedstock for the production of a wide array of chemicals and materials. Its applications span the manufacture of polypropylene, acrylonitrile, propylene oxide, and cymene, among others, making it indispensable in sectors ranging from plastics to pharmaceuticals [10.1002/advs.202207756]. The global demand for propylene has been steadily increasing, with production capacity reaching approximately 130 megatons in 2019 and projected to escalate to 191 megatons by 2030, highlighting a significant supply-demand gap [10.1002/advs.202207756]. Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) has emerged as a vital process to address this gap, currently accounting for 10% of global propylene production [10.1002/advs.202207756].

PDH is particularly advantageous as it offers an economical and environmentally friendly alternative to traditional methods such as thermal or catalytic cracking of naphtha, which are energy-intensive and generate substantial CO₂ emissions [10.1002/anie.201507119]. The process leverages the abundance of propane, particularly from shale gas, which has become a cost-effective feedstock due to the shale gas revolution [10.1002/anie.201508731]. This shift has made PDH a commercially attractive route for on-purpose propylene production, especially as traditional methods like steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) are increasingly unable to meet the growing demand [10.1002/anie.201800123].

The importance of propylene extends beyond its role as a chemical intermediate. It is a key building block for polymers, solvents, dyes, resins, fibers, and drugs, underscoring its versatility and economic value [10.1002/anie.202005968]. The rising demand for propylene derivatives, such as polypropylene used in non-woven fabrics for personal protective equipment during the COVID-19 pandemic, further emphasizes its critical role in modern industry [10.1016/j.apcatb.2021.120731]. As the chemical industry continues to evolve, PDH is poised to play an increasingly significant role in bridging the supply-demand gap, driven by advancements in catalytic technologies and the availability of cost-effective propane feedstocks [10.1016/j.apcatb.2020.119089].

※※※
Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: The growing demand for propylene, coupled with the limitations of traditional production methods, underscores the need for innovative approaches to propylene production. Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) has emerged as a key technology in this regard, offering a sustainable and economically viable alternative. Future research should focus on developing more efficient and selective catalysts to enhance PDH performance, reduce energy consumption, and minimize environmental impact. Additionally, exploring alternative feedstocks and integrating PDH with other industrial processes could further optimize propylene production. The continued evolution of PDH technologies, driven by advancements in catalysis and process engineering, will be crucial in meeting the escalating global demand for propylene and ensuring the sustainability of the chemical industry.

2. Introduction - How do catalysts enable propane dehydrogenation through lowering activation barriers?

Catalysts play a pivotal role in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) by lowering the activation energy barriers required for the reaction to proceed. This is achieved through various mechanisms that facilitate the breaking of C-H bonds in propane, which is the rate-determining step in the process. One of the primary mechanisms involves the use of coordinatively unsaturated metal sites, such as Cr³⁺ in CrOx/Al2O3 catalysts, which act as active sites for PDH by enabling heterolytic C-H dissociation [10.1002/advs.202207756]. Similarly, Pt-based catalysts employ the Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism, where the first C-H bond cleavage is considered the rate-determining step, and the presence of Sn promoters enhances the catalyst's selectivity and stability by modifying the electronic structure of Pt [10.1002/advs.202207756].
Ga-based catalysts, on the other hand, utilize both carbenium and alkyl mechanisms. In the carbenium mechanism, propane is initially activated on Brønsted acid sites (BAS) to form a carbenium ion, while Ga facilitates the recombination of hydrogen atoms on the catalyst surface to form H₂, thereby increasing the reaction rate. The alkyl mechanism involves direct activation of propane by Ga species, forming Ga-C₃H₇ intermediates, followed by β-H elimination to produce propylene and Ga-H species [10.1002/advs.202207756].
In addition to these mechanisms, the role of Lewis acid-base pairs is highlighted in Ga/ZSM-5 catalysts, where Ga⁺ ions and zeolite-framework basic oxygen anions (Ga⁺-Z-O⁻) activate C-H bonds. The formation of binuclear Ga³⁺ complexes further lowers the activation energy barriers for H₂ recombination compared to mononuclear GaO⁺ ions, as demonstrated by DFT calculations [10.1002/anie.200702463]. Similarly, coordinatively unsaturated Zr⁴⁺ cations (Zrcus) near anion vacancies in ZrO₂-based catalysts facilitate C-H bond activation and β-hydrogen elimination, with activation energies around 170 kJ/mol [10.1002/anie.201508731].
The use of oxygen defects in MnWO₄ nanorods and the geometric separation of MnOx chains by W₂O₈ units also enhance catalytic activity and selectivity by enabling reversible replenishment and depletion of oxygen defects, which suppress overoxidation to CO/CO₂ [10.1002/anie.201510201]. Furthermore, vanadium-based catalysts, such as V₂O₃, exhibit low dehydrogenation barriers (1.12 eV) due to the presence of hydroxyl groups that block exposed V³⁺ sites, thereby reducing coke formation [10.1002/anie.201800123].

※※※
Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: The advancements in propane dehydrogenation catalysts underscore the importance of tailoring active sites to lower activation energy barriers and enhance selectivity. Future research could focus on the development of novel catalyst architectures, such as single-atom catalysts (SACs) and bimetallic alloys, which offer precise control over active site geometry and electronic properties. Additionally, the integration of computational modeling, such as DFT, with experimental studies can provide deeper insights into the mechanistic pathways and transition states involved in PDH. Exploring the use of renewable energy sources, such as electric fields or light, to drive PDH reactions could also open new avenues for sustainable propylene production. Furthermore, the design of catalysts with enhanced resistance to coking and sintering will be crucial for improving the longevity and efficiency of PDH processes.

3. Introduction - What are the major classes of catalysts studied for propane dehydrogenation?

        Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) has been extensively studied, with several major classes of catalysts explored to enhance propylene production. The primary catalyst classes include metal oxides, supported metals, alloys, and zeolites. Metal oxides such as CrOx/Al2O3 and VOx/Al2O3 are widely used in industrial processes like the Catofin and Oleflex processes, respectively [10.1002/advs.202207756]. Supported metals, particularly Pt-based catalysts, are prominent due to their high activity and selectivity. For instance, PtSn/Al2O3 is a key catalyst in the Oleflex process, where Sn acts as a promoter to reduce coke formation and improve stability [10.1016/j.jcat.2020.03.037]. Alloy catalysts, such as PtGa and PtZn, have also shown enhanced performance due to their unique electronic and structural properties [10.1021/acscatal.1c00331]. Zeolite-based catalysts, including Ga/H-ZSM-5 and Zn/H-ZSM-5, are notable for their high selectivity and stability in PDH reactions [10.1016/j.jcat.2019.11.026]. Specific examples include Ga2O22+ sites in H-ZSM-5, which exhibit a turnover frequency (TOF) at least one order of magnitude higher than other Ga-based catalysts [10.1002/anie.200702463]. Additionally, nanocarbon materials have emerged as promising metal-free catalysts, offering high selectivity and stability [10.1016/S1872-2067(19)63360-7].

※※※
        Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: The advancements in propane dehydrogenation catalysts highlight the importance of optimizing catalyst design to balance activity, selectivity, and stability. Future research should focus on developing non-toxic, cost-effective alternatives to traditional Pt- and Cr-based systems. Emerging materials such as single-atom catalysts (SACs), high-entropy intermetallics (HEIs), and boron-based systems offer promising avenues for innovation. Additionally, the integration of advanced characterization techniques and computational modeling can provide deeper insights into catalyst mechanisms, enabling the rational design of next-generation PDH catalysts. Exploring synergistic effects between different catalyst classes, such as combining metal oxides with zeolites or nanocarbons, could further enhance catalytic performance and sustainability.

4. Theoretical Principles and Computational Approaches - What are the thermodynamic limitations and kinetic considerations in propane dehydrogenation?

        Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is a thermodynamically constrained and kinetically complex process, primarily due to its highly endothermic nature (ΔH = 124.3 kJ/mol) and equilibrium limitations. The reaction is favored at high temperatures (550–700°C) and low pressures, as these conditions shift the equilibrium toward propylene production. However, elevated temperatures also accelerate undesirable side reactions such as cracking, coking, and sintering, which lead to rapid catalyst deactivation. Kinetic factors include turnover frequencies (TOF), which vary significantly depending on catalyst composition, support, and preparation methods. For instance, Pt-based catalysts exhibit TOF values ranging from 4.6 to 12,600 h⁻¹, while CrOx/Al2O3 shows a lower TOF of 20.4 h⁻¹ [10.1002/advs.202207756].  

        The rate-determining step (RDS) in PDH often shifts between C-H bond cleavage and H₂ desorption, depending on the catalyst and reaction conditions. For example, DFT calculations reveal that the activation energy for H₂ recombination on mononuclear GaO⁺ species is prohibitively high (305 kJ/mol), whereas binuclear Ga clusters exhibit lower barriers (147–211 kJ/mol) [10.1002/anie.200702463]. Additionally, the introduction of steam or CO₂ can enhance kinetic stability by reducing coke formation and shifting equilibrium via the reverse water-gas shift reaction (RWGS) [10.1016/j.jcat.2005.03.001].  

        Thermodynamic equilibrium conversions are typically low at moderate temperatures (e.g., 0.5% at 300°C), but electroassisted PDH can achieve yields far beyond these limits (e.g., 19.3% at 300°C) [10.1002/anie.202300744]. Oxidative dehydrogenation (ODHP) avoids thermodynamic constraints by being exothermic and operates at lower temperatures, with activation energies ranging from 62.59 to 150.68 kJ/mol depending on the catalyst [10.1002/anie.202307470].  

        ※※※  
        Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: The thermodynamic and kinetic challenges of PDH necessitate innovative catalyst designs and process optimizations. Future research could focus on developing catalysts with enhanced resistance to coking and sintering, such as single-atom catalysts (SACs) or bimetallic systems. Additionally, integrating electroassisted or oxidative dehydrogenation methods could overcome equilibrium limitations and improve energy efficiency. Computational approaches, including DFT and microkinetic modeling, will play a crucial role in identifying optimal catalyst structures and reaction pathways. Emerging technologies, such as chemical looping and tandem catalysis, offer promising avenues for achieving higher propylene yields while minimizing energy consumption and environmental impact.

5. Theoretical Principles and Computational Approaches - How are DFT calculations used to explore reaction mechanisms and pathways?

        Density functional theory (DFT) calculations have been extensively applied to study the mechanisms and pathways of propane dehydrogenation (PDH), providing critical insights into the structural stability of active sites, reaction energetics, and catalytic performance. For instance, DFT studies on Ga-based catalysts revealed significant differences in the stability and reactivity of Ga+ and Ga2O22+ species. Specifically, Ga2O22+ species exhibited lower activation energy for H2 recombination (147 kJ/mol) compared to isolated [HGa3+OH]+ sites (242 kJ/mol), highlighting the role of hydrogen bonding in stabilizing intermediates [10.1002/advs.202207756]. Similarly, DFT calculations on hydroxylated binuclear Ga complexes (e.g., Ga₂O₂ core structures) quantified reaction and activation energies for H₂/H₂O desorption, with computed Ga-Ga distances (2.98 Å) matching EXAFS data, further validating the computational models [10.1002/anie.200702463].

        In the context of VOx catalysts, DFT simulations demonstrated that V2O3 structures exhibit lower dehydrogenation barriers (1.12 eV) compared to V2O5H2 (1.98 eV), while hydroxyl groups increase barriers and block V³⁺ sites, reducing coke formation [10.1002/anie.201800123]. Additionally, DFT studies on Pt-based catalysts revealed that increasing Sn content in Pt-Sn alloys reduces the binding strength of the 1-propyl intermediate, thereby inhibiting deep dehydrogenation and coke formation [10.1016/j.jcat.2018.09.006]. These findings underscore the importance of electronic and geometric effects in modulating catalytic activity and selectivity.

        DFT calculations have also been instrumental in elucidating the role of oxygen vacancies and surface defects in PDH. For example, studies on ZrO₂-based catalysts identified two neighboring coordinatively unsaturated Zr cations (Zrcus) as active sites, with monoclinic ZrO₂ showing lower methylene C-H activation barriers (0.16 eV) compared to tetragonal ZrO₂ (0.42–0.61 eV) [10.1016/j.jcat.2019.02.012]. Furthermore, DFT simulations on PtZn intermetallic alloys revealed that isolated Pt atoms within [PtZn4] ensembles facilitate initial C-H activation but block over-dehydrogenation, explaining high selectivity and coke resistance [10.1016/j.chempr.2020.10.008].

        The integration of DFT with experimental techniques has further enhanced the understanding of PDH mechanisms. For instance, DFT calculations on β-Ga2O3 surfaces identified tricoordinated GaIII sites adjacent to oxygen vacancies as weak Lewis acid sites, with computational models correlating Ga-H bond lengths to IR vibration frequencies [10.1016/j.jcat.2022.02.025]. Similarly, DFT studies on PtMn alloys revealed energy barriers for propane C-H activation and propene desorption, with PtMn alloys showing an optimal balance between activation and desorption, explaining catalytic performance differences [10.1016/j.jcat.2020.06.016].

        ※※※  
        Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: The advancements in DFT calculations have significantly deepened the mechanistic understanding of propane dehydrogenation, particularly in elucidating the roles of active sites, surface defects, and alloying effects. Future research could focus on integrating machine learning with DFT to accelerate catalyst discovery and optimization. Additionally, exploring the dynamic behavior of catalysts under operando conditions using ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) could provide further insights into reaction pathways and catalyst stability. The development of multi-scale models combining DFT with microkinetic simulations may also enable the design of more efficient and selective PDH catalysts.

6. Theoretical Principles and Computational Approaches - What microkinetic models have provided insights into dehydrogenation kinetics?

Microkinetic modeling has emerged as a pivotal tool in understanding the complex kinetics of propane dehydrogenation (PDH), offering insights into reaction mechanisms, rate-determining steps, and catalyst performance. Several studies have employed microkinetic models to elucidate the kinetics of PDH, often integrating experimental data with computational approaches. For instance, a study by [10.1002/advs.202207756] utilized microkinetic modeling to analyze reaction orders, revealing negative H₂ orders in both dehydrogenation and cracking reactions. The model also highlighted the independence of the dehydrogenation-to-cracking (D/C) ratio from reactant pressures, providing a nuanced understanding of the reaction dynamics. Additionally, the study discussed rate equations normalized to Ga/Al ratios, incorporating parameters such as turnover frequency (TOFGa) and competitive adsorption terms, though explicit models were not detailed.

Another significant contribution comes from [10.1016/j.cej.2004.03.006], where Langmuir-type and Mars-van Krevelen rate equations were employed in microkinetic modeling. The study tabulated parameters like rate constants (k₁, k₂) and adsorption equilibrium constants (K), offering a comprehensive framework for understanding propane consumption and reoxidation kinetics. Similarly, [10.1016/j.jcat.2020.03.037] employed kinetic Monte Carlo (kMC) simulations to model 59 elementary steps, incorporating lateral interactions and coverage-dependent Gibbs free energy barriers. The model quantified turnover frequencies (TOFs), selectivity, and deactivation rates, with key parameters including a 1.37 eV apparent activation barrier for propane dehydrogenation.

Further advancements in microkinetic modeling are evident in [10.1021/acscatal.0c03381], where a model incorporating adsorbate interactions and coverage-dependent barriers reproduced experimental TOF trends. The study used transition state theory-based rate equations, showing that optimal H₂/C₃H₈ ratios maximize propylene yield by balancing site availability. Similarly, [10.1021/acscatal.1c04844] employed Bayesian model selection and harmonic transition state theory to derive rate equations, validating them against experimental TOFs and activation energies. These studies underscore the importance of microkinetic modeling in bridging theoretical predictions with experimental observations.

Moreover, [10.1038/s41929-021-00730-x] developed a Langmuir-Hinshelwood microkinetic model, identifying CO₂ activation as the rate-determining step in CO₂-assisted PDH. The study derived rate equations and parameters, including reaction orders and activation energies, with simulations matching experimental trends. This approach highlights the potential of microkinetic modeling in optimizing catalyst design and operational conditions for PDH.

※※※
Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: The advancements in microkinetic modeling for propane dehydrogenation have significantly enhanced our understanding of reaction kinetics and catalyst performance. However, challenges remain in fully capturing the complexity of real-world catalytic systems, particularly in accounting for dynamic site blocking, coke formation, and transient reaction conditions. Future research should focus on integrating machine learning and advanced computational techniques to refine microkinetic models, enabling more accurate predictions of catalyst behavior under industrial conditions. Additionally, exploring the interplay between catalyst structure and kinetics through operando characterization techniques could provide deeper insights into active site dynamics and reaction pathways. By addressing these challenges, microkinetic modeling can continue to drive innovation in catalyst design and process optimization for propane dehydrogenation.

7. Theoretical Principles and Computational Approaches - How have descriptors been identified correlating catalyst properties to performance?

        Theoretical Principles and Computational Approaches - How have descriptors been identified correlating catalyst properties to performance?  

        The identification of descriptors linking catalyst properties to propane dehydrogenation (PDH) performance has been a focal point in both computational and experimental studies. Key descriptors include the speciation of active sites, support interactions, and electronic/geometric effects. For instance, Ga₂O₂²⁺ sites in H-ZSM-5 exhibit a turnover frequency (TOF) of >2,120 h⁻¹, significantly higher than other Ga-based catalysts, due to the local coordination environment provided by the zeolite support [10.1002/advs.202207756]. Similarly, binuclear Ga₂O₂ structures, identified via EXAFS, show lower H₂ recombination energy, correlating with higher activity compared to mononuclear Ga species [10.1002/anie.200702463].  

        Support effects are also critical, as demonstrated by the role of framework Al pair density in determining the concentration of active Ga species in PDH [10.1002/advs.202207756]. Computational studies have further revealed that the p-band center of oxygen and the unoccupied d-band center of metals are crucial descriptors, with electron transfer from oxygen's p-band to metal d-bands influencing activity [10.1002/anie.202206758]. Additionally, the hydrogen affinity (EH) and adsorption energy of intermediates, such as propylene, have been identified as universal descriptors, with linear scaling relationships established between these parameters and catalytic performance [10.1016/j.chempr.2020.10.008].  

        Structure-activity relationships often emphasize the importance of site isolation and electronic modifications. For example, isolated Pt1 sites, geometrically isolated by Pb and electronically enriched by Ca, exhibit reduced coking and enhanced selectivity [10.1002/anie.202107210]. Similarly, the distance between adjacent Pt atoms in Pt2In3 alloys (3.25 Å) induces weak π-adsorption of propylene, facilitating desorption and inhibiting side reactions [10.1016/j.jechem.2023.04.019].  

※※※  
        Integrative understanding and prospective outlook:  
        The advancements in identifying descriptors for PDH catalysts highlight the interplay between structural, electronic, and support properties in determining catalytic performance. Future research should focus on leveraging machine learning and high-throughput computational screening to accelerate the discovery of novel descriptors and optimize catalyst design. Additionally, exploring the role of dynamic structural changes under reaction conditions and the integration of multi-functional supports could further enhance catalyst stability and selectivity. Emerging fields such as single-atom catalysis and the use of advanced characterization techniques (e.g., in situ spectroscopy and operando studies) offer promising avenues for deeper insights into structure-activity relationships.

8. Metal Oxide Catalysts - What metal oxides like Cr2O3, Ga2O3 have shown promising propane dehydrogenation activity?

        The study of metal oxide catalysts for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) has revealed significant advancements, particularly with chromium oxide (Cr₂O₃) and gallium oxide (Ga₂O₃) systems. Cr₂O₃-based catalysts, such as those used in the Catofin process, demonstrate high propane conversion rates (45–50%) and selectivity (85–90%) but are limited by environmental concerns due to Cr(VI) toxicity and shorter lifespans (1–2 years) [10.1021/acscatal.2c01374]. Despite these drawbacks, Cr₂O₃ remains a cornerstone of industrial PDH due to its cost-effectiveness and high activity. Recent innovations, such as CrZrOx/SiO₂ catalysts, have shown improved performance, with Cr30Zr70/SiO₂ achieving a space-time yield three times higher than traditional K-CrOx/Al₂O₃ [10.1021/acscatal.9b05063].

        Ga₂O₃-based catalysts have emerged as promising alternatives, offering high propylene selectivity and stability. For instance, Ga-CHA zeolites achieve 96% propylene selectivity, while Ga/H-ZSM-5 maintains 90% selectivity with high stability [10.1021/jacs.2c03941]. Trace-Pt-promoted Ga₂O₃/Al₂O₃ catalysts have demonstrated remarkable activity and stability, with propane conversion rates of 12% and 99% selectivity [10.1021/acscatal.0c05454]. Furthermore, Ir1Ga₂O₃ outperforms Pt-promoted Ga₂O₃, highlighting the potential of Ga₂O₃-based systems as environmentally friendly and efficient PDH catalysts [10.1021/acscatal.0c05454].

        ※※※
        Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: The advancements in Cr₂O₃ and Ga₂O₃ catalysts underscore their potential to address the limitations of traditional Pt-based systems, such as high cost and environmental concerns. Future research should focus on optimizing the stability and regeneration of Cr₂O₃ catalysts while mitigating their environmental impact. For Ga₂O₃ systems, exploring novel promoters and support materials could further enhance their activity and selectivity. Additionally, the integration of computational modeling and advanced characterization techniques could accelerate the discovery of next-generation metal oxide catalysts for PDH, paving the way for more sustainable and efficient propylene production processes.

9. Metal Oxide Catalysts - How does controlling oxidation state, oxygen mobility and acid-base sites modulate catalyst performance?

        Metal oxide catalysts play a pivotal role in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) by modulating oxidation states, oxygen mobility, and acid-base properties, which directly influence catalytic performance. The oxidation state of metal centers, such as V³⁺ in vanadium oxides, has been shown to significantly enhance PDH activity, as evidenced by TOF correlations and H₂-TPR experiments [10.1021/acscatal.6b00893]. Similarly, the presence of coordinatively unsaturated tetrahedral Ni(II) sites promotes propylene desorption, thereby inhibiting coking and side reactions [10.1021/acscatal.2c03240].  

        Oxygen mobility, particularly in redox-active supports like CeO₂, facilitates Mars-van Krevelen (MvK) mechanisms, where lattice oxygen participates in H abstraction and coke combustion. This is further enhanced by the basicity and oxygen-releasing ability of CeO₂, which stabilizes the catalyst and reduces energy barriers for CO₂ activation [10.1038/s41929-021-00730-x]. Additionally, CrOx-doped ZrO₂ systems demonstrate improved reducibility and lower activation barriers for C–H bond cleavage, attributed to hydrogen spillover and the generation of oxygen vacancies [10.1021/acscatal.9b05063].  

        Acid-base properties also play a critical role in PDH catalysis. Lewis acid-base interactions at metal oxide (MO) sites enhance the coadsorption of amphoteric species, modifying chemisorption energy scaling and transition state energies. For instance, electron-deficient O ions, resulting from charge redistribution around doped metal atoms (e.g., Ir), exhibit enhanced reactivity, as indicated by linear correlations between O p-band centers and H adsorption energies [10.1021/acscatal.0c05454]. Furthermore, phosphorus modification of vanadium catalysts stabilizes lower valence vanadium (V⁴⁺) and creates isolated vanadium species, which inhibit intermediate polymerization and enhance propylene desorption [10.1016/j.apcatb.2020.119089].  

        ※※※  
        Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: The intricate interplay between oxidation states, oxygen mobility, and acid-base properties in metal oxide catalysts offers a rich landscape for optimizing PDH performance. Future research could explore the synergistic effects of multi-metal oxide systems, where the combination of redox-active and acid-base functionalities could further lower activation barriers and enhance selectivity. Advanced characterization techniques, such as in situ spectroscopy and operando studies, could provide deeper insights into the dynamic behavior of active sites under reaction conditions. Additionally, computational modeling, particularly DFT, can guide the rational design of catalysts by predicting the effects of dopants and support interactions on electronic and geometric properties. Emerging fields such as single-atom catalysis and the integration of CO₂ utilization in PDH processes also present promising avenues for sustainable and efficient propane dehydrogenation.

10. Metal Oxide Catalysts - What are the proposed mechanistic scenarios over different metal oxide catalysts?

The mechanistic scenarios for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) over metal oxide catalysts have been extensively studied, with a focus on understanding the reaction steps, intermediates, and active sites. Among the most prominent catalysts are Pt-Sn bimetallic clusters supported on γ-Al₂O₃ nanosheets, where raft-like Pt-Sn clusters with a mean diameter of 1.3 nm are stabilized by pentacoordinate Al³⁺ sites [10.1002/anie.201507119]. These clusters exhibit high activity and selectivity, attributed to the synergistic interaction between Pt and Sn, which modulates the electronic properties of Pt and reduces coke formation.  

Another significant class of catalysts includes Cr-based systems, such as Cr₂O₃/Al₂O₃, which are employed in the Catofin process. These catalysts feature isolated Cr³⁺ sites and amorphous CrOx clusters, with redox dynamics between Cr(III) and Cr(VI) playing a critical role in the reaction mechanism [10.1016/j.jcat.2020.03.037]. The addition of promoters like ZrO₂ and NiO further enhances the catalytic performance by improving dispersion and stability [10.1021/acscatal.9b05063].  

Vanadium oxide (VOx/Al₂O₃) catalysts have also been widely investigated, with the reaction mechanism following a Mars-van Krevelen (MvK) redox pathway. Isolated VOx species, polyvanadates, and V₂O₅ nanoparticles are identified as active sites, with their activity and selectivity dependent on vanadium density and support interactions [10.1021/acscatal.6b00893].  

Ga-based catalysts, particularly Ga/ZSM-5, have shown promise due to the presence of Ga⁺ and GaO⁺ species at zeolite exchange sites. These catalysts exhibit high propane turnover frequency and selectivity, with Ga⁺ ions being more active than GaO⁺ species [10.1016/j.jcat.2006.03.004]. Additionally, PtGa alloy nanoparticles, such as those in Ga37Pt/Al₂O₃ SCALMS, demonstrate exceptional selectivity (>99%) and productivity, with isolated Pt atoms in a liquid Ga matrix preventing coke formation [10.1021/acscatal.8b04578].  

Phosphorus-doped Fe/P/Al catalysts represent another innovative approach, where phosphorus doping promotes the formation of Fe₃C active sites, enhancing selectivity and stability [10.1016/j.apcatb.2020.119089]. Similarly, PtZn intermetallic alloys (IMAs) and Pt/Cu single-atom alloys (SAAs) have been explored, with [PtZn₄] ensembles and Pt/Cu SAAs showing superior performance due to their unique electronic and geometric properties [10.1016/j.chempr.2020.10.008].  

※※※  
Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: The mechanistic insights into propane dehydrogenation over metal oxide catalysts highlight the importance of tailored active sites, promoter effects, and support interactions in enhancing catalytic performance. Future research should focus on the development of advanced characterization techniques to elucidate the dynamic nature of active sites under reaction conditions. Additionally, the exploration of novel catalyst architectures, such as single-atom alloys and confined bimetallic clusters, offers exciting opportunities for achieving unprecedented selectivity and stability. The integration of computational modeling and machine learning could further accelerate the discovery of next-generation PDH catalysts, paving the way for more sustainable and efficient industrial processes.

11. Metal Oxide Catalysts - How does the metal-support interplay affect dehydrogenation activity and selectivity?

        The interplay between metal and support in metal oxide catalysts plays a pivotal role in modulating the activity and selectivity of propane dehydrogenation (PDH). The metal-support interface influences both thermodynamic and kinetic aspects of the reaction, including activation barriers, coke formation, and propylene desorption. For instance, PtZn/SiO2 catalysts exhibit enhanced selectivity (96%) and conversion (42%) at 600°C, attributed to the weak propylene adsorption (ΔEads = -0.7 eV) on PtZn sites, which suppresses coke formation compared to Pt clusters (ΔEads = -1.5 eV) [10.1016/j.chempr.2020.10.008]. Similarly, Cr-doped ZrO2 catalysts demonstrate improved reducibility and activity due to lower oxygen vacancy formation energy (7.49 eV vs. 10.76 eV for pure ZrO2), with smaller ZrO2 crystallites further enhancing H2 consumption and reaction rates [10.1021/acscatal.9b05063].  

Kinetic studies reveal that the first C-H cleavage is often the rate-determining step, with activation barriers ranging from 0.75 eV to 1.37 eV depending on the catalyst composition [10.1016/j.chempr.2023.07.002] [10.1016/j.jcat.2020.03.037]. The metal-support interface also affects mass transfer and diffusion limitations, as evidenced by the Weisz-Prater parameter (1.34 for larger supports) and the quadratic relationship between support size and propane conversion [10.1016/j.jcat.2017.05.024]. Furthermore, the stability of active sites, such as GaO+ in Ga-based catalysts, is influenced by regeneration barriers (≈1.5 eV), which can lead to deactivation over time [10.1016/j.jcat.2006.03.004].  

Thermodynamic constraints, such as equilibrium limitations and coke formation, are mitigated through strategic catalyst design. For example, CO2 suppresses coking via Fe(0) oxidation in PtFe alloys, maintaining high activity (47.1% conversion) despite coke accumulation (up to 18.8 wt%) [10.1021/acscatal.2c00649]. Additionally, the endothermic nature of PDH (≈600°C) necessitates high reaction temperatures, which can be optimized by tailoring the metal-support interaction to enhance thermal stability and reduce energy barriers [10.1021/acscatal.9b05548].  

※※※  
Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: The insights gleaned from the metal-support interplay in metal oxide catalysts underscore the importance of tailored catalyst design to optimize PDH performance. Future research could explore advanced characterization techniques, such as in situ spectroscopy and operando studies, to elucidate the dynamic changes at the metal-support interface under reaction conditions. Additionally, the development of novel support materials, such as two-dimensional nanostructures or hierarchical frameworks, could further enhance mass transfer and reduce diffusion limitations. Computational modeling, particularly density functional theory (DFT) and microkinetic analysis, will remain indispensable for predicting catalyst behavior and guiding experimental efforts. Emerging strategies, such as single-atom catalysts and bimetallic alloys, offer promising avenues for achieving superior activity, selectivity, and stability in PDH processes.

12. Supported Metal Catalysts - What single metals like Pt, Pd, Ir have been explored for propane dehydrogenation?

        Supported metal catalysts, particularly single metals like Pt, Pd, and Ir, have been extensively explored for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) due to their high activity and selectivity. Platinum (Pt) is the most widely studied, with computational insights from density functional theory (DFT) revealing key mechanistic details. For instance, DFT studies on PtZn clusters demonstrate that [PtZn4] ensembles lower propylene adsorption energy (-0.7 eV vs. -1.5 eV on Pt3), favoring desorption and enhancing selectivity [10.1016/j.chempr.2020.10.008]. Additionally, Pt3Sn-SnOx interfaces have been identified as active sites, with preferential C-H bond cleavage (0.75 eV activation energy) over C-C scission (2.21 eV), as confirmed by DFT calculations [10.1016/j.chempr.2023.07.002].  

        Palladium (Pd) and Iridium (Ir) have also been investigated, albeit to a lesser extent. DFT calculations on Ir@Ga(o) sites reveal a 157x higher turnover frequency (TOF) compared to adsorbed Ir clusters, attributed to strong interactions preventing aggregation [10.1021/acscatal.0c05454]. While Pd-based catalysts are less frequently discussed in the context of PDH, their potential lies in their ability to modulate adsorption/desorption properties through alloying, as seen in PtFe systems where alloying-induced electronic changes weaken propylene adsorption [10.1021/acscatal.2c00649].  

        Mechanistic insights from DFT have been pivotal in understanding the role of single metals in PDH. For example, Pt-Sn surfaces exhibit reduced hydrocarbon adsorption, while Pt1 sites are associated with side reactions, and Pt2 sites (Pt-SnOx interfaces) are identified as the main active sites for dehydrogenation [10.1016/j.fuproc.2009.07.019]. Furthermore, DFT studies on Pt(111) and Pt(211) facets reveal facet-dependent mechanisms, with Sn altering transition-state barriers and binding strengths [10.1021/acscatal.3c00939].  

        ※※※  
        Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: The exploration of single-metal catalysts for PDH has been significantly advanced by DFT calculations, which provide detailed mechanistic insights and guide catalyst design. Future research could focus on optimizing alloy compositions to further enhance selectivity and stability, as well as exploring less-studied metals like Pd and Ir for their unique electronic properties. Additionally, integrating experimental techniques with computational modeling will be crucial for validating and refining these insights, paving the way for more efficient and sustainable PDH processes.

13. Supported Metal Catalysts - How do metal particle size, shape, support effects influence activity and stability?

        Supported metal catalysts play a pivotal role in propane dehydrogenation (PDH), with their performance heavily influenced by metal particle size, shape, and support interactions. The study of Pt-based catalysts, for instance, reveals that Pt dispersion and particle size significantly impact turnover frequency (TOF). For PtZn4 structures, TOF correlates with Pt dispersion ranging from 88.3% to 36.1% and particle sizes between 0.9 and 2.2 nm, while maintaining invariant selectivity due to preserved [PtZn4] active sites [10.1016/j.chempr.2020.10.008]. Similarly, PtFe alloys demonstrate enhanced stability with particle sizes of 9-10 nm, while Fe/S-1 catalysts exhibit poor initial activity (0.8% conversion) and high coke deposition (18.8 wt%) [10.1021/acscatal.2c00649].  

        The shape of metal particles also influences catalytic behavior. For example, isolated Pt sites on Al₂O₃, identified via DRIFTS, exhibit CO adsorption shifts (2050–2000 cm⁻¹) and achieve >95% selectivity at 450°C [10.1021/acscatal.8b04578]. Furthermore, the interaction between metal particles and supports is critical. Ga+ species in Ga-CHA require higher reduction temperatures due to smaller pore sizes, highlighting the role of support geometry in modulating active site accessibility [10.1021/jacs.2c03941].  

        Support effects are further exemplified by the bifunctional mechanism in Pt-Sn-Na catalysts, where metal-acid site collaboration yields 30.4% propene and deactivation rates over 45 hours [10.1016/j.fuproc.2009.07.019]. Additionally, Zrcus site density in Cr-Zr catalysts directly correlates with PDH activity, with propene formation rates increasing with the Cr/(Cr+Zr) ratio [10.1021/acscatal.9b05063].  

        ※※※  
        Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: The interplay between metal particle size, shape, and support interactions underscores the complexity of designing efficient PDH catalysts. Future research could explore advanced characterization techniques, such as operando spectroscopy, to elucidate dynamic structural changes during catalysis. Additionally, the development of novel support materials with tailored pore architectures and surface properties may further enhance catalyst stability and selectivity. Computational modeling, particularly density functional theory (DFT), could provide deeper insights into the energetics of active sites and reaction pathways, guiding the rational design of next-generation PDH catalysts.

14. Supported Metal Catalysts - What are the mechanistic pathways proposed over supported metal catalysts?

        The mechanistic pathways for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) over supported metal catalysts have been extensively studied, with key insights derived from the electronic, geometric, and structural properties of the catalysts. For Pt-based catalysts, smaller Pt particles (0.9–2.2 nm) inhibit coke formation due to their high dispersion and electron density, which weaken hydrocarbon adsorption [10.1002/anie.201507119]. The role of Sn as a promoter is critical, with Sn/Pt atomic ratios >1.5 required for full Pt alloying, leading to uniformly dispersed 2 nm nanoparticles and low-coordinated Pt sites that enhance selectivity [10.1016/j.chempr.2023.07.002]. Additionally, pentacoordinate Al³⁺ sites anchor Pt atoms, stabilizing clusters and improving catalytic performance [10.1002/anie.201507119].  

        Phosphorus modification of vanadium-based catalysts has been shown to tune surface acidity and weaken the interaction between vanadium species, reducing coking and enhancing stability [10.1016/j.apcatb.2020.119089]. Isolated vanadium species, facilitated by phosphorus insertion, exhibit higher activity and reduced oligomerization, while higher electron density repels intermediates, further improving selectivity [10.1016/j.apcatb.2020.119089].  

        For Ga-based catalysts, Ga⁺ species are more active than GaO⁺, with the latter favoring C-H bond activation but exhibiting lower stability due to weaker zeolite interactions [10.1016/j.jcat.2006.03.004]. Isolated Pt atoms in PtGa alloys, particularly in PtGa@SiO₂, provide an ideal configuration for C-H bond activation, preventing coke formation and enhancing selectivity [10.1021/acs.accounts.9b00138].  

        In Cr-based systems, the Cr/(Cr+Zr) ratio correlates with acidic site density, while smaller ZrO₂ crystallites enhance reducibility and Zrcus sites, maximizing intrinsic activity [10.1021/acscatal.9b05063]. Oxygen mobility, linked to Tamman temperature and DFT-based oxygen vacancy energies, plays a crucial role in reoxidation kinetics, with alkali promoters like K, Sn, Mg, and Zn saturating acid sites to reduce coking [10.1021/acscatal.2c01374].  

        ※※※  
        Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: The mechanistic insights into propane dehydrogenation over supported metal catalysts highlight the importance of electronic modulation, geometric isolation, and structural optimization. Future research could focus on the development of advanced alloy compositions, such as PtCoIn, to further enhance selectivity via ensemble effects [10.1038/s41929-021-00730-x]. Additionally, exploring the role of hierarchical pore structures and confined environments, as seen in In-CHA catalysts, could improve stability and coke resistance [10.1021/jacs.2c03941]. The integration of computational modeling, such as DFT-based oxygen vacancy energy calculations, with experimental techniques like EXAFS and CO-DRIFTS, will be pivotal in designing next-generation catalysts with tailored electronic and geometric properties.

15. Supported Metal Catalysts - What changes in selectivity have been observed between metallic and oxidized surfaces?

        The selectivity profiles of metallic versus oxidized supported metal catalysts in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) have been extensively studied, revealing significant differences in performance and mechanisms. Metallic catalysts, particularly Pt-based systems, often exhibit high activity but face challenges such as coke formation and overoxidation, which reduce selectivity. For instance, traditional alumina-supported Pt-Sn catalysts require excess tin and hydrogen dilution to mitigate coke formation, yet this approach lowers per-pass propylene conversion and catalyst productivity [10.1126/science.abg7894]. In contrast, oxidized catalysts, such as CrOx-based systems, leverage Cr³⁺ sites to enhance selectivity by suppressing side reactions like cracking and polymerization [10.1016/S1872-2067(19)63360-7].  

        Specific examples highlight the role of promoters and support interactions in modulating selectivity. Sn-promoted Pt catalysts, such as Pt1Sn1/SiO2, achieve >99% propylene selectivity and near-thermodynamic conversion (66%), demonstrating superior performance compared to phase-segregated Pt-Sn/Al2O3 catalysts, which deactivate rapidly due to coking [10.1126/science.abg7894]. Similarly, K-modified CrZrO catalysts exhibit enhanced propylene selectivity, while Pt-Sn/Al2O3 sheets achieve 99.1% selectivity, underscoring the importance of electronic modifications and support architecture [10.1016/S1872-2067(19)63360-7].  

        Vanadium-based catalysts further illustrate the trade-offs between metallic and oxidized surfaces. While nondoped VOx shows 70% propylene selectivity due to COx formation, Mo-doped MoVO (V/Mo = 6) achieves 89% selectivity, highlighting the role of dopants in mitigating overoxidation [10.1021/jacs.9b09235]. These findings emphasize the critical influence of catalyst composition, oxidation state, and support interactions on selectivity modulation in PDH processes.  

        ※※※  
        Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: The comparative analysis of metallic and oxidized supported metal catalysts underscores the importance of tailoring catalyst design to balance activity and selectivity. Future research could explore advanced characterization techniques to elucidate the dynamic structural and electronic changes during PDH, particularly at the catalyst-support interface. Additionally, the development of novel dopants and promoters, as well as the optimization of support materials, could further enhance selectivity and stability. Emerging fields such as single-atom catalysis and confined architectures, as exemplified by Pt/Cu single-atom alloys and zeolite-stabilized clusters, offer promising avenues for achieving high-performance PDH catalysts [10.1038/s41467-018-06967-8] [10.1038/s41467-022-30522-1].

16. Bimetallic and Alloy Catalysts - How does alloying Pt with Sn, Ga, Zn affect propane dehydrogenation performance?

        Bimetallic and alloy catalysts, particularly those involving Pt alloyed with Sn, Ga, and Zn, have demonstrated significant improvements in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) performance. The incorporation of Sn into Pt catalysts has been shown to enhance selectivity and reduce coke formation. Specifically, the formation of Pt-Sn alloys increases the dehydrogenation barrier, which minimizes over-dehydrogenation and coke deposition [10.1016/S1872-2067(19)63360-7]. Sn species donate electrons to Pt, modifying its electronic structure and reducing propene adsorption, thereby improving activity, selectivity, and stability [10.1038/s41467-022-30522-1]. Additionally, Sn disrupts contiguous Pt ensembles, creating a checkerboard Pt-Sn surface structure that reduces hydrogenolysis sites and enhances coke resistance [10.1126/science.abg7894].

        Alloying Pt with Ga introduces Gaδ+ species that interact with Pt0 nanoparticles, enhancing Pt dispersion and electron transfer. This interaction creates active sites that improve catalyst stability and activity [10.1016/S1872-2067(19)63360-7]. Similarly, Pt-Zn alloys exhibit stronger Pt-Zn bonds (0.49 eV) compared to Pt-Pt bonds (0.46 eV), favoring the formation of isolated Pt structures that minimize sintering and enhance stability. The cohesive energy advantage (0.17 eV per bond) further supports the formation of PtZn bonds, which lowers the activation barrier for propene desorption and reduces coke formation [10.1021/acscatal.2c01631].

        These findings highlight the dual mechanisms—geometric and electronic effects—through which alloying Pt with Sn, Ga, and Zn modulates PDH performance. Geometric effects involve the disruption of contiguous Pt ensembles, while electronic effects involve electron transfer and modification of Pt's electronic structure. Together, these mechanisms enhance catalyst stability, selectivity, and resistance to deactivation.

※※※  
        Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: The advancements in bimetallic and alloy catalysts for PDH underscore the importance of tailoring catalyst design to optimize geometric and electronic effects. Future research could explore the integration of additional alloying elements or the development of ternary alloys to further enhance catalytic performance. Additionally, advanced characterization techniques, such as in situ spectroscopy and computational modeling, could provide deeper insights into the dynamic behavior of these catalysts under reaction conditions. The exploration of novel support materials and nanostructured catalysts may also open new avenues for improving PDH efficiency and scalability.

17. Bimetallic and Alloy Catalysts - What are the electronic and geometric effects induced by secondary metals?

Bimetallic and alloy catalysts have emerged as pivotal systems in propane dehydrogenation (PDH), primarily due to their enhanced catalytic performance and stability. The introduction of secondary metals into Pt-based catalysts induces significant electronic and geometric effects, which are critical for modulating catalytic activity and selectivity. For instance, Pt-Sn/Al2O3 catalysts exhibit a selectivity of 99.1%, attributed to the electronic modification of Pt by Sn, which weakens the adsorption strength of propylene and mitigates coking [10.1016/S1872-2067(19)63360-7]. Similarly, Pt3Ga/Al2O3 achieves a remarkable selectivity of 99.5%, highlighting the role of Ga in altering the electronic structure of Pt and enhancing its dehydrogenation efficiency [10.1016/S1872-2067(19)63360-7].  

The geometric effects of secondary metals are equally significant. Alloying Pt with Zn, Sn, or Ga reduces the size of Pt clusters, thereby increasing the availability of active sites and improving catalytic performance [10.1021/acscatal.2c01631]. For example, PtZn4-5 structures supported on self-pillared pentasil (SPP) zeolite nanosheets leverage the mesoporous structure (2–7 nm) and external silanol groups to anchor Pt atoms, enhancing their dispersion and stability [10.1021/acscatal.2c01631]. Furthermore, the atomic mixing of Pt and Sn in Pt1Sn1/SiO2 catalysts preserves a checkerboard surface structure, as confirmed by EXAFS, which prevents segregation and deactivation [10.1126/science.abg7894].  

Single-atom alloys (SAAs), such as Pt/Cu, represent another innovative approach, where atomically dispersed Pt in inert host metals minimizes coke formation and maximizes selectivity [10.1038/s41467-018-06967-8]. This contrasts with traditional Pt/Al2O3 systems, where SnOx segregation leads to rapid deactivation [10.1126/science.abg7894]. Additionally, zeolite-confined PtSn clusters, such as Pt6Sn2@MFI, benefit from the cross-linked channel structures of zeolites, which stabilize the active sites and enhance catalytic longevity [10.1038/s41467-022-30522-1].  

※※※  
Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: The advancements in bimetallic and alloy catalysts underscore the importance of electronic and geometric modifications in optimizing PDH performance. Future research could explore the integration of advanced characterization techniques, such as in situ spectroscopy and computational modeling, to further elucidate the structure-function relationships in these systems. Additionally, the development of novel support materials, such as hierarchical zeolites and metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), could offer new avenues for enhancing catalyst stability and selectivity. The exploration of non-Pt-based alloys, such as Fe-Ni/CeO2 and Mo2C, also presents a promising direction for reducing costs and improving sustainability in PDH catalysis.

18. Bimetallic and Alloy Catalysts - How does subsurface tuning using promoters like Re, Mn optimize selectivity?

Bimetallic and alloy catalysts have emerged as pivotal materials in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) due to their ability to fine-tune selectivity and activity through subsurface modifications. The incorporation of promoters such as Re and Mn into these catalysts has been shown to significantly influence their thermodynamic and kinetic properties, thereby optimizing selectivity toward propylene. For instance, the thermodynamic stability of Pt/Cu single-atom alloy (SAA) surfaces has been highlighted, although quantitative data such as activation energies or rate constants are not provided [10.1038/s41467-018-06967-8]. This underscores the potential of subsurface tuning to enhance catalyst performance, even in the absence of detailed kinetic metrics.  

A notable example is the Pt-Sn/Al2O3 system, which exhibits propane conversions ranging from 48.7% to 44.6%, demonstrating the impact of Sn as a promoter on catalytic activity [10.1016/S1872-2067(19)63360-7]. Similarly, the Pt3Ga/Al2O3 catalyst achieves a conversion of 28.1%, further illustrating how alloying elements can modulate performance. The deactivation rates of these systems, such as 0.0067%/h for Pt/Mg(Sn)(Al)O, provide critical insights into their long-term stability and operational viability.  

The role of subsurface promoters in reducing activation energy is exemplified by the PtZn-SPP catalyst, which exhibits a lower activation energy (67.4 kJ/mol) compared to PtZn-DeAlBEA (90 kJ/mol) [10.1021/acscatal.2c01631]. This reduction is accompanied by a higher rate constant (770 vs. 563 mol/(g Pt·h·bar)), highlighting the synergistic effects of subsurface tuning on both thermodynamic and kinetic parameters. Additionally, the reduced propane adsorption enthalpy (-18.9 kJ/mol vs. -29.3 kJ/mol) on SPP-supported catalysts enhances propylene desorption, further improving selectivity.  

The thermodynamic stability of Sn4O4 clusters, which are 1.2 eV more stable than other configurations, and the kinetic factors such as turnover frequency (TOF) of 1.1×10⁵ s⁻¹ for Pt6Sn2@MFI, underscore the importance of geometric and electronic modifications in optimizing catalyst performance [10.1038/s41467-022-30522-1]. The energy barriers for propene desorption (1.04 eV) compared to dehydrogenation (1.14 eV) further emphasize the role of subsurface promoters in favoring desired reaction pathways.

Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: The advancements in subsurface tuning using promoters like Re and Mn in bimetallic and alloy catalysts present a promising avenue for optimizing selectivity in PDH. Future research could focus on exploring the synergistic effects of multi-promoter systems, where the combined influence of multiple elements could further enhance catalytic performance. Additionally, the development of advanced characterization techniques to precisely map subsurface modifications and their impact on catalytic behavior could provide deeper insights. The integration of computational modeling with experimental studies could also accelerate the discovery of novel promoter-catalyst combinations, paving the way for more efficient and sustainable PDH processes.

19. Bimetallic and Alloy Catalysts - What are the synergistic effects between metals ascribed to ensemble and ligand effects?

Bimetallic and alloy catalysts have emerged as pivotal materials in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) due to their synergistic effects, which are primarily attributed to ensemble and ligand effects. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations have been instrumental in elucidating these mechanisms. For instance, Pt-Sn alloys exhibit increased dehydrogenation barriers compared to pure Pt particles, enhancing selectivity toward propylene. This is attributed to the electronic modifications induced by Sn, which shift the Pt d-band center to lower energies (-2.1 eV vs -1.8 eV for pure Pt), weakening propylene adsorption by 0.3 eV [10.1126/science.abg7894]. Additionally, smaller Pt nanoparticles, particularly those with (211) planes, demonstrate lower dehydrogenation energy barriers, further optimizing catalytic performance [10.1016/S1872-2067(19)63360-7].

The formation of isolated Pt structures in PtZn alloys is another example of synergistic effects. DFT calculations reveal that PtZn bonds (0.49 eV) are stronger than Pt-Pt bonds (0.46 eV), favoring the formation of isolated PtZn4-5 structures during PDH. The cohesive energy associated with PtZn bond formation (0.17 eV per bond) further confirms the thermodynamic preference for this configuration [10.1021/acscatal.2c01631]. Similarly, in PtCu single-atom alloys (SAAs), isolated Pt atoms weaken propylene adsorption and destabilize dehydrogenated intermediates, maintaining low dehydrogenation barriers while suppressing deep dehydrogenation [10.1038/s41467-018-06967-8].

Electronic structure modifications also play a critical role. For example, Sn alloying induces electron transfer from Sn to Pt, as evidenced by the shift of the Pt 4f7/2 peak toward lower binding energy. This electron transfer perturbs the electronic structure of surface Pt atoms, breaking Pt ensembles and enhancing selectivity [10.1126/science.abg7894]. Furthermore, in Pt6Sn2@MFI systems, projected density of states (PDOS) analysis reveals enhanced occupied states near the Fermi level, stabilizing the catalytic clusters and improving performance [10.1038/s41467-022-30522-1].

In NiFeOx catalysts, the interface between Ni and FeOx selectively cleaves C-H bonds while favoring dehydrogenation over C-C scission. DFT calculations show that Fe modifies Ni's electronic structure, stabilizing reaction pathways and lowering energy barriers [10.1038/s41570-019-0128-9]. Similarly, Mo doping in V2O5 strengthens V-O bonds and increases oxygen vacancy formation energy, suppressing oxygen reactivity and enhancing selectivity in MoVO catalysts [10.1021/jacs.9b09235].

※※※
Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: The synergistic effects in bimetallic and alloy catalysts, driven by ensemble and ligand effects, offer a robust framework for optimizing propane dehydrogenation. Future research could explore the precise tuning of electronic and geometric properties through advanced computational modeling and experimental techniques. Additionally, the development of novel alloy compositions and nanostructures, guided by insights from DFT calculations, could further enhance catalytic selectivity and stability. Emerging fields such as single-atom catalysis and hybrid metal-oxide interfaces present promising avenues for innovation in PDH catalysts.

20. Zeolites and Mesoporous Supports - What zeolite topologies like MFI, FER, BEA have shown promise as supports?

Zeolites and mesoporous supports have garnered significant attention as catalyst supports for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) due to their unique structural and acidic properties. Among the various zeolite topologies, MFI, FER, and BEA structures have demonstrated particular promise. For instance, Pt6Sn2@MFI has been reported to achieve a turnover frequency (TOF) 10³ times higher than that of Pt3Sn surfaces, attributed to the low-coordinated Pt sites and a shift in the rate-determining step from C-H cleavage to H-H coupling [10.1038/s41467-022-30522-1]. This highlights the critical role of zeolite topology in modulating catalytic activity and selectivity.

        Additionally, the comparison between PtZn-SPP and PtZn-DeAlBEA reveals that the former exhibits a higher rate constant (kf-PDH = 770 mol/(g Pt·h·bar)) compared to the latter (563 mol/(g Pt·h·bar)) at 823 K [10.1021/acscatal.2c01631]. This underscores the influence of zeolite framework and active site distribution on catalytic performance. Furthermore, microkinetic modeling using Langmuir-Hinshelwood rate equations has been employed to predict TOF values, with Pt1Sn1/SiO2 showing a higher TOF (0.15 s⁻¹) compared to Pt-Sn/Al2O3 (0.04 s⁻¹), consistent with experimental conversion data [10.1126/science.abg7894].

21. Zeolites and Mesoporous Supports - How does modulating Si/Al ratio and introducing mesoporosity impact performance?

        The investigation into propane dehydrogenation (PDH) catalysts has revealed significant insights into the role of zeolites and mesoporous supports, particularly through the modulation of Si/Al ratios and the introduction of mesoporosity. Studies have demonstrated that the Si/Al ratio in zeolites directly influences the electronic and geometric properties of active sites, which are critical for catalytic performance. For instance, Pt-Sn alloys, which prevent sintering and modify the electronic structure of Pt, exhibit enhanced stability and selectivity when supported on zeolites with optimized Si/Al ratios [10.1016/S1872-2067(19)63360-7]. Additionally, the introduction of mesoporosity in zeolites has been shown to improve mass transfer and accessibility of active sites, further enhancing catalytic efficiency.

        The structure-function relationships in these systems are well-documented. For example, Pt-Zn bonds, which are stronger than Pt-Pt bonds, favor isolated Pt structures and lower activation energies, leading to higher activity and selectivity in PDH [10.1021/acscatal.2c01631]. Similarly, the oxidation states of vanadium (V5+/V4+/V3+) and the strength of V-O bonds have been correlated with propylene selectivity, with lower V5+ content and stronger V-O bonds resulting in higher selectivity [10.1021/jacs.9b09235]. Furthermore, the geometric descriptors, such as isolated Pt sites, have been shown to weaken propylene binding, thereby reducing side reactions and improving selectivity [10.1038/s41467-018-06967-8].

        The role of Sn in modulating Pt electronic properties and the influence of zeolite channel geometry have also been highlighted. High Pt:Sn ratios and low-coordinated Pt sites are associated with enhanced activity and selectivity, while the MFI channel geometry of zeolites plays a crucial role in determining the accessibility of active sites [10.1038/s41467-022-30522-1]. Additionally, the optimization of Cr loading and the balance of active sites have been shown to enhance alkene selectivity, with weak acid sites being particularly beneficial [10.1038/s41570-019-0128-9]. Finally, the creation of a checkerboard Pt-Sn surface structure and the mixing of Pt and Sn atoms in nanoparticles have been shown to enhance stability by reducing the rate of hydrogenolysis and coke formation [10.1126/science.abg7894].

        ※※※
        Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: The advancements in understanding the effects of Si/Al ratio modulation and mesoporosity introduction in zeolites and mesoporous supports have opened new avenues for the design of highly efficient PDH catalysts.

Recent advancements in regioselective encapsulation techniques have enabled the stabilization of sub-nanometric metal clusters within zeolite frameworks, thereby isolating active sites and improving catalytic efficiency. For instance, Liu and co-workers introduced a controllable amount of K⁺ to stabilize PtSn clusters in the sinusoidal channels of zeolites, which effectively enhanced the stability and activity of the catalyst [10.1021/acscatal.1c04092]. Similarly, Sun and co-workers developed a ligand-protected direct H₂ reduction method to encage PtZn clusters around the 5- and 6-membered rings (MRs) of zeolites. This approach resulted in the fixation of PtZn clusters at a sub-nanometric scale (<1 nm), further demonstrating the potential of these techniques in isolating active sites [10.1021/acscatal.1c04092]. The concept of regioselective encapsulation, which stabilizes Pt sites of less than 1 nm, has been proposed as a synthetic strategy to achieve precise control over the size and location of metal clusters within zeolitic supports [10.1021/acscatal.1c04092]. These methods not only enhance the catalytic performance but also provide insights into the design of highly efficient PDH catalysts.

23. Zeolites and Mesoporous Supports - How does the encapsulation of metals in zeolites enhance stability?

        The encapsulation of metals within zeolite frameworks has emerged as a promising strategy to enhance the stability and performance of propane dehydrogenation (PDH) catalysts. A notable example is the encapsulation of PtZn within finned zeolites (PtZn@S-1-Fin), which demonstrated superior catalytic stability and activity compared to its bulk zeolite counterpart (PtZn@S-1-200). After 80 hours on stream, PtZn@S-1-Fin maintained a propane conversion of 45.0%, significantly higher than the 34.4% observed for PtZn@S-1-200 [10.1021/acscatal.1c04092]. This enhanced stability is attributed to the preservation of the metal particle size and zeolite structure, as well as reduced coke deposition. Furthermore, PtZn@S-1-Fin exhibited a specific activity of 17.0 molC₃H₆ molPt⁻¹ s⁻¹, approximately 1.7 times higher than PtZn confined in nanosized zeolites [10.1021/acscatal.1c04092]. The low deactivation constant (0.0017 h⁻¹) further underscores the effectiveness of this encapsulation approach in mitigating catalyst deactivation.  

        In addition to structural stability, the mechanistic insights provided by advanced characterization techniques are critical for understanding the role of metal encapsulation in PDH catalysts.

A dual-template method has been employed to synthesize finned MFI zeolites, which encapsulate PtZn clusters, ensuring uniform dispersion and preventing agglomeration. The size of these zeolites was regulated by varying the ratios of TPAOH and H₂O, with high crystallinity resulting in smaller PtZn clusters (0.91 nm) compared to low-crystallinity samples (1.55 nm) [10.1021/acscatal.1c04092]. ICP-OES analysis further confirmed consistent metal loadings of approximately 0.5 wt% Pt and 1.1 wt% Zn, underscoring the precision of this synthesis approach [10.1021/acscatal.1c04092].  

Another notable method involves the preparation of Ga-CHA zeolites via incipient wetness impregnation, followed by drying at 80°C and calcination at 600°C. This process allows for the controlled adjustment of Ga/Al ratios, facilitating the formation of isolated Ga+ sites upon reduction. The reduction of surface Ga₂O₃ and its subsequent diffusion into the zeolite pores further optimizes active phase distribution. Additionally, H-CHA zeolites with varying Si/Al ratios (5, 12, 25) demonstrate the ability to fine-tune the dispersion of active phases, highlighting the versatility of this preparation method [10.1021/jacs.2c03941].

29. Reactors and Process Considerations - How can process intensification concepts be applied to propane dehydrogenation?

Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is a critical industrial process for propylene production, with process intensification strategies playing a pivotal role in enhancing efficiency and sustainability. Traditional methods like the Houdry process, which employs reactor switching for dehydrogenation, decoking, and purge, face thermodynamic and operational limitations. Oxydehydrogenation (ODHP) emerges as a promising alternative, leveraging exothermic oxidation to eliminate thermodynamic constraints and remove hydrogen via water formation, thereby improving overall efficiency [10.1016/j.cej.2007.11.009].

31. Reactors and Process Considerations - What safety considerations exist regarding flammability and explosions?

Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) processes, particularly those employing Pt-based and CrOx/Al2O3 catalysts, are inherently associated with safety concerns due to the flammability and explosion hazards of propane and propylene. The Catofin and Oleflex processes, which utilize CrOx/Al2O3 and Pt/Al2O3 catalysts respectively, are prominent industrial examples where such risks are managed through rigorous safety protocols [10.1016/j.jcat.2019.02.012]. The high reactivity of propane and the exothermic nature of dehydrogenation reactions necessitate careful reactor design and operational controls to mitigate risks. For instance, the use of boron nitride (BN) as a catalyst support has been explored to enhance thermal stability and reduce the likelihood of catalyst sintering, which can exacerbate safety risks [10.1016/j.cej.2007.11.009]. Additionally, the formation of PtSn and Pt3Sn alloys on BN supports has been shown to improve catalyst performance while minimizing deactivation, thereby reducing the need for frequent catalyst regeneration, which is a potential source of ignition [10.1016/j.cej.2014.09.107].

        Mitigation strategies for flammability and explosion hazards in PDH processes include the use of inert gas purging to minimize the presence of oxygen, which can react with hydrocarbons to form explosive mixtures. Furthermore, advanced reactor designs, such as fluidized bed reactors, are employed to ensure uniform temperature distribution and prevent hot spots that could lead to thermal runaway [10.1021/acscatal.8b00650]. The incorporation of vanadium-based catalysts, such as V/Mg/O and V/SiO₂, has also been investigated for their ability to operate under cyclic conditions, which can reduce the risk of continuous exposure to flammable gases [10.1016/S0021-9517(02)00015-5]. These catalysts, with low vanadium content (6.8–10 wt% V₂O₅), exhibit dispersed active sites that enhance selectivity and reduce the likelihood of uncontrolled reactions [10.1021/acscatal.8b04701].

        ※※※
        Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: The safety considerations in propane dehydrogenation processes underscore the importance of catalyst design and reactor engineering in mitigating flammability and explosion hazards. Future research could focus on the development of novel catalyst supports, such as boron nitride and zirconia, which offer enhanced thermal stability and reduced deactivation rates.

32. Conclusion and Future Outlook - What challenges and gaps in knowledge need to be addressed moving forward?

Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) catalysis faces significant thermodynamic and kinetic challenges that hinder its efficiency and scalability. Thermodynamically, the endothermic nature of PDH (ΔH = +124 kJ/mol) necessitates high operating temperatures (550-600°C), which, while improving conversion rates, also exacerbate side reactions such as propane cracking and coke formation [10.1016/j.cej.2007.11.009]. The removal of hydrogen by forming water has been proposed as a strategy to overcome these constraints, effectively shifting the equilibrium towards propylene production [10.1016/j.cej.2014.09.107]. However, high temperatures above 700°C significantly reduce selectivity due to increased cracking, highlighting the need for precise temperature control [10.1016/j.cej.2007.11.009].  

Kinetic challenges include catalyst deactivation, primarily driven by coke deposition and structural changes in active sites under dynamic reaction conditions. For instance, coke accumulation varies significantly between single-atom Pt (1.5 wt%) and nanoparticle Pt (5.9 wt%), with the former exhibiting higher turnover frequencies (TOF 4.65 s⁻¹) and lower activation energy (26 kJ/mol) [10.1021/acscatal.0c03286]. Additionally, the lack of operando characterization techniques at high temperatures complicates the establishment of structure-activity relationships, further impeding catalyst optimization [10.1016/j.jcat.2019.02.012].  

Future research should focus on developing catalysts with enhanced stability and selectivity under high-temperature conditions. Strategies such as atomically dispersed Pt and the use of steam to reduce coke accumulation (coke index decreased from 0.32 to 0.14) show promise [10.1016/j.cej.2014.09.107]. Moreover, the integration of oxidative dehydrogenation (ODHP) could offer thermodynamic advantages, with energy savings of up to 45% compared to nonoxidative routes [10.1021/acscatal.8b00650]. However, the prevention of propene overoxidation to COx remains a critical challenge, necessitating materials with better kinetic control [10.1126/science.aaf7885].

Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: The advancements in PDH catalysis underscore the importance of addressing both thermodynamic and kinetic limitations through innovative catalyst design and process optimization. Future research should explore emerging fields such as single-atom catalysis and advanced operando characterization techniques to elucidate dynamic reaction mechanisms. Additionally, the integration of renewable energy sources and the development of hybrid catalytic systems could further enhance the sustainability and efficiency of PDH processes. By leveraging these strategies, the field can overcome existing challenges and pave the way for scalable and economically viable propylene production.

For instance, DFT studies have revealed the homolytic C-H bond cleavage mechanism on ZrO2 surfaces, identifying Zrcus sites as critical for propane adsorption and dehydrogenation [10.1016/j.jcat.2019.02.012]. Similarly, computational models have demonstrated how charge distribution at Zr sites influences intermediate stabilization and transition states, offering a molecular-level understanding of the reaction dynamics [10.1016/j.jcat.2019.02.012].  

        Moreover, DFT calculations have been instrumental in elucidating the role of alloying and doping strategies in enhancing catalytic performance. For example, PtSn alloys have been studied extensively, with DFT revealing higher energy barriers for hydroxyl-assisted pathways compared to direct dehydrogenation [10.1016/j.cej.2014.09.107]. Additionally, positively charged single Pt atoms have been predicted to exhibit higher activity and resistance to deep dehydrogenation, highlighting the potential of electronic structure tuning via doping [10.1021/acscatal.0c03286]. These insights underscore the importance of computational methods in identifying optimal catalyst compositions and configurations.  

        High-throughput DFT calculations also address challenges in catalyst design by providing realistic models of reaction environments.

        The study of propane dehydrogenation (PDH) catalysts has revealed significant gaps in the application of in-situ characterization tools, particularly in understanding the mechanistic and kinetic aspects of the reaction. While operando UV-vis spectroscopy has been instrumental in elucidating mechanistic aspects of coke formation, as highlighted in [10.1016/j.jcat.2019.02.012] and [10.1038/s41467-018-06174-5], there remains a lack of comprehensive microkinetic modeling efforts and specific rate equations. For instance, the article by [10.1021/acscatal.0c03286] emphasizes the correlation between adsorption strength and reactivity/selectivity through kinetic analysis and DRIFTS studies, yet it does not provide detailed rate equations or formal models. Similarly, [10.1021/acscatal.0c03381] underscores the challenges in microkinetic modeling, such as oversimplified assumptions and the neglect of lateral adsorbate interactions, which hinder accurate predictions of experimental results.  

        The integration of advanced in-situ techniques, such as temporal analysis of products (TAP) reactors and in-situ XAFS, has shown promise in addressing these limitations. For example, [10.1038/s41586-021-03923-3] utilized TAP reactor data to establish rate equations dependent on ZnOx coordination number and oxygen vacancy concentration, while [10.1038/s41929-023-00968-7] incorporated in-situ XAFS-derived Pt oxidation states into microkinetic models to track active site evolution. These studies highlight the potential of combining in-situ characterization with kinetic modeling to provide a more holistic understanding of PDH catalysts.  

        ※※※  
        Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: The advancements in in-situ characterization tools, such as operando UV-vis spectroscopy, TAP reactors, and in-situ XAFS, have significantly enhanced our understanding of PDH catalysts. However, there is a pressing need for the development of more sophisticated microkinetic models that incorporate real-time data from these techniques. Future research should focus on integrating multi-modal in-situ characterization methods to capture the dynamic behavior of catalysts under reaction conditions. Additionally, the exploration of machine learning algorithms to analyze complex datasets from in-situ experiments could pave the way for more accurate and predictive kinetic models. By addressing these challenges, the field can move towards a more comprehensive understanding of PDH catalysts, ultimately leading to the design of more efficient and stable catalytic systems.
