This review comprehensively surveys recent progress in PDH catalyst design, mechanistic principles, characterization techniques and process intensification. Key advancements include stabilized single-atom Pt sites in zeolites and revelation of active chromium species. However, transforming laboratory achievements like isolated metal sites and bimetallic alloys into commercially viable catalysts requires addressing remaining challenges around deactivation, substituting precious metals and improving energy efficiency.

Introduction - The Significance of Propylene in Chemical Industry and the Importance of Propane Dehydrogenation
Propylene constitutes a vital chemical feedstock utilized in the production of diverse products spanning polypropylene, acrylonitrile, propylene oxide and acetone[1,2], with rapidly rising global demand estimated to reach 191 megatons by 2030 [3]. Conventional production routes via steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking have proven inadequate to satisfy burgeoning propylene requirements[1,2]. Consequently, on-purpose generation of propylene through propane dehydrogenation (PDH) has emerged as an innovative and economically competitive pathway by exploiting abundant supplies of propane obtainable from shale gas[4,5].  
Numerous studies have highlighted PDH’s efficacy in redressing propylene’s supply deficit through an eco-friendly avenue[6,7]. Exploring novel catalyst and process designs to elevate propylene yield and selectivity from propane seems particularly rewarding[8,9]. Researchers might ex	amine integrating PDH with other chemical manufacturing routes in bio- or electro-refinery configurations for optimal resource usage. Overall, PDH retains formidable potential for upscaling by harnessing recent advancements to enable economical and sustainable large-scale propylene production.  

Introduction - Mechanisms of Catalysis in Propane Dehydrogenation: The Role of Activation Barrier Reduction
An exhaustive survey of the cited literature[2,5,8,10-15] determined catalysts facilitate propane dehydrogenation by furnishing reactive conduits that selectively cleave C-H over C-C bonds with mitigated activation barriers. Platinum-anchored catalysts are extensively utilized, harnessing platinum’s predisposition to sever C-H moieties while minimizing cracking side-reactions[11,12]. Dominant mechanisms proposed entail hydrogen abstraction to constitute metal-carbon ligatures on coordinatively vacant territory[8,13].
Complementary catalytic formulations under exploration encompass metal oxides such as ZrO2 and Ga2O3 which could furnish oxygen vacancies or Lewis acid constituent sites[14,15]. Analogously, zeolites interchanged with metal cations may contribute electron density to adsorbed propane[3]. Mesoporous silica backbones additionally proffer possibilities for tuning selectivity and reactivity[4].

Introduction - Overview of Key Catalyst Classes in Propane Dehydrogenation
The manuscript highlights several prevailing catalyst categories scrutinized for propane dehydrogenation, encompassing bolstered metals, metal oxides, alloys, and zeolites. Explicitly, supported platinum and chromium oxide catalysts constitute conventional industrial selections employed in the Catofin and Oleflex processes[7]. Supplementary inexpensive alternatives like supported vanadium and iron oxides, gallium oxides, alongside zeolites such as cobalt-laden H-Beta and BEA have exhibited favorable potential[4,6,16]. Despite the dominance of supported metals and metal oxides, intermetallic alloys and isolated metal entity catalysts have recently materialized as active and selective candidates[10,17].  		
With numerous propitious catalyst genres and formulations presented, sustained efforts to refine extant synthesis protocols alongside exploring unprecedented architectures seems worthwhile. Emergent preparatory techniques could engender superior jurisdiction over active site segregation and metal-support crosstalk to boost stability and selectivity. Incorporating promoters or strategic doping might potentially fine-tune catalytic comportment. More extensive assimilation of operando methodologies can proffer invaluable perspectives into functional state speciation and deactivation pathways to spearhead optimization endeavors.  

Theoretical Principles and Computational Approaches - Thermodynamics and Kinetics in Propane Dehydrogenation
An exhaustive assessment of the cited literature[1,5,9,11,18] divulged propane dehydrogenation contends with substantial thermodynamic impediments and kinetic factors curtailing conversion and selectivity.
PDH constitutes an extremely endothermic process[11,18]; with ΔH spanning 124-200 kJ/mol[9,18]. Attaining reaction feasibility necessitates high process temperatures between 500-650°C[1,5], often engendering coke accrual and other side reactions [10,11]. Additionally, low partial pressures promote product formation by shifting the equilibrium [3]. Introducing oxidants like O2 or CO2 could moderate requisite temperatures through providing exothermic complementary reactions[3], albeit with associated tradeoffs.  
Kinetically, PDH exhibits lofty energy barriers around 0.7-1.8 eV for critical C-H activation transitions[4,5], hindering turnover frequences. Support and promoter affiliations assist active site stabilization against sintering [6] at elevated temperatures. Structure-sensitive side reactions like coking and hydrogenolysis manifest on specific motifs, while the principal PDH route may be structure-insensitive[11].  

Theoretical Principles and Computational Approaches - Utilizing DFT Calculations for Reaction Mechanism Exploration
Computational examinations harnessing density functional theory (DFT) enumeration have proffered invaluable insights into propane dehydrogenation mechanisms, kinetics and pathways over diverse catalyst systems. [6] DFT interpretations consolidated with microkinetic renderings have elucidated structure-activity interrelationships, pinpointing illustrative descriptors like d-band centers correlating with selectivity on metals  [6], alongside unveiling kinetically-limiting strides like propylene C-H activation. [10] DFT has additionally investigated isolated metal entity catalysts, evincing dopant and support ramifications for fine-tuning performance.[17]
Regarding solid acid catalysts, DFT rationalized Zn-O-Zn constituents wield lower apparent activation barriers relative to Zn^2+^ entities for H-ZSM-5 mediated dehydrogenation. [6] For Sn-BEA, DFT deemed the undeviating pathway more kinetically favorable over closed sites versus the indirect sequence, with unrestricted locations demonstrating higher reactivity pending hydroxylation. [16] DFT has also furnished mechanistic intricacies over zeolites, demonstrating dissociative propane adsorption prevails over radical propagation on Zn-loaded mordenite.[19]
Collectively, DFT contributes foundational atomic-scale perspectives interlinking configuration, descriptors and mechanisms to observed catalyst performance inclinations. Persisting refinements in functionals, assimilating entropy and solvent influences, alongside coalescing with microkinetic renderings will enable enhanced computational illumination and screening for optimal PDH catalysts.  

Theoretical Principles and Computational Approaches - Insights from Microkinetic Models in Dehydrogenation Kinetics
An exhaustive assessment of the cited literature[5,8,20] determined microkinetic models have furnished perspectives into propane dehydrogenation kinetics:
The manuscript[8] presents microkinetic formulations of PDH harnessing DFT-acquired variables. It examines reaction rate equations, surface coverage extents, turnover frequencies, selectivity coefficients and rate-limiting strides.  
The publication [5] unveils microkinetic simulation endeavors exercising the CATKINAS suite to evaluate single-atom catalyst kinetics and prospective industrial applicability. Parameters obtained from DFT enumerations were recruited to conduct the simulations.  
The article[20] exhibits microkinetic renderings that exercised descriptors for screening and stratifying intermetallic catalysts founded on formation energies and reaction rate representations. This facilitated predicting activity and propylene selectivity.

Theoretical Principles and Computational Approaches - Correlating Catalyst Properties with Performance: The Role of Descriptors
As evidenced in the manuscripts[5,15,20], select examinations have harnessed computational methodologies to unveil structure-activity affiliations and pinpoint descriptors correlating catalyst traits to propane dehydrogenation performance.  
One undertaking instituted scaling relationships between formation energies of PDH transient species on transition metal planes to ascertain the ethyl and methylidyne adsorption energies as ideal reactivity descriptors[20]. Another endeavor identified a volcano-type activity trend with respect to propylene adsorption energy by means of microkinetic simulation of single-atom catalysts[5].Additionally, degree of rate control interrogation on DFT-enumerated transition states was leveraged to ascertain rate-limiting PDH strides and accordingly construct descriptors derived from the energies of said strides[15].
Complementing computational quests, select empirical studies have also delineated structure-activity correlations. The dispersion of active constituents, metal loading extents and support type were allied with catalytic performance[4]. Platinum atom ensembles were revealed to drive coke accrual, while segregated single platinum atoms conferred enhanced resilience[11]. 

Metal Oxide Catalysts - Efficacy of Metal Oxides like Cr2O3, Ga2O3 in Propane Dehydrogenation
Among investigated metal oxide catalysts, polymorphs of gallium oxide and chromium oxide demonstrate particular promise for propane dehydrogenation based on reported productivity. 
Gallium oxide polymorphs including α-Ga2O3, β-Ga2O3, and γ-Ga2O3 were assessed by Zhang et al., with β-Ga2O3 exhibiting maximal initial activity attributed to superior surface acidity from NH3-TPD characterization[21]. Silica-supported β-Ga2O3 and γ-Ga2O3 also gave excellent propylene yields. Cargnello et al. verified strong intrinsic activity for propane activation over amorphous Ga2O3 nanoparticles on silica using in-situ IR spectroscopy[14]. In comparative screening across metal oxides, Ga2O3 outperformed Fe2O3 and Cr2O3, achieving 60% propane conversion[4]. 
Chromium oxide has also garnered interest, with Cr-based catalysts recognized among the most active formulations for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane with CO2[22]. Using kinetic Monte Carlo simulations, Chang et al. proposed a detailed non-oxidative PDH mechanism over the Cr2O3(0001) model surface[23]. Weak metal-support interactions with SiO2 were shown to limit over-oxidation, improving Cr2O3’s propylene selectivity[4]. Against different metal oxides, Cr2O3 gave higher yields than Fe2O3 and Al2O3[4], although deactivation from coking remains an issue. 
In summary, gallium and chromium oxides have exhibited encouraging intrinsic PDH activity and propylene selectivity as cheaper alternatives to conventional metals. However, stability and longevity still need improvement through composition modulation, metal-support interfacial engineering, and other strategies. Advancing these metal oxide catalysts could ultimately provide economical and scalable PDH process technologies. Ongoing efforts should emphasize clarifying active site speciation, delineating degradation mechanisms, and translating insights into superior catalytic architectures.

Metal Oxide Catalysts - Influence of Oxidation State and Oxygen Mobility on Catalyst Performance
The manuscript divulges substantiation exhibiting tuning oxidation states, oxygen mobility, and acid-base attributes of metal oxides can influence propane dehydrogenation performance [24].
Regarding oxidation states, eliciting oxygen vacancies on Al2O3 reduced aluminum coordination, begetting Alcus-O acid-base couples fine-tuning transient species adsorption energies alongside lowering reaction barriers, thereby boosting PDH activity[24]. Partly reduced V3+/V4+ vanadium oxides on supports like ZrO2 were also identified as the reactive conduits for PDH without supplemental oxygen introduction [25]. For chromium oxides, oscillating between Cr3+ and Cr6+ oxidation states assists completing the Mars-van Krevelen redox mechanism integral for activity[26]. 
In terms of oxygen mobility, LaZrOx with the most labile metal-oxygen linkage and highest oxygen motility demonstrated the greatest intrinsic PDH activity among SiO2, Al2O3 and ZrO2 adjuvants [27]. TiOx ultrathin nanosheets with abundant oxygen vacancies also exhibited higher concentrations of coordinatively unsaturated Ti4c sites after H2 reduction, directly correlating with improved PDH performance [28]. 
Regarding acid-base traits, tailoring the Zr/Ga ratio of ZrO2/Ga2O3 mixed oxides produced optimal base site density and acid site strength, with a Zr/Ga ratio of 0.26/1 attaining 50.1% propane conversion [14]. The surface acid site density of Ga2O3 polymorphs also correlated with initial catalytic activity, with β-Ga2O3 displaying the maximum density [29]. Manipulating these oxidation states, oxygen mobility extents, and acid-base properties thus presents clear prospects to enhance metal oxide catalysts for propylene generation.

Metal Oxide Catalysts - Mechanistic Scenarios in Different Metal Oxide Catalysts
An exhaustive literature review[4,30-37] divulged assorted mechanistic postulations over metal oxide catalysts:  
Several manuscripts delineate Mars-van Krevelen archetypes operational during propane dehydrogenation over metal oxides like VOx/ZrO2[30], CrOx/ZrO2[31] and MoVO mixed oxides[32]. Herein, lattice oxygen initiates reactions through abstracting hydrogen from propane. Ensuing alkyl intermediates eventually yield propene, while the partially reduced metal oxide surface becomes re-oxidized by O2 or CO2 thus completing the catalytic sequence.
Segregated metal cations with coordinative unsaturation (designated Mcus) manifest as reactive loci on numerous catalysts. On CrOx/ZrO2, Zrcus positions adjoining oxygen vacancies catalyze C-H cleavage [33]. Isolated Zn2+ on ZrO2 [34] and Ga+/H+ pairs on Ga/H-ZSM-5[35] also demonstrate appreciable activity. Proximity of these Mcus sites to acid/base functionalities assists subsequent reaction strides like hydride transfer. 
Several manuscripts accentuate the role of redox cycles Mx+ ↔ M(x-1)+ (x = 3-6) in activating propane on Cr [4] and V oxides [36]. Optimal valency states like Cr3+ or V3+ counterpoise activity and resilience to over-reduction. Tetrahedral Ga3+ motifs selectively cleave C-H bonds on Ga2O3 via heterolytic scission sans altering oxidation state [37].

Metal Oxide Catalysts - Impact of Metal-Support Interaction on Activity and Selectivity
Wang et al.[25] explored metal-support interfacial effects in VOx catalysts for propane dehydrogenation, systematically scrutinizing influence of assorted oxide adjuvants on supported VOx activity. VOx/ZrO2 demonstrated over 4-fold superior activity relative to VOx bolstered on other oxides, ascribed via DFT renderings to weakened VOx-ZrO2 affiliations attenuating electron density on bridge oxygen atoms and thus elevating C-H cleavage capability in propane. The principles established offer guidance for tuning VO active site microenvironments to achieve improved PDH performance. 
Additionally, Liu et al. [38] exhibited that for vanadium oxide on silica adjuvants, fragile interaction with surface silanol constituents elicits undesired 3D nanoparticle accretion. Augmenting sodium content engenders more reactive SiONa+ loci instigating 2D vanadia anchoring and thus optimizing dispersion to match other supports, consequently ameliorating activity while preserving selectivity.
Moreover, Zhang et al. [39] demonstrated dealumination of BEA zeolite substratum produces silanol functionalities avowing isolated Co2+ cations. These resilient cobalt active sites preferentially activate C-H over C-C bonds in propane, attaining elevated propylene selectivity.
These instances underscore strategic manipulation of metal-support bimodules in oxide catalysts furnishes targeted avenues for tailoring PDH performance.  

Supported Metal Catalysts - Exploration of Single Metals like Pt, Pd, Ir in Propane Dehydrogenation
An exhaustive literature survey [40-54] divulged several explorations of supported mono-metallic Pt, Pd or Ir catalysts for propane dehydrogenation.
An undertaking by Burch and Watling[41] scrutinized incorporating sulfur during preparatory phases or reaction streams over Pt/alumina catalysts for PDH. Cardinal revelations were H2S pre-dosing at 873 K substantially upgraded selectivity towards propene, alongside sulfur assimilation during synthesis demonstrating higher efficacy than during operation. 
Additional works evaluated Pt on boron nitride (Pt/BN) [42], SBA-15 (Pt/SBA-15)[43], Al2O3 [44,45], and zeolites such as Ge-UTL (Pt/Ge-UTL) [46] and Zn-ZSM-5 (Pt/Zn-ZSM-5)[47]. Promoter influences like Ca[48], Sn [40,49] and Pb[50] on Pt catalysts were also probed. These contributions offered wisdom into metal-support affiliations, alloying effects and tactics for upgrading Pt resilience and selectivity. 
A few examinations also surveyed supported Pd[51], Rh [52], Ru [53,54] and Ir [51], albeit with more limited datasets relative to Pt catalysts.  
Collectively, Pt-anchored systems persist as the most extensively dissected mono-metallic configurations for PDH, with sophisticated mechanistic perspectives garnered on supported Pt catalysts employing advanced characterization techniques. However, broadening explorations to additional noble metals and modifiers could unveil more opportunities for enhancing catalytic performance.

Supported Metal Catalysts - Effect of Metal Particle Size, Shape, and Support on Catalytic Activity and Stability
The cited literature[42-44,46,55,56] proffers substantiation indicating traits like metal particle dimensions, morphology, support interactions and pretreatment conditions affect catalytic performance and resilience of reinforced metal catalysts for propane dehydrogenation. 
Explicitly, reference[43] reveals a Pt/SBA-15 catalyst configured via deposition-precipitation possesses much smaller Pt particles relative to wet impregnation protocols. The smaller Pt particles confer superior initial conversion and propylene selectivity, despite deactivation owed to coke accrual. Reference[44] demonstrates depositing uniform, nanoscale Al2O3 overlayers on Pt nanoparticles via ALD augments stability and selectivity by impeding sintering and limiting formation of less selective sites during steam regeneration. An optimal coating thickness of 6-8 Å after 5-7 ALD cycles is discerned.  
Regarding shape effects, reference[55] calculates under-coordinated Pt(211) facets prevail over Pt(111) terrace sites in governing reactivity, despite reduced surface areas. This signifies the considerable morphologic influence on catalytic comportment. Additionally, reference[56] elucidates the reaction sequence and pivotal transient species participating during PDH on Pt(111), thus providing mechanistic perspectives. 
Concerning metal-support interactions, reference [42] demonstrates robust affiliations between Pt and boron nitride post high temperature preconditioning. This elicits partial encapsulation of Pt particles by boron oxide overlays, which constrains particle dimensions, occludes non-selective loci and thus improves resilience. Analogously, reference [46] stabilizes ultrafine Pt clusters in 14-membered ring zeolite pores via Pt-O-Ge bonds. This tailored metal-support conjunction confers outstanding PDH performance.
In summation, deliberate modulation of attributes like particle size, morphology, metal-support bimodules and preparatory conditions empowers governance over abundance and accessibility of selective sites, hence enabling optimization of reinforced metal catalysts for targeted PDH conversion and propylene selectivity.

Supported Metal Catalysts - Mechanistic Pathways in Supported Metal Catalysts
A meticulous literature interrogation revealed most contributions concentrate on characterization and assessment of catalytic performance over manifold supported metal catalysts without delving into mechanistic postulations or reaction coordinates.
Scarce exceptions discussing mechanisms encompass reference[44] , which proposes distinct trajectories over Pt(111) and Pt(211) facets – a reverse Horiuti-Polanyi sequence on Pt(111) and an unconventional non-reverse pathway on Pt(211) entailing successive dehydrogenation and hydrogenation strides. Reference[46] also delineates a mechanism over Pt-Ge dual sites on UTL zeolite, with the inaugural C-H scission constituting the rate-limiting step.
In summation, most academic contributions lack profound mechanistic analysis and future endeavors should emphasis more rigorously garnering molecular-scale perspectives into catalytic cycles and active site prerequisites for supported metal catalysts in propane dehydrogenation. Computational examinations assimilated with sophisticated spectroscopic probing can facilitate unveiling mechanistic intricacies and thus bolster rational catalyst optimization. 

Supported Metal Catalysts - Observations in Selectivity Changes on Metallic vs Oxidized Surfaces
A meticulous examination of the presented references unveiled a paucity of side-by-side appraisals contrasting the selectivity renditions of metallic relative to oxidized supported metal catalysts for propane dehydrogenation. Maximum manuscripts concentrated exclusively on gauging manifold bimetallic or alloy catalysts such as PtZn[57], PtGa [58] and PtSn[59] for propane dehydrogenation devoid of oxidized analogs.	
A few publications explored metal catalysts reinforced on constituents like H-ZSM-5 [35], alumina[60] and titanosilicate TS-1 [61] sans contrasting oxidized configurations. Certain manuscripts evaluated metal oxide catalysts encompassing chromium [62] and vanadium oxides [63], nonetheless omitting metallic counterparts or selectivity comparisons thereof. 
Collectively, appreciable gaps persist regarding oxidation state ramifications on selectivity trends for supported metal propane dehydrogenation catalysts. This arena shows formidable promise for supplemental explorations towards augmenting structure-function comprehension to facilitate the conception of more selective catalytic materials. 

Bimetallic and Alloy Catalysts - Propane Dehydrogenation Performance in Pt-Alloyed Catalysts
An exhaustive literature review[6,20,64-71] revealed bimetallic and alloy Pt catalysts assimilated with Sn, Ga and Zn demonstrate ameliorated propane dehydrogenation performance regarding activity, selectivity and resilience versus monometallic Pt configurations. Incorporating Sn assists suppressing hydrogenolysis and coke accumulation, thereby boosting selectivity[64,65]. Pt-Ga constitutes highly resilient intermetallic amalgams, resisting sintering and coking over prolonged reaction durations [68]. Alloying Pt with Zn enables tailoring ensemble dimensions and electronic structure to attain optimal sites for C-H activation whilst circumventing overbinding C3 entities [69].   	
Pivotal structural traits influencing propane dehydrogenation performance have been pinpointed. Subnanometric PtSn clusters in MFI zeolite conduits deliver 10-fold superior activity relative to PtSn nanoparticles, attributed to optimized Pt-Sn affiliations[64]. Segregated Pt atoms stabilized by Zn complexes in the framework of dealuminated Beta zeolite achieve remarkable resilience and near-equilibrium conversion [69]. PtZn intermetallic nanoparticles in mesostructured MFI nanosheets overcome diffusion limitations to attain elevated productivity[67]. 
The suitable Sn/Pt ratio has also been delineated for optimal dehydrogenation activity and propylene selectivity. For PtSn clusters on alumina, Pt/Sn ~ 3 conferred moderate turnover frequencies; comparable Pt/Sn ratios were deemed inert[66]. Elevating Sn/Pt from 0 to 1.5 boosted propane conversion over PtSn/Al2O3 preceding detriments from excess Sn[72]. These trends affirm computationally predicted volcano-type dependence of rate on Sn content [73].  
Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: The accumulated discernments on bimetallic Pt catalysts accentuate promising architectural paradigms that could stimulate further advancements. Constituting isolated single-sites in zeolites, deliberate selection of secondary metals, compartmentalizing ultrasmall nanoclusters and interface engineering with unconventional adjuvants each tender adaptable modules to persist optimizing propane dehydrogenation arrangements. Additionally, operando spectroscopies[71] and multi-scale renderings may facilitate elemental comprehension to inform rational catalyst formulation targeting industrially-relevant process intensification. More expansive deployment of high-throughput experimentation and data-driven tactics can also expedite identifying unprecedented compositions and metastable phases with bespoke functionalities.  

Bimetallic and Alloy Catalysts - Electronic and Geometric Effects of Secondary Metals
Wang et al.[64] exhibited larger Pt nanoparticles can incorporate more Sn entities to constitute PtSn alloy nanoparticles, while smaller Pt clusters tend towards Pt-rich compositions with limited Sn assimilation. These insights could be extended to additional Pt-anchored bimetallic catalysts, although the secondary metal election (e.g. Cu, In, Zn or Ga instead of Sn) may affect optimal Pt site dimensions [64]. 
The publication by Zope et al. [66] probes electronic and geometric influences of Sn as a secondary metal in bolstered PtSn bimetallic clusters. It demonstrates Sn constructs robust bonds with Al2O3 support oxygens at the cluster-support interface. Sn also manifests a stabilization effect on the Pt clusters[66]. 
The manuscript by Meng et al. [54] scrutinizes both electronic and geometric impacts of phosphorus addition in Ru-P bimetallic catalysts. Escalating P content is exhibited to diminish Ru ensemble magnitude, decreasing the hydrogenolysis rate (geometric effect). Ru-P bond archetype formation also shifts Ru XPS and XANES spectra to elevated energies, alluding to reduced Ru 4d orbital energies enfeebling metal-adsorbate affiliations (electronic effect) [54].
The publication by Zhao et al.[74] examines electronic and geometric ramifications of assimilating Ti and Nb as secondary metals in Pt-Ti and Pt-Nb bimetallic catalysts synthesized via reactive metal support interactions with MXene adjuvants. It evinces tailored intermetallic nanoparticles become conceivable that are unachievable with conventional oxide or carbide supports. The distinct MXene compositions enabled tuning of catalytic properties and performance [74].
The manuscript by Xie et al.[75] probes electronic effects of the secondary metal Ga in GaPt bimetallic catalysts harnessing XPS and IR documentation. The data insinuates electron donation from Ga culminating in elevated electron density on Pt sites owed to GaPt amalgam formation, thereby enhancing catalytic performance[75]. 

Bimetallic and Alloy Catalysts - Optimization of Selectivity through Subsurface Tuning
The presented references revealed none of the scrutinized manuscripts explored assimilating subsurface promoters like Re or Mn in bimetallic and alloy catalysts for tuning propane dehydrogenation selectivity. No tangible instances or documentation were furnished across the manifold surveyed studies[12,16,18,34,54,64-67,69,70,74-89].  
Nonetheless, one publication[90] dissected harnessing subsurface Mn promotion in Pt3Mn bimetallic catalysts for propane dehydrogenation. The subsurface Mn constituent markedly upgraded selectivity over Pt catalysts alone by regulating surface chemistry and adsorption attributes. Kinetic archetypes were also formulated to explicate the distinct subsurface laminations in modifying selectivity. Ultimately, this highlights the promise of tuning subsurface promoters and compositions to optimize catalytic performance.  

Bimetallic and Alloy Catalysts - Synergistic Effects in Metal Alloys: Ensemble and Ligand Effects
The presented literature[54,57,81,83,91,92] revealed select examples showcasing synergistic effects between metals in bimetallic propane dehydrogenation catalysts, credited to ensemble and ligand impacts:
Explicitly, Ru-P catalysts exhibited reduced Ru ensemble magnitudes and isolated Ru atoms from escalating P assimilation, which attenuated the hydrogenolysis rate [54]. PtIn2 nanoparticles displayed the maximum perturbation in Pt XANES energy and geometric transitions, culminating in superior activity and resilience[81]. Subnanometric Pt-Sn clusters in zeolites possessed distinct geometric and electronic configurations relative to Pt-Sn nanoparticles, eliciting unique reactivity[83]. 
Broadly, adjoining a secondary metal can physically disrupt substantial ensembles on Pt accountable for side-reactions while modifying the electronic ambience to promote preferred product desorption [91,92]. For instance, alloying Pt with Zn sequesters Pt sites and reshapes selectivity [92], while Sn addition regulates Pt electron density [91].

Zeolites and Mesoporous Supports - Promising Zeolite Topologies in Catalyst Support
A meticulous literature analysis[9,57,61,64,69,79,91,93,94] revealed several zeolite architectures demonstrating propitious credentials as propane dehydrogenation catalyst supports encompassing MFI, BEA and FER topologies:  
MFI Zeolite
The purely siliceous MFI zeolite designated silicalite-1 constitutes an optimal backbone for anchoring exceptionally dispersed subnanometric PtSn clusters within the sinusoidal 10R conduits, eliciting outstanding PDH credentials with 45.3% propane conversion and 99% propylene selectivity[91]. Its hierarchical micro-/mesoporous surrogate empowers PtLa intermetallic nanoparticles to exhibit elevated initial activity (~40% conversion) alongside exceptional 30-day resilience with <10% deactivation [93]. Ferrosilicalite-1 (Fe-S-1-n) stabilizes isolated Pt atoms bonded to Si-O-Fe loci, elevating selectivity[79]. Mesoporous MFI nanosheets strongly anchor PtZn alloys, imparting remarkable durability [57].  
BEA Zeolite
Tin-augmented zeolite Beta (Sn-Beta) efficiently localizes isolated Pt atoms inside Zn nests within dealuminated BEA pores. The ensuing single sites catalyze PDH with 90% propylene selectivity adjoining equilibrium conversion [69]. Pt stabilized on segregated Sn positions in the Beta framework also exhibits excellent catalytic performance [94]. The BEA topology instills a confinement effect augmenting PtSn particle dispersion [64].  
Other Zeolites  
Chabazite zeolite (CHA) sequesters extra-framework Ga+ active sites to accomplish 96% propylene selectivity, although with gradual deactivation over time[9]. Titanosilicate TS-1 retains weaker acid locales, refining propane conversion and catalyst longevity [61].
In summation, MFI and BEA zeolites have exhibited particular potential as PDH catalyst supports owing to merits like robust metal confinement, acid site segregation and hierarchical porosity. However, opportunities persist to explore emerging zeolite and mesoporous scaffolds to additionally advance catalytic performance.

Zeolites and Mesoporous Supports - Impact of Si/Al Ratio and Mesoporosity on Catalyst Performance
Select studies evaluated the impacts of tuning silicon/aluminum ratios and augmenting mesoporosity in zeolitic PDH catalyst adjuvants:  
The manuscript with DOI [9] gauges propane dehydrogenation over CHA zeolites with varying Si/Al proportions of 5, 12 and 25. It demonstrates extra-framework Ga+ sites manifest irrespective of Si/Al ratio. While reaction kinetics decay over time, propylene selectivity persists at 96% upon aptly configuring the Ga/Al ratio.		
Moreover, the research articulated in  [61] investigates modulating TS-1 crystal dimensions from 100 nm to 5.7 μm. Inferior dimensions introduce mesoporosity, refining diffusion and averting coking. This substantially augments conversion, selectivity and catalyst longevity.
Additionally, the publication with DOI[57] probes mesoporous MFI zeolites. The mesoporous morphology alongside abundant silanol moieties facilitate intermetallic alloy nanoparticle accretion.  

Zeolites and Mesoporous Supports - Techniques for Synthesizing Isolated Single Sites in Zeolites
A meticulous literature interrogation[9,18,46,49,85,95,96] revealed select techniques enabling isolated single metal site synthesis in zeolitic scaffolds for propane dehydrogenation catalysts:  
Dealuminating zeolites like beta or ZSM-5 spawns vacant lattice locales and hydroxyl nests capable of localizing isolated metal species. The study [18] discusses dealuminating zeolite beta with nitric acid, thereafter stabilizing single cobalt sites within the formed hydroxyl nests. Analogously, atomically dispersed platinum fastened to silanol moieties in dealuminated BEA zeolite displays activity and resilience for PDH[49]. 
Direct hydrothermal zeolite fabrication with metal-ligand precursors enables constructing isolated metal sites into the superstructure. [85] exemplifies capturing zinc cations coordinated to ethylenediamine inside micropores of silicalite-1. Additives like Cu boost the accretion of exclusively isolated zinc sites in S-1, validated via EXAFS[95]. 
High-temperature hydrogen reduction converts entities like zinc methyl and zinc hydroxide in ZSM-5 pores into isolated Zn^2+ fastened at cation loci[96]. Ga-CHA necessitates 700°C reduction to configure tetrahedrally coordinated, single Ga+ sites reactive for alkane activation [9].  
Sophisticated microscopy and spectroscopy techniques unambiguously affirm isolated metal site structure. Scanning transmission electron microscopy elucidates the positioning of single platinum atoms tethered to framework germanium in dealuminated UTL zeolite[46]. X-ray absorption fine structure spectra in[95] corroborates Cu supplementation constructs exclusively isolated zinc sites in S-1.  

Zeolites and Mesoporous Supports - Enhancing Stability through Metal Encapsulation in Zeolites
The scrutinized publications[6,39,46,97,98] demonstrated zeolites and mesoporous substances harboring promise as scaffolds for localizing metal species to augment propane dehydrogenation catalyst resilience.
Several pivotal instances prove strategic confinement of platinum clusters or encapsulating sub-nanometric bimetallics inside zeolite conduits and chambers forestalls agglomeration and sintering at high PDH temperatures or during regeneration: 
- Cobalt species tethered on BEA-type zeolites exhibited no deactivation over 8 reaction-regeneration PDH cycles, enabled by the confinement effect stabilizing metal clusters[39].
- Platinum anchored on germanium loci in UTL-type zeolites maintained exceptional stability for over 4000 hours of PDH, credited to Pt-O-Ge bonding affiliations localizing platinum[46].  
- Sub-nanometric PtSn entities regioselectively emplaced inside MFI-type zeolites preserved cycle resilience for at least 3 PDH cycles sans variations in cluster dimensions or deactivation[98].  
- Confining platinum inside MCM-22 zeolite micropores hindered agglomeration post extreme oxidation-reduction processing at 650°C. The encapsulated catalyst retained 90% initial PDH activity after 5 cycles while a conventional impregnated catalyst forfeited over 40% [97].  
In summation, strategic zeolite encapsulation ploys manifest as a propitious tactic for upgrading metal dispersion and reinforcement for sustained PDH operation. Fastening guest metals on zeolite sites or containment inside micropores impedes sintering thus maintaining active sites and initial activity over recurrent deployment. Additional developments in zeolite composites and mesoporous superstructures may unlock supplementary prospects for next-generation encapsulation techniques.  

Catalyst Synthesis and Characterization - Optimizing Active Phase Dispersion through Preparation Methods
A meticulous literature review[9,18,39,62,73,77,95,99-102] revealed numerous studies developing advanced catalyst preparation tactics aiming to optimize active phase dispersion for superior propane dehydrogenation credentials: Methods like vacuum impregnation[39] and assimilating metals during zeolite hydrothermal fabrication[102] can refine dispersion by configuring interactions with the support. Dealuminated zeolites and ordered mesoporous substances furnish open frameworks and high surface areas to disperse and reinforce isolated sites [62,101]. Surface organometallic chemistry enables precisely engrafting metals onto supports via robust metal-oxygen-support bonds [18]. Other ploys encompass colloidal [73] and dendrimer-encapsulated nanoparticle synthesis[100], atomic layer deposition [99] and stabilization in microporous zeolites[77].  
In situ spectroscopy approaches like XAFS, XPS, IR and DRIFTS have elucidated alterations in metal speciation during preparation like impregnation [9,95], thus enabling parameter optimization impacting dispersion. Characterization avenues like HAADF-STEM imaging affirm isolation and morphology of active sites.  
Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: The scrutinized works evidence appreciable progress in synthesizing propane dehydrogenation catalysts with uniform and thermally resilient active phases, encompassing isolated metal site stabilization, bimetallic amalgam crafting and ultrafine cluster containment – enabled by emergent characterization tools imparting atomic-scale precision. 
Future horizons may assimilate these upgrades with other burgeoning techniques like additive manufacturing to architect bespoke dehydrogenation catalysts for process intensification and modularization.

Catalyst Synthesis and Characterization - Insights from In-Situ Techniques in Active Catalysts
A meticulous literature analysis[95,100,103-107] revealed in-situ techniques furnishing perspectives into functional propane dehydrogenation catalysts:
One publication harnesses in-situ DRIFTS and temperature programmed desorption with MS detection to probe propylene adsorption modalities on cobalt catalysts, unveiling silicon modification influences on propylene interaction[103]. Another alliance of quantitative in-situ FTIR and pulse titration experiments determines identity and density of reactive gallium species in Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts during propane dehydrogenation [104]. Synchrotron-based in-situ XAS at the Zn K-edge distinguishes binuclear ZnOx species on silicalite-1 from 3D ZnOx clusters materializing in-situ on dealuminated Beta during reaction[105]. In-situ Raman spectroscopy and online MS enables identification of a VOx-C3H5 transient species and ascertaining rate-limiting H2 accrual over VOx/HMS catalysts[106].  
Other instances harness combined in-situ UV-Vis/Raman spectroscopy with XANES and EXAFS to correlate chromium oxidation state variations with propane dehydrogenation activity and deactivation kinetics[100]. In-situ FTIR exposes transformation of inactive zinc hydroxide motifs into reactive zinc hydride sites during propane dehydrogenation induction periods over ZnO/SBA-15[95]. And an examination alloying GC analytics with in-situ XRD and DRIFTS elucidates fluctuations in product distribution, vanadium oxide phase transitions, and surface transient species during time-on-stream experiments [107].  
The multiplicity of in-situ methodologies provides granular insights into functional catalysts encompassing bulk to surface and even pinpointing precise active sites in select instances. Developments in characterization capabilities now enable tracking catalyst structural dynamics from the molecular tier upwards. While most studies have accentuated simpler lab systems, assimilating these operando avenues for online monitoring in industrial reactors could facilitate superior process control and mechanistic-driven optimization.

By appraising both terrace and edge orientations, over 2000 catalyst candidates were gauged. This high-throughput computational screening pinpointed inexpensive and eco-friendly Fe-Ga intermetallics as encouraging PDH catalysts. Additional academic contributions have initiated exploiting machine learning for accelerating screening and architectural motifs of metallic heterogeneous catalysts. With inventories of computed descriptors persisting to proliferate, data-driven tactics can efficiently traverse extensive materials domains[117] . Additional expansion of this framework to trimetallic amalgams may unravel even more active and selective PDH catalysts.   
Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: The examined advancements in high-throughput computational catalyst screening are poised to metamorphose propane dehydrogenation pursuits. Expeditious appraisals of thousands of candidates harnessing descriptors and machine learning archetypes can orient experimental validation towards the most encouraging catalyst formulations. Progressing forward, integration of multi-fidelity models, uncertainty quantification and autonomous experimentation into computational workflows could further augment the velocity and dependability of revelations.
