1. Introduction - The context and significance of CO2 reduction reaction and technological barriers deterring viability and scalability

	Based on the in-depth details extracted from the file, the context and significance of CO2 reduction reaction is to convert CO2 into value-added chemicals and fuels using renewable electricity. This provides a promising technology to mitigate climate change caused by excessive CO2 emissions from fossil fuel use, while also enabling renewable energy storage and sustainable chemical production. 
	However, there are several key technological barriers deterring the viability and scalability of this approach:
	1) High activation energy barriers and slow kinetics resulting from the inherent stability of the CO2 molecule, necessitating substantial energy input [10.1021/acscatal.0c00297]. This manifests as high overpotentials and limits efficiency [10.1038/s41467-023-41871-w].
	2) Competing side reactions like the Hydrogen Evolution Reaction, especially in aqueous electrolytes, that reduce selectivity towards desired carbon products [10.1021/acs.jpcc.9b08359].
	3) Low selectivity and yield of key value-added C2+/C3+ fuels and chemical products. C1 products like CO, formate and methane dominate [10.1038/s41467-023-41871-w].
	4) Rapid deactivation of catalysts over prolonged operation [10.1002/anie.201707478].
	5) Difficulty translation high performing catalysts developed at lab scale into commercially viable and scalable systems [10.1021/acscatal.0c00297].
	Rational design of optimized catalysts through approaches like computational screening [10.1039/d2ta02749f], crystal facet engineering [10.1039/c6ta10733h] and strain effects [10.1039/d0ta03099f] can help overcome these barriers by stabilizing key intermediates and lowering transition state energies [10.1038/s41467-023-38524-3]. However, further research centered on catalyst discovery is essential before CO2 reduction technologies can effectively scale to mitigate global CO2 emissions.
	※※※
	Taking into consideration the advancements and findings discussed in the file, there lies an opportunity to explore several emerging possibilities. Firstly, while copper-based catalysts have shown unique selectivity for C2+ products, expanded exploration into novel single atom catalysts [10.1021/acscatal.1c02319] and transition metal heterostructures [10.1021/acs.jpcc.1c03330] is warranted to discover enhanced selectivity paradigms. Secondly, operando spectroscopic techniques combined with electrochemical flow reactors could illuminate unseen transient intermediates [10.1021/jacs.2c01044] and clarify mechanistic gaps in knowledge, especially related to carbon-carbon coupling. Finally, techno-economic assessments incorporating metrics like current density, longevity, material costs etc. into optimized figure of merits may reveal unforeseen directions where research endeavors could align more suitably with commercialization and societal CO2 mitigation outlooks.

2. Effects of Catalyst Morphology and Catalyst Design Principles - Computational screening

	Based on the in-depth details extracted from the file related to 'Effects of Catalyst Morphology and Catalyst Design Principles - Computational screening', here is a comprehensive review section on CO2 Reduction Reaction, emphasizing 'Effects of Catalyst Morphology and Catalyst Design Principles - Computational screening':
	The active site that plays a key role in the CO2 reduction reaction is identified across several studies to be copper, specifically copper surfaces and interfaces [10.1021/acscatal.9b01899, 10.1016/j.apcatb.2021.120128]. Copper's unique moderate binding strength towards the critical *CO reaction intermediate facilitates further reduction to value-added C1 and C2 hydrocarbons and oxygenates while avoiding catalyst poisoning [10.1021/acscatal.6b01393, 10.1021/acscatal.9b04746]. Morphological tuning of the copper catalyst through nanoparticle size, shape, high-index facets, edges, corners, and defects creates sites that stabilize this *CO intermediate and subsequent carbon-carbon (C-C) coupling transition states to boost selectivity towards C2+ products [10.1039/d2ta07469a, 10.1038/s41467-020-20615-0]. Introducing a secondary metal through strategic alloying with Cu also modulates intermediate binding energies and electronic properties to further improve activity and C2+ selectivity [10.1021/acs.jpcc.7b02228, 10.1038/s41467-023-35960-z].
	Several computational screening studies have elucidated these structure-performance relationships to predictively identify active sites, compositions, and morphologies [10.1039/d2ta00950a, 10.1039/c7sc03422a]. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations systematically assess adsorption energies of key intermediates like *COOH, *CO, *OCCOH across hundreds of potential transition metal catalysts and alloys [10.1039/d0ta03099f, 10.1021/cs501600x]. This extensive database screens for optimal binding energies associated with high intrinsic activity and C2+ selectivity. Binding energy descriptors further enable ML models to efficiently navigate vast chemical spaces of bimetallic combinations [10.1021/acs.jpcc.2c02161]. Beyond DFT, global optimization searches couple with Basin Hopping and molecular dynamics leverage more realistic nanoparticle models with grain boundaries, strain effects, and solvent interactions [10.1038/s41467-020-20615-0]. Such authentic structure simulations offer vital insights connecting surface sites to targeted CO2 reduction products like ethylene and ethanol. Overall these predictive computational methodologies accelerate identification of selective and stable catalyst designs from among exponentially vast options.
	While computational guidance has uncovered several promising CO2 reduction catalysts, additional research into unexplored compositions and morphologies may uncover transformative single or dual site catalysts matching bioinspired catalytic motifs [10.1021/jacs.2c13253]. Exploring such innovative catalyst paradigms through reliable yet rapid computational screening represents an impactful direction that builds on recent advances in catalyst databases, heuristics, and multiscale modeling. Advancing predictive catalyst discovery platforms even further would accelerate the deployment of selective and scalable CO2 electrolyzer and photoreactor technologies.
	※※※
	Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: Taking into consideration the advancements and findings discussed in the file, there lies an opportunity to explore emerging fields and innovative methodologies. Future research endeavors might focus on:
	1) Incorporating quantum chemical simulations and nonequilibrium Green’s function theory into high-throughput computational catalyst screening to capture critical dynamic effects influencing activity and selectivity. This would improve reliability over typically limited equilibrium DFT approximations. 
	2) Multiscale modeling coupling electronic structure calculations with microkinetics as well as process/device models to holistically connect intrinsic catalytic functionality all the way to practical reactor performance metrics and technoeconomic assessment at scale.  
	3) Interfacing high-throughput theory with robotic accelerated closed loop screening to rapidly validate predictions and continuously improve in silico catalyst descriptors and predictive models via on-line learning.
	4) Leveraging generative AI approaches like deep graph networks that can efficiently learn patterns among network Representations of materials to autonomously construct optimized catalyst compositions and configurations rather than purely screening existing or human conceived options.  
	Such pioneering research directions grounded in the insights from current literature would significantly advance CO2 reduction technologies and broadly catalyze transformative materials discovery capabilities. The field stands at the cusp of a new era of accelerated, automated and autonomous catalyst innovationETAhAnna, which could disruptively tackle global challenges like CO2 utilization, clean fuels/chemicals, and sustainability.

3. Effects of Catalyst Morphology and Catalyst Design Principles - What is the active site of the catalyst in this article, and what is the catalyst atom that plays a key role?

	The facets, morphology, edges, corners, and defects of copper-based catalysts profoundly influence CO2 binding modes, activation energies, and product selectivity, as substantiated by references [10.1002/anie.202103102], [10.1021/acscatal.7b01416]. By stabilizing key reaction intermediates like *CO and *OCCOH, high-index facets ([10.1039/c8ta04758h]), grain boundaries ([10.1021/ja3010978]), under-coordinated sites ([10.1021/acscatal.5b02083]), and tailored defects ([10.1038/s41467-020-16998-9]) lower the reaction barriers and direct selectivity toward C2+ products. Conversely, close-packed, smooth Cu terraces promote competitive hydrogen evolution ([10.1021/cs502128q]) or C1 products like methane ([10.1038/ncomms15438]). Strategic catalyst design holistically integrating nano structuring, facet engineering, judicious defects introduction, and secondary metal incorporation realizes optimized CO2 binding while impeding hydrogen binding ([10.1021/jacs.3c02130]), propelling an augmented yield of value-added chemicals.
	※※※
	Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: Current research has extensively mapped out structure-performance interdependencies in CO2 electrocatalysis. Building on these fundamentals, future efforts might shift toward scaling up controlled nanostructure synthesis and stabilizing morphologies against reconstruction. Operando probes would unveil dynamic reconfigurations and indicate routes for improved resilience. Multiscale modeling may capture complexity at realistic interfaces and streamline systematic improvements. Beyond copper, expanding materials space could uncover new windows of opportunity. And interfacing electrolyzers with renewable resources and value chains would actualize sustainability visions undergirding this vibrant research realm.

4. Effects of Catalyst Morphology and Catalyst Design Principles - Influence of facets, morphology, edges, corners, defects on CO2 binding modes and activation

	Based on the detailed analysis of the literature sources provided, most of the articles do not specifically discuss the influence of facets, morphology, edges, corners, or defects on CO2 binding modes and activation on the copper nanoparticle catalysts studied for CO2 reduction applications [10.1002/anie.201601582, 10.1021/acscatal.9b00896, 10.1021/acscatal.9b04217]. 
	However, a few selected sources offer some insights into how tuning the size, shape, oxidation state, and surface features of the nanoparticles can impact catalytic performance by altering CO2 adsorption modes, binding of key intermediates like *CO, and activation barriers [10.1038/s41467-018-05544-3, 10.1021/acscatal.7b01416, 10.1021/jacs.1c09508]. For example, computational and experimental results indicate that undercoordinated edge and corner sites on copper nanocrystals, compared to terrace sites, bind *CO more strongly and increase dimerization barriers - enabling higher selectivity towards C2+ products [10.1021/cs500537y, 10.1021/acscatal.9b00790]. Defect-rich morphologies produced through techniques like electrochemical activation also demonstrate improved C2 selectivity by stabilizing reaction intermediates [10.1021/jacs.1c03443]. And smaller sized nanoparticles below 2-3 nm show significantly different selectivity trends compared to larger nanoparticles, attributed to the higher density of low-coordination sites [10.1021/ja500328k]. 
	※※※
	Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: The analysis of these findings reveals promising opportunities to advance CO2 reduction performance through knowledge-guided design of nanostructured copper catalysts. Future efforts could focus on controlled synthesis of optimized shapes and sizes - leveraging high-index facets, roughness, porosity - while dynamically modulating oxidation states. Operando characterization techniques and multi-scale simulations would provide fundamental insights connecting morphology factors to binding configurations, intermediates and pathways. And machine learning models trained on such data could accelerate identification of nanoparticle architectures balancing activity, selectivity and stability. Advancing these interconnected facets of catalyst optimization and mechanistic elucidation is key to unlocking the immense potential of CO2 valorization.

5. Effects of Catalyst Morphology and Catalyst Design Principles - Tuning nanoparticle size, morphology, oxidation state

	Based on the in-depth details extracted from the file, here is a comprehensive review section on CO2 Reduction Reaction, emphasizing 'Effects of Catalyst Morphology and Catalyst Design Principles - Tuning nanoparticle size, morphology, oxidation state':
	Several articles demonstrate navigating selectivity in CO2 reduction by tuning nanoparticle size, morphology, and oxidation state to alter binding and stability of key intermediates like *CO, *COOH, and *OCCOH [10.1021/acs.jpclett.2c01010, 10.1021/jacs.2c01044]. By controlling size in the 25-50 nm range, an optimal balance is achieved between activity, stability, and C2 vs C1 selectivity [10.1021/acs.jpcc.9b08931]. Below 15 nm, HER is favored while above 50 nm, mass activity declines with higher methane selectivity. Morphology also plays a key role - Cu(100) facets preferentially bind *COH for ethylene production while Cu(111) facets favor methane [10.1002/anie.201601582, 10.1039/d3sc02647g]. Rough, high-curvature surfaces created through approaches like anodic oxidation alter local CO2 concentration and intermediate retention time, boosting C2 species [10.1021/acscatal.7b01548, 10.1002/anie.201910155]. Mixed Cu+/Cu0 oxidation states, stabilized through Cu2O reduction, surface halide formation, or redox potential modulation, balance binding of intermediates like *COOH vs *OCHO to promote selective pathways [10.1021/acs.jpclett.1c00588, 10.1039/d1ta11089f, 10.1021/acscatal.1c05431]. Overall, progress has been made towards elucidating design principles, but more systematic optimization across broader operating landscapes is still needed.
	※※※
	Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: The gathered insights highlight promising inroads towards deliberately engineering nanoparticle catalysts to direct selectivity by tuning the stability of intermediates governing competing reaction cascades. However, ubiquitous scaling relationships and complex synergies between factors like size, shape, oxidation state pose optimization barriers, especially for intensified continuous processes. Data-centric approaches leveraging high-throughput experiments, multimodal in situ characterization, and machine learning could accelerate identification of selective compositions and morphologies over wider processing envelopes. Capitalizing on modularity and reconfigurability, novel structured catalysts integrating selective nanoscale features with mass transfer enhancements may stretch the limits of selectivity and productivity simultaneously. Ultimately, translating fundamental advances will require holistic techno-economic factoring of selectivity seeking designs within realistic process contexts.

6. Effects of Catalyst Morphology and Catalyst Design Principles - Navigating Selectivity through Nanostructuring to Alter Binding and Stability of Key Intermediates

	Based on the in-depth details extracted from the file, here is a comprehensive review section on CO2 Reduction Reaction, emphasizing 'Effects of Catalyst Morphology and Catalyst Design Principles - Navigating Selectivity through Nanostructuring to Alter Binding and Stability of Key Intermediates':
	Nanostructuring copper catalysts through approaches like introducing defects, grain boundaries, alloying, and strain engineering can effectively alter the binding modes, stability and confinement of key CO2 reduction intermediates like *CO, *OCCOH, and *CHxO. This allows navigating selectivity between different C1, C2, C2+ value-added products [10.1038/s41467-019-11599-7]. Smaller Cu nanoclusters and increased crystal defects stabilize the *CO intermediate, promoting C-C coupling towards C2H4 [10.1021/cs500537y]. Computational modeling reveals CuCu alloy sites assist *OCCOH coupling, the precursor to C2 products [10.1021/acs.jpcc.1c00297]. Stabilizing ethoxy intermediates with optimized Cu coordination guides selectivity between C2H6 and C2H5OH [10.1002/anie.202004846].
	Strategies like subsurface alloying and single atom doping alter ensemble effects and the local chemical environment. Isolated interfaces exhibit unique binding configurations for critical intermediates. Hybrid sites stabilize *CO while destabilizing *H, improving CO selectivity and avoiding wasteful H2 evolution [10.1038/s41467-023-35960-z]. Breaking linear scaling relations between competing intermediates allows bifurcating pathways [10.1039/c8ta05355c].
	Nanoconfinement effects are also crucial. Convex cavities adapt to bind intermediates, preventing escape from active sites [10.1039/d1ta08889k]. Hollow and dendritic morphologies increase local intermediate concentrations by orders of magnitude, accelerating subsequent C-C couplings [10.1021/jacs.0c01699]. Optimized facet ratios balance C1 and C2 selectivity [10.1021/acscatal.9b03664]. 
	Advanced characterization techniques like Raman spectroscopy confirm signatures of critical reaction intermediates coordinated on specific sites arising from tailored nanostructures [10.1021/acscatal.7b02234]. Isotopic labeling coupled with simulations map out full reaction networks and selectivity-determining steps accessible through careful morphological tuning [10.1021/jacs.9b02124].
	※※※
	Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: The rich array of modulation strategies available through nanostructuring opens up extensive possibilities. However realizing their potential requires tackling challenges in reproducibility and catalyst stability over long-term use. Operando characterization techniques that probe dynamic structural transformations under working conditions will shed light on degradation mechanisms [10.1021/jacsau.1c00562]. Machine learning can accelerate screening of vast compositional and morphological possibilities [10.1039/d1ta09184k]. Future explorations might focus on translating insights from well-defined model systems to scalable nanoporous architectures compatible with continuous flow reactors [10.1039/d0sc05990k].

7. Effects of Catalyst Morphology and Catalyst Design Principles - Modulation via alloying, strain, ensemble effects and Modelling morphology control

	Effects of Catalyst Morphology and Catalyst Design Principles - Modulation via alloying, strain, ensemble effects and Modelling morphology control:
	The literature demonstrates modulation of the catalyst via Cu-Sn alloying. This tuning of composition leads to faster reaction kinetics, improved selectivity towards formate over other products like CH4 and C2H4, higher local electric field to enhance CO2 adsorption, and optimized binding strength of key CO2* intermediate. Overall, the synergic effects imparted by alloying Cu and Sn together enable highly efficient and selective CO2-to-formate conversion. [10.1016/j.apcatb.2021.120119]

	By alloying copper with silver, the total C2 production remains similar but selectivity switches from ethylene to ethanol. This demonstrates that silver disrupts the coordination environment to destabilize ethylene intermediates while directing current toward the ethanol pathway instead. The computational and experimental results confirm that binding site diversity via alloying modulates selectivity through altering stability of key intermediates. [10.1021/jacs.9b02945] 
	Further evidence is provided where alloying and strain effects enable modulating selectivity. Mismatch between larger Ag and Cu atoms strains and expands the Cu lattice. This ensemble effect tuning promotes key intermediate adsorption and conversion to hydrocarbons over solely CO production. [10.1021/acs.jpcc.7b01586]
	The literature also discusses modulation via alloying under supersaturated CO2 conditions during electrodeposition. This leads to preferential formation of a CuAg alloy with exposed (100) facets that are active for CO2 reduction. [10.1038/s41929-023-00938-z]
	※※※
	Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: There is strong evidence demonstrating the capability to effectively modulate catalyst design parameters like composition, strain, and coordination environment in order to deliberately tune selectivity and break scaling relations. Advances in operando characterization and modelling will further strengthen establishment of predictive catalyst-structure-function guidelines. An integrative approach should focus on strategically modulating multiple handles simultaneously in order to unlock combined synergies. For instance, alloying to induce strain while also altering local binding configurations. New frontiers also lie in extending modulation techniques to enable selective breaking and making of C-H, C-C, and C-O bonds in more complex and selective chemical production directly from CO2.

8. Elucidating Reaction Pathways - Proposed mechanistic pathways for C1 and C2+ products and how to confirm reaction mechanisms

	Among transition metals, copper (Cu) stands unparalleled in its exceptional capability to reduce CO2 to valuable C1 and C2+ hydrocarbons and oxygenates [10.1021/acs.jpcc.1c01586, 10.1021/acscatal.9b05319]. Research over decades has unravelled intricate mechanistic pathways underlying this selectivity [10.1038/s41467-023-35912-7]. Initial protonation of adsorbed CO2 leads to key *COOH intermediate, confirmed by computational Cu-C distances of 1.95 Å [10.1039/d1ta08889k]. Subsequent reduction gives rise to *CO intermediate, strongly validated by Cu-C distance of 2.23 Å [10.1039/d1ta08889k] and extensive spectroscopic characterization [10.1021/acscatal.1c04805].	
	※※※
	C1 Pathway: *CO undergoes potential-determining hydrogenation to *COH [10.1021/acs.jpcc.1c01586], later reduced through *CHO [10.1002/anie.202306822], *CH2O, *OCH3 [10.1021/acscatal.1c04805] intermediates to terminate in CH4 [10.1039/d1ta08889k]. 		
	C2 Pathway: Begins with *CO dimerization [10.1021/acs.jpclett.5b01559, 10.1021/acscatal.0c01880] or coupling with *CHO [10.1021/jacs.9b02945]. Subsequent hydrogenation via *OCCOH [10.1021/jacs.2c01044], *OCHCHO [10.1038/s41467-022-29428-9], *CHCO [10.1021/acscatal.9b05319] gives C2H4 or C2H5OH. CXOY configuration of intermediates and their stabilization on catalyst surface plays a pivotal role [10.1002/anie.202309625].		
	Strategies like pH tuning [10.1021/acs.jpclett.5b01559], electrolyte variation [10.1021/jp400937e], defect engineering [10.1038/s41467-023-39351-2, 10.1021/jacs.2c01044], ligand [10.1002/anie.202105343] and interface modifications [10.1021/acscatal.0c03846] offer handles for selectivity control. More expansive search criterions, multivariate descriptors [10.1038/s41467-019-13833-8], as well as synergistic multi-component systems [10.1016/j.cej.2022.138009] hold promise to further push the frontiers.

9. Elucidating Reaction Pathways - The relationship between the selectivity of key products such as CH4, CHOOH, C2H4, C2H5OH and the detailed values of adsorption energies of key substances are given separately.The evidence and mechanism are also given in detail one by one.

	Based on the in-depth details extracted from the file, there is no clear evidence elucidating definitive relationships between the selectivity of key CO2 reduction products such as CH4, CHOOH, C2H4, and C2H5OH and the detailed values of adsorption energies of key intermediates. 
	Several papers discuss qualitative trends, such as how binding energies outside optimal range can limit selectivity by either overstabilizing intermediates or failing to adsorb them sufficiently ([10.1021/jp400937e], [10.1021/acs.jpcc.8b09598]). Others relate improved C2+ production to stabilization of key intermediates like *OCCOH through neighboring sites or defects ([10.1038/s41467-022-29428-9], [10.1039/d3ta01607b]).
	However, clear quantitative relationships backed by mechanistic evidence and calculations are sparse. One study correlates selectivity for CH4 vs C2H4 with free energy barriers for respective rate limiting steps on different catalysts ([10.1002/anie.202105343]). Another shows selectivity trends matching differences in competitive transition states ([10.1002/anie.201910662]). But most focus on evaluating overall catalytic performance rather than detailed mechanistic explanations.
	※※※
	Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: 
	The scant availability of quantified selectivity-adsorption energy relationships indicates an opportunity to expand computational studies probing underlying descriptors and maps to directly guide design. More extensive DFT models should aim to delineate exact volcano plots relating binding of key intermediates like *CO, *OCCOH to selectivity targets. Mechanism-driven models clarifying pathway bifurcations can offer structure-activity insights to strategize modulation of local adsorption environments. 
	Approaches coupling quantified models with controlled in-situ validation studies via operando spectroscopy under industrially relevant conditions could accelerate descriptor optimization. Interfacing multi-scale computations with high-throughput assessments may swiftly yield enhanced single-atom and heterogeneous catalysts. Ultimately, progress lies in transcending empirical observations to forge intentional, predictable strategies for selectivity control grounded in mechanistic comprehension.

10. Elucidating Reaction Pathways - Computational studies revealing energies of transition states and reaction barriers

	Based on the in-depth details extracted from the file, here is a comprehensive review section on CO2 Reduction Reaction, emphasizing 'Elucidating Reaction Pathways - Computational studies revealing energies of transition states and reaction barriers':
	The computational studies utilizing density functional theory (DFT) calculations have provided invaluable insights into elucidating the mechanistic pathways and intermediates involved in CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) over different catalysts by revealing energies of key transition states and reaction barriers [10.1021/acs.jpcc.8b12449, 10.1021/jacs.7b05591]. Specifically, the methods like climbing image nudged elastic band (CI-NEB) and quantum-based constrained molecular dynamics have enabled mapping out complete free energy profiles, locating transition states, and identifying potential-determining steps [10.1021/acs.jpca.2c03560, 10.1021/acscatal.7b03308].  
	For C1 pathway towards methanol/methane, the calculations have shown a high barrier of ~0.7-1.4 eV for formate (*HCOO) and formaldehyde (*H2CO) production as the limiting steps over metal clusters, MOFs, and extended surfaces [10.1039/d3ta03591c, 10.1021/jacs.7b05591, 10.1039/d3sc02647g]. The computations have also elucidated the critical role of paired sites like Cu-S1N3 and cooperative effects like proton relay in lowering these barriers by ~0.2-0.6 eV [10.1002/anie.202109579, 10.1002/anie.202313648].
	Regarding C2+ pathways, the transition state for *CO dimerization coupling has been calculated as the potential-determining step on pure Cu and supported Cu surfaces with an energy barrier of 0.6-1.6 eV [10.1021/acscatal.9b05319, 10.1038/s41467-022-35415-x]. This barrier can be lowered to ~0.2-0.4 eV over defect-rich and heteroatom-doped Cu sites, confirming their superior selectivity [10.1002/anie.202110303, 10.1038/s41467-018-06311-0]. Advanced sampling methods have also explicitly considered solvent and entropy effects on reaction barriers [10.1021/acs.jpclett.5b02247].  
	Overall, the computations have delivered molecular-level resolutions of transition states, intermediates, and site-specific barriers, guiding optimization of active sites and rational catalyst design. Integrating these simulations with spectroscopy has also allowed bridging models with experiments [10.1021/jacs.9b12111]. Nonetheless, there exist opportunities to build on this foundation by exploring effects of explicit applied potentials, expanding the scope to unravel barriers for unconventional pathways producing value-added chemicals, and leveraging machine learning to construct accurate models without extensive DFT training data.
	※※※
	Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: Taking into consideration the advancements and findings discussed in the file, there lies an opportunity to explore emerging fields and innovative methodologies. Future research endeavors might focus on multiscale modeling frameworks that seamlessly couple DFT insights on surface reaction barriers with reactor-scale simulations to enable rational optimization of electrolyzer configurations for commercial viability. More emphasis can also be placed on elucidating transition states and binding configurations associated with C-C coupling steps to guide morphology engineering and defect tuning for boosting C2+/C3+ selectivity. Beyond established support and alloys, computational screening might unveil unusual substrates like metal-organic frameworks and 2D transition metal carbides hosting unique sites that reconfigure barriers to favor specific products. Computations could further assist spectroscopic assignments through simulated spectra of hypothesized intermediates involved in non-traditional pathways. And genomic analyses might uncover enzyme analogues capable of lowering the intrinsic energy tolls for activation and coupling events. These forward-looking pursuits can expand the boundaries of existing knowledge and catalyze breakthroughs in solar fuel technologies.

11. Elucidating Reaction Pathways - Strategies for selectivity control

	Based on the detailed analysis from the literature, there is currently limited discussion on generalized strategies for controlling selectivity in CO2 reduction reactions. Most of the work is focused on demonstrating high intrinsic selectivity towards certain products over competing pathways. 
	However, some insights can be extracted. For example, references [10.1038/s41467-023-36688-6], [10.1021/acs.jpcc.7b06895], and [10.1021/acscatal.0c03846] propose interfacing the Cu catalyst with another material like nitrogen-doped carbon to provide a secondary confinement effect. This helps stabilize key intermediates like *CO while suppressing side reactions like HER, steering selectivity towards C2+ products.
	Additionally, references [10.1021/acs.jpclett.3c01358] and [10.1021/jacs.3c05650] suggest examining the relative binding energies or stability of critical intermediates like *CO, *H, *OCCOH. Understanding selectivity control based on these descriptors provides a framework for screening optimal catalysts and binding configurations.
	Finally, several works such as [10.1038/s41467-023-35912-7], [10.1038/s41467-019-13833-8], and [10.1038/s41467-022-29428-9] reveal the importance of dynamic Cu oxidation states, with mixed Cu+/Cu0 sites promoting selective C-C coupling over Cu metal. Strategies that help stabilize desired surface rearrangements and oxidation states could offer selectivity control.
	In summary, elucidating generalized design principles for selectivity control remains an open challenge. But examining stability of intermediates/transition states, engineering multifunctional interfaces on catalyst surfaces, and dynamically stabilizing optimal surface configurations provide promising directions. Advancing fundamental understanding here will be key for optimized CO2 conversion processes.
	※※※
	While explicit strategies are currently limited, this synthesis of insights on selectivity control reveals opportunities in several emerging spaces - from dynamic interface engineering to spectroscopic elucidation of transient configurations. For instance, building 'smart' interfaces with properties modulated by reaction conditions could stabilize desired function. Incorporating novel in-situ analysis into closed-loop optimization frameworks may also uncover optimal selectivity landscapes. Furthermore, expanding these principles through high-throughput DFT screening of multifunctional sites could exponentially grow promising catalyst candidates. Overall there exist exciting frontiers to actualize enhanced, guided selectivity control via cutting-edge design and characterization.

12. Computational Modelling - Bridging DFT models with in-situ spectroscopy

	Based on the detailed analysis from the references, there is limited evidence for comprehensively bridging DFT models with in-situ spectroscopy related to CO2 reduction reaction mechanisms and selectivity control. 
	A few studies demonstrate consistency between DFT predictions and in-situ spectroscopy findings regarding reaction intermediates and pathways [10.1021/acs.jpcc.8b11431], [10.1002/anie.202110303], [10.1038/s41467-021-23065-4], [10.1021/jacs.9b12111]. For example, DFT calculations predicting enhanced *COOH generation matched operando ATR-SEIRAS data showing suppressed CO production [10.1021/jacs.9b12111]. In another case, DFT computations revealed the protonated pyrimidine N atoms in Cu6NH act as proton relays, consistent with enhanced photocatalytic efficiency from in-situ DRIFTS [10.1002/anie.202313648]. 
	Some connections are made regarding how computational modeling informs experimental design to test consistency with spectroscopy under relevant conditions [10.1038/s41467-021-23065-4], [10.1021/acscatal.0c05564]. For instance, DFT guided synthesis methods to constrain copper cluster size below 4 during CO2 reduction. In-situ EXAFS confirmed an average copper coordination number of 4.2, agreeing with computations showing low coordination environment promotes activity [10.1038/s41467-021-23065-4].
	Overall however, most literature relies purely on standalone DFT calculations or experimental techniques without explicit bridging. Some note qualitative consistency but do not comprehensively integrate modeling and spectroscopy [10.1021/acscatal.1c00860], [10.1039/d3ta01607b]. Developing multi-scale models incorporating realistic interfaces and experimental conditions remains an opportunity to strengthen connections with in-situ data. Exploring dynamic processes with similar time-resolution would also foster tighter integration. 
	※※※
	Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: The sporadic evidence linking computational modeling and in-situ spectroscopy suggests room for advancing such bridging strategies. Most current connections demonstrate matchings for static structures and consistent predictions about intermediates. Constructing adaptable models responding in real-time to experimental changes could facilitate stronger validation between techniques. For example, using applied potentials and detected intermediates from in-situ spectroscopy as direct inputs for DFT calculations would help assess performance correlations. 
	Looking ahead, new frameworks incorporating detailed interfaces and dynamic processes aligned with experimental set-ups will be instrumental. Multi-scale modeling formalisms balancing accurate electronic structure descriptions with realistic atomistic environments could offer a foundation. Simultaneously advancing in-situ diagnostic tools providing richer morphological and mechanistic information would complement improved computational models. Fusing these latest experimental and simulation capabilities would pave the way for unprecedented understanding and optimization across molecular, nanoscopic and macroscopic regimes.

13. Computational Modelling - DFT calculations providing insights into descriptor optimization

	Based on the in-depth details extracted from the file, here is a comprehensive review section on CO2 Reduction Reaction emphasizing 'Computational Modelling - DFT calculations providing insights into descriptor optimization':
	Density functional theory (DFT) calculations have provided valuable insights into optimizing descriptors for improved CO2 reduction performance. One study combines experiments with DFT modelling to unravel the light absorption, charge dynamics, electronic structure, and energetics governing the high activity of a CuInCN photocatalyst [10.1016/j.apcatb.2022.122139]. The calculations help explain modifications that enhance light harvesting, charge separation, tune electronic structure to lower barriers, and stabilize key intermediates like *COOH. 
	Other work utilizes DFT to reveal how introducing subsurface Ti into Cu electrodes modifies the surface electronic structure, donating electrons to Cu that strengthen *CO binding and reduce dimerization barriers [10.1002/anie.202110303]. This enhances selectivity towards C2+ products. Calculations also demonstrate how ligands like pyridine can destabilize intermediates like *OCOH and prevent undesired CO formation [10.1002/anie.202206279].
	DFT models have also provided insights into how strain [10.1021/acs.jpcc.1c01586], crystal facets [10.1039/d3sc02647g], Cu oxidation state [10.1016/j.apcatb.2022.122272], and local atomic arrangement in alloys [10.1039/d1ta10345h] can optimize selectivity. More broadly, binding energies of species like *CO, *H, and *HOCO serve as useful predictors balancing stability and conversion efficiency [10.1038/s41467-019-11352-0].
	Overall, DFT modelling has furthered mechanistic understanding and revealed descriptors related to light absorption, charge transfer, intermediate binding, barriers, electronic structure, strain, and more that offer strategies for improved CO2 photoreduction performance. Combined with high-throughput screening and experiments, computations will continue elucidating untapped horizons like reaction environments and surface modifications to advance renewable carbon utilization.
	※※※
	Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: The insights garnered from DFT modelling discussed in this file highlight the interplay of light absorption, charge transfer kinetics, intermediate stabilization, and electronic structure governing CO2 activation and conversion. While current efforts have expanded mechanistic comprehension and identified descriptors like intermediate binding energies, charge density, and crystal strain that can enhance performance, most focus solely on the catalytic material itself without considering the broader reaction environment. 
	By incorporating external stimuli into models like light, electric fields, and multi-phase transport, computational screening could reveal previously hidden optimization vectors related to light-matter interactions, charge polarization, mass transport limitations, and catalyst-interface effects that harmonize to enable selective, energy-efficient CO2 conversion. High-throughput DFT calculations enumerating materials, compositions, defect engineering, facet orientations, applied potentials, illumination wavelengths, and local chemical environments in tandem may illuminate unconventional combinations and configurations poised to achieve transformational breakthroughs. Hybrid machine learning-DFT approaches may also extract generalized design principles. With the toolset of modelling and experiments in hand, cross-cutting advancements bridging beyond intrinsic material limitations into holistic reaction choreography seem within reach.

14. Computational Modelling - Key descriptors and volcano relationships

	Based on the detailed analysis of the references, some key insights related to computational modeling of CO2 reduction reaction can be summarized. The literature [10.1038/NCHEM.1873] identifies the oxygen adsorption energy ΔEO as a key descriptor that correlates to binding energies of intermediates and transition states through scaling relationships. This allows ΔEO to serve as a single parameter for predicting catalytic activity. The difference in CO2* versus H* binding energies is also identified as a selectivity descriptor favoring CO over H2 [10.1021/acscatal.9b02594].
        More broadly, binding energies of critical intermediates like *CO, *COOH, and *CHO are widely deemed as primary descriptors tied to activity and selectivity through volcano relationships [10.1021/jp400937e, 10.1039/c9ta00627c]. The ability to tune these energies via compositional and geometric effects is attributed to the efficacy of multi-metallic catalysts [10.1021/acs.jpclett.3c01358].
	In terms of C2+ specific selectivity, the literature demonstrates volcano plots between *CO/*COOH binding and C2+ selectivity, using this analysis to computationally screen improved catalyst candidates [10.1039/d2ta02749f]. For controlling CH4 selectivity specifically, Cu coordination number is identified as a key descriptor, with lower numbers enhancing *CO hydrogenation [10.1038/s41467-021-23065-4].	
	※※※
	Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: Taking into consideration the advancements and findings discussed in the references, there lies an opportunity to explore broader, more expansive descriptor spaces and construct multidimensional volcano relationships predictive of selectivity towards targeted products. Future research endeavors might also focus on bridging models across length scales, connecting intrinsic electronic properties to more complex nanoparticulate geometries.

15. Computational Modelling - Whether or not simulations were used in the article to justify the results, and if so, please describe in detail the simulation methodology and the spatial and temporal scales of the simulations, as well as describe in detail the full simulation methodology and procedure.

	Based on the in-depth details extracted from the file, here is an analytical and comprehensive review section on CO2 Reduction Reaction, emphasizing 'Computational Modelling - Whether or not simulations were used in the article to justify the results, and if so, please describe in detail the simulation methodology and the spatial and temporal scales of the simulations, as well as describe in detail the full simulation methodology and procedure.'
	The articles utilize a diverse array of computational modeling techniques to provide insights into the mechanisms, active sites, and selectivity trends in the CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) [10.1021/acscatal.0c02146, 10.1021/jacs.3c01350]. Many studies employ density functional theory (DFT) calculations [10.1021/acscatal.0c02146, 10.1021/jacs.3c01350, 10.1039/d2ta09477k, 10.1021/acscatal.2c00646], using packages like the Vienna Ab Initio Simulation Package (VASP) [10.1021/jacs.3c02428, 10.1039/d0ta03645e, 10.1021/acscatal.2c00646], CASTEP [10.1021/acscatal.9b00896], and DMol3 [10.1021/jacs.3c06697]. Common DFT functionals and methods include the Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (PBE) generalized gradient approximation [10.1038/s41467-023-35993-4, 10.1038/s41467-023-38777-y], Grimme dispersion corrections [10.1039/d1ta01120k], and climbing image nudged elastic band (CI-NEB) techniques to locate transition states [10.1021/acs.jpclett.1c00204].  
	Multiple articles model specific Cu surfaces and defects using slab models [10.1021/acscatal.1c00860, 10.1021/acscatal.1c00768, 10.1021/acscatal.2c00646, 10.1021/acscatal.0c01880]. The simulations often employ multiple layers [10.1021/jacs.9b02945], with only certain layers allowed to relax during geometry optimization. Periodic boundary conditions are applied along the x-y plane while vacuum spacing of 15-20 Å  is added along the z-axis to avoid slab interactions. Some studies also incorporate explicit solvent layers and electric fields to capture the electrochemical interface [10.1038/s41467-020-20615-0]. The DFT modeling provides mechanistic insights by mapping reaction pathways [10.1038/s41467-021-27768-6], calculating optimized geometries [10.1039/c9ta00039a], transition states [10.1038/s41467-023-37898-8], binding energies [10.1021/jacs.3c00467], density of states [10.1002/anie.202207600], free energy diagrams [10.1021/acs.jpcc.8b11431, 10.1021/acs.jpcc.2c06898], and other properties.  
	More computationally demanding methods like ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) [10.1021/jacs.3c01638] and ReaxFF reactive molecular dynamics (RMD) [10.1021/acscatal.1c05431] have been applied to simulate reaction dynamics over broader temporal scales up to nanoseconds [10.1021/jacs.2c07178] and model processes like surface facet oxidation [10.1038/s41467-020-20615-0], subsurface O diffusion [10.1021/acs.jpcc.7b08269] and conformational changes of molecular modifiers [10.1021/jacs.8b13655]. Other modeling techniques utilized include kinetic Monte Carlo (KMC) [10.1021/jacs.7b05362], finite element method (FEM) [10.1039/d1ta08889k], finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) [10.1039/c9ta02288k], and COMSOL [10.1021/jacs.1c11253] simulations to solve coupled mass transport and reaction processes. Some studies implement computationally efficient methods like high-throughput screening and stochastic algorithms [10.1021/acs.jpcc.2c08950, 10.1002/anie.202201913].  
	The modeling performed in these works complements experimental efforts to synthesize copper-based nanostructures and analyze surface defects using spectroscopy [10.1021/jacs.2c01044] and microscopy [10.1038/s41467-021-27169-9]. Integrating modelling with experiments provides validation [10.1038/s41467-022-30289-5, 10.1038/s41557-018-0092-x], guides material design concepts [10.1021/acscatal.3c02514], and leads to an enhanced mechanistic understanding of how local chemical environments impact intermediate stabilization [10.1038/s41467-023-37898-8] and product selectivity [10.1038/s41467-020-20769-x, 10.1002/anie.202105118].  
	※※※  
	Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: Through computational simulations, we can bridge multiple length and time scales while retaining predictive accuracy. Developing hierarchical multiscale models encompassing the quantum [10.1038/s41565-019-0603-y], mesoscale [10.1038/s41467-020-20004-7] and continuum domains could enable simulations of extended catalytic systems over prolonged durations. Efforts to emulate intricate chemical environments using hybrid quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics schemes [10.1021/acs.jpcc.9b09323], electrochemical interfaces [10.1021/acscatal.3c02428] etc. will be crucial to capture relevant phenomena. Designing efficient interfaces to couple modeling software with emerging experimental facilities and spectroscopic databases could accelerate validation. Overall, nurturing synergistic experiment-modeling interplays through cross-domain collaborations and AI-assisted workflows might catalyze scientific discovery.

16. Computational Modelling - Framework integrating modelling with experiments

	A comprehensive analysis of the literature reveals that most studies have not developed systematic frameworks integrating computational modeling with experiments on CO2 reduction catalysis. Several works utilize DFT calculations or other simulations to complement experimental results by providing atomic-level insights into mechanisms, active sites, etc. However, very few demonstrate tight, iterative coupling where models directly inform subsequent experiments and vice versa.	
	One exemplary framework integrating modeling and experiments is shown in reference [10.1038/s41467-020-20615-0], which combines machine learning accelerated molecular dynamics for catalyst surface representations, DFT screening of sites, experimental validation of predictions, and structure-activity analysis to enable optimization. This showcases how modeling can guide experimental fabrication in initial stages rather than just rationalizing observations after the fact. 
	Overall, an integrated approach iteratively linking simulations and experiments could significantly advance the field by overcoming limitations of each method alone. This could involve using computations to identify promising materials, synthesizing and testing top candidates, then refining models based on results to progress another cycle. Such a methodology would require extensive collaboration between modelling and experimental groups.		
	※※※  
	Tight integration of computational modeling with experiments holds immense promise, potentially transforming how new catalysts are designed and engineered. Future efforts should prioritize developing robust frameworks that enable models to steer experiments to elucidate mechanisms, and experiments to refine models. This could involve advanced multi-scale modeling bridging first-principles and reactor-scale simulations with catalysis testing, supported by operando characterization. The long-term payoff of pushing such integrated frameworks could be transformative.

17. Modulating Local Chemical Environments - Influence of cations, anions and pH

	Copper-based electrocatalysts have shown promise for the conversion of CO2 into value-added chemicals and fuels through the CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR). Recent studies have demonstrated that modulating local chemical environments of these catalysts through intentional alterations of cations, anions and pH can substantially impact catalytic performance.	
	Specifically, the choice of alkali metal cations (Li+, Na+, K+, Cs+) in electrolyte solutions has been found to affect product distributions [10.1021/jacs.7b06765]. Smaller cations like Li+ tend to favor CO formation, while larger cations such as Cs+ stabilize key reaction intermediates with larger dipole moments, boosting selectivity towards C2+ products like ethylene [10.1021/acscatal.8b01340, 10.1039/d1ta09125e]. This electric field effect induced by cation adsorption enables tuning of local pH as well, which further promotes C-C coupling reactions [10.1021/acscatal.9b04746].
	In terms of anions, halides like chloride and bromide are often added alongside cationic salts in electrolyte solutions. Their strong interactions with undercoordinated copper sites impact binding energies and geometries of intermediates like *CO, consequently directing selectivity [10.1002/anie.201910155, 10.1021/acscatal.7b01416]. Bicarbonate anions have also been shown to mediate delivery of dissolved CO2 to catalytic surfaces [10.1021/jacs.7b10462]. 		
	Additionally, intentional modulation of pH has pronounced effects on CO2RR product distributions. More alkaline conditions suppress the competing Hydrogen Evolution Reaction while assisting C-C coupling steps [10.1038/s41467-019-13833-8, 10.1021/acscatal.3c00056]. This local pH increase stems from consumption of protons during the multi-electron surface reactions. 	
	In summary, recent advances have demonstrated that cations, anions and pH can strongly influence CO2RR performance through electric field modifications, stabilizing key reaction intermediates, and controlling proton availability near catalytic sites [10.1021/jacs.7b10462, 10.1021/acscatal.7b01416]. Further research should focus on synergistically optimizing these local chemical environments to unlock enhanced selectivity and conversion efficiency. 	
	※※※  
	Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: The emerging capability to intentionally tailor local chemical environments of catalysts through cations, anions and pH modulation provides an intriguing new dimension for advancing CO2 electroreduction processes. However, most studies have only examined varying one factor at a time. An expansive perspective should focus research endeavors on simultaneously optimizing combinations of cation identities/concentrations, anion species, and pH levels in a synergistic manner to push the frontiers of efficiency and product selectivity. Furthermore, operando spectroscopic techniques that offer dynamic glimpses into changing local environments under working conditions will be pivotal. Elucidating interdependencies between tuning parameters can unravel guiding principles that transcend incremental improvements and propel the field into hitherto unexplored territory rich with breakthrough possibilities.

18. Heterogeneous Catalytic Materials and catalyst Beyond Copper Catalysts - Alternative transition metals, intermetallics, Single atom catalysts

	Copper catalysts have been extensively studied for CO2 reduction, with demonstrated ability to produce hydrocarbons, oxygenates and other value-added chemicals [10.1038/s41467-020-17690-8, 10.1021/acscatal.3c02451]. However, alternatives like alloying copper with other metals, using abundant non-noble metals, as well as emerging single atom catalysts also hold promise to enhance selectivity, efficiency and stability.
	Strategically designed CuM bimetallic catalysts can help break linear scaling relations that limit C2+ formation on pure copper [10.1039/d1ta01120k]. Computational screening predicts specific CuZn, CuAu, and CuAg alloys as well as CuPt and CuNi single atom alloys to have optimal binding energies and electronic properties for higher CO2 conversion and C-C coupling selectivity [10.1038/s41467-023-36926-x, 10.1021/acs.jpcc.8b12449]. PtIn [10.1016/j.apcatb.2017.07.069] and PdIn [10.1021/acscatal.5b01271] intermetallics also emerge as promising alternatives for reactions like CO2 hydrogenation and methanol reforming. 
	Several abundant transition metals like Fe, Co, and Ni have been studied as promising substitutes to Cu in contexts like methane activation [10.1021/acs.jpcc.8b09319] and electrochemical reduction when tailored as metal-organic frameworks [10.1021/acs.jpcc.9b08359], dual-metal sites [10.1039/d0ta00033g], single atoms on supports like graphene [10.1039/c9ta11715f] and BN [10.1039/d2ta00941b]. Such catalyst designs exhibit electronic properties similar to copper while avoiding issues like sintering. Computational studies on a range of transition metals predict Rh, Ir, Co and Ni single atom catalysts to reduce CO2 at remarkably low overpotentials [10.1039/d1ta08285j, 10.1021/acs.jpcc.9b04745, 10.1038/s41467-023-36926-x, 10.1021/acs.jpcc.8b12449].
	※※※
	Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: The review reveals that while copper catalysts have shown unique selectivity for CO2 reduction, strategic incorporation of secondary metals, abundantly available transition metals, as well as isolated single atom motifs emerge as compelling design options offering similar or in some cases enhanced performance. Key strategies like intentional asymmetry in catalyst active sites, interface engineering, and coupling abundant metals with selective ones in tandem configurations will direct future explorations towards realizing scalable and economical CO2 conversion technologies.

19. Summary of additional issues - What is the reaction pathway proposed in this article, and what are the key steps that determine the product selectivity of ethylene, ethanol, acetic acid, etc.?

	The electrochemical and photocatalytic reduction of CO2 has been extensively studied as a promising strategy for reducing atmospheric CO2 emissions while producing value-added carbon-containing chemicals. Multiple reaction pathways and key intermediates have been proposed, with the selectivity of final products dependent on crucial steps.
	For C2+ products like ethylene and ethanol, *CO is identified as an important intermediate across copper catalyst systems [10.1038/s41467-020-20615-0, 10.1038/s41467-023-36411-5]. Its source is debated - either direct generation from CO2 [10.1038/s41560-021-00973-9] or from formate decomposition [10.1038/s41467-020-16998-9]. CC coupling of *CO species into *OCCO or related dimer intermediates is widely accepted as the rate-determining step for C2+ selectivity [10.1038/s41467-023-36721-8, 10.1021/acs.jpcc.2c06898], with the barrier controlled by parameters like copper crystal facets [10.1038/s41467-023-38524-3], surface defect density [10.1038/s41467-020-16998-9], oxidation state [10.1016/j.apcatb.2022.122272], and halide adsorption [10.1002/anie.202210375]. The reduced barrier promotes *CO residence time for coupling. 
	After CC coupling, the key selectivity branch point is the *CH2CHO intermediate, with C-O cleavage giving ethylene and C-H bond cleavage yielding ethanol [10.1038/s41560-020-0594-9]. Local pH is implicated in directing this bifurcation [10.1038/s41467-023-39351-2]. Oxygen functionalities that withdraw electron density also favor ethanol by stabilizing *CH2CHO [10.1021/jacs.3c06697].
	For C1 products like methane, *CO protonation and hydrogenation steps are instead critical. The potential-limiting barrier is *CO + H+ + e− → *CHO [10.1038/s41467-023-36411-5], modulated by parameters like atomic copper arrangements that optimize H2O dissociation for proton supply [10.1038/s41467-022-29035-8].
	※※※ 
	Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: Significant progress elucidating likely CO2 reduction pathways and selectivity determinants like key reaction intermediates and their binding motifs has been made. However, debate continues over the precise sequence of steps, exact active site nature, and dominant coupling modes. More operando studies under working conditions can help consolidate understanding. An integrated framework combining multi-scale characterization, voltage-dependent product quantification, selective poisoning, and kinetic isotope tracing may allow development of a unified mechanistic picture. This may guide rational optimization of catalyst design parameters like morphology, oxidation states and metal pairs for targeted C1 vs C2+ selectivity.

20. Summary of additional issues - Whether the article proposes the adsorption energy of carbon monoxide (CO) suitable for CC coupling, and if so, please give the interval of CO adsorption energy suitable for CC coupling.

	Detailed analysis established from multiple studies shows that defining an optimal carbon monoxide (CO) adsorption energy range that enables effective carbon-carbon (C-C) coupling is an important criteria for achieving high selectivity towards C2+ products in CO2 electroreduction reactions [10.1038/s41467-018-06311-0, 10.1021/jacs.9b02124]. While some articles have utilized density functional theory (DFT) calculations or volcano plot principles to suggest suitable CO binding strength ranges around 0.5-1.0 eV [10.1021/cs500537y, 10.1039/d1ta09608g], most literature has only qualitatively analyzed requirements for sufficient yet not excessive CO coverage to promote coupling [10.1021/acs.jpcc.2c06898, 10.1002/anie.201601282]. 
	Computational screening of bimetallic catalysts has also aimed to identify materials with optimal CO binding configurations and dimerization barriers [10.1039/d2ta02749f, 10.1021/acscatal.6b03147]. Nonetheless, unambiguous quantification of favorable CO adsorption energies has remained elusive. Synthesized catalysts demonstrating enhanced C2+ selectivity have attributed improvements to increased CO residence time or surface concentration rather than meeting definitive energetic criteria [10.1038/s41467-023-36411-5].
	Therefore, expanding theoretical methodologies to not only examine CO coverage effects but also robustly correlate specific CO binding energy values with subsequent C-C coupling feasibility and multi-carbon product distributions is vital [10.1038/s41467-020-16381-8]. Coupled in situ characterization and kinetic analysis during CO2 electrolysis could also elucidate suitable ranges [10.1021/acscatal.9b01899]. 
	Standardizing such CO adsorption descriptors and energy targets would significantly advance identification of optimal catalyst compositions and surface structures for selective C2+ formation [10.1038/s41560-020-0666-x, 10.1021/jacs.8b11237].
	※※※
	Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: Examining the extensive analysis compiled on determining favorable carbon monoxide binding regimes to promote C-C coupling, some unifying principles emerge. Multiple theoretical studies have indicated certain thresholds for sufficient yet not excessive CO coverage and binding strength lie around 0.5-1.0 eV. Nonetheless, unambiguous validation of model predictions remains lacking. 
	Therefore, opportunities exist to couple spectroscopic quantification of CO binding configurations during CO2 electrocatalysis with precise catalytic performance mapping to deduce correlations [10.1021/acscatal.3c02451]. Machine learning establishment of structure-energy-function relationships could also elucidate suitable intervals [10.1038/s41467-023-39666-0]. Expanding multi-scale, multi-physics simulations from surface levels to reactor scales holds promise [10.1038/s41467-020-20397-5]. Most vitally, standardized CO adsorption energy descriptors need development, against which novel compositions can be screened [10.1038/s41467-023-36778-5]. Advancing along these research directions will provide vital clarity on targeting ideal CO binding regimes.
