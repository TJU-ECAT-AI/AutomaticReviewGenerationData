1.The document does not provide information on the key strategies and approaches that have been recently developed to enhance the catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes. However, it does discuss the effect of Sn on the dispersion of Pt in platinum supported SBA-15 catalysts and its influence on the dehydrogenation of propane activity, selectivity to propylene, coking, and catalyst stability. The study shows that Sn results in higher Pt dispersion by the formation of PtSn alloy, leading to smaller Pt particles and higher propane conversion, selectivity to propylene, and stability, despite higher coke formation.

1.该文件没有提供有关最近开发的增强直接脱氢过程中支撑金属催化剂催化稳定性的关键策略和方法的信息。但是,它确实讨论了Sn对Pt在铂支撑SBA-15催化剂中的分散的影响,以及其对丙烷脱氢活性、丙烯选择性、焦化和催化剂稳定性的影响力。研究显示,Sn通过形成PtSn合金导致更高的Pt分散,从而形成更小的Pt颗粒,并提高丙烷转化率、丙烯选择性和稳定性,尽管焦炭形成量更高。
