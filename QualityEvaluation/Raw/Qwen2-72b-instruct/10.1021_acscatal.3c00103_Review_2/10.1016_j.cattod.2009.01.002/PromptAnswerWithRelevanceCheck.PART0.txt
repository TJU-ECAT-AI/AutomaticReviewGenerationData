Read the questions and answers provided below. First, critically assess the overall relevance of the answers provided to the set of questions asked.

If, upon your assessment, you find that the answers do not contain information that is relevant to the questions asked, stop your review process immediately and respond with a single sentence: "※※※※※※※The provided answers are not relevant to the questions.※※※※※※※". Do not provide any additional explanation or background information, only this sentence should be given as a response in case of irrelevant answers.

If, however, the answers are relevant to the questions asked, proceed to compile answers for each question according to the instructions below. Ensure to aggregate all the relevant answers from the multiple answer results provided in the document, and organize them sequentially by their order number, compiling the corresponding quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question.

If the provided answers' quotes are not differentiated by question, ensure to break them down and assign the quotes to each respective question, outputting them separately within each question's section.

To provide a comprehensive review, differentiate the responses into quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question based on the details given in the 'Answer' XML tags. Structure your review using the XML format showcased below if the answers are relevant to the questions asked:

1.The document does not provide information on the key strategies and approaches that have been recently developed to enhance the catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes. However, it does discuss the effect of Sn on the dispersion of Pt in platinum supported SBA-15 catalysts and its influence on the dehydrogenation of propane activity, selectivity to propylene, coking, and catalyst stability. The study shows that Sn results in higher Pt dispersion by the formation of PtSn alloy, leading to smaller Pt particles and higher propane conversion, selectivity to propylene, and stability, despite higher coke formation.

1.The document does not provide information on the key strategies and approaches that have been recently developed to enhance the catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes. However, it does discuss the effect of Sn on the dispersion of Pt in platinum supported SBA-15 catalysts and its influence on the dehydrogenation of propane activity, selectivity to propylene, coking, and catalyst stability. The study shows that the presence of Sn results in higher Pt dispersion by the formation of PtSn alloy, leading to smaller Pt particles. This, in turn, affects the surface roughness of the particles, which influences the activity and selectivity of the catalyst. The bimetallic Pt-Sn catalyst exhibits higher propane conversion, higher selectivity to propylene, and superior catalyst stability than the monometallic Pt catalyst, despite higher coke formation. The study proposes a modified drain-off effect to explain the superior selectivity and stability of the bimetallic catalyst, suggesting that Sn acts as a scavenger to keep Pt sites clean from coke by draining-off the coke precursors from the vicinity of active sites to the support.
