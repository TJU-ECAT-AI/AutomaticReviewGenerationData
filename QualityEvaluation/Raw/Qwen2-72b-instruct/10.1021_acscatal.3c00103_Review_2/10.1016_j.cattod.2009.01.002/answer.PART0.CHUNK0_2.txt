1.The document does not provide information on the key strategies and approaches that have been recently developed to enhance the catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes. However, it does discuss the effect of Sn on the dispersion of Pt in platinum supported SBA-15 catalysts and its influence on the dehydrogenation of propane activity, selectivity to propylene, coking, and catalyst stability. The study shows that the presence of Sn results in higher Pt dispersion by the formation of PtSn alloy, leading to smaller Pt particles. This, in turn, affects the surface roughness of the particles, which influences the activity and selectivity of the catalyst. The bimetallic Pt-Sn catalyst exhibits higher propane conversion, higher selectivity to propylene, and superior catalyst stability than the monometallic Pt catalyst, despite higher coke formation. The study proposes a modified drain-off effect to explain the superior selectivity and stability of the bimetallic catalyst, suggesting that Sn acts as a scavenger to keep Pt sites clean from coke by draining-off the coke precursors from the vicinity of active sites to the support.

1.文档没有提供关于最近开发的增强支撑金属催化剂在直接脱氢过程中的催化稳定性的关键策略和方法的信息。但是,它确实讨论了Sn对Pt在铂支撑SBA-15催化剂中的分散的影响,以及其对丙烷脱氢活性、选择性、焦化和催化剂稳定性的影响力。研究表明,Sn的存在通过形成PtSn合金导致更高的Pt分散,从而形成更小的Pt颗粒。这反过来又影响了颗粒的表面粗糙度,从而影响了催化剂的活性和选择性。与单金属Pt催化剂相比,双金属Pt-Sn催化剂表现出更高的丙烷转化率、更高的丙烯选择性和更优异的催化剂稳定性,尽管焦炭形成量更高。研究提出了修改后的排水效应来解释双金属催化剂的优越选择性和稳定性,表明Sn作为清洁剂,通过从活性位点附近排出焦炭前体,防止Pt位点被焦炭污染。
