[1] "Stable and selective catalysts for propane dehydrogenation operating at thermodynamic limit Hitting the limits on propene synthesis The greater abundance of propane from shale gas has spurred efforts to use it as a propylene feedstock. Direct dehydrogenation catalysts consisting of platinumtin alloy nanoparticles supported on alumina often must run with hydrogen dilution to avoid carbon buildup and excess tin to avoid alloy segregation."
[2] "We report that silica-supported platinum-tin (Pt1Sn1) nanoparticles (<2 nanometers in diameter) can operate as a PDH catalyst at thermodynamically limited conversion levels, with excellent stability and selectivity to propylene (>99%). Atomic mixing of Pt and Sn in the precursor is preserved upon reduction and during catalytic operation. The benign interaction of these nanoparticles with the silicon dioxide support does not lead to Pt-Sn segregation and formation of a tin oxide phase that can occur over traditional catalyst supports."
[3] "The principle behind catalyst synthesis is to begin with a heterometallic Pt-Sn coordination complex in which Pt and Sn are in immediate contact, and this interaction is retained during the reduction and PDH reaction."
[4] "We developed a PDH catalyst that operates at thermodynamically limited conversion levels without the addition of hydrogen to the feed and exhibits excellent stability and selectivity to propylene (>99%). The catalyst is composed of silica-supported Pt1Sn1 NPs, synthesized and pretreated to ensure that the mixing of Pt and Sn is preserved during catalytic operation."
[5] "The data in Fig. 1, A to C, were obtained with 16 vol % propane in helium. Propane streams are diluted in commercial operations to increase the limiting equilibrium conversion, which is higher at lower propane partial pressure (fig. S2), and to limit catalyst deactivation rates (7, 16, 17). This approach requires additional downstream separation units and limits process efficiency."
[6] "The data in Fig. 1, A to C, show the performance of the Pt1Sn1/SiO2 catalyst (1 wt % Pt and 0.6 wt % Sn) for propane dehydrogenation at 580C, 16 vol % propane (with the remainder helium) and at a weight hourly space velocity (WHSV) of 4.7 hours1. Under these reaction conditions, the thermodynamic limit on propane conversion is 66.5% (fig. S2). The Pt1Sn1/SiO2 catalyst showed near-thermodynamic conversion of >66% (Fig. 1A, red circles) and >99% selectivity to propylene (Fig. 1B, red circles)."
[7] "The data in Fig. 1D show that, under these conditions, the propane conversion goes from 41 to 39% in 120 min. Under identical conditions, the other tested catalysts deactivate very rapidly to very low conversion, as illustrated for the commercial mimic. A transmission electron microscopy (TEM) image of the spent catalyst, after 120 min of PDH reaction, is shown in fig. S6. The image shows that the Pt-Sn NPs are well dispersed, with an average particle diameter of 1.6  0.67 nm, which is consistent with the particle size in fresh samples."
[8] "We attempted to regenerate the Pt1Sn1/SiO2 catalyst by oxidation, using 1% O2 as a mild oxidant at 500C followed by reduction at 600C (see supplementary materials for details of the regeneration procedure). The regeneration studies showed that Pt1Sn1/SiO2 catalysts can be partially regenerated. For example, we measured 97% of the initial activity and >99% of the initial selectivity after three PDH/regeneration cycles (fig. S5)."
[9] "Data in Fig. 3A show that the process of mixing chloroplatinic acid (H2PtCl6) and tin(II) chloride (SnCl2) in 0.1 M hydrochloric acid solution formed a heterometallic Pt-Sn coordination complex."
[10] "A bright-field TEM image of Pt-Sn NPs formed on SiO2 upon the reduction of the Pt-Sn complex shows high metal dispersion on the support, with an average NP size of 1.3  0.6 nm (Fig. 3B). The NP size distribution (Fig. 3C) shows that most NPs were <2 nm. The XRD spectra in Fig. 3D show that the formed NPs were essentially alloys of Pt and Sn. This finding is supported by the presence of the XRD peaks corresponding to Pt1Sn1 (41.8 and 44.1) and Pt3Sn1 (39.0 and 45.3) stoichiometries."
[11] "The real-space Pt LIII EXAFS spectra for the Pt1Sn1/SiO2 catalyst (Fig. 4D) are substantially different from the spectra of monometallic Pt and indicate the mixing of Pt and Sn atoms. The best-fit spectrum for the Pt1Sn1/SiO2 catalyst is characterized by the presence of the Pt-Pt and Pt-Sn scattering paths, consistent with the formation of PtSn intermetallic phases."
