[1] "Stable and selective catalysts for propane dehydrogenation operating at thermodynamic limit Hitting the limits on propene synthesis The greater abundance of propane from shale gas has spurred efforts to use it as a propylene feedstock. Direct dehydrogenation catalysts consisting of platinumtin alloy nanoparticles supported on alumina often must run with hydrogen dilution to avoid carbon buildup and excess tin to avoid alloy segregation."
[2] "We report that silica-supported platinum-tin (Pt1Sn1) nanoparticles (<2 nanometers in diameter) can operate as a PDH catalyst at thermodynamically limited conversion levels, with excellent stability and selectivity to propylene (>99%). Atomic mixing of Pt and Sn in the precursor is preserved upon reduction and during catalytic operation. The benign interaction of these nanoparticles with the silicon dioxide support does not lead to Pt-Sn segregation and formation of a tin oxide phase that can occur over traditional catalyst supports."
[3] "The principle behind catalyst synthesis is to begin with a heterometallic Pt-Sn coordination complex in which Pt and Sn are in immediate contact, and this interaction is retained during the reduction and PDH reaction."
[4] "We developed a PDH catalyst that operates at thermodynamically limited conversion levels without the addition of hydrogen to the feed and exhibits excellent stability and selectivity to propylene (>99%)."
[5] "The data in Fig. 1, A to C, were obtained with 16 vol % propane in helium. Propane streams are diluted in commercial operations to increase the limiting equilibrium conversion, which is higher at lower propane partial pressure (fig. S2), and to limit catalyst deactivation rates (7, 16, 17). This approach requires additional downstream separation units and limits process efficiency."
[6] "The data in Fig. 1, A to C, show the performance of the Pt1Sn1/SiO2 catalyst (1 wt % Pt and 0.6 wt % Sn) for propane dehydrogenation at 580C, 16 vol % propane (with the remainder helium) and at a weight hourly space velocity (WHSV) of 4.7 hours1. Under these reaction conditions, the thermodynamic limit on propane conversion is 66.5% (fig. S2). The Pt1Sn1/SiO2 catalyst showed near-thermodynamic conversion of >66% (Fig. 1A, red circles) and >99% selectivity to propylene (Fig. 1B, red circles)."
[7] "The data in Fig. 1D show the propylene yield (product of the selectivity and conversion) for the tested catalysts, demonstrating the superior performance of the Pt1Sn1/SiO2 catalyst. Increasing the Sn:Pt atomic ratio on SiO2-supported catalysts to the levels used in the commercial Al2O3-supported catalysts (Pt:Sn = 1:5) led to poor performance (fig. S3A) (15). Similarly, decreasing the Sn:Pt atomic ratio on Pt-Sn/γ-Al2O3 to Pt1Sn1 led to rapid catalyst deactivation (fig. S3B)."
[8] "The data in Fig. 2B show the productivities of different catalysts operated under a range of conditions. The data show that the Pt1Sn1/SiO2 catalyst reported here demonstrated the highest productivity for propylene production of all tested catalysts. For example, Pt1Sn1/SiO2 in the absence of hydrogen was more productive than the commercial mimic Pt-Sn/γ-Al2O3 by two orders of magnitude."
[9] "The overall catalyst performance of the Pt1Sn1/SiO2 catalysts was also studied at different WHSVs (i.e., including those away from the equilibrium conversion). Catalyst productivity remained high, between 28 and 40 moles per gram of catalyst, for different WHSVs (fig. S4 and table S2)."
[10] "The data in fig. S5 show that, under these conditions, the propane conversion goes from 41 to 39% in 120 min. Under identical conditions, the other tested catalysts deactivate very rapidly to very low conversion, as illustrated for the commercial mimic."
[11] "A transmission electron microscopy (TEM) image of the spent catalyst, after 120 min of PDH reaction, is shown in fig. S6. The image shows that the Pt-Sn NPs are well dispersed, with an average particle diameter of 1.6  0.67 nm, which is consistent with the particle size in fresh samples."
[12] "We attempted to regenerate the Pt1Sn1/SiO2 catalyst by oxidation, using 1% O2 as a mild oxidant at 500C followed by reduction at 600C (see supplementary materials for details of the regeneration procedure). The regeneration studies showed that Pt1Sn1/SiO2 catalysts can be partially regenerated. For example, we measured 97% of the initial activity and >99% of the initial selectivity after three PDH/regeneration cycles (fig. S5)."

1.Recent advancements in catalyst design for direct dehydrogenation processes have focused on developing stable and selective catalysts that can operate at thermodynamic limits.
