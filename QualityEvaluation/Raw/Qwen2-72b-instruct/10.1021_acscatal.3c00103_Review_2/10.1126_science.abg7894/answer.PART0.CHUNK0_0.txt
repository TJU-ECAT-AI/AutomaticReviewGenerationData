[1] "Stable and selective catalysts for propane dehydrogenation operating at thermodynamic limit Hitting the limits on propene synthesis The greater abundance of propane from shale gas has spurred efforts to use it as a propylene feedstock. Direct dehydrogenation catalysts consisting of platinumtin alloy nanoparticles supported on alumina often must run with hydrogen dilution to avoid carbon buildup and excess tin to avoid alloy segregation."
[2] "We report that silica-supported platinum-tin (Pt1Sn1) nanoparticles (<2 nanometers in diameter) can operate as a PDH catalyst at thermodynamically limited conversion levels, with excellent stability and selectivity to propylene (>99%). Atomic mixing of Pt and Sn in the precursor is preserved upon reduction and during catalytic operation. The benign interaction of these nanoparticles with the silicon dioxide support does not lead to Pt-Sn segregation and formation of a tin oxide phase that can occur over traditional catalyst supports."
[3] "To alleviate this issue, large quantities of Sn are used in the catalyst preparation (the nominal atomic loading is Sn:Pt between 4 and 5), which increases the yield of intermetallic PtSn NPs (12). In addition, studies have shown that adding hydrogen to the reactant feed reduces the rate of catalyst deactivation (13). Although this strategy is implemented commercially (10), addition of hydrogen in the feed lowers the thermodynamic limit on per-pass propane conversion (fig. S1) and decreases productivity (7)."
[4] "We developed a PDH catalyst that operates at thermodynamically limited conversion levels without the addition of hydrogen to the feed and exhibits excellent stability and selectivity to propylene (>99%). The catalyst is composed of silica-supported Pt1Sn1 NPs, synthesized and pretreated to ensure that the mixing of Pt and Sn is preserved during catalytic operation."
[5] "The principle behind catalyst synthesis is to begin with a heterometallic Pt-Sn coordination complex in which Pt and Sn are in immediate contact, and this interaction is retained during the reduction and PDH reaction."
[6] "This catalyst has three main features: (i) The PtSn NPs form an atomically mixed Pt-Sn precursor. (ii) Upon reduction, very small (less than 2 nm diameter) intermetallic PtSn NPs form. (iii) A benign interaction of these NPs with the SiO2 support avoids segregation of Pt and Sn and formation of a SnOx phase."

1.Recent advancements in catalyst design for direct dehydrogenation processes have focused on developing stable and selective catalysts that can operate at thermodynamic limits. These catalysts, often consisting of platinum-tin alloy nanoparticles supported on alumina, have traditionally required hydrogen dilution to prevent carbon buildup and excess tin to avoid alloy segregation. However, a new approach using silica-supported platinum-tin nanoparticles has been reported to operate at thermodynamically limited conversion levels with high stability and selectivity to propylene. This is achieved by preserving the atomic mixing of platinum and tin during reduction and catalytic operation, and the benign interaction of the nanoparticles with the silica support prevents segregation and the formation of tin oxide phases. This catalyst can operate without hydrogen addition, which increases productivity by avoiding the decrease in thermodynamic limits on propane conversion. The synthesis of the catalyst begins with a heterometallic Pt-Sn coordination complex, ensuring that the interaction between Pt and Sn is retained during reduction and the PDH reaction. The catalyst features atomically mixed Pt-Sn precursors, very small intermetallic PtSn nanoparticles upon reduction, and a benign interaction with the silica support that avoids segregation and the formation of a tin oxide phase.

1.最近在直接脱氢过程的催化剂设计方面的进展集中在开发稳定和选择性催化剂，这些催化剂可以在热力学极限下运行。这些催化剂通常由负载在氧化铝上的铂锡合金纳米粒子组成，传统上需要氢稀释以防止碳堆积，并且需要过量的锡来避免合金分离。然而，据报道，使用硅胶支持的铂锡纳米粒子的新方法可以在热力学限制的转化水平上运行，具有高稳定性和对丙烯的高选择性。这是通过在还原和催化操作期间保持铂和锡的原子混合来实现的，纳米粒子与硅胶支持的良性相互作用防止了分离和锡氧化物相的形成。这种催化剂可以在不添加氢的情况下运行，通过避免丙烷转化的热力学极限下降来提高生产力。催化剂的合成从异金属Pt-Sn配位复合物开始，确保Pt和Sn之间的相互作用在还原和PDH反应期间得以保留。该催化剂具有原子混合的Pt-Sn前体，还原后形成非常小的互金属PtSn纳米粒子，以及避免分离和锡氧化物相形成的硅胶支持的良性相互作用。
