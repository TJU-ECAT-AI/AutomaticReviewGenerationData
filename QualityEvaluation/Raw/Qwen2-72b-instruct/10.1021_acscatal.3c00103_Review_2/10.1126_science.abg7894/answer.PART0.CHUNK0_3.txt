[1] "Stable and selective catalysts for propane dehydrogenation operating at thermodynamic limit Hitting the limits on propene synthesis The greater abundance of propane from shale gas has spurred efforts to use it as a propylene feedstock. Direct dehydrogenation catalysts consisting of platinumtin alloy nanoparticles supported on alumina often must run with hydrogen dilution to avoid carbon buildup and excess tin to avoid alloy segregation."
[2] "We report that silica-supported platinum-tin (Pt1Sn1) nanoparticles (<2 nanometers in diameter) can operate as a PDH catalyst at thermodynamically limited conversion levels, with excellent stability and selectivity to propylene (>99%). Atomic mixing of Pt and Sn in the precursor is preserved upon reduction and during catalytic operation. The benign interaction of these nanoparticles with the silicon dioxide support does not lead to Pt-Sn segregation and formation of a tin oxide phase that can occur over traditional catalyst supports."
[3] "To alleviate this issue, large quantities of Sn are used in the catalyst preparation (the nominal atomic loading is Sn:Pt between 4 and 5), which increases the yield of intermetallic PtSn NPs (12). In addition, studies have shown that adding hydrogen to the reactant feed reduces the rate of catalyst deactivation (13). Although this strategy is implemented commercially (10), addition of hydrogen in the feed lowers the thermodynamic limit on per-pass propane conversion (fig. S1) and decreases productivity (7)."
[4] "We developed a PDH catalyst that operates at thermodynamically limited conversion levels without the addition of hydrogen to the feed and exhibits excellent stability and selectivity to propylene (>99%). The catalyst is composed of silica-supported Pt1Sn1 NPs, synthesized and pretreated to ensure that the mixing of Pt and Sn is preserved during catalytic operation."

1.Recent advancements in catalyst design for direct dehydrogenation processes have focused on the development of stable and selective catalysts for propane dehydrogenation. These catalysts operate at thermodynamic limits, achieving high conversion levels and excellent stability and selectivity to propylene. The use of platinum-tin alloy nanoparticles supported on silica has been shown to prevent alloy segregation and carbon buildup, eliminating the need for hydrogen dilution and excess tin. The benign interaction of these nanoparticles with the silica support avoids the formation of a tin oxide phase, which can occur with traditional catalyst supports. This approach increases the yield of intermetallic PtSn NPs and reduces the rate of catalyst deactivation, leading to higher productivity and thermodynamic conversion levels without the addition of hydrogen to the feed.
