[1] "Although supported Pt catalysts show high activity, the catalyst deactivation due to coke formation remains a challenging issue."
[2] "The robustness against coking can be increased with additional promoters, such as late transition metals, main-group metals including Sn and Ga, alkali-metal oxides and rare-earth metal oxides."
[3] "It has been demonstrated for graphene islands on the Ni(111) surface, unsaturated C atoms at the edge of a graphene island are less stable than isolated C atoms on the metal surface."
[4] "A cheaper alternative is to alloy Ni with Sn which hinders the CC bond formation and enhances the CO bond formation leading to the removal of surface C centers as carbon monoxide."
[5] "Since the step sites play an essential role in the growth of the graphene islands, as mentioned above, additives such as potassium, sulfur, gold or boron have been proposed."
[6] "Apart from blocking the sub-surface sites, sub-surface boron in Ni(111) also has been shown to have an destabilizing effect on on-surface C centers, which may help to prevent the accumulation of C atoms on the surface."

1.Recent strategies to enhance the catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes include the use of additional promoters to increase robustness against coking. Late transition metals, main-group metals like Sn and Ga, alkali-metal oxides, and rare-earth metal oxides have been identified as potential promoters. For instance, alloying Ni with Sn can hinder CC bond formation and enhance CO bond formation, leading to the removal of surface C centers as carbon monoxide. Additives such as potassium, sulfur, gold, or boron can block the step sites that are crucial for the growth of graphene islands, thus preventing coking. Sub-surface boron in Ni(111) has also been shown to destabilize on-surface C centers, helping to prevent the accumulation of C atoms on the surface.

1.最近，为了增强直接脱氢过程中支撑金属催化剂的催化稳定性，开发了几种策略，包括使用额外的促进剂来增加对焦炭形成的抵抗力。晚期过渡金属，主族金属如锡和镓，碱金属氧化物和稀土金属氧化物已被确定为潜在的促进剂。例如，将镍与锡合金化可以阻止CC键的形成，增强CO键的形成，从而将表面C中心作为一氧化碳去除。钾、硫、金或硼等添加剂可以阻断对石墨烯岛生长至关重要的台阶位点，从而防止焦化。在Ni(111)中，亚表面硼也被证明可以破坏表面C中心的稳定性，有助于防止表面C原子的积累。
