[1] "To expose the loaded Pt on the surface of the carriers, ion exchange and impregnation are two simple and practical methods. The dispersion of Pt mainly depends on the precursors of Pt, the preparation conditions, the properties of the carriers, and the interaction between Pt and the carriers, as well as the additives."
[2] "The addition of a second metal has been found to be highly effective for the sintering resistance of Pt particles. The introduced metal forms alloys with Pt around Pt particles,63 and the alloys anchor them on the surface of the carriers, making them not easy to migrate and coalesce."
[3] "The application of the carriers possessing a strong interaction with Pt is another way to retard the sintering. Al2O3 is the most common carrier of Pt catalyst, in which the coordinatively unsaturated pentacoordinate Al3+ can anchor Pt to make it not easy to migrate."
[4] "Nanocarbon was also reported as the carrier of Pt to improve the sintering resistance, and the strong metalcarrier interaction leads to the electron transfer from nanocarbon to the Pt particles, significantly preventing the sintering of Pt."
[5] "MgAl2O4 spinel is also a good choice as the carrier. Generally, Pt is not directly loaded on MgAl2O4 spinel prepared beforehand, but firstly loaded into the spaces between the layers of MgAlOx hydrotalcite, and then Pt particles are enclosed in the interspace of MgAl2O4 spinel formed through the collapse of the layered structure of the hydrotalcite after calcination at high temperature."
[6] "Moliner et al.67 reported effective methods to encapsulate Pt in highly siliceous chabazite, and the catalyst showed enhanced stability towards Pt sintering even at 650750 C in the atmospheres of H2, O2 and H2O."
[7] "The Al2O3 overcoat has also proved to be efficient in preventing the sintering of Pt nanoparticles through atomic layer deposition."
[8] "Tanabe et al. revealed that no Pt sintering was observed for Pt/MgO as an automotive exhaust catalyst after calcination in air at 900 C, for the formation of a Mg2PtO4-like compound prevents the migration of Pt."
[9] "Nagai et al. found that CeO2 had a similar effect of MgO in preventing the sintering of Pt due to the formation of the PtOCe bond in the Pt/CeO2 catalyst."
[10] "Recently, Pt supported on CeO2 has attracted more attention because of the ability of CeO2 to trap Pt in an atomically dispersed state."
[11] "The atomically dispersed Pt is most likely to be present in the form of Pt2+ bonded to the ubiquitous step edges of the CeO2 surface."
[12] "The addition of Ga, In, Zn, Cu, Ir, Co to Pt catalysts exhibits similar effects as Sn."
[13] "Besides these metals, B and Si, two nonmetal elements, can play similar roles, too."
[14] "Dadras et al.86 called B a magic bullet against sintering and coking, and they summarized the positive roles of B as follows. The non-stoichiometric PtB cluster is anchored to the carrier via a covalent BO bond, which is much stronger than the interaction between Pt clusters and the carrier surface."
[15] "Additionally, the dissociation energy of a Pt atom from a PtB cluster is significantly larger than that from the pure Pt cluster, increasing the sintering resistance."
[16] "Finally, the affinity of PtB cluster to C also drops dramatically, leading to the reduced coke formation and increased selectivity to olefins."
[17] "Ha et al.48 also concluded that boration reduces the binding energy of olefins as well as the tendency towards coke precursors."
[18] "It is predicted by a computational screening of main-group elements as potential additives for the Pt catalyst that Si, just as B, can modify the selectivity of the Pt catalyst by changing both electronic and geometric properties."

1. Recent strategies to enhance the catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes include optimizing the dispersion of Pt on the surface of carriers through ion exchange and impregnation, using additives to form alloys with Pt to anchor it on the carrier surface, and selecting carriers with strong interaction with Pt to prevent migration and coalescence. Pt can be loaded into the spaces between the layers of MgAlOx hydrotalcite and enclosed in the interspace of MgAl2O4 spinel to prevent migration. Pt can also be encapsulated in highly siliceous chabazite or coated with Al2O3 through atomic layer deposition to prevent sintering. Pt/MgO and Pt/CeO2 have been found to prevent Pt sintering due to the formation of a Mg2PtO4-like compound and the PtOCe bond, respectively. Atomically dispersed Pt on CeO2 can also prevent sintering. Adding Ga, In, Zn, Cu, Ir, Co to Pt catalysts can have similar effects as Sn in improving stability. B and Si can also play similar roles in preventing sintering and coking. The non-stoichiometric PtB cluster anchored to the carrier via a covalent BO bond can prevent sintering and reduce coke formation. Boration can reduce the binding energy of olefins and the tendency towards coke precursors. Computational screening predicts that Si can modify the selectivity of the Pt catalyst by changing both electronic and geometric properties.

1. 添加第二种金属以与Pt粒子周围形成合金已被发现对Pt粒子的烧结抗性高度有效。这些合金将Pt粒子锚定在载体表面，使它们不易迁移和团聚。应用与Pt具有强相互作用的载体，如Al2O3，MgAl2O4尖晶石，纳米碳和CeO2，是另一种减缓烧结的方法。这些载体可以将Pt锚定，使其不易迁移，将Pt粒子封闭在尖晶石的间隙中，导致电子从载体转移到Pt粒子，并将Pt以原子分散状态捕获。添加第二种金属或选择合适的载体仅能减缓Pt的烧结速率。为了完全恢复活性，必须将烧结的Pt粒子再分散。在卤化物（通常是氯）的存在下，用空气再生催化剂，其作用是再分散烧结的Pt粒子。烧结的PtSn/CeO2催化剂可以通过在空气中燃烧焦炭而无需氧氯化来完全再生。添加Ga，In，Zn，Cu，Ir，Co到Pt催化剂上表现出与Sn相似的效果。通过简单的焦炭燃烧，反应性可以完全恢复，尽管Pt仍然发生烧结。向V-MCM-41催化剂中添加B可以进一步增强钒物种的分散性，并提高脱氢活性和对烯烃的选择性。添加La2O3或Y2O3可以有效增强Zrcus的形成，特别是后者表现出更活跃和选择性的脱氢性能。将微量的氢化活性金属Cu，Ru，Ni和Co加入到La2O3ZrO2催化剂中，由于通过原位还原ZrO2增加了Zrcus位点的浓度，脱氢活性进一步增加。引入Ba。表面四面体配位Ga的Ba覆盖导致焦炭形成减少和乙烯选择性增加。将Cu引入Pd催化剂可以增加Pd的分散性并提高活性和选择性，尽管PdCu/Al2O3的活性仅略高于Pt/Al2O3的一半。引入Sn有效地实现了Ni原子的分离，破坏了裂解的活性位点，同时Sn向Ni的电子捐赠发生，促进了形成烯烃的解吸。当Cu与Ni合金化时，CC键断裂的活性显著降低，这可能是由于烃中间体吸附减少所致。Ni基催化剂的硫化物比其磷化物具有更高的脱氢活性，并且在添加硫后，裂解反应得到有效抑制。向Ni基催化剂中添加P可以有效修改轻烷烃和环己烷的脱氢性能。将Cs引入Ni2P基催化剂中；在Ni2P/SiO2和Ni2P/活性炭催化剂上，异丁烯选择性高于96%和93%，同时异丁烷转化率增加，稳定性增强。将0.05 wt% Pd引入Sn/SiO2催化剂中可以明显抑制焦炭形成并增强催化剂的稳定性。

[1] "To expose the loaded Pt on the surface of the carriers, ion exchange and impregnation are two simple and practical methods. The dispersion of Pt mainly depends on the precursors of Pt, the preparation conditions, the properties of the carriers, and the interaction between Pt and the carriers, as well as the additives."
[2] "The addition of a second metal has been found to be highly effective for the sintering resistance of Pt particles. The introduced metal forms alloys with Pt around Pt particles,63 and the alloys anchor them on the surface of the carriers, making them not easy to migrate and coalesce."
[3] "The application of the carriers possessing a strong interaction with Pt is another way to retard the sintering. Al2O3 is the most common carrier of Pt catalyst, in which the coordinatively unsaturated pentacoordinate Al3+ can anchor Pt to make it not easy to migrate."
[4] "Nanocarbon was also reported as the carrier of Pt to improve the sintering resistance, and the strong metalcarrier interaction leads to the electron transfer from nanocarbon to the Pt particles, significantly preventing the sintering of Pt."
[5] "MgAl2O4 spinel is also a good choice as the carrier. Generally, Pt is not directly loaded on MgAl2O4 spinel prepared beforehand, but firstly loaded into the spaces between the layers of MgAlOx hydrotalcite, and then Pt particles are enclosed in the interspace of MgAl2O4 spinel formed through the collapse of the layered structure of the hydrotalcite after calcination at high temperature."
[6] "Moliner et al.67 reported effective methods to encapsulate Pt in highly siliceous chabazite, and the catalyst showed enhanced stability towards Pt sintering even at 650750 C in the atmospheres of H2, O2 and H2O."
[7] "The Al2O3 overcoat has also proved to be efficient in preventing the sintering of Pt nanoparticles through atomic layer deposition."
[8] "Tanabe et al. revealed that no Pt sintering was observed for Pt/MgO as an automotive exhaust catalyst after calcination in air at 900 C, for the formation of a Mg2PtO4-like compound prevents the migration of Pt."
[9] "Nagai et al. found that CeO2 had a similar effect of MgO in preventing the sintering of Pt due to the formation of the PtOCe bond in the Pt/CeO2 catalyst."
[10] "Recently, Pt supported on CeO2 has attracted more attention because of the ability of CeO2 to trap Pt in an atomically dispersed state."
[11] "The atomically dispersed Pt is most likely to be present in the form of Pt2+ bonded to the ubiquitous step edges of the CeO2 surface."
[12] "The addition of Sn to form small PtSn clusters results in a highly selective catalyst in propane dehydrogenation."
[13] "The deactivated PtSn/CeO2 catalyst can be regenerated fully by burning coke without oxychlorination to redisperse Pt."
[14] "The most important factor affecting the time between regenerations is the composition of the catalyst."
[15] "The addition of the second metal to form alloys with Pt and using the carrier without acidity can reduce the coke formed by deep dehydrogenation and polycondensation of hydrocarbons, respectively."
[16] "Improving the coking resistance of the catalyst is the most effective way to prolong the time between regenerations."
[17] "The optimization of reaction conditions can also help to lengthen the time between regenerations, such as the introduction of hydrogen or steam."
[18] "The additives are classified into two categories: one is alkali or alkaline earth metal oxides to neutralize the acidity of the carriers to lessen the side reactions catalyzed by acid sites44 and the other is metal or nonmetal elements to modify the properties of Pt."
[19] "The latter category will be discussed here."
[20] "So far, there are many metals, such as Sn,57,60,79 Fe,54 Ir,56 Co,54,62 Ni,54 Zn,26,52 Ga,28,53,80 In,81,82 and Cu,26 reported as the additives."
[21] "Among these metals, Sn is the most intensively studied and has been applied commercially for many years."
[22] "The function of Sn in the supported PtSn catalyst reflected via geometrical and/or electronic effects, can be summarized in the following four aspects."
[23] "Facilitating the dispersion of Pt In supported Pt catalysts, Sn separates large Pt particles into nanoparticles, and the formed bimetallic alloy phases are generally Pt3Sn and PtSn, resulting in small Pt particles or isolated Pt atoms."
[24] "Furthermore, a portion of Sn is atomically dispersed on the surface of the carrier, which will be the nucleation site for the redispersion of the sintered Pt during the regeneration process."
[25] "Improving olefin selectivity Cracking over Pt particles caused by the multipoint adsorption of hydrocarbons on multiple Pt atoms is a structure-sensitive reaction, so the addition of Sn to reduce Pt particle size inhibits the cleavage of CC bonds."
[26] "This is attributed to a geometrical effect."
[27] "It is generally believed that the increased olefin selectivity after Sn addition is due to the electron donation from Sn to Pt, which weakens the interaction between Pt and olefins."
[28] "Cybulskis et al.26 studied the similar effect of Zn addition, and pointed out that the promoting mechanism lies in the changes in the energy of Pt 5d electrons, rather than the electron occupancy due to electron donation as proposed previously."
[29] "This effectively reduces the binding energies of Pt and olefins, and thus increases the selectivity (see Fig. 2)."
[30] "For the electronic effect, density functional theory calculations have supplied some evidence."
[31] "Sn addition broadens the d-band of Pt and leads to a downshift in the d-band center of the PtSn alloy, decreasing the bonding strength of alkyl and olefins with the alloyed surfaces."
[32] "Anyway, the introduction of Sn reduces the energy barriers of olefin desorption and simultaneously increases the activation energy for deep dehydrogenation."
[33] "Accordingly, the selectivity to olefins is improved markedly."
[34] "Reducing coke formation and slowing down coking deactivation The mechanism of reducing coke by Sn addition is consistent with that of improving the selectivity of olefins, that is to weaken the interaction between Pt and olefins to inhibit the formation of the coke precursor."
[35] "Even if the coke precusor is formed, Sn may help to migrate it to the carrier."
[36] "Thus, the deactivation caused by the coverage of Pt particles with coke slows down."
[37] "Increasing sintering resistance The formation of alloys around Pt particles increases the migration resistance of Pt, and thus improves its sinter resistance."
[38] "Besides, Mg(Al)O hydrotalcite is also used to confine Pt in its lattice to improve the stability of the catalyst, while Zhu et al.60 employed a different approach to prepare the catalyst with good durability."
[39] "Mg(Sn)(Al)O hydrotalcite, a Sn containing layered double hydroxide was sythesized on Al2O3, and Sn bonded with Mg or Al (SnIV/IIOM) was dispersed atomically."
[40] "The loaded Pt dispersed homogeneously in small clusters and interacted strongly with the Sn sites confined in the lattice."
[41] "It was reported that the performance of Pt/Mg(Sn)(Al)O@Al2O3 catalyst was stable during 240 h TOS, but no reactivity data after regeneration were given."
[42] "The addition of Ga, In, Zn, Cu, Ir, Co to Pt catalysts exhibits similar effects as Sn."
[43] "PtGa/SiO2 containing isolated gallium sites display a high performance in propane dehydrogenation."
[44] "It is still controversial as to whether PtGa alloy or Ga2O3 contributes largely to the improved activity."
[45] "Not only that, but Sattler et al.84 showed that in the highly active, selective and stable PtGaK/Al2O3 (0.1 wt% Pt, 3 wt% Ga, 0.25 wt% K) catalyst for the dehydrogenation of propane, the coordinately unsaturated Ga3+ is responsible for activating the CH bond, and Pt only acts as a promoter."
[46] "Furthermore, just like the PtSn/CeO2 catalyst,29 the reactivity can be fully recovered via simple coke burning in air, although the sintering of Pt still occurs."
[47] "Located at the same main group with Ga, In was also reported to be the promoter of supported Pt catalysts."
[48] "The PtIn/Mg(Al)O catalyst prepared at pH 8 using the co-precipitation method exhibits the best catalytic performance and the strongest interaction between the metal phase and the carrier."
[49] "Liu et al.82 suggested that In addition into the PtSn/Al2O3 catalyst to form PtSn and PtIn alloys improves the catalytic performance further."
[50] "PtZn alloy particles supported on mesoporous silica via atomic layer deposition show better selectivity towards 1,3-butadiene for the deep dehydrogenation of n-butane than the PtSn/Al2O3 catalyst."
[51] "Cybulskis et al.26 concluded that the increased selectivity over PtZn and PtCu alloys is caused by the effective reduction of the binding energies of adsorbates."
[52] "Veldurthi et al.85 reported that the surface of Pt can be partially covered by Cu."
[53] "Ir can also be added into the supported Pt catalyst to improve the coking resistance; however, the Pt3Ir alloy is less active compared to the Pt3Sn alloy."
[54] "Bimetallic PtCo catalyst is highly selective to olefins due to the separation of large Pt ensembles into bimetallic nanoparticles by less active Co acting as the structural promoter."
[55] "Cai et al.54 prepared Pt-skin catalysts with Fe, Co or Ni atoms in subsurface regions using the co-impregnation method combined with post-acid leaching of the pre-reduced PtFe, PtCo or PtNi catalysts."
[56] "These Pt-skin catalysts present higher reactivity and selectivity in propane dehydrogenation than the monometallic Pt catalyst, and propylene selectivity increases in the order Pt < PtNi < PtCo < PtFe."
[57] "Besides these metals, B and Si, two nonmetal elements, can play similar roles, too."
[58] "Dehydrogenation of n-butane over the PtB/SiO2 catalyst showed improved catalytic activity and stability compared with Pt/SiO2."
[59] "This was attributed to the facilitated migration of alkyl groups from Pt catalytic sites to tetrahedrally coordinated B sites."
[60] "Dadras et al.86 called B a magic bullet against sintering and coking, and they summarized the positive roles of B as follows."
[61] "The non-stoichiometric PtB cluster is anchored to the carrier via a covalent BO bond, which is much stronger than the interaction between Pt clusters and the carrier surface."
[62] "Additionally, the dissociation energy of a Pt atom from a PtB cluster is significantly larger than that from the pure Pt cluster, increasing the sintering resistance."
[63] "Finally, the affinity of PtB cluster to C also drops dramatically, leading to the reduced coke formation and increased selectivity to olefins."
[64] "Ha et al.48 also concluded that boration reduces the binding energy of olefins as well as the tendency towards coke precursors."
[65] "It is predicted by a computational screening of main-group elements as potential additives for the Pt catalyst that Si, just as B, can modify the selectivity of the Pt catalyst by changing both electronic and geometric properties."
