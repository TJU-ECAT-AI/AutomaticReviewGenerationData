[1] "The addition of a second metal has been found to be highly effective for the sintering resistance of Pt particles. The introduced metal forms alloys with Pt around Pt particles,63 and the alloys anchor them on the surface of the carriers, making them not easy to migrate and coalesce."
[2] "The application of the carriers possessing a strong interaction with Pt is another way to retard the sintering. Al2O3 is the most common carrier of Pt catalyst, in which the coordinatively unsaturated pentacoordinate Al3+ can anchor Pt to make it not easy to migrate."
[3] "Nanocarbon was also reported as the carrier of Pt to improve the sintering resistance, and the strong metalcarrier interaction leads to the electron transfer from nanocarbon to the Pt particles, significantly preventing the sintering of Pt."
[4] "MgAl2O4 spinel is also a good choice as the carrier. Generally, Pt is not directly loaded on MgAl2O4 spinel prepared beforehand, but firstly loaded into the spaces between the layers of MgAlOx hydrotalcite, and then Pt particles are enclosed in the interspace of MgAl2O4 spinel formed through the collapse of the layered structure of the hydrotalcite after calcination at high temperature."
[5] "Moliner et al.67 reported effective methods to encapsulate Pt in highly siliceous chabazite, and the catalyst showed enhanced stability towards Pt sintering even at 650750 C in the atmospheres of H2, O2 and H2O."
[6] "The Al2O3 overcoat has also proved to be efficient in preventing the sintering of Pt nanoparticles through atomic layer deposition."
[7] "Tanabe et al. revealed that no Pt sintering was observed for Pt/MgO as an automotive exhaust catalyst after calcination in air at 900 C, for the formation of a Mg2PtO4-like compound prevents the migration of Pt."
[8] "Nagai et al. found that CeO2 had a similar effect of MgO in preventing the sintering of Pt due to the formation of the PtOCe bond in the Pt/CeO2 catalyst."
[9] "Recently, Pt supported on CeO2 has attracted more attention because of the ability of CeO2 to trap Pt in an atomically dispersed state."
[10] "The atomically dispersed Pt is most likely to be present in the form of Pt2+ bonded to the ubiquitous step edges of the CeO2 surface."
[11] "The deactivated PtSn/CeO2 catalyst can be regenerated fully by burning coke without oxychlorination to redisperse Pt."

1.Key strategies and approaches that have been recently developed to enhance the catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes include the addition of a second metal to form alloys with Pt around Pt particles, which anchor them on the surface of the carriers, making them not easy to migrate and coalesce. The application of carriers possessing a strong interaction with Pt, such as Al2O3, nanocarbon, MgAl2O4 spinel, and Al2O3 overcoat through atomic layer deposition, can also retard the sintering. Pt supported on CeO2 has attracted attention due to its ability to trap Pt in an atomically dispersed state, and the formation of a Mg2PtO4-like compound on Pt/MgO can prevent the migration of Pt. These advancements address the challenges in catalyst design, fabrication, and performance optimization for industrial applications by improving the sintering resistance of Pt particles and enhancing the stability of the catalyst.

1.最近开发的关键策略和方法包括添加第二种金属以与Pt粒子周围的Pt形成合金，这些合金将它们锚定在载体表面，使它们不易迁移和团聚。应用与Pt具有强相互作用的载体，如Al2O3、纳米碳、MgAl2O4尖晶石和通过原子层沉积的Al2O3覆盖层，也可以延缓烧结。由于CeO2能够将Pt捕获在原子分散状态，因此Pt/CeO2引起了关注。在Pt/MgO上形成Mg2PtO4样化合物可以防止Pt的迁移。这些进步通过提高Pt粒子的烧结抗性和增强催化剂的稳定性，解决了催化剂设计、制造和性能优化的工业应用挑战。
