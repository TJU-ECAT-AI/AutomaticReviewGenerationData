Abstract
Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is one of the most promising techniques to produce propylene. Industrial Pt-based catalysts often suffer from short-time stability under high temperature due to serious sintering and coke deposition via undesired side reactions. Detailed reaction mechanism on the surface of Pt-based nanoparticle has been well studied, while the subsurface effect remains mostly unstudied. Herein, supported PtGa nanoparticles with different surface and subsurface composition was evidenced by extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EAXFS) spectra and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS). Theoretical simulation demonstrated subsurface regulation would increase the electron density of surface Pt and thus weaken propylene adsorption. Propylene selectivity on the PtGa-subsurface nanoparticles was up to 98% at 600 °C while that on the Pt-subsurface nanoparticles was only 95%. Furthermore, rational designed PtGa alloy nanoparticles were encapsulated in MFI zeolite to inhibit sintering and coke deposition for enhanced catalytic stability.

Introduction
Propylene is one of the most important industrial raw materials used to produce polypropylene, propylene oxide, acrolein, acrylonitrile, etc. (1) The increasing worldwide propylene demand and the growing availability of propane from shale gas have promoted the development of propylene production technology via direct dehydrogenation. (2−11) Pt-based catalysts are widely applied in industrial PDH process such as UOP Oleflex, Uhde STAR process, and Linde/BASF PDH, thanks to their affinity for paraffinic C–H bonds. As a reversible endothermic process, high reaction temperature is essential to reach reasonable conversion level. Inevitably, Pt-based catalysts suffer from sintering under harsh reaction conditions and coke deposition by undesired side reactions, which forces us to rationally design the nanostructure.
Bimetallic catalysts, which generally exhibit different chemical properties compared to their parent metals, are widely applied to design new catalysts with enhanced catalytic performance. (12−16) For alkane dehydrogenation reaction on Pt-based catalysts, many efforts have been dedicated to the surface structural modulation of Pt-M (Sn, Ga, Zn, In, Cu, etc.) alloy. (17) Olsbye et al. reported that Sn selectively covered low coordination Pt sites and thus suppressed undesired hydrogenolysis reaction. (18,19) Zhu et al. proposed that high density of tin on the Pt nanoparticle surface enhanced PDH stability. (20) Corma et al. evidenced catalytic stability was significantly improved by prolonging prereduction time owing to the increased percentage of PtSn interaction as measured by the quasi in situ TEM. (4) Geometric and electronic effects resulted from the nanoparticle surface have been well studied. (21) Nevertheless, relatively few studies have identified subsurface effects on nanoparticles.
Subsurface regulation would change the electronic density of Pt surface, leading to improved catalytic activity in electrochemistry (22) and CO oxidation reaction. (23) Recently, Miller et al. prepared PtMn alloy with different subsurfaces by a sequential incipient wetness impregnation method. A Pt3Mn subsurface exhibited relative high propylene selectivity at 550 °C, because of low adsorbate binding energy and improved C–H activation selectivity. (24) Gong et al. synthesized Pt-3dTM (Fe, Co, Ni) bimetallic catalysts by co–impregnation together with post acid leaching treatments. (25) Theoretical calculations and catalytic tests evidenced the introduction of 3dTM in subsurface regions would downshift d-band center of platinum. It could weaken propylene adsorption and increase product selectivity. Thus, subsurface regulation will be a promising method for improved catalytic stability under harsh conditions. Furthermore, encapsulation is an efficient way to protect metal species from sintering through spatial confinement. (26−28) Fixing the rationally designed Pt nanostructure in zeolites could improve the catalytic stability. (3,4,16,29)
Herein, we examine the influence of subsurface regulation on core–shell nanoparticles and then improve the stability based on spatial confinement by silicalite-1 zeolite. PtGa alloy catalysts were commonly used for PDH, (30−35) but suffer from relatively low propylene selectivity and stability. Thus, Pt/Ga-MFI was prepared by Pt impregnated on Ga-containing MFI zeolite (Ga-MFI). Sequential calcination and high temperature reduction treatment were applied to prepare Pt core–PtGa shell alloy supported on MFI zeolite. PtGa/MFI was synthesized by a PtGa co–impregnation method. The formation of different subsurface composition was evidenced through detailed characterizations such as TEM and EAXFS spectra. Theoretical calculations and catalytic test demonstrated that subsurface regulation would result in d-band center shifting, thus decreasing the desorption energy of propylene to increase the target product selectivity. Furthermore, rationally designeded PtGa alloy nanoparticles were encapsulated in zeolite to improve stability.
Experimental Section
Chemical and Materials
In this work, tetrapropylammonium hydroxide solution (TPAOH, 25 wt % in H2O) and tetraethylorthosilicate (TEOS, > 99%) were purchased from J&K Scientific Ltd. and Kemiou Reagent Co Ltd., respectively. Chloroplatinic acid hexahydrate with the purity of 99% was purchased from Sino Platinum metals Co. Ltd. Gallium nitrate hydrate (99.99%) and tetraammineplatinum(II) nitrate (99%) were both purchased from J&K Scientific Ltd.
Catalyst Preparation
Silicalite-1 Catalyst
Nanosized silicalite-1 (S-1) zeolite catalyst was prepared under hydrothermal condition. The molar composition was 1.0 SiO2: 35 H2O: 0.4 TPAOH. (36) At first, mix 6.5 g TPAOH solution with deionized water under stirring condition. Add 4.16 g TEOS dropwise and continue stirring for 6 h, and then transfer the resulting gel in a Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave (50 mL) and place in an oven at 170 °C for 4 days. Then wash the samples with water and ethyl alcohol each for three times, dried at 100 °C for 12 h, and then calcined at 550 °C for 6 h.
PtGa@MFI and Ga-MFI Catalyst
PtGa@MFI was prepared with the molar composition of 1.0 SiO2: 35 H2O: 0.4 TPAOH: 0.0015 Pt(NH3)4(NO3)2: 0.008 Ga(NO3)3 by the same method for the synthetic procedure of silicalite-1 zeolite expect introducing platinum and gallium source. Metal precursor was synthesized by dissolving 0.1 g gallium(III) nitrate hydrate and 0.024 g tetraammineplatinum nitrate in 3 mL H2O. The metal solution was dripped into silica gel and stirred for half an hour. The following experimental steps are the same as those of the synthesis of Silicalite—1 zeolite. Similarly, Ga-MFI was synthesized by same procedure without introducing platinum source.
PtGa/MFI, Pt/MFI Catalyst and Pt/Ga-MFI
PtGa/MFI and Pt/MFI were prepared by incipient-wetness impregnation (IWI) method. For PtGa/MFI, 1.0 g Silicalite-1 catalyst was mixed with the solution, which was composed of 0.013 g H2PtCl6·6H2O, 0.086 g gallium(III) nitrate hydrate, and deionized water. The resulting samples were dried at 100 °C overnight and then calcined at 550 °C for 8 h. Similarly, Pt/MFI was synthesized by a same procedure without introducing gallium source. Pt/Ga-MFI was also prepared by IWI method. The synthesis process was similar to that of Pt/MFI, and only changed the support as Ga-MFI.
Catalyst Characterization
Zeolite were embedded cured with epoxy resin. Add some sample into the bottom of the centrifuge tube with the embedding agent. Use a toothpick to mix the powder and embedding agent uniformly, and polymerize at 70 °C overnight to make a series of ultrathin slices. the samples were characterized by transmission electron microscope, which were conducted on a Talos F200 microscope.
Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) was carried on a Philips X’Pert MPD diffractometer using Cu Kα (γ = 1.5406 Å) radiation at 40 kV and 40 mA in the 2θ range of 5–60° with a scan rate of 8°/min.
X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS) was executed on a Thermo ESCALAB 250XI instrument. Accurate binding energy was obtained by adjusting the position of the adventitious C 1s peak at 284.6 eV
The X-ray absorption fine structure spectra (Pt L3-edge and Ga K-edge) were collected at 1W1B station in Beijing Synchrotron Radiation Facility (BSRF) (Details in the Supporting Information (SI)). Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) spectra of CO adsorption was conducted on a Bruker FT-IR spectrophotometer. The sample was pretreated under vacuum condition (10-5 Pa) at 400 °C for an hour. CO was purged into the apparatus for half an hour at 50 °C. Then purged with Ar to flush IR cell and FTIR spectra were sequentially obtained.
The surface area and pore volume were conducted by N2 physisorption experiments on a Micomeritics ASAP 2420 volumetric adsorption analyzer at −196 °C. Before measurement, the samples were preheated under vacuum at 300 °C for 12 h. Elemental analysis characterization was quantified by an inductively coupled plasma-optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES, Optima 2100DV).
Catalyst Evaluation
Propane dehydrogenation was tested in a fixed bed reactor. 0.2 g sample and 2.0 g silicon carbide (20–40 mesh) were mixed thoroughly and transferred into a stainless-steel tube (10 mm i.d.). Before reaction, samples were reduced at 600 °C for 2 h under H2–N2 mixture (H2 5 mL/min and N2 45 mL/min). And then with the reactant mixture (40 mL/min, C3H8: H2: N2 = 1:1:2). The products were analyzed on an online gas chromatograph (Shimadzu GC-2010).
Results and Discussions
Catalyst Characteristics
Zeolites with ordered microporous structure and superior thermal stability were ideal supports for fixing metal species. (37−41)Figure 1a,d showed the tomogram-section structure of PtGa@MFI and PtGa/MFI. This technology provides the sectioned view of the crystal, and refrains from the adverse impact of external MNPs (42−46) (as illustrated by SI Figure S1). In the TEM tomographic images of PtGa@MFI, PtGa MNPs could be observed, providing direct proof that PtGa MNPs were encapsulated in the MFI crystals. The mean size of PtGa NMPs was retained at 2.8 nm after H2 reduction, larger than MFI zeolite micropores. It indicated that small PtGa NMPs crossed the channels and were fixed in zeolites after H2 reduction at 700 °C. And the lattice distance was 0.286 nm, which could be ascribed to PtGa (111) plane (Figure 1b). Meanwhile, the mean size of PtGa NMPs located on the zeolite surface was 6.7 and 6.8 nm in PtGa/MFI and Pt/Ga-MFI, respectively. The core–shell structure of Pt/Ga-MFI was evidenced by point scans. One of the larger PtGa nanoparticles was collected (Figure 1h). Local Ga/Pt ratio in the core and shell region was detected by EDS characterization (Figure 1i). The mole percentage of Ga detected near the side surface of the nanoparticle (the red point) was 37.8%, much higher than that of the core region (4.5%, blue point), demonstrating the PtGa alloy located near the surface while Pt localized in the core.

(h) local Ga ratio along the side surface and subsurface of the nanoparticle for Pt/Ga-MFI sample measured by (i) EDS signal counts on different spots of the Pt/Ga-MFI sample.
The crystal structure of all metal–supported zeolites was confirmed by XRD after calcination and reduction at high temperature. Figure 2a exhibited well-crystallized zeolite as typical MFI topology even after high temperature calcination and reduction. Besides MFI zeolite diffraction peaks, the characteristic peaks of Pt and Pt–Ga nanoparticles were observed between 2θ = 39° and 45° in Figure 2b. Before reduction, all the samples showed the diffraction peak at 2θ = 39.8°, corresponding to the Pt (111) crystal plane (JCPDS no. 04-0802). For reduced PtGa/MFI and PtGa@MFI sample, the peaks were shifted to 2θ = 40.6°, which can be assigned to PtGa (210) crystal plane. Ga was reduced from zeolite framework to form PtGa alloy after high temperature reduction treatment, resulting their smaller average lattice constants. (24) The PtGa alloy peak intensity of PtGa@MFI was much lower than that of PtGa/MFI, demonstrating that the particle size of PtGa MNPs encapsulated in MFI zeolite channels was small with low crystallinity. Meanwhile, the characteristic peak of reduced Pt/Ga-MFI was at 2θ = 40.2°, which was in the middle of Pt (111) and PtGa (210), suggesting it includes Pt and PtGa phase. The peaks were broader than that of reduced Pt/MFI and PtGa/MFI, which may imply larger microstrain characteristic of a coherent two-phase lattice, as expected for core–shell structures.

To study the electronic property and valence state of metal MNPs on the surface, Pt 4f and Ga 2p XPS spectra of as-prepared samples was performed. According to the ICP-OES measurement (SI Table S1), all the samples presented similar Pt and Ga metal loading amounts. In Figure 2c, the Pt 4f peak intensity of PtGa/MFI and Pt/Ga-MFI was also approximate, demonstrating basically the same Pt content on the MFI surface. The Ga proportion in PtGa alloy of PtGa/MFI was much higher than that of Pt/Ga-MFI, mainly owing to higher surface Ga content (Figure S2). XPS spectra also showed relative high binding energy in the Pt 4f XPS spectra. It could be ascribed to the formation of PtGa alloy phase, leading to increased electron density of surface Pt. Besides that, the Pt 4f peak of PtGa@MFI was very weak (SI Figure S3), indicating that the PtGa alloy encapsulated in zeolite channels was hard to be detected by the surface technology.
To further verify the detailed electronic structures of PtGa nanoparticles in the as-synthesized catalysts, X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) and CO adsorbed Fourier-transform infrared (CO-FTIR) measurements were performed. Compared with the reduced PtGa catalysts to Pt/MFI and Pt foil, Pt L3 edge X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES showed a slight increase of edge energy and a decrease of white line owing to the incorporation of Ga (Figure 2d). PtGa/MFI exhibited even larger changes of edge energy than Pt/Ga-MFI, owing to higher Ga ratio in PtGa alloy nanoparticles. The first-coordination peak of PtGa catalysts displayed a slight shift in R space than that of Pt foil (Figure 2e). With the increase of Ga content, the Pt L3-edge EAXFS spectra exhibit decreasing Pt–Pt scattering intensity. The fitting results of the Pt L3-edge of EXAFS spectra of various catalysts were listed in Table 1. For PtGa/MFI, the coordination numbers (CN) of Pt–Pt and Pt–Ga bonds were 8.1 and 3.5, respectively. PtGa alloy could be assigned to Pt3Ga intermetallic phase because the Pt–Pt and Pt–Ga bond lengths are almost same with 3:1 ratio of the coordination number. Meanwhile, for core–shell particle catalyst Pt/Ga-MFI, the coordination number of Pt–Ga bonds was 0.8 and the ratio of Pt–Pt/Pt–Ga was 10.8. It indicates that the Ga ratio in the PtGa particle of Pt/Ga-MFI is obviously lower than that of PtGa/MFI, further evidence its core–shell structure. The WT-EXAFS contour plots of Pt L3 edge exhibited the k-axis location of the scattering center shifted to lower value with the increase Ga/Pt ratio (SI Figure S4). For PtGa@MFI, the CN ratio of Pt–Pt/Pt-Ga was similar to that PtGa/MFI. It demonstrates the coordination environment of Pt in PtGa@MFI is similar to PtGa/MFI, but with a smaller particle size owing to lower CNs of Pt–Pt and Pt–Ga, which is consistent with TEM results. The Ga K-edge XANES energies of all PtGa catalysts roughly resemble that of Ga oxide (SI Figure S5). The fitting results of Ga K-edge of EXAFS spectra of various catalysts are listed in SI Table S1. The peak at ∼1.80 Å is ascribed to Zn–O with a coordination number of ∼4.0 at the Ga K-edge. It indicates that Ga species mainly involve GaPt alloy and single-site Ga3+ ions connecting with the framework oxygen in MFI zeolite.

S02 were set as 0.84 for Pt–O/Pt-Pt, which were calculated from the experimental EXAFS fit of reference PtO2/Pt foil by fixing CN as the known crystallographic value and. The fit of the Pt L3-edge EXAFS spectra of samples are shown in Figure S6.
For CO-FTIR, the peak at 2150∼2000 cm–1 could be attributed to linearly adsorbed CO on Pt atom (Figure 2f). The incorporation of Ga resulted in a red shift (∼7∼8 cm–1) of the CO stretching frequency, likely because of the electron transfer from Ga to Pt in PtGa alloy phase. (35) Meanwhile, the weak at 1850 cm–1 was also detected, ascribing to the bridged CO bonded on adjacent Pt atoms. For PtGa/MFI, the doping of Ga with Pt weakened the bridged CO peak, attributing to the dilution of Pt particle, which results in the segregation of continuous Pt island into isolated Pt atoms. (47) The bridged CO peak intensity of Pt/Ga-MFI was between that of Pt/MFI and PtGa/MFI, further evidenced that it contained both Pt and PtGa phase simultaneously.
As shown in SI Table S2, based on the N2 adsorption–desorption results (SI Figure S7), all catalysts possessed high surface area (SBET ∼of about 400 m2/g) and large pore volume (Vt ∼of about 0.1 cm3/g). All samples showed type-I isotherms, demonstrating a microporous framework. The pore size distribution of encapsulated catalyst PtGa@MFI was similar to that of supported catalysts. The metal particles larger than zeolite micropores may cause some defects (such as mesopore) inside zeolites during high temperature calculation and reduction, but has little influence. Compared to the conventional silicalite-1 zeolite, a decrease in micropore of 10∼30 m2/g was found on metal loaded zeolite. It demonstrates that PtGa MNPs occupied some pores of zeolites. Nevertheless, as inferred from the reaction data, all the samples offer sufficient void space for reactants transfer. (36,48)
Catalytic Measurement
Figure 3a showed propylene selectivity vs propane conversion at 600 °C on PDH reaction over as-prepared samples. The propylene selectivity of Pt/MFI dropped from 92% to 66% with the conversion increased (SI Figure S8). It was mainly ascribed to the hydrogenolysis reaction, which resulted C–C cleavage especially in the presence of hydrogen as previous reports. (24,49) In contrast, for Pt/Ga-MFI catalyst, propylene selectivity was basically stable at about 95%, higher than that of Pt/MFI. The introduction of Ga increases the electron density and thus decrease the desorption energy of propylene. And Ga selectively covers low coordination sites of Pt which leads to the side reaction such as hydrogenolysis. Comparing PtGa (PtGa/MFI) to PtGa-s (Pt/Ga-MFI) discloses a distinct subsurface effect that is independent from the surface structure. Propylene selectivity of PtGa/MFI and PtGa@MFI was stable above 98%. The hydrogenolysis reaction was almost completely inhabited on PtGa alloy, which may be attributed to quite low binding energy of C3H6* by subsurface regulation.

The adsorption energies of the adsorbed species on different catalysts can provide an auxiliary explanation on the changes of activity and selectivity. Based on previous characterization, the active sites of Pt/Ga-MFI and PtGa/MFI were simplified to PtGa-s and PtGa particle. Therefore, the catalytic models of Pt (111), Pt3Ga-s (111) and Pt3Ga (111) surface were selected for comparison. Theoretical calculations have proposed that the d-band center of surface Pt would be downshift caused by composition regulated in surface and subsurface, leading to weak adsorption on Pt surface. (24,25,50) In Figure 3b and SI Figure S9, the d-band center of Pt was observed to shift from −1.90 (Pt) to −2.22 eV (PtGa-s) by changing the surface composition. The d-band center of PtGa shifted to −2.68 eV when further regulated the subsurface structure. As a result, the binding energy of propylene decreased from −0.93 eV on a pure Pt (111) surface to −0.63 eV on Pt3Ga-s and −0.51 eV on Pt3Ga surface. The decrease of propylene adsorption strength is related to electronic effect which makes the d-states deviate from the Fermi level.
The calculated potential energy landscape for PDH reaction on Pt, PtGa-s and PtGa model is shown in Figure 3c. We simulated the energies of intermediate species, and gaseous C3H8 was as the reference point. The molecularly bound C3H8 to metal species have an adsorption energy of −0.05 eV on Pt(111) surface, similar to that on Pt3Ga-s (−0.18 eV) and Pt3Ga (−0.10 eV) surface, which are all physical adsorption. The optimized structures of each step and the structures of transition states were shown in SI Figure S10. In previous theoretical studies, PDH activity is related to the first dehydrogenation barrier. (51) The dehydrogenation barriers of first step, C3H8* → 1–C3H7*+0.5H2 was 0.78 eV. Adding Gallium atoms in surface and subsurface regions leads to higher barriers for first dehydrogenation step. The energy barrier on Pt3Ga-s and Pt3Ga are 0.85 and 0.94 eV, separately, higher than that on Pt. Besides that, propylene selectivity could be described by the difference between propylene desorption and its further dehydrogenation barrier. On pure Pt (111), the desorption energy of C3H6 was 0.93 eV while the C3H6* possessed a barrier energy of 0.54 eV for C–H scission. It indicates the deep dehydrogenation step of C3H6 is more favorable than propylene desorption. On the PtGa surface, the desorption energy of C3H6* decreased obviously (from 0.93 eV to 0.63 and 0.51 eV), lower than the barrier energies of C–H scission (0.70 and 0.74 eV). Thus, PtGa particles with PtGa subsurface exhibited high propylene selectivity and sufficient dehydrogenation activity.
The stability of prepared catalysts under high temperature (at 600 °C) was tested by long-term PDH in Figure 3d. It mainly discussed the effect of metal loading position with similar alloy structure. For PtGa/MFI, the conversion rapidly decreased from 28% to 12% in 6 h. The PtGa alloy supported on the zeolite surface suffered from severe sintering and coke deposition, resulting in decreased active sites. In contrast, propane conversion of PtGa@MFI retained above 14% even after 20 h. And the propylene selectivity was stable above 98.5%. Thus, the propylene selectivity and stability was improved under high temperature reaction condition.
Spent Catalysts
Spent catalysts were characterized to investigate the relationship between the improved catalytic performance and the structure of PtGa@MFI. TGA measurements of the spent catalysts were conducted the quantify the content of coke deposition in Figure 4a,b. The mass loss before 300 °C was primarily caused by adsorbed water in zeolites. Besides that, the weight loss of encapsulated catalyst PtGa@MFI was only 0.20%, less than that of the impregnated PtGa/MFI and Pt/Ga-MFI (0.26% and 0.30%). PtGa/MFI catalyst showed less coke deposition than Pt/Ga-MFI due to lower propylene desorption energy, leading to less coke precursor. Besides that, encapsulated catalysts showed less coke deposition than that of impregnated catalysts. It could be attributed to zeolite channel confinement environment. The adsorption configuration of propylene tended to be π-mode with lower desorption energy and the polymerization of coke precursor was inhibited.

To further investigate the stability of catalyst structure, TEM micrographs of spent catalysts were conducted and no obvious carbon deposition was observed (Figure 4c–e). The metal particle size of PtGa/MFI and Pt/Ga-MFI increased owing to the aggregation and sintering of the metal species under harsh reaction condition. In contrast, the mean particle size of spent PtGa@MFI was 2.6 nm, nearly unchanged compared with fresh catalyst. The metal species encapsulated in zeolite could be protected from sintering and maintained small particle size. Thus, PtGa@MFI exhibited high propylene selectivity and catalytic stability.
Conclusions
In summary, we first prepared PtGa alloy catalyst with different subsurface composition. A PtGa alloy subsurface instead of monometal Pt increased the electron density of surface Pt active site, and thus decrease the desorption energy of propylene to increase the C3H6 selectivity. For Pt/Ga-MFI catalyst, propylene selectivity was basically stable at about 95% at 600 °C, whereas propylene selectivity of PtGa/MFI was stable above 98%. Furthermore, we conducted an in situ ligand-stabilized method to encapsualte the subsurface-regulated PtGa alloy in the Silicalite-1 zeolite. PtGa alloy with a smaller particle size was fixed in zeolite channels to inhibit sintering under high temperature (600 °C). Catalytic activity and stability were improved simultaneously, and this design strategy could be applied in other high temperature reactions like reforming reaction.
