Abstract
Supported metal nanoparticles are vital as heterogeneous catalysts in the chemical transformation of hydrocarbon resources. The catalytic properties of these materials are governed by the surface electronic structure and valence orbitals at the active metal site and can be selectively tuned with promoters or by alloying. Through an integrated approach using density functional theory (DFT), kinetics, and in situ X-ray spectroscopies, we demonstrate how Zn addition to Pt/SiO2 forms high symmetry Pt1Zn1 nanoparticle alloys with isolated Pt surface sites that enable near 100% C2H4 selectivity during ethane dehydrogenation (EDH) with a 6-fold higher turnover rate (TOR) per mole of surface Pt at 600 °C compared to monometallic Pt/SiO2. Furthermore, we show how DFT calculations accurately reproduce the resonant inelastic X-ray spectroscopic (RIXS) signatures of Pt 5d valence orbitals in the Pt/SiO2 and PtZn/SiO2 catalysts that correlate with their kinetic performance during EDH. This technique reveals that Zn modifies the energy of the Pt 5d electrons in PtZn, which directly relates to TOR promotion, while ensemble effects from the incorporation of Zn into the catalyst surface lead to enhanced product selectivity.

Introduction
The recent surge in gas production from shale formations throughout the United States presents a tremendous opportunity to develop catalytic innovations that efficiently transform hydrocarbon resources (i.e., methane, ethane, propane, butanes) directly into value-added chemicals and fuels with reduced environmental impact by selectively activating paraffinic C–H bonds. (1) Although various routes to synthesize alkene and aromatic building block molecules over metal-containing catalysts by dehydrogenation (2) and cyclization, (3) respectively, have been well-studied, fundamental understanding of issues regarding long-term catalyst stability, product selectivity, and turnover rates (TOR) still remain problematic. (4, 5) Many of the challenges associated with developing new materials to overcome these limitations can only be addressed at the molecular level.
Noble metals, such as Pt, are well-known for exceptional performance in hydrocarbon catalysis, particularly for hydrogenation and isomerization reactions, due to their affinity for paraffinic C–H bonds. (2) Since the reactivity of metal nanoparticle surfaces is determined by the electronic states through the valence d bands, which is a region in the partial density of states (DOS), (6, 7) one way we may alter the electronic structure of these surfaces, and hence, their reactivity, is by alloying of the surface with various promoters that can influence the availability and energies of the valence electrons to form chemical bonds with adsorbates. For example, the addition of Zn or Sn to Pt-containing catalysts has led to improved alkene selectivity during alkane dehydrogenation. (8-10) It has been suggested that these ad-metals modify the electronic properties of the noble metal sites by donating electron density and weakening the adsorption of π-bonded alkenes; thus, inhibiting the formation of coke precursors. (10-13) Yet, the energy levels of the d states of Pt and Pt-containing alloys, which also direct bond formation, have seldom been directly measured experimentally.
While structure-insensitive reactions, such as alkene hydrogenation and alkane dehydrogenation, can occur on isolated Pt sites, it has been shown that larger Pt ensembles catalyze structure-sensitive reactions, including cracking and hydrogenolysis. (14-18) Recent experimental work by Childers et al. (19) has also shown that Zn addition to supported Pd catalysts can enhance propylene selectivity during propane dehydrogenation (PDH). The improved catalyst stability is attributed to the formation of a PdZn alloy with isolated Pd surface sites that eliminate the structure-sensitive hydrogenolysis pathway. (20) Similar conclusions regarding the importance of active site isolation (i.e., geometric effects) have been reported for SiO2-supported PdIn (21) and PtIn (22) intermetallic alloys during ethane dehydrogenation (EDH).
Experimentally, the electronic structure of metal nanoparticles on heterogeneous catalysts can be accessed by using L edge, resonant inelastic X-ray scattering (RIXS) to monitor the energy of the d-band filled and unfilled states. (23-25) As a hard X-ray, two-photon process, RIXS permits the elucidation of electron excitations between inner-shell and valence levels within a specific element under working reaction conditions, thus making it possible to directly probe the surface chemistry at metal active sites and map the entire d-band spectrum to identify electronic descriptors of catalytic activity. As shown for the Pt L3 edge in Scheme 1, absorption of a photon with energy Ω promotes a 2p electron to an unoccupied state in the 5d valence shell and leaves behind a core hole that is subsequently refilled by an electron from filled orbitals. Filling of the core hole results in an emitted photon whose energy is dependent on the energy of the filled orbital. With a high-energy resolution spectrometer, the energy (ω) of the fluorescent photon from the filled 5d orbital can be determined (e.g., Pt Lβ5 transition). The difference in energy between Ω and ω represents the overall energy transfer of the system (ΔE).
Scheme 1
Scheme 1. RIXS Energy Scheme for Pt 2p ↔ 5d Transitions
Many of the valence-to-core X-ray emission studies to date have been focused on the K edge (s → p) for inorganic and bioinorganic metal complexes to examine metal-to-ligand charge transfer as well as changes in bonding and antibonding states. (26) However, the K edge cannot access chemical information on the valence d electrons that are relevant for catalysis. While RIXS has successfully been applied at the L edge for 3d and 4d transition metal complexes to examine crystal field splitting and orbital occupancy, (27-29) there are relatively few studies on 5d metals, (24, 30, 31) such as Pt, that examine the electronic structure of supported noble metal nanoparticles.
Here, by using in situ X-ray absorption and synchrotron X-ray diffraction, we show that Pt1Zn1 intermetallic alloy nanoparticles are preferentially formed from Pt and Zn precursors on an amorphous SiO2 support. These bimetallic alloy catalysts contain isolated surface Pt atoms with only metallic Zn nearest neighbors and display high ethylene selectivity (∼100%) during EDH at 600 °C. We also show how the capabilities of RIXS analysis can provide a unique fingerprint for the catalytic properties of Pt/SiO2 and PtZn/SiO2 dehydrogenation catalysts. This spectroscopic characterization of metal nanoparticle electronic valence states can be coupled with kinetic measurements of catalytic performance to describe how Zn addition to Pt/SiO2 modifies the metal nanoparticle electronic structure to affect the EDH TOR. Last, we suggest that DFT RIXS calculations for Pt-containing alloy compositions provide additional electronic structural information, thereby complementing and strengthening existing d-band models.
Results and Discussion
Ethane Dehydrogenation on Pt/SiO2 and PtZn/SiO2
The Pt/SiO2 and PtZn/SiO2 catalysts for this study were prepared by pH-controlled incipient wetness impregnation (pH-IWI) of high-purity SiO2 with (NH3)4Pt(NO3)2 and Zn(NO3)2·6H2O precursors to obtain 9.70 wt % Pt for Pt/SiO2 and 9.28 wt % Zn and 9.53 wt % Pt for PtZn/SiO2. A high Pt loading was required in order to obtain sufficient signal-to-noise during in situ RIXS experiments due to the relatively weak intensity of the valence 5d5/2 → 2p3/2 (Lβ5) X-ray emission line for Pt. Pt dispersions based on the measured H2 uptake (Table S1) on the freshly reduced Pt/SiO2 and PtZn/SiO2 catalysts were determined to be 27% and 44%, respectively. Catalyst testing was performed at 600 °C in a gas mixture of 2.5% C2H6, 1% H2, and 0.5% C2H4 to achieve differential C2H6 conversion (X < 0.1) and allow the reaction rate to be treated as constant throughout the reactor (section 3, Supporting Information).
As shown in Figure 1a, the EDH TOR, normalized per surface Pt atom, for Pt/SiO2 (blue closed circles) stabilized at 0.01 s–1 after 5 h on stream from a starting value of 0.05 s–1. During this period, the C2H4 selectivity reached 96% (X = 0.09) from a starting value of 74% (X = 0.4) as shown in Figure 1b (blue closed circles). Following the catalyst stabilization, the apparent activation energy between 570 and 600 °C was determined to be 72 ± 4 kJ mol–1 (Figure S1). At the start of the run, the carbon mass balance closed at 83%, indicating significant coke deposition on the clean catalyst surface, and then ultimately reached 100% after the stabilization period. This result, along with observed CH4 formation during the reaction, shows that C2H6 hydrogenolysis and C2H4 decomposition reactions occur concomitantly with dehydrogenation on Pt. For PtZn/SiO2, the EDH TOR per surface Pt was a factor of 6 higher than on Pt/SiO2, as indicated by the red closed squares in Figure 1a, and reached 0.06 s–1 after 12 h from a starting value of 0.2 s–1. Throughout the stabilization period, the C2H4 selectivity (Figure 1b) and carbon mass balance both remained near 100% indicating that dehydrogenation occurs almost exclusively on PtZn. The measured apparent activation energy for PtZn/SiO2 was 99 ± 5 kJ mol–1 (Figure S1) and is similar to the 102 kJ mol–1 result reported by Galvita et al. (17) for PtSn/Mg(Al)O. Metal cluster size distributions on the used Pt/SiO2 and PtZn/SiO2 samples after EDH at 600 °C were analyzed from HAADF-STEM and TEM images and determined to be 3.3 ± 1.9 nm and 2.5 ± 0.6 nm, respectively (Figures S2–S4).

(b) C2H4 selectivities as a function of time on stream during EDH at 600 °C. (c) C2H4 selectivities as a function of C2H6 conversion during EDH (2.5% C2H6, 1% H2) at 600 °C for 9.70 wt % Pt/SiO2 (blue open circles) and 9.53 wt % Pt–9.28 wt % Zn/SiO2 (red open squares).
When C2H4 was removed from the reaction feed stream (Figure 1a), the TOR for both Pt/SiO2 (blue open circles) and PtZn/SiO2 (red open squares) increased by a factor of 2, which indicates that C2H4 inhibits the EDH reaction by competing with C2H6 for Pt surface sites. As shown in Figure 1b, the C2H4 selectivities for both Pt/SiO2 and PtZn/SiO2 were comparable to EDH with C2H4 cofed in the reaction mixture. At low C2H6 conversion (X < 0.1), the C2H4 selectivity on Pt/SiO2 was similar to PtZn/SiO2 but decreased to less than 50% at conversions above the equilibrium limit for dehydrogenation (Xeq = 0.54) as concomitant C–C bond cleavage reactions became dominant (Figure 1c). Conversely, PtZn/SiO2 was able to maintain near 100% selectivity to C2H4 up to the thermodynamically limited equilibrium conversion, indicating that the active Pt surface sites are able to suppress cracking and hydrogenolysis reactions, even with H2 (produced during EDH) present in the reactor.
Geometric Structures of Pt and PtZn Nanoparticles
The Pt and PtZn nanoparticle structures were determined by using in situ X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) and synchrotron X-ray diffraction (XRD). The X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) at the Pt L3 edge (E = 11 564 eV) shows that the supported Pt nanoparticles on Pt/SiO2 were metallic (Pt0), as evidenced by the similar edge positons (defined as the inflection point of the leading edge, which is determined from the maximum of the first derivative of the experimental XANES spectrum) and white-line intensities between the Pt foil and the Pt/SiO2 catalyst (Figure S5). The Pt atoms in PtZn/SiO2 were also metallic, and the edge energy increased as a result of Zn addition by 0.9 eV compared to Pt/SiO2. Although the shape of the Pt L3 XANES for metallic nanoparticles below approximately 3 nm in diameter exhibits slight differences compared to that for Pt foil, the edge energy is not changed. (32) Thus, changes in the edge energy can only be attributed to the formation of bimetallic PtZn nanoparticles. The in situ extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) spectrum (black open circles) and fit of the isolated first scattering shell for 9.70 wt % Pt/SiO2 (blue dashed line) in the top half of Figure 2a revealed that the metallic Pt nanoparticles on Pt/SiO2 are structurally similar to the bulk Pt foil (black open triangles) and that each Pt atom was surrounded by an average of 8.9 ± 0.9 Pt nearest neighbors at a bond distance of 2.76 ± 0.01 Å. On the basis of the metal dispersion correlation reported by Miller et al., (33) the average Pt cluster size on Pt/SiO2 was 4.2 ± 1.1 nm, consistent with the 3.3 ± 1.9 nm cluster size distribution from HAADF-STEM and TEM images of the used catalyst after EDH (Figures S2 and S4a).

(b) In situ XRD patterns obtained for 9.70 wt % Pt/SiO2 and 9.53 wt % Pt–9.28 wt % Zn/SiO2 at room temperature and compared to simulated patterns for Pt and Pt1Zn1, respectively.

For PtZn/SiO2, each Pt atom was surrounded by an average of approximately seven Zn nearest neighbors (7.1 ± 0.6) at a bond distance of 2.62 ± 0.01 Å as shown by the first shell fit in the bottom half for Figure 2a (red dashed line). A Pt–Pt contribution was also fit in PtZn/SiO2 with a coordination number of 3.6 ± 0.3 at an average bond distance of 2.81 ± 0.02 Å as shown by the first shell fit in the bottom half for Figure 2a (blue dashed line). This Pt–Pt distance is longer than that in monometallic Pt (i.e., at a nonbonding distance) and indicates that the Pt atoms in the PtZn nanoparticles were geometrically isolated from one another. Individual fitting parameters for the Pt foil, Pt/SiO2, and PtZn/SiO2 samples can be found in Table S2.
The synchrotron XRD pattern for Pt/SiO2 at room temperature further confirms that the Pt nanoparticles were metallic, as indicated by the agreement between the peak positions of the simulated Pt metal pattern (red line) and the data (black line) in Figure 2b. The Pt/SiO2 diffraction peaks were broadened due to the small (3.3 ± 1.9 nm by HAADF-STEM and TEM) nanoparticle size. In order to isolate these structural features, background scattering due to the SiO2 support and empty heating stage were subtracted from the patterns for the Pt/SiO2 and PtZn/SiO2 catalysts according to the method described by Gallagher et al. (34) The background-subtracted patterns taken at 600 °C (Figure S6) were found to be identical to those obtained at room temperature (Figure 2b) except for shifts in diffraction peaks due to thermal lattice expansion, thereby indicating that the crystal structures of the Pt and PtZn nanoparticles remained unchanged throughout this temperature range. Thus, the diffraction patterns collected at room temperature were used for comparison with standard patterns simulated under the same conditions.
PtZn nanoparticles on the PtZn/SiO2 sample (black line) in Figure 2b show diffraction peaks attributed to a Pt1Zn1, 1:1 intermetallic alloy phase (red line) with a tetragonal AuCu structure. No additional PtZn alloy phases (i.e., Pt3Zn, Pt3Zn10, PtZn1.7) were observed on the PtZn/SiO2 catalyst, thereby indicating that the high symmetry Pt1Zn1 alloy was preferentially formed. Figure 2c shows a structural comparison between the Pt (fcc) and Pt1Zn1 (tetragonal AuCu) phases along with a comparison of the Pt–Pt and Pt–Zn bond distances as determined by EXAFS fittings and from the diffraction peaks below 6° in the XRD patterns of the reduced samples at room temperature. The Pt–Pt and Pt–Zn bond distances derived from in situ XRD and EXAFS are quite similar except for a small systematic error of ∼0.02 Å between the two techniques that has been observed by others. (34) A complete list of Pt and Pt1Zn1 unit cell parameters can be found in Table S3.
The diffraction pattern of PtZn/SiO2 collected at room temperature upon exposure to air after reduction at 600 °C exhibited features in addition to those for the PtZn intermetallic alloy, likely due to surface alloy decomposition induced by exposure to oxygen (Figure S7). The difference pattern (black line) obtained by subtraction of the room temperature oxidized PtZn/SiO2 from reduced PtZn/SiO2 is shown in Figure 3. The peaks in the difference pattern correspond to Pt1Zn1 and show that the alloy surface structure was identical to that of the fully reduced Pt1Zn1 intermetallic nanoparticle. This Pt1Zn1 intermetallic structure on the nanoparticle surface isolated all the surface Pt sites and thereby contributed to the high alkane dehydrogenation selectivity. This relation is consistent with previous observations for SiO2-supported PdZn, (19, 20) PdIn, (21) and PtIn (22) catalysts.

Experimental and Calculated RIXS Planes for Pt and PtZn
Energy differences between the unoccupied and occupied Pt 5d states (i.e., the energy transfer, ΔE, see Scheme 1) for reduced Pt/SiO2 and PtZn/SiO2 catalysts were examined with in situ RIXS by monitoring the Pt L3 X-ray absorption and emission. The X-ray emission intensity was measured as a function of the incident and emitted photon energies for the Pt L3 XANES and Lβ5 regions, respectively. The experimentally measured RIXS spectra for Pt/SiO2 and PtZn/SiO2 are presented in Figure 4 as two-dimensional contour plots that show the energy transfer (ΔE) as a function of the incident photon energy (Ω). For Pt/SiO2, the maximum RIXS intensity (red region) occurred at Ω = 11 564 eV with an energy transfer of 4.0 eV. Addition of Zn to Pt/SiO2 shifted the maximum RIXS intensity to higher energy transfer by approximately 2.0 eV at 11 566 eV (ΔE ∼ 6 eV), with a high intensity tail that extended along the diagonal to 11 572 eV. A comparison of Pt L3 XANES in Figure S5 for Pt and PtZn indicates that the edge energy of the latter was shifted to 0.9 eV higher than that in the former. Since the energy transfer for Pt1Zn1 was 2.0 eV, the energy of the filled valence states was 1.1 eV lower for Pt1Zn1 than that in the monometallic Pt sample. The longer tail in the energy transfer plot for Pt1Zn1 (Figure 4) is, in part, due to the broader XANES spectrum of PtZn compared to that of Pt (Figure S5).
Figure 4

Comparisons between experimentally (Exp) measured RIXS for 9.70 wt % Pt/SiO2 with calculated RIXS for Pt(111) by DFT (left column), and experimental RIXS for 9.53 wt % Pt–9.28 wt % Zn/SiO2 with calculated RIXS for Pt1Zn1(110) by DFT (right column).
Simulations of in situ RIXS spectra for Pt and PtZn were performed on Pt(111) and Pt1Zn1(110) surfaces and are also shown in Figure 4. The (111) and (110) close-packed surface orientations were chosen in order to represent the bulk nanoparticle surface structures of Pt and Pt1Zn1, respectively. Calculated bulk and surface d-DOS were averaged for Pt(111) and Pt1Zn1(110) in order to approximate the Pt and Pt1Zn1 nanoparticles, respectively. The formalism for calculating RIXS spectra from the DOS has been discussed elsewhere. (24, 35, 36) RIXS intensities (F) were calculated from the following equation: (24)
(1)
Here, F was calculated by integrating over the DOS energies (ε) for the occupied valence states (i) and unoccupied valence states (j), where ρd and ρd′ are the partial d-band DOS of Pt for the occupied and unoccupied states, respectively. The lifetime broadening of the 2p3/2 core hole (Γn) was taken as 5.41 eV. (24) This method does not account for interactions from the photoexcitation process; however, it has been shown to give accurate results when compared to experimental results. (24) The calculations, which were performed by using the d-band DOS obtained through self-consistent DFT calculations, exhibited similar features to the experimental spectra. In particular, the simulations revealed a ∼1.8 eV increase in the energy transfer of the RIXS maximum that occurred at ∼0.9 eV higher incident energy than on Pt(111), in agreement with the measured 0.9 eV edge energy increase for PtZn/SiO2 from in situ XAS.
Previous theoretical studies have provided strong evidence that the metal d-band center is a useful descriptor of catalytic activity for various transition metals and alloys. (6, 7, 37-40) For the present study, the calculated Pt d-band center for monometallic Pt(111) was found to be −2.19 eV and was shifted upward to −2.08 eV for Pt1Zn1(110), as shown in Figure 5. Use of a modified electronic structure descriptor, (41) defined as the sum of the d-band center and half the d-DOS width, yielded values of −0.64 eV and −0.61 eV for Pt and Pt1Zn1, respectively. Such small changes are within the uncertainty of DFT calculations and do not differentiate the electronic properties in these samples. Indeed, when compared to the experimentally measured RIXS spectra in Figure 4, it is evident that the calculated Lβ5 RIXS planes for Pt(111) and Pt1Zn1(110), which contain information corresponding to the surface d-band DOS that affects catalytic activity, accurately reproduce trends in the PtZn and Pt RIXS signatures and provide additional details regarding the Pt valence electronic structure, including a more direct comparison between theoretical and experimental spectra for Pt and PtZn compared to the d-band model alone.

The effect of Zn addition on the energy levels of both the occupied and unoccupied Pt 5d bands, evaluated from the energy transfer (ΔE) and Pt L3 edge energy obtained during in situ RIXS and XANES, respectively, is shown in Scheme 2. Compared to monometallic Pt, the occupied Pt 5d bands in PtZn were shifted by approximately 1.1 eV further below the Fermi energy, while the unoccupied bands were shifted to higher energies by approximately 0.9 eV. As discussed in section 4 of the Supporting Information, the lower energies of the occupied states led to an upward shift in the high intensity peak for the Pt1Zn1 alloy compared to monometallic Pt, while the extended unoccupied states led to a longer tail for PtZn compared to Pt. This combination of lower energy for the filled and higher energy for the unfilled electronic states changes the relative energy between the Pt d orbitals in PtZn/SiO2 and the adsorbate electrons, which decreases the Pt-adsorbate bond energy and increases the number of reaction turnovers per Pt site per unit time. Previous microcalorimetric and DFT studies by Dumesic and co-workers (11-13) have shown that the addition of Zn and Sn ad-metals to Pt- and Pd-containing catalysts weakened the interaction of the metal surface with C2H4 to inhibit production of coke-forming ethylidyne species. These findings align with the kinetic and structural characterization results from the present study that show suppressed coke deposition and TOR enhancement on the Pt1Zn1 nanoparticle alloys. Furthermore, DFT calculations and in situ RIXS measurements indicate that the mechanism of this electronic promotion of Pt by Zn for EDH is driven by changes in energy of the Pt 5d electrons, rather than a change in electron occupancy due to electron donation as previously suggested for PtZn (8, 10) and PtCu, (40) which effectively reduces the binding energies of adsorbates and increases the TOR per surface Pt.

A major challenge in the development of catalytic materials is the ability to identify the most important properties of a solid surface which govern its chemical reactivity. The molecular level insight obtained in the present study provides a model to suggest that control of the geometric structure of the Pt active sites affects product selectivity, while control of the metal promoter affects the adsorbate binding strength and TOR. Furthermore, the direct experimental validation of DFT-predicted RIXS planes for Pt/SiO2 and PtZn/SiO2 enables new opportunities to investigate relationships between the energy levels of filled and unfilled valence states for various Pt-containing alloys, the binding energies of adsorbates, and their effects on catalytic activity for EDH. While only monometallic Pt and the Pt1Zn1 alloy have been considered here for EDH, we envision that this approach could be applied to other nanoparticle alloys and reactions of interest.
Conclusions
The combined theoretical and experimental approach for EDH on Pt/SiO2 and PtZn/SiO2 demonstrates that the addition of Zn to Pt effectively suppresses C–C bond cleavage pathways during dehydrogenation at 600 °C to achieve nearly 100% C2H4 selectivity up to the thermodynamic limit of C2H6 conversion. Additionally, Zn incorporation into the Pt nanoparticles leads to a 6-fold TOR increase per mole of surface Pt compared to the monometallic Pt catalyst.
Geometric and electronic characterization reveals that the Pt active sites on the surface of the metallic nanoparticles in these catalysts are both structurally and chemically different. The role of the Zn promoter is 2-fold: (i) to form a Pt1 Zn1 intermetallic alloy structure with uniformly isolated Pt surface sites that effectively suppress the rate of structure-sensitive reactions, such as hydrogenolysis and cracking, while retaining the structure-insensitive dehydrogenation pathway, and (ii) to lower the energy of the filled states of the Pt surface, thus weakening the bond formation between the 5d orbitals and adsorbates. While the selectivity changes may be explained by an ensemble effect related to isolated Pt sites, the TOR enhancement implies an electronic change within the individual Pt atoms, as evidenced by differences in apparent activation energies along with an increase in the Pt RIXS ΔE for PtZn/SiO2 compared to the monometallic Pt/SiO2 sample. The agreement between experimental and theoretical energies of the Pt 5d valence orbitals for the Pt and Pt1Zn1 nanoparticles in this application demonstrates that DFT calculations provide accurate simulations of the RIXS spectra, yielding insights into the electronic structural details and reactivity of these metal surfaces while also supplementing existing studies based on the first moment of the d-band.
Experimental Section
Catalyst Synthesis
Pt/SiO2
The incipient wetness impregnation (IWI) method was used with 5 g of commercially available high-purity SiO2 (Davisil grade 636, 480 m2 g–1) and an aqueous solution of 0.8 g of (NH3)4Pt(NO3)2 (Sigma-Aldrich) in 5 mL of deionized water for ∼5 wt % Pt loading. The precatalyst was dried in an oven at 100 °C for 24 h, followed by a second impregnation of 0.8 g of (NH3)4Pt(NO3)2 in 5 mL of deionized water to obtain 9.70 wt % Pt loading, as measured by elemental analysis (Galbraith Laboratories). The sample was dried a second time at 100 °C for 24 h and then calcined in air at 225 °C for 3 h. After cooling to room temperature (RT), the sample was reduced in 25% H2 and balance He according to the following temperature cycle: (i) ramp from RT to 100 °C at 5 °C min–1, hold at 100 °C for 15 min; (ii) ramp to 150 °C at 5 °C min–1, hold at 150 °C for 15 min; (iii) ramp to 200 °C at 2.5 °C min–1, hold at 200 °C for 30 min; (iv) ramp to 225 °C at 2.5 °C min–1, hold at 225 °C for 30 min; (v) ramp to 300 °C at 2.5 °C min–1, hold at 300 °C for 15 min; (vi) ramp to 600 °C at 5 °C min–1, hold at 600 °C for 15 min; (vii) purge with He at 600 °C for 15 min and cool to RT in He.
PtZn/SiO2
An aqueous solution of Zn(NO3)2 was prepared by dissolving 1.8 g of Zn(NO3)2·6H2O (Sigma-Aldrich) into 3 mL of deionized water and adjusting the pH to 11 with 2 mL concentrated NH4OH. Deionized water was added to raise the solution volume to 10 mL. IWI was used with 5 g of high-purity SiO2 (Davisil grade 636, 480 m2 g–1) and the Zn(NO3)2 solution to obtain ∼5 wt % Zn loading. The precatalyst was dried in an oven at 100 °C for 24 h, followed by a second impregnation of Zn(NO3)2 solution (pH adjusted to 11) to obtain 9.28 wt % Zn loading. The sample was dried a second time at 100 °C for 24 h and then calcined in air at 550 °C for 3 h followed by annealing in He at 600 °C for 15 min. After cooling to RT, the 10 wt % Zn/SiO2 sample was twice impregnated with aqueous solutions of 0.8 g of (NH3)4Pt(NO3)2 (Sigma-Aldrich) in 5 mL of deionized water to obtain 9.53 wt % Pt loading. The final Zn and Pt loadings were measured by elemental analysis (Galbraith Laboratories). The 9.53 wt % Pt–9.28 wt % Zn/SiO2 precatalyst was calcined in air at 225 °C and reduced in 25% H2 and balance He per the same procedure as the 9.70 wt % Pt/SiO2 catalyst.
Kinetic Measurements
Catalyst testing was performed in a quartz, plug-flow reactor (9.5 mm I.D.) with a U-shaped effluent line. The catalyst section has a well for a K-type thermocouple (3.2 mm O.D.) for temperature indication that is contained within a quartz sheath and placed in the bottom center of the catalyst bed to measure the reaction temperature inside of the bed. A furnace connected to a temperature controller is used to supply heat to the reactor and maintain the reaction at the desired temperature. The mass of the catalyst sample ranged from 0.01 to 0.2 g, depending upon the desired conversion. The catalyst was diluted with high-purity SiO2 (Davisil grade 636, 480 m2 g–1) to maintain the catalyst bed height at ∼12.7 mm (1/2 in.).
The reactor gas delivery system consists of five mass flow controllers (2-Brooks 5850E, 2-Porter 201, 1-Tylan FC-260) and a manifold that mixes the gases prior to entering the reactor. First, the catalyst was reduced in 5% H2 (Praxair, 99.999%) and balance N2 (Matheson, 99.995%) at 40 mL min–1 total flow while the temperature was ramped from RT to 600 °C at 10 °C min–1 and then held at 600 °C for 30 min. The total flow rate was confirmed at the reactor outlet. Then, following the reduction, the EDH reaction mixture was introduced into the reactor at 600 °C and 150 mL min–1 total flow. The EDH reaction mixture consists of 2.5% C2H6 (Matheson, 99.95%), 1% H2 (Praxair, 99.999%), 0.5% C2H4 (Matheson, 99.999%), 46.7% He (Matheson, 99.999%), and balance N2 (Matheson, 99.995%), which was used as an internal standard. The reactor effluent was analyzed by using a Hewlett-Packard 5890 Series II gas chromatograph (GC) equipped with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD). A Carboxen-1010 PLOT Capillary GC Column was used to separate the components in the reactor effluent gas mixture. After the C2H6 conversion stabilized below 10% at 600 °C, the apparent activation energy (Eapp) was measured between 570 and 600 °C. Details regarding the calculation of EDH rates, ethane conversion, and ethylene selectivity can be found in section 3 of the Supporting Information. During each run, carbon mass balances closed from 83 to 100% for Pt/SiO2 (with C2H4 cofed), 95 to 100% for Pt/SiO2 (without C2H4 cofed), and ∼100% for PtZn/SiO2 both with and without C2H4 cofed.
X-ray Characterization
X-ray Absorption
Platinum L3 (11 564 eV) XAS experiments were performed in transmission mode at the Materials Research Collaborative Access Team (MRCAT) bending magnet (10-BM) beamline at the Advanced Photon Source (APS) within Argonne National Laboratory to identify the Pt chemical state, coordination (N), types of nearest neighbors, and interatomic bond distances (R). A cylindrical sample holder containing six wells to hold self-supporting catalyst wafers was placed inside of a quartz tube (25.4 mm O.D.) and sealed with Kapton windows and Ultra-Torr fittings to allow gases to flow through the cell. The thickness of the catalyst wafers (∼15 mg) was chosen to give an X-ray absorbance of approximately 2.0 and a Pt edge step of approximately 0.5. After reduction at 600 °C in 3% H2 and balance He, the Pt/SiO2 and PtZn/SiO2 samples were cooled to room temperature in H2, and then X-ray absorption spectra were collected by using standard methods and energy calibrated to the simultaneously obtained edge position of a Pt foil. The Pt edge energy was determined on the basis of the position of the maximum of the first peak in the first derivative of the XANES region. Phase shifts and backscattering amplitudes for the EXAFS spectra were determined for monometallic Pt scatterers (i.e., Pt–Pt) based on the experimentally obtained Pt foil spectra (12 scatterers at 2.77 Å). Pt–Zn scatterers were calculated by using two atom calculations with the FEFF6 code. (42, 43) X-ray absorption spectra were analyzed with WinXAS v. 3.11 software. (44) The values for the amplitude reduction factor, S02, and Debye–Waller factor (DWF), Δσ2, were determined by fitting the foils with FEFF. The EXAFS parameters were calculated for the first scattering shell by using the FEFF references and performing a least-squares fit in R-space of the k2-weighted Fourier transform. Once the nanoparticle structure was determined by XRD, the final EXAFS fit was performed by using Artemus software (45) based on a two shell fit (i.e., Pt–Zn and Pt–Pt) of the Pt1Zn1 structure.
Synchrotron X-ray Diffraction
XRD measurements were performed in transmission mode at the Sector 11 insertion device (11-ID-C) beamline at the APS. XRD patterns were acquired by using X-rays at 105 keV (λ = 0.11798 Å) and a PerkinElmer large area detector with a typical exposure time of 5 s and a total of 30 scans. Catalyst samples were pressed into cylindrical, self-supporting wafers (d ∼ 7 mm) and placed on a Pt crucible inside of a ceramic sample cup within a Linkam Scientific TS1500 heating stage. The heating stage is equipped with water cooling and allows for temperature-controlled operation while flowing gases across the catalyst wafer. The 2-D scattering images were converted to 1-D scattering patterns by using Fit2D software in order to obtain plots of intensity as a function of 2θ. (46) Materials Analysis Using Diffraction (MAUD) v. 2.55 software was used to simulate standard XRD patterns of Pt, (47) Pt1Zn1, (48) Pt3Zn, (49) Pt3Zn10, (50) and PtZn1.7 (49) phases. These simulated patterns were then compared with the experimentally measured patterns for 10 wt % Pt/SiO2 and 10 wt % PtZn/SiO2.
Resonant Inelastic X-ray Scattering
RIXS measurements were obtained on the MRCAT insertion device (10-ID) beamline at the APS. Catalyst samples (∼50–75 mg) were pressed into self-supporting wafers at a 45° angle and placed inside of a custom in situ gas cell that is equipped with a resistively heated sample stage, water-cooled Kapton windows, dual thermocouples for temperature indication and control, and connections to allow gases to flow through the cell. (51) The catalysts were reduced in 3% H2 and balance He (50 mL min–1 total flow) at 550 °C for 0.5 h and then cooled to 100 °C in the same gas mixture prior to analysis.
The X-ray emission spectrometer was based on a bent silicon Laue analyzer, (52) optimized for high resolution. Soller slits were used for background suppression, and a Pilatus 100 K pixel area detector (Dectris Ltd.) was used to detect the X-rays. The silicon analyzer element was a 55-μm-thick wafer, with <100> orientation, cylindrically bent to a minimum radius of 480 mm (as a logarithmic spiral). The (133) reflection with a calculated asymmetry of 13.26° was used to select the pass band. The calculated reflectivity, absorption, and local bandwidth at 11 560 eV were 53%, 30%, and 1.1 eV, respectively. Soller slits absorbed unreflected X-rays and reduced the background scatter. To generate the RIXS planes, the incident X-ray energy was scanned from 11 547 eV to 11 589 eV in 0.7 eV steps above 11 558 eV. The entire emission energy range was measured at once by carefully setting the analyzer angle and distance from the sample. Once set, the analyzer remained fixed during the measurement. Each pixel of the array detector then must be assigned an energy. Resonant valence emission has a complication for energy calibration in that the elastic scatter and the X-ray emission are at nearly the same energy over a portion of the spectrum. Postprocessing of the images was required to generate energy masks for the entire array detector surface. These masks were used to convert the images into intensity versus X-ray energy. To balance the intensity of the elastically scattered X-rays used for calibration with the low background required to observe the X-ray emission, the center of the analyzer was offset by 10° elevation from the plane of the X-ray beam polarization, while being set at 90° in the plan view of the beam, sample, and analyzer. The combined energy resolution of the source, beam size, and analyzer was measured to be about 2.4 eV: comparable to the calculated resolution (2.1 eV) and as well as the valence emission line width.
DFT Methods
All calculations were performed by using self-consistent, periodic density functional theory (DFT), as implemented within the Vienna ab Initio Simulation Package (VASP). (53-56) The Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof exchange-correlation functional was used for all calculations. (57) The projector augmented wave (PAW) core potentials developed from PBE calculations were used. (58, 59) For the Pt and PtZn bulk lattice optimizations, a cutoff energy of 600 eV and a 20 × 20 × 20 Monkhorst–Pack K-point grid with Methfessel-Paxton smearing was used to reduce Pulay stress. Lattice constants are converged to within a force criterion of 0.02 eV Å–1, which resulted in lattice parameters of 3.98 Å for Pt and 2.88 and 3.53 Å for the a and c unit vectors, respectively, of Pt1Zn1. For DOS calculations on the Pt and Pt1Zn1 bulk, a cutoff energy of 1000 eV and a 30 × 30 × 30 Monkhorst–Pack K-point grid was implemented along with tetrahedron Blöchl smearing. The projected density of state (PDOS) was lm-decomposed according to the Wigner–Seitz radius provided by the PAW potential. Close packed surfaces corresponding to the (111) for Pt as well as the (110) and (101) surfaces for Pt1Zn1 were cut from the lattice optimized bulk. Each surface was a five layer slab with a 10 Å vacuum. Cell dimensions for the Pt surface were 5.62 Å, 5.62 Å, and 29.18 Å along the a, b, and c unit vectors, respectively, including vacuum. Cell dimensions for the Pt1Zn1(110) surface were 4.08 Å, 3.53 Å, and 28.16 Å along the a, b, and c unit vectors, respectively, including vacuum. Cell dimensions for the PtZn(101) surface were 4.58 Å, 2.88 Å, and 28.93 Å. A comparison of the predicted RIXS planes for the (110) and (101) surfaces is included in section 4 of the Supporting Information. The bottom two layers were fully constrained, and the rest of the slab was allowed to relax to a force criterion of 0.02 eV Å–1. An energy cutoff of 400 eV, a 6 × 6 × 1 Monkhorst–Pack K-point grid, and Methfessel-Paxton smearing was found to minimize Pulay stress and converge total energies. DOS calculations were performed with a 1000 eV cutoff energy, an 8 × 8 × 1 Monkhorst–Pack K-point grid, and tetrahedron Blöchl smearing by using the relaxed surface geometries.
