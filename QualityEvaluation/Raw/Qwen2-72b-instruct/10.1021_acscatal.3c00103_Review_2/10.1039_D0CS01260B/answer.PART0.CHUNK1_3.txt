[1] "The addition of 3-mercaptopropyl-trimethoxysilane (MPS) during the synthesis of the gallosilicate MFI zeolites causes significantly increased content of the strong Lewis acid sites and a higher ratio of Lewis to Brnsted acidity, for enhancing the PDH activity and propylene selectivity."
[2] "The hierarchical Ga-MFI zeolite catalysts are developed through the repetitive branching synthesis strategy or the utilization of long chain alkyl structure directing agents, and their superior PDH performances, 26 times higher conversion and 10100% increased propylene selectivity, are obtained in comparison with those over the bulk Ga-MFI catalyst."
[3] "The PDH reactions over Ga catalysts on beta zeolite, SiO2 and Al2O3 supports are also investigated, and the active sites depend on the character of the support and the synthesis method."
[4] "The modification with iron into the CoOx species supported on the Al2O3 nanosheets can further promote the catalytic activity and propylene selectivity of the Co-catalyzed PDH reaction, which benefits from the strong interaction between Fe and the oxygen ligand for weakening the π domination of oxygen into the adjacent Co site as well as from the prohibition effect on the reduction of Co2+ sites."
[5] "The doping of Cu as a promoter and not as an active site into the ZrO2 matrix is also reported to improve the creation of more active Zrcus sites, and the optimal CuZrO-8 catalyst displays over 98% propylene selectivity and 0.47 mmolC3H8 g1 min1 initial reaction rate in the PDH reaction at 600 C."
[6] "The synergistic effect between CrOx and ZrOx in bulk binary CrZrOx oxides has also been proved as an effective strategy to enhance the catalytic performance of Zrcus-based catalysts."
[7] "The P-modified Mo/ZSM-5 catalysts are reported for the EDH reactions. The P species may interact with the framework Al to form SAPO-like interfaces for reducing the acidic properties and changing the channel texture of the zeolite."
[8] "The Ni(111)-catalyzed PDH and side reactions are theoretically studied with DFT calculations."
[9] "The surface isolated [InH2]+ ions in CHA zeolite are prepared via a reductive solid-state ion-exchange methodology, acting as the active sites for the selective EDH reaction through concerted and alkyl mechanisms."

1.Recent advancements in catalyst design and fabrication for direct dehydrogenation processes have focused on enhancing the catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts. Strategies include the addition of modifiers during synthesis to increase the content of strong Lewis acid sites and the ratio of Lewis to Brnsted acidity, as seen with 3-mercaptopropyl-trimethoxysilane (MPS) in gallosilicate MFI zeolites. The development of hierarchical catalysts, such as Ga-MFI zeolite catalysts, has also shown significant improvements in PDH performance, with higher conversion and increased propylene selectivity compared to bulk catalysts. The choice of support material and synthesis method can influence the active sites, as observed in PDH reactions over Ga catalysts on beta zeolite, SiO2, and Al2O3 supports. The modification of CoOx species with iron on Al2O3 nanosheets can further enhance catalytic activity and propylene selectivity by promoting strong interactions and preventing site reduction. Doping with Cu in ZrO2 matrixes has been shown to increase the number of active Zrcus sites, leading to high propylene selectivity and initial reaction rates. The synergistic effect of CrOx and ZrOx in binary oxides can also improve the catalytic performance of Zrcus-based catalysts. The use of P-modified Mo/ZSM-5 catalysts for EDH reactions can reduce acidic properties and alter zeolite channel texture. Theoretical studies using DFT calculations have provided insights into the catalytic mechanisms of PDH and side reactions over Ni(111) surfaces. The preparation of surface isolated [InH2]+ ions in CHA zeolite via reductive solid-state ion-exchange can act as active sites for selective EDH reactions through concerted and alkyl mechanisms. These advancements address the challenges in catalyst design by optimizing active site properties, improving selectivity, and enhancing stability for industrial applications.
