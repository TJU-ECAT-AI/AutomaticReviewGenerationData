1.Recent progress in heterogeneous metal and metal oxide catalysts for direct dehydrogenation of ethane and propane has been outlined in this review, focusing on the past five years. For different classes of promising catalysts in the selective dehydrogenation of ethane-to-ethylene and propane-to-propylene, their syntheses, structural information, catalytic properties, and mechanisms are comparatively summarized. The synthesis parameters influence the metal particle size for the as-obtained Pt-based catalysts. The atomically precise single-atom (SA) and single-atom alloy (SAA) catalysts have become one of the most active new frontiers in heterogeneous catalysis. The synthesis of the PtZn/SiO2 catalyst with 0.8 nm cluster size is prepared by a similar SOMC strategy. A preparation strategy has been reported for the zeolite-confined Pt single-atom and nanocluster catalysts with high stability, which is a transformation process from the two-dimensional ITQ-1 zeolite into the three-dimensional MCM-22 zeolite. The encapsulation of ultrasmall PtZn alloy nanoclusters by the nanosized MFI-structure silicalite-1 zeolites is achieved by a ligand-protected direct hydrogen reduction method. The bimetallic PtCu alloy nanoparticle encapsulated in silicalite-1 shows a superior catalytic performance than the monometallic Pt catalyst in the PDH reaction at 610 C. The nanocarbon-based materials are rarely reported to serve as the supports of Pt sites, although they themselves are a group of important catalysts for the alkane DH reactions due to their metallic or semimetallic nature or the defect roles. The ball milled hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) nanosheets with abundant fault edge B-O defects can properly modify the geometric and electronic states and catalytic properties of localized Pt/Cu nanoclusters through strong bonding interactions. The Pt/Cu/h-BN-sheet catalyst with only 100 ppm Pt exhibits propylene selectivity of >99% and high propylene formation rate of 7.3 s1 in the PDH reaction at a low temperature of 520 C. The recent progress of Cr-based DH catalysts is summarized in Table 4. The addition of ZnO to Cr2O3 causes the formation of a ZnZr2O4 spinel structure with a reduced particle size and an increased content of the defect sites.

1.最近，关于直接脱氢的异质金属和金属氧化物催化剂的进展已经概述在本综述中，重点是过去五年。对于不同类别的在选择性脱氢的乙烷至乙烯和丙烷至丙烯的有希望的催化剂，他们的合成，结构信息，催化性质和机制进行了比较总结。合成参数影响所获得的Pt基催化剂的金属颗粒尺寸。原子精确的单原子（SA）和单原子合金（SAA）催化剂已成为异质催化中最活跃的新前沿之一。通过类似的SOMC策略制备了具有0.8 nm团簇尺寸的PtZn/SiO2催化剂。已经报道了一种用于具有高稳定性的沸石限制的Pt单原子和纳米簇催化剂的制备策略，这是一种从二维ITQ-1沸石到三维MCM-22沸石的转变过程。通过配体保护的直接氢还原方法实现了纳米尺寸的MFI结构硅酸盐-1沸石中超小PtZn合金纳米簇的封装。封装在硅酸盐-1中的二元金属PtCu合金纳米粒子在610°C的PDH反应中表现出优于单金属Pt催化剂的优异催化性能。尽管它们本身由于其金属或半金属性质或缺陷作用而是一组重要的烷烃DH反应催化剂，但很少报道纳米碳基材料作为Pt位点的支撑。通过强键合相互作用，球磨六方氮化硼（h-BN）纳米片上的大量边缘B-O缺陷可以适当修改局部Pt/Cu纳米簇的几何和电子状态以及催化性质。仅含100 ppm Pt的Pt/Cu/h-BN-sheet催化剂在520°C的PDH反应中表现出>99％的丙烯选择性和7.3 s1的高丙烯形成率。Cr基DH催化剂的最新进展总结在表4中。向Cr2O3添加ZnO会导致形成具有减小的颗粒尺寸和增加的缺陷位点含量的ZnZr2O4尖晶石结构。据报道，Ni促进剂和CrOx之间的协同效应使Cr-Ni/Al2O3催化PDH反应的活性提高了约24％。
