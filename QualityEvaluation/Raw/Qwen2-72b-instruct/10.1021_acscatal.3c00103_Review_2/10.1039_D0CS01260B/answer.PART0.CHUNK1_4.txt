1.The literature does not provide specific information on the key strategies and approaches that have been recently developed to enhance the catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes. However, it does discuss various methods for improving catalyst performance, including the use of advanced synthesis strategies such as atomic layer deposition (ALD) and single-atom metal catalyst (SOMC) approaches to finely control the structure of active sites. The literature also highlights the importance of localizing metallic atoms or ions on metal oxide matrixes or zeolite frameworks through the strong metal-support interaction (SMSI) effect and confinement effect to create subnanometric or single-atom active sites. Additionally, the modification of geometric and electronic properties by promoter species can be regulated using favorable synthesis methods. The literature emphasizes the need for constructing stable structures for small-sized metallic or ionic active sites to maximize catalytic efficiency in selective alkane dehydrogenation reactions. It also discusses the critical role of selective activation of alkane C-H bonds and prohibition of C-C cleavage and other side reactions to achieve high olefin selectivity and long-term stability. The literature suggests that the understanding of catalyst structure-activity relationships and mechanisms for alkane oxidative dehydrogenation processes may provide a reference for the structural design of dehydrogenation catalysts. It also mentions the importance of addressing the issue of irreversible coke deposition for deactivation, which is a significant challenge for all dehydrogenation catalysts. Strategies to solve this problem include modifying the electronic properties of active metals or metal oxides, geometric modification of active sites through isolation effects, and elimination of possible active sites responsible for coking on selected supports. The literature also notes that the reaction atmosphere, including the co-feeding of steam vapor and hydrogen, can affect the formation of coke species. However, it highlights the need for further research to systematically discuss the catalytic roles of co-fed gases in alkane dehydrogenation reactions over non-platinum catalysts. Finally, the literature discusses the challenge of dynamic structural stability of metallic or ionic active sites during the reaction and regeneration treatment, and suggests that a moderate interaction among metals, promoters, and supports will be pivotal for the design of dehydrogenation catalysts.
