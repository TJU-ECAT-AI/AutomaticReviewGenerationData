1.The literature does not provide specific information on the key strategies and approaches that have been recently developed to enhance the catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes. However, it does discuss various methods for improving catalyst design, fabrication, and performance optimization for industrial applications. These include advanced synthesis strategies such as atomic layer deposition (ALD) and single-atom metal catalyst (SOMC) approaches to finely control the structure of Pt- or oxide-based active sites in dehydrogenation (DH) catalysts. The use of proper supports such as oxides and zeolites through the strong metal-support interaction (SMSI) effect and confinement effect can localize subnanometric or single-atom/single-atom alloy (SA/SAA) Pt-related metal sites, which exhibit unique catalytic performances compared to larger metal ensembles. Geometric and electronic modification effects by promoter species can also be well regulated using favorable synthesis methods. High-resolution characterization techniques, such as in situ X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) and high-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM), can provide effective structural information of the catalysts, allowing us to establish the real relationships between adsorption and catalytic properties. Efforts are being made to construct stable structures for small-sized metallic or ionic active sites to maximize catalytic efficiency in selective alkane DH reactions. Selective activation of alkane C-H bonds and prohibition of C-C cleavage and other side reactions are critical to achieve high olefin selectivity and great long-term stability. The localization of metallic atoms or ions on metal oxide matrixes or zeolite frameworks may induce the formation of new active sites involved in synergistic reaction mechanisms or undesired pathways. The complete functions of surface acid sites should be profoundly realized, not limited to their negative roles in catalyzing C-C cracking, deep dehydrogenation, or coking processes. The understanding of the catalyst structure-activity relationship and mechanism for alkane oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) processes may provide a reference for the structural design of DH catalysts, although different tasks and limitations exist between these two processes. Novel boron nitride (BN)-based or boron (B)-related materials offer promising alternatives to commonly studied metal oxides such as vanadium oxide (VOx) and chromium oxide (CrOx) and can catalyze key steps of selective alkane ODH reactions, such as C-H activation and olefin desorption, in particular pathways. The irreversible coke deposition for deactivation is the most important issue that all DH catalysts suffer from. Several strategies have been performed to solve this problem, including modifying the electronic properties of metallic Pt and other active metals or metal oxides by promoters or supports, geometric modification on active sites through isolation effects, and eliminating possible active sites responsible for coking on selected supports. The reaction atmosphere is another factor affecting the formation of coke species, and the co-feeding of steam vapor and hydrogen is a reported method to reduce the coke amount. However, there are rare reports to systematically discuss the catalytic roles of these co-fed gases in alkane DH reactions over non-Pt catalysts. To further increase the single-pass yield of alkane DH reactions, the removal of hydrogen from the mixture of products can shift the equilibrium to the production of olefins by using Pd- or zeolite-based membrane reactors. However, the effect of hydrogen as a coke inhibitor is weakened, and the coking issue and catalyst stability remain a challenge. Another crucial issue related to stability for metal or metal oxide-catalyzed alkane DH processes is the dynamic structural stability of metallic or ionic active sites during the reaction and regeneration treatment. Although the SMSI effects can effectively stabilize active sites against high reaction temperatures and reductive atmospheres in DH reactions, overly strong interactions can cause active metals to be embedded into subsurface, lattice layers, or frameworks, reducing accessibility or even intrinsic activity of active sites. This results in a relatively longer induction period in the initial reaction stage for completing the pre-activation of these active sites, which is not ideal due to its low efficiency of raw gases and energy and increases the difficulty of acquiring the real structure-activity relationship and proposing a convincing mechanism. A moderate interaction among metals, promoters, and supports will be pivotal for the design of DH catalysts, and an efficient pretreatment procedure needs to be developed.

1.文献没有提供关于最近开发的增强支撑金属催化剂在直接脱氢过程中的催化稳定性的关键策略和方法的具体信息。但是，它确实讨论了各种方法，以改善催化剂设计、制造和性能优化，用于工业应用。这些包括先进的合成策略，如原子层沉积（ALD）和单原子金属催化剂（SOMC）方法，以精细控制Pt或氧化物基活性位点在脱氢（DH）催化剂中的结构。通过强金属-支撑相互作用（SMSI）效应和限制效应，使用适当的支撑，如氧化物和沸石，可以定位亚纳米或单原子/单原子合金（SA/SAA）Pt相关金属位点，与较大的金属集合相比，这些位点表现出独特的催化性能。通过有利的合成方法，可以很好地调节促进剂物种的几何和电子修饰效果。高分辨率表征技术，如原位X射线吸收光谱（XAS）和高角度环形暗场扫描透射电子显微镜（HAADF-STEM），可以提供催化剂的有效结构信息，使我们能够建立吸附和催化性质之间的实际关系。正在努力构建小尺寸金属或离子活性位点的稳定结构，以最大限度地提高选择性烷烃DH反应中的催化效率。选择性激活烷烃C-H键，禁止C-C裂解和其他副反应，对于实现高烯烃选择性和优异的长期稳定性至关重要。将金属原子或离子定位在金属氧化物基质或沸石框架上，可能会诱导形成新的活性位点，参与协同反应机制或不希望的途径。应该深刻认识到表面酸位的完整功能，而不仅仅局限于它们在催化C-C裂解、深度脱氢或焦化过程中的负面作用。对烷烃氧化脱氢（ODH）过程的催化剂结构-活性关系和机制的理解，可能为DH催化剂的结构设计提供参考，尽管这两个过程之间存在不同的任务和限制。新型硼氮化物（BN）基或硼（B）相关材料为通常研究的金属氧化物（如V2O5和CrOx）提供了有希望的替代品，并且可以在特定途径中催化选择性烷烃ODH反应的关键步骤，例如C-H激活和烯烃解吸。所有DH催化剂都遭受不可逆焦炭沉积导致的失活，这是最重要的问题。已经执行了几种策略来解决这个问题，包括通过促进剂或支撑修改Pt和其他活性金属或金属氧化物的电子性质，通过隔离效应在活性位点上进行几何修改，以及消除选定支撑上负责焦化的可能活性位点。反应气氛是影响焦炭物种形成的一个因素，据报道，共喂入蒸汽和氢气可以减少焦炭量。然而，关于这些共喂入气体在非Pt催化剂上烷烃DH反应中的催化作用，很少有系统讨论的报告。为了进一步提高烷烃DH反应的单程产率，可以从产物混合物中去除氢气，通过使用Pd或沸石基膜反应器，使平衡向烯烃生产转移。然而，氢气作为焦炭抑制剂的作用被削弱，焦化问题和催化剂稳定性仍然是一个挑战。另一个与金属或金属氧化物催化烷烃DH过程的稳定性相关的关键问题是，在反应和再生处理过程中，金属或离子活性位点的动态结构稳定性。虽然SMSI效应可以有效地稳定DH反应中高反应温度和还原气氛下的活性位点，但过强的相互作用会导致活性金属嵌入到次表面、晶格层或框架中，降低可及性，甚至降低内在活性。这导致初始反应阶段相对较长的诱导期，以完成这些活性位点的预激活，这并不理想，因为它降低了原料气体和能量的效率，并增加了获得真实的结构-活性关系和提出令人信服的机制的难度。金属、促进剂和支撑之间的适度相互作用对于DH催化剂的设计至关重要，需要开发有效的预处理程序。

It also discusses the role of oxygen species in the gas phase, lattice phase, and on the interface in the selective activation of C-H and C-C bonds in light hydrocarbons. Furthermore, the literature mentions the importance of addressing the issue of irreversible coke deposition, which is a major challenge for all dehydrogenation catalysts. Strategies to mitigate this problem include modifying the electronic properties of active metals or metal oxides, using geometric modification to prevent the strong adsorption of coke precursors, and employing supports with reduced acidity or high-silica zeolites to minimize side reactions. The literature also suggests that the co-feeding of steam vapor and hydrogen can reduce the amount of coke species formed during dehydrogenation reactions. However, the literature notes that there is a lack of systematic studies on the catalytic roles of co-fed gases in alkane dehydrogenation reactions over non-Pt catalysts. Finally, the literature highlights the need to consider the dynamic structural stability of metallic or ionic active sites during the reaction and regeneration treatment, as overly strong interactions can lead to reduced accessibility or intrinsic activity of the active sites.

1.最近，关于直接脱氢的异质金属和金属氧化物催化剂的进展已经概述在本综述中，重点是过去五年。对于不同类别的在选择性脱氢的乙烷至乙烯和丙烷至丙烯的有希望的催化剂，他们的合成，结构信息，催化性质和机制进行了比较总结。合成参数影响所获得的Pt基催化剂的金属颗粒尺寸。原子精确的单原子（SA）和单原子合金（SAA）催化剂已成为异质催化中最活跃的新前沿之一。通过类似的SOMC策略制备了具有0.8 nm团簇尺寸的PtZn/SiO2催化剂。已经报道了一种用于具有高稳定性的沸石限制的Pt单原子和纳米簇催化剂的制备策略，这是一种从二维ITQ-1沸石到三维MCM-22沸石的转变过程。通过配体保护的直接氢还原方法实现了纳米尺寸的MFI结构硅酸盐-1沸石中超小PtZn合金纳米簇的封装。封装在硅酸盐-1中的二元金属PtCu合金纳米粒子在610°C的PDH反应中表现出优于单金属Pt催化剂的优异催化性能。尽管它们本身由于其金属或半金属性质或缺陷作用而是一组重要的烷烃DH反应催化剂，但很少报道纳米碳基材料作为Pt位点的支撑。通过强键合相互作用，球磨六方氮化硼（h-BN）纳米片上的大量边缘B-O缺陷可以适当修改局部Pt/Cu纳米簇的几何和电子状态以及催化性质。仅含100 ppm Pt的Pt/Cu/h-BN-sheet催化剂在520°C的PDH反应中表现出>99％的丙烯选择性和7.3 s1的高丙烯形成率。Cr基DH催化剂的最新进展总结在表4中。向Cr2O3添加ZnO会导致形成具有减小的颗粒尺寸和增加的缺陷位点含量的ZnZr2O4尖晶石结构。据报道，Ni促进剂和CrOx之间的协同效应使Cr-Ni/Al2O3催化PDH反应的活性提高了约24％。

[1] "The addition of 3-mercaptopropyl-trimethoxysilane (MPS) during the synthesis of the gallosilicate MFI zeolites causes significantly increased content of the strong Lewis acid sites and a higher ratio of Lewis to Brnsted acidity, for enhancing the PDH activity and propylene selectivity."
[2] "The hierarchical Ga-MFI zeolite catalysts are developed through the repetitive branching synthesis strategy or the utilization of long chain alkyl structure directing agents, and their superior PDH performances, 26 times higher conversion and 10100% increased propylene selectivity, are obtained in comparison with those over the bulk Ga-MFI catalyst."
[3] "The PDH reactions over Ga catalysts on beta zeolite, SiO2 and Al2O3 supports are also investigated, and the active sites depend on the character of the support and the synthesis method."
[4] "The modification with iron into the CoOx species supported on the Al2O3 nanosheets can further promote the catalytic activity and propylene selectivity of the Co-catalyzed PDH reaction, which benefits from the strong interaction between Fe and the oxygen ligand for weakening the π domination of oxygen into the adjacent Co site as well as from the prohibition effect on the reduction of Co2+ sites."
[5] "The doping of Cu as a promoter and not as an active site into the ZrO2 matrix is also reported to improve the creation of more active Zrcus sites, and the optimal CuZrO-8 catalyst displays over 98% propylene selectivity and 0.47 mmolC3H8 g1 min1 initial reaction rate in the PDH reaction at 600 C."
[6] "The synergistic effect between CrOx and ZrOx in bulk binary CrZrOx oxides has also been proved as an effective strategy to enhance the catalytic performance of Zrcus-based catalysts."
[7] "The P-modified Mo/ZSM-5 catalysts are reported for the EDH reactions. The P species may interact with the framework Al to form SAPO-like interfaces for reducing the acidic properties and changing the channel texture of the zeolite."
[8] "The Ni(111)-catalyzed PDH and side reactions are theoretically studied with DFT calculations."
[9] "The surface isolated [InH2]+ ions in CHA zeolite are prepared via a reductive solid-state ion-exchange methodology, acting as the active sites for the selective EDH reaction through concerted and alkyl mechanisms."

1.Recent advancements in catalyst design and fabrication for direct dehydrogenation processes have focused on enhancing the catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts. Strategies include the addition of modifiers during synthesis to increase the content of strong Lewis acid sites and the ratio of Lewis to Brnsted acidity, as seen with 3-mercaptopropyl-trimethoxysilane (MPS) in gallosilicate MFI zeolites. The development of hierarchical catalysts, such as Ga-MFI zeolite catalysts, has also shown significant improvements in PDH performance, with higher conversion and increased propylene selectivity compared to bulk catalysts. The choice of support material and synthesis method can influence the active sites, as observed in PDH reactions over Ga catalysts on beta zeolite, SiO2, and Al2O3 supports. The modification of CoOx species with iron on Al2O3 nanosheets can further enhance catalytic activity and propylene selectivity by promoting strong interactions and preventing site reduction. Doping with Cu in ZrO2 matrixes has been shown to increase the number of active Zrcus sites, leading to high propylene selectivity and initial reaction rates. The synergistic effect of CrOx and ZrOx in binary oxides can also improve the catalytic performance of Zrcus-based catalysts. The use of P-modified Mo/ZSM-5 catalysts for EDH reactions can reduce acidic properties and alter zeolite channel texture. Theoretical studies using DFT calculations have provided insights into the catalytic mechanisms of PDH and side reactions over Ni(111) surfaces. The preparation of surface isolated [InH2]+ ions in CHA zeolite via reductive solid-state ion-exchange can act as active sites for selective EDH reactions through concerted and alkyl mechanisms. These advancements address the challenges in catalyst design by optimizing active site properties, improving selectivity, and enhancing stability for industrial applications.

1.最近在直接脱氢过程中的催化剂设计和制造方面的进展集中在增强支撑金属催化剂的催化稳定性上。策略包括在合成过程中添加改性剂，以增加强路易斯酸位点的含量和路易斯酸与布伦斯特酸的比例，如在MFI型镓硅酸盐沸石中添加3-巯基丙基三甲氧基硅烷(MPS)。开发了分级催化剂，如Ga-MFI沸石催化剂，与块状催化剂相比，PDH性能有了显著提高，转化率和丙烯选择性都有所提高。支持材料的选择和合成方法可以影响活性位点，如在β沸石、SiO2和Al2O3支持上的Ga催化剂的PDH反应中所观察到的。通过在Al2O3纳米片上用铁改性CoOx物种，可以进一步增强催化活性和丙烯选择性，通过促进强相互作用和防止位点还原。在ZrO2基质中掺杂Cu已被证明可以增加活性Zrcus位点的数量，从而导致高丙烯选择性和初始反应速率。CrOx和ZrOx在二元氧化物中的协同效应也可以提高Zrcus基催化剂的催化性能。P改性Mo/ZSM-5催化剂用于EDH反应，可以降低酸性性质，改变沸石通道纹理。使用DFT计算的理论研究为Ni(111)表面的PDH和副反应的催化机制提供了见解。通过还原固态离子交换制备的CHA沸石中表面孤立的[InH2]+离子可以作为通过协同和烷基机制进行选择性EDH反应的活性位点。这些进展通过优化活性位点性质、提高选择性和增强稳定性来应对催化剂设计的挑战，以满足工业应用的需求。

1.The literature does not provide specific information on the key strategies and approaches that have been recently developed to enhance the catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes. However, it does discuss various methods for improving catalyst performance, including the use of advanced synthesis strategies such as atomic layer deposition (ALD) and single-atom metal catalyst (SOMC) approaches to finely control the structure of active sites. The literature also highlights the importance of localizing metallic atoms or ions on metal oxide matrixes or zeolite frameworks through the strong metal-support interaction (SMSI) effect and confinement effect to create subnanometric or single-atom active sites. Additionally, the modification of geometric and electronic properties by promoter species can be regulated using favorable synthesis methods. The literature emphasizes the need for constructing stable structures for small-sized metallic or ionic active sites to maximize catalytic efficiency in selective alkane dehydrogenation reactions. It also discusses the critical role of selective activation of alkane C-H bonds and prohibition of C-C cleavage and other side reactions to achieve high olefin selectivity and long-term stability. The literature suggests that the understanding of catalyst structure-activity relationships and mechanisms for alkane oxidative dehydrogenation processes may provide a reference for the structural design of dehydrogenation catalysts. It also mentions the importance of addressing the issue of irreversible coke deposition for deactivation, which is a significant challenge for all dehydrogenation catalysts. Strategies to solve this problem include modifying the electronic properties of active metals or metal oxides, geometric modification of active sites through isolation effects, and elimination of possible active sites responsible for coking on selected supports. The literature also notes that the reaction atmosphere, including the co-feeding of steam vapor and hydrogen, can affect the formation of coke species. However, it highlights the need for further research to systematically discuss the catalytic roles of co-fed gases in alkane dehydrogenation reactions over non-platinum catalysts. Finally, the literature discusses the challenge of dynamic structural stability of metallic or ionic active sites during the reaction and regeneration treatment, and suggests that a moderate interaction among metals, promoters, and supports will be pivotal for the design of dehydrogenation catalysts.
