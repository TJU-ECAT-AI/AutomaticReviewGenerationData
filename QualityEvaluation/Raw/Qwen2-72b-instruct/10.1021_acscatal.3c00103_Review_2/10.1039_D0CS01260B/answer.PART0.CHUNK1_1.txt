1.The literature does not provide specific information on the key strategies and approaches that have been recently developed to enhance the catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes. However, it does discuss various methods for improving the performance of dehydrogenation catalysts, including the use of advanced synthesis strategies like atomic layer deposition (ALD) and single-atom metal catalyst (SOMC) approaches to finely control the structure of active sites. The literature also highlights the importance of localizing metallic atoms or ions on metal oxide matrixes or zeolite frameworks through the strong metal-support interaction (SMSI) effect and confinement effect to create subnanometric or single-atom active sites. These strategies can help maximize catalytic efficiency in selective alkane dehydrogenation reactions by stabilizing the structure of small-sized metallic or ionic active sites. Additionally, the literature emphasizes the need to understand the structure-activity relationship and mechanism of alkane oxidative dehydrogenation processes, which can provide insights into the design of dehydrogenation catalysts. It also discusses the role of oxygen species in the gas phase, lattice phase, and on the interface in the selective activation of C-H and C-C bonds in light hydrocarbons. Furthermore, the literature mentions the importance of addressing the issue of irreversible coke deposition, which is a major challenge for all dehydrogenation catalysts. Strategies to mitigate this problem include modifying the electronic properties of active metals or metal oxides, using geometric modification to prevent the strong adsorption of coke precursors, and employing supports with reduced acidity or high-silica zeolites to minimize side reactions. The literature also suggests that the co-feeding of steam vapor and hydrogen can reduce the amount of coke species formed during dehydrogenation reactions. However, the literature notes that there is a lack of systematic studies on the catalytic roles of co-fed gases in alkane dehydrogenation reactions over non-Pt catalysts. Finally, the literature highlights the need to consider the dynamic structural stability of metallic or ionic active sites during the reaction and regeneration treatment, as overly strong interactions can lead to reduced accessibility or intrinsic activity of the active sites.

1.文献没有提供关于最近开发的增强支撑金属催化剂在直接脱氢过程中催化稳定性的关键策略和方法的具体信息。但是，它确实讨论了各种方法来提高脱氢催化剂的性能，包括使用原子层沉积（ALD）和单原子金属催化剂（SOMC）等高级合成策略来精细控制活性位点的结构。文献还强调了通过强金属-支撑相互作用（SMSI）效应和限制效应将金属原子或离子定位在金属氧化物基质或沸石框架上以创建亚纳米或单原子活性位点的重要性。这些策略可以通过稳定小尺寸金属或离子活性位点的结构来帮助在选择性烷烃脱氢反应中最大化催化效率。此外，文献强调了理解烷烃氧化脱氢过程的结构-活性关系和机制的重要性，这可以为脱氢催化剂的设计提供见解。它还讨论了气体相、晶格相和界面氧物种在轻烃中C-H和C-C键的选择性活化中的作用。此外，文献提到解决不可逆焦炭沉积问题的重要性，这是所有脱氢催化剂面临的主要挑战。缓解这个问题的策略包括修改活性金属或金属氧化物的电子性质，使用几何修饰来防止焦炭前体的强烈吸附，以及使用减少酸性或高硅沸石的支撑来最小化副反应。文献还建议共喂入蒸汽和氢气可以减少脱氢反应中形成的焦炭物种的数量。然而，文献指出，关于非Pt催化剂上共喂气体在烷烃脱氢反应中的催化作用的系统研究很少。最后，文献强调了在反应和再生处理过程中考虑金属或离子活性位点的动态结构稳定性的重要性，因为过强的相互作用会导致活性位点的可及性或内在活性降低。
