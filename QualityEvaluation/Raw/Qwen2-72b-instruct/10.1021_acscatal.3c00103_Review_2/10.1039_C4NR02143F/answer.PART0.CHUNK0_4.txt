1.The literature does not provide information on the key strategies and approaches that have been recently developed to enhance the catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes. However, it does discuss the promotional effect of Cu on the catalytic performance of Pt/Al2O3 catalysts for propane dehydrogenation. The optimized loading content of Cu is 0.5 wt%, which increases the propylene selectivity to 90.8% with a propylene yield of 36.5%. The origin of the enhanced catalytic performance and anti-coking ability of the PtCu/Al2O3 catalyst is ascribed to the intimate interaction between Pt and Cu, which inhibits propylene adsorption and elevates the energy barrier of CC bond rupture.

1.文献没有提供关于最近开发的增强支撑金属催化剂在直接脱氢过程中的催化稳定性的关键策略和方法的信息。但是，它确实讨论了Cu对Pt/Al2O3催化剂在丙烷脱氢中的催化性能的促进作用。优化的Cu负载量为0.5 wt%，这将丙烯选择性提高到90.8%，丙烯产量为36.5%。PtCu/Al2O3催化剂增强的催化性能和抗焦炭能力的起源归因于Pt和Cu之间的密切相互作用，这抑制了丙烯的吸附并提高了CC键断裂的能量障碍。
