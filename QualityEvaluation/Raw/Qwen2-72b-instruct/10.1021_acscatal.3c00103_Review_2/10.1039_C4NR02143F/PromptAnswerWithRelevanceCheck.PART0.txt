Read the questions and answers provided below. First, critically assess the overall relevance of the answers provided to the set of questions asked.

If, upon your assessment, you find that the answers do not contain information that is relevant to the questions asked, stop your review process immediately and respond with a single sentence: "※※※※※※※The provided answers are not relevant to the questions.※※※※※※※". Do not provide any additional explanation or background information, only this sentence should be given as a response in case of irrelevant answers.

If, however, the answers are relevant to the questions asked, proceed to compile answers for each question according to the instructions below. Ensure to aggregate all the relevant answers from the multiple answer results provided in the document, and organize them sequentially by their order number, compiling the corresponding quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question.

If the provided answers' quotes are not differentiated by question, ensure to break them down and assign the quotes to each respective question, outputting them separately within each question's section.

To provide a comprehensive review, differentiate the responses into quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question based on the details given in the 'Answer' XML tags. Structure your review using the XML format showcased below if the answers are relevant to the questions asked:

1.The literature does not provide information on the key strategies and approaches that have been recently developed to enhance the catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes. However, it does discuss the promotional effect of Cu on the catalytic performance of Pt/Al2O3 catalysts for propane dehydrogenation. The optimized loading content of Cu is 0.5 wt%, which increases the propylene selectivity to 90.8% with a propylene yield of 36.5%. The origin of the enhanced catalytic performance and anti-coking ability of the PtCu/Al2O3 catalyst is ascribed to the intimate interaction between Pt and Cu, which inhibits propylene adsorption and elevates the energy barrier of CC bond rupture. The inhibited propylene adsorption diminishes the possibility of coke formation and suppresses the cracking reaction towards the formation of lighter hydrocarbons on PtCu/Al2O3, while a higher energy barrier for CC bond cleavage suppresses the methane formation.

1.文献没有提供关于最近开发的增强支撑金属催化剂在直接脱氢过程中的催化稳定性的关键策略和方法的信息。但是,它确实讨论了Cu对Pt/Al2O3催化剂在丙烷脱氢中的催化性能的促进作用。Cu的优化负载含量为0.5 wt%,这将丙烯选择性提高到90.8%,丙烯产量为36.5%。PtCu/Al2O3催化剂增强的催化性能和抗焦炭能力的起源归因于Pt和Cu之间的密切相互作用,这抑制了丙烯的吸附,并提高了CC键断裂的能量屏障。抑制的丙烯吸附降低了焦炭形成的可能性,并抑制了向PtCu/Al2O3上形成较轻烃类的裂解反应,而较高的CC键断裂能量屏障抑制了甲烷的形成。

1.The literature does not provide information on the key strategies and approaches that have been recently developed to enhance the catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes. However, it does mention that the addition of copper to a platinum-based catalyst improves its catalytic performance and stability for propane dehydrogenation. The optimized loading content of copper is 0.5 wt%, which increases the propylene selectivity to 90.8% with a propylene yield of 36.5%. The improved anti-coking ability of the PtCu/Al2O3 catalysts is due to the inhibition of propylene adsorption, which diminishes the possibility of coke formation and suppresses the cracking reactions towards lighter hydrocarbons on PtCu/Al2O3. Additionally, the copper addition improves propylene selectivity while suppressing methane formation since a higher energy barrier for CC bond cleavage is required on the PtCu/Al2O3 catalyst. The primary origin of the enhancement upon copper addition can be ascribed to the unique PtCu bimetallic interaction.

1.文献没有提供关于最近开发的关键策略和方法的信息，以增强直接脱氢过程中支撑金属催化剂的催化稳定性。但是，它确实提到在铂基催化剂中添加铜可以提高其在丙烷脱氢中的催化性能和稳定性。优化的铜含量为0.5 wt%，这将丙烯选择性提高到90.8%，丙烯产率为36.5%。PtCu/Al2O3催化剂的改进的抗焦炭能力是由于抑制了丙烯吸附，这降低了焦炭形成的可能性，并抑制了向PtCu/Al2O3上较轻的烃类的裂解反应。此外，铜的添加提高了丙烯选择性，同时抑制了甲烷的形成，因为PtCu/Al2O3催化剂上需要更高的CC键断裂能垒。铜添加后增强的主要来源可以归因于独特的PtCu双金属相互作用。
