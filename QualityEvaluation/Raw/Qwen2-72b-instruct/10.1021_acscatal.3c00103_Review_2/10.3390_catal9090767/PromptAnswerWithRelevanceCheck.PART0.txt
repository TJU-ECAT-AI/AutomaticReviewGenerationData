[1] "Extensive research efforts have been made to inhibit deactivation and improve propene selectivity of Pt-based catalysts by doping promoters of Sn [9,10], In [11,12], Ga [13,14] and Cu [15] to form bimetallic catalysts."
[2] "For example, PtIn [16] and PtGa [17,18] bimetallic nanoparticles (NPs) supported on calcined hydrotalcites (HT) show higher activity and selectivity in PDH, which has been attributed to the increased Pt dispersion and electron transfer from In or Ga to Pt [11,18]."
[3] "Besides promoters, another method is to modify Al2O3 support with ZnO [19], La2O3 [20] or TiO2 [21] or replace Al2O3 support with ZnAl2O4 [22], ZSM-5 [23] or Mg(Al)O oxide [8,24]."
[4] "Additionally, it has been verified that the single Pt atom sites on Pt-Sn/γ-Al2O3 with a sandwich structure are more favorable for PDH reaction than Pt ensembles [25,26]."
[5] "Gong et al. [15] also reported that the PtCu single atom alloys can enhance the propane conversion and propene selectivity simultaneously in PDH."
[6] "Whether as promoters or supports, an important aim of using them is to obtain highly and stably dispersed Pt-based catalysts so that improving PDH performance."
[7] "However, it is still difficult to break through these challenges for PDH reactions [27], and the exact Pt-M-support relationship is still unclear."
[8] "Therefore, it is extremely necessary to find more efficient methods to solve the problems mentioned above."

1.Recently developed strategies to enhance the catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes include the use of bimetallic catalysts formed by doping promoters such as Sn, In, Ga, and Cu, which can improve the dispersion of Pt and facilitate electron transfer. Another method is to modify the support, such as using ZnO, La2O3, TiO2, or replacing Al2O3 with other oxides. Single atom sites of Pt on a sandwich structure have also been found to be more favorable for PDH reactions than Pt ensembles. PtCu single atom alloys can simultaneously enhance propane conversion and propene selectivity. The goal of these strategies is to obtain highly and stably dispersed Pt-based catalysts to improve PDH performance. However, the exact relationship between Pt, the promoter, and the support is still unclear, and more efficient methods are needed to address the challenges in PDH reactions.

1.最近开发的策略，以增强直接脱氢过程中支撑金属催化剂的催化稳定性，包括使用通过掺入Sn，In，Ga和Cu等促进剂形成的双金属催化剂，这可以提高Pt的分散度并促进电子转移。另一种方法是修改支撑，例如使用ZnO，La2O3，TiO2，或替换Al2O3与其他氧化物。在三明治结构上Pt的单原子位点也被发现比Pt集合更有利于PDH反应。PtCu单原子合金可以同时增强丙烷转化率和丙烯选择性。这些策略的目标是获得高度和稳定分散的Pt基催化剂，以提高PDH性能。然而，Pt，促进剂和支撑之间的精确关系仍然不清楚，需要更有效的方法来解决PDH反应中的挑战。
