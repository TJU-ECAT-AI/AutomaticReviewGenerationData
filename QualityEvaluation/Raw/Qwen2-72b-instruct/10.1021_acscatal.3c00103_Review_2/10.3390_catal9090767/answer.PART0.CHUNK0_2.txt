[1] "Extensive research efforts have been made to inhibit deactivation and improve propene selectivity of Pt-based catalysts by doping promoters of Sn [9,10], In [11,12], Ga [13,14] and Cu [15] to form bimetallic catalysts."
[2] "For example, PtIn [16] and PtGa [17,18] bimetallic nanoparticles (NPs) supported on calcined hydrotalcites (HT) show higher activity and selectivity in PDH, which has been attributed to the increased Pt dispersion and electron transfer from In or Ga to Pt [11,18]."
[3] "Besides promoters, another method is to modify Al2O3 support with ZnO [19], La2O3 [20] or TiO2 [21] or replace Al2O3 support with ZnAl2O4 [22], ZSM-5 [23] or Mg(Al)O oxide [8,24]."
[4] "Additionally, it has been verified that the single Pt atom sites on Pt-Sn/γ-Al2O3 with a sandwich structure are more favorable for PDH reaction than Pt ensembles [25,26]."
[5] "Gong et al. [15] also reported that the PtCu single atom alloys can enhance the propane conversion and propene selectivity simultaneously in PDH."
[6] "Whether as promoters or supports, an important aim of using them is to obtain highly and stably dispersed Pt-based catalysts so that improving PDH performance."
[7] "However, it is still difficult to break through these challenges for PDH reactions [27], and the exact Pt-M-support relationship is still unclear."
[8] "Therefore, it is extremely necessary to find more efficient methods to solve the problems mentioned above."

1.Recently developed strategies to enhance the catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes include the use of bimetallic catalysts formed by doping promoters such as Sn, In, Ga, and Cu. These bimetallic catalysts, such as PtIn and PtGa, supported on calcined hydrotalcites, have shown higher activity and selectivity due to increased Pt dispersion and electron transfer. Another method involves modifying the Al2O3 support with materials like ZnO, La2O3, or TiO2, or replacing it with other oxides. Single Pt atom sites on Pt-Sn/γ-Al2O3 with a sandwich structure have also been found to be more favorable for the PDH reaction than Pt ensembles. PtCu single atom alloys have been reported to enhance propane conversion and propene selectivity simultaneously. The aim is to obtain highly and stably dispersed Pt-based catalysts to improve PDH performance. However, challenges in PDH reactions remain, and the exact relationship between Pt, the promoter, and the support is still unclear, necessitating the development of more efficient methods to address these issues.

1.最近开发的策略，以增强直接脱氢过程中支撑金属催化剂的催化稳定性，包括使用通过掺入Sn，In，Ga和Cu等促进剂形成的双金属催化剂。这些双金属催化剂，如PtIn和PtGa，支撑在煅烧水滑石上，由于Pt分散度的增加和电子转移，显示出更高的活性和选择性。另一种方法涉及使用ZnO，La2O3或TiO2等材料修改Al2O3支撑，或用其他氧化物代替它。单个Pt原子位点在具有三明治结构的Pt-Sn/γ-Al2O3上已被发现比Pt集合更有利于PDH反应。据报道，PtCu单原子合金可以同时增强丙烷转化率和丙烯选择性。目标是获得高度和稳定分散的Pt基催化剂，以提高PDH性能。然而，PDH反应中的挑战仍然存在，Pt，促进剂和支撑物之间的精确关系仍然不清楚，需要开发更有效的方法来解决这些问题。
