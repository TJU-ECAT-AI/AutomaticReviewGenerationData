[1] "Extensive research efforts have been made to inhibit deactivation and improve propene selectivity of Pt-based catalysts by doping promoters of Sn [9,10], In [11,12], Ga [13,14] and Cu [15] to form bimetallic catalysts."
[2] "Whether as promoters or supports, an important aim of using them is to obtain highly and stably dispersed Pt-based catalysts so that improving PDH performance."
[3] "In fact, the hierarchical morphology and porous structure play important roles in many heterogeneous catalytic reactions. However, the effect of hierarchical microstructure is seldom reported."
[4] "Given that the small Pt NPs and hierarchical microstructure may provide more stable and easily accessible active sites for PDH reaction, a promising design for obtaining the desired size of active Pt and hierarchical pore morphology was proposed."
[5] "The promoted effects of HT reconstruction on the microstructure and morphology of the 3D oxide nanosheet array catalyst, and the subsequently superior PDH performance, were profoundly discussed."

1.Recent strategies to enhance the catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes include the use of promoters like Sn, In, Ga, and Cu to form bimetallic catalysts, aiming to improve the dispersion and stability of Pt-based catalysts. The hierarchical morphology and porous structure of catalysts are also being explored to provide more stable and accessible active sites, which can improve the performance of PDH reactions. The reconstruction of hydrotalcite-like compounds has shown promising effects on the microstructure and morphology of 3D oxide nanosheet array catalysts, leading to superior PDH performance.
