[1] "Extensive research efforts have been made to inhibit deactivation and improve propene selectivity of Pt-based catalysts by doping promoters of Sn [9,10], In [11,12], Ga [13,14] and Cu [15] to form bimetallic catalysts."
[2] "For example, PtIn [16] and PtGa [17,18] bimetallic nanoparticles (NPs) supported on calcined hydrotalcites (HT) show higher activity and selectivity in PDH, which has been attributed to the increased Pt dispersion and electron transfer from In or Ga to Pt [11,18]."
[3] "Besides promoters, another method is to modify Al2O3 support with ZnO [19], La2O3 [20] or TiO2 [21] or replace Al2O3 support with ZnAl2O4 [22], ZSM-5 [23] or Mg(Al)O oxide [8,24]."
[4] "Additionally, it has been verified that the single Pt atom sites on Pt-Sn/γ-Al2O3 with a sandwich structure are more favorable for PDH reaction than Pt ensembles [25,26]."
[5] "Gong et al. [15] also reported that the PtCu single atom alloys can enhance the propane conversion and propene selectivity simultaneously in PDH."

1.Recently developed strategies to enhance the catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes include the use of bimetallic catalysts formed by doping promoters such as Sn, In, Ga, and Cu. These bimetallic catalysts, such as PtIn and PtGa nanoparticles supported on calcined hydrotalcites, exhibit higher activity and selectivity due to increased Pt dispersion and electron transfer from the promoter to Pt. Another approach is to modify the Al2O3 support with materials like ZnO, La2O3, or TiO2, or replace it with other oxides such as ZnAl2O4, ZSM-5, or Mg(Al)O. Single Pt atom sites on Pt-Sn/γ-Al2O3 with a sandwich structure have also been found to be more favorable for the PDH reaction than Pt ensembles. Additionally, PtCu single atom alloys have been reported to enhance propane conversion and propene selectivity simultaneously in PDH reactions.

1.最近开发的策略，以增强直接脱氢过程中支撑金属催化剂的催化稳定性，包括使用通过掺入Sn，In，Ga和Cu等促进剂形成的双金属催化剂。这些双金属催化剂，如在煅烧水滑石上支撑的PtIn和PtGa纳米粒子，由于Pt分散度的增加和从促进剂到Pt的电子转移，表现出更高的活性和选择性。另一种方法是使用ZnO，La2O3或TiO2等材料修改Al2O3支撑，或用其他氧化物如ZnAl2O4，ZSM-5或Mg(Al)O代替。单个Pt原子位点在具有三明治结构的Pt-Sn/γ-Al2O3上被发现比Pt集合更有利于PDH反应。此外，PtCu单原子合金已被报道可以同时增强PDH反应中的丙烷转化率和丙烯选择性。
