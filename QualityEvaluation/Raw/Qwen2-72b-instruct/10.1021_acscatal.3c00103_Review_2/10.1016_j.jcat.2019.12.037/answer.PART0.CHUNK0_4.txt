1.The literature does not provide specific strategies or approaches for enhancing the catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes. However, it does report the development of a CoSiBeta catalyst with state-of-the-art productivity for direct dehydrogenation of propane to propylene. The catalyst features ultrasmall-sized Co particles confined in the silanols of dealuminated Beta zeolite, which are highly efficient and selective for the PDH reaction. The confined CoOx species are easily reducible to small metallic Co particles, which are the active sites for PDH. The high catalytic ability and product selectivity of these small confined Co particles provide novel inspiration for the design of low-cost, ecofriendly, and advanced catalysts for PDH.

1.文献没有提供增强直接脱氢过程中支撑金属催化剂催化稳定性的具体策略或方法。但是，它报告了CoSiBeta催化剂的开发，该催化剂具有最先进的丙烷直接脱氢为丙烯的生产力。该催化剂具有在脱铝化Beta沸石的硅醇中限制的超小Co颗粒，对PDH反应具有高效率和选择性。限制的CoOx物种容易还原为小金属Co颗粒，这些颗粒是PDH的活性位点。这些小限制Co颗粒的高催化能力和产品选择性为设计低成本、环保和先进的PDH催化剂提供了新的启示。
