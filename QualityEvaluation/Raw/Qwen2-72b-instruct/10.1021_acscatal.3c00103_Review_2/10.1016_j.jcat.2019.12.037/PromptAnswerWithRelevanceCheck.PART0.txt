1.The literature does not provide specific strategies or approaches for enhancing the catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes. However, it does report the development of a CoSiBeta catalyst with high catalytic activity and selectivity for the direct dehydrogenation of propane to propylene. The catalyst features ultrasmall-sized Co particles confined in the silanols of dealuminated Beta zeolite, which are highly efficient for catalyzing the reaction. The CoOx species within the zeolite can be easily reduced to metallic Co particles under H2 or reactant gas, and these particles are the active sites for the PDH reaction. The high catalytic ability and product selectivity of small confined Co particles are proven, providing novel inspiration for the design of low-cost, ecofriendly, and advanced catalysts for PDH.

1.文献没有提供增强直接脱氢过程中支撑金属催化剂催化稳定性的具体策略或方法。但是，它确实报道了一种CoSiBeta催化剂的开发，该催化剂具有高催化活性和选择性，用于直接将丙烷脱氢为丙烯。该催化剂的特点是超小尺寸的Co颗粒被限制在脱铝Beta沸石的硅醇中，对催化反应非常有效。沸石内的CoOx物种在H2或反应气体下可轻松还原为金属Co颗粒，这些颗粒是PDH反应的活性位点。小限制Co颗粒的高催化能力和产品选择性得到证实，为设计低成本、环保和先进的PDH催化剂提供了新的启示。

1.The literature does not provide information on the key strategies and approaches that have been recently developed to enhance the catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes. However, it does mention that the earth abundance of Co bodes well for long-term utility, and it has been reported to show a certain degree of catalytic activity for PDH. The literature also discusses the preparation of cobalt catalysts supported on dealuminated Beta (SiBeta) based on Dzwigaj's method, followed by high-temperature calcination in air to obtain CoSiBeta catalysts for PDH. After prereduction under optimum conditions, the 0.5CoSiBeta catalyst (Co loading is 0.5 wt%) showed propane conversion as high as 72% with propylene selectivity of around 92%. The literature suggests that the small metallic Co particles confined in silanols are active sites, and bulk Co3O4 and large Co0 particles on SiBeta support contribute to cracking and carbon deposition, respectively.

1.文献没有提供关于最近开发的关键策略和方法的信息，这些策略和方法旨在提高直接脱氢过程中支撑金属催化剂的催化稳定性。但是，文献确实提到Co的地球丰度有利于长期应用，并且据报道在PDH中表现出一定的催化活性。文献还讨论了基于Dzwigaj的方法制备支持在脱铝Beta（SiBeta）上的钴催化剂，然后在空气中进行高温煅烧以获得用于PDH的CoSiBeta催化剂。在最佳条件下预还原后，0.5CoSiBeta催化剂（Co负载为0.5 wt%）的丙烷转化率高达72%，丙烯选择性约为92%。文献表明，小的金属Co颗粒被限制在硅醇中是活性位点，而SiBeta支撑上的大块Co3O4和大Co0颗粒分别导致裂解和碳沉积。
