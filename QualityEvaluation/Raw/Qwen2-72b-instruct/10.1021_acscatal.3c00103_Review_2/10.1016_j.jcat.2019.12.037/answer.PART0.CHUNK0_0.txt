1.The literature does not provide specific strategies or approaches for enhancing the catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes. However, it does report the development of a CoSiBeta catalyst with high catalytic activity and selectivity for the direct dehydrogenation of propane to propylene. The catalyst features ultrasmall-sized Co particles confined in the silanols of dealuminated Beta zeolite, which are highly efficient for catalyzing the reaction. The CoOx species within the zeolite can be easily reduced to metallic Co particles under H2 or reactant gas, and these particles are the active sites for the PDH reaction. The high catalytic ability and product selectivity of small confined Co particles are proven, providing novel inspiration for the design of low-cost, ecofriendly, and advanced catalysts for PDH.

1.文献没有提供增强直接脱氢过程中支撑金属催化剂催化稳定性的具体策略或方法。但是，它确实报道了一种CoSiBeta催化剂的开发，该催化剂具有高催化活性和选择性，用于直接将丙烷脱氢为丙烯。该催化剂的特点是超小尺寸的Co颗粒被限制在脱铝Beta沸石的硅醇中，对催化反应非常有效。沸石内的CoOx物种在H2或反应气体下可轻松还原为金属Co颗粒，这些颗粒是PDH反应的活性位点。小限制Co颗粒的高催化能力和产品选择性得到证实，为设计低成本、环保和先进的PDH催化剂提供了新的启示。
