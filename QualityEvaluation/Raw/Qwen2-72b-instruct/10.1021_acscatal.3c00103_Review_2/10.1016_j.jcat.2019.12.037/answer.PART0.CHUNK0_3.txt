1.The literature does not provide specific strategies or approaches for enhancing the catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes. However, it does report the development of a CoSiBeta catalyst that shows high catalytic activity and selectivity for the direct dehydrogenation of propane to propylene. The catalyst features ultrasmall Co particles confined in the silanols of dealuminated Beta zeolite, which are highly active and selective for the PDH reaction. The literature suggests that the confined CoOx species can be easily reduced to metallic Co particles under reaction conditions, which are the active sites for PDH. The high catalytic ability and product selectivity of these small confined Co particles provide novel inspiration for the design of low-cost, eco-friendly, and advanced catalysts for PDH.

1.文献没有提供增强直接脱氢过程中支撑金属催化剂催化稳定性的具体策略或方法。但是，它确实报道了一种CoSiBeta催化剂的开发，该催化剂在直接脱氢过程中表现出高催化活性和选择性，将丙烷转化为丙烯。该催化剂的特点是超小的Co颗粒被限制在脱铝Beta沸石的硅醇中，对PDH反应具有高活性和选择性。文献表明，被限制的CoOx物种在反应条件下可以容易地还原为金属Co颗粒，这些颗粒是PDH的活性位点。这些小的限制Co颗粒的高催化能力和产品选择性为设计低成本、环保和先进的PDH催化剂提供了新的启示。
