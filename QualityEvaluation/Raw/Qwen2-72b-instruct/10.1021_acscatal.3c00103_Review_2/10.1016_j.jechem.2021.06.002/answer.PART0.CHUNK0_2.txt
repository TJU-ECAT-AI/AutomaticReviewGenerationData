[1] "Pt-based catalysts are widely used in propane dehydrogenation reaction for the production of propylene. Suppressing irreversible deactivation caused by the sintering of Pt particles under harsh conditions and regeneration process is a significant challenge in this catalyst."

[2] "Herein, a series of highly ordered mesoporous Al2O3 supports with different levels of Al3+penta sites, are fabricated and used as the support to disperse Pt-Sn2 clusters."

[3] "The stability and regenerability of Pt-Sn2/meso-Al2O3 are strongly dependent on the content of Al3+penta sites in the Al2O3 structure, and a high level of Al3+penta sites can effectively prevent the agglomeration of Pt-Sn2 clusters into large Pt nanoparticles in the consecutive dehydrogenation-regeneration cycles."

1.Recent advancements in catalyst design for propane dehydrogenation include the use of Pt-Sn clusters anchored on mesoporous Al2O3 supports with a high content of Al3+penta sites. This strategy addresses the challenge of sintering by stabilizing Pt-based particles via the formation of an Al-O-Pt bond, preventing agglomeration into larger nanoparticles during dehydrogenation-regeneration cycles. The high level of Al3+penta sites enhances the stability and regenerability of the catalyst, making it suitable for industrial applications.
