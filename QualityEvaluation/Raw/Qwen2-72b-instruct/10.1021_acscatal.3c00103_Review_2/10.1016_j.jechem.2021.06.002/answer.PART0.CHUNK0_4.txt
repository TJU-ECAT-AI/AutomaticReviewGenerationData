[1] "Pt-based catalysts are widely used in propane dehydrogenation reaction for the production of propylene. Suppressing irreversible deactivation caused by the sintering of Pt particles under harsh conditions and regeneration process is a significant challenge in this catalyst."
[2] "Herein, a series of highly ordered mesoporous Al2O3 supports with different levels of Al3+penta sites, are fabricated and used as the support to disperse Pt-Sn2 clusters."
[3] "The coordinatively unsaturated pentacoordinate Al3+ (Al3+penta) can strongly anchor Pt atoms via a formation of Al-O-Pt bond, and thus stabilize the Pt-based particles at the surface of Al2O3."
[4] "The stability and regenerability of Pt-Sn2/meso-Al2O3 are strongly dependent on the content of Al3+penta sites in the Al2O3 structure, and a high level of Al3+penta sites can effectively prevent the agglomeration of Pt-Sn2 clusters into large Pt nanoparticles in the consecutive dehydrogenation-regeneration cycles."

1.Recent advancements in catalyst design for direct dehydrogenation processes include the use of Pt-Sn clusters anchored on Al3+penta sites of mesoporous Al2O3. This strategy addresses the challenge of sintering by stabilizing Pt particles through the formation of an Al-O-Pt bond, which prevents agglomeration into larger nanoparticles during dehydrogenation-regeneration cycles. The stability and regenerability of the catalyst are enhanced by the high content of Al3+penta sites in the Al2O3 structure.

1.最近在直接脱氢过程的催化剂设计方面的进展包括使用Pt-Sn簇锚定在Al2O3的Al3+penta位点上。这种策略通过形成Al-O-Pt键来稳定Pt颗粒，以解决烧结的挑战，防止在脱氢-再生循环中聚集成更大的纳米颗粒。催化剂的稳定性和可再生性通过Al2O3结构中Al3+penta位点的高含量而得到增强。
