[1] "Pt-Sn clusters anchored at Al3+penta sites as a sinter-resistant and regenerable catalyst for propane dehydrogenation"
[2] "Herein, a series of highly ordered mesoporous Al2O3 supports with different levels of Al3+penta sites, are fabricated and used as the support to disperse Pt-Sn2 clusters."
[3] "The stability and regenerability of Pt-Sn2/meso-Al2O3 are strongly dependent on the content of Al3+penta sites in the Al2O3 structure, and a high level of Al3+penta sites can effectively prevent the agglomeration of Pt-Sn2 clusters into large Pt nanoparticles in the consecutive dehydrogenation-regeneration cycles."

1.Recent advancements in catalyst design for direct dehydrogenation processes include the use of Pt-Sn clusters anchored at Al3+penta sites on mesoporous Al2O3 supports. These supports are fabricated with different levels of Al3+penta sites to disperse Pt-Sn2 clusters. The stability and regenerability of the Pt-Sn2/meso-Al2O3 catalysts are strongly dependent on the content of Al3+penta sites, with a high level of these sites effectively preventing the agglomeration of Pt-Sn2 clusters into large Pt nanoparticles during consecutive dehydrogenation-regeneration cycles.

1.直接脱氢过程中的催化剂设计的最新进展包括使用Pt-Sn簇在Al2O3介孔支撑的Al3+penta位点上锚定。这些支撑材料具有不同水平的Al3+penta位点，用于分散Pt-Sn2簇。Pt-Sn2/meso-Al2O3催化剂的稳定性和可再生性强烈依赖于Al2O3结构中Al3+penta位点的含量，高水平的这些位点可以有效地防止在连续脱氢-再生循环中Pt-Sn2簇聚集成大Pt纳米粒子。
