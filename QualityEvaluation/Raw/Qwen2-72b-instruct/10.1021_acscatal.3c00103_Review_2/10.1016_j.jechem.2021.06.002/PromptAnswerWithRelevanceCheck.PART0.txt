[1] "Pt-Sn clusters anchored at Al3+penta sites as a sinter-resistant and regenerable catalyst for propane dehydrogenation"
[2] "Herein, a series of highly ordered mesoporous Al2O3 supports with different levels of Al3+penta sites, are fabricated and used as the support to disperse Pt-Sn2 clusters."
[3] "The stability and regenerability of Pt-Sn2/meso-Al2O3 are strongly dependent on the content of Al3+penta sites in the Al2O3 structure, and a high level of Al3+penta sites can effectively prevent the agglomeration of Pt-Sn2 clusters into large Pt nanoparticles in the consecutive dehydrogenation-regeneration cycles."

1.Recent advancements in catalyst design for direct dehydrogenation processes include the use of Pt-Sn clusters anchored at Al3+penta sites on mesoporous Al2O3 supports. These supports are fabricated with different levels of Al3+penta sites to disperse Pt-Sn2 clusters. The stability and regenerability of the Pt-Sn2/meso-Al2O3 catalysts are strongly dependent on the content of Al3+penta sites, with a high level of these sites effectively preventing the agglomeration of Pt-Sn2 clusters into large Pt nanoparticles during consecutive dehydrogenation-regeneration cycles.
