          [1] "To expose the loaded Pt on the surface of the carriers, ion exchange and impregnation are two simple and practical methods. The dispersion of Pt mainly depends on the precursors of Pt, the preparation conditions, the properties of the carriers, and the interaction between Pt and the carriers, as well as the additives."
          [2] "The addition of a second metal has been found to be highly effective for the sintering resistance of Pt particles. The introduced metal forms alloys with Pt around Pt particles,63 and the alloys anchor them on the surface of the carriers, making them not easy to migrate and coalesce."
          [3] "The application of the carriers possessing a strong interaction with Pt is another way to retard the sintering. Al2O3 is the most common carrier of Pt catalyst, in which the coordinatively unsaturated pentacoordinate Al3+ can anchor Pt to make it not easy to migrate."
          [4] "Nanocarbon was also reported as the carrier of Pt to improve the sintering resistance, and the strong metalcarrier interaction leads to the electron transfer from nanocarbon to the Pt particles, significantly preventing the sintering of Pt."
          [5] "MgAl2O4 spinel is also a good choice as the carrier. Generally, Pt is not directly loaded on MgAl2O4 spinel prepared beforehand, but firstly loaded into the spaces between the layers of MgAlOx hydrotalcite, and then Pt particles are enclosed in the interspace of MgAl2O4 spinel formed through the collapse of the layered structure of the hydrotalcite after calcination at high temperature."
          [6] "Moliner et al.67 reported effective methods to encapsulate Pt in highly siliceous chabazite, and the catalyst showed enhanced stability towards Pt sintering even at 650750 C in the atmospheres of H2, O2 and H2O."
          [7] "The Al2O3 overcoat has also proved to be efficient in preventing the sintering of Pt nanoparticles through atomic layer deposition."
          [8] "Tanabe et al. revealed that no Pt sintering was observed for Pt/MgO as an automotive exhaust catalyst after calcination in air at 900 C, for the formation of a Mg2PtO4-like compound prevents the migration of Pt."
          [9] "Nagai et al. found that CeO2 had a similar effect of MgO in preventing the sintering of Pt due to the formation of the PtOCe bond in the Pt/CeO2 catalyst."
          [10] "Recently, Pt supported on CeO2 has attracted more attention because of the ability of CeO2 to trap Pt in an atomically dispersed state."
          [11] "The atomically dispersed Pt is most likely to be present in the form of Pt2+ bonded to the ubiquitous step edges of the CeO2 surface."
          [12] "The addition of Ga, In, Zn, Cu, Ir, Co to Pt catalysts exhibits similar effects as Sn."
          [13] "Not only that, but Sattler et al.84 showed that in the highly active, selective and stable PtGaK/Al2O3 (0.1 wt% Pt, 3 wt% Ga, 0.25 wt% K) catalyst for the dehydrogenation of propane, the coordinately unsaturated Ga3+ is responsible for activating the CH bond, and Pt only acts as a promoter."
          [14] "Furthermore, just like the PtSn/CeO2 catalyst,29 the reactivity can be fully recovered via simple coke burning in air, although the sintering of Pt still occurs."
          [15] "Located at the same main group with Ga, In was also reported to be the promoter of supported Pt catalysts. The PtIn/Mg(Al)O catalyst prepared at pH 8 using the co-precipitation method exhibits the best catalytic performance and the strongest interaction between the metal phase and the carrier."
          [16] "B and Si, two nonmetal elements, can play similar roles, too. Dehydrogenation of n-butane over the PtB/SiO2 catalyst showed improved catalytic activity and stability compared with Pt/SiO2."
          [17] "Dadras et al.86 called B a magic bullet against sintering and coking, and they summarized the positive roles of B as follows. The non-stoichiometric PtB cluster is anchored to the carrier via a covalent BO bond, which is much stronger than the interaction between Pt clusters and the carrier surface."
          [18] "Additionally, the dissociation energy of a Pt atom from a PtB cluster is significantly larger than that from the pure Pt cluster, increasing the sintering resistance."
          [19] "Finally, the affinity of PtB cluster to C also drops dramatically, leading to the reduced coke formation and increased selectivity to olefins."
          [20] "It is predicted by a computational screening of main-group elements as potential additives for the Pt catalyst that Si, just as B, can modify the selectivity of the Pt catalyst by changing both electronic and geometric properties."

          Recent strategies to enhance the catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes include optimizing the dispersion of Pt on the surface of carriers through ion exchange and impregnation, using additives to form alloys with Pt to anchor it on the carrier surface, and selecting carriers with strong interaction with Pt to prevent migration and coalescence. Pt can be loaded into the spaces between the layers of MgAlOx hydrotalcite and enclosed in the interspace of MgAl2O4 spinel to prevent migration. Pt can also be encapsulated in highly siliceous chabazite or coated with Al2O3 through atomic layer deposition to prevent sintering. Pt/MgO and Pt/CeO2 have been found to prevent Pt sintering due to the formation of a Mg2PtO4-like compound and the PtOCe bond, respectively. Atomically dispersed Pt on CeO2 can also prevent sintering. Adding Ga, In, Zn, Cu, Ir, Co to Pt catalysts can have similar effects as Sn in improving stability. B and Si can also play similar roles in preventing sintering and coking. The non-stoichiometric PtB cluster anchored to the carrier via a covalent BO bond can prevent sintering and reduce coke formation. Boration can reduce the binding energy of olefins and the tendency towards coke precursors. Computational screening predicts that Si can modify the selectivity of the Pt catalyst by changing both electronic and geometric properties.

          最近开发的策略，以增强直接脱氢过程中支撑金属催化剂的催化稳定性，包括通过离子交换和浸渍优化Pt在载体表面的分散，使用添加剂与Pt形成合金，将其锚定在载体表面，以及选择与Pt有强相互作用的载体，以防止迁移和团聚。Pt可以被加载到MgAlOx水滑石层之间的空间，并被封闭在MgAl2O4尖晶石的间隙中，以防止迁移。Pt也可以被封装在高度硅化的查巴石中，或通过原子层沉积用Al2O3涂层，以防止烧结。发现Pt/MgO和Pt/CeO2可以防止Pt烧结，因为形成了Mg2PtO4样化合物和PtOCe键。在CeO2上原子分散的Pt也可以防止烧结。向Pt催化剂中添加Ga、In、Zn、Cu、Ir、Co可以产生与Sn相似的效果，提高稳定性。B和Si也可以发挥类似的作用，防止烧结和焦化。非化学计量的PtB簇通过共价BO键锚定在载体上，可以防止烧结，减少焦炭的形成。硼化可以降低烯烃的结合能和形成焦炭前体的倾向。计算筛选预测，Si可以通过改变电子和几何性质来修改Pt催化剂的选择性。
