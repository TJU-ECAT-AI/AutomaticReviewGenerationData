          [2] "Herein, a series of highly ordered mesoporous Al2O3 supports with different levels of Al3+penta sites, are fabricated and used as the support to disperse Pt-Sn2 clusters."
          [3] "The stability and regenerability of Pt-Sn2/meso-Al2O3 are strongly dependent on the content of Al3+penta sites in the Al2O3 structure, and a high level of Al3+penta sites can effectively prevent the agglomeration of Pt-Sn2 clusters into large Pt nanoparticles in the consecutive dehydrogenation-regeneration cycles."



[1] "Rare-earthplatinum alloy nanoparticles in mesoporous zeolite for catalysis Platinum is a much used catalyst that, in petrochemical processes, is often alloyed with other metals to improve catalytic activity, selectivity and longevity1,2,3,4,5."
          [2] "Such catalysts are usually prepared in the form of metallic nanoparticles supported on porous solids, and their production involves reducing metal precursor compounds under a H2 flow at high temperatures6."
          [3] "The method works well when using easily reducible late transition metals, but Pt alloy formation with rare-earth elements through the H2 reduction route is almost impossible owing to the low chemical potential of rare-earth element oxides6."
          [4] "Here we use as support a mesoporous zeolite that has pore walls with surface framework defects (called silanol nests) and show that the zeolite enables alloy formation between Pt and rare-earth elements."
          [5] "We find that the silanol nests enable the rare-earth elements to exist as single atomic species with a substantially higher chemical potential compared with that of the bulk oxide, making it possible for them to diffuse onto Pt."
          [6] "High-resolution transmission electron microscopy and hydrogen chemisorption measurements indicate that the resultant bimetallic nanoparticles supported on the mesoporous zeolite are intermetallic compounds, which we find to be stable, highly active and selective catalysts for the propane dehydrogenation reaction."
          [7] "When used with late transition metals, the same preparation strategy produces Pt alloy catalysts that incorporate an unusually large amount of the second metal and, in the case of the PtCo alloy, show high catalytic activity and selectivity in the preferential oxidation of carbon monoxide in H2."
          [8] "The industrial PDH process has been using PtSn bimetallic catalysts supported on porous alumina for nearly three decades, since its discovery in the early 1990s3,7."
          [9] "The Pt metal alone exhibits high initial catalytic activity, but rapidly deactivates as a result of coke deposition on the Pt surface."
          [10] "The coke deposition also causes an undesirable loss of the catalytic selectivity to propylene."
          [11] "To alleviate these problems, Sn is introduced to form an alloy with Pt nanoparticles and thereby dilute the Pt surface with inactive Sn atoms and break up coke-generating Pt ensembles."
          [12] "Our search for a highly active and more durable PDH catalyst has focused on using a siliceous MFI zeolite with a hierarchical micro-/mesoporous structure as a replacement for the alumina support."
          [13] "This zeolite, synthesized using a multi-ammonium surfactant as a structure-directing agent, has attracted attention as an advanced catalyst support8,9,10,11,12,13 owing to its unique structure, which comprises ultrathin zeolite frameworks and three-dimensionally interconnected mesopores that boost the catalytic performance of supported metals by providing both facile reactant and product diffusion and high metal nanoparticle dispersion within the mesopores12,13."
          [14] "The formation of the Pt3La and Pt3Y nanoparticles on the degallated zeolite brought a striking enhancement in all aspects of the PDH catalytic performance, including activity, selectivity and durability, as shown in Fig. 2."
          [15] "The catalytic reaction was performed at 580C using a pure propane flow at a large space velocity (see Methods), and these harsh operating conditions caused even the conventional PtSn/alumina catalyst to experience severe coke formation and catalyst deactivation within 1 d."
          [16] "In sharp contrast, the Pt3La intermetallic nanoparticles supported on the degallated zeolite (denoted as PtLa/mz-deGa, where mz stands for mesoporous zeolite) showed a high initial propane conversion of 40% (close to the equilibrium conversion) and underwent extremely slow deactivation, retaining 8% conversion even after 30 days of reaction."
          [17] "The PtREE incorporation in the mesoporous zeolite was conducted by co-impregnation of aqueous solutions of Pt(NH3)4(NO3)2 and either La(NO3)3·6H2O or Y(NO3)3·6H2O, followed by heating under an O2 flow at 350C and subsequently under H2 at 700C (see Methods)."
          [18] "The formation of the Pt3La and Pt3Y nanoparticles on the degallated zeolite brought a striking enhancement in all aspects of the PDH catalytic performance, including activity, selectivity and durability, as shown in Fig. 2."
          [19] "The PtREE/zeolite showed formation of Pt3La and Pt3Y nanoparticles throughout the zeolite support."
          [20] "The PtREE/zeolite sample shown in Fig. 1 was prepared using a degallated zeolite containing a large number of silanol nest sites."
          [21] "The PtREE/zeolite showed a high initial propane conversion of 40% (close to the equilibrium conversion) and underwent extremely slow deactivation, retaining 8% conversion even after 30 days of reaction."
          [22] "The PtREE/zeolite contained a small amount of Ga (Si/Ga = 598) even after the degallation, and that this may participate in the catalytic function17,18."
          [23] "The effect of the remaining Ga was examined from the differences in PDH performance of mz-deGa, La/mz-deGa and Pt/mz-deGa, as shown in Extended Data Fig. 7."
          [24] "The PtREE/zeolite as a support would allow the discovery of not only REE-based alloy catalysts, but also other transition metal-based alloy catalysts with various compositions and structures, opening up new opportunities for catalytic applications."

[1] "Although the equilibrium conversion of alkanes increases with temperature, alkene selectivity decreases with increasing temperature and chain length due to an increased tendency toward dehydrocyclization/aromatisation, thermal cracking and coke formation."
          [2] "Direct dehydrogenation of lower alkanes is an energy intensive reaction; however, oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) has the potential to lower the energy requirement for achieving dehydrogenation."
          [3] "ODH can be considered as tandem endothermic (dehydrogenation, CnH2n + 2  CnH2n + H2) and exothermic (oxidation, H2 + O2  H2O) processes, with an overall thermodynamic summation, CnH2n + 2 + O2  CnH2n + H2O."
          [4] "Although the process is not thermo-neutral, part of the energy required for the endothermic reaction is augmented by the exothermic reaction."
          [5] "Thus, ODH of alkanes takes place at lower temperature compared to the corresponding non-ODH."
          [6] "This lower temperature requirement of ODH compared to non-ODH and cracking is encouraging and provides motivation for continued efforts to develop ODH into an industrial technology."
          [7] "Although ODH is attractive because of the energy intensification advantage, commercial ODH technologies hinge on innovative catalyst and process design, i.e. proper synergy of the endothermic dehydrogenation step with the exothermic hydrogen combustion and design of selective CH and hydrogen combustion catalysts."
          [8] "In this report, we provide an overview on CH activation and reaction routes to alkane dehydrogenation."
          [9] "We seek to gain insights about components of the active sites of CH activation to provide a platform for rational design of new efficient catalysts for dehydrogenation of lower alkanes."
          [10] "We focus on propane dehydrogenation because of the need for alternative and/or complementary technology for propene production to supplement existing technologies."
          [11] "We survey non-oxidative and oxidative dehydrogenation approaches, and examine reaction routes that are intermediate between these two main approaches."
          [12] "Catalyst improvement endeavors can benefit from insights on alkane CH bond activation mechanisms."
          [13] "Developing direct routes to obtain key organic chemicals from lower alkanes would benefit industry."
          [14] "Lower alkanes are relatively inert, and they exhibit little or no reactivity at conditions typical for activating functional group reactions in organic compounds because they lack low-lying vacant orbitals or lone pair electrons."
          [15] "Alkanes are made up non-polar CC and CH bonds. These bonds consist of strongly localised electron pairs that are usually induced to reactivity under severe conditions (e.g., at high temperature or pressure, or with the use of aggressive reagents)."
          [16] "The first and rate-limiting step of alkane dehydrogenation using platinum or chromium oxide-based catalysts involves CH activation."
          [17] "Although a number of efforts have been made to gain insight on the mechanism of the reaction, questions still remain, especially regarding the pathway of the CH activation."
          [18] "It is of fundamental and applied interest to know whether the first CH bond cleavage is homolytic or heterolytic."
          [19] "If it is a heterolytic pathway, it will further be of interest to know whether the first hydrogen from the alkane substrate is abstracted as a proton or as a hydride ion."
          [20] "This knowledge will benefit catalyst improvement efforts."
          [21] "The simple impregnation techniques for preparing supported (especially alumina) metal and oxide catalysts becloud their structural heterogeneity."
          [22] "This structural heterogeneity makes the properties-performance correlation of the catalysts complicated."
          [23] "Microporous zeolites are structurally defined framework materials that may constitute a good starting point for obtaining more precise information on the properties-performance correlation of dehydrogenation catalysts."
          [24] "In the next section, we examine adsorption and non-oxidative dehydrogenation of propane on microporous zeolite-based catalysts."
          [25] "Although several solid acid catalysts are used in alkane conversions, zeolites have the advantage of possessing a well-defined structure, allowing the structure-activity relationship to be easily deduced."
          [26] "Therefore, it is instructive to examine non-oxidative dehydrogenation of light alkanes over zeolite catalysts."
          [27] "A detailed knowledge of the adsorption mechanism of lower alkane molecules on zeolite is of interest in this context, especially for informed tuning of zeolite properties to allow efficient and selective dehydrogenation of alkanes."
          [28] "Light alkanes are adsorbed on zeolites via dispersive interaction."
          [29] "Protons and the exchanged metals ions are typically the active sites in zeolites, while the zeolite framework plays the role of anchor for the active sites and/or dispersion medium for the reactants."
          [30] "The framework of microporous zeolites exerts dispersive forces on the reactant's molecules that depend on the shape, channel and cavity of the framework."
          [31] "In addition, the nature and the density of the active sites influence the framework dispersion forces."
          [32] "Recent reports have shown that the strong electrostatic field between protons or exchanged metal ions and basic oxygen species can enhance and/or induce polarization of bonds in hydrocarbon adsorbates."
          [33] "This agrees with Hashiguchi et al., who found enhanced activation of the CH bond on a homogeneous catalyst."
          [34] "Wender et al. showed that 3040% of heat adsorption in n-alkanes on Na-zeolite is due to polarization of the adsorbates."
          [35] "Subbotina et al. also demonstrated that the CH bond of ethane is more strongly polarized on Mg2 + and Ca2 + forms of Y zeolite than on Na+ forms."
          [36] "Mg2 +-Y zeolite molecules exhibit weaker adsorption and polarization of ethane than Ca2 +-zeolites."
          [37] "Based on charge density considerations, Mg2 + cations are expected to exhibit a stronger polarizing effect than Ca2 + cations."
          [38] "Subbotina et al. explain that because of the smaller ionic radius of Mg2 +, it is more strongly shielded by the surrounding oxygen atoms of the zeolite lattice than a Ca2 + ion, thereby reducing the polarizing effect of Mg2 + on the hydrocarbon adsorbate."
          [39] "Sievers et al. also report that the La3 + form of X zeolite induces strong polarization of adsorbed alkane molecules; partial positive charges were induced on secondary and tertiary carbon atoms of alkane molecules."
          [40] "The authors suggest that the polarization may be viewed as an intermediate condition to hydride abstraction (which is an important elementary step in CH activation)."
          [41] "They add that CH bond polarization was enhanced by physisorbed water molecules that coordinate with La3 + cations."
          [42] "The enhanced polarization of CH bonds by the presence of water molecules on La3 +X zeolite may have a beneficial effect in oxidative dehydrogenation where water is a by-product."
          [43] "Alkane polarization studies on Na+, Mg2 +, Ca2 +, and La3 + exchanged X-zeolites indicate that the polarizing effect increases with increasing charge magnitude and ionic radius."
          [44] "Note that these alkane polarizing cations occupy the same position on the zeolites as the well-known CH activation cations/metals, and thus the CH polarizing effect has a complementary effect on CH activation."
          [45] "This may add to the number of relevant variables and increase the challenge of optimizing the ratio of activation/polarizing cations among exchangeable sites (Si/Al ratio), as well as the sequence for incorporating the cations or metals during catalyst preparation."
          [46] "Further, it is important to note that the choice of cations should be such that they exhibit no catalytic (oligomerization, isomerization, aromatisation or oxidation) effects on the target alkene products at the reaction condition."
          [47] "Furthermore, it may be beneficial to create a CH polarization effect on the zeolite framework."
          [48] "This can be achieved by appropriate chance of framework atoms."
          [49] "Since active sites are usually created on the zeolite frameworks."
          [50] "The activation of CH bonds of light alkanes occurs readily on super electrophiles (super Brnsted and super Lewis acid) at low temperatures."
          [51] "Although CH activation on zeolites have been observed at low temperatures, industrial alkane reactions on zeolites are usually carried out at high temperatures."
          [52] "Several experimental and theoretical studies on the molecular dynamics of light alkanes on zeolite have been published."
          [53] "However, despite the decades of intensive investigations on the subject, the actual mechanism of CH activation on acid zeolite is still debated."
          [54] "Two CH activation paths are generally recognized: the unimolecular/protolytic mechanism and the bimolecular/carbenium chain mechanism."
          [55] "The unimolecular mechanism involves direct protonation of an alkane-forming carbonium ion intermediate."
          [56] "The proton can be inserted into either a CC or CH bond of the alkane."
          [57] "Proton insertion through the CC bond leads to cracking of the alkane, with the acid site regenerated."
          [58] "Insertion through the HC bond yields H2 and a carbenium ion/alkoxide intermediate."
          [59] "Desorption of alkene from the intermediate regenerates the acid, or the alkoxide can enter the bimolecular conversion path."
          [60] "In the bimolecular mechanism of CH activation, the alkoxide intermediate constitutes the active sites and CH activation occurs through hydride transfer from a second alkane molecule forming another alkoxide."
          [61] "This may be followed by βscission to regenerate the active site and complete the catalytic cycle."
          [62] "For example, activation of propane on acid zeolite based on the two mechanisms is illustrated in Scheme 1."
          [63] "Low reactant partial pressure and high temperature favor unimolecular dehydrogenation of alkane on acid zeolite."
          [64] "These conditions favor the endothermic desorption step (rate limiting step) leading to propene."
          [65] "In contrast, high partial pressure and low temperature favor the bimolecular mechanism leading to a low propene yield."
          [66] "The two molecular mechanisms devoid of side reactions give fairly predictable product distribution."
          [67] "However, the products of each route are prone to side reactions (dimerization, oligomerization, isomerization & aromatisation) in the presence of Bronsted acid sites."
          [68] "Hence propene selectivity on acidic zeolite is very low and products rich in aromatics are usually obtained."
          [69] "The active sites (alkoxide intermediate) of the bimolecular pathway are formed in situ."
          [70] "The alkoxide intermediate is made up of an alkyl carbenium ion ionically held to the zeolite framework oxygen ion."
          [71] "The active sites of the unimolecular pathway are the charge balancing protons of the zeolite framework."
          [72] "A proton and a carbenium ion are an electrophilic or Lewis acid species (a proton can also be considered as a special case of Lewis acidity)."
          [73] "The two pathways essentially involve electrophilic CH activation."
          [74] "The electrophiles (proton and carbenium ion) activate CH at high temperatures (500 C), giving low conversion rates of light alkanes and poor selectivity to corresponding alkenes."
          [75] "Iglesia and co-workers used isotopic labeling studies to demonstrate that CH activation is not the rate-limiting step in the dehydrogenation of propane on H-ZSM-5 and Ga/H-ZSM-5."
          [76] "They proposed that the CH bond cleavage produces an H-adatom and an alkoxide intermediate."
          [77] "Desorption of an alkene from the alkoxide regenerates the proton sites on the zeolites."
          [78] "An alkoxide intermediate may also discharge as a hydrogen rich species through cracking."
          [79] "Iglesia et al. proposed that desorption or disposal of the H-adatom from the CH bond cleavage is the rate-limiting step."
          [80] "A similar deduction was reached by Yu et al."
          [81] "who found that desorption of the alkoxides intermediate is the rate-limiting step under conditions that favor the unimolecular mechanism."
          [82] "The above proposition has been demonstrated on metal (e.g., Ga, Zn, and Co) exchanged zeolites."
          [83] "The specific role of the exchanged metals has been the subject of several reports with special attention on Ga and Zn."
          [84] "Although the framework Ga2O3 on H-MFI seems to have a CH polarization effect on desorbed methane, Ga2O3 exhibits lower CH activation activity."
          [85] "The physical mixture of Ga2O3/HMFI displays higher propane aromatisation activity than pure H-MFI."
          [86] "Similar synergistic effects have been reported for Zn/H-MFI and Co/H-MFI."
          [87] "Exchanged cations behave as monomeric species at the exchange sites of zeolite."
          [88] "Iglesia and Biscardi hypothesized that the monomeric species enhance propane conversion by promoting re-combinative desorption (RD) of the H-adatom formed from the CH cleavage."
          [89] "It is worthwhile noting that the exchange cations (electrophilic species) constitute the CH activation sites."
          [90] "Hence, more insights are required about their additional role in promoting RD."
          [91] "However, the authors did not provide further information on the nature of the H-adatoms and the mechanism of RD."
          [92] "In the next section, we examine the mechanism of desorption of H-adatoms over Ga and Zn exchanged H-ZSM-5."
          [93] "The exchanged metal ions in zeolites are held ionically by one or more basic oxygen atoms."
          [94] "Different species have been suggested, depending on the density of the cation exchange site of the zeolite and method of introduction of the metals."
          [95] "According to Kanansky et al."
          [96] "the exchanged Zn and Ga species on H-ZSM-5 and their mechanism of CH activation are distinctively different."
          [97] "Zn and Ga are introduced on H-ZSM-5 through a vapor deposition technique using Zn metal vapor and Ga(CH3)3 as the source of Zn and Ga, respectively."
          [98] "The metal introduction technique allows quantitative exchange of the zeolite protons which leads to Zn/Al = 0.5 and Ga/Al = 1, respectively."
          [99] "Zn2 + is generated directly, but Ga+ is produced by H2 treatment at 500 C to release the methyl groups."
          [100] "The proposed active sites are OZn2+O and OGa+, respectively."
          [101] "The mechanism of CH activation with ethane by the two sites under the same reaction conditions are summarized in Scheme 2."
          [102] "The proposed mechanism is in agreement with the mechanism suggested from calculations using the GAUSSIAN 94 program for ethane activation on Zn-exchanged zeolite by Frash and van Santen."
          [103] "In another theoretical study using a DFT cluster modeling approach, Pidko and van Santen compared the activation energy of CH with three types of Zn species at active sites: OZn2+O, OZn+OZn+O and HOZn+ O."
          [104] "The authors suggest that the reaction proceeds most easily on OZn2+O, and hypothesize that the enhanced Lewis activity of OZn2+O facilitates CH heterolytic cleavage."
          [105] "They further argue that the first proton abstraction occurs preferentially on the oxygen sites neighboring the ring where the cation is located."
          [106] "They proposed a one-step reaction to yield H2 and C2H4 from the decomposition of the Zn-alkyl and proton."
          [107] "A proposed mechanism of CH activation on OGa+ has similarly been suggested using theoretical calculations."
          [108] "High alkene selectivities are obtained on the H-ZSM-5 when exchangeable protons are rigorously replaced by Zn and Ga."
          [109] "The Zn-exchanged H-ZSM-5 had higher ethane conversion rates but lower ethene selectivity than its Ga counterpart."
          [110] "The CH activation on the OZn2+O site can be described by a Lewis base-assisted deprotonation mechanism."
          [111] "This is accompanied by conversion of the Lewis base site to a conjugate Bronsted acid site."
          [112] "The OGa+ site, however, activates the CH bond via oxidative addition without a protonic site intermediate."
          [113] "A protonic site intermediate increases tendency of side reactions on the Zn-exchanged H-ZSM-5 relative to the Ga counterpart."
          [114] "The elementary steps of CH activation on OGa+ (Scheme 2) reveal that a redox cycle at the metal center is required for catalytic CH activation via the oxidative addition mechanism."
          [115] "A redox cycle is not apparent in the elementary step presented for CH activation on OZn2+O."
          [116] "Hence, a redox cycle is not a requisite for CH activation via the Lewis base-assisted deprotonation mechanism."
          [117] "However, under alkane dehydrogenation reaction conditions, the OZn2+O sites can undergo a reversible Zn2 +/Zn redox process."
          [118] "This redox process increases the availability of undesired protonic site intermediates."
          [119] "Zn-exchanged H-ZSM-5 prepared by conventional ion-exchange methods contain a significant percentage of unexchanged proton sites leading to lower alkene selectivity of the catalyst."
          [120] "Iglesia and Biscardi titrate the proton sites with NaOH."
          [121] "The un-titrated and the titrated catalysts are denoted as Zn/H-ZSMS-5 and Zn/Na-ZSMS-5, respectively."
          [122] "Zn/Na-ZSM-5 has four times the propane conversion rate and a higher propene selectivity than Zn/H-ZSMS-5."
          [123] "The propene formation rate obtained with Zn/Na-ZSM-5 was ten times that of Zn/H-ZSMS-5."
          [124] "The zinc species at the cation exchange site of the zeolite was identified as OZn+OH."
          [125] "The higher propene selectivity obtained on Zn/Na-ZSM-5 compared to Zn/H-ZSMS-5 is presumably from the lower density and availability of proton sites on Zn/Na-ZSM-5."
          [126] "The improved propane conversion rate of Zn/Na-ZSM-5 compared to Zn/H-ZSM-5 is attributable to the higher efficiency of OZn+OH sites in catalyzing desorption of H-adatoms than OZn2+O sites."
          [127] "Another strategy to enhance alkene selectivity is by controlling the strength of the proton sites."
          [128] "The acidity of the sites depends on the nature of the trivalent cation of the zeolite framework."
          [129] "Proton sites in borosilicate zeolites are weaker than those of aluminosilicate, and thus higher alkene selectivity is expected for alkane dehydrogenation over Zn/H[B]-ZSM-5 compared to Zn/H[Al]-ZSM-5."
          [130] "However, Zn/H[B]-ZSM-5 shows no activity for propane dehydrogenation."
          [131] "The desired weaker acidity of the proton sites of Zn/H[B]-ZSM-5 requires weaker basicity of the oxygen atoms in the zeolite framework."
          [132] "This reduced basicity of the oxygen atoms is not sufficiently polarizing to complement the exchanged Zn2 + in CH bond cleavage."
          [133] "In the next section, we examine use of zeolite support to design a Pt-based alkane dehydrogenation catalyst."
          [134] "Elimination of the proton sites of zeolites is critical for obtaining a high alkene selectivity and stability in dehydrogenation catalysts."
          [135] "Pt is the most versatile noble metal catalyst for alkane reactions."
          [136] "Although Pt is expensive, the choice of Pt is often justified by its higher activity, stability and selectivity for these reactions compared to less expensive alternative transition metals."
          [137] "However, rapid catalyst deactivation due to coke formation remains a challenge even when using a Pt-based catalyst for dehydrogenation of light alkanes."
          [138] "Waku et al."
          [139] "exploited the unique property of zeolite as a support for achieving high metal dispersion through cation exchange sites to create a Pt/Na[Fe]-ZSM-5 catalyst with outstanding stability for dehydrogenation of light alkanes."
          [140] "They found that the catalyst deactivation rate of Pt/Na[Fe]-ZSM-5 was lower than for any other Pt-based catalysts in refractory oxide support."
          [141] "The unprecedented performance of Pt/Na[Fe]-ZSM-5 was attributed to its high Pt dispersion (cluster size < 1 mm) on zeolite through ion-exchange."
          [142] "There is a tendency to generate some Brnsted protons on the zeolite during the exchange process, but the choice of Fe3 + as an isomorphous cation in place of Al3 + led to weaker Brnsted sites in [Fe]-ZSM compared to [Al]-ZSM."
          [143] "The weaker acidity minimizes the tendency of side reactions (cracking of oligomerization, aromatisation, and coke), which translates into higher alkene selectivity and catalyst stability."
          [144] "In another report, Xuebing and Iglesia demonstrated the ability of Pt/Na[Fe]-ZSM-5 to dehydrogenate alkanes longer than C4; n-pentane and n-heptane were selectively converted to n-pentene and n-heptene, respectively."
          [145] "Alkene selectivity was also improved when the residual proton generated during Pt exchange or Na-[Fe]-ZSM was titrated with Cs."
          [146] "Although Pt with conventional refractory oxides (Al2O3, SiO2, ZrO2, etc.) used for dehydrogenation of alkanes has similar conversion rates to Pt/Na[Fe]-ZSM-5, deactivation rates are also rapid due to coke formation."
          [147] "The presence of acid (Bronsted and Lewis) sites on the supports promotes readsorption, oligomerization and aromatisation of alkenes."
          [148] "Promotion of Pt with metals, such as Sn, Ga, Zn, Re, etc., improves catalyst stability, but also leads to faster deactivation rates than Pt/Na[Fe]-ZSM-5."
          [149] "However, recent reports by Bell et al."
          [150] "show that the use of calcined hydrotalcite (Al/Mg  0.1) supported on bimetallic PtGa or PtSn gave very high alkene selectivity and stability, comparable to Pt/Na[Fe]-ZSM-5."
          [151] "At this stage, we can conclude that differences in the performance of Zn and Ga exchanged H-ZSM-5 obtained by Kanansky et al."
          [152] "are attributable to their respective CH activation mechanisms."
          [153] "In addition, the role of exchanged Zn and Ga as promoters of RD becomes evident from the mechanisms (Scheme 2)."
          [154] "The RD mechanism on Ga exchanged H-ZSM-5 is by reductive elimination of a hydrogen molecule from O[Ga(H)2]+ intermediate."
          [155] "Decomposition of ZnR and a protonic site, or neutralization of the proton sites by ZnH, leads to desorption of the hydrogen molecule on the Zn-exchanged H-ZSM-5."
          [156] "By extrapolation, the mechanisms of CH activation on exchanged Zn and Ga H-ZSM-5 can described the mechanism of alkane dehydrogenation on Cr-based and Pt-based catalysts respectively."
          [157] "The electronic promotion effect of Sn is in line with the oxidative addition CH activation mechanism."
          [158] "However, the Lewis base-assisted deprotonation mechanism could also explain the proposed CH activation on Cr-based catalysts."
          [159] "Now, the nature and the role of surface oxygen species become more evident."
          [160] "The role of potassium in commercial Cr and Pt-based dehydrogenation catalysts is to minimize the undesired influence of protonic sites on alkene selectivity."
          [161] "The highlights in this section are presented in Table 2."
          [162] "The table reveals the insights achieved on the reaction mechanism, alkene selectivity and catalyst stability for non-oxidative dehydrogenation of lower alkanes."
          [163] "Nonetheless, the level of catalyst activity is still far from acceptable, even at high temperature."
          [164] "A recent report by Rothenberg et al."
          [165] "provides a lead in this respect."
          [166] "Their report indicates that a porous copperaluminum framework material (stabilized by metal oxide) has better performance (activity/selectivity/stability) for propane dehydrogenation than a PtSn/Al2O3."
          [167] "Of particular interest, is the suggestion that achieving propane dehydrogenation at 350 C may be possible."
          [168] "Few details are known about the structure of the porous copperaluminum framework material."
          [169] "However, copper is implicated as providing the active sites for the catalysis."
          [170] "Also, that the material activated in oxygen gave higher propane conversion rates than those activated in inert gas atmosphere underscores the role of the surface oxide (oxygen species) in the catalysis."
          [171] "Thus, the Lewis base-assisted deprotonation mechanism may be invoked here, and the redox property of the metal center is likely to play a role in achieving propane dehydrogenation at 350 C."
          [172] "This should constitute the future research direction for non-oxidative dehydrogenation of lower alkanes."
          [173] "Although the equilibrium conversion of alkanes increases with temperature, alkene selectivity decreases with increasing temperature and chain length due to an increased tendency toward dehydrocyclization/aromatisation, thermal cracking and coke formation."
          [174] "Direct dehydrogenation of lower alkanes is an energy intensive reaction; however, oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) has the potential to lower the energy requirement for achieving dehydrogenation."
          [175] "ODH can be considered as tandem endothermic (dehydrogenation, CnH2n + 2  CnH2n + H2) and exothermic (oxidation, H2 + O2  H2O) processes, with an overall thermodynamic summation, CnH2n + 2 + O2  CnH2n + H2O."
          [176] "Although the process is not thermo-neutral, part of the energy required for the endothermic reaction is augmented by the exothermic reaction."
          [177] "Thus, ODH of alkanes takes place at lower temperature compared to the corresponding non-ODH."
          [178] "This lower temperature requirement of ODH compared to non-ODH and cracking is encouraging and provides motivation for continued efforts to develop ODH into an industrial technology."
          [179] "Although ODH is attractive because of the energy intensification advantage, commercial ODH technologies hinge on innovative catalyst and process design, i.e. proper synergy of the endothermic dehydrogenation step with the exothermic hydrogen combustion and design of selective CH and hydrogen combustion catalysts."
          [180] "In this report, we provide an overview on CH activation and reaction routes to alkane dehydrogenation."
          [181] "We seek to gain insights about components of the active sites of CH activation to provide a platform for rational design of new efficient catalysts for dehydrogenation of lower alkanes."

[1] "Although there are other metallic reforming catalysts such as Ru and Rh, which are less strongly prone to coking than Ni,129 Ni is one of the most common reforming catalysts, which is partly due to its significantly cheaper price. In order to overcome the coking problem of Ni catalysts, numerous theoretical studies have been conducted to understand the coke formation on nickel and to come up with potential strategies to avoid the unwanted coking process."
          [2] "It could be shown that the adsorption of C atoms on the closed packed surface of a NiAu surface alloy is thermodynamically less favoured, by 23 kJ mol1 or more, than the analogous process on a pure Ni(111) surface.134 Based on this finding, it has been proposed to alloy Ni with Au.134 A cheaper alternative is to alloy Ni with Sn which hinders the CC bond formation and enhances the CO bond formation leading to the removal of surface C centers as carbon monoxide.135,136 It has been discussed that the Sn atoms separate the Ni centers on the catalyst surface, which tend to bind C atoms, from each other. With the Ni centers being separated, the C atoms on the surface are separated as well, which hinders the formation of coke.135,136 These theoretical results are consistent with experiments which show that pure Ni catalysts deactivate significantly faster than NiSn alloy based catalysts.135 Since the step sites play an essential role in the growth of the graphene islands, as mentioned above, additives such as potassium,66 sulfur,66 gold66 or boron131 have been proposed.66 Computational calculations have shown that these elements tend to occupy the step sites and thus avoid the formation of graphene islands.66,131 A similar strategy, by blocking the crucial sites, has been proposed to prevent the formation of a carbidic phase. Calculations have shown that boron prefers the same sub-surface sites on Ni as C.137 By occupying these sites with B, the diffusion of C to these sub-surface sites and the formation of the thermodynamically more stable carbide phase can be prevented.128 Apart from blocking the sub-surface sites, sub-surface boron in Ni(111) also has been shown to have an destabilizing effect on on-surface C centers,138 which may help to prevent the accumulation of C atoms on the surface."
          [3] "Although supported Pt catalysts show high activity, the catalyst deactivation due to coke formation remains a challenging issue."
          [4] "The robustness against coking can be increased with additional promoters, such as late transition metals, main-group metals including Sn and Ga, alkali-metal oxides and rare-earth metal oxides."
          [5] "It has been demonstrated for graphene islands on the Ni(111) surface, unsaturated C atoms at the edge of a graphene island are less stable than isolated C atoms on the metal surface."
          [6] "A cheaper alternative is to alloy Ni with Sn which hinders the CC bond formation and enhances the CO bond formation leading to the removal of surface C centers as carbon monoxide."
          [7] "Since the step sites play an essential role in the growth of the graphene islands, as mentioned above, additives such as potassium, sulfur, gold or boron have been proposed."
          [8] "Apart from blocking the sub-surface sites, sub-surface boron in Ni(111) also has been shown to have an destabilizing effect on on-surface C centers, which may help to prevent the accumulation of C atoms on the surface."

[1] "A catalyst design consisting of the double-decoration of nanoparticulate intermetallic PtGa with Pb and Ca was applied to produce an ultra-stable catalyst for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) at a high temperature."
          [2] "PtGaCaPb/SiO2 exhibited outstanding catalytic stability in PDH at 600C, and almost no deactivation was observed for up to 1month."
          [3] "Herein, we report a novel catalyst design concept, namely, the double decoration of PtGa intermetallics by Pb and Ca, which synergize the geometric and electronic promotion effects on the catalyst stability, respectively."
          [4] "Pb is deposited on the three-fold Pt3 sites of the PtGa nanoparticles to block them, whereas Ca, which affords an electron-enriched single-atom-like Pt1 site, is placed around the nanoparticles."
          [5] "Thus, PtGaCaPb/SiO2 exhibits an outstandingly high catalytic stability, even at 600C (kd=0.00033h1, τ=3067h), and almost no deactivation of the catalyst was observed for up to 1month for the first time."

[1] "To expose the loaded Pt on the surface of the carriers, ion exchange and impregnation are two simple and practical methods. The dispersion of Pt mainly depends on the precursors of Pt, the preparation conditions, the properties of the carriers, and the interaction between Pt and the carriers, as well as the additives."
          [2] "The addition of a second metal has been found to be highly effective for the sintering resistance of Pt particles. The introduced metal forms alloys with Pt around Pt particles,63 and the alloys anchor them on the surface of the carriers, making them not easy to migrate and coalesce."
          [3] "The application of the carriers possessing a strong interaction with Pt is another way to retard the sintering. Al2O3 is the most common carrier of Pt catalyst, in which the coordinatively unsaturated pentacoordinate Al3+ can anchor Pt to make it not easy to migrate."
          [4] "Nanocarbon was also reported as the carrier of Pt to improve the sintering resistance, and the strong metalcarrier interaction leads to the electron transfer from nanocarbon to the Pt particles, significantly preventing the sintering of Pt."
          [5] "MgAl2O4 spinel is also a good choice as the carrier. Generally, Pt is not directly loaded on MgAl2O4 spinel prepared beforehand, but firstly loaded into the spaces between the layers of MgAlOx hydrotalcite, and then Pt particles are enclosed in the interspace of MgAl2O4 spinel formed through the collapse of the layered structure of the hydrotalcite after calcination at high temperature."
          [6] "Moliner et al.67 reported effective methods to encapsulate Pt in highly siliceous chabazite, and the catalyst showed enhanced stability towards Pt sintering even at 650750 C in the atmospheres of H2, O2 and H2O."
          [7] "The Al2O3 overcoat has also proved to be efficient in preventing the sintering of Pt nanoparticles through atomic layer deposition."
          [8] "Tanabe et al. revealed that no Pt sintering was observed for Pt/MgO as an automotive exhaust catalyst after calcination in air at 900 C, for the formation of a Mg2PtO4-like compound prevents the migration of Pt."
          [9] "Nagai et al. found that CeO2 had a similar effect of MgO in preventing the sintering of Pt due to the formation of the PtOCe bond in the Pt/CeO2 catalyst."
          [10] "Recently, Pt supported on CeO2 has attracted more attention because of the ability of CeO2 to trap Pt in an atomically dispersed state."
          [11] "The atomically dispersed Pt is most likely to be present in the form of Pt2+ bonded to the ubiquitous step edges of the CeO2 surface."
          [12] "The addition of Ga, In, Zn, Cu, Ir, Co to Pt catalysts exhibits similar effects as Sn."
          [13] "Not only that, but Sattler et al.84 showed that in the highly active, selective and stable PtGaK/Al2O3 (0.1 wt% Pt, 3 wt% Ga, 0.25 wt% K) catalyst for the dehydrogenation of propane, the coordinately unsaturated Ga3+ is responsible for activating the CH bond, and Pt only acts as a promoter."
          [14] "Furthermore, just like the PtSn/CeO2 catalyst,29 the reactivity can be fully recovered via simple coke burning in air, although the sintering of Pt still occurs."
          [15] "Located at the same main group with Ga, In was also reported to be the promoter of supported Pt catalysts. The PtIn/Mg(Al)O catalyst prepared at pH 8 using the co-precipitation method exhibits the best catalytic performance and the strongest interaction between the metal phase and the carrier."
          [16] "B and Si, two nonmetal elements, can play similar roles, too. Dehydrogenation of n-butane over the PtB/SiO2 catalyst showed improved catalytic activity and stability compared with Pt/SiO2."
          [17] "Dadras et al.86 called B a magic bullet against sintering and coking, and they summarized the positive roles of B as follows. The non-stoichiometric PtB cluster is anchored to the carrier via a covalent BO bond, which is much stronger than the interaction between Pt clusters and the carrier surface."
          [18] "Additionally, the dissociation energy of a Pt atom from a PtB cluster is significantly larger than that from the pure Pt cluster, increasing the sintering resistance."
          [19] "Finally, the affinity of PtB cluster to C also drops dramatically, leading to the reduced coke formation and increased selectivity to olefins."
          [20] "It is predicted by a computational screening of main-group elements as potential additives for the Pt catalyst that Si, just as B, can modify the selectivity of the Pt catalyst by changing both electronic and geometric properties."

[1] "In this review, we outline the progress of these dehydrogenation catalysts that have been mainly developed in the past five years. For different classes of the most-promising catalysts in the selective dehydrogenation of ethane-to-ethylene and propane-to-propylene, their syntheses, structural information, catalytic properties and mechanisms are comparatively summarized."

[1] "To improve the stability of Pt-based catalysts, many efforts have been dedicated to strengthen metalsupport interactions by using various methods including the nanopore-encaged metal strategy,2124 wet-chemistry approach2529 and modification of supports.10,11,30,31 Among them, modification of supports is a relatively effective and simple method to improve the stability of Pt-based catalysts."
          [2] "For example, Lu et al. reported a PtSn/Al2O3 sheet catalyst for PDH, exhibiting high activity, selectivity and stability.11 It was proposed that the enhanced stability in PDH was associated with γ-Al2O3 nanosheets containing a great deal of pentacoordinate Al3+ ions, which can stabilize PtSn clusters by strong interactions between metals and supports."
          [3] "Recent work by Ma et al. showed that the addition of Ga into Mg(Al)O layer double hydrotalcites could greatly enhance the stability of Pt catalysts in PDH.10 It may be due to the fact that pentacoordinate Ga3+ ions could disperse and stabilize PtSn clusters, thereby enhancing the electronic interactions between Pt and Ga."
          [4] "A similar conclusion regarding the importance of modification of supports has been reported in the case of PtSn/CeO2 catalysts.30"
          [5] "Therefore, this provides a way to tune and enhance the catalytic activity and selectivity for the PDH process, and also introduces unique stability characteristics for bimetallic systems."
          [6] "Herein, highly stable Pt/Sn-Si-beta catalysts for PDH were prepared by an improved post-synthesis strategy, which consists of dealumination of H-beta and subsequent metal impregnation."
          [7] "It is indicated that Sn species existing in tetrahedral coordination states were incorporated into the framework of dealuminated beta (Si-beta)."
          [8] "Meanwhile, Pt species were highly dispersed in the form of ultra-small nanoclusters on Pt/Sn-Si-beta due to the strong interaction between Pt and Sn(IV) sites confined in the Si-beta framework."
          [9] "The prepared Pt/Sn-Si-beta catalysts show excellent catalytic performance for PDH, in which the propene formation rate was 2.3 mol g1Pt h1 with a propene selectivity of >99% at 550 C and the higher propene formation rate was 3.1 mol g1Pt h1 at 600 C."
          [10] "Moreover, the strong PtSn interactions and the confinement effect of Sn in the Si-beta framework inhibit the coke and sintering of Pt clusters, thereby achieving good stability of dehydrogenation and regeneration with almost unchanged catalytic activity during four cycles at 550 C."

          [16] "The introduction of an appropriate metal oxide or noble metal into a catalytic system can greatly enhance the catalytic performance."



[1] "Extensive research efforts have been made to inhibit deactivation and improve propene selectivity of Pt-based catalysts by doping promoters of Sn [9,10], In [11,12], Ga [13,14] and Cu [15] to form bimetallic catalysts."
          [2] "For example, PtIn [16] and PtGa [17,18] bimetallic nanoparticles (NPs) supported on calcined hydrotalcites (HT) show higher activity and selectivity in PDH, which has been attributed to the increased Pt dispersion and electron transfer from In or Ga to Pt [11,18]."
          [3] "Besides promoters, another method is to modify Al2O3 support with ZnO [19], La2O3 [20] or TiO2 [21] or replace Al2O3 support with ZnAl2O4 [22], ZSM-5 [23] or Mg(Al)O oxide [8,24]."
          [4] "Additionally, it has been verified that the single Pt atom sites on Pt-Sn/γ-Al2O3 with a sandwich structure are more favorable for PDH reaction than Pt ensembles [25,26]."

          [10] "Given that the small Pt NPs and hierarchical microstructure may provide more stable and easily accessible active sites for PDH reaction, a promising design for obtaining the desired size of active Pt and hierarchical pore morphology was proposed."
          [11] "The promoted effects of HT reconstruction on the microstructure and morphology of the 3D oxide nanosheet array catalyst, and the subsequently superior PDH performance, were profoundly discussed."

Stable and selective catalysts for propane dehydrogenation operating at thermodynamic limit Hitting the limits on propene synthesis The greater abundance of propane from shale gas has spurred efforts to use it as a propylene feedstock. Direct dehydrogenation catalysts consisting of platinumtin alloy nanoparticles supported on alumina often must run with hydrogen dilution to avoid carbon buildup and excess tin to avoid alloy segregation.
          We report that silica-supported platinum-tin (Pt1Sn1) nanoparticles (&lt;2 nanometers in diameter) can operate as a PDH catalyst at thermodynamically limited conversion levels, with excellent stability and selectivity to propylene (&gt;99%). Atomic mixing of Pt and Sn in the precursor is preserved upon reduction and during catalytic operation. The benign interaction of these nanoparticles with the silicon dioxide support does not lead to Pt-Sn segregation and formation of a tin oxide phase that can occur over traditional catalyst supports.
          To alleviate this issue, large quantities of Sn are used in the catalyst preparation (the nominal atomic loading is Sn:Pt between 4 and 5), which increases the yield of intermetallic PtSn NPs (12). In addition, studies have shown that adding hydrogen to the reactant feed reduces the rate of catalyst deactivation (13). Although this strategy is implemented commercially (10), addition of hydrogen in the feed lowers the thermodynamic limit on per-pass propane conversion (fig. S1) and decreases productivity (7).
          We developed a PDH catalyst that operates at thermodynamically limited conversion levels without the addition of hydrogen to the feed and exhibits excellent stability and selectivity to propylene (&gt;99%). The catalyst is composed of silica-supported Pt1Sn1 NPs, synthesized and pretreated to ensure that the mixing of Pt and Sn is preserved during catalytic operation.
          The principle behind catalyst synthesis is to begin with a heterometallic Pt-Sn coordination complex in which Pt and Sn are in immediate contact, and this interaction is retained during the reduction and PDH reaction.
          The data in Fig. 1, A to C, were obtained with 16 vol % propane in helium. Propane streams are diluted in commercial operations to increase the limiting equilibrium conversion, which is higher at lower propane partial pressure (fig. S2), and to limit catalyst deactivation rates (7, 16, 17). This approach requires additional downstream separation units and limits process efficiency.
          The data in Fig. 1, A to C, show the performance of the Pt1Sn1/SiO2 catalyst (1 wt % Pt and 0.6 wt % Sn) for propane dehydrogenation at 580C, 16 vol % propane (with the remainder helium) and at a weight hourly space velocity (WHSV) of 4.7 hours1. Under these reaction conditions, the thermodynamic limit on propane conversion is 66.5% (fig. S2). The Pt1Sn1/SiO2 catalyst showed near-thermodynamic conversion of &gt;66% (Fig. 1A, red circles) and &gt;99% selectivity to propylene (Fig. 1B, red circles).
          The data in Fig. 1D show that, under these conditions, the propane conversion goes from 41 to 39% in 120 min. Under identical conditions, the other tested catalysts deactivate very rapidly to very low conversion, as illustrated for the commercial mimic. A transmission electron microscopy (TEM) image of the spent catalyst, after 120 min of PDH reaction, is shown in fig. S6. The image shows that the Pt-Sn NPs are well dispersed, with an average particle diameter of 1.6  0.67 nm, which is consistent with the particle size in fresh samples.
          We attempted to regenerate the Pt1Sn1/SiO2 catalyst by oxidation, using 1% O2 as a mild oxidant at 500C followed by reduction at 600C (see supplementary materials for details of the regeneration procedure). The regeneration studies showed that Pt1Sn1/SiO2 catalysts can be partially regenerated. For example, we measured 97% of the initial activity and &gt;99% of the initial selectivity after three PDH/regeneration cycles (fig. S5).
          Data in Fig. 3A show that the process of mixing chloroplatinic acid (H2PtCl6) and tin(II) chloride (SnCl2) in 0.1 M hydrochloric acid solution formed a heterometallic Pt-Sn coordination complex.
          A bright-field TEM image of Pt-Sn NPs formed on SiO2 upon the reduction of the Pt-Sn complex shows high metal dispersion on the support, with an average NP size of 1.3  0.6 nm (Fig. 3B). The NP size distribution (Fig. 3C) shows that most NPs were &lt;2 nm. The XRD spectra in Fig. 3D show that the formed NPs were essentially alloys of Pt and Sn. This finding is supported by the presence of the XRD peaks corresponding to Pt1Sn1 (41.8 and 44.1) and Pt3Sn1 (39.0 and 45.3) stoichiometries.
          The real-space Pt LIII EXAFS spectra for the Pt1Sn1/SiO2 catalyst (Fig. 4D) are substantially different from the spectra of monometallic Pt and indicate the mixing of Pt and Sn atoms. The best-fit spectrum for the Pt1Sn1/SiO2 catalyst is characterized by the presence of the Pt-Pt and Pt-Sn scattering paths, consistent with the formation of PtSn intermetallic phases.

          [2] "Herein, a series of highly ordered mesoporous Al2O3 supports with different levels of Al3+penta sites, are fabricated and used as the support to disperse Pt-Sn2 clusters."
          [3] "The stability and regenerability of Pt-Sn2/meso-Al2O3 are strongly dependent on the content of Al3+penta sites in the Al2O3 structure, and a high level of Al3+penta sites can effectively prevent the agglomeration of Pt-Sn2 clusters into large Pt nanoparticles in the consecutive dehydrogenation-regeneration cycles."



[1] "Rare-earthplatinum alloy nanoparticles in mesoporous zeolite for catalysis Platinum is a much used catalyst that, in petrochemical processes, is often alloyed with other metals to improve catalytic activity, selectivity and longevity1,2,3,4,5."
          [2] "Such catalysts are usually prepared in the form of metallic nanoparticles supported on porous solids, and their production involves reducing metal precursor compounds under a H2 flow at high temperatures6."
          [3] "The method works well when using easily reducible late transition metals, but Pt alloy formation with rare-earth elements through the H2 reduction route is almost impossible owing to the low chemical potential of rare-earth element oxides6."
          [4] "Here we use as support a mesoporous zeolite that has pore walls with surface framework defects (called silanol nests) and show that the zeolite enables alloy formation between Pt and rare-earth elements."
          [5] "We find that the silanol nests enable the rare-earth elements to exist as single atomic species with a substantially higher chemical potential compared with that of the bulk oxide, making it possible for them to diffuse onto Pt."
          [6] "High-resolution transmission electron microscopy and hydrogen chemisorption measurements indicate that the resultant bimetallic nanoparticles supported on the mesoporous zeolite are intermetallic compounds, which we find to be stable, highly active and selective catalysts for the propane dehydrogenation reaction."
          [7] "When used with late transition metals, the same preparation strategy produces Pt alloy catalysts that incorporate an unusually large amount of the second metal and, in the case of the PtCo alloy, show high catalytic activity and selectivity in the preferential oxidation of carbon monoxide in H2."
          [8] "The industrial PDH process has been using PtSn bimetallic catalysts supported on porous alumina for nearly three decades, since its discovery in the early 1990s3,7."
          [9] "The Pt metal alone exhibits high initial catalytic activity, but rapidly deactivates as a result of coke deposition on the Pt surface."
          [10] "The coke deposition also causes an undesirable loss of the catalytic selectivity to propylene."
          [11] "To alleviate these problems, Sn is introduced to form an alloy with Pt nanoparticles and thereby dilute the Pt surface with inactive Sn atoms and break up coke-generating Pt ensembles."
          [12] "Our search for a highly active and more durable PDH catalyst has focused on using a siliceous MFI zeolite with a hierarchical micro-/mesoporous structure as a replacement for the alumina support."
          [13] "This zeolite, synthesized using a multi-ammonium surfactant as a structure-directing agent, has attracted attention as an advanced catalyst support8,9,10,11,12,13 owing to its unique structure, which comprises ultrathin zeolite frameworks and three-dimensionally interconnected mesopores that boost the catalytic performance of supported metals by providing both facile reactant and product diffusion and high metal nanoparticle dispersion within the mesopores12,13."
          [14] "The formation of the Pt3La and Pt3Y nanoparticles on the degallated zeolite brought a striking enhancement in all aspects of the PDH catalytic performance, including activity, selectivity and durability, as shown in Fig. 2."
          [15] "The catalytic reaction was performed at 580C using a pure propane flow at a large space velocity (see Methods), and these harsh operating conditions caused even the conventional PtSn/alumina catalyst to experience severe coke formation and catalyst deactivation within 1 d."
          [16] "In sharp contrast, the Pt3La intermetallic nanoparticles supported on the degallated zeolite (denoted as PtLa/mz-deGa, where mz stands for mesoporous zeolite) showed a high initial propane conversion of 40% (close to the equilibrium conversion) and underwent extremely slow deactivation, retaining 8% conversion even after 30 days of reaction."
          [17] "The PtREE incorporation in the mesoporous zeolite was conducted by co-impregnation of aqueous solutions of Pt(NH3)4(NO3)2 and either La(NO3)3·6H2O or Y(NO3)3·6H2O, followed by heating under an O2 flow at 350C and subsequently under H2 at 700C (see Methods)."
          [18] "The formation of the Pt3La and Pt3Y nanoparticles on the degallated zeolite brought a striking enhancement in all aspects of the PDH catalytic performance, including activity, selectivity and durability, as shown in Fig. 2."
          [19] "The PtREE/zeolite showed formation of Pt3La and Pt3Y nanoparticles throughout the zeolite support."
          [20] "The PtREE/zeolite sample shown in Fig. 1 was prepared using a degallated zeolite containing a large number of silanol nest sites."
          [21] "The PtREE/zeolite showed a high initial propane conversion of 40% (close to the equilibrium conversion) and underwent extremely slow deactivation, retaining 8% conversion even after 30 days of reaction."
          [22] "The PtREE/zeolite contained a small amount of Ga (Si/Ga = 598) even after the degallation, and that this may participate in the catalytic function17,18."
          [23] "The effect of the remaining Ga was examined from the differences in PDH performance of mz-deGa, La/mz-deGa and Pt/mz-deGa, as shown in Extended Data Fig. 7."
          [24] "The PtREE/zeolite as a support would allow the discovery of not only REE-based alloy catalysts, but also other transition metal-based alloy catalysts with various compositions and structures, opening up new opportunities for catalytic applications."

[1] "Although the equilibrium conversion of alkanes increases with temperature, alkene selectivity decreases with increasing temperature and chain length due to an increased tendency toward dehydrocyclization/aromatisation, thermal cracking and coke formation."
          [2] "Direct dehydrogenation of lower alkanes is an energy intensive reaction; however, oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) has the potential to lower the energy requirement for achieving dehydrogenation."
          [3] "ODH can be considered as tandem endothermic (dehydrogenation, CnH2n + 2  CnH2n + H2) and exothermic (oxidation, H2 + O2  H2O) processes, with an overall thermodynamic summation, CnH2n + 2 + O2  CnH2n + H2O."
          [4] "Although the process is not thermo-neutral, part of the energy required for the endothermic reaction is augmented by the exothermic reaction."
          [5] "Thus, ODH of alkanes takes place at lower temperature compared to the corresponding non-ODH."
          [6] "This lower temperature requirement of ODH compared to non-ODH and cracking is encouraging and provides motivation for continued efforts to develop ODH into an industrial technology."
          [7] "Although ODH is attractive because of the energy intensification advantage, commercial ODH technologies hinge on innovative catalyst and process design, i.e. proper synergy of the endothermic dehydrogenation step with the exothermic hydrogen combustion and design of selective CH and hydrogen combustion catalysts."
          [8] "In this report, we provide an overview on CH activation and reaction routes to alkane dehydrogenation."
          [9] "We seek to gain insights about components of the active sites of CH activation to provide a platform for rational design of new efficient catalysts for dehydrogenation of lower alkanes."
          [10] "We focus on propane dehydrogenation because of the need for alternative and/or complementary technology for propene production to supplement existing technologies."
          [11] "We survey non-oxidative and oxidative dehydrogenation approaches, and examine reaction routes that are intermediate between these two main approaches."
          [12] "Catalyst improvement endeavors can benefit from insights on alkane CH bond activation mechanisms."
          [13] "Developing direct routes to obtain key organic chemicals from lower alkanes would benefit industry."
          [14] "Lower alkanes are relatively inert, and they exhibit little or no reactivity at conditions typical for activating functional group reactions in organic compounds because they lack low-lying vacant orbitals or lone pair electrons."
          [15] "Alkanes are made up non-polar CC and CH bonds. These bonds consist of strongly localised electron pairs that are usually induced to reactivity under severe conditions (e.g., at high temperature or pressure, or with the use of aggressive reagents)."
          [16] "The first and rate-limiting step of alkane dehydrogenation using platinum or chromium oxide-based catalysts involves CH activation."
          [17] "Although a number of efforts have been made to gain insight on the mechanism of the reaction, questions still remain, especially regarding the pathway of the CH activation."
          [18] "It is of fundamental and applied interest to know whether the first CH bond cleavage is homolytic or heterolytic."
          [19] "If it is a heterolytic pathway, it will further be of interest to know whether the first hydrogen from the alkane substrate is abstracted as a proton or as a hydride ion."
          [20] "This knowledge will benefit catalyst improvement efforts."
          [21] "The simple impregnation techniques for preparing supported (especially alumina) metal and oxide catalysts becloud their structural heterogeneity."
          [22] "This structural heterogeneity makes the properties-performance correlation of the catalysts complicated."
          [23] "Microporous zeolites are structurally defined framework materials that may constitute a good starting point for obtaining more precise information on the properties-performance correlation of dehydrogenation catalysts."
          [24] "In the next section, we examine adsorption and non-oxidative dehydrogenation of propane on microporous zeolite-based catalysts."
          [25] "Although several solid acid catalysts are used in alkane conversions, zeolites have the advantage of possessing a well-defined structure, allowing the structure-activity relationship to be easily deduced."
          [26] "Therefore, it is instructive to examine non-oxidative dehydrogenation of light alkanes over zeolite catalysts."
          [27] "A detailed knowledge of the adsorption mechanism of lower alkane molecules on zeolite is of interest in this context, especially for informed tuning of zeolite properties to allow efficient and selective dehydrogenation of alkanes."
          [28] "Light alkanes are adsorbed on zeolites via dispersive interaction."
          [29] "Protons and the exchanged metals ions are typically the active sites in zeolites, while the zeolite framework plays the role of anchor for the active sites and/or dispersion medium for the reactants."
          [30] "The framework of microporous zeolites exerts dispersive forces on the reactant's molecules that depend on the shape, channel and cavity of the framework."
          [31] "In addition, the nature and the density of the active sites influence the framework dispersion forces."
          [32] "Recent reports have shown that the strong electrostatic field between protons or exchanged metal ions and basic oxygen species can enhance and/or induce polarization of bonds in hydrocarbon adsorbates."
          [33] "This agrees with Hashiguchi et al., who found enhanced activation of the CH bond on a homogeneous catalyst."
          [34] "Wender et al. showed that 3040% of heat adsorption in n-alkanes on Na-zeolite is due to polarization of the adsorbates."
          [35] "Subbotina et al. also demonstrated that the CH bond of ethane is more strongly polarized on Mg2 + and Ca2 + forms of Y zeolite than on Na+ forms."
          [36] "Mg2 +-Y zeolite molecules exhibit weaker adsorption and polarization of ethane than Ca2 +-zeolites."
          [37] "Based on charge density considerations, Mg2 + cations are expected to exhibit a stronger polarizing effect than Ca2 + cations."
          [38] "Subbotina et al. explain that because of the smaller ionic radius of Mg2 +, it is more strongly shielded by the surrounding oxygen atoms of the zeolite lattice than a Ca2 + ion, thereby reducing the polarizing effect of Mg2 + on the hydrocarbon adsorbate."
          [39] "Sievers et al. also report that the La3 + form of X zeolite induces strong polarization of adsorbed alkane molecules; partial positive charges were induced on secondary and tertiary carbon atoms of alkane molecules."
          [40] "The authors suggest that the polarization may be viewed as an intermediate condition to hydride abstraction (which is an important elementary step in CH activation)."
          [41] "They add that CH bond polarization was enhanced by physisorbed water molecules that coordinate with La3 + cations."
          [42] "The enhanced polarization of CH bonds by the presence of water molecules on La3 +X zeolite may have a beneficial effect in oxidative dehydrogenation where water is a by-product."
          [43] "Alkane polarization studies on Na+, Mg2 +, Ca2 +, and La3 + exchanged X-zeolites indicate that the polarizing effect increases with increasing charge magnitude and ionic radius."
          [44] "Note that these alkane polarizing cations occupy the same position on the zeolites as the well-known CH activation cations/metals, and thus the CH polarizing effect has a complementary effect on CH activation."
          [45] "This may add to the number of relevant variables and increase the challenge of optimizing the ratio of activation/polarizing cations among exchangeable sites (Si/Al ratio), as well as the sequence for incorporating the cations or metals during catalyst preparation."
          [46] "Further, it is important to note that the choice of cations should be such that they exhibit no catalytic (oligomerization, isomerization, aromatisation or oxidation) effects on the target alkene products at the reaction condition."
          [47] "Furthermore, it may be beneficial to create a CH polarization effect on the zeolite framework."
          [48] "This can be achieved by appropriate chance of framework atoms."
          [49] "Since active sites are usually created on the zeolite frameworks."
          [50] "The activation of CH bonds of light alkanes occurs readily on super electrophiles (super Brnsted and super Lewis acid) at low temperatures."
          [51] "Although CH activation on zeolites have been observed at low temperatures, industrial alkane reactions on zeolites are usually carried out at high temperatures."
          [52] "Several experimental and theoretical studies on the molecular dynamics of light alkanes on zeolite have been published."
          [53] "However, despite the decades of intensive investigations on the subject, the actual mechanism of CH activation on acid zeolite is still debated."
          [54] "Two CH activation paths are generally recognized: the unimolecular/protolytic mechanism and the bimolecular/carbenium chain mechanism."
          [55] "The unimolecular mechanism involves direct protonation of an alkane-forming carbonium ion intermediate."
          [56] "The proton can be inserted into either a CC or CH bond of the alkane."
          [57] "Proton insertion through the CC bond leads to cracking of the alkane, with the acid site regenerated."
          [58] "Insertion through the HC bond yields H2 and a carbenium ion/alkoxide intermediate."
          [59] "Desorption of alkene from the intermediate regenerates the acid, or the alkoxide can enter the bimolecular conversion path."
          [60] "In the bimolecular mechanism of CH activation, the alkoxide intermediate constitutes the active sites and CH activation occurs through hydride transfer from a second alkane molecule forming another alkoxide."
          [61] "This may be followed by βscission to regenerate the active site and complete the catalytic cycle."
          [62] "For example, activation of propane on acid zeolite based on the two mechanisms is illustrated in Scheme 1."
          [63] "Low reactant partial pressure and high temperature favor unimolecular dehydrogenation of alkane on acid zeolite."
          [64] "These conditions favor the endothermic desorption step (rate limiting step) leading to propene."
          [65] "In contrast, high partial pressure and low temperature favor the bimolecular mechanism leading to a low propene yield."
          [66] "The two molecular mechanisms devoid of side reactions give fairly predictable product distribution."
          [67] "However, the products of each route are prone to side reactions (dimerization, oligomerization, isomerization & aromatisation) in the presence of Bronsted acid sites."
          [68] "Hence propene selectivity on acidic zeolite is very low and products rich in aromatics are usually obtained."
          [69] "The active sites (alkoxide intermediate) of the bimolecular pathway are formed in situ."
          [70] "The alkoxide intermediate is made up of an alkyl carbenium ion ionically held to the zeolite framework oxygen ion."
          [71] "The active sites of the unimolecular pathway are the charge balancing protons of the zeolite framework."
          [72] "A proton and a carbenium ion are an electrophilic or Lewis acid species (a proton can also be considered as a special case of Lewis acidity)."
          [73] "The two pathways essentially involve electrophilic CH activation."
          [74] "The electrophiles (proton and carbenium ion) activate CH at high temperatures (500 C), giving low conversion rates of light alkanes and poor selectivity to corresponding alkenes."
          [75] "Iglesia and co-workers used isotopic labeling studies to demonstrate that CH activation is not the rate-limiting step in the dehydrogenation of propane on H-ZSM-5 and Ga/H-ZSM-5."
          [76] "They proposed that the CH bond cleavage produces an H-adatom and an alkoxide intermediate."
          [77] "Desorption of an alkene from the alkoxide regenerates the proton sites on the zeolites."
          [78] "An alkoxide intermediate may also discharge as a hydrogen rich species through cracking."
          [79] "Iglesia et al. proposed that desorption or disposal of the H-adatom from the CH bond cleavage is the rate-limiting step."
          [80] "A similar deduction was reached by Yu et al."
          [81] "who found that desorption of the alkoxides intermediate is the rate-limiting step under conditions that favor the unimolecular mechanism."
          [82] "The above proposition has been demonstrated on metal (e.g., Ga, Zn, and Co) exchanged zeolites."
          [83] "The specific role of the exchanged metals has been the subject of several reports with special attention on Ga and Zn."
          [84] "Although the framework Ga2O3 on H-MFI seems to have a CH polarization effect on desorbed methane, Ga2O3 exhibits lower CH activation activity."
          [85] "The physical mixture of Ga2O3/HMFI displays higher propane aromatisation activity than pure H-MFI."
          [86] "Similar synergistic effects have been reported for Zn/H-MFI and Co/H-MFI."
          [87] "Exchanged cations behave as monomeric species at the exchange sites of zeolite."
          [88] "Iglesia and Biscardi hypothesized that the monomeric species enhance propane conversion by promoting re-combinative desorption (RD) of the H-adatom formed from the CH cleavage."
          [89] "It is worthwhile noting that the exchange cations (electrophilic species) constitute the CH activation sites."
          [90] "Hence, more insights are required about their additional role in promoting RD."
          [91] "However, the authors did not provide further information on the nature of the H-adatoms and the mechanism of RD."
          [92] "In the next section, we examine the mechanism of desorption of H-adatoms over Ga and Zn exchanged H-ZSM-5."
          [93] "The exchanged metal ions in zeolites are held ionically by one or more basic oxygen atoms."
          [94] "Different species have been suggested, depending on the density of the cation exchange site of the zeolite and method of introduction of the metals."
          [95] "According to Kanansky et al."
          [96] "the exchanged Zn and Ga species on H-ZSM-5 and their mechanism of CH activation are distinctively different."
          [97] "Zn and Ga are introduced on H-ZSM-5 through a vapor deposition technique using Zn metal vapor and Ga(CH3)3 as the source of Zn and Ga, respectively."
          [98] "The metal introduction technique allows quantitative exchange of the zeolite protons which leads to Zn/Al = 0.5 and Ga/Al = 1, respectively."
          [99] "Zn2 + is generated directly, but Ga+ is produced by H2 treatment at 500 C to release the methyl groups."
          [100] "The proposed active sites are OZn2+O and OGa+, respectively."
          [101] "The mechanism of CH activation with ethane by the two sites under the same reaction conditions are summarized in Scheme 2."
          [102] "The proposed mechanism is in agreement with the mechanism suggested from calculations using the GAUSSIAN 94 program for ethane activation on Zn-exchanged zeolite by Frash and van Santen."
          [103] "In another theoretical study using a DFT cluster modeling approach, Pidko and van Santen compared the activation energy of CH with three types of Zn species at active sites: OZn2+O, OZn+OZn+O and HOZn+ O."
          [104] "The authors suggest that the reaction proceeds most easily on OZn2+O, and hypothesize that the enhanced Lewis activity of OZn2+O facilitates CH heterolytic cleavage."
          [105] "They further argue that the first proton abstraction occurs preferentially on the oxygen sites neighboring the ring where the cation is located."
          [106] "They proposed a one-step reaction to yield H2 and C2H4 from the decomposition of the Zn-alkyl and proton."
          [107] "A proposed mechanism of CH activation on OGa+ has similarly been suggested using theoretical calculations."
          [108] "High alkene selectivities are obtained on the H-ZSM-5 when exchangeable protons are rigorously replaced by Zn and Ga."
          [109] "The Zn-exchanged H-ZSM-5 had higher ethane conversion rates but lower ethene selectivity than its Ga counterpart."
          [110] "The CH activation on the OZn2+O site can be described by a Lewis base-assisted deprotonation mechanism."
          [111] "This is accompanied by conversion of the Lewis base site to a conjugate Bronsted acid site."
          [112] "The OGa+ site, however, activates the CH bond via oxidative addition without a protonic site intermediate."
          [113] "A protonic site intermediate increases tendency of side reactions on the Zn-exchanged H-ZSM-5 relative to the Ga counterpart."
          [114] "The elementary steps of CH activation on OGa+ (Scheme 2) reveal that a redox cycle at the metal center is required for catalytic CH activation via the oxidative addition mechanism."
          [115] "A redox cycle is not apparent in the elementary step presented for CH activation on OZn2+O."
          [116] "Hence, a redox cycle is not a requisite for CH activation via the Lewis base-assisted deprotonation mechanism."
          [117] "However, under alkane dehydrogenation reaction conditions, the OZn2+O sites can undergo a reversible Zn2 +/Zn redox process."
          [118] "This redox process increases the availability of undesired protonic site intermediates."
          [119] "Zn-exchanged H-ZSM-5 prepared by conventional ion-exchange methods contain a significant percentage of unexchanged proton sites leading to lower alkene selectivity of the catalyst."
          [120] "Iglesia and Biscardi titrate the proton sites with NaOH."
          [121] "The un-titrated and the titrated catalysts are denoted as Zn/H-ZSMS-5 and Zn/Na-ZSMS-5, respectively."
          [122] "Zn/Na-ZSM-5 has four times the propane conversion rate and a higher propene selectivity than Zn/H-ZSMS-5."
          [123] "The propene formation rate obtained with Zn/Na-ZSM-5 was ten times that of Zn/H-ZSMS-5."
          [124] "The zinc species at the cation exchange site of the zeolite was identified as OZn+OH."
          [125] "The higher propene selectivity obtained on Zn/Na-ZSM-5 compared to Zn/H-ZSMS-5 is presumably from the lower density and availability of proton sites on Zn/Na-ZSM-5."
          [126] "The improved propane conversion rate of Zn/Na-ZSM-5 compared to Zn/H-ZSM-5 is attributable to the higher efficiency of OZn+OH sites in catalyzing desorption of H-adatoms than OZn2+O sites."
          [127] "Another strategy to enhance alkene selectivity is by controlling the strength of the proton sites."
          [128] "The acidity of the sites depends on the nature of the trivalent cation of the zeolite framework."
          [129] "Proton sites in borosilicate zeolites are weaker than those of aluminosilicate, and thus higher alkene selectivity is expected for alkane dehydrogenation over Zn/H[B]-ZSM-5 compared to Zn/H[Al]-ZSM-5."
          [130] "However, Zn/H[B]-ZSM-5 shows no activity for propane dehydrogenation."
          [131] "The desired weaker acidity of the proton sites of Zn/H[B]-ZSM-5 requires weaker basicity of the oxygen atoms in the zeolite framework."
          [132] "This reduced basicity of the oxygen atoms is not sufficiently polarizing to complement the exchanged Zn2 + in CH bond cleavage."
          [133] "In the next section, we examine use of zeolite support to design a Pt-based alkane dehydrogenation catalyst."
          [134] "Elimination of the proton sites of zeolites is critical for obtaining a high alkene selectivity and stability in dehydrogenation catalysts."
          [135] "Pt is the most versatile noble metal catalyst for alkane reactions."
          [136] "Although Pt is expensive, the choice of Pt is often justified by its higher activity, stability and selectivity for these reactions compared to less expensive alternative transition metals."
          [137] "However, rapid catalyst deactivation due to coke formation remains a challenge even when using a Pt-based catalyst for dehydrogenation of light alkanes."
          [138] "Waku et al."
          [139] "exploited the unique property of zeolite as a support for achieving high metal dispersion through cation exchange sites to create a Pt/Na[Fe]-ZSM-5 catalyst with outstanding stability for dehydrogenation of light alkanes."
          [140] "They found that the catalyst deactivation rate of Pt/Na[Fe]-ZSM-5 was lower than for any other Pt-based catalysts in refractory oxide support."
          [141] "The unprecedented performance of Pt/Na[Fe]-ZSM-5 was attributed to its high Pt dispersion (cluster size < 1 mm) on zeolite through ion-exchange."
          [142] "There is a tendency to generate some Brnsted protons on the zeolite during the exchange process, but the choice of Fe3 + as an isomorphous cation in place of Al3 + led to weaker Brnsted sites in [Fe]-ZSM compared to [Al]-ZSM."
          [143] "The weaker acidity minimizes the tendency of side reactions (cracking of oligomerization, aromatisation, and coke), which translates into higher alkene selectivity and catalyst stability."
          [144] "In another report, Xuebing and Iglesia demonstrated the ability of Pt/Na[Fe]-ZSM-5 to dehydrogenate alkanes longer than C4; n-pentane and n-heptane were selectively converted to n-pentene and n-heptene, respectively."
          [145] "Alkene selectivity was also improved when the residual proton generated during Pt exchange or Na-[Fe]-ZSM was titrated with Cs."
          [146] "Although Pt with conventional refractory oxides (Al2O3, SiO2, ZrO2, etc.) used for dehydrogenation of alkanes has similar conversion rates to Pt/Na[Fe]-ZSM-5, deactivation rates are also rapid due to coke formation."
          [147] "The presence of acid (Bronsted and Lewis) sites on the supports promotes readsorption, oligomerization and aromatisation of alkenes."
          [148] "Promotion of Pt with metals, such as Sn, Ga, Zn, Re, etc., improves catalyst stability, but also leads to faster deactivation rates than Pt/Na[Fe]-ZSM-5."
          [149] "However, recent reports by Bell et al."
          [150] "show that the use of calcined hydrotalcite (Al/Mg  0.1) supported on bimetallic PtGa or PtSn gave very high alkene selectivity and stability, comparable to Pt/Na[Fe]-ZSM-5."
          [151] "At this stage, we can conclude that differences in the performance of Zn and Ga exchanged H-ZSM-5 obtained by Kanansky et al."
          [152] "are attributable to their respective CH activation mechanisms."
          [153] "In addition, the role of exchanged Zn and Ga as promoters of RD becomes evident from the mechanisms (Scheme 2)."
          [154] "The RD mechanism on Ga exchanged H-ZSM-5 is by reductive elimination of a hydrogen molecule from O[Ga(H)2]+ intermediate."
          [155] "Decomposition of ZnR and a protonic site, or neutralization of the proton sites by ZnH, leads to desorption of the hydrogen molecule on the Zn-exchanged H-ZSM-5."
          [156] "By extrapolation, the mechanisms of CH activation on exchanged Zn and Ga H-ZSM-5 can described the mechanism of alkane dehydrogenation on Cr-based and Pt-based catalysts respectively."
          [157] "The electronic promotion effect of Sn is in line with the oxidative addition CH activation mechanism."
          [158] "However, the Lewis base-assisted deprotonation mechanism could also explain the proposed CH activation on Cr-based catalysts."
          [159] "Now, the nature and the role of surface oxygen species become more evident."
          [160] "The role of potassium in commercial Cr and Pt-based dehydrogenation catalysts is to minimize the undesired influence of protonic sites on alkene selectivity."
          [161] "The highlights in this section are presented in Table 2."
          [162] "The table reveals the insights achieved on the reaction mechanism, alkene selectivity and catalyst stability for non-oxidative dehydrogenation of lower alkanes."
          [163] "Nonetheless, the level of catalyst activity is still far from acceptable, even at high temperature."
          [164] "A recent report by Rothenberg et al."
          [165] "provides a lead in this respect."
          [166] "Their report indicates that a porous copperaluminum framework material (stabilized by metal oxide) has better performance (activity/selectivity/stability) for propane dehydrogenation than a PtSn/Al2O3."
          [167] "Of particular interest, is the suggestion that achieving propane dehydrogenation at 350 C may be possible."
          [168] "Few details are known about the structure of the porous copperaluminum framework material."
          [169] "However, copper is implicated as providing the active sites for the catalysis."
          [170] "Also, that the material activated in oxygen gave higher propane conversion rates than those activated in inert gas atmosphere underscores the role of the surface oxide (oxygen species) in the catalysis."
          [171] "Thus, the Lewis base-assisted deprotonation mechanism may be invoked here, and the redox property of the metal center is likely to play a role in achieving propane dehydrogenation at 350 C."
          [172] "This should constitute the future research direction for non-oxidative dehydrogenation of lower alkanes."
          [173] "Although the equilibrium conversion of alkanes increases with temperature, alkene selectivity decreases with increasing temperature and chain length due to an increased tendency toward dehydrocyclization/aromatisation, thermal cracking and coke formation."
          [174] "Direct dehydrogenation of lower alkanes is an energy intensive reaction; however, oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) has the potential to lower the energy requirement for achieving dehydrogenation."
          [175] "ODH can be considered as tandem endothermic (dehydrogenation, CnH2n + 2  CnH2n + H2) and exothermic (oxidation, H2 + O2  H2O) processes, with an overall thermodynamic summation, CnH2n + 2 + O2  CnH2n + H2O."
          [176] "Although the process is not thermo-neutral, part of the energy required for the endothermic reaction is augmented by the exothermic reaction."
          [177] "Thus, ODH of alkanes takes place at lower temperature compared to the corresponding non-ODH."
          [178] "This lower temperature requirement of ODH compared to non-ODH and cracking is encouraging and provides motivation for continued efforts to develop ODH into an industrial technology."
          [179] "Although ODH is attractive because of the energy intensification advantage, commercial ODH technologies hinge on innovative catalyst and process design, i.e. proper synergy of the endothermic dehydrogenation step with the exothermic hydrogen combustion and design of selective CH and hydrogen combustion catalysts."
          [180] "In this report, we provide an overview on CH activation and reaction routes to alkane dehydrogenation."
          [181] "We seek to gain insights about components of the active sites of CH activation to provide a platform for rational design of new efficient catalysts for dehydrogenation of lower alkanes."
          [182] "We focus on propane dehydrogenation because of the need for alternative and/or complementary technology for propene production to supplement existing technologies."
          [183] "We survey non-oxidative and oxidative dehydrogenation approaches, and examine reaction routes that are intermediate between these two main approaches."

[1] "Although there are other metallic reforming catalysts such as Ru and Rh, which are less strongly prone to coking than Ni,129 Ni is one of the most common reforming catalysts, which is partly due to its significantly cheaper price. In order to overcome the coking problem of Ni catalysts, numerous theoretical studies have been conducted to understand the coke formation on nickel and to come up with potential strategies to avoid the unwanted coking process."
          [2] "It could be shown that the adsorption of C atoms on the closed packed surface of a NiAu surface alloy is thermodynamically less favoured, by 23 kJ mol1 or more, than the analogous process on a pure Ni(111) surface.134 Based on this finding, it has been proposed to alloy Ni with Au.134 A cheaper alternative is to alloy Ni with Sn which hinders the CC bond formation and enhances the CO bond formation leading to the removal of surface C centers as carbon monoxide.135,136 It has been discussed that the Sn atoms separate the Ni centers on the catalyst surface, which tend to bind C atoms, from each other. With the Ni centers being separated, the C atoms on the surface are separated as well, which hinders the formation of coke.135,136 These theoretical results are consistent with experiments which show that pure Ni catalysts deactivate significantly faster than NiSn alloy based catalysts.135 Since the step sites play an essential role in the growth of the graphene islands, as mentioned above, additives such as potassium,66 sulfur,66 gold66 or boron131 have been proposed.66 Computational calculations have shown that these elements tend to occupy the step sites and thus avoid the formation of graphene islands.66,131 A similar strategy, by blocking the crucial sites, has been proposed to prevent the formation of a carbidic phase. Calculations have shown that boron prefers the same sub-surface sites on Ni as C.137 By occupying these sites with B, the diffusion of C to these sub-surface sites and the formation of the thermodynamically more stable carbide phase can be prevented.128 Apart from blocking the sub-surface sites, sub-surface boron in Ni(111) also has been shown to have an destabilizing effect on on-surface C centers,138 which may help to prevent the accumulation of C atoms on the surface."
          [3] "Although supported Pt catalysts show high activity, the catalyst deactivation due to coke formation remains a challenging issue."
          [4] "The robustness against coking can be increased with additional promoters, such as late transition metals, main-group metals including Sn and Ga, alkali-metal oxides and rare-earth metal oxides."
          [5] "It has been demonstrated for graphene islands on the Ni(111) surface, unsaturated C atoms at the edge of a graphene island are less stable than isolated C atoms on the metal surface."
          [6] "A cheaper alternative is to alloy Ni with Sn which hinders the CC bond formation and enhances the CO bond formation leading to the removal of surface C centers as carbon monoxide."
          [7] "Since the step sites play an essential role in the growth of the graphene islands, as mentioned above, additives such as potassium, sulfur, gold or boron have been proposed."
          [8] "Apart from blocking the sub-surface sites, sub-surface boron in Ni(111) also has been shown to have an destabilizing effect on on-surface C centers, which may help to prevent the accumulation of C atoms on the surface."

[1] "A catalyst design consisting of the double-decoration of nanoparticulate intermetallic PtGa with Pb and Ca was applied to produce an ultra-stable catalyst for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) at a high temperature."
          [2] "PtGaCaPb/SiO2 exhibited outstanding catalytic stability in PDH at 600C, and almost no deactivation was observed for up to 1month."
          [3] "Herein, we report a novel catalyst design concept, namely, the double decoration of PtGa intermetallics by Pb and Ca, which synergize the geometric and electronic promotion effects on the catalyst stability, respectively."
          [4] "Pb is deposited on the three-fold Pt3 sites of the PtGa nanoparticles to block them, whereas Ca, which affords an electron-enriched single-atom-like Pt1 site, is placed around the nanoparticles."
          [5] "Thus, PtGaCaPb/SiO2 exhibits an outstandingly high catalytic stability, even at 600C (kd=0.00033h1, τ=3067h), and almost no deactivation of the catalyst was observed for up to 1month for the first time."

[1] "To expose the loaded Pt on the surface of the carriers, ion exchange and impregnation are two simple and practical methods. The dispersion of Pt mainly depends on the precursors of Pt, the preparation conditions, the properties of the carriers, and the interaction between Pt and the carriers, as well as the additives."
          [2] "The addition of a second metal has been found to be highly effective for the sintering resistance of Pt particles. The introduced metal forms alloys with Pt around Pt particles,63 and the alloys anchor them on the surface of the carriers, making them not easy to migrate and coalesce."
          [3] "The application of the carriers possessing a strong interaction with Pt is another way to retard the sintering. Al2O3 is the most common carrier of Pt catalyst, in which the coordinatively unsaturated pentacoordinate Al3+ can anchor Pt to make it not easy to migrate."
          [4] "Nanocarbon was also reported as the carrier of Pt to improve the sintering resistance, and the strong metalcarrier interaction leads to the electron transfer from nanocarbon to the Pt particles, significantly preventing the sintering of Pt."
          [5] "MgAl2O4 spinel is also a good choice as the carrier. Generally, Pt is not directly loaded on MgAl2O4 spinel prepared beforehand, but firstly loaded into the spaces between the layers of MgAlOx hydrotalcite, and then Pt particles are enclosed in the interspace of MgAl2O4 spinel formed through the collapse of the layered structure of the hydrotalcite after calcination at high temperature."
          [6] "Moliner et al.67 reported effective methods to encapsulate Pt in highly siliceous chabazite, and the catalyst showed enhanced stability towards Pt sintering even at 650750 C in the atmospheres of H2, O2 and H2O."
          [7] "The Al2O3 overcoat has also proved to be efficient in preventing the sintering of Pt nanoparticles through atomic layer deposition."
          [8] "Tanabe et al. revealed that no Pt sintering was observed for Pt/MgO as an automotive exhaust catalyst after calcination in air at 900 C, for the formation of a Mg2PtO4-like compound prevents the migration of Pt."
          [9] "Nagai et al. found that CeO2 had a similar effect of MgO in preventing the sintering of Pt due to the formation of the PtOCe bond in the Pt/CeO2 catalyst."
          [10] "Recently, Pt supported on CeO2 has attracted more attention because of the ability of CeO2 to trap Pt in an atomically dispersed state."
          [11] "The atomically dispersed Pt is most likely to be present in the form of Pt2+ bonded to the ubiquitous step edges of the CeO2 surface."
          [12] "The addition of Ga, In, Zn, Cu, Ir, Co to Pt catalysts exhibits similar effects as Sn."
          [13] "Not only that, but Sattler et al.84 showed that in the highly active, selective and stable PtGaK/Al2O3 (0.1 wt% Pt, 3 wt% Ga, 0.25 wt% K) catalyst for the dehydrogenation of propane, the coordinately unsaturated Ga3+ is responsible for activating the CH bond, and Pt only acts as a promoter."
          [14] "Furthermore, just like the PtSn/CeO2 catalyst,29 the reactivity can be fully recovered via simple coke burning in air, although the sintering of Pt still occurs."
          [15] "Located at the same main group with Ga, In was also reported to be the promoter of supported Pt catalysts. The PtIn/Mg(Al)O catalyst prepared at pH 8 using the co-precipitation method exhibits the best catalytic performance and the strongest interaction between the metal phase and the carrier."
          [16] "B and Si, two nonmetal elements, can play similar roles, too. Dehydrogenation of n-butane over the PtB/SiO2 catalyst showed improved catalytic activity and stability compared with Pt/SiO2."
          [17] "Dadras et al.86 called B a magic bullet against sintering and coking, and they summarized the positive roles of B as follows. The non-stoichiometric PtB cluster is anchored to the carrier via a covalent BO bond, which is much stronger than the interaction between Pt clusters and the carrier surface."
          [18] "Additionally, the dissociation energy of a Pt atom from a PtB cluster is significantly larger than that from the pure Pt cluster, increasing the sintering resistance."
          [19] "Finally, the affinity of PtB cluster to C also drops dramatically, leading to the reduced coke formation and increased selectivity to olefins."
          [20] "It is predicted by a computational screening of main-group elements as potential additives for the Pt catalyst that Si, just as B, can modify the selectivity of the Pt catalyst by changing both electronic and geometric properties."

[1] "In this review, we outline the progress of these dehydrogenation catalysts that have been mainly developed in the past five years. For different classes of the most-promising catalysts in the selective dehydrogenation of ethane-to-ethylene and propane-to-propylene, their syntheses, structural information, catalytic properties and mechanisms are comparatively summarized."

[1] "To improve the stability of Pt-based catalysts, many efforts have been dedicated to strengthen metalsupport interactions by using various methods including the nanopore-encaged metal strategy,2124 wet-chemistry approach2529 and modification of supports.10,11,30,31 Among them, modification of supports is a relatively effective and simple method to improve the stability of Pt-based catalysts."
          [2] "For example, Lu et al. reported a PtSn/Al2O3 sheet catalyst for PDH, exhibiting high activity, selectivity and stability.11 It was proposed that the enhanced stability in PDH was associated with γ-Al2O3 nanosheets containing a great deal of pentacoordinate Al3+ ions, which can stabilize PtSn clusters by strong interactions between metals and supports."
          [3] "Recent work by Ma et al. showed that the addition of Ga into Mg(Al)O layer double hydrotalcites could greatly enhance the stability of Pt catalysts in PDH.10 It may be due to the fact that pentacoordinate Ga3+ ions could disperse and stabilize PtSn clusters, thereby enhancing the electronic interactions between Pt and Ga."
          [4] "A similar conclusion regarding the importance of modification of supports has been reported in the case of PtSn/CeO2 catalysts.30"
          [5] "Therefore, this provides a way to tune and enhance the catalytic activity and selectivity for the PDH process, and also introduces unique stability characteristics for bimetallic systems."
          [6] "Herein, highly stable Pt/Sn-Si-beta catalysts for PDH were prepared by an improved post-synthesis strategy, which consists of dealumination of H-beta and subsequent metal impregnation."
          [7] "It is indicated that Sn species existing in tetrahedral coordination states were incorporated into the framework of dealuminated beta (Si-beta)."
          [8] "Meanwhile, Pt species were highly dispersed in the form of ultra-small nanoclusters on Pt/Sn-Si-beta due to the strong interaction between Pt and Sn(IV) sites confined in the Si-beta framework."
          [9] "The prepared Pt/Sn-Si-beta catalysts show excellent catalytic performance for PDH, in which the propene formation rate was 2.3 mol g1Pt h1 with a propene selectivity of >99% at 550 C and the higher propene formation rate was 3.1 mol g1Pt h1 at 600 C."
          [10] "Moreover, the strong PtSn interactions and the confinement effect of Sn in the Si-beta framework inhibit the coke and sintering of Pt clusters, thereby achieving good stability of dehydrogenation and regeneration with almost unchanged catalytic activity during four cycles at 550 C."



[1] "Although the direct dehydrogenation technique has been industrialized, the fabrication of the corresponding catalysts is still confronted with a series of plights."

          [16] "The introduction of an appropriate metal oxide or noble metal into a catalytic system can greatly enhance the catalytic performance."



[1] "Extensive research efforts have been made to inhibit deactivation and improve propene selectivity of Pt-based catalysts by doping promoters of Sn [9,10], In [11,12], Ga [13,14] and Cu [15] to form bimetallic catalysts."
          [2] "For example, PtIn [16] and PtGa [17,18] bimetallic nanoparticles (NPs) supported on calcined hydrotalcites (HT) show higher activity and selectivity in PDH, which has been attributed to the increased Pt dispersion and electron transfer from In or Ga to Pt [11,18]."
          [3] "Besides promoters, another method is to modify Al2O3 support with ZnO [19], La2O3 [20] or TiO2 [21] or replace Al2O3 support with ZnAl2O4 [22], ZSM-5 [23] or Mg(Al)O oxide [8,24]."
          [4] "Additionally, it has been verified that the single Pt atom sites on Pt-Sn/γ-Al2O3 with a sandwich structure are more favorable for PDH reaction than Pt ensembles [25,26]."
          [5] "Gong et al. [15] also reported that the PtCu single atom alloys can enhance the propane conversion and propene selectivity simultaneously in PDH."
          [6] "Whether as promoters or supports, an important aim of using them is to obtain highly and stably dispersed Pt-based catalysts so that improving PDH performance."
          [7] "However, it is still difficult to break through these challenges for PDH reactions [27], and the exact Pt-M-support relationship is still unclear."
          [8] "Therefore, it is extremely necessary to find more efficient methods to solve the problems mentioned above."
          [9] "In fact, the hierarchical morphology and porous structure play important roles in many heterogeneous catalytic reactions. However, the effect of hierarchical microstructure is seldom reported."
          [10] "Given that the small Pt NPs and hierarchical microstructure may provide more stable and easily accessible active sites for PDH reaction, a promising design for obtaining the desired size of active Pt and hierarchical pore morphology was proposed."
          [11] "The promoted effects of HT reconstruction on the microstructure and morphology of the 3D oxide nanosheet array catalyst, and the subsequently superior PDH performance, were profoundly discussed."

Stable and selective catalysts for propane dehydrogenation operating at thermodynamic limit Hitting the limits on propene synthesis The greater abundance of propane from shale gas has spurred efforts to use it as a propylene feedstock. Direct dehydrogenation catalysts consisting of platinumtin alloy nanoparticles supported on alumina often must run with hydrogen dilution to avoid carbon buildup and excess tin to avoid alloy segregation.
          We report that silica-supported platinum-tin (Pt1Sn1) nanoparticles (&lt;2 nanometers in diameter) can operate as a PDH catalyst at thermodynamically limited conversion levels, with excellent stability and selectivity to propylene (&gt;99%). Atomic mixing of Pt and Sn in the precursor is preserved upon reduction and during catalytic operation. The benign interaction of these nanoparticles with the silicon dioxide support does not lead to Pt-Sn segregation and formation of a tin oxide phase that can occur over traditional catalyst supports.
          To alleviate this issue, large quantities of Sn are used in the catalyst preparation (the nominal atomic loading is Sn:Pt between 4 and 5), which increases the yield of intermetallic PtSn NPs (12). In addition, studies have shown that adding hydrogen to the reactant feed reduces the rate of catalyst deactivation (13). Although this strategy is implemented commercially (10), addition of hydrogen in the feed lowers the thermodynamic limit on per-pass propane conversion (fig. S1) and decreases productivity (7).
          We developed a PDH catalyst that operates at thermodynamically limited conversion levels without the addition of hydrogen to the feed and exhibits excellent stability and selectivity to propylene (&gt;99%). The catalyst is composed of silica-supported Pt1Sn1 NPs, synthesized and pretreated to ensure that the mixing of Pt and Sn is preserved during catalytic operation.
          The principle behind catalyst synthesis is to begin with a heterometallic Pt-Sn coordination complex in which Pt and Sn are in immediate contact, and this interaction is retained during the reduction and PDH reaction.
          The data in Fig. 1, A to C, were obtained with 16 vol % propane in helium. Propane streams are diluted in commercial operations to increase the limiting equilibrium conversion, which is higher at lower propane partial pressure (fig. S2), and to limit catalyst deactivation rates (7, 16, 17). This approach requires additional downstream separation units and limits process efficiency.
          The data in Fig. 1, A to C, show the performance of the Pt1Sn1/SiO2 catalyst (1 wt % Pt and 0.6 wt % Sn) for propane dehydrogenation at 580C, 16 vol % propane (with the remainder helium) and at a weight hourly space velocity (WHSV) of 4.7 hours1. Under these reaction conditions, the thermodynamic limit on propane conversion is 66.5% (fig. S2). The Pt1Sn1/SiO2 catalyst showed near-thermodynamic conversion of &gt;66% (Fig. 1A, red circles) and &gt;99% selectivity to propylene (Fig. 1B, red circles).
          The data in Fig. 1D show that, under these conditions, the propane conversion goes from 41 to 39% in 120 min. Under identical conditions, the other tested catalysts deactivate very rapidly to very low conversion, as illustrated for the commercial mimic. A transmission electron microscopy (TEM) image of the spent catalyst, after 120 min of PDH reaction, is shown in fig. S6. The image shows that the Pt-Sn NPs are well dispersed, with an average particle diameter of 1.6  0.67 nm, which is consistent with the particle size in fresh samples.
          We attempted to regenerate the Pt1Sn1/SiO2 catalyst by oxidation, using 1% O2 as a mild oxidant at 500C followed by reduction at 600C (see supplementary materials for details of the regeneration procedure). The regeneration studies showed that Pt1Sn1/SiO2 catalysts can be partially regenerated. For example, we measured 97% of the initial activity and &gt;99% of the initial selectivity after three PDH/regeneration cycles (fig. S5).
          Data in Fig. 3A show that the process of mixing chloroplatinic acid (H2PtCl6) and tin(II) chloride (SnCl2) in 0.1 M hydrochloric acid solution formed a heterometallic Pt-Sn coordination complex.
          A bright-field TEM image of Pt-Sn NPs formed on SiO2 upon the reduction of the Pt-Sn complex shows high metal dispersion on the support, with an average NP size of 1.3  0.6 nm (Fig. 3B). The NP size distribution (Fig. 3C) shows that most NPs were &lt;2 nm. The XRD spectra in Fig. 3D show that the formed NPs were essentially alloys of Pt and Sn. This finding is supported by the presence of the XRD peaks corresponding to Pt1Sn1 (41.8 and 44.1) and Pt3Sn1 (39.0 and 45.3) stoichiometries.
          The real-space Pt LIII EXAFS spectra for the Pt1Sn1/SiO2 catalyst (Fig. 4D) are substantially different from the spectra of monometallic Pt and indicate the mixing of Pt and Sn atoms. The best-fit spectrum for the Pt1Sn1/SiO2 catalyst is characterized by the presence of the Pt-Pt and Pt-Sn scattering paths, consistent with the formation of PtSn intermetallic phases.

          [2] "Herein, a series of highly ordered mesoporous Al2O3 supports with different levels of Al3+penta sites, are fabricated and used as the support to disperse Pt-Sn2 clusters."
          [3] "The stability and regenerability of Pt-Sn2/meso-Al2O3 are strongly dependent on the content of Al3+penta sites in the Al2O3 structure, and a high level of Al3+penta sites can effectively prevent the agglomeration of Pt-Sn2 clusters into large Pt nanoparticles in the consecutive dehydrogenation-regeneration cycles."



[1] "Rare-earthplatinum alloy nanoparticles in mesoporous zeolite for catalysis Platinum is a much used catalyst that, in petrochemical processes, is often alloyed with other metals to improve catalytic activity, selectivity and longevity1,2,3,4,5."
          [2] "Such catalysts are usually prepared in the form of metallic nanoparticles supported on porous solids, and their production involves reducing metal precursor compounds under a H2 flow at high temperatures6."
          [3] "The method works well when using easily reducible late transition metals, but Pt alloy formation with rare-earth elements through the H2 reduction route is almost impossible owing to the low chemical potential of rare-earth element oxides6."
          [4] "Here we use as support a mesoporous zeolite that has pore walls with surface framework defects (called silanol nests) and show that the zeolite enables alloy formation between Pt and rare-earth elements."
          [5] "We find that the silanol nests enable the rare-earth elements to exist as single atomic species with a substantially higher chemical potential compared with that of the bulk oxide, making it possible for them to diffuse onto Pt."
          [6] "High-resolution transmission electron microscopy and hydrogen chemisorption measurements indicate that the resultant bimetallic nanoparticles supported on the mesoporous zeolite are intermetallic compounds, which we find to be stable, highly active and selective catalysts for the propane dehydrogenation reaction."
          [7] "When used with late transition metals, the same preparation strategy produces Pt alloy catalysts that incorporate an unusually large amount of the second metal and, in the case of the PtCo alloy, show high catalytic activity and selectivity in the preferential oxidation of carbon monoxide in H2."
          [8] "The industrial PDH process has been using PtSn bimetallic catalysts supported on porous alumina for nearly three decades, since its discovery in the early 1990s3,7."
          [9] "The Pt metal alone exhibits high initial catalytic activity, but rapidly deactivates as a result of coke deposition on the Pt surface."
          [10] "The coke deposition also causes an undesirable loss of the catalytic selectivity to propylene."
          [11] "To alleviate these problems, Sn is introduced to form an alloy with Pt nanoparticles and thereby dilute the Pt surface with inactive Sn atoms and break up coke-generating Pt ensembles."
          [12] "Our search for a highly active and more durable PDH catalyst has focused on using a siliceous MFI zeolite with a hierarchical micro-/mesoporous structure as a replacement for the alumina support."
          [13] "This zeolite, synthesized using a multi-ammonium surfactant as a structure-directing agent, has attracted attention as an advanced catalyst support8,9,10,11,12,13 owing to its unique structure, which comprises ultrathin zeolite frameworks and three-dimensionally interconnected mesopores that boost the catalytic performance of supported metals by providing both facile reactant and product diffusion and high metal nanoparticle dispersion within the mesopores12,13."
          [14] "The formation of the Pt3La and Pt3Y nanoparticles on the degallated zeolite brought a striking enhancement in all aspects of the PDH catalytic performance, including activity, selectivity and durability, as shown in Fig. 2."
          [15] "The catalytic reaction was performed at 580C using a pure propane flow at a large space velocity (see Methods), and these harsh operating conditions caused even the conventional PtSn/alumina catalyst to experience severe coke formation and catalyst deactivation within 1 d."
          [16] "In sharp contrast, the Pt3La intermetallic nanoparticles supported on the degallated zeolite (denoted as PtLa/mz-deGa, where mz stands for mesoporous zeolite) showed a high initial propane conversion of 40% (close to the equilibrium conversion) and underwent extremely slow deactivation, retaining 8% conversion even after 30 days of reaction."
          [17] "The PtREE incorporation in the mesoporous zeolite was conducted by co-impregnation of aqueous solutions of Pt(NH3)4(NO3)2 and either La(NO3)3·6H2O or Y(NO3)3·6H2O, followed by heating under an O2 flow at 350C and subsequently under H2 at 700C (see Methods)."
          [18] "The formation of the Pt3La and Pt3Y nanoparticles on the degallated zeolite brought a striking enhancement in all aspects of the PDH catalytic performance, including activity, selectivity and durability, as shown in Fig. 2."
          [19] "The PtREE/zeolite showed formation of Pt3La and Pt3Y nanoparticles throughout the zeolite support."
          [20] "The PtREE/zeolite sample shown in Fig. 1 was prepared using a degallated zeolite containing a large number of silanol nest sites."
          [21] "The PtREE/zeolite showed a high initial propane conversion of 40% (close to the equilibrium conversion) and underwent extremely slow deactivation, retaining 8% conversion even after 30 days of reaction."
          [22] "The PtREE/zeolite contained a small amount of Ga (Si/Ga = 598) even after the degallation, and that this may participate in the catalytic function17,18."
          [23] "The effect of the remaining Ga was examined from the differences in PDH performance of mz-deGa, La/mz-deGa and Pt/mz-deGa, as shown in Extended Data Fig. 7."
          [24] "The PtREE/zeolite as a support would allow the discovery of not only REE-based alloy catalysts, but also other transition metal-based alloy catalysts with various compositions and structures, opening up new opportunities for catalytic applications."

[1] "Although the equilibrium conversion of alkanes increases with temperature, alkene selectivity decreases with increasing temperature and chain length due to an increased tendency toward dehydrocyclization/aromatisation, thermal cracking and coke formation."
          [2] "Direct dehydrogenation of lower alkanes is an energy intensive reaction; however, oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) has the potential to lower the energy requirement for achieving dehydrogenation."
          [3] "ODH can be considered as tandem endothermic (dehydrogenation, CnH2n + 2  CnH2n + H2) and exothermic (oxidation, H2 + O2  H2O) processes, with an overall thermodynamic summation, CnH2n + 2 + O2  CnH2n + H2O."
          [4] "Although the process is not thermo-neutral, part of the energy required for the endothermic reaction is augmented by the exothermic reaction."
          [5] "Thus, ODH of alkanes takes place at lower temperature compared to the corresponding non-ODH."
          [6] "This lower temperature requirement of ODH compared to non-ODH and cracking is encouraging and provides motivation for continued efforts to develop ODH into an industrial technology."
          [7] "Although ODH is attractive because of the energy intensification advantage, commercial ODH technologies hinge on innovative catalyst and process design, i.e. proper synergy of the endothermic dehydrogenation step with the exothermic hydrogen combustion and design of selective CH and hydrogen combustion catalysts."
          [8] "In this report, we provide an overview on CH activation and reaction routes to alkane dehydrogenation."
          [9] "We seek to gain insights about components of the active sites of CH activation to provide a platform for rational design of new efficient catalysts for dehydrogenation of lower alkanes."
          [10] "We focus on propane dehydrogenation because of the need for alternative and/or complementary technology for propene production to supplement existing technologies."
          [11] "We survey non-oxidative and oxidative dehydrogenation approaches, and examine reaction routes that are intermediate between these two main approaches."
          [12] "Catalyst improvement endeavors can benefit from insights on alkane CH bond activation mechanisms."
          [13] "Developing direct routes to obtain key organic chemicals from lower alkanes would benefit industry."
          [14] "Lower alkanes are relatively inert, and they exhibit little or no reactivity at conditions typical for activating functional group reactions in organic compounds because they lack low-lying vacant orbitals or lone pair electrons."
          [15] "Alkanes are made up non-polar CC and CH bonds. These bonds consist of strongly localised electron pairs that are usually induced to reactivity under severe conditions (e.g., at high temperature or pressure, or with the use of aggressive reagents)."
          [16] "The first and rate-limiting step of alkane dehydrogenation using platinum or chromium oxide-based catalysts involves CH activation."
          [17] "Although a number of efforts have been made to gain insight on the mechanism of the reaction, questions still remain, especially regarding the pathway of the CH activation."
          [18] "It is of fundamental and applied interest to know whether the first CH bond cleavage is homolytic or heterolytic."
          [19] "If it is a heterolytic pathway, it will further be of interest to know whether the first hydrogen from the alkane substrate is abstracted as a proton or as a hydride ion."
          [20] "This knowledge will benefit catalyst improvement efforts."
          [21] "The simple impregnation techniques for preparing supported (especially alumina) metal and oxide catalysts becloud their structural heterogeneity."
          [22] "This structural heterogeneity makes the properties-performance correlation of the catalysts complicated."
          [23] "Microporous zeolites are structurally defined framework materials that may constitute a good starting point for obtaining more precise information on the properties-performance correlation of dehydrogenation catalysts."
          [24] "In the next section, we examine adsorption and non-oxidative dehydrogenation of propane on microporous zeolite-based catalysts."
          [25] "Although several solid acid catalysts are used in alkane conversions, zeolites have the advantage of possessing a well-defined structure, allowing the structure-activity relationship to be easily deduced."
          [26] "Therefore, it is instructive to examine non-oxidative dehydrogenation of light alkanes over zeolite catalysts."
          [27] "A detailed knowledge of the adsorption mechanism of lower alkane molecules on zeolite is of interest in this context, especially for informed tuning of zeolite properties to allow efficient and selective dehydrogenation of alkanes."
          [28] "Light alkanes are adsorbed on zeolites via dispersive interaction."
          [29] "Protons and the exchanged metals ions are typically the active sites in zeolites, while the zeolite framework plays the role of anchor for the active sites and/or dispersion medium for the reactants."
          [30] "The framework of microporous zeolites exerts dispersive forces on the reactant's molecules that depend on the shape, channel and cavity of the framework."
          [31] "In addition, the nature and the density of the active sites influence the framework dispersion forces."
          [32] "Recent reports have shown that the strong electrostatic field between protons or exchanged metal ions and basic oxygen species can enhance and/or induce polarization of bonds in hydrocarbon adsorbates."
          [33] "This agrees with Hashiguchi et al., who found enhanced activation of the CH bond on a homogeneous catalyst."
          [34] "Wender et al. showed that 3040% of heat adsorption in n-alkanes on Na-zeolite is due to polarization of the adsorbates."
          [35] "Subbotina et al. also demonstrated that the CH bond of ethane is more strongly polarized on Mg2 + and Ca2 + forms of Y zeolite than on Na+ forms."
          [36] "Mg2 +-Y zeolite molecules exhibit weaker adsorption and polarization of ethane than Ca2 +-zeolites."
          [37] "Based on charge density considerations, Mg2 + cations are expected to exhibit a stronger polarizing effect than Ca2 + cations."
          [38] "Subbotina et al. explain that because of the smaller ionic radius of Mg2 +, it is more strongly shielded by the surrounding oxygen atoms of the zeolite lattice than a Ca2 + ion, thereby reducing the polarizing effect of Mg2 + on the hydrocarbon adsorbate."
          [39] "Sievers et al. also report that the La3 + form of X zeolite induces strong polarization of adsorbed alkane molecules; partial positive charges were induced on secondary and tertiary carbon atoms of alkane molecules."
          [40] "The authors suggest that the polarization may be viewed as an intermediate condition to hydride abstraction (which is an important elementary step in CH activation)."
          [41] "They add that CH bond polarization was enhanced by physisorbed water molecules that coordinate with La3 + cations."
          [42] "The enhanced polarization of CH bonds by the presence of water molecules on La3 +X zeolite may have a beneficial effect in oxidative dehydrogenation where water is a by-product."
          [43] "Alkane polarization studies on Na+, Mg2 +, Ca2 +, and La3 + exchanged X-zeolites indicate that the polarizing effect increases with increasing charge magnitude and ionic radius."
          [44] "Note that these alkane polarizing cations occupy the same position on the zeolites as the well-known CH activation cations/metals, and thus the CH polarizing effect has a complementary effect on CH activation."
          [45] "This may add to the number of relevant variables and increase the challenge of optimizing the ratio of activation/polarizing cations among exchangeable sites (Si/Al ratio), as well as the sequence for incorporating the cations or metals during catalyst preparation."
          [46] "Further, it is important to note that the choice of cations should be such that they exhibit no catalytic (oligomerization, isomerization, aromatisation or oxidation) effects on the target alkene products at the reaction condition."
          [47] "Furthermore, it may be beneficial to create a CH polarization effect on the zeolite framework."
          [48] "This can be achieved by appropriate chance of framework atoms."
          [49] "Since active sites are usually created on the zeolite frameworks."
          [50] "The activation of CH bonds of light alkanes occurs readily on super electrophiles (super Brnsted and super Lewis acid) at low temperatures."
          [51] "Although CH activation on zeolites have been observed at low temperatures, industrial alkane reactions on zeolites are usually carried out at high temperatures."
          [52] "Several experimental and theoretical studies on the molecular dynamics of light alkanes on zeolite have been published."
          [53] "However, despite the decades of intensive investigations on the subject, the actual mechanism of CH activation on acid zeolite is still debated."
          [54] "Two CH activation paths are generally recognized: the unimolecular/protolytic mechanism and the bimolecular/carbenium chain mechanism."
          [55] "The unimolecular mechanism involves direct protonation of an alkane-forming carbonium ion intermediate."
          [56] "The proton can be inserted into either a CC or CH bond of the alkane."
          [57] "Proton insertion through the CC bond leads to cracking of the alkane, with the acid site regenerated."
          [58] "Insertion through the HC bond yields H2 and a carbenium ion/alkoxide intermediate."
          [59] "Desorption of alkene from the intermediate regenerates the acid, or the alkoxide can enter the bimolecular conversion path."
          [60] "In the bimolecular mechanism of CH activation, the alkoxide intermediate constitutes the active sites and CH activation occurs through hydride transfer from a second alkane molecule forming another alkoxide."
          [61] "This may be followed by βscission to regenerate the active site and complete the catalytic cycle."
          [62] "For example, activation of propane on acid zeolite based on the two mechanisms is illustrated in Scheme 1."
          [63] "Low reactant partial pressure and high temperature favor unimolecular dehydrogenation of alkane on acid zeolite."
          [64] "These conditions favor the endothermic desorption step (rate limiting step) leading to propene."
          [65] "In contrast, high partial pressure and low temperature favor the bimolecular mechanism leading to a low propene yield."
          [66] "The two molecular mechanisms devoid of side reactions give fairly predictable product distribution."
          [67] "However, the products of each route are prone to side reactions (dimerization, oligomerization, isomerization & aromatisation) in the presence of Bronsted acid sites."
          [68] "Hence propene selectivity on acidic zeolite is very low and products rich in aromatics are usually obtained."
          [69] "The active sites (alkoxide intermediate) of the bimolecular pathway are formed in situ."
          [70] "The alkoxide intermediate is made up of an alkyl carbenium ion ionically held to the zeolite framework oxygen ion."
          [71] "The active sites of the unimolecular pathway are the charge balancing protons of the zeolite framework."
          [72] "A proton and a carbenium ion are an electrophilic or Lewis acid species (a proton can also be considered as a special case of Lewis acidity)."
          [73] "The two pathways essentially involve electrophilic CH activation."
          [74] "The electrophiles (proton and carbenium ion) activate CH at high temperatures (500 C), giving low conversion rates of light alkanes and poor selectivity to corresponding alkenes."
          [75] "Iglesia and co-workers used isotopic labeling studies to demonstrate that CH activation is not the rate-limiting step in the dehydrogenation of propane on H-ZSM-5 and Ga/H-ZSM-5."
          [76] "They proposed that the CH bond cleavage produces an H-adatom and an alkoxide intermediate."
          [77] "Desorption of an alkene from the alkoxide regenerates the proton sites on the zeolites."
          [78] "An alkoxide intermediate may also discharge as a hydrogen rich species through cracking."
          [79] "Iglesia et al. proposed that desorption or disposal of the H-adatom from the CH bond cleavage is the rate-limiting step."
          [80] "A similar deduction was reached by Yu et al."
          [81] "who found that desorption of the alkoxides intermediate is the rate-limiting step under conditions that favor the unimolecular mechanism."
          [82] "The above proposition has been demonstrated on metal (e.g., Ga, Zn, and Co) exchanged zeolites."
          [83] "The specific role of the exchanged metals has been the subject of several reports with special attention on Ga and Zn."
          [84] "Although the framework Ga2O3 on H-MFI seems to have a CH polarization effect on desorbed methane, Ga2O3 exhibits lower CH activation activity."
          [85] "The physical mixture of Ga2O3/HMFI displays higher propane aromatisation activity than pure H-MFI."
          [86] "Similar synergistic effects have been reported for Zn/H-MFI and Co/H-MFI."
          [87] "Exchanged cations behave as monomeric species at the exchange sites of zeolite."
          [88] "Iglesia and Biscardi hypothesized that the monomeric species enhance propane conversion by promoting re-combinative desorption (RD) of the H-adatom formed from the CH cleavage."
          [89] "It is worthwhile noting that the exchange cations (electrophilic species) constitute the CH activation sites."
          [90] "Hence, more insights are required about their additional role in promoting RD."
          [91] "However, the authors did not provide further information on the nature of the H-adatoms and the mechanism of RD."
          [92] "In the next section, we examine the mechanism of desorption of H-adatoms over Ga and Zn exchanged H-ZSM-5."
          [93] "The exchanged metal ions in zeolites are held ionically by one or more basic oxygen atoms."
          [94] "Different species have been suggested, depending on the density of the cation exchange site of the zeolite and method of introduction of the metals."
          [95] "According to Kanansky et al."
          [96] "the exchanged Zn and Ga species on H-ZSM-5 and their mechanism of CH activation are distinctively different."
          [97] "Zn and Ga are introduced on H-ZSM-5 through a vapor deposition technique using Zn metal vapor and Ga(CH3)3 as the source of Zn and Ga, respectively."
          [98] "The metal introduction technique allows quantitative exchange of the zeolite protons which leads to Zn/Al = 0.5 and Ga/Al = 1, respectively."
          [99] "Zn2 + is generated directly, but Ga+ is produced by H2 treatment at 500 C to release the methyl groups."
          [100] "The proposed active sites are OZn2+O and OGa+, respectively."
          [101] "The mechanism of CH activation with ethane by the two sites under the same reaction conditions are summarized in Scheme 2."
          [102] "The proposed mechanism is in agreement with the mechanism suggested from calculations using the GAUSSIAN 94 program for ethane activation on Zn-exchanged zeolite by Frash and van Santen."
          [103] "In another theoretical study using a DFT cluster modeling approach, Pidko and van Santen compared the activation energy of CH with three types of Zn species at active sites: OZn2+O, OZn+OZn+O and HOZn+ O."
          [104] "The authors suggest that the reaction proceeds most easily on OZn2+O, and hypothesize that the enhanced Lewis activity of OZn2+O facilitates CH heterolytic cleavage."
          [105] "They further argue that the first proton abstraction occurs preferentially on the oxygen sites neighboring the ring where the cation is located."
          [106] "They proposed a one-step reaction to yield H2 and C2H4 from the decomposition of the Zn-alkyl and proton."
          [107] "A proposed mechanism of CH activation on OGa+ has similarly been suggested using theoretical calculations."
          [108] "High alkene selectivities are obtained on the H-ZSM-5 when exchangeable protons are rigorously replaced by Zn and Ga."
          [109] "The Zn-exchanged H-ZSM-5 had higher ethane conversion rates but lower ethene selectivity than its Ga counterpart."
          [110] "The CH activation on the OZn2+O site can be described by a Lewis base-assisted deprotonation mechanism."
          [111] "This is accompanied by conversion of the Lewis base site to a conjugate Bronsted acid site."
          [112] "The OGa+ site, however, activates the CH bond via oxidative addition without a protonic site intermediate."
          [113] "A protonic site intermediate increases tendency of side reactions on the Zn-exchanged H-ZSM-5 relative to the Ga counterpart."
          [114] "The elementary steps of CH activation on OGa+ (Scheme 2) reveal that a redox cycle at the metal center is required for catalytic CH activation via the oxidative addition mechanism."
          [115] "A redox cycle is not apparent in the elementary step presented for CH activation on OZn2+O."
          [116] "Hence, a redox cycle is not a requisite for CH activation via the Lewis base-assisted deprotonation mechanism."
          [117] "However, under alkane dehydrogenation reaction conditions, the OZn2+O sites can undergo a reversible Zn2 +/Zn redox process."
          [118] "This redox process increases the availability of undesired protonic site intermediates."
          [119] "Zn-exchanged H-ZSM-5 prepared by conventional ion-exchange methods contain a significant percentage of unexchanged proton sites leading to lower alkene selectivity of the catalyst."
          [120] "Iglesia and Biscardi titrate the proton sites with NaOH."
          [121] "The un-titrated and the titrated catalysts are denoted as Zn/H-ZSMS-5 and Zn/Na-ZSMS-5, respectively."
          [122] "Zn/Na-ZSM-5 has four times the propane conversion rate and a higher propene selectivity than Zn/H-ZSMS-5."
          [123] "The propene formation rate obtained with Zn/Na-ZSM-5 was ten times that of Zn/H-ZSMS-5."
          [124] "The zinc species at the cation exchange site of the zeolite was identified as OZn+OH."
          [125] "The higher propene selectivity obtained on Zn/Na-ZSM-5 compared to Zn/H-ZSMS-5 is presumably from the lower density and availability of proton sites on Zn/Na-ZSM-5."
          [126] "The improved propane conversion rate of Zn/Na-ZSM-5 compared to Zn/H-ZSM-5 is attributable to the higher efficiency of OZn+OH sites in catalyzing desorption of H-adatoms than OZn2+O sites."
          [127] "Another strategy to enhance alkene selectivity is by controlling the strength of the proton sites."
          [128] "The acidity of the sites depends on the nature of the trivalent cation of the zeolite framework."
          [129] "Proton sites in borosilicate zeolites are weaker than those of aluminosilicate, and thus higher alkene selectivity is expected for alkane dehydrogenation over Zn/H[B]-ZSM-5 compared to Zn/H[Al]-ZSM-5."
          [130] "However, Zn/H[B]-ZSM-5 shows no activity for propane dehydrogenation."
          [131] "The desired weaker acidity of the proton sites of Zn/H[B]-ZSM-5 requires weaker basicity of the oxygen atoms in the zeolite framework."
          [132] "This reduced basicity of the oxygen atoms is not sufficiently polarizing to complement the exchanged Zn2 + in CH bond cleavage."
          [133] "In the next section, we examine use of zeolite support to design a Pt-based alkane dehydrogenation catalyst."
          [134] "Elimination of the proton sites of zeolites is critical for obtaining a high alkene selectivity and stability in dehydrogenation catalysts."
          [135] "Pt is the most versatile noble metal catalyst for alkane reactions."
          [136] "Although Pt is expensive, the choice of Pt is often justified by its higher activity, stability and selectivity for these reactions compared to less expensive alternative transition metals."
          [137] "However, rapid catalyst deactivation due to coke formation remains a challenge even when using a Pt-based catalyst for dehydrogenation of light alkanes."
          [138] "Waku et al."
          [139] "exploited the unique property of zeolite as a support for achieving high metal dispersion through cation exchange sites to create a Pt/Na[Fe]-ZSM-5 catalyst with outstanding stability for dehydrogenation of light alkanes."
          [140] "They found that the catalyst deactivation rate of Pt/Na[Fe]-ZSM-5 was lower than for any other Pt-based catalysts in refractory oxide support."
          [141] "The unprecedented performance of Pt/Na[Fe]-ZSM-5 was attributed to its high Pt dispersion (cluster size < 1 mm) on zeolite through ion-exchange."
          [142] "There is a tendency to generate some Brnsted protons on the zeolite during the exchange process, but the choice of Fe3 + as an isomorphous cation in place of Al3 + led to weaker Brnsted sites in [Fe]-ZSM compared to [Al]-ZSM."
          [143] "The weaker acidity minimizes the tendency of side reactions (cracking of oligomerization, aromatisation, and coke), which translates into higher alkene selectivity and catalyst stability."
          [144] "In another report, Xuebing and Iglesia demonstrated the ability of Pt/Na[Fe]-ZSM-5 to dehydrogenate alkanes longer than C4; n-pentane and n-heptane were selectively converted to n-pentene and n-heptene, respectively."
          [145] "Alkene selectivity was also improved when the residual proton generated during Pt exchange or Na-[Fe]-ZSM was titrated with Cs."
          [146] "Although Pt with conventional refractory oxides (Al2O3, SiO2, ZrO2, etc.) used for dehydrogenation of alkanes has similar conversion rates to Pt/Na[Fe]-ZSM-5, deactivation rates are also rapid due to coke formation."
          [147] "The presence of acid (Bronsted and Lewis) sites on the supports promotes readsorption, oligomerization and aromatisation of alkenes."
          [148] "Promotion of Pt with metals, such as Sn, Ga, Zn, Re, etc., improves catalyst stability, but also leads to faster deactivation rates than Pt/Na[Fe]-ZSM-5."
          [149] "However, recent reports by Bell et al."
          [150] "show that the use of calcined hydrotalcite (Al/Mg  0.1) supported on bimetallic PtGa or PtSn gave very high alkene selectivity and stability, comparable to Pt/Na[Fe]-ZSM-5."
          [151] "At this stage, we can conclude that differences in the performance of Zn and Ga exchanged H-ZSM-5 obtained by Kanansky et al."
          [152] "are attributable to their respective CH activation mechanisms."
          [153] "In addition, the role of exchanged Zn and Ga as promoters of RD becomes evident from the mechanisms (Scheme 2)."
          [154] "The RD mechanism on Ga exchanged H-ZSM-5 is by reductive elimination of a hydrogen molecule from O[Ga(H)2]+ intermediate."
          [155] "Decomposition of ZnR and a protonic site, or neutralization of the proton sites by ZnH, leads to desorption of the hydrogen molecule on the Zn-exchanged H-ZSM-5."
          [156] "By extrapolation, the mechanisms of CH activation on exchanged Zn and Ga H-ZSM-5 can described the mechanism of alkane dehydrogenation on Cr-based and Pt-based catalysts respectively."
          [157] "The electronic promotion effect of Sn is in line with the oxidative addition CH activation mechanism."
          [158] "However, the Lewis base-assisted deprotonation mechanism could also explain the proposed CH activation on Cr-based catalysts."
          [159] "Now, the nature and the role of surface oxygen species become more evident."
          [160] "The role of potassium in commercial Cr and Pt-based dehydrogenation catalysts is to minimize the undesired influence of protonic sites on alkene selectivity."
          [161] "The highlights in this section are presented in Table 2."
          [162] "The table reveals the insights achieved on the reaction mechanism, alkene selectivity and catalyst stability for non-oxidative dehydrogenation of lower alkanes."
          [163] "Nonetheless, the level of catalyst activity is still far from acceptable, even at high temperature."
          [164] "A recent report by Rothenberg et al."
          [165] "provides a lead in this respect."
          [166] "Their report indicates that a porous copperaluminum framework material (stabilized by metal oxide) has better performance (activity/selectivity/stability) for propane dehydrogenation than a PtSn/Al2O3."
          [167] "Of particular interest, is the suggestion that achieving propane dehydrogenation at 350 C may be possible."
          [168] "Few details are known about the structure of the porous copperaluminum framework material."
          [169] "However, copper is implicated as providing the active sites for the catalysis."
          [170] "Also, that the material activated in oxygen gave higher propane conversion rates than those activated in inert gas atmosphere underscores the role of the surface oxide (oxygen species) in the catalysis."
          [171] "Thus, the Lewis base-assisted deprotonation mechanism may be invoked here, and the redox property of the metal center is likely to play a role in achieving propane dehydrogenation at 350 C."
          [172] "This should constitute the future research direction for non-oxidative dehydrogenation of lower alkanes."
          [173] "Although the equilibrium conversion of alkanes increases with temperature, alkene selectivity decreases with increasing temperature and chain length due to an increased tendency toward dehydrocyclization/aromatisation, thermal cracking and coke formation."
          [174] "Direct dehydrogenation of lower alkanes is an energy intensive reaction; however, oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) has the potential to lower the energy requirement for achieving dehydrogenation."
          [175] "ODH can be considered as tandem endothermic (dehydrogenation, CnH2n + 2  CnH2n + H2) and exothermic (oxidation, H2 + O2  H2O) processes, with an overall thermodynamic summation, CnH2n + 2 + O2  CnH2n + H2O."
          [176] "Although the process is not thermo-neutral, part of the energy required for the endothermic reaction is augmented by the exothermic reaction."
          [177] "Thus, ODH of alkanes takes place at lower temperature compared to the corresponding non-ODH."
          [178] "This lower temperature requirement of ODH compared to non-ODH and cracking is encouraging and provides motivation for continued efforts to develop ODH into an industrial technology."
          [179] "Although ODH is attractive because of the energy intensification advantage, commercial ODH technologies hinge on innovative catalyst and process design, i.e. proper synergy of the endothermic dehydrogenation step with the exothermic hydrogen combustion and design of selective CH and hydrogen combustion catalysts."
          [180] "In this report, we provide an overview on CH activation and reaction routes to alkane dehydrogenation."
          [181] "We seek to gain insights about components of the active sites of CH activation to provide a platform for rational design of new efficient catalysts for dehydrogenation of lower alkanes."
          [182] "We focus on propane dehydrogenation because of the need for alternative and/or complementary technology for propene production to supplement existing technologies."
          [183] "We survey non-oxidative and oxidative dehydrogenation approaches, and examine reaction routes that are intermediate between these two main approaches."
          [184] "Although the equilibrium conversion of alkanes increases with temperature, alkene selectivity decreases with increasing temperature and chain length due to an increased tendency toward dehydrocyclization/aromatisation, thermal cracking and coke formation."

          [187] "Despite a large number of reports and many reviews covering different aspects of the subject, and more than two decades of investigations on ODH, gaps still exist between laboratory achievements and industrial implementation."

[1] "Although there are other metallic reforming catalysts such as Ru and Rh, which are less strongly prone to coking than Ni,129 Ni is one of the most common reforming catalysts, which is partly due to its significantly cheaper price. In order to overcome the coking problem of Ni catalysts, numerous theoretical studies have been conducted to understand the coke formation on nickel and to come up with potential strategies to avoid the unwanted coking process."
          [2] "It could be shown that the adsorption of C atoms on the closed packed surface of a NiAu surface alloy is thermodynamically less favoured, by 23 kJ mol1 or more, than the analogous process on a pure Ni(111) surface.134 Based on this finding, it has been proposed to alloy Ni with Au.134 A cheaper alternative is to alloy Ni with Sn which hinders the CC bond formation and enhances the CO bond formation leading to the removal of surface C centers as carbon monoxide.135,136 It has been discussed that the Sn atoms separate the Ni centers on the catalyst surface, which tend to bind C atoms, from each other. With the Ni centers being separated, the C atoms on the surface are separated as well, which hinders the formation of coke.135,136 These theoretical results are consistent with experiments which show that pure Ni catalysts deactivate significantly faster than NiSn alloy based catalysts.135 Since the step sites play an essential role in the growth of the graphene islands, as mentioned above, additives such as potassium,66 sulfur,66 gold66 or boron131 have been proposed.66 Computational calculations have shown that these elements tend to occupy the step sites and thus avoid the formation of graphene islands.66,131 A similar strategy, by blocking the crucial sites, has been proposed to prevent the formation of a carbidic phase. Calculations have shown that boron prefers the same sub-surface sites on Ni as C.137 By occupying these sites with B, the diffusion of C to these sub-surface sites and the formation of the thermodynamically more stable carbide phase can be prevented.128 Apart from blocking the sub-surface sites, sub-surface boron in Ni(111) also has been shown to have an destabilizing effect on on-surface C centers,138 which may help to prevent the accumulation of C atoms on the surface."
          [3] "Although supported Pt catalysts show high activity, the catalyst deactivation due to coke formation remains a challenging issue."
          [4] "The robustness against coking can be increased with additional promoters, such as late transition metals, main-group metals including Sn and Ga, alkali-metal oxides and rare-earth metal oxides."
          [5] "It has been demonstrated for graphene islands on the Ni(111) surface, unsaturated C atoms at the edge of a graphene island are less stable than isolated C atoms on the metal surface."
          [6] "A cheaper alternative is to alloy Ni with Sn which hinders the CC bond formation and enhances the CO bond formation leading to the removal of surface C centers as carbon monoxide."
          [7] "Since the step sites play an essential role in the growth of the graphene islands, as mentioned above, additives such as potassium, sulfur, gold or boron have been proposed."
          [8] "Apart from blocking the sub-surface sites, sub-surface boron in Ni(111) also has been shown to have an destabilizing effect on on-surface C centers, which may help to prevent the accumulation of C atoms on the surface."

[1] "A catalyst design consisting of the double-decoration of nanoparticulate intermetallic PtGa with Pb and Ca was applied to produce an ultra-stable catalyst for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) at a high temperature."
          [2] "PtGaCaPb/SiO2 exhibited outstanding catalytic stability in PDH at 600C, and almost no deactivation was observed for up to 1month."
          [3] "Herein, we report a novel catalyst design concept, namely, the double decoration of PtGa intermetallics by Pb and Ca, which synergize the geometric and electronic promotion effects on the catalyst stability, respectively."
          [4] "Pb is deposited on the three-fold Pt3 sites of the PtGa nanoparticles to block them, whereas Ca, which affords an electron-enriched single-atom-like Pt1 site, is placed around the nanoparticles."
          [5] "Thus, PtGaCaPb/SiO2 exhibits an outstandingly high catalytic stability, even at 600C (kd=0.00033h1, τ=3067h), and almost no deactivation of the catalyst was observed for up to 1month for the first time."

[1] "To expose the loaded Pt on the surface of the carriers, ion exchange and impregnation are two simple and practical methods. The dispersion of Pt mainly depends on the precursors of Pt, the preparation conditions, the properties of the carriers, and the interaction between Pt and the carriers, as well as the additives."
          [2] "The addition of a second metal has been found to be highly effective for the sintering resistance of Pt particles. The introduced metal forms alloys with Pt around Pt particles,63 and the alloys anchor them on the surface of the carriers, making them not easy to migrate and coalesce."
          [3] "The application of the carriers possessing a strong interaction with Pt is another way to retard the sintering. Al2O3 is the most common carrier of Pt catalyst, in which the coordinatively unsaturated pentacoordinate Al3+ can anchor Pt to make it not easy to migrate."
          [4] "Nanocarbon was also reported as the carrier of Pt to improve the sintering resistance, and the strong metalcarrier interaction leads to the electron transfer from nanocarbon to the Pt particles, significantly preventing the sintering of Pt."
          [5] "MgAl2O4 spinel is also a good choice as the carrier. Generally, Pt is not directly loaded on MgAl2O4 spinel prepared beforehand, but firstly loaded into the spaces between the layers of MgAlOx hydrotalcite, and then Pt particles are enclosed in the interspace of MgAl2O4 spinel formed through the collapse of the layered structure of the hydrotalcite after calcination at high temperature."
          [6] "Moliner et al.67 reported effective methods to encapsulate Pt in highly siliceous chabazite, and the catalyst showed enhanced stability towards Pt sintering even at 650750 C in the atmospheres of H2, O2 and H2O."
          [7] "The Al2O3 overcoat has also proved to be efficient in preventing the sintering of Pt nanoparticles through atomic layer deposition."
          [8] "Tanabe et al. revealed that no Pt sintering was observed for Pt/MgO as an automotive exhaust catalyst after calcination in air at 900 C, for the formation of a Mg2PtO4-like compound prevents the migration of Pt."
          [9] "Nagai et al. found that CeO2 had a similar effect of MgO in preventing the sintering of Pt due to the formation of the PtOCe bond in the Pt/CeO2 catalyst."
          [10] "Recently, Pt supported on CeO2 has attracted more attention because of the ability of CeO2 to trap Pt in an atomically dispersed state."
          [11] "The atomically dispersed Pt is most likely to be present in the form of Pt2+ bonded to the ubiquitous step edges of the CeO2 surface."
          [12] "The addition of Ga, In, Zn, Cu, Ir, Co to Pt catalysts exhibits similar effects as Sn."
          [13] "Not only that, but Sattler et al.84 showed that in the highly active, selective and stable PtGaK/Al2O3 (0.1 wt% Pt, 3 wt% Ga, 0.25 wt% K) catalyst for the dehydrogenation of propane, the coordinately unsaturated Ga3+ is responsible for activating the CH bond, and Pt only acts as a promoter."
          [14] "Furthermore, just like the PtSn/CeO2 catalyst,29 the reactivity can be fully recovered via simple coke burning in air, although the sintering of Pt still occurs."
          [15] "Located at the same main group with Ga, In was also reported to be the promoter of supported Pt catalysts. The PtIn/Mg(Al)O catalyst prepared at pH 8 using the co-precipitation method exhibits the best catalytic performance and the strongest interaction between the metal phase and the carrier."
          [16] "B and Si, two nonmetal elements, can play similar roles, too. Dehydrogenation of n-butane over the PtB/SiO2 catalyst showed improved catalytic activity and stability compared with Pt/SiO2."
          [17] "Dadras et al.86 called B a magic bullet against sintering and coking, and they summarized the positive roles of B as follows. The non-stoichiometric PtB cluster is anchored to the carrier via a covalent BO bond, which is much stronger than the interaction between Pt clusters and the carrier surface."
          [18] "Additionally, the dissociation energy of a Pt atom from a PtB cluster is significantly larger than that from the pure Pt cluster, increasing the sintering resistance."
          [19] "Finally, the affinity of PtB cluster to C also drops dramatically, leading to the reduced coke formation and increased selectivity to olefins."
          [20] "It is predicted by a computational screening of main-group elements as potential additives for the Pt catalyst that Si, just as B, can modify the selectivity of the Pt catalyst by changing both electronic and geometric properties."

[1] "In this review, we outline the progress of these dehydrogenation catalysts that have been mainly developed in the past five years. For different classes of the most-promising catalysts in the selective dehydrogenation of ethane-to-ethylene and propane-to-propylene, their syntheses, structural information, catalytic properties and mechanisms are comparatively summarized."
          [2] "The synthesis parameters influence the metal particle size for the as-obtained Pt-based catalysts."
          [3] "The synthesis approach can also be applied to tailor the size and phase of bimetallic nanoparticles."
          [4] "The synthesis parameters influence the metal particle size for the as-obtained Pt-based catalysts."
          [5] "The synthesis chemistry contributes to the stabilization effect of Pt through strong PtOCe bonds."
          [6] "The synthesis strategy has been reported for the zeolite-confined Pt single-atom and nanocluter catalysts with high stability."
          [7] "The synthesis procedure can maintain the porous texture and anchor the active Pt-based metals."
          [8] "The synthesis method is used to prepare uniform PtIn bimetal nanoparticles."
          [9] "The synthesis approach is used to prepare the well-defined surface metal species by employing the single-site metal precursors."

          [11] "The synthesis procedure can achieve the formation of the Sn single-site located in the frameworks."
          [12] "The synthesis method allows it to serve as a potent ion-exchanger, resulting in the stabilization of the highly dispersed bimetallic PtZn sites by the ETS-2 support."

[1] "To improve the stability of Pt-based catalysts, many efforts have been dedicated to strengthen metalsupport interactions by using various methods including the nanopore-encaged metal strategy,2124 wet-chemistry approach2529 and modification of supports.10,11,30,31 Among them, modification of supports is a relatively effective and simple method to improve the stability of Pt-based catalysts."
          [2] "For example, Lu et al. reported a PtSn/Al2O3 sheet catalyst for PDH, exhibiting high activity, selectivity and stability.11 It was proposed that the enhanced stability in PDH was associated with γ-Al2O3 nanosheets containing a great deal of pentacoordinate Al3+ ions, which can stabilize PtSn clusters by strong interactions between metals and supports."
          [3] "Recent work by Ma et al. showed that the addition of Ga into Mg(Al)O layer double hydrotalcites could greatly enhance the stability of Pt catalysts in PDH.10 It may be due to the fact that pentacoordinate Ga3+ ions could disperse and stabilize PtSn clusters, thereby enhancing the electronic interactions between Pt and Ga."
          [4] "A similar conclusion regarding the importance of modification of supports has been reported in the case of PtSn/CeO2 catalysts.30"
          [5] "Therefore, this provides a way to tune and enhance the catalytic activity and selectivity for the PDH process, and also introduces unique stability characteristics for bimetallic systems."
          [6] "Herein, highly stable Pt/Sn-Si-beta catalysts for PDH were prepared by an improved post-synthesis strategy, which consists of dealumination of H-beta and subsequent metal impregnation."
          [7] "It is indicated that Sn species existing in tetrahedral coordination states were incorporated into the framework of dealuminated beta (Si-beta)."
          [8] "Meanwhile, Pt species were highly dispersed in the form of ultra-small nanoclusters on Pt/Sn-Si-beta due to the strong interaction between Pt and Sn(IV) sites confined in the Si-beta framework."
          [9] "The prepared Pt/Sn-Si-beta catalysts show excellent catalytic performance for PDH, in which the propene formation rate was 2.3 mol g1Pt h1 with a propene selectivity of >99% at 550 C and the higher propene formation rate was 3.1 mol g1Pt h1 at 600 C."
          [10] "Moreover, the strong PtSn interactions and the confinement effect of Sn in the Si-beta framework inhibit the coke and sintering of Pt clusters, thereby achieving good stability of dehydrogenation and regeneration with almost unchanged catalytic activity during four cycles at 550 C."



[1] "Although the direct dehydrogenation technique has been industrialized, the fabrication of the corresponding catalysts is still confronted with a series of plights."
          [2] "Decades have witnessed the efforts made and strategies proposed by devoted researchers to optimize the catalyst performance and improve the catalytic stability from a wide panorama."
          [3] "In this section, strategies focused on catalytic stability enhancement in recently reported works are summarized."
          [4] "Effectively regulating the active compounds in both Pt-based catalysts and metal oxide-based catalysts can be achieved by soundly introducing promoters."
          [5] "Promoters can greatly impact the catalytic behaviors in PDH catalysts, showing advantages in suppression of side reactions, inhibition of coke deposition, stabilizing active compounds and so on."
          [6] "Metallic Pt has already been recognized as an effective catalyst for alkane dehydrogenation reactions due to its high affinity for paraffinic CH bonds."
          [7] "Currently, adding metal promoters to form alloys or intermetallic compounds is one of the most effective methods to ameliorate central active components and inhibit catalytic deactivation in Pt-based catalytic systems."
          [8] "Sn is a widely utilized promoter for Pt catalysts."
          [9] "The PtGa catalyst system has also been implemented in production plants (FCDh technique)."

          [12] "Many other metals, including Fe, Cu, and Co, can also be promoters for Pt-based catalysts to adjust the electronic properties and improve the dispersion of Pt atoms for further stability enhancement."
          [13] "Alloying of Pt with rare-earth elements (REEs) has barely been accomplished through the conventional H2 reduction route due to the low chemical potential of REE oxides."
          [14] "Supported metal oxide-based catalysts, including CoOx-, ZnOx-, VOx-, and CrOx-based catalysts, are other important PDH catalysts and have been extensively studied for decades."
          [15] "Introducing another metal oxide to form an oxide compound is an effective approach to improve the dispersion of active species and enhance the catalytic stability under the applied conditions, showing advantages in modifying the coordination and electronic state of host metal oxide sites."
          [16] "The introduction of an appropriate metal oxide or noble metal into a catalytic system can greatly enhance the catalytic performance."



[1] "Extensive research efforts have been made to inhibit deactivation and improve propene selectivity of Pt-based catalysts by doping promoters of Sn [9,10], In [11,12], Ga [13,14] and Cu [15] to form bimetallic catalysts."
          [2] "For example, PtIn [16] and PtGa [17,18] bimetallic nanoparticles (NPs) supported on calcined hydrotalcites (HT) show higher activity and selectivity in PDH, which has been attributed to the increased Pt dispersion and electron transfer from In or Ga to Pt [11,18]."
          [3] "Besides promoters, another method is to modify Al2O3 support with ZnO [19], La2O3 [20] or TiO2 [21] or replace Al2O3 support with ZnAl2O4 [22], ZSM-5 [23] or Mg(Al)O oxide [8,24]."
          [4] "Additionally, it has been verified that the single Pt atom sites on Pt-Sn/γ-Al2O3 with a sandwich structure are more favorable for PDH reaction than Pt ensembles [25,26]."
          [5] "Gong et al. [15] also reported that the PtCu single atom alloys can enhance the propane conversion and propene selectivity simultaneously in PDH."
          [6] "Whether as promoters or supports, an important aim of using them is to obtain highly and stably dispersed Pt-based catalysts so that improving PDH performance."
          [7] "However, it is still difficult to break through these challenges for PDH reactions [27], and the exact Pt-M-support relationship is still unclear."
          [8] "Therefore, it is extremely necessary to find more efficient methods to solve the problems mentioned above."
          [9] "In fact, the hierarchical morphology and porous structure play important roles in many heterogeneous catalytic reactions. However, the effect of hierarchical microstructure is seldom reported."
          [10] "Given that the small Pt NPs and hierarchical microstructure may provide more stable and easily accessible active sites for PDH reaction, a promising design for obtaining the desired size of active Pt and hierarchical pore morphology was proposed."
          [11] "The promoted effects of HT reconstruction on the microstructure and morphology of the 3D oxide nanosheet array catalyst, and the subsequently superior PDH performance, were profoundly discussed."

Stable and selective catalysts for propane dehydrogenation operating at thermodynamic limit Hitting the limits on propene synthesis The greater abundance of propane from shale gas has spurred efforts to use it as a propylene feedstock. Direct dehydrogenation catalysts consisting of platinumtin alloy nanoparticles supported on alumina often must run with hydrogen dilution to avoid carbon buildup and excess tin to avoid alloy segregation.
          We report that silica-supported platinum-tin (Pt1Sn1) nanoparticles (&lt;2 nanometers in diameter) can operate as a PDH catalyst at thermodynamically limited conversion levels, with excellent stability and selectivity to propylene (&gt;99%). Atomic mixing of Pt and Sn in the precursor is preserved upon reduction and during catalytic operation. The benign interaction of these nanoparticles with the silicon dioxide support does not lead to Pt-Sn segregation and formation of a tin oxide phase that can occur over traditional catalyst supports.
          To alleviate this issue, large quantities of Sn are used in the catalyst preparation (the nominal atomic loading is Sn:Pt between 4 and 5), which increases the yield of intermetallic PtSn NPs (12). In addition, studies have shown that adding hydrogen to the reactant feed reduces the rate of catalyst deactivation (13). Although this strategy is implemented commercially (10), addition of hydrogen in the feed lowers the thermodynamic limit on per-pass propane conversion (fig. S1) and decreases productivity (7).
          We developed a PDH catalyst that operates at thermodynamically limited conversion levels without the addition of hydrogen to the feed and exhibits excellent stability and selectivity to propylene (&gt;99%). The catalyst is composed of silica-supported Pt1Sn1 NPs, synthesized and pretreated to ensure that the mixing of Pt and Sn is preserved during catalytic operation.
          The principle behind catalyst synthesis is to begin with a heterometallic Pt-Sn coordination complex in which Pt and Sn are in immediate contact, and this interaction is retained during the reduction and PDH reaction.
          The data in Fig. 1, A to C, were obtained with 16 vol % propane in helium. Propane streams are diluted in commercial operations to increase the limiting equilibrium conversion, which is higher at lower propane partial pressure (fig. S2), and to limit catalyst deactivation rates (7, 16, 17). This approach requires additional downstream separation units and limits process efficiency.
          The data in Fig. 1, A to C, show the performance of the Pt1Sn1/SiO2 catalyst (1 wt % Pt and 0.6 wt % Sn) for propane dehydrogenation at 580C, 16 vol % propane (with the remainder helium) and at a weight hourly space velocity (WHSV) of 4.7 hours1. Under these reaction conditions, the thermodynamic limit on propane conversion is 66.5% (fig. S2). The Pt1Sn1/SiO2 catalyst showed near-thermodynamic conversion of &gt;66% (Fig. 1A, red circles) and &gt;99% selectivity to propylene (Fig. 1B, red circles).
          The data in Fig. 1D show that, under these conditions, the propane conversion goes from 41 to 39% in 120 min. Under identical conditions, the other tested catalysts deactivate very rapidly to very low conversion, as illustrated for the commercial mimic. A transmission electron microscopy (TEM) image of the spent catalyst, after 120 min of PDH reaction, is shown in fig. S6. The image shows that the Pt-Sn NPs are well dispersed, with an average particle diameter of 1.6  0.67 nm, which is consistent with the particle size in fresh samples.
          We attempted to regenerate the Pt1Sn1/SiO2 catalyst by oxidation, using 1% O2 as a mild oxidant at 500C followed by reduction at 600C (see supplementary materials for details of the regeneration procedure). The regeneration studies showed that Pt1Sn1/SiO2 catalysts can be partially regenerated. For example, we measured 97% of the initial activity and &gt;99% of the initial selectivity after three PDH/regeneration cycles (fig. S5).
          Data in Fig. 3A show that the process of mixing chloroplatinic acid (H2PtCl6) and tin(II) chloride (SnCl2) in 0.1 M hydrochloric acid solution formed a heterometallic Pt-Sn coordination complex.
          A bright-field TEM image of Pt-Sn NPs formed on SiO2 upon the reduction of the Pt-Sn complex shows high metal dispersion on the support, with an average NP size of 1.3  0.6 nm (Fig. 3B). The NP size distribution (Fig. 3C) shows that most NPs were &lt;2 nm. The XRD spectra in Fig. 3D show that the formed NPs were essentially alloys of Pt and Sn. This finding is supported by the presence of the XRD peaks corresponding to Pt1Sn1 (41.8 and 44.1) and Pt3Sn1 (39.0 and 45.3) stoichiometries.
          The real-space Pt LIII EXAFS spectra for the Pt1Sn1/SiO2 catalyst (Fig. 4D) are substantially different from the spectra of monometallic Pt and indicate the mixing of Pt and Sn atoms. The best-fit spectrum for the Pt1Sn1/SiO2 catalyst is characterized by the presence of the Pt-Pt and Pt-Sn scattering paths, consistent with the formation of PtSn intermetallic phases.

          [2] "Herein, a series of highly ordered mesoporous Al2O3 supports with different levels of Al3+penta sites, are fabricated and used as the support to disperse Pt-Sn2 clusters."
          [3] "The stability and regenerability of Pt-Sn2/meso-Al2O3 are strongly dependent on the content of Al3+penta sites in the Al2O3 structure, and a high level of Al3+penta sites can effectively prevent the agglomeration of Pt-Sn2 clusters into large Pt nanoparticles in the consecutive dehydrogenation-regeneration cycles."



[1] "Rare-earthplatinum alloy nanoparticles in mesoporous zeolite for catalysis Platinum is a much used catalyst that, in petrochemical processes, is often alloyed with other metals to improve catalytic activity, selectivity and longevity1,2,3,4,5."
          [2] "Such catalysts are usually prepared in the form of metallic nanoparticles supported on porous solids, and their production involves reducing metal precursor compounds under a H2 flow at high temperatures6."
          [3] "The method works well when using easily reducible late transition metals, but Pt alloy formation with rare-earth elements through the H2 reduction route is almost impossible owing to the low chemical potential of rare-earth element oxides6."
          [4] "Here we use as support a mesoporous zeolite that has pore walls with surface framework defects (called silanol nests) and show that the zeolite enables alloy formation between Pt and rare-earth elements."
          [5] "We find that the silanol nests enable the rare-earth elements to exist as single atomic species with a substantially higher chemical potential compared with that of the bulk oxide, making it possible for them to diffuse onto Pt."
          [6] "High-resolution transmission electron microscopy and hydrogen chemisorption measurements indicate that the resultant bimetallic nanoparticles supported on the mesoporous zeolite are intermetallic compounds, which we find to be stable, highly active and selective catalysts for the propane dehydrogenation reaction."
          [7] "When used with late transition metals, the same preparation strategy produces Pt alloy catalysts that incorporate an unusually large amount of the second metal and, in the case of the PtCo alloy, show high catalytic activity and selectivity in the preferential oxidation of carbon monoxide in H2."
          [8] "The industrial PDH process has been using PtSn bimetallic catalysts supported on porous alumina for nearly three decades, since its discovery in the early 1990s3,7."
          [9] "The Pt metal alone exhibits high initial catalytic activity, but rapidly deactivates as a result of coke deposition on the Pt surface."
          [10] "The coke deposition also causes an undesirable loss of the catalytic selectivity to propylene."
          [11] "To alleviate these problems, Sn is introduced to form an alloy with Pt nanoparticles and thereby dilute the Pt surface with inactive Sn atoms and break up coke-generating Pt ensembles."
          [12] "Our search for a highly active and more durable PDH catalyst has focused on using a siliceous MFI zeolite with a hierarchical micro-/mesoporous structure as a replacement for the alumina support."
          [13] "This zeolite, synthesized using a multi-ammonium surfactant as a structure-directing agent, has attracted attention as an advanced catalyst support8,9,10,11,12,13 owing to its unique structure, which comprises ultrathin zeolite frameworks and three-dimensionally interconnected mesopores that boost the catalytic performance of supported metals by providing both facile reactant and product diffusion and high metal nanoparticle dispersion within the mesopores12,13."
          [14] "The formation of the Pt3La and Pt3Y nanoparticles on the degallated zeolite brought a striking enhancement in all aspects of the PDH catalytic performance, including activity, selectivity and durability, as shown in Fig. 2."
          [15] "The catalytic reaction was performed at 580C using a pure propane flow at a large space velocity (see Methods), and these harsh operating conditions caused even the conventional PtSn/alumina catalyst to experience severe coke formation and catalyst deactivation within 1 d."
          [16] "In sharp contrast, the Pt3La intermetallic nanoparticles supported on the degallated zeolite (denoted as PtLa/mz-deGa, where mz stands for mesoporous zeolite) showed a high initial propane conversion of 40% (close to the equilibrium conversion) and underwent extremely slow deactivation, retaining 8% conversion even after 30 days of reaction."
          [17] "The PtREE incorporation in the mesoporous zeolite was conducted by co-impregnation of aqueous solutions of Pt(NH3)4(NO3)2 and either La(NO3)3·6H2O or Y(NO3)3·6H2O, followed by heating under an O2 flow at 350C and subsequently under H2 at 700C (see Methods)."
          [18] "The formation of the Pt3La and Pt3Y nanoparticles on the degallated zeolite brought a striking enhancement in all aspects of the PDH catalytic performance, including activity, selectivity and durability, as shown in Fig. 2."

[1] "Although the equilibrium conversion of alkanes increases with temperature, alkene selectivity decreases with increasing temperature and chain length due to an increased tendency toward dehydrocyclization/aromatisation, thermal cracking and coke formation."
          [2] "Direct dehydrogenation of lower alkanes is an energy intensive reaction; however, oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) has the potential to lower the energy requirement for achieving dehydrogenation."
          [3] "ODH can be considered as tandem endothermic (dehydrogenation, CnH2n + 2  CnH2n + H2) and exothermic (oxidation, H2 + O2  H2O) processes, with an overall thermodynamic summation, CnH2n + 2 + O2  CnH2n + H2O."
          [4] "Although the process is not thermo-neutral, part of the energy required for the endothermic reaction is augmented by the exothermic reaction."
          [5] "Thus, ODH of alkanes takes place at lower temperature compared to the corresponding non-ODH."
          [6] "This lower temperature requirement of ODH compared to non-ODH and cracking is encouraging and provides motivation for continued efforts to develop ODH into an industrial technology."
          [7] "Although ODH is attractive because of the energy intensification advantage, commercial ODH technologies hinge on innovative catalyst and process design, i.e. proper synergy of the endothermic dehydrogenation step with the exothermic hydrogen combustion and design of selective CH and hydrogen combustion catalysts."

          [12] "Catalyst improvement endeavors can benefit from insights on alkane CH bond activation mechanisms."
          [13] "Developing direct routes to obtain key organic chemicals from lower alkanes would benefit industry."
          [14] "Lower alkanes are relatively inert, and they exhibit little or no reactivity at conditions typical for activating functional group reactions in organic compounds because they lack low-lying vacant orbitals or lone pair electrons."
          [15] "Alkanes are made up non-polar CC and CH bonds. These bonds consist of strongly localised electron pairs that are usually induced to reactivity under severe conditions (e.g., at high temperature or pressure, or with the use of aggressive reagents)."
          [16] "The first and rate-limiting step of alkane dehydrogenation using platinum or chromium oxide-based catalysts involves CH activation."
          [17] "Although a number of efforts have been made to gain insight on the mechanism of the reaction, questions still remain, especially regarding the pathway of the CH activation."
          [18] "It is of fundamental and applied interest to know whether the first CH bond cleavage is homolytic or heterolytic."
          [19] "If it is a heterolytic pathway, it will further be of interest to know whether the first hydrogen from the alkane substrate is abstracted as a proton or as a hydride ion."
          [20] "This knowledge will benefit catalyst improvement efforts."
          [21] "The simple impregnation techniques for preparing supported (especially alumina) metal and oxide catalysts becloud their structural heterogeneity."

          [25] "Although several solid acid catalysts are used in alkane conversions, zeolites have the advantage of possessing a well-defined structure, allowing the structure-activity relationship to be easily deduced."
          [26] "Therefore, it is instructive to examine non-oxidative dehydrogenation of light alkanes over zeolite catalysts."
          [27] "A detailed knowledge of the adsorption mechanism of lower alkane molecules on zeolite is of interest in this context, especially for informed tuning of zeolite properties to allow efficient and selective dehydrogenation of alkanes."
          [28] "Light alkanes are adsorbed on zeolites via dispersive interaction."
          [29] "Protons and the exchanged metals ions are typically the active sites in zeolites, while the zeolite framework plays the role of anchor for the active sites and/or dispersion medium for the reactants."
          [30] "The framework of microporous zeolites exerts dispersive forces on the reactant's molecules that depend on the shape, channel and cavity of the framework."
          [31] "In addition, the nature and the density of the active sites influence the framework dispersion forces."
          [32] "Recent reports have shown that the strong electrostatic field between protons or exchanged metal ions and basic oxygen species can enhance and/or induce polarization of bonds in hydrocarbon adsorbates."
          [33] "This agrees with Hashiguchi et al., who found enhanced activation of the CH bond on a homogeneous catalyst."
          [34] "Wender et al. showed that 3040% of heat adsorption in n-alkanes on Na-zeolite is due to polarization of the adsorbates."
          [35] "Subbotina et al. also demonstrated that the CH bond of ethane is more strongly polarized on Mg2 + and Ca2 + forms of Y zeolite than on Na+ forms."
          [36] "Mg2 +-Y zeolite molecules exhibit weaker adsorption and polarization of ethane than Ca2 +-zeolites."
          [37] "Based on charge density considerations, Mg2 + cations are expected to exhibit a stronger polarizing effect than Ca2 + cations."
          [38] "Subbotina et al. explain that because of the smaller ionic radius of Mg2 +, it is more strongly shielded by the surrounding oxygen atoms of the zeolite lattice than a Ca2 + ion, thereby reducing the polarizing effect of Mg2 + on the hydrocarbon adsorbate."
          [39] "Sievers et al. also report that the La3 + form of X zeolite induces strong polarization of adsorbed alkane molecules; partial positive charges were induced on secondary and tertiary carbon atoms of alkane molecules."
          [40] "The authors suggest that the polarization may be viewed as an intermediate condition to hydride abstraction (which is an important elementary step in CH activation)."
          [41] "They add that CH bond polarization was enhanced by physisorbed water molecules that coordinate with La3 + cations."
          [42] "The enhanced polarization of CH bonds by the presence of water molecules on La3 +X zeolite may have a beneficial effect in oxidative dehydrogenation where water is a by-product."
          [43] "Alkane polarization studies on Na+, Mg2 +, Ca2 +, and La3 + exchanged X-zeolites indicate that the polarizing effect increases with increasing charge magnitude and ionic radius."
          [44] "Note that these alkane polarizing cations occupy the same position on the zeolites as the well-known CH activation cations/metals, and thus the CH polarizing effect has a complementary effect on CH activation."
          [45] "This may add to the number of relevant variables and increase the challenge of optimizing the ratio of activation/polarizing cations among exchangeable sites (Si/Al ratio), as well as the sequence for incorporating the cations or metals during catalyst preparation."
          [46] "Further, it is important to note that the choice of cations should be such that they exhibit no catalytic (oligomerization, isomerization, aromatisation or oxidation) effects on the target alkene products at the reaction condition."
          [47] "Furthermore, it may be beneficial to create a CH polarization effect on the zeolite framework."
          [48] "This can be achieved by appropriate chance of framework atoms."
          [49] "Since active sites are usually created on the zeolite frameworks."
          [50] "The activation of CH bonds of light alkanes occurs readily on super electrophiles (super Brnsted and super Lewis acid) at low temperatures."
          [51] "Although CH activation on zeolites have been observed at low temperatures, industrial alkane reactions on zeolites are usually carried out at high temperatures."
          [52] "Several experimental and theoretical studies on the molecular dynamics of light alkanes on zeolite have been published."
          [53] "However, despite the decades of intensive investigations on the subject, the actual mechanism of CH activation on acid zeolite is still debated."
          [54] "Two CH activation paths are generally recognized: the unimolecular/protolytic mechanism and the bimolecular/carbenium chain mechanism."
          [55] "The unimolecular mechanism involves direct protonation of an alkane-forming carbonium ion intermediate."
          [56] "The proton can be inserted into either a CC or CH bond of the alkane."
          [57] "Proton insertion through the CC bond leads to cracking of the alkane, with the acid site regenerated."
          [58] "Insertion through the HC bond yields H2 and a carbenium ion/alkoxide intermediate."
          [59] "Desorption of alkene from the intermediate regenerates the acid, or the alkoxide can enter the bimolecular conversion path."
          [60] "In the bimolecular mechanism of CH activation, the alkoxide intermediate constitutes the active sites and CH activation occurs through hydride transfer from a second alkane molecule forming another alkoxide."
          [61] "This may be followed by βscission to regenerate the active site and complete the catalytic cycle."
          [62] "For example, activation of propane on acid zeolite based on the two mechanisms is illustrated in Scheme 1."
          [63] "Low reactant partial pressure and high temperature favor unimolecular dehydrogenation of alkane on acid zeolite."
          [64] "These conditions favor the endothermic desorption step (rate limiting step) leading to propene."
          [65] "In contrast, high partial pressure and low temperature favor the bimolecular mechanism leading to a low propene yield."
          [66] "The two molecular mechanisms devoid of side reactions give fairly predictable product distribution."
          [67] "However, the products of each route are prone to side reactions (dimerization, oligomerization, isomerization & aromatisation) in the presence of Bronsted acid sites."
          [68] "Hence propene selectivity on acidic zeolite is very low and products rich in aromatics are usually obtained."
          [69] "The active sites (alkoxide intermediate) of the bimolecular pathway are formed in situ."
          [70] "The alkoxide intermediate is made up of an alkyl carbenium ion ionically held to the zeolite framework oxygen ion."
          [71] "The active sites of the unimolecular pathway are the charge balancing protons of the zeolite framework."
          [72] "A proton and a carbenium ion are an electrophilic or Lewis acid species (a proton can also be considered as a special case of Lewis acidity)."
          [73] "The two pathways essentially involve electrophilic CH activation."
          [74] "The electrophiles (proton and carbenium ion) activate CH at high temperatures (500 C), giving low conversion rates of light alkanes and poor selectivity to corresponding alkenes."
          [75] "Iglesia and co-workers used isotopic labeling studies to demonstrate that CH activation is not the rate-limiting step in the dehydrogenation of propane on H-ZSM-5 and Ga/H-ZSM-5."
          [76] "They proposed that the CH bond cleavage produces an H-adatom and an alkoxide intermediate."
          [77] "Desorption of an alkene from the alkoxide regenerates the proton sites on the zeolites."
          [78] "An alkoxide intermediate may also discharge as a hydrogen rich species through cracking."
          [79] "Iglesia et al. proposed that desorption or disposal of the H-adatom from the CH bond cleavage is the rate-limiting step."
          [80] "A similar deduction was reached by Yu et al."
          [81] "who found that desorption of the alkoxides intermediate is the rate-limiting step under conditions that favor the unimolecular mechanism."
          [82] "The above proposition has been demonstrated on metal (e.g., Ga, Zn, and Co) exchanged zeolites."
          [83] "The specific role of the exchanged metals has been the subject of several reports with special attention on Ga and Zn."
          [84] "Although the framework Ga2O3 on H-MFI seems to have a CH polarization effect on desorbed methane, Ga2O3 exhibits lower CH activation activity."
          [85] "The physical mixture of Ga2O3/HMFI displays higher propane aromatisation activity than pure H-MFI."
          [86] "Similar synergistic effects have been reported for Zn/H-MFI and Co/H-MFI."
          [87] "Exchanged cations behave as monomeric species at the exchange sites of zeolite."
          [88] "Iglesia and Biscardi hypothesized that the monomeric species enhance propane conversion by promoting re-combinative desorption (RD) of the H-adatom formed from the CH cleavage."
          [89] "It is worthwhile noting that the exchange cations (electrophilic species) constitute the CH activation sites."
          [90] "Hence, more insights are required about their additional role in promoting RD."
          [91] "However, the authors did not provide further information on the nature of the H-adatoms and the mechanism of RD."
          [92] "In the next section, we examine the mechanism of desorption of H-adatoms over Ga and Zn exchanged H-ZSM-5."
          [93] "The exchanged metal ions in zeolites are held ionically by one or more basic oxygen atoms."
          [94] "Different species have been suggested, depending on the density of the cation exchange site of the zeolite and method of introduction of the metals."
          [95] "According to Kanansky et al."
          [96] "the exchanged Zn and Ga species on H-ZSM-5 and their mechanism of CH activation are distinctively different."
          [97] "Zn and Ga are introduced on H-ZSM-5 through a vapor deposition technique using Zn metal vapor and Ga(CH3)3 as the source of Zn and Ga, respectively."
          [98] "The metal introduction technique allows quantitative exchange of the zeolite protons which leads to Zn/Al = 0.5 and Ga/Al = 1, respectively."
          [99] "Zn2 + is generated directly, but Ga+ is produced by H2 treatment at 500 C to release the methyl groups."

          [101] "The mechanism of CH activation with ethane by the two sites under the same reaction conditions are summarized in Scheme 2."
          [102] "The proposed mechanism is in agreement with the mechanism suggested from calculations using the GAUSSIAN 94 program for ethane activation on Zn-exchanged zeolite by Frash and van Santen."
          [103] "In another theoretical study using a DFT cluster modeling approach, Pidko and van Santen compared the activation energy of CH with three types of Zn species at active sites: OZn2+O, OZn+OZn+O and HOZn+ O."
          [104] "The authors suggest that the reaction proceeds most easily on OZn2+O, and hypothesize that the enhanced Lewis activity of OZn2+O facilitates CH heterolytic cleavage."
          [105] "They further argue that the first proton abstraction occurs preferentially on the oxygen sites neighboring the ring where the cation is located."
          [106] "They proposed a one-step reaction to yield H2 and C2H4 from the decomposition of the Zn-alkyl and proton."
          [107] "A proposed mechanism of CH activation on OGa+ has similarly been suggested using theoretical calculations."
          [108] "High alkene selectivities are obtained on the H-ZSM-5 when exchangeable protons are rigorously replaced by Zn and Ga."
          [109] "The Zn-exchanged H-ZSM-5 had higher ethane conversion rates but lower ethene selectivity than its Ga counterpart."
          [110] "The CH activation on the OZn2+O site can be described by a Lewis base-assisted deprotonation mechanism."
          [111] "This is accompanied by conversion of the Lewis base site to a conjugate Bronsted acid site."
          [112] "The OGa+ site, however, activates the CH bond via oxidative addition without a protonic site intermediate."
          [113] "A protonic site intermediate increases tendency of side reactions on the Zn-exchanged H-ZSM-5 relative to the Ga counterpart."
          [114] "The elementary steps of CH activation on OGa+ (Scheme 2) reveal that a redox cycle at the metal center is required for catalytic CH activation via the oxidative addition mechanism."
          [115] "A redox cycle is not apparent in the elementary step presented for CH activation on OZn2+O."
          [116] "Hence, a redox cycle is not a requisite for CH activation via the Lewis base-assisted deprotonation mechanism."
          [117] "However, under alkane dehydrogenation reaction conditions, the OZn2+O sites can undergo a reversible Zn2 +/Zn redox process."
          [118] "This redox process increases the availability of undesired protonic site intermediates."
          [119] "Zn-exchanged H-ZSM-5 prepared by conventional ion-exchange methods contain a significant percentage of unexchanged proton sites leading to lower alkene selectivity of the catalyst."
          [120] "Iglesia and Biscardi titrate the proton sites with NaOH."
          [121] "The un-titrated and the titrated catalysts are denoted as Zn/H-ZSMS-5 and Zn/Na-ZSMS-5, respectively."
          [122] "Zn/Na-ZSM-5 has four times the propane conversion rate and a higher propene selectivity than Zn/H-ZSMS-5."
          [123] "The propene formation rate obtained with Zn/Na-ZSM-5 was ten times that of Zn/H-ZSMS-5."
          [124] "The zinc species at the cation exchange site of the zeolite was identified as OZn+OH."
          [125] "The higher propene selectivity obtained on Zn/Na-ZSM-5 compared to Zn/H-ZSMS-5 is presumably from the lower density and availability of proton sites on Zn/Na-ZSM-5."
          [126] "The improved propane conversion rate of Zn/Na-ZSM-5 compared to Zn/H-ZSM-5 is attributable to the higher efficiency of OZn+OH sites in catalyzing desorption of H-adatoms than OZn2+O sites."
          [127] "Another strategy to enhance alkene selectivity is by controlling the strength of the proton sites."
          [128] "The acidity of the sites depends on the nature of the trivalent cation of the zeolite framework."
          [129] "Proton sites in borosilicate zeolites are weaker than those of aluminosilicate, and thus higher alkene selectivity is expected for alkane dehydrogenation over Zn/H[B]-ZSM-5 compared to Zn/H[Al]-ZSM-5."
          [130] "However, Zn/H[B]-ZSM-5 shows no activity for propane dehydrogenation."
          [131] "The desired weaker acidity of the proton sites of Zn/H[B]-ZSM-5 requires weaker basicity of the oxygen atoms in the zeolite framework."
          [132] "This reduced basicity of the oxygen atoms is not sufficiently polarizing to complement the exchanged Zn2 + in CH bond cleavage."
          [133] "In the next section, we examine use of zeolite support to design a Pt-based alkane dehydrogenation catalyst."
          [134] "Elimination of the proton sites of zeolites is critical for obtaining a high alkene selectivity and stability in dehydrogenation catalysts."
          [135] "Pt is the most versatile noble metal catalyst for alkane reactions."
          [136] "Although Pt is expensive, the choice of Pt is often justified by its higher activity, stability and selectivity for these reactions compared to less expensive alternative transition metals."
          [137] "However, rapid catalyst deactivation due to coke formation remains a challenge even when using a Pt-based catalyst for dehydrogenation of light alkanes."
          [138] "Waku et al."
          [139] "exploited the unique property of zeolite as a support for achieving high metal dispersion through cation exchange sites to create a Pt/Na[Fe]-ZSM-5 catalyst with outstanding stability for dehydrogenation of light alkanes."
          [140] "They found that the catalyst deactivation rate of Pt/Na[Fe]-ZSM-5 was lower than for any other Pt-based catalysts in refractory oxide support."
          [141] "The unprecedented performance of Pt/Na[Fe]-ZSM-5 was attributed to its high Pt dispersion (cluster size < 1 mm) on zeolite through ion-exchange."
          [142] "There is a tendency to generate some Brnsted protons on the zeolite during the exchange process, but the choice of Fe3 + as an isomorphous cation in place of Al3 + led to weaker Brnsted sites in [Fe]-ZSM compared to [Al]-ZSM."
          [143] "The weaker acidity minimizes the tendency of side reactions (cracking of oligomerization, aromatisation, and coke), which translates into higher alkene selectivity and catalyst stability."
          [144] "In another report, Xuebing and Iglesia demonstrated the ability of Pt/Na[Fe]-ZSM-5 to dehydrogenate alkanes longer than C4; n-pentane and n-heptane were selectively converted to n-pentene and n-heptene, respectively."
          [145] "Alkene selectivity was also improved when the residual proton generated during Pt exchange or Na-[Fe]-ZSM was titrated with Cs."
          [146] "Although Pt with conventional refractory oxides (Al2O3, SiO2, ZrO2, etc.) used for dehydrogenation of alkanes has similar conversion rates to Pt/Na[Fe]-ZSM-5, deactivation rates are also rapid due to coke formation."
          [147] "The presence of acid (Bronsted and Lewis) sites on the supports promotes readsorption, oligomerization and aromatisation of alkenes."
          [148] "Promotion of Pt with metals, such as Sn, Ga, Zn, Re, etc., improves catalyst stability, but also leads to faster deactivation rates than Pt/Na[Fe]-ZSM-5."
          [149] "However, recent reports by Bell et al."
          [150] "show that the use of calcined hydrotalcite (Al/Mg  0.1) supported on bimetallic PtGa or PtSn gave very high alkene selectivity and stability, comparable to Pt/Na[Fe]-ZSM-5."
          [151] "At this stage, we can conclude that differences in the performance of Zn and Ga exchanged H-ZSM-5 obtained by Kanansky et al."
          [152] "are attributable to their respective CH activation mechanisms."
          [153] "In addition, the role of exchanged Zn and Ga as promoters of RD becomes evident from the mechanisms (Scheme 2)."
          [154] "The RD mechanism on Ga exchanged H-ZSM-5 is by reductive elimination of a hydrogen molecule from O[Ga(H)2]+ intermediate."
          [155] "Decomposition of ZnR and a protonic site, or neutralization of the proton sites by ZnH, leads to desorption of the hydrogen molecule on the Zn-exchanged H-ZSM-5."
          [156] "By extrapolation, the mechanisms of CH activation on exchanged Zn and Ga H-ZSM-5 can described the mechanism of alkane dehydrogenation on Cr-based and Pt-based catalysts respectively."
          [157] "The electronic promotion effect of Sn is in line with the oxidative addition CH activation mechanism."
          [158] "However, the Lewis base-assisted deprotonation mechanism could also explain the proposed CH activation on Cr-based catalysts."
          [159] "Now, the nature and the role of surface oxygen species become more evident."
          [160] "The role of potassium in commercial Cr and Pt-based dehydrogenation catalysts is to minimize the undesired influence of protonic sites on alkene selectivity."
          [161] "The highlights in this section are presented in Table 2."
          [162] "The table reveals the insights achieved on the reaction mechanism, alkene selectivity and catalyst stability for non-oxidative dehydrogenation of lower alkanes."
          [163] "Nonetheless, the level of catalyst activity is still far from acceptable, even at high temperature."
          [164] "A recent report by Rothenberg et al."
          [165] "provides a lead in this respect."
          [166] "Their report indicates that a porous copperaluminum framework material (stabilized by metal oxide) has better performance (activity/selectivity/stability) for propane dehydrogenation than a PtSn/Al2O3."
          [167] "Of particular interest, is the suggestion that achieving propane dehydrogenation at 350 C may be possible."
          [168] "Few details are known about the structure of the porous copperaluminum framework material."
          [169] "However, copper is implicated as providing the active sites for the catalysis."
          [170] "Also, that the material activated in oxygen gave higher propane conversion rates than those activated in inert gas atmosphere underscores the role of the surface oxide (oxygen species) in the catalysis."
          [171] "Thus, the Lewis base-assisted deprotonation mechanism may be invoked here, and the redox property of the metal center is likely to play a role in achieving propane dehydrogenation at 350 C."
          [172] "This should constitute the future research direction for non-oxidative dehydrogenation of lower alkanes."
          [173] "Although the equilibrium conversion of alkanes increases with temperature, alkene selectivity decreases with increasing temperature and chain length due to an increased tendency toward dehydrocyclization/aromatisation, thermal cracking and coke formation."
          [174] "Direct dehydrogenation of lower alkanes is an energy intensive reaction; however, oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) has the potential to lower the energy requirement for achieving dehydrogenation."
          [175] "ODH can be considered as tandem endothermic (dehydrogenation, CnH2n + 2  CnH2n + H2) and exothermic (oxidation, H2 + O2  H2O) processes, with an overall thermodynamic summation, CnH2n + 2 + O2  CnH2n + H2O."
          [176] "Although the process is not thermo-neutral, part of the energy required for the endothermic reaction is augmented by the exothermic reaction."
          [177] "Thus, ODH of alkanes takes place at lower temperature compared to the corresponding non-ODH."
          [178] "This lower temperature requirement of ODH compared to non-ODH and cracking is encouraging and provides motivation for continued efforts to develop ODH into an industrial technology."
          [179] "Although ODH is attractive because of the energy intensification advantage, commercial ODH technologies hinge on innovative catalyst and process design, i.e. proper synergy of the endothermic dehydrogenation step with the exothermic hydrogen combustion and design of selective CH and hydrogen combustion catalysts."
          [180] "In this report, we provide an overview on CH activation and reaction routes to alkane dehydrogenation."
          [181] "We seek to gain insights about components of the active sites of CH activation to provide a platform for rational design of new efficient catalysts for dehydrogenation of lower alkanes."
          [182] "We focus on propane dehydrogenation because of the need for alternative and/or complementary technology for propene production to supplement existing technologies."
          [183] "We survey non-oxidative and oxidative dehydrogenation approaches, and examine reaction routes that are intermediate between these two main approaches."
          [184] "Although the equilibrium conversion of alkanes increases with temperature, alkene selectivity decreases with increasing temperature and chain length due to an increased tendency toward dehydrocyclization/aromatisation, thermal cracking and coke formation."

          [187] "Despite a large number of reports and many reviews covering different aspects of the subject, and more than two decades of investigations on ODH, gaps still exist between laboratory achievements and industrial implementation."

[1] "Although there are other metallic reforming catalysts such as Ru and Rh, which are less strongly prone to coking than Ni,129 Ni is one of the most common reforming catalysts, which is partly due to its significantly cheaper price. In order to overcome the coking problem of Ni catalysts, numerous theoretical studies have been conducted to understand the coke formation on nickel and to come up with potential strategies to avoid the unwanted coking process."
          [2] "It could be shown that the adsorption of C atoms on the closed packed surface of a NiAu surface alloy is thermodynamically less favoured, by 23 kJ mol1 or more, than the analogous process on a pure Ni(111) surface.134 Based on this finding, it has been proposed to alloy Ni with Au.134 A cheaper alternative is to alloy Ni with Sn which hinders the CC bond formation and enhances the CO bond formation leading to the removal of surface C centers as carbon monoxide.135,136 It has been discussed that the Sn atoms separate the Ni centers on the catalyst surface, which tend to bind C atoms, from each other. With the Ni centers being separated, the C atoms on the surface are separated as well, which hinders the formation of coke.135,136 These theoretical results are consistent with experiments which show that pure Ni catalysts deactivate significantly faster than NiSn alloy based catalysts.135 Since the step sites play an essential role in the growth of the graphene islands, as mentioned above, additives such as potassium,66 sulfur,66 gold66 or boron131 have been proposed.66 Computational calculations have shown that these elements tend to occupy the step sites and thus avoid the formation of graphene islands.66,131 A similar strategy, by blocking the crucial sites, has been proposed to prevent the formation of a carbidic phase. Calculations have shown that boron prefers the same sub-surface sites on Ni as C.137 By occupying these sites with B, the diffusion of C to these sub-surface sites and the formation of the thermodynamically more stable carbide phase can be prevented.128 Apart from blocking the sub-surface sites, sub-surface boron in Ni(111) also has been shown to have an destabilizing effect on on-surface C centers,138 which may help to prevent the accumulation of C atoms on the surface."
          [3] "Although supported Pt catalysts show high activity, the catalyst deactivation due to coke formation remains a challenging issue."
          [4] "The robustness against coking can be increased with additional promoters, such as late transition metals, main-group metals including Sn and Ga, alkali-metal oxides and rare-earth metal oxides."
          [5] "It has been demonstrated for graphene islands on the Ni(111) surface, unsaturated C atoms at the edge of a graphene island are less stable than isolated C atoms on the metal surface."
          [6] "A cheaper alternative is to alloy Ni with Sn which hinders the CC bond formation and enhances the CO bond formation leading to the removal of surface C centers as carbon monoxide."
          [7] "Since the step sites play an essential role in the growth of the graphene islands, as mentioned above, additives such as potassium, sulfur, gold or boron have been proposed."
          [8] "Apart from blocking the sub-surface sites, sub-surface boron in Ni(111) also has been shown to have an destabilizing effect on on-surface C centers, which may help to prevent the accumulation of C atoms on the surface."

[1] "A catalyst design consisting of the double-decoration of nanoparticulate intermetallic PtGa with Pb and Ca was applied to produce an ultra-stable catalyst for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) at a high temperature."
          [2] "PtGaCaPb/SiO2 exhibited outstanding catalytic stability in PDH at 600C, and almost no deactivation was observed for up to 1month."
          [3] "Herein, we report a novel catalyst design concept, namely, the double decoration of PtGa intermetallics by Pb and Ca, which synergize the geometric and electronic promotion effects on the catalyst stability, respectively."
          [4] "Pb is deposited on the three-fold Pt3 sites of the PtGa nanoparticles to block them, whereas Ca, which affords an electron-enriched single-atom-like Pt1 site, is placed around the nanoparticles."
          [5] "Thus, PtGaCaPb/SiO2 exhibits an outstandingly high catalytic stability, even at 600C (kd=0.00033h1, τ=3067h), and almost no deactivation of the catalyst was observed for up to 1month for the first time."

[1] "To expose the loaded Pt on the surface of the carriers, ion exchange and impregnation are two simple and practical methods. The dispersion of Pt mainly depends on the precursors of Pt, the preparation conditions, the properties of the carriers, and the interaction between Pt and the carriers, as well as the additives."
          [2] "The addition of a second metal has been found to be highly effective for the sintering resistance of Pt particles. The introduced metal forms alloys with Pt around Pt particles,63 and the alloys anchor them on the surface of the carriers, making them not easy to migrate and coalesce."
          [3] "The application of the carriers possessing a strong interaction with Pt is another way to retard the sintering. Al2O3 is the most common carrier of Pt catalyst, in which the coordinatively unsaturated pentacoordinate Al3+ can anchor Pt to make it not easy to migrate."
          [4] "Nanocarbon was also reported as the carrier of Pt to improve the sintering resistance, and the strong metalcarrier interaction leads to the electron transfer from nanocarbon to the Pt particles, significantly preventing the sintering of Pt."
          [5] "MgAl2O4 spinel is also a good choice as the carrier. Generally, Pt is not directly loaded on MgAl2O4 spinel prepared beforehand, but firstly loaded into the spaces between the layers of MgAlOx hydrotalcite, and then Pt particles are enclosed in the interspace of MgAl2O4 spinel formed through the collapse of the layered structure of the hydrotalcite after calcination at high temperature."
          [6] "Moliner et al.67 reported effective methods to encapsulate Pt in highly siliceous chabazite, and the catalyst showed enhanced stability towards Pt sintering even at 650750 C in the atmospheres of H2, O2 and H2O."
          [7] "The Al2O3 overcoat has also proved to be efficient in preventing the sintering of Pt nanoparticles through atomic layer deposition."
          [8] "Tanabe et al. revealed that no Pt sintering was observed for Pt/MgO as an automotive exhaust catalyst after calcination in air at 900 C, for the formation of a Mg2PtO4-like compound prevents the migration of Pt."
          [9] "Nagai et al. found that CeO2 had a similar effect of MgO in preventing the sintering of Pt due to the formation of the PtOCe bond in the Pt/CeO2 catalyst."
          [10] "Recently, Pt supported on CeO2 has attracted more attention because of the ability of CeO2 to trap Pt in an atomically dispersed state."
          [11] "The atomically dispersed Pt is most likely to be present in the form of Pt2+ bonded to the ubiquitous step edges of the CeO2 surface."
          [12] "The addition of Ga, In, Zn, Cu, Ir, Co to Pt catalysts exhibits similar effects as Sn."
          [13] "Not only that, but Sattler et al.84 showed that in the highly active, selective and stable PtGaK/Al2O3 (0.1 wt% Pt, 3 wt% Ga, 0.25 wt% K) catalyst for the dehydrogenation of propane, the coordinately unsaturated Ga3+ is responsible for activating the CH bond, and Pt only acts as a promoter."
          [14] "Furthermore, just like the PtSn/CeO2 catalyst,29 the reactivity can be fully recovered via simple coke burning in air, although the sintering of Pt still occurs."
          [15] "Located at the same main group with Ga, In was also reported to be the promoter of supported Pt catalysts. The PtIn/Mg(Al)O catalyst prepared at pH 8 using the co-precipitation method exhibits the best catalytic performance and the strongest interaction between the metal phase and the carrier."
          [16] "B and Si, two nonmetal elements, can play similar roles, too. Dehydrogenation of n-butane over the PtB/SiO2 catalyst showed improved catalytic activity and stability compared with Pt/SiO2."
          [17] "Dadras et al.86 called B a magic bullet against sintering and coking, and they summarized the positive roles of B as follows. The non-stoichiometric PtB cluster is anchored to the carrier via a covalent BO bond, which is much stronger than the interaction between Pt clusters and the carrier surface."
          [18] "Additionally, the dissociation energy of a Pt atom from a PtB cluster is significantly larger than that from the pure Pt cluster, increasing the sintering resistance."
          [19] "Finally, the affinity of PtB cluster to C also drops dramatically, leading to the reduced coke formation and increased selectivity to olefins."
          [20] "It is predicted by a computational screening of main-group elements as potential additives for the Pt catalyst that Si, just as B, can modify the selectivity of the Pt catalyst by changing both electronic and geometric properties."

[1] "In this review, we outline the progress of these dehydrogenation catalysts that have been mainly developed in the past five years. For different classes of the most-promising catalysts in the selective dehydrogenation of ethane-to-ethylene and propane-to-propylene, their syntheses, structural information, catalytic properties and mechanisms are comparatively summarized."
          [2] "The synthesis parameters influence the metal particle size for the as-obtained Pt-based catalysts."
          [3] "The synthesis approach can also be applied to tailor the size and phase of bimetallic nanoparticles."
          [4] "The synthesis parameters influence the metal particle size for the as-obtained Pt-based catalysts."
          [5] "The synthesis chemistry contributes to the stabilization effect of Pt through strong PtOCe bonds."
          [6] "The synthesis strategy has been reported for the zeolite-confined Pt single-atom and nanocluter catalysts with high stability."
          [7] "The synthesis procedure can maintain the porous texture and anchor the active Pt-based metals."
          [8] "The synthesis method is used to prepare uniform PtIn bimetal nanoparticles."
          [9] "The synthesis approach is used to prepare the well-defined surface metal species by employing the single-site metal precursors."

          [11] "The synthesis procedure can achieve the formation of the Sn single-site located in the frameworks."
          [12] "The synthesis method allows it to serve as a potent ion-exchanger, resulting in the stabilization of the highly dispersed bimetallic PtZn sites by the ETS-2 support."

[1] "To improve the stability of Pt-based catalysts, many efforts have been dedicated to strengthen metalsupport interactions by using various methods including the nanopore-encaged metal strategy,2124 wet-chemistry approach2529 and modification of supports.10,11,30,31 Among them, modification of supports is a relatively effective and simple method to improve the stability of Pt-based catalysts."
          [2] "For example, Lu et al. reported a PtSn/Al2O3 sheet catalyst for PDH, exhibiting high activity, selectivity and stability.11 It was proposed that the enhanced stability in PDH was associated with γ-Al2O3 nanosheets containing a great deal of pentacoordinate Al3+ ions, which can stabilize PtSn clusters by strong interactions between metals and supports."
          [3] "Recent work by Ma et al. showed that the addition of Ga into Mg(Al)O layer double hydrotalcites could greatly enhance the stability of Pt catalysts in PDH.10 It may be due to the fact that pentacoordinate Ga3+ ions could disperse and stabilize PtSn clusters, thereby enhancing the electronic interactions between Pt and Ga."
          [4] "A similar conclusion regarding the importance of modification of supports has been reported in the case of PtSn/CeO2 catalysts.30"
          [5] "Therefore, this provides a way to tune and enhance the catalytic activity and selectivity for the PDH process, and also introduces unique stability characteristics for bimetallic systems."
          [6] "Herein, highly stable Pt/Sn-Si-beta catalysts for PDH were prepared by an improved post-synthesis strategy, which consists of dealumination of H-beta and subsequent metal impregnation."
          [7] "It is indicated that Sn species existing in tetrahedral coordination states were incorporated into the framework of dealuminated beta (Si-beta)."
          [8] "Meanwhile, Pt species were highly dispersed in the form of ultra-small nanoclusters on Pt/Sn-Si-beta due to the strong interaction between Pt and Sn(IV) sites confined in the Si-beta framework."
          [9] "The prepared Pt/Sn-Si-beta catalysts show excellent catalytic performance for PDH, in which the propene formation rate was 2.3 mol g1Pt h1 with a propene selectivity of >99% at 550 C and the higher propene formation rate was 3.1 mol g1Pt h1 at 600 C."
          [10] "Moreover, the strong PtSn interactions and the confinement effect of Sn in the Si-beta framework inhibit the coke and sintering of Pt clusters, thereby achieving good stability of dehydrogenation and regeneration with almost unchanged catalytic activity during four cycles at 550 C."



[1] "Although the direct dehydrogenation technique has been industrialized, the fabrication of the corresponding catalysts is still confronted with a series of plights."
          [2] "Decades have witnessed the efforts made and strategies proposed by devoted researchers to optimize the catalyst performance and improve the catalytic stability from a wide panorama."
          [3] "In this section, strategies focused on catalytic stability enhancement in recently reported works are summarized."
          [4] "Effectively regulating the active compounds in both Pt-based catalysts and metal oxide-based catalysts can be achieved by soundly introducing promoters."
          [5] "Promoters can greatly impact the catalytic behaviors in PDH catalysts, showing advantages in suppression of side reactions, inhibition of coke deposition, stabilizing active compounds and so on."
          [6] "Metallic Pt has already been recognized as an effective catalyst for alkane dehydrogenation reactions due to its high affinity for paraffinic CH bonds."
          [7] "Currently, adding metal promoters to form alloys or intermetallic compounds is one of the most effective methods to ameliorate central active components and inhibit catalytic deactivation in Pt-based catalytic systems."
          [8] "Sn is a widely utilized promoter for Pt catalysts."
          [9] "The PtGa catalyst system has also been implemented in production plants (FCDh technique)."
          [10] "In has also been developed as a promising promoter of Pt-based catalysts."
          [11] "Zn is another analogous but economical promoter for Pt-based catalysts."
          [12] "Many other metals, including Fe, Cu, and Co, can also be promoters for Pt-based catalysts to adjust the electronic properties and improve the dispersion of Pt atoms for further stability enhancement."
          [13] "Alloying of Pt with rare-earth elements (REEs) has barely been accomplished through the conventional H2 reduction route due to the low chemical potential of REE oxides."
          [14] "Supported metal oxide-based catalysts, including CoOx-, ZnOx-, VOx-, and CrOx-based catalysts, are other important PDH catalysts and have been extensively studied for decades."
          [15] "Introducing another metal oxide to form an oxide compound is an effective approach to improve the dispersion of active species and enhance the catalytic stability under the applied conditions, showing advantages in modifying the coordination and electronic state of host metal oxide sites."
          [16] "The introduction of an appropriate metal oxide or noble metal into a catalytic system can greatly enhance the catalytic performance."



[1] "Extensive research efforts have been made to inhibit deactivation and improve propene selectivity of Pt-based catalysts by doping promoters of Sn [9,10], In [11,12], Ga [13,14] and Cu [15] to form bimetallic catalysts."
          [2] "For example, PtIn [16] and PtGa [17,18] bimetallic nanoparticles (NPs) supported on calcined hydrotalcites (HT) show higher activity and selectivity in PDH, which has been attributed to the increased Pt dispersion and electron transfer from In or Ga to Pt [11,18]."
          [3] "Besides promoters, another method is to modify Al2O3 support with ZnO [19], La2O3 [20] or TiO2 [21] or replace Al2O3 support with ZnAl2O4 [22], ZSM-5 [23] or Mg(Al)O oxide [8,24]."
          [4] "Additionally, it has been verified that the single Pt atom sites on Pt-Sn/γ-Al2O3 with a sandwich structure are more favorable for PDH reaction than Pt ensembles [25,26]."
          [5] "Gong et al. [15] also reported that the PtCu single atom alloys can enhance the propane conversion and propene selectivity simultaneously in PDH."
          [6] "Whether as promoters or supports, an important aim of using them is to obtain highly and stably dispersed Pt-based catalysts so that improving PDH performance."
          [7] "However, it is still difficult to break through these challenges for PDH reactions [27], and the exact Pt-M-support relationship is still unclear."
          [8] "Therefore, it is extremely necessary to find more efficient methods to solve the problems mentioned above."
          [9] "In fact, the hierarchical morphology and porous structure play important roles in many heterogeneous catalytic reactions. However, the effect of hierarchical microstructure is seldom reported."
          [10] "Given that the small Pt NPs and hierarchical microstructure may provide more stable and easily accessible active sites for PDH reaction, a promising design for obtaining the desired size of active Pt and hierarchical pore morphology was proposed."
          [11] "The promoted effects of HT reconstruction on the microstructure and morphology of the 3D oxide nanosheet array catalyst, and the subsequently superior PDH performance, were profoundly discussed."

Stable and selective catalysts for propane dehydrogenation operating at thermodynamic limit Hitting the limits on propene synthesis The greater abundance of propane from shale gas has spurred efforts to use it as a propylene feedstock. Direct dehydrogenation catalysts consisting of platinumtin alloy nanoparticles supported on alumina often must run with hydrogen dilution to avoid carbon buildup and excess tin to avoid alloy segregation.
          We report that silica-supported platinum-tin (Pt1Sn1) nanoparticles (&lt;2 nanometers in diameter) can operate as a PDH catalyst at thermodynamically limited conversion levels, with excellent stability and selectivity to propylene (&gt;99%). Atomic mixing of Pt and Sn in the precursor is preserved upon reduction and during catalytic operation. The benign interaction of these nanoparticles with the silicon dioxide support does not lead to Pt-Sn segregation and formation of a tin oxide phase that can occur over traditional catalyst supports.
          To alleviate this issue, large quantities of Sn are used in the catalyst preparation (the nominal atomic loading is Sn:Pt between 4 and 5), which increases the yield of intermetallic PtSn NPs (12). In addition, studies have shown that adding hydrogen to the reactant feed reduces the rate of catalyst deactivation (13). Although this strategy is implemented commercially (10), addition of hydrogen in the feed lowers the thermodynamic limit on per-pass propane conversion (fig. S1) and decreases productivity (7).
          We developed a PDH catalyst that operates at thermodynamically limited conversion levels without the addition of hydrogen to the feed and exhibits excellent stability and selectivity to propylene (&gt;99%). The catalyst is composed of silica-supported Pt1Sn1 NPs, synthesized and pretreated to ensure that the mixing of Pt and Sn is preserved during catalytic operation.
          The principle behind catalyst synthesis is to begin with a heterometallic Pt-Sn coordination complex in which Pt and Sn are in immediate contact, and this interaction is retained during the reduction and PDH reaction.
          The data in Fig. 1, A to C, were obtained with 16 vol % propane in helium. Propane streams are diluted in commercial operations to increase the limiting equilibrium conversion, which is higher at lower propane partial pressure (fig. S2), and to limit catalyst deactivation rates (7, 16, 17). This approach requires additional downstream separation units and limits process efficiency.
          The data in Fig. 1, A to C, show the performance of the Pt1Sn1/SiO2 catalyst (1 wt % Pt and 0.6 wt % Sn) for propane dehydrogenation at 580C, 16 vol % propane (with the remainder helium) and at a weight hourly space velocity (WHSV) of 4.7 hours1. Under these reaction conditions, the thermodynamic limit on propane conversion is 66.5% (fig. S2). The Pt1Sn1/SiO2 catalyst showed near-thermodynamic conversion of &gt;66% (Fig. 1A, red circles) and &gt;99% selectivity to propylene (Fig. 1B, red circles).
          The data in Fig. 1D show that, under these conditions, the propane conversion goes from 41 to 39% in 120 min. Under identical conditions, the other tested catalysts deactivate very rapidly to very low conversion, as illustrated for the commercial mimic. A transmission electron microscopy (TEM) image of the spent catalyst, after 120 min of PDH reaction, is shown in fig. S6. The image shows that the Pt-Sn NPs are well dispersed, with an average particle diameter of 1.6  0.67 nm, which is consistent with the particle size in fresh samples.
          We attempted to regenerate the Pt1Sn1/SiO2 catalyst by oxidation, using 1% O2 as a mild oxidant at 500C followed by reduction at 600C (see supplementary materials for details of the regeneration procedure). The regeneration studies showed that Pt1Sn1/SiO2 catalysts can be partially regenerated. For example, we measured 97% of the initial activity and &gt;99% of the initial selectivity after three PDH/regeneration cycles (fig. S5).
          Data in Fig. 3A show that the process of mixing chloroplatinic acid (H2PtCl6) and tin(II) chloride (SnCl2) in 0.1 M hydrochloric acid solution formed a heterometallic Pt-Sn coordination complex.
          A bright-field TEM image of Pt-Sn NPs formed on SiO2 upon the reduction of the Pt-Sn complex shows high metal dispersion on the support, with an average NP size of 1.3  0.6 nm (Fig. 3B). The NP size distribution (Fig. 3C) shows that most NPs were &lt;2 nm. The XRD spectra in Fig. 3D show that the formed NPs were essentially alloys of Pt and Sn. This finding is supported by the presence of the XRD peaks corresponding to Pt1Sn1 (41.8 and 44.1) and Pt3Sn1 (39.0 and 45.3) stoichiometries.
          The real-space Pt LIII EXAFS spectra for the Pt1Sn1/SiO2 catalyst (Fig. 4D) are substantially different from the spectra of monometallic Pt and indicate the mixing of Pt and Sn atoms. The best-fit spectrum for the Pt1Sn1/SiO2 catalyst is characterized by the presence of the Pt-Pt and Pt-Sn scattering paths, consistent with the formation of PtSn intermetallic phases.

          [2] "Herein, a series of highly ordered mesoporous Al2O3 supports with different levels of Al3+penta sites, are fabricated and used as the support to disperse Pt-Sn2 clusters."
          [3] "The stability and regenerability of Pt-Sn2/meso-Al2O3 are strongly dependent on the content of Al3+penta sites in the Al2O3 structure, and a high level of Al3+penta sites can effectively prevent the agglomeration of Pt-Sn2 clusters into large Pt nanoparticles in the consecutive dehydrogenation-regeneration cycles."



[1] "Rare-earthplatinum alloy nanoparticles in mesoporous zeolite for catalysis Platinum is a much used catalyst that, in petrochemical processes, is often alloyed with other metals to improve catalytic activity, selectivity and longevity1,2,3,4,5."
          [2] "Such catalysts are usually prepared in the form of metallic nanoparticles supported on porous solids, and their production involves reducing metal precursor compounds under a H2 flow at high temperatures6."
          [3] "The method works well when using easily reducible late transition metals, but Pt alloy formation with rare-earth elements through the H2 reduction route is almost impossible owing to the low chemical potential of rare-earth element oxides6."
          [4] "Here we use as support a mesoporous zeolite that has pore walls with surface framework defects (called silanol nests) and show that the zeolite enables alloy formation between Pt and rare-earth elements."
          [5] "We find that the silanol nests enable the rare-earth elements to exist as single atomic species with a substantially higher chemical potential compared with that of the bulk oxide, making it possible for them to diffuse onto Pt."
          [6] "High-resolution transmission electron microscopy and hydrogen chemisorption measurements indicate that the resultant bimetallic nanoparticles supported on the mesoporous zeolite are intermetallic compounds, which we find to be stable, highly active and selective catalysts for the propane dehydrogenation reaction."
          [7] "When used with late transition metals, the same preparation strategy produces Pt alloy catalysts that incorporate an unusually large amount of the second metal and, in the case of the PtCo alloy, show high catalytic activity and selectivity in the preferential oxidation of carbon monoxide in H2."
          [8] "The industrial PDH process has been using PtSn bimetallic catalysts supported on porous alumina for nearly three decades, since its discovery in the early 1990s3,7."
          [9] "The Pt metal alone exhibits high initial catalytic activity, but rapidly deactivates as a result of coke deposition on the Pt surface."
          [10] "The coke deposition also causes an undesirable loss of the catalytic selectivity to propylene."
          [11] "To alleviate these problems, Sn is introduced to form an alloy with Pt nanoparticles and thereby dilute the Pt surface with inactive Sn atoms and break up coke-generating Pt ensembles."
          [12] "Our search for a highly active and more durable PDH catalyst has focused on using a siliceous MFI zeolite with a hierarchical micro-/mesoporous structure as a replacement for the alumina support."
          [13] "This zeolite, synthesized using a multi-ammonium surfactant as a structure-directing agent, has attracted attention as an advanced catalyst support8,9,10,11,12,13 owing to its unique structure, which comprises ultrathin zeolite frameworks and three-dimensionally interconnected mesopores that boost the catalytic performance of supported metals by providing both facile reactant and product diffusion and high metal nanoparticle dispersion within the mesopores12,13."
          [14] "The formation of the Pt3La and Pt3Y nanoparticles on the degallated zeolite brought a striking enhancement in all aspects of the PDH catalytic performance, including activity, selectivity and durability, as shown in Fig. 2."
          [15] "The catalytic reaction was performed at 580C using a pure propane flow at a large space velocity (see Methods), and these harsh operating conditions caused even the conventional PtSn/alumina catalyst to experience severe coke formation and catalyst deactivation within 1 d."
          [16] "In sharp contrast, the Pt3La intermetallic nanoparticles supported on the degallated zeolite (denoted as PtLa/mz-deGa, where mz stands for mesoporous zeolite) showed a high initial propane conversion of 40% (close to the equilibrium conversion) and underwent extremely slow deactivation, retaining 8% conversion even after 30 days of reaction."
          [17] "The PtREE incorporation in the mesoporous zeolite was conducted by co-impregnation of aqueous solutions of Pt(NH3)4(NO3)2 and either La(NO3)3·6H2O or Y(NO3)3·6H2O, followed by heating under an O2 flow at 350C and subsequently under H2 at 700C (see Methods)."
          [18] "The formation of the Pt3La and Pt3Y nanoparticles on the degallated zeolite brought a striking enhancement in all aspects of the PDH catalytic performance, including activity, selectivity and durability, as shown in Fig. 2."

          [23] "The effect of the remaining Ga was examined from the differences in PDH performance of mz-deGa, La/mz-deGa and Pt/mz-deGa, as shown in Extended Data Fig. 7."

[1] "Although the equilibrium conversion of alkanes increases with temperature, alkene selectivity decreases with increasing temperature and chain length due to an increased tendency toward dehydrocyclization/aromatisation, thermal cracking and coke formation."
          [2] "Direct dehydrogenation of lower alkanes is an energy intensive reaction; however, oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) has the potential to lower the energy requirement for achieving dehydrogenation."
          [3] "ODH can be considered as tandem endothermic (dehydrogenation, CnH2n + 2  CnH2n + H2) and exothermic (oxidation, H2 + O2  H2O) processes, with an overall thermodynamic summation, CnH2n + 2 + O2  CnH2n + H2O."
          [4] "Although the process is not thermo-neutral, part of the energy required for the endothermic reaction is augmented by the exothermic reaction."
          [5] "Thus, ODH of alkanes takes place at lower temperature compared to the corresponding non-ODH."
          [6] "This lower temperature requirement of ODH compared to non-ODH and cracking is encouraging and provides motivation for continued efforts to develop ODH into an industrial technology."
          [7] "Although ODH is attractive because of the energy intensification advantage, commercial ODH technologies hinge on innovative catalyst and process design, i.e. proper synergy of the endothermic dehydrogenation step with the exothermic hydrogen combustion and design of selective CH and hydrogen combustion catalysts."

          [12] "Catalyst improvement endeavors can benefit from insights on alkane CH bond activation mechanisms."
          [13] "Developing direct routes to obtain key organic chemicals from lower alkanes would benefit industry."
          [14] "Lower alkanes are relatively inert, and they exhibit little or no reactivity at conditions typical for activating functional group reactions in organic compounds because they lack low-lying vacant orbitals or lone pair electrons."
          [15] "Alkanes are made up non-polar CC and CH bonds. These bonds consist of strongly localised electron pairs that are usually induced to reactivity under severe conditions (e.g., at high temperature or pressure, or with the use of aggressive reagents)."
          [16] "The first and rate-limiting step of alkane dehydrogenation using platinum or chromium oxide-based catalysts involves CH activation."
          [17] "Although a number of efforts have been made to gain insight on the mechanism of the reaction, questions still remain, especially regarding the pathway of the CH activation."
          [18] "It is of fundamental and applied interest to know whether the first CH bond cleavage is homolytic or heterolytic."
          [19] "If it is a heterolytic pathway, it will further be of interest to know whether the first hydrogen from the alkane substrate is abstracted as a proton or as a hydride ion."
          [20] "This knowledge will benefit catalyst improvement efforts."
          [21] "The simple impregnation techniques for preparing supported (especially alumina) metal and oxide catalysts becloud their structural heterogeneity."

          [25] "Although several solid acid catalysts are used in alkane conversions, zeolites have the advantage of possessing a well-defined structure, allowing the structure-activity relationship to be easily deduced."
          [26] "Therefore, it is instructive to examine non-oxidative dehydrogenation of light alkanes over zeolite catalysts."
          [27] "A detailed knowledge of the adsorption mechanism of lower alkane molecules on zeolite is of interest in this context, especially for informed tuning of zeolite properties to allow efficient and selective dehydrogenation of alkanes."
          [28] "Light alkanes are adsorbed on zeolites via dispersive interaction."
          [29] "Protons and the exchanged metals ions are typically the active sites in zeolites, while the zeolite framework plays the role of anchor for the active sites and/or dispersion medium for the reactants."
          [30] "The framework of microporous zeolites exerts dispersive forces on the reactant's molecules that depend on the shape, channel and cavity of the framework."
          [31] "In addition, the nature and the density of the active sites influence the framework dispersion forces."
          [32] "Recent reports have shown that the strong electrostatic field between protons or exchanged metal ions and basic oxygen species can enhance and/or induce polarization of bonds in hydrocarbon adsorbates."
          [33] "This agrees with Hashiguchi et al., who found enhanced activation of the CH bond on a homogeneous catalyst."
          [34] "Wender et al. showed that 3040% of heat adsorption in n-alkanes on Na-zeolite is due to polarization of the adsorbates."
          [35] "Subbotina et al. also demonstrated that the CH bond of ethane is more strongly polarized on Mg2 + and Ca2 + forms of Y zeolite than on Na+ forms."
          [36] "Mg2 +-Y zeolite molecules exhibit weaker adsorption and polarization of ethane than Ca2 +-zeolites."
          [37] "Based on charge density considerations, Mg2 + cations are expected to exhibit a stronger polarizing effect than Ca2 + cations."
          [38] "Subbotina et al. explain that because of the smaller ionic radius of Mg2 +, it is more strongly shielded by the surrounding oxygen atoms of the zeolite lattice than a Ca2 + ion, thereby reducing the polarizing effect of Mg2 + on the hydrocarbon adsorbate."
          [39] "Sievers et al. also report that the La3 + form of X zeolite induces strong polarization of adsorbed alkane molecules; partial positive charges were induced on secondary and tertiary carbon atoms of alkane molecules."
          [40] "The authors suggest that the polarization may be viewed as an intermediate condition to hydride abstraction (which is an important elementary step in CH activation)."
          [41] "They add that CH bond polarization was enhanced by physisorbed water molecules that coordinate with La3 + cations."
          [42] "The enhanced polarization of CH bonds by the presence of water molecules on La3 +X zeolite may have a beneficial effect in oxidative dehydrogenation where water is a by-product."
          [43] "Alkane polarization studies on Na+, Mg2 +, Ca2 +, and La3 + exchanged X-zeolites indicate that the polarizing effect increases with increasing charge magnitude and ionic radius."
          [44] "Note that these alkane polarizing cations occupy the same position on the zeolites as the well-known CH activation cations/metals, and thus the CH polarizing effect has a complementary effect on CH activation."
          [45] "This may add to the number of relevant variables and increase the challenge of optimizing the ratio of activation/polarizing cations among exchangeable sites (Si/Al ratio), as well as the sequence for incorporating the cations or metals during catalyst preparation."
          [46] "Further, it is important to note that the choice of cations should be such that they exhibit no catalytic (oligomerization, isomerization, aromatisation or oxidation) effects on the target alkene products at the reaction condition."
          [47] "Furthermore, it may be beneficial to create a CH polarization effect on the zeolite framework."
          [48] "This can be achieved by appropriate chance of framework atoms."
          [49] "Since active sites are usually created on the zeolite frameworks."
          [50] "The activation of CH bonds of light alkanes occurs readily on super electrophiles (super Brnsted and super Lewis acid) at low temperatures."
          [51] "Although CH activation on zeolites have been observed at low temperatures, industrial alkane reactions on zeolites are usually carried out at high temperatures."
          [52] "Several experimental and theoretical studies on the molecular dynamics of light alkanes on zeolite have been published."
          [53] "However, despite the decades of intensive investigations on the subject, the actual mechanism of CH activation on acid zeolite is still debated."
          [54] "Two CH activation paths are generally recognized: the unimolecular/protolytic mechanism and the bimolecular/carbenium chain mechanism."
          [55] "The unimolecular mechanism involves direct protonation of an alkane-forming carbonium ion intermediate."
          [56] "The proton can be inserted into either a CC or CH bond of the alkane."
          [57] "Proton insertion through the CC bond leads to cracking of the alkane, with the acid site regenerated."
          [58] "Insertion through the HC bond yields H2 and a carbenium ion/alkoxide intermediate."
          [59] "Desorption of alkene from the intermediate regenerates the acid, or the alkoxide can enter the bimolecular conversion path."
          [60] "In the bimolecular mechanism of CH activation, the alkoxide intermediate constitutes the active sites and CH activation occurs through hydride transfer from a second alkane molecule forming another alkoxide."
          [61] "This may be followed by βscission to regenerate the active site and complete the catalytic cycle."
          [62] "For example, activation of propane on acid zeolite based on the two mechanisms is illustrated in Scheme 1."
          [63] "Low reactant partial pressure and high temperature favor unimolecular dehydrogenation of alkane on acid zeolite."
          [64] "These conditions favor the endothermic desorption step (rate limiting step) leading to propene."
          [65] "In contrast, high partial pressure and low temperature favor the bimolecular mechanism leading to a low propene yield."
          [66] "The two molecular mechanisms devoid of side reactions give fairly predictable product distribution."
          [67] "However, the products of each route are prone to side reactions (dimerization, oligomerization, isomerization & aromatisation) in the presence of Bronsted acid sites."
          [68] "Hence propene selectivity on acidic zeolite is very low and products rich in aromatics are usually obtained."
          [69] "The active sites (alkoxide intermediate) of the bimolecular pathway are formed in situ."
          [70] "The alkoxide intermediate is made up of an alkyl carbenium ion ionically held to the zeolite framework oxygen ion."
          [71] "The active sites of the unimolecular pathway are the charge balancing protons of the zeolite framework."
          [72] "A proton and a carbenium ion are an electrophilic or Lewis acid species (a proton can also be considered as a special case of Lewis acidity)."
          [73] "The two pathways essentially involve electrophilic CH activation."
          [74] "The electrophiles (proton and carbenium ion) activate CH at high temperatures (500 C), giving low conversion rates of light alkanes and poor selectivity to corresponding alkenes."
          [75] "Iglesia and co-workers used isotopic labeling studies to demonstrate that CH activation is not the rate-limiting step in the dehydrogenation of propane on H-ZSM-5 and Ga/H-ZSM-5."
          [76] "They proposed that the CH bond cleavage produces an H-adatom and an alkoxide intermediate."
          [77] "Desorption of an alkene from the alkoxide regenerates the proton sites on the zeolites."
          [78] "An alkoxide intermediate may also discharge as a hydrogen rich species through cracking."
          [79] "Iglesia et al. proposed that desorption or disposal of the H-adatom from the CH bond cleavage is the rate-limiting step."
          [80] "A similar deduction was reached by Yu et al."
          [81] "who found that desorption of the alkoxides intermediate is the rate-limiting step under conditions that favor the unimolecular mechanism."
          [82] "The above proposition has been demonstrated on metal (e.g., Ga, Zn, and Co) exchanged zeolites."
          [83] "The specific role of the exchanged metals has been the subject of several reports with special attention on Ga and Zn."
          [84] "Although the framework Ga2O3 on H-MFI seems to have a CH polarization effect on desorbed methane, Ga2O3 exhibits lower CH activation activity."
          [85] "The physical mixture of Ga2O3/HMFI displays higher propane aromatisation activity than pure H-MFI."
          [86] "Similar synergistic effects have been reported for Zn/H-MFI and Co/H-MFI."
          [87] "Exchanged cations behave as monomeric species at the exchange sites of zeolite."
          [88] "Iglesia and Biscardi hypothesized that the monomeric species enhance propane conversion by promoting re-combinative desorption (RD) of the H-adatom formed from the CH cleavage."
          [89] "It is worthwhile noting that the exchange cations (electrophilic species) constitute the CH activation sites."
          [90] "Hence, more insights are required about their additional role in promoting RD."
          [91] "However, the authors did not provide further information on the nature of the H-adatoms and the mechanism of RD."
          [92] "In the next section, we examine the mechanism of desorption of H-adatoms over Ga and Zn exchanged H-ZSM-5."
          [93] "The exchanged metal ions in zeolites are held ionically by one or more basic oxygen atoms."
          [94] "Different species have been suggested, depending on the density of the cation exchange site of the zeolite and method of introduction of the metals."
          [95] "According to Kanansky et al."
          [96] "the exchanged Zn and Ga species on H-ZSM-5 and their mechanism of CH activation are distinctively different."
          [97] "Zn and Ga are introduced on H-ZSM-5 through a vapor deposition technique using Zn metal vapor and Ga(CH3)3 as the source of Zn and Ga, respectively."
          [98] "The metal introduction technique allows quantitative exchange of the zeolite protons which leads to Zn/Al = 0.5 and Ga/Al = 1, respectively."
          [99] "Zn2 + is generated directly, but Ga+ is produced by H2 treatment at 500 C to release the methyl groups."
          [100] "The proposed active sites are OZn2+O and OGa+, respectively."
          [101] "The mechanism of CH activation with ethane by the two sites under the same reaction conditions are summarized in Scheme 2."
          [102] "The proposed mechanism is in agreement with the mechanism suggested from calculations using the GAUSSIAN 94 program for ethane activation on Zn-exchanged zeolite by Frash and van Santen."
          [103] "In another theoretical study using a DFT cluster modeling approach, Pidko and van Santen compared the activation energy of CH with three types of Zn species at active sites: OZn2+O, OZn+OZn+O and HOZn+ O."
          [104] "The authors suggest that the reaction proceeds most easily on OZn2+O, and hypothesize that the enhanced Lewis activity of OZn2+O facilitates CH heterolytic cleavage."
          [105] "They further argue that the first proton abstraction occurs preferentially on the oxygen sites neighboring the ring where the cation is located."
          [106] "They proposed a one-step reaction to yield H2 and C2H4 from the decomposition of the Zn-alkyl and proton."
          [107] "A proposed mechanism of CH activation on OGa+ has similarly been suggested using theoretical calculations."
          [108] "High alkene selectivities are obtained on the H-ZSM-5 when exchangeable protons are rigorously replaced by Zn and Ga."
          [109] "The Zn-exchanged H-ZSM-5 had higher ethane conversion rates but lower ethene selectivity than its Ga counterpart."
          [110] "The CH activation on the OZn2+O site can be described by a Lewis base-assisted deprotonation mechanism."
          [111] "This is accompanied by conversion of the Lewis base site to a conjugate Bronsted acid site."
          [112] "The OGa+ site, however, activates the CH bond via oxidative addition without a protonic site intermediate."
          [113] "A protonic site intermediate increases tendency of side reactions on the Zn-exchanged H-ZSM-5 relative to the Ga counterpart."
          [114] "The elementary steps of CH activation on OGa+ (Scheme 2) reveal that a redox cycle at the metal center is required for catalytic CH activation via the oxidative addition mechanism."
          [115] "A redox cycle is not apparent in the elementary step presented for CH activation on OZn2+O."
          [116] "Hence, a redox cycle is not a requisite for CH activation via the Lewis base-assisted deprotonation mechanism."
          [117] "However, under alkane dehydrogenation reaction conditions, the OZn2+O sites can undergo a reversible Zn2 +/Zn redox process."
          [118] "This redox process increases the availability of undesired protonic site intermediates."
          [119] "Zn-exchanged H-ZSM-5 prepared by conventional ion-exchange methods contain a significant percentage of unexchanged proton sites leading to lower alkene selectivity of the catalyst."
          [120] "Iglesia and Biscardi titrate the proton sites with NaOH."
          [121] "The un-titrated and the titrated catalysts are denoted as Zn/H-ZSMS-5 and Zn/Na-ZSMS-5, respectively."
          [122] "Zn/Na-ZSM-5 has four times the propane conversion rate and a higher propene selectivity than Zn/H-ZSMS-5."
          [123] "The propene formation rate obtained with Zn/Na-ZSM-5 was ten times that of Zn/H-ZSMS-5."
          [124] "The zinc species at the cation exchange site of the zeolite was identified as OZn+OH."
          [125] "The higher propene selectivity obtained on Zn/Na-ZSM-5 compared to Zn/H-ZSMS-5 is presumably from the lower density and availability of proton sites on Zn/Na-ZSM-5."
          [126] "The improved propane conversion rate of Zn/Na-ZSM-5 compared to Zn/H-ZSM-5 is attributable to the higher efficiency of OZn+OH sites in catalyzing desorption of H-adatoms than OZn2+O sites."
          [127] "Another strategy to enhance alkene selectivity is by controlling the strength of the proton sites."
          [128] "The acidity of the sites depends on the nature of the trivalent cation of the zeolite framework."
          [129] "Proton sites in borosilicate zeolites are weaker than those of aluminosilicate, and thus higher alkene selectivity is expected for alkane dehydrogenation over Zn/H[B]-ZSM-5 compared to Zn/H[Al]-ZSM-5."
          [130] "However, Zn/H[B]-ZSM-5 shows no activity for propane dehydrogenation."
          [131] "The desired weaker acidity of the proton sites of Zn/H[B]-ZSM-5 requires weaker basicity of the oxygen atoms in the zeolite framework."
          [132] "This reduced basicity of the oxygen atoms is not sufficiently polarizing to complement the exchanged Zn2 + in CH bond cleavage."
          [133] "In the next section, we examine use of zeolite support to design a Pt-based alkane dehydrogenation catalyst."
          [134] "Elimination of the proton sites of zeolites is critical for obtaining a high alkene selectivity and stability in dehydrogenation catalysts."
          [135] "Pt is the most versatile noble metal catalyst for alkane reactions."
          [136] "Although Pt is expensive, the choice of Pt is often justified by its higher activity, stability and selectivity for these reactions compared to less expensive alternative transition metals."
          [137] "However, rapid catalyst deactivation due to coke formation remains a challenge even when using a Pt-based catalyst for dehydrogenation of light alkanes."
          [138] "Waku et al."
          [139] "exploited the unique property of zeolite as a support for achieving high metal dispersion through cation exchange sites to create a Pt/Na[Fe]-ZSM-5 catalyst with outstanding stability for dehydrogenation of light alkanes."
          [140] "They found that the catalyst deactivation rate of Pt/Na[Fe]-ZSM-5 was lower than for any other Pt-based catalysts in refractory oxide support."
          [141] "The unprecedented performance of Pt/Na[Fe]-ZSM-5 was attributed to its high Pt dispersion (cluster size < 1 mm) on zeolite through ion-exchange."
          [142] "There is a tendency to generate some Brnsted protons on the zeolite during the exchange process, but the choice of Fe3 + as an isomorphous cation in place of Al3 + led to weaker Brnsted sites in [Fe]-ZSM compared to [Al]-ZSM."
          [143] "The weaker acidity minimizes the tendency of side reactions (cracking of oligomerization, aromatisation, and coke), which translates into higher alkene selectivity and catalyst stability."
          [144] "In another report, Xuebing and Iglesia demonstrated the ability of Pt/Na[Fe]-ZSM-5 to dehydrogenate alkanes longer than C4; n-pentane and n-heptane were selectively converted to n-pentene and n-heptene, respectively."
          [145] "Alkene selectivity was also improved when the residual proton generated during Pt exchange or Na-[Fe]-ZSM was titrated with Cs."
          [146] "Although Pt with conventional refractory oxides (Al2O3, SiO2, ZrO2, etc.) used for dehydrogenation of alkanes has similar conversion rates to Pt/Na[Fe]-ZSM-5, deactivation rates are also rapid due to coke formation."
          [147] "The presence of acid (Bronsted and Lewis) sites on the supports promotes readsorption, oligomerization and aromatisation of alkenes."
          [148] "Promotion of Pt with metals, such as Sn, Ga, Zn, Re, etc., improves catalyst stability, but also leads to faster deactivation rates than Pt/Na[Fe]-ZSM-5."
          [149] "However, recent reports by Bell et al."
          [150] "show that the use of calcined hydrotalcite (Al/Mg  0.1) supported on bimetallic PtGa or PtSn gave very high alkene selectivity and stability, comparable to Pt/Na[Fe]-ZSM-5."
          [151] "At this stage, we can conclude that differences in the performance of Zn and Ga exchanged H-ZSM-5 obtained by Kanansky et al."
          [152] "are attributable to their respective CH activation mechanisms."
          [153] "In addition, the role of exchanged Zn and Ga as promoters of RD becomes evident from the mechanisms (Scheme 2)."
          [154] "The RD mechanism on Ga exchanged H-ZSM-5 is by reductive elimination of a hydrogen molecule from O[Ga(H)2]+ intermediate."
          [155] "Decomposition of ZnR and a protonic site, or neutralization of the proton sites by ZnH, leads to desorption of the hydrogen molecule on the Zn-exchanged H-ZSM-5."
          [156] "By extrapolation, the mechanisms of CH activation on exchanged Zn and Ga H-ZSM-5 can described the mechanism of alkane dehydrogenation on Cr-based and Pt-based catalysts respectively."
          [157] "The electronic promotion effect of Sn is in line with the oxidative addition CH activation mechanism."
          [158] "However, the Lewis base-assisted deprotonation mechanism could also explain the proposed CH activation on Cr-based catalysts."
          [159] "Now, the nature and the role of surface oxygen species become more evident."
          [160] "The role of potassium in commercial Cr and Pt-based dehydrogenation catalysts is to minimize the undesired influence of protonic sites on alkene selectivity."
          [161] "The highlights in this section are presented in Table 2."
          [162] "The table reveals the insights achieved on the reaction mechanism, alkene selectivity and catalyst stability for non-oxidative dehydrogenation of lower alkanes."
          [163] "Nonetheless, the level of catalyst activity is still far from acceptable, even at high temperature."
          [164] "A recent report by Rothenberg et al."
          [165] "provides a lead in this respect."
          [166] "Their report indicates that a porous copperaluminum framework material (stabilized by metal oxide) has better performance (activity/selectivity/stability) for propane dehydrogenation than a PtSn/Al2O3."
          [167] "Of particular interest, is the suggestion that achieving propane dehydrogenation at 350 C may be possible."
          [168] "Few details are known about the structure of the porous copperaluminum framework material."
          [169] "However, copper is implicated as providing the active sites for the catalysis."
          [170] "Also, that the material activated in oxygen gave higher propane conversion rates than those activated in inert gas atmosphere underscores the role of the surface oxide (oxygen species) in the catalysis."
          [171] "Thus, the Lewis base-assisted deprotonation mechanism may be invoked here, and the redox property of the metal center is likely to play a role in achieving propane dehydrogenation at 350 C."
          [172] "This should constitute the future research direction for non-oxidative dehydrogenation of lower alkanes."
          [173] "Although the equilibrium conversion of alkanes increases with temperature, alkene selectivity decreases with increasing temperature and chain length due to an increased tendency toward dehydrocyclization/aromatisation, thermal cracking and coke formation."
          [174] "Direct dehydrogenation of lower alkanes is an energy intensive reaction; however, oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) has the potential to lower the energy requirement for achieving dehydrogenation."
          [175] "ODH can be considered as tandem endothermic (dehydrogenation, CnH2n + 2  CnH2n + H2) and exothermic (oxidation, H2 + O2  H2O) processes, with an overall thermodynamic summation, CnH2n + 2 + O2  CnH2n + H2O."
          [176] "Although the process is not thermo-neutral, part of the energy required for the endothermic reaction is augmented by the exothermic reaction."
          [177] "Thus, ODH of alkanes takes place at lower temperature compared to the corresponding non-ODH."
          [178] "This lower temperature requirement of ODH compared to non-ODH and cracking is encouraging and provides motivation for continued efforts to develop ODH into an industrial technology."
          [179] "Although ODH is attractive because of the energy intensification advantage, commercial ODH technologies hinge on innovative catalyst and process design, i.e. proper synergy of the endothermic dehydrogenation step with the exothermic hydrogen combustion and design of selective CH and hydrogen combustion catalysts."
          [180] "In this report, we provide an overview on CH activation and reaction routes to alkane dehydrogenation."
          [181] "We seek to gain insights about components of the active sites of CH activation to provide a platform for rational design of new efficient catalysts for dehydrogenation of lower alkanes."
          [182] "We focus on propane dehydrogenation because of the need for alternative and/or complementary technology for propene production to supplement existing technologies."
          [183] "We survey non-oxidative and oxidative dehydrogenation approaches, and examine reaction routes that are intermediate between these two main approaches."
          [184] "Although the equilibrium conversion of alkanes increases with temperature, alkene selectivity decreases with increasing temperature and chain length due to an increased tendency toward dehydrocyclization/aromatisation, thermal cracking and coke formation."

[1] "Although there are other metallic reforming catalysts such as Ru and Rh, which are less strongly prone to coking than Ni,129 Ni is one of the most common reforming catalysts, which is partly due to its significantly cheaper price. In order to overcome the coking problem of Ni catalysts, numerous theoretical studies have been conducted to understand the coke formation on nickel and to come up with potential strategies to avoid the unwanted coking process."
          [2] "It could be shown that the adsorption of C atoms on the closed packed surface of a NiAu surface alloy is thermodynamically less favoured, by 23 kJ mol1 or more, than the analogous process on a pure Ni(111) surface.134 Based on this finding, it has been proposed to alloy Ni with Au.134 A cheaper alternative is to alloy Ni with Sn which hinders the CC bond formation and enhances the CO bond formation leading to the removal of surface C centers as carbon monoxide.135,136 It has been discussed that the Sn atoms separate the Ni centers on the catalyst surface, which tend to bind C atoms, from each other. With the Ni centers being separated, the C atoms on the surface are separated as well, which hinders the formation of coke.135,136 These theoretical results are consistent with experiments which show that pure Ni catalysts deactivate significantly faster than NiSn alloy based catalysts.135 Since the step sites play an essential role in the growth of the graphene islands, as mentioned above, additives such as potassium,66 sulfur,66 gold66 or boron131 have been proposed.66 Computational calculations have shown that these elements tend to occupy the step sites and thus avoid the formation of graphene islands.66,131 A similar strategy, by blocking the crucial sites, has been proposed to prevent the formation of a carbidic phase. Calculations have shown that boron prefers the same sub-surface sites on Ni as C.137 By occupying these sites with B, the diffusion of C to these sub-surface sites and the formation of the thermodynamically more stable carbide phase can be prevented.128 Apart from blocking the sub-surface sites, sub-surface boron in Ni(111) also has been shown to have an destabilizing effect on on-surface C centers,138 which may help to prevent the accumulation of C atoms on the surface."
          [3] "Although supported Pt catalysts show high activity, the catalyst deactivation due to coke formation remains a challenging issue."
          [4] "The robustness against coking can be increased with additional promoters, such as late transition metals, main-group metals including Sn and Ga, alkali-metal oxides and rare-earth metal oxides."
          [5] "It has been demonstrated for graphene islands on the Ni(111) surface, unsaturated C atoms at the edge of a graphene island are less stable than isolated C atoms on the metal surface."
          [6] "A cheaper alternative is to alloy Ni with Sn which hinders the CC bond formation and enhances the CO bond formation leading to the removal of surface C centers as carbon monoxide."
          [7] "Since the step sites play an essential role in the growth of the graphene islands, as mentioned above, additives such as potassium, sulfur, gold or boron have been proposed."
          [8] "Apart from blocking the sub-surface sites, sub-surface boron in Ni(111) also has been shown to have an destabilizing effect on on-surface C centers, which may help to prevent the accumulation of C atoms on the surface."

[1] "A catalyst design consisting of the double-decoration of nanoparticulate intermetallic PtGa with Pb and Ca was applied to produce an ultra-stable catalyst for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) at a high temperature."
          [2] "PtGaCaPb/SiO2 exhibited outstanding catalytic stability in PDH at 600C, and almost no deactivation was observed for up to 1month."
          [3] "Herein, we report a novel catalyst design concept, namely, the double decoration of PtGa intermetallics by Pb and Ca, which synergize the geometric and electronic promotion effects on the catalyst stability, respectively."
          [4] "Pb is deposited on the three-fold Pt3 sites of the PtGa nanoparticles to block them, whereas Ca, which affords an electron-enriched single-atom-like Pt1 site, is placed around the nanoparticles."
          [5] "Thus, PtGaCaPb/SiO2 exhibits an outstandingly high catalytic stability, even at 600C (kd=0.00033h1, τ=3067h), and almost no deactivation of the catalyst was observed for up to 1month for the first time."

[1] "To expose the loaded Pt on the surface of the carriers, ion exchange and impregnation are two simple and practical methods. The dispersion of Pt mainly depends on the precursors of Pt, the preparation conditions, the properties of the carriers, and the interaction between Pt and the carriers, as well as the additives."
          [2] "The addition of a second metal has been found to be highly effective for the sintering resistance of Pt particles. The introduced metal forms alloys with Pt around Pt particles,63 and the alloys anchor them on the surface of the carriers, making them not easy to migrate and coalesce."
          [3] "The application of the carriers possessing a strong interaction with Pt is another way to retard the sintering. Al2O3 is the most common carrier of Pt catalyst, in which the coordinatively unsaturated pentacoordinate Al3+ can anchor Pt to make it not easy to migrate."
          [4] "Nanocarbon was also reported as the carrier of Pt to improve the sintering resistance, and the strong metalcarrier interaction leads to the electron transfer from nanocarbon to the Pt particles, significantly preventing the sintering of Pt."
          [5] "MgAl2O4 spinel is also a good choice as the carrier. Generally, Pt is not directly loaded on MgAl2O4 spinel prepared beforehand, but firstly loaded into the spaces between the layers of MgAlOx hydrotalcite, and then Pt particles are enclosed in the interspace of MgAl2O4 spinel formed through the collapse of the layered structure of the hydrotalcite after calcination at high temperature."
          [6] "Moliner et al.67 reported effective methods to encapsulate Pt in highly siliceous chabazite, and the catalyst showed enhanced stability towards Pt sintering even at 650750 C in the atmospheres of H2, O2 and H2O."
          [7] "The Al2O3 overcoat has also proved to be efficient in preventing the sintering of Pt nanoparticles through atomic layer deposition."
          [8] "Tanabe et al. revealed that no Pt sintering was observed for Pt/MgO as an automotive exhaust catalyst after calcination in air at 900 C, for the formation of a Mg2PtO4-like compound prevents the migration of Pt."
          [9] "Nagai et al. found that CeO2 had a similar effect of MgO in preventing the sintering of Pt due to the formation of the PtOCe bond in the Pt/CeO2 catalyst."
          [10] "Recently, Pt supported on CeO2 has attracted more attention because of the ability of CeO2 to trap Pt in an atomically dispersed state."
          [11] "The atomically dispersed Pt is most likely to be present in the form of Pt2+ bonded to the ubiquitous step edges of the CeO2 surface."
          [12] "The addition of Ga, In, Zn, Cu, Ir, Co to Pt catalysts exhibits similar effects as Sn."
          [13] "Not only that, but Sattler et al.84 showed that in the highly active, selective and stable PtGaK/Al2O3 (0.1 wt% Pt, 3 wt% Ga, 0.25 wt% K) catalyst for the dehydrogenation of propane, the coordinately unsaturated Ga3+ is responsible for activating the CH bond, and Pt only acts as a promoter."
          [14] "Furthermore, just like the PtSn/CeO2 catalyst,29 the reactivity can be fully recovered via simple coke burning in air, although the sintering of Pt still occurs."
          [15] "Located at the same main group with Ga, In was also reported to be the promoter of supported Pt catalysts. The PtIn/Mg(Al)O catalyst prepared at pH 8 using the co-precipitation method exhibits the best catalytic performance and the strongest interaction between the metal phase and the carrier."
          [16] "B and Si, two nonmetal elements, can play similar roles, too. Dehydrogenation of n-butane over the PtB/SiO2 catalyst showed improved catalytic activity and stability compared with Pt/SiO2."
          [17] "Dadras et al.86 called B a magic bullet against sintering and coking, and they summarized the positive roles of B as follows. The non-stoichiometric PtB cluster is anchored to the carrier via a covalent BO bond, which is much stronger than the interaction between Pt clusters and the carrier surface."
          [18] "Additionally, the dissociation energy of a Pt atom from a PtB cluster is significantly larger than that from the pure Pt cluster, increasing the sintering resistance."
          [19] "Finally, the affinity of PtB cluster to C also drops dramatically, leading to the reduced coke formation and increased selectivity to olefins."
          [20] "It is predicted by a computational screening of main-group elements as potential additives for the Pt catalyst that Si, just as B, can modify the selectivity of the Pt catalyst by changing both electronic and geometric properties."

[1] "In this review, we outline the progress of these dehydrogenation catalysts that have been mainly developed in the past five years. For different classes of the most-promising catalysts in the selective dehydrogenation of ethane-to-ethylene and propane-to-propylene, their syntheses, structural information, catalytic properties and mechanisms are comparatively summarized."

          [5] "The synthesis chemistry contributes to the stabilization effect of Pt through strong PtOCe bonds."
          [6] "The synthesis strategy has been reported for the zeolite-confined Pt single-atom and nanocluter catalysts with high stability."
          [7] "The synthesis procedure can maintain the porous texture and anchor the active Pt-based metals."
          [8] "The synthesis method is used to prepare uniform PtIn bimetal nanoparticles."

          [12] "The synthesis method allows it to serve as a potent ion-exchanger, resulting in the stabilization of the highly dispersed bimetallic PtZn sites by the ETS-2 support."

[1] "To improve the stability of Pt-based catalysts, many efforts have been dedicated to strengthen metalsupport interactions by using various methods including the nanopore-encaged metal strategy,2124 wet-chemistry approach2529 and modification of supports.10,11,30,31 Among them, modification of supports is a relatively effective and simple method to improve the stability of Pt-based catalysts."
          [2] "For example, Lu et al. reported a PtSn/Al2O3 sheet catalyst for PDH, exhibiting high activity, selectivity and stability.11 It was proposed that the enhanced stability in PDH was associated with γ-Al2O3 nanosheets containing a great deal of pentacoordinate Al3+ ions, which can stabilize PtSn clusters by strong interactions between metals and supports."
          [3] "Recent work by Ma et al. showed that the addition of Ga into Mg(Al)O layer double hydrotalcites could greatly enhance the stability of Pt catalysts in PDH.10 It may be due to the fact that pentacoordinate Ga3+ ions could disperse and stabilize PtSn clusters, thereby enhancing the electronic interactions between Pt and Ga."
          [4] "A similar conclusion regarding the importance of modification of supports has been reported in the case of PtSn/CeO2 catalysts.30"
          [5] "Therefore, this provides a way to tune and enhance the catalytic activity and selectivity for the PDH process, and also introduces unique stability characteristics for bimetallic systems."
          [6] "Herein, highly stable Pt/Sn-Si-beta catalysts for PDH were prepared by an improved post-synthesis strategy, which consists of dealumination of H-beta and subsequent metal impregnation."
          [7] "It is indicated that Sn species existing in tetrahedral coordination states were incorporated into the framework of dealuminated beta (Si-beta)."
          [8] "Meanwhile, Pt species were highly dispersed in the form of ultra-small nanoclusters on Pt/Sn-Si-beta due to the strong interaction between Pt and Sn(IV) sites confined in the Si-beta framework."
          [9] "The prepared Pt/Sn-Si-beta catalysts show excellent catalytic performance for PDH, in which the propene formation rate was 2.3 mol g1Pt h1 with a propene selectivity of >99% at 550 C and the higher propene formation rate was 3.1 mol g1Pt h1 at 600 C."
          [10] "Moreover, the strong PtSn interactions and the confinement effect of Sn in the Si-beta framework inhibit the coke and sintering of Pt clusters, thereby achieving good stability of dehydrogenation and regeneration with almost unchanged catalytic activity during four cycles at 550 C."



[1] "Although the direct dehydrogenation technique has been industrialized, the fabrication of the corresponding catalysts is still confronted with a series of plights."
          [2] "Decades have witnessed the efforts made and strategies proposed by devoted researchers to optimize the catalyst performance and improve the catalytic stability from a wide panorama."

[1] "Extensive research efforts have been made to inhibit deactivation and improve propene selectivity of Pt-based catalysts by doping promoters of Sn [9,10], In [11,12], Ga [13,14] and Cu [15] to form bimetallic catalysts."
          [2] "For example, PtIn [16] and PtGa [17,18] bimetallic nanoparticles (NPs) supported on calcined hydrotalcites (HT) show higher activity and selectivity in PDH, which has been attributed to the increased Pt dispersion and electron transfer from In or Ga to Pt [11,18]."
          [3] "Besides promoters, another method is to modify Al2O3 support with ZnO [19], La2O3 [20] or TiO2 [21] or replace Al2O3 support with ZnAl2O4 [22], ZSM-5 [23] or Mg(Al)O oxide [8,24]."
          [4] "Additionally, it has been verified that the single Pt atom sites on Pt-Sn/γ-Al2O3 with a sandwich structure are more favorable for PDH reaction than Pt ensembles [25,26]."
          [5] "Gong et al. [15] also reported that the PtCu single atom alloys can enhance the propane conversion and propene selectivity simultaneously in PDH."
          [6] "Whether as promoters or supports, an important aim of using them is to obtain highly and stably dispersed Pt-based catalysts so that improving PDH performance."
          [7] "However, it is still difficult to break through these challenges for PDH reactions [27], and the exact Pt-M-support relationship is still unclear."
          [8] "Therefore, it is extremely necessary to find more efficient methods to solve the problems mentioned above."
          [9] "In fact, the hierarchical morphology and porous structure play important roles in many heterogeneous catalytic reactions. However, the effect of hierarchical microstructure is seldom reported."
          [10] "Given that the small Pt NPs and hierarchical microstructure may provide more stable and easily accessible active sites for PDH reaction, a promising design for obtaining the desired size of active Pt and hierarchical pore morphology was proposed."
          [11] "The promoted effects of HT reconstruction on the microstructure and morphology of the 3D oxide nanosheet array catalyst, and the subsequently superior PDH performance, were profoundly discussed."

Stable and selective catalysts for propane dehydrogenation operating at thermodynamic limit Hitting the limits on propene synthesis The greater abundance of propane from shale gas has spurred efforts to use it as a propylene feedstock. Direct dehydrogenation catalysts consisting of platinumtin alloy nanoparticles supported on alumina often must run with hydrogen dilution to avoid carbon buildup and excess tin to avoid alloy segregation.
          We report that silica-supported platinum-tin (Pt1Sn1) nanoparticles (&lt;2 nanometers in diameter) can operate as a PDH catalyst at thermodynamically limited conversion levels, with excellent stability and selectivity to propylene (&gt;99%). Atomic mixing of Pt and Sn in the precursor is preserved upon reduction and during catalytic operation. The benign interaction of these nanoparticles with the silicon dioxide support does not lead to Pt-Sn segregation and formation of a tin oxide phase that can occur over traditional catalyst supports.
          To alleviate this issue, large quantities of Sn are used in the catalyst preparation (the nominal atomic loading is Sn:Pt between 4 and 5), which increases the yield of intermetallic PtSn NPs (12). In addition, studies have shown that adding hydrogen to the reactant feed reduces the rate of catalyst deactivation (13). Although this strategy is implemented commercially (10), addition of hydrogen in the feed lowers the thermodynamic limit on per-pass propane conversion (fig. S1) and decreases productivity (7).
          We developed a PDH catalyst that operates at thermodynamically limited conversion levels without the addition of hydrogen to the feed and exhibits excellent stability and selectivity to propylene (&gt;99%). The catalyst is composed of silica-supported Pt1Sn1 NPs, synthesized and pretreated to ensure that the mixing of Pt and Sn is preserved during catalytic operation.
          The principle behind catalyst synthesis is to begin with a heterometallic Pt-Sn coordination complex in which Pt and Sn are in immediate contact, and this interaction is retained during the reduction and PDH reaction.
          The data in Fig. 1, A to C, were obtained with 16 vol % propane in helium. Propane streams are diluted in commercial operations to increase the limiting equilibrium conversion, which is higher at lower propane partial pressure (fig. S2), and to limit catalyst deactivation rates (7, 16, 17). This approach requires additional downstream separation units and limits process efficiency.
          The data in Fig. 1, A to C, show the performance of the Pt1Sn1/SiO2 catalyst (1 wt % Pt and 0.6 wt % Sn) for propane dehydrogenation at 580C, 16 vol % propane (with the remainder helium) and at a weight hourly space velocity (WHSV) of 4.7 hours1. Under these reaction conditions, the thermodynamic limit on propane conversion is 66.5% (fig. S2). The Pt1Sn1/SiO2 catalyst showed near-thermodynamic conversion of &gt;66% (Fig. 1A, red circles) and &gt;99% selectivity to propylene (Fig. 1B, red circles).
          The data in Fig. 1D show that, under these conditions, the propane conversion goes from 41 to 39% in 120 min. Under identical conditions, the other tested catalysts deactivate very rapidly to very low conversion, as illustrated for the commercial mimic. A transmission electron microscopy (TEM) image of the spent catalyst, after 120 min of PDH reaction, is shown in fig. S6. The image shows that the Pt-Sn NPs are well dispersed, with an average particle diameter of 1.6  0.67 nm, which is consistent with the particle size in fresh samples.
          We attempted to regenerate the Pt1Sn1/SiO2 catalyst by oxidation, using 1% O2 as a mild oxidant at 500C followed by reduction at 600C (see supplementary materials for details of the regeneration procedure). The regeneration studies showed that Pt1Sn1/SiO2 catalysts can be partially regenerated. For example, we measured 97% of the initial activity and &gt;99% of the initial selectivity after three PDH/regeneration cycles (fig. S5).
          Data in Fig. 3A show that the process of mixing chloroplatinic acid (H2PtCl6) and tin(II) chloride (SnCl2) in 0.1 M hydrochloric acid solution formed a heterometallic Pt-Sn coordination complex.
          A bright-field TEM image of Pt-Sn NPs formed on SiO2 upon the reduction of the Pt-Sn complex shows high metal dispersion on the support, with an average NP size of 1.3  0.6 nm (Fig. 3B). The NP size distribution (Fig. 3C) shows that most NPs were &lt;2 nm. The XRD spectra in Fig. 3D show that the formed NPs were essentially alloys of Pt and Sn. This finding is supported by the presence of the XRD peaks corresponding to Pt1Sn1 (41.8 and 44.1) and Pt3Sn1 (39.0 and 45.3) stoichiometries.
          The real-space Pt LIII EXAFS spectra for the Pt1Sn1/SiO2 catalyst (Fig. 4D) are substantially different from the spectra of monometallic Pt and indicate the mixing of Pt and Sn atoms. The best-fit spectrum for the Pt1Sn1/SiO2 catalyst is characterized by the presence of the Pt-Pt and Pt-Sn scattering paths, consistent with the formation of PtSn intermetallic phases.

          [2] "Herein, a series of highly ordered mesoporous Al2O3 supports with different levels of Al3+penta sites, are fabricated and used as the support to disperse Pt-Sn2 clusters."
          [3] "The stability and regenerability of Pt-Sn2/meso-Al2O3 are strongly dependent on the content of Al3+penta sites in the Al2O3 structure, and a high level of Al3+penta sites can effectively prevent the agglomeration of Pt-Sn2 clusters into large Pt nanoparticles in the consecutive dehydrogenation-regeneration cycles."



[1] "Rare-earthplatinum alloy nanoparticles in mesoporous zeolite for catalysis Platinum is a much used catalyst that, in petrochemical processes, is often alloyed with other metals to improve catalytic activity, selectivity and longevity1,2,3,4,5."
          [2] "Such catalysts are usually prepared in the form of metallic nanoparticles supported on porous solids, and their production involves reducing metal precursor compounds under a H2 flow at high temperatures6."
          [3] "The method works well when using easily reducible late transition metals, but Pt alloy formation with rare-earth elements through the H2 reduction route is almost impossible owing to the low chemical potential of rare-earth element oxides6."
          [4] "Here we use as support a mesoporous zeolite that has pore walls with surface framework defects (called silanol nests) and show that the zeolite enables alloy formation between Pt and rare-earth elements."
          [5] "We find that the silanol nests enable the rare-earth elements to exist as single atomic species with a substantially higher chemical potential compared with that of the bulk oxide, making it possible for them to diffuse onto Pt."
          [6] "High-resolution transmission electron microscopy and hydrogen chemisorption measurements indicate that the resultant bimetallic nanoparticles supported on the mesoporous zeolite are intermetallic compounds, which we find to be stable, highly active and selective catalysts for the propane dehydrogenation reaction."
          [7] "When used with late transition metals, the same preparation strategy produces Pt alloy catalysts that incorporate an unusually large amount of the second metal and, in the case of the PtCo alloy, show high catalytic activity and selectivity in the preferential oxidation of carbon monoxide in H2."

          [9] "The Pt metal alone exhibits high initial catalytic activity, but rapidly deactivates as a result of coke deposition on the Pt surface."
          [10] "The coke deposition also causes an undesirable loss of the catalytic selectivity to propylene."
          [11] "To alleviate these problems, Sn is introduced to form an alloy with Pt nanoparticles and thereby dilute the Pt surface with inactive Sn atoms and break up coke-generating Pt ensembles."
          [12] "Our search for a highly active and more durable PDH catalyst has focused on using a siliceous MFI zeolite with a hierarchical micro-/mesoporous structure as a replacement for the alumina support."
          [13] "This zeolite, synthesized using a multi-ammonium surfactant as a structure-directing agent, has attracted attention as an advanced catalyst support8,9,10,11,12,13 owing to its unique structure, which comprises ultrathin zeolite frameworks and three-dimensionally interconnected mesopores that boost the catalytic performance of supported metals by providing both facile reactant and product diffusion and high metal nanoparticle dispersion within the mesopores12,13."
          [14] "The formation of the Pt3La and Pt3Y nanoparticles on the degallated zeolite brought a striking enhancement in all aspects of the PDH catalytic performance, including activity, selectivity and durability, as shown in Fig. 2."
          [15] "The catalytic reaction was performed at 580C using a pure propane flow at a large space velocity (see Methods), and these harsh operating conditions caused even the conventional PtSn/alumina catalyst to experience severe coke formation and catalyst deactivation within 1 d."
          [16] "In sharp contrast, the Pt3La intermetallic nanoparticles supported on the degallated zeolite (denoted as PtLa/mz-deGa, where mz stands for mesoporous zeolite) showed a high initial propane conversion of 40% (close to the equilibrium conversion) and underwent extremely slow deactivation, retaining 8% conversion even after 30 days of reaction."
          [17] "The PtREE incorporation in the mesoporous zeolite was conducted by co-impregnation of aqueous solutions of Pt(NH3)4(NO3)2 and either La(NO3)3·6H2O or Y(NO3)3·6H2O, followed by heating under an O2 flow at 350C and subsequently under H2 at 700C (see Methods)."
          [18] "The formation of the Pt3La and Pt3Y nanoparticles on the degallated zeolite brought a striking enhancement in all aspects of the PDH catalytic performance, including activity, selectivity and durability, as shown in Fig. 2."

[1] "Although the equilibrium conversion of alkanes increases with temperature, alkene selectivity decreases with increasing temperature and chain length due to an increased tendency toward dehydrocyclization/aromatisation, thermal cracking and coke formation."
          [2] "Direct dehydrogenation of lower alkanes is an energy intensive reaction; however, oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) has the potential to lower the energy requirement for achieving dehydrogenation."
          [3] "ODH can be considered as tandem endothermic (dehydrogenation, CnH2n + 2  CnH2n + H2) and exothermic (oxidation, H2 + O2  H2O) processes, with an overall thermodynamic summation, CnH2n + 2 + O2  CnH2n + H2O."
          [4] "Although the process is not thermo-neutral, part of the energy required for the endothermic reaction is augmented by the exothermic reaction."
          [5] "Thus, ODH of alkanes takes place at lower temperature compared to the corresponding non-ODH."
          [6] "This lower temperature requirement of ODH compared to non-ODH and cracking is encouraging and provides motivation for continued efforts to develop ODH into an industrial technology."
          [7] "Although ODH is attractive because of the energy intensification advantage, commercial ODH technologies hinge on innovative catalyst and process design, i.e. proper synergy of the endothermic dehydrogenation step with the exothermic hydrogen combustion and design of selective CH and hydrogen combustion catalysts."

          [13] "Developing direct routes to obtain key organic chemicals from lower alkanes would benefit industry."
          [14] "Lower alkanes are relatively inert, and they exhibit little or no reactivity at conditions typical for activating functional group reactions in organic compounds because they lack low-lying vacant orbitals or lone pair electrons."
          [15] "Alkanes are made up non-polar CC and CH bonds. These bonds consist of strongly localised electron pairs that are usually induced to reactivity under severe conditions (e.g., at high temperature or pressure, or with the use of aggressive reagents)."
          [16] "The first and rate-limiting step of alkane dehydrogenation using platinum or chromium oxide-based catalysts involves CH activation."
          [17] "Although a number of efforts have been made to gain insight on the mechanism of the reaction, questions still remain, especially regarding the pathway of the CH activation."
          [18] "It is of fundamental and applied interest to know whether the first CH bond cleavage is homolytic or heterolytic."
          [19] "If it is a heterolytic pathway, it will further be of interest to know whether the first hydrogen from the alkane substrate is abstracted as a proton or as a hydride ion."
          [20] "This knowledge will benefit catalyst improvement efforts."
          [21] "The simple impregnation techniques for preparing supported (especially alumina) metal and oxide catalysts becloud their structural heterogeneity."

          [25] "Although several solid acid catalysts are used in alkane conversions, zeolites have the advantage of possessing a well-defined structure, allowing the structure-activity relationship to be easily deduced."
          [26] "Therefore, it is instructive to examine non-oxidative dehydrogenation of light alkanes over zeolite catalysts."
          [27] "A detailed knowledge of the adsorption mechanism of lower alkane molecules on zeolite is of interest in this context, especially for informed tuning of zeolite properties to allow efficient and selective dehydrogenation of alkanes."
          [28] "Light alkanes are adsorbed on zeolites via dispersive interaction."
          [29] "Protons and the exchanged metals ions are typically the active sites in zeolites, while the zeolite framework plays the role of anchor for the active sites and/or dispersion medium for the reactants."
          [30] "The framework of microporous zeolites exerts dispersive forces on the reactant's molecules that depend on the shape, channel and cavity of the framework."
          [31] "In addition, the nature and the density of the active sites influence the framework dispersion forces."
          [32] "Recent reports have shown that the strong electrostatic field between protons or exchanged metal ions and basic oxygen species can enhance and/or induce polarization of bonds in hydrocarbon adsorbates."

          [34] "Wender et al. showed that 3040% of heat adsorption in n-alkanes on Na-zeolite is due to polarization of the adsorbates."
          [35] "Subbotina et al. also demonstrated that the CH bond of ethane is more strongly polarized on Mg2 + and Ca2 + forms of Y zeolite than on Na+ forms."
          [36] "Mg2 +-Y zeolite molecules exhibit weaker adsorption and polarization of ethane than Ca2 +-zeolites."
          [37] "Based on charge density considerations, Mg2 + cations are expected to exhibit a stronger polarizing effect than Ca2 + cations."
          [38] "Subbotina et al. explain that because of the smaller ionic radius of Mg2 +, it is more strongly shielded by the surrounding oxygen atoms of the zeolite lattice than a Ca2 + ion, thereby reducing the polarizing effect of Mg2 + on the hydrocarbon adsorbate."
          [39] "Sievers et al. also report that the La3 + form of X zeolite induces strong polarization of adsorbed alkane molecules; partial positive charges were induced on secondary and tertiary carbon atoms of alkane molecules."
          [40] "The authors suggest that the polarization may be viewed as an intermediate condition to hydride abstraction (which is an important elementary step in CH activation)."
          [41] "They add that CH bond polarization was enhanced by physisorbed water molecules that coordinate with La3 + cations."
          [42] "The enhanced polarization of CH bonds by the presence of water molecules on La3 +X zeolite may have a beneficial effect in oxidative dehydrogenation where water is a by-product."
          [43] "Alkane polarization studies on Na+, Mg2 +, Ca2 +, and La3 + exchanged X-zeolites indicate that the polarizing effect increases with increasing charge magnitude and ionic radius."
          [44] "Note that these alkane polarizing cations occupy the same position on the zeolites as the well-known CH activation cations/metals, and thus the CH polarizing effect has a complementary effect on CH activation."
          [45] "This may add to the number of relevant variables and increase the challenge of optimizing the ratio of activation/polarizing cations among exchangeable sites (Si/Al ratio), as well as the sequence for incorporating the cations or metals during catalyst preparation."
          [46] "Further, it is important to note that the choice of cations should be such that they exhibit no catalytic (oligomerization, isomerization, aromatisation or oxidation) effects on the target alkene products at the reaction condition."
          [47] "Furthermore, it may be beneficial to create a CH polarization effect on the zeolite framework."
          [48] "This can be achieved by appropriate chance of framework atoms."
          [49] "Since active sites are usually created on the zeolite frameworks."
          [50] "The activation of CH bonds of light alkanes occurs readily on super electrophiles (super Brnsted and super Lewis acid) at low temperatures."

          [52] "Several experimental and theoretical studies on the molecular dynamics of light alkanes on zeolite have been published."
          [53] "However, despite the decades of intensive investigations on the subject, the actual mechanism of CH activation on acid zeolite is still debated."
          [54] "Two CH activation paths are generally recognized: the unimolecular/protolytic mechanism and the bimolecular/carbenium chain mechanism."
          [55] "The unimolecular mechanism involves direct protonation of an alkane-forming carbonium ion intermediate."
          [56] "The proton can be inserted into either a CC or CH bond of the alkane."
          [57] "Proton insertion through the CC bond leads to cracking of the alkane, with the acid site regenerated."
          [58] "Insertion through the HC bond yields H2 and a carbenium ion/alkoxide intermediate."
          [59] "Desorption of alkene from the intermediate regenerates the acid, or the alkoxide can enter the bimolecular conversion path."
          [60] "In the bimolecular mechanism of CH activation, the alkoxide intermediate constitutes the active sites and CH activation occurs through hydride transfer from a second alkane molecule forming another alkoxide."
          [61] "This may be followed by βscission to regenerate the active site and complete the catalytic cycle."
          [62] "For example, activation of propane on acid zeolite based on the two mechanisms is illustrated in Scheme 1."
          [63] "Low reactant partial pressure and high temperature favor unimolecular dehydrogenation of alkane on acid zeolite."
          [64] "These conditions favor the endothermic desorption step (rate limiting step) leading to propene."
          [65] "In contrast, high partial pressure and low temperature favor the bimolecular mechanism leading to a low propene yield."
          [66] "The two molecular mechanisms devoid of side reactions give fairly predictable product distribution."
          [67] "However, the products of each route are prone to side reactions (dimerization, oligomerization, isomerization & aromatisation) in the presence of Bronsted acid sites."
          [68] "Hence propene selectivity on acidic zeolite is very low and products rich in aromatics are usually obtained."
          [69] "The active sites (alkoxide intermediate) of the bimolecular pathway are formed in situ."
          [70] "The alkoxide intermediate is made up of an alkyl carbenium ion ionically held to the zeolite framework oxygen ion."
          [71] "The active sites of the unimolecular pathway are the charge balancing protons of the zeolite framework."
          [72] "A proton and a carbenium ion are an electrophilic or Lewis acid species (a proton can also be considered as a special case of Lewis acidity)."
          [73] "The two pathways essentially involve electrophilic CH activation."
          [74] "The electrophiles (proton and carbenium ion) activate CH at high temperatures (500 C), giving low conversion rates of light alkanes and poor selectivity to corresponding alkenes."
          [75] "Iglesia and co-workers used isotopic labeling studies to demonstrate that CH activation is not the rate-limiting step in the dehydrogenation of propane on H-ZSM-5 and Ga/H-ZSM-5."
          [76] "They proposed that the CH bond cleavage produces an H-adatom and an alkoxide intermediate."
          [77] "Desorption of an alkene from the alkoxide regenerates the proton sites on the zeolites."
          [78] "An alkoxide intermediate may also discharge as a hydrogen rich species through cracking."
          [79] "Iglesia et al. proposed that desorption or disposal of the H-adatom from the CH bond cleavage is the rate-limiting step."
          [80] "A similar deduction was reached by Yu et al."
          [81] "who found that desorption of the alkoxides intermediate is the rate-limiting step under conditions that favor the unimolecular mechanism."
          [82] "The above proposition has been demonstrated on metal (e.g., Ga, Zn, and Co) exchanged zeolites."
          [83] "The specific role of the exchanged metals has been the subject of several reports with special attention on Ga and Zn."
          [84] "Although the framework Ga2O3 on H-MFI seems to have a CH polarization effect on desorbed methane, Ga2O3 exhibits lower CH activation activity."
          [85] "The physical mixture of Ga2O3/HMFI displays higher propane aromatisation activity than pure H-MFI."
          [86] "Similar synergistic effects have been reported for Zn/H-MFI and Co/H-MFI."
          [87] "Exchanged cations behave as monomeric species at the exchange sites of zeolite."
          [88] "Iglesia and Biscardi hypothesized that the monomeric species enhance propane conversion by promoting re-combinative desorption (RD) of the H-adatom formed from the CH cleavage."
          [89] "It is worthwhile noting that the exchange cations (electrophilic species) constitute the CH activation sites."
          [90] "Hence, more insights are required about their additional role in promoting RD."
          [91] "However, the authors did not provide further information on the nature of the H-adatoms and the mechanism of RD."
          [92] "In the next section, we examine the mechanism of desorption of H-adatoms over Ga and Zn exchanged H-ZSM-5."
          [93] "The exchanged metal ions in zeolites are held ionically by one or more basic oxygen atoms."
          [94] "Different species have been suggested, depending on the density of the cation exchange site of the zeolite and method of introduction of the metals."
          [95] "According to Kanansky et al."
          [96] "the exchanged Zn and Ga species on H-ZSM-5 and their mechanism of CH activation are distinctively different."
          [97] "Zn and Ga are introduced on H-ZSM-5 through a vapor deposition technique using Zn metal vapor and Ga(CH3)3 as the source of Zn and Ga, respectively."
          [98] "The metal introduction technique allows quantitative exchange of the zeolite protons which leads to Zn/Al = 0.5 and Ga/Al = 1, respectively."
          [99] "Zn2 + is generated directly, but Ga+ is produced by H2 treatment at 500 C to release the methyl groups."

          [102] "The proposed mechanism is in agreement with the mechanism suggested from calculations using the GAUSSIAN 94 program for ethane activation on Zn-exchanged zeolite by Frash and van Santen."
          [103] "In another theoretical study using a DFT cluster modeling approach, Pidko and van Santen compared the activation energy of CH with three types of Zn species at active sites: OZn2+O, OZn+OZn+O and HOZn+ O."
          [104] "The authors suggest that the reaction proceeds most easily on OZn2+O, and hypothesize that the enhanced Lewis activity of OZn2+O facilitates CH heterolytic cleavage."
          [105] "They further argue that the first proton abstraction occurs preferentially on the oxygen sites neighboring the ring where the cation is located."
          [106] "They proposed a one-step reaction to yield H2 and C2H4 from the decomposition of the Zn-alkyl and proton."
          [107] "A proposed mechanism of CH activation on OGa+ has similarly been suggested using theoretical calculations."
          [108] "High alkene selectivities are obtained on the H-ZSM-5 when exchangeable protons are rigorously replaced by Zn and Ga."
          [109] "The Zn-exchanged H-ZSM-5 had higher ethane conversion rates but lower ethene selectivity than its Ga counterpart."
          [110] "The CH activation on the OZn2+O site can be described by a Lewis base-assisted deprotonation mechanism."
          [111] "This is accompanied by conversion of the Lewis base site to a conjugate Bronsted acid site."
          [112] "The OGa+ site, however, activates the CH bond via oxidative addition without a protonic site intermediate."
          [113] "A protonic site intermediate increases tendency of side reactions on the Zn-exchanged H-ZSM-5 relative to the Ga counterpart."
          [114] "The elementary steps of CH activation on OGa+ (Scheme 2) reveal that a redox cycle at the metal center is required for catalytic CH activation via the oxidative addition mechanism."
          [115] "A redox cycle is not apparent in the elementary step presented for CH activation on OZn2+O."
          [116] "Hence, a redox cycle is not a requisite for CH activation via the Lewis base-assisted deprotonation mechanism."
          [117] "However, under alkane dehydrogenation reaction conditions, the OZn2+O sites can undergo a reversible Zn2 +/Zn redox process."
          [118] "This redox process increases the availability of undesired protonic site intermediates."
          [119] "Zn-exchanged H-ZSM-5 prepared by conventional ion-exchange methods contain a significant percentage of unexchanged proton sites leading to lower alkene selectivity of the catalyst."
          [120] "Iglesia and Biscardi titrate the proton sites with NaOH."
          [121] "The un-titrated and the titrated catalysts are denoted as Zn/H-ZSMS-5 and Zn/Na-ZSMS-5, respectively."
          [122] "Zn/Na-ZSM-5 has four times the propane conversion rate and a higher propene selectivity than Zn/H-ZSMS-5."
          [123] "The propene formation rate obtained with Zn/Na-ZSM-5 was ten times that of Zn/H-ZSMS-5."
          [124] "The zinc species at the cation exchange site of the zeolite was identified as OZn+OH."
          [125] "The higher propene selectivity obtained on Zn/Na-ZSM-5 compared to Zn/H-ZSMS-5 is presumably from the lower density and availability of proton sites on Zn/Na-ZSM-5."
          [126] "The improved propane conversion rate of Zn/Na-ZSM-5 compared to Zn/H-ZSM-5 is attributable to the higher efficiency of OZn+OH sites in catalyzing desorption of H-adatoms than OZn2+O sites."
          [127] "Another strategy to enhance alkene selectivity is by controlling the strength of the proton sites."
          [128] "The acidity of the sites depends on the nature of the trivalent cation of the zeolite framework."
          [129] "Proton sites in borosilicate zeolites are weaker than those of aluminosilicate, and thus higher alkene selectivity is expected for alkane dehydrogenation over Zn/H[B]-ZSM-5 compared to Zn/H[Al]-ZSM-5."
          [130] "However, Zn/H[B]-ZSM-5 shows no activity for propane dehydrogenation."
          [131] "The desired weaker acidity of the proton sites of Zn/H[B]-ZSM-5 requires weaker basicity of the oxygen atoms in the zeolite framework."
          [132] "This reduced basicity of the oxygen atoms is not sufficiently polarizing to complement the exchanged Zn2 + in CH bond cleavage."
          [133] "In the next section, we examine use of zeolite support to design a Pt-based alkane dehydrogenation catalyst."
          [134] "Elimination of the proton sites of zeolites is critical for obtaining a high alkene selectivity and stability in dehydrogenation catalysts."
          [135] "Pt is the most versatile noble metal catalyst for alkane reactions."
          [136] "Although Pt is expensive, the choice of Pt is often justified by its higher activity, stability and selectivity for these reactions compared to less expensive alternative transition metals."
          [137] "However, rapid catalyst deactivation due to coke formation remains a challenge even when using a Pt-based catalyst for dehydrogenation of light alkanes."
          [138] "Waku et al."
          [139] "exploited the unique property of zeolite as a support for achieving high metal dispersion through cation exchange sites to create a Pt/Na[Fe]-ZSM-5 catalyst with outstanding stability for dehydrogenation of light alkanes."
          [140] "They found that the catalyst deactivation rate of Pt/Na[Fe]-ZSM-5 was lower than for any other Pt-based catalysts in refractory oxide support."
          [141] "The unprecedented performance of Pt/Na[Fe]-ZSM-5 was attributed to its high Pt dispersion (cluster size < 1 mm) on zeolite through ion-exchange."
          [142] "There is a tendency to generate some Brnsted protons on the zeolite during the exchange process, but the choice of Fe3 + as an isomorphous cation in place of Al3 + led to weaker Brnsted sites in [Fe]-ZSM compared to [Al]-ZSM."
          [143] "The weaker acidity minimizes the tendency of side reactions (cracking of oligomerization, aromatisation, and coke), which translates into higher alkene selectivity and catalyst stability."
          [144] "In another report, Xuebing and Iglesia demonstrated the ability of Pt/Na[Fe]-ZSM-5 to dehydrogenate alkanes longer than C4; n-pentane and n-heptane were selectively converted to n-pentene and n-heptene, respectively."
          [145] "Alkene selectivity was also improved when the residual proton generated during Pt exchange or Na-[Fe]-ZSM was titrated with Cs."
          [146] "Although Pt with conventional refractory oxides (Al2O3, SiO2, ZrO2, etc.) used for dehydrogenation of alkanes has similar conversion rates to Pt/Na[Fe]-ZSM-5, deactivation rates are also rapid due to coke formation."
          [147] "The presence of acid (Bronsted and Lewis) sites on the supports promotes readsorption, oligomerization and aromatisation of alkenes."
          [148] "Promotion of Pt with metals, such as Sn, Ga, Zn, Re, etc., improves catalyst stability, but also leads to faster deactivation rates than Pt/Na[Fe]-ZSM-5."
          [149] "However, recent reports by Bell et al."
          [150] "show that the use of calcined hydrotalcite (Al/Mg  0.1) supported on bimetallic PtGa or PtSn gave very high alkene selectivity and stability, comparable to Pt/Na[Fe]-ZSM-5."
          [151] "At this stage, we can conclude that differences in the performance of Zn and Ga exchanged H-ZSM-5 obtained by Kanansky et al."
          [152] "are attributable to their respective CH activation mechanisms."
          [153] "In addition, the role of exchanged Zn and Ga as promoters of RD becomes evident from the mechanisms (Scheme 2)."
          [154] "The RD mechanism on Ga exchanged H-ZSM-5 is by reductive elimination of a hydrogen molecule from O[Ga(H)2]+ intermediate."
          [155] "Decomposition of ZnR and a protonic site, or neutralization of the proton sites by ZnH, leads to desorption of the hydrogen molecule on the Zn-exchanged H-ZSM-5."
          [156] "By extrapolation, the mechanisms of CH activation on exchanged Zn and Ga H-ZSM-5 can described the mechanism of alkane dehydrogenation on Cr-based and Pt-based catalysts respectively."
          [157] "The electronic promotion effect of Sn is in line with the oxidative addition CH activation mechanism."
          [158] "However, the Lewis base-assisted deprotonation mechanism could also explain the proposed CH activation on Cr-based catalysts."
          [159] "Now, the nature and the role of surface oxygen species become more evident."
          [160] "The role of potassium in commercial Cr and Pt-based dehydrogenation catalysts is to minimize the undesired influence of protonic sites on alkene selectivity."
          [161] "The highlights in this section are presented in Table 2."
          [162] "The table reveals the insights achieved on the reaction mechanism, alkene selectivity and catalyst stability for non-oxidative dehydrogenation of lower alkanes."
          [163] "Nonetheless, the level of catalyst activity is still far from acceptable, even at high temperature."
          [164] "A recent report by Rothenberg et al."
          [165] "provides a lead in this respect."
          [166] "Their report indicates that a porous copperaluminum framework material (stabilized by metal oxide) has better performance (activity/selectivity/stability) for propane dehydrogenation than a PtSn/Al2O3."
          [167] "Of particular interest, is the suggestion that achieving propane dehydrogenation at 350 C may be possible."
          [168] "Few details are known about the structure of the porous copperaluminum framework material."
          [169] "However, copper is implicated as providing the active sites for the catalysis."
          [170] "Also, that the material activated in oxygen gave higher propane conversion rates than those activated in inert gas atmosphere underscores the role of the surface oxide (oxygen species) in the catalysis."
          [171] "Thus, the Lewis base-assisted deprotonation mechanism may be invoked here, and the redox property of the metal center is likely to play a role in achieving propane dehydrogenation at 350 C."
          [172] "This should constitute the future research direction for non-oxidative dehydrogenation of lower alkanes."
          [173] "Although the equilibrium conversion of alkanes increases with temperature, alkene selectivity decreases with increasing temperature and chain length due to an increased tendency toward dehydrocyclization/aromatisation, thermal cracking and coke formation."
          [174] "Direct dehydrogenation of lower alkanes is an energy intensive reaction; however, oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) has the potential to lower the energy requirement for achieving dehydrogenation."
          [175] "ODH can be considered as tandem endothermic (dehydrogenation, CnH2n + 2  CnH2n + H2) and exothermic (oxidation, H2 + O2  H2O) processes, with an overall thermodynamic summation, CnH2n + 2 + O2  CnH2n + H2O."
          [176] "Although the process is not thermo-neutral, part of the energy required for the endothermic reaction is augmented by the exothermic reaction."
          [177] "Thus, ODH of alkanes takes place at lower temperature compared to the corresponding non-ODH."
          [178] "This lower temperature requirement of ODH compared to non-ODH and cracking is encouraging and provides motivation for continued efforts to develop ODH into an industrial technology."
          [179] "Although ODH is attractive because of the energy intensification advantage, commercial ODH technologies hinge on innovative catalyst and process design, i.e. proper synergy of the endothermic dehydrogenation step with the exothermic hydrogen combustion and design of selective CH and hydrogen combustion catalysts."
          [180] "In this report, we provide an overview on CH activation and reaction routes to alkane dehydrogenation."
          [181] "We seek to gain insights about components of the active sites of CH activation to provide a platform for rational design of new efficient catalysts for dehydrogenation of lower alkanes."
          [182] "We focus on propane dehydrogenation because of the need for alternative and/or complementary technology for propene production to supplement existing technologies."
          [183] "We survey non-oxidative and oxidative dehydrogenation approaches, and examine reaction routes that are intermediate between these two main approaches."
          [184] "Although the equilibrium conversion of alkanes increases with temperature, alkene selectivity decreases with increasing temperature and chain length due to an increased tendency toward dehydrocyclization/aromatisation, thermal cracking and coke formation."

          [187] "Despite a large number of reports and many reviews covering different aspects of the subject, and more than two decades of investigations on ODH, gaps still exist between laboratory achievements and industrial implementation."

[1] "Although there are other metallic reforming catalysts such as Ru and Rh, which are less strongly prone to coking than Ni,129 Ni is one of the most common reforming catalysts, which is partly due to its significantly cheaper price. In order to overcome the coking problem of Ni catalysts, numerous theoretical studies have been conducted to understand the coke formation on nickel and to come up with potential strategies to avoid the unwanted coking process."
          [2] "It could be shown that the adsorption of C atoms on the closed packed surface of a NiAu surface alloy is thermodynamically less favoured, by 23 kJ mol1 or more, than the analogous process on a pure Ni(111) surface.134 Based on this finding, it has been proposed to alloy Ni with Au.134 A cheaper alternative is to alloy Ni with Sn which hinders the CC bond formation and enhances the CO bond formation leading to the removal of surface C centers as carbon monoxide.135,136 It has been discussed that the Sn atoms separate the Ni centers on the catalyst surface, which tend to bind C atoms, from each other. With the Ni centers being separated, the C atoms on the surface are separated as well, which hinders the formation of coke.135,136 These theoretical results are consistent with experiments which show that pure Ni catalysts deactivate significantly faster than NiSn alloy based catalysts.135 Since the step sites play an essential role in the growth of the graphene islands, as mentioned above, additives such as potassium,66 sulfur,66 gold66 or boron131 have been proposed.66 Computational calculations have shown that these elements tend to occupy the step sites and thus avoid the formation of graphene islands.66,131 A similar strategy, by blocking the crucial sites, has been proposed to prevent the formation of a carbidic phase. Calculations have shown that boron prefers the same sub-surface sites on Ni as C.137 By occupying these sites with B, the diffusion of C to these sub-surface sites and the formation of the thermodynamically more stable carbide phase can be prevented.128 Apart from blocking the sub-surface sites, sub-surface boron in Ni(111) also has been shown to have an destabilizing effect on on-surface C centers,138 which may help to prevent the accumulation of C atoms on the surface."
          [3] "Although supported Pt catalysts show high activity, the catalyst deactivation due to coke formation remains a challenging issue."
          [4] "The robustness against coking can be increased with additional promoters, such as late transition metals, main-group metals including Sn and Ga, alkali-metal oxides and rare-earth metal oxides."
          [5] "It has been demonstrated for graphene islands on the Ni(111) surface, unsaturated C atoms at the edge of a graphene island are less stable than isolated C atoms on the metal surface."
          [6] "A cheaper alternative is to alloy Ni with Sn which hinders the CC bond formation and enhances the CO bond formation leading to the removal of surface C centers as carbon monoxide."
          [7] "Since the step sites play an essential role in the growth of the graphene islands, as mentioned above, additives such as potassium, sulfur, gold or boron have been proposed."
          [8] "Apart from blocking the sub-surface sites, sub-surface boron in Ni(111) also has been shown to have an destabilizing effect on on-surface C centers, which may help to prevent the accumulation of C atoms on the surface."

[1] "A catalyst design consisting of the double-decoration of nanoparticulate intermetallic PtGa with Pb and Ca was applied to produce an ultra-stable catalyst for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) at a high temperature."
          [2] "PtGaCaPb/SiO2 exhibited outstanding catalytic stability in PDH at 600C, and almost no deactivation was observed for up to 1month."
          [3] "Herein, we report a novel catalyst design concept, namely, the double decoration of PtGa intermetallics by Pb and Ca, which synergize the geometric and electronic promotion effects on the catalyst stability, respectively."
          [4] "Pb is deposited on the three-fold Pt3 sites of the PtGa nanoparticles to block them, whereas Ca, which affords an electron-enriched single-atom-like Pt1 site, is placed around the nanoparticles."
          [5] "Thus, PtGaCaPb/SiO2 exhibits an outstandingly high catalytic stability, even at 600C (kd=0.00033h1, τ=3067h), and almost no deactivation of the catalyst was observed for up to 1month for the first time."

[1] "To expose the loaded Pt on the surface of the carriers, ion exchange and impregnation are two simple and practical methods. The dispersion of Pt mainly depends on the precursors of Pt, the preparation conditions, the properties of the carriers, and the interaction between Pt and the carriers, as well as the additives."
          [2] "The addition of a second metal has been found to be highly effective for the sintering resistance of Pt particles. The introduced metal forms alloys with Pt around Pt particles,63 and the alloys anchor them on the surface of the carriers, making them not easy to migrate and coalesce."
          [3] "The application of the carriers possessing a strong interaction with Pt is another way to retard the sintering. Al2O3 is the most common carrier of Pt catalyst, in which the coordinatively unsaturated pentacoordinate Al3+ can anchor Pt to make it not easy to migrate."
          [4] "Nanocarbon was also reported as the carrier of Pt to improve the sintering resistance, and the strong metalcarrier interaction leads to the electron transfer from nanocarbon to the Pt particles, significantly preventing the sintering of Pt."
          [5] "MgAl2O4 spinel is also a good choice as the carrier. Generally, Pt is not directly loaded on MgAl2O4 spinel prepared beforehand, but firstly loaded into the spaces between the layers of MgAlOx hydrotalcite, and then Pt particles are enclosed in the interspace of MgAl2O4 spinel formed through the collapse of the layered structure of the hydrotalcite after calcination at high temperature."
          [6] "Moliner et al.67 reported effective methods to encapsulate Pt in highly siliceous chabazite, and the catalyst showed enhanced stability towards Pt sintering even at 650750 C in the atmospheres of H2, O2 and H2O."
          [7] "The Al2O3 overcoat has also proved to be efficient in preventing the sintering of Pt nanoparticles through atomic layer deposition."
          [8] "Tanabe et al. revealed that no Pt sintering was observed for Pt/MgO as an automotive exhaust catalyst after calcination in air at 900 C, for the formation of a Mg2PtO4-like compound prevents the migration of Pt."
          [9] "Nagai et al. found that CeO2 had a similar effect of MgO in preventing the sintering of Pt due to the formation of the PtOCe bond in the Pt/CeO2 catalyst."
          [10] "Recently, Pt supported on CeO2 has attracted more attention because of the ability of CeO2 to trap Pt in an atomically dispersed state."
          [11] "The atomically dispersed Pt is most likely to be present in the form of Pt2+ bonded to the ubiquitous step edges of the CeO2 surface."
          [12] "The addition of Ga, In, Zn, Cu, Ir, Co to Pt catalysts exhibits similar effects as Sn."
          [13] "Not only that, but Sattler et al.84 showed that in the highly active, selective and stable PtGaK/Al2O3 (0.1 wt% Pt, 3 wt% Ga, 0.25 wt% K) catalyst for the dehydrogenation of propane, the coordinately unsaturated Ga3+ is responsible for activating the CH bond, and Pt only acts as a promoter."
          [14] "Furthermore, just like the PtSn/CeO2 catalyst,29 the reactivity can be fully recovered via simple coke burning in air, although the sintering of Pt still occurs."
          [15] "Located at the same main group with Ga, In was also reported to be the promoter of supported Pt catalysts. The PtIn/Mg(Al)O catalyst prepared at pH 8 using the co-precipitation method exhibits the best catalytic performance and the strongest interaction between the metal phase and the carrier."
          [16] "B and Si, two nonmetal elements, can play similar roles, too. Dehydrogenation of n-butane over the PtB/SiO2 catalyst showed improved catalytic activity and stability compared with Pt/SiO2."
          [17] "Dadras et al.86 called B a magic bullet against sintering and coking, and they summarized the positive roles of B as follows. The non-stoichiometric PtB cluster is anchored to the carrier via a covalent BO bond, which is much stronger than the interaction between Pt clusters and the carrier surface."
          [18] "Additionally, the dissociation energy of a Pt atom from a PtB cluster is significantly larger than that from the pure Pt cluster, increasing the sintering resistance."
          [19] "Finally, the affinity of PtB cluster to C also drops dramatically, leading to the reduced coke formation and increased selectivity to olefins."
          [20] "It is predicted by a computational screening of main-group elements as potential additives for the Pt catalyst that Si, just as B, can modify the selectivity of the Pt catalyst by changing both electronic and geometric properties."

[1] "In this review, we outline the progress of these dehydrogenation catalysts that have been mainly developed in the past five years. For different classes of the most-promising catalysts in the selective dehydrogenation of ethane-to-ethylene and propane-to-propylene, their syntheses, structural information, catalytic properties and mechanisms are comparatively summarized."
          [2] "The synthesis parameters influence the metal particle size for the as-obtained Pt-based catalysts."
          [3] "The synthesis approach can also be applied to tailor the size and phase of bimetallic nanoparticles."
          [4] "The synthesis parameters influence the metal particle size for the as-obtained Pt-based catalysts."
          [5] "The synthesis chemistry contributes to the stabilization effect of Pt through strong PtOCe bonds."
          [6] "The synthesis strategy has been reported for the zeolite-confined Pt single-atom and nanocluter catalysts with high stability."
          [7] "The synthesis procedure can maintain the porous texture and anchor the active Pt-based metals."
          [8] "The synthesis method is used to prepare uniform PtIn bimetal nanoparticles."
          [9] "The synthesis approach is used to prepare the well-defined surface metal species by employing the single-site metal precursors."

          [12] "The synthesis method allows it to serve as a potent ion-exchanger, resulting in the stabilization of the highly dispersed bimetallic PtZn sites by the ETS-2 support."

[1] "To improve the stability of Pt-based catalysts, many efforts have been dedicated to strengthen metalsupport interactions by using various methods including the nanopore-encaged metal strategy,2124 wet-chemistry approach2529 and modification of supports.10,11,30,31 Among them, modification of supports is a relatively effective and simple method to improve the stability of Pt-based catalysts."
          [2] "For example, Lu et al. reported a PtSn/Al2O3 sheet catalyst for PDH, exhibiting high activity, selectivity and stability.11 It was proposed that the enhanced stability in PDH was associated with γ-Al2O3 nanosheets containing a great deal of pentacoordinate Al3+ ions, which can stabilize PtSn clusters by strong interactions between metals and supports."
          [3] "Recent work by Ma et al. showed that the addition of Ga into Mg(Al)O layer double hydrotalcites could greatly enhance the stability of Pt catalysts in PDH.10 It may be due to the fact that pentacoordinate Ga3+ ions could disperse and stabilize PtSn clusters, thereby enhancing the electronic interactions between Pt and Ga."
          [4] "A similar conclusion regarding the importance of modification of supports has been reported in the case of PtSn/CeO2 catalysts.30"
          [5] "Therefore, this provides a way to tune and enhance the catalytic activity and selectivity for the PDH process, and also introduces unique stability characteristics for bimetallic systems."
          [6] "Herein, highly stable Pt/Sn-Si-beta catalysts for PDH were prepared by an improved post-synthesis strategy, which consists of dealumination of H-beta and subsequent metal impregnation."
          [7] "It is indicated that Sn species existing in tetrahedral coordination states were incorporated into the framework of dealuminated beta (Si-beta)."
          [8] "Meanwhile, Pt species were highly dispersed in the form of ultra-small nanoclusters on Pt/Sn-Si-beta due to the strong interaction between Pt and Sn(IV) sites confined in the Si-beta framework."
          [9] "The prepared Pt/Sn-Si-beta catalysts show excellent catalytic performance for PDH, in which the propene formation rate was 2.3 mol g1Pt h1 with a propene selectivity of >99% at 550 C and the higher propene formation rate was 3.1 mol g1Pt h1 at 600 C."
          [10] "Moreover, the strong PtSn interactions and the confinement effect of Sn in the Si-beta framework inhibit the coke and sintering of Pt clusters, thereby achieving good stability of dehydrogenation and regeneration with almost unchanged catalytic activity during four cycles at 550 C."



[1] "Although the direct dehydrogenation technique has been industrialized, the fabrication of the corresponding catalysts is still confronted with a series of plights."
          [2] "Decades have witnessed the efforts made and strategies proposed by devoted researchers to optimize the catalyst performance and improve the catalytic stability from a wide panorama."
          [3] "In this section, strategies focused on catalytic stability enhancement in recently reported works are summarized."
          [4] "Effectively regulating the active compounds in both Pt-based catalysts and metal oxide-based catalysts can be achieved by soundly introducing promoters."
          [5] "Promoters can greatly impact the catalytic behaviors in PDH catalysts, showing advantages in suppression of side reactions, inhibition of coke deposition, stabilizing active compounds and so on."
          [6] "Metallic Pt has already been recognized as an effective catalyst for alkane dehydrogenation reactions due to its high affinity for paraffinic CH bonds."
          [7] "Currently, adding metal promoters to form alloys or intermetallic compounds is one of the most effective methods to ameliorate central active components and inhibit catalytic deactivation in Pt-based catalytic systems."
          [8] "Sn is a widely utilized promoter for Pt catalysts."
          [9] "The PtGa catalyst system has also been implemented in production plants (FCDh technique)."
          [10] "In has also been developed as a promising promoter of Pt-based catalysts."
          [11] "Zn is another analogous but economical promoter for Pt-based catalysts."
          [12] "Many other metals, including Fe, Cu, and Co, can also be promoters for Pt-based catalysts to adjust the electronic properties and improve the dispersion of Pt atoms for further stability enhancement."
          [13] "Alloying of Pt with rare-earth elements (REEs) has barely been accomplished through the conventional H2 reduction route due to the low chemical potential of REE oxides."
          [14] "Supported metal oxide-based catalysts, including CoOx-, ZnOx-, VOx-, and CrOx-based catalysts, are other important PDH catalysts and have been extensively studied for decades."

[1] "Extensive research efforts have been made to inhibit deactivation and improve propene selectivity of Pt-based catalysts by doping promoters of Sn [9,10], In [11,12], Ga [13,14] and Cu [15] to form bimetallic catalysts."
          [2] "For example, PtIn [16] and PtGa [17,18] bimetallic nanoparticles (NPs) supported on calcined hydrotalcites (HT) show higher activity and selectivity in PDH, which has been attributed to the increased Pt dispersion and electron transfer from In or Ga to Pt [11,18]."
          [3] "Besides promoters, another method is to modify Al2O3 support with ZnO [19], La2O3 [20] or TiO2 [21] or replace Al2O3 support with ZnAl2O4 [22], ZSM-5 [23] or Mg(Al)O oxide [8,24]."
          [4] "Additionally, it has been verified that the single Pt atom sites on Pt-Sn/γ-Al2O3 with a sandwich structure are more favorable for PDH reaction than Pt ensembles [25,26]."

Stable and selective catalysts for propane dehydrogenation operating at thermodynamic limit Hitting the limits on propene synthesis The greater abundance of propane from shale gas has spurred efforts to use it as a propylene feedstock. Direct dehydrogenation catalysts consisting of platinumtin alloy nanoparticles supported on alumina often must run with hydrogen dilution to avoid carbon buildup and excess tin to avoid alloy segregation.
          We report that silica-supported platinum-tin (Pt1Sn1) nanoparticles (&lt;2 nanometers in diameter) can operate as a PDH catalyst at thermodynamically limited conversion levels, with excellent stability and selectivity to propylene (&gt;99%). Atomic mixing of Pt and Sn in the precursor is preserved upon reduction and during catalytic operation. The benign interaction of these nanoparticles with the silicon dioxide support does not lead to Pt-Sn segregation and formation of a tin oxide phase that can occur over traditional catalyst supports.
          To alleviate this issue, large quantities of Sn are used in the catalyst preparation (the nominal atomic loading is Sn:Pt between 4 and 5), which increases the yield of intermetallic PtSn NPs (12). In addition, studies have shown that adding hydrogen to the reactant feed reduces the rate of catalyst deactivation (13). Although this strategy is implemented commercially (10), addition of hydrogen in the feed lowers the thermodynamic limit on per-pass propane conversion (fig. S1) and decreases productivity (7).
          We developed a PDH catalyst that operates at thermodynamically limited conversion levels without the addition of hydrogen to the feed and exhibits excellent stability and selectivity to propylene (&gt;99%). The catalyst is composed of silica-supported Pt1Sn1 NPs, synthesized and pretreated to ensure that the mixing of Pt and Sn is preserved during catalytic operation.
          The principle behind catalyst synthesis is to begin with a heterometallic Pt-Sn coordination complex in which Pt and Sn are in immediate contact, and this interaction is retained during the reduction and PDH reaction.
          The data in Fig. 1, A to C, were obtained with 16 vol % propane in helium. Propane streams are diluted in commercial operations to increase the limiting equilibrium conversion, which is higher at lower propane partial pressure (fig. S2), and to limit catalyst deactivation rates (7, 16, 17). This approach requires additional downstream separation units and limits process efficiency.
          The data in Fig. 1, A to C, show the performance of the Pt1Sn1/SiO2 catalyst (1 wt % Pt and 0.6 wt % Sn) for propane dehydrogenation at 580C, 16 vol % propane (with the remainder helium) and at a weight hourly space velocity (WHSV) of 4.7 hours1. Under these reaction conditions, the thermodynamic limit on propane conversion is 66.5% (fig. S2). The Pt1Sn1/SiO2 catalyst showed near-thermodynamic conversion of &gt;66% (Fig. 1A, red circles) and &gt;99% selectivity to propylene (Fig. 1B, red circles).
          The data in Fig. 1D show that, under these conditions, the propane conversion goes from 41 to 39% in 120 min. Under identical conditions, the other tested catalysts deactivate very rapidly to very low conversion, as illustrated for the commercial mimic. A transmission electron microscopy (TEM) image of the spent catalyst, after 120 min of PDH reaction, is shown in fig. S6. The image shows that the Pt-Sn NPs are well dispersed, with an average particle diameter of 1.6  0.67 nm, which is consistent with the particle size in fresh samples.
          We attempted to regenerate the Pt1Sn1/SiO2 catalyst by oxidation, using 1% O2 as a mild oxidant at 500C followed by reduction at 600C (see supplementary materials for details of the regeneration procedure). The regeneration studies showed that Pt1Sn1/SiO2 catalysts can be partially regenerated. For example, we measured 97% of the initial activity and &gt;99% of the initial selectivity after three PDH/regeneration cycles (fig. S5).
          Data in Fig. 3A show that the process of mixing chloroplatinic acid (H2PtCl6) and tin(II) chloride (SnCl2) in 0.1 M hydrochloric acid solution formed a heterometallic Pt-Sn coordination complex.
          A bright-field TEM image of Pt-Sn NPs formed on SiO2 upon the reduction of the Pt-Sn complex shows high metal dispersion on the support, with an average NP size of 1.3  0.6 nm (Fig. 3B). The NP size distribution (Fig. 3C) shows that most NPs were &lt;2 nm. The XRD spectra in Fig. 3D show that the formed NPs were essentially alloys of Pt and Sn. This finding is supported by the presence of the XRD peaks corresponding to Pt1Sn1 (41.8 and 44.1) and Pt3Sn1 (39.0 and 45.3) stoichiometries.
          The real-space Pt LIII EXAFS spectra for the Pt1Sn1/SiO2 catalyst (Fig. 4D) are substantially different from the spectra of monometallic Pt and indicate the mixing of Pt and Sn atoms. The best-fit spectrum for the Pt1Sn1/SiO2 catalyst is characterized by the presence of the Pt-Pt and Pt-Sn scattering paths, consistent with the formation of PtSn intermetallic phases.

          [3] "The stability and regenerability of Pt-Sn2/meso-Al2O3 are strongly dependent on the content of Al3+penta sites in the Al2O3 structure, and a high level of Al3+penta sites can effectively prevent the agglomeration of Pt-Sn2 clusters into large Pt nanoparticles in the consecutive dehydrogenation-regeneration cycles."



[1] "Rare-earthplatinum alloy nanoparticles in mesoporous zeolite for catalysis Platinum is a much used catalyst that, in petrochemical processes, is often alloyed with other metals to improve catalytic activity, selectivity and longevity1,2,3,4,5."
          [2] "Such catalysts are usually prepared in the form of metallic nanoparticles supported on porous solids, and their production involves reducing metal precursor compounds under a H2 flow at high temperatures6."
          [3] "The method works well when using easily reducible late transition metals, but Pt alloy formation with rare-earth elements through the H2 reduction route is almost impossible owing to the low chemical potential of rare-earth element oxides6."
          [4] "Here we use as support a mesoporous zeolite that has pore walls with surface framework defects (called silanol nests) and show that the zeolite enables alloy formation between Pt and rare-earth elements."
          [5] "We find that the silanol nests enable the rare-earth elements to exist as single atomic species with a substantially higher chemical potential compared with that of the bulk oxide, making it possible for them to diffuse onto Pt."
          [6] "High-resolution transmission electron microscopy and hydrogen chemisorption measurements indicate that the resultant bimetallic nanoparticles supported on the mesoporous zeolite are intermetallic compounds, which we find to be stable, highly active and selective catalysts for the propane dehydrogenation reaction."
          [7] "When used with late transition metals, the same preparation strategy produces Pt alloy catalysts that incorporate an unusually large amount of the second metal and, in the case of the PtCo alloy, show high catalytic activity and selectivity in the preferential oxidation of carbon monoxide in H2."
          [8] "The industrial PDH process has been using PtSn bimetallic catalysts supported on porous alumina for nearly three decades, since its discovery in the early 1990s3,7."
          [9] "The Pt metal alone exhibits high initial catalytic activity, but rapidly deactivates as a result of coke deposition on the Pt surface."
          [10] "The coke deposition also causes an undesirable loss of the catalytic selectivity to propylene."
          [11] "To alleviate these problems, Sn is introduced to form an alloy with Pt nanoparticles and thereby dilute the Pt surface with inactive Sn atoms and break up coke-generating Pt ensembles."
          [12] "Our search for a highly active and more durable PDH catalyst has focused on using a siliceous MFI zeolite with a hierarchical micro-/mesoporous structure as a replacement for the alumina support."
          [13] "This zeolite, synthesized using a multi-ammonium surfactant as a structure-directing agent, has attracted attention as an advanced catalyst support8,9,10,11,12,13 owing to its unique structure, which comprises ultrathin zeolite frameworks and three-dimensionally interconnected mesopores that boost the catalytic performance of supported metals by providing both facile reactant and product diffusion and high metal nanoparticle dispersion within the mesopores12,13."
          [14] "The formation of the Pt3La and Pt3Y nanoparticles on the degallated zeolite brought a striking enhancement in all aspects of the PDH catalytic performance, including activity, selectivity and durability, as shown in Fig. 2."
          [15] "The catalytic reaction was performed at 580C using a pure propane flow at a large space velocity (see Methods), and these harsh operating conditions caused even the conventional PtSn/alumina catalyst to experience severe coke formation and catalyst deactivation within 1 d."
          [16] "In sharp contrast, the Pt3La intermetallic nanoparticles supported on the degallated zeolite (denoted as PtLa/mz-deGa, where mz stands for mesoporous zeolite) showed a high initial propane conversion of 40% (close to the equilibrium conversion) and underwent extremely slow deactivation, retaining 8% conversion even after 30 days of reaction."
          [17] "The PtREE incorporation in the mesoporous zeolite was conducted by co-impregnation of aqueous solutions of Pt(NH3)4(NO3)2 and either La(NO3)3·6H2O or Y(NO3)3·6H2O, followed by heating under an O2 flow at 350C and subsequently under H2 at 700C (see Methods)."

[1] "Although the equilibrium conversion of alkanes increases with temperature, alkene selectivity decreases with increasing temperature and chain length due to an increased tendency toward dehydrocyclization/aromatisation, thermal cracking and coke formation."
          [2] "Direct dehydrogenation of lower alkanes is an energy intensive reaction; however, oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) has the potential to lower the energy requirement for achieving dehydrogenation."
          [3] "ODH can be considered as tandem endothermic (dehydrogenation, CnH2n + 2  CnH2n + H2) and exothermic (oxidation, H2 + O2  H2O) processes, with an overall thermodynamic summation, CnH2n + 2 + O2  CnH2n + H2O."
          [4] "Although the process is not thermo-neutral, part of the energy required for the endothermic reaction is augmented by the exothermic reaction."
          [5] "Thus, ODH of alkanes takes place at lower temperature compared to the corresponding non-ODH."
          [6] "This lower temperature requirement of ODH compared to non-ODH and cracking is encouraging and provides motivation for continued efforts to develop ODH into an industrial technology."
          [7] "Although ODH is attractive because of the energy intensification advantage, commercial ODH technologies hinge on innovative catalyst and process design, i.e. proper synergy of the endothermic dehydrogenation step with the exothermic hydrogen combustion and design of selective CH and hydrogen combustion catalysts."

          [13] "Developing direct routes to obtain key organic chemicals from lower alkanes would benefit industry."
          [14] "Lower alkanes are relatively inert, and they exhibit little or no reactivity at conditions typical for activating functional group reactions in organic compounds because they lack low-lying vacant orbitals or lone pair electrons."
          [15] "Alkanes are made up non-polar CC and CH bonds. These bonds consist of strongly localised electron pairs that are usually induced to reactivity under severe conditions (e.g., at high temperature or pressure, or with the use of aggressive reagents)."
          [16] "The first and rate-limiting step of alkane dehydrogenation using platinum or chromium oxide-based catalysts involves CH activation."
          [17] "Although a number of efforts have been made to gain insight on the mechanism of the reaction, questions still remain, especially regarding the pathway of the CH activation."
          [18] "It is of fundamental and applied interest to know whether the first CH bond cleavage is homolytic or heterolytic."
          [19] "If it is a heterolytic pathway, it will further be of interest to know whether the first hydrogen from the alkane substrate is abstracted as a proton or as a hydride ion."
          [20] "This knowledge will benefit catalyst improvement efforts."
          [21] "The simple impregnation techniques for preparing supported (especially alumina) metal and oxide catalysts becloud their structural heterogeneity."

          [25] "Although several solid acid catalysts are used in alkane conversions, zeolites have the advantage of possessing a well-defined structure, allowing the structure-activity relationship to be easily deduced."
          [26] "Therefore, it is instructive to examine non-oxidative dehydrogenation of light alkanes over zeolite catalysts."
          [27] "A detailed knowledge of the adsorption mechanism of lower alkane molecules on zeolite is of interest in this context, especially for informed tuning of zeolite properties to allow efficient and selective dehydrogenation of alkanes."
          [28] "Light alkanes are adsorbed on zeolites via dispersive interaction."
          [29] "Protons and the exchanged metals ions are typically the active sites in zeolites, while the zeolite framework plays the role of anchor for the active sites and/or dispersion medium for the reactants."
          [30] "The framework of microporous zeolites exerts dispersive forces on the reactant's molecules that depend on the shape, channel and cavity of the framework."
          [31] "In addition, the nature and the density of the active sites influence the framework dispersion forces."
          [32] "Recent reports have shown that the strong electrostatic field between protons or exchanged metal ions and basic oxygen species can enhance and/or induce polarization of bonds in hydrocarbon adsorbates."

          [34] "Wender et al. showed that 3040% of heat adsorption in n-alkanes on Na-zeolite is due to polarization of the adsorbates."
          [35] "Subbotina et al. also demonstrated that the CH bond of ethane is more strongly polarized on Mg2 + and Ca2 + forms of Y zeolite than on Na+ forms."
          [36] "Mg2 +-Y zeolite molecules exhibit weaker adsorption and polarization of ethane than Ca2 +-zeolites."
          [37] "Based on charge density considerations, Mg2 + cations are expected to exhibit a stronger polarizing effect than Ca2 + cations."
          [38] "Subbotina et al. explain that because of the smaller ionic radius of Mg2 +, it is more strongly shielded by the surrounding oxygen atoms of the zeolite lattice than a Ca2 + ion, thereby reducing the polarizing effect of Mg2 + on the hydrocarbon adsorbate."
          [39] "Sievers et al. also report that the La3 + form of X zeolite induces strong polarization of adsorbed alkane molecules; partial positive charges were induced on secondary and tertiary carbon atoms of alkane molecules."
          [40] "The authors suggest that the polarization may be viewed as an intermediate condition to hydride abstraction (which is an important elementary step in CH activation)."
          [41] "They add that CH bond polarization was enhanced by physisorbed water molecules that coordinate with La3 + cations."
          [42] "The enhanced polarization of CH bonds by the presence of water molecules on La3 +X zeolite may have a beneficial effect in oxidative dehydrogenation where water is a by-product."
          [43] "Alkane polarization studies on Na+, Mg2 +, Ca2 +, and La3 + exchanged X-zeolites indicate that the polarizing effect increases with increasing charge magnitude and ionic radius."
          [44] "Note that these alkane polarizing cations occupy the same position on the zeolites as the well-known CH activation cations/metals, and thus the CH polarizing effect has a complementary effect on CH activation."
          [45] "This may add to the number of relevant variables and increase the challenge of optimizing the ratio of activation/polarizing cations among exchangeable sites (Si/Al ratio), as well as the sequence for incorporating the cations or metals during catalyst preparation."
          [46] "Further, it is important to note that the choice of cations should be such that they exhibit no catalytic (oligomerization, isomerization, aromatisation or oxidation) effects on the target alkene products at the reaction condition."
          [47] "Furthermore, it may be beneficial to create a CH polarization effect on the zeolite framework."
          [48] "This can be achieved by appropriate chance of framework atoms."
          [49] "Since active sites are usually created on the zeolite frameworks."
          [50] "The activation of CH bonds of light alkanes occurs readily on super electrophiles (super Brnsted and super Lewis acid) at low temperatures."
          [51] "Although CH activation on zeolites have been observed at low temperatures, industrial alkane reactions on zeolites are usually carried out at high temperatures."
          [52] "Several experimental and theoretical studies on the molecular dynamics of light alkanes on zeolite have been published."
          [53] "However, despite the decades of intensive investigations on the subject, the actual mechanism of CH activation on acid zeolite is still debated."
          [54] "Two CH activation paths are generally recognized: the unimolecular/protolytic mechanism and the bimolecular/carbenium chain mechanism."
          [55] "The unimolecular mechanism involves direct protonation of an alkane-forming carbonium ion intermediate."
          [56] "The proton can be inserted into either a CC or CH bond of the alkane."
          [57] "Proton insertion through the CC bond leads to cracking of the alkane, with the acid site regenerated."
          [58] "Insertion through the HC bond yields H2 and a carbenium ion/alkoxide intermediate."
          [59] "Desorption of alkene from the intermediate regenerates the acid, or the alkoxide can enter the bimolecular conversion path."
          [60] "In the bimolecular mechanism of CH activation, the alkoxide intermediate constitutes the active sites and CH activation occurs through hydride transfer from a second alkane molecule forming another alkoxide."
          [61] "This may be followed by βscission to regenerate the active site and complete the catalytic cycle."
          [62] "For example, activation of propane on acid zeolite based on the two mechanisms is illustrated in Scheme 1."
          [63] "Low reactant partial pressure and high temperature favor unimolecular dehydrogenation of alkane on acid zeolite."
          [64] "These conditions favor the endothermic desorption step (rate limiting step) leading to propene."
          [65] "In contrast, high partial pressure and low temperature favor the bimolecular mechanism leading to a low propene yield."
          [66] "The two molecular mechanisms devoid of side reactions give fairly predictable product distribution."
          [67] "However, the products of each route are prone to side reactions (dimerization, oligomerization, isomerization & aromatisation) in the presence of Bronsted acid sites."
          [68] "Hence propene selectivity on acidic zeolite is very low and products rich in aromatics are usually obtained."
          [69] "The active sites (alkoxide intermediate) of the bimolecular pathway are formed in situ."
          [70] "The alkoxide intermediate is made up of an alkyl carbenium ion ionically held to the zeolite framework oxygen ion."
          [71] "The active sites of the unimolecular pathway are the charge balancing protons of the zeolite framework."
          [72] "A proton and a carbenium ion are an electrophilic or Lewis acid species (a proton can also be considered as a special case of Lewis acidity)."
          [73] "The two pathways essentially involve electrophilic CH activation."
          [74] "The electrophiles (proton and carbenium ion) activate CH at high temperatures (500 C), giving low conversion rates of light alkanes and poor selectivity to corresponding alkenes."
          [75] "Iglesia and co-workers used isotopic labeling studies to demonstrate that CH activation is not the rate-limiting step in the dehydrogenation of propane on H-ZSM-5 and Ga/H-ZSM-5."
          [76] "They proposed that the CH bond cleavage produces an H-adatom and an alkoxide intermediate."
          [77] "Desorption of an alkene from the alkoxide regenerates the proton sites on the zeolites."
          [78] "An alkoxide intermediate may also discharge as a hydrogen rich species through cracking."
          [79] "Iglesia et al. proposed that desorption or disposal of the H-adatom from the CH bond cleavage is the rate-limiting step."
          [80] "A similar deduction was reached by Yu et al."
          [81] "who found that desorption of the alkoxides intermediate is the rate-limiting step under conditions that favor the unimolecular mechanism."
          [82] "The above proposition has been demonstrated on metal (e.g., Ga, Zn, and Co) exchanged zeolites."
          [83] "The specific role of the exchanged metals has been the subject of several reports with special attention on Ga and Zn."
          [84] "Although the framework Ga2O3 on H-MFI seems to have a CH polarization effect on desorbed methane, Ga2O3 exhibits lower CH activation activity."
          [85] "The physical mixture of Ga2O3/HMFI displays higher propane aromatisation activity than pure H-MFI."
          [86] "Similar synergistic effects have been reported for Zn/H-MFI and Co/H-MFI."
          [87] "Exchanged cations behave as monomeric species at the exchange sites of zeolite."
          [88] "Iglesia and Biscardi hypothesized that the monomeric species enhance propane conversion by promoting re-combinative desorption (RD) of the H-adatom formed from the CH cleavage."
          [89] "It is worthwhile noting that the exchange cations (electrophilic species) constitute the CH activation sites."
          [90] "Hence, more insights are required about their additional role in promoting RD."
          [91] "However, the authors did not provide further information on the nature of the H-adatoms and the mechanism of RD."
          [92] "In the next section, we examine the mechanism of desorption of H-adatoms over Ga and Zn exchanged H-ZSM-5."
          [93] "The exchanged metal ions in zeolites are held ionically by one or more basic oxygen atoms."
          [94] "Different species have been suggested, depending on the density of the cation exchange site of the zeolite and method of introduction of the metals."
          [95] "According to Kanansky et al."
          [96] "the exchanged Zn and Ga species on H-ZSM-5 and their mechanism of CH activation are distinctively different."
          [97] "Zn and Ga are introduced on H-ZSM-5 through a vapor deposition technique using Zn metal vapor and Ga(CH3)3 as the source of Zn and Ga, respectively."
          [98] "The metal introduction technique allows quantitative exchange of the zeolite protons which leads to Zn/Al = 0.5 and Ga/Al = 1, respectively."
          [99] "Zn2 + is generated directly, but Ga+ is produced by H2 treatment at 500 C to release the methyl groups."
          [100] "The proposed active sites are OZn2+O and OGa+, respectively."
          [101] "The mechanism of CH activation with ethane by the two sites under the same reaction conditions are summarized in Scheme 2."
          [102] "The proposed mechanism is in agreement with the mechanism suggested from calculations using the GAUSSIAN 94 program for ethane activation on Zn-exchanged zeolite by Frash and van Santen."
          [103] "In another theoretical study using a DFT cluster modeling approach, Pidko and van Santen compared the activation energy of CH with three types of Zn species at active sites: OZn2+O, OZn+OZn+O and HOZn+ O."
          [104] "The authors suggest that the reaction proceeds most easily on OZn2+O, and hypothesize that the enhanced Lewis activity of OZn2+O facilitates CH heterolytic cleavage."
          [105] "They further argue that the first proton abstraction occurs preferentially on the oxygen sites neighboring the ring where the cation is located."
          [106] "They proposed a one-step reaction to yield H2 and C2H4 from the decomposition of the Zn-alkyl and proton."
          [107] "A proposed mechanism of CH activation on OGa+ has similarly been suggested using theoretical calculations."
          [108] "High alkene selectivities are obtained on the H-ZSM-5 when exchangeable protons are rigorously replaced by Zn and Ga."
          [109] "The Zn-exchanged H-ZSM-5 had higher ethane conversion rates but lower ethene selectivity than its Ga counterpart."
          [110] "The CH activation on the OZn2+O site can be described by a Lewis base-assisted deprotonation mechanism."
          [111] "This is accompanied by conversion of the Lewis base site to a conjugate Bronsted acid site."
          [112] "The OGa+ site, however, activates the CH bond via oxidative addition without a protonic site intermediate."
          [113] "A protonic site intermediate increases tendency of side reactions on the Zn-exchanged H-ZSM-5 relative to the Ga counterpart."
          [114] "The elementary steps of CH activation on OGa+ (Scheme 2) reveal that a redox cycle at the metal center is required for catalytic CH activation via the oxidative addition mechanism."
          [115] "A redox cycle is not apparent in the elementary step presented for CH activation on OZn2+O."
          [116] "Hence, a redox cycle is not a requisite for CH activation via the Lewis base-assisted deprotonation mechanism."
          [117] "However, under alkane dehydrogenation reaction conditions, the OZn2+O sites can undergo a reversible Zn2 +/Zn redox process."
          [118] "This redox process increases the availability of undesired protonic site intermediates."
          [119] "Zn-exchanged H-ZSM-5 prepared by conventional ion-exchange methods contain a significant percentage of unexchanged proton sites leading to lower alkene selectivity of the catalyst."
          [120] "Iglesia and Biscardi titrate the proton sites with NaOH."
          [121] "The un-titrated and the titrated catalysts are denoted as Zn/H-ZSMS-5 and Zn/Na-ZSMS-5, respectively."
          [122] "Zn/Na-ZSM-5 has four times the propane conversion rate and a higher propene selectivity than Zn/H-ZSMS-5."
          [123] "The propene formation rate obtained with Zn/Na-ZSM-5 was ten times that of Zn/H-ZSMS-5."
          [124] "The zinc species at the cation exchange site of the zeolite was identified as OZn+OH."
          [125] "The higher propene selectivity obtained on Zn/Na-ZSM-5 compared to Zn/H-ZSMS-5 is presumably from the lower density and availability of proton sites on Zn/Na-ZSM-5."
          [126] "The improved propane conversion rate of Zn/Na-ZSM-5 compared to Zn/H-ZSM-5 is attributable to the higher efficiency of OZn+OH sites in catalyzing desorption of H-adatoms than OZn2+O sites."
          [127] "Another strategy to enhance alkene selectivity is by controlling the strength of the proton sites."
          [128] "The acidity of the sites depends on the nature of the trivalent cation of the zeolite framework."
          [129] "Proton sites in borosilicate zeolites are weaker than those of aluminosilicate, and thus higher alkene selectivity is expected for alkane dehydrogenation over Zn/H[B]-ZSM-5 compared to Zn/H[Al]-ZSM-5."
          [130] "However, Zn/H[B]-ZSM-5 shows no activity for propane dehydrogenation."
          [131] "The desired weaker acidity of the proton sites of Zn/H[B]-ZSM-5 requires weaker basicity of the oxygen atoms in the zeolite framework."
          [132] "This reduced basicity of the oxygen atoms is not sufficiently polarizing to complement the exchanged Zn2 + in CH bond cleavage."
          [133] "In the next section, we examine use of zeolite support to design a Pt-based alkane dehydrogenation catalyst."
          [134] "Elimination of the proton sites of zeolites is critical for obtaining a high alkene selectivity and stability in dehydrogenation catalysts."
          [135] "Pt is the most versatile noble metal catalyst for alkane reactions."
          [136] "Although Pt is expensive, the choice of Pt is often justified by its higher activity, stability and selectivity for these reactions compared to less expensive alternative transition metals."
          [137] "However, rapid catalyst deactivation due to coke formation remains a challenge even when using a Pt-based catalyst for dehydrogenation of light alkanes."
          [138] "Waku et al."
          [139] "exploited the unique property of zeolite as a support for achieving high metal dispersion through cation exchange sites to create a Pt/Na[Fe]-ZSM-5 catalyst with outstanding stability for dehydrogenation of light alkanes."
          [140] "They found that the catalyst deactivation rate of Pt/Na[Fe]-ZSM-5 was lower than for any other Pt-based catalysts in refractory oxide support."
          [141] "The unprecedented performance of Pt/Na[Fe]-ZSM-5 was attributed to its high Pt dispersion (cluster size < 1 mm) on zeolite through ion-exchange."
          [142] "There is a tendency to generate some Brnsted protons on the zeolite during the exchange process, but the choice of Fe3 + as an isomorphous cation in place of Al3 + led to weaker Brnsted sites in [Fe]-ZSM compared to [Al]-ZSM."
          [143] "The weaker acidity minimizes the tendency of side reactions (cracking of oligomerization, aromatisation, and coke), which translates into higher alkene selectivity and catalyst stability."
          [144] "In another report, Xuebing and Iglesia demonstrated the ability of Pt/Na[Fe]-ZSM-5 to dehydrogenate alkanes longer than C4; n-pentane and n-heptane were selectively converted to n-pentene and n-heptene, respectively."
          [145] "Alkene selectivity was also improved when the residual proton generated during Pt exchange or Na-[Fe]-ZSM was titrated with Cs."
          [146] "Although Pt with conventional refractory oxides (Al2O3, SiO2, ZrO2, etc.) used for dehydrogenation of alkanes has similar conversion rates to Pt/Na[Fe]-ZSM-5, deactivation rates are also rapid due to coke formation."
          [147] "The presence of acid (Bronsted and Lewis) sites on the supports promotes readsorption, oligomerization and aromatisation of alkenes."
          [148] "Promotion of Pt with metals, such as Sn, Ga, Zn, Re, etc., improves catalyst stability, but also leads to faster deactivation rates than Pt/Na[Fe]-ZSM-5."
          [149] "However, recent reports by Bell et al."
          [150] "show that the use of calcined hydrotalcite (Al/Mg  0.1) supported on bimetallic PtGa or PtSn gave very high alkene selectivity and stability, comparable to Pt/Na[Fe]-ZSM-5."
          [151] "At this stage, we can conclude that differences in the performance of Zn and Ga exchanged H-ZSM-5 obtained by Kanansky et al."
          [152] "are attributable to their respective CH activation mechanisms."
          [153] "In addition, the role of exchanged Zn and Ga as promoters of RD becomes evident from the mechanisms (Scheme 2)."
          [154] "The RD mechanism on Ga exchanged H-ZSM-5 is by reductive elimination of a hydrogen molecule from O[Ga(H)2]+ intermediate."
          [155] "Decomposition of ZnR and a protonic site, or neutralization of the proton sites by ZnH, leads to desorption of the hydrogen molecule on the Zn-exchanged H-ZSM-5."
          [156] "By extrapolation, the mechanisms of CH activation on exchanged Zn and Ga H-ZSM-5 can described the mechanism of alkane dehydrogenation on Cr-based and Pt-based catalysts respectively."
          [157] "The electronic promotion effect of Sn is in line with the oxidative addition CH activation mechanism."
          [158] "However, the Lewis base-assisted deprotonation mechanism could also explain the proposed CH activation on Cr-based catalysts."
          [159] "Now, the nature and the role of surface oxygen species become more evident."
          [160] "The role of potassium in commercial Cr and Pt-based dehydrogenation catalysts is to minimize the undesired influence of protonic sites on alkene selectivity."
          [161] "The highlights in this section are presented in Table 2."
          [162] "The table reveals the insights achieved on the reaction mechanism, alkene selectivity and catalyst stability for non-oxidative dehydrogenation of lower alkanes."
          [163] "Nonetheless, the level of catalyst activity is still far from acceptable, even at high temperature."
          [164] "A recent report by Rothenberg et al."
          [165] "provides a lead in this respect."
          [166] "Their report indicates that a porous copperaluminum framework material (stabilized by metal oxide) has better performance (activity/selectivity/stability) for propane dehydrogenation than a PtSn/Al2O3."
          [167] "Of particular interest, is the suggestion that achieving propane dehydrogenation at 350 C may be possible."
          [168] "Few details are known about the structure of the porous copperaluminum framework material."
          [169] "However, copper is implicated as providing the active sites for the catalysis."
          [170] "Also, that the material activated in oxygen gave higher propane conversion rates than those activated in inert gas atmosphere underscores the role of the surface oxide (oxygen species) in the catalysis."
          [171] "Thus, the Lewis base-assisted deprotonation mechanism may be invoked here, and the redox property of the metal center is likely to play a role in achieving propane dehydrogenation at 350 C."
          [172] "This should constitute the future research direction for non-oxidative dehydrogenation of lower alkanes."
          [173] "Although the equilibrium conversion of alkanes increases with temperature, alkene selectivity decreases with increasing temperature and chain length due to an increased tendency toward dehydrocyclization/aromatisation, thermal cracking and coke formation."
          [174] "Direct dehydrogenation of lower alkanes is an energy intensive reaction; however, oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) has the potential to lower the energy requirement for achieving dehydrogenation."
          [175] "ODH can be considered as tandem endothermic (dehydrogenation, CnH2n + 2  CnH2n + H2) and exothermic (oxidation, H2 + O2  H2O) processes, with an overall thermodynamic summation, CnH2n + 2 + O2  CnH2n + H2O."
          [176] "Although the process is not thermo-neutral, part of the energy required for the endothermic reaction is augmented by the exothermic reaction."
          [177] "Thus, ODH of alkanes takes place at lower temperature compared to the corresponding non-ODH."
          [178] "This lower temperature requirement of ODH compared to non-ODH and cracking is encouraging and provides motivation for continued efforts to develop ODH into an industrial technology."
          [179] "Although ODH is attractive because of the energy intensification advantage, commercial ODH technologies hinge on innovative catalyst and process design, i.e. proper synergy of the endothermic dehydrogenation step with the exothermic hydrogen combustion and design of selective CH and hydrogen combustion catalysts."
          [180] "In this report, we provide an overview on CH activation and reaction routes to alkane dehydrogenation."
          [181] "We seek to gain insights about components of the active sites of CH activation to provide a platform for rational design of new efficient catalysts for dehydrogenation of lower alkanes."
          [182] "We focus on propane dehydrogenation because of the need for alternative and/or complementary technology for propene production to supplement existing technologies."
          [183] "We survey non-oxidative and oxidative dehydrogenation approaches, and examine reaction routes that are intermediate between these two main approaches."
          [184] "Although the equilibrium conversion of alkanes increases with temperature, alkene selectivity decreases with increasing temperature and chain length due to an increased tendency toward dehydrocyclization/aromatisation, thermal cracking and coke formation."

          [187] "Despite a large number of reports and many reviews covering different aspects of the subject, and more than two decades of investigations on ODH, gaps still exist between laboratory achievements and industrial implementation."

[1] "Although there are other metallic reforming catalysts such as Ru and Rh, which are less strongly prone to coking than Ni,129 Ni is one of the most common reforming catalysts, which is partly due to its significantly cheaper price. In order to overcome the coking problem of Ni catalysts, numerous theoretical studies have been conducted to understand the coke formation on nickel and to come up with potential strategies to avoid the unwanted coking process."
          [2] "It could be shown that the adsorption of C atoms on the closed packed surface of a NiAu surface alloy is thermodynamically less favoured, by 23 kJ mol1 or more, than the analogous process on a pure Ni(111) surface.134 Based on this finding, it has been proposed to alloy Ni with Au.134 A cheaper alternative is to alloy Ni with Sn which hinders the CC bond formation and enhances the CO bond formation leading to the removal of surface C centers as carbon monoxide.135,136 It has been discussed that the Sn atoms separate the Ni centers on the catalyst surface, which tend to bind C atoms, from each other. With the Ni centers being separated, the C atoms on the surface are separated as well, which hinders the formation of coke.135,136 These theoretical results are consistent with experiments which show that pure Ni catalysts deactivate significantly faster than NiSn alloy based catalysts.135 Since the step sites play an essential role in the growth of the graphene islands, as mentioned above, additives such as potassium,66 sulfur,66 gold66 or boron131 have been proposed.66 Computational calculations have shown that these elements tend to occupy the step sites and thus avoid the formation of graphene islands.66,131 A similar strategy, by blocking the crucial sites, has been proposed to prevent the formation of a carbidic phase. Calculations have shown that boron prefers the same sub-surface sites on Ni as C.137 By occupying these sites with B, the diffusion of C to these sub-surface sites and the formation of the thermodynamically more stable carbide phase can be prevented.128 Apart from blocking the sub-surface sites, sub-surface boron in Ni(111) also has been shown to have an destabilizing effect on on-surface C centers,138 which may help to prevent the accumulation of C atoms on the surface."
          [3] "Although supported Pt catalysts show high activity, the catalyst deactivation due to coke formation remains a challenging issue."
          [4] "The robustness against coking can be increased with additional promoters, such as late transition metals, main-group metals including Sn and Ga, alkali-metal oxides and rare-earth metal oxides."
          [5] "It has been demonstrated for graphene islands on the Ni(111) surface, unsaturated C atoms at the edge of a graphene island are less stable than isolated C atoms on the metal surface."
          [6] "A cheaper alternative is to alloy Ni with Sn which hinders the CC bond formation and enhances the CO bond formation leading to the removal of surface C centers as carbon monoxide."
          [7] "Since the step sites play an essential role in the growth of the graphene islands, as mentioned above, additives such as potassium, sulfur, gold or boron have been proposed."
          [8] "Apart from blocking the sub-surface sites, sub-surface boron in Ni(111) also has been shown to have an destabilizing effect on on-surface C centers, which may help to prevent the accumulation of C atoms on the surface."

[1] "A catalyst design consisting of the double-decoration of nanoparticulate intermetallic PtGa with Pb and Ca was applied to produce an ultra-stable catalyst for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) at a high temperature."
          [2] "PtGaCaPb/SiO2 exhibited outstanding catalytic stability in PDH at 600C, and almost no deactivation was observed for up to 1month."
          [3] "Herein, we report a novel catalyst design concept, namely, the double decoration of PtGa intermetallics by Pb and Ca, which synergize the geometric and electronic promotion effects on the catalyst stability, respectively."
          [4] "Pb is deposited on the three-fold Pt3 sites of the PtGa nanoparticles to block them, whereas Ca, which affords an electron-enriched single-atom-like Pt1 site, is placed around the nanoparticles."
          [5] "Thus, PtGaCaPb/SiO2 exhibits an outstandingly high catalytic stability, even at 600C (kd=0.00033h1, τ=3067h), and almost no deactivation of the catalyst was observed for up to 1month for the first time."

[1] "To expose the loaded Pt on the surface of the carriers, ion exchange and impregnation are two simple and practical methods. The dispersion of Pt mainly depends on the precursors of Pt, the preparation conditions, the properties of the carriers, and the interaction between Pt and the carriers, as well as the additives."
          [2] "The addition of a second metal has been found to be highly effective for the sintering resistance of Pt particles. The introduced metal forms alloys with Pt around Pt particles,63 and the alloys anchor them on the surface of the carriers, making them not easy to migrate and coalesce."
          [3] "The application of the carriers possessing a strong interaction with Pt is another way to retard the sintering. Al2O3 is the most common carrier of Pt catalyst, in which the coordinatively unsaturated pentacoordinate Al3+ can anchor Pt to make it not easy to migrate."
          [4] "Nanocarbon was also reported as the carrier of Pt to improve the sintering resistance, and the strong metalcarrier interaction leads to the electron transfer from nanocarbon to the Pt particles, significantly preventing the sintering of Pt."
          [5] "MgAl2O4 spinel is also a good choice as the carrier. Generally, Pt is not directly loaded on MgAl2O4 spinel prepared beforehand, but firstly loaded into the spaces between the layers of MgAlOx hydrotalcite, and then Pt particles are enclosed in the interspace of MgAl2O4 spinel formed through the collapse of the layered structure of the hydrotalcite after calcination at high temperature."
          [6] "Moliner et al.67 reported effective methods to encapsulate Pt in highly siliceous chabazite, and the catalyst showed enhanced stability towards Pt sintering even at 650750 C in the atmospheres of H2, O2 and H2O."
          [7] "The Al2O3 overcoat has also proved to be efficient in preventing the sintering of Pt nanoparticles through atomic layer deposition."
          [8] "Tanabe et al. revealed that no Pt sintering was observed for Pt/MgO as an automotive exhaust catalyst after calcination in air at 900 C, for the formation of a Mg2PtO4-like compound prevents the migration of Pt."
          [9] "Nagai et al. found that CeO2 had a similar effect of MgO in preventing the sintering of Pt due to the formation of the PtOCe bond in the Pt/CeO2 catalyst."
          [10] "Recently, Pt supported on CeO2 has attracted more attention because of the ability of CeO2 to trap Pt in an atomically dispersed state."
          [11] "The atomically dispersed Pt is most likely to be present in the form of Pt2+ bonded to the ubiquitous step edges of the CeO2 surface."
          [12] "The addition of Ga, In, Zn, Cu, Ir, Co to Pt catalysts exhibits similar effects as Sn."
          [13] "Not only that, but Sattler et al.84 showed that in the highly active, selective and stable PtGaK/Al2O3 (0.1 wt% Pt, 3 wt% Ga, 0.25 wt% K) catalyst for the dehydrogenation of propane, the coordinately unsaturated Ga3+ is responsible for activating the CH bond, and Pt only acts as a promoter."
          [14] "Furthermore, just like the PtSn/CeO2 catalyst,29 the reactivity can be fully recovered via simple coke burning in air, although the sintering of Pt still occurs."
          [15] "Located at the same main group with Ga, In was also reported to be the promoter of supported Pt catalysts. The PtIn/Mg(Al)O catalyst prepared at pH 8 using the co-precipitation method exhibits the best catalytic performance and the strongest interaction between the metal phase and the carrier."
          [16] "B and Si, two nonmetal elements, can play similar roles, too. Dehydrogenation of n-butane over the PtB/SiO2 catalyst showed improved catalytic activity and stability compared with Pt/SiO2."
          [17] "Dadras et al.86 called B a magic bullet against sintering and coking, and they summarized the positive roles of B as follows. The non-stoichiometric PtB cluster is anchored to the carrier via a covalent BO bond, which is much stronger than the interaction between Pt clusters and the carrier surface."
          [18] "Additionally, the dissociation energy of a Pt atom from a PtB cluster is significantly larger than that from the pure Pt cluster, increasing the sintering resistance."
          [19] "Finally, the affinity of PtB cluster to C also drops dramatically, leading to the reduced coke formation and increased selectivity to olefins."
          [20] "It is predicted by a computational screening of main-group elements as potential additives for the Pt catalyst that Si, just as B, can modify the selectivity of the Pt catalyst by changing both electronic and geometric properties."

[1] "In this review, we outline the progress of these dehydrogenation catalysts that have been mainly developed in the past five years. For different classes of the most-promising catalysts in the selective dehydrogenation of ethane-to-ethylene and propane-to-propylene, their syntheses, structural information, catalytic properties and mechanisms are comparatively summarized."
          [2] "The synthesis parameters influence the metal particle size for the as-obtained Pt-based catalysts."
          [3] "The synthesis approach can also be applied to tailor the size and phase of bimetallic nanoparticles."
          [4] "The synthesis parameters influence the metal particle size for the as-obtained Pt-based catalysts."
          [5] "The synthesis chemistry contributes to the stabilization effect of Pt through strong PtOCe bonds."
          [6] "The synthesis strategy has been reported for the zeolite-confined Pt single-atom and nanocluter catalysts with high stability."
          [7] "The synthesis procedure can maintain the porous texture and anchor the active Pt-based metals."
          [8] "The synthesis method is used to prepare uniform PtIn bimetal nanoparticles."
          [9] "The synthesis approach is used to prepare the well-defined surface metal species by employing the single-site metal precursors."

          [11] "The synthesis procedure can achieve the formation of the Sn single-site located in the frameworks."
          [12] "The synthesis method allows it to serve as a potent ion-exchanger, resulting in the stabilization of the highly dispersed bimetallic PtZn sites by the ETS-2 support."

[1] "To improve the stability of Pt-based catalysts, many efforts have been dedicated to strengthen metalsupport interactions by using various methods including the nanopore-encaged metal strategy,2124 wet-chemistry approach2529 and modification of supports.10,11,30,31 Among them, modification of supports is a relatively effective and simple method to improve the stability of Pt-based catalysts."
          [2] "For example, Lu et al. reported a PtSn/Al2O3 sheet catalyst for PDH, exhibiting high activity, selectivity and stability.11 It was proposed that the enhanced stability in PDH was associated with γ-Al2O3 nanosheets containing a great deal of pentacoordinate Al3+ ions, which can stabilize PtSn clusters by strong interactions between metals and supports."
          [3] "Recent work by Ma et al. showed that the addition of Ga into Mg(Al)O layer double hydrotalcites could greatly enhance the stability of Pt catalysts in PDH.10 It may be due to the fact that pentacoordinate Ga3+ ions could disperse and stabilize PtSn clusters, thereby enhancing the electronic interactions between Pt and Ga."
          [4] "A similar conclusion regarding the importance of modification of supports has been reported in the case of PtSn/CeO2 catalysts.30"
          [5] "Therefore, this provides a way to tune and enhance the catalytic activity and selectivity for the PDH process, and also introduces unique stability characteristics for bimetallic systems."
          [6] "Herein, highly stable Pt/Sn-Si-beta catalysts for PDH were prepared by an improved post-synthesis strategy, which consists of dealumination of H-beta and subsequent metal impregnation."
          [7] "It is indicated that Sn species existing in tetrahedral coordination states were incorporated into the framework of dealuminated beta (Si-beta)."
          [8] "Meanwhile, Pt species were highly dispersed in the form of ultra-small nanoclusters on Pt/Sn-Si-beta due to the strong interaction between Pt and Sn(IV) sites confined in the Si-beta framework."
          [9] "The prepared Pt/Sn-Si-beta catalysts show excellent catalytic performance for PDH, in which the propene formation rate was 2.3 mol g1Pt h1 with a propene selectivity of >99% at 550 C and the higher propene formation rate was 3.1 mol g1Pt h1 at 600 C."
          [10] "Moreover, the strong PtSn interactions and the confinement effect of Sn in the Si-beta framework inhibit the coke and sintering of Pt clusters, thereby achieving good stability of dehydrogenation and regeneration with almost unchanged catalytic activity during four cycles at 550 C."



[1] "Although the direct dehydrogenation technique has been industrialized, the fabrication of the corresponding catalysts is still confronted with a series of plights."
          [2] "Decades have witnessed the efforts made and strategies proposed by devoted researchers to optimize the catalyst performance and improve the catalytic stability from a wide panorama."
          [3] "In this section, strategies focused on catalytic stability enhancement in recently reported works are summarized."
          [4] "Effectively regulating the active compounds in both Pt-based catalysts and metal oxide-based catalysts can be achieved by soundly introducing promoters."
          [5] "Promoters can greatly impact the catalytic behaviors in PDH catalysts, showing advantages in suppression of side reactions, inhibition of coke deposition, stabilizing active compounds and so on."
          [6] "Metallic Pt has already been recognized as an effective catalyst for alkane dehydrogenation reactions due to its high affinity for paraffinic CH bonds."
          [7] "Currently, adding metal promoters to form alloys or intermetallic compounds is one of the most effective methods to ameliorate central active components and inhibit catalytic deactivation in Pt-based catalytic systems."
          [8] "Sn is a widely utilized promoter for Pt catalysts."
          [9] "The PtGa catalyst system has also been implemented in production plants (FCDh technique)."
          [10] "In has also been developed as a promising promoter of Pt-based catalysts."
          [11] "Zn is another analogous but economical promoter for Pt-based catalysts."
          [12] "Many other metals, including Fe, Cu, and Co, can also be promoters for Pt-based catalysts to adjust the electronic properties and improve the dispersion of Pt atoms for further stability enhancement."
          [13] "Alloying of Pt with rare-earth elements (REEs) has barely been accomplished through the conventional H2 reduction route due to the low chemical potential of REE oxides."
          [14] "Supported metal oxide-based catalysts, including CoOx-, ZnOx-, VOx-, and CrOx-based catalysts, are other important PDH catalysts and have been extensively studied for decades."
          [15] "Introducing another metal oxide to form an oxide compound is an effective approach to improve the dispersion of active species and enhance the catalytic stability under the applied conditions, showing advantages in modifying the coordination and electronic state of host metal oxide sites."
          [16] "The introduction of an appropriate metal oxide or noble metal into a catalytic system can greatly enhance the catalytic performance."



[1] "Extensive research efforts have been made to inhibit deactivation and improve propene selectivity of Pt-based catalysts by doping promoters of Sn [9,10], In [11,12], Ga [13,14] and Cu [15] to form bimetallic catalysts."
          [2] "For example, PtIn [16] and PtGa [17,18] bimetallic nanoparticles (NPs) supported on calcined hydrotalcites (HT) show higher activity and selectivity in PDH, which has been attributed to the increased Pt dispersion and electron transfer from In or Ga to Pt [11,18]."
          [3] "Besides promoters, another method is to modify Al2O3 support with ZnO [19], La2O3 [20] or TiO2 [21] or replace Al2O3 support with ZnAl2O4 [22], ZSM-5 [23] or Mg(Al)O oxide [8,24]."
          [4] "Additionally, it has been verified that the single Pt atom sites on Pt-Sn/γ-Al2O3 with a sandwich structure are more favorable for PDH reaction than Pt ensembles [25,26]."
          [5] "Gong et al. [15] also reported that the PtCu single atom alloys can enhance the propane conversion and propene selectivity simultaneously in PDH."
          [6] "Whether as promoters or supports, an important aim of using them is to obtain highly and stably dispersed Pt-based catalysts so that improving PDH performance."
          [7] "However, it is still difficult to break through these challenges for PDH reactions [27], and the exact Pt-M-support relationship is still unclear."
          [8] "Therefore, it is extremely necessary to find more efficient methods to solve the problems mentioned above."
          [9] "In fact, the hierarchical morphology and porous structure play important roles in many heterogeneous catalytic reactions. However, the effect of hierarchical microstructure is seldom reported."
          [10] "Given that the small Pt NPs and hierarchical microstructure may provide more stable and easily accessible active sites for PDH reaction, a promising design for obtaining the desired size of active Pt and hierarchical pore morphology was proposed."
          [11] "The promoted effects of HT reconstruction on the microstructure and morphology of the 3D oxide nanosheet array catalyst, and the subsequently superior PDH performance, were profoundly discussed."

Stable and selective catalysts for propane dehydrogenation operating at thermodynamic limit Hitting the limits on propene synthesis The greater abundance of propane from shale gas has spurred efforts to use it as a propylene feedstock. Direct dehydrogenation catalysts consisting of platinumtin alloy nanoparticles supported on alumina often must run with hydrogen dilution to avoid carbon buildup and excess tin to avoid alloy segregation.
          We report that silica-supported platinum-tin (Pt1Sn1) nanoparticles (&lt;2 nanometers in diameter) can operate as a PDH catalyst at thermodynamically limited conversion levels, with excellent stability and selectivity to propylene (&gt;99%). Atomic mixing of Pt and Sn in the precursor is preserved upon reduction and during catalytic operation. The benign interaction of these nanoparticles with the silicon dioxide support does not lead to Pt-Sn segregation and formation of a tin oxide phase that can occur over traditional catalyst supports.
          To alleviate this issue, large quantities of Sn are used in the catalyst preparation (the nominal atomic loading is Sn:Pt between 4 and 5), which increases the yield of intermetallic PtSn NPs (12). In addition, studies have shown that adding hydrogen to the reactant feed reduces the rate of catalyst deactivation (13). Although this strategy is implemented commercially (10), addition of hydrogen in the feed lowers the thermodynamic limit on per-pass propane conversion (fig. S1) and decreases productivity (7).
          We developed a PDH catalyst that operates at thermodynamically limited conversion levels without the addition of hydrogen to the feed and exhibits excellent stability and selectivity to propylene (&gt;99%). The catalyst is composed of silica-supported Pt1Sn1 NPs, synthesized and pretreated to ensure that the mixing of Pt and Sn is preserved during catalytic operation.
          The principle behind catalyst synthesis is to begin with a heterometallic Pt-Sn coordination complex in which Pt and Sn are in immediate contact, and this interaction is retained during the reduction and PDH reaction.
          The data in Fig. 1, A to C, were obtained with 16 vol % propane in helium. Propane streams are diluted in commercial operations to increase the limiting equilibrium conversion, which is higher at lower propane partial pressure (fig. S2), and to limit catalyst deactivation rates (7, 16, 17). This approach requires additional downstream separation units and limits process efficiency.
          The data in Fig. 1, A to C, show the performance of the Pt1Sn1/SiO2 catalyst (1 wt % Pt and 0.6 wt % Sn) for propane dehydrogenation at 580C, 16 vol % propane (with the remainder helium) and at a weight hourly space velocity (WHSV) of 4.7 hours1. Under these reaction conditions, the thermodynamic limit on propane conversion is 66.5% (fig. S2). The Pt1Sn1/SiO2 catalyst showed near-thermodynamic conversion of &gt;66% (Fig. 1A, red circles) and &gt;99% selectivity to propylene (Fig. 1B, red circles).
          The data in Fig. 1D show that, under these conditions, the propane conversion goes from 41 to 39% in 120 min. Under identical conditions, the other tested catalysts deactivate very rapidly to very low conversion, as illustrated for the commercial mimic. A transmission electron microscopy (TEM) image of the spent catalyst, after 120 min of PDH reaction, is shown in fig. S6. The image shows that the Pt-Sn NPs are well dispersed, with an average particle diameter of 1.6  0.67 nm, which is consistent with the particle size in fresh samples.
          We attempted to regenerate the Pt1Sn1/SiO2 catalyst by oxidation, using 1% O2 as a mild oxidant at 500C followed by reduction at 600C (see supplementary materials for details of the regeneration procedure). The regeneration studies showed that Pt1Sn1/SiO2 catalysts can be partially regenerated. For example, we measured 97% of the initial activity and &gt;99% of the initial selectivity after three PDH/regeneration cycles (fig. S5).
          Data in Fig. 3A show that the process of mixing chloroplatinic acid (H2PtCl6) and tin(II) chloride (SnCl2) in 0.1 M hydrochloric acid solution formed a heterometallic Pt-Sn coordination complex.
          A bright-field TEM image of Pt-Sn NPs formed on SiO2 upon the reduction of the Pt-Sn complex shows high metal dispersion on the support, with an average NP size of 1.3  0.6 nm (Fig. 3B). The NP size distribution (Fig. 3C) shows that most NPs were &lt;2 nm. The XRD spectra in Fig. 3D show that the formed NPs were essentially alloys of Pt and Sn. This finding is supported by the presence of the XRD peaks corresponding to Pt1Sn1 (41.8 and 44.1) and Pt3Sn1 (39.0 and 45.3) stoichiometries.
          The real-space Pt LIII EXAFS spectra for the Pt1Sn1/SiO2 catalyst (Fig. 4D) are substantially different from the spectra of monometallic Pt and indicate the mixing of Pt and Sn atoms. The best-fit spectrum for the Pt1Sn1/SiO2 catalyst is characterized by the presence of the Pt-Pt and Pt-Sn scattering paths, consistent with the formation of PtSn intermetallic phases.









[1] "Pt-Sn clusters anchored at Al3+penta sites as a sinter-resistant and regenerable catalyst for propane dehydrogenation"
          [2] "Herein, a series of highly ordered mesoporous Al2O3 supports with different levels of Al3+penta sites, are fabricated and used as the support to disperse Pt-Sn2 clusters."
          [3] "The stability and regenerability of Pt-Sn2/meso-Al2O3 are strongly dependent on the content of Al3+penta sites in the Al2O3 structure, and a high level of Al3+penta sites can effectively prevent the agglomeration of Pt-Sn2 clusters into large Pt nanoparticles in the consecutive dehydrogenation-regeneration cycles."



[1] "Rare-earthplatinum alloy nanoparticles in mesoporous zeolite for catalysis Platinum is a much used catalyst that, in petrochemical processes, is often alloyed with other metals to improve catalytic activity, selectivity and longevity1,2,3,4,5."
          [2] "Such catalysts are usually prepared in the form of metallic nanoparticles supported on porous solids, and their production involves reducing metal precursor compounds under a H2 flow at high temperatures6."
          [3] "The method works well when using easily reducible late transition metals, but Pt alloy formation with rare-earth elements through the H2 reduction route is almost impossible owing to the low chemical potential of rare-earth element oxides6."
          [4] "Here we use as support a mesoporous zeolite that has pore walls with surface framework defects (called silanol nests) and show that the zeolite enables alloy formation between Pt and rare-earth elements."
          [5] "We find that the silanol nests enable the rare-earth elements to exist as single atomic species with a substantially higher chemical potential compared with that of the bulk oxide, making it possible for them to diffuse onto Pt."
          [6] "High-resolution transmission electron microscopy and hydrogen chemisorption measurements indicate that the resultant bimetallic nanoparticles supported on the mesoporous zeolite are intermetallic compounds, which we find to be stable, highly active and selective catalysts for the propane dehydrogenation reaction."
          [7] "When used with late transition metals, the same preparation strategy produces Pt alloy catalysts that incorporate an unusually large amount of the second metal and, in the case of the PtCo alloy, show high catalytic activity and selectivity in the preferential oxidation of carbon monoxide in H2."
          [8] "The industrial PDH process has been using PtSn bimetallic catalysts supported on porous alumina for nearly three decades, since its discovery in the early 1990s3,7."
          [9] "The Pt metal alone exhibits high initial catalytic activity, but rapidly deactivates as a result of coke deposition on the Pt surface."
          [10] "The coke deposition also causes an undesirable loss of the catalytic selectivity to propylene."
          [11] "To alleviate these problems, Sn is introduced to form an alloy with Pt nanoparticles and thereby dilute the Pt surface with inactive Sn atoms and break up coke-generating Pt ensembles."
          [12] "Our search for a highly active and more durable PDH catalyst has focused on using a siliceous MFI zeolite with a hierarchical micro-/mesoporous structure as a replacement for the alumina support."
          [13] "This zeolite, synthesized using a multi-ammonium surfactant as a structure-directing agent, has attracted attention as an advanced catalyst support8,9,10,11,12,13 owing to its unique structure, which comprises ultrathin zeolite frameworks and three-dimensionally interconnected mesopores that boost the catalytic performance of supported metals by providing both facile reactant and product diffusion and high metal nanoparticle dispersion within the mesopores12,13."
          [14] "The formation of the Pt3La and Pt3Y nanoparticles on the degallated zeolite brought a striking enhancement in all aspects of the PDH catalytic performance, including activity, selectivity and durability, as shown in Fig. 2."
          [15] "The catalytic reaction was performed at 580C using a pure propane flow at a large space velocity (see Methods), and these harsh operating conditions caused even the conventional PtSn/alumina catalyst to experience severe coke formation and catalyst deactivation within 1 d."
          [16] "In sharp contrast, the Pt3La intermetallic nanoparticles supported on the degallated zeolite (denoted as PtLa/mz-deGa, where mz stands for mesoporous zeolite) showed a high initial propane conversion of 40% (close to the equilibrium conversion) and underwent extremely slow deactivation, retaining 8% conversion even after 30 days of reaction."
          [17] "The PtREE incorporation in the mesoporous zeolite was conducted by co-impregnation of aqueous solutions of Pt(NH3)4(NO3)2 and either La(NO3)3·6H2O or Y(NO3)3·6H2O, followed by heating under an O2 flow at 350C and subsequently under H2 at 700C (see Methods)."
          [18] "The formation of the Pt3La and Pt3Y nanoparticles on the degallated zeolite brought a striking enhancement in all aspects of the PDH catalytic performance, including activity, selectivity and durability, as shown in Fig. 2."

          [23] "The effect of the remaining Ga was examined from the differences in PDH performance of mz-deGa, La/mz-deGa and Pt/mz-deGa, as shown in Extended Data Fig. 7."
          [24] "The PtREE/zeolite as a support would allow the discovery of not only REE-based alloy catalysts, but also other transition metal-based alloy catalysts with various compositions and structures, opening up new opportunities for catalytic applications."

[1] "Although the equilibrium conversion of alkanes increases with temperature, alkene selectivity decreases with increasing temperature and chain length due to an increased tendency toward dehydrocyclization/aromatisation, thermal cracking and coke formation."
          [2] "Direct dehydrogenation of lower alkanes is an energy intensive reaction; however, oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) has the potential to lower the energy requirement for achieving dehydrogenation."
          [3] "ODH can be considered as tandem endothermic (dehydrogenation, CnH2n + 2  CnH2n + H2) and exothermic (oxidation, H2 + O2  H2O) processes, with an overall thermodynamic summation, CnH2n + 2 + O2  CnH2n + H2O."
          [4] "Although the process is not thermo-neutral, part of the energy required for the endothermic reaction is augmented by the exothermic reaction."
          [5] "Thus, ODH of alkanes takes place at lower temperature compared to the corresponding non-ODH."
          [6] "This lower temperature requirement of ODH compared to non-ODH and cracking is encouraging and provides motivation for continued efforts to develop ODH into an industrial technology."
          [7] "Although ODH is attractive because of the energy intensification advantage, commercial ODH technologies hinge on innovative catalyst and process design, i.e. proper synergy of the endothermic dehydrogenation step with the exothermic hydrogen combustion and design of selective CH and hydrogen combustion catalysts."

          [12] "Catalyst improvement endeavors can benefit from insights on alkane CH bond activation mechanisms."
          [13] "Developing direct routes to obtain key organic chemicals from lower alkanes would benefit industry."
          [14] "Lower alkanes are relatively inert, and they exhibit little or no reactivity at conditions typical for activating functional group reactions in organic compounds because they lack low-lying vacant orbitals or lone pair electrons."
          [15] "Alkanes are made up non-polar CC and CH bonds. These bonds consist of strongly localised electron pairs that are usually induced to reactivity under severe conditions (e.g., at high temperature or pressure, or with the use of aggressive reagents)."
          [16] "The first and rate-limiting step of alkane dehydrogenation using platinum or chromium oxide-based catalysts involves CH activation."
          [17] "Although a number of efforts have been made to gain insight on the mechanism of the reaction, questions still remain, especially regarding the pathway of the CH activation."
          [18] "It is of fundamental and applied interest to know whether the first CH bond cleavage is homolytic or heterolytic."
          [19] "If it is a heterolytic pathway, it will further be of interest to know whether the first hydrogen from the alkane substrate is abstracted as a proton or as a hydride ion."
          [20] "This knowledge will benefit catalyst improvement efforts."
          [21] "The simple impregnation techniques for preparing supported (especially alumina) metal and oxide catalysts becloud their structural heterogeneity."

          [25] "Although several solid acid catalysts are used in alkane conversions, zeolites have the advantage of possessing a well-defined structure, allowing the structure-activity relationship to be easily deduced."
          [26] "Therefore, it is instructive to examine non-oxidative dehydrogenation of light alkanes over zeolite catalysts."
          [27] "A detailed knowledge of the adsorption mechanism of lower alkane molecules on zeolite is of interest in this context, especially for informed tuning of zeolite properties to allow efficient and selective dehydrogenation of alkanes."
          [28] "Light alkanes are adsorbed on zeolites via dispersive interaction."
          [29] "Protons and the exchanged metals ions are typically the active sites in zeolites, while the zeolite framework plays the role of anchor for the active sites and/or dispersion medium for the reactants."
          [30] "The framework of microporous zeolites exerts dispersive forces on the reactant's molecules that depend on the shape, channel and cavity of the framework."
          [31] "In addition, the nature and the density of the active sites influence the framework dispersion forces."
          [32] "Recent reports have shown that the strong electrostatic field between protons or exchanged metal ions and basic oxygen species can enhance and/or induce polarization of bonds in hydrocarbon adsorbates."
          [33] "This agrees with Hashiguchi et al., who found enhanced activation of the CH bond on a homogeneous catalyst."
          [34] "Wender et al. showed that 3040% of heat adsorption in n-alkanes on Na-zeolite is due to polarization of the adsorbates."
          [35] "Subbotina et al. also demonstrated that the CH bond of ethane is more strongly polarized on Mg2 + and Ca2 + forms of Y zeolite than on Na+ forms."
          [36] "Mg2 +-Y zeolite molecules exhibit weaker adsorption and polarization of ethane than Ca2 +-zeolites."
          [37] "Based on charge density considerations, Mg2 + cations are expected to exhibit a stronger polarizing effect than Ca2 + cations."
          [38] "Subbotina et al. explain that because of the smaller ionic radius of Mg2 +, it is more strongly shielded by the surrounding oxygen atoms of the zeolite lattice than a Ca2 + ion, thereby reducing the polarizing effect of Mg2 + on the hydrocarbon adsorbate."
          [39] "Sievers et al. also report that the La3 + form of X zeolite induces strong polarization of adsorbed alkane molecules; partial positive charges were induced on secondary and tertiary carbon atoms of alkane molecules."
          [40] "The authors suggest that the polarization may be viewed as an intermediate condition to hydride abstraction (which is an important elementary step in CH activation)."
          [41] "They add that CH bond polarization was enhanced by physisorbed water molecules that coordinate with La3 + cations."
          [42] "The enhanced polarization of CH bonds by the presence of water molecules on La3 +X zeolite may have a beneficial effect in oxidative dehydrogenation where water is a by-product."
          [43] "Alkane polarization studies on Na+, Mg2 +, Ca2 +, and La3 + exchanged X-zeolites indicate that the polarizing effect increases with increasing charge magnitude and ionic radius."
          [44] "Note that these alkane polarizing cations occupy the same position on the zeolites as the well-known CH activation cations/metals, and thus the CH polarizing effect has a complementary effect on CH activation."
          [45] "This may add to the number of relevant variables and increase the challenge of optimizing the ratio of activation/polarizing cations among exchangeable sites (Si/Al ratio), as well as the sequence for incorporating the cations or metals during catalyst preparation."
          [46] "Further, it is important to note that the choice of cations should be such that they exhibit no catalytic (oligomerization, isomerization, aromatisation or oxidation) effects on the target alkene products at the reaction condition."
          [47] "Furthermore, it may be beneficial to create a CH polarization effect on the zeolite framework."
          [48] "This can be achieved by appropriate chance of framework atoms."
          [49] "Since active sites are usually created on the zeolite frameworks."
          [50] "The activation of CH bonds of light alkanes occurs readily on super electrophiles (super Brnsted and super Lewis acid) at low temperatures."
          [51] "Although CH activation on zeolites have been observed at low temperatures, industrial alkane reactions on zeolites are usually carried out at high temperatures."
          [52] "Several experimental and theoretical studies on the molecular dynamics of light alkanes on zeolite have been published."
          [53] "However, despite the decades of intensive investigations on the subject, the actual mechanism of CH activation on acid zeolite is still debated."
          [54] "Two CH activation paths are generally recognized: the unimolecular/protolytic mechanism and the bimolecular/carbenium chain mechanism."
          [55] "The unimolecular mechanism involves direct protonation of an alkane-forming carbonium ion intermediate."
          [56] "The proton can be inserted into either a CC or CH bond of the alkane."
          [57] "Proton insertion through the CC bond leads to cracking of the alkane, with the acid site regenerated."
          [58] "Insertion through the HC bond yields H2 and a carbenium ion/alkoxide intermediate."
          [59] "Desorption of alkene from the intermediate regenerates the acid, or the alkoxide can enter the bimolecular conversion path."
          [60] "In the bimolecular mechanism of CH activation, the alkoxide intermediate constitutes the active sites and CH activation occurs through hydride transfer from a second alkane molecule forming another alkoxide."
          [61] "This may be followed by βscission to regenerate the active site and complete the catalytic cycle."
          [62] "For example, activation of propane on acid zeolite based on the two mechanisms is illustrated in Scheme 1."
          [63] "Low reactant partial pressure and high temperature favor unimolecular dehydrogenation of alkane on acid zeolite."
          [64] "These conditions favor the endothermic desorption step (rate limiting step) leading to propene."
          [65] "In contrast, high partial pressure and low temperature favor the bimolecular mechanism leading to a low propene yield."
          [66] "The two molecular mechanisms devoid of side reactions give fairly predictable product distribution."
          [67] "However, the products of each route are prone to side reactions (dimerization, oligomerization, isomerization & aromatisation) in the presence of Bronsted acid sites."
          [68] "Hence propene selectivity on acidic zeolite is very low and products rich in aromatics are usually obtained."
          [69] "The active sites (alkoxide intermediate) of the bimolecular pathway are formed in situ."
          [70] "The alkoxide intermediate is made up of an alkyl carbenium ion ionically held to the zeolite framework oxygen ion."
          [71] "The active sites of the unimolecular pathway are the charge balancing protons of the zeolite framework."
          [72] "A proton and a carbenium ion are an electrophilic or Lewis acid species (a proton can also be considered as a special case of Lewis acidity)."
          [73] "The two pathways essentially involve electrophilic CH activation."
          [74] "The electrophiles (proton and carbenium ion) activate CH at high temperatures (500 C), giving low conversion rates of light alkanes and poor selectivity to corresponding alkenes."
          [75] "Iglesia and co-workers used isotopic labeling studies to demonstrate that CH activation is not the rate-limiting step in the dehydrogenation of propane on H-ZSM-5 and Ga/H-ZSM-5."
          [76] "They proposed that the CH bond cleavage produces an H-adatom and an alkoxide intermediate."
          [77] "Desorption of an alkene from the alkoxide regenerates the proton sites on the zeolites."
          [78] "An alkoxide intermediate may also discharge as a hydrogen rich species through cracking."
          [79] "Iglesia et al. proposed that desorption or disposal of the H-adatom from the CH bond cleavage is the rate-limiting step."
          [80] "A similar deduction was reached by Yu et al."
          [81] "who found that desorption of the alkoxides intermediate is the rate-limiting step under conditions that favor the unimolecular mechanism."
          [82] "The above proposition has been demonstrated on metal (e.g., Ga, Zn, and Co) exchanged zeolites."
          [83] "The specific role of the exchanged metals has been the subject of several reports with special attention on Ga and Zn."
          [84] "Although the framework Ga2O3 on H-MFI seems to have a CH polarization effect on desorbed methane, Ga2O3 exhibits lower CH activation activity."
          [85] "The physical mixture of Ga2O3/HMFI displays higher propane aromatisation activity than pure H-MFI."
          [86] "Similar synergistic effects have been reported for Zn/H-MFI and Co/H-MFI."
          [87] "Exchanged cations behave as monomeric species at the exchange sites of zeolite."
          [88] "Iglesia and Biscardi hypothesized that the monomeric species enhance propane conversion by promoting re-combinative desorption (RD) of the H-adatom formed from the CH cleavage."
          [89] "It is worthwhile noting that the exchange cations (electrophilic species) constitute the CH activation sites."
          [90] "Hence, more insights are required about their additional role in promoting RD."
          [91] "However, the authors did not provide further information on the nature of the H-adatoms and the mechanism of RD."
          [92] "In the next section, we examine the mechanism of desorption of H-adatoms over Ga and Zn exchanged H-ZSM-5."
          [93] "The exchanged metal ions in zeolites are held ionically by one or more basic oxygen atoms."
          [94] "Different species have been suggested, depending on the density of the cation exchange site of the zeolite and method of introduction of the metals."
          [95] "According to Kanansky et al."
          [96] "the exchanged Zn and Ga species on H-ZSM-5 and their mechanism of CH activation are distinctively different."
          [97] "Zn and Ga are introduced on H-ZSM-5 through a vapor deposition technique using Zn metal vapor and Ga(CH3)3 as the source of Zn and Ga, respectively."
          [98] "The metal introduction technique allows quantitative exchange of the zeolite protons which leads to Zn/Al = 0.5 and Ga/Al = 1, respectively."
          [99] "Zn2 + is generated directly, but Ga+ is produced by H2 treatment at 500 C to release the methyl groups."
          [100] "The proposed active sites are OZn2+O and OGa+, respectively."
          [101] "The mechanism of CH activation with ethane by the two sites under the same reaction conditions are summarized in Scheme 2."
          [102] "The proposed mechanism is in agreement with the mechanism suggested from calculations using the GAUSSIAN 94 program for ethane activation on Zn-exchanged zeolite by Frash and van Santen."
          [103] "In another theoretical study using a DFT cluster modeling approach, Pidko and van Santen compared the activation energy of CH with three types of Zn species at active sites: OZn2+O, OZn+OZn+O and HOZn+ O."
          [104] "The authors suggest that the reaction proceeds most easily on OZn2+O, and hypothesize that the enhanced Lewis activity of OZn2+O facilitates CH heterolytic cleavage."
          [105] "They further argue that the first proton abstraction occurs preferentially on the oxygen sites neighboring the ring where the cation is located."
          [106] "They proposed a one-step reaction to yield H2 and C2H4 from the decomposition of the Zn-alkyl and proton."
          [107] "A proposed mechanism of CH activation on OGa+ has similarly been suggested using theoretical calculations."
          [108] "High alkene selectivities are obtained on the H-ZSM-5 when exchangeable protons are rigorously replaced by Zn and Ga."
          [109] "The Zn-exchanged H-ZSM-5 had higher ethane conversion rates but lower ethene selectivity than its Ga counterpart."
          [110] "The CH activation on the OZn2+O site can be described by a Lewis base-assisted deprotonation mechanism."
          [111] "This is accompanied by conversion of the Lewis base site to a conjugate Bronsted acid site."
          [112] "The OGa+ site, however, activates the CH bond via oxidative addition without a protonic site intermediate."
          [113] "A protonic site intermediate increases tendency of side reactions on the Zn-exchanged H-ZSM-5 relative to the Ga counterpart."
          [114] "The elementary steps of CH activation on OGa+ (Scheme 2) reveal that a redox cycle at the metal center is required for catalytic CH activation via the oxidative addition mechanism."
          [115] "A redox cycle is not apparent in the elementary step presented for CH activation on OZn2+O."
          [116] "Hence, a redox cycle is not a requisite for CH activation via the Lewis base-assisted deprotonation mechanism."
          [117] "However, under alkane dehydrogenation reaction conditions, the OZn2+O sites can undergo a reversible Zn2 +/Zn redox process."
          [118] "This redox process increases the availability of undesired protonic site intermediates."
          [119] "Zn-exchanged H-ZSM-5 prepared by conventional ion-exchange methods contain a significant percentage of unexchanged proton sites leading to lower alkene selectivity of the catalyst."
          [120] "Iglesia and Biscardi titrate the proton sites with NaOH."
          [121] "The un-titrated and the titrated catalysts are denoted as Zn/H-ZSMS-5 and Zn/Na-ZSMS-5, respectively."
          [122] "Zn/Na-ZSM-5 has four times the propane conversion rate and a higher propene selectivity than Zn/H-ZSMS-5."
          [123] "The propene formation rate obtained with Zn/Na-ZSM-5 was ten times that of Zn/H-ZSMS-5."
          [124] "The zinc species at the cation exchange site of the zeolite was identified as OZn+OH."
          [125] "The higher propene selectivity obtained on Zn/Na-ZSM-5 compared to Zn/H-ZSMS-5 is presumably from the lower density and availability of proton sites on Zn/Na-ZSM-5."
          [126] "The improved propane conversion rate of Zn/Na-ZSM-5 compared to Zn/H-ZSM-5 is attributable to the higher efficiency of OZn+OH sites in catalyzing desorption of H-adatoms than OZn2+O sites."
          [127] "Another strategy to enhance alkene selectivity is by controlling the strength of the proton sites."
          [128] "The acidity of the sites depends on the nature of the trivalent cation of the zeolite framework."
          [129] "Proton sites in borosilicate zeolites are weaker than those of aluminosilicate, and thus higher alkene selectivity is expected for alkane dehydrogenation over Zn/H[B]-ZSM-5 compared to Zn/H[Al]-ZSM-5."
          [130] "However, Zn/H[B]-ZSM-5 shows no activity for propane dehydrogenation."
          [131] "The desired weaker acidity of the proton sites of Zn/H[B]-ZSM-5 requires weaker basicity of the oxygen atoms in the zeolite framework."
          [132] "This reduced basicity of the oxygen atoms is not sufficiently polarizing to complement the exchanged Zn2 + in CH bond cleavage."
          [133] "In the next section, we examine use of zeolite support to design a Pt-based alkane dehydrogenation catalyst."
          [134] "Elimination of the proton sites of zeolites is critical for obtaining a high alkene selectivity and stability in dehydrogenation catalysts."
          [135] "Pt is the most versatile noble metal catalyst for alkane reactions."
          [136] "Although Pt is expensive, the choice of Pt is often justified by its higher activity, stability and selectivity for these reactions compared to less expensive alternative transition metals."
          [137] "However, rapid catalyst deactivation due to coke formation remains a challenge even when using a Pt-based catalyst for dehydrogenation of light alkanes."
          [138] "Waku et al."
          [139] "exploited the unique property of zeolite as a support for achieving high metal dispersion through cation exchange sites to create a Pt/Na[Fe]-ZSM-5 catalyst with outstanding stability for dehydrogenation of light alkanes."
          [140] "They found that the catalyst deactivation rate of Pt/Na[Fe]-ZSM-5 was lower than for any other Pt-based catalysts in refractory oxide support."
          [141] "The unprecedented performance of Pt/Na[Fe]-ZSM-5 was attributed to its high Pt dispersion (cluster size < 1 mm) on zeolite through ion-exchange."
          [142] "There is a tendency to generate some Brnsted protons on the zeolite during the exchange process, but the choice of Fe3 + as an isomorphous cation in place of Al3 + led to weaker Brnsted sites in [Fe]-ZSM compared to [Al]-ZSM."
          [143] "The weaker acidity minimizes the tendency of side reactions (cracking of oligomerization, aromatisation, and coke), which translates into higher alkene selectivity and catalyst stability."
          [144] "In another report, Xuebing and Iglesia demonstrated the ability of Pt/Na[Fe]-ZSM-5 to dehydrogenate alkanes longer than C4; n-pentane and n-heptane were selectively converted to n-pentene and n-heptene, respectively."
          [145] "Alkene selectivity was also improved when the residual proton generated during Pt exchange or Na-[Fe]-ZSM was titrated with Cs."
          [146] "Although Pt with conventional refractory oxides (Al2O3, SiO2, ZrO2, etc.) used for dehydrogenation of alkanes has similar conversion rates to Pt/Na[Fe]-ZSM-5, deactivation rates are also rapid due to coke formation."
          [147] "The presence of acid (Bronsted and Lewis) sites on the supports promotes readsorption, oligomerization and aromatisation of alkenes."
          [148] "Promotion of Pt with metals, such as Sn, Ga, Zn, Re, etc., improves catalyst stability, but also leads to faster deactivation rates than Pt/Na[Fe]-ZSM-5."
          [149] "However, recent reports by Bell et al."
          [150] "show that the use of calcined hydrotalcite (Al/Mg  0.1) supported on bimetallic PtGa or PtSn gave very high alkene selectivity and stability, comparable to Pt/Na[Fe]-ZSM-5."
          [151] "At this stage, we can conclude that differences in the performance of Zn and Ga exchanged H-ZSM-5 obtained by Kanansky et al."
          [152] "are attributable to their respective CH activation mechanisms."
          [153] "In addition, the role of exchanged Zn and Ga as promoters of RD becomes evident from the mechanisms (Scheme 2)."
          [154] "The RD mechanism on Ga exchanged H-ZSM-5 is by reductive elimination of a hydrogen molecule from O[Ga(H)2]+ intermediate."
          [155] "Decomposition of ZnR and a protonic site, or neutralization of the proton sites by ZnH, leads to desorption of the hydrogen molecule on the Zn-exchanged H-ZSM-5."
          [156] "By extrapolation, the mechanisms of CH activation on exchanged Zn and Ga H-ZSM-5 can described the mechanism of alkane dehydrogenation on Cr-based and Pt-based catalysts respectively."
          [157] "The electronic promotion effect of Sn is in line with the oxidative addition CH activation mechanism."
          [158] "However, the Lewis base-assisted deprotonation mechanism could also explain the proposed CH activation on Cr-based catalysts."
          [159] "Now, the nature and the role of surface oxygen species become more evident."
          [160] "The role of potassium in commercial Cr and Pt-based dehydrogenation catalysts is to minimize the undesired influence of protonic sites on alkene selectivity."
          [161] "The highlights in this section are presented in Table 2."
          [162] "The table reveals the insights achieved on the reaction mechanism, alkene selectivity and catalyst stability for non-oxidative dehydrogenation of lower alkanes."
          [163] "Nonetheless, the level of catalyst activity is still far from acceptable, even at high temperature."
          [164] "A recent report by Rothenberg et al."
          [165] "provides a lead in this respect."
          [166] "Their report indicates that a porous copperaluminum framework material (stabilized by metal oxide) has better performance (activity/selectivity/stability) for propane dehydrogenation than a PtSn/Al2O3."
          [167] "Of particular interest, is the suggestion that achieving propane dehydrogenation at 350 C may be possible."
          [168] "Few details are known about the structure of the porous copperaluminum framework material."
          [169] "However, copper is implicated as providing the active sites for the catalysis."
          [170] "Also, that the material activated in oxygen gave higher propane conversion rates than those activated in inert gas atmosphere underscores the role of the surface oxide (oxygen species) in the catalysis."
          [171] "Thus, the Lewis base-assisted deprotonation mechanism may be invoked here, and the redox property of the metal center is likely to play a role in achieving propane dehydrogenation at 350 C."
          [172] "This should constitute the future research direction for non-oxidative dehydrogenation of lower alkanes."
          [173] "Although the equilibrium conversion of alkanes increases with temperature, alkene selectivity decreases with increasing temperature and chain length due to an increased tendency toward dehydrocyclization/aromatisation, thermal cracking and coke formation."
          [174] "Direct dehydrogenation of lower alkanes is an energy intensive reaction; however, oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) has the potential to lower the energy requirement for achieving dehydrogenation."
          [175] "ODH can be considered as tandem endothermic (dehydrogenation, CnH2n + 2  CnH2n + H2) and exothermic (oxidation, H2 + O2  H2O) processes, with an overall thermodynamic summation, CnH2n + 2 + O2  CnH2n + H2O."
          [176] "Although the process is not thermo-neutral, part of the energy required for the endothermic reaction is augmented by the exothermic reaction."
          [177] "Thus, ODH of alkanes takes place at lower temperature compared to the corresponding non-ODH."
          [178] "This lower temperature requirement of ODH compared to non-ODH and cracking is encouraging and provides motivation for continued efforts to develop ODH into an industrial technology."
          [179] "Although ODH is attractive because of the energy intensification advantage, commercial ODH technologies hinge on innovative catalyst and process design, i.e. proper synergy of the endothermic dehydrogenation step with the exothermic hydrogen combustion and design of selective CH and hydrogen combustion catalysts."
          [180] "In this report, we provide an overview on CH activation and reaction routes to alkane dehydrogenation."
          [181] "We seek to gain insights about components of the active sites of CH activation to provide a platform for rational design of new efficient catalysts for dehydrogenation of lower alkanes."
          [182] "We focus on propane dehydrogenation because of the need for alternative and/or complementary technology for propene production to supplement existing technologies."
          [183] "We survey non-oxidative and oxidative dehydrogenation approaches, and examine reaction routes that are intermediate between these two main approaches."
          [184] "Although the equilibrium conversion of alkanes increases with temperature, alkene selectivity decreases with increasing temperature and chain length due to an increased tendency toward dehydrocyclization/aromatisation, thermal cracking and coke formation."

          [187] "Despite a large number of reports and many reviews covering different aspects of the subject, and more than two decades of investigations on ODH, gaps still exist between laboratory achievements and industrial implementation."

[1] "Although there are other metallic reforming catalysts such as Ru and Rh, which are less strongly prone to coking than Ni,129 Ni is one of the most common reforming catalysts, which is partly due to its significantly cheaper price. In order to overcome the coking problem of Ni catalysts, numerous theoretical studies have been conducted to understand the coke formation on nickel and to come up with potential strategies to avoid the unwanted coking process."
          [2] "It could be shown that the adsorption of C atoms on the closed packed surface of a NiAu surface alloy is thermodynamically less favoured, by 23 kJ mol1 or more, than the analogous process on a pure Ni(111) surface.134 Based on this finding, it has been proposed to alloy Ni with Au.134 A cheaper alternative is to alloy Ni with Sn which hinders the CC bond formation and enhances the CO bond formation leading to the removal of surface C centers as carbon monoxide.135,136 It has been discussed that the Sn atoms separate the Ni centers on the catalyst surface, which tend to bind C atoms, from each other. With the Ni centers being separated, the C atoms on the surface are separated as well, which hinders the formation of coke.135,136 These theoretical results are consistent with experiments which show that pure Ni catalysts deactivate significantly faster than NiSn alloy based catalysts.135 Since the step sites play an essential role in the growth of the graphene islands, as mentioned above, additives such as potassium,66 sulfur,66 gold66 or boron131 have been proposed.66 Computational calculations have shown that these elements tend to occupy the step sites and thus avoid the formation of graphene islands.66,131 A similar strategy, by blocking the crucial sites, has been proposed to prevent the formation of a carbidic phase. Calculations have shown that boron prefers the same sub-surface sites on Ni as C.137 By occupying these sites with B, the diffusion of C to these sub-surface sites and the formation of the thermodynamically more stable carbide phase can be prevented.128 Apart from blocking the sub-surface sites, sub-surface boron in Ni(111) also has been shown to have an destabilizing effect on on-surface C centers,138 which may help to prevent the accumulation of C atoms on the surface."
          [3] "Although supported Pt catalysts show high activity, the catalyst deactivation due to coke formation remains a challenging issue."
          [4] "The robustness against coking can be increased with additional promoters, such as late transition metals, main-group metals including Sn and Ga, alkali-metal oxides and rare-earth metal oxides."
          [5] "It has been demonstrated for graphene islands on the Ni(111) surface, unsaturated C atoms at the edge of a graphene island are less stable than isolated C atoms on the metal surface."
          [6] "A cheaper alternative is to alloy Ni with Sn which hinders the CC bond formation and enhances the CO bond formation leading to the removal of surface C centers as carbon monoxide."
          [7] "Since the step sites play an essential role in the growth of the graphene islands, as mentioned above, additives such as potassium, sulfur, gold or boron have been proposed."
          [8] "Apart from blocking the sub-surface sites, sub-surface boron in Ni(111) also has been shown to have an destabilizing effect on on-surface C centers, which may help to prevent the accumulation of C atoms on the surface."

[1] "A catalyst design consisting of the double-decoration of nanoparticulate intermetallic PtGa with Pb and Ca was applied to produce an ultra-stable catalyst for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) at a high temperature."
          [2] "PtGaCaPb/SiO2 exhibited outstanding catalytic stability in PDH at 600C, and almost no deactivation was observed for up to 1month."
          [3] "Herein, we report a novel catalyst design concept, namely, the double decoration of PtGa intermetallics by Pb and Ca, which synergize the geometric and electronic promotion effects on the catalyst stability, respectively."
          [4] "Pb is deposited on the three-fold Pt3 sites of the PtGa nanoparticles to block them, whereas Ca, which affords an electron-enriched single-atom-like Pt1 site, is placed around the nanoparticles."
          [5] "Thus, PtGaCaPb/SiO2 exhibits an outstandingly high catalytic stability, even at 600C (kd=0.00033h1, τ=3067h), and almost no deactivation of the catalyst was observed for up to 1month for the first time."

[1] "To expose the loaded Pt on the surface of the carriers, ion exchange and impregnation are two simple and practical methods. The dispersion of Pt mainly depends on the precursors of Pt, the preparation conditions, the properties of the carriers, and the interaction between Pt and the carriers, as well as the additives."
          [2] "The addition of a second metal has been found to be highly effective for the sintering resistance of Pt particles. The introduced metal forms alloys with Pt around Pt particles,63 and the alloys anchor them on the surface of the carriers, making them not easy to migrate and coalesce."
          [3] "The application of the carriers possessing a strong interaction with Pt is another way to retard the sintering. Al2O3 is the most common carrier of Pt catalyst, in which the coordinatively unsaturated pentacoordinate Al3+ can anchor Pt to make it not easy to migrate."
          [4] "Nanocarbon was also reported as the carrier of Pt to improve the sintering resistance, and the strong metalcarrier interaction leads to the electron transfer from nanocarbon to the Pt particles, significantly preventing the sintering of Pt."
          [5] "MgAl2O4 spinel is also a good choice as the carrier. Generally, Pt is not directly loaded on MgAl2O4 spinel prepared beforehand, but firstly loaded into the spaces between the layers of MgAlOx hydrotalcite, and then Pt particles are enclosed in the interspace of MgAl2O4 spinel formed through the collapse of the layered structure of the hydrotalcite after calcination at high temperature."
          [6] "Moliner et al.67 reported effective methods to encapsulate Pt in highly siliceous chabazite, and the catalyst showed enhanced stability towards Pt sintering even at 650750 C in the atmospheres of H2, O2 and H2O."
          [7] "The Al2O3 overcoat has also proved to be efficient in preventing the sintering of Pt nanoparticles through atomic layer deposition."
          [8] "Tanabe et al. revealed that no Pt sintering was observed for Pt/MgO as an automotive exhaust catalyst after calcination in air at 900 C, for the formation of a Mg2PtO4-like compound prevents the migration of Pt."
          [9] "Nagai et al. found that CeO2 had a similar effect of MgO in preventing the sintering of Pt due to the formation of the PtOCe bond in the Pt/CeO2 catalyst."
          [10] "Recently, Pt supported on CeO2 has attracted more attention because of the ability of CeO2 to trap Pt in an atomically dispersed state."
          [11] "The atomically dispersed Pt is most likely to be present in the form of Pt2+ bonded to the ubiquitous step edges of the CeO2 surface."
          [12] "The addition of Ga, In, Zn, Cu, Ir, Co to Pt catalysts exhibits similar effects as Sn."
          [13] "Not only that, but Sattler et al.84 showed that in the highly active, selective and stable PtGaK/Al2O3 (0.1 wt% Pt, 3 wt% Ga, 0.25 wt% K) catalyst for the dehydrogenation of propane, the coordinately unsaturated Ga3+ is responsible for activating the CH bond, and Pt only acts as a promoter."
          [14] "Furthermore, just like the PtSn/CeO2 catalyst,29 the reactivity can be fully recovered via simple coke burning in air, although the sintering of Pt still occurs."
          [15] "Located at the same main group with Ga, In was also reported to be the promoter of supported Pt catalysts. The PtIn/Mg(Al)O catalyst prepared at pH 8 using the co-precipitation method exhibits the best catalytic performance and the strongest interaction between the metal phase and the carrier."
          [16] "B and Si, two nonmetal elements, can play similar roles, too. Dehydrogenation of n-butane over the PtB/SiO2 catalyst showed improved catalytic activity and stability compared with Pt/SiO2."
          [17] "Dadras et al.86 called B a magic bullet against sintering and coking, and they summarized the positive roles of B as follows. The non-stoichiometric PtB cluster is anchored to the carrier via a covalent BO bond, which is much stronger than the interaction between Pt clusters and the carrier surface."
          [18] "Additionally, the dissociation energy of a Pt atom from a PtB cluster is significantly larger than that from the pure Pt cluster, increasing the sintering resistance."
          [19] "Finally, the affinity of PtB cluster to C also drops dramatically, leading to the reduced coke formation and increased selectivity to olefins."
          [20] "It is predicted by a computational screening of main-group elements as potential additives for the Pt catalyst that Si, just as B, can modify the selectivity of the Pt catalyst by changing both electronic and geometric properties."

[1] "In this review, we outline the progress of these dehydrogenation catalysts that have been mainly developed in the past five years. For different classes of the most-promising catalysts in the selective dehydrogenation of ethane-to-ethylene and propane-to-propylene, their syntheses, structural information, catalytic properties and mechanisms are comparatively summarized."

          [12] "The synthesis method allows it to serve as a potent ion-exchanger, resulting in the stabilization of the highly dispersed bimetallic PtZn sites by the ETS-2 support."

[1] "To improve the stability of Pt-based catalysts, many efforts have been dedicated to strengthen metalsupport interactions by using various methods including the nanopore-encaged metal strategy,2124 wet-chemistry approach2529 and modification of supports.10,11,30,31 Among them, modification of supports is a relatively effective and simple method to improve the stability of Pt-based catalysts."
          [2] "For example, Lu et al. reported a PtSn/Al2O3 sheet catalyst for PDH, exhibiting high activity, selectivity and stability.11 It was proposed that the enhanced stability in PDH was associated with γ-Al2O3 nanosheets containing a great deal of pentacoordinate Al3+ ions, which can stabilize PtSn clusters by strong interactions between metals and supports."
          [3] "Recent work by Ma et al. showed that the addition of Ga into Mg(Al)O layer double hydrotalcites could greatly enhance the stability of Pt catalysts in PDH.10 It may be due to the fact that pentacoordinate Ga3+ ions could disperse and stabilize PtSn clusters, thereby enhancing the electronic interactions between Pt and Ga."
          [4] "A similar conclusion regarding the importance of modification of supports has been reported in the case of PtSn/CeO2 catalysts.30"
          [5] "Therefore, this provides a way to tune and enhance the catalytic activity and selectivity for the PDH process, and also introduces unique stability characteristics for bimetallic systems."
          [6] "Herein, highly stable Pt/Sn-Si-beta catalysts for PDH were prepared by an improved post-synthesis strategy, which consists of dealumination of H-beta and subsequent metal impregnation."
          [7] "It is indicated that Sn species existing in tetrahedral coordination states were incorporated into the framework of dealuminated beta (Si-beta)."
          [8] "Meanwhile, Pt species were highly dispersed in the form of ultra-small nanoclusters on Pt/Sn-Si-beta due to the strong interaction between Pt and Sn(IV) sites confined in the Si-beta framework."
          [9] "The prepared Pt/Sn-Si-beta catalysts show excellent catalytic performance for PDH, in which the propene formation rate was 2.3 mol g1Pt h1 with a propene selectivity of >99% at 550 C and the higher propene formation rate was 3.1 mol g1Pt h1 at 600 C."
          [10] "Moreover, the strong PtSn interactions and the confinement effect of Sn in the Si-beta framework inhibit the coke and sintering of Pt clusters, thereby achieving good stability of dehydrogenation and regeneration with almost unchanged catalytic activity during four cycles at 550 C."



[1] "Although the direct dehydrogenation technique has been industrialized, the fabrication of the corresponding catalysts is still confronted with a series of plights."
          [2] "Decades have witnessed the efforts made and strategies proposed by devoted researchers to optimize the catalyst performance and improve the catalytic stability from a wide panorama."
          [3] "In this section, strategies focused on catalytic stability enhancement in recently reported works are summarized."
          [4] "Effectively regulating the active compounds in both Pt-based catalysts and metal oxide-based catalysts can be achieved by soundly introducing promoters."
          [5] "Promoters can greatly impact the catalytic behaviors in PDH catalysts, showing advantages in suppression of side reactions, inhibition of coke deposition, stabilizing active compounds and so on."
          [6] "Metallic Pt has already been recognized as an effective catalyst for alkane dehydrogenation reactions due to its high affinity for paraffinic CH bonds."
          [7] "Currently, adding metal promoters to form alloys or intermetallic compounds is one of the most effective methods to ameliorate central active components and inhibit catalytic deactivation in Pt-based catalytic systems."
          [8] "Sn is a widely utilized promoter for Pt catalysts."
          [9] "The PtGa catalyst system has also been implemented in production plants (FCDh technique)."
          [10] "In has also been developed as a promising promoter of Pt-based catalysts."
          [11] "Zn is another analogous but economical promoter for Pt-based catalysts."
          [12] "Many other metals, including Fe, Cu, and Co, can also be promoters for Pt-based catalysts to adjust the electronic properties and improve the dispersion of Pt atoms for further stability enhancement."
          [13] "Alloying of Pt with rare-earth elements (REEs) has barely been accomplished through the conventional H2 reduction route due to the low chemical potential of REE oxides."
          [14] "Supported metal oxide-based catalysts, including CoOx-, ZnOx-, VOx-, and CrOx-based catalysts, are other important PDH catalysts and have been extensively studied for decades."
          [15] "Introducing another metal oxide to form an oxide compound is an effective approach to improve the dispersion of active species and enhance the catalytic stability under the applied conditions, showing advantages in modifying the coordination and electronic state of host metal oxide sites."
          [16] "The introduction of an appropriate metal oxide or noble metal into a catalytic system can greatly enhance the catalytic performance."



[1] "Extensive research efforts have been made to inhibit deactivation and improve propene selectivity of Pt-based catalysts by doping promoters of Sn [9,10], In [11,12], Ga [13,14] and Cu [15] to form bimetallic catalysts."
          [2] "For example, PtIn [16] and PtGa [17,18] bimetallic nanoparticles (NPs) supported on calcined hydrotalcites (HT) show higher activity and selectivity in PDH, which has been attributed to the increased Pt dispersion and electron transfer from In or Ga to Pt [11,18]."
          [3] "Besides promoters, another method is to modify Al2O3 support with ZnO [19], La2O3 [20] or TiO2 [21] or replace Al2O3 support with ZnAl2O4 [22], ZSM-5 [23] or Mg(Al)O oxide [8,24]."
          [4] "Additionally, it has been verified that the single Pt atom sites on Pt-Sn/γ-Al2O3 with a sandwich structure are more favorable for PDH reaction than Pt ensembles [25,26]."
          [5] "Gong et al. [15] also reported that the PtCu single atom alloys can enhance the propane conversion and propene selectivity simultaneously in PDH."
          [6] "Whether as promoters or supports, an important aim of using them is to obtain highly and stably dispersed Pt-based catalysts so that improving PDH performance."
          [7] "However, it is still difficult to break through these challenges for PDH reactions [27], and the exact Pt-M-support relationship is still unclear."
          [8] "Therefore, it is extremely necessary to find more efficient methods to solve the problems mentioned above."
          [9] "In fact, the hierarchical morphology and porous structure play important roles in many heterogeneous catalytic reactions. However, the effect of hierarchical microstructure is seldom reported."
          [10] "Given that the small Pt NPs and hierarchical microstructure may provide more stable and easily accessible active sites for PDH reaction, a promising design for obtaining the desired size of active Pt and hierarchical pore morphology was proposed."
          [11] "The promoted effects of HT reconstruction on the microstructure and morphology of the 3D oxide nanosheet array catalyst, and the subsequently superior PDH performance, were profoundly discussed."

Stable and selective catalysts for propane dehydrogenation operating at thermodynamic limit Hitting the limits on propene synthesis The greater abundance of propane from shale gas has spurred efforts to use it as a propylene feedstock. Direct dehydrogenation catalysts consisting of platinumtin alloy nanoparticles supported on alumina often must run with hydrogen dilution to avoid carbon buildup and excess tin to avoid alloy segregation.
          We report that silica-supported platinum-tin (Pt1Sn1) nanoparticles (&lt;2 nanometers in diameter) can operate as a PDH catalyst at thermodynamically limited conversion levels, with excellent stability and selectivity to propylene (&gt;99%). Atomic mixing of Pt and Sn in the precursor is preserved upon reduction and during catalytic operation. The benign interaction of these nanoparticles with the silicon dioxide support does not lead to Pt-Sn segregation and formation of a tin oxide phase that can occur over traditional catalyst supports.
          To alleviate this issue, large quantities of Sn are used in the catalyst preparation (the nominal atomic loading is Sn:Pt between 4 and 5), which increases the yield of intermetallic PtSn NPs (12). In addition, studies have shown that adding hydrogen to the reactant feed reduces the rate of catalyst deactivation (13). Although this strategy is implemented commercially (10), addition of hydrogen in the feed lowers the thermodynamic limit on per-pass propane conversion (fig. S1) and decreases productivity (7).
          We developed a PDH catalyst that operates at thermodynamically limited conversion levels without the addition of hydrogen to the feed and exhibits excellent stability and selectivity to propylene (&gt;99%). The catalyst is composed of silica-supported Pt1Sn1 NPs, synthesized and pretreated to ensure that the mixing of Pt and Sn is preserved during catalytic operation.
          The principle behind catalyst synthesis is to begin with a heterometallic Pt-Sn coordination complex in which Pt and Sn are in immediate contact, and this interaction is retained during the reduction and PDH reaction.
          The data in Fig. 1, A to C, were obtained with 16 vol % propane in helium. Propane streams are diluted in commercial operations to increase the limiting equilibrium conversion, which is higher at lower propane partial pressure (fig. S2), and to limit catalyst deactivation rates (7, 16, 17). This approach requires additional downstream separation units and limits process efficiency.
          The data in Fig. 1, A to C, show the performance of the Pt1Sn1/SiO2 catalyst (1 wt % Pt and 0.6 wt % Sn) for propane dehydrogenation at 580C, 16 vol % propane (with the remainder helium) and at a weight hourly space velocity (WHSV) of 4.7 hours1. Under these reaction conditions, the thermodynamic limit on propane conversion is 66.5% (fig. S2). The Pt1Sn1/SiO2 catalyst showed near-thermodynamic conversion of &gt;66% (Fig. 1A, red circles) and &gt;99% selectivity to propylene (Fig. 1B, red circles).
          The data in Fig. 1D show that, under these conditions, the propane conversion goes from 41 to 39% in 120 min. Under identical conditions, the other tested catalysts deactivate very rapidly to very low conversion, as illustrated for the commercial mimic. A transmission electron microscopy (TEM) image of the spent catalyst, after 120 min of PDH reaction, is shown in fig. S6. The image shows that the Pt-Sn NPs are well dispersed, with an average particle diameter of 1.6  0.67 nm, which is consistent with the particle size in fresh samples.
          We attempted to regenerate the Pt1Sn1/SiO2 catalyst by oxidation, using 1% O2 as a mild oxidant at 500C followed by reduction at 600C (see supplementary materials for details of the regeneration procedure). The regeneration studies showed that Pt1Sn1/SiO2 catalysts can be partially regenerated. For example, we measured 97% of the initial activity and &gt;99% of the initial selectivity after three PDH/regeneration cycles (fig. S5).
          Data in Fig. 3A show that the process of mixing chloroplatinic acid (H2PtCl6) and tin(II) chloride (SnCl2) in 0.1 M hydrochloric acid solution formed a heterometallic Pt-Sn coordination complex.
          A bright-field TEM image of Pt-Sn NPs formed on SiO2 upon the reduction of the Pt-Sn complex shows high metal dispersion on the support, with an average NP size of 1.3  0.6 nm (Fig. 3B). The NP size distribution (Fig. 3C) shows that most NPs were &lt;2 nm. The XRD spectra in Fig. 3D show that the formed NPs were essentially alloys of Pt and Sn. This finding is supported by the presence of the XRD peaks corresponding to Pt1Sn1 (41.8 and 44.1) and Pt3Sn1 (39.0 and 45.3) stoichiometries.
          The real-space Pt LIII EXAFS spectra for the Pt1Sn1/SiO2 catalyst (Fig. 4D) are substantially different from the spectra of monometallic Pt and indicate the mixing of Pt and Sn atoms. The best-fit spectrum for the Pt1Sn1/SiO2 catalyst is characterized by the presence of the Pt-Pt and Pt-Sn scattering paths, consistent with the formation of PtSn intermetallic phases.









[1] "Pt-Sn clusters anchored at Al3+penta sites as a sinter-resistant and regenerable catalyst for propane dehydrogenation"
          [2] "Herein, a series of highly ordered mesoporous Al2O3 supports with different levels of Al3+penta sites, are fabricated and used as the support to disperse Pt-Sn2 clusters."
          [3] "The stability and regenerability of Pt-Sn2/meso-Al2O3 are strongly dependent on the content of Al3+penta sites in the Al2O3 structure, and a high level of Al3+penta sites can effectively prevent the agglomeration of Pt-Sn2 clusters into large Pt nanoparticles in the consecutive dehydrogenation-regeneration cycles."



[1] "Rare-earthplatinum alloy nanoparticles in mesoporous zeolite for catalysis Platinum is a much used catalyst that, in petrochemical processes, is often alloyed with other metals to improve catalytic activity, selectivity and longevity1,2,3,4,5."
          [2] "Such catalysts are usually prepared in the form of metallic nanoparticles supported on porous solids, and their production involves reducing metal precursor compounds under a H2 flow at high temperatures6."
          [3] "The method works well when using easily reducible late transition metals, but Pt alloy formation with rare-earth elements through the H2 reduction route is almost impossible owing to the low chemical potential of rare-earth element oxides6."
          [4] "Here we use as support a mesoporous zeolite that has pore walls with surface framework defects (called silanol nests) and show that the zeolite enables alloy formation between Pt and rare-earth elements."
          [5] "We find that the silanol nests enable the rare-earth elements to exist as single atomic species with a substantially higher chemical potential compared with that of the bulk oxide, making it possible for them to diffuse onto Pt."
          [6] "High-resolution transmission electron microscopy and hydrogen chemisorption measurements indicate that the resultant bimetallic nanoparticles supported on the mesoporous zeolite are intermetallic compounds, which we find to be stable, highly active and selective catalysts for the propane dehydrogenation reaction."
          [7] "When used with late transition metals, the same preparation strategy produces Pt alloy catalysts that incorporate an unusually large amount of the second metal and, in the case of the PtCo alloy, show high catalytic activity and selectivity in the preferential oxidation of carbon monoxide in H2."
          [8] "The industrial PDH process has been using PtSn bimetallic catalysts supported on porous alumina for nearly three decades, since its discovery in the early 1990s3,7."
          [9] "The Pt metal alone exhibits high initial catalytic activity, but rapidly deactivates as a result of coke deposition on the Pt surface."
          [10] "The coke deposition also causes an undesirable loss of the catalytic selectivity to propylene."
          [11] "To alleviate these problems, Sn is introduced to form an alloy with Pt nanoparticles and thereby dilute the Pt surface with inactive Sn atoms and break up coke-generating Pt ensembles."
          [12] "Our search for a highly active and more durable PDH catalyst has focused on using a siliceous MFI zeolite with a hierarchical micro-/mesoporous structure as a replacement for the alumina support."
          [13] "This zeolite, synthesized using a multi-ammonium surfactant as a structure-directing agent, has attracted attention as an advanced catalyst support8,9,10,11,12,13 owing to its unique structure, which comprises ultrathin zeolite frameworks and three-dimensionally interconnected mesopores that boost the catalytic performance of supported metals by providing both facile reactant and product diffusion and high metal nanoparticle dispersion within the mesopores12,13."
          [14] "The formation of the Pt3La and Pt3Y nanoparticles on the degallated zeolite brought a striking enhancement in all aspects of the PDH catalytic performance, including activity, selectivity and durability, as shown in Fig. 2."
          [15] "The catalytic reaction was performed at 580C using a pure propane flow at a large space velocity (see Methods), and these harsh operating conditions caused even the conventional PtSn/alumina catalyst to experience severe coke formation and catalyst deactivation within 1 d."
          [16] "In sharp contrast, the Pt3La intermetallic nanoparticles supported on the degallated zeolite (denoted as PtLa/mz-deGa, where mz stands for mesoporous zeolite) showed a high initial propane conversion of 40% (close to the equilibrium conversion) and underwent extremely slow deactivation, retaining 8% conversion even after 30 days of reaction."
          [17] "The PtREE incorporation in the mesoporous zeolite was conducted by co-impregnation of aqueous solutions of Pt(NH3)4(NO3)2 and either La(NO3)3·6H2O or Y(NO3)3·6H2O, followed by heating under an O2 flow at 350C and subsequently under H2 at 700C (see Methods)."
          [18] "The formation of the Pt3La and Pt3Y nanoparticles on the degallated zeolite brought a striking enhancement in all aspects of the PDH catalytic performance, including activity, selectivity and durability, as shown in Fig. 2."

[1] "Although the equilibrium conversion of alkanes increases with temperature, alkene selectivity decreases with increasing temperature and chain length due to an increased tendency toward dehydrocyclization/aromatisation, thermal cracking and coke formation."
          [2] "Direct dehydrogenation of lower alkanes is an energy intensive reaction; however, oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) has the potential to lower the energy requirement for achieving dehydrogenation."
          [3] "ODH can be considered as tandem endothermic (dehydrogenation, CnH2n + 2  CnH2n + H2) and exothermic (oxidation, H2 + O2  H2O) processes, with an overall thermodynamic summation, CnH2n + 2 + O2  CnH2n + H2O."
          [4] "Although the process is not thermo-neutral, part of the energy required for the endothermic reaction is augmented by the exothermic reaction."
          [5] "Thus, ODH of alkanes takes place at lower temperature compared to the corresponding non-ODH."
          [6] "This lower temperature requirement of ODH compared to non-ODH and cracking is encouraging and provides motivation for continued efforts to develop ODH into an industrial technology."
          [7] "Although ODH is attractive because of the energy intensification advantage, commercial ODH technologies hinge on innovative catalyst and process design, i.e. proper synergy of the endothermic dehydrogenation step with the exothermic hydrogen combustion and design of selective CH and hydrogen combustion catalysts."

          [12] "Catalyst improvement endeavors can benefit from insights on alkane CH bond activation mechanisms."
          [13] "Developing direct routes to obtain key organic chemicals from lower alkanes would benefit industry."
          [14] "Lower alkanes are relatively inert, and they exhibit little or no reactivity at conditions typical for activating functional group reactions in organic compounds because they lack low-lying vacant orbitals or lone pair electrons."
          [15] "Alkanes are made up non-polar CC and CH bonds. These bonds consist of strongly localised electron pairs that are usually induced to reactivity under severe conditions (e.g., at high temperature or pressure, or with the use of aggressive reagents)."
          [16] "The first and rate-limiting step of alkane dehydrogenation using platinum or chromium oxide-based catalysts involves CH activation."
          [17] "Although a number of efforts have been made to gain insight on the mechanism of the reaction, questions still remain, especially regarding the pathway of the CH activation."
          [18] "It is of fundamental and applied interest to know whether the first CH bond cleavage is homolytic or heterolytic."
          [19] "If it is a heterolytic pathway, it will further be of interest to know whether the first hydrogen from the alkane substrate is abstracted as a proton or as a hydride ion."
          [20] "This knowledge will benefit catalyst improvement efforts."
          [21] "The simple impregnation techniques for preparing supported (especially alumina) metal and oxide catalysts becloud their structural heterogeneity."

          [25] "Although several solid acid catalysts are used in alkane conversions, zeolites have the advantage of possessing a well-defined structure, allowing the structure-activity relationship to be easily deduced."
          [26] "Therefore, it is instructive to examine non-oxidative dehydrogenation of light alkanes over zeolite catalysts."
          [27] "A detailed knowledge of the adsorption mechanism of lower alkane molecules on zeolite is of interest in this context, especially for informed tuning of zeolite properties to allow efficient and selective dehydrogenation of alkanes."
          [28] "Light alkanes are adsorbed on zeolites via dispersive interaction."
          [29] "Protons and the exchanged metals ions are typically the active sites in zeolites, while the zeolite framework plays the role of anchor for the active sites and/or dispersion medium for the reactants."
          [30] "The framework of microporous zeolites exerts dispersive forces on the reactant's molecules that depend on the shape, channel and cavity of the framework."
          [31] "In addition, the nature and the density of the active sites influence the framework dispersion forces."
          [32] "Recent reports have shown that the strong electrostatic field between protons or exchanged metal ions and basic oxygen species can enhance and/or induce polarization of bonds in hydrocarbon adsorbates."
          [33] "This agrees with Hashiguchi et al., who found enhanced activation of the CH bond on a homogeneous catalyst."
          [34] "Wender et al. showed that 3040% of heat adsorption in n-alkanes on Na-zeolite is due to polarization of the adsorbates."
          [35] "Subbotina et al. also demonstrated that the CH bond of ethane is more strongly polarized on Mg2 + and Ca2 + forms of Y zeolite than on Na+ forms."
          [36] "Mg2 +-Y zeolite molecules exhibit weaker adsorption and polarization of ethane than Ca2 +-zeolites."
          [37] "Based on charge density considerations, Mg2 + cations are expected to exhibit a stronger polarizing effect than Ca2 + cations."
          [38] "Subbotina et al. explain that because of the smaller ionic radius of Mg2 +, it is more strongly shielded by the surrounding oxygen atoms of the zeolite lattice than a Ca2 + ion, thereby reducing the polarizing effect of Mg2 + on the hydrocarbon adsorbate."
          [39] "Sievers et al. also report that the La3 + form of X zeolite induces strong polarization of adsorbed alkane molecules; partial positive charges were induced on secondary and tertiary carbon atoms of alkane molecules."
          [40] "The authors suggest that the polarization may be viewed as an intermediate condition to hydride abstraction (which is an important elementary step in CH activation)."
          [41] "They add that CH bond polarization was enhanced by physisorbed water molecules that coordinate with La3 + cations."
          [42] "The enhanced polarization of CH bonds by the presence of water molecules on La3 +X zeolite may have a beneficial effect in oxidative dehydrogenation where water is a by-product."
          [43] "Alkane polarization studies on Na+, Mg2 +, Ca2 +, and La3 + exchanged X-zeolites indicate that the polarizing effect increases with increasing charge magnitude and ionic radius."
          [44] "Note that these alkane polarizing cations occupy the same position on the zeolites as the well-known CH activation cations/metals, and thus the CH polarizing effect has a complementary effect on CH activation."
          [45] "This may add to the number of relevant variables and increase the challenge of optimizing the ratio of activation/polarizing cations among exchangeable sites (Si/Al ratio), as well as the sequence for incorporating the cations or metals during catalyst preparation."
          [46] "Further, it is important to note that the choice of cations should be such that they exhibit no catalytic (oligomerization, isomerization, aromatisation or oxidation) effects on the target alkene products at the reaction condition."
          [47] "Furthermore, it may be beneficial to create a CH polarization effect on the zeolite framework."
          [48] "This can be achieved by appropriate chance of framework atoms."
          [49] "Since active sites are usually created on the zeolite frameworks."
          [50] "The activation of CH bonds of light alkanes occurs readily on super electrophiles (super Brnsted and super Lewis acid) at low temperatures."
          [51] "Although CH activation on zeolites have been observed at low temperatures, industrial alkane reactions on zeolites are usually carried out at high temperatures."
          [52] "Several experimental and theoretical studies on the molecular dynamics of light alkanes on zeolite have been published."
          [53] "However, despite the decades of intensive investigations on the subject, the actual mechanism of CH activation on acid zeolite is still debated."
          [54] "Two CH activation paths are generally recognized: the unimolecular/protolytic mechanism and the bimolecular/carbenium chain mechanism."
          [55] "The unimolecular mechanism involves direct protonation of an alkane-forming carbonium ion intermediate."
          [56] "The proton can be inserted into either a CC or CH bond of the alkane."
          [57] "Proton insertion through the CC bond leads to cracking of the alkane, with the acid site regenerated."
          [58] "Insertion through the HC bond yields H2 and a carbenium ion/alkoxide intermediate."
          [59] "Desorption of alkene from the intermediate regenerates the acid, or the alkoxide can enter the bimolecular conversion path."
          [60] "In the bimolecular mechanism of CH activation, the alkoxide intermediate constitutes the active sites and CH activation occurs through hydride transfer from a second alkane molecule forming another alkoxide."
          [61] "This may be followed by βscission to regenerate the active site and complete the catalytic cycle."
          [62] "For example, activation of propane on acid zeolite based on the two mechanisms is illustrated in Scheme 1."
          [63] "Low reactant partial pressure and high temperature favor unimolecular dehydrogenation of alkane on acid zeolite."
          [64] "These conditions favor the endothermic desorption step (rate limiting step) leading to propene."
          [65] "In contrast, high partial pressure and low temperature favor the bimolecular mechanism leading to a low propene yield."
          [66] "The two molecular mechanisms devoid of side reactions give fairly predictable product distribution."
          [67] "However, the products of each route are prone to side reactions (dimerization, oligomerization, isomerization & aromatisation) in the presence of Bronsted acid sites."
          [68] "Hence propene selectivity on acidic zeolite is very low and products rich in aromatics are usually obtained."
          [69] "The active sites (alkoxide intermediate) of the bimolecular pathway are formed in situ."
          [70] "The alkoxide intermediate is made up of an alkyl carbenium ion ionically held to the zeolite framework oxygen ion."
          [71] "The active sites of the unimolecular pathway are the charge balancing protons of the zeolite framework."
          [72] "A proton and a carbenium ion are an electrophilic or Lewis acid species (a proton can also be considered as a special case of Lewis acidity)."
          [73] "The two pathways essentially involve electrophilic CH activation."
          [74] "The electrophiles (proton and carbenium ion) activate CH at high temperatures (500 C), giving low conversion rates of light alkanes and poor selectivity to corresponding alkenes."
          [75] "Iglesia and co-workers used isotopic labeling studies to demonstrate that CH activation is not the rate-limiting step in the dehydrogenation of propane on H-ZSM-5 and Ga/H-ZSM-5."
          [76] "They proposed that the CH bond cleavage produces an H-adatom and an alkoxide intermediate."
          [77] "Desorption of an alkene from the alkoxide regenerates the proton sites on the zeolites."
          [78] "An alkoxide intermediate may also discharge as a hydrogen rich species through cracking."
          [79] "Iglesia et al. proposed that desorption or disposal of the H-adatom from the CH bond cleavage is the rate-limiting step."
          [80] "A similar deduction was reached by Yu et al."
          [81] "who found that desorption of the alkoxides intermediate is the rate-limiting step under conditions that favor the unimolecular mechanism."
          [82] "The above proposition has been demonstrated on metal (e.g., Ga, Zn, and Co) exchanged zeolites."
          [83] "The specific role of the exchanged metals has been the subject of several reports with special attention on Ga and Zn."
          [84] "Although the framework Ga2O3 on H-MFI seems to have a CH polarization effect on desorbed methane, Ga2O3 exhibits lower CH activation activity."
          [85] "The physical mixture of Ga2O3/HMFI displays higher propane aromatisation activity than pure H-MFI."
          [86] "Similar synergistic effects have been reported for Zn/H-MFI and Co/H-MFI."
          [87] "Exchanged cations behave as monomeric species at the exchange sites of zeolite."
          [88] "Iglesia and Biscardi hypothesized that the monomeric species enhance propane conversion by promoting re-combinative desorption (RD) of the H-adatom formed from the CH cleavage."
          [89] "It is worthwhile noting that the exchange cations (electrophilic species) constitute the CH activation sites."
          [90] "Hence, more insights are required about their additional role in promoting RD."
          [91] "However, the authors did not provide further information on the nature of the H-adatoms and the mechanism of RD."
          [92] "In the next section, we examine the mechanism of desorption of H-adatoms over Ga and Zn exchanged H-ZSM-5."
          [93] "The exchanged metal ions in zeolites are held ionically by one or more basic oxygen atoms."
          [94] "Different species have been suggested, depending on the density of the cation exchange site of the zeolite and method of introduction of the metals."
          [95] "According to Kanansky et al."
          [96] "the exchanged Zn and Ga species on H-ZSM-5 and their mechanism of CH activation are distinctively different."
          [97] "Zn and Ga are introduced on H-ZSM-5 through a vapor deposition technique using Zn metal vapor and Ga(CH3)3 as the source of Zn and Ga, respectively."
          [98] "The metal introduction technique allows quantitative exchange of the zeolite protons which leads to Zn/Al = 0.5 and Ga/Al = 1, respectively."
          [99] "Zn2 + is generated directly, but Ga+ is produced by H2 treatment at 500 C to release the methyl groups."
          [100] "The proposed active sites are OZn2+O and OGa+, respectively."
          [101] "The mechanism of CH activation with ethane by the two sites under the same reaction conditions are summarized in Scheme 2."
          [102] "The proposed mechanism is in agreement with the mechanism suggested from calculations using the GAUSSIAN 94 program for ethane activation on Zn-exchanged zeolite by Frash and van Santen."
          [103] "In another theoretical study using a DFT cluster modeling approach, Pidko and van Santen compared the activation energy of CH with three types of Zn species at active sites: OZn2+O, OZn+OZn+O and HOZn+ O."
          [104] "The authors suggest that the reaction proceeds most easily on OZn2+O, and hypothesize that the enhanced Lewis activity of OZn2+O facilitates CH heterolytic cleavage."
          [105] "They further argue that the first proton abstraction occurs preferentially on the oxygen sites neighboring the ring where the cation is located."
          [106] "They proposed a one-step reaction to yield H2 and C2H4 from the decomposition of the Zn-alkyl and proton."
          [107] "A proposed mechanism of CH activation on OGa+ has similarly been suggested using theoretical calculations."
          [108] "High alkene selectivities are obtained on the H-ZSM-5 when exchangeable protons are rigorously replaced by Zn and Ga."
          [109] "The Zn-exchanged H-ZSM-5 had higher ethane conversion rates but lower ethene selectivity than its Ga counterpart."
          [110] "The CH activation on the OZn2+O site can be described by a Lewis base-assisted deprotonation mechanism."
          [111] "This is accompanied by conversion of the Lewis base site to a conjugate Bronsted acid site."
          [112] "The OGa+ site, however, activates the CH bond via oxidative addition without a protonic site intermediate."
          [113] "A protonic site intermediate increases tendency of side reactions on the Zn-exchanged H-ZSM-5 relative to the Ga counterpart."
          [114] "The elementary steps of CH activation on OGa+ (Scheme 2) reveal that a redox cycle at the metal center is required for catalytic CH activation via the oxidative addition mechanism."
          [115] "A redox cycle is not apparent in the elementary step presented for CH activation on OZn2+O."
          [116] "Hence, a redox cycle is not a requisite for CH activation via the Lewis base-assisted deprotonation mechanism."
          [117] "However, under alkane dehydrogenation reaction conditions, the OZn2+O sites can undergo a reversible Zn2 +/Zn redox process."
          [118] "This redox process increases the availability of undesired protonic site intermediates."
          [119] "Zn-exchanged H-ZSM-5 prepared by conventional ion-exchange methods contain a significant percentage of unexchanged proton sites leading to lower alkene selectivity of the catalyst."
          [120] "Iglesia and Biscardi titrate the proton sites with NaOH."
          [121] "The un-titrated and the titrated catalysts are denoted as Zn/H-ZSMS-5 and Zn/Na-ZSMS-5, respectively."
          [122] "Zn/Na-ZSM-5 has four times the propane conversion rate and a higher propene selectivity than Zn/H-ZSMS-5."
          [123] "The propene formation rate obtained with Zn/Na-ZSM-5 was ten times that of Zn/H-ZSMS-5."
          [124] "The zinc species at the cation exchange site of the zeolite was identified as OZn+OH."
          [125] "The higher propene selectivity obtained on Zn/Na-ZSM-5 compared to Zn/H-ZSMS-5 is presumably from the lower density and availability of proton sites on Zn/Na-ZSM-5."
          [126] "The improved propane conversion rate of Zn/Na-ZSM-5 compared to Zn/H-ZSM-5 is attributable to the higher efficiency of OZn+OH sites in catalyzing desorption of H-adatoms than OZn2+O sites."
          [127] "Another strategy to enhance alkene selectivity is by controlling the strength of the proton sites."
          [128] "The acidity of the sites depends on the nature of the trivalent cation of the zeolite framework."
          [129] "Proton sites in borosilicate zeolites are weaker than those of aluminosilicate, and thus higher alkene selectivity is expected for alkane dehydrogenation over Zn/H[B]-ZSM-5 compared to Zn/H[Al]-ZSM-5."
          [130] "However, Zn/H[B]-ZSM-5 shows no activity for propane dehydrogenation."
          [131] "The desired weaker acidity of the proton sites of Zn/H[B]-ZSM-5 requires weaker basicity of the oxygen atoms in the zeolite framework."
          [132] "This reduced basicity of the oxygen atoms is not sufficiently polarizing to complement the exchanged Zn2 + in CH bond cleavage."
          [133] "In the next section, we examine use of zeolite support to design a Pt-based alkane dehydrogenation catalyst."
          [134] "Elimination of the proton sites of zeolites is critical for obtaining a high alkene selectivity and stability in dehydrogenation catalysts."
          [135] "Pt is the most versatile noble metal catalyst for alkane reactions."
          [136] "Although Pt is expensive, the choice of Pt is often justified by its higher activity, stability and selectivity for these reactions compared to less expensive alternative transition metals."
          [137] "However, rapid catalyst deactivation due to coke formation remains a challenge even when using a Pt-based catalyst for dehydrogenation of light alkanes."
          [138] "Waku et al."
          [139] "exploited the unique property of zeolite as a support for achieving high metal dispersion through cation exchange sites to create a Pt/Na[Fe]-ZSM-5 catalyst with outstanding stability for dehydrogenation of light alkanes."
          [140] "They found that the catalyst deactivation rate of Pt/Na[Fe]-ZSM-5 was lower than for any other Pt-based catalysts in refractory oxide support."
          [141] "The unprecedented performance of Pt/Na[Fe]-ZSM-5 was attributed to its high Pt dispersion (cluster size < 1 mm) on zeolite through ion-exchange."
          [142] "There is a tendency to generate some Brnsted protons on the zeolite during the exchange process, but the choice of Fe3 + as an isomorphous cation in place of Al3 + led to weaker Brnsted sites in [Fe]-ZSM compared to [Al]-ZSM."
          [143] "The weaker acidity minimizes the tendency of side reactions (cracking of oligomerization, aromatisation, and coke), which translates into higher alkene selectivity and catalyst stability."
          [144] "In another report, Xuebing and Iglesia demonstrated the ability of Pt/Na[Fe]-ZSM-5 to dehydrogenate alkanes longer than C4; n-pentane and n-heptane were selectively converted to n-pentene and n-heptene, respectively."
          [145] "Alkene selectivity was also improved when the residual proton generated during Pt exchange or Na-[Fe]-ZSM was titrated with Cs."
          [146] "Although Pt with conventional refractory oxides (Al2O3, SiO2, ZrO2, etc.) used for dehydrogenation of alkanes has similar conversion rates to Pt/Na[Fe]-ZSM-5, deactivation rates are also rapid due to coke formation."
          [147] "The presence of acid (Bronsted and Lewis) sites on the supports promotes readsorption, oligomerization and aromatisation of alkenes."
          [148] "Promotion of Pt with metals, such as Sn, Ga, Zn, Re, etc., improves catalyst stability, but also leads to faster deactivation rates than Pt/Na[Fe]-ZSM-5."
          [149] "However, recent reports by Bell et al."
          [150] "show that the use of calcined hydrotalcite (Al/Mg  0.1) supported on bimetallic PtGa or PtSn gave very high alkene selectivity and stability, comparable to Pt/Na[Fe]-ZSM-5."
          [151] "At this stage, we can conclude that differences in the performance of Zn and Ga exchanged H-ZSM-5 obtained by Kanansky et al."
          [152] "are attributable to their respective CH activation mechanisms."
          [153] "In addition, the role of exchanged Zn and Ga as promoters of RD becomes evident from the mechanisms (Scheme 2)."
          [154] "The RD mechanism on Ga exchanged H-ZSM-5 is by reductive elimination of a hydrogen molecule from O[Ga(H)2]+ intermediate."
          [155] "Decomposition of ZnR and a protonic site, or neutralization of the proton sites by ZnH, leads to desorption of the hydrogen molecule on the Zn-exchanged H-ZSM-5."
          [156] "By extrapolation, the mechanisms of CH activation on exchanged Zn and Ga H-ZSM-5 can described the mechanism of alkane dehydrogenation on Cr-based and Pt-based catalysts respectively."
          [157] "The electronic promotion effect of Sn is in line with the oxidative addition CH activation mechanism."
          [158] "However, the Lewis base-assisted deprotonation mechanism could also explain the proposed CH activation on Cr-based catalysts."
          [159] "Now, the nature and the role of surface oxygen species become more evident."
          [160] "The role of potassium in commercial Cr and Pt-based dehydrogenation catalysts is to minimize the undesired influence of protonic sites on alkene selectivity."
          [161] "The highlights in this section are presented in Table 2."
          [162] "The table reveals the insights achieved on the reaction mechanism, alkene selectivity and catalyst stability for non-oxidative dehydrogenation of lower alkanes."
          [163] "Nonetheless, the level of catalyst activity is still far from acceptable, even at high temperature."
          [164] "A recent report by Rothenberg et al."
          [165] "provides a lead in this respect."
          [166] "Their report indicates that a porous copperaluminum framework material (stabilized by metal oxide) has better performance (activity/selectivity/stability) for propane dehydrogenation than a PtSn/Al2O3."
          [167] "Of particular interest, is the suggestion that achieving propane dehydrogenation at 350 C may be possible."
          [168] "Few details are known about the structure of the porous copperaluminum framework material."
          [169] "However, copper is implicated as providing the active sites for the catalysis."
          [170] "Also, that the material activated in oxygen gave higher propane conversion rates than those activated in inert gas atmosphere underscores the role of the surface oxide (oxygen species) in the catalysis."
          [171] "Thus, the Lewis base-assisted deprotonation mechanism may be invoked here, and the redox property of the metal center is likely to play a role in achieving propane dehydrogenation at 350 C."
          [172] "This should constitute the future research direction for non-oxidative dehydrogenation of lower alkanes."
          [173] "Although the equilibrium conversion of alkanes increases with temperature, alkene selectivity decreases with increasing temperature and chain length due to an increased tendency toward dehydrocyclization/aromatisation, thermal cracking and coke formation."
          [174] "Direct dehydrogenation of lower alkanes is an energy intensive reaction; however, oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) has the potential to lower the energy requirement for achieving dehydrogenation."
          [175] "ODH can be considered as tandem endothermic (dehydrogenation, CnH2n + 2  CnH2n + H2) and exothermic (oxidation, H2 + O2  H2O) processes, with an overall thermodynamic summation, CnH2n + 2 + O2  CnH2n + H2O."
          [176] "Although the process is not thermo-neutral, part of the energy required for the endothermic reaction is augmented by the exothermic reaction."
          [177] "Thus, ODH of alkanes takes place at lower temperature compared to the corresponding non-ODH."
          [178] "This lower temperature requirement of ODH compared to non-ODH and cracking is encouraging and provides motivation for continued efforts to develop ODH into an industrial technology."
          [179] "Although ODH is attractive because of the energy intensification advantage, commercial ODH technologies hinge on innovative catalyst and process design, i.e. proper synergy of the endothermic dehydrogenation step with the exothermic hydrogen combustion and design of selective CH and hydrogen combustion catalysts."
          [180] "In this report, we provide an overview on CH activation and reaction routes to alkane dehydrogenation."
          [181] "We seek to gain insights about components of the active sites of CH activation to provide a platform for rational design of new efficient catalysts for dehydrogenation of lower alkanes."
          [182] "We focus on propane dehydrogenation because of the need for alternative and/or complementary technology for propene production to supplement existing technologies."
          [183] "We survey non-oxidative and oxidative dehydrogenation approaches, and examine reaction routes that are intermediate between these two main approaches."
          [184] "Although the equilibrium conversion of alkanes increases with temperature, alkene selectivity decreases with increasing temperature and chain length due to an increased tendency toward dehydrocyclization/aromatisation, thermal cracking and coke formation."

          [187] "Despite a large number of reports and many reviews covering different aspects of the subject, and more than two decades of investigations on ODH, gaps still exist between laboratory achievements and industrial implementation."

[1] "Although there are other metallic reforming catalysts such as Ru and Rh, which are less strongly prone to coking than Ni,129 Ni is one of the most common reforming catalysts, which is partly due to its significantly cheaper price. In order to overcome the coking problem of Ni catalysts, numerous theoretical studies have been conducted to understand the coke formation on nickel and to come up with potential strategies to avoid the unwanted coking process."
          [2] "It could be shown that the adsorption of C atoms on the closed packed surface of a NiAu surface alloy is thermodynamically less favoured, by 23 kJ mol1 or more, than the analogous process on a pure Ni(111) surface.134 Based on this finding, it has been proposed to alloy Ni with Au.134 A cheaper alternative is to alloy Ni with Sn which hinders the CC bond formation and enhances the CO bond formation leading to the removal of surface C centers as carbon monoxide.135,136 It has been discussed that the Sn atoms separate the Ni centers on the catalyst surface, which tend to bind C atoms, from each other. With the Ni centers being separated, the C atoms on the surface are separated as well, which hinders the formation of coke.135,136 These theoretical results are consistent with experiments which show that pure Ni catalysts deactivate significantly faster than NiSn alloy based catalysts.135 Since the step sites play an essential role in the growth of the graphene islands, as mentioned above, additives such as potassium,66 sulfur,66 gold66 or boron131 have been proposed.66 Computational calculations have shown that these elements tend to occupy the step sites and thus avoid the formation of graphene islands.66,131 A similar strategy, by blocking the crucial sites, has been proposed to prevent the formation of a carbidic phase. Calculations have shown that boron prefers the same sub-surface sites on Ni as C.137 By occupying these sites with B, the diffusion of C to these sub-surface sites and the formation of the thermodynamically more stable carbide phase can be prevented.128 Apart from blocking the sub-surface sites, sub-surface boron in Ni(111) also has been shown to have an destabilizing effect on on-surface C centers,138 which may help to prevent the accumulation of C atoms on the surface."
          [3] "Although supported Pt catalysts show high activity, the catalyst deactivation due to coke formation remains a challenging issue."
          [4] "The robustness against coking can be increased with additional promoters, such as late transition metals, main-group metals including Sn and Ga, alkali-metal oxides and rare-earth metal oxides."
          [5] "It has been demonstrated for graphene islands on the Ni(111) surface, unsaturated C atoms at the edge of a graphene island are less stable than isolated C atoms on the metal surface."
          [6] "A cheaper alternative is to alloy Ni with Sn which hinders the CC bond formation and enhances the CO bond formation leading to the removal of surface C centers as carbon monoxide."
          [7] "Since the step sites play an essential role in the growth of the graphene islands, as mentioned above, additives such as potassium, sulfur, gold or boron have been proposed."
          [8] "Apart from blocking the sub-surface sites, sub-surface boron in Ni(111) also has been shown to have an destabilizing effect on on-surface C centers, which may help to prevent the accumulation of C atoms on the surface."

[1] "A catalyst design consisting of the double-decoration of nanoparticulate intermetallic PtGa with Pb and Ca was applied to produce an ultra-stable catalyst for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) at a high temperature."
          [2] "PtGaCaPb/SiO2 exhibited outstanding catalytic stability in PDH at 600C, and almost no deactivation was observed for up to 1month."
          [3] "Herein, we report a novel catalyst design concept, namely, the double decoration of PtGa intermetallics by Pb and Ca, which synergize the geometric and electronic promotion effects on the catalyst stability, respectively."
          [4] "Pb is deposited on the three-fold Pt3 sites of the PtGa nanoparticles to block them, whereas Ca, which affords an electron-enriched single-atom-like Pt1 site, is placed around the nanoparticles."
          [5] "Thus, PtGaCaPb/SiO2 exhibits an outstandingly high catalytic stability, even at 600C (kd=0.00033h1, τ=3067h), and almost no deactivation of the catalyst was observed for up to 1month for the first time."

[1] "To expose the loaded Pt on the surface of the carriers, ion exchange and impregnation are two simple and practical methods. The dispersion of Pt mainly depends on the precursors of Pt, the preparation conditions, the properties of the carriers, and the interaction between Pt and the carriers, as well as the additives."
          [2] "The addition of a second metal has been found to be highly effective for the sintering resistance of Pt particles. The introduced metal forms alloys with Pt around Pt particles,63 and the alloys anchor them on the surface of the carriers, making them not easy to migrate and coalesce."
          [3] "The application of the carriers possessing a strong interaction with Pt is another way to retard the sintering. Al2O3 is the most common carrier of Pt catalyst, in which the coordinatively unsaturated pentacoordinate Al3+ can anchor Pt to make it not easy to migrate."
          [4] "Nanocarbon was also reported as the carrier of Pt to improve the sintering resistance, and the strong metalcarrier interaction leads to the electron transfer from nanocarbon to the Pt particles, significantly preventing the sintering of Pt."
          [5] "MgAl2O4 spinel is also a good choice as the carrier. Generally, Pt is not directly loaded on MgAl2O4 spinel prepared beforehand, but firstly loaded into the spaces between the layers of MgAlOx hydrotalcite, and then Pt particles are enclosed in the interspace of MgAl2O4 spinel formed through the collapse of the layered structure of the hydrotalcite after calcination at high temperature."
          [6] "Moliner et al.67 reported effective methods to encapsulate Pt in highly siliceous chabazite, and the catalyst showed enhanced stability towards Pt sintering even at 650750 C in the atmospheres of H2, O2 and H2O."
          [7] "The Al2O3 overcoat has also proved to be efficient in preventing the sintering of Pt nanoparticles through atomic layer deposition."
          [8] "Tanabe et al. revealed that no Pt sintering was observed for Pt/MgO as an automotive exhaust catalyst after calcination in air at 900 C, for the formation of a Mg2PtO4-like compound prevents the migration of Pt."
          [9] "Nagai et al. found that CeO2 had a similar effect of MgO in preventing the sintering of Pt due to the formation of the PtOCe bond in the Pt/CeO2 catalyst."
          [10] "Recently, Pt supported on CeO2 has attracted more attention because of the ability of CeO2 to trap Pt in an atomically dispersed state."
          [11] "The atomically dispersed Pt is most likely to be present in the form of Pt2+ bonded to the ubiquitous step edges of the CeO2 surface."
          [12] "The addition of Ga, In, Zn, Cu, Ir, Co to Pt catalysts exhibits similar effects as Sn."
          [13] "Not only that, but Sattler et al.84 showed that in the highly active, selective and stable PtGaK/Al2O3 (0.1 wt% Pt, 3 wt% Ga, 0.25 wt% K) catalyst for the dehydrogenation of propane, the coordinately unsaturated Ga3+ is responsible for activating the CH bond, and Pt only acts as a promoter."
          [14] "Furthermore, just like the PtSn/CeO2 catalyst,29 the reactivity can be fully recovered via simple coke burning in air, although the sintering of Pt still occurs."
          [15] "Located at the same main group with Ga, In was also reported to be the promoter of supported Pt catalysts. The PtIn/Mg(Al)O catalyst prepared at pH 8 using the co-precipitation method exhibits the best catalytic performance and the strongest interaction between the metal phase and the carrier."
          [16] "B and Si, two nonmetal elements, can play similar roles, too. Dehydrogenation of n-butane over the PtB/SiO2 catalyst showed improved catalytic activity and stability compared with Pt/SiO2."
          [17] "Dadras et al.86 called B a magic bullet against sintering and coking, and they summarized the positive roles of B as follows. The non-stoichiometric PtB cluster is anchored to the carrier via a covalent BO bond, which is much stronger than the interaction between Pt clusters and the carrier surface."
          [18] "Additionally, the dissociation energy of a Pt atom from a PtB cluster is significantly larger than that from the pure Pt cluster, increasing the sintering resistance."
          [19] "Finally, the affinity of PtB cluster to C also drops dramatically, leading to the reduced coke formation and increased selectivity to olefins."
          [20] "It is predicted by a computational screening of main-group elements as potential additives for the Pt catalyst that Si, just as B, can modify the selectivity of the Pt catalyst by changing both electronic and geometric properties."

[1] "In this review, we outline the progress of these dehydrogenation catalysts that have been mainly developed in the past five years. For different classes of the most-promising catalysts in the selective dehydrogenation of ethane-to-ethylene and propane-to-propylene, their syntheses, structural information, catalytic properties and mechanisms are comparatively summarized."

[1] "To improve the stability of Pt-based catalysts, many efforts have been dedicated to strengthen metalsupport interactions by using various methods including the nanopore-encaged metal strategy,2124 wet-chemistry approach2529 and modification of supports.10,11,30,31 Among them, modification of supports is a relatively effective and simple method to improve the stability of Pt-based catalysts."
          [2] "For example, Lu et al. reported a PtSn/Al2O3 sheet catalyst for PDH, exhibiting high activity, selectivity and stability.11 It was proposed that the enhanced stability in PDH was associated with γ-Al2O3 nanosheets containing a great deal of pentacoordinate Al3+ ions, which can stabilize PtSn clusters by strong interactions between metals and supports."
          [3] "Recent work by Ma et al. showed that the addition of Ga into Mg(Al)O layer double hydrotalcites could greatly enhance the stability of Pt catalysts in PDH.10 It may be due to the fact that pentacoordinate Ga3+ ions could disperse and stabilize PtSn clusters, thereby enhancing the electronic interactions between Pt and Ga."
          [4] "A similar conclusion regarding the importance of modification of supports has been reported in the case of PtSn/CeO2 catalysts.30"
          [5] "Therefore, this provides a way to tune and enhance the catalytic activity and selectivity for the PDH process, and also introduces unique stability characteristics for bimetallic systems."
          [6] "Herein, highly stable Pt/Sn-Si-beta catalysts for PDH were prepared by an improved post-synthesis strategy, which consists of dealumination of H-beta and subsequent metal impregnation."
          [7] "It is indicated that Sn species existing in tetrahedral coordination states were incorporated into the framework of dealuminated beta (Si-beta)."
          [8] "Meanwhile, Pt species were highly dispersed in the form of ultra-small nanoclusters on Pt/Sn-Si-beta due to the strong interaction between Pt and Sn(IV) sites confined in the Si-beta framework."
          [9] "The prepared Pt/Sn-Si-beta catalysts show excellent catalytic performance for PDH, in which the propene formation rate was 2.3 mol g1Pt h1 with a propene selectivity of >99% at 550 C and the higher propene formation rate was 3.1 mol g1Pt h1 at 600 C."
          [10] "Moreover, the strong PtSn interactions and the confinement effect of Sn in the Si-beta framework inhibit the coke and sintering of Pt clusters, thereby achieving good stability of dehydrogenation and regeneration with almost unchanged catalytic activity during four cycles at 550 C."

[1] "Extensive research efforts have been made to inhibit deactivation and improve propene selectivity of Pt-based catalysts by doping promoters of Sn [9,10], In [11,12], Ga [13,14] and Cu [15] to form bimetallic catalysts."
          [2] "For example, PtIn [16] and PtGa [17,18] bimetallic nanoparticles (NPs) supported on calcined hydrotalcites (HT) show higher activity and selectivity in PDH, which has been attributed to the increased Pt dispersion and electron transfer from In or Ga to Pt [11,18]."
          [3] "Besides promoters, another method is to modify Al2O3 support with ZnO [19], La2O3 [20] or TiO2 [21] or replace Al2O3 support with ZnAl2O4 [22], ZSM-5 [23] or Mg(Al)O oxide [8,24]."
          [4] "Additionally, it has been verified that the single Pt atom sites on Pt-Sn/γ-Al2O3 with a sandwich structure are more favorable for PDH reaction than Pt ensembles [25,26]."
          [5] "Gong et al. [15] also reported that the PtCu single atom alloys can enhance the propane conversion and propene selectivity simultaneously in PDH."
          [6] "Whether as promoters or supports, an important aim of using them is to obtain highly and stably dispersed Pt-based catalysts so that improving PDH performance."
          [7] "However, it is still difficult to break through these challenges for PDH reactions [27], and the exact Pt-M-support relationship is still unclear."
          [8] "Therefore, it is extremely necessary to find more efficient methods to solve the problems mentioned above."
          [9] "In fact, the hierarchical morphology and porous structure play important roles in many heterogeneous catalytic reactions. However, the effect of hierarchical microstructure is seldom reported."
          [10] "Given that the small Pt NPs and hierarchical microstructure may provide more stable and easily accessible active sites for PDH reaction, a promising design for obtaining the desired size of active Pt and hierarchical pore morphology was proposed."

Stable and selective catalysts for propane dehydrogenation operating at thermodynamic limit Hitting the limits on propene synthesis The greater abundance of propane from shale gas has spurred efforts to use it as a propylene feedstock. Direct dehydrogenation catalysts consisting of platinumtin alloy nanoparticles supported on alumina often must run with hydrogen dilution to avoid carbon buildup and excess tin to avoid alloy segregation.
          We report that silica-supported platinum-tin (Pt1Sn1) nanoparticles (&lt;2 nanometers in diameter) can operate as a PDH catalyst at thermodynamically limited conversion levels, with excellent stability and selectivity to propylene (&gt;99%). Atomic mixing of Pt and Sn in the precursor is preserved upon reduction and during catalytic operation. The benign interaction of these nanoparticles with the silicon dioxide support does not lead to Pt-Sn segregation and formation of a tin oxide phase that can occur over traditional catalyst supports.
          To alleviate this issue, large quantities of Sn are used in the catalyst preparation (the nominal atomic loading is Sn:Pt between 4 and 5), which increases the yield of intermetallic PtSn NPs (12). In addition, studies have shown that adding hydrogen to the reactant feed reduces the rate of catalyst deactivation (13). Although this strategy is implemented commercially (10), addition of hydrogen in the feed lowers the thermodynamic limit on per-pass propane conversion (fig. S1) and decreases productivity (7).
          We developed a PDH catalyst that operates at thermodynamically limited conversion levels without the addition of hydrogen to the feed and exhibits excellent stability and selectivity to propylene (&gt;99%). The catalyst is composed of silica-supported Pt1Sn1 NPs, synthesized and pretreated to ensure that the mixing of Pt and Sn is preserved during catalytic operation.
          The principle behind catalyst synthesis is to begin with a heterometallic Pt-Sn coordination complex in which Pt and Sn are in immediate contact, and this interaction is retained during the reduction and PDH reaction.
          The data in Fig. 1, A to C, were obtained with 16 vol % propane in helium. Propane streams are diluted in commercial operations to increase the limiting equilibrium conversion, which is higher at lower propane partial pressure (fig. S2), and to limit catalyst deactivation rates (7, 16, 17). This approach requires additional downstream separation units and limits process efficiency.
          The data in Fig. 1, A to C, show the performance of the Pt1Sn1/SiO2 catalyst (1 wt % Pt and 0.6 wt % Sn) for propane dehydrogenation at 580C, 16 vol % propane (with the remainder helium) and at a weight hourly space velocity (WHSV) of 4.7 hours1. Under these reaction conditions, the thermodynamic limit on propane conversion is 66.5% (fig. S2). The Pt1Sn1/SiO2 catalyst showed near-thermodynamic conversion of &gt;66% (Fig. 1A, red circles) and &gt;99% selectivity to propylene (Fig. 1B, red circles).
          The data in Fig. 1D show that, under these conditions, the propane conversion goes from 41 to 39% in 120 min. Under identical conditions, the other tested catalysts deactivate very rapidly to very low conversion, as illustrated for the commercial mimic. A transmission electron microscopy (TEM) image of the spent catalyst, after 120 min of PDH reaction, is shown in fig. S6. The image shows that the Pt-Sn NPs are well dispersed, with an average particle diameter of 1.6  0.67 nm, which is consistent with the particle size in fresh samples.
          We attempted to regenerate the Pt1Sn1/SiO2 catalyst by oxidation, using 1% O2 as a mild oxidant at 500C followed by reduction at 600C (see supplementary materials for details of the regeneration procedure). The regeneration studies showed that Pt1Sn1/SiO2 catalysts can be partially regenerated. For example, we measured 97% of the initial activity and &gt;99% of the initial selectivity after three PDH/regeneration cycles (fig. S5).
          Data in Fig. 3A show that the process of mixing chloroplatinic acid (H2PtCl6) and tin(II) chloride (SnCl2) in 0.1 M hydrochloric acid solution formed a heterometallic Pt-Sn coordination complex.
          A bright-field TEM image of Pt-Sn NPs formed on SiO2 upon the reduction of the Pt-Sn complex shows high metal dispersion on the support, with an average NP size of 1.3  0.6 nm (Fig. 3B). The NP size distribution (Fig. 3C) shows that most NPs were &lt;2 nm. The XRD spectra in Fig. 3D show that the formed NPs were essentially alloys of Pt and Sn. This finding is supported by the presence of the XRD peaks corresponding to Pt1Sn1 (41.8 and 44.1) and Pt3Sn1 (39.0 and 45.3) stoichiometries.
          The real-space Pt LIII EXAFS spectra for the Pt1Sn1/SiO2 catalyst (Fig. 4D) are substantially different from the spectra of monometallic Pt and indicate the mixing of Pt and Sn atoms. The best-fit spectrum for the Pt1Sn1/SiO2 catalyst is characterized by the presence of the Pt-Pt and Pt-Sn scattering paths, consistent with the formation of PtSn intermetallic phases.









[1] "Pt-Sn clusters anchored at Al3+penta sites as a sinter-resistant and regenerable catalyst for propane dehydrogenation"
          [2] "Herein, a series of highly ordered mesoporous Al2O3 supports with different levels of Al3+penta sites, are fabricated and used as the support to disperse Pt-Sn2 clusters."
          [3] "The stability and regenerability of Pt-Sn2/meso-Al2O3 are strongly dependent on the content of Al3+penta sites in the Al2O3 structure, and a high level of Al3+penta sites can effectively prevent the agglomeration of Pt-Sn2 clusters into large Pt nanoparticles in the consecutive dehydrogenation-regeneration cycles."

          [3] "The method works well when using easily reducible late transition metals, but Pt alloy formation with rare-earth elements through the H2 reduction route is almost impossible owing to the low chemical potential of rare-earth element oxides6."

          [9] "The Pt metal alone exhibits high initial catalytic activity, but rapidly deactivates as a result of coke deposition on the Pt surface."
          [10] "The coke deposition also causes an undesirable loss of the catalytic selectivity to propylene."
          [11] "To alleviate these problems, Sn is introduced to form an alloy with Pt nanoparticles and thereby dilute the Pt surface with inactive Sn atoms and break up coke-generating Pt ensembles."

          [14] "The formation of the Pt3La and Pt3Y nanoparticles on the degallated zeolite brought a striking enhancement in all aspects of the PDH catalytic performance, including activity, selectivity and durability, as shown in Fig. 2."
          [15] "The catalytic reaction was performed at 580C using a pure propane flow at a large space velocity (see Methods), and these harsh operating conditions caused even the conventional PtSn/alumina catalyst to experience severe coke formation and catalyst deactivation within 1 d."
          [16] "In sharp contrast, the Pt3La intermetallic nanoparticles supported on the degallated zeolite (denoted as PtLa/mz-deGa, where mz stands for mesoporous zeolite) showed a high initial propane conversion of 40% (close to the equilibrium conversion) and underwent extremely slow deactivation, retaining 8% conversion even after 30 days of reaction."

[1] "Although the equilibrium conversion of alkanes increases with temperature, alkene selectivity decreases with increasing temperature and chain length due to an increased tendency toward dehydrocyclization/aromatisation, thermal cracking and coke formation."
          [2] "Direct dehydrogenation of lower alkanes is an energy intensive reaction; however, oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) has the potential to lower the energy requirement for achieving dehydrogenation."
          [3] "ODH can be considered as tandem endothermic (dehydrogenation, CnH2n + 2  CnH2n + H2) and exothermic (oxidation, H2 + O2  H2O) processes, with an overall thermodynamic summation, CnH2n + 2 + O2  CnH2n + H2O."
          [4] "Although the process is not thermo-neutral, part of the energy required for the endothermic reaction is augmented by the exothermic reaction."
          [5] "Thus, ODH of alkanes takes place at lower temperature compared to the corresponding non-ODH."
          [6] "This lower temperature requirement of ODH compared to non-ODH and cracking is encouraging and provides motivation for continued efforts to develop ODH into an industrial technology."
          [7] "Although ODH is attractive because of the energy intensification advantage, commercial ODH technologies hinge on innovative catalyst and process design, i.e. proper synergy of the endothermic dehydrogenation step with the exothermic hydrogen combustion and design of selective CH and hydrogen combustion catalysts."

          [14] "Lower alkanes are relatively inert, and they exhibit little or no reactivity at conditions typical for activating functional group reactions in organic compounds because they lack low-lying vacant orbitals or lone pair electrons."
          [15] "Alkanes are made up non-polar CC and CH bonds. These bonds consist of strongly localised electron pairs that are usually induced to reactivity under severe conditions (e.g., at high temperature or pressure, or with the use of aggressive reagents)."
          [16] "The first and rate-limiting step of alkane dehydrogenation using platinum or chromium oxide-based catalysts involves CH activation."
          [17] "Although a number of efforts have been made to gain insight on the mechanism of the reaction, questions still remain, especially regarding the pathway of the CH activation."
          [18] "It is of fundamental and applied interest to know whether the first CH bond cleavage is homolytic or heterolytic."
          [19] "If it is a heterolytic pathway, it will further be of interest to know whether the first hydrogen from the alkane substrate is abstracted as a proton or as a hydride ion."
          [20] "This knowledge will benefit catalyst improvement efforts."
          [21] "The simple impregnation techniques for preparing supported (especially alumina) metal and oxide catalysts becloud their structural heterogeneity."

          [25] "Although several solid acid catalysts are used in alkane conversions, zeolites have the advantage of possessing a well-defined structure, allowing the structure-activity relationship to be easily deduced."
          [26] "Therefore, it is instructive to examine non-oxidative dehydrogenation of light alkanes over zeolite catalysts."
          [27] "A detailed knowledge of the adsorption mechanism of lower alkane molecules on zeolite is of interest in this context, especially for informed tuning of zeolite properties to allow efficient and selective dehydrogenation of alkanes."
          [28] "Light alkanes are adsorbed on zeolites via dispersive interaction."
          [29] "Protons and the exchanged metals ions are typically the active sites in zeolites, while the zeolite framework plays the role of anchor for the active sites and/or dispersion medium for the reactants."
          [30] "The framework of microporous zeolites exerts dispersive forces on the reactant's molecules that depend on the shape, channel and cavity of the framework."
          [31] "In addition, the nature and the density of the active sites influence the framework dispersion forces."
          [32] "Recent reports have shown that the strong electrostatic field between protons or exchanged metal ions and basic oxygen species can enhance and/or induce polarization of bonds in hydrocarbon adsorbates."
          [33] "This agrees with Hashiguchi et al., who found enhanced activation of the CH bond on a homogeneous catalyst."
          [34] "Wender et al. showed that 3040% of heat adsorption in n-alkanes on Na-zeolite is due to polarization of the adsorbates."
          [35] "Subbotina et al. also demonstrated that the CH bond of ethane is more strongly polarized on Mg2 + and Ca2 + forms of Y zeolite than on Na+ forms."
          [36] "Mg2 +-Y zeolite molecules exhibit weaker adsorption and polarization of ethane than Ca2 +-zeolites."
          [37] "Based on charge density considerations, Mg2 + cations are expected to exhibit a stronger polarizing effect than Ca2 + cations."
          [38] "Subbotina et al. explain that because of the smaller ionic radius of Mg2 +, it is more strongly shielded by the surrounding oxygen atoms of the zeolite lattice than a Ca2 + ion, thereby reducing the polarizing effect of Mg2 + on the hydrocarbon adsorbate."
          [39] "Sievers et al. also report that the La3 + form of X zeolite induces strong polarization of adsorbed alkane molecules; partial positive charges were induced on secondary and tertiary carbon atoms of alkane molecules."
          [40] "The authors suggest that the polarization may be viewed as an intermediate condition to hydride abstraction (which is an important elementary step in CH activation)."
          [41] "They add that CH bond polarization was enhanced by physisorbed water molecules that coordinate with La3 + cations."
          [42] "The enhanced polarization of CH bonds by the presence of water molecules on La3 +X zeolite may have a beneficial effect in oxidative dehydrogenation where water is a by-product."
          [43] "Alkane polarization studies on Na+, Mg2 +, Ca2 +, and La3 + exchanged X-zeolites indicate that the polarizing effect increases with increasing charge magnitude and ionic radius."
          [44] "Note that these alkane polarizing cations occupy the same position on the zeolites as the well-known CH activation cations/metals, and thus the CH polarizing effect has a complementary effect on CH activation."
          [45] "This may add to the number of relevant variables and increase the challenge of optimizing the ratio of activation/polarizing cations among exchangeable sites (Si/Al ratio), as well as the sequence for incorporating the cations or metals during catalyst preparation."
          [46] "Further, it is important to note that the choice of cations should be such that they exhibit no catalytic (oligomerization, isomerization, aromatisation or oxidation) effects on the target alkene products at the reaction condition."
          [47] "Furthermore, it may be beneficial to create a CH polarization effect on the zeolite framework."
          [48] "This can be achieved by appropriate chance of framework atoms."
          [49] "Since active sites are usually created on the zeolite frameworks."
          [50] "The activation of CH bonds of light alkanes occurs readily on super electrophiles (super Brnsted and super Lewis acid) at low temperatures."

          [53] "However, despite the decades of intensive investigations on the subject, the actual mechanism of CH activation on acid zeolite is still debated."
          [54] "Two CH activation paths are generally recognized: the unimolecular/protolytic mechanism and the bimolecular/carbenium chain mechanism."
          [55] "The unimolecular mechanism involves direct protonation of an alkane-forming carbonium ion intermediate."
          [56] "The proton can be inserted into either a CC or CH bond of the alkane."
          [57] "Proton insertion through the CC bond leads to cracking of the alkane, with the acid site regenerated."
          [58] "Insertion through the HC bond yields H2 and a carbenium ion/alkoxide intermediate."
          [59] "Desorption of alkene from the intermediate regenerates the acid, or the alkoxide can enter the bimolecular conversion path."
          [60] "In the bimolecular mechanism of CH activation, the alkoxide intermediate constitutes the active sites and CH activation occurs through hydride transfer from a second alkane molecule forming another alkoxide."
          [61] "This may be followed by βscission to regenerate the active site and complete the catalytic cycle."
          [62] "For example, activation of propane on acid zeolite based on the two mechanisms is illustrated in Scheme 1."
          [63] "Low reactant partial pressure and high temperature favor unimolecular dehydrogenation of alkane on acid zeolite."
          [64] "These conditions favor the endothermic desorption step (rate limiting step) leading to propene."
          [65] "In contrast, high partial pressure and low temperature favor the bimolecular mechanism leading to a low propene yield."
          [66] "The two molecular mechanisms devoid of side reactions give fairly predictable product distribution."
          [67] "However, the products of each route are prone to side reactions (dimerization, oligomerization, isomerization & aromatisation) in the presence of Bronsted acid sites."
          [68] "Hence propene selectivity on acidic zeolite is very low and products rich in aromatics are usually obtained."
          [69] "The active sites (alkoxide intermediate) of the bimolecular pathway are formed in situ."
          [70] "The alkoxide intermediate is made up of an alkyl carbenium ion ionically held to the zeolite framework oxygen ion."
          [71] "The active sites of the unimolecular pathway are the charge balancing protons of the zeolite framework."
          [72] "A proton and a carbenium ion are an electrophilic or Lewis acid species (a proton can also be considered as a special case of Lewis acidity)."
          [73] "The two pathways essentially involve electrophilic CH activation."
          [74] "The electrophiles (proton and carbenium ion) activate CH at high temperatures (500 C), giving low conversion rates of light alkanes and poor selectivity to corresponding alkenes."
          [75] "Iglesia and co-workers used isotopic labeling studies to demonstrate that CH activation is not the rate-limiting step in the dehydrogenation of propane on H-ZSM-5 and Ga/H-ZSM-5."
          [76] "They proposed that the CH bond cleavage produces an H-adatom and an alkoxide intermediate."
          [77] "Desorption of an alkene from the alkoxide regenerates the proton sites on the zeolites."
          [78] "An alkoxide intermediate may also discharge as a hydrogen rich species through cracking."
          [79] "Iglesia et al. proposed that desorption or disposal of the H-adatom from the CH bond cleavage is the rate-limiting step."
          [80] "A similar deduction was reached by Yu et al."
          [81] "who found that desorption of the alkoxides intermediate is the rate-limiting step under conditions that favor the unimolecular mechanism."
          [82] "The above proposition has been demonstrated on metal (e.g., Ga, Zn, and Co) exchanged zeolites."
          [83] "The specific role of the exchanged metals has been the subject of several reports with special attention on Ga and Zn."
          [84] "Although the framework Ga2O3 on H-MFI seems to have a CH polarization effect on desorbed methane, Ga2O3 exhibits lower CH activation activity."
          [85] "The physical mixture of Ga2O3/HMFI displays higher propane aromatisation activity than pure H-MFI."
          [86] "Similar synergistic effects have been reported for Zn/H-MFI and Co/H-MFI."
          [87] "Exchanged cations behave as monomeric species at the exchange sites of zeolite."
          [88] "Iglesia and Biscardi hypothesized that the monomeric species enhance propane conversion by promoting re-combinative desorption (RD) of the H-adatom formed from the CH cleavage."
          [89] "It is worthwhile noting that the exchange cations (electrophilic species) constitute the CH activation sites."
          [90] "Hence, more insights are required about their additional role in promoting RD."
          [91] "However, the authors did not provide further information on the nature of the H-adatoms and the mechanism of RD."
          [92] "In the next section, we examine the mechanism of desorption of H-adatoms over Ga and Zn exchanged H-ZSM-5."
          [93] "The exchanged metal ions in zeolites are held ionically by one or more basic oxygen atoms."
          [94] "Different species have been suggested, depending on the density of the cation exchange site of the zeolite and method of introduction of the metals."
          [95] "According to Kanansky et al."
          [96] "the exchanged Zn and Ga species on H-ZSM-5 and their mechanism of CH activation are distinctively different."
          [97] "Zn and Ga are introduced on H-ZSM-5 through a vapor deposition technique using Zn metal vapor and Ga(CH3)3 as the source of Zn and Ga, respectively."
          [98] "The metal introduction technique allows quantitative exchange of the zeolite protons which leads to Zn/Al = 0.5 and Ga/Al = 1, respectively."
          [99] "Zn2 + is generated directly, but Ga+ is produced by H2 treatment at 500 C to release the methyl groups."
          [100] "The proposed active sites are OZn2+O and OGa+, respectively."
          [101] "The mechanism of CH activation with ethane by the two sites under the same reaction conditions are summarized in Scheme 2."
          [102] "The proposed mechanism is in agreement with the mechanism suggested from calculations using the GAUSSIAN 94 program for ethane activation on Zn-exchanged zeolite by Frash and van Santen."
          [103] "In another theoretical study using a DFT cluster modeling approach, Pidko and van Santen compared the activation energy of CH with three types of Zn species at active sites: OZn2+O, OZn+OZn+O and HOZn+ O."
          [104] "The authors suggest that the reaction proceeds most easily on OZn2+O, and hypothesize that the enhanced Lewis activity of OZn2+O facilitates CH heterolytic cleavage."
          [105] "They further argue that the first proton abstraction occurs preferentially on the oxygen sites neighboring the ring where the cation is located."
          [106] "They proposed a one-step reaction to yield H2 and C2H4 from the decomposition of the Zn-alkyl and proton."
          [107] "A proposed mechanism of CH activation on OGa+ has similarly been suggested using theoretical calculations."
          [108] "High alkene selectivities are obtained on the H-ZSM-5 when exchangeable protons are rigorously replaced by Zn and Ga."
          [109] "The Zn-exchanged H-ZSM-5 had higher ethane conversion rates but lower ethene selectivity than its Ga counterpart."
          [110] "The CH activation on the OZn2+O site can be described by a Lewis base-assisted deprotonation mechanism."
          [111] "This is accompanied by conversion of the Lewis base site to a conjugate Bronsted acid site."
          [112] "The OGa+ site, however, activates the CH bond via oxidative addition without a protonic site intermediate."
          [113] "A protonic site intermediate increases tendency of side reactions on the Zn-exchanged H-ZSM-5 relative to the Ga counterpart."
          [114] "The elementary steps of CH activation on OGa+ (Scheme 2) reveal that a redox cycle at the metal center is required for catalytic CH activation via the oxidative addition mechanism."
          [115] "A redox cycle is not apparent in the elementary step presented for CH activation on OZn2+O."
          [116] "Hence, a redox cycle is not a requisite for CH activation via the Lewis base-assisted deprotonation mechanism."
          [117] "However, under alkane dehydrogenation reaction conditions, the OZn2+O sites can undergo a reversible Zn2 +/Zn redox process."
          [118] "This redox process increases the availability of undesired protonic site intermediates."
          [119] "Zn-exchanged H-ZSM-5 prepared by conventional ion-exchange methods contain a significant percentage of unexchanged proton sites leading to lower alkene selectivity of the catalyst."
          [120] "Iglesia and Biscardi titrate the proton sites with NaOH."
          [121] "The un-titrated and the titrated catalysts are denoted as Zn/H-ZSMS-5 and Zn/Na-ZSMS-5, respectively."
          [122] "Zn/Na-ZSM-5 has four times the propane conversion rate and a higher propene selectivity than Zn/H-ZSMS-5."
          [123] "The propene formation rate obtained with Zn/Na-ZSM-5 was ten times that of Zn/H-ZSMS-5."
          [124] "The zinc species at the cation exchange site of the zeolite was identified as OZn+OH."
          [125] "The higher propene selectivity obtained on Zn/Na-ZSM-5 compared to Zn/H-ZSMS-5 is presumably from the lower density and availability of proton sites on Zn/Na-ZSM-5."
          [126] "The improved propane conversion rate of Zn/Na-ZSM-5 compared to Zn/H-ZSM-5 is attributable to the higher efficiency of OZn+OH sites in catalyzing desorption of H-adatoms than OZn2+O sites."
          [127] "Another strategy to enhance alkene selectivity is by controlling the strength of the proton sites."
          [128] "The acidity of the sites depends on the nature of the trivalent cation of the zeolite framework."
          [129] "Proton sites in borosilicate zeolites are weaker than those of aluminosilicate, and thus higher alkene selectivity is expected for alkane dehydrogenation over Zn/H[B]-ZSM-5 compared to Zn/H[Al]-ZSM-5."
          [130] "However, Zn/H[B]-ZSM-5 shows no activity for propane dehydrogenation."
          [131] "The desired weaker acidity of the proton sites of Zn/H[B]-ZSM-5 requires weaker basicity of the oxygen atoms in the zeolite framework."
          [132] "This reduced basicity of the oxygen atoms is not sufficiently polarizing to complement the exchanged Zn2 + in CH bond cleavage."
          [133] "In the next section, we examine use of zeolite support to design a Pt-based alkane dehydrogenation catalyst."
          [134] "Elimination of the proton sites of zeolites is critical for obtaining a high alkene selectivity and stability in dehydrogenation catalysts."
          [135] "Pt is the most versatile noble metal catalyst for alkane reactions."
          [136] "Although Pt is expensive, the choice of Pt is often justified by its higher activity, stability and selectivity for these reactions compared to less expensive alternative transition metals."
          [137] "However, rapid catalyst deactivation due to coke formation remains a challenge even when using a Pt-based catalyst for dehydrogenation of light alkanes."
          [138] "Waku et al."
          [139] "exploited the unique property of zeolite as a support for achieving high metal dispersion through cation exchange sites to create a Pt/Na[Fe]-ZSM-5 catalyst with outstanding stability for dehydrogenation of light alkanes."
          [140] "They found that the catalyst deactivation rate of Pt/Na[Fe]-ZSM-5 was lower than for any other Pt-based catalysts in refractory oxide support."
          [141] "The unprecedented performance of Pt/Na[Fe]-ZSM-5 was attributed to its high Pt dispersion (cluster size < 1 mm) on zeolite through ion-exchange."
          [142] "There is a tendency to generate some Brnsted protons on the zeolite during the exchange process, but the choice of Fe3 + as an isomorphous cation in place of Al3 + led to weaker Brnsted sites in [Fe]-ZSM compared to [Al]-ZSM."
          [143] "The weaker acidity minimizes the tendency of side reactions (cracking of oligomerization, aromatisation, and coke), which translates into higher alkene selectivity and catalyst stability."
          [144] "In another report, Xuebing and Iglesia demonstrated the ability of Pt/Na[Fe]-ZSM-5 to dehydrogenate alkanes longer than C4; n-pentane and n-heptane were selectively converted to n-pentene and n-heptene, respectively."
          [145] "Alkene selectivity was also improved when the residual proton generated during Pt exchange or Na-[Fe]-ZSM was titrated with Cs."
          [146] "Although Pt with conventional refractory oxides (Al2O3, SiO2, ZrO2, etc.) used for dehydrogenation of alkanes has similar conversion rates to Pt/Na[Fe]-ZSM-5, deactivation rates are also rapid due to coke formation."
          [147] "The presence of acid (Bronsted and Lewis) sites on the supports promotes readsorption, oligomerization and aromatisation of alkenes."
          [148] "Promotion of Pt with metals, such as Sn, Ga, Zn, Re, etc., improves catalyst stability, but also leads to faster deactivation rates than Pt/Na[Fe]-ZSM-5."
          [149] "However, recent reports by Bell et al."
          [150] "show that the use of calcined hydrotalcite (Al/Mg  0.1) supported on bimetallic PtGa or PtSn gave very high alkene selectivity and stability, comparable to Pt/Na[Fe]-ZSM-5."
          [151] "At this stage, we can conclude that differences in the performance of Zn and Ga exchanged H-ZSM-5 obtained by Kanansky et al."
          [152] "are attributable to their respective CH activation mechanisms."
          [153] "In addition, the role of exchanged Zn and Ga as promoters of RD becomes evident from the mechanisms (Scheme 2)."
          [154] "The RD mechanism on Ga exchanged H-ZSM-5 is by reductive elimination of a hydrogen molecule from O[Ga(H)2]+ intermediate."
          [155] "Decomposition of ZnR and a protonic site, or neutralization of the proton sites by ZnH, leads to desorption of the hydrogen molecule on the Zn-exchanged H-ZSM-5."
          [156] "By extrapolation, the mechanisms of CH activation on exchanged Zn and Ga H-ZSM-5 can described the mechanism of alkane dehydrogenation on Cr-based and Pt-based catalysts respectively."
          [157] "The electronic promotion effect of Sn is in line with the oxidative addition CH activation mechanism."
          [158] "However, the Lewis base-assisted deprotonation mechanism could also explain the proposed CH activation on Cr-based catalysts."
          [159] "Now, the nature and the role of surface oxygen species become more evident."
          [160] "The role of potassium in commercial Cr and Pt-based dehydrogenation catalysts is to minimize the undesired influence of protonic sites on alkene selectivity."
          [161] "The highlights in this section are presented in Table 2."
          [162] "The table reveals the insights achieved on the reaction mechanism, alkene selectivity and catalyst stability for non-oxidative dehydrogenation of lower alkanes."
          [163] "Nonetheless, the level of catalyst activity is still far from acceptable, even at high temperature."
          [164] "A recent report by Rothenberg et al."
          [165] "provides a lead in this respect."
          [166] "Their report indicates that a porous copperaluminum framework material (stabilized by metal oxide) has better performance (activity/selectivity/stability) for propane dehydrogenation than a PtSn/Al2O3."
          [167] "Of particular interest, is the suggestion that achieving propane dehydrogenation at 350 C may be possible."
          [168] "Few details are known about the structure of the porous copperaluminum framework material."
          [169] "However, copper is implicated as providing the active sites for the catalysis."
          [170] "Also, that the material activated in oxygen gave higher propane conversion rates than those activated in inert gas atmosphere underscores the role of the surface oxide (oxygen species) in the catalysis."
          [171] "Thus, the Lewis base-assisted deprotonation mechanism may be invoked here, and the redox property of the metal center is likely to play a role in achieving propane dehydrogenation at 350 C."
          [172] "This should constitute the future research direction for non-oxidative dehydrogenation of lower alkanes."
          [173] "Although the equilibrium conversion of alkanes increases with temperature, alkene selectivity decreases with increasing temperature and chain length due to an increased tendency toward dehydrocyclization/aromatisation, thermal cracking and coke formation."
          [174] "Direct dehydrogenation of lower alkanes is an energy intensive reaction; however, oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) has the potential to lower the energy requirement for achieving dehydrogenation."
          [175] "ODH can be considered as tandem endothermic (dehydrogenation, CnH2n + 2  CnH2n + H2) and exothermic (oxidation, H2 + O2  H2O) processes, with an overall thermodynamic summation, CnH2n + 2 + O2  CnH2n + H2O."
          [176] "Although the process is not thermo-neutral, part of the energy required for the endothermic reaction is augmented by the exothermic reaction."
          [177] "Thus, ODH of alkanes takes place at lower temperature compared to the corresponding non-ODH."
          [178] "This lower temperature requirement of ODH compared to non-ODH and cracking is encouraging and provides motivation for continued efforts to develop ODH into an industrial technology."
          [179] "Although ODH is attractive because of the energy intensification advantage, commercial ODH technologies hinge on innovative catalyst and process design, i.e. proper synergy of the endothermic dehydrogenation step with the exothermic hydrogen combustion and design of selective CH and hydrogen combustion catalysts."
          [180] "In this report, we provide an overview on CH activation and reaction routes to alkane dehydrogenation."
          [181] "We seek to gain insights about components of the active sites of CH activation to provide a platform for rational design of new efficient catalysts for dehydrogenation of lower alkanes."
          [182] "We focus on propane dehydrogenation because of the need for alternative and/or complementary technology for propene production to supplement existing technologies."
          [183] "We survey non-oxidative and oxidative dehydrogenation approaches, and examine reaction routes that are intermediate between these two main approaches."
          [184] "Although the equilibrium conversion of alkanes increases with temperature, alkene selectivity decreases with increasing temperature and chain length due to an increased tendency toward dehydrocyclization/aromatisation, thermal cracking and coke formation."

[1] "Although there are other metallic reforming catalysts such as Ru and Rh, which are less strongly prone to coking than Ni,129 Ni is one of the most common reforming catalysts, which is partly due to its significantly cheaper price. In order to overcome the coking problem of Ni catalysts, numerous theoretical studies have been conducted to understand the coke formation on nickel and to come up with potential strategies to avoid the unwanted coking process."
          [2] "It could be shown that the adsorption of C atoms on the closed packed surface of a NiAu surface alloy is thermodynamically less favoured, by 23 kJ mol1 or more, than the analogous process on a pure Ni(111) surface.134 Based on this finding, it has been proposed to alloy Ni with Au.134 A cheaper alternative is to alloy Ni with Sn which hinders the CC bond formation and enhances the CO bond formation leading to the removal of surface C centers as carbon monoxide.135,136 It has been discussed that the Sn atoms separate the Ni centers on the catalyst surface, which tend to bind C atoms, from each other. With the Ni centers being separated, the C atoms on the surface are separated as well, which hinders the formation of coke.135,136 These theoretical results are consistent with experiments which show that pure Ni catalysts deactivate significantly faster than NiSn alloy based catalysts.135 Since the step sites play an essential role in the growth of the graphene islands, as mentioned above, additives such as potassium,66 sulfur,66 gold66 or boron131 have been proposed.66 Computational calculations have shown that these elements tend to occupy the step sites and thus avoid the formation of graphene islands.66,131 A similar strategy, by blocking the crucial sites, has been proposed to prevent the formation of a carbidic phase. Calculations have shown that boron prefers the same sub-surface sites on Ni as C.137 By occupying these sites with B, the diffusion of C to these sub-surface sites and the formation of the thermodynamically more stable carbide phase can be prevented.128 Apart from blocking the sub-surface sites, sub-surface boron in Ni(111) also has been shown to have an destabilizing effect on on-surface C centers,138 which may help to prevent the accumulation of C atoms on the surface."
          [3] "Although supported Pt catalysts show high activity, the catalyst deactivation due to coke formation remains a challenging issue."
          [4] "The robustness against coking can be increased with additional promoters, such as late transition metals, main-group metals including Sn and Ga, alkali-metal oxides and rare-earth metal oxides."
          [5] "It has been demonstrated for graphene islands on the Ni(111) surface, unsaturated C atoms at the edge of a graphene island are less stable than isolated C atoms on the metal surface."
          [6] "A cheaper alternative is to alloy Ni with Sn which hinders the CC bond formation and enhances the CO bond formation leading to the removal of surface C centers as carbon monoxide."
          [7] "Since the step sites play an essential role in the growth of the graphene islands, as mentioned above, additives such as potassium, sulfur, gold or boron have been proposed."
          [8] "Apart from blocking the sub-surface sites, sub-surface boron in Ni(111) also has been shown to have an destabilizing effect on on-surface C centers, which may help to prevent the accumulation of C atoms on the surface."

[1] "A catalyst design consisting of the double-decoration of nanoparticulate intermetallic PtGa with Pb and Ca was applied to produce an ultra-stable catalyst for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) at a high temperature."
          [2] "PtGaCaPb/SiO2 exhibited outstanding catalytic stability in PDH at 600C, and almost no deactivation was observed for up to 1month."
          [3] "Herein, we report a novel catalyst design concept, namely, the double decoration of PtGa intermetallics by Pb and Ca, which synergize the geometric and electronic promotion effects on the catalyst stability, respectively."
          [4] "Pb is deposited on the three-fold Pt3 sites of the PtGa nanoparticles to block them, whereas Ca, which affords an electron-enriched single-atom-like Pt1 site, is placed around the nanoparticles."
          [5] "Thus, PtGaCaPb/SiO2 exhibits an outstandingly high catalytic stability, even at 600C (kd=0.00033h1, τ=3067h), and almost no deactivation of the catalyst was observed for up to 1month for the first time."

[1] "To expose the loaded Pt on the surface of the carriers, ion exchange and impregnation are two simple and practical methods. The dispersion of Pt mainly depends on the precursors of Pt, the preparation conditions, the properties of the carriers, and the interaction between Pt and the carriers, as well as the additives."
          [2] "The addition of a second metal has been found to be highly effective for the sintering resistance of Pt particles. The introduced metal forms alloys with Pt around Pt particles,63 and the alloys anchor them on the surface of the carriers, making them not easy to migrate and coalesce."
          [3] "The application of the carriers possessing a strong interaction with Pt is another way to retard the sintering. Al2O3 is the most common carrier of Pt catalyst, in which the coordinatively unsaturated pentacoordinate Al3+ can anchor Pt to make it not easy to migrate."
          [4] "Nanocarbon was also reported as the carrier of Pt to improve the sintering resistance, and the strong metalcarrier interaction leads to the electron transfer from nanocarbon to the Pt particles, significantly preventing the sintering of Pt."
          [5] "MgAl2O4 spinel is also a good choice as the carrier. Generally, Pt is not directly loaded on MgAl2O4 spinel prepared beforehand, but firstly loaded into the spaces between the layers of MgAlOx hydrotalcite, and then Pt particles are enclosed in the interspace of MgAl2O4 spinel formed through the collapse of the layered structure of the hydrotalcite after calcination at high temperature."
          [6] "Moliner et al.67 reported effective methods to encapsulate Pt in highly siliceous chabazite, and the catalyst showed enhanced stability towards Pt sintering even at 650750 C in the atmospheres of H2, O2 and H2O."
          [7] "The Al2O3 overcoat has also proved to be efficient in preventing the sintering of Pt nanoparticles through atomic layer deposition."
          [8] "Tanabe et al. revealed that no Pt sintering was observed for Pt/MgO as an automotive exhaust catalyst after calcination in air at 900 C, for the formation of a Mg2PtO4-like compound prevents the migration of Pt."
          [9] "Nagai et al. found that CeO2 had a similar effect of MgO in preventing the sintering of Pt due to the formation of the PtOCe bond in the Pt/CeO2 catalyst."
          [10] "Recently, Pt supported on CeO2 has attracted more attention because of the ability of CeO2 to trap Pt in an atomically dispersed state."
          [11] "The atomically dispersed Pt is most likely to be present in the form of Pt2+ bonded to the ubiquitous step edges of the CeO2 surface."
          [12] "The addition of Ga, In, Zn, Cu, Ir, Co to Pt catalysts exhibits similar effects as Sn."
          [13] "Not only that, but Sattler et al.84 showed that in the highly active, selective and stable PtGaK/Al2O3 (0.1 wt% Pt, 3 wt% Ga, 0.25 wt% K) catalyst for the dehydrogenation of propane, the coordinately unsaturated Ga3+ is responsible for activating the CH bond, and Pt only acts as a promoter."
          [14] "Furthermore, just like the PtSn/CeO2 catalyst,29 the reactivity can be fully recovered via simple coke burning in air, although the sintering of Pt still occurs."
          [15] "Located at the same main group with Ga, In was also reported to be the promoter of supported Pt catalysts. The PtIn/Mg(Al)O catalyst prepared at pH 8 using the co-precipitation method exhibits the best catalytic performance and the strongest interaction between the metal phase and the carrier."
          [16] "B and Si, two nonmetal elements, can play similar roles, too. Dehydrogenation of n-butane over the PtB/SiO2 catalyst showed improved catalytic activity and stability compared with Pt/SiO2."
          [17] "Dadras et al.86 called B a magic bullet against sintering and coking, and they summarized the positive roles of B as follows. The non-stoichiometric PtB cluster is anchored to the carrier via a covalent BO bond, which is much stronger than the interaction between Pt clusters and the carrier surface."
          [18] "Additionally, the dissociation energy of a Pt atom from a PtB cluster is significantly larger than that from the pure Pt cluster, increasing the sintering resistance."
          [19] "Finally, the affinity of PtB cluster to C also drops dramatically, leading to the reduced coke formation and increased selectivity to olefins."
          [20] "It is predicted by a computational screening of main-group elements as potential additives for the Pt catalyst that Si, just as B, can modify the selectivity of the Pt catalyst by changing both electronic and geometric properties."

[1] "In this review, we outline the progress of these dehydrogenation catalysts that have been mainly developed in the past five years. For different classes of the most-promising catalysts in the selective dehydrogenation of ethane-to-ethylene and propane-to-propylene, their syntheses, structural information, catalytic properties and mechanisms are comparatively summarized."

          [5] "The synthesis chemistry contributes to the stabilization effect of Pt through strong PtOCe bonds."
          [6] "The synthesis strategy has been reported for the zeolite-confined Pt single-atom and nanocluter catalysts with high stability."

          [12] "The synthesis method allows it to serve as a potent ion-exchanger, resulting in the stabilization of the highly dispersed bimetallic PtZn sites by the ETS-2 support."

[1] "To improve the stability of Pt-based catalysts, many efforts have been dedicated to strengthen metalsupport interactions by using various methods including the nanopore-encaged metal strategy,2124 wet-chemistry approach2529 and modification of supports.10,11,30,31 Among them, modification of supports is a relatively effective and simple method to improve the stability of Pt-based catalysts."
          [2] "For example, Lu et al. reported a PtSn/Al2O3 sheet catalyst for PDH, exhibiting high activity, selectivity and stability.11 It was proposed that the enhanced stability in PDH was associated with γ-Al2O3 nanosheets containing a great deal of pentacoordinate Al3+ ions, which can stabilize PtSn clusters by strong interactions between metals and supports."
          [3] "Recent work by Ma et al. showed that the addition of Ga into Mg(Al)O layer double hydrotalcites could greatly enhance the stability of Pt catalysts in PDH.10 It may be due to the fact that pentacoordinate Ga3+ ions could disperse and stabilize PtSn clusters, thereby enhancing the electronic interactions between Pt and Ga."
          [4] "A similar conclusion regarding the importance of modification of supports has been reported in the case of PtSn/CeO2 catalysts.30"
          [5] "Therefore, this provides a way to tune and enhance the catalytic activity and selectivity for the PDH process, and also introduces unique stability characteristics for bimetallic systems."
          [6] "Herein, highly stable Pt/Sn-Si-beta catalysts for PDH were prepared by an improved post-synthesis strategy, which consists of dealumination of H-beta and subsequent metal impregnation."
          [7] "It is indicated that Sn species existing in tetrahedral coordination states were incorporated into the framework of dealuminated beta (Si-beta)."
          [8] "Meanwhile, Pt species were highly dispersed in the form of ultra-small nanoclusters on Pt/Sn-Si-beta due to the strong interaction between Pt and Sn(IV) sites confined in the Si-beta framework."
          [9] "The prepared Pt/Sn-Si-beta catalysts show excellent catalytic performance for PDH, in which the propene formation rate was 2.3 mol g1Pt h1 with a propene selectivity of >99% at 550 C and the higher propene formation rate was 3.1 mol g1Pt h1 at 600 C."
          [10] "Moreover, the strong PtSn interactions and the confinement effect of Sn in the Si-beta framework inhibit the coke and sintering of Pt clusters, thereby achieving good stability of dehydrogenation and regeneration with almost unchanged catalytic activity during four cycles at 550 C."



[1] "Although the direct dehydrogenation technique has been industrialized, the fabrication of the corresponding catalysts is still confronted with a series of plights."
          [2] "Decades have witnessed the efforts made and strategies proposed by devoted researchers to optimize the catalyst performance and improve the catalytic stability from a wide panorama."

          [5] "Promoters can greatly impact the catalytic behaviors in PDH catalysts, showing advantages in suppression of side reactions, inhibition of coke deposition, stabilizing active compounds and so on."
          [6] "Metallic Pt has already been recognized as an effective catalyst for alkane dehydrogenation reactions due to its high affinity for paraffinic CH bonds."
          [7] "Currently, adding metal promoters to form alloys or intermetallic compounds is one of the most effective methods to ameliorate central active components and inhibit catalytic deactivation in Pt-based catalytic systems."
          [8] "Sn is a widely utilized promoter for Pt catalysts."
          [9] "The PtGa catalyst system has also been implemented in production plants (FCDh technique)."
          [10] "In has also been developed as a promising promoter of Pt-based catalysts."
          [11] "Zn is another analogous but economical promoter for Pt-based catalysts."
          [12] "Many other metals, including Fe, Cu, and Co, can also be promoters for Pt-based catalysts to adjust the electronic properties and improve the dispersion of Pt atoms for further stability enhancement."
          [13] "Alloying of Pt with rare-earth elements (REEs) has barely been accomplished through the conventional H2 reduction route due to the low chemical potential of REE oxides."
          [14] "Supported metal oxide-based catalysts, including CoOx-, ZnOx-, VOx-, and CrOx-based catalysts, are other important PDH catalysts and have been extensively studied for decades."
          [15] "Introducing another metal oxide to form an oxide compound is an effective approach to improve the dispersion of active species and enhance the catalytic stability under the applied conditions, showing advantages in modifying the coordination and electronic state of host metal oxide sites."
          [16] "The introduction of an appropriate metal oxide or noble metal into a catalytic system can greatly enhance the catalytic performance."



[1] "Extensive research efforts have been made to inhibit deactivation and improve propene selectivity of Pt-based catalysts by doping promoters of Sn [9,10], In [11,12], Ga [13,14] and Cu [15] to form bimetallic catalysts."
          [2] "For example, PtIn [16] and PtGa [17,18] bimetallic nanoparticles (NPs) supported on calcined hydrotalcites (HT) show higher activity and selectivity in PDH, which has been attributed to the increased Pt dispersion and electron transfer from In or Ga to Pt [11,18]."
          [3] "Besides promoters, another method is to modify Al2O3 support with ZnO [19], La2O3 [20] or TiO2 [21] or replace Al2O3 support with ZnAl2O4 [22], ZSM-5 [23] or Mg(Al)O oxide [8,24]."
          [4] "Additionally, it has been verified that the single Pt atom sites on Pt-Sn/γ-Al2O3 with a sandwich structure are more favorable for PDH reaction than Pt ensembles [25,26]."
          [5] "Gong et al. [15] also reported that the PtCu single atom alloys can enhance the propane conversion and propene selectivity simultaneously in PDH."
          [6] "Whether as promoters or supports, an important aim of using them is to obtain highly and stably dispersed Pt-based catalysts so that improving PDH performance."
          [7] "However, it is still difficult to break through these challenges for PDH reactions [27], and the exact Pt-M-support relationship is still unclear."
          [8] "Therefore, it is extremely necessary to find more efficient methods to solve the problems mentioned above."
          [9] "In fact, the hierarchical morphology and porous structure play important roles in many heterogeneous catalytic reactions. However, the effect of hierarchical microstructure is seldom reported."
          [10] "Given that the small Pt NPs and hierarchical microstructure may provide more stable and easily accessible active sites for PDH reaction, a promising design for obtaining the desired size of active Pt and hierarchical pore morphology was proposed."
          [11] "The promoted effects of HT reconstruction on the microstructure and morphology of the 3D oxide nanosheet array catalyst, and the subsequently superior PDH performance, were profoundly discussed."

Stable and selective catalysts for propane dehydrogenation operating at thermodynamic limit Hitting the limits on propene synthesis The greater abundance of propane from shale gas has spurred efforts to use it as a propylene feedstock. Direct dehydrogenation catalysts consisting of platinumtin alloy nanoparticles supported on alumina often must run with hydrogen dilution to avoid carbon buildup and excess tin to avoid alloy segregation.
          We report that silica-supported platinum-tin (Pt1Sn1) nanoparticles (&lt;2 nanometers in diameter) can operate as a PDH catalyst at thermodynamically limited conversion levels, with excellent stability and selectivity to propylene (&gt;99%). Atomic mixing of Pt and Sn in the precursor is preserved upon reduction and during catalytic operation. The benign interaction of these nanoparticles with the silicon dioxide support does not lead to Pt-Sn segregation and formation of a tin oxide phase that can occur over traditional catalyst supports.
          To alleviate this issue, large quantities of Sn are used in the catalyst preparation (the nominal atomic loading is Sn:Pt between 4 and 5), which increases the yield of intermetallic PtSn NPs (12). In addition, studies have shown that adding hydrogen to the reactant feed reduces the rate of catalyst deactivation (13). Although this strategy is implemented commercially (10), addition of hydrogen in the feed lowers the thermodynamic limit on per-pass propane conversion (fig. S1) and decreases productivity (7).
          We developed a PDH catalyst that operates at thermodynamically limited conversion levels without the addition of hydrogen to the feed and exhibits excellent stability and selectivity to propylene (&gt;99%). The catalyst is composed of silica-supported Pt1Sn1 NPs, synthesized and pretreated to ensure that the mixing of Pt and Sn is preserved during catalytic operation.
          The principle behind catalyst synthesis is to begin with a heterometallic Pt-Sn coordination complex in which Pt and Sn are in immediate contact, and this interaction is retained during the reduction and PDH reaction.
          The data in Fig. 1, A to C, were obtained with 16 vol % propane in helium. Propane streams are diluted in commercial operations to increase the limiting equilibrium conversion, which is higher at lower propane partial pressure (fig. S2), and to limit catalyst deactivation rates (7, 16, 17). This approach requires additional downstream separation units and limits process efficiency.
          The data in Fig. 1, A to C, show the performance of the Pt1Sn1/SiO2 catalyst (1 wt % Pt and 0.6 wt % Sn) for propane dehydrogenation at 580C, 16 vol % propane (with the remainder helium) and at a weight hourly space velocity (WHSV) of 4.7 hours1. Under these reaction conditions, the thermodynamic limit on propane conversion is 66.5% (fig. S2). The Pt1Sn1/SiO2 catalyst showed near-thermodynamic conversion of &gt;66% (Fig. 1A, red circles) and &gt;99% selectivity to propylene (Fig. 1B, red circles).
          The data in Fig. 1D show that, under these conditions, the propane conversion goes from 41 to 39% in 120 min. Under identical conditions, the other tested catalysts deactivate very rapidly to very low conversion, as illustrated for the commercial mimic. A transmission electron microscopy (TEM) image of the spent catalyst, after 120 min of PDH reaction, is shown in fig. S6. The image shows that the Pt-Sn NPs are well dispersed, with an average particle diameter of 1.6  0.67 nm, which is consistent with the particle size in fresh samples.
          We attempted to regenerate the Pt1Sn1/SiO2 catalyst by oxidation, using 1% O2 as a mild oxidant at 500C followed by reduction at 600C (see supplementary materials for details of the regeneration procedure). The regeneration studies showed that Pt1Sn1/SiO2 catalysts can be partially regenerated. For example, we measured 97% of the initial activity and &gt;99% of the initial selectivity after three PDH/regeneration cycles (fig. S5).
          Data in Fig. 3A show that the process of mixing chloroplatinic acid (H2PtCl6) and tin(II) chloride (SnCl2) in 0.1 M hydrochloric acid solution formed a heterometallic Pt-Sn coordination complex.
          A bright-field TEM image of Pt-Sn NPs formed on SiO2 upon the reduction of the Pt-Sn complex shows high metal dispersion on the support, with an average NP size of 1.3  0.6 nm (Fig. 3B). The NP size distribution (Fig. 3C) shows that most NPs were &lt;2 nm. The XRD spectra in Fig. 3D show that the formed NPs were essentially alloys of Pt and Sn. This finding is supported by the presence of the XRD peaks corresponding to Pt1Sn1 (41.8 and 44.1) and Pt3Sn1 (39.0 and 45.3) stoichiometries.
          The real-space Pt LIII EXAFS spectra for the Pt1Sn1/SiO2 catalyst (Fig. 4D) are substantially different from the spectra of monometallic Pt and indicate the mixing of Pt and Sn atoms. The best-fit spectrum for the Pt1Sn1/SiO2 catalyst is characterized by the presence of the Pt-Pt and Pt-Sn scattering paths, consistent with the formation of PtSn intermetallic phases.

          [3] "The stability and regenerability of Pt-Sn2/meso-Al2O3 are strongly dependent on the content of Al3+penta sites in the Al2O3 structure, and a high level of Al3+penta sites can effectively prevent the agglomeration of Pt-Sn2 clusters into large Pt nanoparticles in the consecutive dehydrogenation-regeneration cycles."

          [3] "The method works well when using easily reducible late transition metals, but Pt alloy formation with rare-earth elements through the H2 reduction route is almost impossible owing to the low chemical potential of rare-earth element oxides6."
          [4] "Here we use as support a mesoporous zeolite that has pore walls with surface framework defects (called silanol nests) and show that the zeolite enables alloy formation between Pt and rare-earth elements."
          [5] "We find that the silanol nests enable the rare-earth elements to exist as single atomic species with a substantially higher chemical potential compared with that of the bulk oxide, making it possible for them to diffuse onto Pt."
          [6] "High-resolution transmission electron microscopy and hydrogen chemisorption measurements indicate that the resultant bimetallic nanoparticles supported on the mesoporous zeolite are intermetallic compounds, which we find to be stable, highly active and selective catalysts for the propane dehydrogenation reaction."
          [7] "When used with late transition metals, the same preparation strategy produces Pt alloy catalysts that incorporate an unusually large amount of the second metal and, in the case of the PtCo alloy, show high catalytic activity and selectivity in the preferential oxidation of carbon monoxide in H2."

          [10] "The coke deposition also causes an undesirable loss of the catalytic selectivity to propylene."
          [11] "To alleviate these problems, Sn is introduced to form an alloy with Pt nanoparticles and thereby dilute the Pt surface with inactive Sn atoms and break up coke-generating Pt ensembles."
          [12] "Our search for a highly active and more durable PDH catalyst has focused on using a siliceous MFI zeolite with a hierarchical micro-/mesoporous structure as a replacement for the alumina support."

          [14] "The formation of the Pt3La and Pt3Y nanoparticles on the degallated zeolite brought a striking enhancement in all aspects of the PDH catalytic performance, including activity, selectivity and durability, as shown in Fig. 2."
          [15] "The catalytic reaction was performed at 580C using a pure propane flow at a large space velocity (see Methods), and these harsh operating conditions caused even the conventional PtSn/alumina catalyst to experience severe coke formation and catalyst deactivation within 1 d."
          [16] "In sharp contrast, the Pt3La intermetallic nanoparticles supported on the degallated zeolite (denoted as PtLa/mz-deGa, where mz stands for mesoporous zeolite) showed a high initial propane conversion of 40% (close to the equilibrium conversion) and underwent extremely slow deactivation, retaining 8% conversion even after 30 days of reaction."

[1] "Although the equilibrium conversion of alkanes increases with temperature, alkene selectivity decreases with increasing temperature and chain length due to an increased tendency toward dehydrocyclization/aromatisation, thermal cracking and coke formation."
          [2] "Direct dehydrogenation of lower alkanes is an energy intensive reaction; however, oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) has the potential to lower the energy requirement for achieving dehydrogenation."
          [3] "ODH can be considered as tandem endothermic (dehydrogenation, CnH2n + 2  CnH2n + H2) and exothermic (oxidation, H2 + O2  H2O) processes, with an overall thermodynamic summation, CnH2n + 2 + O2  CnH2n + H2O."
          [4] "Although the process is not thermo-neutral, part of the energy required for the endothermic reaction is augmented by the exothermic reaction."
          [5] "Thus, ODH of alkanes takes place at lower temperature compared to the corresponding non-ODH."
          [6] "This lower temperature requirement of ODH compared to non-ODH and cracking is encouraging and provides motivation for continued efforts to develop ODH into an industrial technology."
          [7] "Although ODH is attractive because of the energy intensification advantage, commercial ODH technologies hinge on innovative catalyst and process design, i.e. proper synergy of the endothermic dehydrogenation step with the exothermic hydrogen combustion and design of selective CH and hydrogen combustion catalysts."

          [14] "Lower alkanes are relatively inert, and they exhibit little or no reactivity at conditions typical for activating functional group reactions in organic compounds because they lack low-lying vacant orbitals or lone pair electrons."
          [15] "Alkanes are made up non-polar CC and CH bonds. These bonds consist of strongly localised electron pairs that are usually induced to reactivity under severe conditions (e.g., at high temperature or pressure, or with the use of aggressive reagents)."
          [16] "The first and rate-limiting step of alkane dehydrogenation using platinum or chromium oxide-based catalysts involves CH activation."
          [17] "Although a number of efforts have been made to gain insight on the mechanism of the reaction, questions still remain, especially regarding the pathway of the CH activation."
          [18] "It is of fundamental and applied interest to know whether the first CH bond cleavage is homolytic or heterolytic."
          [19] "If it is a heterolytic pathway, it will further be of interest to know whether the first hydrogen from the alkane substrate is abstracted as a proton or as a hydride ion."

          [34] "Wender et al. showed that 3040% of heat adsorption in n-alkanes on Na-zeolite is due to polarization of the adsorbates."

          [37] "Based on charge density considerations, Mg2 + cations are expected to exhibit a stronger polarizing effect than Ca2 + cations."
          [38] "Subbotina et al. explain that because of the smaller ionic radius of Mg2 +, it is more strongly shielded by the surrounding oxygen atoms of the zeolite lattice than a Ca2 + ion, thereby reducing the polarizing effect of Mg2 + on the hydrocarbon adsorbate."
          [39] "Sievers et al. also report that the La3 + form of X zeolite induces strong polarization of adsorbed alkane molecules; partial positive charges were induced on secondary and tertiary carbon atoms of alkane molecules."
          [40] "The authors suggest that the polarization may be viewed as an intermediate condition to hydride abstraction (which is an important elementary step in CH activation)."

          [43] "Alkane polarization studies on Na+, Mg2 +, Ca2 +, and La3 + exchanged X-zeolites indicate that the polarizing effect increases with increasing charge magnitude and ionic radius."
          [44] "Note that these alkane polarizing cations occupy the same position on the zeolites as the well-known CH activation cations/metals, and thus the CH polarizing effect has a complementary effect on CH activation."
          [45] "This may add to the number of relevant variables and increase the challenge of optimizing the ratio of activation/polarizing cations among exchangeable sites (Si/Al ratio), as well as the sequence for incorporating the cations or metals during catalyst preparation."
          [46] "Further, it is important to note that the choice of cations should be such that they exhibit no catalytic (oligomerization, isomerization, aromatisation or oxidation) effects on the target alkene products at the reaction condition."
          [47] "Furthermore, it may be beneficial to create a CH polarization effect on the zeolite framework."

          [53] "However, despite the decades of intensive investigations on the subject, the actual mechanism of CH activation on acid zeolite is still debated."
          [54] "Two CH activation paths are generally recognized: the unimolecular/protolytic mechanism and the bimolecular/carbenium chain mechanism."
          [55] "The unimolecular mechanism involves direct protonation of an alkane-forming carbonium ion intermediate."
          [56] "The proton can be inserted into either a CC or CH bond of the alkane."
          [57] "Proton insertion through the CC bond leads to cracking of the alkane, with the acid site regenerated."
          [58] "Insertion through the HC bond yields H2 and a carbenium ion/alkoxide intermediate."
          [59] "Desorption of alkene from the intermediate regenerates the acid, or the alkoxide can enter the bimolecular conversion path."
          [60] "In the bimolecular mechanism of CH activation, the alkoxide intermediate constitutes the active sites and CH activation occurs through hydride transfer from a second alkane molecule forming another alkoxide."
          [61] "This may be followed by βscission to regenerate the active site and complete the catalytic cycle."
          [62] "For example, activation of propane on acid zeolite based on the two mechanisms is illustrated in Scheme 1."
          [63] "Low reactant partial pressure and high temperature favor unimolecular dehydrogenation of alkane on acid zeolite."
          [64] "These conditions favor the endothermic desorption step (rate limiting step) leading to propene."
          [65] "In contrast, high partial pressure and low temperature favor the bimolecular mechanism leading to a low propene yield."
          [66] "The two molecular mechanisms devoid of side reactions give fairly predictable product distribution."
          [67] "However, the products of each route are prone to side reactions (dimerization, oligomerization, isomerization & aromatisation) in the presence of Bronsted acid sites."
          [68] "Hence propene selectivity on acidic zeolite is very low and products rich in aromatics are usually obtained."
          [69] "The active sites (alkoxide intermediate) of the bimolecular pathway are formed in situ."
          [70] "The alkoxide intermediate is made up of an alkyl carbenium ion ionically held to the zeolite framework oxygen ion."
          [71] "The active sites of the unimolecular pathway are the charge balancing protons of the zeolite framework."
          [72] "A proton and a carbenium ion are an electrophilic or Lewis acid species (a proton can also be considered as a special case of Lewis acidity)."
          [73] "The two pathways essentially involve electrophilic CH activation."
          [74] "The electrophiles (proton and carbenium ion) activate CH at high temperatures (500 C), giving low conversion rates of light alkanes and poor selectivity to corresponding alkenes."
          [75] "Iglesia and co-workers used isotopic labeling studies to demonstrate that CH activation is not the rate-limiting step in the dehydrogenation of propane on H-ZSM-5 and Ga/H-ZSM-5."
          [76] "They proposed that the CH bond cleavage produces an H-adatom and an alkoxide intermediate."
          [77] "Desorption of an alkene from the alkoxide regenerates the proton sites on the zeolites."
          [78] "An alkoxide intermediate may also discharge as a hydrogen rich species through cracking."
          [79] "Iglesia et al. proposed that desorption or disposal of the H-adatom from the CH bond cleavage is the rate-limiting step."
          [80] "A similar deduction was reached by Yu et al."
          [81] "who found that desorption of the alkoxides intermediate is the rate-limiting step under conditions that favor the unimolecular mechanism."
          [82] "The above proposition has been demonstrated on metal (e.g., Ga, Zn, and Co) exchanged zeolites."
          [83] "The specific role of the exchanged metals has been the subject of several reports with special attention on Ga and Zn."
          [84] "Although the framework Ga2O3 on H-MFI seems to have a CH polarization effect on desorbed methane, Ga2O3 exhibits lower CH activation activity."
          [85] "The physical mixture of Ga2O3/HMFI displays higher propane aromatisation activity than pure H-MFI."
          [86] "Similar synergistic effects have been reported for Zn/H-MFI and Co/H-MFI."
          [87] "Exchanged cations behave as monomeric species at the exchange sites of zeolite."
          [88] "Iglesia and Biscardi hypothesized that the monomeric species enhance propane conversion by promoting re-combinative desorption (RD) of the H-adatom formed from the CH cleavage."
          [89] "It is worthwhile noting that the exchange cations (electrophilic species) constitute the CH activation sites."
          [90] "Hence, more insights are required about their additional role in promoting RD."
          [91] "However, the authors did not provide further information on the nature of the H-adatoms and the mechanism of RD."
          [92] "In the next section, we examine the mechanism of desorption of H-adatoms over Ga and Zn exchanged H-ZSM-5."
          [93] "The exchanged metal ions in zeolites are held ionically by one or more basic oxygen atoms."
          [94] "Different species have been suggested, depending on the density of the cation exchange site of the zeolite and method of introduction of the metals."
          [95] "According to Kanansky et al."
          [96] "the exchanged Zn and Ga species on H-ZSM-5 and their mechanism of CH activation are distinctively different."
          [97] "Zn and Ga are introduced on H-ZSM-5 through a vapor deposition technique using Zn metal vapor and Ga(CH3)3 as the source of Zn and Ga, respectively."
          [98] "The metal introduction technique allows quantitative exchange of the zeolite protons which leads to Zn/Al = 0.5 and Ga/Al = 1, respectively."
          [99] "Zn2 + is generated directly, but Ga+ is produced by H2 treatment at 500 C to release the methyl groups."
          [100] "The proposed active sites are OZn2+O and OGa+, respectively."
          [101] "The mechanism of CH activation with ethane by the two sites under the same reaction conditions are summarized in Scheme 2."
          [102] "The proposed mechanism is in agreement with the mechanism suggested from calculations using the GAUSSIAN 94 program for ethane activation on Zn-exchanged zeolite by Frash and van Santen."
          [103] "In another theoretical study using a DFT cluster modeling approach, Pidko and van Santen compared the activation energy of CH with three types of Zn species at active sites: OZn2+O, OZn+OZn+O and HOZn+ O."
          [104] "The authors suggest that the reaction proceeds most easily on OZn2+O, and hypothesize that the enhanced Lewis activity of OZn2+O facilitates CH heterolytic cleavage."
          [105] "They further argue that the first proton abstraction occurs preferentially on the oxygen sites neighboring the ring where the cation is located."
          [106] "They proposed a one-step reaction to yield H2 and C2H4 from the decomposition of the Zn-alkyl and proton."
          [107] "A proposed mechanism of CH activation on OGa+ has similarly been suggested using theoretical calculations."
          [108] "High alkene selectivities are obtained on the H-ZSM-5 when exchangeable protons are rigorously replaced by Zn and Ga."
          [109] "The Zn-exchanged H-ZSM-5 had higher ethane conversion rates but lower ethene selectivity than its Ga counterpart."
          [110] "The CH activation on the OZn2+O site can be described by a Lewis base-assisted deprotonation mechanism."
          [111] "This is accompanied by conversion of the Lewis base site to a conjugate Bronsted acid site."
          [112] "The OGa+ site, however, activates the CH bond via oxidative addition without a protonic site intermediate."
          [113] "A protonic site intermediate increases tendency of side reactions on the Zn-exchanged H-ZSM-5 relative to the Ga counterpart."
          [114] "The elementary steps of CH activation on OGa+ (Scheme 2) reveal that a redox cycle at the metal center is required for catalytic CH activation via the oxidative addition mechanism."
          [115] "A redox cycle is not apparent in the elementary step presented for CH activation on OZn2+O."
          [116] "Hence, a redox cycle is not a requisite for CH activation via the Lewis base-assisted deprotonation mechanism."
          [117] "However, under alkane dehydrogenation reaction conditions, the OZn2+O sites can undergo a reversible Zn2 +/Zn redox process."
          [118] "This redox process increases the availability of undesired protonic site intermediates."
          [119] "Zn-exchanged H-ZSM-5 prepared by conventional ion-exchange methods contain a significant percentage of unexchanged proton sites leading to lower alkene selectivity of the catalyst."
          [120] "Iglesia and Biscardi titrate the proton sites with NaOH."
          [121] "The un-titrated and the titrated catalysts are denoted as Zn/H-ZSMS-5 and Zn/Na-ZSMS-5, respectively."
          [122] "Zn/Na-ZSM-5 has four times the propane conversion rate and a higher propene selectivity than Zn/H-ZSMS-5."
          [123] "The propene formation rate obtained with Zn/Na-ZSM-5 was ten times that of Zn/H-ZSMS-5."
          [124] "The zinc species at the cation exchange site of the zeolite was identified as OZn+OH."
          [125] "The higher propene selectivity obtained on Zn/Na-ZSM-5 compared to Zn/H-ZSMS-5 is presumably from the lower density and availability of proton sites on Zn/Na-ZSM-5."
          [126] "The improved propane conversion rate of Zn/Na-ZSM-5 compared to Zn/H-ZSM-5 is attributable to the higher efficiency of OZn+OH sites in catalyzing desorption of H-adatoms than OZn2+O sites."
          [127] "Another strategy to enhance alkene selectivity is by controlling the strength of the proton sites."
          [128] "The acidity of the sites depends on the nature of the trivalent cation of the zeolite framework."
          [129] "Proton sites in borosilicate zeolites are weaker than those of aluminosilicate, and thus higher alkene selectivity is expected for alkane dehydrogenation over Zn/H[B]-ZSM-5 compared to Zn/H[Al]-ZSM-5."
          [130] "However, Zn/H[B]-ZSM-5 shows no activity for propane dehydrogenation."
          [131] "The desired weaker acidity of the proton sites of Zn/H[B]-ZSM-5 requires weaker basicity of the oxygen atoms in the zeolite framework."
          [132] "This reduced basicity of the oxygen atoms is not sufficiently polarizing to complement the exchanged Zn2 + in CH bond cleavage."
          [133] "In the next section, we examine use of zeolite support to design a Pt-based alkane dehydrogenation catalyst."
          [134] "Elimination of the proton sites of zeolites is critical for obtaining a high alkene selectivity and stability in dehydrogenation catalysts."
          [135] "Pt is the most versatile noble metal catalyst for alkane reactions."
          [136] "Although Pt is expensive, the choice of Pt is often justified by its higher activity, stability and selectivity for these reactions compared to less expensive alternative transition metals."
          [137] "However, rapid catalyst deactivation due to coke formation remains a challenge even when using a Pt-based catalyst for dehydrogenation of light alkanes."
          [138] "Waku et al."
          [139] "exploited the unique property of zeolite as a support for achieving high metal dispersion through cation exchange sites to create a Pt/Na[Fe]-ZSM-5 catalyst with outstanding stability for dehydrogenation of light alkanes."
          [140] "They found that the catalyst deactivation rate of Pt/Na[Fe]-ZSM-5 was lower than for any other Pt-based catalysts in refractory oxide support."
          [141] "The unprecedented performance of Pt/Na[Fe]-ZSM-5 was attributed to its high Pt dispersion (cluster size < 1 mm) on zeolite through ion-exchange."
          [142] "There is a tendency to generate some Brnsted protons on the zeolite during the exchange process, but the choice of Fe3 + as an isomorphous cation in place of Al3 + led to weaker Brnsted sites in [Fe]-ZSM compared to [Al]-ZSM."
          [143] "The weaker acidity minimizes the tendency of side reactions (cracking of oligomerization, aromatisation, and coke), which translates into higher alkene selectivity and catalyst stability."
          [144] "In another report, Xuebing and Iglesia demonstrated the ability of Pt/Na[Fe]-ZSM-5 to dehydrogenate alkanes longer than C4; n-pentane and n-heptane were selectively converted to n-pentene and n-heptene, respectively."
          [145] "Alkene selectivity was also improved when the residual proton generated during Pt exchange or Na-[Fe]-ZSM was titrated with Cs."
          [146] "Although Pt with conventional refractory oxides (Al2O3, SiO2, ZrO2, etc.) used for dehydrogenation of alkanes has similar conversion rates to Pt/Na[Fe]-ZSM-5, deactivation rates are also rapid due to coke formation."
          [147] "The presence of acid (Bronsted and Lewis) sites on the supports promotes readsorption, oligomerization and aromatisation of alkenes."
          [148] "Promotion of Pt with metals, such as Sn, Ga, Zn, Re, etc., improves catalyst stability, but also leads to faster deactivation rates than Pt/Na[Fe]-ZSM-5."
          [149] "However, recent reports by Bell et al."
          [150] "show that the use of calcined hydrotalcite (Al/Mg  0.1) supported on bimetallic PtGa or PtSn gave very high alkene selectivity and stability, comparable to Pt/Na[Fe]-ZSM-5."
          [151] "At this stage, we can conclude that differences in the performance of Zn and Ga exchanged H-ZSM-5 obtained by Kanansky et al."
          [152] "are attributable to their respective CH activation mechanisms."
          [153] "In addition, the role of exchanged Zn and Ga as promoters of RD becomes evident from the mechanisms (Scheme 2)."
          [154] "The RD mechanism on Ga exchanged H-ZSM-5 is by reductive elimination of a hydrogen molecule from O[Ga(H)2]+ intermediate."
          [155] "Decomposition of ZnR and a protonic site, or neutralization of the proton sites by ZnH, leads to desorption of the hydrogen molecule on the Zn-exchanged H-ZSM-5."
          [156] "By extrapolation, the mechanisms of CH activation on exchanged Zn and Ga H-ZSM-5 can described the mechanism of alkane dehydrogenation on Cr-based and Pt-based catalysts respectively."
          [157] "The electronic promotion effect of Sn is in line with the oxidative addition CH activation mechanism."
          [158] "However, the Lewis base-assisted deprotonation mechanism could also explain the proposed CH activation on Cr-based catalysts."
          [159] "Now, the nature and the role of surface oxygen species become more evident."
          [160] "The role of potassium in commercial Cr and Pt-based dehydrogenation catalysts is to minimize the undesired influence of protonic sites on alkene selectivity."
          [161] "The highlights in this section are presented in Table 2."
          [162] "The table reveals the insights achieved on the reaction mechanism, alkene selectivity and catalyst stability for non-oxidative dehydrogenation of lower alkanes."
          [163] "Nonetheless, the level of catalyst activity is still far from acceptable, even at high temperature."
          [164] "A recent report by Rothenberg et al."
          [165] "provides a lead in this respect."
          [166] "Their report indicates that a porous copperaluminum framework material (stabilized by metal oxide) has better performance (activity/selectivity/stability) for propane dehydrogenation than a PtSn/Al2O3."
          [167] "Of particular interest, is the suggestion that achieving propane dehydrogenation at 350 C may be possible."
          [168] "Few details are known about the structure of the porous copperaluminum framework material."
          [169] "However, copper is implicated as providing the active sites for the catalysis."
          [170] "Also, that the material activated in oxygen gave higher propane conversion rates than those activated in inert gas atmosphere underscores the role of the surface oxide (oxygen species) in the catalysis."
          [171] "Thus, the Lewis base-assisted deprotonation mechanism may be invoked here, and the redox property of the metal center is likely to play a role in achieving propane dehydrogenation at 350 C."
          [172] "This should constitute the future research direction for non-oxidative dehydrogenation of lower alkanes."
          [173] "Although the equilibrium conversion of alkanes increases with temperature, alkene selectivity decreases with increasing temperature and chain length due to an increased tendency toward dehydrocyclization/aromatisation, thermal cracking and coke formation."
          [174] "Direct dehydrogenation of lower alkanes is an energy intensive reaction; however, oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) has the potential to lower the energy requirement for achieving dehydrogenation."
          [175] "ODH can be considered as tandem endothermic (dehydrogenation, CnH2n + 2  CnH2n + H2) and exothermic (oxidation, H2 + O2  H2O) processes, with an overall thermodynamic summation, CnH2n + 2 + O2  CnH2n + H2O."
          [176] "Although the process is not thermo-neutral, part of the energy required for the endothermic reaction is augmented by the exothermic reaction."
          [177] "Thus, ODH of alkanes takes place at lower temperature compared to the corresponding non-ODH."
          [178] "This lower temperature requirement of ODH compared to non-ODH and cracking is encouraging and provides motivation for continued efforts to develop ODH into an industrial technology."
          [179] "Although ODH is attractive because of the energy intensification advantage, commercial ODH technologies hinge on innovative catalyst and process design, i.e. proper synergy of the endothermic dehydrogenation step with the exothermic hydrogen combustion and design of selective CH and hydrogen combustion catalysts."
          [180] "In this report, we provide an overview on CH activation and reaction routes to alkane dehydrogenation."
          [181] "We seek to gain insights about components of the active sites of CH activation to provide a platform for rational design of new efficient catalysts for dehydrogenation of lower alkanes."
          [182] "We focus on propane dehydrogenation because of the need for alternative and/or complementary technology for propene production to supplement existing technologies."
          [183] "We survey non-oxidative and oxidative dehydrogenation approaches, and examine reaction routes that are intermediate between these two main approaches."
          [184] "Although the equilibrium conversion of alkanes increases with temperature, alkene selectivity decreases with increasing temperature and chain length due to an increased tendency toward dehydrocyclization/aromatisation, thermal cracking and coke formation."

[1] "Although there are other metallic reforming catalysts such as Ru and Rh, which are less strongly prone to coking than Ni,129 Ni is one of the most common reforming catalysts, which is partly due to its significantly cheaper price. In order to overcome the coking problem of Ni catalysts, numerous theoretical studies have been conducted to understand the coke formation on nickel and to come up with potential strategies to avoid the unwanted coking process."
          [2] "It could be shown that the adsorption of C atoms on the closed packed surface of a NiAu surface alloy is thermodynamically less favoured, by 23 kJ mol1 or more, than the analogous process on a pure Ni(111) surface.134 Based on this finding, it has been proposed to alloy Ni with Au.134 A cheaper alternative is to alloy Ni with Sn which hinders the CC bond formation and enhances the CO bond formation leading to the removal of surface C centers as carbon monoxide.135,136 It has been discussed that the Sn atoms separate the Ni centers on the catalyst surface, which tend to bind C atoms, from each other. With the Ni centers being separated, the C atoms on the surface are separated as well, which hinders the formation of coke.135,136 These theoretical results are consistent with experiments which show that pure Ni catalysts deactivate significantly faster than NiSn alloy based catalysts.135 Since the step sites play an essential role in the growth of the graphene islands, as mentioned above, additives such as potassium,66 sulfur,66 gold66 or boron131 have been proposed.66 Computational calculations have shown that these elements tend to occupy the step sites and thus avoid the formation of graphene islands.66,131 A similar strategy, by blocking the crucial sites, has been proposed to prevent the formation of a carbidic phase. Calculations have shown that boron prefers the same sub-surface sites on Ni as C.137 By occupying these sites with B, the diffusion of C to these sub-surface sites and the formation of the thermodynamically more stable carbide phase can be prevented.128 Apart from blocking the sub-surface sites, sub-surface boron in Ni(111) also has been shown to have an destabilizing effect on on-surface C centers,138 which may help to prevent the accumulation of C atoms on the surface."
          [3] "Although supported Pt catalysts show high activity, the catalyst deactivation due to coke formation remains a challenging issue."
          [4] "The robustness against coking can be increased with additional promoters, such as late transition metals, main-group metals including Sn and Ga, alkali-metal oxides and rare-earth metal oxides."
          [5] "It has been demonstrated for graphene islands on the Ni(111) surface, unsaturated C atoms at the edge of a graphene island are less stable than isolated C atoms on the metal surface."
          [6] "A cheaper alternative is to alloy Ni with Sn which hinders the CC bond formation and enhances the CO bond formation leading to the removal of surface C centers as carbon monoxide."
          [7] "Since the step sites play an essential role in the growth of the graphene islands, as mentioned above, additives such as potassium, sulfur, gold or boron have been proposed."
          [8] "Apart from blocking the sub-surface sites, sub-surface boron in Ni(111) also has been shown to have an destabilizing effect on on-surface C centers, which may help to prevent the accumulation of C atoms on the surface."

[1] "A catalyst design consisting of the double-decoration of nanoparticulate intermetallic PtGa with Pb and Ca was applied to produce an ultra-stable catalyst for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) at a high temperature."
          [2] "PtGaCaPb/SiO2 exhibited outstanding catalytic stability in PDH at 600C, and almost no deactivation was observed for up to 1month."
          [3] "Herein, we report a novel catalyst design concept, namely, the double decoration of PtGa intermetallics by Pb and Ca, which synergize the geometric and electronic promotion effects on the catalyst stability, respectively."
          [4] "Pb is deposited on the three-fold Pt3 sites of the PtGa nanoparticles to block them, whereas Ca, which affords an electron-enriched single-atom-like Pt1 site, is placed around the nanoparticles."
          [5] "Thus, PtGaCaPb/SiO2 exhibits an outstandingly high catalytic stability, even at 600C (kd=0.00033h1, τ=3067h), and almost no deactivation of the catalyst was observed for up to 1month for the first time."

[1] "To expose the loaded Pt on the surface of the carriers, ion exchange and impregnation are two simple and practical methods. The dispersion of Pt mainly depends on the precursors of Pt, the preparation conditions, the properties of the carriers, and the interaction between Pt and the carriers, as well as the additives."
          [2] "The addition of a second metal has been found to be highly effective for the sintering resistance of Pt particles. The introduced metal forms alloys with Pt around Pt particles,63 and the alloys anchor them on the surface of the carriers, making them not easy to migrate and coalesce."
          [3] "The application of the carriers possessing a strong interaction with Pt is another way to retard the sintering. Al2O3 is the most common carrier of Pt catalyst, in which the coordinatively unsaturated pentacoordinate Al3+ can anchor Pt to make it not easy to migrate."
          [4] "Nanocarbon was also reported as the carrier of Pt to improve the sintering resistance, and the strong metalcarrier interaction leads to the electron transfer from nanocarbon to the Pt particles, significantly preventing the sintering of Pt."
          [5] "MgAl2O4 spinel is also a good choice as the carrier. Generally, Pt is not directly loaded on MgAl2O4 spinel prepared beforehand, but firstly loaded into the spaces between the layers of MgAlOx hydrotalcite, and then Pt particles are enclosed in the interspace of MgAl2O4 spinel formed through the collapse of the layered structure of the hydrotalcite after calcination at high temperature."
          [6] "Moliner et al.67 reported effective methods to encapsulate Pt in highly siliceous chabazite, and the catalyst showed enhanced stability towards Pt sintering even at 650750 C in the atmospheres of H2, O2 and H2O."
          [7] "The Al2O3 overcoat has also proved to be efficient in preventing the sintering of Pt nanoparticles through atomic layer deposition."
          [8] "Tanabe et al. revealed that no Pt sintering was observed for Pt/MgO as an automotive exhaust catalyst after calcination in air at 900 C, for the formation of a Mg2PtO4-like compound prevents the migration of Pt."
          [9] "Nagai et al. found that CeO2 had a similar effect of MgO in preventing the sintering of Pt due to the formation of the PtOCe bond in the Pt/CeO2 catalyst."
          [10] "Recently, Pt supported on CeO2 has attracted more attention because of the ability of CeO2 to trap Pt in an atomically dispersed state."
          [11] "The atomically dispersed Pt is most likely to be present in the form of Pt2+ bonded to the ubiquitous step edges of the CeO2 surface."
          [12] "The addition of Ga, In, Zn, Cu, Ir, Co to Pt catalysts exhibits similar effects as Sn."
          [13] "Not only that, but Sattler et al.84 showed that in the highly active, selective and stable PtGaK/Al2O3 (0.1 wt% Pt, 3 wt% Ga, 0.25 wt% K) catalyst for the dehydrogenation of propane, the coordinately unsaturated Ga3+ is responsible for activating the CH bond, and Pt only acts as a promoter."
          [14] "Furthermore, just like the PtSn/CeO2 catalyst,29 the reactivity can be fully recovered via simple coke burning in air, although the sintering of Pt still occurs."
          [15] "Located at the same main group with Ga, In was also reported to be the promoter of supported Pt catalysts. The PtIn/Mg(Al)O catalyst prepared at pH 8 using the co-precipitation method exhibits the best catalytic performance and the strongest interaction between the metal phase and the carrier."
          [16] "B and Si, two nonmetal elements, can play similar roles, too. Dehydrogenation of n-butane over the PtB/SiO2 catalyst showed improved catalytic activity and stability compared with Pt/SiO2."
          [17] "Dadras et al.86 called B a magic bullet against sintering and coking, and they summarized the positive roles of B as follows. The non-stoichiometric PtB cluster is anchored to the carrier via a covalent BO bond, which is much stronger than the interaction between Pt clusters and the carrier surface."
          [18] "Additionally, the dissociation energy of a Pt atom from a PtB cluster is significantly larger than that from the pure Pt cluster, increasing the sintering resistance."
          [19] "Finally, the affinity of PtB cluster to C also drops dramatically, leading to the reduced coke formation and increased selectivity to olefins."
          [20] "It is predicted by a computational screening of main-group elements as potential additives for the Pt catalyst that Si, just as B, can modify the selectivity of the Pt catalyst by changing both electronic and geometric properties."

[1] "In this review, we outline the progress of these dehydrogenation catalysts that have been mainly developed in the past five years. For different classes of the most-promising catalysts in the selective dehydrogenation of ethane-to-ethylene and propane-to-propylene, their syntheses, structural information, catalytic properties and mechanisms are comparatively summarized."
          [2] "The synthesis parameters influence the metal particle size for the as-obtained Pt-based catalysts."
          [3] "The synthesis approach can also be applied to tailor the size and phase of bimetallic nanoparticles."
          [4] "The synthesis parameters influence the metal particle size for the as-obtained Pt-based catalysts."
          [5] "The synthesis chemistry contributes to the stabilization effect of Pt through strong PtOCe bonds."
          [6] "The synthesis strategy has been reported for the zeolite-confined Pt single-atom and nanocluter catalysts with high stability."
          [7] "The synthesis procedure can maintain the porous texture and anchor the active Pt-based metals."
          [8] "The synthesis method is used to prepare uniform PtIn bimetal nanoparticles."
          [9] "The synthesis approach is used to prepare the well-defined surface metal species by employing the single-site metal precursors."

          [11] "The synthesis procedure can achieve the formation of the Sn single-site located in the frameworks."
          [12] "The synthesis method allows it to serve as a potent ion-exchanger, resulting in the stabilization of the highly dispersed bimetallic PtZn sites by the ETS-2 support."

[1] "To improve the stability of Pt-based catalysts, many efforts have been dedicated to strengthen metalsupport interactions by using various methods including the nanopore-encaged metal strategy,2124 wet-chemistry approach2529 and modification of supports.10,11,30,31 Among them, modification of supports is a relatively effective and simple method to improve the stability of Pt-based catalysts."
          [2] "For example, Lu et al. reported a PtSn/Al2O3 sheet catalyst for PDH, exhibiting high activity, selectivity and stability.11 It was proposed that the enhanced stability in PDH was associated with γ-Al2O3 nanosheets containing a great deal of pentacoordinate Al3+ ions, which can stabilize PtSn clusters by strong interactions between metals and supports."
          [3] "Recent work by Ma et al. showed that the addition of Ga into Mg(Al)O layer double hydrotalcites could greatly enhance the stability of Pt catalysts in PDH.10 It may be due to the fact that pentacoordinate Ga3+ ions could disperse and stabilize PtSn clusters, thereby enhancing the electronic interactions between Pt and Ga."
          [4] "A similar conclusion regarding the importance of modification of supports has been reported in the case of PtSn/CeO2 catalysts.30"
          [5] "Therefore, this provides a way to tune and enhance the catalytic activity and selectivity for the PDH process, and also introduces unique stability characteristics for bimetallic systems."
          [6] "Herein, highly stable Pt/Sn-Si-beta catalysts for PDH were prepared by an improved post-synthesis strategy, which consists of dealumination of H-beta and subsequent metal impregnation."
          [7] "It is indicated that Sn species existing in tetrahedral coordination states were incorporated into the framework of dealuminated beta (Si-beta)."
          [8] "Meanwhile, Pt species were highly dispersed in the form of ultra-small nanoclusters on Pt/Sn-Si-beta due to the strong interaction between Pt and Sn(IV) sites confined in the Si-beta framework."
          [9] "The prepared Pt/Sn-Si-beta catalysts show excellent catalytic performance for PDH, in which the propene formation rate was 2.3 mol g1Pt h1 with a propene selectivity of >99% at 550 C and the higher propene formation rate was 3.1 mol g1Pt h1 at 600 C."
          [10] "Moreover, the strong PtSn interactions and the confinement effect of Sn in the Si-beta framework inhibit the coke and sintering of Pt clusters, thereby achieving good stability of dehydrogenation and regeneration with almost unchanged catalytic activity during four cycles at 550 C."



[1] "Although the direct dehydrogenation technique has been industrialized, the fabrication of the corresponding catalysts is still confronted with a series of plights."

          [6] "Metallic Pt has already been recognized as an effective catalyst for alkane dehydrogenation reactions due to its high affinity for paraffinic CH bonds."
          [7] "Currently, adding metal promoters to form alloys or intermetallic compounds is one of the most effective methods to ameliorate central active components and inhibit catalytic deactivation in Pt-based catalytic systems."
          [8] "Sn is a widely utilized promoter for Pt catalysts."
          [9] "The PtGa catalyst system has also been implemented in production plants (FCDh technique)."
          [10] "In has also been developed as a promising promoter of Pt-based catalysts."
          [11] "Zn is another analogous but economical promoter for Pt-based catalysts."
          [12] "Many other metals, including Fe, Cu, and Co, can also be promoters for Pt-based catalysts to adjust the electronic properties and improve the dispersion of Pt atoms for further stability enhancement."
          [13] "Alloying of Pt with rare-earth elements (REEs) has barely been accomplished through the conventional H2 reduction route due to the low chemical potential of REE oxides."
          [14] "Supported metal oxide-based catalysts, including CoOx-, ZnOx-, VOx-, and CrOx-based catalysts, are other important PDH catalysts and have been extensively studied for decades."
          [15] "Introducing another metal oxide to form an oxide compound is an effective approach to improve the dispersion of active species and enhance the catalytic stability under the applied conditions, showing advantages in modifying the coordination and electronic state of host metal oxide sites."
          [16] "The introduction of an appropriate metal oxide or noble metal into a catalytic system can greatly enhance the catalytic performance."



[1] "Extensive research efforts have been made to inhibit deactivation and improve propene selectivity of Pt-based catalysts by doping promoters of Sn [9,10], In [11,12], Ga [13,14] and Cu [15] to form bimetallic catalysts."
          [2] "For example, PtIn [16] and PtGa [17,18] bimetallic nanoparticles (NPs) supported on calcined hydrotalcites (HT) show higher activity and selectivity in PDH, which has been attributed to the increased Pt dispersion and electron transfer from In or Ga to Pt [11,18]."
          [3] "Besides promoters, another method is to modify Al2O3 support with ZnO [19], La2O3 [20] or TiO2 [21] or replace Al2O3 support with ZnAl2O4 [22], ZSM-5 [23] or Mg(Al)O oxide [8,24]."
          [4] "Additionally, it has been verified that the single Pt atom sites on Pt-Sn/γ-Al2O3 with a sandwich structure are more favorable for PDH reaction than Pt ensembles [25,26]."
          [5] "Gong et al. [15] also reported that the PtCu single atom alloys can enhance the propane conversion and propene selectivity simultaneously in PDH."
          [6] "Whether as promoters or supports, an important aim of using them is to obtain highly and stably dispersed Pt-based catalysts so that improving PDH performance."
          [7] "However, it is still difficult to break through these challenges for PDH reactions [27], and the exact Pt-M-support relationship is still unclear."
          [8] "Therefore, it is extremely necessary to find more efficient methods to solve the problems mentioned above."
          [9] "In fact, the hierarchical morphology and porous structure play important roles in many heterogeneous catalytic reactions. However, the effect of hierarchical microstructure is seldom reported."
          [10] "Given that the small Pt NPs and hierarchical microstructure may provide more stable and easily accessible active sites for PDH reaction, a promising design for obtaining the desired size of active Pt and hierarchical pore morphology was proposed."
          [11] "The promoted effects of HT reconstruction on the microstructure and morphology of the 3D oxide nanosheet array catalyst, and the subsequently superior PDH performance, were profoundly discussed."

Stable and selective catalysts for propane dehydrogenation operating at thermodynamic limit Hitting the limits on propene synthesis The greater abundance of propane from shale gas has spurred efforts to use it as a propylene feedstock. Direct dehydrogenation catalysts consisting of platinumtin alloy nanoparticles supported on alumina often must run with hydrogen dilution to avoid carbon buildup and excess tin to avoid alloy segregation.
          We report that silica-supported platinum-tin (Pt1Sn1) nanoparticles (&lt;2 nanometers in diameter) can operate as a PDH catalyst at thermodynamically limited conversion levels, with excellent stability and selectivity to propylene (&gt;99%). Atomic mixing of Pt and Sn in the precursor is preserved upon reduction and during catalytic operation. The benign interaction of these nanoparticles with the silicon dioxide support does not lead to Pt-Sn segregation and formation of a tin oxide phase that can occur over traditional catalyst supports.
          To alleviate this issue, large quantities of Sn are used in the catalyst preparation (the nominal atomic loading is Sn:Pt between 4 and 5), which increases the yield of intermetallic PtSn NPs (12). In addition, studies have shown that adding hydrogen to the reactant feed reduces the rate of catalyst deactivation (13). Although this strategy is implemented commercially (10), addition of hydrogen in the feed lowers the thermodynamic limit on per-pass propane conversion (fig. S1) and decreases productivity (7).
          We developed a PDH catalyst that operates at thermodynamically limited conversion levels without the addition of hydrogen to the feed and exhibits excellent stability and selectivity to propylene (&gt;99%). The catalyst is composed of silica-supported Pt1Sn1 NPs, synthesized and pretreated to ensure that the mixing of Pt and Sn is preserved during catalytic operation.
          The principle behind catalyst synthesis is to begin with a heterometallic Pt-Sn coordination complex in which Pt and Sn are in immediate contact, and this interaction is retained during the reduction and PDH reaction.
          The data in Fig. 1, A to C, were obtained with 16 vol % propane in helium. Propane streams are diluted in commercial operations to increase the limiting equilibrium conversion, which is higher at lower propane partial pressure (fig. S2), and to limit catalyst deactivation rates (7, 16, 17). This approach requires additional downstream separation units and limits process efficiency.
          The data in Fig. 1, A to C, show the performance of the Pt1Sn1/SiO2 catalyst (1 wt % Pt and 0.6 wt % Sn) for propane dehydrogenation at 580C, 16 vol % propane (with the remainder helium) and at a weight hourly space velocity (WHSV) of 4.7 hours1. Under these reaction conditions, the thermodynamic limit on propane conversion is 66.5% (fig. S2). The Pt1Sn1/SiO2 catalyst showed near-thermodynamic conversion of &gt;66% (Fig. 1A, red circles) and &gt;99% selectivity to propylene (Fig. 1B, red circles).
          The data in Fig. 1D show that, under these conditions, the propane conversion goes from 41 to 39% in 120 min. Under identical conditions, the other tested catalysts deactivate very rapidly to very low conversion, as illustrated for the commercial mimic. A transmission electron microscopy (TEM) image of the spent catalyst, after 120 min of PDH reaction, is shown in fig. S6. The image shows that the Pt-Sn NPs are well dispersed, with an average particle diameter of 1.6  0.67 nm, which is consistent with the particle size in fresh samples.
          We attempted to regenerate the Pt1Sn1/SiO2 catalyst by oxidation, using 1% O2 as a mild oxidant at 500C followed by reduction at 600C (see supplementary materials for details of the regeneration procedure). The regeneration studies showed that Pt1Sn1/SiO2 catalysts can be partially regenerated. For example, we measured 97% of the initial activity and &gt;99% of the initial selectivity after three PDH/regeneration cycles (fig. S5).
          Data in Fig. 3A show that the process of mixing chloroplatinic acid (H2PtCl6) and tin(II) chloride (SnCl2) in 0.1 M hydrochloric acid solution formed a heterometallic Pt-Sn coordination complex.
          A bright-field TEM image of Pt-Sn NPs formed on SiO2 upon the reduction of the Pt-Sn complex shows high metal dispersion on the support, with an average NP size of 1.3  0.6 nm (Fig. 3B). The NP size distribution (Fig. 3C) shows that most NPs were &lt;2 nm. The XRD spectra in Fig. 3D show that the formed NPs were essentially alloys of Pt and Sn. This finding is supported by the presence of the XRD peaks corresponding to Pt1Sn1 (41.8 and 44.1) and Pt3Sn1 (39.0 and 45.3) stoichiometries.
          The real-space Pt LIII EXAFS spectra for the Pt1Sn1/SiO2 catalyst (Fig. 4D) are substantially different from the spectra of monometallic Pt and indicate the mixing of Pt and Sn atoms. The best-fit spectrum for the Pt1Sn1/SiO2 catalyst is characterized by the presence of the Pt-Pt and Pt-Sn scattering paths, consistent with the formation of PtSn intermetallic phases.
