The literature does not provide information on the key strategies and approaches that have been recently developed to enhance the catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes. However, it does describe the preparation and testing of ZnPt/HZ catalysts with different Zn/Pt ratios supported on high-silica HZSM-5 zeolite for the direct dehydrogenation of propane to propylene (PDH). The optimal 10Zn0.1Pt/HZ catalyst, consisting of 1000 ppm Pt and 10 wt% Zn, shows a high propylene yield (about 46%) and extraordinary dehydrogenation stability over 65 h at 525 C without any regeneration procedure or H2 as auxiliary gas. This catalyst has two kinds of active centers which work corporately: (i) Lewis acidic sites created by framework Zn species and (ii) small-sized PtZn particles. The stable state of the active species and strong carbon resistance of 10Zn0.1Pt/HZ related to the interaction effect between Pt and Zn are confirmed, accounting for the admirable reaction stability of PDH. This catalyst contains much more Zn and less Pt than previously reported PtZn-based dehydrogenation catalysts, breaking the traditional understanding about PtZn catalysts and opening a wide avenue for the design of stable dehydrogenation catalysts.

Recent advancements in catalyst design for direct dehydrogenation processes include the use of Pt-Sn clusters anchored at Al3+penta sites on mesoporous Al2O3 supports. These supports are fabricated with different levels of Al3+penta sites to disperse Pt-Sn2 clusters. The stability and regenerability of the Pt-Sn2/meso-Al2O3 catalysts are strongly dependent on the content of Al3+penta sites, with a high level of these sites effectively preventing the agglomeration of Pt-Sn2 clusters into large Pt nanoparticles during consecutive dehydrogenation-regeneration cycles.

The literature does not provide specific strategies or approaches for enhancing the catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes. However, it does describe the synthesis of ultrafine bimetallic Ga-Pt nanocatalysts encapsulated into silicalite-1 (S-1) zeolites (GaPt@S-1) for propane dehydrogenation (PDH). The confined GaPt alloy nanoclusters within the zeolite are the active sites for PDH reaction, and their high electron density could boost the desorption of products, resulting in a high propene selectivity and formation rate. The restriction of the zeolite can enhance the regeneration stability of the catalyst, and the catalytic activity kept unchanged after four consecutive cycles.

Recent advancements in catalytic stability for supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes include the use of rare-earth-platinum alloy nanoparticles supported on mesoporous zeolites. These catalysts are typically prepared by reducing metal precursor compounds under a hydrogen flow at high temperatures. However, the formation of Pt alloys with rare-earth elements through this method is challenging due to the low chemical potential of rare-earth element oxides. A novel approach uses a mesoporous zeolite with surface framework defects, known as silanol nests, which enable the rare-earth elements to exist as single atomic species with a higher chemical potential. This allows them to diffuse onto Pt, forming stable, highly active, and selective intermetallic compounds for propane dehydrogenation. When applied to late transition metals, this preparation strategy results in Pt alloy catalysts with a large amount of the second metal, such as in the case of the PtCo alloy, which exhibits high catalytic activity and selectivity in the preferential oxidation of carbon monoxide in hydrogen. The industrial PDH process has been using PtSn bimetallic catalysts supported on porous alumina for nearly three decades. However, Pt metal alone exhibits high initial catalytic activity but rapidly deactivates due to coke deposition on the Pt surface, which also causes a loss of catalytic selectivity to propylene. To address these problems, Sn is introduced to form an alloy with Pt nanoparticles, diluting the Pt surface with inactive Sn atoms and breaking up coke-generating Pt ensembles. Researchers have focused on using a siliceous MFI zeolite with a hierarchical micro-/mesoporous structure as a replacement for the alumina support. This zeolite, synthesized using a multi-ammonium surfactant as a structure-directing agent, has attracted attention as an advanced catalyst support due to its unique structure, which comprises ultrathin zeolite frameworks and three-dimensionally interconnected mesopores. These features boost the catalytic performance of supported metals by providing facile reactant and product diffusion and high metal nanoparticle dispersion within the mesopores. The formation of Pt3La and Pt3Y nanoparticles on the degallated zeolite has significantly enhanced the PDH catalytic performance, including activity, selectivity, and durability. Under harsh operating conditions, the conventional PtSn/alumina catalyst experiences severe coke formation and catalyst deactivation within one day. In contrast, the Pt3La intermetallic nanoparticles supported on the degallated zeolite show high initial propane conversion and undergo extremely slow deactivation, retaining 8% conversion even after 30 days of reaction. The PtREE incorporation in the mesoporous zeolite was conducted by co-impregnation of aqueous solutions of Pt and rare-earth element precursors, followed by heating under an O2 flow and subsequently under H2 at high temperatures. The formation of intermetallic compounds, such as Pt3La and Pt3Y, on the degallated zeolite significantly enhances the catalytic performance in terms of activity, selectivity, and durability. The PtREE/zeolite catalysts exhibit high initial propane conversion and slow deactivation, retaining significant conversion even after extended periods of reaction. The presence of a small amount of Ga in the zeolite may also contribute to the catalytic function. These advancements address the challenges in catalyst design, fabrication, and performance optimization by providing a stable and highly active catalyst for industrial applications, particularly in propane dehydrogenation.

Recent strategies to enhance the catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes include oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH), which has the potential to lower the energy requirement for achieving dehydrogenation. ODH can be considered as tandem endothermic (dehydrogenation) and exothermic (oxidation) processes, with an overall thermodynamic summation. Although the process is not thermo-neutral, part of the energy required for the endothermic reaction is augmented by the exothermic reaction. This lower temperature requirement of ODH compared to non-ODH and cracking is encouraging and provides motivation for continued efforts to develop ODH into an industrial technology. However, commercial ODH technologies hinge on innovative catalyst and process design, i.e. proper synergy of the endothermic dehydrogenation step with the exothermic hydrogen combustion and design of selective CH and hydrogen combustion catalysts. Insights about components of the active sites of CH activation can provide a platform for rational design of new efficient catalysts for dehydrogenation of lower alkanes. Recent strategies to enhance the catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes include the use of zeolites as supports to achieve high metal dispersion through cation exchange sites. This approach has been demonstrated with the creation of a Pt/Na[Fe]-ZSM-5 catalyst that exhibits outstanding stability for dehydrogenation of light alkanes. The catalyst's high Pt dispersion (cluster size < 1 mm) on zeolite through ion-exchange and the choice of Fe3+ as an isomorphous cation in place of Al3+ led to weaker Brnsted sites in [Fe]-ZSM compared to [Al]-ZSM, minimizing the tendency of side reactions and resulting in higher alkene selectivity and catalyst stability. Insights into the CH activation mechanisms on different catalysts have also been gained, which can guide the rational design of improved catalysts for C2 and C3 alkane dehydrogenation at lower temperatures. The key strategies and approaches that have been recently developed to enhance the catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes include oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH), which has the potential to lower the energy requirement for achieving dehydrogenation. However, commercial ODH technologies hinge on innovative catalyst and process design, including proper synergy of the endothermic dehydrogenation step with the exothermic hydrogen combustion and design of selective CH and hydrogen combustion catalysts. Despite a large number of reports and many reviews covering different aspects of the subject, and more than two decades of investigations on ODH, gaps still exist between laboratory achievements and industrial implementation.

Recent strategies to enhance the catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes include alloying Ni with Au or Sn to prevent the accumulation of carbon atoms on the surface and hinder the formation of coke. Alloying Ni with Au makes the adsorption of C atoms on the surface less favorable thermodynamically. Alloying Ni with Sn hinders the formation of CC bonds and enhances the formation of CO bonds, leading to the removal of surface C centers as carbon monoxide. This separation of Ni centers on the catalyst surface prevents the formation of coke. Additionally, additives such as potassium, sulfur, gold, or boron can be used to occupy step sites and prevent the formation of graphene islands. Boron can also be used to block sub-surface sites and prevent the formation of a carbidic phase. Sub-surface boron in Ni(111) has a destabilizing effect on on-surface C centers, which helps prevent the accumulation of C atoms on the surface.

Recent advancements in catalyst design for direct dehydrogenation processes include the development of a novel catalyst design concept that involves the double decoration of PtGa intermetallics with Pb and Ca. This strategy synergizes the geometric and electronic promotion effects on the catalyst stability. Pb is deposited on the three-fold Pt3 sites of the PtGa nanoparticles to block them, while Ca is placed around the nanoparticles to provide an electron-enriched single-atom-like Pt1 site. The resulting PtGaCaPb/SiO2 catalyst exhibits outstanding catalytic stability in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) at 600C, with almost no deactivation observed for up to 1 month. This addresses the challenges in catalyst design, fabrication, and performance optimization for industrial applications by providing an ultra-stable catalyst for PDH at high temperatures.

Recent strategies to enhance the catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes include optimizing the dispersion of Pt on the surface of carriers through ion exchange and impregnation, using additives to form alloys with Pt to anchor it on the carrier surface, and selecting carriers with strong interaction with Pt to prevent migration and coalescence. Pt can be loaded into the spaces between the layers of MgAlOx hydrotalcite and enclosed in the interspace of MgAl2O4 spinel to prevent migration. Pt can also be encapsulated in highly siliceous chabazite or coated with Al2O3 through atomic layer deposition to prevent sintering. Pt/MgO and Pt/CeO2 have been found to prevent Pt sintering due to the formation of a Mg2PtO4-like compound and the PtOCe bond, respectively. Atomically dispersed Pt on CeO2 can also prevent sintering. Adding Ga, In, Zn, Cu, Ir, Co to Pt catalysts can have similar effects as Sn in improving stability. B and Si can also play similar roles in preventing sintering and coking. The non-stoichiometric PtB cluster anchored to the carrier via a covalent BO bond can prevent sintering and reduce coke formation. Boration can reduce the binding energy of olefins and the tendency towards coke precursors. Computational screening predicts that Si can modify the selectivity of the Pt catalyst by changing both electronic and geometric properties.

Recent advancements in the design and fabrication of supported metal catalysts for direct dehydrogenation processes have focused on the development of novel synthesis strategies and in situ characterization techniques to provide insights at the atomic and molecular levels. These strategies include the control of metal particle size, the preparation of bimetallic nanoparticles with tailored size and phase, the stabilization of metal sites through strong interactions with supports, the encapsulation of metals in zeolites to prevent sintering, the use of hydrothermal synthesis to maintain porous texture and anchor active metals, the preparation of uniform bimetal nanoparticles, the employment of single-site metal precursors to construct well-defined surface metal species, and the transformation of zeolite structures to stabilize metals. These advancements address the challenges in catalyst design, fabrication, and performance optimization for industrial applications by improving the structural stability, anti-coking ability, and catalytic activity of supported metal catalysts.

Recent strategies to enhance the stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes include the nanopore-encaged metal strategy, wet-chemistry approach, and modification of supports. Modification of supports is particularly effective and simple. For instance, Lu et al. developed a PtSn/Al2O3 sheet catalyst for PDH, which showed high activity, selectivity, and stability due to the stabilization of PtSn clusters by strong metal-support interactions. Ma et al. found that adding Ga to Mg(Al)O layer double hydrotalcites significantly improved the stability of Pt catalysts in PDH, possibly because pentacoordinate Ga3+ ions dispersed and stabilized PtSn clusters, enhancing electronic interactions between Pt and Ga. The importance of support modification was also highlighted in the case of PtSn/CeO2 catalysts. These strategies allow for tuning and enhancement of catalytic activity, selectivity, and unique stability characteristics for bimetallic systems in PDH processes. Recent advancements in enhancing the catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts for direct dehydrogenation processes include the development of highly stable Pt/Sn-Si-beta catalysts using an improved post-synthesis strategy. This strategy involves the dealumination of H-beta zeolite and subsequent metal impregnation. Sn species in tetrahedral coordination states are incorporated into the framework of dealuminated beta (Si-beta), and Pt species are highly dispersed in the form of ultra-small nanoclusters on Pt/Sn-Si-beta due to the strong interaction between Pt and Sn(IV) sites confined in the Si-beta framework. The Pt/Sn-Si-beta catalysts exhibit excellent catalytic performance for propane dehydrogenation (PDH), with a propene formation rate of 2.3 mol g1Pt h1 and a propene selectivity of >99% at 550 C, and a higher propene formation rate of 3.1 mol g1Pt h1 at 600 C. The strong PtSn interactions and the confinement effect of Sn in the Si-beta framework inhibit coke formation and Pt cluster sintering, resulting in good stability of dehydrogenation and regeneration with almost unchanged catalytic activity during four cycles at 550 C. These advancements address the challenges in catalyst design, fabrication, and performance optimization for industrial applications by improving the stability and selectivity of the catalysts.

The introduction of various metals (Ce, In, La, and Fe) as promoters into the Pt/Sn-SBA-15 catalyst can significantly affect the initial activity and catalytic stability for propane dehydrogenation. The promoters can improve the redox property, antisintering ability, and resistance to coke deposition, which are responsible for the catalytic stability. The integrated impacts of these factors determine the overall stability of the catalysts. The introduction of transition metal (Zn), alkaline metal (Na, K), alkaline earth metal (Mg, Ca), and rare earth metal (La, Ce), etc. into the catalysts as promotors offered another strategy to enhance the interaction between Pt and Sn and tune the acid-base property simultaneously. The modified catalyst properties further acted positively in promoting the catalytic performances of propane dehydrogenation. The preparation of various metals (Ce, In, La, and Fe) promoted Pt/Sn-SBA-15 catalysts and their characterization and evaluation in propane dehydrogenation show that the nature of the promoter significantly affects the redox properties, surface composition, and lattice oxygen capacity of the catalysts, which in turn influence the initial activity and catalytic stability in propane dehydrogenation. The In-promoted catalyst exhibited the best performance during the stability test, with a moderate level of coke deposition and the maximum level of surface Pt species. The introduction of In also promoted the reduction of surface Pt oxides and stabilized the metallic Pt particles, leading to higher propylene selectivity and stability.

Recently developed strategies to enhance the catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes include the introduction of promoters to regulate the active compounds in both Pt-based and metal oxide-based catalysts. These advancements address challenges in catalyst design, fabrication, and performance optimization by suppressing side reactions, inhibiting coke deposition, stabilizing active compounds, and improving the dispersion of Pt atoms. Pt-based catalysts have been recognized as effective for alkane dehydrogenation reactions due to their high affinity for paraffinic CH bonds. Metal promoters, such as Sn, Ga, In, Zn, Cu, Co, and rare-earth elements (REEs), have been used to form alloys or intermetallic compounds to ameliorate central active components and inhibit catalytic deactivation. Metal oxide-based catalysts, including CoOx-, ZnOx-, VOx-, and CrOx-based catalysts, have also been extensively studied. Introducing another metal oxide to form an oxide compound can improve the dispersion of active species and enhance catalytic stability by modifying the coordination and electronic state of host metal oxide sites. The introduction of an appropriate metal oxide or noble metal can greatly enhance the catalytic performance.

However, it does describe a specific catalyst system, a boron nitride nanosheet-supported Pt/Cu cluster, which exhibits high efficiency and stability for propane dehydrogenation. The unique geometry of the Pt/Cu cluster, maintained by the strong bonding interaction between copper and edge BO defects on the h-BN nanosheets, is attributed to the remarkable improvement in catalytic efficiency.

The catalyst was designed to minimize the use of platinum while maximizing its catalytic activity. The h-BN nanosheets provided a high surface area and abundant edges, which were terminated as amino groups. These characteristics made the h-BN nanosheets an appropriate support for loading the Pt/Cu catalyst. The strong bonding interaction between copper and the edge BO defects of the h-BN nanosheets maintained the unique geometry of the Pt/Cu cluster, leading to remarkable improvement in catalytic efficiency.

Recently developed strategies to enhance the catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes include the use of bimetallic catalysts formed by doping promoters such as Sn, In, Ga, and Cu, which can improve the dispersion of Pt and facilitate electron transfer. Another method is to modify the support, such as using ZnO, La2O3, TiO2, or replacing Al2O3 with other oxides. Single atom sites of Pt on a sandwich structure have also been found to be more favorable for PDH reactions than Pt ensembles. PtCu single atom alloys can simultaneously enhance propane conversion and propene selectivity. The goal of these strategies is to obtain highly and stably dispersed Pt-based catalysts to improve PDH performance. However, challenges remain in fully understanding the relationship between Pt, the promoter, and the support, and more efficient methods are needed to solve these problems. The hierarchical morphology and porous structure of catalysts are also being explored to provide more stable and accessible active sites, which can improve the performance of PDH reactions. The reconstruction of hydrotalcite-like compounds has shown promising effects on the microstructure and morphology of 3D oxide nanosheet array catalysts, leading to superior PDH performance.

Recent advancements in catalyst design for direct dehydrogenation processes have focused on developing stable and selective catalysts that can operate at thermodynamic limits. These catalysts, often consisting of platinum-tin alloy nanoparticles supported on alumina, have traditionally required hydrogen dilution to prevent carbon buildup and excess tin to avoid alloy segregation. However, a new approach using silica-supported platinum-tin nanoparticles has been reported to operate at thermodynamically limited conversion levels with high stability and selectivity to propylene. This is achieved by preserving the atomic mixing of platinum and tin during reduction and catalytic operation, and the benign interaction of the nanoparticles with the silica support prevents segregation and the formation of tin oxide phases. This catalyst can operate without hydrogen addition, which increases productivity by avoiding the decrease in thermodynamic limits on propane conversion. The synthesis of the catalyst begins with a heterometallic Pt-Sn coordination complex, ensuring that the interaction between Pt and Sn is retained during reduction and the PDH reaction. The catalyst features atomically mixed Pt-Sn precursors, very small intermetallic PtSn nanoparticles upon reduction, and a benign interaction with the silica support that avoids segregation and the formation of a tin oxide phase.

However, these strategies can reduce the efficiency of the process.
          A new catalyst has been developed that operates at thermodynamic limits without the need for hydrogen dilution and exhibits excellent stability and selectivity to propylene. This catalyst is composed of silica-supported Pt1Sn1 nanoparticles, synthesized and pretreated to ensure that the mixing of Pt and Sn is preserved during catalytic operation.
          The principle behind the synthesis of this catalyst is to begin with a heterometallic Pt-Sn coordination complex in which Pt and Sn are in immediate contact, and this interaction is retained during the reduction and PDH reaction.

          Commercial operations often dilute propane streams to increase the limiting equilibrium conversion, which is higher at lower propane partial pressure, and to limit catalyst deactivation rates. However, this approach requires additional downstream separation units and limits process efficiency.
          Under reaction conditions, the thermodynamic limit on propane conversion is 66.5%. The Pt1Sn1/SiO2 catalyst showed near-thermodynamic conversion of &gt;66% and &gt;99% selectivity to propylene.
          Under harsh conditions, the propane conversion goes from 41 to 39% in 120 min. Under identical conditions, the other tested catalysts deactivate very rapidly to very low conversion. A TEM image of the spent catalyst shows that the Pt-Sn NPs are well dispersed, with an average particle diameter of 1.6  0.67 nm, which is consistent with the particle size in fresh samples.
          The Pt1Sn1/SiO2 catalyst can be partially regenerated by oxidation using 1% O2 as a mild oxidant at 500C followed by reduction at 600C. The regeneration studies showed that the catalysts can be partially regenerated, with 97% of the initial activity and &gt;99% of the initial selectivity after three PDH/regeneration cycles.
          The process of mixing chloroplatinic acid and tin(II) chloride in 0.1 M hydrochloric acid solution formed a heterometallic Pt-Sn coordination complex.
          A bright-field TEM image of Pt-Sn NPs formed on SiO2 upon the reduction of the Pt-Sn complex shows high metal dispersion on the support, with an average NP size of 1.3  0.6 nm. The XRD spectra show that the formed NPs were essentially alloys of Pt and Sn.
          The real-space Pt LIII EXAFS spectra for the Pt1Sn1/SiO2 catalyst are substantially different from the spectra of monometallic Pt and indicate the mixing of Pt and Sn atoms. The best-fit spectrum for the Pt1Sn1/SiO2 catalyst is characterized by the presence of the Pt-Pt and Pt-Sn scattering paths, consistent with the formation of PtSn intermetallic phases.

The document does not provide information on the key strategies and approaches that have been recently developed to enhance the catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes. However, it does discuss the effects of composition and metal particle size on ethane dehydrogenation over PtxSn100x/Mg(Al)O (70  x  100) catalysts. The study found that the specific activity of PtxSn100x/Mg(Al)O for ethane dehydrogenation increases with increasing metal particle size and increasing Sn/Pt ratio. Carbon deposition decreases with decreasing metal particle size and increasing Sn/Pt ratio. These findings suggest that controlling the particle size and composition of the catalyst can improve its stability and performance in dehydrogenation processes.

The literature does not provide specific strategies or approaches for enhancing the catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes. However, it does report the development of a CoSiBeta catalyst with high catalytic activity and selectivity for the direct dehydrogenation of propane to propylene. The catalyst features ultrasmall-sized Co particles confined in the silanols of dealuminated Beta zeolite, which are highly efficient for catalyzing the reaction. The CoOx species within the zeolite can be easily reduced to metallic Co particles under H2 or reactant gas, and these particles are the active sites for the PDH reaction. The high catalytic ability and product selectivity of small confined Co particles are proven, providing novel inspiration for the design of low-cost, ecofriendly, and advanced catalysts for PDH. The earth abundance of Co bodes well for long-term utility, and it has been reported to show a certain degree of catalytic activity for PDH. The literature also discusses the preparation of cobalt catalysts supported on dealuminated Beta (SiBeta) based on Dzwigaj's method, followed by high-temperature calcination in air to obtain CoSiBeta catalysts for PDH. After prereduction under optimum conditions, the 0.5CoSiBeta catalyst (Co loading is 0.5 wt%) showed propane conversion as high as 72% with propylene selectivity of around 92%. The literature suggests that the small metallic Co particles confined in silanols are active sites, and bulk Co3O4 and large Co0 particles on SiBeta support contribute to cracking and carbon deposition, respectively.

The literature does not provide information on the key strategies and approaches that have been recently developed to enhance the catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes. However, it does discuss the promotional effect of Cu on the catalytic performance of Pt/Al2O3 catalysts for propane dehydrogenation. The optimized loading content of Cu is 0.5 wt%, which increases the propylene selectivity to 90.8% with a propylene yield of 36.5%. The origin of the enhanced catalytic performance and anti-coking ability of the PtCu/Al2O3 catalyst is ascribed to the intimate interaction between Pt and Cu, which inhibits propylene adsorption and elevates the energy barrier of CC bond rupture. The inhibited propylene adsorption diminishes the possibility of coke formation and suppresses the cracking reaction towards the formation of lighter hydrocarbons on PtCu/Al2O3, while a higher energy barrier for CC bond cleavage suppresses the methane formation. The literature does not provide information on the key strategies and approaches that have been recently developed to enhance the catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes. However, it does mention that the addition of copper to a platinum-based catalyst improves its catalytic performance and stability for propane dehydrogenation. The optimized loading content of copper is 0.5 wt%, which increases the propylene selectivity to 90.8% with a propylene yield of 36.5%. The improved anti-coking ability of the PtCu/Al2O3 catalysts is due to the inhibition of propylene adsorption, which diminishes the possibility of coke formation and suppresses the cracking reactions towards lighter hydrocarbons on PtCu/Al2O3. Additionally, the copper addition improves propylene selectivity while suppressing methane formation since a higher energy barrier for CC bond cleavage is required on the PtCu/Al2O3 catalyst. The primary origin of the enhancement upon copper addition can be ascribed to the unique PtCu bimetallic interaction.

The key strategies and approaches that have been recently developed to enhance the catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes include oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH), which has the potential to lower the energy requirement for achieving dehydrogenation. However, commercial ODH technologies hinge on innovative catalyst and process design, including proper synergy of the endothermic dehydrogenation step with the exothermic hydrogen combustion and design of selective CH and hydrogen combustion catalysts. Despite a large number of reports and many reviews covering different aspects of the subject, and more than two decades of investigations on ODH, gaps still exist between laboratory achievements and industrial implementation.

Recent strategies to enhance the catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes include alloying Ni with Au or Sn to prevent the accumulation of carbon atoms on the surface and hinder the formation of coke. Alloying Ni with Au makes the adsorption of C atoms on the surface less favorable thermodynamically. Alloying Ni with Sn hinders the formation of CC bonds and enhances the formation of CO bonds, leading to the removal of surface C centers as carbon monoxide. This separation of Ni centers on the catalyst surface prevents the formation of coke. Additionally, additives such as potassium, sulfur, gold, or boron can be used to occupy step sites and prevent the formation of graphene islands. Boron can also be used to block sub-surface sites and prevent the formation of a carbidic phase. Sub-surface boron in Ni(111) has a destabilizing effect on on-surface C centers, which helps prevent the accumulation of C atoms on the surface.

Recent advancements in catalyst design for direct dehydrogenation processes include the development of a novel catalyst design concept that involves the double decoration of PtGa intermetallics with Pb and Ca. This strategy synergizes the geometric and electronic promotion effects on the catalyst stability. Pb is deposited on the three-fold Pt3 sites of the PtGa nanoparticles to block them, while Ca is placed around the nanoparticles to provide an electron-enriched single-atom-like Pt1 site. The resulting PtGaCaPb/SiO2 catalyst exhibits outstanding catalytic stability in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) at 600C, with almost no deactivation observed for up to 1 month. This addresses the challenges in catalyst design, fabrication, and performance optimization for industrial applications by providing an ultra-stable catalyst for PDH at high temperatures.

Recent strategies to enhance the catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes include optimizing the dispersion of Pt on the surface of carriers through ion exchange and impregnation, using additives to form alloys with Pt to anchor it on the carrier surface, and selecting carriers with strong interaction with Pt to prevent migration and coalescence. Pt can be loaded into the spaces between the layers of MgAlOx hydrotalcite and enclosed in the interspace of MgAl2O4 spinel to prevent migration. Pt can also be encapsulated in highly siliceous chabazite or coated with Al2O3 through atomic layer deposition to prevent sintering. Pt/MgO and Pt/CeO2 have been found to prevent Pt sintering due to the formation of a Mg2PtO4-like compound and the PtOCe bond, respectively. Atomically dispersed Pt on CeO2 can also prevent sintering. Adding Ga, In, Zn, Cu, Ir, Co to Pt catalysts can have similar effects as Sn in improving stability. B and Si can also play similar roles in preventing sintering and coking. The non-stoichiometric PtB cluster anchored to the carrier via a covalent BO bond can prevent sintering and reduce coke formation. Boration can reduce the binding energy of olefins and the tendency towards coke precursors. Computational screening predicts that Si can modify the selectivity of the Pt catalyst by changing both electronic and geometric properties.

Recent advancements in the design and fabrication of supported metal catalysts for direct dehydrogenation processes have focused on the development of novel synthesis strategies and in situ characterization techniques to provide insights at the atomic and molecular levels.

Recent strategies to enhance the stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes include the nanopore-encaged metal strategy, wet-chemistry approach, and modification of supports. Modification of supports is particularly effective and simple. For instance, Lu et al. developed a PtSn/Al2O3 sheet catalyst for PDH, which showed high activity, selectivity, and stability due to the stabilization of PtSn clusters by strong metal-support interactions. Ma et al. found that adding Ga to Mg(Al)O layer double hydrotalcites significantly improved the stability of Pt catalysts in PDH, possibly because pentacoordinate Ga3+ ions dispersed and stabilized PtSn clusters, enhancing electronic interactions between Pt and Ga. The importance of support modification was also highlighted in the case of PtSn/CeO2 catalysts. These strategies allow for tuning and enhancement of catalytic activity, selectivity, and unique stability characteristics for bimetallic systems in PDH processes. Recent advancements in enhancing the catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts for direct dehydrogenation processes include the development of highly stable Pt/Sn-Si-beta catalysts using an improved post-synthesis strategy. This strategy involves the dealumination of H-beta zeolite and subsequent metal impregnation. Sn species in tetrahedral coordination states are incorporated into the framework of dealuminated beta (Si-beta), and Pt species are highly dispersed in the form of ultra-small nanoclusters on Pt/Sn-Si-beta due to the strong interaction between Pt and Sn(IV) sites confined in the Si-beta framework. The Pt/Sn-Si-beta catalysts exhibit excellent catalytic performance for propane dehydrogenation (PDH), with a propene formation rate of 2.3 mol g1Pt h1 and a propene selectivity of >99% at 550 C, and a higher propene formation rate of 3.1 mol g1Pt h1 at 600 C. The strong PtSn interactions and the confinement effect of Sn in the Si-beta framework inhibit coke formation and Pt cluster sintering, resulting in good stability of dehydrogenation and regeneration with almost unchanged catalytic activity during four cycles at 550 C. These advancements address the challenges in catalyst design, fabrication, and performance optimization for industrial applications by improving the stability and selectivity of the catalysts.

The introduction of various metals (Ce, In, La, and Fe) as promoters into the Pt/Sn-SBA-15 catalyst can significantly affect the initial activity and catalytic stability for propane dehydrogenation. The promoters can improve the redox property, antisintering ability, and resistance to coke deposition, which are responsible for the catalytic stability. The integrated impacts of these factors determine the overall stability of the catalysts. The introduction of transition metal (Zn), alkaline metal (Na, K), alkaline earth metal (Mg, Ca), and rare earth metal (La, Ce), etc. into the catalysts as promotors offered another strategy to enhance the interaction between Pt and Sn and tune the acid-base property simultaneously. The modified catalyst properties further acted positively in promoting the catalytic performances of propane dehydrogenation. The preparation of various metals (Ce, In, La, and Fe) promoted Pt/Sn-SBA-15 catalysts and their characterization and evaluation in propane dehydrogenation show that the nature of the promoter significantly affects the redox properties, surface composition, and lattice oxygen capacity of the catalysts, which in turn influence the initial activity and catalytic stability in propane dehydrogenation. The In-promoted catalyst exhibited the best performance during the stability test, with a moderate level of coke deposition and the maximum level of surface Pt species. The introduction of In also promoted the reduction of surface Pt oxides and stabilized the metallic Pt particles, leading to higher propylene selectivity and stability.

Recently developed strategies to enhance the catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes include the introduction of promoters to regulate the active compounds in both Pt-based and metal oxide-based catalysts. These advancements address challenges in catalyst design, fabrication, and performance optimization by suppressing side reactions, inhibiting coke deposition, stabilizing active compounds, and improving the dispersion of Pt atoms. Pt-based catalysts have been recognized as effective for alkane dehydrogenation reactions due to their high affinity for paraffinic CH bonds. Metal promoters, such as Sn, Ga, In, Zn, Cu, Co, and rare-earth elements (REEs), have been used to form alloys or intermetallic compounds to ameliorate central active components and inhibit catalytic deactivation. Metal oxide-based catalysts, including CoOx-, ZnOx-, VOx-, and CrOx-based catalysts, have also been extensively studied. Introducing another metal oxide to form an oxide compound can improve the dispersion of active species and enhance catalytic stability by modifying the coordination and electronic state of host metal oxide sites. The introduction of an appropriate metal oxide or noble metal can greatly enhance the catalytic performance.

The catalyst was designed to minimize the use of platinum while maximizing its catalytic activity. The h-BN nanosheets provided a high surface area and abundant edges, which were terminated as amino groups. These characteristics made the h-BN nanosheets an appropriate support for loading the Pt/Cu catalyst. The strong bonding interaction between copper and the edge BO defects of the h-BN nanosheets maintained the unique geometry of the Pt/Cu cluster, leading to remarkable improvement in catalytic efficiency.

Recently developed strategies to enhance the catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes include the use of bimetallic catalysts formed by doping promoters such as Sn, In, Ga, and Cu, which can improve the dispersion of Pt and facilitate electron transfer. Another method is to modify the support, such as using ZnO, La2O3, TiO2, or replacing Al2O3 with other oxides. Single atom sites of Pt on a sandwich structure have also been found to be more favorable for PDH reactions than Pt ensembles. PtCu single atom alloys can simultaneously enhance propane conversion and propene selectivity. The goal of these strategies is to obtain highly and stably dispersed Pt-based catalysts to improve PDH performance. However, challenges remain in fully understanding the relationship between Pt, the promoter, and the support, and more efficient methods are needed to solve these problems. The hierarchical morphology and porous structure of catalysts are also being explored to provide more stable and accessible active sites, which can improve the performance of PDH reactions. The reconstruction of hydrotalcite-like compounds has shown promising effects on the microstructure and morphology of 3D oxide nanosheet array catalysts, leading to superior PDH performance.

Recent advancements in catalyst design for direct dehydrogenation processes have focused on developing stable and selective catalysts that can operate at thermodynamic limits. These catalysts, often consisting of platinum-tin alloy nanoparticles supported on alumina, have traditionally required hydrogen dilution to prevent carbon buildup and excess tin to avoid alloy segregation. However, a new approach using silica-supported platinum-tin nanoparticles has been reported to operate at thermodynamically limited conversion levels with high stability and selectivity to propylene. This is achieved by preserving the atomic mixing of platinum and tin during reduction and catalytic operation, and the benign interaction of the nanoparticles with the silica support prevents segregation and the formation of tin oxide phases. This catalyst can operate without hydrogen addition, which increases productivity by avoiding the decrease in thermodynamic limits on propane conversion. The synthesis of the catalyst begins with a heterometallic Pt-Sn coordination complex, ensuring that the interaction between Pt and Sn is retained during reduction and the PDH reaction. The catalyst features atomically mixed Pt-Sn precursors, very small intermetallic PtSn nanoparticles upon reduction, and a benign interaction with the silica support that avoids segregation and the formation of a tin oxide phase.

These catalysts, consisting of platinum-tin alloy nanoparticles supported on alumina, often require hydrogen dilution to prevent carbon buildup and excess tin to avoid alloy segregation. However, these strategies can reduce the efficiency of the process.
          A new catalyst has been developed that operates at thermodynamic limits without the need for hydrogen dilution and exhibits excellent stability and selectivity to propylene. This catalyst is composed of silica-supported Pt1Sn1 nanoparticles, synthesized and pretreated to ensure that the mixing of Pt and Sn is preserved during catalytic operation.
          The principle behind the synthesis of this catalyst is to begin with a heterometallic Pt-Sn coordination complex in which Pt and Sn are in immediate contact, and this interaction is retained during the reduction and PDH reaction.

The catalyst is composed of silica-supported Pt1Sn1 nanoparticles, synthesized and pretreated to ensure that the mixing of Pt and Sn is preserved during catalytic operation.
          Commercial operations often dilute propane streams to increase the limiting equilibrium conversion, which is higher at lower propane partial pressure, and to limit catalyst deactivation rates. However, this approach requires additional downstream separation units and limits process efficiency.
          Under reaction conditions, the thermodynamic limit on propane conversion is 66.5%. The Pt1Sn1/SiO2 catalyst showed near-thermodynamic conversion of &gt;66% and &gt;99% selectivity to propylene.
          Under harsh conditions, the propane conversion goes from 41 to 39% in 120 min. Under identical conditions, the other tested catalysts deactivate very rapidly to very low conversion. A TEM image of the spent catalyst shows that the Pt-Sn NPs are well dispersed, with an average particle diameter of 1.6  0.67 nm, which is consistent with the particle size in fresh samples.
          The Pt1Sn1/SiO2 catalyst can be partially regenerated by oxidation using 1% O2 as a mild oxidant at 500C followed by reduction at 600C. The regeneration studies showed that the catalysts can be partially regenerated, with 97% of the initial activity and &gt;99% of the initial selectivity after three PDH/regeneration cycles.
          The process of mixing chloroplatinic acid and tin(II) chloride in 0.1 M hydrochloric acid solution formed a heterometallic Pt-Sn coordination complex.
          A bright-field TEM image of Pt-Sn NPs formed on SiO2 upon the reduction of the Pt-Sn complex shows high metal dispersion on the support, with an average NP size of 1.3  0.6 nm. The XRD spectra show that the formed NPs were essentially alloys of Pt and Sn.
          The real-space Pt LIII EXAFS spectra for the Pt1Sn1/SiO2 catalyst are substantially different from the spectra of monometallic Pt and indicate the mixing of Pt and Sn atoms. The best-fit spectrum for the Pt1Sn1/SiO2 catalyst is characterized by the presence of the Pt-Pt and Pt-Sn scattering paths, consistent with the formation of PtSn intermetallic phases.

The document does not provide information on the key strategies and approaches that have been recently developed to enhance the catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes. However, it does discuss the effects of composition and metal particle size on ethane dehydrogenation over PtxSn100x/Mg(Al)O (70  x  100) catalysts. The study found that the specific activity of PtxSn100x/Mg(Al)O for ethane dehydrogenation increases with increasing metal particle size and increasing Sn/Pt ratio. Carbon deposition decreases with decreasing metal particle size and increasing Sn/Pt ratio. These findings suggest that controlling the particle size and composition of the catalyst can improve its stability and performance in dehydrogenation processes.

The literature does not provide specific strategies or approaches for enhancing the catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes. However, it does report the development of a CoSiBeta catalyst with high catalytic activity and selectivity for the direct dehydrogenation of propane to propylene. The catalyst features ultrasmall-sized Co particles confined in the silanols of dealuminated Beta zeolite, which are highly efficient for catalyzing the reaction. The CoOx species within the zeolite can be easily reduced to metallic Co particles under H2 or reactant gas, and these particles are the active sites for the PDH reaction. The high catalytic ability and product selectivity of small confined Co particles are proven, providing novel inspiration for the design of low-cost, ecofriendly, and advanced catalysts for PDH. The earth abundance of Co bodes well for long-term utility, and it has been reported to show a certain degree of catalytic activity for PDH. The literature also discusses the preparation of cobalt catalysts supported on dealuminated Beta (SiBeta) based on Dzwigaj's method, followed by high-temperature calcination in air to obtain CoSiBeta catalysts for PDH. After prereduction under optimum conditions, the 0.5CoSiBeta catalyst (Co loading is 0.5 wt%) showed propane conversion as high as 72% with propylene selectivity of around 92%. The literature suggests that the small metallic Co particles confined in silanols are active sites, and bulk Co3O4 and large Co0 particles on SiBeta support contribute to cracking and carbon deposition, respectively.

The literature does not provide information on the key strategies and approaches that have been recently developed to enhance the catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes. However, it does discuss the promotional effect of Cu on the catalytic performance of Pt/Al2O3 catalysts for propane dehydrogenation. The optimized loading content of Cu is 0.5 wt%, which increases the propylene selectivity to 90.8% with a propylene yield of 36.5%. The origin of the enhanced catalytic performance and anti-coking ability of the PtCu/Al2O3 catalyst is ascribed to the intimate interaction between Pt and Cu, which inhibits propylene adsorption and elevates the energy barrier of CC bond rupture. The inhibited propylene adsorption diminishes the possibility of coke formation and suppresses the cracking reaction towards the formation of lighter hydrocarbons on PtCu/Al2O3, while a higher energy barrier for CC bond cleavage suppresses the methane formation. The literature does not provide information on the key strategies and approaches that have been recently developed to enhance the catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes. However, it does mention that the addition of copper to a platinum-based catalyst improves its catalytic performance and stability for propane dehydrogenation. The optimized loading content of copper is 0.5 wt%, which increases the propylene selectivity to 90.8% with a propylene yield of 36.5%. The improved anti-coking ability of the PtCu/Al2O3 catalysts is due to the inhibition of propylene adsorption, which diminishes the possibility of coke formation and suppresses the cracking reactions towards lighter hydrocarbons on PtCu/Al2O3. Additionally, the copper addition improves propylene selectivity while suppressing methane formation since a higher energy barrier for CC bond cleavage is required on the PtCu/Al2O3 catalyst. The primary origin of the enhancement upon copper addition can be ascribed to the unique PtCu bimetallic interaction.

The literature does not provide information on the key strategies and approaches that have been recently developed to enhance the catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes. However, it does describe the preparation and testing of ZnPt/HZ catalysts with different Zn/Pt ratios supported on high-silica HZSM-5 zeolite for the direct dehydrogenation of propane to propylene (PDH). The optimal 10Zn0.1Pt/HZ catalyst, consisting of 1000 ppm Pt and 10 wt% Zn, shows a high propylene yield (about 46%) and extraordinary dehydrogenation stability over 65 h at 525 C without any regeneration procedure or H2 as auxiliary gas. This catalyst has two kinds of active centers which work corporately: (i) Lewis acidic sites created by framework Zn species and (ii) small-sized PtZn particles. The stable state of the active species and strong carbon resistance of 10Zn0.1Pt/HZ related to the interaction effect between Pt and Zn are confirmed, accounting for the admirable reaction stability of PDH. This catalyst contains much more Zn and less Pt than previously reported PtZn-based dehydrogenation catalysts, breaking the traditional understanding about PtZn catalysts and opening a wide avenue for the design of stable dehydrogenation catalysts.

Recent advancements in catalyst design for direct dehydrogenation processes include the use of Pt-Sn clusters anchored at Al3+penta sites on mesoporous Al2O3 supports. These supports are fabricated with different levels of Al3+penta sites to disperse Pt-Sn2 clusters. The stability and regenerability of the Pt-Sn2/meso-Al2O3 catalysts are strongly dependent on the content of Al3+penta sites, with a high level of these sites effectively preventing the agglomeration of Pt-Sn2 clusters into large Pt nanoparticles during consecutive dehydrogenation-regeneration cycles.

The literature does not provide specific strategies or approaches for enhancing the catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes. However, it does describe the synthesis of ultrafine bimetallic Ga-Pt nanocatalysts encapsulated into silicalite-1 (S-1) zeolites (GaPt@S-1) for propane dehydrogenation (PDH). The confined GaPt alloy nanoclusters within the zeolite are the active sites for PDH reaction, and their high electron density could boost the desorption of products, resulting in a high propene selectivity and formation rate. The restriction of the zeolite can enhance the regeneration stability of the catalyst, and the catalytic activity kept unchanged after four consecutive cycles.

Recent advancements in catalytic stability for supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes include the use of rare-earth-platinum alloy nanoparticles supported on mesoporous zeolites. These catalysts are typically prepared by reducing metal precursor compounds under a hydrogen flow at high temperatures. However, the formation of Pt alloys with rare-earth elements through this method is challenging due to the low chemical potential of rare-earth element oxides. A novel approach uses a mesoporous zeolite with surface framework defects, known as silanol nests, which enable the rare-earth elements to exist as single atomic species with a higher chemical potential. This allows them to diffuse onto Pt, forming stable, highly active, and selective intermetallic compounds for propane dehydrogenation. When applied to late transition metals, this preparation strategy results in Pt alloy catalysts with a large amount of the second metal, such as in the case of the PtCo alloy, which exhibits high catalytic activity and selectivity in the preferential oxidation of carbon monoxide in hydrogen. The industrial PDH process has been using PtSn bimetallic catalysts supported on porous alumina for nearly three decades. However, Pt metal alone exhibits high initial catalytic activity but rapidly deactivates due to coke deposition on the Pt surface, which also causes a loss of catalytic selectivity to propylene. To address these problems, Sn is introduced to form an alloy with Pt nanoparticles, diluting the Pt surface with inactive Sn atoms and breaking up coke-generating Pt ensembles. Researchers have focused on using a siliceous MFI zeolite with a hierarchical micro-/mesoporous structure as a replacement for the alumina support. This zeolite, synthesized using a multi-ammonium surfactant as a structure-directing agent, has attracted attention as an advanced catalyst support due to its unique structure, which comprises ultrathin zeolite frameworks and three-dimensionally interconnected mesopores. These features boost the catalytic performance of supported metals by providing facile reactant and product diffusion and high metal nanoparticle dispersion within the mesopores. The formation of Pt3La and Pt3Y nanoparticles on the degallated zeolite has significantly enhanced the PDH catalytic performance, including activity, selectivity, and durability. Under harsh operating conditions, the conventional PtSn/alumina catalyst experiences severe coke formation and catalyst deactivation within one day. In contrast, the Pt3La intermetallic nanoparticles supported on the degallated zeolite show high initial propane conversion and undergo extremely slow deactivation, retaining 8% conversion even after 30 days of reaction. The PtREE incorporation in the mesoporous zeolite was conducted by co-impregnation of aqueous solutions of Pt and rare-earth element precursors, followed by heating under an O2 flow and subsequently under H2 at high temperatures. The formation of intermetallic compounds, such as Pt3La and Pt3Y, on the degallated zeolite significantly enhances the catalytic performance in terms of activity, selectivity, and durability. The PtREE/zeolite catalysts exhibit high initial propane conversion and slow deactivation, retaining significant conversion even after extended periods of reaction. The presence of a small amount of Ga in the zeolite may also contribute to the catalytic function. These advancements address the challenges in catalyst design, fabrication, and performance optimization by providing a stable and highly active catalyst for industrial applications, particularly in propane dehydrogenation.

Recent strategies to enhance the catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes include oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH), which has the potential to lower the energy requirement for achieving dehydrogenation. ODH can be considered as tandem endothermic (dehydrogenation) and exothermic (oxidation) processes, with an overall thermodynamic summation. Although the process is not thermo-neutral, part of the energy required for the endothermic reaction is augmented by the exothermic reaction. This lower temperature requirement of ODH compared to non-ODH and cracking is encouraging and provides motivation for continued efforts to develop ODH into an industrial technology. However, commercial ODH technologies hinge on innovative catalyst and process design, i.e. proper synergy of the endothermic dehydrogenation step with the exothermic hydrogen combustion and design of selective CH and hydrogen combustion catalysts. Insights about components of the active sites of CH activation can provide a platform for rational design of new efficient catalysts for dehydrogenation of lower alkanes. Recent strategies to enhance the catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes include the use of zeolites as supports to achieve high metal dispersion through cation exchange sites. This approach has been demonstrated with the creation of a Pt/Na[Fe]-ZSM-5 catalyst that exhibits outstanding stability for dehydrogenation of light alkanes. The catalyst's high Pt dispersion (cluster size < 1 mm) on zeolite through ion-exchange and the choice of Fe3+ as an isomorphous cation in place of Al3+ led to weaker Brnsted sites in [Fe]-ZSM compared to [Al]-ZSM, minimizing the tendency of side reactions and resulting in higher alkene selectivity and catalyst stability. Insights into the CH activation mechanisms on different catalysts have also been gained, which can guide the rational design of improved catalysts for C2 and C3 alkane dehydrogenation at lower temperatures.

The integrated impacts of these factors determine the overall stability of the catalysts. The introduction of transition metal (Zn), alkaline metal (Na, K), alkaline earth metal (Mg, Ca), and rare earth metal (La, Ce), etc. into the catalysts as promotors offered another strategy to enhance the interaction between Pt and Sn and tune the acid-base property simultaneously. The modified catalyst properties further acted positively in promoting the catalytic performances of propane dehydrogenation. The preparation of various metals (Ce, In, La, and Fe) promoted Pt/Sn-SBA-15 catalysts and their characterization and evaluation in propane dehydrogenation show that the nature of the promoter significantly affects the redox properties, surface composition, and lattice oxygen capacity of the catalysts, which in turn influence the initial activity and catalytic stability in propane dehydrogenation. The In-promoted catalyst exhibited the best performance during the stability test, with a moderate level of coke deposition and the maximum level of surface Pt species. The introduction of In also promoted the reduction of surface Pt oxides and stabilized the metallic Pt particles, leading to higher propylene selectivity and stability.

Recently developed strategies to enhance the catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes include the introduction of promoters to regulate the active compounds in both Pt-based and metal oxide-based catalysts. These advancements address challenges in catalyst design, fabrication, and performance optimization by suppressing side reactions, inhibiting coke deposition, stabilizing active compounds, and improving the dispersion of Pt atoms. Pt-based catalysts have been recognized as effective for alkane dehydrogenation reactions due to their high affinity for paraffinic CH bonds. Metal promoters, such as Sn, Ga, In, Zn, Cu, Co, and rare-earth elements (REEs), have been used to form alloys or intermetallic compounds to ameliorate central active components and inhibit catalytic deactivation. Metal oxide-based catalysts, including CoOx-, ZnOx-, VOx-, and CrOx-based catalysts, have also been extensively studied. Introducing another metal oxide to form an oxide compound can improve the dispersion of active species and enhance catalytic stability by modifying the coordination and electronic state of host metal oxide sites. The introduction of an appropriate metal oxide or noble metal can greatly enhance the catalytic performance.

Recently developed strategies to enhance the catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes include the use of bimetallic catalysts formed by doping promoters such as Sn, In, Ga, and Cu, which can improve the dispersion of Pt and facilitate electron transfer. Another method is to modify the support, such as using ZnO, La2O3, TiO2, or replacing Al2O3 with other oxides. Single atom sites of Pt on a sandwich structure have also been found to be more favorable for PDH reactions than Pt ensembles. PtCu single atom alloys can simultaneously enhance propane conversion and propene selectivity. The goal of these strategies is to obtain highly and stably dispersed Pt-based catalysts to improve PDH performance. However, challenges remain in fully understanding the relationship between Pt, the promoter, and the support, and more efficient methods are needed to solve these problems. The hierarchical morphology and porous structure of catalysts are also being explored to provide more stable and accessible active sites, which can improve the performance of PDH reactions. The reconstruction of hydrotalcite-like compounds has shown promising effects on the microstructure and morphology of 3D oxide nanosheet array catalysts, leading to superior PDH performance.

Recent advancements in catalyst design for direct dehydrogenation processes have focused on developing stable and selective catalysts that can operate at thermodynamic limits. These catalysts, often consisting of platinum-tin alloy nanoparticles supported on alumina, have traditionally required hydrogen dilution to prevent carbon buildup and excess tin to avoid alloy segregation. However, a new approach using silica-supported platinum-tin nanoparticles has been reported to operate at thermodynamically limited conversion levels with high stability and selectivity to propylene. This is achieved by preserving the atomic mixing of platinum and tin during reduction and catalytic operation, and the benign interaction of the nanoparticles with the silica support prevents segregation and the formation of tin oxide phases. This catalyst can operate without hydrogen addition, which increases productivity by avoiding the decrease in thermodynamic limits on propane conversion. The synthesis of the catalyst begins with a heterometallic Pt-Sn coordination complex, ensuring that the interaction between Pt and Sn is retained during reduction and the PDH reaction. The catalyst features atomically mixed Pt-Sn precursors, very small intermetallic PtSn nanoparticles upon reduction, and a benign interaction with the silica support that avoids segregation and the formation of a tin oxide phase.

However, these strategies can reduce the efficiency of the process.
          A new catalyst has been developed that operates at thermodynamic limits without the need for hydrogen dilution and exhibits excellent stability and selectivity to propylene. This catalyst is composed of silica-supported Pt1Sn1 nanoparticles, synthesized and pretreated to ensure that the mixing of Pt and Sn is preserved during catalytic operation.
          The principle behind the synthesis of this catalyst is to begin with a heterometallic Pt-Sn coordination complex in which Pt and Sn are in immediate contact, and this interaction is retained during the reduction and PDH reaction.
          The new catalyst operates at thermodynamic limits without the addition of hydrogen to the feed and exhibits excellent stability and selectivity to propylene. The catalyst is composed of silica-supported Pt1Sn1 nanoparticles, synthesized and pretreated to ensure that the mixing of Pt and Sn is preserved during catalytic operation.
          Commercial operations often dilute propane streams to increase the limiting equilibrium conversion, which is higher at lower propane partial pressure, and to limit catalyst deactivation rates. However, this approach requires additional downstream separation units and limits process efficiency.
          Under reaction conditions, the thermodynamic limit on propane conversion is 66.5%. The Pt1Sn1/SiO2 catalyst showed near-thermodynamic conversion of &gt;66% and &gt;99% selectivity to propylene.
          Under harsh conditions, the propane conversion goes from 41 to 39% in 120 min. Under identical conditions, the other tested catalysts deactivate very rapidly to very low conversion. A TEM image of the spent catalyst shows that the Pt-Sn NPs are well dispersed, with an average particle diameter of 1.6  0.67 nm, which is consistent with the particle size in fresh samples.
          The Pt1Sn1/SiO2 catalyst can be partially regenerated by oxidation using 1% O2 as a mild oxidant at 500C followed by reduction at 600C. The regeneration studies showed that the catalysts can be partially regenerated, with 97% of the initial activity and &gt;99% of the initial selectivity after three PDH/regeneration cycles.
          The process of mixing chloroplatinic acid and tin(II) chloride in 0.1 M hydrochloric acid solution formed a heterometallic Pt-Sn coordination complex.
          A bright-field TEM image of Pt-Sn NPs formed on SiO2 upon the reduction of the Pt-Sn complex shows high metal dispersion on the support, with an average NP size of 1.3  0.6 nm. The XRD spectra show that the formed NPs were essentially alloys of Pt and Sn.
          The real-space Pt LIII EXAFS spectra for the Pt1Sn1/SiO2 catalyst are substantially different from the spectra of monometallic Pt and indicate the mixing of Pt and Sn atoms. The best-fit spectrum for the Pt1Sn1/SiO2 catalyst is characterized by the presence of the Pt-Pt and Pt-Sn scattering paths, consistent with the formation of PtSn intermetallic phases.

The document does not provide information on the key strategies and approaches that have been recently developed to enhance the catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes. However, it does discuss the effects of composition and metal particle size on ethane dehydrogenation over PtxSn100x/Mg(Al)O (70  x  100) catalysts. The study found that the specific activity of PtxSn100x/Mg(Al)O for ethane dehydrogenation increases with increasing metal particle size and increasing Sn/Pt ratio. Carbon deposition decreases with decreasing metal particle size and increasing Sn/Pt ratio. These findings suggest that controlling the particle size and composition of the catalyst can improve its stability and performance in dehydrogenation processes.

The literature does not provide specific strategies or approaches for enhancing the catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes. However, it does report the development of a CoSiBeta catalyst with high catalytic activity and selectivity for the direct dehydrogenation of propane to propylene. The catalyst features ultrasmall-sized Co particles confined in the silanols of dealuminated Beta zeolite, which are highly efficient for catalyzing the reaction. The CoOx species within the zeolite can be easily reduced to metallic Co particles under H2 or reactant gas, and these particles are the active sites for the PDH reaction. The high catalytic ability and product selectivity of small confined Co particles are proven, providing novel inspiration for the design of low-cost, ecofriendly, and advanced catalysts for PDH. The earth abundance of Co bodes well for long-term utility, and it has been reported to show a certain degree of catalytic activity for PDH. The literature also discusses the preparation of cobalt catalysts supported on dealuminated Beta (SiBeta) based on Dzwigaj's method, followed by high-temperature calcination in air to obtain CoSiBeta catalysts for PDH. After prereduction under optimum conditions, the 0.5CoSiBeta catalyst (Co loading is 0.5 wt%) showed propane conversion as high as 72% with propylene selectivity of around 92%. The literature suggests that the small metallic Co particles confined in silanols are active sites, and bulk Co3O4 and large Co0 particles on SiBeta support contribute to cracking and carbon deposition, respectively.

The literature does not provide information on the key strategies and approaches that have been recently developed to enhance the catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes. However, it does discuss the promotional effect of Cu on the catalytic performance of Pt/Al2O3 catalysts for propane dehydrogenation. The optimized loading content of Cu is 0.5 wt%, which increases the propylene selectivity to 90.8% with a propylene yield of 36.5%. The origin of the enhanced catalytic performance and anti-coking ability of the PtCu/Al2O3 catalyst is ascribed to the intimate interaction between Pt and Cu, which inhibits propylene adsorption and elevates the energy barrier of CC bond rupture. The inhibited propylene adsorption diminishes the possibility of coke formation and suppresses the cracking reaction towards the formation of lighter hydrocarbons on PtCu/Al2O3, while a higher energy barrier for CC bond cleavage suppresses the methane formation. The literature does not provide information on the key strategies and approaches that have been recently developed to enhance the catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes. However, it does mention that the addition of copper to a platinum-based catalyst improves its catalytic performance and stability for propane dehydrogenation. The optimized loading content of copper is 0.5 wt%, which increases the propylene selectivity to 90.8% with a propylene yield of 36.5%. The improved anti-coking ability of the PtCu/Al2O3 catalysts is due to the inhibition of propylene adsorption, which diminishes the possibility of coke formation and suppresses the cracking reactions towards lighter hydrocarbons on PtCu/Al2O3. Additionally, the copper addition improves propylene selectivity while suppressing methane formation since a higher energy barrier for CC bond cleavage is required on the PtCu/Al2O3 catalyst. The primary origin of the enhancement upon copper addition can be ascribed to the unique PtCu bimetallic interaction.

The literature does not provide information on the key strategies and approaches that have been recently developed to enhance the catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes. However, it does describe the preparation and testing of ZnPt/HZ catalysts with different Zn/Pt ratios supported on high-silica HZSM-5 zeolite for the direct dehydrogenation of propane to propylene (PDH). The optimal 10Zn0.1Pt/HZ catalyst, consisting of 1000 ppm Pt and 10 wt% Zn, shows a high propylene yield (about 46%) and extraordinary dehydrogenation stability over 65 h at 525 C without any regeneration procedure or H2 as auxiliary gas. This catalyst has two kinds of active centers which work corporately: (i) Lewis acidic sites created by framework Zn species and (ii) small-sized PtZn particles. The stable state of the active species and strong carbon resistance of 10Zn0.1Pt/HZ related to the interaction effect between Pt and Zn are confirmed, accounting for the admirable reaction stability of PDH. This catalyst contains much more Zn and less Pt than previously reported PtZn-based dehydrogenation catalysts, breaking the traditional understanding about PtZn catalysts and opening a wide avenue for the design of stable dehydrogenation catalysts.

Recent advancements in catalyst design for direct dehydrogenation processes include the use of Pt-Sn clusters anchored at Al3+penta sites on mesoporous Al2O3 supports. These supports are fabricated with different levels of Al3+penta sites to disperse Pt-Sn2 clusters. The stability and regenerability of the Pt-Sn2/meso-Al2O3 catalysts are strongly dependent on the content of Al3+penta sites, with a high level of these sites effectively preventing the agglomeration of Pt-Sn2 clusters into large Pt nanoparticles during consecutive dehydrogenation-regeneration cycles.

The literature does not provide specific strategies or approaches for enhancing the catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes. However, it does describe the synthesis of ultrafine bimetallic Ga-Pt nanocatalysts encapsulated into silicalite-1 (S-1) zeolites (GaPt@S-1) for propane dehydrogenation (PDH). The confined GaPt alloy nanoclusters within the zeolite are the active sites for PDH reaction, and their high electron density could boost the desorption of products, resulting in a high propene selectivity and formation rate. The restriction of the zeolite can enhance the regeneration stability of the catalyst, and the catalytic activity kept unchanged after four consecutive cycles.

Recent advancements in catalytic stability for supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes include the use of rare-earth-platinum alloy nanoparticles supported on mesoporous zeolites. These catalysts are typically prepared by reducing metal precursor compounds under a hydrogen flow at high temperatures. However, the formation of Pt alloys with rare-earth elements through this method is challenging due to the low chemical potential of rare-earth element oxides. A novel approach uses a mesoporous zeolite with surface framework defects, known as silanol nests, which enable the rare-earth elements to exist as single atomic species with a higher chemical potential. This allows them to diffuse onto Pt, forming stable, highly active, and selective intermetallic compounds for propane dehydrogenation. When applied to late transition metals, this preparation strategy results in Pt alloy catalysts with a large amount of the second metal, such as in the case of the PtCo alloy, which exhibits high catalytic activity and selectivity in the preferential oxidation of carbon monoxide in hydrogen. The industrial PDH process has been using PtSn bimetallic catalysts supported on porous alumina for nearly three decades. However, Pt metal alone exhibits high initial catalytic activity but rapidly deactivates due to coke deposition on the Pt surface, which also causes a loss of catalytic selectivity to propylene. To address these problems, Sn is introduced to form an alloy with Pt nanoparticles, diluting the Pt surface with inactive Sn atoms and breaking up coke-generating Pt ensembles. Researchers have focused on using a siliceous MFI zeolite with a hierarchical micro-/mesoporous structure as a replacement for the alumina support. This zeolite, synthesized using a multi-ammonium surfactant as a structure-directing agent, has attracted attention as an advanced catalyst support due to its unique structure, which comprises ultrathin zeolite frameworks and three-dimensionally interconnected mesopores. These features boost the catalytic performance of supported metals by providing facile reactant and product diffusion and high metal nanoparticle dispersion within the mesopores. The formation of Pt3La and Pt3Y nanoparticles on the degallated zeolite has significantly enhanced the PDH catalytic performance, including activity, selectivity, and durability. Under harsh operating conditions, the conventional PtSn/alumina catalyst experiences severe coke formation and catalyst deactivation within one day. In contrast, the Pt3La intermetallic nanoparticles supported on the degallated zeolite show high initial propane conversion and undergo extremely slow deactivation, retaining 8% conversion even after 30 days of reaction. The PtREE incorporation in the mesoporous zeolite was conducted by co-impregnation of aqueous solutions of Pt and rare-earth element precursors, followed by heating under an O2 flow and subsequently under H2 at high temperatures. The formation of intermetallic compounds, such as Pt3La and Pt3Y, on the degallated zeolite significantly enhances the catalytic performance in terms of activity, selectivity, and durability. The PtREE/zeolite catalysts exhibit high initial propane conversion and slow deactivation, retaining significant conversion even after extended periods of reaction. The presence of a small amount of Ga in the zeolite may also contribute to the catalytic function. These advancements address the challenges in catalyst design, fabrication, and performance optimization by providing a stable and highly active catalyst for industrial applications, particularly in propane dehydrogenation.

Recent strategies to enhance the catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes include oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH), which has the potential to lower the energy requirement for achieving dehydrogenation. ODH can be considered as tandem endothermic (dehydrogenation) and exothermic (oxidation) processes, with an overall thermodynamic summation. Although the process is not thermo-neutral, part of the energy required for the endothermic reaction is augmented by the exothermic reaction. This lower temperature requirement of ODH compared to non-ODH and cracking is encouraging and provides motivation for continued efforts to develop ODH into an industrial technology. However, commercial ODH technologies hinge on innovative catalyst and process design, i.e. proper synergy of the endothermic dehydrogenation step with the exothermic hydrogen combustion and design of selective CH and hydrogen combustion catalysts. Insights about components of the active sites of CH activation can provide a platform for rational design of new efficient catalysts for dehydrogenation of lower alkanes. Recent strategies to enhance the catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes include the use of zeolites as supports to achieve high metal dispersion through cation exchange sites. This approach has been demonstrated with the creation of a Pt/Na[Fe]-ZSM-5 catalyst that exhibits outstanding stability for dehydrogenation of light alkanes. The catalyst's high Pt dispersion (cluster size < 1 mm) on zeolite through ion-exchange and the choice of Fe3+ as an isomorphous cation in place of Al3+ led to weaker Brnsted sites in [Fe]-ZSM compared to [Al]-ZSM, minimizing the tendency of side reactions and resulting in higher alkene selectivity and catalyst stability. Insights into the CH activation mechanisms on different catalysts have also been gained, which can guide the rational design of improved catalysts for C2 and C3 alkane dehydrogenation at lower temperatures. The key strategies and approaches that have been recently developed to enhance the catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes include oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH), which has the potential to lower the energy requirement for achieving dehydrogenation. However, commercial ODH technologies hinge on innovative catalyst and process design, including proper synergy of the endothermic dehydrogenation step with the exothermic hydrogen combustion and design of selective CH and hydrogen combustion catalysts. Despite a large number of reports and many reviews covering different aspects of the subject, and more than two decades of investigations on ODH, gaps still exist between laboratory achievements and industrial implementation.

Recent strategies to enhance the catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes include alloying Ni with Au or Sn to prevent the accumulation of carbon atoms on the surface and hinder the formation of coke. Alloying Ni with Au makes the adsorption of C atoms on the surface less favorable thermodynamically. Alloying Ni with Sn hinders the formation of CC bonds and enhances the formation of CO bonds, leading to the removal of surface C centers as carbon monoxide. This separation of Ni centers on the catalyst surface prevents the formation of coke. Additionally, additives such as potassium, sulfur, gold, or boron can be used to occupy step sites and prevent the formation of graphene islands. Boron can also be used to block sub-surface sites and prevent the formation of a carbidic phase. Sub-surface boron in Ni(111) has a destabilizing effect on on-surface C centers, which helps prevent the accumulation of C atoms on the surface.

Recent advancements in catalyst design for direct dehydrogenation processes include the development of a novel catalyst design concept that involves the double decoration of PtGa intermetallics with Pb and Ca. This strategy synergizes the geometric and electronic promotion effects on the catalyst stability. Pb is deposited on the three-fold Pt3 sites of the PtGa nanoparticles to block them, while Ca is placed around the nanoparticles to provide an electron-enriched single-atom-like Pt1 site. The resulting PtGaCaPb/SiO2 catalyst exhibits outstanding catalytic stability in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) at 600C, with almost no deactivation observed for up to 1 month. This addresses the challenges in catalyst design, fabrication, and performance optimization for industrial applications by providing an ultra-stable catalyst for PDH at high temperatures.

Recent strategies to enhance the catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes include optimizing the dispersion of Pt on the surface of carriers through ion exchange and impregnation, using additives to form alloys with Pt to anchor it on the carrier surface, and selecting carriers with strong interaction with Pt to prevent migration and coalescence. Pt can be loaded into the spaces between the layers of MgAlOx hydrotalcite and enclosed in the interspace of MgAl2O4 spinel to prevent migration. Pt can also be encapsulated in highly siliceous chabazite or coated with Al2O3 through atomic layer deposition to prevent sintering. Pt/MgO and Pt/CeO2 have been found to prevent Pt sintering due to the formation of a Mg2PtO4-like compound and the PtOCe bond, respectively. Atomically dispersed Pt on CeO2 can also prevent sintering. Adding Ga, In, Zn, Cu, Ir, Co to Pt catalysts can have similar effects as Sn in improving stability. B and Si can also play similar roles in preventing sintering and coking. The non-stoichiometric PtB cluster anchored to the carrier via a covalent BO bond can prevent sintering and reduce coke formation. Boration can reduce the binding energy of olefins and the tendency towards coke precursors. Computational screening predicts that Si can modify the selectivity of the Pt catalyst by changing both electronic and geometric properties.

Recent advancements in the design and fabrication of supported metal catalysts for direct dehydrogenation processes have focused on the development of novel synthesis strategies and in situ characterization techniques to provide insights at the atomic and molecular levels. These strategies include the control of metal particle size, the preparation of bimetallic nanoparticles with tailored size and phase, the stabilization of metal sites through strong interactions with supports, the encapsulation of metals in zeolites to prevent sintering, the use of hydrothermal synthesis to maintain porous texture and anchor active metals, the preparation of uniform bimetal nanoparticles, the employment of single-site metal precursors to construct well-defined surface metal species, and the transformation of zeolite structures to stabilize metals. These advancements address the challenges in catalyst design, fabrication, and performance optimization for industrial applications by improving the structural stability, anti-coking ability, and catalytic activity of supported metal catalysts.

Recent strategies to enhance the stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes include the nanopore-encaged metal strategy, wet-chemistry approach, and modification of supports. Modification of supports is particularly effective and simple. For instance, Lu et al. developed a PtSn/Al2O3 sheet catalyst for PDH, which showed high activity, selectivity, and stability due to the stabilization of PtSn clusters by strong metal-support interactions. Ma et al. found that adding Ga to Mg(Al)O layer double hydrotalcites significantly improved the stability of Pt catalysts in PDH, possibly because pentacoordinate Ga3+ ions dispersed and stabilized PtSn clusters, enhancing electronic interactions between Pt and Ga. The importance of support modification was also highlighted in the case of PtSn/CeO2 catalysts. These strategies allow for tuning and enhancement of catalytic activity, selectivity, and unique stability characteristics for bimetallic systems in PDH processes. Recent advancements in enhancing the catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts for direct dehydrogenation processes include the development of highly stable Pt/Sn-Si-beta catalysts using an improved post-synthesis strategy. This strategy involves the dealumination of H-beta zeolite and subsequent metal impregnation. Sn species in tetrahedral coordination states are incorporated into the framework of dealuminated beta (Si-beta), and Pt species are highly dispersed in the form of ultra-small nanoclusters on Pt/Sn-Si-beta due to the strong interaction between Pt and Sn(IV) sites confined in the Si-beta framework. The Pt/Sn-Si-beta catalysts exhibit excellent catalytic performance for propane dehydrogenation (PDH), with a propene formation rate of 2.3 mol g1Pt h1 and a propene selectivity of >99% at 550 C, and a higher propene formation rate of 3.1 mol g1Pt h1 at 600 C. The strong PtSn interactions and the confinement effect of Sn in the Si-beta framework inhibit coke formation and Pt cluster sintering, resulting in good stability of dehydrogenation and regeneration with almost unchanged catalytic activity during four cycles at 550 C. These advancements address the challenges in catalyst design, fabrication, and performance optimization for industrial applications by improving the stability and selectivity of the catalysts.

          Commercial operations often dilute propane streams to increase the limiting equilibrium conversion, which is higher at lower propane partial pressure, and to limit catalyst deactivation rates. However, this approach requires additional downstream separation units and limits process efficiency.
          Under reaction conditions, the thermodynamic limit on propane conversion is 66.5%. The Pt1Sn1/SiO2 catalyst showed near-thermodynamic conversion of &gt;66% and &gt;99% selectivity to propylene.
          Under harsh conditions, the propane conversion goes from 41 to 39% in 120 min. Under identical conditions, the other tested catalysts deactivate very rapidly to very low conversion. A TEM image of the spent catalyst shows that the Pt-Sn NPs are well dispersed, with an average particle diameter of 1.6  0.67 nm, which is consistent with the particle size in fresh samples.
          The Pt1Sn1/SiO2 catalyst can be partially regenerated by oxidation using 1% O2 as a mild oxidant at 500C followed by reduction at 600C. The regeneration studies showed that the catalysts can be partially regenerated, with 97% of the initial activity and &gt;99% of the initial selectivity after three PDH/regeneration cycles.
          The process of mixing chloroplatinic acid and tin(II) chloride in 0.1 M hydrochloric acid solution formed a heterometallic Pt-Sn coordination complex.

          The real-space Pt LIII EXAFS spectra for the Pt1Sn1/SiO2 catalyst are substantially different from the spectra of monometallic Pt and indicate the mixing of Pt and Sn atoms. The best-fit spectrum for the Pt1Sn1/SiO2 catalyst is characterized by the presence of the Pt-Pt and Pt-Sn scattering paths, consistent with the formation of PtSn intermetallic phases.

The document does not provide information on the key strategies and approaches that have been recently developed to enhance the catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes. However, it does discuss the effects of composition and metal particle size on ethane dehydrogenation over PtxSn100x/Mg(Al)O (70  x  100) catalysts. The study found that the specific activity of PtxSn100x/Mg(Al)O for ethane dehydrogenation increases with increasing metal particle size and increasing Sn/Pt ratio. Carbon deposition decreases with decreasing metal particle size and increasing Sn/Pt ratio. These findings suggest that controlling the particle size and composition of the catalyst can improve its stability and performance in dehydrogenation processes.

The literature does not provide specific strategies or approaches for enhancing the catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes. However, it does report the development of a CoSiBeta catalyst with high catalytic activity and selectivity for the direct dehydrogenation of propane to propylene. The catalyst features ultrasmall-sized Co particles confined in the silanols of dealuminated Beta zeolite, which are highly efficient for catalyzing the reaction. The CoOx species within the zeolite can be easily reduced to metallic Co particles under H2 or reactant gas, and these particles are the active sites for the PDH reaction. The high catalytic ability and product selectivity of small confined Co particles are proven, providing novel inspiration for the design of low-cost, ecofriendly, and advanced catalysts for PDH. The earth abundance of Co bodes well for long-term utility, and it has been reported to show a certain degree of catalytic activity for PDH. The literature also discusses the preparation of cobalt catalysts supported on dealuminated Beta (SiBeta) based on Dzwigaj's method, followed by high-temperature calcination in air to obtain CoSiBeta catalysts for PDH. After prereduction under optimum conditions, the 0.5CoSiBeta catalyst (Co loading is 0.5 wt%) showed propane conversion as high as 72% with propylene selectivity of around 92%. The literature suggests that the small metallic Co particles confined in silanols are active sites, and bulk Co3O4 and large Co0 particles on SiBeta support contribute to cracking and carbon deposition, respectively.

The literature does not provide information on the key strategies and approaches that have been recently developed to enhance the catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes. However, it does discuss the promotional effect of Cu on the catalytic performance of Pt/Al2O3 catalysts for propane dehydrogenation. The optimized loading content of Cu is 0.5 wt%, which increases the propylene selectivity to 90.8% with a propylene yield of 36.5%. The origin of the enhanced catalytic performance and anti-coking ability of the PtCu/Al2O3 catalyst is ascribed to the intimate interaction between Pt and Cu, which inhibits propylene adsorption and elevates the energy barrier of CC bond rupture. The inhibited propylene adsorption diminishes the possibility of coke formation and suppresses the cracking reaction towards the formation of lighter hydrocarbons on PtCu/Al2O3, while a higher energy barrier for CC bond cleavage suppresses the methane formation. The literature does not provide information on the key strategies and approaches that have been recently developed to enhance the catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes. However, it does mention that the addition of copper to a platinum-based catalyst improves its catalytic performance and stability for propane dehydrogenation. The optimized loading content of copper is 0.5 wt%, which increases the propylene selectivity to 90.8% with a propylene yield of 36.5%. The improved anti-coking ability of the PtCu/Al2O3 catalysts is due to the inhibition of propylene adsorption, which diminishes the possibility of coke formation and suppresses the cracking reactions towards lighter hydrocarbons on PtCu/Al2O3. Additionally, the copper addition improves propylene selectivity while suppressing methane formation since a higher energy barrier for CC bond cleavage is required on the PtCu/Al2O3 catalyst. The primary origin of the enhancement upon copper addition can be ascribed to the unique PtCu bimetallic interaction.

The literature does not provide information on the key strategies and approaches that have been recently developed to enhance the catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes. However, it does describe the preparation and testing of ZnPt/HZ catalysts with different Zn/Pt ratios supported on high-silica HZSM-5 zeolite for the direct dehydrogenation of propane to propylene (PDH). The optimal 10Zn0.1Pt/HZ catalyst, consisting of 1000 ppm Pt and 10 wt% Zn, shows a high propylene yield (about 46%) and extraordinary dehydrogenation stability over 65 h at 525 C without any regeneration procedure or H2 as auxiliary gas. This catalyst has two kinds of active centers which work corporately: (i) Lewis acidic sites created by framework Zn species and (ii) small-sized PtZn particles. The stable state of the active species and strong carbon resistance of 10Zn0.1Pt/HZ related to the interaction effect between Pt and Zn are confirmed, accounting for the admirable reaction stability of PDH. This catalyst contains much more Zn and less Pt than previously reported PtZn-based dehydrogenation catalysts, breaking the traditional understanding about PtZn catalysts and opening a wide avenue for the design of stable dehydrogenation catalysts.

Recent advancements in catalyst design for direct dehydrogenation processes include the use of Pt-Sn clusters anchored at Al3+penta sites on mesoporous Al2O3 supports. These supports are fabricated with different levels of Al3+penta sites to disperse Pt-Sn2 clusters. The stability and regenerability of the Pt-Sn2/meso-Al2O3 catalysts are strongly dependent on the content of Al3+penta sites, with a high level of these sites effectively preventing the agglomeration of Pt-Sn2 clusters into large Pt nanoparticles during consecutive dehydrogenation-regeneration cycles.

The literature does not provide specific strategies or approaches for enhancing the catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes. However, it does describe the synthesis of ultrafine bimetallic Ga-Pt nanocatalysts encapsulated into silicalite-1 (S-1) zeolites (GaPt@S-1) for propane dehydrogenation (PDH). The confined GaPt alloy nanoclusters within the zeolite are the active sites for PDH reaction, and their high electron density could boost the desorption of products, resulting in a high propene selectivity and formation rate. The restriction of the zeolite can enhance the regeneration stability of the catalyst, and the catalytic activity kept unchanged after four consecutive cycles.

Recent advancements in catalytic stability for supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes include the use of rare-earth-platinum alloy nanoparticles supported on mesoporous zeolites. These catalysts are typically prepared by reducing metal precursor compounds under a hydrogen flow at high temperatures. However, the formation of Pt alloys with rare-earth elements through this method is challenging due to the low chemical potential of rare-earth element oxides. A novel approach uses a mesoporous zeolite with surface framework defects, known as silanol nests, which enable the rare-earth elements to exist as single atomic species with a higher chemical potential. This allows them to diffuse onto Pt, forming stable, highly active, and selective intermetallic compounds for propane dehydrogenation. When applied to late transition metals, this preparation strategy results in Pt alloy catalysts with a large amount of the second metal, such as in the case of the PtCo alloy, which exhibits high catalytic activity and selectivity in the preferential oxidation of carbon monoxide in hydrogen. The industrial PDH process has been using PtSn bimetallic catalysts supported on porous alumina for nearly three decades. However, Pt metal alone exhibits high initial catalytic activity but rapidly deactivates due to coke deposition on the Pt surface, which also causes a loss of catalytic selectivity to propylene. To address these problems, Sn is introduced to form an alloy with Pt nanoparticles, diluting the Pt surface with inactive Sn atoms and breaking up coke-generating Pt ensembles. Researchers have focused on using a siliceous MFI zeolite with a hierarchical micro-/mesoporous structure as a replacement for the alumina support. This zeolite, synthesized using a multi-ammonium surfactant as a structure-directing agent, has attracted attention as an advanced catalyst support due to its unique structure, which comprises ultrathin zeolite frameworks and three-dimensionally interconnected mesopores. These features boost the catalytic performance of supported metals by providing facile reactant and product diffusion and high metal nanoparticle dispersion within the mesopores. The formation of Pt3La and Pt3Y nanoparticles on the degallated zeolite has significantly enhanced the PDH catalytic performance, including activity, selectivity, and durability. Under harsh operating conditions, the conventional PtSn/alumina catalyst experiences severe coke formation and catalyst deactivation within one day. In contrast, the Pt3La intermetallic nanoparticles supported on the degallated zeolite show high initial propane conversion and undergo extremely slow deactivation, retaining 8% conversion even after 30 days of reaction. The PtREE incorporation in the mesoporous zeolite was conducted by co-impregnation of aqueous solutions of Pt and rare-earth element precursors, followed by heating under an O2 flow and subsequently under H2 at high temperatures. The formation of intermetallic compounds, such as Pt3La and Pt3Y, on the degallated zeolite significantly enhances the catalytic performance in terms of activity, selectivity, and durability. The PtREE/zeolite catalysts exhibit high initial propane conversion and slow deactivation, retaining significant conversion even after extended periods of reaction. The presence of a small amount of Ga in the zeolite may also contribute to the catalytic function. These advancements address the challenges in catalyst design, fabrication, and performance optimization by providing a stable and highly active catalyst for industrial applications, particularly in propane dehydrogenation.

Recent strategies to enhance the catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes include oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH), which has the potential to lower the energy requirement for achieving dehydrogenation. ODH can be considered as tandem endothermic (dehydrogenation) and exothermic (oxidation) processes, with an overall thermodynamic summation. Although the process is not thermo-neutral, part of the energy required for the endothermic reaction is augmented by the exothermic reaction. This lower temperature requirement of ODH compared to non-ODH and cracking is encouraging and provides motivation for continued efforts to develop ODH into an industrial technology. However, commercial ODH technologies hinge on innovative catalyst and process design, i.e. proper synergy of the endothermic dehydrogenation step with the exothermic hydrogen combustion and design of selective CH and hydrogen combustion catalysts. Insights about components of the active sites of CH activation can provide a platform for rational design of new efficient catalysts for dehydrogenation of lower alkanes. Recent strategies to enhance the catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes include the use of zeolites as supports to achieve high metal dispersion through cation exchange sites. This approach has been demonstrated with the creation of a Pt/Na[Fe]-ZSM-5 catalyst that exhibits outstanding stability for dehydrogenation of light alkanes. The catalyst's high Pt dispersion (cluster size < 1 mm) on zeolite through ion-exchange and the choice of Fe3+ as an isomorphous cation in place of Al3+ led to weaker Brnsted sites in [Fe]-ZSM compared to [Al]-ZSM, minimizing the tendency of side reactions and resulting in higher alkene selectivity and catalyst stability. Insights into the CH activation mechanisms on different catalysts have also been gained, which can guide the rational design of improved catalysts for C2 and C3 alkane dehydrogenation at lower temperatures. The key strategies and approaches that have been recently developed to enhance the catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes include oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH), which has the potential to lower the energy requirement for achieving dehydrogenation. However, commercial ODH technologies hinge on innovative catalyst and process design, including proper synergy of the endothermic dehydrogenation step with the exothermic hydrogen combustion and design of selective CH and hydrogen combustion catalysts. Despite a large number of reports and many reviews covering different aspects of the subject, and more than two decades of investigations on ODH, gaps still exist between laboratory achievements and industrial implementation.

Recent strategies to enhance the catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes include alloying Ni with Au or Sn to prevent the accumulation of carbon atoms on the surface and hinder the formation of coke. Alloying Ni with Au makes the adsorption of C atoms on the surface less favorable thermodynamically. Alloying Ni with Sn hinders the formation of CC bonds and enhances the formation of CO bonds, leading to the removal of surface C centers as carbon monoxide. This separation of Ni centers on the catalyst surface prevents the formation of coke. Additionally, additives such as potassium, sulfur, gold, or boron can be used to occupy step sites and prevent the formation of graphene islands. Boron can also be used to block sub-surface sites and prevent the formation of a carbidic phase. Sub-surface boron in Ni(111) has a destabilizing effect on on-surface C centers, which helps prevent the accumulation of C atoms on the surface.

Recent advancements in catalyst design for direct dehydrogenation processes include the development of a novel catalyst design concept that involves the double decoration of PtGa intermetallics with Pb and Ca. This strategy synergizes the geometric and electronic promotion effects on the catalyst stability. Pb is deposited on the three-fold Pt3 sites of the PtGa nanoparticles to block them, while Ca is placed around the nanoparticles to provide an electron-enriched single-atom-like Pt1 site. The resulting PtGaCaPb/SiO2 catalyst exhibits outstanding catalytic stability in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) at 600C, with almost no deactivation observed for up to 1 month. This addresses the challenges in catalyst design, fabrication, and performance optimization for industrial applications by providing an ultra-stable catalyst for PDH at high temperatures.

Recent strategies to enhance the catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes include optimizing the dispersion of Pt on the surface of carriers through ion exchange and impregnation, using additives to form alloys with Pt to anchor it on the carrier surface, and selecting carriers with strong interaction with Pt to prevent migration and coalescence. Pt can be loaded into the spaces between the layers of MgAlOx hydrotalcite and enclosed in the interspace of MgAl2O4 spinel to prevent migration. Pt can also be encapsulated in highly siliceous chabazite or coated with Al2O3 through atomic layer deposition to prevent sintering. Pt/MgO and Pt/CeO2 have been found to prevent Pt sintering due to the formation of a Mg2PtO4-like compound and the PtOCe bond, respectively. Atomically dispersed Pt on CeO2 can also prevent sintering. Adding Ga, In, Zn, Cu, Ir, Co to Pt catalysts can have similar effects as Sn in improving stability. B and Si can also play similar roles in preventing sintering and coking. The non-stoichiometric PtB cluster anchored to the carrier via a covalent BO bond can prevent sintering and reduce coke formation. Boration can reduce the binding energy of olefins and the tendency towards coke precursors. Computational screening predicts that Si can modify the selectivity of the Pt catalyst by changing both electronic and geometric properties.

Recent advancements in the design and fabrication of supported metal catalysts for direct dehydrogenation processes have focused on the development of novel synthesis strategies and in situ characterization techniques to provide insights at the atomic and molecular levels. These strategies include the control of metal particle size, the preparation of bimetallic nanoparticles with tailored size and phase, the stabilization of metal sites through strong interactions with supports, the encapsulation of metals in zeolites to prevent sintering, the use of hydrothermal synthesis to maintain porous texture and anchor active metals, the preparation of uniform bimetal nanoparticles, the employment of single-site metal precursors to construct well-defined surface metal species, and the transformation of zeolite structures to stabilize metals. These advancements address the challenges in catalyst design, fabrication, and performance optimization for industrial applications by improving the structural stability, anti-coking ability, and catalytic activity of supported metal catalysts.

Recent strategies to enhance the stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes include the nanopore-encaged metal strategy, wet-chemistry approach, and modification of supports. Modification of supports is particularly effective and simple. For instance, Lu et al. developed a PtSn/Al2O3 sheet catalyst for PDH, which showed high activity, selectivity, and stability due to the stabilization of PtSn clusters by strong metal-support interactions. Ma et al. found that adding Ga to Mg(Al)O layer double hydrotalcites significantly improved the stability of Pt catalysts in PDH, possibly because pentacoordinate Ga3+ ions dispersed and stabilized PtSn clusters, enhancing electronic interactions between Pt and Ga. The importance of support modification was also highlighted in the case of PtSn/CeO2 catalysts. These strategies allow for tuning and enhancement of catalytic activity, selectivity, and unique stability characteristics for bimetallic systems in PDH processes. Recent advancements in enhancing the catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts for direct dehydrogenation processes include the development of highly stable Pt/Sn-Si-beta catalysts using an improved post-synthesis strategy. This strategy involves the dealumination of H-beta zeolite and subsequent metal impregnation. Sn species in tetrahedral coordination states are incorporated into the framework of dealuminated beta (Si-beta), and Pt species are highly dispersed in the form of ultra-small nanoclusters on Pt/Sn-Si-beta due to the strong interaction between Pt and Sn(IV) sites confined in the Si-beta framework. The Pt/Sn-Si-beta catalysts exhibit excellent catalytic performance for propane dehydrogenation (PDH), with a propene formation rate of 2.3 mol g1Pt h1 and a propene selectivity of >99% at 550 C, and a higher propene formation rate of 3.1 mol g1Pt h1 at 600 C. The strong PtSn interactions and the confinement effect of Sn in the Si-beta framework inhibit coke formation and Pt cluster sintering, resulting in good stability of dehydrogenation and regeneration with almost unchanged catalytic activity during four cycles at 550 C. These advancements address the challenges in catalyst design, fabrication, and performance optimization for industrial applications by improving the stability and selectivity of the catalysts.

The introduction of various metals (Ce, In, La, and Fe) as promoters into the Pt/Sn-SBA-15 catalyst can significantly affect the initial activity and catalytic stability for propane dehydrogenation. The promoters can improve the redox property, antisintering ability, and resistance to coke deposition, which are responsible for the catalytic stability. The integrated impacts of these factors determine the overall stability of the catalysts. The introduction of transition metal (Zn), alkaline metal (Na, K), alkaline earth metal (Mg, Ca), and rare earth metal (La, Ce), etc. into the catalysts as promotors offered another strategy to enhance the interaction between Pt and Sn and tune the acid-base property simultaneously. The modified catalyst properties further acted positively in promoting the catalytic performances of propane dehydrogenation. The preparation of various metals (Ce, In, La, and Fe) promoted Pt/Sn-SBA-15 catalysts and their characterization and evaluation in propane dehydrogenation show that the nature of the promoter significantly affects the redox properties, surface composition, and lattice oxygen capacity of the catalysts, which in turn influence the initial activity and catalytic stability in propane dehydrogenation. The In-promoted catalyst exhibited the best performance during the stability test, with a moderate level of coke deposition and the maximum level of surface Pt species. The introduction of In also promoted the reduction of surface Pt oxides and stabilized the metallic Pt particles, leading to higher propylene selectivity and stability.

Recently developed strategies to enhance the catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes include the introduction of promoters to regulate the active compounds in both Pt-based and metal oxide-based catalysts. These advancements address challenges in catalyst design, fabrication, and performance optimization by suppressing side reactions, inhibiting coke deposition, stabilizing active compounds, and improving the dispersion of Pt atoms. Pt-based catalysts have been recognized as effective for alkane dehydrogenation reactions due to their high affinity for paraffinic CH bonds. Metal promoters, such as Sn, Ga, In, Zn, Cu, Co, and rare-earth elements (REEs), have been used to form alloys or intermetallic compounds to ameliorate central active components and inhibit catalytic deactivation. Metal oxide-based catalysts, including CoOx-, ZnOx-, VOx-, and CrOx-based catalysts, have also been extensively studied. Introducing another metal oxide to form an oxide compound can improve the dispersion of active species and enhance catalytic stability by modifying the coordination and electronic state of host metal oxide sites. The introduction of an appropriate metal oxide or noble metal can greatly enhance the catalytic performance.

However, it does describe a specific catalyst system, a boron nitride nanosheet-supported Pt/Cu cluster, which exhibits high efficiency and stability for propane dehydrogenation. The unique geometry of the Pt/Cu cluster, maintained by the strong bonding interaction between copper and edge BO defects on the h-BN nanosheets, is attributed to the remarkable improvement in catalytic efficiency. This system addresses the challenge of minimizing platinum usage while maximizing catalytic activity, which is crucial for industrial applications.

However, it does describe a specific case where a hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) nanosheet-supported Pt/Cu cluster catalyst was used to improve the efficiency of propane dehydrogenation. The catalyst was designed to minimize the use of platinum while maximizing its catalytic activity. The h-BN nanosheets provided a high surface area and abundant edges, which were terminated as amino groups. These characteristics made the h-BN nanosheets an appropriate support for loading the Pt/Cu catalyst. The strong bonding interaction between copper and the edge BO defects of the h-BN nanosheets maintained the unique geometry of the Pt/Cu cluster, leading to remarkable improvement in catalytic efficiency. This approach addresses the challenges in catalyst design, fabrication, and performance optimization for industrial applications by reducing the amount of expensive platinum required while maintaining high catalytic activity.

Recently developed strategies to enhance the catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes include the use of bimetallic catalysts formed by doping promoters such as Sn, In, Ga, and Cu, which can improve the dispersion of Pt and facilitate electron transfer. Another method is to modify the support, such as using ZnO, La2O3, TiO2, or replacing Al2O3 with other oxides. Single atom sites of Pt on a sandwich structure have also been found to be more favorable for PDH reactions than Pt ensembles. PtCu single atom alloys can simultaneously enhance propane conversion and propene selectivity. The goal of these strategies is to obtain highly and stably dispersed Pt-based catalysts to improve PDH performance. However, challenges remain in fully understanding the relationship between Pt, the promoter, and the support, and more efficient methods are needed to solve these problems. The hierarchical morphology and porous structure of catalysts are also being explored to provide more stable and accessible active sites, which can improve the performance of PDH reactions. The reconstruction of hydrotalcite-like compounds has shown promising effects on the microstructure and morphology of 3D oxide nanosheet array catalysts, leading to superior PDH performance.

Recent advancements in catalyst design for direct dehydrogenation processes have focused on developing stable and selective catalysts that can operate at thermodynamic limits. These catalysts, often consisting of platinum-tin alloy nanoparticles supported on alumina, have traditionally required hydrogen dilution to prevent carbon buildup and excess tin to avoid alloy segregation. However, a new approach using silica-supported platinum-tin nanoparticles has been reported to operate at thermodynamically limited conversion levels with high stability and selectivity to propylene. This is achieved by preserving the atomic mixing of platinum and tin during reduction and catalytic operation, and the benign interaction of the nanoparticles with the silica support prevents segregation and the formation of tin oxide phases. This catalyst can operate without hydrogen addition, which increases productivity by avoiding the decrease in thermodynamic limits on propane conversion. The synthesis of the catalyst begins with a heterometallic Pt-Sn coordination complex, ensuring that the interaction between Pt and Sn is retained during reduction and the PDH reaction. The catalyst features atomically mixed Pt-Sn precursors, very small intermetallic PtSn nanoparticles upon reduction, and a benign interaction with the silica support that avoids segregation and the formation of a tin oxide phase.

The literature does not provide information on the key strategies and approaches that have been recently developed to enhance the catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes. However, it does describe the preparation and testing of ZnPt/HZ catalysts with different Zn/Pt ratios supported on high-silica HZSM-5 zeolite for the direct dehydrogenation of propane to propylene (PDH). The optimal 10Zn0.1Pt/HZ catalyst, consisting of 1000 ppm Pt and 10 wt% Zn, shows a high propylene yield (about 46%) and extraordinary dehydrogenation stability over 65 h at 525 C without any regeneration procedure or H2 as auxiliary gas. This catalyst has two kinds of active centers which work corporately: (i) Lewis acidic sites created by framework Zn species and (ii) small-sized PtZn particles. The stable state of the active species and strong carbon resistance of 10Zn0.1Pt/HZ related to the interaction effect between Pt and Zn are confirmed, accounting for the admirable reaction stability of PDH. This catalyst contains much more Zn and less Pt than previously reported PtZn-based dehydrogenation catalysts, breaking the traditional understanding about PtZn catalysts and opening a wide avenue for the design of stable dehydrogenation catalysts.

Recent advancements in catalyst design for direct dehydrogenation processes include the use of Pt-Sn clusters anchored at Al3+penta sites on mesoporous Al2O3 supports. These supports are fabricated with different levels of Al3+penta sites to disperse Pt-Sn2 clusters. The stability and regenerability of the Pt-Sn2/meso-Al2O3 catalysts are strongly dependent on the content of Al3+penta sites, with a high level of these sites effectively preventing the agglomeration of Pt-Sn2 clusters into large Pt nanoparticles during consecutive dehydrogenation-regeneration cycles.

The literature does not provide specific strategies or approaches for enhancing the catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes. However, it does describe the synthesis of ultrafine bimetallic Ga-Pt nanocatalysts encapsulated into silicalite-1 (S-1) zeolites (GaPt@S-1) for propane dehydrogenation (PDH). The confined GaPt alloy nanoclusters within the zeolite are the active sites for PDH reaction, and their high electron density could boost the desorption of products, resulting in a high propene selectivity and formation rate. The restriction of the zeolite can enhance the regeneration stability of the catalyst, and the catalytic activity kept unchanged after four consecutive cycles.

Recent advancements in catalytic stability for supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes include the use of rare-earth-platinum alloy nanoparticles supported on mesoporous zeolites. These catalysts are typically prepared by reducing metal precursor compounds under a hydrogen flow at high temperatures. However, the formation of Pt alloys with rare-earth elements through this method is challenging due to the low chemical potential of rare-earth element oxides. A novel approach uses a mesoporous zeolite with surface framework defects, known as silanol nests, which enable the rare-earth elements to exist as single atomic species with a higher chemical potential. This allows them to diffuse onto Pt, forming stable, highly active, and selective intermetallic compounds for propane dehydrogenation. When applied to late transition metals, this preparation strategy results in Pt alloy catalysts with a large amount of the second metal, such as in the case of the PtCo alloy, which exhibits high catalytic activity and selectivity in the preferential oxidation of carbon monoxide in hydrogen. The industrial PDH process has been using PtSn bimetallic catalysts supported on porous alumina for nearly three decades. However, Pt metal alone exhibits high initial catalytic activity but rapidly deactivates due to coke deposition on the Pt surface, which also causes a loss of catalytic selectivity to propylene. To address these problems, Sn is introduced to form an alloy with Pt nanoparticles, diluting the Pt surface with inactive Sn atoms and breaking up coke-generating Pt ensembles. Researchers have focused on using a siliceous MFI zeolite with a hierarchical micro-/mesoporous structure as a replacement for the alumina support. This zeolite, synthesized using a multi-ammonium surfactant as a structure-directing agent, has attracted attention as an advanced catalyst support due to its unique structure, which comprises ultrathin zeolite frameworks and three-dimensionally interconnected mesopores. These features boost the catalytic performance of supported metals by providing facile reactant and product diffusion and high metal nanoparticle dispersion within the mesopores. The formation of Pt3La and Pt3Y nanoparticles on the degallated zeolite has significantly enhanced the PDH catalytic performance, including activity, selectivity, and durability. Under harsh operating conditions, the conventional PtSn/alumina catalyst experiences severe coke formation and catalyst deactivation within one day. In contrast, the Pt3La intermetallic nanoparticles supported on the degallated zeolite show high initial propane conversion and undergo extremely slow deactivation, retaining 8% conversion even after 30 days of reaction. The PtREE incorporation in the mesoporous zeolite was conducted by co-impregnation of aqueous solutions of Pt and rare-earth element precursors, followed by heating under an O2 flow and subsequently under H2 at high temperatures. The formation of intermetallic compounds, such as Pt3La and Pt3Y, on the degallated zeolite significantly enhances the catalytic performance in terms of activity, selectivity, and durability. The PtREE/zeolite catalysts exhibit high initial propane conversion and slow deactivation, retaining significant conversion even after extended periods of reaction. The presence of a small amount of Ga in the zeolite may also contribute to the catalytic function. These advancements address the challenges in catalyst design, fabrication, and performance optimization by providing a stable and highly active catalyst for industrial applications, particularly in propane dehydrogenation.

Recent strategies to enhance the catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes include oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH), which has the potential to lower the energy requirement for achieving dehydrogenation. ODH can be considered as tandem endothermic (dehydrogenation) and exothermic (oxidation) processes, with an overall thermodynamic summation. Although the process is not thermo-neutral, part of the energy required for the endothermic reaction is augmented by the exothermic reaction. This lower temperature requirement of ODH compared to non-ODH and cracking is encouraging and provides motivation for continued efforts to develop ODH into an industrial technology. However, commercial ODH technologies hinge on innovative catalyst and process design, i.e. proper synergy of the endothermic dehydrogenation step with the exothermic hydrogen combustion and design of selective CH and hydrogen combustion catalysts. Insights about components of the active sites of CH activation can provide a platform for rational design of new efficient catalysts for dehydrogenation of lower alkanes. Recent strategies to enhance the catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes include the use of zeolites as supports to achieve high metal dispersion through cation exchange sites. This approach has been demonstrated with the creation of a Pt/Na[Fe]-ZSM-5 catalyst that exhibits outstanding stability for dehydrogenation of light alkanes. The catalyst's high Pt dispersion (cluster size < 1 mm) on zeolite through ion-exchange and the choice of Fe3+ as an isomorphous cation in place of Al3+ led to weaker Brnsted sites in [Fe]-ZSM compared to [Al]-ZSM, minimizing the tendency of side reactions and resulting in higher alkene selectivity and catalyst stability. Insights into the CH activation mechanisms on different catalysts have also been gained, which can guide the rational design of improved catalysts for C2 and C3 alkane dehydrogenation at lower temperatures. The key strategies and approaches that have been recently developed to enhance the catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes include oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH), which has the potential to lower the energy requirement for achieving dehydrogenation. However, commercial ODH technologies hinge on innovative catalyst and process design, including proper synergy of the endothermic dehydrogenation step with the exothermic hydrogen combustion and design of selective CH and hydrogen combustion catalysts. Despite a large number of reports and many reviews covering different aspects of the subject, and more than two decades of investigations on ODH, gaps still exist between laboratory achievements and industrial implementation.

Recent strategies to enhance the catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes include alloying Ni with Au or Sn to prevent the accumulation of carbon atoms on the surface and hinder the formation of coke. Alloying Ni with Au makes the adsorption of C atoms on the surface less favorable thermodynamically. Alloying Ni with Sn hinders the formation of CC bonds and enhances the formation of CO bonds, leading to the removal of surface C centers as carbon monoxide. This separation of Ni centers on the catalyst surface prevents the formation of coke. Additionally, additives such as potassium, sulfur, gold, or boron can be used to occupy step sites and prevent the formation of graphene islands. Boron can also be used to block sub-surface sites and prevent the formation of a carbidic phase. Sub-surface boron in Ni(111) has a destabilizing effect on on-surface C centers, which helps prevent the accumulation of C atoms on the surface.

Recent advancements in catalyst design for direct dehydrogenation processes include the development of a novel catalyst design concept that involves the double decoration of PtGa intermetallics with Pb and Ca. This strategy synergizes the geometric and electronic promotion effects on the catalyst stability. Pb is deposited on the three-fold Pt3 sites of the PtGa nanoparticles to block them, while Ca is placed around the nanoparticles to provide an electron-enriched single-atom-like Pt1 site. The resulting PtGaCaPb/SiO2 catalyst exhibits outstanding catalytic stability in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) at 600C, with almost no deactivation observed for up to 1 month. This addresses the challenges in catalyst design, fabrication, and performance optimization for industrial applications by providing an ultra-stable catalyst for PDH at high temperatures.

Recent strategies to enhance the catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes include optimizing the dispersion of Pt on the surface of carriers through ion exchange and impregnation, using additives to form alloys with Pt to anchor it on the carrier surface, and selecting carriers with strong interaction with Pt to prevent migration and coalescence. Pt can be loaded into the spaces between the layers of MgAlOx hydrotalcite and enclosed in the interspace of MgAl2O4 spinel to prevent migration. Pt can also be encapsulated in highly siliceous chabazite or coated with Al2O3 through atomic layer deposition to prevent sintering. Pt/MgO and Pt/CeO2 have been found to prevent Pt sintering due to the formation of a Mg2PtO4-like compound and the PtOCe bond, respectively. Atomically dispersed Pt on CeO2 can also prevent sintering. Adding Ga, In, Zn, Cu, Ir, Co to Pt catalysts can have similar effects as Sn in improving stability. B and Si can also play similar roles in preventing sintering and coking. The non-stoichiometric PtB cluster anchored to the carrier via a covalent BO bond can prevent sintering and reduce coke formation. Boration can reduce the binding energy of olefins and the tendency towards coke precursors. Computational screening predicts that Si can modify the selectivity of the Pt catalyst by changing both electronic and geometric properties.

Recent advancements in the design and fabrication of supported metal catalysts for direct dehydrogenation processes have focused on the development of novel synthesis strategies and in situ characterization techniques to provide insights at the atomic and molecular levels. These strategies include the control of metal particle size, the preparation of bimetallic nanoparticles with tailored size and phase, the stabilization of metal sites through strong interactions with supports, the encapsulation of metals in zeolites to prevent sintering, the use of hydrothermal synthesis to maintain porous texture and anchor active metals, the preparation of uniform bimetal nanoparticles, the employment of single-site metal precursors to construct well-defined surface metal species, and the transformation of zeolite structures to stabilize metals. These advancements address the challenges in catalyst design, fabrication, and performance optimization for industrial applications by improving the structural stability, anti-coking ability, and catalytic activity of supported metal catalysts.

Recent strategies to enhance the stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes include the nanopore-encaged metal strategy, wet-chemistry approach, and modification of supports. Modification of supports is particularly effective and simple. For instance, Lu et al. developed a PtSn/Al2O3 sheet catalyst for PDH, which showed high activity, selectivity, and stability due to the stabilization of PtSn clusters by strong metal-support interactions. Ma et al. found that adding Ga to Mg(Al)O layer double hydrotalcites significantly improved the stability of Pt catalysts in PDH, possibly because pentacoordinate Ga3+ ions dispersed and stabilized PtSn clusters, enhancing electronic interactions between Pt and Ga. The importance of support modification was also highlighted in the case of PtSn/CeO2 catalysts. These strategies allow for tuning and enhancement of catalytic activity, selectivity, and unique stability characteristics for bimetallic systems in PDH processes. Recent advancements in enhancing the catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts for direct dehydrogenation processes include the development of highly stable Pt/Sn-Si-beta catalysts using an improved post-synthesis strategy. This strategy involves the dealumination of H-beta zeolite and subsequent metal impregnation. Sn species in tetrahedral coordination states are incorporated into the framework of dealuminated beta (Si-beta), and Pt species are highly dispersed in the form of ultra-small nanoclusters on Pt/Sn-Si-beta due to the strong interaction between Pt and Sn(IV) sites confined in the Si-beta framework. The Pt/Sn-Si-beta catalysts exhibit excellent catalytic performance for propane dehydrogenation (PDH), with a propene formation rate of 2.3 mol g1Pt h1 and a propene selectivity of >99% at 550 C, and a higher propene formation rate of 3.1 mol g1Pt h1 at 600 C. The strong PtSn interactions and the confinement effect of Sn in the Si-beta framework inhibit coke formation and Pt cluster sintering, resulting in good stability of dehydrogenation and regeneration with almost unchanged catalytic activity during four cycles at 550 C. These advancements address the challenges in catalyst design, fabrication, and performance optimization for industrial applications by improving the stability and selectivity of the catalysts.

The introduction of various metals (Ce, In, La, and Fe) as promoters into the Pt/Sn-SBA-15 catalyst can significantly affect the initial activity and catalytic stability for propane dehydrogenation. The promoters can improve the redox property, antisintering ability, and resistance to coke deposition, which are responsible for the catalytic stability. The integrated impacts of these factors determine the overall stability of the catalysts. The introduction of transition metal (Zn), alkaline metal (Na, K), alkaline earth metal (Mg, Ca), and rare earth metal (La, Ce), etc. into the catalysts as promotors offered another strategy to enhance the interaction between Pt and Sn and tune the acid-base property simultaneously. The modified catalyst properties further acted positively in promoting the catalytic performances of propane dehydrogenation. The preparation of various metals (Ce, In, La, and Fe) promoted Pt/Sn-SBA-15 catalysts and their characterization and evaluation in propane dehydrogenation show that the nature of the promoter significantly affects the redox properties, surface composition, and lattice oxygen capacity of the catalysts, which in turn influence the initial activity and catalytic stability in propane dehydrogenation. The In-promoted catalyst exhibited the best performance during the stability test, with a moderate level of coke deposition and the maximum level of surface Pt species. The introduction of In also promoted the reduction of surface Pt oxides and stabilized the metallic Pt particles, leading to higher propylene selectivity and stability.

Recently developed strategies to enhance the catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes include the introduction of promoters to regulate the active compounds in both Pt-based and metal oxide-based catalysts. These advancements address challenges in catalyst design, fabrication, and performance optimization by suppressing side reactions, inhibiting coke deposition, stabilizing active compounds, and improving the dispersion of Pt atoms. Pt-based catalysts have been recognized as effective for alkane dehydrogenation reactions due to their high affinity for paraffinic CH bonds. Metal promoters, such as Sn, Ga, In, Zn, Cu, Co, and rare-earth elements (REEs), have been used to form alloys or intermetallic compounds to ameliorate central active components and inhibit catalytic deactivation. Metal oxide-based catalysts, including CoOx-, ZnOx-, VOx-, and CrOx-based catalysts, have also been extensively studied. Introducing another metal oxide to form an oxide compound can improve the dispersion of active species and enhance catalytic stability by modifying the coordination and electronic state of host metal oxide sites. The introduction of an appropriate metal oxide or noble metal can greatly enhance the catalytic performance.

However, it does describe a specific catalyst system, a boron nitride nanosheet-supported Pt/Cu cluster, which exhibits high efficiency and stability for propane dehydrogenation. The unique geometry of the Pt/Cu cluster, maintained by the strong bonding interaction between copper and edge BO defects on the h-BN nanosheets, is attributed to the remarkable improvement in catalytic efficiency.

The catalyst was designed to minimize the use of platinum while maximizing its catalytic activity. The h-BN nanosheets provided a high surface area and abundant edges, which were terminated as amino groups. These characteristics made the h-BN nanosheets an appropriate support for loading the Pt/Cu catalyst. The strong bonding interaction between copper and the edge BO defects of the h-BN nanosheets maintained the unique geometry of the Pt/Cu cluster, leading to remarkable improvement in catalytic efficiency.

Recently developed strategies to enhance the catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes include the use of bimetallic catalysts formed by doping promoters such as Sn, In, Ga, and Cu, which can improve the dispersion of Pt and facilitate electron transfer. Another method is to modify the support, such as using ZnO, La2O3, TiO2, or replacing Al2O3 with other oxides. Single atom sites of Pt on a sandwich structure have also been found to be more favorable for PDH reactions than Pt ensembles. PtCu single atom alloys can simultaneously enhance propane conversion and propene selectivity. The goal of these strategies is to obtain highly and stably dispersed Pt-based catalysts to improve PDH performance. However, challenges remain in fully understanding the relationship between Pt, the promoter, and the support, and more efficient methods are needed to solve these problems. The hierarchical morphology and porous structure of catalysts are also being explored to provide more stable and accessible active sites, which can improve the performance of PDH reactions. The reconstruction of hydrotalcite-like compounds has shown promising effects on the microstructure and morphology of 3D oxide nanosheet array catalysts, leading to superior PDH performance.

Recent advancements in catalyst design for direct dehydrogenation processes have focused on developing stable and selective catalysts that can operate at thermodynamic limits. These catalysts, often consisting of platinum-tin alloy nanoparticles supported on alumina, have traditionally required hydrogen dilution to prevent carbon buildup and excess tin to avoid alloy segregation. However, a new approach using silica-supported platinum-tin nanoparticles has been reported to operate at thermodynamically limited conversion levels with high stability and selectivity to propylene. This is achieved by preserving the atomic mixing of platinum and tin during reduction and catalytic operation, and the benign interaction of the nanoparticles with the silica support prevents segregation and the formation of tin oxide phases. This catalyst can operate without hydrogen addition, which increases productivity by avoiding the decrease in thermodynamic limits on propane conversion. The synthesis of the catalyst begins with a heterometallic Pt-Sn coordination complex, ensuring that the interaction between Pt and Sn is retained during reduction and the PDH reaction. The catalyst features atomically mixed Pt-Sn precursors, very small intermetallic PtSn nanoparticles upon reduction, and a benign interaction with the silica support that avoids segregation and the formation of a tin oxide phase.

          Commercial operations often dilute propane streams to increase the limiting equilibrium conversion, which is higher at lower propane partial pressure, and to limit catalyst deactivation rates. However, this approach requires additional downstream separation units and limits process efficiency.
          Under reaction conditions, the thermodynamic limit on propane conversion is 66.5%. The Pt1Sn1/SiO2 catalyst showed near-thermodynamic conversion of &gt;66% and &gt;99% selectivity to propylene.
          Under harsh conditions, the propane conversion goes from 41 to 39% in 120 min. Under identical conditions, the other tested catalysts deactivate very rapidly to very low conversion. A TEM image of the spent catalyst shows that the Pt-Sn NPs are well dispersed, with an average particle diameter of 1.6  0.67 nm, which is consistent with the particle size in fresh samples.
          The Pt1Sn1/SiO2 catalyst can be partially regenerated by oxidation using 1% O2 as a mild oxidant at 500C followed by reduction at 600C. The regeneration studies showed that the catalysts can be partially regenerated, with 97% of the initial activity and &gt;99% of the initial selectivity after three PDH/regeneration cycles.
          The process of mixing chloroplatinic acid and tin(II) chloride in 0.1 M hydrochloric acid solution formed a heterometallic Pt-Sn coordination complex.
          A bright-field TEM image of Pt-Sn NPs formed on SiO2 upon the reduction of the Pt-Sn complex shows high metal dispersion on the support, with an average NP size of 1.3  0.6 nm. The XRD spectra show that the formed NPs were essentially alloys of Pt and Sn.
          The real-space Pt LIII EXAFS spectra for the Pt1Sn1/SiO2 catalyst are substantially different from the spectra of monometallic Pt and indicate the mixing of Pt and Sn atoms. The best-fit spectrum for the Pt1Sn1/SiO2 catalyst is characterized by the presence of the Pt-Pt and Pt-Sn scattering paths, consistent with the formation of PtSn intermetallic phases.

However, it does discuss the effects of composition and metal particle size on ethane dehydrogenation over PtxSn100x/Mg(Al)O (70  x  100) catalysts. The study found that the specific activity of PtxSn100x/Mg(Al)O for ethane dehydrogenation increases with increasing metal particle size and increasing Sn/Pt ratio. Carbon deposition decreases with decreasing metal particle size and increasing Sn/Pt ratio. These findings suggest that controlling the particle size and composition of the catalyst can improve its stability and performance in dehydrogenation processes.

The literature does not provide specific strategies or approaches for enhancing the catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes. However, it does report the development of a CoSiBeta catalyst with high catalytic activity and selectivity for the direct dehydrogenation of propane to propylene. The catalyst features ultrasmall-sized Co particles confined in the silanols of dealuminated Beta zeolite, which are highly efficient for catalyzing the reaction. The CoOx species within the zeolite can be easily reduced to metallic Co particles under H2 or reactant gas, and these particles are the active sites for the PDH reaction. The high catalytic ability and product selectivity of small confined Co particles are proven, providing novel inspiration for the design of low-cost, ecofriendly, and advanced catalysts for PDH. The earth abundance of Co bodes well for long-term utility, and it has been reported to show a certain degree of catalytic activity for PDH. The literature also discusses the preparation of cobalt catalysts supported on dealuminated Beta (SiBeta) based on Dzwigaj's method, followed by high-temperature calcination in air to obtain CoSiBeta catalysts for PDH. After prereduction under optimum conditions, the 0.5CoSiBeta catalyst (Co loading is 0.5 wt%) showed propane conversion as high as 72% with propylene selectivity of around 92%. The literature suggests that the small metallic Co particles confined in silanols are active sites, and bulk Co3O4 and large Co0 particles on SiBeta support contribute to cracking and carbon deposition, respectively.

The optimized loading content of Cu is 0.5 wt%, which increases the propylene selectivity to 90.8% with a propylene yield of 36.5%. The origin of the enhanced catalytic performance and anti-coking ability of the PtCu/Al2O3 catalyst is ascribed to the intimate interaction between Pt and Cu, which inhibits propylene adsorption and elevates the energy barrier of CC bond rupture. The inhibited propylene adsorption diminishes the possibility of coke formation and suppresses the cracking reaction towards the formation of lighter hydrocarbons on PtCu/Al2O3, while a higher energy barrier for CC bond cleavage suppresses the methane formation.

The catalyst's high Pt dispersion (cluster size < 1 mm) on zeolite through ion-exchange and the choice of Fe3+ as an isomorphous cation in place of Al3+ led to weaker Brnsted sites in [Fe]-ZSM compared to [Al]-ZSM, minimizing the tendency of side reactions and resulting in higher alkene selectivity and catalyst stability. Insights into the CH activation mechanisms on different catalysts have also been gained, which can guide the rational design of improved catalysts for C2 and C3 alkane dehydrogenation at lower temperatures. The key strategies and approaches that have been recently developed to enhance the catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes include oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH), which has the potential to lower the energy requirement for achieving dehydrogenation. However, commercial ODH technologies hinge on innovative catalyst and process design, including proper synergy of the endothermic dehydrogenation step with the exothermic hydrogen combustion and design of selective CH and hydrogen combustion catalysts. Despite a large number of reports and many reviews covering different aspects of the subject, and more than two decades of investigations on ODH, gaps still exist between laboratory achievements and industrial implementation.

Recent strategies to enhance the catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes include alloying Ni with Au or Sn to prevent the accumulation of carbon atoms on the surface and hinder the formation of coke. Alloying Ni with Au makes the adsorption of C atoms on the surface less favorable thermodynamically. Alloying Ni with Sn hinders the formation of CC bonds and enhances the formation of CO bonds, leading to the removal of surface C centers as carbon monoxide. This separation of Ni centers on the catalyst surface prevents the formation of coke. Additionally, additives such as potassium, sulfur, gold, or boron can be used to occupy step sites and prevent the formation of graphene islands. Boron can also be used to block sub-surface sites and prevent the formation of a carbidic phase. Sub-surface boron in Ni(111) has a destabilizing effect on on-surface C centers, which helps prevent the accumulation of C atoms on the surface.

Recent advancements in catalyst design for direct dehydrogenation processes include the development of a novel catalyst design concept that involves the double decoration of PtGa intermetallics with Pb and Ca. This strategy synergizes the geometric and electronic promotion effects on the catalyst stability. Pb is deposited on the three-fold Pt3 sites of the PtGa nanoparticles to block them, while Ca is placed around the nanoparticles to provide an electron-enriched single-atom-like Pt1 site. The resulting PtGaCaPb/SiO2 catalyst exhibits outstanding catalytic stability in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) at 600C, with almost no deactivation observed for up to 1 month. This addresses the challenges in catalyst design, fabrication, and performance optimization for industrial applications by providing an ultra-stable catalyst for PDH at high temperatures.

Recent strategies to enhance the catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes include optimizing the dispersion of Pt on the surface of carriers through ion exchange and impregnation, using additives to form alloys with Pt to anchor it on the carrier surface, and selecting carriers with strong interaction with Pt to prevent migration and coalescence. Pt can be loaded into the spaces between the layers of MgAlOx hydrotalcite and enclosed in the interspace of MgAl2O4 spinel to prevent migration. Pt can also be encapsulated in highly siliceous chabazite or coated with Al2O3 through atomic layer deposition to prevent sintering. Pt/MgO and Pt/CeO2 have been found to prevent Pt sintering due to the formation of a Mg2PtO4-like compound and the PtOCe bond, respectively. Atomically dispersed Pt on CeO2 can also prevent sintering. Adding Ga, In, Zn, Cu, Ir, Co to Pt catalysts can have similar effects as Sn in improving stability. B and Si can also play similar roles in preventing sintering and coking. The non-stoichiometric PtB cluster anchored to the carrier via a covalent BO bond can prevent sintering and reduce coke formation. Boration can reduce the binding energy of olefins and the tendency towards coke precursors. Computational screening predicts that Si can modify the selectivity of the Pt catalyst by changing both electronic and geometric properties.

Recent advancements in the design and fabrication of supported metal catalysts for direct dehydrogenation processes have focused on the development of novel synthesis strategies and in situ characterization techniques to provide insights at the atomic and molecular levels. These strategies include the control of metal particle size, the preparation of bimetallic nanoparticles with tailored size and phase, the stabilization of metal sites through strong interactions with supports, the encapsulation of metals in zeolites to prevent sintering, the use of hydrothermal synthesis to maintain porous texture and anchor active metals, the preparation of uniform bimetal nanoparticles, the employment of single-site metal precursors to construct well-defined surface metal species, and the transformation of zeolite structures to stabilize metals.

Recent strategies to enhance the stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes include the nanopore-encaged metal strategy, wet-chemistry approach, and modification of supports. Modification of supports is particularly effective and simple. For instance, Lu et al. developed a PtSn/Al2O3 sheet catalyst for PDH, which showed high activity, selectivity, and stability due to the stabilization of PtSn clusters by strong metal-support interactions. Ma et al. found that adding Ga to Mg(Al)O layer double hydrotalcites significantly improved the stability of Pt catalysts in PDH, possibly because pentacoordinate Ga3+ ions dispersed and stabilized PtSn clusters, enhancing electronic interactions between Pt and Ga. The importance of support modification was also highlighted in the case of PtSn/CeO2 catalysts. These strategies allow for tuning and enhancement of catalytic activity, selectivity, and unique stability characteristics for bimetallic systems in PDH processes. Recent advancements in enhancing the catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts for direct dehydrogenation processes include the development of highly stable Pt/Sn-Si-beta catalysts using an improved post-synthesis strategy. This strategy involves the dealumination of H-beta zeolite and subsequent metal impregnation. Sn species in tetrahedral coordination states are incorporated into the framework of dealuminated beta (Si-beta), and Pt species are highly dispersed in the form of ultra-small nanoclusters on Pt/Sn-Si-beta due to the strong interaction between Pt and Sn(IV) sites confined in the Si-beta framework. The Pt/Sn-Si-beta catalysts exhibit excellent catalytic performance for propane dehydrogenation (PDH), with a propene formation rate of 2.3 mol g1Pt h1 and a propene selectivity of >99% at 550 C, and a higher propene formation rate of 3.1 mol g1Pt h1 at 600 C. The strong PtSn interactions and the confinement effect of Sn in the Si-beta framework inhibit coke formation and Pt cluster sintering, resulting in good stability of dehydrogenation and regeneration with almost unchanged catalytic activity during four cycles at 550 C. These advancements address the challenges in catalyst design, fabrication, and performance optimization for industrial applications by improving the stability and selectivity of the catalysts.

The introduction of various metals (Ce, In, La, and Fe) as promoters into the Pt/Sn-SBA-15 catalyst can significantly affect the initial activity and catalytic stability for propane dehydrogenation. The promoters can improve the redox property, antisintering ability, and resistance to coke deposition, which are responsible for the catalytic stability. The integrated impacts of these factors determine the overall stability of the catalysts. The introduction of transition metal (Zn), alkaline metal (Na, K), alkaline earth metal (Mg, Ca), and rare earth metal (La, Ce), etc. into the catalysts as promotors offered another strategy to enhance the interaction between Pt and Sn and tune the acid-base property simultaneously. The modified catalyst properties further acted positively in promoting the catalytic performances of propane dehydrogenation. The preparation of various metals (Ce, In, La, and Fe) promoted Pt/Sn-SBA-15 catalysts and their characterization and evaluation in propane dehydrogenation show that the nature of the promoter significantly affects the redox properties, surface composition, and lattice oxygen capacity of the catalysts, which in turn influence the initial activity and catalytic stability in propane dehydrogenation. The In-promoted catalyst exhibited the best performance during the stability test, with a moderate level of coke deposition and the maximum level of surface Pt species. The introduction of In also promoted the reduction of surface Pt oxides and stabilized the metallic Pt particles, leading to higher propylene selectivity and stability.

Recently developed strategies to enhance the catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes include the introduction of promoters to regulate the active compounds in both Pt-based and metal oxide-based catalysts. These advancements address challenges in catalyst design, fabrication, and performance optimization by suppressing side reactions, inhibiting coke deposition, stabilizing active compounds, and improving the dispersion of Pt atoms. Pt-based catalysts have been recognized as effective for alkane dehydrogenation reactions due to their high affinity for paraffinic CH bonds. Metal promoters, such as Sn, Ga, In, Zn, Cu, Co, and rare-earth elements (REEs), have been used to form alloys or intermetallic compounds to ameliorate central active components and inhibit catalytic deactivation. Metal oxide-based catalysts, including CoOx-, ZnOx-, VOx-, and CrOx-based catalysts, have also been extensively studied. Introducing another metal oxide to form an oxide compound can improve the dispersion of active species and enhance catalytic stability by modifying the coordination and electronic state of host metal oxide sites. The introduction of an appropriate metal oxide or noble metal can greatly enhance the catalytic performance.

However, it does describe a specific catalyst system, a boron nitride nanosheet-supported Pt/Cu cluster, which exhibits high efficiency and stability for propane dehydrogenation. The unique geometry of the Pt/Cu cluster, maintained by the strong bonding interaction between copper and edge BO defects on the h-BN nanosheets, is attributed to the remarkable improvement in catalytic efficiency. This system addresses the challenge of minimizing platinum usage while maximizing catalytic activity, which is crucial for industrial applications.

The catalyst was designed to minimize the use of platinum while maximizing its catalytic activity. The h-BN nanosheets provided a high surface area and abundant edges, which were terminated as amino groups. These characteristics made the h-BN nanosheets an appropriate support for loading the Pt/Cu catalyst. The strong bonding interaction between copper and the edge BO defects of the h-BN nanosheets maintained the unique geometry of the Pt/Cu cluster, leading to remarkable improvement in catalytic efficiency. This approach addresses the challenges in catalyst design, fabrication, and performance optimization for industrial applications by reducing the amount of expensive platinum required while maintaining high catalytic activity.

Recently developed strategies to enhance the catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes include the use of bimetallic catalysts formed by doping promoters such as Sn, In, Ga, and Cu, which can improve the dispersion of Pt and facilitate electron transfer. Another method is to modify the support, such as using ZnO, La2O3, TiO2, or replacing Al2O3 with other oxides. Single atom sites of Pt on a sandwich structure have also been found to be more favorable for PDH reactions than Pt ensembles. PtCu single atom alloys can simultaneously enhance propane conversion and propene selectivity. The goal of these strategies is to obtain highly and stably dispersed Pt-based catalysts to improve PDH performance. However, challenges remain in fully understanding the relationship between Pt, the promoter, and the support, and more efficient methods are needed to solve these problems. The hierarchical morphology and porous structure of catalysts are also being explored to provide more stable and accessible active sites, which can improve the performance of PDH reactions. The reconstruction of hydrotalcite-like compounds has shown promising effects on the microstructure and morphology of 3D oxide nanosheet array catalysts, leading to superior PDH performance.

Recent advancements in catalyst design for direct dehydrogenation processes have focused on developing stable and selective catalysts that can operate at thermodynamic limits. These catalysts, often consisting of platinum-tin alloy nanoparticles supported on alumina, have traditionally required hydrogen dilution to prevent carbon buildup and excess tin to avoid alloy segregation. However, a new approach using silica-supported platinum-tin nanoparticles has been reported to operate at thermodynamically limited conversion levels with high stability and selectivity to propylene. This is achieved by preserving the atomic mixing of platinum and tin during reduction and catalytic operation, and the benign interaction of the nanoparticles with the silica support prevents segregation and the formation of tin oxide phases. This catalyst can operate without hydrogen addition, which increases productivity by avoiding the decrease in thermodynamic limits on propane conversion. The synthesis of the catalyst begins with a heterometallic Pt-Sn coordination complex, ensuring that the interaction between Pt and Sn is retained during reduction and the PDH reaction. The catalyst features atomically mixed Pt-Sn precursors, very small intermetallic PtSn nanoparticles upon reduction, and a benign interaction with the silica support that avoids segregation and the formation of a tin oxide phase.

These catalysts, consisting of platinum-tin alloy nanoparticles supported on alumina, often require hydrogen dilution to prevent carbon buildup and excess tin to avoid alloy segregation. However, these strategies can reduce the efficiency of the process.
          A new catalyst has been developed that operates at thermodynamic limits without the need for hydrogen dilution and exhibits excellent stability and selectivity to propylene. This catalyst is composed of silica-supported Pt1Sn1 nanoparticles, synthesized and pretreated to ensure that the mixing of Pt and Sn is preserved during catalytic operation.
          The principle behind the synthesis of this catalyst is to begin with a heterometallic Pt-Sn coordination complex in which Pt and Sn are in immediate contact, and this interaction is retained during the reduction and PDH reaction.
          The new catalyst operates at thermodynamic limits without the addition of hydrogen to the feed and exhibits excellent stability and selectivity to propylene. The catalyst is composed of silica-supported Pt1Sn1 nanoparticles, synthesized and pretreated to ensure that the mixing of Pt and Sn is preserved during catalytic operation.
          Commercial operations often dilute propane streams to increase the limiting equilibrium conversion, which is higher at lower propane partial pressure, and to limit catalyst deactivation rates. However, this approach requires additional downstream separation units and limits process efficiency.
          Under reaction conditions, the thermodynamic limit on propane conversion is 66.5%. The Pt1Sn1/SiO2 catalyst showed near-thermodynamic conversion of &gt;66% and &gt;99% selectivity to propylene.
          Under harsh conditions, the propane conversion goes from 41 to 39% in 120 min. Under identical conditions, the other tested catalysts deactivate very rapidly to very low conversion. A TEM image of the spent catalyst shows that the Pt-Sn NPs are well dispersed, with an average particle diameter of 1.6  0.67 nm, which is consistent with the particle size in fresh samples.
          The Pt1Sn1/SiO2 catalyst can be partially regenerated by oxidation using 1% O2 as a mild oxidant at 500C followed by reduction at 600C. The regeneration studies showed that the catalysts can be partially regenerated, with 97% of the initial activity and &gt;99% of the initial selectivity after three PDH/regeneration cycles.
          The process of mixing chloroplatinic acid and tin(II) chloride in 0.1 M hydrochloric acid solution formed a heterometallic Pt-Sn coordination complex.
          A bright-field TEM image of Pt-Sn NPs formed on SiO2 upon the reduction of the Pt-Sn complex shows high metal dispersion on the support, with an average NP size of 1.3  0.6 nm. The XRD spectra show that the formed NPs were essentially alloys of Pt and Sn.
          The real-space Pt LIII EXAFS spectra for the Pt1Sn1/SiO2 catalyst are substantially different from the spectra of monometallic Pt and indicate the mixing of Pt and Sn atoms. The best-fit spectrum for the Pt1Sn1/SiO2 catalyst is characterized by the presence of the Pt-Pt and Pt-Sn scattering paths, consistent with the formation of PtSn intermetallic phases.

The document does not provide information on the key strategies and approaches that have been recently developed to enhance the catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes. However, it does discuss the effects of composition and metal particle size on ethane dehydrogenation over PtxSn100x/Mg(Al)O (70  x  100) catalysts. The study found that the specific activity of PtxSn100x/Mg(Al)O for ethane dehydrogenation increases with increasing metal particle size and increasing Sn/Pt ratio. Carbon deposition decreases with decreasing metal particle size and increasing Sn/Pt ratio. These findings suggest that controlling the particle size and composition of the catalyst can improve its stability and performance in dehydrogenation processes.

The literature does not provide specific strategies or approaches for enhancing the catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes. However, it does report the development of a CoSiBeta catalyst with high catalytic activity and selectivity for the direct dehydrogenation of propane to propylene. The catalyst features ultrasmall-sized Co particles confined in the silanols of dealuminated Beta zeolite, which are highly efficient for catalyzing the reaction. The CoOx species within the zeolite can be easily reduced to metallic Co particles under H2 or reactant gas, and these particles are the active sites for the PDH reaction. The high catalytic ability and product selectivity of small confined Co particles are proven, providing novel inspiration for the design of low-cost, ecofriendly, and advanced catalysts for PDH. The earth abundance of Co bodes well for long-term utility, and it has been reported to show a certain degree of catalytic activity for PDH. The literature also discusses the preparation of cobalt catalysts supported on dealuminated Beta (SiBeta) based on Dzwigaj's method, followed by high-temperature calcination in air to obtain CoSiBeta catalysts for PDH. After prereduction under optimum conditions, the 0.5CoSiBeta catalyst (Co loading is 0.5 wt%) showed propane conversion as high as 72% with propylene selectivity of around 92%. The literature suggests that the small metallic Co particles confined in silanols are active sites, and bulk Co3O4 and large Co0 particles on SiBeta support contribute to cracking and carbon deposition, respectively.

The literature does not provide information on the key strategies and approaches that have been recently developed to enhance the catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes. However, it does discuss the promotional effect of Cu on the catalytic performance of Pt/Al2O3 catalysts for propane dehydrogenation. The optimized loading content of Cu is 0.5 wt%, which increases the propylene selectivity to 90.8% with a propylene yield of 36.5%. The origin of the enhanced catalytic performance and anti-coking ability of the PtCu/Al2O3 catalyst is ascribed to the intimate interaction between Pt and Cu, which inhibits propylene adsorption and elevates the energy barrier of CC bond rupture. The inhibited propylene adsorption diminishes the possibility of coke formation and suppresses the cracking reaction towards the formation of lighter hydrocarbons on PtCu/Al2O3, while a higher energy barrier for CC bond cleavage suppresses the methane formation. The literature does not provide information on the key strategies and approaches that have been recently developed to enhance the catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes. However, it does mention that the addition of copper to a platinum-based catalyst improves its catalytic performance and stability for propane dehydrogenation. The optimized loading content of copper is 0.5 wt%, which increases the propylene selectivity to 90.8% with a propylene yield of 36.5%. The improved anti-coking ability of the PtCu/Al2O3 catalysts is due to the inhibition of propylene adsorption, which diminishes the possibility of coke formation and suppresses the cracking reactions towards lighter hydrocarbons on PtCu/Al2O3. Additionally, the copper addition improves propylene selectivity while suppressing methane formation since a higher energy barrier for CC bond cleavage is required on the PtCu/Al2O3 catalyst. The primary origin of the enhancement upon copper addition can be ascribed to the unique PtCu bimetallic interaction.

The literature does not provide information on the key strategies and approaches that have been recently developed to enhance the catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes. However, it does describe the preparation and testing of ZnPt/HZ catalysts with different Zn/Pt ratios supported on high-silica HZSM-5 zeolite for the direct dehydrogenation of propane to propylene (PDH). The optimal 10Zn0.1Pt/HZ catalyst, consisting of 1000 ppm Pt and 10 wt% Zn, shows a high propylene yield (about 46%) and extraordinary dehydrogenation stability over 65 h at 525 C without any regeneration procedure or H2 as auxiliary gas. This catalyst has two kinds of active centers which work corporately: (i) Lewis acidic sites created by framework Zn species and (ii) small-sized PtZn particles. The stable state of the active species and strong carbon resistance of 10Zn0.1Pt/HZ related to the interaction effect between Pt and Zn are confirmed, accounting for the admirable reaction stability of PDH. This catalyst contains much more Zn and less Pt than previously reported PtZn-based dehydrogenation catalysts, breaking the traditional understanding about PtZn catalysts and opening a wide avenue for the design of stable dehydrogenation catalysts.

Recent advancements in catalyst design for direct dehydrogenation processes include the use of Pt-Sn clusters anchored at Al3+penta sites on mesoporous Al2O3 supports. These supports are fabricated with different levels of Al3+penta sites to disperse Pt-Sn2 clusters. The stability and regenerability of the Pt-Sn2/meso-Al2O3 catalysts are strongly dependent on the content of Al3+penta sites, with a high level of these sites effectively preventing the agglomeration of Pt-Sn2 clusters into large Pt nanoparticles during consecutive dehydrogenation-regeneration cycles.

The literature does not provide specific strategies or approaches for enhancing the catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes. However, it does describe the synthesis of ultrafine bimetallic Ga-Pt nanocatalysts encapsulated into silicalite-1 (S-1) zeolites (GaPt@S-1) for propane dehydrogenation (PDH). The confined GaPt alloy nanoclusters within the zeolite are the active sites for PDH reaction, and their high electron density could boost the desorption of products, resulting in a high propene selectivity and formation rate. The restriction of the zeolite can enhance the regeneration stability of the catalyst, and the catalytic activity kept unchanged after four consecutive cycles.

Recent advancements in catalytic stability for supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes include the use of rare-earth-platinum alloy nanoparticles supported on mesoporous zeolites. These catalysts are typically prepared by reducing metal precursor compounds under a hydrogen flow at high temperatures. However, the formation of Pt alloys with rare-earth elements through this method is challenging due to the low chemical potential of rare-earth element oxides. A novel approach uses a mesoporous zeolite with surface framework defects, known as silanol nests, which enable the rare-earth elements to exist as single atomic species with a higher chemical potential. This allows them to diffuse onto Pt, forming stable, highly active, and selective intermetallic compounds for propane dehydrogenation. When applied to late transition metals, this preparation strategy results in Pt alloy catalysts with a large amount of the second metal, such as in the case of the PtCo alloy, which exhibits high catalytic activity and selectivity in the preferential oxidation of carbon monoxide in hydrogen. The industrial PDH process has been using PtSn bimetallic catalysts supported on porous alumina for nearly three decades. However, Pt metal alone exhibits high initial catalytic activity but rapidly deactivates due to coke deposition on the Pt surface, which also causes a loss of catalytic selectivity to propylene. To address these problems, Sn is introduced to form an alloy with Pt nanoparticles, diluting the Pt surface with inactive Sn atoms and breaking up coke-generating Pt ensembles. Researchers have focused on using a siliceous MFI zeolite with a hierarchical micro-/mesoporous structure as a replacement for the alumina support. This zeolite, synthesized using a multi-ammonium surfactant as a structure-directing agent, has attracted attention as an advanced catalyst support due to its unique structure, which comprises ultrathin zeolite frameworks and three-dimensionally interconnected mesopores. These features boost the catalytic performance of supported metals by providing facile reactant and product diffusion and high metal nanoparticle dispersion within the mesopores. The formation of Pt3La and Pt3Y nanoparticles on the degallated zeolite has significantly enhanced the PDH catalytic performance, including activity, selectivity, and durability. Under harsh operating conditions, the conventional PtSn/alumina catalyst experiences severe coke formation and catalyst deactivation within one day. In contrast, the Pt3La intermetallic nanoparticles supported on the degallated zeolite show high initial propane conversion and undergo extremely slow deactivation, retaining 8% conversion even after 30 days of reaction. The PtREE incorporation in the mesoporous zeolite was conducted by co-impregnation of aqueous solutions of Pt and rare-earth element precursors, followed by heating under an O2 flow and subsequently under H2 at high temperatures. The formation of intermetallic compounds, such as Pt3La and Pt3Y, on the degallated zeolite significantly enhances the catalytic performance in terms of activity, selectivity, and durability. The PtREE/zeolite catalysts exhibit high initial propane conversion and slow deactivation, retaining significant conversion even after extended periods of reaction. The presence of a small amount of Ga in the zeolite may also contribute to the catalytic function. These advancements address the challenges in catalyst design, fabrication, and performance optimization by providing a stable and highly active catalyst for industrial applications, particularly in propane dehydrogenation.

Recent strategies to enhance the catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes include oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH), which has the potential to lower the energy requirement for achieving dehydrogenation. ODH can be considered as tandem endothermic (dehydrogenation) and exothermic (oxidation) processes, with an overall thermodynamic summation. Although the process is not thermo-neutral, part of the energy required for the endothermic reaction is augmented by the exothermic reaction. This lower temperature requirement of ODH compared to non-ODH and cracking is encouraging and provides motivation for continued efforts to develop ODH into an industrial technology. However, commercial ODH technologies hinge on innovative catalyst and process design, i.e. proper synergy of the endothermic dehydrogenation step with the exothermic hydrogen combustion and design of selective CH and hydrogen combustion catalysts. Insights about components of the active sites of CH activation can provide a platform for rational design of new efficient catalysts for dehydrogenation of lower alkanes.

The introduction of various metals (Ce, In, La, and Fe) as promoters into the Pt/Sn-SBA-15 catalyst can significantly affect the initial activity and catalytic stability for propane dehydrogenation. The promoters can improve the redox property, antisintering ability, and resistance to coke deposition, which are responsible for the catalytic stability. The integrated impacts of these factors determine the overall stability of the catalysts. The introduction of transition metal (Zn), alkaline metal (Na, K), alkaline earth metal (Mg, Ca), and rare earth metal (La, Ce), etc. into the catalysts as promotors offered another strategy to enhance the interaction between Pt and Sn and tune the acid-base property simultaneously. The modified catalyst properties further acted positively in promoting the catalytic performances of propane dehydrogenation. The preparation of various metals (Ce, In, La, and Fe) promoted Pt/Sn-SBA-15 catalysts and their characterization and evaluation in propane dehydrogenation show that the nature of the promoter significantly affects the redox properties, surface composition, and lattice oxygen capacity of the catalysts, which in turn influence the initial activity and catalytic stability in propane dehydrogenation. The In-promoted catalyst exhibited the best performance during the stability test, with a moderate level of coke deposition and the maximum level of surface Pt species. The introduction of In also promoted the reduction of surface Pt oxides and stabilized the metallic Pt particles, leading to higher propylene selectivity and stability.

Recently developed strategies to enhance the catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes include the introduction of promoters to regulate the active compounds in both Pt-based and metal oxide-based catalysts. These advancements address challenges in catalyst design, fabrication, and performance optimization by suppressing side reactions, inhibiting coke deposition, stabilizing active compounds, and improving the dispersion of Pt atoms. Pt-based catalysts have been recognized as effective for alkane dehydrogenation reactions due to their high affinity for paraffinic CH bonds. Metal promoters, such as Sn, Ga, In, Zn, Cu, Co, and rare-earth elements (REEs), have been used to form alloys or intermetallic compounds to ameliorate central active components and inhibit catalytic deactivation. Metal oxide-based catalysts, including CoOx-, ZnOx-, VOx-, and CrOx-based catalysts, have also been extensively studied. Introducing another metal oxide to form an oxide compound can improve the dispersion of active species and enhance catalytic stability by modifying the coordination and electronic state of host metal oxide sites. The introduction of an appropriate metal oxide or noble metal can greatly enhance the catalytic performance.

Recently developed strategies to enhance the catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes include the use of bimetallic catalysts formed by doping promoters such as Sn, In, Ga, and Cu, which can improve the dispersion of Pt and facilitate electron transfer. Another method is to modify the support, such as using ZnO, La2O3, TiO2, or replacing Al2O3 with other oxides. Single atom sites of Pt on a sandwich structure have also been found to be more favorable for PDH reactions than Pt ensembles. PtCu single atom alloys can simultaneously enhance propane conversion and propene selectivity. The goal of these strategies is to obtain highly and stably dispersed Pt-based catalysts to improve PDH performance. However, challenges remain in fully understanding the relationship between Pt, the promoter, and the support, and more efficient methods are needed to solve these problems. The hierarchical morphology and porous structure of catalysts are also being explored to provide more stable and accessible active sites, which can improve the performance of PDH reactions. The reconstruction of hydrotalcite-like compounds has shown promising effects on the microstructure and morphology of 3D oxide nanosheet array catalysts, leading to superior PDH performance.

Recent advancements in catalyst design for direct dehydrogenation processes have focused on developing stable and selective catalysts that can operate at thermodynamic limits. These catalysts, often consisting of platinum-tin alloy nanoparticles supported on alumina, have traditionally required hydrogen dilution to prevent carbon buildup and excess tin to avoid alloy segregation. However, a new approach using silica-supported platinum-tin nanoparticles has been reported to operate at thermodynamically limited conversion levels with high stability and selectivity to propylene. This is achieved by preserving the atomic mixing of platinum and tin during reduction and catalytic operation, and the benign interaction of the nanoparticles with the silica support prevents segregation and the formation of tin oxide phases. This catalyst can operate without hydrogen addition, which increases productivity by avoiding the decrease in thermodynamic limits on propane conversion. The synthesis of the catalyst begins with a heterometallic Pt-Sn coordination complex, ensuring that the interaction between Pt and Sn is retained during reduction and the PDH reaction. The catalyst features atomically mixed Pt-Sn precursors, very small intermetallic PtSn nanoparticles upon reduction, and a benign interaction with the silica support that avoids segregation and the formation of a tin oxide phase.

However, these strategies can reduce the efficiency of the process.
          A new catalyst has been developed that operates at thermodynamic limits without the need for hydrogen dilution and exhibits excellent stability and selectivity to propylene. This catalyst is composed of silica-supported Pt1Sn1 nanoparticles, synthesized and pretreated to ensure that the mixing of Pt and Sn is preserved during catalytic operation.
          The principle behind the synthesis of this catalyst is to begin with a heterometallic Pt-Sn coordination complex in which Pt and Sn are in immediate contact, and this interaction is retained during the reduction and PDH reaction.
          The new catalyst operates at thermodynamic limits without the addition of hydrogen to the feed and exhibits excellent stability and selectivity to propylene. The catalyst is composed of silica-supported Pt1Sn1 nanoparticles, synthesized and pretreated to ensure that the mixing of Pt and Sn is preserved during catalytic operation.
          Commercial operations often dilute propane streams to increase the limiting equilibrium conversion, which is higher at lower propane partial pressure, and to limit catalyst deactivation rates. However, this approach requires additional downstream separation units and limits process efficiency.
          Under reaction conditions, the thermodynamic limit on propane conversion is 66.5%. The Pt1Sn1/SiO2 catalyst showed near-thermodynamic conversion of &gt;66% and &gt;99% selectivity to propylene.
          Under harsh conditions, the propane conversion goes from 41 to 39% in 120 min. Under identical conditions, the other tested catalysts deactivate very rapidly to very low conversion. A TEM image of the spent catalyst shows that the Pt-Sn NPs are well dispersed, with an average particle diameter of 1.6  0.67 nm, which is consistent with the particle size in fresh samples.
          The Pt1Sn1/SiO2 catalyst can be partially regenerated by oxidation using 1% O2 as a mild oxidant at 500C followed by reduction at 600C. The regeneration studies showed that the catalysts can be partially regenerated, with 97% of the initial activity and &gt;99% of the initial selectivity after three PDH/regeneration cycles.
          The process of mixing chloroplatinic acid and tin(II) chloride in 0.1 M hydrochloric acid solution formed a heterometallic Pt-Sn coordination complex.
          A bright-field TEM image of Pt-Sn NPs formed on SiO2 upon the reduction of the Pt-Sn complex shows high metal dispersion on the support, with an average NP size of 1.3  0.6 nm. The XRD spectra show that the formed NPs were essentially alloys of Pt and Sn.
          The real-space Pt LIII EXAFS spectra for the Pt1Sn1/SiO2 catalyst are substantially different from the spectra of monometallic Pt and indicate the mixing of Pt and Sn atoms. The best-fit spectrum for the Pt1Sn1/SiO2 catalyst is characterized by the presence of the Pt-Pt and Pt-Sn scattering paths, consistent with the formation of PtSn intermetallic phases.

The document does not provide information on the key strategies and approaches that have been recently developed to enhance the catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes. However, it does discuss the effects of composition and metal particle size on ethane dehydrogenation over PtxSn100x/Mg(Al)O (70  x  100) catalysts. The study found that the specific activity of PtxSn100x/Mg(Al)O for ethane dehydrogenation increases with increasing metal particle size and increasing Sn/Pt ratio. Carbon deposition decreases with decreasing metal particle size and increasing Sn/Pt ratio. These findings suggest that controlling the particle size and composition of the catalyst can improve its stability and performance in dehydrogenation processes.

The literature does not provide specific strategies or approaches for enhancing the catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes. However, it does report the development of a CoSiBeta catalyst with high catalytic activity and selectivity for the direct dehydrogenation of propane to propylene. The catalyst features ultrasmall-sized Co particles confined in the silanols of dealuminated Beta zeolite, which are highly efficient for catalyzing the reaction. The CoOx species within the zeolite can be easily reduced to metallic Co particles under H2 or reactant gas, and these particles are the active sites for the PDH reaction. The high catalytic ability and product selectivity of small confined Co particles are proven, providing novel inspiration for the design of low-cost, ecofriendly, and advanced catalysts for PDH. The earth abundance of Co bodes well for long-term utility, and it has been reported to show a certain degree of catalytic activity for PDH. The literature also discusses the preparation of cobalt catalysts supported on dealuminated Beta (SiBeta) based on Dzwigaj's method, followed by high-temperature calcination in air to obtain CoSiBeta catalysts for PDH. After prereduction under optimum conditions, the 0.5CoSiBeta catalyst (Co loading is 0.5 wt%) showed propane conversion as high as 72% with propylene selectivity of around 92%. The literature suggests that the small metallic Co particles confined in silanols are active sites, and bulk Co3O4 and large Co0 particles on SiBeta support contribute to cracking and carbon deposition, respectively.

The literature does not provide information on the key strategies and approaches that have been recently developed to enhance the catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes. However, it does discuss the promotional effect of Cu on the catalytic performance of Pt/Al2O3 catalysts for propane dehydrogenation. The optimized loading content of Cu is 0.5 wt%, which increases the propylene selectivity to 90.8% with a propylene yield of 36.5%. The origin of the enhanced catalytic performance and anti-coking ability of the PtCu/Al2O3 catalyst is ascribed to the intimate interaction between Pt and Cu, which inhibits propylene adsorption and elevates the energy barrier of CC bond rupture. The inhibited propylene adsorption diminishes the possibility of coke formation and suppresses the cracking reaction towards the formation of lighter hydrocarbons on PtCu/Al2O3, while a higher energy barrier for CC bond cleavage suppresses the methane formation. The literature does not provide information on the key strategies and approaches that have been recently developed to enhance the catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes. However, it does mention that the addition of copper to a platinum-based catalyst improves its catalytic performance and stability for propane dehydrogenation. The optimized loading content of copper is 0.5 wt%, which increases the propylene selectivity to 90.8% with a propylene yield of 36.5%. The improved anti-coking ability of the PtCu/Al2O3 catalysts is due to the inhibition of propylene adsorption, which diminishes the possibility of coke formation and suppresses the cracking reactions towards lighter hydrocarbons on PtCu/Al2O3. Additionally, the copper addition improves propylene selectivity while suppressing methane formation since a higher energy barrier for CC bond cleavage is required on the PtCu/Al2O3 catalyst. The primary origin of the enhancement upon copper addition can be ascribed to the unique PtCu bimetallic interaction.

The literature does not provide information on the key strategies and approaches that have been recently developed to enhance the catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes. However, it does describe the preparation and testing of ZnPt/HZ catalysts with different Zn/Pt ratios supported on high-silica HZSM-5 zeolite for the direct dehydrogenation of propane to propylene (PDH). The optimal 10Zn0.1Pt/HZ catalyst, consisting of 1000 ppm Pt and 10 wt% Zn, shows a high propylene yield (about 46%) and extraordinary dehydrogenation stability over 65 h at 525 C without any regeneration procedure or H2 as auxiliary gas. This catalyst has two kinds of active centers which work corporately: (i) Lewis acidic sites created by framework Zn species and (ii) small-sized PtZn particles. The stable state of the active species and strong carbon resistance of 10Zn0.1Pt/HZ related to the interaction effect between Pt and Zn are confirmed, accounting for the admirable reaction stability of PDH. This catalyst contains much more Zn and less Pt than previously reported PtZn-based dehydrogenation catalysts, breaking the traditional understanding about PtZn catalysts and opening a wide avenue for the design of stable dehydrogenation catalysts.

Recent advancements in catalyst design for direct dehydrogenation processes include the use of Pt-Sn clusters anchored at Al3+penta sites on mesoporous Al2O3 supports. These supports are fabricated with different levels of Al3+penta sites to disperse Pt-Sn2 clusters. The stability and regenerability of the Pt-Sn2/meso-Al2O3 catalysts are strongly dependent on the content of Al3+penta sites, with a high level of these sites effectively preventing the agglomeration of Pt-Sn2 clusters into large Pt nanoparticles during consecutive dehydrogenation-regeneration cycles.

The literature does not provide specific strategies or approaches for enhancing the catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes. However, it does describe the synthesis of ultrafine bimetallic Ga-Pt nanocatalysts encapsulated into silicalite-1 (S-1) zeolites (GaPt@S-1) for propane dehydrogenation (PDH). The confined GaPt alloy nanoclusters within the zeolite are the active sites for PDH reaction, and their high electron density could boost the desorption of products, resulting in a high propene selectivity and formation rate. The restriction of the zeolite can enhance the regeneration stability of the catalyst, and the catalytic activity kept unchanged after four consecutive cycles.

Recent advancements in catalytic stability for supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes include the use of rare-earth-platinum alloy nanoparticles supported on mesoporous zeolites. These catalysts are typically prepared by reducing metal precursor compounds under a hydrogen flow at high temperatures. However, the formation of Pt alloys with rare-earth elements through this method is challenging due to the low chemical potential of rare-earth element oxides. A novel approach uses a mesoporous zeolite with surface framework defects, known as silanol nests, which enable the rare-earth elements to exist as single atomic species with a higher chemical potential. This allows them to diffuse onto Pt, forming stable, highly active, and selective intermetallic compounds for propane dehydrogenation. When applied to late transition metals, this preparation strategy results in Pt alloy catalysts with a large amount of the second metal, such as in the case of the PtCo alloy, which exhibits high catalytic activity and selectivity in the preferential oxidation of carbon monoxide in hydrogen. The industrial PDH process has been using PtSn bimetallic catalysts supported on porous alumina for nearly three decades. However, Pt metal alone exhibits high initial catalytic activity but rapidly deactivates due to coke deposition on the Pt surface, which also causes a loss of catalytic selectivity to propylene. To address these problems, Sn is introduced to form an alloy with Pt nanoparticles, diluting the Pt surface with inactive Sn atoms and breaking up coke-generating Pt ensembles. Researchers have focused on using a siliceous MFI zeolite with a hierarchical micro-/mesoporous structure as a replacement for the alumina support. This zeolite, synthesized using a multi-ammonium surfactant as a structure-directing agent, has attracted attention as an advanced catalyst support due to its unique structure, which comprises ultrathin zeolite frameworks and three-dimensionally interconnected mesopores. These features boost the catalytic performance of supported metals by providing facile reactant and product diffusion and high metal nanoparticle dispersion within the mesopores. The formation of Pt3La and Pt3Y nanoparticles on the degallated zeolite has significantly enhanced the PDH catalytic performance, including activity, selectivity, and durability. Under harsh operating conditions, the conventional PtSn/alumina catalyst experiences severe coke formation and catalyst deactivation within one day. In contrast, the Pt3La intermetallic nanoparticles supported on the degallated zeolite show high initial propane conversion and undergo extremely slow deactivation, retaining 8% conversion even after 30 days of reaction. The PtREE incorporation in the mesoporous zeolite was conducted by co-impregnation of aqueous solutions of Pt and rare-earth element precursors, followed by heating under an O2 flow and subsequently under H2 at high temperatures. The formation of intermetallic compounds, such as Pt3La and Pt3Y, on the degallated zeolite significantly enhances the catalytic performance in terms of activity, selectivity, and durability. The PtREE/zeolite catalysts exhibit high initial propane conversion and slow deactivation, retaining significant conversion even after extended periods of reaction. The presence of a small amount of Ga in the zeolite may also contribute to the catalytic function. These advancements address the challenges in catalyst design, fabrication, and performance optimization by providing a stable and highly active catalyst for industrial applications, particularly in propane dehydrogenation.

Recent strategies to enhance the catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes include oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH), which has the potential to lower the energy requirement for achieving dehydrogenation. ODH can be considered as tandem endothermic (dehydrogenation) and exothermic (oxidation) processes, with an overall thermodynamic summation. Although the process is not thermo-neutral, part of the energy required for the endothermic reaction is augmented by the exothermic reaction. This lower temperature requirement of ODH compared to non-ODH and cracking is encouraging and provides motivation for continued efforts to develop ODH into an industrial technology. However, commercial ODH technologies hinge on innovative catalyst and process design, i.e. proper synergy of the endothermic dehydrogenation step with the exothermic hydrogen combustion and design of selective CH and hydrogen combustion catalysts. Insights about components of the active sites of CH activation can provide a platform for rational design of new efficient catalysts for dehydrogenation of lower alkanes. Recent strategies to enhance the catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes include the use of zeolites as supports to achieve high metal dispersion through cation exchange sites. This approach has been demonstrated with the creation of a Pt/Na[Fe]-ZSM-5 catalyst that exhibits outstanding stability for dehydrogenation of light alkanes. The catalyst's high Pt dispersion (cluster size < 1 mm) on zeolite through ion-exchange and the choice of Fe3+ as an isomorphous cation in place of Al3+ led to weaker Brnsted sites in [Fe]-ZSM compared to [Al]-ZSM, minimizing the tendency of side reactions and resulting in higher alkene selectivity and catalyst stability. Insights into the CH activation mechanisms on different catalysts have also been gained, which can guide the rational design of improved catalysts for C2 and C3 alkane dehydrogenation at lower temperatures. The key strategies and approaches that have been recently developed to enhance the catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes include oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH), which has the potential to lower the energy requirement for achieving dehydrogenation. However, commercial ODH technologies hinge on innovative catalyst and process design, including proper synergy of the endothermic dehydrogenation step with the exothermic hydrogen combustion and design of selective CH and hydrogen combustion catalysts. Despite a large number of reports and many reviews covering different aspects of the subject, and more than two decades of investigations on ODH, gaps still exist between laboratory achievements and industrial implementation.

Recent strategies to enhance the catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes include alloying Ni with Au or Sn to prevent the accumulation of carbon atoms on the surface and hinder the formation of coke. Alloying Ni with Au makes the adsorption of C atoms on the surface less favorable thermodynamically. Alloying Ni with Sn hinders the formation of CC bonds and enhances the formation of CO bonds, leading to the removal of surface C centers as carbon monoxide. This separation of Ni centers on the catalyst surface prevents the formation of coke. Additionally, additives such as potassium, sulfur, gold, or boron can be used to occupy step sites and prevent the formation of graphene islands. Boron can also be used to block sub-surface sites and prevent the formation of a carbidic phase. Sub-surface boron in Ni(111) has a destabilizing effect on on-surface C centers, which helps prevent the accumulation of C atoms on the surface.

Recent advancements in catalyst design for direct dehydrogenation processes include the development of a novel catalyst design concept that involves the double decoration of PtGa intermetallics with Pb and Ca. This strategy synergizes the geometric and electronic promotion effects on the catalyst stability. Pb is deposited on the three-fold Pt3 sites of the PtGa nanoparticles to block them, while Ca is placed around the nanoparticles to provide an electron-enriched single-atom-like Pt1 site. The resulting PtGaCaPb/SiO2 catalyst exhibits outstanding catalytic stability in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) at 600C, with almost no deactivation observed for up to 1 month. This addresses the challenges in catalyst design, fabrication, and performance optimization for industrial applications by providing an ultra-stable catalyst for PDH at high temperatures.

Recent strategies to enhance the catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes include optimizing the dispersion of Pt on the surface of carriers through ion exchange and impregnation, using additives to form alloys with Pt to anchor it on the carrier surface, and selecting carriers with strong interaction with Pt to prevent migration and coalescence. Pt can be loaded into the spaces between the layers of MgAlOx hydrotalcite and enclosed in the interspace of MgAl2O4 spinel to prevent migration. Pt can also be encapsulated in highly siliceous chabazite or coated with Al2O3 through atomic layer deposition to prevent sintering. Pt/MgO and Pt/CeO2 have been found to prevent Pt sintering due to the formation of a Mg2PtO4-like compound and the PtOCe bond, respectively. Atomically dispersed Pt on CeO2 can also prevent sintering. Adding Ga, In, Zn, Cu, Ir, Co to Pt catalysts can have similar effects as Sn in improving stability. B and Si can also play similar roles in preventing sintering and coking. The non-stoichiometric PtB cluster anchored to the carrier via a covalent BO bond can prevent sintering and reduce coke formation. Boration can reduce the binding energy of olefins and the tendency towards coke precursors. Computational screening predicts that Si can modify the selectivity of the Pt catalyst by changing both electronic and geometric properties.

Recent advancements in the design and fabrication of supported metal catalysts for direct dehydrogenation processes have focused on the development of novel synthesis strategies and in situ characterization techniques to provide insights at the atomic and molecular levels. These strategies include the control of metal particle size, the preparation of bimetallic nanoparticles with tailored size and phase, the stabilization of metal sites through strong interactions with supports, the encapsulation of metals in zeolites to prevent sintering, the use of hydrothermal synthesis to maintain porous texture and anchor active metals, the preparation of uniform bimetal nanoparticles, the employment of single-site metal precursors to construct well-defined surface metal species, and the transformation of zeolite structures to stabilize metals. These advancements address the challenges in catalyst design, fabrication, and performance optimization for industrial applications by improving the structural stability, anti-coking ability, and catalytic activity of supported metal catalysts.

Recent strategies to enhance the stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes include the nanopore-encaged metal strategy, wet-chemistry approach, and modification of supports. Modification of supports is particularly effective and simple. For instance, Lu et al. developed a PtSn/Al2O3 sheet catalyst for PDH, which showed high activity, selectivity, and stability due to the stabilization of PtSn clusters by strong metal-support interactions. Ma et al. found that adding Ga to Mg(Al)O layer double hydrotalcites significantly improved the stability of Pt catalysts in PDH, possibly because pentacoordinate Ga3+ ions dispersed and stabilized PtSn clusters, enhancing electronic interactions between Pt and Ga. The importance of support modification was also highlighted in the case of PtSn/CeO2 catalysts. These strategies allow for tuning and enhancement of catalytic activity, selectivity, and unique stability characteristics for bimetallic systems in PDH processes. Recent advancements in enhancing the catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts for direct dehydrogenation processes include the development of highly stable Pt/Sn-Si-beta catalysts using an improved post-synthesis strategy. This strategy involves the dealumination of H-beta zeolite and subsequent metal impregnation. Sn species in tetrahedral coordination states are incorporated into the framework of dealuminated beta (Si-beta), and Pt species are highly dispersed in the form of ultra-small nanoclusters on Pt/Sn-Si-beta due to the strong interaction between Pt and Sn(IV) sites confined in the Si-beta framework. The Pt/Sn-Si-beta catalysts exhibit excellent catalytic performance for propane dehydrogenation (PDH), with a propene formation rate of 2.3 mol g1Pt h1 and a propene selectivity of >99% at 550 C, and a higher propene formation rate of 3.1 mol g1Pt h1 at 600 C. The strong PtSn interactions and the confinement effect of Sn in the Si-beta framework inhibit coke formation and Pt cluster sintering, resulting in good stability of dehydrogenation and regeneration with almost unchanged catalytic activity during four cycles at 550 C. These advancements address the challenges in catalyst design, fabrication, and performance optimization for industrial applications by improving the stability and selectivity of the catalysts.

The introduction of In also promoted the reduction of surface Pt oxides and stabilized the metallic Pt particles, leading to higher propylene selectivity and stability.

However, these strategies can reduce the efficiency of the process.
          A new catalyst has been developed that operates at thermodynamic limits without the need for hydrogen dilution and exhibits excellent stability and selectivity to propylene. This catalyst is composed of silica-supported Pt1Sn1 nanoparticles, synthesized and pretreated to ensure that the mixing of Pt and Sn is preserved during catalytic operation.
          The principle behind the synthesis of this catalyst is to begin with a heterometallic Pt-Sn coordination complex in which Pt and Sn are in immediate contact, and this interaction is retained during the reduction and PDH reaction.

          Commercial operations often dilute propane streams to increase the limiting equilibrium conversion, which is higher at lower propane partial pressure, and to limit catalyst deactivation rates. However, this approach requires additional downstream separation units and limits process efficiency.
          Under reaction conditions, the thermodynamic limit on propane conversion is 66.5%. The Pt1Sn1/SiO2 catalyst showed near-thermodynamic conversion of &gt;66% and &gt;99% selectivity to propylene.
          Under harsh conditions, the propane conversion goes from 41 to 39% in 120 min. Under identical conditions, the other tested catalysts deactivate very rapidly to very low conversion. A TEM image of the spent catalyst shows that the Pt-Sn NPs are well dispersed, with an average particle diameter of 1.6  0.67 nm, which is consistent with the particle size in fresh samples.
          The Pt1Sn1/SiO2 catalyst can be partially regenerated by oxidation using 1% O2 as a mild oxidant at 500C followed by reduction at 600C. The regeneration studies showed that the catalysts can be partially regenerated, with 97% of the initial activity and &gt;99% of the initial selectivity after three PDH/regeneration cycles.
          The process of mixing chloroplatinic acid and tin(II) chloride in 0.1 M hydrochloric acid solution formed a heterometallic Pt-Sn coordination complex.
          A bright-field TEM image of Pt-Sn NPs formed on SiO2 upon the reduction of the Pt-Sn complex shows high metal dispersion on the support, with an average NP size of 1.3  0.6 nm. The XRD spectra show that the formed NPs were essentially alloys of Pt and Sn.
          The real-space Pt LIII EXAFS spectra for the Pt1Sn1/SiO2 catalyst are substantially different from the spectra of monometallic Pt and indicate the mixing of Pt and Sn atoms. The best-fit spectrum for the Pt1Sn1/SiO2 catalyst is characterized by the presence of the Pt-Pt and Pt-Sn scattering paths, consistent with the formation of PtSn intermetallic phases.

The document does not provide information on the key strategies and approaches that have been recently developed to enhance the catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes. However, it does discuss the effects of composition and metal particle size on ethane dehydrogenation over PtxSn100x/Mg(Al)O (70  x  100) catalysts. The study found that the specific activity of PtxSn100x/Mg(Al)O for ethane dehydrogenation increases with increasing metal particle size and increasing Sn/Pt ratio. Carbon deposition decreases with decreasing metal particle size and increasing Sn/Pt ratio. These findings suggest that controlling the particle size and composition of the catalyst can improve its stability and performance in dehydrogenation processes.

The literature does not provide specific strategies or approaches for enhancing the catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes. However, it does report the development of a CoSiBeta catalyst with high catalytic activity and selectivity for the direct dehydrogenation of propane to propylene. The catalyst features ultrasmall-sized Co particles confined in the silanols of dealuminated Beta zeolite, which are highly efficient for catalyzing the reaction. The CoOx species within the zeolite can be easily reduced to metallic Co particles under H2 or reactant gas, and these particles are the active sites for the PDH reaction. The high catalytic ability and product selectivity of small confined Co particles are proven, providing novel inspiration for the design of low-cost, ecofriendly, and advanced catalysts for PDH. The earth abundance of Co bodes well for long-term utility, and it has been reported to show a certain degree of catalytic activity for PDH. The literature also discusses the preparation of cobalt catalysts supported on dealuminated Beta (SiBeta) based on Dzwigaj's method, followed by high-temperature calcination in air to obtain CoSiBeta catalysts for PDH. After prereduction under optimum conditions, the 0.5CoSiBeta catalyst (Co loading is 0.5 wt%) showed propane conversion as high as 72% with propylene selectivity of around 92%. The literature suggests that the small metallic Co particles confined in silanols are active sites, and bulk Co3O4 and large Co0 particles on SiBeta support contribute to cracking and carbon deposition, respectively.

The literature does not provide information on the key strategies and approaches that have been recently developed to enhance the catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes. However, it does discuss the promotional effect of Cu on the catalytic performance of Pt/Al2O3 catalysts for propane dehydrogenation. The optimized loading content of Cu is 0.5 wt%, which increases the propylene selectivity to 90.8% with a propylene yield of 36.5%. The origin of the enhanced catalytic performance and anti-coking ability of the PtCu/Al2O3 catalyst is ascribed to the intimate interaction between Pt and Cu, which inhibits propylene adsorption and elevates the energy barrier of CC bond rupture. The inhibited propylene adsorption diminishes the possibility of coke formation and suppresses the cracking reaction towards the formation of lighter hydrocarbons on PtCu/Al2O3, while a higher energy barrier for CC bond cleavage suppresses the methane formation. The literature does not provide information on the key strategies and approaches that have been recently developed to enhance the catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes. However, it does mention that the addition of copper to a platinum-based catalyst improves its catalytic performance and stability for propane dehydrogenation. The optimized loading content of copper is 0.5 wt%, which increases the propylene selectivity to 90.8% with a propylene yield of 36.5%. The improved anti-coking ability of the PtCu/Al2O3 catalysts is due to the inhibition of propylene adsorption, which diminishes the possibility of coke formation and suppresses the cracking reactions towards lighter hydrocarbons on PtCu/Al2O3. Additionally, the copper addition improves propylene selectivity while suppressing methane formation since a higher energy barrier for CC bond cleavage is required on the PtCu/Al2O3 catalyst. The primary origin of the enhancement upon copper addition can be ascribed to the unique PtCu bimetallic interaction.

The literature does not provide information on the key strategies and approaches that have been recently developed to enhance the catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes. However, it does describe the preparation and testing of ZnPt/HZ catalysts with different Zn/Pt ratios supported on high-silica HZSM-5 zeolite for the direct dehydrogenation of propane to propylene (PDH). The optimal 10Zn0.1Pt/HZ catalyst, consisting of 1000 ppm Pt and 10 wt% Zn, shows a high propylene yield (about 46%) and extraordinary dehydrogenation stability over 65 h at 525 C without any regeneration procedure or H2 as auxiliary gas. This catalyst has two kinds of active centers which work corporately: (i) Lewis acidic sites created by framework Zn species and (ii) small-sized PtZn particles. The stable state of the active species and strong carbon resistance of 10Zn0.1Pt/HZ related to the interaction effect between Pt and Zn are confirmed, accounting for the admirable reaction stability of PDH. This catalyst contains much more Zn and less Pt than previously reported PtZn-based dehydrogenation catalysts, breaking the traditional understanding about PtZn catalysts and opening a wide avenue for the design of stable dehydrogenation catalysts.

Recent advancements in catalyst design for direct dehydrogenation processes include the use of Pt-Sn clusters anchored at Al3+penta sites on mesoporous Al2O3 supports. These supports are fabricated with different levels of Al3+penta sites to disperse Pt-Sn2 clusters. The stability and regenerability of the Pt-Sn2/meso-Al2O3 catalysts are strongly dependent on the content of Al3+penta sites, with a high level of these sites effectively preventing the agglomeration of Pt-Sn2 clusters into large Pt nanoparticles during consecutive dehydrogenation-regeneration cycles.

The literature does not provide specific strategies or approaches for enhancing the catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes. However, it does describe the synthesis of ultrafine bimetallic Ga-Pt nanocatalysts encapsulated into silicalite-1 (S-1) zeolites (GaPt@S-1) for propane dehydrogenation (PDH). The confined GaPt alloy nanoclusters within the zeolite are the active sites for PDH reaction, and their high electron density could boost the desorption of products, resulting in a high propene selectivity and formation rate. The restriction of the zeolite can enhance the regeneration stability of the catalyst, and the catalytic activity kept unchanged after four consecutive cycles.

Recent advancements in catalytic stability for supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes include the use of rare-earth-platinum alloy nanoparticles supported on mesoporous zeolites. These catalysts are typically prepared by reducing metal precursor compounds under a hydrogen flow at high temperatures. However, the formation of Pt alloys with rare-earth elements through this method is challenging due to the low chemical potential of rare-earth element oxides. A novel approach uses a mesoporous zeolite with surface framework defects, known as silanol nests, which enable the rare-earth elements to exist as single atomic species with a higher chemical potential. This allows them to diffuse onto Pt, forming stable, highly active, and selective intermetallic compounds for propane dehydrogenation. When applied to late transition metals, this preparation strategy results in Pt alloy catalysts with a large amount of the second metal, such as in the case of the PtCo alloy, which exhibits high catalytic activity and selectivity in the preferential oxidation of carbon monoxide in hydrogen. The industrial PDH process has been using PtSn bimetallic catalysts supported on porous alumina for nearly three decades. However, Pt metal alone exhibits high initial catalytic activity but rapidly deactivates due to coke deposition on the Pt surface, which also causes a loss of catalytic selectivity to propylene. To address these problems, Sn is introduced to form an alloy with Pt nanoparticles, diluting the Pt surface with inactive Sn atoms and breaking up coke-generating Pt ensembles. Researchers have focused on using a siliceous MFI zeolite with a hierarchical micro-/mesoporous structure as a replacement for the alumina support. This zeolite, synthesized using a multi-ammonium surfactant as a structure-directing agent, has attracted attention as an advanced catalyst support due to its unique structure, which comprises ultrathin zeolite frameworks and three-dimensionally interconnected mesopores. These features boost the catalytic performance of supported metals by providing facile reactant and product diffusion and high metal nanoparticle dispersion within the mesopores. The formation of Pt3La and Pt3Y nanoparticles on the degallated zeolite has significantly enhanced the PDH catalytic performance, including activity, selectivity, and durability. Under harsh operating conditions, the conventional PtSn/alumina catalyst experiences severe coke formation and catalyst deactivation within one day. In contrast, the Pt3La intermetallic nanoparticles supported on the degallated zeolite show high initial propane conversion and undergo extremely slow deactivation, retaining 8% conversion even after 30 days of reaction. The PtREE incorporation in the mesoporous zeolite was conducted by co-impregnation of aqueous solutions of Pt and rare-earth element precursors, followed by heating under an O2 flow and subsequently under H2 at high temperatures. The formation of intermetallic compounds, such as Pt3La and Pt3Y, on the degallated zeolite significantly enhances the catalytic performance in terms of activity, selectivity, and durability. The PtREE/zeolite catalysts exhibit high initial propane conversion and slow deactivation, retaining significant conversion even after extended periods of reaction. The presence of a small amount of Ga in the zeolite may also contribute to the catalytic function. These advancements address the challenges in catalyst design, fabrication, and performance optimization by providing a stable and highly active catalyst for industrial applications, particularly in propane dehydrogenation.

Recent strategies to enhance the catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes include oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH), which has the potential to lower the energy requirement for achieving dehydrogenation. ODH can be considered as tandem endothermic (dehydrogenation) and exothermic (oxidation) processes, with an overall thermodynamic summation. Although the process is not thermo-neutral, part of the energy required for the endothermic reaction is augmented by the exothermic reaction. This lower temperature requirement of ODH compared to non-ODH and cracking is encouraging and provides motivation for continued efforts to develop ODH into an industrial technology. However, commercial ODH technologies hinge on innovative catalyst and process design, i.e. proper synergy of the endothermic dehydrogenation step with the exothermic hydrogen combustion and design of selective CH and hydrogen combustion catalysts. Insights about components of the active sites of CH activation can provide a platform for rational design of new efficient catalysts for dehydrogenation of lower alkanes. Recent strategies to enhance the catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes include the use of zeolites as supports to achieve high metal dispersion through cation exchange sites. This approach has been demonstrated with the creation of a Pt/Na[Fe]-ZSM-5 catalyst that exhibits outstanding stability for dehydrogenation of light alkanes. The catalyst's high Pt dispersion (cluster size < 1 mm) on zeolite through ion-exchange and the choice of Fe3+ as an isomorphous cation in place of Al3+ led to weaker Brnsted sites in [Fe]-ZSM compared to [Al]-ZSM, minimizing the tendency of side reactions and resulting in higher alkene selectivity and catalyst stability. Insights into the CH activation mechanisms on different catalysts have also been gained, which can guide the rational design of improved catalysts for C2 and C3 alkane dehydrogenation at lower temperatures. The key strategies and approaches that have been recently developed to enhance the catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes include oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH), which has the potential to lower the energy requirement for achieving dehydrogenation. However, commercial ODH technologies hinge on innovative catalyst and process design, including proper synergy of the endothermic dehydrogenation step with the exothermic hydrogen combustion and design of selective CH and hydrogen combustion catalysts. Despite a large number of reports and many reviews covering different aspects of the subject, and more than two decades of investigations on ODH, gaps still exist between laboratory achievements and industrial implementation.

Recent strategies to enhance the catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes include alloying Ni with Au or Sn to prevent the accumulation of carbon atoms on the surface and hinder the formation of coke. Alloying Ni with Au makes the adsorption of C atoms on the surface less favorable thermodynamically. Alloying Ni with Sn hinders the formation of CC bonds and enhances the formation of CO bonds, leading to the removal of surface C centers as carbon monoxide. This separation of Ni centers on the catalyst surface prevents the formation of coke. Additionally, additives such as potassium, sulfur, gold, or boron can be used to occupy step sites and prevent the formation of graphene islands. Boron can also be used to block sub-surface sites and prevent the formation of a carbidic phase. Sub-surface boron in Ni(111) has a destabilizing effect on on-surface C centers, which helps prevent the accumulation of C atoms on the surface.

Recent advancements in catalyst design for direct dehydrogenation processes include the development of a novel catalyst design concept that involves the double decoration of PtGa intermetallics with Pb and Ca. This strategy synergizes the geometric and electronic promotion effects on the catalyst stability. Pb is deposited on the three-fold Pt3 sites of the PtGa nanoparticles to block them, while Ca is placed around the nanoparticles to provide an electron-enriched single-atom-like Pt1 site. The resulting PtGaCaPb/SiO2 catalyst exhibits outstanding catalytic stability in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) at 600C, with almost no deactivation observed for up to 1 month. This addresses the challenges in catalyst design, fabrication, and performance optimization for industrial applications by providing an ultra-stable catalyst for PDH at high temperatures.

Recent strategies to enhance the catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes include optimizing the dispersion of Pt on the surface of carriers through ion exchange and impregnation, using additives to form alloys with Pt to anchor it on the carrier surface, and selecting carriers with strong interaction with Pt to prevent migration and coalescence. Pt can be loaded into the spaces between the layers of MgAlOx hydrotalcite and enclosed in the interspace of MgAl2O4 spinel to prevent migration. Pt can also be encapsulated in highly siliceous chabazite or coated with Al2O3 through atomic layer deposition to prevent sintering. Pt/MgO and Pt/CeO2 have been found to prevent Pt sintering due to the formation of a Mg2PtO4-like compound and the PtOCe bond, respectively. Atomically dispersed Pt on CeO2 can also prevent sintering. Adding Ga, In, Zn, Cu, Ir, Co to Pt catalysts can have similar effects as Sn in improving stability. B and Si can also play similar roles in preventing sintering and coking. The non-stoichiometric PtB cluster anchored to the carrier via a covalent BO bond can prevent sintering and reduce coke formation. Boration can reduce the binding energy of olefins and the tendency towards coke precursors. Computational screening predicts that Si can modify the selectivity of the Pt catalyst by changing both electronic and geometric properties.

Recent advancements in the design and fabrication of supported metal catalysts for direct dehydrogenation processes have focused on the development of novel synthesis strategies and in situ characterization techniques to provide insights at the atomic and molecular levels. These strategies include the control of metal particle size, the preparation of bimetallic nanoparticles with tailored size and phase, the stabilization of metal sites through strong interactions with supports, the encapsulation of metals in zeolites to prevent sintering, the use of hydrothermal synthesis to maintain porous texture and anchor active metals, the preparation of uniform bimetal nanoparticles, the employment of single-site metal precursors to construct well-defined surface metal species, and the transformation of zeolite structures to stabilize metals. These advancements address the challenges in catalyst design, fabrication, and performance optimization for industrial applications by improving the structural stability, anti-coking ability, and catalytic activity of supported metal catalysts.

Recent strategies to enhance the stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes include the nanopore-encaged metal strategy, wet-chemistry approach, and modification of supports. Modification of supports is particularly effective and simple. For instance, Lu et al. developed a PtSn/Al2O3 sheet catalyst for PDH, which showed high activity, selectivity, and stability due to the stabilization of PtSn clusters by strong metal-support interactions. Ma et al. found that adding Ga to Mg(Al)O layer double hydrotalcites significantly improved the stability of Pt catalysts in PDH, possibly because pentacoordinate Ga3+ ions dispersed and stabilized PtSn clusters, enhancing electronic interactions between Pt and Ga. The importance of support modification was also highlighted in the case of PtSn/CeO2 catalysts. These strategies allow for tuning and enhancement of catalytic activity, selectivity, and unique stability characteristics for bimetallic systems in PDH processes. Recent advancements in enhancing the catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts for direct dehydrogenation processes include the development of highly stable Pt/Sn-Si-beta catalysts using an improved post-synthesis strategy. This strategy involves the dealumination of H-beta zeolite and subsequent metal impregnation. Sn species in tetrahedral coordination states are incorporated into the framework of dealuminated beta (Si-beta), and Pt species are highly dispersed in the form of ultra-small nanoclusters on Pt/Sn-Si-beta due to the strong interaction between Pt and Sn(IV) sites confined in the Si-beta framework. The Pt/Sn-Si-beta catalysts exhibit excellent catalytic performance for propane dehydrogenation (PDH), with a propene formation rate of 2.3 mol g1Pt h1 and a propene selectivity of >99% at 550 C, and a higher propene formation rate of 3.1 mol g1Pt h1 at 600 C. The strong PtSn interactions and the confinement effect of Sn in the Si-beta framework inhibit coke formation and Pt cluster sintering, resulting in good stability of dehydrogenation and regeneration with almost unchanged catalytic activity during four cycles at 550 C. These advancements address the challenges in catalyst design, fabrication, and performance optimization for industrial applications by improving the stability and selectivity of the catalysts.

The introduction of various metals (Ce, In, La, and Fe) as promoters into the Pt/Sn-SBA-15 catalyst can significantly affect the initial activity and catalytic stability for propane dehydrogenation. The promoters can improve the redox property, antisintering ability, and resistance to coke deposition, which are responsible for the catalytic stability. The integrated impacts of these factors determine the overall stability of the catalysts. The introduction of transition metal (Zn), alkaline metal (Na, K), alkaline earth metal (Mg, Ca), and rare earth metal (La, Ce), etc. into the catalysts as promotors offered another strategy to enhance the interaction between Pt and Sn and tune the acid-base property simultaneously. The modified catalyst properties further acted positively in promoting the catalytic performances of propane dehydrogenation. The preparation of various metals (Ce, In, La, and Fe) promoted Pt/Sn-SBA-15 catalysts and their characterization and evaluation in propane dehydrogenation show that the nature of the promoter significantly affects the redox properties, surface composition, and lattice oxygen capacity of the catalysts, which in turn influence the initial activity and catalytic stability in propane dehydrogenation. The In-promoted catalyst exhibited the best performance during the stability test, with a moderate level of coke deposition and the maximum level of surface Pt species. The introduction of In also promoted the reduction of surface Pt oxides and stabilized the metallic Pt particles, leading to higher propylene selectivity and stability.

Recently developed strategies to enhance the catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes include the introduction of promoters to regulate the active compounds in both Pt-based and metal oxide-based catalysts. These advancements address challenges in catalyst design, fabrication, and performance optimization by suppressing side reactions, inhibiting coke deposition, stabilizing active compounds, and improving the dispersion of Pt atoms. Pt-based catalysts have been recognized as effective for alkane dehydrogenation reactions due to their high affinity for paraffinic CH bonds. Metal promoters, such as Sn, Ga, In, Zn, Cu, Co, and rare-earth elements (REEs), have been used to form alloys or intermetallic compounds to ameliorate central active components and inhibit catalytic deactivation. Metal oxide-based catalysts, including CoOx-, ZnOx-, VOx-, and CrOx-based catalysts, have also been extensively studied. Introducing another metal oxide to form an oxide compound can improve the dispersion of active species and enhance catalytic stability by modifying the coordination and electronic state of host metal oxide sites. The introduction of an appropriate metal oxide or noble metal can greatly enhance the catalytic performance.

However, it does describe a specific catalyst system, a boron nitride nanosheet-supported Pt/Cu cluster, which exhibits high efficiency and stability for propane dehydrogenation. The unique geometry of the Pt/Cu cluster, maintained by the strong bonding interaction between copper and edge BO defects on the h-BN nanosheets, is attributed to the remarkable improvement in catalytic efficiency. This system addresses the challenge of minimizing platinum usage while maximizing catalytic activity, which is crucial for industrial applications.

However, it does describe a specific case where a hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) nanosheet-supported Pt/Cu cluster catalyst was used to improve the efficiency of propane dehydrogenation. The catalyst was designed to minimize the use of platinum while maximizing its catalytic activity. The h-BN nanosheets provided a high surface area and abundant edges, which were terminated as amino groups. These characteristics made the h-BN nanosheets an appropriate support for loading the Pt/Cu catalyst. The strong bonding interaction between copper and the edge BO defects of the h-BN nanosheets maintained the unique geometry of the Pt/Cu cluster, leading to remarkable improvement in catalytic efficiency. This approach addresses the challenges in catalyst design, fabrication, and performance optimization for industrial applications by reducing the amount of expensive platinum required while maintaining high catalytic activity.

Recently developed strategies to enhance the catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes include the use of bimetallic catalysts formed by doping promoters such as Sn, In, Ga, and Cu, which can improve the dispersion of Pt and facilitate electron transfer. Another method is to modify the support, such as using ZnO, La2O3, TiO2, or replacing Al2O3 with other oxides. Single atom sites of Pt on a sandwich structure have also been found to be more favorable for PDH reactions than Pt ensembles. PtCu single atom alloys can simultaneously enhance propane conversion and propene selectivity. The goal of these strategies is to obtain highly and stably dispersed Pt-based catalysts to improve PDH performance. However, challenges remain in fully understanding the relationship between Pt, the promoter, and the support, and more efficient methods are needed to solve these problems. The hierarchical morphology and porous structure of catalysts are also being explored to provide more stable and accessible active sites, which can improve the performance of PDH reactions. The reconstruction of hydrotalcite-like compounds has shown promising effects on the microstructure and morphology of 3D oxide nanosheet array catalysts, leading to superior PDH performance.

Recent advancements in catalyst design for direct dehydrogenation processes have focused on developing stable and selective catalysts that can operate at thermodynamic limits. These catalysts, often consisting of platinum-tin alloy nanoparticles supported on alumina, have traditionally required hydrogen dilution to prevent carbon buildup and excess tin to avoid alloy segregation. However, a new approach using silica-supported platinum-tin nanoparticles has been reported to operate at thermodynamically limited conversion levels with high stability and selectivity to propylene. This is achieved by preserving the atomic mixing of platinum and tin during reduction and catalytic operation, and the benign interaction of the nanoparticles with the silica support prevents segregation and the formation of tin oxide phases. This catalyst can operate without hydrogen addition, which increases productivity by avoiding the decrease in thermodynamic limits on propane conversion. The synthesis of the catalyst begins with a heterometallic Pt-Sn coordination complex, ensuring that the interaction between Pt and Sn is retained during reduction and the PDH reaction. The catalyst features atomically mixed Pt-Sn precursors, very small intermetallic PtSn nanoparticles upon reduction, and a benign interaction with the silica support that avoids segregation and the formation of a tin oxide phase.

Additionally, the copper addition improves propylene selectivity while suppressing methane formation since a higher energy barrier for CC bond cleavage is required on the PtCu/Al2O3 catalyst. The primary origin of the enhancement upon copper addition can be ascribed to the unique PtCu bimetallic interaction.

The literature does not provide information on the key strategies and approaches that have been recently developed to enhance the catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes. However, it does describe the preparation and testing of ZnPt/HZ catalysts with different Zn/Pt ratios supported on high-silica HZSM-5 zeolite for the direct dehydrogenation of propane to propylene (PDH). The optimal 10Zn0.1Pt/HZ catalyst, consisting of 1000 ppm Pt and 10 wt% Zn, shows a high propylene yield (about 46%) and extraordinary dehydrogenation stability over 65 h at 525 C without any regeneration procedure or H2 as auxiliary gas. This catalyst has two kinds of active centers which work corporately: (i) Lewis acidic sites created by framework Zn species and (ii) small-sized PtZn particles. The stable state of the active species and strong carbon resistance of 10Zn0.1Pt/HZ related to the interaction effect between Pt and Zn are confirmed, accounting for the admirable reaction stability of PDH. This catalyst contains much more Zn and less Pt than previously reported PtZn-based dehydrogenation catalysts, breaking the traditional understanding about PtZn catalysts and opening a wide avenue for the design of stable dehydrogenation catalysts.

Recent advancements in catalyst design for direct dehydrogenation processes include the use of Pt-Sn clusters anchored at Al3+penta sites on mesoporous Al2O3 supports. These supports are fabricated with different levels of Al3+penta sites to disperse Pt-Sn2 clusters. The stability and regenerability of the Pt-Sn2/meso-Al2O3 catalysts are strongly dependent on the content of Al3+penta sites, with a high level of these sites effectively preventing the agglomeration of Pt-Sn2 clusters into large Pt nanoparticles during consecutive dehydrogenation-regeneration cycles.

The literature does not provide specific strategies or approaches for enhancing the catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes. However, it does describe the synthesis of ultrafine bimetallic Ga-Pt nanocatalysts encapsulated into silicalite-1 (S-1) zeolites (GaPt@S-1) for propane dehydrogenation (PDH). The confined GaPt alloy nanoclusters within the zeolite are the active sites for PDH reaction, and their high electron density could boost the desorption of products, resulting in a high propene selectivity and formation rate. The restriction of the zeolite can enhance the regeneration stability of the catalyst, and the catalytic activity kept unchanged after four consecutive cycles.

Recent advancements in catalytic stability for supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes include the use of rare-earth-platinum alloy nanoparticles supported on mesoporous zeolites. These catalysts are typically prepared by reducing metal precursor compounds under a hydrogen flow at high temperatures. However, the formation of Pt alloys with rare-earth elements through this method is challenging due to the low chemical potential of rare-earth element oxides. A novel approach uses a mesoporous zeolite with surface framework defects, known as silanol nests, which enable the rare-earth elements to exist as single atomic species with a higher chemical potential. This allows them to diffuse onto Pt, forming stable, highly active, and selective intermetallic compounds for propane dehydrogenation. When applied to late transition metals, this preparation strategy results in Pt alloy catalysts with a large amount of the second metal, such as in the case of the PtCo alloy, which exhibits high catalytic activity and selectivity in the preferential oxidation of carbon monoxide in hydrogen. The industrial PDH process has been using PtSn bimetallic catalysts supported on porous alumina for nearly three decades. However, Pt metal alone exhibits high initial catalytic activity but rapidly deactivates due to coke deposition on the Pt surface, which also causes a loss of catalytic selectivity to propylene. To address these problems, Sn is introduced to form an alloy with Pt nanoparticles, diluting the Pt surface with inactive Sn atoms and breaking up coke-generating Pt ensembles. Researchers have focused on using a siliceous MFI zeolite with a hierarchical micro-/mesoporous structure as a replacement for the alumina support. This zeolite, synthesized using a multi-ammonium surfactant as a structure-directing agent, has attracted attention as an advanced catalyst support due to its unique structure, which comprises ultrathin zeolite frameworks and three-dimensionally interconnected mesopores. These features boost the catalytic performance of supported metals by providing facile reactant and product diffusion and high metal nanoparticle dispersion within the mesopores. The formation of Pt3La and Pt3Y nanoparticles on the degallated zeolite has significantly enhanced the PDH catalytic performance, including activity, selectivity, and durability. Under harsh operating conditions, the conventional PtSn/alumina catalyst experiences severe coke formation and catalyst deactivation within one day. In contrast, the Pt3La intermetallic nanoparticles supported on the degallated zeolite show high initial propane conversion and undergo extremely slow deactivation, retaining 8% conversion even after 30 days of reaction. The PtREE incorporation in the mesoporous zeolite was conducted by co-impregnation of aqueous solutions of Pt and rare-earth element precursors, followed by heating under an O2 flow and subsequently under H2 at high temperatures. The formation of intermetallic compounds, such as Pt3La and Pt3Y, on the degallated zeolite significantly enhances the catalytic performance in terms of activity, selectivity, and durability. The PtREE/zeolite catalysts exhibit high initial propane conversion and slow deactivation, retaining significant conversion even after extended periods of reaction. The presence of a small amount of Ga in the zeolite may also contribute to the catalytic function. These advancements address the challenges in catalyst design, fabrication, and performance optimization by providing a stable and highly active catalyst for industrial applications, particularly in propane dehydrogenation.

Recent strategies to enhance the catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes include oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH), which has the potential to lower the energy requirement for achieving dehydrogenation. ODH can be considered as tandem endothermic (dehydrogenation) and exothermic (oxidation) processes, with an overall thermodynamic summation. Although the process is not thermo-neutral, part of the energy required for the endothermic reaction is augmented by the exothermic reaction. This lower temperature requirement of ODH compared to non-ODH and cracking is encouraging and provides motivation for continued efforts to develop ODH into an industrial technology. However, commercial ODH technologies hinge on innovative catalyst and process design, i.e. proper synergy of the endothermic dehydrogenation step with the exothermic hydrogen combustion and design of selective CH and hydrogen combustion catalysts. Insights about components of the active sites of CH activation can provide a platform for rational design of new efficient catalysts for dehydrogenation of lower alkanes. Recent strategies to enhance the catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes include the use of zeolites as supports to achieve high metal dispersion through cation exchange sites. This approach has been demonstrated with the creation of a Pt/Na[Fe]-ZSM-5 catalyst that exhibits outstanding stability for dehydrogenation of light alkanes. The catalyst's high Pt dispersion (cluster size < 1 mm) on zeolite through ion-exchange and the choice of Fe3+ as an isomorphous cation in place of Al3+ led to weaker Brnsted sites in [Fe]-ZSM compared to [Al]-ZSM, minimizing the tendency of side reactions and resulting in higher alkene selectivity and catalyst stability. Insights into the CH activation mechanisms on different catalysts have also been gained, which can guide the rational design of improved catalysts for C2 and C3 alkane dehydrogenation at lower temperatures. The key strategies and approaches that have been recently developed to enhance the catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes include oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH), which has the potential to lower the energy requirement for achieving dehydrogenation. However, commercial ODH technologies hinge on innovative catalyst and process design, including proper synergy of the endothermic dehydrogenation step with the exothermic hydrogen combustion and design of selective CH and hydrogen combustion catalysts. Despite a large number of reports and many reviews covering different aspects of the subject, and more than two decades of investigations on ODH, gaps still exist between laboratory achievements and industrial implementation.

Recent strategies to enhance the catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes include alloying Ni with Au or Sn to prevent the accumulation of carbon atoms on the surface and hinder the formation of coke. Alloying Ni with Au makes the adsorption of C atoms on the surface less favorable thermodynamically. Alloying Ni with Sn hinders the formation of CC bonds and enhances the formation of CO bonds, leading to the removal of surface C centers as carbon monoxide. This separation of Ni centers on the catalyst surface prevents the formation of coke. Additionally, additives such as potassium, sulfur, gold, or boron can be used to occupy step sites and prevent the formation of graphene islands. Boron can also be used to block sub-surface sites and prevent the formation of a carbidic phase. Sub-surface boron in Ni(111) has a destabilizing effect on on-surface C centers, which helps prevent the accumulation of C atoms on the surface.

Recent advancements in catalyst design for direct dehydrogenation processes include the development of a novel catalyst design concept that involves the double decoration of PtGa intermetallics with Pb and Ca. This strategy synergizes the geometric and electronic promotion effects on the catalyst stability. Pb is deposited on the three-fold Pt3 sites of the PtGa nanoparticles to block them, while Ca is placed around the nanoparticles to provide an electron-enriched single-atom-like Pt1 site. The resulting PtGaCaPb/SiO2 catalyst exhibits outstanding catalytic stability in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) at 600C, with almost no deactivation observed for up to 1 month. This addresses the challenges in catalyst design, fabrication, and performance optimization for industrial applications by providing an ultra-stable catalyst for PDH at high temperatures.

Recent strategies to enhance the catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes include optimizing the dispersion of Pt on the surface of carriers through ion exchange and impregnation, using additives to form alloys with Pt to anchor it on the carrier surface, and selecting carriers with strong interaction with Pt to prevent migration and coalescence. Pt can be loaded into the spaces between the layers of MgAlOx hydrotalcite and enclosed in the interspace of MgAl2O4 spinel to prevent migration. Pt can also be encapsulated in highly siliceous chabazite or coated with Al2O3 through atomic layer deposition to prevent sintering. Pt/MgO and Pt/CeO2 have been found to prevent Pt sintering due to the formation of a Mg2PtO4-like compound and the PtOCe bond, respectively. Atomically dispersed Pt on CeO2 can also prevent sintering. Adding Ga, In, Zn, Cu, Ir, Co to Pt catalysts can have similar effects as Sn in improving stability. B and Si can also play similar roles in preventing sintering and coking. The non-stoichiometric PtB cluster anchored to the carrier via a covalent BO bond can prevent sintering and reduce coke formation. Boration can reduce the binding energy of olefins and the tendency towards coke precursors. Computational screening predicts that Si can modify the selectivity of the Pt catalyst by changing both electronic and geometric properties.

Recent advancements in the design and fabrication of supported metal catalysts for direct dehydrogenation processes have focused on the development of novel synthesis strategies and in situ characterization techniques to provide insights at the atomic and molecular levels. These strategies include the control of metal particle size, the preparation of bimetallic nanoparticles with tailored size and phase, the stabilization of metal sites through strong interactions with supports, the encapsulation of metals in zeolites to prevent sintering, the use of hydrothermal synthesis to maintain porous texture and anchor active metals, the preparation of uniform bimetal nanoparticles, the employment of single-site metal precursors to construct well-defined surface metal species, and the transformation of zeolite structures to stabilize metals. These advancements address the challenges in catalyst design, fabrication, and performance optimization for industrial applications by improving the structural stability, anti-coking ability, and catalytic activity of supported metal catalysts.

Recent strategies to enhance the stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes include the nanopore-encaged metal strategy, wet-chemistry approach, and modification of supports. Modification of supports is particularly effective and simple. For instance, Lu et al. developed a PtSn/Al2O3 sheet catalyst for PDH, which showed high activity, selectivity, and stability due to the stabilization of PtSn clusters by strong metal-support interactions. Ma et al. found that adding Ga to Mg(Al)O layer double hydrotalcites significantly improved the stability of Pt catalysts in PDH, possibly because pentacoordinate Ga3+ ions dispersed and stabilized PtSn clusters, enhancing electronic interactions between Pt and Ga. The importance of support modification was also highlighted in the case of PtSn/CeO2 catalysts. These strategies allow for tuning and enhancement of catalytic activity, selectivity, and unique stability characteristics for bimetallic systems in PDH processes. Recent advancements in enhancing the catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts for direct dehydrogenation processes include the development of highly stable Pt/Sn-Si-beta catalysts using an improved post-synthesis strategy. This strategy involves the dealumination of H-beta zeolite and subsequent metal impregnation. Sn species in tetrahedral coordination states are incorporated into the framework of dealuminated beta (Si-beta), and Pt species are highly dispersed in the form of ultra-small nanoclusters on Pt/Sn-Si-beta due to the strong interaction between Pt and Sn(IV) sites confined in the Si-beta framework. The Pt/Sn-Si-beta catalysts exhibit excellent catalytic performance for propane dehydrogenation (PDH), with a propene formation rate of 2.3 mol g1Pt h1 and a propene selectivity of >99% at 550 C, and a higher propene formation rate of 3.1 mol g1Pt h1 at 600 C. The strong PtSn interactions and the confinement effect of Sn in the Si-beta framework inhibit coke formation and Pt cluster sintering, resulting in good stability of dehydrogenation and regeneration with almost unchanged catalytic activity during four cycles at 550 C. These advancements address the challenges in catalyst design, fabrication, and performance optimization for industrial applications by improving the stability and selectivity of the catalysts.

The introduction of various metals (Ce, In, La, and Fe) as promoters into the Pt/Sn-SBA-15 catalyst can significantly affect the initial activity and catalytic stability for propane dehydrogenation. The promoters can improve the redox property, antisintering ability, and resistance to coke deposition, which are responsible for the catalytic stability. The integrated impacts of these factors determine the overall stability of the catalysts. The introduction of transition metal (Zn), alkaline metal (Na, K), alkaline earth metal (Mg, Ca), and rare earth metal (La, Ce), etc. into the catalysts as promotors offered another strategy to enhance the interaction between Pt and Sn and tune the acid-base property simultaneously. The modified catalyst properties further acted positively in promoting the catalytic performances of propane dehydrogenation. The preparation of various metals (Ce, In, La, and Fe) promoted Pt/Sn-SBA-15 catalysts and their characterization and evaluation in propane dehydrogenation show that the nature of the promoter significantly affects the redox properties, surface composition, and lattice oxygen capacity of the catalysts, which in turn influence the initial activity and catalytic stability in propane dehydrogenation. The In-promoted catalyst exhibited the best performance during the stability test, with a moderate level of coke deposition and the maximum level of surface Pt species. The introduction of In also promoted the reduction of surface Pt oxides and stabilized the metallic Pt particles, leading to higher propylene selectivity and stability.

Recently developed strategies to enhance the catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes include the introduction of promoters to regulate the active compounds in both Pt-based and metal oxide-based catalysts. These advancements address challenges in catalyst design, fabrication, and performance optimization by suppressing side reactions, inhibiting coke deposition, stabilizing active compounds, and improving the dispersion of Pt atoms. Pt-based catalysts have been recognized as effective for alkane dehydrogenation reactions due to their high affinity for paraffinic CH bonds. Metal promoters, such as Sn, Ga, In, Zn, Cu, Co, and rare-earth elements (REEs), have been used to form alloys or intermetallic compounds to ameliorate central active components and inhibit catalytic deactivation. Metal oxide-based catalysts, including CoOx-, ZnOx-, VOx-, and CrOx-based catalysts, have also been extensively studied. Introducing another metal oxide to form an oxide compound can improve the dispersion of active species and enhance catalytic stability by modifying the coordination and electronic state of host metal oxide sites. The introduction of an appropriate metal oxide or noble metal can greatly enhance the catalytic performance.

The literature does not provide information on the key strategies and approaches that have been recently developed to enhance the catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes. However, it does describe a specific catalyst system, a boron nitride nanosheet-supported Pt/Cu cluster, which exhibits high efficiency and stability for propane dehydrogenation. The unique geometry of the Pt/Cu cluster, maintained by the strong bonding interaction between copper and edge BO defects on the h-BN nanosheets, is attributed to the remarkable improvement in catalytic efficiency. This system addresses the challenge of minimizing platinum usage while maximizing catalytic activity, which is crucial for industrial applications.

The catalyst was designed to minimize the use of platinum while maximizing its catalytic activity. The h-BN nanosheets provided a high surface area and abundant edges, which were terminated as amino groups. These characteristics made the h-BN nanosheets an appropriate support for loading the Pt/Cu catalyst. The strong bonding interaction between copper and the edge BO defects of the h-BN nanosheets maintained the unique geometry of the Pt/Cu cluster, leading to remarkable improvement in catalytic efficiency.

Recently developed strategies to enhance the catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes include the use of bimetallic catalysts formed by doping promoters such as Sn, In, Ga, and Cu, which can improve the dispersion of Pt and facilitate electron transfer. Another method is to modify the support, such as using ZnO, La2O3, TiO2, or replacing Al2O3 with other oxides. Single atom sites of Pt on a sandwich structure have also been found to be more favorable for PDH reactions than Pt ensembles. PtCu single atom alloys can simultaneously enhance propane conversion and propene selectivity. The goal of these strategies is to obtain highly and stably dispersed Pt-based catalysts to improve PDH performance. However, challenges remain in fully understanding the relationship between Pt, the promoter, and the support, and more efficient methods are needed to solve these problems. The hierarchical morphology and porous structure of catalysts are also being explored to provide more stable and accessible active sites, which can improve the performance of PDH reactions. The reconstruction of hydrotalcite-like compounds has shown promising effects on the microstructure and morphology of 3D oxide nanosheet array catalysts, leading to superior PDH performance.

Recent advancements in catalyst design for direct dehydrogenation processes have focused on developing stable and selective catalysts that can operate at thermodynamic limits. These catalysts, often consisting of platinum-tin alloy nanoparticles supported on alumina, have traditionally required hydrogen dilution to prevent carbon buildup and excess tin to avoid alloy segregation. However, a new approach using silica-supported platinum-tin nanoparticles has been reported to operate at thermodynamically limited conversion levels with high stability and selectivity to propylene. This is achieved by preserving the atomic mixing of platinum and tin during reduction and catalytic operation, and the benign interaction of the nanoparticles with the silica support prevents segregation and the formation of tin oxide phases. This catalyst can operate without hydrogen addition, which increases productivity by avoiding the decrease in thermodynamic limits on propane conversion. The synthesis of the catalyst begins with a heterometallic Pt-Sn coordination complex, ensuring that the interaction between Pt and Sn is retained during reduction and the PDH reaction. The catalyst features atomically mixed Pt-Sn precursors, very small intermetallic PtSn nanoparticles upon reduction, and a benign interaction with the silica support that avoids segregation and the formation of a tin oxide phase.

However, these strategies can reduce the efficiency of the process.
          A new catalyst has been developed that operates at thermodynamic limits without the need for hydrogen dilution and exhibits excellent stability and selectivity to propylene. This catalyst is composed of silica-supported Pt1Sn1 nanoparticles, synthesized and pretreated to ensure that the mixing of Pt and Sn is preserved during catalytic operation.
          The principle behind the synthesis of this catalyst is to begin with a heterometallic Pt-Sn coordination complex in which Pt and Sn are in immediate contact, and this interaction is retained during the reduction and PDH reaction.

The catalyst is composed of silica-supported Pt1Sn1 nanoparticles, synthesized and pretreated to ensure that the mixing of Pt and Sn is preserved during catalytic operation.
          Commercial operations often dilute propane streams to increase the limiting equilibrium conversion, which is higher at lower propane partial pressure, and to limit catalyst deactivation rates. However, this approach requires additional downstream separation units and limits process efficiency.
          Under reaction conditions, the thermodynamic limit on propane conversion is 66.5%. The Pt1Sn1/SiO2 catalyst showed near-thermodynamic conversion of &gt;66% and &gt;99% selectivity to propylene.
          Under harsh conditions, the propane conversion goes from 41 to 39% in 120 min. Under identical conditions, the other tested catalysts deactivate very rapidly to very low conversion. A TEM image of the spent catalyst shows that the Pt-Sn NPs are well dispersed, with an average particle diameter of 1.6  0.67 nm, which is consistent with the particle size in fresh samples.
          The Pt1Sn1/SiO2 catalyst can be partially regenerated by oxidation using 1% O2 as a mild oxidant at 500C followed by reduction at 600C. The regeneration studies showed that the catalysts can be partially regenerated, with 97% of the initial activity and &gt;99% of the initial selectivity after three PDH/regeneration cycles.
          The process of mixing chloroplatinic acid and tin(II) chloride in 0.1 M hydrochloric acid solution formed a heterometallic Pt-Sn coordination complex.
          A bright-field TEM image of Pt-Sn NPs formed on SiO2 upon the reduction of the Pt-Sn complex shows high metal dispersion on the support, with an average NP size of 1.3  0.6 nm. The XRD spectra show that the formed NPs were essentially alloys of Pt and Sn.
          The real-space Pt LIII EXAFS spectra for the Pt1Sn1/SiO2 catalyst are substantially different from the spectra of monometallic Pt and indicate the mixing of Pt and Sn atoms. The best-fit spectrum for the Pt1Sn1/SiO2 catalyst is characterized by the presence of the Pt-Pt and Pt-Sn scattering paths, consistent with the formation of PtSn intermetallic phases.

The document does not provide information on the key strategies and approaches that have been recently developed to enhance the catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes. However, it does discuss the effects of composition and metal particle size on ethane dehydrogenation over PtxSn100x/Mg(Al)O (70  x  100) catalysts. The study found that the specific activity of PtxSn100x/Mg(Al)O for ethane dehydrogenation increases with increasing metal particle size and increasing Sn/Pt ratio. Carbon deposition decreases with decreasing metal particle size and increasing Sn/Pt ratio. These findings suggest that controlling the particle size and composition of the catalyst can improve its stability and performance in dehydrogenation processes.

The literature does not provide specific strategies or approaches for enhancing the catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes. However, it does report the development of a CoSiBeta catalyst with high catalytic activity and selectivity for the direct dehydrogenation of propane to propylene. The catalyst features ultrasmall-sized Co particles confined in the silanols of dealuminated Beta zeolite, which are highly efficient for catalyzing the reaction. The CoOx species within the zeolite can be easily reduced to metallic Co particles under H2 or reactant gas, and these particles are the active sites for the PDH reaction. The high catalytic ability and product selectivity of small confined Co particles are proven, providing novel inspiration for the design of low-cost, ecofriendly, and advanced catalysts for PDH. The earth abundance of Co bodes well for long-term utility, and it has been reported to show a certain degree of catalytic activity for PDH. The literature also discusses the preparation of cobalt catalysts supported on dealuminated Beta (SiBeta) based on Dzwigaj's method, followed by high-temperature calcination in air to obtain CoSiBeta catalysts for PDH. After prereduction under optimum conditions, the 0.5CoSiBeta catalyst (Co loading is 0.5 wt%) showed propane conversion as high as 72% with propylene selectivity of around 92%. The literature suggests that the small metallic Co particles confined in silanols are active sites, and bulk Co3O4 and large Co0 particles on SiBeta support contribute to cracking and carbon deposition, respectively.

The literature does not provide information on the key strategies and approaches that have been recently developed to enhance the catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes. However, it does discuss the promotional effect of Cu on the catalytic performance of Pt/Al2O3 catalysts for propane dehydrogenation. The optimized loading content of Cu is 0.5 wt%, which increases the propylene selectivity to 90.8% with a propylene yield of 36.5%. The origin of the enhanced catalytic performance and anti-coking ability of the PtCu/Al2O3 catalyst is ascribed to the intimate interaction between Pt and Cu, which inhibits propylene adsorption and elevates the energy barrier of CC bond rupture. The inhibited propylene adsorption diminishes the possibility of coke formation and suppresses the cracking reaction towards the formation of lighter hydrocarbons on PtCu/Al2O3, while a higher energy barrier for CC bond cleavage suppresses the methane formation.
