          Recent advancements in the design and fabrication of supported metal catalysts for direct dehydrogenation processes have focused on the development of novel synthesis strategies and in situ characterization techniques to provide insights at the atomic and molecular levels. These strategies include the control of metal particle size, the preparation of bimetallic nanoparticles with tailored size and phase, the stabilization of metal sites through strong interactions with supports, the encapsulation of metals in zeolites to prevent sintering, the use of hydrothermal synthesis to maintain porous texture and anchor active metals, the preparation of uniform bimetal nanoparticles, the employment of single-site metal precursors to construct well-defined surface metal species, and the transformation of zeolite structures to stabilize metals. These advancements address the challenges in catalyst design, fabrication, and performance optimization for industrial applications by improving the structural stability, anti-coking ability, and catalytic activity of supported metal catalysts.
