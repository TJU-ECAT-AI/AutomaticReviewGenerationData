          The introduction of various metals (Ce, In, La, and Fe) as promoters into the Pt/Sn-SBA-15 catalyst can significantly affect the initial activity and catalytic stability for propane dehydrogenation. The promoters can improve the redox property, antisintering ability, and resistance to coke deposition, which are responsible for the catalytic stability. The integrated impacts of these factors determine the overall stability of the catalysts. The introduction of transition metal (Zn), alkaline metal (Na, K), alkaline earth metal (Mg, Ca), and rare earth metal (La, Ce), etc. into the catalysts as promotors offered another strategy to enhance the interaction between Pt and Sn and tune the acid-base property simultaneously. The modified catalyst properties further acted positively in promoting the catalytic performances of propane dehydrogenation. The preparation of various metals (Ce, In, La, and Fe) promoted Pt/Sn-SBA-15 catalysts and their characterization and evaluation in propane dehydrogenation show that the nature of the promoter significantly affects the redox properties, surface composition, and lattice oxygen capacity of the catalysts, which in turn influence the initial activity and catalytic stability in propane dehydrogenation. The In-promoted catalyst exhibited the best performance during the stability test, with a moderate level of coke deposition and the maximum level of surface Pt species. The introduction of In also promoted the reduction of surface Pt oxides and stabilized the metallic Pt particles, leading to higher propylene selectivity and stability.

          将各种金属（Ce，In，La和Fe）作为促进剂引入Pt/Sn-SBA-15催化剂可以显著影响丙烷脱氢的初始活性和催化稳定性。促进剂可以改善氧化还原性质，抗烧结能力和抗焦炭沉积能力，这些是催化稳定性的原因。这些因素的综合影响决定了催化剂的整体稳定性。将过渡金属（Zn）、碱金属（Na，K）、碱土金属（Mg，Ca）和稀土金属（La，Ce）等作为促进剂引入催化剂中，提供了另一种策略，以增强Pt和Sn之间的相互作用，同时调节酸碱性质。修改后的催化剂性质进一步积极地促进了丙烷脱氢的催化性能。各种金属（铈、铟、镧和铁）促进的Pt/Sn-SBA-15催化剂的制备及其在丙烷脱氢中的表征和评价表明，促进剂的性质对催化剂的氧化还原性质、表面组成和晶格氧容量有显著影响，进而影响丙烷脱氢的初始活性和催化稳定性。在稳定性测试中，In促进的催化剂表现出最佳性能，具有中等水平的焦炭沉积和表面Pt物种的最大水平。In的引入还促进了表面Pt氧化物的还原，稳定了金属Pt颗粒，导致更高的丙烯选择性和稳定性。
