Under identical conditions, the other tested catalysts deactivate very rapidly to very low conversion, as illustrated for the commercial mimic.

Under identical conditions, the other tested catalysts deactivate very rapidly to very low conversion, as illustrated for the commercial mimic.

Under identical conditions, the other tested catalysts deactivate very rapidly to very low conversion, as illustrated for the commercial mimic.

Under identical conditions, the other tested catalysts deactivate very rapidly to very low conversion, as illustrated for the commercial mimic.

Under identical conditions, the other tested catalysts deactivate very rapidly to very low conversion, as illustrated for the commercial mimic.

Under identical conditions, the other tested catalysts deactivate very rapidly to very low conversion, as illustrated for the commercial mimic.

Under identical conditions, the other tested catalysts deactivate very rapidly to very low conversion, as illustrated for the commercial mimic.

Under identical conditions, the other tested catalysts deactivate very rapidly to very low conversion, as illustrated for the commercial mimic.

Under identical conditions, the other tested catalysts deactivate very rapidly to very low conversion, as illustrated for the commercial mimic.

Under identical conditions, the other tested catalysts deactivate very rapidly to very low conversion, as illustrated for the commercial mimic.

A TEM image of the spent catalyst shows that the Pt-Sn NPs are well dispersed, with an average particle diameter of 1.6  0.67 nm, which is consistent with the particle size in fresh samples.\n          The Pt1Sn1/SiO2 catalyst can be partially regenerated by oxidation using 1% O2 as a mild oxidant at 500C followed by reduction at 600C. The regeneration studies showed that the catalysts can be partially regenerated, with 97% of the initial activity and &gt;99% of the initial selectivity after three PDH/regeneration cycles.\n          The process of mixing chloroplatinic acid and tin(II) chloride in 0.1 M hydrochloric acid solution formed a heterometallic Pt-Sn coordination complex.\n          A bright-field TEM image of Pt-Sn NPs formed on SiO2 upon the reduction of the Pt-Sn complex shows high metal dispersion on the support, with an average NP size of 1.3  0.6 nm. The XRD spectra show that the formed NPs were essentially alloys of Pt and Sn.\n          The real-space Pt LIII EXAFS spectra for the Pt1Sn1/SiO2 catalyst are substantially different from the spectra of monometallic Pt and indicate the mixing of Pt and Sn atoms. The best-fit spectrum for the Pt1Sn1/SiO2 catalyst is characterized by the presence of the Pt-Pt and Pt-Sn scattering paths, consistent with the formation of PtSn intermetallic phases.", "Doi": "10.1126/science.abg7894"},

However, it does discuss the effects of composition and metal particle size on ethane dehydrogenation over PtxSn100x/Mg(Al)O (70  x  100) catalysts. The study found that the specific activity of PtxSn100x/Mg(Al)O for ethane dehydrogenation increases with increasing metal particle size and increasing Sn/Pt ratio. Carbon deposition decreases with decreasing metal particle size and increasing Sn/Pt ratio. These findings suggest that controlling the particle size and composition of the catalyst can improve its stability and performance in dehydrogenation processes.", "Doi": "10.1016/j.jcat.2013.11.017"},
{"Quotes": "", "English": "The literature does not provide specific strategies or approaches for enhancing the catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes. However, it does report the development of a CoSiBeta catalyst with high catalytic activity and selectivity for the direct dehydrogenation of propane to propylene. The catalyst features ultrasmall-sized Co particles confined in the silanols of dealuminated Beta zeolite, which are highly efficient for catalyzing the reaction. The CoOx species within the zeolite can be easily reduced to metallic Co particles under H2 or reactant gas, and these particles are the active sites for the PDH reaction. The high catalytic ability and product selectivity of small confined Co particles are proven, providing novel inspiration for the design of low-cost, ecofriendly, and advanced catalysts for PDH. The earth abundance of Co bodes well for long-term utility, and it has been reported to show a certain degree of catalytic activity for PDH. The literature also discusses the preparation of cobalt catalysts supported on dealuminated Beta (SiBeta) based on Dzwigaj's method, followed by high-temperature calcination in air to obtain CoSiBeta catalysts for PDH. After prereduction under optimum conditions, the 0.5CoSiBeta catalyst (Co loading is 0.5 wt%) showed propane conversion as high as 72% with propylene selectivity of around 92%. The literature suggests that the small metallic Co particles confined in silanols are active sites, and bulk Co3O4 and large Co0 particles on SiBeta support contribute to cracking and carbon deposition, respectively.", "Doi": "10.1016/j.jcat.2019.12.037"},

However, it does discuss the promotional effect of Cu on the catalytic performance of Pt/Al2O3 catalysts for propane dehydrogenation. The optimized loading content of Cu is 0.5 wt%, which increases the propylene selectivity to 90.8% with a propylene yield of 36.5%. The origin of the enhanced catalytic performance and anti-coking ability of the PtCu/Al2O3 catalyst is ascribed to the intimate interaction between Pt and Cu, which inhibits propylene adsorption and elevates the energy barrier of CC bond rupture. The inhibited propylene adsorption diminishes the possibility of coke formation and suppresses the cracking reaction towards the formation of lighter hydrocarbons on PtCu/Al2O3, while a higher energy barrier for CC bond cleavage suppresses the methane formation. The literature does not provide information on the key strategies and approaches that have been recently developed to enhance the catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes. However, it does mention that the addition of copper to a platinum-based catalyst improves its catalytic performance and stability for propane dehydrogenation. The optimized loading content of copper is 0.5 wt%, which increases the propylene selectivity to 90.8% with a propylene yield of 36.5%. The improved anti-coking ability of the PtCu/Al2O3 catalysts is due to the inhibition of propylene adsorption, which diminishes the possibility of coke formation and suppresses the cracking reactions towards lighter hydrocarbons on PtCu/Al2O3. Additionally, the copper addition improves propylene selectivity while suppressing methane formation since a higher energy barrier for CC bond cleavage is required on the PtCu/Al2O3 catalyst. The primary origin of the enhancement upon copper addition can be ascribed to the unique PtCu bimetallic interaction.", "Doi": "10.1039/C4NR02143F"}
