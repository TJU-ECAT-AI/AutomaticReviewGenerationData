[1] "To improve the stability of Pt-based catalysts, many efforts have been dedicated to strengthen metalsupport interactions by using various methods including the nanopore-encaged metal strategy,2124 wet-chemistry approach2529 and modification of supports.10,11,30,31 Among them, modification of supports is a relatively effective and simple method to improve the stability of Pt-based catalysts."

[2] "For example, Lu et al. reported a PtSn/Al2O3 sheet catalyst for PDH, exhibiting high activity, selectivity and stability.11 It was proposed that the enhanced stability in PDH was associated with γ-Al2O3 nanosheets containing a great deal of pentacoordinate Al3+ ions, which can stabilize PtSn clusters by strong interactions between metals and supports."

[3] "Recent work by Ma et al. showed that the addition of Ga into Mg(Al)O layer double hydrotalcites could greatly enhance the stability of Pt catalysts in PDH.10 It may be due to the fact that pentacoordinate Ga3+ ions could disperse and stabilize PtSn clusters, thereby enhancing the electronic interactions between Pt and Ga."

[4] "A similar conclusion regarding the importance of modification of supports has been reported in the case of PtSn/CeO2 catalysts.30"

[5] "Therefore, this provides a way to tune and enhance the catalytic activity and selectivity for the PDH process, and also introduces unique stability characteristics for bimetallic systems."

1.Recent strategies to enhance the stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes include the nanopore-encaged metal strategy, wet-chemistry approach, and modification of supports. Modification of supports is particularly effective and simple. For instance, Lu et al. developed a PtSn/Al2O3 sheet catalyst for PDH, which showed high activity, selectivity, and stability due to the stabilization of PtSn clusters by strong metal-support interactions. Ma et al. found that adding Ga to Mg(Al)O layer double hydrotalcites significantly improved the stability of Pt catalysts in PDH, possibly because pentacoordinate Ga3+ ions dispersed and stabilized PtSn clusters, enhancing electronic interactions between Pt and Ga. The importance of support modification was also highlighted in the case of PtSn/CeO2 catalysts. These strategies allow for tuning and enhancement of catalytic activity, selectivity, and unique stability characteristics for bimetallic systems in PDH processes.

1.最近，为了提高直接脱氢过程中负载金属催化剂的稳定性，开发了包括金属纳米孔封装策略、湿化学方法和载体改性在内的策略。其中，载体改性特别有效且简单。例如，Lu等人开发了一种PtSn/Al2O3片状催化剂用于PDH，由于金属和载体之间的强相互作用稳定了PtSn簇，该催化剂表现出高活性、选择性和稳定性。Ma等人发现，将Ga添加到Mg(Al)O层双水滑石中可以显著提高PDH中Pt催化剂的稳定性，这可能是由于五配位Ga3+离子分散和稳定了PtSn簇，从而增强了Pt和Ga之间的电子相互作用。在PtSn/CeO2催化剂的情况下，也强调了载体改性的重要性。这些策略允许调整和增强PDH过程中的催化活性、选择性，并为双金属系统引入独特的稳定性特征。
