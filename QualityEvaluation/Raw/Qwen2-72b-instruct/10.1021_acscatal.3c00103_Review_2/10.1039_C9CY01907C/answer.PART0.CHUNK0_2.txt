1.Recently, to enhance the catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes, researchers have developed several strategies and approaches. These include the nanopore-encaged metal strategy, wet-chemistry approach, and modification of supports. Among these, modification of supports is considered a relatively effective and simple method to improve the stability of Pt-based catalysts. This modification can tune and enhance the catalytic activity and selectivity for the PDH process, and also introduces unique stability characteristics for bimetallic systems. In this work, highly stable Pt/Sn-Si-beta catalysts were prepared by an improved post-synthesis method, which exhibited high catalytic activity, good selectivity, and excellent stability. The confined Sn(iv) sites promote the high dispersion of Pt clusters and improve the catalyst stability by strong PtSn interactions.

1.最近，为了提高直接脱氢过程中支撑金属催化剂的催化稳定性，研究人员开发了几种策略和方法。这些包括纳米孔封装金属策略、湿化学方法和支持物改性。其中，支持物改性被认为是一种相对有效和简单的方法，可以提高Pt基催化剂的稳定性。这种改性可以调节和增强PDH过程的催化活性和选择性，同时为双金属系统引入独特的稳定性特征。在本工作中，通过改进的后合成方法制备了高稳定性的Pt/Sn-Si-beta催化剂，该催化剂表现出高催化活性、良好的选择性和优异的稳定性。被限制的Sn(iv)位点促进了Pt团簇的高分散，并通过强烈的PtSn相互作用提高了催化剂的稳定性。
