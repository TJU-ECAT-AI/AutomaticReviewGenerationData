[1] "Herein, highly stable Pt/Sn-Si-beta catalysts for PDH were prepared by an improved post-synthesis strategy, which consists of dealumination of H-beta and subsequent metal impregnation."
[2] "It is indicated that Sn species existing in tetrahedral coordination states were incorporated into the framework of dealuminated beta (Si-beta)."
[3] "Meanwhile, Pt species were highly dispersed in the form of ultra-small nanoclusters on Pt/Sn-Si-beta due to the strong interaction between Pt and Sn(IV) sites confined in the Si-beta framework."
[4] "The prepared Pt/Sn-Si-beta catalysts show excellent catalytic performance for PDH, in which the propene formation rate was 2.3 mol g1Pt h1 with a propene selectivity of >99% at 550 C and the higher propene formation rate was 3.1 mol g1Pt h1 at 600 C."
[5] "Moreover, the strong PtSn interactions and the confinement effect of Sn in the Si-beta framework inhibit the coke and sintering of Pt clusters, thereby achieving good stability of dehydrogenation and regeneration with almost unchanged catalytic activity during four cycles at 550 C."

1.Recent advancements in catalyst design for direct dehydrogenation processes have focused on enhancing the stability of supported metal catalysts. A key strategy involves the use of a post-synthesis method that includes dealumination of H-beta zeolite and subsequent metal impregnation. This approach leads to the incorporation of Sn species into the framework of the zeolite in a tetrahedral coordination state. The strong interaction between Pt and Sn(IV) sites confined in the Si-beta framework results in the high dispersion of Pt species in the form of ultra-small nanoclusters. The Pt/Sn-Si-beta catalysts exhibit excellent catalytic performance for propane dehydrogenation (PDH), with high propene formation rates and selectivity. The strong PtSn interactions and the confinement effect of Sn in the Si-beta framework effectively inhibit coke formation and Pt cluster sintering, leading to good stability in dehydrogenation and regeneration processes over multiple cycles.

1.近期在直接脱氢过程的催化剂设计中，增强负载金属催化剂的稳定性是主要的研究方向。一种关键策略是采用后合成方法，包括H-beta沸石的脱铝化和随后的金属浸渍。这种方法导致Sn物种以四面体配位状态被纳入沸石框架中。Pt和Si-beta框架中Sn(IV)位点之间的强相互作用导致Pt物种以超小纳米团簇的形式高度分散。Pt/Sn-Si-beta催化剂在丙烷脱氢（PDH）中表现出优异的催化性能，具有高丙烯形成速率和选择性。强烈的PtSn相互作用和Sn在Si-beta框架中的限制效应有效地抑制了焦炭的形成和Pt团簇的烧结，从而在多次循环中实现了脱氢和再生过程的良好稳定性。
