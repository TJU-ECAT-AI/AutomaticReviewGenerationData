[1] "Herein, highly stable Pt/Sn-Si-beta catalysts for PDH were prepared by an improved post-synthesis strategy, which consists of dealumination of H-beta and subsequent metal impregnation."
[2] "It is indicated that Sn species existing in tetrahedral coordination states were incorporated into the framework of dealuminated beta (Si-beta)."
[3] "Meanwhile, Pt species were highly dispersed in the form of ultra-small nanoclusters on Pt/Sn-Si-beta due to the strong interaction between Pt and Sn(IV) sites confined in the Si-beta framework."
[4] "The prepared Pt/Sn-Si-beta catalysts show excellent catalytic performance for PDH, in which the propene formation rate was 2.3 mol g1Pt h1 with a propene selectivity of >99% at 550 C and the higher propene formation rate was 3.1 mol g1Pt h1 at 600 C."
[5] "Moreover, the strong PtSn interactions and the confinement effect of Sn in the Si-beta framework inhibit the coke and sintering of Pt clusters, thereby achieving good stability of dehydrogenation and regeneration with almost unchanged catalytic activity during four cycles at 550 C."

1.Recent advancements in enhancing the catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts for direct dehydrogenation processes include the development of highly stable Pt/Sn-Si-beta catalysts. These catalysts are prepared through an improved post-synthesis strategy involving the dealumination of H-beta zeolite and subsequent metal impregnation. Sn species in tetrahedral coordination states are incorporated into the framework of dealuminated beta (Si-beta), and Pt species are highly dispersed as ultra-small nanoclusters on the Pt/Sn-Si-beta catalyst due to the strong interaction between Pt and Sn(IV) sites confined in the Si-beta framework. The Pt/Sn-Si-beta catalysts exhibit excellent catalytic performance for propane dehydrogenation (PDH), with a propene formation rate of 2.3 mol g1Pt h1 and a propene selectivity of >99% at 550 C, and a higher propene formation rate of 3.1 mol g1Pt h1 at 600 C. The strong PtSn interactions and the confinement effect of Sn in the Si-beta framework inhibit coke formation and Pt cluster sintering, resulting in good stability of dehydrogenation and regeneration with almost unchanged catalytic activity during four cycles at 550 C. These advancements address the challenges in catalyst design, fabrication, and performance optimization for industrial applications by improving the stability and selectivity of the catalysts.

1.最近在提高直接脱氢过程中支撑金属催化剂的催化稳定性方面取得的进展包括开发了高度稳定的Pt/Sn-Si-beta催化剂。这些催化剂是通过改进的后合成策略制备的，该策略包括H-beta沸石的脱铝化和随后的金属浸渍。Sn物种以四面体配位状态被纳入脱铝化β（Si-beta）的框架中，Pt物种由于Pt和Si-beta框架中限制的Sn(IV)位点之间的强相互作用，以超小纳米团簇的形式高度分散在Pt/Sn-Si-beta催化剂上。Pt/Sn-Si-beta催化剂在丙烷脱氢（PDH）中表现出优异的催化性能，其中在550 C时丙烯形成速率为2.3 mol g1Pt h1，丙烯选择性>99%，在600 C时丙烯形成速率更高，为3.1 mol g1Pt h1。强烈的PtSn相互作用和Sn在Si-beta框架中的限制效应抑制了焦炭的形成和Pt团簇的烧结，从而在550 C时的四个循环中几乎不变的催化活性实现了脱氢和再生的良好稳定性。这些进展通过提高催化剂的稳定性和选择性，解决了工业应用中催化剂设计、制造和性能优化的挑战。
