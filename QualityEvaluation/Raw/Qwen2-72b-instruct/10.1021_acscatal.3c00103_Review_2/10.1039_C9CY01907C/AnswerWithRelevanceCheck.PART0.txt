          [1] "To improve the stability of Pt-based catalysts, many efforts have been dedicated to strengthen metalsupport interactions by using various methods including the nanopore-encaged metal strategy,2124 wet-chemistry approach2529 and modification of supports.10,11,30,31 Among them, modification of supports is a relatively effective and simple method to improve the stability of Pt-based catalysts."
          [2] "For example, Lu et al. reported a PtSn/Al2O3 sheet catalyst for PDH, exhibiting high activity, selectivity and stability.11 It was proposed that the enhanced stability in PDH was associated with γ-Al2O3 nanosheets containing a great deal of pentacoordinate Al3+ ions, which can stabilize PtSn clusters by strong interactions between metals and supports."
          [3] "Recent work by Ma et al. showed that the addition of Ga into Mg(Al)O layer double hydrotalcites could greatly enhance the stability of Pt catalysts in PDH.10 It may be due to the fact that pentacoordinate Ga3+ ions could disperse and stabilize PtSn clusters, thereby enhancing the electronic interactions between Pt and Ga."
          [4] "A similar conclusion regarding the importance of modification of supports has been reported in the case of PtSn/CeO2 catalysts.30"
          [5] "Therefore, this provides a way to tune and enhance the catalytic activity and selectivity for the PDH process, and also introduces unique stability characteristics for bimetallic systems."
          [6] "Herein, highly stable Pt/Sn-Si-beta catalysts for PDH were prepared by an improved post-synthesis strategy, which consists of dealumination of H-beta and subsequent metal impregnation."
          [7] "It is indicated that Sn species existing in tetrahedral coordination states were incorporated into the framework of dealuminated beta (Si-beta)."
          [8] "Meanwhile, Pt species were highly dispersed in the form of ultra-small nanoclusters on Pt/Sn-Si-beta due to the strong interaction between Pt and Sn(IV) sites confined in the Si-beta framework."
          [9] "The prepared Pt/Sn-Si-beta catalysts show excellent catalytic performance for PDH, in which the propene formation rate was 2.3 mol g1Pt h1 with a propene selectivity of >99% at 550 C and the higher propene formation rate was 3.1 mol g1Pt h1 at 600 C."
          [10] "Moreover, the strong PtSn interactions and the confinement effect of Sn in the Si-beta framework inhibit the coke and sintering of Pt clusters, thereby achieving good stability of dehydrogenation and regeneration with almost unchanged catalytic activity during four cycles at 550 C."

          Recent strategies to enhance the stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes include the nanopore-encaged metal strategy, wet-chemistry approach, and modification of supports. Modification of supports is particularly effective and simple. For instance, Lu et al. developed a PtSn/Al2O3 sheet catalyst for PDH, which showed high activity, selectivity, and stability due to the stabilization of PtSn clusters by strong metal-support interactions. Ma et al. found that adding Ga to Mg(Al)O layer double hydrotalcites significantly improved the stability of Pt catalysts in PDH, possibly because pentacoordinate Ga3+ ions dispersed and stabilized PtSn clusters, enhancing electronic interactions between Pt and Ga. The importance of support modification was also highlighted in the case of PtSn/CeO2 catalysts. These strategies allow for tuning and enhancement of catalytic activity, selectivity, and unique stability characteristics for bimetallic systems in PDH processes. Recent advancements in enhancing the catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts for direct dehydrogenation processes include the development of highly stable Pt/Sn-Si-beta catalysts using an improved post-synthesis strategy. This strategy involves the dealumination of H-beta zeolite and subsequent metal impregnation. Sn species in tetrahedral coordination states are incorporated into the framework of dealuminated beta (Si-beta), and Pt species are highly dispersed in the form of ultra-small nanoclusters on Pt/Sn-Si-beta due to the strong interaction between Pt and Sn(IV) sites confined in the Si-beta framework. The Pt/Sn-Si-beta catalysts exhibit excellent catalytic performance for propane dehydrogenation (PDH), with a propene formation rate of 2.3 mol g1Pt h1 and a propene selectivity of >99% at 550 C, and a higher propene formation rate of 3.1 mol g1Pt h1 at 600 C. The strong PtSn interactions and the confinement effect of Sn in the Si-beta framework inhibit coke formation and Pt cluster sintering, resulting in good stability of dehydrogenation and regeneration with almost unchanged catalytic activity during four cycles at 550 C. These advancements address the challenges in catalyst design, fabrication, and performance optimization for industrial applications by improving the stability and selectivity of the catalysts.

          最近，为了提高直接脱氢过程中负载金属催化剂的稳定性，开发了包括金属纳米孔封装策略、湿化学方法和载体改性在内的策略。其中，载体改性特别有效且简单。例如，Lu等人开发了一种PtSn/Al2O3片状催化剂用于PDH，由于金属和载体之间的强相互作用稳定了PtSn簇，该催化剂表现出高活性、选择性和稳定性。Ma等人发现，将Ga添加到Mg(Al)O层双水滑石中可以显著提高PDH中Pt催化剂的稳定性，这可能是由于五配位Ga3+离子分散和稳定了PtSn簇，从而增强了Pt和Ga之间的电子相互作用。在PtSn/CeO2催化剂的情况下，也强调了载体改性的重要性。这些策略允许调整和增强PDH过程中的催化活性、选择性，并为双金属系统引入独特的稳定性特征。最近在提高直接脱氢过程中支撑金属催化剂的催化稳定性方面取得的进展包括使用改进的后合成策略开发高度稳定的Pt/Sn-Si-beta催化剂。该策略涉及H-beta沸石的脱铝化和随后的金属浸渍。Sn物种以四面体配位状态被纳入脱铝化β（Si-beta）的框架中，Pt物种由于Pt和Si-beta框架中限制的Sn(IV)位点之间的强相互作用，以超小纳米团簇的形式高度分散在Pt/Sn-Si-beta催化剂上。Pt/Sn-Si-beta催化剂在丙烷脱氢（PDH）中表现出优异的催化性能，其中在550 C时丙烯形成速率为2.3 mol g1Pt h1，丙烯选择性>99%，在600 C时丙烯形成速率更高，为3.1 mol g1Pt h1。强烈的PtSn相互作用和Sn在Si-beta框架中的限制效应抑制了焦炭的形成和Pt团簇的烧结，从而在550 C时的四个循环中几乎不变的催化活性实现了脱氢和再生的良好稳定性。这些进展通过提高催化剂的稳定性和选择性，解决了工业应用中催化剂设计、制造和性能优化的挑战。
