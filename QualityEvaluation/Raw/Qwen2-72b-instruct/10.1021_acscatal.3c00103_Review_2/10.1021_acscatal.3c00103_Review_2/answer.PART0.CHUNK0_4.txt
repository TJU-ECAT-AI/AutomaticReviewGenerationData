1.Recently developed strategies to enhance the catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes include the introduction of promoters to regulate active compounds in Pt-based and metal oxide-based catalysts. Promoters can suppress side reactions, inhibit coke deposition, and stabilize active compounds. Pt-based catalysts have been recognized for their effectiveness in alkane dehydrogenation reactions, and adding metal promoters to form alloys or intermetallic compounds can improve central active components and inhibit catalytic deactivation. Commonly used promoters include Sn, Ga, In, Zn, Cu, Co, and rare-earth elements (REEs). Metal oxide-based catalysts, such as CoOx-, ZnOx-, VOx-, and CrOx-based catalysts, have also been studied extensively. Introducing another metal oxide to form an oxide compound can improve the dispersion of active species and enhance catalytic stability by modifying the coordination and electronic state of host metal oxide sites. The introduction of an appropriate metal oxide or noble metal can greatly enhance the catalytic performance.

1.最近开发的策略，以增强直接脱氢过程中支撑金属催化剂的催化稳定性，包括引入促进剂来调节Pt基和金属氧化物基催化剂中的活性化合物。促进剂可以抑制副反应，抑制焦炭沉积，并稳定活性化合物。Pt基催化剂已被公认为在烷烃脱氢反应中的有效性，添加金属促进剂形成合金或金属间化合物可以改善中心活性成分并抑制催化失活。常用的促进剂包括Sn，Ga，In，Zn，Cu，Co和稀土元素（REEs）。金属氧化物基催化剂，如CoOx-，ZnOx-，VOx-和CrOx-基催化剂，也已被广泛研究。引入另一种金属氧化物形成氧化物化合物可以改善活性物种的分散并增强催化稳定性，通过修改宿主金属氧化物位点的配位和电子状态。引入适当的金属氧化物或贵金属可以大大提高催化性能。
