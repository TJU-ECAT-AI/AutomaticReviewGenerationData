1.Recently developed strategies to enhance the catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes include the introduction of promoters to regulate the active compounds in both Pt-based catalysts and metal oxide-based catalysts. These advancements address the challenges in catalyst design, fabrication, and performance optimization for industrial applications by suppressing side reactions, inhibiting coke deposition, stabilizing active compounds, and improving the dispersion of Pt atoms. The use of metal promoters, such as Sn, Ga, In, Zn, Cu, and Co, to form alloys or intermetallic compounds with Pt has been shown to be effective in enhancing catalytic stability. Additionally, the introduction of rare-earth elements (REEs) and metal oxides, such as CoOx, ZnOx, VOx, and CrOx, can improve the dispersion of active species and modify the coordination and electronic state of host metal oxide sites, leading to enhanced catalytic stability.
