1.Recently developed strategies to enhance the catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes include the introduction of promoters to regulate the active compounds in Pt-based and metal oxide-based catalysts. Promoters can suppress side reactions, inhibit coke deposition, and stabilize active compounds. Pt-based catalysts have been recognized as effective for alkane dehydrogenation reactions, and adding metal promoters to form alloys or intermetallic compounds can improve central active components and inhibit catalytic deactivation. Commonly used promoters include Sn, Ga, In, Zn, Cu, Co, and rare-earth elements (REEs). Subsurface regulation is also a promising method to enhance the catalytic performance of metal alloys. For metal oxide-based catalysts, introducing another metal oxide to form an oxide compound can improve the dispersion of active species and enhance catalytic stability. The introduction of an appropriate metal oxide or noble metal can greatly enhance the catalytic performance.
