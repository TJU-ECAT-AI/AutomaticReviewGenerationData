1.Recently developed strategies to enhance the catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes include the introduction of promoters to regulate the active compounds in both Pt-based and metal oxide-based catalysts. These advancements address challenges in catalyst design, fabrication, and performance optimization by suppressing side reactions, inhibiting coke deposition, stabilizing active compounds, and improving the dispersion of Pt atoms. Pt-based catalysts have been recognized as effective for alkane dehydrogenation reactions due to their high affinity for paraffinic CH bonds. Metal promoters, such as Sn, Ga, In, Zn, Cu, Co, and rare-earth elements (REEs), have been used to form alloys or intermetallic compounds to ameliorate central active components and inhibit catalytic deactivation. Metal oxide-based catalysts, including CoOx-, ZnOx-, VOx-, and CrOx-based catalysts, have also been extensively studied. Introducing another metal oxide to form an oxide compound can improve the dispersion of active species and enhance catalytic stability by modifying the coordination and electronic state of host metal oxide sites. The introduction of an appropriate metal oxide or noble metal into a catalytic system can greatly enhance the catalytic performance.

1.最近开发的策略，以增强直接脱氢过程中支撑金属催化剂的催化稳定性，包括引入促进剂来调节Pt基和金属氧化物基催化剂中的活性化合物。这些进步通过抑制副反应、抑制焦炭沉积、稳定活性化合物和改善Pt原子的分散，解决了催化剂设计、制造和性能优化的挑战。Pt基催化剂因其对烷烃CH键的高亲和力，已被公认为是烷烃脱氢反应的有效催化剂。金属促进剂，如Sn、Ga、In、Zn、Cu、Co和稀土元素（REEs），已被用于形成合金或金属间化合物，以改善中心活性成分并抑制催化失活。包括CoOx、ZnOx、VOx和CrOx基催化剂在内的金属氧化物基催化剂也已被广泛研究。引入另一种金属氧化物形成氧化物化合物可以改善活性物种的分散，并通过修改宿主金属氧化物位点的配位和电子状态来增强催化稳定性。将适当的金属氧化物或贵金属引入催化系统可以大大提高催化性能。
