1.The literature does not provide information on the key strategies and approaches that have been recently developed to enhance the catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes. However, it does describe a specific case study involving the preparation and testing of ZnPt/HZ catalysts for the direct dehydrogenation of propane to propylene. The catalysts were characterized using various techniques, and the optimal 10Zn0.1Pt/HZ catalyst showed high propylene yield and extraordinary dehydrogenation stability over 65 hours at 525 degrees Celsius without any regeneration procedure or hydrogen as auxiliary gas. The catalyst's performance was attributed to the presence of two kinds of active centers: Lewis acidic sites created by framework Zn species and small-sized PtZn particles. The stable state of the active species and strong carbon resistance of the 10Zn0.1Pt/HZ catalyst were confirmed, accounting for the admirable reaction stability of PDH. This catalyst contains much more Zn and less Pt than previously reported PtZn-based dehydrogenation catalysts, breaking the traditional understanding about PtZn catalysts and opening a wide avenue for the design of stable dehydrogenation catalysts.

1.文献没有提供关于最近开发的增强支撑金属催化剂在直接脱氢过程中的催化稳定性的关键策略和方法的信息。但是，它确实描述了一个具体的案例研究，涉及ZnPt/HZ催化剂的制备和测试，用于直接脱氢丙烷至丙烯。催化剂使用各种技术进行了表征，最佳的10Zn0.1Pt/HZ催化剂在525摄氏度下65小时内显示出高丙烯产量和非凡的脱氢稳定性，无需任何再生程序或氢气作为辅助气体。催化剂的性能归因于两种活性中心的存在：由框架Zn物种创建的Lewis酸性位点和小尺寸的PtZn颗粒。10Zn0.1Pt/HZ催化剂的活性物种的稳定状态和强大的碳抗性得到了确认，这解释了PDH反应的令人钦佩的稳定性。这种催化剂含有比以前报道的PtZn基脱氢催化剂更多的Zn和更少的Pt，打破了关于PtZn催化剂的传统理解，为设计稳定的脱氢催化剂开辟了一条广阔的途径。
