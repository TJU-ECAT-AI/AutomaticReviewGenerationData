1.The literature does not provide information on the key strategies and approaches that have been recently developed to enhance the catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes. However, it does report on the preparation and testing of ZnPt/HZ catalysts with different Zn/Pt ratios supported on high-silica HZSM-5 zeolite for the direct dehydrogenation of propane to propylene (PDH). The optimal 10Zn0.1Pt/HZ catalyst, consisting of 1000 ppm Pt and 10 wt% Zn, shows a high propylene yield (about 46%) and extraordinary dehydrogenation stability over 65 h at 525 C without any regeneration procedure or H2 as auxiliary gas. The catalyst has two kinds of active centers which work corporately: (i) Lewis acidic sites created by framework Zn species and (ii) small-sized PtZn particles. The stable state of the active species and strong carbon resistance of 10Zn0.1Pt/HZ related to the interaction effect between Pt and Zn are confirmed, accounting for the admirable reaction stability of PDH. This catalyst contains much more Zn and less Pt than previously reported PtZn-based dehydrogenation catalysts, breaking the traditional understanding about PtZn catalysts and opening a wide avenue for the design of stable dehydrogenation catalysts.

1.文献没有提供关于最近开发的增强支撑金属催化剂在直接脱氢过程中的催化稳定性的关键策略和方法的信息。但是，它确实报道了不同Zn/Pt比率的ZnPt/HZ催化剂在高硅HZSM-5沸石上的制备和测试，用于直接脱氢丙烷至丙烯（PDH）。最优的10Zn0.1Pt/HZ催化剂，由1000 ppm Pt和10 wt% Zn组成，显示出高丙烯产量（约46%）和在525 C下65小时的非凡脱氢稳定性，无需任何再生程序或H2作为辅助气体。该催化剂有两种协同工作的活性中心：（i）由框架Zn物种创建的Lewis酸性位点和（ii）小尺寸的PtZn颗粒。10Zn0.1Pt/HZ的活性物种的稳定状态和强碳抗性与Pt和Zn之间的交互作用效果有关，证实了PDH反应的令人钦佩的稳定性。与之前报道的PtZn基脱氢催化剂相比，这种催化剂含有更多的Zn和更少的Pt，打破了关于PtZn催化剂的传统理解，为设计稳定的脱氢催化剂开辟了广阔的途径。
