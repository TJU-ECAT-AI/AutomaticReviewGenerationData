1.The literature does not provide information on the key strategies and approaches that have been recently developed to enhance the catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes. However, it does describe a specific case study involving the preparation and testing of ZnPt/HZ catalysts for the direct dehydrogenation of propane to propylene. The catalysts were characterized using various techniques, and the optimal 10Zn0.1Pt/HZ catalyst showed high propylene yield and extraordinary dehydrogenation stability. The catalyst contained small-sized PtZn particles and Lewis acidic framework Zn species, which contributed to its high catalytic activity. The interaction effect between Pt and Zn led to the stable state of the active species and strong carbon resistance, accounting for the admirable reaction stability of PDH. This catalyst contained much more Zn and less Pt than previously reported PtZn-based dehydrogenation catalysts, breaking the traditional understanding about PtZn catalysts and opening a wide avenue for the design of stable dehydrogenation catalysts.

1.文献没有提供关于最近开发的增强支撑金属催化剂在直接脱氢过程中的催化稳定性的关键策略和方法的信息。但是，它确实描述了一个具体的案例研究，涉及ZnPt/HZ催化剂的制备和测试，用于直接脱氢丙烷制丙烯。催化剂使用各种技术进行了表征，最佳的10Zn0.1Pt/HZ催化剂显示出高丙烯产量和非凡的脱氢稳定性。该催化剂含有小尺寸的PtZn颗粒和Lewis酸性框架Zn物种，这些物种对其高催化活性有贡献。Pt和Zn之间的相互作用效应导致活性物种的稳定状态和强碳抗性，这解释了PDH的令人赞赏的反应稳定性。与以前报道的PtZn基脱氢催化剂相比，这种催化剂含有更多的Zn和更少的Pt，打破了关于PtZn催化剂的传统理解，为设计稳定的脱氢催化剂开辟了广阔的途径。
