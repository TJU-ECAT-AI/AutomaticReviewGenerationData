[1] "Rare-earthplatinum alloy nanoparticles in mesoporous zeolite for catalysis Platinum is a much used catalyst that, in petrochemical processes, is often alloyed with other metals to improve catalytic activity, selectivity and longevity1,2,3,4,5."
[2] "Such catalysts are usually prepared in the form of metallic nanoparticles supported on porous solids, and their production involves reducing metal precursor compounds under a H2 flow at high temperatures6."
[3] "The method works well when using easily reducible late transition metals, but Pt alloy formation with rare-earth elements through the H2 reduction route is almost impossible owing to the low chemical potential of rare-earth element oxides6."
[4] "Here we use as support a mesoporous zeolite that has pore walls with surface framework defects (called silanol nests) and show that the zeolite enables alloy formation between Pt and rare-earth elements."
[5] "We find that the silanol nests enable the rare-earth elements to exist as single atomic species with a substantially higher chemical potential compared with that of the bulk oxide, making it possible for them to diffuse onto Pt."
[6] "High-resolution transmission electron microscopy and hydrogen chemisorption measurements indicate that the resultant bimetallic nanoparticles supported on the mesoporous zeolite are intermetallic compounds, which we find to be stable, highly active and selective catalysts for the propane dehydrogenation reaction."
[7] "When used with late transition metals, the same preparation strategy produces Pt alloy catalysts that incorporate an unusually large amount of the second metal and, in the case of the PtCo alloy, show high catalytic activity and selectivity in the preferential oxidation of carbon monoxide in H2."

1. Recent advancements in catalytic stability for supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes include the use of rare-earth-platinum alloy nanoparticles supported on mesoporous zeolites. These catalysts are typically prepared by reducing metal precursor compounds under a hydrogen flow at high temperatures. However, the formation of Pt alloys with rare-earth elements through this method is challenging due to the low chemical potential of rare-earth element oxides. A novel approach uses a mesoporous zeolite with surface framework defects, known as silanol nests, which enable the rare-earth elements to exist as single atomic species with a higher chemical potential. This allows them to diffuse onto Pt, forming stable, highly active, and selective intermetallic compounds for propane dehydrogenation. When applied to late transition metals, this preparation strategy results in Pt alloy catalysts with a large amount of the second metal, such as in the case of the PtCo alloy, which exhibits high catalytic activity and selectivity in the preferential oxidation of carbon monoxide in hydrogen.

1. 最近在直接脱氢过程中支持金属催化剂的催化稳定性方面的进展包括使用在介孔沸石上支持的稀土铂合金纳米颗粒。这些催化剂通常通过在高温下在氢气流下还原金属前体化合物来制备。然而，通过这种方法形成Pt与稀土元素的合金是具有挑战性的，因为稀土元素氧化物的化学势较低。一种新颖的方法使用具有表面框架缺陷（称为硅醇巢）的介孔沸石，使稀土元素能够以单原子物种的形式存在，具有较高的化学势。这使它们能够扩散到Pt上，形成稳定的、高活性和选择性的间金属化合物，用于丙烷脱氢。当应用于晚期过渡金属时，这种制备策略导致Pt合金催化剂含有大量第二种金属，例如在PtCo合金的情况下，其在氢气中对一氧化碳的优先氧化显示出高催化活性和选择性。
