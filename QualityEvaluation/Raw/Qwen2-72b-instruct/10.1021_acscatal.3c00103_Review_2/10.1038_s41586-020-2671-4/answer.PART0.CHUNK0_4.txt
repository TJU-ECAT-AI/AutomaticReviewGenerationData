[1] "Rare-earthplatinum alloy nanoparticles in mesoporous zeolite for catalysis Platinum is a much used catalyst that, in petrochemical processes, is often alloyed with other metals to improve catalytic activity, selectivity and longevity1,2,3,4,5."
[2] "Such catalysts are usually prepared in the form of metallic nanoparticles supported on porous solids, and their production involves reducing metal precursor compounds under a H2 flow at high temperatures6."
[3] "The method works well when using easily reducible late transition metals, but Pt alloy formation with rare-earth elements through the H2 reduction route is almost impossible owing to the low chemical potential of rare-earth element oxides6."
[4] "Here we use as support a mesoporous zeolite that has pore walls with surface framework defects (called silanol nests) and show that the zeolite enables alloy formation between Pt and rare-earth elements."
[5] "We find that the silanol nests enable the rare-earth elements to exist as single atomic species with a substantially higher chemical potential compared with that of the bulk oxide, making it possible for them to diffuse onto Pt."
[6] "High-resolution transmission electron microscopy and hydrogen chemisorption measurements indicate that the resultant bimetallic nanoparticles supported on the mesoporous zeolite are intermetallic compounds, which we find to be stable, highly active and selective catalysts for the propane dehydrogenation reaction."
[7] "When used with late transition metals, the same preparation strategy produces Pt alloy catalysts that incorporate an unusually large amount of the second metal and, in the case of the PtCo alloy, show high catalytic activity and selectivity in the preferential oxidation of carbon monoxide in H2."

1.The key strategies and approaches that have been recently developed to enhance the catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes include the use of rare-earth-platinum alloy nanoparticles supported on mesoporous zeolites. These catalysts are prepared by reducing metal precursor compounds under a hydrogen flow at high temperatures. However, the formation of Pt alloys with rare-earth elements through this route is challenging due to the low chemical potential of rare-earth element oxides. To overcome this, a mesoporous zeolite with surface framework defects, known as silanol nests, is used as a support. These silanol nests enable the rare-earth elements to exist as single atomic species with a higher chemical potential, facilitating their diffusion onto Pt and the formation of intermetallic compounds. The resultant bimetallic nanoparticles supported on the mesoporous zeolite are stable, highly active, and selective catalysts for propane dehydrogenation. This approach can also be applied to other late transition metals, such as Co, to produce Pt alloy catalysts with high catalytic activity and selectivity in the preferential oxidation of carbon monoxide in hydrogen.

1.最近开发的关键策略和方法，以增强直接脱氢过程中支撑金属催化剂的催化稳定性，包括使用在介孔沸石上支撑的稀土铂合金纳米颗粒。这些催化剂通过在高温下在氢气流下还原金属前体化合物来制备。然而，通过这种路线形成Pt与稀土元素的合金是具有挑战性的，因为稀土元素氧化物的化学势较低。为了克服这一点，使用具有表面框架缺陷（称为硅醇巢）的介孔沸石作为支撑。这些硅醇巢使稀土元素能够以单原子物种的形式存在，具有更高的化学势，这促进了它们向Pt的扩散和间金属化合物的形成。在介孔沸石上支撑的最终双金属纳米颗粒是稳定、高活性和选择性的丙烷脱氢催化剂。这种方法也可以应用于其他晚期过渡金属，如Co，以产生在氢气中优先氧化二氧化碳具有高催化活性和选择性的Pt合金催化剂。
