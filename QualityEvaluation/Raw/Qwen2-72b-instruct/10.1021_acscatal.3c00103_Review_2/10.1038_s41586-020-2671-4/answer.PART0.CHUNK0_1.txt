[1] "Rare-earthplatinum alloy nanoparticles in mesoporous zeolite for catalysis Platinum is a much used catalyst that, in petrochemical processes, is often alloyed with other metals to improve catalytic activity, selectivity and longevity1,2,3,4,5. Such catalysts are usually prepared in the form of metallic nanoparticles supported on porous solids, and their production involves reducing metal precursor compounds under a H2 flow at high temperatures6."
[2] "The industrial PDH process has been using PtSn bimetallic catalysts supported on porous alumina for nearly three decades, since its discovery in the early 1990s3,7. The Pt metal alone exhibits high initial catalytic activity, but rapidly deactivates as a result of coke deposition on the Pt surface. The coke deposition also causes an undesirable loss of the catalytic selectivity to propylene. To alleviate these problems, Sn is introduced to form an alloy with Pt nanoparticles and thereby dilute the Pt surface with inactive Sn atoms and break up coke-generating Pt ensembles."
[3] "Our search for a highly active and more durable PDH catalyst has focused on using a siliceous MFI zeolite with a hierarchical micro-/mesoporous structure as a replacement for the alumina support. This zeolite, synthesized using a multi-ammonium surfactant as a structure-directing agent, has attracted attention as an advanced catalyst support8,9,10,11,12,13 owing to its unique structure, which comprises ultrathin zeolite frameworks and three-dimensionally interconnected mesopores that boost the catalytic performance of supported metals by providing both facile reactant and product diffusion and high metal nanoparticle dispersion within the mesopores12,13."
[4] "The formation of the Pt3La and Pt3Y nanoparticles on the degallated zeolite brought a striking enhancement in all aspects of the PDH catalytic performance, including activity, selectivity and durability, as shown in Fig. 2. The catalytic reaction was performed at 580C using a pure propane flow at a large space velocity (see Methods), and these harsh operating conditions caused even the conventional PtSn/alumina catalyst to experience severe coke formation and catalyst deactivation within 1 d. In sharp contrast, the Pt3La intermetallic nanoparticles supported on the degallated zeolite (denoted as PtLa/mz-deGa, where mz stands for mesoporous zeolite) showed a high initial propane conversion of 40% (close to the equilibrium conversion) and underwent extremely slow deactivation, retaining 8% conversion even after 30 days of reaction."

1.Recent strategies to enhance the catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes include the use of alloying elements to improve catalytic activity, selectivity, and longevity. Platinum, a commonly used catalyst in petrochemical processes, is often alloyed with other metals to form metallic nanoparticles supported on porous solids. The production of these catalysts involves reducing metal precursor compounds under a hydrogen flow at high temperatures.
2.In the propane dehydrogenation (PDH) process, PtSn bimetallic catalysts supported on porous alumina have been used for nearly three decades. However, Pt metal alone exhibits high initial catalytic activity but rapidly deactivates due to coke deposition on the Pt surface, which also causes a loss of catalytic selectivity to propylene. To address these problems, Sn is introduced to form an alloy with Pt nanoparticles, diluting the Pt surface with inactive Sn atoms and breaking up coke-generating Pt ensembles.
3.Researchers have focused on using a siliceous MFI zeolite with a hierarchical micro-/mesoporous structure as a replacement for the alumina support. This zeolite, synthesized using a multi-ammonium surfactant as a structure-directing agent, has attracted attention as an advanced catalyst support due to its unique structure, which comprises ultrathin zeolite frameworks and three-dimensionally interconnected mesopores. These features boost the catalytic performance of supported metals by providing facile reactant and product diffusion and high metal nanoparticle dispersion within the mesopores.
4.The formation of Pt3La and Pt3Y nanoparticles on the degallated zeolite has significantly enhanced the PDH catalytic performance, including activity, selectivity, and durability. Under harsh operating conditions, the conventional PtSn/alumina catalyst experiences severe coke formation and catalyst deactivation within one day. In contrast, the Pt3La intermetallic nanoparticles supported on the degallated zeolite show high initial propane conversion and undergo extremely slow deactivation, retaining 8% conversion even after 30 days of reaction.

1.最近在直接脱氢过程中增强负载金属催化剂催化稳定性的策略包括使用合金元素来提高催化活性、选择性和寿命。铂是石化过程中常用的催化剂，通常与其它金属合金化，形成负载在多孔固体上的金属纳米颗粒。这些催化剂的生产涉及在高温下用氢气流还原金属前体化合物。
2.在丙烷脱氢(PDH)过程中，近三十年来一直使用负载在多孔氧化铝上的PtSn双金属催化剂。然而，单独的Pt金属虽然具有高初始催化活性，但会因Pt表面的焦炭沉积而迅速失活，这也会导致催化选择性向丙烯的损失。为了解决这些问题，引入Sn与Pt纳米颗粒形成合金，用非活性Sn原子稀释Pt表面，破坏产生焦炭的Pt集合体。
3.研究人员将注意力集中在使用具有分级微/介孔结构的硅质MFI沸石作为氧化铝载体的替代品上。这种沸石使用多铵表面活性剂作为结构导向剂合成，因其独特的结构而受到关注，该结构由超薄沸石框架和三维互连介孔组成。这些特征通过提供反应物和产物的易扩散以及介孔内金属纳米颗粒的高分散性，提高了负载金属的催化性能。
4.Pt3La和Pt3Y纳米颗粒在脱镓沸石上的形成显著提高了PDH催化性能，包括活性、选择性和耐久性。在苛刻的操作条件下，传统的PtSn/氧化铝催化剂在一天内就会经历严重的焦炭形成和催化剂失活。相比之下，负载在脱镓沸石上的Pt3La间金属纳米颗粒显示出高初始丙烷转化率，并且经历极其缓慢的失活，即使在30天的反应后仍保持8%的转化率。
