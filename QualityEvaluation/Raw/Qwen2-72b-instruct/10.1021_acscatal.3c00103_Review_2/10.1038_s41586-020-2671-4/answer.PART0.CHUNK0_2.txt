[1] "Such catalysts are usually prepared in the form of metallic nanoparticles supported on porous solids, and their production involves reducing metal precursor compounds under a H2 flow at high temperatures6."
[2] "Here we use as support a mesoporous zeolite that has pore walls with surface framework defects (called silanol nests) and show that the zeolite enables alloy formation between Pt and rare-earth elements."
[3] "The same preparation strategy produces Pt alloy catalysts that incorporate an unusually large amount of the second metal and, in the case of the PtCo alloy, show high catalytic activity and selectivity in the preferential oxidation of carbon monoxide in H2."
[4] "The PtREE incorporation in the mesoporous zeolite was conducted by co-impregnation of aqueous solutions of Pt(NH3)4(NO3)2 and either La(NO3)3·6H2O or Y(NO3)3·6H2O, followed by heating under an O2 flow at 350C and subsequently under H2 at 700C (see Methods)."
[5] "The formation of the Pt3La and Pt3Y nanoparticles on the degallated zeolite brought a striking enhancement in all aspects of the PDH catalytic performance, including activity, selectivity and durability, as shown in Fig. 2."
[6] "The PtREE/zeolite showed formation of Pt3La and Pt3Y nanoparticles throughout the zeolite support."
[7] "The PtREE/zeolite sample shown in Fig. 1 was prepared using a degallated zeolite containing a large number of silanol nest sites."
[8] "The PtREE/zeolite showed a high initial propane conversion of 40% (close to the equilibrium conversion) and underwent extremely slow deactivation, retaining 8% conversion even after 30 days of reaction."
[9] "The PtREE/zeolite contained a small amount of Ga (Si/Ga = 598) even after the degallation, and that this may participate in the catalytic function17,18."
[10] "The effect of the remaining Ga was examined from the differences in PDH performance of mz-deGa, La/mz-deGa and Pt/mz-deGa, as shown in Extended Data Fig. 7."
[11] "The PtREE/zeolite as a support would allow the discovery of not only REE-based alloy catalysts, but also other transition metal-based alloy catalysts with various compositions and structures, opening up new opportunities for catalytic applications."

1.Recent strategies to enhance the catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes include the use of mesoporous zeolites with surface framework defects, known as silanol nests, which enable alloy formation between Pt and rare-earth elements. This is achieved by co-impregnation of aqueous solutions of Pt and rare-earth element precursors, followed by heating under an O2 flow and subsequently under H2 at high temperatures. The formation of intermetallic compounds, such as Pt3La and Pt3Y, on the degallated zeolite significantly enhances the catalytic performance in terms of activity, selectivity, and durability. The PtREE/zeolite catalysts exhibit high initial propane conversion and slow deactivation, retaining significant conversion even after extended periods of reaction. The presence of a small amount of Ga in the zeolite may also contribute to the catalytic function. These advancements address the challenges in catalyst design, fabrication, and performance optimization by providing a stable and highly active catalyst for industrial applications, particularly in propane dehydrogenation.

1.最近，为了提高直接脱氢过程中支撑金属催化剂的催化稳定性，开发了以下策略和方法：使用具有表面框架缺陷（称为硅醇巢）的介孔沸石，这使得Pt和稀土元素之间的合金形成成为可能。通过共浸渍Pt和稀土元素前体的水溶液，然后在O2流下加热，随后在高温下在H2下加热来实现这一点。在脱镓沸石上形成Pt3La和Pt3Y等金属间化合物，显著提高了催化性能，包括活性、选择性和耐久性。PtREE/沸石催化剂表现出高初始丙烷转化率和缓慢的失活，即使在长时间反应后仍能保持显著的转化率。沸石中存在少量的Ga也可能对催化功能产生影响。这些进步通过提供一种稳定且活性高的催化剂来解决催化剂设计、制造和性能优化的挑战，特别适用于工业应用中的丙烷脱氢。
