[1] "Rare-earthplatinum alloy nanoparticles in mesoporous zeolite for catalysis Platinum is a much used catalyst that, in petrochemical processes, is often alloyed with other metals to improve catalytic activity, selectivity and longevity1,2,3,4,5. Such catalysts are usually prepared in the form of metallic nanoparticles supported on porous solids, and their production involves reducing metal precursor compounds under a H2 flow at high temperatures6."
[2] "We find that the silanol nests enable the rare-earth elements to exist as single atomic species with a substantially higher chemical potential compared with that of the bulk oxide, making it possible for them to diffuse onto Pt."
[3] "High-resolution transmission electron microscopy and hydrogen chemisorption measurements indicate that the resultant bimetallic nanoparticles supported on the mesoporous zeolite are intermetallic compounds, which we find to be stable, highly active and selective catalysts for the propane dehydrogenation reaction."
[4] "The same preparation strategy produces Pt alloy catalysts that incorporate an unusually large amount of the second metal and, in the case of the PtCo alloy, show high catalytic activity and selectivity in the preferential oxidation of carbon monoxide in H2."

1.Recent advancements in catalytic stability for supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes include the use of rare-earth-platinum alloy nanoparticles supported on mesoporous zeolites. These catalysts are prepared by reducing metal precursor compounds under a hydrogen flow at high temperatures, resulting in metallic nanoparticles. The key strategy involves utilizing silanol nests in the zeolite support, which enable rare-earth elements to exist as single atomic species with higher chemical potential, facilitating their diffusion onto platinum. This results in the formation of stable, highly active, and selective intermetallic compounds for propane dehydrogenation. Additionally, the same preparation strategy can produce Pt alloy catalysts with a large amount of the second metal, such as in the case of the PtCo alloy, which exhibits high catalytic activity and selectivity in the preferential oxidation of carbon monoxide in hydrogen.

1.在直接脱氢过程中，最近在提高负载金属催化剂的催化稳定性方面取得的进展包括使用在介孔沸石上支持的稀土铂合金纳米粒子。这些催化剂通过在高温下在氢气流中还原金属前体化合物来制备，从而产生金属纳米粒子。关键策略涉及利用沸石支持物中的硅醇巢，使稀土元素以单原子物种的形式存在，具有更高的化学势，从而促进它们在铂上的扩散。这导致形成稳定的、高活性的和选择性的丙烷脱氢的金属间化合物。此外，相同的制备策略可以产生含有大量第二种金属的Pt合金催化剂，例如在PtCo合金的情况下，该合金在氢气中对一氧化碳的优先氧化显示出高催化活性和选择性。
