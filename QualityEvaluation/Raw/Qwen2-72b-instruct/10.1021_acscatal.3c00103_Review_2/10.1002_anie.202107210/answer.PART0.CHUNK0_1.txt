1.The literature does not provide a comprehensive overview of recent strategies and approaches to enhance the catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes. However, it does describe a novel catalyst design concept involving the double decoration of intermetallic PtGa with Pb and Ca, which synergistically improves the geometric and electronic properties of the catalyst, leading to outstandingly high catalytic stability in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) at 600C. This design addresses the challenge of catalyst deactivation at high temperatures by blocking undesired side reactions and promoting propylene desorption, thereby prolonging the catalyst's lifetime.

1.文献没有提供最近增强支撑金属催化剂在直接脱氢过程中的催化稳定性的全面策略和方法。但是，它描述了一种新颖的催化剂设计概念，涉及通过Pb和Ca双重修饰PtGa金属间化合物，这协同地改善了催化剂的几何和电子特性，导致在600C的丙烷脱氢（PDH）中具有出色的高催化稳定性。这种设计通过阻止不需要的副反应和促进丙烯解吸，解决了高温下催化剂失活的挑战，从而延长了催化剂的寿命。
