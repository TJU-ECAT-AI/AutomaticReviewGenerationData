[1] "A catalyst design consisting of the double-decoration of nanoparticulate intermetallic PtGa with Pb and Ca was applied to produce an ultra-stable catalyst for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) at a high temperature."
[2] "PtGaCaPb/SiO2 exhibited outstanding catalytic stability in PDH at 600C, and almost no deactivation was observed for up to 1month."
[3] "Herein, we report a novel catalyst design concept, namely, the double decoration of PtGa intermetallics by Pb and Ca, which synergize the geometric and electronic promotion effects on the catalyst stability, respectively."
[4] "Pb is deposited on the three-fold Pt3 sites of the PtGa nanoparticles to block them, whereas Ca, which affords an electron-enriched single-atom-like Pt1 site, is placed around the nanoparticles."
[5] "Thus, PtGaCaPb/SiO2 exhibits an outstandingly high catalytic stability, even at 600C (kd=0.00033h1, τ=3067h), and almost no deactivation of the catalyst was observed for up to 1month for the first time."

1.Recent advancements in catalyst design for direct dehydrogenation processes include the development of a novel catalyst design concept, the double decoration of PtGa intermetallics by Pb and Ca. This strategy synergizes the geometric and electronic promotion effects on the catalyst stability. Pb is deposited on the three-fold Pt3 sites of the PtGa nanoparticles to block them, while Ca, which provides an electron-enriched single-atom-like Pt1 site, is placed around the nanoparticles. The resulting PtGaCaPb/SiO2 catalyst exhibits outstanding catalytic stability in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) at 600C, with almost no deactivation observed for up to 1 month. This addresses the challenges in catalyst design, fabrication, and performance optimization for industrial applications by achieving ultra-stable catalytic performance at high temperatures.

1.最近在直接脱氢过程的催化剂设计方面的进展包括开发了一种新型催化剂设计概念，即通过Pb和Ca双修饰PtGa金属间化合物。这种策略通过在催化剂稳定性上协同几何和电子促进效应。Pb沉积在PtGa纳米颗粒的三重Pt3位点上以阻塞它们，而Ca，提供电子丰富的类似单原子的Pt1位点，被放置在纳米颗粒周围。由此产生的PtGaCaPb/SiO2催化剂在600C的丙烷脱氢（PDH）中表现出优异的催化稳定性，首次观察到长达1个月几乎没有催化剂失活。这通过在高温下实现超稳定的催化性能，解决了催化剂设计、制造和性能优化的工业应用挑战。
