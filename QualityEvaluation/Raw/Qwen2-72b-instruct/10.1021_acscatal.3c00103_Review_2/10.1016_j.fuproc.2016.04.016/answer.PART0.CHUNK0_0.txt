[1] "Although the equilibrium conversion of alkanes increases with temperature, alkene selectivity decreases with increasing temperature and chain length due to an increased tendency toward dehydrocyclization/aromatisation, thermal cracking and coke formation."
[2] "Direct dehydrogenation of lower alkanes is an energy intensive reaction; however, oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) has the potential to lower the energy requirement for achieving dehydrogenation."
[3] "ODH can be considered as tandem endothermic (dehydrogenation, CnH2n + 2  CnH2n + H2) and exothermic (oxidation, H2 + O2  H2O) processes, with an overall thermodynamic summation, CnH2n + 2 + O2  CnH2n + H2O."
[4] "Although the process is not thermo-neutral, part of the energy required for the endothermic reaction is augmented by the exothermic reaction."
[5] "Thus, ODH of alkanes takes place at lower temperature compared to the corresponding non-ODH."
[6] "This lower temperature requirement of ODH compared to non-ODH and cracking is encouraging and provides motivation for continued efforts to develop ODH into an industrial technology."
[7] "Although ODH is attractive because of the energy intensification advantage, commercial ODH technologies hinge on innovative catalyst and process design, i.e. proper synergy of the endothermic dehydrogenation step with the exothermic hydrogen combustion and design of selective CH and hydrogen combustion catalysts."
[8] "In this report, we provide an overview on CH activation and reaction routes to alkane dehydrogenation."
[9] "We seek to gain insights about components of the active sites of CH activation to provide a platform for rational design of new efficient catalysts for dehydrogenation of lower alkanes."
[10] "We focus on propane dehydrogenation because of the need for alternative and/or complementary technology for propene production to supplement existing technologies."
[11] "We survey non-oxidative and oxidative dehydrogenation approaches, and examine reaction routes that are intermediate between these two main approaches."

1.Recent strategies to enhance the catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes include the use of oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) to lower the energy requirement for achieving dehydrogenation. ODH can be considered as tandem endothermic (dehydrogenation) and exothermic (oxidation) processes, with an overall thermodynamic summation. Although the process is not thermo-neutral, part of the energy required for the endothermic reaction is augmented by the exothermic reaction. This lower temperature requirement of ODH compared to non-ODH and cracking is encouraging and provides motivation for continued efforts to develop ODH into an industrial technology. However, commercial ODH technologies hinge on innovative catalyst and process design, i.e. proper synergy of the endothermic dehydrogenation step with the exothermic hydrogen combustion and design of selective CH and hydrogen combustion catalysts. Insights about components of the active sites of CH activation can provide a platform for rational design of new efficient catalysts for dehydrogenation of lower alkanes.

1.最近在直接脱氢过程中增强负载金属催化剂催化稳定性的策略包括使用氧化脱氢(ODH)来降低实现脱氢所需的能量需求。ODH可以被认为是串联的吸热(脱氢)和放热(氧化)过程，具有总体热力学总和。虽然该过程不是热中性的，但吸热反应所需的能量部分由放热反应增强。与非ODH和裂解相比，ODH的较低温度要求令人鼓舞，并为将ODH发展为工业技术提供了持续努力的动力。然而，商业ODH技术取决于创新的催化剂和工艺设计，即吸热脱氢步骤与放热氢燃烧的适当协同作用，以及选择性CH和氢燃烧催化剂的设计。关于CH活化活性位点组分的见解可以为设计新的高效催化剂用于较低烷烃的脱氢提供平台。
