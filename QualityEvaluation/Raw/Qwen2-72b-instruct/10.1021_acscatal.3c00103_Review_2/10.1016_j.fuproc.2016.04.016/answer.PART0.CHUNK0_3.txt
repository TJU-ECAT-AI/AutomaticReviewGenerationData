[1] "Catalyst improvement endeavors can benefit from insights on alkane CH bond activation mechanisms."
[2] "Developing direct routes to obtain key organic chemicals from lower alkanes would benefit industry."
[3] "Lower alkanes are relatively inert, and they exhibit little or no reactivity at conditions typical for activating functional group reactions in organic compounds because they lack low-lying vacant orbitals or lone pair electrons."
[4] "Alkanes are made up non-polar CC and CH bonds. These bonds consist of strongly localised electron pairs that are usually induced to reactivity under severe conditions (e.g., at high temperature or pressure, or with the use of aggressive reagents)."
[5] "The first and rate-limiting step of alkane dehydrogenation using platinum or chromium oxide-based catalysts involves CH activation."
[6] "Although a number of efforts have been made to gain insight on the mechanism of the reaction, questions still remain, especially regarding the pathway of the CH activation."
[7] "It is of fundamental and applied interest to know whether the first CH bond cleavage is homolytic or heterolytic."
[8] "If it is a heterolytic pathway, it will further be of interest to know whether the first hydrogen from the alkane substrate is abstracted as a proton or as a hydride ion."
[9] "This knowledge will benefit catalyst improvement efforts."
[10] "The simple impregnation techniques for preparing supported (especially alumina) metal and oxide catalysts becloud their structural heterogeneity."
[11] "This structural heterogeneity makes the properties-performance correlation of the catalysts complicated."
[12] "Microporous zeolites are structurally defined framework materials that may constitute a good starting point for obtaining more precise information on the properties-performance correlation of dehydrogenation catalysts."
[13] "In the next section, we examine adsorption and non-oxidative dehydrogenation of propane on microporous zeolite-based catalysts."
[14] "Although several solid acid catalysts are used in alkane conversions, zeolites have the advantage of possessing a well-defined structure, allowing the structure-activity relationship to be easily deduced."
[15] "Therefore, it is instructive to examine non-oxidative dehydrogenation of light alkanes over zeolite catalysts."
[16] "A detailed knowledge of the adsorption mechanism of lower alkane molecules on zeolite is of interest in this context, especially for informed tuning of zeolite properties to allow efficient and selective dehydrogenation of alkanes."
[17] "Light alkanes are adsorbed on zeolites via dispersive interaction."
[18] "Protons and the exchanged metals ions are typically the active sites in zeolites, while the zeolite framework plays the role of anchor for the active sites and/or dispersion medium for the reactants."
[19] "The framework of microporous zeolites exerts dispersive forces on the reactant's molecules that depend on the shape, channel and cavity of the framework."
[20] "In addition, the nature and the density of the active sites influence the framework dispersion forces."
[21] "Recent reports have shown that the strong electrostatic field between protons or exchanged metal ions and basic oxygen species can enhance and/or induce polarization of bonds in hydrocarbon adsorbates."
[22] "This agrees with Hashiguchi et al., who found enhanced activation of the CH bond on a homogeneous catalyst."
[23] "Wender et al. showed that 3040% of heat adsorption in n-alkanes on Na-zeolite is due to polarization of the adsorbates."
[24] "Subbotina et al. also demonstrated that the CH bond of ethane is more strongly polarized on Mg2 + and Ca2 + forms of Y zeolite than on Na+ forms."
[25] "Mg2 +-Y zeolite molecules exhibit weaker adsorption and polarization of ethane than Ca2 +-zeolites."
[26] "Based on charge density considerations, Mg2 + cations are expected to exhibit a stronger polarizing effect than Ca2 + cations."
[27] "Subbotina et al. explain that because of the smaller ionic radius of Mg2 +, it is more strongly shielded by the surrounding oxygen atoms of the zeolite lattice than a Ca2 + ion, thereby reducing the polarizing effect of Mg2 + on the hydrocarbon adsorbate."
[28] "Sievers et al. also report that the La3 + form of X zeolite induces strong polarization of adsorbed alkane molecules; partial positive charges were induced on secondary and tertiary carbon atoms of alkane molecules."
[29] "The authors suggest that the polarization may be viewed as an intermediate condition to hydride abstraction (which is an important elementary step in CH activation)."
[30] "They add that CH bond polarization was enhanced by physisorbed water molecules that coordinate with La3 + cations."
[31] "The enhanced polarization of CH bonds by the presence of water molecules on La3 +X zeolite may have a beneficial effect in oxidative dehydrogenation where water is a by-product."
[32] "Alkane polarization studies on Na+, Mg2 +, Ca2 +, and La3 + exchanged X-zeolites indicate that the polarizing effect increases with increasing charge magnitude and ionic radius."
[33] "Note that these alkane polarizing cations occupy the same position on the zeolites as the well-known CH activation cations/metals, and thus the CH polarizing effect has a complementary effect on CH activation."
[34] "This may add to the number of relevant variables and increase the challenge of optimizing the ratio of activation/polarizing cations among exchangeable sites (Si/Al ratio), as well as the sequence for incorporating the cations or metals during catalyst preparation."
[35] "Further, it is important to note that the choice of cations should be such that they exhibit no catalytic (oligomerization, isomerization, aromatisation or oxidation) effects on the target alkene products at the reaction condition."
[36] "Furthermore, it may be beneficial to create a CH polarization effect on the zeolite framework."
[37] "This can be achieved by appropriate chance of framework atoms."
[38] "Since active sites are usually created on the zeolite frameworks."
[39] "The activation of CH bonds of light alkanes occurs readily on super electrophiles (super Brnsted and super Lewis acid) at low temperatures."
[40] "Although CH activation on zeolites have been observed at low temperatures, industrial alkane reactions on zeolites are usually carried out at high temperatures."
[41] "Several experimental and theoretical studies on the molecular dynamics of light alkanes on zeolite have been published."
[42] "However, despite the decades of intensive investigations on the subject, the actual mechanism of CH activation on acid zeolite is still debated."
[43] "Two CH activation paths are generally recognized: the unimolecular/protolytic mechanism and the bimolecular/carbenium chain mechanism."
[44] "The unimolecular mechanism involves direct protonation of an alkane-forming carbonium ion intermediate."
[45] "The proton can be inserted into either a CC or CH bond of the alkane."
[46] "Proton insertion through the CC bond leads to cracking of the alkane, with the acid site regenerated."
[47] "Insertion through the HC bond yields H2 and a carbenium ion/alkoxide intermediate."
[48] "Desorption of alkene from the intermediate regenerates the acid, or the alkoxide can enter the bimolecular conversion path."
[49] "In the bimolecular mechanism of CH activation, the alkoxide intermediate constitutes the active sites and CH activation occurs through hydride transfer from a second alkane molecule forming another alkoxide."
[50] "This may be followed by βscission to regenerate the active site and complete the catalytic cycle."
[51] "For example, activation of propane on acid zeolite based on the two mechanisms is illustrated in Scheme 1."
[52] "Low reactant partial pressure and high temperature favor unimolecular dehydrogenation of alkane on acid zeolite."
[53] "These conditions favor the endothermic desorption step (rate limiting step) leading to propene."
[54] "In contrast, high partial pressure and low temperature favor the bimolecular mechanism leading to a low propene yield."
[55] "The two molecular mechanisms devoid of side reactions give fairly predictable product distribution."
[56] "However, the products of each route are prone to side reactions (dimerization, oligomerization, isomerization & aromatisation) in the presence of Bronsted acid sites."
[57] "Hence propene selectivity on acidic zeolite is very low and products rich in aromatics are usually obtained."
[58] "The active sites (alkoxide intermediate) of the bimolecular pathway are formed in situ."
[59] "The alkoxide intermediate is made up of an alkyl carbenium ion ionically held to the zeolite framework oxygen ion."
[60] "The active sites of the unimolecular pathway are the charge balancing protons of the zeolite framework."
[61] "A proton and a carbenium ion are an electrophilic or Lewis acid species (a proton can also be considered as a special case of Lewis acidity)."
[62] "The two pathways essentially involve electrophilic CH activation."
[63] "The electrophiles (proton and carbenium ion) activate CH at high temperatures (500 C), giving low conversion rates of light alkanes and poor selectivity to corresponding alkenes."
[64] "Iglesia and co-workers used isotopic labeling studies to demonstrate that CH activation is not the rate-limiting step in the dehydrogenation of propane on H-ZSM-5 and Ga/H-ZSM-5."
[65] "They proposed that the CH bond cleavage produces an H-adatom and an alkoxide intermediate."
[66] "Desorption of an alkene from the alkoxide regenerates the proton sites on the zeolites."
[67] "An alkoxide intermediate may also discharge as a hydrogen rich species through cracking."
[68] "Iglesia et al. proposed that desorption or disposal of the H-adatom from the CH bond cleavage is the rate-limiting step."
[69] "A similar deduction was reached by Yu et al."
[70] "who found that desorption of the alkoxides intermediate is the rate-limiting step under conditions that favor the unimolecular mechanism."
[71] "The above proposition has been demonstrated on metal (e.g., Ga, Zn, and Co) exchanged zeolites."
[72] "The specific role of the exchanged metals has been the subject of several reports with special attention on Ga and Zn."
[73] "Although the framework Ga2O3 on H-MFI seems to have a CH polarization effect on desorbed methane, Ga2O3 exhibits lower CH activation activity."
[74] "The physical mixture of Ga2O3/HMFI displays higher propane aromatisation activity than pure H-MFI."
[75] "Similar synergistic effects have been reported for Zn/H-MFI and Co/H-MFI."
[76] "Exchanged cations behave as monomeric species at the exchange sites of zeolite."
[77] "Iglesia and Biscardi hypothesized that the monomeric species enhance propane conversion by promoting re-combinative desorption (RD) of the H-adatom formed from the CH cleavage."
[78] "It is worthwhile noting that the exchange cations (electrophilic species) constitute the CH activation sites."
[79] "Hence, more insights are required about their additional role in promoting RD."
[80] "However, the authors did not provide further information on the nature of the H-adatoms and the mechanism of RD."
[81] "In the next section, we examine the mechanism of desorption of H-adatoms over Ga and Zn exchanged H-ZSM-5."
[82] "The exchanged metal ions in zeolites are held ionically by one or more basic oxygen atoms."
[83] "Different species have been suggested, depending on the density of the cation exchange site of the zeolite and method of introduction of the metals."
[84] "According to Kanansky et al."
[85] "the exchanged Zn and Ga species on H-ZSM-5 and their mechanism of CH activation are distinctively different."
[86] "Zn and Ga are introduced on H-ZSM-5 through a vapor deposition technique using Zn metal vapor and Ga(CH3)3 as the source of Zn and Ga, respectively."
[87] "The metal introduction technique allows quantitative exchange of the zeolite protons which leads to Zn/Al = 0.5 and Ga/Al = 1, respectively."
[88] "Zn2 + is generated directly, but Ga+ is produced by H2 treatment at 500 C to release the methyl groups."
[89] "The proposed active sites are OZn2+O and OGa+, respectively."
[90] "The mechanism of CH activation with ethane by the two sites under the same reaction conditions are summarized in Scheme 2."
[91] "The proposed mechanism is in agreement with the mechanism suggested from calculations using the GAUSSIAN 94 program for ethane activation on Zn-exchanged zeolite by Frash and van Santen."
[92] "In another theoretical study using a DFT cluster modeling approach, Pidko and van Santen compared the activation energy of CH with three types of Zn species at active sites: OZn2+O, OZn+OZn+O and HOZn+ O."
[93] "The authors suggest that the reaction proceeds most easily on OZn2+O, and hypothesize that the enhanced Lewis activity of OZn2+O facilitates CH heterolytic cleavage."
[94] "They further argue that the first proton abstraction occurs preferentially on the oxygen sites neighboring the ring where the cation is located."
[95] "They proposed a one-step reaction to yield H2 and C2H4 from the decomposition of the Zn-alkyl and proton."
[96] "A proposed mechanism of CH activation on OGa+ has similarly been suggested using theoretical calculations."
[97] "High alkene selectivities are obtained on the H-ZSM-5 when exchangeable protons are rigorously replaced by Zn and Ga."
[98] "The Zn-exchanged H-ZSM-5 had higher ethane conversion rates but lower ethene selectivity than its Ga counterpart."
[99] "The CH activation on the OZn2+O site can be described by a Lewis base-assisted deprotonation mechanism."
[100] "This is accompanied by conversion of the Lewis base site to a conjugate Bronsted acid site."
[101] "The OGa+ site, however, activates the CH bond via oxidative addition without a protonic site intermediate."
[102] "A protonic site intermediate increases tendency of side reactions on the Zn-exchanged H-ZSM-5 relative to the Ga counterpart."
[103] "The elementary steps of CH activation on OGa+ (Scheme 2) reveal that a redox cycle at the metal center is required for catalytic CH activation via the oxidative addition mechanism."
[104] "A redox cycle is not apparent in the elementary step presented for CH activation on OZn2+O."
[105] "Hence, a redox cycle is not a requisite for CH activation via the Lewis base-assisted deprotonation mechanism."
[106] "However, under alkane dehydrogenation reaction conditions, the OZn2+O sites can undergo a reversible Zn2 +/Zn redox process."
[107] "This redox process increases the availability of undesired protonic site intermediates."
[108] "Zn-exchanged H-ZSM-5 prepared by conventional ion-exchange methods contain a significant percentage of unexchanged proton sites leading to lower alkene selectivity of the catalyst."
[109] "Iglesia and Biscardi titrate the proton sites with NaOH."
[110] "The un-titrated and the titrated catalysts are denoted as Zn/H-ZSMS-5 and Zn/Na-ZSMS-5, respectively."
[111] "Zn/Na-ZSM-5 has four times the propane conversion rate and a higher propene selectivity than Zn/H-ZSMS-5."
[112] "The propene formation rate obtained with Zn/Na-ZSM-5 was ten times that of Zn/H-ZSMS-5."
[113] "The zinc species at the cation exchange site of the zeolite was identified as OZn+OH."
[114] "The higher propene selectivity obtained on Zn/Na-ZSM-5 compared to Zn/H-ZSMS-5 is presumably from the lower density and availability of proton sites on Zn/Na-ZSM-5."
[115] "The improved propane conversion rate of Zn/Na-ZSM-5 compared to Zn/H-ZSM-5 is attributable to the higher efficiency of OZn+OH sites in catalyzing desorption of H-adatoms than OZn2+O sites."
[116] "Another strategy to enhance alkene selectivity is by controlling the strength of the proton sites."
[117] "The acidity of the sites depends on the nature of the trivalent cation of the zeolite framework."
[118] "Proton sites in borosilicate zeolites are weaker than those of aluminosilicate, and thus higher alkene selectivity is expected for alkane dehydrogenation over Zn/H[B]-ZSM-5 compared to Zn/H[Al]-ZSM-5."
[119] "However, Zn/H[B]-ZSM-5 shows no activity for propane dehydrogenation."
[120] "The desired weaker acidity of the proton sites of Zn/H[B]-ZSM-5 requires weaker basicity of the oxygen atoms in the zeolite framework."
[121] "This reduced basicity of the oxygen atoms is not sufficiently polarizing to complement the exchanged Zn2 + in CH bond cleavage."
[122] "In the next section, we examine use of zeolite support to design a Pt-based alkane dehydrogenation catalyst."
[123] "Elimination of the proton sites of zeolites is critical for obtaining a high alkene selectivity and stability in dehydrogenation catalysts."
[124] "Pt is the most versatile noble metal catalyst for alkane reactions."
[125] "Although Pt is expensive, the choice of Pt is often justified by its higher activity, stability and selectivity for these reactions compared to less expensive alternative transition metals."
[126] "However, rapid catalyst deactivation due to coke formation remains a challenge even when using a Pt-based catalyst for dehydrogenation of light alkanes."
[127] "Waku et al."
[128] "exploited the unique property of zeolite as a support for achieving high metal dispersion through cation exchange sites to create a Pt/Na[Fe]-ZSM-5 catalyst with outstanding stability for dehydrogenation of light alkanes."
[129] "They found that the catalyst deactivation rate of Pt/Na[Fe]-ZSM-5 was lower than for any other Pt-based catalysts in refractory oxide support."
[130] "The unprecedented performance of Pt/Na[Fe]-ZSM-5 was attributed to its high Pt dispersion (cluster size < 1 mm) on zeolite through ion-exchange."
[131] "There is a tendency to generate some Brnsted protons on the zeolite during the exchange process, but the choice of Fe3 + as an isomorphous cation in place of Al3 + led to weaker Brnsted sites in [Fe]-ZSM compared to [Al]-ZSM."
[132] "The weaker acidity minimizes the tendency of side reactions (cracking of oligomerization, aromatisation, and coke), which translates into higher alkene selectivity and catalyst stability."
[133] "In another report, Xuebing and Iglesia demonstrated the ability of Pt/Na[Fe]-ZSM-5 to dehydrogenate alkanes longer than C4; n-pentane and n-heptane were selectively converted to n-pentene and n-heptene, respectively."
[134] "Alkene selectivity was also improved when the residual proton generated during Pt exchange or Na-[Fe]-ZSM was titrated with Cs."
[135] "Although Pt with conventional refractory oxides (Al2O3, SiO2, ZrO2, etc.) used for dehydrogenation of alkanes has similar conversion rates to Pt/Na[Fe]-ZSM-5, deactivation rates are also rapid due to coke formation."
[136] "The presence of acid (Bronsted and Lewis) sites on the supports promotes readsorption, oligomerization and aromatisation of alkenes."
[137] "Promotion of Pt with metals, such as Sn, Ga, Zn, Re, etc., improves catalyst stability, but also leads to faster deactivation rates than Pt/Na[Fe]-ZSM-5."
[138] "However, recent reports by Bell et al."
[139] "show that the use of calcined hydrotalcite (Al/Mg  0.1) supported on bimetallic PtGa or PtSn gave very high alkene selectivity and stability, comparable to Pt/Na[Fe]-ZSM-5."
[140] "At this stage, we can conclude that differences in the performance of Zn and Ga exchanged H-ZSM-5 obtained by Kanansky et al."
[141] "are attributable to their respective CH activation mechanisms."
[142] "In addition, the role of exchanged Zn and Ga as promoters of RD becomes evident from the mechanisms (Scheme 2)."
[143] "The RD mechanism on Ga exchanged H-ZSM-5 is by reductive elimination of a hydrogen molecule from O[Ga(H)2]+ intermediate."
[144] "Decomposition of ZnR and a protonic site, or neutralization of the proton sites by ZnH, leads to desorption of the hydrogen molecule on the Zn-exchanged H-ZSM-5."
[145] "By extrapolation, the mechanisms of CH activation on exchanged Zn and Ga H-ZSM-5 can described the mechanism of alkane dehydrogenation on Cr-based and Pt-based catalysts respectively."
[146] "The electronic promotion effect of Sn is in line with the oxidative addition CH activation mechanism."
[147] "However, the Lewis base-assisted deprotonation mechanism could also explain the proposed CH activation on Cr-based catalysts."
[148] "Now, the nature and the role of surface oxygen species become more evident."
[149] "The role of potassium in commercial Cr and Pt-based dehydrogenation catalysts is to minimize the undesired influence of protonic sites on alkene selectivity."
[150] "The highlights in this section are presented in Table 2."
[151] "The table reveals the insights achieved on the reaction mechanism, alkene selectivity and catalyst stability for non-oxidative dehydrogenation of lower alkanes."
[152] "Nonetheless, the level of catalyst activity is still far from acceptable, even at high temperature."
[153] "A recent report by Rothenberg et al."
[154] "provides a lead in this respect."
[155] "Their report indicates that a porous copperaluminum framework material (stabilized by metal oxide) has better performance (activity/selectivity/stability) for propane dehydrogenation than a PtSn/Al2O3."
[156] "Of particular interest, is the suggestion that achieving propane dehydrogenation at 350 C may be possible."
[157] "Few details are known about the structure of the porous copperaluminum framework material."
[158] "However, copper is implicated as providing the active sites for the catalysis."
[159] "Also, that the material activated in oxygen gave higher propane conversion rates than those activated in inert gas atmosphere underscores the role of the surface oxide (oxygen species) in the catalysis."
[160] "Thus, the Lewis base-assisted deprotonation mechanism may be invoked here, and the redox property of the metal center is likely to play a role in achieving propane dehydrogenation at 350 C."
[161] "This should constitute the future research direction for non-oxidative dehydrogenation of lower alkanes."

1. Recent strategies to enhance the catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes include the use of zeolites as supports to achieve high metal dispersion through cation exchange sites. This approach has been demonstrated with the creation of a Pt/Na[Fe]-ZSM-5 catalyst that exhibits outstanding stability for dehydrogenation of light alkanes. The catalyst's high Pt dispersion (cluster size < 1 mm) on zeolite through ion-exchange and the choice of Fe3+ as an isomorphous cation in place of Al3+ led to weaker Brnsted sites in [Fe]-ZSM compared to [Al]-ZSM, minimizing the tendency of side reactions and resulting in higher alkene selectivity and catalyst stability. Insights into the CH activation mechanisms on different catalysts have also been gained, which can guide the rational design of improved catalysts for C2 and C3 alkane dehydrogenation at lower temperatures.

1. 最近的策略包括使用沸石作为载体，通过阳离子交换位点实现高金属分散度，以增强直接脱氢过程中支撑金属催化剂的催化稳定性。这一方法已在创建Pt/Na[Fe]-ZSM-5催化剂中得到证明，该催化剂对轻烷烃脱氢表现出优异的稳定性。催化剂在沸石上通过离子交换具有高Pt分散度（簇尺寸<1 mm），并且选择Fe3+作为异形阳离子代替Al3+，导致[Fe]-ZSM中的Brnsted位点比[Al]-ZSM弱，从而减少了副反应的倾向，结果是更高的烯烃选择性和催化剂稳定性。对不同催化剂上的CH活化机制的见解也有所增加，这可以指导C2和C3烷烃在较低温度下脱氢的改进催化剂的合理设计。
