1.Recent strategies to enhance the catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes include oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH), which has the potential to lower the energy requirement for achieving dehydrogenation. ODH can be considered as tandem endothermic (dehydrogenation) and exothermic (oxidation) processes, with an overall thermodynamic summation. Although the process is not thermo-neutral, part of the energy required for the endothermic reaction is augmented by the exothermic reaction. Thus, ODH of alkanes takes place at lower temperature compared to the corresponding non-ODH. This lower temperature requirement of ODH compared to non-ODH and cracking is encouraging and provides motivation for continued efforts to develop ODH into an industrial technology. However, commercial ODH technologies hinge on innovative catalyst and process design, i.e. proper synergy of the endothermic dehydrogenation step with the exothermic hydrogen combustion and design of selective CH and hydrogen combustion catalysts. In this report, we provide an overview on CH activation and reaction routes to alkane dehydrogenation. We seek to gain insights about components of the active sites of CH activation to provide a platform for rational design of new efficient catalysts for dehydrogenation of lower alkanes. We focus on propane dehydrogenation because of the need for alternative and/or complementary technology for propene production to supplement existing technologies. We survey non-oxidative and oxidative dehydrogenation approaches, and examine reaction routes that are intermediate between these two main approaches.

1.最近，为了提高直接脱氢过程中支撑金属催化剂的催化稳定性，人们采取了氧化脱氢(ODH)等策略，这种策略有可能降低实现脱氢所需的能量。ODH可以被认为是串联的吸热(脱氢)和放热(氧化)过程，具有总体热力学总和。虽然该过程不是热中性的，但吸热反应所需的能量部分由放热反应补充。因此，与相应的非ODH相比，烷烃的ODH在较低的温度下进行。与非ODH和裂解相比，ODH较低的温度要求令人鼓舞，并为继续努力将ODH发展为工业技术提供了动力。然而，商业ODH技术取决于创新的催化剂和工艺设计，即吸热脱氢步骤与放热氢燃烧的适当协同作用，以及选择性CH和氢燃烧催化剂的设计。在本报告中，我们提供了关于CH活化和烷烃脱氢反应途径的概述。我们试图了解CH活化活性位点的组成部分，为设计新的高效催化剂提供平台，用于脱氢较低的烷烃。我们专注于丙烷脱氢，因为需要替代和/或补充技术来生产丙烯，以补充现有技术。我们调查了非氧化和氧化脱氢方法，并检查了介于这两种主要方法之间的反应途径。
