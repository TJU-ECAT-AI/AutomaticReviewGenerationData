I'm going to give you a scientific literature. Then I'm going to ask you some questions about it. I'd like you to first write down exact quotes of parts of the document word by word that would help answer the question, and then I'd like you to answer the question using facts from the quoted content. Do not omit any relevant information from the text, and avoid introducing any falsehoods or assumptions that aren't directly supported by the literature. Here is the literature, in <literature></literature> XML tags:

Adsorption of ethene on Pt(1 1 1) and ordered PtxSn/Pt(1 1 1) surface alloys: A comparative HREELS and DFT investigation Abstract The adsorption of ethene (C2H4) on Pt(1 1 1) and the Pt3Sn/Pt(1 1 1) and Pt2Sn/Pt(1 1 1) surface alloys has been investigated experimentally by high-resolution electron energy loss spectroscopy and temperature programmed desorption. The experimental results have been compared with density functional theory (DFT) calculations allowing us to perform a complete assignment of all vibration modes and loss features to the species present on the surfaces. On Pt(1 1 1) as well as on the PtSn surface alloys an η2 di-σ-bonded conformation of ethene has been found to be the most stable adsorbed form. In addition to this majority species a minor amount of π-bonded ethene has been identified, which is more abundant on the Pt2Sn surface alloy than on the other surfaces. Additionally the HREELS spectra of ethene on Pt(1 1 1) and the PtSn surface alloys differ only slightly in terms of the energetic positions of the loss peaks.

First, you need to sequentially extract any quotes in the literature that are most relevant to each question, and print them in numbered order, separated by newlines. Quotes should be relatively brief. Do not attempt to summarize or answer questions at this stage, but simply repeat exactly what the corresponding part of the literature says.

Please enclose the full list of quotes in <quotes></quotes> XML tags. If there are no relevant quotes, write "No relevant quotes" instead.

Then, answer the question, starting with "Answer:".  Do not include or reference quoted content verbatim in the answer. Don't say "According to Quote [1]" when answering. Do not write reference number of quotes after answer. Put your answer to the user inside <EnglishVersionAnswer></EnglishVersionAnswer> XML tags. Output formatted text, with line breaks for each question.Separate quotes and answers with a blank line. Provide the answers to all questions in English. After completing the English answers, translate all those answers into Chinese and provide the Chinese version inside <ChineseVersionAnswer></ChineseVersionAnswer> XML tags.

Thus, the format of your overall response should look like what's shown between the <example></example> tags.  Make sure to follow the formatting and spacing exactly.
