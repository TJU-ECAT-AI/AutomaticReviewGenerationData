1. Introduction
Light olefins, namely, ethylene, propylene and butylene are important chemical building blocks for the mass manufacture of a variety of high-value chemicals and intermediates such as polymers and oxygenates. The commercial processes for production of ethylene and propylene rely on steam cracking (SC) and fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) of naphtha and heavy oil. To satisfy the significantly growing global demands for olefins, the catalytically selective direct dehydrogenation (DH) of alkanes can serve as an effective supplement in view of the large-scale exploitation of shale gas. In comparison with the pathways of methanol-to-olefins (MTO), FischerTropsch to olefins (FTO), and alkane oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) using O2, CO2 and N2O as oxidants, exclusive selectivity to olefins is a unique property of the DH processes.
Non-oxidative ethane dehydrogenation (EDH) and propane dehydrogenation (PDH) are thermodynamically limited reactions with highly endothermic properties, as shown below: Considering the high chemical stability of the CH bonds in these two molecules, the direct dehydrogenation reactions require a high temperature to gain a satisfactory yield of olefins. A temperature range of 550 to 700 C results in reaching the equilibrium conversions of the atmospheric EDH reaction from ca. 10% to 40%, while the equilibrium conversion at 600 C corresponds to ca. 50% for the atmospheric PDH reaction. Unlike olefin molecules possessing an unsaturated CC bond, ethane and propane consisting only of CC and CH bonds are more difficult to adsorb on the catalyst surface and to be activated. Though the geometric effect favors the activation of the CH bond rather than the CC bond for the two alkanes, the catalytic selectivity control of the CH cleavage than the CC cleavage still cannot be ignored in view of their average binding energies, which are 347 and 414 kJ mol1 for their CC and CH bonds, respectively. Therefore, efficient and selective activation of the CH bond with suppression of the CC cleavage is the most important factor for determining the performances of the EDH and PDH catalysts.
The binding energies of the weakest CH bonds are 444 and 361 kJ mol1 for ethylene and propylene, respectively. Only one CC double bond exists in ethylene with a binding energy of 720 kJ mol1, whereas the CC single bond is the weakest with a binding energy of 414 kJ mol1 for propylene. Furthermore, in addition to being readily desorbed as the target products, the olefins can also serve as the intermediates to be involved in further transformation reactions for coke formation or low-carbon by-products, owing to stronger adsorption of olefins relative to alkanes. Taking such differences in the adsorption-desorption properties into account, the utilization of appropriate catalysts is necessary to achieve high selectivity toward olefins for both DH reactions, especially for the PDH reaction, considering a lower stability of propylene relative to ethylene.
EDH and PDH reactions run at high reaction temperatures under reductive atmospheres, e.g., co-fed alkane and hydrogen, resulting in the structural change of active metal or metal oxide species through sintering, reconstruction, and/or reduction. Furthermore, the high reaction temperatures and harsh conditions cause the deposition of coke species on the catalyst. Either the structural evolution of catalytic active sites or the severe coke poisoning leads to irreversible deactivation of the DH catalysts. To maintain an acceptable service lifetime, the removal of the coke from the used catalyst is required by performing frequent regeneration that is undesired for the industrial production.
In the case of the PDH process, two primary commercial technologies of the Oleflex process using PtSn/Al2O3-based catalysts and the Catofin process using CrOx/Al2O3-based catalysts have been developed in the last few decades. Several heterogeneous catalysts based on transition metals, metal oxides and carbon materials have also attracted wide attention for the PDH reactions in recent years. For these DH catalysts, however, the above-mentioned multiple issues may still exist directly affecting the catalytic performances, including the selective activation of the CH bonds over the CC bonds, the desorption of olefins, the catalyst structure stability, and the anti-coking ability.
Previous excellent reviews have broadly elaborated the activation of light alkanes as well as the DH or ODH reactions of ethane-to-ethylene and propane-to-propylene. Bhasin et al. reviewed the DH and ODH reactions of paraffins to olefins in 2001.1 Sun and Basset et al. introduced the ODH reactions of ethane and propane in their review of the catalytic oxidation of C1C4 light alkanes over heteropoly compounds in 2011, while Hermans et al. outlined the metal oxide-catalyzed ODH reactions of ethane and propane in 2017.2,3 Lercher et al. reviewed the ethane ODH processes with respect to the catalytic mechanisms and catalyst materials as well as the reactor concepts.4 Carrero et al. addressed the propane ODH reactions over supported VOx-based catalysts in 2014, while Lu et al. clearly explained the catalytic origin of BN-catalyzed ODH reactions of light alkanes in 2018.5,6 Chen et al. described the ODH of light alkanes over heterogeneous catalysts in the presence of CO2 as a mild oxidant.7 Weckhuysen et al. systematically reviewed the catalytic DH processes of light alkanes over metals and metal oxides in 2014.8 Recently, Yuan et al. comparatively discussed the state-of-the-art catalysts for the PDH reactions mainly focusing on the Pt-, Cr-, V-, Ga- and carbon-based catalysts.9 In this review, the novel catalysts mainly reported within the last five years are outlined for EDH and PDH reactions, considering that several newly developed synthesis strategies and in situ characterization techniques have been adopted to provide insights at the atomic and molecular levels. The screened catalysts are classified into Pt-based catalysts, CrOx, VOx and GaOx-based catalysts with multiple active sites, ZnOx-, Co/CoOx-, Fe/FeOx- and SnOx-based catalysts with relatively single active sites, ZrOx-based catalysts with coordinatively unsaturated Zr ions as the active sites, and other metals or metal oxides catalysts such as PdCu, Ni, and TiO2. The relationships between the structure and properties of these catalysts in key processes, including CH and CC activation, adsorption-desorption, and coking, are also discussed for facing the challenges existing in the alkane DH processes.
2. Screening of EDH and PDH catalysts
2.1. Pt-Based catalysts
One of the commercial PDH manufacturing processes, the UOP C3 Oleflex process, employs the Al2O3-supported Pt catalysts. As the most commonly used PDH catalysts so far, the Pt-based catalysts show several advantages in comparison with CrOx-based catalysts or others, for instance, higher reaction rate, higher stability for longer working periods before regeneration, and better environmental-friendliness. However, they are still subject to the deactivation issues that are caused by the metal sintering and coke poisoning during the reaction under harsh conditions and at high temperatures. The oxidative regeneration for the coke removal may also lead to the irreversible structural change of active metal sites. Therefore, toward the Pt-catalyzed PDH process, numerous efforts have been made to develop efficient and stable catalysts based on extending the knowledge of the structureperformance relationship and the catalytic mechanism. In this section, the Pt-based catalysts will be reviewed with respect to the size effect of Pt particles, cluster- and single-sites, the promotion effect of bimetals, and the effect of the selected supports including metal oxides, zeolites, and metal-free materials.
2.1.1. Size effect and single-atom catalysts It has been reported that the Pt-catalyzed PDH reaction is highly structure-sensitive, and both the selective activation of propane CH bond to form propylene and the cleavage of CC bond to yield C1C2 products as well as the coking step are significantly influenced by the size and the exposed facet of Pt. For instance, the mesoporous SBA-15-supported 3 nm Pt nanoparticles display higher propane conversion and coke amount but lower propylene selectivity than the supported 21 nm particles.10 For the PDH reaction catalyzed by the 39 nm Pt clusters supported on the calcinated layered double hydroxides (LDHs), the propane conversion decreases but the propylene selectivity increases with increasing Pt size (Fig. 1a).11 The kinetic analyses demonstrate that the reaction order of propane is 1 for all ranges of catalysts, whereas that of hydrogen is different, which varies from 0.07 to 0.57 for 39 nm Pt clusters (Fig. 1b and c). A greater kinetic isotope effect exists in the 9 nm Pt clusters than 3 nm clusters by switching C3H8 to C3D8 in the PDH reaction, suggesting a change in the reaction rate for the CH activation between these two catalysts. The smaller and larger clusters are dominated by the (211) and (111) planes of Pt, respectively. According to the DFT calculation results, the Pt(211) sites display a lower dehydrogenation energy barrier, while the Pt(111) sites exhibit a weakened binding strength of propylene and an increased energy barrier for the deep dehydrogenation of propylene. Furthermore, the rate-limiting steps on the Pt(211) and Pt(111) sites are identified as the first CH bond activation and the second CH bond activation, respectively. These results are in accordance with the experimental observations that higher activity favors the small Pt clusters while higher selectivity and stability favor the larger clusters.

The synthesis parameters influence the metal particle size for the as-obtained Pt-based catalysts. For instance, a controlled pH value in the co-precipitation synthesis can produce a small size of Pt particles with a high dispersion degree, and the optimal pH is 8 for the PtIn/Mg(Al)O catalyst that possesses 1.8 nm particle size with 41.6% Pt dispersion.12 For the PtIn/Mg(Al)O-p8 catalyst, the periclase MgO with a high surface area and less strong acidic sites and the In0 species provide strong interactions with the metallic Pt sites. The atomic layer deposition (ALD)-based synthesis approach can also be applied to tailor the size and phase of bimetallic nanoparticles. The Pt/In2O3 bilayer by ALD preparation can be transformed into PtIn alloy nanoparticles through atomic migration and coalescence via a reductive treatment, and the size and phase of the bilayers can be precisely tuned by the deposition thickness and Pt/In ratio.13 The ALD-synthesized bimetallic Pt3In/SiO2 catalyst displays 100% propylene selectivity and 3 s1 TOF in the PDH reaction at 600 C.
The atomically precise single-atom (SA) and single-atom alloy (SAA) catalysts have become one kind of the most active new frontiers in the heterogeneous catalysis.14,15 The SA catalysts consist of well-defined isolated active metal atoms, ions, or complexes on the supports, exhibiting distinct and great catalytic performance for various reactions. The SA and SAA catalysts are capable of activating the CH bonds of alkanes at low temperatures without coke formation.16,17 For instance, the SA Pt+ is in situ generated using 193 nm ultraviolet laser dissociation of the ligand-protected Pt clusters in a high-resolution mass spectrometer platform.18 The Pt+ site selectively promotes the dehydrogenation of ethane and propane to corresponding [Pt + olefin]+ and [Pt + alkyne]+ species, whereas it reacts with methane to produce [Pt + ethane]+ and [Pt + ethylene]+ species through a cross-coupling reaction of the PtCH2 intermediates.18 The PDH processes catalyzed by SA Pt on graphene and the modification effects of dopants are investigated with DFT calculations.19 By activating the first and second CH bonds of propane at the SA Pt sites on the pyridine N-doped support, a comparable energy barrier of propane activation at 0.37 eV is observed on this Pt/graphene model in comparison with other Pt catalysts.
Considering the harsh conditions for the metal-catalyzed alkane DH reactions, the thermal stability is a challenge for the SA and SAA catalysts at high temperatures. Although the SA Pt sites in the monometallic 0.02Pt/Al2O3-SA catalyst convert a small amount of propane molecules with a low reaction rate in the initial stage of the PDH reaction, the evolution from the SA structure to the large nanoparticles can be observed as the reaction proceeds under high-temperature reductive conditions.20 The addition of Sn species in the PtSn/CeO2 catalyst allows the SA Pt species to in situ transform into the small PtSn nanoclusters during the PDH reaction at 680 C.21 The coexistence of the Pt SA and the SnO2 particle on CeO2 support can be achieved by oxidative regeneration at 580 C, reflecting a completely reversible process of the self-assembly and redispersion for the Pt and Sn species (Fig. 2ac). An activation stage exists in the initial PDH reaction, which responds to the self-assembly process (Fig. 2d), and the formed PtSn3 cluster sites are thermally stable and catalytically selective, due to the facile desorption of propylene as the target product. The ingenious structural design and good control of the metal-support interaction for the SA or SAA catalysts is crucial to tune their catalytic dehydrogenation properties.

The Pt/Cu SAA catalyst, in which Pt atoms predominately monodisperse in the Cu surface layer, can achieve the activation of CH bonds in methyl groups at 80 C, 100 C lower than that on pure Cu surfaces.22 The Pt/Cu SAA-catalyzed CH activation process can prevent the formation of coke, which easily occurs at pure Pt surfaces, due to an intermediate CH activation energy barrier and the endothermic nature for the formation process of dehydrogenated fragments. In the case of a γ-Al2O3-supported Pt/Cu SAA catalyst with a high Cu/Pt ratio, the individual brighter Pt atoms disperse in Cu nanoparticles (Fig. 3a), showing 90% propylene selectivity and 10.6 mol gPt1 h1 formation rate as well as great long-term stability in >120 h PDH reaction at 520 C (Fig. 3b and c).23 The theoretical calculation results demonstrate that the Pt/Cu SAA species are different from the conventional alloy with respect to the free energy barriers in the first and second dehydrogenation as well as desorption steps (Fig. 3d and e). Both enhanced desorption of surface-bounded propylene and prohibited deep dehydrogenation side reaction are of benefit to the high selectivity of the Pt/Cu SAA catalyst. A thermally stable PtGa-Pb/SiO2 catalyst is developed as one of the effective SA catalysts for the PDH reaction.24 The threefold hollow Pt3 ensembles and the Pt SAs coexist in the catalyst, and the former can be selectively blocked and disabled by the atomic size Pb deposition, while the latter can be isolated using the inert Ga species. The SA Pt site selectively enables the activation of the first and second CH bonds, contributing to a propylene selectivity of as high as 99.6% and great stability in a 96 h PDH reaction at 600 C. For the PtFe intermetallic compound catalysts, the SAA PtFe3 and the ensembles of PtFe and Pt3Fe display a significant difference in the electronic property. The order of the average energy of the filled Pt 5d orbitals is PtFe3 > PtFe > Pt3Fe. The absence of PtPt bonds in the SAA catalyst contributes to the enhanced selectivity for propylene in the PDH reaction.25 The geometric and electronic modification of the second metal species as the promoters strongly affects the SAA-catalyzed alkane DH performances.

The selected support also influences the electronic and catalytic properties of the SAA catalysts. For instance, the SA Pt1 in Cr2O3(0001) surface donates electrons to both the adjacent O ions and the Cr ions located at two lattice sites away, whereas the SA Pt1 in the ZnO(100) surface transfers the electron to the adjacent O ions only.26 A dual-function of the SA Pt-doped Ga2O3 catalyst has been reported for the PDH reaction.27 By combining the DFT calculations and microkinetic analysis results, the PtO and GaO sites of Pt1Ga2O3(100) are believed to be responsible for the activated dehydrogenation of propane and the recombinative desorption of hydrogen, respectively. The specific interaction between SA Pt and Ga2O3 can prohibit the deep dehydrogenation and enhance the anti-reduction ability of Ga2O3 for increasing both the propylene selectivity and catalyst stability. The PDH reaction over SA Pt supported on BN nanosheets with B and N vacancies has been investigated by DFT calculations, and better propylene desorption and higher activity of propane CH activation are observed on the SA Pt on a N vacancy rather than on a B vacancy.28 Surface organometallic chemistry (SOMC) serves as an effective approach to construct the well-defined surface metal species by employing the single-site metal precursors.29,30 For instance, the hydrogenolysis of the Sn(n-C4H9)3 fragments grafted on Pt surfaces leads to the formation of PtSn bimetals with isolated Pt atoms.31 The grafting of the Pt precursor [Pt(OSi(OtBu)3)2(COD)] on the single-site GaIII-modified SiO2 produces the GaIIIPtII/SiO2 structure, and further reduction at 500 C leads to the formation of the Gaδ+Pt0/SiO2 catalyst that contains nanometric bimetallic GaxPt (0.5 < x < 0.9) alloys along with a fraction of GaIII single-sites.32 At 550 C and a WHSV as high as 98.3 h1, the Gaδ+Pt0/SiO2 catalyst displays over 99% propylene selectivity and a high productivity of 31.5 gC3H6 gcat1 h1, which are significantly higher than those of the monometallic Pt0/SiO2 and GaIII/SiO2 catalysts (0.24 and 0.16 gC3H6 gcat1 h1, respectively). The structural stability of the Gaδ+Pt0/SiO2 catalyst in a 20 h reaction is evidenced by the in situ XAS measurement results, and the deposition of coke may cause its slight deactivation. A subnanometric PtZn/SiO2 catalyst with 0.8 nm cluster size is prepared by a similar SOMC strategy (Fig. 4ac). It shows a high propylene productivity of 703375 gC3H6 gcat1 h1 and 95% selectivity in a 30 h PDH reaction at 550 C and 75 h1 WHSV, which benefits from the high dispersion of alloy metal and the anti-sintering function of the surface ZnII single-sites.33 The dispersion of the organoplatinum sites on the single-site ZnII-modified SiO2 ((MeCp)PtMex/Zn/SiO2) can be achieved by an ALD preparation process, and a further reduction at 550 C produces bimetallic PtZn/SiO2 catalyst for catalyzing the n-butane DH reaction (Fig. 4d).34 The Pt and Zn homogeneously disperse in the PtZn alloy nanoparticles with 1.2 nm average size. An increased electron density of surface Pt metal is observed due to the promotion effect of Zn species (Fig. 4e and f).Fig. 4 Schematic representation of the syntheses and corresponding Pt nanocluster size distribution for PtZn/SiO2 catalysts via (ac) SOMC approach and (df) ALD preparation.

2.1.2. Effect of promoter in bimetallic catalysts (1) Electronic and geometric modification In consideration of the unsatisfactory selectivity to olefin and the short catalyst life of the monometallic Pt catalysts for alkane dehydrogenation, it is vital to develop the bimetallic Pt-based catalysts by introducing a second promoter metal for improving the catalytic properties. The structure of the bimetals includes coreshell, heterostructure, alloy and inter-metallic phase, and the synergetic effects between the individual metals depend on the specific structures and metal kinds.
The multiple catalytic functions of Sn, the most commonly used promoter for Pt catalysts, can be divided into geometric and electronic modifications. In the case of the geometric modification effect, Sn species facilitate the dispersion of Pt species for reducing the availability to form ensembles, and even ideally isolate Pt to exist in the SA state as mentioned in the above section. With respect to the electronic modification, Sn species donate electrons to Pt for increasing the electron density of Pt and correspondingly modulating the binding strength of alkane and olefin as well as various intermediates. For the EDH reactions on the PtSn monolayers with 1/4 and 1/2 coverages on the Pt(111) surface, the potential energy surfaces for all C1 and C2 derivatives from ethane CH and CC bond cleavage suggest that the binding energies of all these species can be weakened in the presence of the Sn promoter.35 A purely electronic effect without changing binding geometries exists in the low-Sn-coverage surface model, whereas a geometric modification with a great change in energy barriers is observed on the high-Sn-coverage model. The degree of the strong metal-support interaction (SMSI) between Pt and Sn species is found to be continuously tuned by the thermal treatment parameters.36 The oxidatively treated PtSn/SiO2 catalyst exhibits a larger Pt particle size and a stronger PtSnO2 SMSI than those of the catalyst calcinated in an inert atmosphere. The reduction pretreatment in hydrogen leads to the formation of the highly dispersed surface Sn-enriched PtSn alloy nanoparticles with the strongest SMSI and the electron-rich Pt sites, acting as the most active catalyst for the alkane dehydrogenation.
In addition to Sn, the promotion effect of the group IB metals (i.e. Cu, Ag and Au) has also been reported for the Pt-based bimetal catalysts in alkane dehydrogenation.37 The bimetallic PtCu/MgAl2O4 catalyst displays higher propylene productivity and selectivity as well as a greater regeneration stability than the PtAg/MgAl2O4 and PtAu/MgAl2O4 catalysts.38 The Cu and Ag as the second metal can dilute the surface Pt atoms and donate an electron to Pt for increasing the electron density of Pt, while an inverse situation is observed on the PtAu bimetal. The introduction of Cu on the PtCu/Al2O3 catalyst also increases the catalytic PDH performances. The PtCu interaction not only inhibits the CC bond cleavage by an increased energy barrier, and also promotes the propylene desorption for preventing the formation of the coke precursors.39 For the EDH catalyzed by alloy models of Pt and post-transition metals (i.e. Pb, Bi, Sb, Ge, etc.), all these alloys decrease the binding energy of the carbonaceous species in comparison with the monometallic Pt.40 Furthermore, the modification effects on Pt depends on the coverage of these metals, which is similar to the situation of PtSn bimetal. The electronic effects dominate at low alloy coverage (1/4 ML), whereas the geometric effects play an important role in surface-adsorbate interactions at higher alloy coverage (1/2 ML). A Ge-promoted Pt0.5Ge1.5/Al2O3 alloy catalyst shows a superior stability and higher propylene selectivity (97.2% vs. 56.9%) than the monometallic Pt/Al2O3 catalyst for the PDH reaction.41 A geometric modification of Ge on the Pt site is observed through the isolation effect to break the Pt ensembles, while an electronic effect also confirms that Ge can withdraw an electron from Pt to enhance the activity of the CH bond cleavage and to suppress the CC bond cleavage.
With the aid of the ensemble effects of both geometric and electronic modifications through elimination of large Pt ensembles and electron transformation, the supported PtIn0.7 and PtIn1.4 bimetals on SiO2 exhibit 100% ethylene selectivity and 1.62.8 s1 initial specific reaction rate in the EDH reaction at 600 C, whereas the monometallic Pt/SiO2 catalyst displays 73% ethylene selectivity and a rate of 0.7 s1.42 The PtIn intermetallic alloy phase is related to the ratio of In to Pt. For instance, the Pt3In phase with a Cu3Au structure for PtIn0.7 alloy and a PtIn2 shell with a CaF2 structure around a core of Pt3In for the PtIn1.4 alloy. Based on the DFT calculation results, Pt3In bimetal may possess a comparable activity with Pt3Sn, achieving a balance between the propane conversion and propylene selectivity.43 The presence of In atoms contributes to the isolation of Pt atoms with increased electron density and the reduction of step Pt sites with low coordination. A colloidal synthesis method is used to prepare uniform PtIn bimetal nanoparticles, eliminating the phase segregation of large excesses of In oxide.44 The In-rich PtIn2 catalyst on SiO2 support exhibits the highest reaction rate for the EDH reaction at 600 C due to both the strong electronic perturbation to Pt sites and the geometric modification by In atoms. A greater thermal stability of the colloidal-synthesized PtIn2 catalyst against a stress test at 800 C is also achieved in comparison with the impregnated catalyst, which is attributed to the high phase uniformity that cannot lead to the reduction and vaporization of unalloyed In promoter atoms for deactivation.
The inhibiting effect on the CC cleavage and a six-fold increase of specific reaction rate are observed on the SiO2-supported Pt1Zn1 intermetallic alloys relative to the monometallic Pt for the EDH reaction at 600 C (Fig. 5a and b).45 The isolation of Pt sites and the modified electronic property can originate from the incorporation of Zn atoms into bimetals (Fig. 5c and d), decelerating the side reactions of hydrogenolysis and cracking and weakening the bond formation between the 5d orbitals of Pt and adsorbates. The PtMn alloyed nanoparticles on MnOx-decorated mesoporous SiO2 show high activity and stability in a 100 h long-term PDH reaction at 590 C due to the electron transfer from Mn to Pt, while the formation of the nanosized alloy structure is in situ achieved during the pre-activation process.46 The surface density of MnOx sites on SiO2 and their interaction with [PtCl6]2 precursor species are believed to be the key factors to determine the structures of the PtxMny alloys.

(2) Coreshell structure of bimetals The ordered alloy phase for a Pt-containing nanoparticle or nanocluster can ensure that all Pt atoms experience homogeneously geometric and electronic modification. However, the formation of a surface alloy layer may be necessary to achieve the isolation and modification of Pt sites, reaching a comparable catalytic performance to a fully alloyed structure for the DH reactions. A comparative study demonstrates that both coreshell Pt-Pt3V and full alloy Pt3V phases show similarly high propylene selectivity in the PDH reactions, and a Pt3V alloy shell with 23 atomic layer thickness is sufficient for the electronic modification.47 Further investigations reveal that such electronic modification in Pt-V alloy is not caused by the electron transfer but rather a change in the energy of the unfilled and filled Pt 5d orbitals for tuning the binding geometry and strength of reaction-relevant adsorbates on the alloys.The effects of the subsurface atoms have also been observed on the core@shell Pt@PtM (M = Sn, Sb, Mn, Fe, Co, and Ni) nanoparticles for the PDH reactions. The SiO2-supported 23 nm Pt@Pt1Sn1 coreshell nanoparticles possess a highly ordered hexagonal Pt1Sn1 intermetallic shell on the Pt core, displaying a superior catalytic PDH performance than that of the monometallic Pt.48 The geometric modification of Sn in the shell reduces the Pt ensembles for a high propylene selectivity, while the electronic modification weakens the Pt-hydrocarbon chemisorption energies for increasing the reaction rate. In the SiO2-supported core@shell Pt@Pt1Sb1 nanoparticles, strong Pt-Sb bonds are formed and the Pt atoms are isolated by the Sb atoms for a change in the energy levels of the Pt1Sb1 surface alloy shell.49 The SiO2-supported monometallic Pt, core@shell Pt@Pt3Mn, and full alloy Pt3Mn nanoparticles show similar sizes of 2.0 nm, and nonetheless, their propylene selectivity is in an increasing order, which is 32%, 82%, and 98%, respectively (Fig. 6).50 In comparison with the pure Pt surface, the L12-symmetry Pt3Mn intermetallic subsurface significantly enhances the selectivity of the CH activation rather than the CC cleavage in the PDH reaction through lowering the adsorption heats of hydrocarbon and hydrogen on the surfaces. For the bimetallic Pt catalysts modified by 3d transition metals at the surface and subsurface, the selectivity for the PDH reactions decreases in the sequence of Pt  PtFe > PtCo > PtNi considering that the exposed Ni and Co sites prefer to easily break the CC bonds of propane (Fig. 7a and b).51 However, when the surface transition metals on the nanoparticles are completely removed to form the Pt-skin catalyst on the bimetallic subsurface, the selectivity switches to an order of Pt < PtNi@Pt < PtCo@Pt < PtFe@Pt. Such increasing selectivity is well consistent with the downshifting trend of the d-band center in these coreshell bimetallic systems, reflecting the electronic modification effect of the subsurface atoms (Fig. 7c).Fig. 6 Schematic view of the structures of Pt, intermetallic and core@shell Pt3Mn bimetals and their propylene selectivity in the PDH reactions.

Reprinted from ref. 51, copyright 2018, with permission from AAAS.The subsurface catalysis has also been investigated by DFT calculations with respect to the propylene selectivity and coke formation in the PDH reactions catalyzed by 11 kinds of the Pt-based core@shell alloys, M@Pt (M = Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Ru, Rh, Pd, Ag, Os, Ir, and Au).52 Their electronic structures of metal surface modified by the strain effect and electron transfer effect are established to connect with their adsorption energies of propylene as the descriptors for the PDH reaction kinetics. All these core@shell catalysts show less negative propylene adsorption energies and higher activation energies than the pure Pt catalyst, resulting in lower PDH activity but higher selectivity to propylene.
2.1.3. Catalysts on Al2O3-based supports Al2O3, as the mostly used support for metal-based DH catalysts, possesses several advantages, including high thermal stability and mechanical strength, easily tuned porosity and acidity, and low cost. Unlike the weakly interacting SiO2 support that causes irreversible sintering of the metallic sites and deactivation of the catalyst during the oxidative regeneration stage after the PDH reaction, the Al2O3 support can provide a stronger interaction with the metal sites.53 For Al2O3 supports, their phase, morphology, surface acidity property, coordination of Al ions, etc., can determine the interaction with not only the metallic sites but also the reaction-relevant molecules or intermediates.54Table 1 summarizes the recent advances on Pt-based DH catalysts on Al2O3-relevant supports.

From the characterizations and catalytic PDH reaction results, the Pt/θ-Al2O3 catalyst displays higher propylene selectivity and minor coke deposition with higher H/C ratio and graphitization degree in comparison with the Pt/γ-Al2O3 catalyst, reflecting that less severe deep dehydrogenation side reactions occur over the Pt/θ-Al2O3 catalyst with specific pore structure and weaker acidity.55 Furthermore, the existence of abundant chlorine species on these two catalysts after treatment with HCl vapor prevents the Pt particles from sintering and reduces the coke deposition. The effect of the elimination of residual chlorine species from chlorinated platinum precursor has also been investigated on the γ-Al2O3-supported PtSnK catalyst for the PDH reaction.56 For the high-sphericity Al2O3 spheres that are prepared by a modified oil-drop solgel method, the aging temperature determines the pore size and volume as well as the surface acidity.57 The interactions between PtSn species and Al2O3 support aged at different temperatures are distinct. With increasing aging temperature, both the dispersion of Pt and total acid content show volcano-shape patterns, while the interaction between Al2O3 and Sn species is enhanced for inhibiting the reduction of SnOx to metallic Sn0. By proceeding with a facile complex-assisted hydrothermal approach using melamineAl(NO3)3 complex as Al precursor, template and precipitant, a carambola-like Al2O3 with an open structure can be prepared for acting as a proper carrier of PtSn clusters with an intensified interaction of bimetallic Pt and Sn.58 For the PDH reaction at 600 C, the catalyst displays 1.8 times higher TOF value with higher selectivity and stability in comparison with the commercial Al2O3-supported PtSn catalyst, which originate from the enhanced propane activation ability of electron-deficient Pt sites and the mass transfer facilitated by the unique morphology and surface properties. A high strength of Lewis acid sites in Al2O3 can prevent the sintering of PtSn sites by the SMSI effect, while the low amount of Lewis acid sites in Al2O3 can reduce the deposition of coke species during the PtSn/Al2O3-catalyzed PDH reaction.59 For a PtSnNa/Al2O3-based PDH catalyst prepared by a ball milling method, it is observed that the Sn species restrain the deep dehydrogenation pathway and transfer the coke from the Pt sites, while the Na+ species suppress the CC cracking processes.60 Furthermore, the γ-Al2O3 coated on the cordierite with a proper thickness can serve as a practical support for the PtSnNa-based monolithic catalyst, and its good mass transfer performance leads to a steady propylene selectivity in the PDH reaction.61 A γ-Al2O3 nanosheet containing 27% penta-coordinated Al3+ sites serves as a proper anchor to strongly stabilize the raft-like PtSn clusters for enhancing the anti-sintering ability.62,63 The PtSn/Al2O3 nanosheet catalyst displays a high initial conversion of 48.7% and a very small decrease in conversion of 0.17% per hour in a 24 h PDH reaction at 590 C and a WHSV of 9.4 h1, whereas the PtSn/Al2O3 reference catalyst shows a dramatically declined activity from 43.8% to 28.3% within 24 h (Fig. 8a).64 The electronic interaction between Pt and Sn in the PtSn/Al2O3 sheet catalyst is relatively strong, while the electron density and dispersion of Pt sites are increased (Fig. 8b). The sufficient amount of the penta-coordinated Al3+ in Al2O3 is evidenced by the two-dimensional 27Al MQ MAS NMR spectrum (Fig. 8c). The catalyst exhibits a weak interaction with the electron-rich propylene, and thus minimizes the formation of coke species. The presence of the penta-coordinated Al3+ in Al2O3 also contributes to the high dispersion of Pt and Ga species on the support.63 Both the hydrogen spillover and the synergistic function between Pt and reduced Ga2O3 sites are facilitated, consequently promoting the catalytic activity and stability of Pt/Ga/Al2O3 catalyst in the PDH reaction.

Modification by doping has been approved as an effective strategy to improve the catalytic DH performances of the Pt/Al2O3-based catalysts, and the dopants include transition metals or rare earth metals (e.g., Ce, Zr, Y, Mg, etc.) and nonmetals (e.g., carbon and boron species). For instance, the addition of an optimal content of carbon into Al2O3 has been reported to improve the activity and stability of the supported PtSnK catalyst in the PDH reaction due to large specific surface area, weak and moderate acidity and strong resistance to coke.65 The promotion effect of Pt/γ-Al2O3 catalysts with the boron species on reducing the coke deposition and enhancing the propylene selectivity is observed in the PDH reaction.66 The boron promoter exists in an amorphous oxide that finely disperses on both the Al2O3 support and the Pt surface rather than in the reduced state or PtB alloy, removing the medium- and strong-strength acid sites from the Al2O3 support to inhibit the oligomerization of the produced propylene to the coke precursors.
In the case of a PtGa/CeAl2O3 catalyst, the atomic dispersion of Ce on γ-Al2O3via the solgel synthesis chemistry contributes to the stabilization effect of Pt through strong PtOCe bonds (Fig. 9a). In comparison with the impregnated catalyst with a weak interaction between metal and support, the chemically stabilized catalyst shows a more steady activity and a higher selectivity as well as a good regeneration stability for the PDH reaction (Fig. 9b).67 When Ga3+ cations are incorporated into the cubic fluorite CeO2 on Al2O3, the reducibility of CeO2 can be enhanced to promote the desorption of propylene and the elimination of the deposited coke in the PtGa/CeO2Al2O3-catalyzed PDH reaction.68 The addition of a proper amount of Ga species can also decorate and modify the Pt sites via the formation of PtGa alloys. The Y-modified γ-Al2O3 can greatly reduce the acidity of the support and change the interaction with active PtSnIn sites for the PtSnIn/0.6γ-Al2O3 catalyst, while the Zr-modified γ-Al2O3 results in high Pt dispersion for the PtSnIn/0.8ZrAl2O3 catalyst.69,70 These two supported PtSnIn catalysts show above 50% conversion and >97% propylene selectivity in the PDH reactions. A hierarchical MgAl2O4 with flower-like morphology is used to support PtSn bimetals, achieving a high stability in ten cycles of PDH reaction and regeneration, due to the contribution of a great amount of MgAl2O4(111) facets exposed on the support.71 Fig. 9 (a) Schematic representation of catalyst preparation and (b and c) catalytic PDH performances of three kinds of PtGa/Al2O3 catalysts.

The Al-contained LDH-derived supports also exhibit good properties to enhance the Pt-catalyzed EDH and PDH performances.12,7274 Small raft-like Pt clusters highly disperse on the MgSn(Al)Ox support, and this Pt/MgSn(Al)O@Al2O3 catalyst displays >99% propylene selectivity and 0.96 s1 specific rate in the PDH reaction at 550 C, while >98% selectivity and 1.46 s1 rate can be achieved at 600 C (Fig. 10a and b).72 The confinement of SnIV/II ions in the Mg(Al)O lattices is confirmed by the 119Sn Mssbauer spectra (Fig. 10c), providing a strong interaction with the metal sites for great anti-sintering stability in the long-term reaction. For the PtSn/Mg(Ga)AlOx catalysts, the presence of a moderate amount of Ga in the MgAl LDH matrix significantly reduces the strong acid sites and enhances the interactions between Sn and the support and between Pt and Sn through inhibiting the reduction of SnOx species.73 The Zn additives not only modify the acidic property of the MgAl LDH matrix, but also induce the formation of small PtZn bimetallic nanoparticles on the support. By stabilizing Pt in the active state by Zn, the optimal PtZn/Mg(Zn)AlOx catalyst shows high activity and above 99% selectivity for propylene in the PDH reaction.74 Fig. 10 (a) Catalytic PDH performance of PtSn/Mg(Sn)(Al)O@Al2O3 catalyst.

Decorating functional layers on top of the Al2O3 surfaces is also an available approach to modify the structureproperty relationship of the Pt/Al2O3-based catalysts. The oxide-based nano islands decorated on the surface of the Al2O3 support can effectively modify the surface acidbase property and provide new anchor sites for the active metallic species through different interactions. The layered MgAl hydroxides supported on Al2O3 allow the chloroplatinate complex to exchange with their interlayer anions, resulting in the predominant localization of the dispersed Pt sites in the MgAl phase for better anti-coking stability of the Pt catalyst in the PDH reaction.75 A composite catalyst, MgAl-LDHs/Al2O3 fiber, also shows a good PDH performance due to the LDH sheet-promoted dispersion state of active Pt sites and open pore structure.76 The perovskite LaAlO3 nanoparticles can be anchored on γ-Al2O3 through sharing of the AlO bond, and their lattice interstitial sites are beneficial to confining the highly dispersed PtIn bimetallic species with an appropriate In3+/In0 ratio and a weak interaction between Pt and In species.77
2.1.4. Catalysts on zeolite-based supports Zeolites can be widely used as promising porous supports to encapsulate small nanoparticles, nanoclusters and even single-atoms of metals for heterogeneous dehydrogenation catalysis.78,79 To a certain extent, the zeolite provides a confinement effect to stabilize the metal sites against sintering at high operation temperatures or in various reaction atmospheres. The location and structure as well as the properties of the metals in the zeolite are dependent on the encapsulation synthesis method and the physicochemical properties of the selected zeolite. With respect to the former issue, for instance, it is difficult to control the metal states well by using conventional methods such as impregnation or ion exchange.80,81 The multidimensional parameters of the used zeolite support also determine its interactions with metal precursors during the preparation process to construct the metal-zeolite interfaces. Furthermore, the zeolite itself can interact with the reaction-relevant molecules or intermediates in the reaction for changing the pathway. In this section, the Pt-based alkane DH catalysts supported or confined in the mesoporous pure-silica zeolites (e.g., MCM-22 and SBA-15) and the microporous zeolites (e.g., ZSM-5 and beta) would be discussed in detail (Table 2).

The internal dimensions of the cup-like hemi-cages and the supercages of the MCM-22 zeolite are 0.7 and 0.7 × 1.8 nm, respectively. The supercages can theoretically contain the Pt nanoclusters with 1013 atoms. For the as-synthesized Pt@MCM-22 catalyst, most of the Pt species are single-atoms and <0.7 nm clusters captured by the hemi-cages and supercages, exhibiting high structural stability under both thermal and PDH reaction conditions. For the PDH reaction at 550 C, the Pt@MCM-22 catalyst displays a higher activity than that of the impregnated Pt/MCM-22 catalyst with 1.5 nm Pt nanoparticles at the external surfaces. After five reaction-regeneration cycles at 550 C, 10% and >40% losses relative to the initial activity are observed on the confined Pt@MCM-22 and the impregnated Pt/MCM-22 catalyst, respectively.

Mesoporous SBA-15 material is a commonly used support for PtSn-based PDH catalysts, and further modifications such as decorating and doping can improve the catalytic performances. The PtSn catalyst supported on Al2O3-modified SBA-15 (PtSn/Al2O3/SBA-15) shows a higher activity than that of the PtSn/SBA-15 catalyst and a higher stability than that of the PtSn/Al2O3 catalyst for the PDH reactions, due to the mesoporous structure and the enhanced interaction between PtSn and the additive Al2O3 species on the PtSn/Al2O3/SBA-15 catalyst.83 The interaction between Sn species and Al2O3/SBA-15 support can be tuned by the content of Al2O3 additives, and their weaker interaction leads to the formation of PtSn alloys for the increased stability of the PtSn/xAl-SBA-15 catalysts in the PDH reaction.84 The post-impregnation of oxides may cause the formation of large decorators, decreasing the surface area and blocking the mesopores of SBA-15. By performing one-pot hydrothermal synthesis, the Mg and Sn species can be incorporated into the framework of the SBA-15 support to maintain the porous texture and anchor the active Pt-based metals.85,86 The PtSn catalysts on the hydrothermal-synthesized Mg-SBA-15 show more uniform distribution of both Mg and PtSn species and higher specific surface area than the impregnated catalysts.85 In addition, the enhanced interaction between Sn and the support contributes to the stabilization of the oxidative SnOx sites and facilitates the transfer of the carbon deposits from the metal sites to the supports, therefore improving the stability and propylene selectivity in the PDH reactions. Specifically, the PtSn/2Mg-SBA-15 catalyst displays >98% propylene selectivity at 38.0% conversion at 580 C. Similarly, a strong Sn-support interaction is observed on the Pt catalyst on the Sn-SBA-15 support that is prepared by a hydrothermal method.86 At the optimal Sn loading, the Pt/0.5Sn-SBA-15 catalyst exhibits 98.5% propylene selectivity and 43.8% conversion in the PDH reaction at 580 C. The existence of promotors such as Ce, In, La and Fe onto the Pt catalysts supported on Sn-SBA-15 can enhance the propylene generation rate in the PDH reactions, which are related to their regulated redox properties, surface compositions, and lattice oxygen capabilities.87 Among these catalysts, the InPt/Sn-SBA-15 catalyst shows a maximum initial propane conversion, while the FePt/Sn-SBA-15 catalyst shows the best catalytic stability.
The structureactivity relationships have also been established for the subnanometric Pt sites confined in microporous zeolites, including MFI-type zeolites of ZSM-5, silicalite-1 and TS-1, beta zeolites, etc. Considering that these zeolites possess micropores and cavities at different dimensions, one of the fundamental challenges is to precisely and selectively localize the metal sites in the specific position of zeolites, and another one is to stabilize these metal species against Ostwald ripening or sintering at high reaction temperatures under a reductive atmosphere. The strong interaction between the silanol defect sites of hierarchical silicalite-1 zeolite and Pt metals introduces the formation of small Pt nanoparticles with approximately 2 nm size.88 More than 95% propylene selectivity with suppressed oligomerization side reaction is achieved on this promoter-free Pt/silicalite-1 nanosheet catalyst due to favorable diffusion in short paths. To achieve regioselective generation of subnanometric Pt nanoclusters within a pure-silica MFI zeolite, coexistence of the tetrapropylammonium hydroxide (TPA+OH) templates and K+ species is the key influencing factor (Fig. 12a).89 Most Pt atoms are dispersed in the sinusoidal 10MR channels of the MFI zeolite, not only due to the relatively larger space of the channels than the straight channels, but also owing to the occupation of the intersectional voids by the TPA+ templates. The introduction of a moderate amount of K+ to compensate the silanol groups does not affect the hydrothermal synthesis stage, and nonetheless, it significantly suppresses the sintering of Pt nanoclusters into large nanoparticles during the calcination process through a stabilization effect. With the aid of the electronic modification on the Pt sites provided by the atomically dispersed Sn species, the subnanometric K-PtSn@MFI catalyst displays a highly steady and active performance in the PDH reaction at 600 C (Fig. 12b). In the detailed extending work, the structural evolution of this confined catalyst during reduction with H2 is carefully measured, and the PDH performances of these pre-reduced catalysts are also evaluated for acquiring a more refined information of the metal-support interaction (Fig. 13).90 In the pristine K-PtSn@MFI sample after hydrothermal synthesis, Pt, K+ and Sn4+ species atomically dispersed in the sinusoidal channels of the MFI zeolite. During the reduction at 400 C, all Pt atoms but only a few Sn4+ species are reduced, while subnanometric Pt clusters are formed. If the reduction temperature reaches up to 600 C, most of the Sn4+ species are reduced to the Sn2+ species that are still separated with Pt clusters. After extending the reduction time from 1 h to 12 h at 600 C, the migration of partial Sn2+ species towards the Pt cluster occurs to form the bimetallic PtSn clusters that directly contact with the reduced Sn2+ species isolated on the internal wall of the zeolite channel probably through SnOPt bonds. For the K-PtSn@MFI catalysts after pre-reduction treatments at 600 C for different times of 0 to 22 h, their initial specific rates of propylene generation are similar, which are approximately 3.5 s1, while the coke amounts are all below 1 wt%. However, the deactivation constant dramatically decreases from 0.12 to 0.01 h1 with increasing reduction durations for these catalysts. The synergistic effect between the framework Zn species as Lewis acid sites and small-sized PtZn nanoparticles is also observed in the ZnPt/HZSM-5 catalyzed PDH reactions.91 The optimal 10Zn0.1Pt/H-ZSM-5 catalyst consisting of 1000 ppm Pt and 10 wt% Zn displays a high propylene yield of ca. 46% and a good stability over 65 h at 525 C without regeneration procedure or co-feeding of hydrogen. The unique geometric and electronic structure features of the subnanometric bimetallic clusters confined in the zeolites determine the outstanding catalytic alkane dehydrogenation performance.

The encapsulation of ultrasmall PtZn alloy nanoclusters by the nanosized MFI-structure silicalite-1 zeolites is achieved by a ligand-protected direct hydrogen reduction method, and the optimal PtZn4@S-1-H catalyst displays a high propylene generation rate of 65.6 molC3H6 gPt1 h1 and 99% selectivity in the PDH reaction with a WHSV of 108 h1 at 550 C.92 Even the confined monometallic Pt@S-1-H catalyst obtained by reduction shows a greater stability than the calcinated Pt@S-1-C catalyst and the impregnated Pt/S-1-im catalyst, highlighting the advantage of the encapsulation of metals in the zeolites. Furthermore, the promotion effect of the Cs+ additives on the regeneration stability of the catalysts has been observed. Without the addition of the protective agent, PtSn clusters with ca. 1 nm size can be in situ encapsulated inside the high-silica ZSM-5 zeolites through a rapid one-pot synthesis procedure.93 In comparison with the monometallic Pt/ZSM-5 and the impregnated Pt/Sn-ZSM-5-im, the ultrafast-encapsulated Pt/Sn-ZSM-5 catalyst exhibits a superior catalytic stability. Its propane conversion remains as high as 45% after 24 h in the PDH reaction at 600 C. The bimetallic PtCu alloy nanoparticle encapsulated in silicalite-1 shows a superior catalytic performance than the monometallic Pt catalyst in the PDH reaction at 610 C, which was an initial conversion of 46.0% and a propylene selectivity of 93.2%.94 In spite of a coking-preventing performance, gradual deactivation still occurs on this Cu0.6Pt0.1@S-1 catalyst, owing to the aggregation of active metal sites via the Ostwald ripening process under the harsh reaction conditions.
The surface framework defects of silanol nests on the pore walls of the mesoporous MFI-type degallated zeolites can induce the formation of intermetals of Pt and rare-earth element, e.g., PtLa, PtCe and PtY (Fig. 14).95 The presence of the silanol nests allows these rare-earth elements to exist as high-chemical potential single-atom species that prefer to diffuse onto Pt sites in comparison with the bulk oxide forms. The PtLa and PtY bimetallic alloys incorporated in the mesoporous zeolites show a striking enhancement in the catalytic activity, propylene selectivity and stability in 20 days of PDH reactions at 580 C. The presence of the framework-confined Sn species in the dealuminated Si-beta zeolites influences the chemical state and catalytic PDH property of the encapsulated Pt sites.96,97 The introduction of SnCl4 by dry impregnation leads to the formation of tetrahedral coordinated Sn4+ species incorporated into the beta zeolite frameworks.96 Due to strong interactions between Pt and Sn4+ sites, the subnanometric Pt clusters are highly dispersed, displaying >99% propylene selectivity and 2.3 molC3H6 gPt1 h1 generation rate in the PDH reaction at 550 C. The grafting of tributyltin hydride (Bu3SnH) onto the dealuminated beta zeolites produces the formation of the Sn single-site located in the frameworks.97 The grafting of Pt(COD)Me2 and following reductive treatment in H2 result in the homogeneous dispersion of PtSn alloy nanoclusters at the surface of Sn-beta zeolites. Benefiting from the isolation effect and electronic modification effect of Sn species on the Pt sites as well as the confinement effect of zeolites, the PtSn2.00/Sn-beta catalyst shows 114 s1 TOF and above 99% propylene selectivity in the PDH reaction at 570 C.

In view of the fact that the beta and ZSM-5 zeolites are extensively explored for aromatization processes of light hydrocarbons, the presence of the acidic sites may catalyze the transformation of olefins, the target products in the alkane dehydrogenation, into aromatics, for instance, a GaPt/HZSM-5 catalyst with coexistence of metal sites and Brnsted acid sites can tandemly achieve the dehydrogenation of ethane to ethylene and the aromatization of ethylene to benzene and toluene.98100 Therefore, the high-silica or pure-silica zeolites that possess low surface acidity are widely used as the supports to encapsulate the subnanometric Pt metals for the selective DH of alkanes to olefins. Considering the weaker acidity of the TS-1 zeolite relative to the Al-ZSM-5 zeolites that may inhibit side-reactions of CC cracking and coking, TS-1-supported PtSn catalysts are attempted in the PDH reactions.101 The PtSn catalyst in the minimal particle size TS-1 zeolites (100 nm) displays a superior catalytic PDH performance than the catalysts supported on the large-size TS-1 zeolites (0.25.7 μm), owing to the hierarchically porous structure for a promoted mass transportation.102 Furthermore, the surface acidity of the zeolite can also determine the location position and state of the Pt sites. The relatively stronger acid sites of SUZ-4 zeolites can prevent the impregnation of the H2PtCl6 precursors into the channels, and consequently most of the Pt particles disperse on the external surface of the SUZ-4 zeolite.103 In sharp contrast, relatively weaker acidic ZSM-5 zeolites allow most of the Pt species to enter the porous spaces with the coexistence of both small clusters and large particles. The doping modification of the M-silicalite-1 (M = Mg, Al, Fe and In) zeolites shows profound impacts on pore structure, reducibility, acidity and surface content of Pt for the supported bimetallic PtSn catalysts, and therefore changes the catalytic PDH performances.104
2.1.5. Catalysts on other supports The catalytic performances of Pt catalysts supported on other materials for the alkane DH reactions are presented in Table 3. For the Pt/SiO2 catalysts, the SMSI effect between Pt species and SiO2 matrix under high-temperature reduction conditions can modify the geometric and electronic properties of Pt sites.105 The PtSiO2 interaction increases with the reduction temperature, and an optimal SMSI effect leads to the formation of more electron-rich Pt sites and their high accessibility, which are responsible for the high initial activity and the high anti-sintering ability of the Pt/SiO2_1073 K catalyst in the PDH reaction. The Pt nanoparticles embedded in SiO2 supports with a self-assembly structure of nanotubes with vertically aligned nanorods also show a high thermal stability against the PDH reaction at 590 C.106

ZrO2 serves as a widely used support in catalytic reactions due to its high mechanical and thermal stability. It has been reported for the PDH reactions that either the location of the metals on ZrO2 or the doping modification with dopants such as La and Y introduces the formation of the coordinatively unsaturated Zr ions for changing the propylene chemisorption ability.107 By controlling the pH value during the preparation, the Lewis acidity and the oxygen storage capability of the boron-doped ZrO2 supports can be regulated. For the B-ZrO2-supported PtSn catalysts, a moderate metal-support interaction is achieved on the catalyst support that is prepared at pH = 10 for strengthening the interaction between Pt and Sn species and thus facilitating the catalytic PDH performance.108 A commercial TiO2-based material, ETS-2, possesses a high surface area and surface titanate species with a net negative charge, allowing it to serve as a potent ion-exchanger, resulting in the stabilization of the highly dispersed bimetallic PtZn sites by the ETS-2 support.109 By further changing the Zn/Pt ratio and by manipulating the space velocity of the feed gases, the side reactions and coking processes can be suppressed in the EDH reaction.
The nanocarbon-based materials are rarely reported to serve as the supports of Pt sites though they themselves are a group of important catalysts for the alkane DH reactions due to their metallic or semimetallic nature or the defect roles. A Pt/ND@G catalyst is developed for the PDH reaction, which consists of Pt nanoparticles and a coreshell structured nanocarbon support with a nanodiamond core and a defective ultrathin graphene nanoshell.110 An SMSI effect is observed through the electron transfer from the defects on the nanocarbon support to Pt sites, and consequently promotes the anti-sintering ability and the desorption of propylene. The positive roles of defects in carbon nanotubes (CNTs) is also reported for CNT-supported Pt-catalyzed PDH reactions.111 The presence of defects causes an SMSI with Pt to inhibit Pt agglomeration and increase the anti-coking stability, and therefore results in enhanced stability and activity of Pt supported on the defect-rich CNTs than Pt on the defect-poor CNTs.
The ball milled hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) nanosheets with abundant fault edge B-O defects can properly modify the geometric and electronic states and catalytic properties of localized Pt/Cu nanoclusters through strong bonding interactions.112 The Pt/Cu/h-BN-sheet catalyst with only 100 ppm Pt exhibits propylene selectivity of >99% and high propylene formation rate of 7.3 s1 in the PDH reaction at a low temperature of 520 C, which is approximately ten times higher than the best value for the reported Pt/Cu single-atom alloy catalyst.
2.2. CrOx-, VOx- and GaOx-based catalysts
2.2.1. CrOx The supported CrOx-based catalysts in the alkane DH reactions have been studied for several decades, which are reliable for use in the commercial Catofin PDH process. By means of regulating the loading amount, preparation method, supports and promoters, the existing state (isolated ions or aggregated particles) and the valence from 6+ to 2+ can be changed for developing efficient CrOx-based DH catalysts with structural stability and anti-coking ability. The recent progress of Cr-based DH catalysts is summarized in Table 4.

Al2O3 is mostly utilized as a support for active CrOx sites. A rod-shaped porous Al2O3 possessing a weakened surface acidity in comparison with the commercial Al2O3 has been adopted as the support of the active Cr2O3 sites, and this CrAl-800 catalyst shows a significantly lower coke deposition amount than the reference catalyst (3.6% vs. 15.7%) in the PDH reactions at 600 C.113 An enhanced SMSI between Cr species and Al2O3 support through high-temperature reduction treatment by H2 induces the migration of active Cr sites into the substrate layers of Al2O3. Therefore, the desorption barrier of propylene on the catalyst could be reduced for avoiding CC cracking and deep hydrogenation, increasing the catalyst stability and anti-coking ability in the PDH reactions at 580 C.114 The interaction between Cr and support can be modified by the Ce, Zr or Sn additive.115117 For a 5% CeCr/Al2O3 catalyst, the amounts of inactive isolated Cr(IV) site and oxygen vacancy are decreased and increased, respectively, because of a promoted CeCr interaction.115 The Zr-modified Al2O3 support suppresses the formation of CrAl solid solution phase and increases the dispersion degree of CrOx species on the supports for substantially promoting the PDH activity of the Cr/ZrAl2O3 catalyst.116 The addition of a small amount of Sn to the formed Al2O3 not only eliminates the strong acid sites for inhibiting the coke formation but also improves the distribution of Cr active sites for enhanced PDH activity and selectivity.117 The Cr-based catalysts on the commercial silica gel or mesoporous MCM-41 support are also widely studied in the non-oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane and propane and the oxidative dehydrogenation in the presence of CO2.118125 In the case of 2 wt% Cr/MCM-41 catalyst, the coexistence of the CrII and CrIII phases during the PDH reaction is evidenced by the operando XAS characterizations.126 For the Cr/MCM-41 catalyst with a high Cr loading of 15%, isolated CrVI species exist as the inactive sites to be hardly reduced, causing decreased activity and propylene selectivity in the PDH reactions.127 The well-defined model species of CrIII silicate are prepared by the surface organometallic chemistry (Fig. 15a).128 During the PDH reaction, the propane CH bond activation over the CrIIIOSi site is heterolytic cleavage with a σ-bond metathesis character (Fig. 15b). A promotion effect of a pretreatment with ethanol vapor on the PDH activity of Cr/SiO2 catalyst is also reported through reducing the coordinated Cr6+ to the active Cr3+ sites.129 Fig. 15 Schematic representation of (a) the formation from hydroxylated SiO2 and Cr-precursor and (b) the catalytic PDH mechanism of the chromium(iii) silicates. Reprinted from ref. 128, copyright 2015, with permission from ACS.
Enhanced PDH performances of Zn- and Zr-promoted CrOx catalysts are achieved.130,131 The addition of ZnO to Cr2O3 causes the formation of a ZnZr2O4 spinel structure with a reduced particle size and an increased content of the defect sites. By modifying the intrinsic activity of the active sites with a significantly declined apparent activation energy, the optimal Zn0.3Cr catalyst displays 31% conversion and 94% propylene selectivity in the PDH reaction at 480 C and 5000 mL gcat1 h1 space velocity. Using CMK-3 as the hard template agent, the CrZrO catalysts possess well-ordered mesoporous structure, large specific surface area and coexisting species of the non-redox Cr3+ and redox Cr5+ and Cr6+ in high dispersion states, which benefit the enhanced catalytic PDH performances. The addition of K dopant into the CrZr matrix further promotes the propylene selectivity (96%) and anti-coking ability. The synergistic effects between Ni promoter and CrOx are also reported to enhance the activity with ca. 24% increase for Cr-Ni/Al2O3-catalzyed PDH reaction.132 The presence of Ni additives plays two roles. One is to form the oligomeric CrOx species, while another one is to form the active Cr3+ sites by reducing the content of Cr6+.
