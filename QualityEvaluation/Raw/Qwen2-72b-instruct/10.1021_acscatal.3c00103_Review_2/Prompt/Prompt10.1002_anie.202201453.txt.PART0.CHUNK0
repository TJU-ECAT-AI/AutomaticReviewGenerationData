Synergistic Mechanism of Platinum-GaOx Catalysts for Propane Dehydrogenation Graphical Abstract The synergistic mechanism of Pt-modified Ga2O3 for propane dehydrogenation is discussed. The presence of Pt can assist H2 dissociation and increase the surface coverage of hydrogen species, which promotes the propylene production. The research provides guidance for the rational design of metalmetal oxide catalysts.
Abstract The synergy between metals and metal oxides can effectively improve the heterogeneous catalytic process. This paper describes the intrinsic effect of Pt modification over GaOx (PtGaOx) on propane dehydrogenation. The presence of Pt promotes H2 dissociation and surface coverage of hydrogen species, which is beneficial for the activation of CH in propane. With excessive Pt, Gaδ+ can be further reduced to form PtGa alloy with less surface hydrogen species. Consequently, the relative propylene formation rate between PtGaOx and the summed contribution of individual Pt and GaOx increases linearly with the content of hydrogen species. Optimally, the relative propylene formation rate of PtGaOx with 0.03wt% Pt exceeds 25% of the summed contribution of individual components.
Introduction An increasing demand-supply gap exists in propylene market due to an extensive requirement for propylene derivatives such as acrylonitrile, polypropylene, acrylic acids, and propylene oxide. The supply of propane has grown rapidly owing to the emerging technologies for the exploitation of shale gas in recent years.1 Therefore, propane dehydrogenation (PDH) has received extensive attentions as an on-purpose propylene production technology. Industrialized PDH plants generally utilize CrOx-based and Pt-based catalysts. However, these two kinds of catalysts are either environmentally hazardous or expensive.2 A series of alternative metal oxide catalysts with low cost and low toxicity, including VOx,3 GaOx,4 ZnO,5 ZrO26 and so forth, have already been under development. Nevertheless, PDH reactivity over metal oxide-based catalysts is usually much lower than that over Pt-based catalysts.1b The modification of metal oxides by noble metals has been proved to be an effective strategy to improve the low reactivity of metal oxides in catalyzing PDH. It has been reported that noble metals can act as promoters to enhance the catalytic performance of metal oxide-based catalysts, such as GaOx-based,4a, 7 ZnO-based5a and ZrO2-based6b, 6c, 8 catalysts. Researchers have proposed various regulatory mechanisms of noble metals on metal oxides. Gong and co-workers5a revealed that ZnO was promoted to be a stronger Lewis acid through the electron transfer from metal oxide to Pt, which attenuated the reduction of ZnO and enhanced the stability. In addition, the importance of noble metals in promoting H2 dissociation is emphasized. Kondratenko and co-workers6b suggested that low hydrogen adsorption energy barrier on Rh was favorable for H2 dissociation into H atoms and spillover onto the surface of ZrO2. Thus, the lattice oxygen was removed from ZrO2 to generate more coordinately unsaturated Zr4+ sites for PDH reaction. In addition, H2 desorption, served as the rate-limiting step for PDH on ZrO2, was also facilitated by Rh. Similarly, this promotion of noble metals for zirconia can be achieved on Pt, Ru and Ir.8 With trace amounts (<0.15wt%) of noble metals, PDH reaction performance on zirconia can be enhanced prominently.8 Gallium oxide is a potentially alternative catalyst for PDH due to high dehydrogenation activity and environmental friendliness.1b Recently, Weckhuysen and co-workers4a have found that with 1000ppm Pt modification, propane conversion was doubled in comparison with pure Ga2O3. Coordinately unsaturated Ga3+ species were suggested to be the active species, while 1000ppm Pt was nearly inactive for PDH. Pt was postulated to assist the regeneration of GaH/GaOH species, but the role of these species in PDH was not clear. Moreover, under hydrogen atmosphere, gallium oxide is defective and the state of the surface Ga species is complicated, including Ga3+,4b, 4c Gaδ+,9 GaHx species4d, 10 and so forth. Furthermore, the addition of Pt can promote the reduction of gallium oxide, forming PtGa alloy and consequently increasing complexity of the system.9, 11 The individual roles of Pt and Ga2O3 and the nature of their synergy are still elusive.4a, 12 Therefore, the determination of surface species under in situ condition is necessary to understand the interaction between Pt and Ga2O3 and the essence of the synergistic effect.In this work, to identify the synergistic effect between Pt and Ga2O3 for PDH with H2 cofeeding, Ga2O3 catalysts modified with various Pt loadings were investigated. Based on high-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscope (AC-HAADF-STEM), quasi in situ X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (quasi in situ XPS), D2 temperature-programmed surface reaction (D2-TPSR) and in situ diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (in situ DRIFTS) measurements, the surface structure and gallium hydride/hydroxide species of PtGa2O3 were explored. The intrinsic role of Pt and its effect on gallium oxides were also discussed. Gallium hydrides (Gaδ+H) over Pt-modified gallium oxide catalysts were found to be the key species for the synergy.Results and Discussion The catalytic performance of xPt3Ga2O3 for PDH reaction is examined. To exclude diffusion effect, the tests are under kinetic regime. The initial propylene formation rate, which is defined as the moles of C3H6 formation per mass of catalyst per hour, is collected at 5minutes of the reaction. As shown in Figure1a, the formation rate increases until the content of Pt reaches 0.03wt% and then remains slowly increases when Pt increases to 0.3wt%.Figure 1 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint a)The initial C3H6 formation rate of 3Ga2O3 (yellow), xPt (gray) and xPt3Ga2O3 (blue). b)The initial C3H6 formation rate of xPt3Ga2O3 (blue) and xPt+3Ga2O3 (mixture of gray and yellow). The relative C3H6 formation rate (brown) between xPt3Ga2O3 and xPt+3Ga2O3. x=0.003, 0.01, 0.03, 0.05, 0.1, 0.3. Test conditions: WHSV=50h1, m=0.02g, T=600C, C3H8/H2=1:1.In order to evaluate the synergistic effect of the Pt-modified gallium oxide catalysts on PDH reactivity, Pt and Ga2O3 catalysts are tested as reference, respectively. The relative propylene formation rate is defined as the promotion in propylene formation rate over Pt-modified gallium oxides, which is obtained by subtracting the individual contribution of xPt and 3Ga2O3 (named as xPt+3Ga2O3) from the total propylene formation rate over xPtGa2O3. This relative formation rate presents a volcano profile with Pt content (Figure1b). With Pt loading of less than 0.1wt%, the relative propylene formation rate of xPtGa2O3 shows positive value. It indicates the promotional effect between Pt and Ga2O3, which can lead to a higher PDH performance than the summation of contribution of individual xPt and 3Ga2O3. The variation in the relative propylene formation rate means the degree of the mutual promotion varies with Pt loading. This mutual promotion is supposed to be the synergistic effect, which represents that the interaction between chemical components results in a higher effect than the sum of individual effects.13 The synergy between Pt and Ga2O3 has also been reported over PtGa2O3K catalyst for PDH in previous research.4a Optimally, 0.03Pt3Ga2O3 catalyst obtains about 97mmolg1h1 of propylene formation rate, which exceeds 25% of the summed contribution of individual 0.03Pt and 3Ga2O3, and achieves the most noticeable synergistic effect. It achieves 12% of propane conversion, 88% of total propylene selectivity and 95% of propylene gas phase selectivity (FigureS1a,b). The low deactivation rate (kd=0.03h1) at 550C demonstrates its high stability (FigureS1d). In addition, 0.03Pt3Ga2O3 shows relatively high C3H6 formation rate among the state of art of metal oxide-based catalysts and reaches the performance level of Pt-based catalysts (FigureS1e). To further investigate the noticeable synergistic effect on 0.03Pt3Ga2O3 catalyst, the propylene formation rate over physical mixture of 0.03Pt and 3Ga2O3 is tested (FigureS1c). It shows that the propylene formation rate over physical mixture sample is slightly higher than 0.03Pt+3Ga2O3 but much lower than 0.03Pt3Ga2O3. This indicates that the proximity of these two components should be close enough to generate a prominent mutual promotion for catalyzing PDH.9, 14 To elucidate the mutual promotion over PtGa2O3 for PDH reaction, the catalyst structure needs to be clarified. 3Ga2O3, 0.03Pt3Ga2O3 and 0.1Pt3Ga2O3 catalysts are selected in order to understand the evolution of the synergistic effect.Transmission electron microscopy (TEM), high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM) and AC-HAADF-STEM images of reduced catalysts are shown in Figure2. Over 3Ga2O3 catalyst, 5nm Ga2O3 nanoparticles are observed (Figure2ac). The lattice spacings are 0.264, 0.254 and 0.241nm, corresponding to Ga2O3 (121), (111) and (401) plane, respectively.15 The homogeneous distribution of gallium on Al2O3 support is confirmed by energy dispersive spectrometry (EDS) elemental mapping analysis (FigureS2a). Over 0.03Pt3Ga2O3, Pt nanoparticles are 0.80.2nm (Figure2e), which is relatively scattered and isolated (FigureS2b). Over 0.1Pt3Ga2O3, Pt nanoparticles of 1.20.3nm are found (Figure2f). The atomic plane distances are measured as 0.218nm and 0.194nm, agreeing with a lattice spacing of Pt1Ga1 alloy phase, along with (111) and (200) facets11, 16 (FigureS2c and Figure2d).Figure 2 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint a)TEM and b)HR-TEM images of 3Ga2O3. c)HR-TEM image of 0.03Pt3Ga2O3. d)HR-TEM image of 0.3Pt3Ga2O3. e)AC-HAADF-STEM image and particle size distribution of 0.03Pt3Ga2O3. f)AC-HAADF-STEM image and particle size distribution of 0.1Pt3Ga2O3.To identify the surface structure and chemical state of the catalysts, quasi in situ XPS, hydrogen temperature-programmed reaction (H2-TPR) and CO-DRIFTS were carried out. Quasi in situ XPS experiments were conducted after H2 reduction for 60min at 600C to test the valance state of Ga on the surface. Binding energies in spectra of Ga 2p3/2 at 1118.9, 1117.6 and 1116.8eV are assigned to Ga3+, Gaδ+ (0<δ<3), and Ga0 ions,4b, 17 respectively (Figure3a). Cybulskis etal.4b suggested the Ga species at 1117.6eV can be ascribed to the partially reduced Ga through operando XANES and XPS after H2 pre-treated at 650C, and H ligand can be coordinated to the partially reduced Ga. The formation of oxygen vacancy leads to the change of Ga charge, which affects the valence state of Ga. The relative surface contents of three kinds of Ga species are shown in TableS2. Without Pt doping, there are 19% Gaδ+ and 81% Ga3+ on the surface, indicating the Ga2O3 can hardly be completely reduced by H2.18 The introduction of Pt into the catalyst leads to deeper reduction of Ga2O3, where Ga3+ decreases to 67% and Gaδ+ increases to 33%. It is in agreement with previous report that Pt-dissociated H species spillover on Ga2O3 leads to the partial reduction of Ga3+.19 When the content of Pt increases to more than 0.1wt%, Gaδ+ is rare on the surface because the excessive Pt helps the further reduction of Gaδ+ to Ga0 with formation of Pt1Ga1 alloy, which can be demonstrated by the HR-TEM image (Figure2d and FigureS2c). According to Poelman etal.,9 it may originate from the migration of GaOx towards Pt clusters, rendering its reduction and subsequent formation of PtGa alloy.Figure 3 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint a)Quasi in situ XPS spectra of Ga 2p3/2, b)H2-TPR profiles and c)CO-DRIFTS spectra on 3Ga2O3, 0.03Pt3Ga2O3 and 0.1Pt3Ga2O3 after H2 reduction at 600C.Reduction properties of fresh catalysts are further determined through H2-TPR (Figure3b). Three different reduction peaks are centered close to 251 (peak I), 403478 (peak II) and 640870C (peak III). The peak I, II and III are generally ascribed to the reduction of PtOx species,20 well-dispersed Ga species (small Ga2O3 particles and/or highly dispersed gallyl ion species probably GaO+18, 21) and segregated bulk Ga2O3,22 respectively. Compared with 3Ga2O3, contents of small Ga2O3 particles and/or (GaO)+ species become higher on 0.03Pt3Ga2O3, and the increase of Pt enhances the hydrogen consumption on 0.1Pt3Ga2O3. The average state of Ga within 600C is quantified by H2-TPR, which is 2.97, 2.89 and 2.67 over 3Ga2O3, 0.03Pt3Ga2O3 and 0.1Pt3Ga2O3, respectively (TableS3). Pt is conductive to the reduction of Ga2O3, which is consistent with the XPS results.CO-DRIFTS is used to investigate the properties of Pt atoms at surface. As shown in Figure3c, CO linear adsorption peak can be observed over 0.03Pt3Ga2O3, suggesting that Pt is not fully covered by Ga2O3.5a When the Pt content increases, the relative intensity of linear band is much stronger, due to more Pt nanoparticles exposed on the surface. Moreover, the peak at 2090cm1 is attributed to Pt species which remain predominantly isolated23 over 0.03Pt3Ga2O3. CO stretching frequency shifts from 2090cm1 to 2085cm1 with Pt increases to 0.1%, which indicates the formation of PtGa alloy nanoparticle resulting in a higher surface electron density of Pt.24 As reported,25 the CO stretching frequency will shift of 20cm1 when the size of Pt increases from 1nm to over 2nm on Pt/Al2O3. However. the CO stretching frequency is 2084cm1 over 0.3Pt3Ga2O3 (FigureS3), which is similar to 0.1Pt3Ga2O3, indicating that the particle size effect is almost negligible and the formation of PtGa alloy has a great effect on CO wavenumber shift. The results from CO-DRIFTS are in broad agreement with TEM, XPS and H2-TPR characterizations.To summarize, after one-hour H2 reduction at 600C, the corresponding surface structures of 3Ga2O3, 0.03Pt3Ga2O3 and 0.1Pt3Ga2O3 are partially reduced gallium oxide (GaOx), partially reduced gallium oxide with Pt (PtGaOx) and partially reduced gallium oxide with Pt1Ga1 alloy (PtGa-GaOx), respectively. According to the relative reactivity for PDH (Figure1b), it is supposed that PtGaOx surface structure plays a significant role in the mutual promotion effect.Further investigation of surface species of Ga under real PDH reaction atmosphere is necessary to identify the structural reason for the synergistic effect of Pt-modified gallium oxide catalysts.4d, 10a According to the analysis of surface structures mentioned above, gallium oxide surface is defective with oxygen vacancies after reduction. Compared with perfect gallium oxide, hydrogen is easier to dissociate and adsorb on the surface of gallium oxide with oxygen vacancy and bind to the Ga site adjacent to the oxygen vacancy. The presence of oxygen vacancy can promote the production of GaH species.4b, 26 A number of GaH species, including [GaH2]+H+, [GaH]2+ and [GaH2]+, which form on Ga/HMFI or Ga/ZSM-5, have been proposed to be active sites for PDH.4d, 10a, 27 To further explore the evolution of surface species on the Pt-modified gallium oxides, in situ DRIFTS is used over 3Ga2O3, 0.03Pt3Ga2O3 and 0.1Pt3Ga2O3, which can provide spectroscopic evidence for GaOH, GaH, AlOH species.4d, 4e, 10a To further illustrate the evolution of the synergistic effect and make a comparison, 0.3Pt3Ga2O3 and 0.01Pt3Ga2O3 are also studied (FigureS4).DRIFTS spectra are collected at three stages of catalysts treatments: 1) prereduction at 600C for 1h in flowing 42vol% H2/Ar; 2) purging for 0.5h in flowing Ar; and 3) in situ experiment in flowing 14/14/72vol% C3H8/H2/Ar. Figure4a shows the variation of surface species over time during above treatments, using 0.03Pt3Ga2O3 catalyst as an illustrative case. When the fresh catalysts are first exposed to H2, a broad band appears around 3555cm1, which is assigned to the stretching vibration of OH on Ga sites [υ(GaOH)], distinguished from the bands of hydroxyl groups of aluminum (FigureS5).19, 28 The intensity of GaOH decreases with the prolonging of H2-reduction time and disappeared at 20min, indicating gallium oxide is reduced through surface O elimination by dehydroxylation. The coordination of Ga3+ becomes unsaturated on such defective gallium oxide surface.26, 29 New bands at 1980cm1 and 2017cm1 appear along with the decrease of GaOH, assigned to the stretching vibration of H bonded with coordinately unsaturated gallium cations [υ(Gaδ+H)] in octahedral [υ(Gaδ+(o)H)] and tetrahedral [υ(Gaδ+(t)H)] positions.19, 28, 30 According to the literature,31 the PtH species is excluded because there is no PtH peak at 2090cm1 shows in Figure4. Also, the experimental phase diagram of PtH32 shows the PtH species theoretically can not exist in atmospheric pressure at 600C, which confirms the new bands at 1980cm1 and 2017cm1 are abscribed to Gaδ+H. The intensity of Gaδ+H is nearly unchanged at 5060min in flowing H2, suggesting the reduction of surface gallium oxide has reached equilibrium. However, after Ar purging for 5min, intensity of Gaδ+H substantially reduces and totally disappears at 30min (FigureS6a), indicating hydrogen atmosphere is necessary for the existence of Gaδ+H species.Figure 4 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint a)In situ DRIFTS spectra of 0.03Pt3Ga2O3. b)DRIFTS spectra after H2 reduction for 1h and c)in situ C3H8-DRIFTS spectra after in situ reaction for 30min of 3Ga2O3, 0.03Pt3Ga2O3, 0.1Pt3Ga2O3 and 0.3Pt3Ga2O3. Gaδ+H intensity as a function of time during d)H2 reduction and e)in situ reaction.According to the in situ experiments, Gaδ+H species saturate quickly at 5min without obvious formation of GaOH species during the whole time, indicating H atoms tend to bond to surface Ga sites rather than O sites on the defective gallium oxide. Moreover, Gaδ+H bands cannot be observed without H2 cofeeding, further demonstrating H2 is beneficial for the stability of Gaδ+H species (FigureS6b). The propylene formation rate without cofeeding H2 is 53.6mmolg1h1, which is 43.5mmolg1h1 lower than the rate with the H2 partial pressure of 14% (FigureS6c) over 0.03Pt3Ga2O3. The reaction order of H2 is 0.69 (FigureS6d) and the relative propylene formation rate increases with the partial pressure of hydrogen increases (FigureS6ef), confirming that H2 cofeeding does favor the forward reaction over the reverse reaction and contribute to synergy during the PDH on the 0.03Pt3Ga2O3 at a certain partial pressure of H2.The variations of surface species with Pt contents are explored (Figure4be). For the prereduction stage (Figure4b and d), the rate constant of Gaδ+H formation rate shows in FigureS7. The addition of Pt contributes to the faster generation of Gaδ+H species on the surface of 0.03Pt3Ga2O3 than pure 3Ga2O3, which is due to low hydrogen activation energy barrier of Pt.30c For in situ experiments (Figure4c and e), Gaδ+H species quickly generate within 5min and intensity of the bonds are almost unchanged in the following time. Meanwhile, as the spectra shown in FigureS8ad, the wavenumbers of the Gaδ+(o)H and Gaδ+(t)H don't change, which maintain at 1980cm1 and 2017cm1 when Pt increases. It suggests the property of the increased Gaδ+H content caused by Pt addition is identical with Gaδ+H in Ga2O3 sample. When the Pt loading is 0.03wt% with the formation of PtGaOx surface structure, the initial intensity of Gaδ+H is higher than pure 3Ga2O3, suggesting a higher gallium hydride content. However, the intensity of Gaδ+H does not increase monotonously with Pt loading. For 0.1Pt3Ga2O3 and 0.3Pt3Ga2O3 with the formation of PtGa-GaOx surface structure, the intensity of Gaδ+H is lower than 3Ga2O3.It's worth noting that with the increase of Pt loading, the intensity variation of Gaδ+H species shows consistent trends with the change of relative propylene formation rate of xPt3Ga2O3 catalysts. The quantitative relationship between them is shown in Figure5a. The relative Gaδ+H intensity in corresponding to the relative propylene formation rate is used, which is the intensity deviation of 3Ga2O3 and xPt3Ga2O3. A linear relationship is shown between the relative propylene formation rate and relative Gaδ+H intensity with the Pt loading ranging from 0 to 0.1wt%, suggesting Gaδ+H is the key species to influence the promotion phenomena for PDH over PtGaOx surface structure. Over 0.3Pt3Ga2O3, low concentration of Gaδ+H and the deviation from this linear relationship indicate that Gaδ+H species becomes less significant and may not be the primary active site for PDH over PtGaGaOx surface structure. The Gaδ+H intensity on physical mixture of 0.03Pt and 3Ga2O3 is little higher than 3Ga2O3 and much lower than 0.03Pt3Ga2O3 during reaction (FigureS4b), which further verifies the proximity of Pt and Ga2O3 should be close enough to exert the synergistic effect.Figure 5 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint a)Relative C3H6 formation rate of the catalysts as a function of relative Gaδ+H intensity. b)C3H8-TPSR profiles of 3Ga2O3, 0.03Pt3Ga2O3 and 0.03Pt.To analyze the influence of the different kinds of hydride species on catalytic performance, the ratio of intensity of Gaδ+(o)H/Gaδ+(t)H in Figure4c is calculated (FigureS8). According to Collins etal.,28 the contents of two kinds of hydride species vary over different bulk gallium oxide polymorphs. As for α-Ga2O3 which contains only tetrahedral Ga, the hydride species nearly bond to tetrahedral Ga. As for monoclinic crystalline structure of β-Ga2O3, which contains both octahedral and tetrahedral Ga, the hydride species bond to both octahedral and tetrahedral Ga. However, α-Ga2O3 and β-Ga2O3 are both active for PDH.33 It is speculated that tetrahedral Gaδ+H and octahedral Gaδ+H may both be the key species to active PDH. Meanwhile, the ratio of intensity of Gaδ+(o)H/Gaδ+(t)H (FigureS8) maintains around 1.1 when Pt increases. Therefore, the contents of both hydride species have positive correlation with the PDH performance.Furthermore, the initial C3H6 formation rate and the absolute value of Gaδ+H intensity are shown in FigureS9. When Pt loading is less than 0.1wt%, it is observed that the trends of formation rate and Gaδ+H intensity with Pt loading are consistent. However, inconsistent trends are observed with Pt loading of more than 0.1wt%, in which the formation rate remains relatively stable while Gaδ+H intensity sharply decreases with Pt. This indicates the effect of gallium oxide on PDH could become weaker with the increase of Pt, which may lead to the change of the active sites.C3H8 temperature-programmed surface reaction (C3H8-TPSR) is shown in Figure5b and FigureS10. Initial CH cleavage starts at about 405C on 3Ga2O3, 272C on 0.03Pt3Ga2O3 and 277C on 0.03Pt, respectively. The CH activation temperatures of 0.03PtGa2O3 and 0.03Pt are similar, indicating that Pt plays a role in CH activation. Also, the initial CH cleavage starts at about 443C on 3Ga2O3 without H2 cofeeding, which is 38C higher than 3Ga2O3 with H2 cofeeding (FigureS10b). It suggests that Gaδ+H has stronger dehydrogenation activity. More Gaδ+H content in PtGaOx structure leads the higher propylene formation rate.The content of Gaδ+H species has been shown to vary with the Pt loading as observed in DRIFTS characterization. In order to further understand the synergistic effect for PDH over xPt3Ga2O3, the role of Pt in modulating surface Gaδ+H species is further confirmed.D2 temperature-programmed surface reaction (D2-TPSR) shows that H2 dissociation and HD formation happened at lower temperature with increasing Pt loading (Figure6a). It is indicated that the doped Pt can contribute to higher activity in the HH bond dissociation, compared to Ga2O3. The dissociation energy barrier for hydrogen is much lower over Pt according to previous reports.30c Also, in situ DRIFTS profiles (Figure4c and e) have shown the intensity of Gaδ+H over xPt3Ga2O3 (x<0.1) is higher than 3Ga2O3. Therefore, it is reasonable to hypothesize that over PtGaOx surface structure, Pt can promote the dissociation of H2 and result in the dissociated H overflowing to surface Ga2O3, leading Gaδ+H contents to increase. This mechanism of hydrogen spillover from metal to oxide has also been reported in Rh, Cu, Ru/ZrO2 systems.6b, 6c Figure 6 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint a)HD signals of 3Ga2O3, 0.03Pt3Ga2O3 and 0.1Pt3Ga2O3 in D2-TPSR. b)In situ C3H8-DRIFTS during heating up in H2 from 50 to 300C on reduced 3Ga2O3, 0.03Pt3Ga2O3 and 0.1Pt3Ga2O3.To investigate whether the dissociated H will affect the generation of Gaδ+H species, temperature-ramping in situ DRIFTS spectra is collected in Figure6b. After H2 reduction at 600C for 1h, the catalysts were cooled down to 50C under flowing Ar and then heated up from 50 to 300C under flowing H2. Gaδ+H species appear at 100C on 0.03Pt3Ga2O3 and 0.1Pt3Ga2O3, which is 50C lower than appearance temperature of Gaδ+H species on 3Ga2O3. Furthermore, Gaδ+H intensity is higher with 0.03wt% Pt doping, indicating that Gaδ+H species form easier and more over PtGaOx structure. This also implies that Pt can not only activate CH, but also has strong hydrogen dissociation ability which can lead hydrogen overflow to surface Ga2O3, modulating the content of surface positive gallium ions and the coverage of hydrogen. Such synergistic effect leads to more Gaδ+H content in PtGaOx structure than pure Ga2O3, resulting in the higher catalyst activity over PtGaOx. However, with Pt loading of more than 0.1wt%, Gaδ+H species become less although H2 dissociation become easier. This is because that the gallium ions are further reduced by hydrogen dissociated over Pt to form PtGa alloy.9 The shift of the peak position in Figure6b is caused by the increased temperature. The same phenomenon is reported previously.10b, 19 Conclusion In conclusion, the synergistic mechanism of PtGa2O3 catalysts for propane dehydrogenation with H2 cofeeding is determined in this study. With the increase of Pt loading, the propylene formation rate on Pt-modified gallium oxide is promoted compared to the summation of contribution of individual pure Pt and gallium oxide. The promotion, i.e. the relative propylene formation rate, is utilized to describe synergistic effect, presenting a volcano-shaped profile. Moreover, the relative propylene formation rate has a linear relationship with the surface Gaδ+H content which has a higher activation capability for propane. When Pt loading is 0.03wt% with Pt-modified defective gallium oxide surface structure, the most prominent synergistic promotion for propane dehydrogenation is achieved due to the highest coverage of surface Gaδ+H species. The presence of Pt facilitates the hydrogen dissociation and spillover on Ga2O3 surface, leading to a higher Gaδ+H content and stronger propane activation ability. When Pt loading is more than 0.1wt%, Gaδ+ is further reduced to form PtGa alloy, which causes the less Gaδ+H and the decrease of the synergistic effect. The analysis of surface species under in situ conditions can establish the relationship between the catalytic reactivity and surface species, which provides a promising route for exploring the catalytic mechanism of metal-oxide catalysts.
