1.The document does not provide information on the key strategies and approaches that have been recently developed to enhance the catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes. However, it does discuss the effects of composition and metal particle size on ethane dehydrogenation over PtxSn100x/Mg(Al)O (70  x  100) catalysts. The study found that the specific activity of PtxSn100x/Mg(Al)O for ethane dehydrogenation increases with increasing metal particle size and increasing Sn/Pt ratio. Carbon deposition decreases with decreasing metal particle size and increasing Sn/Pt ratio. These findings suggest that controlling the particle size and composition of the catalyst can improve its stability and performance in dehydrogenation processes.

1.文档没有提供关于最近开发的关键策略和方法来增强直接脱氢过程中支撑金属催化剂的催化稳定性的信息。但是,它确实讨论了组成和金属颗粒大小对PtxSn100x/Mg(Al)O (70  x  100)催化剂上乙烷脱氢的影响。研究发现,PtxSn100x/Mg(Al)O对乙烷脱氢的特定活性随着金属颗粒大小的增加和Sn/Pt比的增加而增加。碳沉积随着金属颗粒大小的减小和Sn/Pt比的增加而减小。这些发现表明,控制催化剂的颗粒大小和组成可以改善其在脱氢过程中的稳定性和性能。
