Read the questions and answers provided below. First, critically assess the overall relevance of the answers provided to the set of questions asked.

If, upon your assessment, you find that the answers do not contain information that is relevant to the questions asked, stop your review process immediately and respond with a single sentence: "※※※※※※※The provided answers are not relevant to the questions.※※※※※※※". Do not provide any additional explanation or background information, only this sentence should be given as a response in case of irrelevant answers.

If, however, the answers are relevant to the questions asked, proceed to compile answers for each question according to the instructions below. Ensure to aggregate all the relevant answers from the multiple answer results provided in the document, and organize them sequentially by their order number, compiling the corresponding quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question.

If the provided answers' quotes are not differentiated by question, ensure to break them down and assign the quotes to each respective question, outputting them separately within each question's section.

To provide a comprehensive review, differentiate the responses into quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question based on the details given in the 'Answer' XML tags. Structure your review using the XML format showcased below if the answers are relevant to the questions asked:

1.The document does not provide information on the key strategies and approaches that have been recently developed to enhance the catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes. However, it does discuss the effects of composition and metal particle size on ethane dehydrogenation over PtxSn100x/Mg(Al)O (70  x  100) catalysts. The study found that the specific activity of PtxSn100x/Mg(Al)O for ethane dehydrogenation increases with increasing metal particle size and increasing Sn/Pt ratio. Carbon deposition decreases with decreasing metal particle size and increasing Sn/Pt ratio. These findings suggest that controlling the particle size and composition of the catalyst can improve its stability and performance in dehydrogenation processes.

1.文档没有提供关于最近开发的关键策略和方法的信息，以增强直接脱氢过程中支撑金属催化剂的催化稳定性。但是，它确实讨论了组成和金属粒径对PtxSn100x/Mg(Al)O (70  x  100)催化剂上乙烷脱氢的影响。研究发现，PtxSn100x/Mg(Al)O对乙烷脱氢的特定活性随金属粒径和Sn/Pt比的增加而增加。碳沉积随金属粒径的减小和Sn/Pt比的增加而减小。这些发现表明，控制催化剂的粒径和组成可以提高其在脱氢过程中的稳定性和性能。
