1.The literature does not provide information on the key strategies and approaches that have been recently developed to enhance the catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes. However, it does describe a specific catalyst system, a boron nitride nanosheet-supported Pt/Cu cluster, which exhibits high efficiency for propane dehydrogenation. The catalyst's performance is attributed to the unique geometry of the Pt/Cu cluster maintained by the h-BN nanosheet support, which has abundant fault edges and strong bonding of copper with edge BO defects. This structure leads to remarkable improvement in catalytic efficiency, demonstrating an approach to optimizing catalyst design for industrial applications.

1.文献没有提供关于最近开发的增强支撑金属催化剂在直接脱氢过程中的催化稳定性的关键策略和方法的信息。但是，它确实描述了一种特定的催化剂系统，即硼氮化物纳米片支撑的Pt/Cu簇，它在丙烷脱氢中表现出高效率。催化剂的性能归因于h-BN纳米片支撑保持的Pt/Cu簇的独特几何形状，该支撑具有丰富的缺陷边缘和铜与边缘BO缺陷的强键合。这种结构导致催化效率显著提高，展示了优化催化剂设计以适应工业应用的方法。
