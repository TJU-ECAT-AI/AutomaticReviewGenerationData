1.The literature does not provide information on the key strategies and approaches that have been recently developed to enhance the catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes. However, it does describe a specific catalyst system, a boron nitride nanosheet-supported Pt/Cu cluster, which exhibits high efficiency and stability for propane dehydrogenation. The unique geometry of the Pt/Cu cluster, maintained by the strong bonding interaction between copper and edge BO defects on the h-BN nanosheets, is attributed to the remarkable improvement in catalytic efficiency. This system addresses the challenge of minimizing platinum usage while maximizing catalytic activity, which is crucial for industrial applications.

1.文献没有提供关于最近开发的增强支撑金属催化剂在直接脱氢过程中的催化稳定性的关键策略和方法的信息。但是，它确实描述了一种特定的催化剂系统，即硼氮化物纳米片支撑的Pt/Cu簇，它在丙烷脱氢中表现出高效率和稳定性。Pt/Cu簇的独特几何形状，由铜和h-BN纳米片边缘的BO缺陷之间的强键合相互作用维持，被归因于催化效率的显著提高。该系统解决了在工业应用中最小化铂使用量同时最大化催化活性的挑战。
