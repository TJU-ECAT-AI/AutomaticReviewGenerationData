1.The literature does not provide information on the key strategies and approaches that have been recently developed to enhance the catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes. However, it does describe a specific catalyst system, a boron nitride nanosheet-supported Pt/Cu cluster, which exhibits high efficiency and stability for propane dehydrogenation. The unique geometry of the Pt/Cu cluster, maintained by the strong bonding interaction between copper and edge BO defects on the h-BN nanosheets, is attributed to the remarkable improvement in catalytic efficiency. This system addresses the challenge of minimizing platinum usage while maximizing catalytic activity, which is crucial for industrial applications.

1.The literature does not provide information on the key strategies and approaches that have been recently developed to enhance the catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes. However, it does describe a specific case where a hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) nanosheet-supported Pt/Cu cluster catalyst was used to improve the efficiency of propane dehydrogenation. The catalyst was designed to minimize the use of platinum while maximizing its catalytic activity. The h-BN nanosheets provided a high surface area and abundant edges, which were terminated as amino groups. These characteristics made the h-BN nanosheets an appropriate support for loading the Pt/Cu catalyst. The strong bonding interaction between copper and the edge BO defects of the h-BN nanosheets maintained the unique geometry of the Pt/Cu cluster, leading to remarkable improvement in catalytic efficiency. This approach addresses the challenges in catalyst design, fabrication, and performance optimization for industrial applications by reducing the amount of expensive platinum required while maintaining high catalytic activity.

1.文献没有提供关于最近开发的关键策略和方法的信息，这些策略和方法旨在提高直接脱氢过程中支撑金属催化剂的催化稳定性。但是，它确实描述了一个特定案例，其中使用了六方氮化硼（h-BN）纳米片支撑的Pt/Cu簇催化剂来提高丙烷脱氢的效率。催化剂的设计目的是在最大限度提高催化活性的同时最小化铂的使用。h-BN纳米片提供了高比表面积和丰富的边缘，这些边缘以氨基终止。这些特性使h-BN纳米片成为加载Pt/Cu催化剂的合适载体。铜与h-BN纳米片边缘BO缺陷之间的强键合相互作用保持了Pt/Cu簇的独特几何形状，从而显著提高了催化效率。这种方法通过减少所需的昂贵铂金量，同时保持高催化活性，解决了催化剂设计、制造和性能优化的工业应用挑战。
