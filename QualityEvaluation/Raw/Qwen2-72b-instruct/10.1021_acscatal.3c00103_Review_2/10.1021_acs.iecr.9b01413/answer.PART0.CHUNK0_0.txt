1.The literature does not provide specific information on the key strategies and approaches developed to enhance the catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes. However, it does mention that the introduction of various metals (Ce, In, La, and Fe) as promoters into the Pt/Sn-SBA-15 catalyst can significantly affect the initial activity and catalytic stability for propane dehydrogenation. The promoters can improve the redox property, antisintering ability, and resistance to coke deposition, which are responsible for the catalytic stability. The integrated impacts of these factors determine the overall stability of the catalysts.
