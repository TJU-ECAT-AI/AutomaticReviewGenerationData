1.The literature does not provide specific information on the key strategies and approaches developed to enhance the catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes. However, it does mention that the introduction of various metals (Ce, In, La, and Fe) as promoters into the Pt/Sn-SBA-15 catalyst can significantly affect the initial activity and catalytic stability for propane dehydrogenation. The promoters can improve the redox property, antisintering ability, and resistance to coke deposition, which are responsible for the catalytic stability. The integrated impacts of these factors determine the overall stability of the catalysts.

1.The literature does not provide specific information on the key strategies and approaches that have been recently developed to enhance the catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes. However, it does mention that the introduction of transition metal (Zn), alkaline metal (Na, K), alkaline earth metal (Mg, Ca), and rare earth metal (La, Ce), etc. into the catalysts as promotors offered another strategy to enhance the interaction between Pt and Sn and tune the acid-base property simultaneously. The modified catalyst properties further acted positively in promoting the catalytic performances of propane dehydrogenation.

1.The literature does not provide specific information on recent strategies and approaches to enhance the catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes. However, it does discuss the preparation of various metals (Ce, In, La, and Fe) promoted Pt/Sn-SBA-15 catalysts and their characterization and evaluation in propane dehydrogenation. The results show that the nature of the promoter significantly affects the redox properties, surface composition, and lattice oxygen capacity of the catalysts, which in turn influence the initial activity and catalytic stability in propane dehydrogenation. The study highlights the importance of lattice oxygen in determining the initial activity and the integrated impacts of redox properties, anti-sintering ability, and resistance to coke deposition on catalytic stability. The In-promoted catalyst exhibited the best performance during the stability test, with a moderate level of coke deposition and the maximum level of surface Pt species. The introduction of In also promoted the reduction of surface Pt oxides and stabilized the metallic Pt particles, leading to higher propylene selectivity and stability.

1.文献没有提供关于最近增强支撑金属催化剂在直接脱氢过程中的催化稳定性的策略和方法的具体信息。但是,它确实讨论了各种金属(铈、铟、镧和铁)促进的Pt/Sn-SBA-15催化剂的制备及其在丙烷脱氢中的表征和评价。结果表明,促进剂的性质对催化剂的氧化还原性质、表面组成和晶格氧容量有显著影响,进而影响丙烷脱氢的初始活性和催化稳定性。研究强调了晶格氧在决定初始活性方面的重要性,以及氧化还原性质、抗烧结能力和抗焦炭沉积的综合影响对催化稳定性的影响。在稳定性测试中,In促进的催化剂表现出最佳性能,具有中等水平的焦炭沉积和表面Pt物种的最大水平。In的引入还促进了表面Pt氧化物的还原,稳定了金属Pt颗粒,导致更高的丙烯选择性和稳定性。
