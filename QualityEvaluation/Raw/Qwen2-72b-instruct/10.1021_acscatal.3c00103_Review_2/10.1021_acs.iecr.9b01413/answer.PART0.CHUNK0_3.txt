1.The literature does not provide specific information on the key strategies and approaches that have been recently developed to enhance the catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes. However, it does mention that the introduction of various metals (Ce, In, La, and Fe) as promoters into the Pt/Sn-SBA-15 catalysts can significantly affect the initial activity and catalytic stability for propane dehydrogenation. The promoters can improve the redox property, antisintering ability, and resistance to coke deposition, which are responsible for the catalytic stability. The In promoter, in particular, helps to stabilize the surface Pt particles and promotes the reduction of Pt species, leading to better catalytic stability.

1.文献没有提供关于最近开发的关键策略和方法的具体信息，以增强直接脱氢过程中支撑金属催化剂的催化稳定性。但是，它确实提到将各种金属（Ce，In，La和Fe）作为促进剂引入Pt/Sn-SBA-15催化剂中可以显着影响丙烷脱氢的初始活性和催化稳定性。促进剂可以改善氧化还原性质，抗烧结能力和抗焦炭沉积能力，这些是催化稳定性的原因。特别是，In促进剂有助于稳定表面Pt颗粒并促进Pt物种的还原，从而导致更好的催化稳定性。
