1.The stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems such as Pt-3d alloys, are influenced by thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions. CO adsorption at elevated pressures and temperatures can pull the less reactive Cu to the surface of a CuPt near-surface alloy, driven by the formation of a stable self-organized CO/CuPt surface alloy structure. This is due to the drastically stronger PtCO bond when Cu is present in the first surface layer of Pt. The results are expected to apply to a range of coinage (Cu, Ag)/Pt-group bimetallic surface alloys. The bonding of adsorbates can induce changes in local atomic composition and surface structure, changing the activity and selectivity of the catalyst. The CuPt near-surface alloy (NSA) was suggested as a promising water-gas shift catalyst because of reduced PtCO bonding on a Pt catalyst surface with Cu present in the second layer. However, the NSA is unstable at elevated CO pressures and sample temperatures, forming instead a self-organized CO/CuPt surface alloy (SA) structure. The results are confirmed by extended density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Although Cu diffusion to the first layer is endothermic, the drastic increase in CO binding energy more than compensates for the endothermicity. The vastly increased PtCO bond strength when 2/3 ML of Cu is present in the first layer rationalizes the observed Cu surface segregation. The calculated higher stability of the CuPt SA compared with Cu in the bulk with CO adsorption on clean Pt(111) is nearly equal to the free-energy difference (ΔG). The interdiffusion of Cu and Pt becomes significant at 460 K, and the formation and breakup of the stable CO-induced surface alloy start to occur at this temperature. The DFT calculations reproduce the experimental observations and confirm the rationalization of the observed Cu surface segregation. The results for the CuPt system at elevated temperatures and CO pressures, where a novel stable CO-induced surface alloy forms, likely extend to a wide variety of coinage (Cu, Ag)/Pt-group bimetallic surface alloys.

1.双金属催化剂的稳定性、表面分层和结构配置，特别是在基于Pt的系统如Pt-3d合金中，受到热力学偏好和反应条件的影响。在升高的压力和温度下，CO吸附可以将反应性较低的Cu拉到CuPt近表面合金的表面，这是由稳定的自组织CO/CuPt表面合金结构的形成驱动的。这是由于当Cu存在于Pt的第一表面层中时，PtCO键的强度大幅增加。这些结果预计适用于一系列的铜（Cu，Ag）/铂族双金属表面合金。吸附物的结合可以诱导局部原子组成和表面结构的变化，改变催化剂的活性和选择性。CuPt近表面合金（NSA）由于在Cu存在于第二层的Pt催化剂表面上，PtCO键的结合力降低，而被建议作为有前景的水煤气变换催化剂。然而，NSA在升高的CO压力和样品温度下是不稳定的，反而形成自组织的CO/CuPt表面合金（SA）结构。这些结果通过扩展的密度泛函理论（DFT）计算得到证实。虽然Cu扩散到第一层是吸热的，但CO结合能的大幅增加足以补偿吸热性。当2/3 ML的Cu存在于第一层时，PtCO键强度的大幅增加解释了观察到的Cu表面分层。与Cu在体相中与清洁Pt(111)上的CO吸附相比，CuPt SA的计算出的较高稳定性几乎等于自由能差（ΔG）。Cu和Pt的互扩散在460 K时变得显著，而稳定的CO诱导的表面合金的形成和分解开始在这一温度下发生。DFT计算重现了实验观察，并确认了观察到的Cu表面分层的解释。在升高的温度和CO压力下，CuPt系统中形成一种新的稳定的CO诱导的表面合金，这些结果很可能扩展到广泛的铜（Cu，Ag）/铂族双金属表面合金。
