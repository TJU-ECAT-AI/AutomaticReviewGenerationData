[1] "Counterintuitive to expectations and all prior observations of adsorbate-induced surface segregation of the more reactive alloy component (the one forming the stronger bond with the adsorbates), we show that CO adsorption at elevated pressures and temperatures pulls the less reactive Cu to the surface of a CuPt near-surface alloy."
[2] "The Cu surface segregation is driven by the formation of a stable self-organized CO/CuPt surface alloy structure and is rationalized in terms of the radically stronger PtCO bond when Cu is present in the first surface layer of Pt."
[3] "The results, which are expected to apply to a range of coinage (Cu, Ag)/Pt-group bimetallic surface alloys, open up new possibilities in selective and dynamical engineering of alloy surfaces for catalysis."

1.The stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems such as Pt-3d alloys, are influenced by thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions. Contrary to expectations, CO adsorption at elevated pressures and temperatures causes the less reactive Cu to segregate to the surface of a CuPt near-surface alloy. This segregation is driven by the formation of a stable self-organized CO/CuPt surface alloy structure, which is explained by the significantly stronger PtCO bond when Cu is present in the first surface layer of Pt. These findings suggest new possibilities for selective and dynamic engineering of alloy surfaces for catalysis, which could apply to a variety of coinage (Cu, Ag)/Pt-group bimetallic surface alloys.

1.双金属催化剂，特别是基于Pt的系统，如Pt-3d合金，其稳定性、表面分层和结构配置受热力学偏好和反应条件的影响。与预期相反，高压和高温下的CO吸附使不太反应性的Cu在CuPt近表面合金中向表面分层。这种分层是由稳定的自组织CO/CuPt表面合金结构的形成驱动的，当Cu存在于Pt的第一表面层时，PtCO键的显著增强可以解释这种现象。这些发现表明了选择性和动态工程合金表面用于催化的新可能性，这可能适用于一系列铜（Cu，Ag）/铂族双金属表面合金。
