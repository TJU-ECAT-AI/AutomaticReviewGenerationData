[1] "Counterintuitive to expectations and all prior observations of adsorbate-induced surface segregation of the more reactive alloy component (the one forming the stronger bond with the adsorbates), we show that CO adsorption at elevated pressures and temperatures pulls the less reactive Cu to the surface of a CuPt near-surface alloy."
[2] "The Cu surface segregation is driven by the formation of a stable self-organized CO/CuPt surface alloy structure and is rationalized in terms of the radically stronger PtCO bond when Cu is present in the first surface layer of Pt."
[3] "The results, which are expected to apply to a range of coinage (Cu, Ag)/Pt-group bimetallic surface alloys, open up new possibilities in selective and dynamical engineering of alloy surfaces for catalysis."

1.The stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems such as Pt-3d alloys, are influenced by thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions. Contrary to expectations, CO adsorption at elevated pressures and temperatures can pull the less reactive Cu to the surface of a CuPt near-surface alloy, forming a stable self-organized CO/CuPt surface alloy structure. This is due to the significantly stronger PtCO bond when Cu is present in the first surface layer of Pt. The findings suggest new possibilities for selective and dynamical engineering of alloy surfaces for catalysis, potentially applicable to a range of coinage (Cu, Ag)/Pt-group bimetallic surface alloys.

1.双金属催化剂的稳定性、表面分层和结构配置,特别是在基于Pt的系统如Pt-3d合金中,受到热力学偏好和反应条件的影响。与预期相反,在升高的压力和温度下,CO吸附可以将反应性较低的Cu拉到CuPt近表面合金的表面,形成稳定的自组织CO/CuPt表面合金结构。这是由于当Cu存在于Pt的第一表面层中时,PtCO键显著增强。这些发现表明了选择性和动态工程合金表面用于催化的新可能性,可能适用于一系列铜(铜、银)/铂族双金属表面合金。
