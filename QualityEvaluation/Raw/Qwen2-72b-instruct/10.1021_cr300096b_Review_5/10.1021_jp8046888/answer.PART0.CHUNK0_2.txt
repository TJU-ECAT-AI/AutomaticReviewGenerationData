1.The thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions significantly influence the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems such as Pt-3d alloys. The introduction of 3d metals into the Pt(111) system considerably alters the surface adsorption properties, which can be considerably modified by the 3d metals. The electronic structure of the surface Pt atoms only differs very slightly for the segregated and nonsegregated alloys. The discrepant adsorption properties are therefore mainly attributed to the direct involvement of 3d metals either on the surface or in the subsurface. The stability of Pt atoms of Pt-skin surfaces of the three alloys is enhanced with respect to those in pure Pt surfaces. Such stability enhancement is observed both in clean surfaces and under 0.25 ML of adsorbed atomic oxygen, and the degree of stability enhancement follows the opposite order of the oxygen adsorption strengths in the three studied alloys, indicating the protective role of the 3d subsurface atoms determined by their strong binding to the Pt surface layer.

1.热力学偏好和反应条件对双金属催化剂的稳定性、表面分层和结构配置有重大影响,特别是在Pt基系统如Pt-3d合金中。将3d金属引入Pt(111)系统会极大地改变表面吸附性质,这些性质可以通过3d金属进行显著修改。表面Pt原子的电子结构在分层和非分层合金之间仅略有不同。因此,不同的吸附性质主要归因于3d金属直接参与表面或次表面。三种合金的Pt皮肤表面的Pt原子的稳定性相对于纯Pt表面的Pt原子有所提高。这种稳定性增强在清洁表面和0.25 ML吸附原子氧下均被观察到,并且稳定性的增强程度遵循三种研究合金中氧吸附强度的相反顺序,表明3d次表面原子的保护作用由其与Pt表面层的强结合决定。
