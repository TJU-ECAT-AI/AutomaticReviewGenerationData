1.The thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions significantly influence the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems such as Pt-3d alloys. The introduction of 3d metals into the Pt(111) system considerably alters the surface adsorption properties, which can be considerably modified by introducing the 3d metals. The electronic structure of the surface Pt atoms only differs very slightly for the segregated and nonsegregated alloys. The discrepant adsorption properties are therefore mainly attributed to the direct involvement of 3d metals either on the surface or in the subsurface. The stability of Pt atoms of Pt-skin surfaces of the three alloys in this study is enhanced with respect to those in pure Pt surfaces. Such stability enhancement is observed both in clean surfaces and under 0.25 ML of adsorbed atomic oxygen, and the degree of stability enhancement follows the opposite order of the oxygen adsorption strengths in the three studied alloys, indicating the protective role of the 3d subsurface atoms determined by their strong binding to the Pt surface layer.

1.热力学偏好和反应条件对双金属催化剂的稳定性、表面分层和结构配置有重大影响,特别是在基于Pt的系统,如Pt-3d合金。将3d金属引入Pt(111)系统会显著改变表面吸附性能,这些性能可以通过引入3d金属而被显著改变。表面Pt原子的电子结构对于分层和非分层合金只有非常微小的差异。不同的吸附性能因此主要归因于3d金属直接参与表面或次表面。本研究中三种合金的Pt皮肤表面的Pt原子稳定性相对于纯Pt表面的Pt原子有所提高。这种稳定性增强在清洁表面和0.25 ML吸附原子氧下均被观察到,并且稳定性增强的程度遵循三种研究合金中氧吸附强度的相反顺序,表明3d次表面原子的保护作用由它们与Pt表面层的强结合决定。
