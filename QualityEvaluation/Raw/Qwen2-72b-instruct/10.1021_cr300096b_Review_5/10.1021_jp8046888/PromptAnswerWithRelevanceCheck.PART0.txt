1.The thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions significantly influence the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems such as Pt-3d alloys. The introduction of 3d metals into the Pt(111) system considerably alters the surface adsorption properties, which can be considerably modified by the 3d metals. The surface adsorption properties are determined by both the surface geometry and the electronic structure. The electronic structure of the surface Pt atoms only differs very slightly for the segregated and nonsegregated alloys. The discrepant adsorption properties are therefore mainly attributed to the direct involvement of 3d metals either on the surface or in the subsurface. The stability of Pt atoms of Pt-skin surfaces of the three alloys is enhanced with respect to those in pure Pt surfaces. Such stability enhancement is observed both in clean surfaces and under 0.25 ML of adsorbed atomic oxygen, and the degree of stability enhancement follows the opposite order of the oxygen adsorption strengths in the three studied alloys, indicating the protective role of the 3d subsurface atoms determined by their strong binding to the Pt surface layer.

1.The stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems such as Pt-3d alloys, are influenced by thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions. The presence of 3d metals in the alloys modifies the electronic and geometric properties, altering the binding strength of adsorbates. This can lead to enhanced catalytic properties and performance in various applications, such as increased oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) rate and improved electrochemical stability against dissolution. The formation of a Pt-skin layer on the surface of Pt-3d alloys, accompanied by a Pt-depleted layer underneath, is a result of surface segregation that can facilitate the removal of adsorbed species, increasing the ORR rate. The stability enhancement of Pt-skin surfaces is associated with a positive potential shift, indicating that the dissolution of Pt atoms is delayed to higher potentials. The presence of adsorbates, such as oxygen, can affect the stability of the catalysts, but Pt-skin surfaces from the alloys still show enhanced stability compared to pure Pt under adsorbate coverage.

1.双金属催化剂的稳定性、表面分层和结构配置,特别是在Pt基系统如Pt-3d合金中,受到热力学偏好和反应条件的影响。合金中3d金属的存在改变了电子和几何性质,改变了吸附物的结合强度。这可以导致各种应用中催化性能和性能的增强,例如氧还原反应(ORR)速率的增加和对溶解的电化学稳定性的提高。Pt-3d合金表面形成Pt皮肤层,伴随着下面的Pt耗尽层,是表面分层的结果,可以促进吸附物种的去除,增加ORR速率。Pt皮肤表面的稳定性增强与正电位偏移有关,表明Pt原子的溶解被延迟到更高的电位。吸附物的存在,如氧气,可能会影响催化剂的稳定性,但与纯Pt相比,在吸附物覆盖下,合金的Pt皮肤表面仍然显示出增强的稳定性。
