          [1] "For many alloys, the chemical composition at the surface is significantly different from that in the bulk. In general, one metal species enriches the surface or the first sub-surface layers over other components. The phenomenon called surface segregation has drawn much experimental and theoretical attention due to its importance to materials science and surface chemistry."
          [2] "It influences many important physical and chemical properties such as permeation, surface adsorption, crystal growth, metal corrosion, etc. Particularly, it has been found that the catalytic activities of alloys can be altered dramatically through surface segregation."
          [3] "As an efficient catalyst, Pt is used in many important chemical reactions such as methanol oxidation and hydrocarbon reforming. In particular, Pt has become the most widely used electrocatalyst for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in fuel cells."
          [4] "For many years, numerous efforts to search alternative catalysts to Pt have mainly focused on Pt-based bimetallic alloys, in which some of the platinum is replaced by less expensive metals."
          [5] "Since the catalytic properties are chiefly determined by the surface geometry and the electronic structure which can be modified by the chemical composition of the bimetallic alloys, the catalytic effect can be considerably improved when appropriate structures are achieved."
          [6] "Enhanced ORR activities have been reported in the case of Pt alloyed with 3d metals."
          [7] "Notably, surface segregation plays a key role in the ORR."
          [8] "For instance, Stamenkovic et al. compared the kinetics of the ORR on bulk Pt3Co alloy and on the Pt-skin structure produced by Pt segregating on the outmost layer of the annealed alloy surface. They noted that the ORR is uniquely active on the Pt-skin surface and the reaction rate is 4 times that for the pure Pt catalyst."
          [9] "Theoretical approaches can help to elucidate the driving force and the tendency of this phenomenon."
          [10] "In this paper, we chose the well-investigated Pt3M(1 1 1) (M = Ag, Au, Co, Cr, Cu, Fe, Ir, Mn, Mo, Ni, Pd, Re, Rh, Ru, Ti, V) alloy systems."
          [11] "Our calculations show that surface segregation is determined not only by atomic size and magnitude of the surface energy but also by the subsurface atomic structure."
          [12] "Notably, we have found that a correlation between the Pt surface segregation trend and the displacement of the metal M out of the alloy surface. Such displacement can effectively predict surface segregation regardless of the subsurface segregation structures."
          [13] "The interlayer distance is also found to be correlated with the segregation energy."
          [14] "Furthermore, this study reveals that the surface geometry is not responsible for the enhanced ORR activity of the Pt-skin surfaces for Pt3Ni(1 1 1) and Pt3Co(1 1 1); instead the modified electronic structure should plays a key role for the catalytic reactions."
          [1] "For many alloys, the chemical composition at the surface is significantly different from that in the bulk. In general, one metal species enriches the surface or the first sub-surface layers over other components.

They noted that the ORR is uniquely active on the Pt-skin surface and the reaction rate is 4 times that for the pure Pt catalyst."
          [9] "The enhanced activities can be attributed to two critical factors: the surface electronic structure and the surface bond length of alloy systems."
          [10] "The surface geometry has been argued to be able to considerably alter the catalytic efficiency."
          [11] "For each non-segregated alloy, the surface metal bond length varies narrowly (up to 0.12 Å)."
          [12] "The surface geometry for the Pt-segregated structures is found to be close to the non-segregated geometry, although the M atoms are all replaced by Pt atoms."
          [13] "For the well-studied Pt3Co (1 1 1) and Pt3Ni (1 1 1) systems, the maximum deviation of the surface bond length is only 0.002 Å after Pt segregation."
          [14] "Therefore, the geometric effect does not contribute to the enhanced ORR activities of Pt-skin surfaces; instead the electronic structures modified through surface segregation should be the main factor for such enhancement."

          The stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems such as Pt-3d alloys, are influenced by thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions. Surface segregation, where one metal species enriches the surface or the first sub-surface layers over other components, has significant implications for materials science and surface chemistry. It affects physical and chemical properties such as permeation, surface adsorption, crystal growth, and metal corrosion. Notably, the catalytic activities of alloys can be dramatically altered through surface segregation. Pt, an efficient catalyst used in important chemical reactions like methanol oxidation and hydrocarbon reforming, is the most widely used electrocatalyst for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in fuel cells. Efforts to find alternative catalysts to Pt have focused on Pt-based bimetallic alloys, where some platinum is replaced by less expensive metals. The catalytic properties of these alloys are determined by the surface geometry and electronic structure, which can be modified by the chemical composition, leading to improved catalytic effects when appropriate structures are achieved. Enhanced ORR activities have been observed in Pt alloys with 3d metals, with surface segregation playing a key role. For example, Stamenkovic et al. found that the ORR on Pt-skin structures produced by Pt segregating on the surface of annealed Pt3Co alloys is uniquely active, with a reaction rate four times that of pure Pt. The enhanced activities can be attributed to the surface electronic structure and surface bond length of alloy systems. The surface geometry can considerably alter catalytic efficiency, but for Pt3Co (1 1 1) and Pt3Ni (1 1 1) systems, the maximum deviation of the surface bond length after Pt segregation is only 0.002 Å, indicating that the geometric effect does not contribute to the enhanced ORR activities of Pt-skin surfaces. Instead, the electronic structures modified through surface segregation are the main factor for such enhancement. Theoretical approaches can help to elucidate the driving force and the tendency of this phenomenon. Surface segregation is also governed by temperature and by the presence of adsorbates.

          二元合金，特别是基于Pt的系统（如Pt-3d合金）的稳定性，表面分层和结构配置受热力学偏好和反应条件的影响。一种金属物种在表面或第一亚表面层上富集其他成分的现象称为表面分层，由于其对材料科学和表面化学的重要性，引起了实验和理论的广泛关注。它影响许多重要的物理和化学性质，如渗透，表面吸附，晶体生长，金属腐蚀等。特别是，已经发现合金的催化活性可以通过表面分层发生巨大变化。Pt被用作许多重要化学反应（如甲醇氧化和碳氢化合物重整）的有效催化剂，特别是在燃料电池中，Pt已成为氧还原反应（ORR）中最广泛使用的电催化剂。多年来，寻找Pt替代催化剂的主要集中在基于Pt的二元合金上，其中一些铂被更便宜的金属取代。由于二元合金的催化性质主要由表面几何形状和电子结构决定，可以通过合金的化学组成进行修改，因此当实现适当的结构时，催化效果可以大大改善。在Pt与3d金属合金化的情况下，报告了增强的ORR活性。值得注意的是，表面分层在ORR中起着关键作用。例如，Stamenkovic等人比较了块状Pt3Co合金和Pt在退火合金表面最外层分层产生的Pt-皮肤结构上的ORR动力学。他们注意到ORR在Pt-皮肤表面上是独特的活性，反应速率是纯Pt催化剂的4倍。增强的活性可归因于两个关键因素：合金系统的表面电子结构和表面键长。表面几何形状被认为能够显著改变催化效率。对于每个非分层合金，表面金属键长的变化范围很窄（最多0.12 Å）。对于Pt分层结构，发现表面几何形状接近非分层几何形状，尽管所有的M原子都被Pt原子取代。对于研究得很好的Pt3Co(1 1 1)和Pt3Ni(1 1 1)系统，在Pt分层后，表面键长的最大偏差仅为0.002 Å。因此，几何效应不会导致Pt-皮肤表面增强的ORR活性;相反，通过表面分层修改的电子结构应该是这种增强的主要因素。理论方法有助于阐明这种现象的驱动力和趋势。表面分层也受温度和吸附物的存在控制。
