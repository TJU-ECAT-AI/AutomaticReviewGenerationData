These structures are desirable in heterogeneous catalysis and electrocatalysis. DFT predictions indicate that these structures are stable in vacuum and with adsorbed hydrogen, but with adsorbed oxygen, the 3d atoms should segregate to the surface.

The PtNiPt system is the most resistant to oxygen-induced segregation, while the PtTiPt configuration is the most susceptible. The stability of these structures in vacuum and with adsorbed hydrogen and oxygen has been demonstrated through DFT calculations and experimental verification on both single crystal Pt(111) and polycrystalline Pt foil. Using combined theoretical and experimental approaches, the relative stability of surface and subsurface bimetallic structures can be quantified and general trends predicted.

Platinum is a popular cathode electrocatalyst in PEM fuel cells, but its slow kinetics for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) limits catalytic efficiency. In recent years, Pt-based alloys, which include Pt and other transition metals, have been extensively studied due to their enhanced ORR activity. Surface segregation plays a key role in this process, leading to the formation of a pure Pt-skin in the outermost layer of the alloys. This surface segregation is closely related to the enhanced stability of Pt-based catalysts. Au shows strong surface segregation in PtAu alloys, whereas Co is usually unable to enrich PtCo alloy surfaces. The process of Au segregating from the second layer to the surface is exothermic, indicating that Au surface segregation is thermodynamically favorable. However, for the PtCo alloy, the surface Co atoms have a stronger tendency to migrate to the second layer, making the continuous segregation of Co unlikely. Therefore, Co segregating to the clean Pt(111) surface is both thermodynamically unfavorable and kinetically prohibitive. Surface segregation has been found to play a key role in the process of Pt-based alloys. For instance, Stamenkovic et al. found that the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is uniquely active on Pt-skin surfaces, and the reaction rate is four times that of the pure Pt catalyst.

The phenomenon can also be observed in acidic solution, often with dissolution of the alloyed metal and rearrangement of Pt atoms. The segregation process includes interlayer migration of the impurity atom, vacancy movement at the second layer, and vacancy regeneration at the surface layer. The segregation model can successfully interpret these phenomena, particularly from a kinetics viewpoint.

The introduction of 3d metals into the Pt(111) system considerably alters the surface adsorption properties, which can be considerably modified by the 3d metals. The electronic structure of the surface Pt atoms only differs very slightly for the segregated and nonsegregated alloys. The discrepant adsorption properties are therefore mainly attributed to the direct involvement of 3d metals either on the surface or in the subsurface. The stability of Pt atoms of Pt-skin surfaces of the three alloys is enhanced with respect to those in pure Pt surfaces. Such stability enhancement is observed both in clean surfaces and under 0.25 ML of adsorbed atomic oxygen, and the degree of stability enhancement follows the opposite order of the oxygen adsorption strengths in the three studied alloys, indicating the protective role of the 3d subsurface atoms determined by their strong binding to the Pt surface layer. The presence of 3d metals in the alloys modifies the electronic and geometric properties, altering the binding strength of adsorbates. This can lead to enhanced catalytic properties and performance in various applications, such as increased oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) rate and improved electrochemical stability against dissolution. The formation of a Pt-skin layer on the surface of Pt-3d alloys, accompanied by a Pt-depleted layer underneath, is a result of surface segregation that can facilitate the removal of adsorbed species, increasing the ORR rate.

Surface segregation, where one metal species enriches the surface or the first sub-surface layers over other components, has significant implications for materials science and surface chemistry. It affects physical and chemical properties such as permeation, surface adsorption, crystal growth, and metal corrosion. Notably, the catalytic activities of alloys can be dramatically altered through surface segregation. Pt, an efficient catalyst used in important chemical reactions like methanol oxidation and hydrocarbon reforming, is the most widely used electrocatalyst for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in fuel cells. Efforts to find alternative catalysts to Pt have focused on Pt-based bimetallic alloys, where some platinum is replaced by less expensive metals. The catalytic properties of these alloys are determined by the surface geometry and electronic structure, which can be modified by the chemical composition, leading to improved catalytic effects when appropriate structures are achieved. Enhanced ORR activities have been observed in Pt alloys with 3d metals, with surface segregation playing a key role. For example, Stamenkovic et al. found that the ORR on Pt-skin structures produced by Pt segregating on the surface of annealed Pt3Co alloys is uniquely active, with a reaction rate four times that of pure Pt. The enhanced activities can be attributed to the surface electronic structure and surface bond length of alloy systems. The surface geometry can considerably alter catalytic efficiency, but for Pt3Co (1 1 1) and Pt3Ni (1 1 1) systems, the maximum deviation of the surface bond length after Pt segregation is only 0.002 Å, indicating that the geometric effect does not contribute to the enhanced ORR activities of Pt-skin surfaces. Instead, the electronic structures modified through surface segregation are the main factor for such enhancement. Theoretical approaches can help to elucidate the driving force and the tendency of this phenomenon. Surface segregation is also governed by temperature and by the presence of adsorbates.", "Doi": "10.1016/j.susc.2007.09.052"},

Alloys are generally less stable than pure Pt at the same oxygen coverage. Maintaining zero oxygen coverage at working potentials is crucial for achieving both high activity and stability. The stability of clean alloy surfaces can be inferred from the calculated Pt d-band structure, which shows that alloying generally leads to the stabilization of the Pt d-band, making surface Pt atoms more difficult to segregate or dissolve. However, in the presence of adsorbed O atoms, the removal of Pt is facilitated because the surface vacancy can be more strongly stabilized by O atoms. This is due to the fact that Pt atoms at the surface vacancy are less coordinated and possess more active d-states, which can more strongly bond with O atoms compared to terrace Pt atoms. Additionally, with the exposure of the second layer atoms at the surface vacancy, it is possible to form a much stronger OM bond compared to the OPt bond. This is observed in the search for the optimum structure after a Pt removal, which shows that the surface vacancy is preferentially terminated by O atoms that sink to bond with the solute M atoms at the second layer. For example, in Pt2Ti skin alloys, the surface vacancies with a configuration containing OTi bonding are much more stable than those with only OPt bonding. This is consistent with the fact that atomic O on metals is anion-like, with a strong tendency to accept electrons, and prefers to form ionic-bonds. The stability of Pt alloys under electrochemical conditions is generally lower than that of pure Pt when the oxygen coverage is the same, and maintaining zero oxygen coverage at working potentials (such as 0.9 V) is crucial for achieving both high activity and stability. Among more than 20 different Pt2M alloys, molybdenum (Mo) is identified as a good element that can alloy with Pt to form a stable surface at high electrochemical potentials. Pt2Mo has a lower kinetic barrier for oxygen reduction (OR) compared to Pt, and the barrier to OOH dissociation is a key kinetic parameter for OR activity. The higher stability of clean alloy surfaces can indeed be inferred from the calculated Pt d-band structure, which shows that alloying generally leads to the stabilization of the Pt d-band, making surface Pt atoms more difficult to segregate or dissolve. The stability of surfaces follows the order Pt2Mo > Pt > Pt2Ag > Pt2Pd > Pt2Nb > Pt2Ti > Pt2Sc > Pt2Zr, and only Pt2Mo exhibits higher stability than pure Pt at high potential (1.05 V). The oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) on a Pt2Mo alloy surface follows a similar reaction profile as on Pt, with the transition state (TS) for OOH dissociation determining the height of the potential profile. The TSs for OOH dissociation and O2 dissociation dictate the highest free energy positions in the reaction pathways. The aqueous environment, together with the in situ oxygen coverage, plays an important role in facilitating the ORR on alloy surfaces. The stability of PtxMo alloys drops quickly with increasing potential, in line with the rapid increase of surface oxygen coverage for PtxMo surfaces above 0.9 V. The Pt2Mo skin alloy achieves the best balance of stability and activity. A low Mo content (below 30%, e.g., Pt5Mo) may achieve a higher stability at high potentials, but the activity is not better than Pt at 0.9 V, while a high Mo content (above 30%, e.g., PtMo) will start to destabilize the alloy and also reduce the activity.", "Doi": "10.1039/c0ee00762e"},

The interdiffusion of Cu and Pt becomes significant at 460 K, and the formation and breakup of the stable CO-induced surface alloy start to occur at this temperature. The DFT calculations reproduce the experimental observations and confirm the rationalization of the observed Cu surface segregation.

In contrast, CO oxidation does not occur at the cluster surfaces that are initially pure Au, presumably because the first step in the oxidation process is O2 dissociation, which requires neighboring Pt sites. These factors have consequent implications for the catalytic properties and performance of bimetallic catalysts in various applications.", "Doi": "10.1021/jp108939h"},

Platinum is a popular cathode electrocatalyst in PEM fuel cells, but its slow kinetics for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) limits catalytic efficiency. In recent years, Pt-based alloys, which include Pt and other transition metals, have been extensively studied due to their enhanced ORR activity. Surface segregation plays a key role in this process, leading to the formation of a pure Pt-skin in the outermost layer of the alloys. This surface segregation is closely related to the enhanced stability of Pt-based catalysts. Au shows strong surface segregation in PtAu alloys, whereas Co is usually unable to enrich PtCo alloy surfaces. The process of Au segregating from the second layer to the surface is exothermic, indicating that Au surface segregation is thermodynamically favorable. However, for the PtCo alloy, the surface Co atoms have a stronger tendency to migrate to the second layer, making the continuous segregation of Co unlikely. Therefore, Co segregating to the clean Pt(111) surface is both thermodynamically unfavorable and kinetically prohibitive. Surface segregation has been found to play a key role in the process of Pt-based alloys.

The electronic structure of the surface Pt atoms only differs very slightly for the segregated and nonsegregated alloys. The discrepant adsorption properties are therefore mainly attributed to the direct involvement of 3d metals either on the surface or in the subsurface. The stability of Pt atoms of Pt-skin surfaces of the three alloys is enhanced with respect to those in pure Pt surfaces. Such stability enhancement is observed both in clean surfaces and under 0.25 ML of adsorbed atomic oxygen, and the degree of stability enhancement follows the opposite order of the oxygen adsorption strengths in the three studied alloys, indicating the protective role of the 3d subsurface atoms determined by their strong binding to the Pt surface layer.

Surface segregation, where one metal species enriches the surface or the first sub-surface layers over other components, has significant implications for materials science and surface chemistry. It affects physical and chemical properties such as permeation, surface adsorption, crystal growth, and metal corrosion. Notably, the catalytic activities of alloys can be dramatically altered through surface segregation. Pt, an efficient catalyst used in important chemical reactions like methanol oxidation and hydrocarbon reforming, is the most widely used electrocatalyst for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in fuel cells. Efforts to find alternative catalysts to Pt have focused on Pt-based bimetallic alloys, where some platinum is replaced by less expensive metals. The catalytic properties of these alloys are determined by the surface geometry and electronic structure, which can be modified by the chemical composition, leading to improved catalytic effects when appropriate structures are achieved. Enhanced ORR activities have been observed in Pt alloys with 3d metals, with surface segregation playing a key role. For example, Stamenkovic et al. found that the ORR on Pt-skin structures produced by Pt segregating on the surface of annealed Pt3Co alloys is uniquely active, with a reaction rate four times that of pure Pt. The enhanced activities can be attributed to the surface electronic structure and surface bond length of alloy systems. The surface geometry can considerably alter catalytic efficiency, but for Pt3Co (1 1 1) and Pt3Ni (1 1 1) systems, the maximum deviation of the surface bond length after Pt segregation is only 0.002 Å, indicating that the geometric effect does not contribute to the enhanced ORR activities of Pt-skin surfaces. Instead, the electronic structures modified through surface segregation are the main factor for such enhancement. Theoretical approaches can help to elucidate the driving force and the tendency of this phenomenon. Surface segregation is also governed by temperature and by the presence of adsorbates.", "Doi": "10.1016/j.susc.2007.09.052"},

Alloys are generally less stable than pure Pt at the same oxygen coverage. Maintaining zero oxygen coverage at working potentials is crucial for achieving both high activity and stability. The stability of clean alloy surfaces can be inferred from the calculated Pt d-band structure, which shows that alloying generally leads to the stabilization of the Pt d-band, making surface Pt atoms more difficult to segregate or dissolve. However, in the presence of adsorbed O atoms, the removal of Pt is facilitated because the surface vacancy can be more strongly stabilized by O atoms. This is due to the fact that Pt atoms at the surface vacancy are less coordinated and possess more active d-states, which can more strongly bond with O atoms compared to terrace Pt atoms. Additionally, with the exposure of the second layer atoms at the surface vacancy, it is possible to form a much stronger OM bond compared to the OPt bond. This is observed in the search for the optimum structure after a Pt removal, which shows that the surface vacancy is preferentially terminated by O atoms that sink to bond with the solute M atoms at the second layer. For example, in Pt2Ti skin alloys, the surface vacancies with a configuration containing OTi bonding are much more stable than those with only OPt bonding. This is consistent with the fact that atomic O on metals is anion-like, with a strong tendency to accept electrons, and prefers to form ionic-bonds. The stability of Pt alloys under electrochemical conditions is generally lower than that of pure Pt when the oxygen coverage is the same, and maintaining zero oxygen coverage at working potentials (such as 0.9 V) is crucial for achieving both high activity and stability. Among more than 20 different Pt2M alloys, molybdenum (Mo) is identified as a good element that can alloy with Pt to form a stable surface at high electrochemical potentials. Pt2Mo has a lower kinetic barrier for oxygen reduction (OR) compared to Pt, and the barrier to OOH dissociation is a key kinetic parameter for OR activity. The higher stability of clean alloy surfaces can indeed be inferred from the calculated Pt d-band structure, which shows that alloying generally leads to the stabilization of the Pt d-band, making surface Pt atoms more difficult to segregate or dissolve. The stability of surfaces follows the order Pt2Mo > Pt > Pt2Ag > Pt2Pd > Pt2Nb > Pt2Ti > Pt2Sc > Pt2Zr, and only Pt2Mo exhibits higher stability than pure Pt at high potential (1.05 V). The oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) on a Pt2Mo alloy surface follows a similar reaction profile as on Pt, with the transition state (TS) for OOH dissociation determining the height of the potential profile. The TSs for OOH dissociation and O2 dissociation dictate the highest free energy positions in the reaction pathways. The aqueous environment, together with the in situ oxygen coverage, plays an important role in facilitating the ORR on alloy surfaces. The stability of PtxMo alloys drops quickly with increasing potential, in line with the rapid increase of surface oxygen coverage for PtxMo surfaces above 0.9 V. The Pt2Mo skin alloy achieves the best balance of stability and activity. A low Mo content (below 30%, e.g., Pt5Mo) may achieve a higher stability at high potentials, but the activity is not better than Pt at 0.9 V, while a high Mo content (above 30%, e.g., PtMo) will start to destabilize the alloy and also reduce the activity.", "Doi": "10.1039/c0ee00762e"},

The calculated higher stability of the CuPt SA compared with Cu in the bulk with CO adsorption on clean Pt(111) is nearly equal to the free-energy difference (ΔG). The interdiffusion of Cu and Pt becomes significant at 460 K, and the formation and breakup of the stable CO-induced surface alloy start to occur at this temperature. The DFT calculations reproduce the experimental observations and confirm the rationalization of the observed Cu surface segregation.

Since this process requires more than one contiguous Pt site, it is not surprising that O2 dissociation cannot occur on the PtAu clusters that are 100% Au at the surface before CO exposure, given the low probability for ensembles of Pt sites to form at the surface. In contrast, CO oxidation does not occur at the cluster surfaces that are initially pure Au, presumably because the first step in the oxidation process is O2 dissociation, which requires neighboring Pt sites. These factors have consequent implications for the catalytic properties and performance of bimetallic catalysts in various applications.", "Doi": "10.1021/jp108939h"},

Platinum is a popular cathode electrocatalyst in PEM fuel cells, but its slow kinetics for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) limits catalytic efficiency. In recent years, Pt-based alloys, which include Pt and other transition metals, have been extensively studied due to their enhanced ORR activity. Surface segregation plays a key role in this process, leading to the formation of a pure Pt-skin in the outermost layer of the alloys. This surface segregation is closely related to the enhanced stability of Pt-based catalysts. Au shows strong surface segregation in PtAu alloys, whereas Co is usually unable to enrich PtCo alloy surfaces. The process of Au segregating from the second layer to the surface is exothermic, indicating that Au surface segregation is thermodynamically favorable. However, for the PtCo alloy, the surface Co atoms have a stronger tendency to migrate to the second layer, making the continuous segregation of Co unlikely. Therefore, Co segregating to the clean Pt(111) surface is both thermodynamically unfavorable and kinetically prohibitive. Surface segregation has been found to play a key role in the process of Pt-based alloys.

The electronic structure of the surface Pt atoms only differs very slightly for the segregated and nonsegregated alloys. The discrepant adsorption properties are therefore mainly attributed to the direct involvement of 3d metals either on the surface or in the subsurface. The stability of Pt atoms of Pt-skin surfaces of the three alloys is enhanced with respect to those in pure Pt surfaces. Such stability enhancement is observed both in clean surfaces and under 0.25 ML of adsorbed atomic oxygen, and the degree of stability enhancement follows the opposite order of the oxygen adsorption strengths in the three studied alloys, indicating the protective role of the 3d subsurface atoms determined by their strong binding to the Pt surface layer.

Surface segregation, where one metal species enriches the surface or the first sub-surface layers over other components, has significant implications for materials science and surface chemistry. It affects physical and chemical properties such as permeation, surface adsorption, crystal growth, and metal corrosion. Notably, the catalytic activities of alloys can be dramatically altered through surface segregation. Pt, an efficient catalyst used in important chemical reactions like methanol oxidation and hydrocarbon reforming, is the most widely used electrocatalyst for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in fuel cells. Efforts to find alternative catalysts to Pt have focused on Pt-based bimetallic alloys, where some platinum is replaced by less expensive metals. The catalytic properties of these alloys are determined by the surface geometry and electronic structure, which can be modified by the chemical composition, leading to improved catalytic effects when appropriate structures are achieved. Enhanced ORR activities have been observed in Pt alloys with 3d metals, with surface segregation playing a key role. For example, Stamenkovic et al. found that the ORR on Pt-skin structures produced by Pt segregating on the surface of annealed Pt3Co alloys is uniquely active, with a reaction rate four times that of pure Pt. The enhanced activities can be attributed to the surface electronic structure and surface bond length of alloy systems. The surface geometry can considerably alter catalytic efficiency, but for Pt3Co (1 1 1) and Pt3Ni (1 1 1) systems, the maximum deviation of the surface bond length after Pt segregation is only 0.002 Å, indicating that the geometric effect does not contribute to the enhanced ORR activities of Pt-skin surfaces. Instead, the electronic structures modified through surface segregation are the main factor for such enhancement. Theoretical approaches can help to elucidate the driving force and the tendency of this phenomenon. Surface segregation is also governed by temperature and by the presence of adsorbates.", "Doi": "10.1016/j.susc.2007.09.052"},

Alloys are generally less stable than pure Pt at the same oxygen coverage. Maintaining zero oxygen coverage at working potentials is crucial for achieving both high activity and stability. The stability of clean alloy surfaces can be inferred from the calculated Pt d-band structure, which shows that alloying generally leads to the stabilization of the Pt d-band, making surface Pt atoms more difficult to segregate or dissolve. However, in the presence of adsorbed O atoms, the removal of Pt is facilitated because the surface vacancy can be more strongly stabilized by O atoms. This is due to the fact that Pt atoms at the surface vacancy are less coordinated and possess more active d-states, which can more strongly bond with O atoms compared to terrace Pt atoms. Additionally, with the exposure of the second layer atoms at the surface vacancy, it is possible to form a much stronger OM bond compared to the OPt bond. This is observed in the search for the optimum structure after a Pt removal, which shows that the surface vacancy is preferentially terminated by O atoms that sink to bond with the solute M atoms at the second layer. For example, in Pt2Ti skin alloys, the surface vacancies with a configuration containing OTi bonding are much more stable than those with only OPt bonding. This is consistent with the fact that atomic O on metals is anion-like, with a strong tendency to accept electrons, and prefers to form ionic-bonds. The stability of Pt alloys under electrochemical conditions is generally lower than that of pure Pt when the oxygen coverage is the same, and maintaining zero oxygen coverage at working potentials (such as 0.9 V) is crucial for achieving both high activity and stability. Among more than 20 different Pt2M alloys, molybdenum (Mo) is identified as a good element that can alloy with Pt to form a stable surface at high electrochemical potentials. Pt2Mo has a lower kinetic barrier for oxygen reduction (OR) compared to Pt, and the barrier to OOH dissociation is a key kinetic parameter for OR activity. The higher stability of clean alloy surfaces can indeed be inferred from the calculated Pt d-band structure, which shows that alloying generally leads to the stabilization of the Pt d-band, making surface Pt atoms more difficult to segregate or dissolve. The stability of surfaces follows the order Pt2Mo > Pt > Pt2Ag > Pt2Pd > Pt2Nb > Pt2Ti > Pt2Sc > Pt2Zr, and only Pt2Mo exhibits higher stability than pure Pt at high potential (1.05 V). The oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) on a Pt2Mo alloy surface follows a similar reaction profile as on Pt, with the transition state (TS) for OOH dissociation determining the height of the potential profile. The TSs for OOH dissociation and O2 dissociation dictate the highest free energy positions in the reaction pathways. The aqueous environment, together with the in situ oxygen coverage, plays an important role in facilitating the ORR on alloy surfaces. The stability of PtxMo alloys drops quickly with increasing potential, in line with the rapid increase of surface oxygen coverage for PtxMo surfaces above 0.9 V. The Pt2Mo skin alloy achieves the best balance of stability and activity. A low Mo content (below 30%, e.g., Pt5Mo) may achieve a higher stability at high potentials, but the activity is not better than Pt at 0.9 V, while a high Mo content (above 30%, e.g., PtMo) will start to destabilize the alloy and also reduce the activity.", "Doi": "10.1039/c0ee00762e"},

The calculated higher stability of the CuPt SA compared with Cu in the bulk with CO adsorption on clean Pt(111) is nearly equal to the free-energy difference (ΔG). The interdiffusion of Cu and Pt becomes significant at 460 K, and the formation and breakup of the stable CO-induced surface alloy start to occur at this temperature. The DFT calculations reproduce the experimental observations and confirm the rationalization of the observed Cu surface segregation.

Since this process requires more than one contiguous Pt site, it is not surprising that O2 dissociation cannot occur on the PtAu clusters that are 100% Au at the surface before CO exposure, given the low probability for ensembles of Pt sites to form at the surface. In contrast, CO oxidation does not occur at the cluster surfaces that are initially pure Au, presumably because the first step in the oxidation process is O2 dissociation, which requires neighboring Pt sites. These factors have consequent implications for the catalytic properties and performance of bimetallic catalysts in various applications.", "Doi": "10.1021/jp108939h"},

Platinum is a popular cathode electrocatalyst in PEM fuel cells, but its slow kinetics for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) limits catalytic efficiency. In recent years, Pt-based alloys, which include Pt and other transition metals, have been extensively studied due to their enhanced ORR activity. Surface segregation plays a key role in this process, leading to the formation of a pure Pt-skin in the outermost layer of the alloys. This surface segregation is closely related to the enhanced stability of Pt-based catalysts. Au shows strong surface segregation in PtAu alloys, whereas Co is usually unable to enrich PtCo alloy surfaces. The process of Au segregating from the second layer to the surface is exothermic, indicating that Au surface segregation is thermodynamically favorable. However, for the PtCo alloy, the surface Co atoms have a stronger tendency to migrate to the second layer, making the continuous segregation of Co unlikely. Therefore, Co segregating to the clean Pt(111) surface is both thermodynamically unfavorable and kinetically prohibitive. Surface segregation has been found to play a key role in the process of Pt-based alloys.

The electronic structure of the surface Pt atoms only differs very slightly for the segregated and nonsegregated alloys. The discrepant adsorption properties are therefore mainly attributed to the direct involvement of 3d metals either on the surface or in the subsurface. The stability of Pt atoms of Pt-skin surfaces of the three alloys is enhanced with respect to those in pure Pt surfaces. Such stability enhancement is observed both in clean surfaces and under 0.25 ML of adsorbed atomic oxygen, and the degree of stability enhancement follows the opposite order of the oxygen adsorption strengths in the three studied alloys, indicating the protective role of the 3d subsurface atoms determined by their strong binding to the Pt surface layer.

Surface segregation, where one metal species enriches the surface or the first sub-surface layers over other components, has significant implications for materials science and surface chemistry. It affects physical and chemical properties such as permeation, surface adsorption, crystal growth, and metal corrosion. Notably, the catalytic activities of alloys can be dramatically altered through surface segregation. Pt, an efficient catalyst used in important chemical reactions like methanol oxidation and hydrocarbon reforming, is the most widely used electrocatalyst for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in fuel cells. Efforts to find alternative catalysts to Pt have focused on Pt-based bimetallic alloys, where some platinum is replaced by less expensive metals. The catalytic properties of these alloys are determined by the surface geometry and electronic structure, which can be modified by the chemical composition, leading to improved catalytic effects when appropriate structures are achieved. Enhanced ORR activities have been observed in Pt alloys with 3d metals, with surface segregation playing a key role. For example, Stamenkovic et al. found that the ORR on Pt-skin structures produced by Pt segregating on the surface of annealed Pt3Co alloys is uniquely active, with a reaction rate four times that of pure Pt. The enhanced activities can be attributed to the surface electronic structure and surface bond length of alloy systems. The surface geometry can considerably alter catalytic efficiency, but for Pt3Co (1 1 1) and Pt3Ni (1 1 1) systems, the maximum deviation of the surface bond length after Pt segregation is only 0.002 Å, indicating that the geometric effect does not contribute to the enhanced ORR activities of Pt-skin surfaces. Instead, the electronic structures modified through surface segregation are the main factor for such enhancement. Theoretical approaches can help to elucidate the driving force and the tendency of this phenomenon. Surface segregation is also governed by temperature and by the presence of adsorbates.", "Doi": "10.1016/j.susc.2007.09.052"},

Alloys are generally less stable than pure Pt at the same oxygen coverage. Maintaining zero oxygen coverage at working potentials is crucial for achieving both high activity and stability. The stability of clean alloy surfaces can be inferred from the calculated Pt d-band structure, which shows that alloying generally leads to the stabilization of the Pt d-band, making surface Pt atoms more difficult to segregate or dissolve. However, in the presence of adsorbed O atoms, the removal of Pt is facilitated because the surface vacancy can be more strongly stabilized by O atoms. This is due to the fact that Pt atoms at the surface vacancy are less coordinated and possess more active d-states, which can more strongly bond with O atoms compared to terrace Pt atoms. Additionally, with the exposure of the second layer atoms at the surface vacancy, it is possible to form a much stronger OM bond compared to the OPt bond. This is observed in the search for the optimum structure after a Pt removal, which shows that the surface vacancy is preferentially terminated by O atoms that sink to bond with the solute M atoms at the second layer. For example, in Pt2Ti skin alloys, the surface vacancies with a configuration containing OTi bonding are much more stable than those with only OPt bonding. This is consistent with the fact that atomic O on metals is anion-like, with a strong tendency to accept electrons, and prefers to form ionic-bonds. The stability of Pt alloys under electrochemical conditions is generally lower than that of pure Pt when the oxygen coverage is the same, and maintaining zero oxygen coverage at working potentials (such as 0.9 V) is crucial for achieving both high activity and stability. Among more than 20 different Pt2M alloys, molybdenum (Mo) is identified as a good element that can alloy with Pt to form a stable surface at high electrochemical potentials. Pt2Mo has a lower kinetic barrier for oxygen reduction (OR) compared to Pt, and the barrier to OOH dissociation is a key kinetic parameter for OR activity. The higher stability of clean alloy surfaces can indeed be inferred from the calculated Pt d-band structure, which shows that alloying generally leads to the stabilization of the Pt d-band, making surface Pt atoms more difficult to segregate or dissolve. The stability of surfaces follows the order Pt2Mo > Pt > Pt2Ag > Pt2Pd > Pt2Nb > Pt2Ti > Pt2Sc > Pt2Zr, and only Pt2Mo exhibits higher stability than pure Pt at high potential (1.05 V). The oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) on a Pt2Mo alloy surface follows a similar reaction profile as on Pt, with the transition state (TS) for OOH dissociation determining the height of the potential profile. The TSs for OOH dissociation and O2 dissociation dictate the highest free energy positions in the reaction pathways. The aqueous environment, together with the in situ oxygen coverage, plays an important role in facilitating the ORR on alloy surfaces. The stability of PtxMo alloys drops quickly with increasing potential, in line with the rapid increase of surface oxygen coverage for PtxMo surfaces above 0.9 V. The Pt2Mo skin alloy achieves the best balance of stability and activity. A low Mo content (below 30%, e.g., Pt5Mo) may achieve a higher stability at high potentials, but the activity is not better than Pt at 0.9 V, while a high Mo content (above 30%, e.g., PtMo) will start to destabilize the alloy and also reduce the activity.", "Doi": "10.1039/c0ee00762e"},

The calculated higher stability of the CuPt SA compared with Cu in the bulk with CO adsorption on clean Pt(111) is nearly equal to the free-energy difference (ΔG). The interdiffusion of Cu and Pt becomes significant at 460 K, and the formation and breakup of the stable CO-induced surface alloy start to occur at this temperature. The DFT calculations reproduce the experimental observations and confirm the rationalization of the observed Cu surface segregation.

Since this process requires more than one contiguous Pt site, it is not surprising that O2 dissociation cannot occur on the PtAu clusters that are 100% Au at the surface before CO exposure, given the low probability for ensembles of Pt sites to form at the surface. In contrast, CO oxidation does not occur at the cluster surfaces that are initially pure Au, presumably because the first step in the oxidation process is O2 dissociation, which requires neighboring Pt sites. These factors have consequent implications for the catalytic properties and performance of bimetallic catalysts in various applications.", "Doi": "10.1021/jp108939h"},

Platinum is a popular cathode electrocatalyst in PEM fuel cells, but its slow kinetics for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) limits catalytic efficiency. In recent years, Pt-based alloys, which include Pt and other transition metals, have been extensively studied due to their enhanced ORR activity. Surface segregation plays a key role in this process, leading to the formation of a pure Pt-skin in the outermost layer of the alloys. This surface segregation is closely related to the enhanced stability of Pt-based catalysts. Au shows strong surface segregation in PtAu alloys, whereas Co is usually unable to enrich PtCo alloy surfaces. The process of Au segregating from the second layer to the surface is exothermic, indicating that Au surface segregation is thermodynamically favorable. However, for the PtCo alloy, the surface Co atoms have a stronger tendency to migrate to the second layer, making the continuous segregation of Co unlikely. Therefore, Co segregating to the clean Pt(111) surface is both thermodynamically unfavorable and kinetically prohibitive. Surface segregation has been found to play a key role in the process of Pt-based alloys.

The electronic structure of the surface Pt atoms only differs very slightly for the segregated and nonsegregated alloys. The discrepant adsorption properties are therefore mainly attributed to the direct involvement of 3d metals either on the surface or in the subsurface. The stability of Pt atoms of Pt-skin surfaces of the three alloys is enhanced with respect to those in pure Pt surfaces. Such stability enhancement is observed both in clean surfaces and under 0.25 ML of adsorbed atomic oxygen, and the degree of stability enhancement follows the opposite order of the oxygen adsorption strengths in the three studied alloys, indicating the protective role of the 3d subsurface atoms determined by their strong binding to the Pt surface layer.

Surface segregation, where one metal species enriches the surface or the first sub-surface layers over other components, has significant implications for materials science and surface chemistry. It affects physical and chemical properties such as permeation, surface adsorption, crystal growth, and metal corrosion. Notably, the catalytic activities of alloys can be dramatically altered through surface segregation. Pt, an efficient catalyst used in important chemical reactions like methanol oxidation and hydrocarbon reforming, is the most widely used electrocatalyst for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in fuel cells. Efforts to find alternative catalysts to Pt have focused on Pt-based bimetallic alloys, where some platinum is replaced by less expensive metals. The catalytic properties of these alloys are determined by the surface geometry and electronic structure, which can be modified by the chemical composition, leading to improved catalytic effects when appropriate structures are achieved. Enhanced ORR activities have been observed in Pt alloys with 3d metals, with surface segregation playing a key role. For example, Stamenkovic et al. found that the ORR on Pt-skin structures produced by Pt segregating on the surface of annealed Pt3Co alloys is uniquely active, with a reaction rate four times that of pure Pt. The enhanced activities can be attributed to the surface electronic structure and surface bond length of alloy systems. The surface geometry can considerably alter catalytic efficiency, but for Pt3Co (1 1 1) and Pt3Ni (1 1 1) systems, the maximum deviation of the surface bond length after Pt segregation is only 0.002 Å, indicating that the geometric effect does not contribute to the enhanced ORR activities of Pt-skin surfaces. Instead, the electronic structures modified through surface segregation are the main factor for such enhancement. Theoretical approaches can help to elucidate the driving force and the tendency of this phenomenon. Surface segregation is also governed by temperature and by the presence of adsorbates.", "Doi": "10.1016/j.susc.2007.09.052"},

Alloys are generally less stable than pure Pt at the same oxygen coverage. Maintaining zero oxygen coverage at working potentials is crucial for achieving both high activity and stability. The stability of clean alloy surfaces can be inferred from the calculated Pt d-band structure, which shows that alloying generally leads to the stabilization of the Pt d-band, making surface Pt atoms more difficult to segregate or dissolve. However, in the presence of adsorbed O atoms, the removal of Pt is facilitated because the surface vacancy can be more strongly stabilized by O atoms. This is due to the fact that Pt atoms at the surface vacancy are less coordinated and possess more active d-states, which can more strongly bond with O atoms compared to terrace Pt atoms. Additionally, with the exposure of the second layer atoms at the surface vacancy, it is possible to form a much stronger OM bond compared to the OPt bond. This is observed in the search for the optimum structure after a Pt removal, which shows that the surface vacancy is preferentially terminated by O atoms that sink to bond with the solute M atoms at the second layer. For example, in Pt2Ti skin alloys, the surface vacancies with a configuration containing OTi bonding are much more stable than those with only OPt bonding. This is consistent with the fact that atomic O on metals is anion-like, with a strong tendency to accept electrons, and prefers to form ionic-bonds. The stability of Pt alloys under electrochemical conditions is generally lower than that of pure Pt when the oxygen coverage is the same, and maintaining zero oxygen coverage at working potentials (such as 0.9 V) is crucial for achieving both high activity and stability. Among more than 20 different Pt2M alloys, molybdenum (Mo) is identified as a good element that can alloy with Pt to form a stable surface at high electrochemical potentials. Pt2Mo has a lower kinetic barrier for oxygen reduction (OR) compared to Pt, and the barrier to OOH dissociation is a key kinetic parameter for OR activity. The higher stability of clean alloy surfaces can indeed be inferred from the calculated Pt d-band structure, which shows that alloying generally leads to the stabilization of the Pt d-band, making surface Pt atoms more difficult to segregate or dissolve. The stability of surfaces follows the order Pt2Mo > Pt > Pt2Ag > Pt2Pd > Pt2Nb > Pt2Ti > Pt2Sc > Pt2Zr, and only Pt2Mo exhibits higher stability than pure Pt at high potential (1.05 V). The oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) on a Pt2Mo alloy surface follows a similar reaction profile as on Pt, with the transition state (TS) for OOH dissociation determining the height of the potential profile. The TSs for OOH dissociation and O2 dissociation dictate the highest free energy positions in the reaction pathways. The aqueous environment, together with the in situ oxygen coverage, plays an important role in facilitating the ORR on alloy surfaces. The stability of PtxMo alloys drops quickly with increasing potential, in line with the rapid increase of surface oxygen coverage for PtxMo surfaces above 0.9 V. The Pt2Mo skin alloy achieves the best balance of stability and activity. A low Mo content (below 30%, e.g., Pt5Mo) may achieve a higher stability at high potentials, but the activity is not better than Pt at 0.9 V, while a high Mo content (above 30%, e.g., PtMo) will start to destabilize the alloy and also reduce the activity.", "Doi": "10.1039/c0ee00762e"},

The calculated higher stability of the CuPt SA compared with Cu in the bulk with CO adsorption on clean Pt(111) is nearly equal to the free-energy difference (ΔG). The interdiffusion of Cu and Pt becomes significant at 460 K, and the formation and breakup of the stable CO-induced surface alloy start to occur at this temperature. The DFT calculations reproduce the experimental observations and confirm the rationalization of the observed Cu surface segregation.

Since this process requires more than one contiguous Pt site, it is not surprising that O2 dissociation cannot occur on the PtAu clusters that are 100% Au at the surface before CO exposure, given the low probability for ensembles of Pt sites to form at the surface. In contrast, CO oxidation does not occur at the cluster surfaces that are initially pure Au, presumably because the first step in the oxidation process is O2 dissociation, which requires neighboring Pt sites. These factors have consequent implications for the catalytic properties and performance of bimetallic catalysts in various applications.", "Doi": "10.1021/jp108939h"},

Platinum is a popular cathode electrocatalyst in PEM fuel cells, but its slow kinetics for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) limits catalytic efficiency. In recent years, Pt-based alloys, which include Pt and other transition metals, have been extensively studied due to their enhanced ORR activity. Surface segregation plays a key role in this process, leading to the formation of a pure Pt-skin in the outermost layer of the alloys. This surface segregation is closely related to the enhanced stability of Pt-based catalysts. Au shows strong surface segregation in PtAu alloys, whereas Co is usually unable to enrich PtCo alloy surfaces. The process of Au segregating from the second layer to the surface is exothermic, indicating that Au surface segregation is thermodynamically favorable. However, for the PtCo alloy, the surface Co atoms have a stronger tendency to migrate to the second layer, making the continuous segregation of Co unlikely. Therefore, Co segregating to the clean Pt(111) surface is both thermodynamically unfavorable and kinetically prohibitive. Surface segregation has been found to play a key role in the process of Pt-based alloys.

The electronic structure of the surface Pt atoms only differs very slightly for the segregated and nonsegregated alloys. The discrepant adsorption properties are therefore mainly attributed to the direct involvement of 3d metals either on the surface or in the subsurface. The stability of Pt atoms of Pt-skin surfaces of the three alloys is enhanced with respect to those in pure Pt surfaces. Such stability enhancement is observed both in clean surfaces and under 0.25 ML of adsorbed atomic oxygen, and the degree of stability enhancement follows the opposite order of the oxygen adsorption strengths in the three studied alloys, indicating the protective role of the 3d subsurface atoms determined by their strong binding to the Pt surface layer.

Surface segregation, where one metal species enriches the surface or the first sub-surface layers over other components, has significant implications for materials science and surface chemistry. It affects physical and chemical properties such as permeation, surface adsorption, crystal growth, and metal corrosion. Notably, the catalytic activities of alloys can be dramatically altered through surface segregation. Pt, an efficient catalyst used in important chemical reactions like methanol oxidation and hydrocarbon reforming, is the most widely used electrocatalyst for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in fuel cells. Efforts to find alternative catalysts to Pt have focused on Pt-based bimetallic alloys, where some platinum is replaced by less expensive metals. The catalytic properties of these alloys are determined by the surface geometry and electronic structure, which can be modified by the chemical composition, leading to improved catalytic effects when appropriate structures are achieved. Enhanced ORR activities have been observed in Pt alloys with 3d metals, with surface segregation playing a key role. For example, Stamenkovic et al. found that the ORR on Pt-skin structures produced by Pt segregating on the surface of annealed Pt3Co alloys is uniquely active, with a reaction rate four times that of pure Pt. The enhanced activities can be attributed to the surface electronic structure and surface bond length of alloy systems. The surface geometry can considerably alter catalytic efficiency, but for Pt3Co (1 1 1) and Pt3Ni (1 1 1) systems, the maximum deviation of the surface bond length after Pt segregation is only 0.002 Å, indicating that the geometric effect does not contribute to the enhanced ORR activities of Pt-skin surfaces. Instead, the electronic structures modified through surface segregation are the main factor for such enhancement. Theoretical approaches can help to elucidate the driving force and the tendency of this phenomenon. Surface segregation is also governed by temperature and by the presence of adsorbates.", "Doi": "10.1016/j.susc.2007.09.052"},

Alloys are generally less stable than pure Pt at the same oxygen coverage. Maintaining zero oxygen coverage at working potentials is crucial for achieving both high activity and stability. The stability of clean alloy surfaces can be inferred from the calculated Pt d-band structure, which shows that alloying generally leads to the stabilization of the Pt d-band, making surface Pt atoms more difficult to segregate or dissolve. However, in the presence of adsorbed O atoms, the removal of Pt is facilitated because the surface vacancy can be more strongly stabilized by O atoms. This is due to the fact that Pt atoms at the surface vacancy are less coordinated and possess more active d-states, which can more strongly bond with O atoms compared to terrace Pt atoms. Additionally, with the exposure of the second layer atoms at the surface vacancy, it is possible to form a much stronger OM bond compared to the OPt bond. This is observed in the search for the optimum structure after a Pt removal, which shows that the surface vacancy is preferentially terminated by O atoms that sink to bond with the solute M atoms at the second layer. For example, in Pt2Ti skin alloys, the surface vacancies with a configuration containing OTi bonding are much more stable than those with only OPt bonding. This is consistent with the fact that atomic O on metals is anion-like, with a strong tendency to accept electrons, and prefers to form ionic-bonds. The stability of Pt alloys under electrochemical conditions is generally lower than that of pure Pt when the oxygen coverage is the same, and maintaining zero oxygen coverage at working potentials (such as 0.9 V) is crucial for achieving both high activity and stability. Among more than 20 different Pt2M alloys, molybdenum (Mo) is identified as a good element that can alloy with Pt to form a stable surface at high electrochemical potentials. Pt2Mo has a lower kinetic barrier for oxygen reduction (OR) compared to Pt, and the barrier to OOH dissociation is a key kinetic parameter for OR activity. The higher stability of clean alloy surfaces can indeed be inferred from the calculated Pt d-band structure, which shows that alloying generally leads to the stabilization of the Pt d-band, making surface Pt atoms more difficult to segregate or dissolve. The stability of surfaces follows the order Pt2Mo > Pt > Pt2Ag > Pt2Pd > Pt2Nb > Pt2Ti > Pt2Sc > Pt2Zr, and only Pt2Mo exhibits higher stability than pure Pt at high potential (1.05 V). The oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) on a Pt2Mo alloy surface follows a similar reaction profile as on Pt, with the transition state (TS) for OOH dissociation determining the height of the potential profile. The TSs for OOH dissociation and O2 dissociation dictate the highest free energy positions in the reaction pathways. The aqueous environment, together with the in situ oxygen coverage, plays an important role in facilitating the ORR on alloy surfaces. The stability of PtxMo alloys drops quickly with increasing potential, in line with the rapid increase of surface oxygen coverage for PtxMo surfaces above 0.9 V. The Pt2Mo skin alloy achieves the best balance of stability and activity. A low Mo content (below 30%, e.g., Pt5Mo) may achieve a higher stability at high potentials, but the activity is not better than Pt at 0.9 V, while a high Mo content (above 30%, e.g., PtMo) will start to destabilize the alloy and also reduce the activity.", "Doi": "10.1039/c0ee00762e"},

The calculated higher stability of the CuPt SA compared with Cu in the bulk with CO adsorption on clean Pt(111) is nearly equal to the free-energy difference (ΔG). The interdiffusion of Cu and Pt becomes significant at 460 K, and the formation and breakup of the stable CO-induced surface alloy start to occur at this temperature. The DFT calculations reproduce the experimental observations and confirm the rationalization of the observed Cu surface segregation.

Since this process requires more than one contiguous Pt site, it is not surprising that O2 dissociation cannot occur on the PtAu clusters that are 100% Au at the surface before CO exposure, given the low probability for ensembles of Pt sites to form at the surface. In contrast, CO oxidation does not occur at the cluster surfaces that are initially pure Au, presumably because the first step in the oxidation process is O2 dissociation, which requires neighboring Pt sites. These factors have consequent implications for the catalytic properties and performance of bimetallic catalysts in various applications.", "Doi": "10.1021/jp108939h"},

Platinum is a popular cathode electrocatalyst in PEM fuel cells, but its slow kinetics for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) limits catalytic efficiency. In recent years, Pt-based alloys, which include Pt and other transition metals, have been extensively studied due to their enhanced ORR activity. Surface segregation plays a key role in this process, leading to the formation of a pure Pt-skin in the outermost layer of the alloys. This surface segregation is closely related to the enhanced stability of Pt-based catalysts. Au shows strong surface segregation in PtAu alloys, whereas Co is usually unable to enrich PtCo alloy surfaces. The process of Au segregating from the second layer to the surface is exothermic, indicating that Au surface segregation is thermodynamically favorable. However, for the PtCo alloy, the surface Co atoms have a stronger tendency to migrate to the second layer, making the continuous segregation of Co unlikely. Therefore, Co segregating to the clean Pt(111) surface is both thermodynamically unfavorable and kinetically prohibitive. Surface segregation has been found to play a key role in the process of Pt-based alloys.

The electronic structure of the surface Pt atoms only differs very slightly for the segregated and nonsegregated alloys. The discrepant adsorption properties are therefore mainly attributed to the direct involvement of 3d metals either on the surface or in the subsurface. The stability of Pt atoms of Pt-skin surfaces of the three alloys is enhanced with respect to those in pure Pt surfaces. Such stability enhancement is observed both in clean surfaces and under 0.25 ML of adsorbed atomic oxygen, and the degree of stability enhancement follows the opposite order of the oxygen adsorption strengths in the three studied alloys, indicating the protective role of the 3d subsurface atoms determined by their strong binding to the Pt surface layer.

Surface segregation, where one metal species enriches the surface or the first sub-surface layers over other components, has significant implications for materials science and surface chemistry. It affects physical and chemical properties such as permeation, surface adsorption, crystal growth, and metal corrosion. Notably, the catalytic activities of alloys can be dramatically altered through surface segregation. Pt, an efficient catalyst used in important chemical reactions like methanol oxidation and hydrocarbon reforming, is the most widely used electrocatalyst for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in fuel cells. Efforts to find alternative catalysts to Pt have focused on Pt-based bimetallic alloys, where some platinum is replaced by less expensive metals. The catalytic properties of these alloys are determined by the surface geometry and electronic structure, which can be modified by the chemical composition, leading to improved catalytic effects when appropriate structures are achieved. Enhanced ORR activities have been observed in Pt alloys with 3d metals, with surface segregation playing a key role. For example, Stamenkovic et al. found that the ORR on Pt-skin structures produced by Pt segregating on the surface of annealed Pt3Co alloys is uniquely active, with a reaction rate four times that of pure Pt. The enhanced activities can be attributed to the surface electronic structure and surface bond length of alloy systems. The surface geometry can considerably alter catalytic efficiency, but for Pt3Co (1 1 1) and Pt3Ni (1 1 1) systems, the maximum deviation of the surface bond length after Pt segregation is only 0.002 Å, indicating that the geometric effect does not contribute to the enhanced ORR activities of Pt-skin surfaces. Instead, the electronic structures modified through surface segregation are the main factor for such enhancement. Theoretical approaches can help to elucidate the driving force and the tendency of this phenomenon. Surface segregation is also governed by temperature and by the presence of adsorbates.", "Doi": "10.1016/j.susc.2007.09.052"},

Alloys are generally less stable than pure Pt at the same oxygen coverage. Maintaining zero oxygen coverage at working potentials is crucial for achieving both high activity and stability. The stability of clean alloy surfaces can be inferred from the calculated Pt d-band structure, which shows that alloying generally leads to the stabilization of the Pt d-band, making surface Pt atoms more difficult to segregate or dissolve. However, in the presence of adsorbed O atoms, the removal of Pt is facilitated because the surface vacancy can be more strongly stabilized by O atoms. This is due to the fact that Pt atoms at the surface vacancy are less coordinated and possess more active d-states, which can more strongly bond with O atoms compared to terrace Pt atoms. Additionally, with the exposure of the second layer atoms at the surface vacancy, it is possible to form a much stronger OM bond compared to the OPt bond. This is observed in the search for the optimum structure after a Pt removal, which shows that the surface vacancy is preferentially terminated by O atoms that sink to bond with the solute M atoms at the second layer. For example, in Pt2Ti skin alloys, the surface vacancies with a configuration containing OTi bonding are much more stable than those with only OPt bonding. This is consistent with the fact that atomic O on metals is anion-like, with a strong tendency to accept electrons, and prefers to form ionic-bonds. The stability of Pt alloys under electrochemical conditions is generally lower than that of pure Pt when the oxygen coverage is the same, and maintaining zero oxygen coverage at working potentials (such as 0.9 V) is crucial for achieving both high activity and stability. Among more than 20 different Pt2M alloys, molybdenum (Mo) is identified as a good element that can alloy with Pt to form a stable surface at high electrochemical potentials. Pt2Mo has a lower kinetic barrier for oxygen reduction (OR) compared to Pt, and the barrier to OOH dissociation is a key kinetic parameter for OR activity. The higher stability of clean alloy surfaces can indeed be inferred from the calculated Pt d-band structure, which shows that alloying generally leads to the stabilization of the Pt d-band, making surface Pt atoms more difficult to segregate or dissolve. The stability of surfaces follows the order Pt2Mo > Pt > Pt2Ag > Pt2Pd > Pt2Nb > Pt2Ti > Pt2Sc > Pt2Zr, and only Pt2Mo exhibits higher stability than pure Pt at high potential (1.05 V). The oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) on a Pt2Mo alloy surface follows a similar reaction profile as on Pt, with the transition state (TS) for OOH dissociation determining the height of the potential profile. The TSs for OOH dissociation and O2 dissociation dictate the highest free energy positions in the reaction pathways. The aqueous environment, together with the in situ oxygen coverage, plays an important role in facilitating the ORR on alloy surfaces. The stability of PtxMo alloys drops quickly with increasing potential, in line with the rapid increase of surface oxygen coverage for PtxMo surfaces above 0.9 V. The Pt2Mo skin alloy achieves the best balance of stability and activity. A low Mo content (below 30%, e.g., Pt5Mo) may achieve a higher stability at high potentials, but the activity is not better than Pt at 0.9 V, while a high Mo content (above 30%, e.g., PtMo) will start to destabilize the alloy and also reduce the activity.", "Doi": "10.1039/c0ee00762e"},

The calculated higher stability of the CuPt SA compared with Cu in the bulk with CO adsorption on clean Pt(111) is nearly equal to the free-energy difference (ΔG). The interdiffusion of Cu and Pt becomes significant at 460 K, and the formation and breakup of the stable CO-induced surface alloy start to occur at this temperature. The DFT calculations reproduce the experimental observations and confirm the rationalization of the observed Cu surface segregation.

Since this process requires more than one contiguous Pt site, it is not surprising that O2 dissociation cannot occur on the PtAu clusters that are 100% Au at the surface before CO exposure, given the low probability for ensembles of Pt sites to form at the surface. In contrast, CO oxidation does not occur at the cluster surfaces that are initially pure Au, presumably because the first step in the oxidation process is O2 dissociation, which requires neighboring Pt sites. These factors have consequent implications for the catalytic properties and performance of bimetallic catalysts in various applications.", "Doi": "10.1021/jp108939h"},
