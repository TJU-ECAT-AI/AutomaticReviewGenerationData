The stability of Pt3dPt subsurface structures in various conditions is a critical factor in their catalytic properties and performance. These structures are desirable in heterogeneous catalysis and electrocatalysis. DFT predictions indicate that these structures are stable in vacuum and with adsorbed hydrogen, but with adsorbed oxygen, the 3d atoms should segregate to the surface. These predictions have been experimentally verified on selected Pt3dPt(111) systems and expanded to polycrystalline Pt to understand the effects of multiple crystal facets on the kinetic barriers for the segregation of subsurface 3d atoms. The Pt3dPt subsurface structures are predicted to have higher activation barriers for oxygen-induced segregation compared to the respective Pt3dPt(111) configuration. The PtNiPt system is the most resistant to oxygen-induced segregation, while the PtTiPt configuration is the most susceptible. The stability of these structures in vacuum and with adsorbed hydrogen and oxygen has been demonstrated through DFT calculations and experimental verification on both single crystal Pt(111) and polycrystalline Pt foil. Using combined theoretical and experimental approaches, the relative stability of surface and subsurface bimetallic structures can be quantified and general trends predicted. The difference in the occupied d-band center, Δεd, can be used to screen potential bimetallic alloys with desirable stability in different environments. A BrnstedEvansPolanyi relationship has been derived to correlate thermodynamic stability from DFT calculations with kinetic barriers from experimental measurements for the Pt3dPt systems. Empirical equations have been developed to predict the thermodynamic stability of other bimetallic systems in various conditions. The large difference in binding energies between surface and subsurface structures highlights the need to understand their stability in reacting environments. For Pt3d bimetallic systems, the difference in oxygen binding energy for these configurations is on the order of hundreds of kcal/mol. Based on Sabatier's principle, if a subsurface alloy structure exhibits optimal binding properties for dehydrogenation and ORR, the surface structure would likely bind intermediates too strongly, halting the reaction. Conversely, if the surface alloy structure exhibits optimal binding properties for steam reforming, the subsurface structure would bind adsorbates too weakly, preventing the reaction from proceeding. The stability of bimetallic structures has been considered with various atomic species, which can be extended to more complex adsorbates using scaling relationships. DFT results predict that subsurface PtMPt(111) configurations are preferred in vacuum and with 0.5 ML H, while surface MPtPt(111) configurations are preferred with 0.5 ML O. Experimental measurements have verified the predicted segregation of subsurface 3d atoms in the presence of oxygen and quantified the activation barrier for adsorbate-induced segregation. AES results suggest two regions of segregation, revealing that DFT predictions and experimental measurements on single crystal bimetallic surfaces are applicable to polycrystalline substrates, bridging the materials gap. Predictions show that all Pt3dPt(100) structures have a higher activation barrier for oxygen-induced segregation compared to respective Pt3dPt(111) configurations. Linear trends in all systems show that the correlation of thermodynamic stability with the difference in d-band center can be used beyond Pt3d alloys. Switching the admetal/host component shifts the absolute driving potential of the segregation. This general stability trend predicts that all bimetallic systems have the same thermodynamically preferred configuration in each environment, with subsurface configurations preferred in vacuum and with 0.5 ML H, and surface configurations favored with 0.5 ML O.

The thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions influence the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems such as Pt-3d alloys. The simulation results showed that the Pd atoms would segregate into the outermost layers of the extended surfaces and the Pt concentration would increase monotonically from the extended surfaces into the bulk. The equilibrium PtPd nanoparticles were found to have Pd-enriched shells and Pt-enriched cores. In the shell of the PtPd nanoparticles, the Pd atoms were predicted to preferably segregate to the (100) facets rather than the (111) facets. These phenomena have consequent implications for their catalytic properties and performance in various applications.

The stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems such as Pt-3d alloys, are influenced by thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions. The dissolution of Fe atoms in a PtFe alloy under specific conditions leads to the formation of a Pt skin layer with predominantly (111)-oriented facets. This process is investigated using in situ electrochemical scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) in a 0.1 M HClO4 solution. The potential cycles applied to the PtFe film result in increased dissolution of Fe and the rearrangement of Pt at the surface, forming a protective Pt skin layer. This layer protects the underlying PtFe alloy from corrosion, which has implications for the catalytic properties and performance of the alloy in fuel cell applications. Further studies on the Pt skin layer, such as the adsorption and oxidation of CO, are being conducted to better understand its electrocatalytic behavior.

The literature does not provide specific information on how thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions influence the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems such as Pt-3d alloys, and what are the consequent implications for their catalytic properties and performance in various applications. However, it does mention that the design of high performance cathode electrocatalysts is essential for polymer electrolyte fuel cells, and that the enhancement of electrocatalytic activity of Pt by alloying with Fe results in a maximum activity at ca. 50% Fe content, which is 25 times higher than pure Pt activity. The enhancement could be well explained by the 5d-vacancy of the surface, but not by Pt interatomic distance or roughening of the surfaces.

The stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems such as Pt-3d alloys, are influenced by thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions. Platinum is a popular cathode electrocatalyst in PEM fuel cells, but its slow kinetics for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) limits catalytic efficiency. In recent years, Pt-based alloys, which include Pt and other transition metals, have been extensively studied due to their enhanced ORR activity. Surface segregation plays a key role in this process, leading to the formation of a pure Pt-skin in the outermost layer of the alloys. This surface segregation is closely related to the enhanced stability of Pt-based catalysts. Au shows strong surface segregation in PtAu alloys, whereas Co is usually unable to enrich PtCo alloy surfaces. The process of Au segregating from the second layer to the surface is exothermic, indicating that Au surface segregation is thermodynamically favorable. However, for the PtCo alloy, the surface Co atoms have a stronger tendency to migrate to the second layer, making the continuous segregation of Co unlikely. Therefore, Co segregating to the clean Pt(111) surface is both thermodynamically unfavorable and kinetically prohibitive. Surface segregation has been found to play a key role in the process of Pt-based alloys. For instance, Stamenkovic et al. found that the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is uniquely active on Pt-skin surfaces, and the reaction rate is four times that of the pure Pt catalyst. Numerous studies have been carried out using modern experimental and computational techniques to understand the importance of surface segregation for Pt-based alloys. For many Pt alloy systems, segregation trends have been unambiguously identified, and the components of surface and subsurface regions have successfully been characterized. The dissolution of metal atoms results in some defects on the alloy surface, which are critical to the rearrangement process. The phenomenon can also be observed in acidic solution, often with dissolution of the alloyed metal and rearrangement of Pt atoms. The segregation process includes interlayer migration of the impurity atom, vacancy movement at the second layer, and vacancy regeneration at the surface layer. The segregation model can successfully interpret these phenomena, particularly from a kinetics viewpoint. The pathway from 1 to 4 describes a complete cycle in which an impurity atom in the second layer segregates to the Pt(111) surface. The process is exothermic for the PtAu system, whereas it is endothermic for the PtCo system. Therefore, Co segregating to the clean Pt(111) surface is both thermodynamically unfavorable and kinetically prohibitive according to the model.

The thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions significantly influence the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems such as Pt-3d alloys. The introduction of 3d metals into the Pt(111) system considerably alters the surface adsorption properties, which can be considerably modified by the 3d metals. The electronic structure of the surface Pt atoms only differs very slightly for the segregated and nonsegregated alloys. The discrepant adsorption properties are therefore mainly attributed to the direct involvement of 3d metals either on the surface or in the subsurface. The stability of Pt atoms of Pt-skin surfaces of the three alloys is enhanced with respect to those in pure Pt surfaces. Such stability enhancement is observed both in clean surfaces and under 0.25 ML of adsorbed atomic oxygen, and the degree of stability enhancement follows the opposite order of the oxygen adsorption strengths in the three studied alloys, indicating the protective role of the 3d subsurface atoms determined by their strong binding to the Pt surface layer. The presence of 3d metals in the alloys modifies the electronic and geometric properties, altering the binding strength of adsorbates. This can lead to enhanced catalytic properties and performance in various applications, such as increased oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) rate and improved electrochemical stability against dissolution. The formation of a Pt-skin layer on the surface of Pt-3d alloys, accompanied by a Pt-depleted layer underneath, is a result of surface segregation that can facilitate the removal of adsorbed species, increasing the ORR rate. The stability enhancement of Pt-skin surfaces is associated with a positive potential shift, indicating that the dissolution of Pt atoms is delayed to higher potentials. The presence of adsorbates, such as oxygen, can affect the stability of the catalysts, but Pt-skin surfaces from the alloys still show enhanced stability compared to pure Pt under adsorbate coverage.

The literature does not provide specific information on how thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions influence the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems such as Pt-3d alloys, and the consequent implications for their catalytic properties and performance in various applications. However, it does discuss the effects of annealing temperature on the structural and chemical properties of bimetallic PtRu/Ru(0001) surfaces, which can be related to the broader question. The study shows that annealing leads to changes in the surface morphology from Pt islands on the Ru substrate to a PtRu/Ru(0001) surface alloy, which significantly alters the adsorption properties of the surface. This can be attributed to changes in the composition of the adsorption ensembles and electronic interactions between the metallic constituents upon alloy formation. These changes have implications for the catalytic properties of the surface, as they can affect the activity and selectivity of the catalyst. The literature also discusses the structural and chemical properties of bimetallic PtRu/Ru(0001) model catalysts and their modification upon stepwise annealing of a submonolayer Pt-covered Ru(0001) surface up to the formation of an equilibrated PtxRu1-x/Ru(0001) monolayer surface alloy. The study reveals that the surface structure significantly affects the adsorption properties of the bimetallic surface, which can be explained by changes in the composition of the adsorption ensembles (ensemble effects) for D adsorption and by changes in the electronic interaction (ligand effects, strain effects) of the metallic constituents for CO and D adsorption upon alloy formation. The surface structure and distribution of the components in the topmost layer are accessible by scanning tunneling microscopy (STM), and that the adsorption properties of the bimetallic surface can be explained by changes of the composition of the adsorption ensembles (ensemble effects) for D adsorption and by changes in the electronic interaction (ligand effects, strain effects) of the metallic constituents for CO and D adsorption upon alloy formation. The study reveals that the surface structure significantly affects the adsorption properties of the bimetallic surface, which can be explained by changes in the composition of the adsorption ensembles (ensemble effects) for D adsorption and by changes in the electronic interaction (ligand effects, strain effects) of the metallic constituents for CO and D adsorption upon alloy formation. The study shows that annealing leads to changes in the surface morphology from Pt islands on the Ru substrate to PtRu/Ru(0001) surface alloys, inducing significant changes in the adsorption properties of CO and deuterium. These changes can be attributed to ensemble effects for D adsorption and electronic interaction effects for CO and D adsorption upon alloy formation. The results demonstrate the sensitivity of probe molecule adsorption to the local structure and composition of a bimetallic surface, even for a combination of two chemically active metals such as Ru and Pt.

The stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems such as Pt-3d alloys, are influenced by thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions. Surface segregation, where one metal species enriches the surface or the first sub-surface layers over other components, has significant implications for materials science and surface chemistry. It affects physical and chemical properties such as permeation, surface adsorption, crystal growth, and metal corrosion. Notably, the catalytic activities of alloys can be dramatically altered through surface segregation. Pt, an efficient catalyst used in important chemical reactions like methanol oxidation and hydrocarbon reforming, is the most widely used electrocatalyst for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in fuel cells. Efforts to find alternative catalysts to Pt have focused on Pt-based bimetallic alloys, where some platinum is replaced by less expensive metals. The catalytic properties of these alloys are determined by the surface geometry and electronic structure, which can be modified by the chemical composition, leading to improved catalytic effects when appropriate structures are achieved. Enhanced ORR activities have been observed in Pt alloys with 3d metals, with surface segregation playing a key role. For example, Stamenkovic et al. found that the ORR on Pt-skin structures produced by Pt segregating on the surface of annealed Pt3Co alloys is uniquely active, with a reaction rate four times that of pure Pt. The enhanced activities can be attributed to the surface electronic structure and surface bond length of alloy systems. The surface geometry can considerably alter catalytic efficiency, but for Pt3Co (1 1 1) and Pt3Ni (1 1 1) systems, the maximum deviation of the surface bond length after Pt segregation is only 0.002 Å, indicating that the geometric effect does not contribute to the enhanced ORR activities of Pt-skin surfaces. Instead, the electronic structures modified through surface segregation are the main factor for such enhancement. Theoretical approaches can help to elucidate the driving force and the tendency of this phenomenon. Surface segregation is also governed by temperature and by the presence of adsorbates.

The literature does not provide specific information on how thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions influence the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems such as Pt-3d alloys, and the consequent implications for their catalytic properties and performance in various applications. However, it does discuss the growth of silver on a Pt(1 0 0) surface and the evolution of the structure with increasing temperature, which can be related to the stability and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts. At room temperature, the formation of elongated 2D-adislands with a composition of Ag80Pt20 was observed. Annealing of the sample above 600 K causes more extensive alloying starting at the perimeter of the Ag adislands by AgPt exchange and formation of a nanophasic AgPt alloy confined to the surface layer. With sufficient Ag, this alloy spreads across the surface until a uniform stoichiometry is established over the entire surface. Temperature-dependent AES studies indicate that there is some mixing of Ag with bulk Pt at elevated temperatures. These findings suggest that the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts can be influenced by thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions, which in turn can affect their catalytic properties and performance in various applications.

Ternary alloys have a strong tendency for platinum surface segregation, forming a platinum monolayer on their surfaces. This top platinum monolayer results in relatively weaker binding strengths of oxygen and hydroxyl groups in the ternary alloys, indicating enhanced activity for the oxygen reduction reaction compared to bimetallic alloy surfaces. Additionally, the platinum-skin surfaces of ternary alloys exhibit improved electrochemical stability against the dissolution of platinum atoms from the alloy surface.

The stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems such as Pt-3d alloys, are influenced by thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions. Some near-surface alloys (NSAs) bind atomic hydrogen as weakly as noble metals while dissociating H2 more easily, which is beneficial for hydrogen-related reactions. Hydrogen chemistry on NSAs is crucial for many chemical and pharmaceutical processes. Density functional theory calculations are used to develop new NSAs for these processes. Selected NSAs allow weak hydrogen binding and low H2 dissociation barriers, which is an exception to the general rule. The lowering of the transition-state energy is observed even on non-ideal NSAs, although the effect is less pronounced. NSAs promise high hydrogenation activity at low temperatures, which is beneficial for the production of chiral pharmaceutical compounds and could potentially permit easier separation and storage of hydrogen. The stability of near-surface alloys (NSAs) can be assessed using a two-step procedure: first, considering the composition in vacuum, and then accounting for the effects of hydrogen adsorption. Adsorbates can draw to the surface components of alloys to which they bind strongly. The tendency of hydrogen to induce surface segregation can be estimated by comparing the segregation energy (Eseg) of the solute to the difference in the magnitudes of the hydrogen binding energies between the pure solute and the pure host. Real NSAs may differ from idealized models, but these deviations do not substantially affect the main trends in adsorbate behavior. Some experimental studies have shown significantly modified catalytic activity on non-ideal NSAs, in line with theoretical predictions.

The thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions can influence the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems such as Pt-3d alloys. The addition of a third transition metal element M can modify the driving energy for Pt segregation to the outermost layer of Pt3Ni (111) surface. Transition metals V, Fe, Co, Mo, Tc, Ru, W, Re, Os, and Ir were predicted to lead to even more negative Pt surface segregation energies than that in the based Pt3Ni (111) surface, further promoting Pt surface segregation. In contrast, doping transition metals Ag, Au, and Pd would lead to positive segregation energies and hence suppress the Pt surface segregation in the corresponding Pt3Ni/M (111) surface. The surface energy effect, strain effect, and heat of solution effect induced by the doped element M would collectively affect the Pt surface segregation energy in the Pt3Ni/M (111) surfaces. The extent of Pt surface segregation is determined by the relative Pt surface segregation energy, lattice mismatch, and heat of solution of the Pt3M crystal with respect to those of the Pt3Ni crystal. Replacing Ni with transition metals V, Fe, Co, Mo, Tc, Ru, W, Re, Os, and Ir would lead to even stronger Pt segregation extent to the surface while replacing Ni with transition metals Ag, Au, and Pd could completely prohibit Pt segregating to the surface.

The stability of Pt-based alloys, such as Pt-3d alloys, is influenced by the oxygen coverage under electrochemical conditions. Alloys are generally less stable than pure Pt at the same oxygen coverage. Maintaining zero oxygen coverage at working potentials is crucial for achieving both high activity and stability. The stability of clean alloy surfaces can be inferred from the calculated Pt d-band structure, which shows that alloying generally leads to the stabilization of the Pt d-band, making surface Pt atoms more difficult to segregate or dissolve. However, in the presence of adsorbed O atoms, the removal of Pt is facilitated because the surface vacancy can be more strongly stabilized by O atoms. This is due to the fact that Pt atoms at the surface vacancy are less coordinated and possess more active d-states, which can more strongly bond with O atoms compared to terrace Pt atoms. Additionally, with the exposure of the second layer atoms at the surface vacancy, it is possible to form a much stronger OM bond compared to the OPt bond. This is observed in the search for the optimum structure after a Pt removal, which shows that the surface vacancy is preferentially terminated by O atoms that sink to bond with the solute M atoms at the second layer. For example, in Pt2Ti skin alloys, the surface vacancies with a configuration containing OTi bonding are much more stable than those with only OPt bonding. This is consistent with the fact that atomic O on metals is anion-like, with a strong tendency to accept electrons, and prefers to form ionic-bonds. The stability of Pt alloys under electrochemical conditions is generally lower than that of pure Pt when the oxygen coverage is the same, and maintaining zero oxygen coverage at working potentials (such as 0.9 V) is crucial for achieving both high activity and stability. Among more than 20 different Pt2M alloys, molybdenum (Mo) is identified as a good element that can alloy with Pt to form a stable surface at high electrochemical potentials. Pt2Mo has a lower kinetic barrier for oxygen reduction (OR) compared to Pt, and the barrier to OOH dissociation is a key kinetic parameter for OR activity. The higher stability of clean alloy surfaces can indeed be inferred from the calculated Pt d-band structure, which shows that alloying generally leads to the stabilization of the Pt d-band, making surface Pt atoms more difficult to segregate or dissolve. The stability of surfaces follows the order Pt2Mo > Pt > Pt2Ag > Pt2Pd > Pt2Nb > Pt2Ti > Pt2Sc > Pt2Zr, and only Pt2Mo exhibits higher stability than pure Pt at high potential (1.05 V). The oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) on a Pt2Mo alloy surface follows a similar reaction profile as on Pt, with the transition state (TS) for OOH dissociation determining the height of the potential profile. The TSs for OOH dissociation and O2 dissociation dictate the highest free energy positions in the reaction pathways. The aqueous environment, together with the in situ oxygen coverage, plays an important role in facilitating the ORR on alloy surfaces. The stability of PtxMo alloys drops quickly with increasing potential, in line with the rapid increase of surface oxygen coverage for PtxMo surfaces above 0.9 V. The Pt2Mo skin alloy achieves the best balance of stability and activity. A low Mo content (below 30%, e.g., Pt5Mo) may achieve a higher stability at high potentials, but the activity is not better than Pt at 0.9 V, while a high Mo content (above 30%, e.g., PtMo) will start to destabilize the alloy and also reduce the activity.

The stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems such as CuPt near-surface alloys, are influenced by thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions. CO adsorption at elevated pressures and temperatures can pull the less reactive Cu to the surface, driven by the formation of a stable self-organized CO/CuPt surface alloy structure. This is rationalized by the significantly stronger PtCO bond when Cu is present in the first surface layer of Pt. The results suggest new possibilities for selective and dynamical engineering of alloy surfaces for catalysis, with implications for catalytic properties and performance in various applications, including water-gas shift reactions. DFT calculations confirm the observed Cu surface segregation and the weakening of the PtCO bond with increasing Cu content in the second layer. The onset of bulk migration of Cu is explained by the results with adsorbed CO, and the interdiffusion of Cu and Pt becomes significant at 460 K, where the formation and breakup of the stable CO-induced surface alloy start to occur. The results add to the promise of using molecular adsorbate-induced surface changes as a tool for selective and dynamical engineering of alloy surfaces, likely extending to a wide variety of coinage (Cu, Ag)/Pt-group bimetallic surface alloys.
The stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems such as Pt-3d alloys, are influenced by thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions. Contrary to expectations, CO adsorption at elevated pressures and temperatures can pull the less reactive Cu to the surface of a CuPt near-surface alloy, forming a stable self-organized CO/CuPt surface alloy structure. This is due to the significantly stronger PtCO bond when Cu is present in the first surface layer of Pt. The findings suggest new possibilities for selective and dynamical engineering of alloy surfaces for catalysis, potentially applicable to a range of coinage (Cu, Ag)/Pt-group bimetallic surface alloys.

CO adsorption at elevated pressures and temperatures can pull the less reactive Cu to the surface of a CuPt near-surface alloy, driven by the formation of a stable self-organized CO/CuPt surface alloy structure. This is due to the drastically stronger PtCO bond when Cu is present in the first surface layer of Pt. The results are expected to apply to a range of coinage (Cu, Ag)/Pt-group bimetallic surface alloys. The bonding of adsorbates can induce changes in local atomic composition and surface structure, changing the activity and selectivity of the catalyst. The CuPt near-surface alloy (NSA) was suggested as a promising water-gas shift catalyst because of reduced PtCO bonding on a Pt catalyst surface with Cu present in the second layer. However, the NSA is unstable at elevated CO pressures and sample temperatures, forming instead a self-organized CO/CuPt surface alloy (SA) structure. The results are confirmed by extended density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Although Cu diffusion to the first layer is endothermic, the drastic increase in CO binding energy more than compensates for the endothermicity. The vastly increased PtCO bond strength when 2/3 ML of Cu is present in the first layer rationalizes the observed Cu surface segregation. The calculated higher stability of the CuPt SA compared with Cu in the bulk with CO adsorption on clean Pt(111) is nearly equal to the free-energy difference (ΔG). The interdiffusion of Cu and Pt becomes significant at 460 K, and the formation and breakup of the stable CO-induced surface alloy start to occur at this temperature. The DFT calculations reproduce the experimental observations and confirm the rationalization of the observed Cu surface segregation. The results for the CuPt system at elevated temperatures and CO pressures, where a novel stable CO-induced surface alloy forms, likely extend to a wide variety of coinage (Cu, Ag)/Pt-group bimetallic surface alloys.

The thermodynamics and kinetics of oxygen-induced segregation of 3d metals in Pt-based systems, such as Pt-3d alloys, are influenced by factors including the crystal plane, which affects the stability of subsurface 3d metals. This has implications for the catalytic properties and performance of bimetallic catalysts in various applications, particularly in oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activity. The stability of subsurface 3d metals in Pt(111) and Pt(100) under oxygen exposure is predicted through Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations. The crystal plane has an effect on the subsurface stability of the bimetallic catalysts. These factors influence the surface segregation and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, which in turn affect their catalytic properties and performance in various applications.

The thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions significantly influence the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems such as Pt-3d alloys. Bimetallic catalysts exhibit greater surface structural complexity compared to monometallic catalysts, with the second metal, in either its metallic or oxidized state, being present on the surface, in the near-surface region, or embedded in the bulk region. The surface structure of bimetallic catalysts is crucial to their catalytic properties. For instance, Pt-based bimetallic catalysts with Pt-skin surfaces and 3d transition metals in the subsurface region demonstrate superior catalytic performance in many reactions compared to pure Pt surfaces. The structure of the catalyst surface often changes dynamically during reactions, similar to reversible surface processes observed in monometallic catalyst systems when the gaseous environment shifts between reductive and oxidative conditions. Bimetallic catalysts may exhibit a similar dependence of surface structure on the redox potential of reaction gases, providing an opportunity to adjust catalytic activity and selectivity.

The stability of bimetallic surface structures under reaction conditions is a critical factor in bimetallic catalysis, as it can modify catalytic properties. For example, under annealing conditions, the subsurface PtNiPt(111) structure is more thermodynamically stable than the surface NiPtPt(111) structure in vacuum. Pt3d alloys in fuel cell applications often have a Pt skin, indicating a thermodynamic preference for Pt-terminated bimetallic surfaces. The segregation energy (Eseg) determines whether the admetal segregates to the surface or remains in the subsurface, affecting the surface composition. Hydrogen-induced segregation is influenced by Eseg and the difference in hydrogen-binding energies on the surface and subsurface. Oxygen can destabilize the subsurface structure, driving subsurface 3d metals to segregate to the surface. Adsorbates with weak Pauling electronegativity have a small effect on the thermodynamic potential for interchanging surface and subsurface configurations, while those with strong Pauling electronegativity can significantly alter binding energy, leading to surface segregation when their coverage is high enough. Oxygen-induced surface segregation is also predicted for specific Pt-based alloy surfaces.

The thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions significantly influence the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems such as Pt-3d alloys. Under reductive conditions, such as vacuum and carbon monoxide, 3d transition metals prefer to occupy the subsurface layer due to their higher surface energy and smaller atomic size. However, under oxidizing conditions, the strong interaction between oxygen and 3d transition metals induces their segregation to the surface, leading to the formation of oxidized 3d transition metal islands. These structural changes have profound implications for the catalytic properties and performance of these materials in various applications. For instance, Pt(111) surfaces with atomic dispersed 3d transition metals in the surface layers exhibit high activity for CO oxidation through a bi-functional mechanism. The interplay between the structure, reaction environment, and catalytic activity is a critical factor in determining the performance of alloy catalysts.

The surface structures of PtNi, PtCo, and PtCu bimetallic catalysts exhibit reversible changes in response to the redox potential of the environmental gas. These changes can be controlled by treating the catalysts in various gases. Surface segregation is a common phenomenon in bimetallic surfaces, where a metal with a larger atomic radius tends to segregate to the surface to release strain. Platinum, with its larger atomic radius compared to cobalt, nickel, and copper, is more likely to segregate to the surface. The presence of hydrogen does not alter the thermodynamic driving force for surface segregation. Oxygen adsorption on Pt-M catalyst surfaces can induce the segregation of 3d transition metals to the top surface due to the strong bonding between oxygen and 3d transition metals. In oxidative environments, 3d transition metals can become oxidized, and the formed oxides tend to encapsulate platinum surfaces. The mass transport processes that occur during oxidation or reduction reactions are fully reversible, depending on the redox potential of the reaction gases. The reversible structural changes in Pt-based bimetallic catalysts have significant implications for real catalytic processes.

The stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems such as Pt-3d alloys, are influenced by thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions. Fe-Pt catalysts have been used in the preferential oxidation (PROX) of CO in excess H2, achieving high selectivity for CO oxidation. Pt-skin structures show high activity for catalyzing the hydrogenation of unsaturated hydrocarbons. The unique catalytic properties of the Pt-skin surfaces are attributed to the modification of the electronic structure of the surface Pt by the subsurface Fe underneath, influencing the adsorption and reaction characteristics of the surface species. The controlled preparation of various Fe-Pt surface structures allows for the derivation of the relationship between structure and catalytic properties, aiding in the design of high-performance and low-cost catalysts. The stability of the Pt-skin structure can be reduced under certain circumstances, such as an oxidative environment, leading to gas-induced Fe surface segregation. The structural configuration of the catalyst can be transformed between surface Fe or FeO and subsurface Fe on the Pt(111) surface by cycles of oxidation and reduction. These transformations have implications for the catalytic properties and performance of the catalysts in various applications, including oxygen reduction reactions, hydrogenation of unsaturated hydrocarbons, and the preferential oxidation of CO in excess H2. Depending on the preparation procedures and reaction conditions, Fe overlayers with either metallic or oxidized states may be present as the topmost surface or in the subsurface region of Pt. Different reactions can produce different Fe-Pt surface structural configurations. For oxygen reduction reactions (ORR), Pt-skin structures with Fe or some other transition metals in the subsurface regions showed a higher activity than pure Pt. For instance, Fe49Pt51 alloys with 100% Pt as the topmost layer had 25 times the activity of pure Pt catalysts in ORR. The optimization of the performance of Fe-Pt structures in magnetism and catalysis places a high demand on the design and control of the surface structural configurations and needs information on the stability of the various structures at elevated temperatures and under different reaction atmospheres.

Surface segregation in bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems such as Pt-3d alloys, is influenced by thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions. This phenomenon is crucial in materials science, catalysis, and surface chemistry, affecting properties like permeation, surface adsorption, crystal growth, and metal corrosion. Surface segregation can significantly alter the catalytic activities of alloys, as evidenced by enhanced oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activities in Pt alloys with 3d metals compared to pure Pt. The unusual catalytic activity, closely related to surface segregation, has sparked extensive research. Most studies have focused on understanding surface and subsurface structures and electronic properties under vacuum conditions. However, catalytic reactions like the ORR occur under environments with various adsorbates, which can influence surface segregation trends and change the surface composition of alloys. Therefore, studying the segregation trend of Pt-based alloys under surface adsorption is critical for understanding their catalytic properties and performance in various applications.

The stability and surface segregation tendencies of PdRu/Ru(0001) and PtRu/Ru(0001) surface alloys were studied using scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and Auger electron spectroscopy (AES). The results showed that after Ru deposition and subsequent re-alloying, the original surface alloy composition was almost completely restored, indicating that the buried Pd and Pt almost completely segregated to the surface layer. There was a slight loss of Pt during the re-alloying step. The slight differences in the stability of the surface alloy may be due to the lower Pd content (44%) in the surface alloy compared to Pt (70%). The preference for surface segregation of a metal atom dissolved in a host metal is related to the difference in surface energies of the two species and the difference in the optimal nearest-neighbor distances of host and guest metal. The surface energies decrease in the order Ru(0001) (1.31.6 eVatom1), Pt(111) (1 eVatom1) and Pd(111) (0.8 eVatom1), which is in good agreement with the observed tendency for segregation of Pt and Pd. The size mismatch of the larger guest metals Pt (0.277 nm) and Pd (0.275 nm) compared to the Ru(0001) single crystal (0.270 nm) would favor the inclusion of the impurity metals in the tensile stressed outermost Ru layer, providing additional driving force for surface segregation. The floating behavior was studied by following the variation in the surface morphology and structure during a series of four preparation steps: deposition of Pt (Pd) on Ru(0001), surface alloy formation by annealing, deposition of Ru on the surface alloy at 500 K, and re-alloying by annealing. The probability that a small amount of Pt (Pd) on Ru(0001) is dissolved in the subsurface region (buried by a layer of substrate material) during surface alloy formation can be estimated by a simple Boltzmann approach. The observation of a distinct bilayer island growth of Ru on the Pt0.70Ru0.30/Ru(0001) surface alloy at 500 K, in contrast to the layer-by-layer Ru growth on Pd0.44Ru0.56/Ru(0001) under similar growth conditions, may be attributed to the lower Pd content, the different 2D distribution of the components in the latter surface alloy with more Ru3 surface sites as compared to Pt0.70Ru0.30/Ru(0001), or to a less pronounced difference between RuRu bonding and RuPd bonding.

The study uses density functional theory to investigate oxygen adsorption and its impact on surface segregation in Pt(shell)/M(core) and Pt3M (M = Co, Ir) alloys on (211) surfaces. Oxygen adsorbs most favorably at the bridge site over and parallel to the (100) step. Surface segregation is observed in Pt3Co, Pt3Ir, and Pt/Co(core) systems. The Pt/Ir(core) structure exhibits antisegregation behavior even when oxygen is adsorbed. The arrangement of atoms in the first 23 layers of the catalyst surface significantly affects the catalytic activity of alloys, and surface segregation plays a crucial role in this. Characterizing the surface atomic distribution and understanding the effect of segregation on surface structure are important for catalytic alloys.

Thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions significantly influence the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems such as Pt-3d alloys. The lower surface free energy of Au compared to Pt makes it energetically favorable for Au to remain at the surface when Au is deposited on top of Pt. The immiscibility of Au and Pt at Au compositions greater than 17% also suggests that Au should remain on top of the Pt clusters. The adsorption of CO on the PtAu clusters at room temperature promotes the diffusion of Pt to the surface of the clusters, and this phenomenon is most pronounced for the clusters that are initially pure Au at the surface. Density functional theory calculations demonstrate that it is thermodynamically favorable for Pt to diffuse to the cluster surface in order to bind to CO. For CO oxidation, the first step in the reaction is the dissociation of O2 at Pt sites. Since this process requires more than one contiguous Pt site, it is not surprising that O2 dissociation cannot occur on the PtAu clusters that are 100% Au at the surface before CO exposure, given the low probability for ensembles of Pt sites to form at the surface. In contrast, CO oxidation does not occur at the cluster surfaces that are initially pure Au, presumably because the first step in the oxidation process is O2 dissociation, which requires neighboring Pt sites. These factors have consequent implications for the catalytic properties and performance of bimetallic catalysts in various applications.

The stability of Pt3dPt subsurface structures in various conditions is a critical factor in their catalytic properties and performance. These structures are desirable in heterogeneous catalysis and electrocatalysis. DFT predictions indicate that these structures are stable in vacuum and with adsorbed hydrogen, but with adsorbed oxygen, the 3d atoms should segregate to the surface. These predictions have been experimentally verified on selected Pt3dPt(111) systems and expanded to polycrystalline Pt to understand the effects of multiple crystal facets on the kinetic barriers for the segregation of subsurface 3d atoms. The Pt3dPt subsurface structures are predicted to have higher activation barriers for oxygen-induced segregation compared to the respective Pt3dPt(111) configuration. The PtNiPt system is the most resistant to oxygen-induced segregation, while the PtTiPt configuration is the most susceptible. The stability of these structures in vacuum and with adsorbed hydrogen and oxygen has been demonstrated through DFT calculations and experimental verification on both single crystal Pt(111) and polycrystalline Pt foil. Using combined theoretical and experimental approaches, the relative stability of surface and subsurface bimetallic structures can be quantified and general trends predicted. The difference in the occupied d-band center, Δεd, can be used to screen potential bimetallic alloys with desirable stability in different environments. A BrnstedEvansPolanyi relationship has been derived to correlate thermodynamic stability from DFT calculations with kinetic barriers from experimental measurements for the Pt3dPt systems. Empirical equations have been developed to predict the thermodynamic stability of other bimetallic systems in various conditions. The large difference in binding energies between surface and subsurface structures highlights the need to understand their stability in reacting environments. For Pt3d bimetallic systems, the difference in oxygen binding energy for these configurations is on the order of hundreds of kcal/mol. Based on Sabatier's principle, if a subsurface alloy structure exhibits optimal binding properties for dehydrogenation and ORR, the surface structure would likely bind intermediates too strongly, halting the reaction. Conversely, if the surface alloy structure exhibits optimal binding properties for steam reforming, the subsurface structure would bind adsorbates too weakly, preventing the reaction from proceeding. The stability of bimetallic structures has been considered with various atomic species, which can be extended to more complex adsorbates using scaling relationships. DFT results predict that subsurface PtMPt(111) configurations are preferred in vacuum and with 0.5 ML H, while surface MPtPt(111) configurations are preferred with 0.5 ML O. Experimental measurements have verified the predicted segregation of subsurface 3d atoms in the presence of oxygen and quantified the activation barrier for adsorbate-induced segregation. AES results suggest two regions of segregation, revealing that DFT predictions and experimental measurements on single crystal bimetallic surfaces are applicable to polycrystalline substrates, bridging the materials gap. Predictions show that all Pt3dPt(100) structures have a higher activation barrier for oxygen-induced segregation compared to respective Pt3dPt(111) configurations. Linear trends in all systems show that the correlation of thermodynamic stability with the difference in d-band center can be used beyond Pt3d alloys. Switching the admetal/host component shifts the absolute driving potential of the segregation. This general stability trend predicts that all bimetallic systems have the same thermodynamically preferred configuration in each environment, with subsurface configurations preferred in vacuum and with 0.5 ML H, and surface configurations favored with 0.5 ML O.

The thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions influence the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems such as Pt-3d alloys. The simulation results showed that the Pd atoms would segregate into the outermost layers of the extended surfaces and the Pt concentration would increase monotonically from the extended surfaces into the bulk. The equilibrium PtPd nanoparticles were found to have Pd-enriched shells and Pt-enriched cores. In the shell of the PtPd nanoparticles, the Pd atoms were predicted to preferably segregate to the (100) facets rather than the (111) facets. These phenomena have consequent implications for their catalytic properties and performance in various applications.

The stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems such as Pt-3d alloys, are influenced by thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions. The dissolution of Fe atoms in a PtFe alloy under specific conditions leads to the formation of a Pt skin layer with predominantly (111)-oriented facets. This process is investigated using in situ electrochemical scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) in a 0.1 M HClO4 solution. The potential cycles applied to the PtFe film result in increased dissolution of Fe and the rearrangement of Pt at the surface, forming a protective Pt skin layer. This layer protects the underlying PtFe alloy from corrosion, which has implications for the catalytic properties and performance of the alloy in fuel cell applications. Further studies on the Pt skin layer, such as the adsorption and oxidation of CO, are being conducted to better understand its electrocatalytic behavior.

The literature does not provide specific information on how thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions influence the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems such as Pt-3d alloys, and what are the consequent implications for their catalytic properties and performance in various applications. However, it does mention that the design of high performance cathode electrocatalysts is essential for polymer electrolyte fuel cells, and that the enhancement of electrocatalytic activity of Pt by alloying with Fe results in a maximum activity at ca. 50% Fe content, which is 25 times higher than pure Pt activity. The enhancement could be well explained by the 5d-vacancy of the surface, but not by Pt interatomic distance or roughening of the surfaces.

The stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems such as Pt-3d alloys, are influenced by thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions. Platinum is a popular cathode electrocatalyst in PEM fuel cells, but its slow kinetics for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) limits catalytic efficiency. In recent years, Pt-based alloys, which include Pt and other transition metals, have been extensively studied due to their enhanced ORR activity. Surface segregation plays a key role in this process, leading to the formation of a pure Pt-skin in the outermost layer of the alloys. This surface segregation is closely related to the enhanced stability of Pt-based catalysts. Au shows strong surface segregation in PtAu alloys, whereas Co is usually unable to enrich PtCo alloy surfaces. The process of Au segregating from the second layer to the surface is exothermic, indicating that Au surface segregation is thermodynamically favorable. However, for the PtCo alloy, the surface Co atoms have a stronger tendency to migrate to the second layer, making the continuous segregation of Co unlikely. Therefore, Co segregating to the clean Pt(111) surface is both thermodynamically unfavorable and kinetically prohibitive. Surface segregation has been found to play a key role in the process of Pt-based alloys. For instance, Stamenkovic et al. found that the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is uniquely active on Pt-skin surfaces, and the reaction rate is four times that of the pure Pt catalyst. Numerous studies have been carried out using modern experimental and computational techniques to understand the importance of surface segregation for Pt-based alloys. For many Pt alloy systems, segregation trends have been unambiguously identified, and the components of surface and subsurface regions have successfully been characterized. The dissolution of metal atoms results in some defects on the alloy surface, which are critical to the rearrangement process. The phenomenon can also be observed in acidic solution, often with dissolution of the alloyed metal and rearrangement of Pt atoms. The segregation process includes interlayer migration of the impurity atom, vacancy movement at the second layer, and vacancy regeneration at the surface layer. The segregation model can successfully interpret these phenomena, particularly from a kinetics viewpoint. The pathway from 1 to 4 describes a complete cycle in which an impurity atom in the second layer segregates to the Pt(111) surface. The process is exothermic for the PtAu system, whereas it is endothermic for the PtCo system. Therefore, Co segregating to the clean Pt(111) surface is both thermodynamically unfavorable and kinetically prohibitive according to the model.

The thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions significantly influence the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems such as Pt-3d alloys. The introduction of 3d metals into the Pt(111) system considerably alters the surface adsorption properties, which can be considerably modified by the 3d metals. The electronic structure of the surface Pt atoms only differs very slightly for the segregated and nonsegregated alloys. The discrepant adsorption properties are therefore mainly attributed to the direct involvement of 3d metals either on the surface or in the subsurface. The stability of Pt atoms of Pt-skin surfaces of the three alloys is enhanced with respect to those in pure Pt surfaces. Such stability enhancement is observed both in clean surfaces and under 0.25 ML of adsorbed atomic oxygen, and the degree of stability enhancement follows the opposite order of the oxygen adsorption strengths in the three studied alloys, indicating the protective role of the 3d subsurface atoms determined by their strong binding to the Pt surface layer. The presence of 3d metals in the alloys modifies the electronic and geometric properties, altering the binding strength of adsorbates. This can lead to enhanced catalytic properties and performance in various applications, such as increased oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) rate and improved electrochemical stability against dissolution. The formation of a Pt-skin layer on the surface of Pt-3d alloys, accompanied by a Pt-depleted layer underneath, is a result of surface segregation that can facilitate the removal of adsorbed species, increasing the ORR rate. The stability enhancement of Pt-skin surfaces is associated with a positive potential shift, indicating that the dissolution of Pt atoms is delayed to higher potentials. The presence of adsorbates, such as oxygen, can affect the stability of the catalysts, but Pt-skin surfaces from the alloys still show enhanced stability compared to pure Pt under adsorbate coverage.

The literature does not provide specific information on how thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions influence the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems such as Pt-3d alloys, and the consequent implications for their catalytic properties and performance in various applications. However, it does discuss the effects of annealing temperature on the structural and chemical properties of bimetallic PtRu/Ru(0001) surfaces, which can be related to the broader question. The study shows that annealing leads to changes in the surface morphology from Pt islands on the Ru substrate to a PtRu/Ru(0001) surface alloy, which significantly alters the adsorption properties of the surface. This can be attributed to changes in the composition of the adsorption ensembles and electronic interactions between the metallic constituents upon alloy formation. These changes have implications for the catalytic properties of the surface, as they can affect the activity and selectivity of the catalyst. The literature also discusses the structural and chemical properties of bimetallic PtRu/Ru(0001) model catalysts and their modification upon stepwise annealing of a submonolayer Pt-covered Ru(0001) surface up to the formation of an equilibrated PtxRu1-x/Ru(0001) monolayer surface alloy. The study reveals that the surface structure significantly affects the adsorption properties of the bimetallic surface, which can be explained by changes in the composition of the adsorption ensembles (ensemble effects) for D adsorption and by changes in the electronic interaction (ligand effects, strain effects) of the metallic constituents for CO and D adsorption upon alloy formation. The surface structure and distribution of the components in the topmost layer are accessible by scanning tunneling microscopy (STM), and that the adsorption properties of the bimetallic surface can be explained by changes of the composition of the adsorption ensembles (ensemble effects) for D adsorption and by changes in the electronic interaction (ligand effects, strain effects) of the metallic constituents for CO and D adsorption upon alloy formation. The study reveals that the surface structure significantly affects the adsorption properties of the bimetallic surface, which can be explained by changes in the composition of the adsorption ensembles (ensemble effects) for D adsorption and by changes in the electronic interaction (ligand effects, strain effects) of the metallic constituents for CO and D adsorption upon alloy formation. The study shows that annealing leads to changes in the surface morphology from Pt islands on the Ru substrate to PtRu/Ru(0001) surface alloys, inducing significant changes in the adsorption properties of CO and deuterium. These changes can be attributed to ensemble effects for D adsorption and electronic interaction effects for CO and D adsorption upon alloy formation. The results demonstrate the sensitivity of probe molecule adsorption to the local structure and composition of a bimetallic surface, even for a combination of two chemically active metals such as Ru and Pt.

The stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems such as Pt-3d alloys, are influenced by thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions. Surface segregation, where one metal species enriches the surface or the first sub-surface layers over other components, has significant implications for materials science and surface chemistry. It affects physical and chemical properties such as permeation, surface adsorption, crystal growth, and metal corrosion. Notably, the catalytic activities of alloys can be dramatically altered through surface segregation. Pt, an efficient catalyst used in important chemical reactions like methanol oxidation and hydrocarbon reforming, is the most widely used electrocatalyst for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in fuel cells. Efforts to find alternative catalysts to Pt have focused on Pt-based bimetallic alloys, where some platinum is replaced by less expensive metals. The catalytic properties of these alloys are determined by the surface geometry and electronic structure, which can be modified by the chemical composition, leading to improved catalytic effects when appropriate structures are achieved. Enhanced ORR activities have been observed in Pt alloys with 3d metals, with surface segregation playing a key role. For example, Stamenkovic et al. found that the ORR on Pt-skin structures produced by Pt segregating on the surface of annealed Pt3Co alloys is uniquely active, with a reaction rate four times that of pure Pt. The enhanced activities can be attributed to the surface electronic structure and surface bond length of alloy systems. The surface geometry can considerably alter catalytic efficiency, but for Pt3Co (1 1 1) and Pt3Ni (1 1 1) systems, the maximum deviation of the surface bond length after Pt segregation is only 0.002 Å, indicating that the geometric effect does not contribute to the enhanced ORR activities of Pt-skin surfaces. Instead, the electronic structures modified through surface segregation are the main factor for such enhancement. Theoretical approaches can help to elucidate the driving force and the tendency of this phenomenon. Surface segregation is also governed by temperature and by the presence of adsorbates.

The literature does not provide specific information on how thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions influence the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems such as Pt-3d alloys, and the consequent implications for their catalytic properties and performance in various applications. However, it does discuss the growth of silver on a Pt(1 0 0) surface and the evolution of the structure with increasing temperature, which can be related to the stability and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts. At room temperature, the formation of elongated 2D-adislands with a composition of Ag80Pt20 was observed. Annealing of the sample above 600 K causes more extensive alloying starting at the perimeter of the Ag adislands by AgPt exchange and formation of a nanophasic AgPt alloy confined to the surface layer. With sufficient Ag, this alloy spreads across the surface until a uniform stoichiometry is established over the entire surface. Temperature-dependent AES studies indicate that there is some mixing of Ag with bulk Pt at elevated temperatures. These findings suggest that the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts can be influenced by thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions, which in turn can affect their catalytic properties and performance in various applications.

Ternary alloys have a strong tendency for platinum surface segregation, forming a platinum monolayer on their surfaces. This top platinum monolayer results in relatively weaker binding strengths of oxygen and hydroxyl groups in the ternary alloys, indicating enhanced activity for the oxygen reduction reaction compared to bimetallic alloy surfaces. Additionally, the platinum-skin surfaces of ternary alloys exhibit improved electrochemical stability against the dissolution of platinum atoms from the alloy surface.

The stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems such as Pt-3d alloys, are influenced by thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions. Some near-surface alloys (NSAs) bind atomic hydrogen as weakly as noble metals while dissociating H2 more easily, which is beneficial for hydrogen-related reactions. Hydrogen chemistry on NSAs is crucial for many chemical and pharmaceutical processes. Density functional theory calculations are used to develop new NSAs for these processes. Selected NSAs allow weak hydrogen binding and low H2 dissociation barriers, which is an exception to the general rule. The lowering of the transition-state energy is observed even on non-ideal NSAs, although the effect is less pronounced. NSAs promise high hydrogenation activity at low temperatures, which is beneficial for the production of chiral pharmaceutical compounds and could potentially permit easier separation and storage of hydrogen. The stability of near-surface alloys (NSAs) can be assessed using a two-step procedure: first, considering the composition in vacuum, and then accounting for the effects of hydrogen adsorption. Adsorbates can draw to the surface components of alloys to which they bind strongly. The tendency of hydrogen to induce surface segregation can be estimated by comparing the segregation energy (Eseg) of the solute to the difference in the magnitudes of the hydrogen binding energies between the pure solute and the pure host. Real NSAs may differ from idealized models, but these deviations do not substantially affect the main trends in adsorbate behavior. Some experimental studies have shown significantly modified catalytic activity on non-ideal NSAs, in line with theoretical predictions.

The thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions can influence the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems such as Pt-3d alloys. The addition of a third transition metal element M can modify the driving energy for Pt segregation to the outermost layer of Pt3Ni (111) surface. Transition metals V, Fe, Co, Mo, Tc, Ru, W, Re, Os, and Ir were predicted to lead to even more negative Pt surface segregation energies than that in the based Pt3Ni (111) surface, further promoting Pt surface segregation. In contrast, doping transition metals Ag, Au, and Pd would lead to positive segregation energies and hence suppress the Pt surface segregation in the corresponding Pt3Ni/M (111) surface. The surface energy effect, strain effect, and heat of solution effect induced by the doped element M would collectively affect the Pt surface segregation energy in the Pt3Ni/M (111) surfaces. The extent of Pt surface segregation is determined by the relative Pt surface segregation energy, lattice mismatch, and heat of solution of the Pt3M crystal with respect to those of the Pt3Ni crystal. Replacing Ni with transition metals V, Fe, Co, Mo, Tc, Ru, W, Re, Os, and Ir would lead to even stronger Pt segregation extent to the surface while replacing Ni with transition metals Ag, Au, and Pd could completely prohibit Pt segregating to the surface.

The stability of Pt-based alloys, such as Pt-3d alloys, is influenced by the oxygen coverage under electrochemical conditions. Alloys are generally less stable than pure Pt at the same oxygen coverage. Maintaining zero oxygen coverage at working potentials is crucial for achieving both high activity and stability. The stability of clean alloy surfaces can be inferred from the calculated Pt d-band structure, which shows that alloying generally leads to the stabilization of the Pt d-band, making surface Pt atoms more difficult to segregate or dissolve. However, in the presence of adsorbed O atoms, the removal of Pt is facilitated because the surface vacancy can be more strongly stabilized by O atoms. This is due to the fact that Pt atoms at the surface vacancy are less coordinated and possess more active d-states, which can more strongly bond with O atoms compared to terrace Pt atoms. Additionally, with the exposure of the second layer atoms at the surface vacancy, it is possible to form a much stronger OM bond compared to the OPt bond. This is observed in the search for the optimum structure after a Pt removal, which shows that the surface vacancy is preferentially terminated by O atoms that sink to bond with the solute M atoms at the second layer. For example, in Pt2Ti skin alloys, the surface vacancies with a configuration containing OTi bonding are much more stable than those with only OPt bonding. This is consistent with the fact that atomic O on metals is anion-like, with a strong tendency to accept electrons, and prefers to form ionic-bonds. The stability of Pt alloys under electrochemical conditions is generally lower than that of pure Pt when the oxygen coverage is the same, and maintaining zero oxygen coverage at working potentials (such as 0.9 V) is crucial for achieving both high activity and stability. Among more than 20 different Pt2M alloys, molybdenum (Mo) is identified as a good element that can alloy with Pt to form a stable surface at high electrochemical potentials. Pt2Mo has a lower kinetic barrier for oxygen reduction (OR) compared to Pt, and the barrier to OOH dissociation is a key kinetic parameter for OR activity. The higher stability of clean alloy surfaces can indeed be inferred from the calculated Pt d-band structure, which shows that alloying generally leads to the stabilization of the Pt d-band, making surface Pt atoms more difficult to segregate or dissolve. The stability of surfaces follows the order Pt2Mo > Pt > Pt2Ag > Pt2Pd > Pt2Nb > Pt2Ti > Pt2Sc > Pt2Zr, and only Pt2Mo exhibits higher stability than pure Pt at high potential (1.05 V). The oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) on a Pt2Mo alloy surface follows a similar reaction profile as on Pt, with the transition state (TS) for OOH dissociation determining the height of the potential profile. The TSs for OOH dissociation and O2 dissociation dictate the highest free energy positions in the reaction pathways. The aqueous environment, together with the in situ oxygen coverage, plays an important role in facilitating the ORR on alloy surfaces. The stability of PtxMo alloys drops quickly with increasing potential, in line with the rapid increase of surface oxygen coverage for PtxMo surfaces above 0.9 V. The Pt2Mo skin alloy achieves the best balance of stability and activity. A low Mo content (below 30%, e.g., Pt5Mo) may achieve a higher stability at high potentials, but the activity is not better than Pt at 0.9 V, while a high Mo content (above 30%, e.g., PtMo) will start to destabilize the alloy and also reduce the activity.

The stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems such as CuPt near-surface alloys, are influenced by thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions. CO adsorption at elevated pressures and temperatures can pull the less reactive Cu to the surface, driven by the formation of a stable self-organized CO/CuPt surface alloy structure. This is rationalized by the significantly stronger PtCO bond when Cu is present in the first surface layer of Pt. The results suggest new possibilities for selective and dynamical engineering of alloy surfaces for catalysis, with implications for catalytic properties and performance in various applications, including water-gas shift reactions. DFT calculations confirm the observed Cu surface segregation and the weakening of the PtCO bond with increasing Cu content in the second layer. The onset of bulk migration of Cu is explained by the results with adsorbed CO, and the interdiffusion of Cu and Pt becomes significant at 460 K, where the formation and breakup of the stable CO-induced surface alloy start to occur. The results add to the promise of using molecular adsorbate-induced surface changes as a tool for selective and dynamical engineering of alloy surfaces, likely extending to a wide variety of coinage (Cu, Ag)/Pt-group bimetallic surface alloys.
The stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems such as Pt-3d alloys, are influenced by thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions. Contrary to expectations, CO adsorption at elevated pressures and temperatures can pull the less reactive Cu to the surface of a CuPt near-surface alloy, forming a stable self-organized CO/CuPt surface alloy structure. This is due to the significantly stronger PtCO bond when Cu is present in the first surface layer of Pt. The findings suggest new possibilities for selective and dynamical engineering of alloy surfaces for catalysis, potentially applicable to a range of coinage (Cu, Ag)/Pt-group bimetallic surface alloys.

This is due to the drastically stronger PtCO bond when Cu is present in the first surface layer of Pt. The results are expected to apply to a range of coinage (Cu, Ag)/Pt-group bimetallic surface alloys. The bonding of adsorbates can induce changes in local atomic composition and surface structure, changing the activity and selectivity of the catalyst. The CuPt near-surface alloy (NSA) was suggested as a promising water-gas shift catalyst because of reduced PtCO bonding on a Pt catalyst surface with Cu present in the second layer. However, the NSA is unstable at elevated CO pressures and sample temperatures, forming instead a self-organized CO/CuPt surface alloy (SA) structure. The results are confirmed by extended density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Although Cu diffusion to the first layer is endothermic, the drastic increase in CO binding energy more than compensates for the endothermicity. The vastly increased PtCO bond strength when 2/3 ML of Cu is present in the first layer rationalizes the observed Cu surface segregation. The calculated higher stability of the CuPt SA compared with Cu in the bulk with CO adsorption on clean Pt(111) is nearly equal to the free-energy difference (ΔG). The interdiffusion of Cu and Pt becomes significant at 460 K, and the formation and breakup of the stable CO-induced surface alloy start to occur at this temperature. The DFT calculations reproduce the experimental observations and confirm the rationalization of the observed Cu surface segregation. The results for the CuPt system at elevated temperatures and CO pressures, where a novel stable CO-induced surface alloy forms, likely extend to a wide variety of coinage (Cu, Ag)/Pt-group bimetallic surface alloys.
The stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems such as Pt-3d alloys, are influenced by thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions.

The thermodynamics and kinetics of oxygen-induced segregation of 3d metals in Pt-based systems, such as Pt-3d alloys, are influenced by factors including the crystal plane, which affects the stability of subsurface 3d metals. This has implications for the catalytic properties and performance of bimetallic catalysts in various applications, particularly in oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activity. The stability of subsurface 3d metals in Pt(111) and Pt(100) under oxygen exposure is predicted through Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations. The crystal plane has an effect on the subsurface stability of the bimetallic catalysts. These factors influence the surface segregation and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, which in turn affect their catalytic properties and performance in various applications.

The thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions significantly influence the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems such as Pt-3d alloys. Bimetallic catalysts exhibit greater surface structural complexity compared to monometallic catalysts, with the second metal, in either its metallic or oxidized state, being present on the surface, in the near-surface region, or embedded in the bulk region. The surface structure of bimetallic catalysts is crucial to their catalytic properties. For instance, Pt-based bimetallic catalysts with Pt-skin surfaces and 3d transition metals in the subsurface region demonstrate superior catalytic performance in many reactions compared to pure Pt surfaces. The structure of the catalyst surface often changes dynamically during reactions, similar to reversible surface processes observed in monometallic catalyst systems when the gaseous environment shifts between reductive and oxidative conditions. Bimetallic catalysts may exhibit a similar dependence of surface structure on the redox potential of reaction gases, providing an opportunity to adjust catalytic activity and selectivity.

The stability of bimetallic surface structures under reaction conditions is a critical factor in bimetallic catalysis, as it can modify catalytic properties. For example, under annealing conditions, the subsurface PtNiPt(111) structure is more thermodynamically stable than the surface NiPtPt(111) structure in vacuum. Pt3d alloys in fuel cell applications often have a Pt skin, indicating a thermodynamic preference for Pt-terminated bimetallic surfaces. The segregation energy (Eseg) determines whether the admetal segregates to the surface or remains in the subsurface, affecting the surface composition. Hydrogen-induced segregation is influenced by Eseg and the difference in hydrogen-binding energies on the surface and subsurface. Oxygen can destabilize the subsurface structure, driving subsurface 3d metals to segregate to the surface. Adsorbates with weak Pauling electronegativity have a small effect on the thermodynamic potential for interchanging surface and subsurface configurations, while those with strong Pauling electronegativity can significantly alter binding energy, leading to surface segregation when their coverage is high enough. Oxygen-induced surface segregation is also predicted for specific Pt-based alloy surfaces.

The thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions significantly influence the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems such as Pt-3d alloys. Under reductive conditions, such as vacuum and carbon monoxide, 3d transition metals prefer to occupy the subsurface layer due to their higher surface energy and smaller atomic size. However, under oxidizing conditions, the strong interaction between oxygen and 3d transition metals induces their segregation to the surface, leading to the formation of oxidized 3d transition metal islands. These structural changes have profound implications for the catalytic properties and performance of these materials in various applications. For instance, Pt(111) surfaces with atomic dispersed 3d transition metals in the surface layers exhibit high activity for CO oxidation through a bi-functional mechanism. The interplay between the structure, reaction environment, and catalytic activity is a critical factor in determining the performance of alloy catalysts.

The surface structures of PtNi, PtCo, and PtCu bimetallic catalysts exhibit reversible changes in response to the redox potential of the environmental gas. These changes can be controlled by treating the catalysts in various gases. Surface segregation is a common phenomenon in bimetallic surfaces, where a metal with a larger atomic radius tends to segregate to the surface to release strain. Platinum, with its larger atomic radius compared to cobalt, nickel, and copper, is more likely to segregate to the surface. The presence of hydrogen does not alter the thermodynamic driving force for surface segregation. Oxygen adsorption on Pt-M catalyst surfaces can induce the segregation of 3d transition metals to the top surface due to the strong bonding between oxygen and 3d transition metals. In oxidative environments, 3d transition metals can become oxidized, and the formed oxides tend to encapsulate platinum surfaces. The mass transport processes that occur during oxidation or reduction reactions are fully reversible, depending on the redox potential of the reaction gases. The reversible structural changes in Pt-based bimetallic catalysts have significant implications for real catalytic processes.

The stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems such as Pt-3d alloys, are influenced by thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions. Fe-Pt catalysts have been used in the preferential oxidation (PROX) of CO in excess H2, achieving high selectivity for CO oxidation. Pt-skin structures show high activity for catalyzing the hydrogenation of unsaturated hydrocarbons. The unique catalytic properties of the Pt-skin surfaces are attributed to the modification of the electronic structure of the surface Pt by the subsurface Fe underneath, influencing the adsorption and reaction characteristics of the surface species. The controlled preparation of various Fe-Pt surface structures allows for the derivation of the relationship between structure and catalytic properties, aiding in the design of high-performance and low-cost catalysts. The stability of the Pt-skin structure can be reduced under certain circumstances, such as an oxidative environment, leading to gas-induced Fe surface segregation. The structural configuration of the catalyst can be transformed between surface Fe or FeO and subsurface Fe on the Pt(111) surface by cycles of oxidation and reduction. These transformations have implications for the catalytic properties and performance of the catalysts in various applications, including oxygen reduction reactions, hydrogenation of unsaturated hydrocarbons, and the preferential oxidation of CO in excess H2. Depending on the preparation procedures and reaction conditions, Fe overlayers with either metallic or oxidized states may be present as the topmost surface or in the subsurface region of Pt. Different reactions can produce different Fe-Pt surface structural configurations. For oxygen reduction reactions (ORR), Pt-skin structures with Fe or some other transition metals in the subsurface regions showed a higher activity than pure Pt. For instance, Fe49Pt51 alloys with 100% Pt as the topmost layer had 25 times the activity of pure Pt catalysts in ORR. The optimization of the performance of Fe-Pt structures in magnetism and catalysis places a high demand on the design and control of the surface structural configurations and needs information on the stability of the various structures at elevated temperatures and under different reaction atmospheres.

Surface segregation in bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems such as Pt-3d alloys, is influenced by thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions. This phenomenon is crucial in materials science, catalysis, and surface chemistry, affecting properties like permeation, surface adsorption, crystal growth, and metal corrosion. Surface segregation can significantly alter the catalytic activities of alloys, as evidenced by enhanced oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activities in Pt alloys with 3d metals compared to pure Pt. The unusual catalytic activity, closely related to surface segregation, has sparked extensive research. Most studies have focused on understanding surface and subsurface structures and electronic properties under vacuum conditions. However, catalytic reactions like the ORR occur under environments with various adsorbates, which can influence surface segregation trends and change the surface composition of alloys. Therefore, studying the segregation trend of Pt-based alloys under surface adsorption is critical for understanding their catalytic properties and performance in various applications.

The stability and surface segregation tendencies of PdRu/Ru(0001) and PtRu/Ru(0001) surface alloys were studied using scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and Auger electron spectroscopy (AES). The results showed that after Ru deposition and subsequent re-alloying, the original surface alloy composition was almost completely restored, indicating that the buried Pd and Pt almost completely segregated to the surface layer. There was a slight loss of Pt during the re-alloying step. The slight differences in the stability of the surface alloy may be due to the lower Pd content (44%) in the surface alloy compared to Pt (70%). The preference for surface segregation of a metal atom dissolved in a host metal is related to the difference in surface energies of the two species and the difference in the optimal nearest-neighbor distances of host and guest metal. The surface energies decrease in the order Ru(0001) (1.31.6 eVatom1), Pt(111) (1 eVatom1) and Pd(111) (0.8 eVatom1), which is in good agreement with the observed tendency for segregation of Pt and Pd. The size mismatch of the larger guest metals Pt (0.277 nm) and Pd (0.275 nm) compared to the Ru(0001) single crystal (0.270 nm) would favor the inclusion of the impurity metals in the tensile stressed outermost Ru layer, providing additional driving force for surface segregation. The floating behavior was studied by following the variation in the surface morphology and structure during a series of four preparation steps: deposition of Pt (Pd) on Ru(0001), surface alloy formation by annealing, deposition of Ru on the surface alloy at 500 K, and re-alloying by annealing. The probability that a small amount of Pt (Pd) on Ru(0001) is dissolved in the subsurface region (buried by a layer of substrate material) during surface alloy formation can be estimated by a simple Boltzmann approach. The observation of a distinct bilayer island growth of Ru on the Pt0.70Ru0.30/Ru(0001) surface alloy at 500 K, in contrast to the layer-by-layer Ru growth on Pd0.44Ru0.56/Ru(0001) under similar growth conditions, may be attributed to the lower Pd content, the different 2D distribution of the components in the latter surface alloy with more Ru3 surface sites as compared to Pt0.70Ru0.30/Ru(0001), or to a less pronounced difference between RuRu bonding and RuPd bonding.

The study uses density functional theory to investigate oxygen adsorption and its impact on surface segregation in Pt(shell)/M(core) and Pt3M (M = Co, Ir) alloys on (211) surfaces. Oxygen adsorbs most favorably at the bridge site over and parallel to the (100) step. Surface segregation is observed in Pt3Co, Pt3Ir, and Pt/Co(core) systems. The Pt/Ir(core) structure exhibits antisegregation behavior even when oxygen is adsorbed. The arrangement of atoms in the first 23 layers of the catalyst surface significantly affects the catalytic activity of alloys, and surface segregation plays a crucial role in this. Characterizing the surface atomic distribution and understanding the effect of segregation on surface structure are important for catalytic alloys.

Thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions significantly influence the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems such as Pt-3d alloys. The lower surface free energy of Au compared to Pt makes it energetically favorable for Au to remain at the surface when Au is deposited on top of Pt. The immiscibility of Au and Pt at Au compositions greater than 17% also suggests that Au should remain on top of the Pt clusters. The adsorption of CO on the PtAu clusters at room temperature promotes the diffusion of Pt to the surface of the clusters, and this phenomenon is most pronounced for the clusters that are initially pure Au at the surface. Density functional theory calculations demonstrate that it is thermodynamically favorable for Pt to diffuse to the cluster surface in order to bind to CO. For CO oxidation, the first step in the reaction is the dissociation of O2 at Pt sites. Since this process requires more than one contiguous Pt site, it is not surprising that O2 dissociation cannot occur on the PtAu clusters that are 100% Au at the surface before CO exposure, given the low probability for ensembles of Pt sites to form at the surface. In contrast, CO oxidation does not occur at the cluster surfaces that are initially pure Au, presumably because the first step in the oxidation process is O2 dissociation, which requires neighboring Pt sites. These factors have consequent implications for the catalytic properties and performance of bimetallic catalysts in various applications.

The stability of Pt3dPt subsurface structures in various conditions is a critical factor in their catalytic properties and performance. These structures are desirable in heterogeneous catalysis and electrocatalysis. DFT predictions indicate that these structures are stable in vacuum and with adsorbed hydrogen, but with adsorbed oxygen, the 3d atoms should segregate to the surface. These predictions have been experimentally verified on selected Pt3dPt(111) systems and expanded to polycrystalline Pt to understand the effects of multiple crystal facets on the kinetic barriers for the segregation of subsurface 3d atoms. The Pt3dPt subsurface structures are predicted to have higher activation barriers for oxygen-induced segregation compared to the respective Pt3dPt(111) configuration. The PtNiPt system is the most resistant to oxygen-induced segregation, while the PtTiPt configuration is the most susceptible. The stability of these structures in vacuum and with adsorbed hydrogen and oxygen has been demonstrated through DFT calculations and experimental verification on both single crystal Pt(111) and polycrystalline Pt foil. Using combined theoretical and experimental approaches, the relative stability of surface and subsurface bimetallic structures can be quantified and general trends predicted. The difference in the occupied d-band center, Δεd, can be used to screen potential bimetallic alloys with desirable stability in different environments. A BrnstedEvansPolanyi relationship has been derived to correlate thermodynamic stability from DFT calculations with kinetic barriers from experimental measurements for the Pt3dPt systems. Empirical equations have been developed to predict the thermodynamic stability of other bimetallic systems in various conditions. The large difference in binding energies between surface and subsurface structures highlights the need to understand their stability in reacting environments. For Pt3d bimetallic systems, the difference in oxygen binding energy for these configurations is on the order of hundreds of kcal/mol. Based on Sabatier's principle, if a subsurface alloy structure exhibits optimal binding properties for dehydrogenation and ORR, the surface structure would likely bind intermediates too strongly, halting the reaction. Conversely, if the surface alloy structure exhibits optimal binding properties for steam reforming, the subsurface structure would bind adsorbates too weakly, preventing the reaction from proceeding. The stability of bimetallic structures has been considered with various atomic species, which can be extended to more complex adsorbates using scaling relationships. DFT results predict that subsurface PtMPt(111) configurations are preferred in vacuum and with 0.5 ML H, while surface MPtPt(111) configurations are preferred with 0.5 ML O. Experimental measurements have verified the predicted segregation of subsurface 3d atoms in the presence of oxygen and quantified the activation barrier for adsorbate-induced segregation. AES results suggest two regions of segregation, revealing that DFT predictions and experimental measurements on single crystal bimetallic surfaces are applicable to polycrystalline substrates, bridging the materials gap. Predictions show that all Pt3dPt(100) structures have a higher activation barrier for oxygen-induced segregation compared to respective Pt3dPt(111) configurations. Linear trends in all systems show that the correlation of thermodynamic stability with the difference in d-band center can be used beyond Pt3d alloys. Switching the admetal/host component shifts the absolute driving potential of the segregation. This general stability trend predicts that all bimetallic systems have the same thermodynamically preferred configuration in each environment, with subsurface configurations preferred in vacuum and with 0.5 ML H, and surface configurations favored with 0.5 ML O.

The thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions influence the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems such as Pt-3d alloys. The simulation results showed that the Pd atoms would segregate into the outermost layers of the extended surfaces and the Pt concentration would increase monotonically from the extended surfaces into the bulk. The equilibrium PtPd nanoparticles were found to have Pd-enriched shells and Pt-enriched cores. In the shell of the PtPd nanoparticles, the Pd atoms were predicted to preferably segregate to the (100) facets rather than the (111) facets. These phenomena have consequent implications for their catalytic properties and performance in various applications.

The stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems such as Pt-3d alloys, are influenced by thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions. The dissolution of Fe atoms in a PtFe alloy under specific conditions leads to the formation of a Pt skin layer with predominantly (111)-oriented facets. This process is investigated using in situ electrochemical scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) in a 0.1 M HClO4 solution. The potential cycles applied to the PtFe film result in increased dissolution of Fe and the rearrangement of Pt at the surface, forming a protective Pt skin layer. This layer protects the underlying PtFe alloy from corrosion, which has implications for the catalytic properties and performance of the alloy in fuel cell applications. Further studies on the Pt skin layer, such as the adsorption and oxidation of CO, are being conducted to better understand its electrocatalytic behavior.

The literature does not provide specific information on how thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions influence the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems such as Pt-3d alloys, and what are the consequent implications for their catalytic properties and performance in various applications. However, it does mention that the design of high performance cathode electrocatalysts is essential for polymer electrolyte fuel cells, and that the enhancement of electrocatalytic activity of Pt by alloying with Fe results in a maximum activity at ca. 50% Fe content, which is 25 times higher than pure Pt activity. The enhancement could be well explained by the 5d-vacancy of the surface, but not by Pt interatomic distance or roughening of the surfaces.

The stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems such as Pt-3d alloys, are influenced by thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions. Platinum is a popular cathode electrocatalyst in PEM fuel cells, but its slow kinetics for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) limits catalytic efficiency. In recent years, Pt-based alloys, which include Pt and other transition metals, have been extensively studied due to their enhanced ORR activity. Surface segregation plays a key role in this process, leading to the formation of a pure Pt-skin in the outermost layer of the alloys. This surface segregation is closely related to the enhanced stability of Pt-based catalysts. Au shows strong surface segregation in PtAu alloys, whereas Co is usually unable to enrich PtCo alloy surfaces. The process of Au segregating from the second layer to the surface is exothermic, indicating that Au surface segregation is thermodynamically favorable. However, for the PtCo alloy, the surface Co atoms have a stronger tendency to migrate to the second layer, making the continuous segregation of Co unlikely. Therefore, Co segregating to the clean Pt(111) surface is both thermodynamically unfavorable and kinetically prohibitive. Surface segregation has been found to play a key role in the process of Pt-based alloys. For instance, Stamenkovic et al. found that the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is uniquely active on Pt-skin surfaces, and the reaction rate is four times that of the pure Pt catalyst. Numerous studies have been carried out using modern experimental and computational techniques to understand the importance of surface segregation for Pt-based alloys. For many Pt alloy systems, segregation trends have been unambiguously identified, and the components of surface and subsurface regions have successfully been characterized. The dissolution of metal atoms results in some defects on the alloy surface, which are critical to the rearrangement process. The phenomenon can also be observed in acidic solution, often with dissolution of the alloyed metal and rearrangement of Pt atoms. The segregation process includes interlayer migration of the impurity atom, vacancy movement at the second layer, and vacancy regeneration at the surface layer. The segregation model can successfully interpret these phenomena, particularly from a kinetics viewpoint. The pathway from 1 to 4 describes a complete cycle in which an impurity atom in the second layer segregates to the Pt(111) surface. The process is exothermic for the PtAu system, whereas it is endothermic for the PtCo system. Therefore, Co segregating to the clean Pt(111) surface is both thermodynamically unfavorable and kinetically prohibitive according to the model.

The thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions significantly influence the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems such as Pt-3d alloys. The introduction of 3d metals into the Pt(111) system considerably alters the surface adsorption properties, which can be considerably modified by the 3d metals. The electronic structure of the surface Pt atoms only differs very slightly for the segregated and nonsegregated alloys. The discrepant adsorption properties are therefore mainly attributed to the direct involvement of 3d metals either on the surface or in the subsurface. The stability of Pt atoms of Pt-skin surfaces of the three alloys is enhanced with respect to those in pure Pt surfaces. Such stability enhancement is observed both in clean surfaces and under 0.25 ML of adsorbed atomic oxygen, and the degree of stability enhancement follows the opposite order of the oxygen adsorption strengths in the three studied alloys, indicating the protective role of the 3d subsurface atoms determined by their strong binding to the Pt surface layer. The presence of 3d metals in the alloys modifies the electronic and geometric properties, altering the binding strength of adsorbates. This can lead to enhanced catalytic properties and performance in various applications, such as increased oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) rate and improved electrochemical stability against dissolution. The formation of a Pt-skin layer on the surface of Pt-3d alloys, accompanied by a Pt-depleted layer underneath, is a result of surface segregation that can facilitate the removal of adsorbed species, increasing the ORR rate. The stability enhancement of Pt-skin surfaces is associated with a positive potential shift, indicating that the dissolution of Pt atoms is delayed to higher potentials. The presence of adsorbates, such as oxygen, can affect the stability of the catalysts, but Pt-skin surfaces from the alloys still show enhanced stability compared to pure Pt under adsorbate coverage.

The literature does not provide specific information on how thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions influence the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems such as Pt-3d alloys, and the consequent implications for their catalytic properties and performance in various applications. However, it does discuss the effects of annealing temperature on the structural and chemical properties of bimetallic PtRu/Ru(0001) surfaces, which can be related to the broader question. The study shows that annealing leads to changes in the surface morphology from Pt islands on the Ru substrate to a PtRu/Ru(0001) surface alloy, which significantly alters the adsorption properties of the surface. This can be attributed to changes in the composition of the adsorption ensembles and electronic interactions between the metallic constituents upon alloy formation. These changes have implications for the catalytic properties of the surface, as they can affect the activity and selectivity of the catalyst. The literature also discusses the structural and chemical properties of bimetallic PtRu/Ru(0001) model catalysts and their modification upon stepwise annealing of a submonolayer Pt-covered Ru(0001) surface up to the formation of an equilibrated PtxRu1-x/Ru(0001) monolayer surface alloy. The study reveals that the surface structure significantly affects the adsorption properties of the bimetallic surface, which can be explained by changes in the composition of the adsorption ensembles (ensemble effects) for D adsorption and by changes in the electronic interaction (ligand effects, strain effects) of the metallic constituents for CO and D adsorption upon alloy formation. The surface structure and distribution of the components in the topmost layer are accessible by scanning tunneling microscopy (STM), and that the adsorption properties of the bimetallic surface can be explained by changes of the composition of the adsorption ensembles (ensemble effects) for D adsorption and by changes in the electronic interaction (ligand effects, strain effects) of the metallic constituents for CO and D adsorption upon alloy formation. The study reveals that the surface structure significantly affects the adsorption properties of the bimetallic surface, which can be explained by changes in the composition of the adsorption ensembles (ensemble effects) for D adsorption and by changes in the electronic interaction (ligand effects, strain effects) of the metallic constituents for CO and D adsorption upon alloy formation. The study shows that annealing leads to changes in the surface morphology from Pt islands on the Ru substrate to PtRu/Ru(0001) surface alloys, inducing significant changes in the adsorption properties of CO and deuterium. These changes can be attributed to ensemble effects for D adsorption and electronic interaction effects for CO and D adsorption upon alloy formation. The results demonstrate the sensitivity of probe molecule adsorption to the local structure and composition of a bimetallic surface, even for a combination of two chemically active metals such as Ru and Pt.

The stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems such as Pt-3d alloys, are influenced by thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions. Surface segregation, where one metal species enriches the surface or the first sub-surface layers over other components, has significant implications for materials science and surface chemistry. It affects physical and chemical properties such as permeation, surface adsorption, crystal growth, and metal corrosion. Notably, the catalytic activities of alloys can be dramatically altered through surface segregation. Pt, an efficient catalyst used in important chemical reactions like methanol oxidation and hydrocarbon reforming, is the most widely used electrocatalyst for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in fuel cells. Efforts to find alternative catalysts to Pt have focused on Pt-based bimetallic alloys, where some platinum is replaced by less expensive metals. The catalytic properties of these alloys are determined by the surface geometry and electronic structure, which can be modified by the chemical composition, leading to improved catalytic effects when appropriate structures are achieved. Enhanced ORR activities have been observed in Pt alloys with 3d metals, with surface segregation playing a key role. For example, Stamenkovic et al. found that the ORR on Pt-skin structures produced by Pt segregating on the surface of annealed Pt3Co alloys is uniquely active, with a reaction rate four times that of pure Pt. The enhanced activities can be attributed to the surface electronic structure and surface bond length of alloy systems. The surface geometry can considerably alter catalytic efficiency, but for Pt3Co (1 1 1) and Pt3Ni (1 1 1) systems, the maximum deviation of the surface bond length after Pt segregation is only 0.002 Å, indicating that the geometric effect does not contribute to the enhanced ORR activities of Pt-skin surfaces. Instead, the electronic structures modified through surface segregation are the main factor for such enhancement. Theoretical approaches can help to elucidate the driving force and the tendency of this phenomenon. Surface segregation is also governed by temperature and by the presence of adsorbates.

The literature does not provide specific information on how thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions influence the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems such as Pt-3d alloys, and the consequent implications for their catalytic properties and performance in various applications. However, it does discuss the growth of silver on a Pt(1 0 0) surface and the evolution of the structure with increasing temperature, which can be related to the stability and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts. At room temperature, the formation of elongated 2D-adislands with a composition of Ag80Pt20 was observed. Annealing of the sample above 600 K causes more extensive alloying starting at the perimeter of the Ag adislands by AgPt exchange and formation of a nanophasic AgPt alloy confined to the surface layer. With sufficient Ag, this alloy spreads across the surface until a uniform stoichiometry is established over the entire surface. Temperature-dependent AES studies indicate that there is some mixing of Ag with bulk Pt at elevated temperatures. These findings suggest that the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts can be influenced by thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions, which in turn can affect their catalytic properties and performance in various applications.

Ternary alloys have a strong tendency for platinum surface segregation, forming a platinum monolayer on their surfaces. This top platinum monolayer results in relatively weaker binding strengths of oxygen and hydroxyl groups in the ternary alloys, indicating enhanced activity for the oxygen reduction reaction compared to bimetallic alloy surfaces. Additionally, the platinum-skin surfaces of ternary alloys exhibit improved electrochemical stability against the dissolution of platinum atoms from the alloy surface.

The stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems such as Pt-3d alloys, are influenced by thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions. Some near-surface alloys (NSAs) bind atomic hydrogen as weakly as noble metals while dissociating H2 more easily, which is beneficial for hydrogen-related reactions. Hydrogen chemistry on NSAs is crucial for many chemical and pharmaceutical processes. Density functional theory calculations are used to develop new NSAs for these processes. Selected NSAs allow weak hydrogen binding and low H2 dissociation barriers, which is an exception to the general rule. The lowering of the transition-state energy is observed even on non-ideal NSAs, although the effect is less pronounced. NSAs promise high hydrogenation activity at low temperatures, which is beneficial for the production of chiral pharmaceutical compounds and could potentially permit easier separation and storage of hydrogen. The stability of near-surface alloys (NSAs) can be assessed using a two-step procedure: first, considering the composition in vacuum, and then accounting for the effects of hydrogen adsorption. Adsorbates can draw to the surface components of alloys to which they bind strongly. The tendency of hydrogen to induce surface segregation can be estimated by comparing the segregation energy (Eseg) of the solute to the difference in the magnitudes of the hydrogen binding energies between the pure solute and the pure host. Real NSAs may differ from idealized models, but these deviations do not substantially affect the main trends in adsorbate behavior. Some experimental studies have shown significantly modified catalytic activity on non-ideal NSAs, in line with theoretical predictions.

The thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions can influence the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems such as Pt-3d alloys. The addition of a third transition metal element M can modify the driving energy for Pt segregation to the outermost layer of Pt3Ni (111) surface. Transition metals V, Fe, Co, Mo, Tc, Ru, W, Re, Os, and Ir were predicted to lead to even more negative Pt surface segregation energies than that in the based Pt3Ni (111) surface, further promoting Pt surface segregation. In contrast, doping transition metals Ag, Au, and Pd would lead to positive segregation energies and hence suppress the Pt surface segregation in the corresponding Pt3Ni/M (111) surface. The surface energy effect, strain effect, and heat of solution effect induced by the doped element M would collectively affect the Pt surface segregation energy in the Pt3Ni/M (111) surfaces. The extent of Pt surface segregation is determined by the relative Pt surface segregation energy, lattice mismatch, and heat of solution of the Pt3M crystal with respect to those of the Pt3Ni crystal. Replacing Ni with transition metals V, Fe, Co, Mo, Tc, Ru, W, Re, Os, and Ir would lead to even stronger Pt segregation extent to the surface while replacing Ni with transition metals Ag, Au, and Pd could completely prohibit Pt segregating to the surface.

The stability of Pt-based alloys, such as Pt-3d alloys, is influenced by the oxygen coverage under electrochemical conditions. Alloys are generally less stable than pure Pt at the same oxygen coverage. Maintaining zero oxygen coverage at working potentials is crucial for achieving both high activity and stability. The stability of clean alloy surfaces can be inferred from the calculated Pt d-band structure, which shows that alloying generally leads to the stabilization of the Pt d-band, making surface Pt atoms more difficult to segregate or dissolve. However, in the presence of adsorbed O atoms, the removal of Pt is facilitated because the surface vacancy can be more strongly stabilized by O atoms. This is due to the fact that Pt atoms at the surface vacancy are less coordinated and possess more active d-states, which can more strongly bond with O atoms compared to terrace Pt atoms. Additionally, with the exposure of the second layer atoms at the surface vacancy, it is possible to form a much stronger OM bond compared to the OPt bond. This is observed in the search for the optimum structure after a Pt removal, which shows that the surface vacancy is preferentially terminated by O atoms that sink to bond with the solute M atoms at the second layer. For example, in Pt2Ti skin alloys, the surface vacancies with a configuration containing OTi bonding are much more stable than those with only OPt bonding. This is consistent with the fact that atomic O on metals is anion-like, with a strong tendency to accept electrons, and prefers to form ionic-bonds. The stability of Pt alloys under electrochemical conditions is generally lower than that of pure Pt when the oxygen coverage is the same, and maintaining zero oxygen coverage at working potentials (such as 0.9 V) is crucial for achieving both high activity and stability. Among more than 20 different Pt2M alloys, molybdenum (Mo) is identified as a good element that can alloy with Pt to form a stable surface at high electrochemical potentials. Pt2Mo has a lower kinetic barrier for oxygen reduction (OR) compared to Pt, and the barrier to OOH dissociation is a key kinetic parameter for OR activity. The higher stability of clean alloy surfaces can indeed be inferred from the calculated Pt d-band structure, which shows that alloying generally leads to the stabilization of the Pt d-band, making surface Pt atoms more difficult to segregate or dissolve. The stability of surfaces follows the order Pt2Mo > Pt > Pt2Ag > Pt2Pd > Pt2Nb > Pt2Ti > Pt2Sc > Pt2Zr, and only Pt2Mo exhibits higher stability than pure Pt at high potential (1.05 V). The oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) on a Pt2Mo alloy surface follows a similar reaction profile as on Pt, with the transition state (TS) for OOH dissociation determining the height of the potential profile. The TSs for OOH dissociation and O2 dissociation dictate the highest free energy positions in the reaction pathways. The aqueous environment, together with the in situ oxygen coverage, plays an important role in facilitating the ORR on alloy surfaces. The stability of PtxMo alloys drops quickly with increasing potential, in line with the rapid increase of surface oxygen coverage for PtxMo surfaces above 0.9 V. The Pt2Mo skin alloy achieves the best balance of stability and activity. A low Mo content (below 30%, e.g., Pt5Mo) may achieve a higher stability at high potentials, but the activity is not better than Pt at 0.9 V, while a high Mo content (above 30%, e.g., PtMo) will start to destabilize the alloy and also reduce the activity.

The stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems such as CuPt near-surface alloys, are influenced by thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions. CO adsorption at elevated pressures and temperatures can pull the less reactive Cu to the surface, driven by the formation of a stable self-organized CO/CuPt surface alloy structure. This is rationalized by the significantly stronger PtCO bond when Cu is present in the first surface layer of Pt. The results suggest new possibilities for selective and dynamical engineering of alloy surfaces for catalysis, with implications for catalytic properties and performance in various applications, including water-gas shift reactions. DFT calculations confirm the observed Cu surface segregation and the weakening of the PtCO bond with increasing Cu content in the second layer. The onset of bulk migration of Cu is explained by the results with adsorbed CO, and the interdiffusion of Cu and Pt becomes significant at 460 K, where the formation and breakup of the stable CO-induced surface alloy start to occur. The results add to the promise of using molecular adsorbate-induced surface changes as a tool for selective and dynamical engineering of alloy surfaces, likely extending to a wide variety of coinage (Cu, Ag)/Pt-group bimetallic surface alloys.
The stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems such as Pt-3d alloys, are influenced by thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions. Contrary to expectations, CO adsorption at elevated pressures and temperatures can pull the less reactive Cu to the surface of a CuPt near-surface alloy, forming a stable self-organized CO/CuPt surface alloy structure. This is due to the significantly stronger PtCO bond when Cu is present in the first surface layer of Pt. The findings suggest new possibilities for selective and dynamical engineering of alloy surfaces for catalysis, potentially applicable to a range of coinage (Cu, Ag)/Pt-group bimetallic surface alloys.
The stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems such as Pt-3d alloys, are influenced by thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions. CO adsorption at elevated pressures and temperatures can pull the less reactive Cu to the surface of a CuPt near-surface alloy, driven by the formation of a stable self-organized CO/CuPt surface alloy structure. This is due to the drastically stronger PtCO bond when Cu is present in the first surface layer of Pt. The results are expected to apply to a range of coinage (Cu, Ag)/Pt-group bimetallic surface alloys. The bonding of adsorbates can induce changes in local atomic composition and surface structure, changing the activity and selectivity of the catalyst. The CuPt near-surface alloy (NSA) was suggested as a promising water-gas shift catalyst because of reduced PtCO bonding on a Pt catalyst surface with Cu present in the second layer. However, the NSA is unstable at elevated CO pressures and sample temperatures, forming instead a self-organized CO/CuPt surface alloy (SA) structure. The results are confirmed by extended density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Although Cu diffusion to the first layer is endothermic, the drastic increase in CO binding energy more than compensates for the endothermicity. The vastly increased PtCO bond strength when 2/3 ML of Cu is present in the first layer rationalizes the observed Cu surface segregation. The calculated higher stability of the CuPt SA compared with Cu in the bulk with CO adsorption on clean Pt(111) is nearly equal to the free-energy difference (ΔG). The interdiffusion of Cu and Pt becomes significant at 460 K, and the formation and breakup of the stable CO-induced surface alloy start to occur at this temperature. The DFT calculations reproduce the experimental observations and confirm the rationalization of the observed Cu surface segregation. The results for the CuPt system at elevated temperatures and CO pressures, where a novel stable CO-induced surface alloy forms, likely extend to a wide variety of coinage (Cu, Ag)/Pt-group bimetallic surface alloys.
The stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems such as Pt-3d alloys, are influenced by thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions. Contrary to expectations, CO adsorption at elevated pressures and temperatures causes the less reactive Cu to segregate to the surface of a CuPt near-surface alloy. This segregation is driven by the formation of a stable self-organized CO/CuPt surface alloy structure, which is explained by the significantly stronger PtCO bond when Cu is present in the first surface layer of Pt. These findings suggest new possibilities for selective and dynamic engineering of alloy surfaces for catalysis, which could apply to a variety of coinage (Cu, Ag)/Pt-group bimetallic surface alloys.

The thermodynamics and kinetics of oxygen-induced segregation of 3d metals in Pt-based systems, such as Pt-3d alloys, are influenced by factors including the crystal plane, which affects the stability of subsurface 3d metals. This has implications for the catalytic properties and performance of bimetallic catalysts in various applications, particularly in oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activity. The stability of subsurface 3d metals in Pt(111) and Pt(100) under oxygen exposure is predicted through Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations. The crystal plane has an effect on the subsurface stability of the bimetallic catalysts. These factors influence the surface segregation and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, which in turn affect their catalytic properties and performance in various applications.

The thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions significantly influence the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems such as Pt-3d alloys. Bimetallic catalysts exhibit greater surface structural complexity compared to monometallic catalysts, with the second metal, in either its metallic or oxidized state, being present on the surface, in the near-surface region, or embedded in the bulk region. The surface structure of bimetallic catalysts is crucial to their catalytic properties. For instance, Pt-based bimetallic catalysts with Pt-skin surfaces and 3d transition metals in the subsurface region demonstrate superior catalytic performance in many reactions compared to pure Pt surfaces. The structure of the catalyst surface often changes dynamically during reactions, similar to reversible surface processes observed in monometallic catalyst systems when the gaseous environment shifts between reductive and oxidative conditions. Bimetallic catalysts may exhibit a similar dependence of surface structure on the redox potential of reaction gases, providing an opportunity to adjust catalytic activity and selectivity.

The stability of bimetallic surface structures under reaction conditions is a critical factor in bimetallic catalysis, as it can modify catalytic properties. For example, under annealing conditions, the subsurface PtNiPt(111) structure is more thermodynamically stable than the surface NiPtPt(111) structure in vacuum. Pt3d alloys in fuel cell applications often have a Pt skin, indicating a thermodynamic preference for Pt-terminated bimetallic surfaces. The segregation energy (Eseg) determines whether the admetal segregates to the surface or remains in the subsurface, affecting the surface composition. Hydrogen-induced segregation is influenced by Eseg and the difference in hydrogen-binding energies on the surface and subsurface. Oxygen can destabilize the subsurface structure, driving subsurface 3d metals to segregate to the surface. Adsorbates with weak Pauling electronegativity have a small effect on the thermodynamic potential for interchanging surface and subsurface configurations, while those with strong Pauling electronegativity can significantly alter binding energy, leading to surface segregation when their coverage is high enough. Oxygen-induced surface segregation is also predicted for specific Pt-based alloy surfaces.

The thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions significantly influence the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems such as Pt-3d alloys. Under reductive conditions, such as vacuum and carbon monoxide, 3d transition metals prefer to occupy the subsurface layer due to their higher surface energy and smaller atomic size. However, under oxidizing conditions, the strong interaction between oxygen and 3d transition metals induces their segregation to the surface, leading to the formation of oxidized 3d transition metal islands. These structural changes have profound implications for the catalytic properties and performance of these materials in various applications. For instance, Pt(111) surfaces with atomic dispersed 3d transition metals in the surface layers exhibit high activity for CO oxidation through a bi-functional mechanism. The interplay between the structure, reaction environment, and catalytic activity is a critical factor in determining the performance of alloy catalysts.

The surface structures of PtNi, PtCo, and PtCu bimetallic catalysts exhibit reversible changes in response to the redox potential of the environmental gas. These changes can be controlled by treating the catalysts in various gases. Surface segregation is a common phenomenon in bimetallic surfaces, where a metal with a larger atomic radius tends to segregate to the surface to release strain. Platinum, with its larger atomic radius compared to cobalt, nickel, and copper, is more likely to segregate to the surface. The presence of hydrogen does not alter the thermodynamic driving force for surface segregation. Oxygen adsorption on Pt-M catalyst surfaces can induce the segregation of 3d transition metals to the top surface due to the strong bonding between oxygen and 3d transition metals. In oxidative environments, 3d transition metals can become oxidized, and the formed oxides tend to encapsulate platinum surfaces. The mass transport processes that occur during oxidation or reduction reactions are fully reversible, depending on the redox potential of the reaction gases. The reversible structural changes in Pt-based bimetallic catalysts have significant implications for real catalytic processes.

The stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems such as Pt-3d alloys, are influenced by thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions. Fe-Pt catalysts have been used in the preferential oxidation (PROX) of CO in excess H2, achieving high selectivity for CO oxidation. Pt-skin structures show high activity for catalyzing the hydrogenation of unsaturated hydrocarbons. The unique catalytic properties of the Pt-skin surfaces are attributed to the modification of the electronic structure of the surface Pt by the subsurface Fe underneath, influencing the adsorption and reaction characteristics of the surface species. The controlled preparation of various Fe-Pt surface structures allows for the derivation of the relationship between structure and catalytic properties, aiding in the design of high-performance and low-cost catalysts. The stability of the Pt-skin structure can be reduced under certain circumstances, such as an oxidative environment, leading to gas-induced Fe surface segregation. The structural configuration of the catalyst can be transformed between surface Fe or FeO and subsurface Fe on the Pt(111) surface by cycles of oxidation and reduction. These transformations have implications for the catalytic properties and performance of the catalysts in various applications, including oxygen reduction reactions, hydrogenation of unsaturated hydrocarbons, and the preferential oxidation of CO in excess H2. Depending on the preparation procedures and reaction conditions, Fe overlayers with either metallic or oxidized states may be present as the topmost surface or in the subsurface region of Pt. Different reactions can produce different Fe-Pt surface structural configurations. For oxygen reduction reactions (ORR), Pt-skin structures with Fe or some other transition metals in the subsurface regions showed a higher activity than pure Pt. For instance, Fe49Pt51 alloys with 100% Pt as the topmost layer had 25 times the activity of pure Pt catalysts in ORR. The optimization of the performance of Fe-Pt structures in magnetism and catalysis places a high demand on the design and control of the surface structural configurations and needs information on the stability of the various structures at elevated temperatures and under different reaction atmospheres.

Surface segregation in bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems such as Pt-3d alloys, is influenced by thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions. This phenomenon is crucial in materials science, catalysis, and surface chemistry, affecting properties like permeation, surface adsorption, crystal growth, and metal corrosion. Surface segregation can significantly alter the catalytic activities of alloys, as evidenced by enhanced oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activities in Pt alloys with 3d metals compared to pure Pt. The unusual catalytic activity, closely related to surface segregation, has sparked extensive research. Most studies have focused on understanding surface and subsurface structures and electronic properties under vacuum conditions. However, catalytic reactions like the ORR occur under environments with various adsorbates, which can influence surface segregation trends and change the surface composition of alloys. Therefore, studying the segregation trend of Pt-based alloys under surface adsorption is critical for understanding their catalytic properties and performance in various applications.

The stability and surface segregation tendencies of PdRu/Ru(0001) and PtRu/Ru(0001) surface alloys were studied using scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and Auger electron spectroscopy (AES). The results showed that after Ru deposition and subsequent re-alloying, the original surface alloy composition was almost completely restored, indicating that the buried Pd and Pt almost completely segregated to the surface layer. There was a slight loss of Pt during the re-alloying step. The slight differences in the stability of the surface alloy may be due to the lower Pd content (44%) in the surface alloy compared to Pt (70%). The preference for surface segregation of a metal atom dissolved in a host metal is related to the difference in surface energies of the two species and the difference in the optimal nearest-neighbor distances of host and guest metal. The surface energies decrease in the order Ru(0001) (1.31.6 eVatom1), Pt(111) (1 eVatom1) and Pd(111) (0.8 eVatom1), which is in good agreement with the observed tendency for segregation of Pt and Pd. The size mismatch of the larger guest metals Pt (0.277 nm) and Pd (0.275 nm) compared to the Ru(0001) single crystal (0.270 nm) would favor the inclusion of the impurity metals in the tensile stressed outermost Ru layer, providing additional driving force for surface segregation. The floating behavior was studied by following the variation in the surface morphology and structure during a series of four preparation steps: deposition of Pt (Pd) on Ru(0001), surface alloy formation by annealing, deposition of Ru on the surface alloy at 500 K, and re-alloying by annealing. The probability that a small amount of Pt (Pd) on Ru(0001) is dissolved in the subsurface region (buried by a layer of substrate material) during surface alloy formation can be estimated by a simple Boltzmann approach. The observation of a distinct bilayer island growth of Ru on the Pt0.70Ru0.30/Ru(0001) surface alloy at 500 K, in contrast to the layer-by-layer Ru growth on Pd0.44Ru0.56/Ru(0001) under similar growth conditions, may be attributed to the lower Pd content, the different 2D distribution of the components in the latter surface alloy with more Ru3 surface sites as compared to Pt0.70Ru0.30/Ru(0001), or to a less pronounced difference between RuRu bonding and RuPd bonding.

The study uses density functional theory to investigate oxygen adsorption and its impact on surface segregation in Pt(shell)/M(core) and Pt3M (M = Co, Ir) alloys on (211) surfaces. Oxygen adsorbs most favorably at the bridge site over and parallel to the (100) step. Surface segregation is observed in Pt3Co, Pt3Ir, and Pt/Co(core) systems. The Pt/Ir(core) structure exhibits antisegregation behavior even when oxygen is adsorbed. The arrangement of atoms in the first 23 layers of the catalyst surface significantly affects the catalytic activity of alloys, and surface segregation plays a crucial role in this. Characterizing the surface atomic distribution and understanding the effect of segregation on surface structure are important for catalytic alloys.

Thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions significantly influence the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems such as Pt-3d alloys. The lower surface free energy of Au compared to Pt makes it energetically favorable for Au to remain at the surface when Au is deposited on top of Pt. The immiscibility of Au and Pt at Au compositions greater than 17% also suggests that Au should remain on top of the Pt clusters. The adsorption of CO on the PtAu clusters at room temperature promotes the diffusion of Pt to the surface of the clusters, and this phenomenon is most pronounced for the clusters that are initially pure Au at the surface. Density functional theory calculations demonstrate that it is thermodynamically favorable for Pt to diffuse to the cluster surface in order to bind to CO. For CO oxidation, the first step in the reaction is the dissociation of O2 at Pt sites. Since this process requires more than one contiguous Pt site, it is not surprising that O2 dissociation cannot occur on the PtAu clusters that are 100% Au at the surface before CO exposure, given the low probability for ensembles of Pt sites to form at the surface. In contrast, CO oxidation does not occur at the cluster surfaces that are initially pure Au, presumably because the first step in the oxidation process is O2 dissociation, which requires neighboring Pt sites. These factors have consequent implications for the catalytic properties and performance of bimetallic catalysts in various applications.

The stability of Pt3dPt subsurface structures in various conditions is a critical factor in their catalytic properties and performance. These structures are desirable in heterogeneous catalysis and electrocatalysis. DFT predictions indicate that these structures are stable in vacuum and with adsorbed hydrogen, but with adsorbed oxygen, the 3d atoms should segregate to the surface. These predictions have been experimentally verified on selected Pt3dPt(111) systems and expanded to polycrystalline Pt to understand the effects of multiple crystal facets on the kinetic barriers for the segregation of subsurface 3d atoms. The Pt3dPt subsurface structures are predicted to have higher activation barriers for oxygen-induced segregation compared to the respective Pt3dPt(111) configuration. The PtNiPt system is the most resistant to oxygen-induced segregation, while the PtTiPt configuration is the most susceptible. The stability of these structures in vacuum and with adsorbed hydrogen and oxygen has been demonstrated through DFT calculations and experimental verification on both single crystal Pt(111) and polycrystalline Pt foil. Using combined theoretical and experimental approaches, the relative stability of surface and subsurface bimetallic structures can be quantified and general trends predicted. The difference in the occupied d-band center, Δεd, can be used to screen potential bimetallic alloys with desirable stability in different environments. A BrnstedEvansPolanyi relationship has been derived to correlate thermodynamic stability from DFT calculations with kinetic barriers from experimental measurements for the Pt3dPt systems. Empirical equations have been developed to predict the thermodynamic stability of other bimetallic systems in various conditions. The large difference in binding energies between surface and subsurface structures highlights the need to understand their stability in reacting environments. For Pt3d bimetallic systems, the difference in oxygen binding energy for these configurations is on the order of hundreds of kcal/mol. Based on Sabatier's principle, if a subsurface alloy structure exhibits optimal binding properties for dehydrogenation and ORR, the surface structure would likely bind intermediates too strongly, halting the reaction. Conversely, if the surface alloy structure exhibits optimal binding properties for steam reforming, the subsurface structure would bind adsorbates too weakly, preventing the reaction from proceeding. The stability of bimetallic structures has been considered with various atomic species, which can be extended to more complex adsorbates using scaling relationships. DFT results predict that subsurface PtMPt(111) configurations are preferred in vacuum and with 0.5 ML H, while surface MPtPt(111) configurations are preferred with 0.5 ML O. Experimental measurements have verified the predicted segregation of subsurface 3d atoms in the presence of oxygen and quantified the activation barrier for adsorbate-induced segregation. AES results suggest two regions of segregation, revealing that DFT predictions and experimental measurements on single crystal bimetallic surfaces are applicable to polycrystalline substrates, bridging the materials gap. Predictions show that all Pt3dPt(100) structures have a higher activation barrier for oxygen-induced segregation compared to respective Pt3dPt(111) configurations. Linear trends in all systems show that the correlation of thermodynamic stability with the difference in d-band center can be used beyond Pt3d alloys. Switching the admetal/host component shifts the absolute driving potential of the segregation. This general stability trend predicts that all bimetallic systems have the same thermodynamically preferred configuration in each environment, with subsurface configurations preferred in vacuum and with 0.5 ML H, and surface configurations favored with 0.5 ML O.

The thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions influence the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems such as Pt-3d alloys. The simulation results showed that the Pd atoms would segregate into the outermost layers of the extended surfaces and the Pt concentration would increase monotonically from the extended surfaces into the bulk. The equilibrium PtPd nanoparticles were found to have Pd-enriched shells and Pt-enriched cores. In the shell of the PtPd nanoparticles, the Pd atoms were predicted to preferably segregate to the (100) facets rather than the (111) facets. These phenomena have consequent implications for their catalytic properties and performance in various applications.

The stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems such as Pt-3d alloys, are influenced by thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions. The dissolution of Fe atoms in a PtFe alloy under specific conditions leads to the formation of a Pt skin layer with predominantly (111)-oriented facets. This process is investigated using in situ electrochemical scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) in a 0.1 M HClO4 solution. The potential cycles applied to the PtFe film result in increased dissolution of Fe and the rearrangement of Pt at the surface, forming a protective Pt skin layer. This layer protects the underlying PtFe alloy from corrosion, which has implications for the catalytic properties and performance of the alloy in fuel cell applications. Further studies on the Pt skin layer, such as the adsorption and oxidation of CO, are being conducted to better understand its electrocatalytic behavior.

The literature does not provide specific information on how thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions influence the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems such as Pt-3d alloys, and what are the consequent implications for their catalytic properties and performance in various applications. However, it does mention that the design of high performance cathode electrocatalysts is essential for polymer electrolyte fuel cells, and that the enhancement of electrocatalytic activity of Pt by alloying with Fe results in a maximum activity at ca. 50% Fe content, which is 25 times higher than pure Pt activity. The enhancement could be well explained by the 5d-vacancy of the surface, but not by Pt interatomic distance or roughening of the surfaces.

The stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems such as Pt-3d alloys, are influenced by thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions. Platinum is a popular cathode electrocatalyst in PEM fuel cells, but its slow kinetics for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) limits catalytic efficiency. In recent years, Pt-based alloys, which include Pt and other transition metals, have been extensively studied due to their enhanced ORR activity. Surface segregation plays a key role in this process, leading to the formation of a pure Pt-skin in the outermost layer of the alloys. This surface segregation is closely related to the enhanced stability of Pt-based catalysts. Au shows strong surface segregation in PtAu alloys, whereas Co is usually unable to enrich PtCo alloy surfaces. The process of Au segregating from the second layer to the surface is exothermic, indicating that Au surface segregation is thermodynamically favorable. However, for the PtCo alloy, the surface Co atoms have a stronger tendency to migrate to the second layer, making the continuous segregation of Co unlikely. Therefore, Co segregating to the clean Pt(111) surface is both thermodynamically unfavorable and kinetically prohibitive. Surface segregation has been found to play a key role in the process of Pt-based alloys. For instance, Stamenkovic et al. found that the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is uniquely active on Pt-skin surfaces, and the reaction rate is four times that of the pure Pt catalyst. Numerous studies have been carried out using modern experimental and computational techniques to understand the importance of surface segregation for Pt-based alloys. For many Pt alloy systems, segregation trends have been unambiguously identified, and the components of surface and subsurface regions have successfully been characterized. The dissolution of metal atoms results in some defects on the alloy surface, which are critical to the rearrangement process. The phenomenon can also be observed in acidic solution, often with dissolution of the alloyed metal and rearrangement of Pt atoms. The segregation process includes interlayer migration of the impurity atom, vacancy movement at the second layer, and vacancy regeneration at the surface layer. The segregation model can successfully interpret these phenomena, particularly from a kinetics viewpoint. The pathway from 1 to 4 describes a complete cycle in which an impurity atom in the second layer segregates to the Pt(111) surface. The process is exothermic for the PtAu system, whereas it is endothermic for the PtCo system. Therefore, Co segregating to the clean Pt(111) surface is both thermodynamically unfavorable and kinetically prohibitive according to the model.

The thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions significantly influence the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems such as Pt-3d alloys. The introduction of 3d metals into the Pt(111) system considerably alters the surface adsorption properties, which can be considerably modified by the 3d metals. The electronic structure of the surface Pt atoms only differs very slightly for the segregated and nonsegregated alloys. The discrepant adsorption properties are therefore mainly attributed to the direct involvement of 3d metals either on the surface or in the subsurface. The stability of Pt atoms of Pt-skin surfaces of the three alloys is enhanced with respect to those in pure Pt surfaces. Such stability enhancement is observed both in clean surfaces and under 0.25 ML of adsorbed atomic oxygen, and the degree of stability enhancement follows the opposite order of the oxygen adsorption strengths in the three studied alloys, indicating the protective role of the 3d subsurface atoms determined by their strong binding to the Pt surface layer. The presence of 3d metals in the alloys modifies the electronic and geometric properties, altering the binding strength of adsorbates. This can lead to enhanced catalytic properties and performance in various applications, such as increased oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) rate and improved electrochemical stability against dissolution. The formation of a Pt-skin layer on the surface of Pt-3d alloys, accompanied by a Pt-depleted layer underneath, is a result of surface segregation that can facilitate the removal of adsorbed species, increasing the ORR rate. The stability enhancement of Pt-skin surfaces is associated with a positive potential shift, indicating that the dissolution of Pt atoms is delayed to higher potentials. The presence of adsorbates, such as oxygen, can affect the stability of the catalysts, but Pt-skin surfaces from the alloys still show enhanced stability compared to pure Pt under adsorbate coverage.

The literature does not provide specific information on how thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions influence the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems such as Pt-3d alloys, and the consequent implications for their catalytic properties and performance in various applications. However, it does discuss the effects of annealing temperature on the structural and chemical properties of bimetallic PtRu/Ru(0001) surfaces, which can be related to the broader question. The study shows that annealing leads to changes in the surface morphology from Pt islands on the Ru substrate to a PtRu/Ru(0001) surface alloy, which significantly alters the adsorption properties of the surface. This can be attributed to changes in the composition of the adsorption ensembles and electronic interactions between the metallic constituents upon alloy formation. These changes have implications for the catalytic properties of the surface, as they can affect the activity and selectivity of the catalyst. The literature also discusses the structural and chemical properties of bimetallic PtRu/Ru(0001) model catalysts and their modification upon stepwise annealing of a submonolayer Pt-covered Ru(0001) surface up to the formation of an equilibrated PtxRu1-x/Ru(0001) monolayer surface alloy. The study reveals that the surface structure significantly affects the adsorption properties of the bimetallic surface, which can be explained by changes in the composition of the adsorption ensembles (ensemble effects) for D adsorption and by changes in the electronic interaction (ligand effects, strain effects) of the metallic constituents for CO and D adsorption upon alloy formation. The surface structure and distribution of the components in the topmost layer are accessible by scanning tunneling microscopy (STM), and that the adsorption properties of the bimetallic surface can be explained by changes of the composition of the adsorption ensembles (ensemble effects) for D adsorption and by changes in the electronic interaction (ligand effects, strain effects) of the metallic constituents for CO and D adsorption upon alloy formation. The study reveals that the surface structure significantly affects the adsorption properties of the bimetallic surface, which can be explained by changes in the composition of the adsorption ensembles (ensemble effects) for D adsorption and by changes in the electronic interaction (ligand effects, strain effects) of the metallic constituents for CO and D adsorption upon alloy formation. The study shows that annealing leads to changes in the surface morphology from Pt islands on the Ru substrate to PtRu/Ru(0001) surface alloys, inducing significant changes in the adsorption properties of CO and deuterium. These changes can be attributed to ensemble effects for D adsorption and electronic interaction effects for CO and D adsorption upon alloy formation. The results demonstrate the sensitivity of probe molecule adsorption to the local structure and composition of a bimetallic surface, even for a combination of two chemically active metals such as Ru and Pt.

The stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems such as Pt-3d alloys, are influenced by thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions. Surface segregation, where one metal species enriches the surface or the first sub-surface layers over other components, has significant implications for materials science and surface chemistry. It affects physical and chemical properties such as permeation, surface adsorption, crystal growth, and metal corrosion. Notably, the catalytic activities of alloys can be dramatically altered through surface segregation. Pt, an efficient catalyst used in important chemical reactions like methanol oxidation and hydrocarbon reforming, is the most widely used electrocatalyst for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in fuel cells. Efforts to find alternative catalysts to Pt have focused on Pt-based bimetallic alloys, where some platinum is replaced by less expensive metals. The catalytic properties of these alloys are determined by the surface geometry and electronic structure, which can be modified by the chemical composition, leading to improved catalytic effects when appropriate structures are achieved. Enhanced ORR activities have been observed in Pt alloys with 3d metals, with surface segregation playing a key role. For example, Stamenkovic et al. found that the ORR on Pt-skin structures produced by Pt segregating on the surface of annealed Pt3Co alloys is uniquely active, with a reaction rate four times that of pure Pt. The enhanced activities can be attributed to the surface electronic structure and surface bond length of alloy systems. The surface geometry can considerably alter catalytic efficiency, but for Pt3Co (1 1 1) and Pt3Ni (1 1 1) systems, the maximum deviation of the surface bond length after Pt segregation is only 0.002 Å, indicating that the geometric effect does not contribute to the enhanced ORR activities of Pt-skin surfaces. Instead, the electronic structures modified through surface segregation are the main factor for such enhancement. Theoretical approaches can help to elucidate the driving force and the tendency of this phenomenon. Surface segregation is also governed by temperature and by the presence of adsorbates.

The literature does not provide specific information on how thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions influence the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems such as Pt-3d alloys, and the consequent implications for their catalytic properties and performance in various applications. However, it does discuss the growth of silver on a Pt(1 0 0) surface and the evolution of the structure with increasing temperature, which can be related to the stability and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts. At room temperature, the formation of elongated 2D-adislands with a composition of Ag80Pt20 was observed. Annealing of the sample above 600 K causes more extensive alloying starting at the perimeter of the Ag adislands by AgPt exchange and formation of a nanophasic AgPt alloy confined to the surface layer. With sufficient Ag, this alloy spreads across the surface until a uniform stoichiometry is established over the entire surface. Temperature-dependent AES studies indicate that there is some mixing of Ag with bulk Pt at elevated temperatures. These findings suggest that the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts can be influenced by thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions, which in turn can affect their catalytic properties and performance in various applications.

Ternary alloys have a strong tendency for platinum surface segregation, forming a platinum monolayer on their surfaces. This top platinum monolayer results in relatively weaker binding strengths of oxygen and hydroxyl groups in the ternary alloys, indicating enhanced activity for the oxygen reduction reaction compared to bimetallic alloy surfaces. Additionally, the platinum-skin surfaces of ternary alloys exhibit improved electrochemical stability against the dissolution of platinum atoms from the alloy surface.

The stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems such as Pt-3d alloys, are influenced by thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions. Some near-surface alloys (NSAs) bind atomic hydrogen as weakly as noble metals while dissociating H2 more easily, which is beneficial for hydrogen-related reactions. Hydrogen chemistry on NSAs is crucial for many chemical and pharmaceutical processes. Density functional theory calculations are used to develop new NSAs for these processes. Selected NSAs allow weak hydrogen binding and low H2 dissociation barriers, which is an exception to the general rule. The lowering of the transition-state energy is observed even on non-ideal NSAs, although the effect is less pronounced. NSAs promise high hydrogenation activity at low temperatures, which is beneficial for the production of chiral pharmaceutical compounds and could potentially permit easier separation and storage of hydrogen. The stability of near-surface alloys (NSAs) can be assessed using a two-step procedure: first, considering the composition in vacuum, and then accounting for the effects of hydrogen adsorption. Adsorbates can draw to the surface components of alloys to which they bind strongly. The tendency of hydrogen to induce surface segregation can be estimated by comparing the segregation energy (Eseg) of the solute to the difference in the magnitudes of the hydrogen binding energies between the pure solute and the pure host. Real NSAs may differ from idealized models, but these deviations do not substantially affect the main trends in adsorbate behavior. Some experimental studies have shown significantly modified catalytic activity on non-ideal NSAs, in line with theoretical predictions.

The thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions can influence the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems such as Pt-3d alloys. The addition of a third transition metal element M can modify the driving energy for Pt segregation to the outermost layer of Pt3Ni (111) surface. Transition metals V, Fe, Co, Mo, Tc, Ru, W, Re, Os, and Ir were predicted to lead to even more negative Pt surface segregation energies than that in the based Pt3Ni (111) surface, further promoting Pt surface segregation. In contrast, doping transition metals Ag, Au, and Pd would lead to positive segregation energies and hence suppress the Pt surface segregation in the corresponding Pt3Ni/M (111) surface. The surface energy effect, strain effect, and heat of solution effect induced by the doped element M would collectively affect the Pt surface segregation energy in the Pt3Ni/M (111) surfaces. The extent of Pt surface segregation is determined by the relative Pt surface segregation energy, lattice mismatch, and heat of solution of the Pt3M crystal with respect to those of the Pt3Ni crystal. Replacing Ni with transition metals V, Fe, Co, Mo, Tc, Ru, W, Re, Os, and Ir would lead to even stronger Pt segregation extent to the surface while replacing Ni with transition metals Ag, Au, and Pd could completely prohibit Pt segregating to the surface.

The stability of Pt-based alloys, such as Pt-3d alloys, is influenced by the oxygen coverage under electrochemical conditions. Alloys are generally less stable than pure Pt at the same oxygen coverage. Maintaining zero oxygen coverage at working potentials is crucial for achieving both high activity and stability. The stability of clean alloy surfaces can be inferred from the calculated Pt d-band structure, which shows that alloying generally leads to the stabilization of the Pt d-band, making surface Pt atoms more difficult to segregate or dissolve. However, in the presence of adsorbed O atoms, the removal of Pt is facilitated because the surface vacancy can be more strongly stabilized by O atoms. This is due to the fact that Pt atoms at the surface vacancy are less coordinated and possess more active d-states, which can more strongly bond with O atoms compared to terrace Pt atoms. Additionally, with the exposure of the second layer atoms at the surface vacancy, it is possible to form a much stronger OM bond compared to the OPt bond. This is observed in the search for the optimum structure after a Pt removal, which shows that the surface vacancy is preferentially terminated by O atoms that sink to bond with the solute M atoms at the second layer. For example, in Pt2Ti skin alloys, the surface vacancies with a configuration containing OTi bonding are much more stable than those with only OPt bonding. This is consistent with the fact that atomic O on metals is anion-like, with a strong tendency to accept electrons, and prefers to form ionic-bonds. The stability of Pt alloys under electrochemical conditions is generally lower than that of pure Pt when the oxygen coverage is the same, and maintaining zero oxygen coverage at working potentials (such as 0.9 V) is crucial for achieving both high activity and stability. Among more than 20 different Pt2M alloys, molybdenum (Mo) is identified as a good element that can alloy with Pt to form a stable surface at high electrochemical potentials. Pt2Mo has a lower kinetic barrier for oxygen reduction (OR) compared to Pt, and the barrier to OOH dissociation is a key kinetic parameter for OR activity. The higher stability of clean alloy surfaces can indeed be inferred from the calculated Pt d-band structure, which shows that alloying generally leads to the stabilization of the Pt d-band, making surface Pt atoms more difficult to segregate or dissolve. The stability of surfaces follows the order Pt2Mo > Pt > Pt2Ag > Pt2Pd > Pt2Nb > Pt2Ti > Pt2Sc > Pt2Zr, and only Pt2Mo exhibits higher stability than pure Pt at high potential (1.05 V). The oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) on a Pt2Mo alloy surface follows a similar reaction profile as on Pt, with the transition state (TS) for OOH dissociation determining the height of the potential profile. The TSs for OOH dissociation and O2 dissociation dictate the highest free energy positions in the reaction pathways. The aqueous environment, together with the in situ oxygen coverage, plays an important role in facilitating the ORR on alloy surfaces. The stability of PtxMo alloys drops quickly with increasing potential, in line with the rapid increase of surface oxygen coverage for PtxMo surfaces above 0.9 V. The Pt2Mo skin alloy achieves the best balance of stability and activity. A low Mo content (below 30%, e.g., Pt5Mo) may achieve a higher stability at high potentials, but the activity is not better than Pt at 0.9 V, while a high Mo content (above 30%, e.g., PtMo) will start to destabilize the alloy and also reduce the activity.

The stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems such as CuPt near-surface alloys, are influenced by thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions. CO adsorption at elevated pressures and temperatures can pull the less reactive Cu to the surface, driven by the formation of a stable self-organized CO/CuPt surface alloy structure. This is rationalized by the significantly stronger PtCO bond when Cu is present in the first surface layer of Pt. The results suggest new possibilities for selective and dynamical engineering of alloy surfaces for catalysis, with implications for catalytic properties and performance in various applications, including water-gas shift reactions. DFT calculations confirm the observed Cu surface segregation and the weakening of the PtCO bond with increasing Cu content in the second layer. The onset of bulk migration of Cu is explained by the results with adsorbed CO, and the interdiffusion of Cu and Pt becomes significant at 460 K, where the formation and breakup of the stable CO-induced surface alloy start to occur. The results add to the promise of using molecular adsorbate-induced surface changes as a tool for selective and dynamical engineering of alloy surfaces, likely extending to a wide variety of coinage (Cu, Ag)/Pt-group bimetallic surface alloys.
The stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems such as Pt-3d alloys, are influenced by thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions. Contrary to expectations, CO adsorption at elevated pressures and temperatures can pull the less reactive Cu to the surface of a CuPt near-surface alloy, forming a stable self-organized CO/CuPt surface alloy structure. This is due to the significantly stronger PtCO bond when Cu is present in the first surface layer of Pt. The findings suggest new possibilities for selective and dynamical engineering of alloy surfaces for catalysis, potentially applicable to a range of coinage (Cu, Ag)/Pt-group bimetallic surface alloys.
The stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems such as Pt-3d alloys, are influenced by thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions. CO adsorption at elevated pressures and temperatures can pull the less reactive Cu to the surface of a CuPt near-surface alloy, driven by the formation of a stable self-organized CO/CuPt surface alloy structure. This is due to the drastically stronger PtCO bond when Cu is present in the first surface layer of Pt. The results are expected to apply to a range of coinage (Cu, Ag)/Pt-group bimetallic surface alloys. The bonding of adsorbates can induce changes in local atomic composition and surface structure, changing the activity and selectivity of the catalyst. The CuPt near-surface alloy (NSA) was suggested as a promising water-gas shift catalyst because of reduced PtCO bonding on a Pt catalyst surface with Cu present in the second layer. However, the NSA is unstable at elevated CO pressures and sample temperatures, forming instead a self-organized CO/CuPt surface alloy (SA) structure. The results are confirmed by extended density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Although Cu diffusion to the first layer is endothermic, the drastic increase in CO binding energy more than compensates for the endothermicity. The vastly increased PtCO bond strength when 2/3 ML of Cu is present in the first layer rationalizes the observed Cu surface segregation. The calculated higher stability of the CuPt SA compared with Cu in the bulk with CO adsorption on clean Pt(111) is nearly equal to the free-energy difference (ΔG). The interdiffusion of Cu and Pt becomes significant at 460 K, and the formation and breakup of the stable CO-induced surface alloy start to occur at this temperature. The DFT calculations reproduce the experimental observations and confirm the rationalization of the observed Cu surface segregation. The results for the CuPt system at elevated temperatures and CO pressures, where a novel stable CO-induced surface alloy forms, likely extend to a wide variety of coinage (Cu, Ag)/Pt-group bimetallic surface alloys.
The stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems such as Pt-3d alloys, are influenced by thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions. Contrary to expectations, CO adsorption at elevated pressures and temperatures causes the less reactive Cu to segregate to the surface of a CuPt near-surface alloy. This segregation is driven by the formation of a stable self-organized CO/CuPt surface alloy structure, which is explained by the significantly stronger PtCO bond when Cu is present in the first surface layer of Pt. These findings suggest new possibilities for selective and dynamic engineering of alloy surfaces for catalysis, which could apply to a variety of coinage (Cu, Ag)/Pt-group bimetallic surface alloys.

The thermodynamics and kinetics of oxygen-induced segregation of 3d metals in Pt-based systems, such as Pt-3d alloys, are influenced by factors including the crystal plane, which affects the stability of subsurface 3d metals. This has implications for the catalytic properties and performance of bimetallic catalysts in various applications, particularly in oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activity. The stability of subsurface 3d metals in Pt(111) and Pt(100) under oxygen exposure is predicted through Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations. The crystal plane has an effect on the subsurface stability of the bimetallic catalysts. These factors influence the surface segregation and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, which in turn affect their catalytic properties and performance in various applications.

The thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions significantly influence the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems such as Pt-3d alloys. Bimetallic catalysts exhibit greater surface structural complexity compared to monometallic catalysts, with the second metal, in either its metallic or oxidized state, being present on the surface, in the near-surface region, or embedded in the bulk region. The surface structure of bimetallic catalysts is crucial to their catalytic properties. For instance, Pt-based bimetallic catalysts with Pt-skin surfaces and 3d transition metals in the subsurface region demonstrate superior catalytic performance in many reactions compared to pure Pt surfaces. The structure of the catalyst surface often changes dynamically during reactions, similar to reversible surface processes observed in monometallic catalyst systems when the gaseous environment shifts between reductive and oxidative conditions. Bimetallic catalysts may exhibit a similar dependence of surface structure on the redox potential of reaction gases, providing an opportunity to adjust catalytic activity and selectivity.

The stability of bimetallic surface structures under reaction conditions is a critical factor in bimetallic catalysis, as it can modify catalytic properties. For example, under annealing conditions, the subsurface PtNiPt(111) structure is more thermodynamically stable than the surface NiPtPt(111) structure in vacuum. Pt3d alloys in fuel cell applications often have a Pt skin, indicating a thermodynamic preference for Pt-terminated bimetallic surfaces. The segregation energy (Eseg) determines whether the admetal segregates to the surface or remains in the subsurface, affecting the surface composition. Hydrogen-induced segregation is influenced by Eseg and the difference in hydrogen-binding energies on the surface and subsurface. Oxygen can destabilize the subsurface structure, driving subsurface 3d metals to segregate to the surface. Adsorbates with weak Pauling electronegativity have a small effect on the thermodynamic potential for interchanging surface and subsurface configurations, while those with strong Pauling electronegativity can significantly alter binding energy, leading to surface segregation when their coverage is high enough. Oxygen-induced surface segregation is also predicted for specific Pt-based alloy surfaces.

The thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions significantly influence the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems such as Pt-3d alloys. Under reductive conditions, such as vacuum and carbon monoxide, 3d transition metals prefer to occupy the subsurface layer due to their higher surface energy and smaller atomic size. However, under oxidizing conditions, the strong interaction between oxygen and 3d transition metals induces their segregation to the surface, leading to the formation of oxidized 3d transition metal islands. These structural changes have profound implications for the catalytic properties and performance of these materials in various applications. For instance, Pt(111) surfaces with atomic dispersed 3d transition metals in the surface layers exhibit high activity for CO oxidation through a bi-functional mechanism. The interplay between the structure, reaction environment, and catalytic activity is a critical factor in determining the performance of alloy catalysts.

The surface structures of PtNi, PtCo, and PtCu bimetallic catalysts exhibit reversible changes in response to the redox potential of the environmental gas. These changes can be controlled by treating the catalysts in various gases. Surface segregation is a common phenomenon in bimetallic surfaces, where a metal with a larger atomic radius tends to segregate to the surface to release strain. Platinum, with its larger atomic radius compared to cobalt, nickel, and copper, is more likely to segregate to the surface. The presence of hydrogen does not alter the thermodynamic driving force for surface segregation. Oxygen adsorption on Pt-M catalyst surfaces can induce the segregation of 3d transition metals to the top surface due to the strong bonding between oxygen and 3d transition metals. In oxidative environments, 3d transition metals can become oxidized, and the formed oxides tend to encapsulate platinum surfaces. The mass transport processes that occur during oxidation or reduction reactions are fully reversible, depending on the redox potential of the reaction gases. The reversible structural changes in Pt-based bimetallic catalysts have significant implications for real catalytic processes.

The stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems such as Pt-3d alloys, are influenced by thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions. Fe-Pt catalysts have been used in the preferential oxidation (PROX) of CO in excess H2, achieving high selectivity for CO oxidation. Pt-skin structures show high activity for catalyzing the hydrogenation of unsaturated hydrocarbons. The unique catalytic properties of the Pt-skin surfaces are attributed to the modification of the electronic structure of the surface Pt by the subsurface Fe underneath, influencing the adsorption and reaction characteristics of the surface species. The controlled preparation of various Fe-Pt surface structures allows for the derivation of the relationship between structure and catalytic properties, aiding in the design of high-performance and low-cost catalysts. The stability of the Pt-skin structure can be reduced under certain circumstances, such as an oxidative environment, leading to gas-induced Fe surface segregation. The structural configuration of the catalyst can be transformed between surface Fe or FeO and subsurface Fe on the Pt(111) surface by cycles of oxidation and reduction. These transformations have implications for the catalytic properties and performance of the catalysts in various applications, including oxygen reduction reactions, hydrogenation of unsaturated hydrocarbons, and the preferential oxidation of CO in excess H2. Depending on the preparation procedures and reaction conditions, Fe overlayers with either metallic or oxidized states may be present as the topmost surface or in the subsurface region of Pt. Different reactions can produce different Fe-Pt surface structural configurations. For oxygen reduction reactions (ORR), Pt-skin structures with Fe or some other transition metals in the subsurface regions showed a higher activity than pure Pt. For instance, Fe49Pt51 alloys with 100% Pt as the topmost layer had 25 times the activity of pure Pt catalysts in ORR. The optimization of the performance of Fe-Pt structures in magnetism and catalysis places a high demand on the design and control of the surface structural configurations and needs information on the stability of the various structures at elevated temperatures and under different reaction atmospheres.

Surface segregation in bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems such as Pt-3d alloys, is influenced by thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions. This phenomenon is crucial in materials science, catalysis, and surface chemistry, affecting properties like permeation, surface adsorption, crystal growth, and metal corrosion. Surface segregation can significantly alter the catalytic activities of alloys, as evidenced by enhanced oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activities in Pt alloys with 3d metals compared to pure Pt. The unusual catalytic activity, closely related to surface segregation, has sparked extensive research. Most studies have focused on understanding surface and subsurface structures and electronic properties under vacuum conditions. However, catalytic reactions like the ORR occur under environments with various adsorbates, which can influence surface segregation trends and change the surface composition of alloys. Therefore, studying the segregation trend of Pt-based alloys under surface adsorption is critical for understanding their catalytic properties and performance in various applications.

The stability and surface segregation tendencies of PdRu/Ru(0001) and PtRu/Ru(0001) surface alloys were studied using scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and Auger electron spectroscopy (AES). The results showed that after Ru deposition and subsequent re-alloying, the original surface alloy composition was almost completely restored, indicating that the buried Pd and Pt almost completely segregated to the surface layer. There was a slight loss of Pt during the re-alloying step. The slight differences in the stability of the surface alloy may be due to the lower Pd content (44%) in the surface alloy compared to Pt (70%). The preference for surface segregation of a metal atom dissolved in a host metal is related to the difference in surface energies of the two species and the difference in the optimal nearest-neighbor distances of host and guest metal. The surface energies decrease in the order Ru(0001) (1.31.6 eVatom1), Pt(111) (1 eVatom1) and Pd(111) (0.8 eVatom1), which is in good agreement with the observed tendency for segregation of Pt and Pd. The size mismatch of the larger guest metals Pt (0.277 nm) and Pd (0.275 nm) compared to the Ru(0001) single crystal (0.270 nm) would favor the inclusion of the impurity metals in the tensile stressed outermost Ru layer, providing additional driving force for surface segregation. The floating behavior was studied by following the variation in the surface morphology and structure during a series of four preparation steps: deposition of Pt (Pd) on Ru(0001), surface alloy formation by annealing, deposition of Ru on the surface alloy at 500 K, and re-alloying by annealing. The probability that a small amount of Pt (Pd) on Ru(0001) is dissolved in the subsurface region (buried by a layer of substrate material) during surface alloy formation can be estimated by a simple Boltzmann approach. The observation of a distinct bilayer island growth of Ru on the Pt0.70Ru0.30/Ru(0001) surface alloy at 500 K, in contrast to the layer-by-layer Ru growth on Pd0.44Ru0.56/Ru(0001) under similar growth conditions, may be attributed to the lower Pd content, the different 2D distribution of the components in the latter surface alloy with more Ru3 surface sites as compared to Pt0.70Ru0.30/Ru(0001), or to a less pronounced difference between RuRu bonding and RuPd bonding.

The study uses density functional theory to investigate oxygen adsorption and its impact on surface segregation in Pt(shell)/M(core) and Pt3M (M = Co, Ir) alloys on (211) surfaces. Oxygen adsorbs most favorably at the bridge site over and parallel to the (100) step. Surface segregation is observed in Pt3Co, Pt3Ir, and Pt/Co(core) systems. The Pt/Ir(core) structure exhibits antisegregation behavior even when oxygen is adsorbed. The arrangement of atoms in the first 23 layers of the catalyst surface significantly affects the catalytic activity of alloys, and surface segregation plays a crucial role in this. Characterizing the surface atomic distribution and understanding the effect of segregation on surface structure are important for catalytic alloys.

Thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions significantly influence the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems such as Pt-3d alloys. The lower surface free energy of Au compared to Pt makes it energetically favorable for Au to remain at the surface when Au is deposited on top of Pt. The immiscibility of Au and Pt at Au compositions greater than 17% also suggests that Au should remain on top of the Pt clusters. The adsorption of CO on the PtAu clusters at room temperature promotes the diffusion of Pt to the surface of the clusters, and this phenomenon is most pronounced for the clusters that are initially pure Au at the surface. Density functional theory calculations demonstrate that it is thermodynamically favorable for Pt to diffuse to the cluster surface in order to bind to CO. For CO oxidation, the first step in the reaction is the dissociation of O2 at Pt sites. Since this process requires more than one contiguous Pt site, it is not surprising that O2 dissociation cannot occur on the PtAu clusters that are 100% Au at the surface before CO exposure, given the low probability for ensembles of Pt sites to form at the surface. In contrast, CO oxidation does not occur at the cluster surfaces that are initially pure Au, presumably because the first step in the oxidation process is O2 dissociation, which requires neighboring Pt sites. These factors have consequent implications for the catalytic properties and performance of bimetallic catalysts in various applications.

The stability of Pt3dPt subsurface structures in various conditions is a critical factor in their catalytic properties and performance. These structures are desirable in heterogeneous catalysis and electrocatalysis. DFT predictions indicate that these structures are stable in vacuum and with adsorbed hydrogen, but with adsorbed oxygen, the 3d atoms should segregate to the surface. These predictions have been experimentally verified on selected Pt3dPt(111) systems and expanded to polycrystalline Pt to understand the effects of multiple crystal facets on the kinetic barriers for the segregation of subsurface 3d atoms. The Pt3dPt subsurface structures are predicted to have higher activation barriers for oxygen-induced segregation compared to the respective Pt3dPt(111) configuration. The PtNiPt system is the most resistant to oxygen-induced segregation, while the PtTiPt configuration is the most susceptible. The stability of these structures in vacuum and with adsorbed hydrogen and oxygen has been demonstrated through DFT calculations and experimental verification on both single crystal Pt(111) and polycrystalline Pt foil. Using combined theoretical and experimental approaches, the relative stability of surface and subsurface bimetallic structures can be quantified and general trends predicted. The difference in the occupied d-band center, Δεd, can be used to screen potential bimetallic alloys with desirable stability in different environments. A BrnstedEvansPolanyi relationship has been derived to correlate thermodynamic stability from DFT calculations with kinetic barriers from experimental measurements for the Pt3dPt systems. Empirical equations have been developed to predict the thermodynamic stability of other bimetallic systems in various conditions. The large difference in binding energies between surface and subsurface structures highlights the need to understand their stability in reacting environments. For Pt3d bimetallic systems, the difference in oxygen binding energy for these configurations is on the order of hundreds of kcal/mol. Based on Sabatier's principle, if a subsurface alloy structure exhibits optimal binding properties for dehydrogenation and ORR, the surface structure would likely bind intermediates too strongly, halting the reaction. Conversely, if the surface alloy structure exhibits optimal binding properties for steam reforming, the subsurface structure would bind adsorbates too weakly, preventing the reaction from proceeding. The stability of bimetallic structures has been considered with various atomic species, which can be extended to more complex adsorbates using scaling relationships. DFT results predict that subsurface PtMPt(111) configurations are preferred in vacuum and with 0.5 ML H, while surface MPtPt(111) configurations are preferred with 0.5 ML O. Experimental measurements have verified the predicted segregation of subsurface 3d atoms in the presence of oxygen and quantified the activation barrier for adsorbate-induced segregation. AES results suggest two regions of segregation, revealing that DFT predictions and experimental measurements on single crystal bimetallic surfaces are applicable to polycrystalline substrates, bridging the materials gap. Predictions show that all Pt3dPt(100) structures have a higher activation barrier for oxygen-induced segregation compared to respective Pt3dPt(111) configurations. Linear trends in all systems show that the correlation of thermodynamic stability with the difference in d-band center can be used beyond Pt3d alloys. Switching the admetal/host component shifts the absolute driving potential of the segregation. This general stability trend predicts that all bimetallic systems have the same thermodynamically preferred configuration in each environment, with subsurface configurations preferred in vacuum and with 0.5 ML H, and surface configurations favored with 0.5 ML O.

The thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions influence the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems such as Pt-3d alloys. The simulation results showed that the Pd atoms would segregate into the outermost layers of the extended surfaces and the Pt concentration would increase monotonically from the extended surfaces into the bulk. The equilibrium PtPd nanoparticles were found to have Pd-enriched shells and Pt-enriched cores. In the shell of the PtPd nanoparticles, the Pd atoms were predicted to preferably segregate to the (100) facets rather than the (111) facets. These phenomena have consequent implications for their catalytic properties and performance in various applications.

The stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems such as Pt-3d alloys, are influenced by thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions. The dissolution of Fe atoms in a PtFe alloy under specific conditions leads to the formation of a Pt skin layer with predominantly (111)-oriented facets. This process is investigated using in situ electrochemical scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) in a 0.1 M HClO4 solution. The potential cycles applied to the PtFe film result in increased dissolution of Fe and the rearrangement of Pt at the surface, forming a protective Pt skin layer. This layer protects the underlying PtFe alloy from corrosion, which has implications for the catalytic properties and performance of the alloy in fuel cell applications. Further studies on the Pt skin layer, such as the adsorption and oxidation of CO, are being conducted to better understand its electrocatalytic behavior.

The literature does not provide specific information on how thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions influence the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems such as Pt-3d alloys, and what are the consequent implications for their catalytic properties and performance in various applications. However, it does mention that the design of high performance cathode electrocatalysts is essential for polymer electrolyte fuel cells, and that the enhancement of electrocatalytic activity of Pt by alloying with Fe results in a maximum activity at ca. 50% Fe content, which is 25 times higher than pure Pt activity. The enhancement could be well explained by the 5d-vacancy of the surface, but not by Pt interatomic distance or roughening of the surfaces.

The stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems such as Pt-3d alloys, are influenced by thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions. Platinum is a popular cathode electrocatalyst in PEM fuel cells, but its slow kinetics for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) limits catalytic efficiency. In recent years, Pt-based alloys, which include Pt and other transition metals, have been extensively studied due to their enhanced ORR activity. Surface segregation plays a key role in this process, leading to the formation of a pure Pt-skin in the outermost layer of the alloys. This surface segregation is closely related to the enhanced stability of Pt-based catalysts. Au shows strong surface segregation in PtAu alloys, whereas Co is usually unable to enrich PtCo alloy surfaces. The process of Au segregating from the second layer to the surface is exothermic, indicating that Au surface segregation is thermodynamically favorable. However, for the PtCo alloy, the surface Co atoms have a stronger tendency to migrate to the second layer, making the continuous segregation of Co unlikely. Therefore, Co segregating to the clean Pt(111) surface is both thermodynamically unfavorable and kinetically prohibitive. Surface segregation has been found to play a key role in the process of Pt-based alloys. For instance, Stamenkovic et al. found that the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is uniquely active on Pt-skin surfaces, and the reaction rate is four times that of the pure Pt catalyst. Numerous studies have been carried out using modern experimental and computational techniques to understand the importance of surface segregation for Pt-based alloys. For many Pt alloy systems, segregation trends have been unambiguously identified, and the components of surface and subsurface regions have successfully been characterized. The dissolution of metal atoms results in some defects on the alloy surface, which are critical to the rearrangement process. The phenomenon can also be observed in acidic solution, often with dissolution of the alloyed metal and rearrangement of Pt atoms. The segregation process includes interlayer migration of the impurity atom, vacancy movement at the second layer, and vacancy regeneration at the surface layer. The segregation model can successfully interpret these phenomena, particularly from a kinetics viewpoint. The pathway from 1 to 4 describes a complete cycle in which an impurity atom in the second layer segregates to the Pt(111) surface. The process is exothermic for the PtAu system, whereas it is endothermic for the PtCo system. Therefore, Co segregating to the clean Pt(111) surface is both thermodynamically unfavorable and kinetically prohibitive according to the model.

The thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions significantly influence the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems such as Pt-3d alloys. The introduction of 3d metals into the Pt(111) system considerably alters the surface adsorption properties, which can be considerably modified by the 3d metals. The electronic structure of the surface Pt atoms only differs very slightly for the segregated and nonsegregated alloys. The discrepant adsorption properties are therefore mainly attributed to the direct involvement of 3d metals either on the surface or in the subsurface. The stability of Pt atoms of Pt-skin surfaces of the three alloys is enhanced with respect to those in pure Pt surfaces. Such stability enhancement is observed both in clean surfaces and under 0.25 ML of adsorbed atomic oxygen, and the degree of stability enhancement follows the opposite order of the oxygen adsorption strengths in the three studied alloys, indicating the protective role of the 3d subsurface atoms determined by their strong binding to the Pt surface layer. The presence of 3d metals in the alloys modifies the electronic and geometric properties, altering the binding strength of adsorbates. This can lead to enhanced catalytic properties and performance in various applications, such as increased oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) rate and improved electrochemical stability against dissolution. The formation of a Pt-skin layer on the surface of Pt-3d alloys, accompanied by a Pt-depleted layer underneath, is a result of surface segregation that can facilitate the removal of adsorbed species, increasing the ORR rate. The stability enhancement of Pt-skin surfaces is associated with a positive potential shift, indicating that the dissolution of Pt atoms is delayed to higher potentials. The presence of adsorbates, such as oxygen, can affect the stability of the catalysts, but Pt-skin surfaces from the alloys still show enhanced stability compared to pure Pt under adsorbate coverage.

The literature does not provide specific information on how thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions influence the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems such as Pt-3d alloys, and the consequent implications for their catalytic properties and performance in various applications. However, it does discuss the effects of annealing temperature on the structural and chemical properties of bimetallic PtRu/Ru(0001) surfaces, which can be related to the broader question. The study shows that annealing leads to changes in the surface morphology from Pt islands on the Ru substrate to a PtRu/Ru(0001) surface alloy, which significantly alters the adsorption properties of the surface. This can be attributed to changes in the composition of the adsorption ensembles and electronic interactions between the metallic constituents upon alloy formation. These changes have implications for the catalytic properties of the surface, as they can affect the activity and selectivity of the catalyst. The literature also discusses the structural and chemical properties of bimetallic PtRu/Ru(0001) model catalysts and their modification upon stepwise annealing of a submonolayer Pt-covered Ru(0001) surface up to the formation of an equilibrated PtxRu1-x/Ru(0001) monolayer surface alloy. The study reveals that the surface structure significantly affects the adsorption properties of the bimetallic surface, which can be explained by changes in the composition of the adsorption ensembles (ensemble effects) for D adsorption and by changes in the electronic interaction (ligand effects, strain effects) of the metallic constituents for CO and D adsorption upon alloy formation. The surface structure and distribution of the components in the topmost layer are accessible by scanning tunneling microscopy (STM), and that the adsorption properties of the bimetallic surface can be explained by changes of the composition of the adsorption ensembles (ensemble effects) for D adsorption and by changes in the electronic interaction (ligand effects, strain effects) of the metallic constituents for CO and D adsorption upon alloy formation. The study reveals that the surface structure significantly affects the adsorption properties of the bimetallic surface, which can be explained by changes in the composition of the adsorption ensembles (ensemble effects) for D adsorption and by changes in the electronic interaction (ligand effects, strain effects) of the metallic constituents for CO and D adsorption upon alloy formation. The study shows that annealing leads to changes in the surface morphology from Pt islands on the Ru substrate to PtRu/Ru(0001) surface alloys, inducing significant changes in the adsorption properties of CO and deuterium. These changes can be attributed to ensemble effects for D adsorption and electronic interaction effects for CO and D adsorption upon alloy formation. The results demonstrate the sensitivity of probe molecule adsorption to the local structure and composition of a bimetallic surface, even for a combination of two chemically active metals such as Ru and Pt.

The stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems such as Pt-3d alloys, are influenced by thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions. Surface segregation, where one metal species enriches the surface or the first sub-surface layers over other components, has significant implications for materials science and surface chemistry. It affects physical and chemical properties such as permeation, surface adsorption, crystal growth, and metal corrosion. Notably, the catalytic activities of alloys can be dramatically altered through surface segregation. Pt, an efficient catalyst used in important chemical reactions like methanol oxidation and hydrocarbon reforming, is the most widely used electrocatalyst for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in fuel cells. Efforts to find alternative catalysts to Pt have focused on Pt-based bimetallic alloys, where some platinum is replaced by less expensive metals. The catalytic properties of these alloys are determined by the surface geometry and electronic structure, which can be modified by the chemical composition, leading to improved catalytic effects when appropriate structures are achieved. Enhanced ORR activities have been observed in Pt alloys with 3d metals, with surface segregation playing a key role. For example, Stamenkovic et al. found that the ORR on Pt-skin structures produced by Pt segregating on the surface of annealed Pt3Co alloys is uniquely active, with a reaction rate four times that of pure Pt. The enhanced activities can be attributed to the surface electronic structure and surface bond length of alloy systems. The surface geometry can considerably alter catalytic efficiency, but for Pt3Co (1 1 1) and Pt3Ni (1 1 1) systems, the maximum deviation of the surface bond length after Pt segregation is only 0.002 Å, indicating that the geometric effect does not contribute to the enhanced ORR activities of Pt-skin surfaces. Instead, the electronic structures modified through surface segregation are the main factor for such enhancement. Theoretical approaches can help to elucidate the driving force and the tendency of this phenomenon. Surface segregation is also governed by temperature and by the presence of adsorbates.

The literature does not provide specific information on how thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions influence the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems such as Pt-3d alloys, and the consequent implications for their catalytic properties and performance in various applications. However, it does discuss the growth of silver on a Pt(1 0 0) surface and the evolution of the structure with increasing temperature, which can be related to the stability and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts. At room temperature, the formation of elongated 2D-adislands with a composition of Ag80Pt20 was observed. Annealing of the sample above 600 K causes more extensive alloying starting at the perimeter of the Ag adislands by AgPt exchange and formation of a nanophasic AgPt alloy confined to the surface layer. With sufficient Ag, this alloy spreads across the surface until a uniform stoichiometry is established over the entire surface. Temperature-dependent AES studies indicate that there is some mixing of Ag with bulk Pt at elevated temperatures. These findings suggest that the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts can be influenced by thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions, which in turn can affect their catalytic properties and performance in various applications.

Ternary alloys have a strong tendency for platinum surface segregation, forming a platinum monolayer on their surfaces. This top platinum monolayer results in relatively weaker binding strengths of oxygen and hydroxyl groups in the ternary alloys, indicating enhanced activity for the oxygen reduction reaction compared to bimetallic alloy surfaces. Additionally, the platinum-skin surfaces of ternary alloys exhibit improved electrochemical stability against the dissolution of platinum atoms from the alloy surface.

The stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems such as Pt-3d alloys, are influenced by thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions. Some near-surface alloys (NSAs) bind atomic hydrogen as weakly as noble metals while dissociating H2 more easily, which is beneficial for hydrogen-related reactions. Hydrogen chemistry on NSAs is crucial for many chemical and pharmaceutical processes. Density functional theory calculations are used to develop new NSAs for these processes. Selected NSAs allow weak hydrogen binding and low H2 dissociation barriers, which is an exception to the general rule. The lowering of the transition-state energy is observed even on non-ideal NSAs, although the effect is less pronounced. NSAs promise high hydrogenation activity at low temperatures, which is beneficial for the production of chiral pharmaceutical compounds and could potentially permit easier separation and storage of hydrogen. The stability of near-surface alloys (NSAs) can be assessed using a two-step procedure: first, considering the composition in vacuum, and then accounting for the effects of hydrogen adsorption. Adsorbates can draw to the surface components of alloys to which they bind strongly. The tendency of hydrogen to induce surface segregation can be estimated by comparing the segregation energy (Eseg) of the solute to the difference in the magnitudes of the hydrogen binding energies between the pure solute and the pure host. Real NSAs may differ from idealized models, but these deviations do not substantially affect the main trends in adsorbate behavior. Some experimental studies have shown significantly modified catalytic activity on non-ideal NSAs, in line with theoretical predictions.

The thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions can influence the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems such as Pt-3d alloys. The addition of a third transition metal element M can modify the driving energy for Pt segregation to the outermost layer of Pt3Ni (111) surface. Transition metals V, Fe, Co, Mo, Tc, Ru, W, Re, Os, and Ir were predicted to lead to even more negative Pt surface segregation energies than that in the based Pt3Ni (111) surface, further promoting Pt surface segregation. In contrast, doping transition metals Ag, Au, and Pd would lead to positive segregation energies and hence suppress the Pt surface segregation in the corresponding Pt3Ni/M (111) surface. The surface energy effect, strain effect, and heat of solution effect induced by the doped element M would collectively affect the Pt surface segregation energy in the Pt3Ni/M (111) surfaces. The extent of Pt surface segregation is determined by the relative Pt surface segregation energy, lattice mismatch, and heat of solution of the Pt3M crystal with respect to those of the Pt3Ni crystal. Replacing Ni with transition metals V, Fe, Co, Mo, Tc, Ru, W, Re, Os, and Ir would lead to even stronger Pt segregation extent to the surface while replacing Ni with transition metals Ag, Au, and Pd could completely prohibit Pt segregating to the surface.

The stability of Pt-based alloys, such as Pt-3d alloys, is influenced by the oxygen coverage under electrochemical conditions. Alloys are generally less stable than pure Pt at the same oxygen coverage. Maintaining zero oxygen coverage at working potentials is crucial for achieving both high activity and stability. The stability of clean alloy surfaces can be inferred from the calculated Pt d-band structure, which shows that alloying generally leads to the stabilization of the Pt d-band, making surface Pt atoms more difficult to segregate or dissolve. However, in the presence of adsorbed O atoms, the removal of Pt is facilitated because the surface vacancy can be more strongly stabilized by O atoms. This is due to the fact that Pt atoms at the surface vacancy are less coordinated and possess more active d-states, which can more strongly bond with O atoms compared to terrace Pt atoms. Additionally, with the exposure of the second layer atoms at the surface vacancy, it is possible to form a much stronger OM bond compared to the OPt bond. This is observed in the search for the optimum structure after a Pt removal, which shows that the surface vacancy is preferentially terminated by O atoms that sink to bond with the solute M atoms at the second layer. For example, in Pt2Ti skin alloys, the surface vacancies with a configuration containing OTi bonding are much more stable than those with only OPt bonding. This is consistent with the fact that atomic O on metals is anion-like, with a strong tendency to accept electrons, and prefers to form ionic-bonds. The stability of Pt alloys under electrochemical conditions is generally lower than that of pure Pt when the oxygen coverage is the same, and maintaining zero oxygen coverage at working potentials (such as 0.9 V) is crucial for achieving both high activity and stability. Among more than 20 different Pt2M alloys, molybdenum (Mo) is identified as a good element that can alloy with Pt to form a stable surface at high electrochemical potentials. Pt2Mo has a lower kinetic barrier for oxygen reduction (OR) compared to Pt, and the barrier to OOH dissociation is a key kinetic parameter for OR activity. The higher stability of clean alloy surfaces can indeed be inferred from the calculated Pt d-band structure, which shows that alloying generally leads to the stabilization of the Pt d-band, making surface Pt atoms more difficult to segregate or dissolve. The stability of surfaces follows the order Pt2Mo > Pt > Pt2Ag > Pt2Pd > Pt2Nb > Pt2Ti > Pt2Sc > Pt2Zr, and only Pt2Mo exhibits higher stability than pure Pt at high potential (1.05 V). The oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) on a Pt2Mo alloy surface follows a similar reaction profile as on Pt, with the transition state (TS) for OOH dissociation determining the height of the potential profile. The TSs for OOH dissociation and O2 dissociation dictate the highest free energy positions in the reaction pathways. The aqueous environment, together with the in situ oxygen coverage, plays an important role in facilitating the ORR on alloy surfaces. The stability of PtxMo alloys drops quickly with increasing potential, in line with the rapid increase of surface oxygen coverage for PtxMo surfaces above 0.9 V. The Pt2Mo skin alloy achieves the best balance of stability and activity. A low Mo content (below 30%, e.g., Pt5Mo) may achieve a higher stability at high potentials, but the activity is not better than Pt at 0.9 V, while a high Mo content (above 30%, e.g., PtMo) will start to destabilize the alloy and also reduce the activity.

The stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems such as CuPt near-surface alloys, are influenced by thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions. CO adsorption at elevated pressures and temperatures can pull the less reactive Cu to the surface, driven by the formation of a stable self-organized CO/CuPt surface alloy structure. This is rationalized by the significantly stronger PtCO bond when Cu is present in the first surface layer of Pt. The results suggest new possibilities for selective and dynamical engineering of alloy surfaces for catalysis, with implications for catalytic properties and performance in various applications, including water-gas shift reactions. DFT calculations confirm the observed Cu surface segregation and the weakening of the PtCO bond with increasing Cu content in the second layer. The onset of bulk migration of Cu is explained by the results with adsorbed CO, and the interdiffusion of Cu and Pt becomes significant at 460 K, where the formation and breakup of the stable CO-induced surface alloy start to occur. The results add to the promise of using molecular adsorbate-induced surface changes as a tool for selective and dynamical engineering of alloy surfaces, likely extending to a wide variety of coinage (Cu, Ag)/Pt-group bimetallic surface alloys.
The stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems such as Pt-3d alloys, are influenced by thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions. Contrary to expectations, CO adsorption at elevated pressures and temperatures can pull the less reactive Cu to the surface of a CuPt near-surface alloy, forming a stable self-organized CO/CuPt surface alloy structure. This is due to the significantly stronger PtCO bond when Cu is present in the first surface layer of Pt. The findings suggest new possibilities for selective and dynamical engineering of alloy surfaces for catalysis, potentially applicable to a range of coinage (Cu, Ag)/Pt-group bimetallic surface alloys.
The stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems such as Pt-3d alloys, are influenced by thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions. CO adsorption at elevated pressures and temperatures can pull the less reactive Cu to the surface of a CuPt near-surface alloy, driven by the formation of a stable self-organized CO/CuPt surface alloy structure. This is due to the drastically stronger PtCO bond when Cu is present in the first surface layer of Pt. The results are expected to apply to a range of coinage (Cu, Ag)/Pt-group bimetallic surface alloys. The bonding of adsorbates can induce changes in local atomic composition and surface structure, changing the activity and selectivity of the catalyst. The CuPt near-surface alloy (NSA) was suggested as a promising water-gas shift catalyst because of reduced PtCO bonding on a Pt catalyst surface with Cu present in the second layer. However, the NSA is unstable at elevated CO pressures and sample temperatures, forming instead a self-organized CO/CuPt surface alloy (SA) structure. The results are confirmed by extended density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Although Cu diffusion to the first layer is endothermic, the drastic increase in CO binding energy more than compensates for the endothermicity. The vastly increased PtCO bond strength when 2/3 ML of Cu is present in the first layer rationalizes the observed Cu surface segregation. The calculated higher stability of the CuPt SA compared with Cu in the bulk with CO adsorption on clean Pt(111) is nearly equal to the free-energy difference (ΔG). The interdiffusion of Cu and Pt becomes significant at 460 K, and the formation and breakup of the stable CO-induced surface alloy start to occur at this temperature. The DFT calculations reproduce the experimental observations and confirm the rationalization of the observed Cu surface segregation. The results for the CuPt system at elevated temperatures and CO pressures, where a novel stable CO-induced surface alloy forms, likely extend to a wide variety of coinage (Cu, Ag)/Pt-group bimetallic surface alloys.
The stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems such as Pt-3d alloys, are influenced by thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions. Contrary to expectations, CO adsorption at elevated pressures and temperatures causes the less reactive Cu to segregate to the surface of a CuPt near-surface alloy. This segregation is driven by the formation of a stable self-organized CO/CuPt surface alloy structure, which is explained by the significantly stronger PtCO bond when Cu is present in the first surface layer of Pt. These findings suggest new possibilities for selective and dynamic engineering of alloy surfaces for catalysis, which could apply to a variety of coinage (Cu, Ag)/Pt-group bimetallic surface alloys.

The thermodynamics and kinetics of oxygen-induced segregation of 3d metals in Pt-based systems, such as Pt-3d alloys, are influenced by factors including the crystal plane, which affects the stability of subsurface 3d metals. This has implications for the catalytic properties and performance of bimetallic catalysts in various applications, particularly in oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activity. The stability of subsurface 3d metals in Pt(111) and Pt(100) under oxygen exposure is predicted through Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations. The crystal plane has an effect on the subsurface stability of the bimetallic catalysts. These factors influence the surface segregation and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, which in turn affect their catalytic properties and performance in various applications.

The thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions significantly influence the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems such as Pt-3d alloys. Bimetallic catalysts exhibit greater surface structural complexity compared to monometallic catalysts, with the second metal, in either its metallic or oxidized state, being present on the surface, in the near-surface region, or embedded in the bulk region. The surface structure of bimetallic catalysts is crucial to their catalytic properties. For instance, Pt-based bimetallic catalysts with Pt-skin surfaces and 3d transition metals in the subsurface region demonstrate superior catalytic performance in many reactions compared to pure Pt surfaces. The structure of the catalyst surface often changes dynamically during reactions, similar to reversible surface processes observed in monometallic catalyst systems when the gaseous environment shifts between reductive and oxidative conditions. Bimetallic catalysts may exhibit a similar dependence of surface structure on the redox potential of reaction gases, providing an opportunity to adjust catalytic activity and selectivity.

The stability of bimetallic surface structures under reaction conditions is a critical factor in bimetallic catalysis, as it can modify catalytic properties. For example, under annealing conditions, the subsurface PtNiPt(111) structure is more thermodynamically stable than the surface NiPtPt(111) structure in vacuum. Pt3d alloys in fuel cell applications often have a Pt skin, indicating a thermodynamic preference for Pt-terminated bimetallic surfaces. The segregation energy (Eseg) determines whether the admetal segregates to the surface or remains in the subsurface, affecting the surface composition. Hydrogen-induced segregation is influenced by Eseg and the difference in hydrogen-binding energies on the surface and subsurface. Oxygen can destabilize the subsurface structure, driving subsurface 3d metals to segregate to the surface. Adsorbates with weak Pauling electronegativity have a small effect on the thermodynamic potential for interchanging surface and subsurface configurations, while those with strong Pauling electronegativity can significantly alter binding energy, leading to surface segregation when their coverage is high enough. Oxygen-induced surface segregation is also predicted for specific Pt-based alloy surfaces.

The thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions significantly influence the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems such as Pt-3d alloys. Under reductive conditions, such as vacuum and carbon monoxide, 3d transition metals prefer to occupy the subsurface layer due to their higher surface energy and smaller atomic size. However, under oxidizing conditions, the strong interaction between oxygen and 3d transition metals induces their segregation to the surface, leading to the formation of oxidized 3d transition metal islands. These structural changes have profound implications for the catalytic properties and performance of these materials in various applications. For instance, Pt(111) surfaces with atomic dispersed 3d transition metals in the surface layers exhibit high activity for CO oxidation through a bi-functional mechanism. The interplay between the structure, reaction environment, and catalytic activity is a critical factor in determining the performance of alloy catalysts.

The surface structures of PtNi, PtCo, and PtCu bimetallic catalysts exhibit reversible changes in response to the redox potential of the environmental gas. These changes can be controlled by treating the catalysts in various gases. Surface segregation is a common phenomenon in bimetallic surfaces, where a metal with a larger atomic radius tends to segregate to the surface to release strain. Platinum, with its larger atomic radius compared to cobalt, nickel, and copper, is more likely to segregate to the surface. The presence of hydrogen does not alter the thermodynamic driving force for surface segregation. Oxygen adsorption on Pt-M catalyst surfaces can induce the segregation of 3d transition metals to the top surface due to the strong bonding between oxygen and 3d transition metals. In oxidative environments, 3d transition metals can become oxidized, and the formed oxides tend to encapsulate platinum surfaces. The mass transport processes that occur during oxidation or reduction reactions are fully reversible, depending on the redox potential of the reaction gases. The reversible structural changes in Pt-based bimetallic catalysts have significant implications for real catalytic processes.

The stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems such as Pt-3d alloys, are influenced by thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions. Fe-Pt catalysts have been used in the preferential oxidation (PROX) of CO in excess H2, achieving high selectivity for CO oxidation. Pt-skin structures show high activity for catalyzing the hydrogenation of unsaturated hydrocarbons. The unique catalytic properties of the Pt-skin surfaces are attributed to the modification of the electronic structure of the surface Pt by the subsurface Fe underneath, influencing the adsorption and reaction characteristics of the surface species. The controlled preparation of various Fe-Pt surface structures allows for the derivation of the relationship between structure and catalytic properties, aiding in the design of high-performance and low-cost catalysts. The stability of the Pt-skin structure can be reduced under certain circumstances, such as an oxidative environment, leading to gas-induced Fe surface segregation. The structural configuration of the catalyst can be transformed between surface Fe or FeO and subsurface Fe on the Pt(111) surface by cycles of oxidation and reduction. These transformations have implications for the catalytic properties and performance of the catalysts in various applications, including oxygen reduction reactions, hydrogenation of unsaturated hydrocarbons, and the preferential oxidation of CO in excess H2. Depending on the preparation procedures and reaction conditions, Fe overlayers with either metallic or oxidized states may be present as the topmost surface or in the subsurface region of Pt. Different reactions can produce different Fe-Pt surface structural configurations. For oxygen reduction reactions (ORR), Pt-skin structures with Fe or some other transition metals in the subsurface regions showed a higher activity than pure Pt. For instance, Fe49Pt51 alloys with 100% Pt as the topmost layer had 25 times the activity of pure Pt catalysts in ORR. The optimization of the performance of Fe-Pt structures in magnetism and catalysis places a high demand on the design and control of the surface structural configurations and needs information on the stability of the various structures at elevated temperatures and under different reaction atmospheres.

Surface segregation in bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems such as Pt-3d alloys, is influenced by thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions. This phenomenon is crucial in materials science, catalysis, and surface chemistry, affecting properties like permeation, surface adsorption, crystal growth, and metal corrosion. Surface segregation can significantly alter the catalytic activities of alloys, as evidenced by enhanced oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activities in Pt alloys with 3d metals compared to pure Pt. The unusual catalytic activity, closely related to surface segregation, has sparked extensive research. Most studies have focused on understanding surface and subsurface structures and electronic properties under vacuum conditions. However, catalytic reactions like the ORR occur under environments with various adsorbates, which can influence surface segregation trends and change the surface composition of alloys. Therefore, studying the segregation trend of Pt-based alloys under surface adsorption is critical for understanding their catalytic properties and performance in various applications.

The stability and surface segregation tendencies of PdRu/Ru(0001) and PtRu/Ru(0001) surface alloys were studied using scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and Auger electron spectroscopy (AES). The results showed that after Ru deposition and subsequent re-alloying, the original surface alloy composition was almost completely restored, indicating that the buried Pd and Pt almost completely segregated to the surface layer. There was a slight loss of Pt during the re-alloying step. The slight differences in the stability of the surface alloy may be due to the lower Pd content (44%) in the surface alloy compared to Pt (70%). The preference for surface segregation of a metal atom dissolved in a host metal is related to the difference in surface energies of the two species and the difference in the optimal nearest-neighbor distances of host and guest metal. The surface energies decrease in the order Ru(0001) (1.31.6 eVatom1), Pt(111) (1 eVatom1) and Pd(111) (0.8 eVatom1), which is in good agreement with the observed tendency for segregation of Pt and Pd. The size mismatch of the larger guest metals Pt (0.277 nm) and Pd (0.275 nm) compared to the Ru(0001) single crystal (0.270 nm) would favor the inclusion of the impurity metals in the tensile stressed outermost Ru layer, providing additional driving force for surface segregation. The floating behavior was studied by following the variation in the surface morphology and structure during a series of four preparation steps: deposition of Pt (Pd) on Ru(0001), surface alloy formation by annealing, deposition of Ru on the surface alloy at 500 K, and re-alloying by annealing. The probability that a small amount of Pt (Pd) on Ru(0001) is dissolved in the subsurface region (buried by a layer of substrate material) during surface alloy formation can be estimated by a simple Boltzmann approach. The observation of a distinct bilayer island growth of Ru on the Pt0.70Ru0.30/Ru(0001) surface alloy at 500 K, in contrast to the layer-by-layer Ru growth on Pd0.44Ru0.56/Ru(0001) under similar growth conditions, may be attributed to the lower Pd content, the different 2D distribution of the components in the latter surface alloy with more Ru3 surface sites as compared to Pt0.70Ru0.30/Ru(0001), or to a less pronounced difference between RuRu bonding and RuPd bonding.

The study uses density functional theory to investigate oxygen adsorption and its impact on surface segregation in Pt(shell)/M(core) and Pt3M (M = Co, Ir) alloys on (211) surfaces. Oxygen adsorbs most favorably at the bridge site over and parallel to the (100) step. Surface segregation is observed in Pt3Co, Pt3Ir, and Pt/Co(core) systems. The Pt/Ir(core) structure exhibits antisegregation behavior even when oxygen is adsorbed. The arrangement of atoms in the first 23 layers of the catalyst surface significantly affects the catalytic activity of alloys, and surface segregation plays a crucial role in this. Characterizing the surface atomic distribution and understanding the effect of segregation on surface structure are important for catalytic alloys.

Thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions significantly influence the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems such as Pt-3d alloys. The lower surface free energy of Au compared to Pt makes it energetically favorable for Au to remain at the surface when Au is deposited on top of Pt. The immiscibility of Au and Pt at Au compositions greater than 17% also suggests that Au should remain on top of the Pt clusters. The adsorption of CO on the PtAu clusters at room temperature promotes the diffusion of Pt to the surface of the clusters, and this phenomenon is most pronounced for the clusters that are initially pure Au at the surface. Density functional theory calculations demonstrate that it is thermodynamically favorable for Pt to diffuse to the cluster surface in order to bind to CO. For CO oxidation, the first step in the reaction is the dissociation of O2 at Pt sites. Since this process requires more than one contiguous Pt site, it is not surprising that O2 dissociation cannot occur on the PtAu clusters that are 100% Au at the surface before CO exposure, given the low probability for ensembles of Pt sites to form at the surface. In contrast, CO oxidation does not occur at the cluster surfaces that are initially pure Au, presumably because the first step in the oxidation process is O2 dissociation, which requires neighboring Pt sites. These factors have consequent implications for the catalytic properties and performance of bimetallic catalysts in various applications.

The stability of Pt3dPt subsurface structures in various conditions is a critical factor in their catalytic properties and performance. These structures are desirable in heterogeneous catalysis and electrocatalysis. DFT predictions indicate that these structures are stable in vacuum and with adsorbed hydrogen, but with adsorbed oxygen, the 3d atoms should segregate to the surface. These predictions have been experimentally verified on selected Pt3dPt(111) systems and expanded to polycrystalline Pt to understand the effects of multiple crystal facets on the kinetic barriers for the segregation of subsurface 3d atoms. The Pt3dPt subsurface structures are predicted to have higher activation barriers for oxygen-induced segregation compared to the respective Pt3dPt(111) configuration. The PtNiPt system is the most resistant to oxygen-induced segregation, while the PtTiPt configuration is the most susceptible. The stability of these structures in vacuum and with adsorbed hydrogen and oxygen has been demonstrated through DFT calculations and experimental verification on both single crystal Pt(111) and polycrystalline Pt foil. Using combined theoretical and experimental approaches, the relative stability of surface and subsurface bimetallic structures can be quantified and general trends predicted. The difference in the occupied d-band center, Δεd, can be used to screen potential bimetallic alloys with desirable stability in different environments. A BrnstedEvansPolanyi relationship has been derived to correlate thermodynamic stability from DFT calculations with kinetic barriers from experimental measurements for the Pt3dPt systems. Empirical equations have been developed to predict the thermodynamic stability of other bimetallic systems in various conditions. The large difference in binding energies between surface and subsurface structures highlights the need to understand their stability in reacting environments. For Pt3d bimetallic systems, the difference in oxygen binding energy for these configurations is on the order of hundreds of kcal/mol. Based on Sabatier's principle, if a subsurface alloy structure exhibits optimal binding properties for dehydrogenation and ORR, the surface structure would likely bind intermediates too strongly, halting the reaction. Conversely, if the surface alloy structure exhibits optimal binding properties for steam reforming, the subsurface structure would bind adsorbates too weakly, preventing the reaction from proceeding. The stability of bimetallic structures has been considered with various atomic species, which can be extended to more complex adsorbates using scaling relationships. DFT results predict that subsurface PtMPt(111) configurations are preferred in vacuum and with 0.5 ML H, while surface MPtPt(111) configurations are preferred with 0.5 ML O. Experimental measurements have verified the predicted segregation of subsurface 3d atoms in the presence of oxygen and quantified the activation barrier for adsorbate-induced segregation. AES results suggest two regions of segregation, revealing that DFT predictions and experimental measurements on single crystal bimetallic surfaces are applicable to polycrystalline substrates, bridging the materials gap. Predictions show that all Pt3dPt(100) structures have a higher activation barrier for oxygen-induced segregation compared to respective Pt3dPt(111) configurations. Linear trends in all systems show that the correlation of thermodynamic stability with the difference in d-band center can be used beyond Pt3d alloys. Switching the admetal/host component shifts the absolute driving potential of the segregation. This general stability trend predicts that all bimetallic systems have the same thermodynamically preferred configuration in each environment, with subsurface configurations preferred in vacuum and with 0.5 ML H, and surface configurations favored with 0.5 ML O.

The thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions influence the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems such as Pt-3d alloys. The simulation results showed that the Pd atoms would segregate into the outermost layers of the extended surfaces and the Pt concentration would increase monotonically from the extended surfaces into the bulk. The equilibrium PtPd nanoparticles were found to have Pd-enriched shells and Pt-enriched cores. In the shell of the PtPd nanoparticles, the Pd atoms were predicted to preferably segregate to the (100) facets rather than the (111) facets. These phenomena have consequent implications for their catalytic properties and performance in various applications.

The stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems such as Pt-3d alloys, are influenced by thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions. The dissolution of Fe atoms in a PtFe alloy under specific conditions leads to the formation of a Pt skin layer with predominantly (111)-oriented facets. This process is investigated using in situ electrochemical scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) in a 0.1 M HClO4 solution. The potential cycles applied to the PtFe film result in increased dissolution of Fe and the rearrangement of Pt at the surface, forming a protective Pt skin layer. This layer protects the underlying PtFe alloy from corrosion, which has implications for the catalytic properties and performance of the alloy in fuel cell applications. Further studies on the Pt skin layer, such as the adsorption and oxidation of CO, are being conducted to better understand its electrocatalytic behavior.

The literature does not provide specific information on how thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions influence the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems such as Pt-3d alloys, and what are the consequent implications for their catalytic properties and performance in various applications. However, it does mention that the design of high performance cathode electrocatalysts is essential for polymer electrolyte fuel cells, and that the enhancement of electrocatalytic activity of Pt by alloying with Fe results in a maximum activity at ca. 50% Fe content, which is 25 times higher than pure Pt activity. The enhancement could be well explained by the 5d-vacancy of the surface, but not by Pt interatomic distance or roughening of the surfaces.

The stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems such as Pt-3d alloys, are influenced by thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions. Platinum is a popular cathode electrocatalyst in PEM fuel cells, but its slow kinetics for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) limits catalytic efficiency. In recent years, Pt-based alloys, which include Pt and other transition metals, have been extensively studied due to their enhanced ORR activity. Surface segregation plays a key role in this process, leading to the formation of a pure Pt-skin in the outermost layer of the alloys. This surface segregation is closely related to the enhanced stability of Pt-based catalysts. Au shows strong surface segregation in PtAu alloys, whereas Co is usually unable to enrich PtCo alloy surfaces. The process of Au segregating from the second layer to the surface is exothermic, indicating that Au surface segregation is thermodynamically favorable. However, for the PtCo alloy, the surface Co atoms have a stronger tendency to migrate to the second layer, making the continuous segregation of Co unlikely. Therefore, Co segregating to the clean Pt(111) surface is both thermodynamically unfavorable and kinetically prohibitive. Surface segregation has been found to play a key role in the process of Pt-based alloys. For instance, Stamenkovic et al. found that the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is uniquely active on Pt-skin surfaces, and the reaction rate is four times that of the pure Pt catalyst. Numerous studies have been carried out using modern experimental and computational techniques to understand the importance of surface segregation for Pt-based alloys. For many Pt alloy systems, segregation trends have been unambiguously identified, and the components of surface and subsurface regions have successfully been characterized. The dissolution of metal atoms results in some defects on the alloy surface, which are critical to the rearrangement process. The phenomenon can also be observed in acidic solution, often with dissolution of the alloyed metal and rearrangement of Pt atoms. The segregation process includes interlayer migration of the impurity atom, vacancy movement at the second layer, and vacancy regeneration at the surface layer. The segregation model can successfully interpret these phenomena, particularly from a kinetics viewpoint. The pathway from 1 to 4 describes a complete cycle in which an impurity atom in the second layer segregates to the Pt(111) surface. The process is exothermic for the PtAu system, whereas it is endothermic for the PtCo system. Therefore, Co segregating to the clean Pt(111) surface is both thermodynamically unfavorable and kinetically prohibitive according to the model.

The thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions significantly influence the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems such as Pt-3d alloys. The introduction of 3d metals into the Pt(111) system considerably alters the surface adsorption properties, which can be considerably modified by the 3d metals. The electronic structure of the surface Pt atoms only differs very slightly for the segregated and nonsegregated alloys. The discrepant adsorption properties are therefore mainly attributed to the direct involvement of 3d metals either on the surface or in the subsurface. The stability of Pt atoms of Pt-skin surfaces of the three alloys is enhanced with respect to those in pure Pt surfaces. Such stability enhancement is observed both in clean surfaces and under 0.25 ML of adsorbed atomic oxygen, and the degree of stability enhancement follows the opposite order of the oxygen adsorption strengths in the three studied alloys, indicating the protective role of the 3d subsurface atoms determined by their strong binding to the Pt surface layer. The presence of 3d metals in the alloys modifies the electronic and geometric properties, altering the binding strength of adsorbates. This can lead to enhanced catalytic properties and performance in various applications, such as increased oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) rate and improved electrochemical stability against dissolution. The formation of a Pt-skin layer on the surface of Pt-3d alloys, accompanied by a Pt-depleted layer underneath, is a result of surface segregation that can facilitate the removal of adsorbed species, increasing the ORR rate. The stability enhancement of Pt-skin surfaces is associated with a positive potential shift, indicating that the dissolution of Pt atoms is delayed to higher potentials. The presence of adsorbates, such as oxygen, can affect the stability of the catalysts, but Pt-skin surfaces from the alloys still show enhanced stability compared to pure Pt under adsorbate coverage.

The literature does not provide specific information on how thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions influence the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems such as Pt-3d alloys, and the consequent implications for their catalytic properties and performance in various applications. However, it does discuss the effects of annealing temperature on the structural and chemical properties of bimetallic PtRu/Ru(0001) surfaces, which can be related to the broader question. The study shows that annealing leads to changes in the surface morphology from Pt islands on the Ru substrate to a PtRu/Ru(0001) surface alloy, which significantly alters the adsorption properties of the surface. This can be attributed to changes in the composition of the adsorption ensembles and electronic interactions between the metallic constituents upon alloy formation. These changes have implications for the catalytic properties of the surface, as they can affect the activity and selectivity of the catalyst. The literature also discusses the structural and chemical properties of bimetallic PtRu/Ru(0001) model catalysts and their modification upon stepwise annealing of a submonolayer Pt-covered Ru(0001) surface up to the formation of an equilibrated PtxRu1-x/Ru(0001) monolayer surface alloy. The study reveals that the surface structure significantly affects the adsorption properties of the bimetallic surface, which can be explained by changes in the composition of the adsorption ensembles (ensemble effects) for D adsorption and by changes in the electronic interaction (ligand effects, strain effects) of the metallic constituents for CO and D adsorption upon alloy formation. The surface structure and distribution of the components in the topmost layer are accessible by scanning tunneling microscopy (STM), and that the adsorption properties of the bimetallic surface can be explained by changes of the composition of the adsorption ensembles (ensemble effects) for D adsorption and by changes in the electronic interaction (ligand effects, strain effects) of the metallic constituents for CO and D adsorption upon alloy formation. The study reveals that the surface structure significantly affects the adsorption properties of the bimetallic surface, which can be explained by changes in the composition of the adsorption ensembles (ensemble effects) for D adsorption and by changes in the electronic interaction (ligand effects, strain effects) of the metallic constituents for CO and D adsorption upon alloy formation. The study shows that annealing leads to changes in the surface morphology from Pt islands on the Ru substrate to PtRu/Ru(0001) surface alloys, inducing significant changes in the adsorption properties of CO and deuterium. These changes can be attributed to ensemble effects for D adsorption and electronic interaction effects for CO and D adsorption upon alloy formation. The results demonstrate the sensitivity of probe molecule adsorption to the local structure and composition of a bimetallic surface, even for a combination of two chemically active metals such as Ru and Pt.

The stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems such as Pt-3d alloys, are influenced by thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions. Surface segregation, where one metal species enriches the surface or the first sub-surface layers over other components, has significant implications for materials science and surface chemistry. It affects physical and chemical properties such as permeation, surface adsorption, crystal growth, and metal corrosion. Notably, the catalytic activities of alloys can be dramatically altered through surface segregation. Pt, an efficient catalyst used in important chemical reactions like methanol oxidation and hydrocarbon reforming, is the most widely used electrocatalyst for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in fuel cells. Efforts to find alternative catalysts to Pt have focused on Pt-based bimetallic alloys, where some platinum is replaced by less expensive metals. The catalytic properties of these alloys are determined by the surface geometry and electronic structure, which can be modified by the chemical composition, leading to improved catalytic effects when appropriate structures are achieved. Enhanced ORR activities have been observed in Pt alloys with 3d metals, with surface segregation playing a key role. For example, Stamenkovic et al. found that the ORR on Pt-skin structures produced by Pt segregating on the surface of annealed Pt3Co alloys is uniquely active, with a reaction rate four times that of pure Pt. The enhanced activities can be attributed to the surface electronic structure and surface bond length of alloy systems. The surface geometry can considerably alter catalytic efficiency, but for Pt3Co (1 1 1) and Pt3Ni (1 1 1) systems, the maximum deviation of the surface bond length after Pt segregation is only 0.002 Å, indicating that the geometric effect does not contribute to the enhanced ORR activities of Pt-skin surfaces. Instead, the electronic structures modified through surface segregation are the main factor for such enhancement. Theoretical approaches can help to elucidate the driving force and the tendency of this phenomenon. Surface segregation is also governed by temperature and by the presence of adsorbates.

The literature does not provide specific information on how thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions influence the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems such as Pt-3d alloys, and the consequent implications for their catalytic properties and performance in various applications. However, it does discuss the growth of silver on a Pt(1 0 0) surface and the evolution of the structure with increasing temperature, which can be related to the stability and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts. At room temperature, the formation of elongated 2D-adislands with a composition of Ag80Pt20 was observed. Annealing of the sample above 600 K causes more extensive alloying starting at the perimeter of the Ag adislands by AgPt exchange and formation of a nanophasic AgPt alloy confined to the surface layer. With sufficient Ag, this alloy spreads across the surface until a uniform stoichiometry is established over the entire surface. Temperature-dependent AES studies indicate that there is some mixing of Ag with bulk Pt at elevated temperatures. These findings suggest that the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts can be influenced by thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions, which in turn can affect their catalytic properties and performance in various applications.

Ternary alloys have a strong tendency for platinum surface segregation, forming a platinum monolayer on their surfaces. This top platinum monolayer results in relatively weaker binding strengths of oxygen and hydroxyl groups in the ternary alloys, indicating enhanced activity for the oxygen reduction reaction compared to bimetallic alloy surfaces. Additionally, the platinum-skin surfaces of ternary alloys exhibit improved electrochemical stability against the dissolution of platinum atoms from the alloy surface.

The stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems such as Pt-3d alloys, are influenced by thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions. Some near-surface alloys (NSAs) bind atomic hydrogen as weakly as noble metals while dissociating H2 more easily, which is beneficial for hydrogen-related reactions. Hydrogen chemistry on NSAs is crucial for many chemical and pharmaceutical processes. Density functional theory calculations are used to develop new NSAs for these processes. Selected NSAs allow weak hydrogen binding and low H2 dissociation barriers, which is an exception to the general rule. The lowering of the transition-state energy is observed even on non-ideal NSAs, although the effect is less pronounced. NSAs promise high hydrogenation activity at low temperatures, which is beneficial for the production of chiral pharmaceutical compounds and could potentially permit easier separation and storage of hydrogen. The stability of near-surface alloys (NSAs) can be assessed using a two-step procedure: first, considering the composition in vacuum, and then accounting for the effects of hydrogen adsorption. Adsorbates can draw to the surface components of alloys to which they bind strongly. The tendency of hydrogen to induce surface segregation can be estimated by comparing the segregation energy (Eseg) of the solute to the difference in the magnitudes of the hydrogen binding energies between the pure solute and the pure host. Real NSAs may differ from idealized models, but these deviations do not substantially affect the main trends in adsorbate behavior. Some experimental studies have shown significantly modified catalytic activity on non-ideal NSAs, in line with theoretical predictions.

The thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions can influence the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems such as Pt-3d alloys. The addition of a third transition metal element M can modify the driving energy for Pt segregation to the outermost layer of Pt3Ni (111) surface. Transition metals V, Fe, Co, Mo, Tc, Ru, W, Re, Os, and Ir were predicted to lead to even more negative Pt surface segregation energies than that in the based Pt3Ni (111) surface, further promoting Pt surface segregation. In contrast, doping transition metals Ag, Au, and Pd would lead to positive segregation energies and hence suppress the Pt surface segregation in the corresponding Pt3Ni/M (111) surface. The surface energy effect, strain effect, and heat of solution effect induced by the doped element M would collectively affect the Pt surface segregation energy in the Pt3Ni/M (111) surfaces. The extent of Pt surface segregation is determined by the relative Pt surface segregation energy, lattice mismatch, and heat of solution of the Pt3M crystal with respect to those of the Pt3Ni crystal. Replacing Ni with transition metals V, Fe, Co, Mo, Tc, Ru, W, Re, Os, and Ir would lead to even stronger Pt segregation extent to the surface while replacing Ni with transition metals Ag, Au, and Pd could completely prohibit Pt segregating to the surface.

The stability of Pt-based alloys, such as Pt-3d alloys, is influenced by the oxygen coverage under electrochemical conditions. Alloys are generally less stable than pure Pt at the same oxygen coverage. Maintaining zero oxygen coverage at working potentials is crucial for achieving both high activity and stability. The stability of clean alloy surfaces can be inferred from the calculated Pt d-band structure, which shows that alloying generally leads to the stabilization of the Pt d-band, making surface Pt atoms more difficult to segregate or dissolve. However, in the presence of adsorbed O atoms, the removal of Pt is facilitated because the surface vacancy can be more strongly stabilized by O atoms. This is due to the fact that Pt atoms at the surface vacancy are less coordinated and possess more active d-states, which can more strongly bond with O atoms compared to terrace Pt atoms. Additionally, with the exposure of the second layer atoms at the surface vacancy, it is possible to form a much stronger OM bond compared to the OPt bond. This is observed in the search for the optimum structure after a Pt removal, which shows that the surface vacancy is preferentially terminated by O atoms that sink to bond with the solute M atoms at the second layer. For example, in Pt2Ti skin alloys, the surface vacancies with a configuration containing OTi bonding are much more stable than those with only OPt bonding. This is consistent with the fact that atomic O on metals is anion-like, with a strong tendency to accept electrons, and prefers to form ionic-bonds. The stability of Pt alloys under electrochemical conditions is generally lower than that of pure Pt when the oxygen coverage is the same, and maintaining zero oxygen coverage at working potentials (such as 0.9 V) is crucial for achieving both high activity and stability. Among more than 20 different Pt2M alloys, molybdenum (Mo) is identified as a good element that can alloy with Pt to form a stable surface at high electrochemical potentials. Pt2Mo has a lower kinetic barrier for oxygen reduction (OR) compared to Pt, and the barrier to OOH dissociation is a key kinetic parameter for OR activity. The higher stability of clean alloy surfaces can indeed be inferred from the calculated Pt d-band structure, which shows that alloying generally leads to the stabilization of the Pt d-band, making surface Pt atoms more difficult to segregate or dissolve. The stability of surfaces follows the order Pt2Mo > Pt > Pt2Ag > Pt2Pd > Pt2Nb > Pt2Ti > Pt2Sc > Pt2Zr, and only Pt2Mo exhibits higher stability than pure Pt at high potential (1.05 V). The oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) on a Pt2Mo alloy surface follows a similar reaction profile as on Pt, with the transition state (TS) for OOH dissociation determining the height of the potential profile. The TSs for OOH dissociation and O2 dissociation dictate the highest free energy positions in the reaction pathways. The aqueous environment, together with the in situ oxygen coverage, plays an important role in facilitating the ORR on alloy surfaces. The stability of PtxMo alloys drops quickly with increasing potential, in line with the rapid increase of surface oxygen coverage for PtxMo surfaces above 0.9 V. The Pt2Mo skin alloy achieves the best balance of stability and activity. A low Mo content (below 30%, e.g., Pt5Mo) may achieve a higher stability at high potentials, but the activity is not better than Pt at 0.9 V, while a high Mo content (above 30%, e.g., PtMo) will start to destabilize the alloy and also reduce the activity.

The stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems such as CuPt near-surface alloys, are influenced by thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions. CO adsorption at elevated pressures and temperatures can pull the less reactive Cu to the surface, driven by the formation of a stable self-organized CO/CuPt surface alloy structure. This is rationalized by the significantly stronger PtCO bond when Cu is present in the first surface layer of Pt. The results suggest new possibilities for selective and dynamical engineering of alloy surfaces for catalysis, with implications for catalytic properties and performance in various applications, including water-gas shift reactions. DFT calculations confirm the observed Cu surface segregation and the weakening of the PtCO bond with increasing Cu content in the second layer. The onset of bulk migration of Cu is explained by the results with adsorbed CO, and the interdiffusion of Cu and Pt becomes significant at 460 K, where the formation and breakup of the stable CO-induced surface alloy start to occur. The results add to the promise of using molecular adsorbate-induced surface changes as a tool for selective and dynamical engineering of alloy surfaces, likely extending to a wide variety of coinage (Cu, Ag)/Pt-group bimetallic surface alloys.
The stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems such as Pt-3d alloys, are influenced by thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions. Contrary to expectations, CO adsorption at elevated pressures and temperatures can pull the less reactive Cu to the surface of a CuPt near-surface alloy, forming a stable self-organized CO/CuPt surface alloy structure. This is due to the significantly stronger PtCO bond when Cu is present in the first surface layer of Pt. The findings suggest new possibilities for selective and dynamical engineering of alloy surfaces for catalysis, potentially applicable to a range of coinage (Cu, Ag)/Pt-group bimetallic surface alloys.

CO adsorption at elevated pressures and temperatures can pull the less reactive Cu to the surface of a CuPt near-surface alloy, driven by the formation of a stable self-organized CO/CuPt surface alloy structure. This is due to the drastically stronger PtCO bond when Cu is present in the first surface layer of Pt. The results are expected to apply to a range of coinage (Cu, Ag)/Pt-group bimetallic surface alloys. The bonding of adsorbates can induce changes in local atomic composition and surface structure, changing the activity and selectivity of the catalyst. The CuPt near-surface alloy (NSA) was suggested as a promising water-gas shift catalyst because of reduced PtCO bonding on a Pt catalyst surface with Cu present in the second layer. However, the NSA is unstable at elevated CO pressures and sample temperatures, forming instead a self-organized CO/CuPt surface alloy (SA) structure. The results are confirmed by extended density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Although Cu diffusion to the first layer is endothermic, the drastic increase in CO binding energy more than compensates for the endothermicity. The vastly increased PtCO bond strength when 2/3 ML of Cu is present in the first layer rationalizes the observed Cu surface segregation. The calculated higher stability of the CuPt SA compared with Cu in the bulk with CO adsorption on clean Pt(111) is nearly equal to the free-energy difference (ΔG). The interdiffusion of Cu and Pt becomes significant at 460 K, and the formation and breakup of the stable CO-induced surface alloy start to occur at this temperature. The DFT calculations reproduce the experimental observations and confirm the rationalization of the observed Cu surface segregation. The results for the CuPt system at elevated temperatures and CO pressures, where a novel stable CO-induced surface alloy forms, likely extend to a wide variety of coinage (Cu, Ag)/Pt-group bimetallic surface alloys.
The stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems such as Pt-3d alloys, are influenced by thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions. Contrary to expectations, CO adsorption at elevated pressures and temperatures causes the less reactive Cu to segregate to the surface of a CuPt near-surface alloy. This segregation is driven by the formation of a stable self-organized CO/CuPt surface alloy structure, which is explained by the significantly stronger PtCO bond when Cu is present in the first surface layer of Pt. These findings suggest new possibilities for selective and dynamic engineering of alloy surfaces for catalysis, which could apply to a variety of coinage (Cu, Ag)/Pt-group bimetallic surface alloys.

The thermodynamics and kinetics of oxygen-induced segregation of 3d metals in Pt-based systems, such as Pt-3d alloys, are influenced by factors including the crystal plane, which affects the stability of subsurface 3d metals. This has implications for the catalytic properties and performance of bimetallic catalysts in various applications, particularly in oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activity. The stability of subsurface 3d metals in Pt(111) and Pt(100) under oxygen exposure is predicted through Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations. The crystal plane has an effect on the subsurface stability of the bimetallic catalysts. These factors influence the surface segregation and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, which in turn affect their catalytic properties and performance in various applications.

The thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions significantly influence the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems such as Pt-3d alloys. Bimetallic catalysts exhibit greater surface structural complexity compared to monometallic catalysts, with the second metal, in either its metallic or oxidized state, being present on the surface, in the near-surface region, or embedded in the bulk region. The surface structure of bimetallic catalysts is crucial to their catalytic properties. For instance, Pt-based bimetallic catalysts with Pt-skin surfaces and 3d transition metals in the subsurface region demonstrate superior catalytic performance in many reactions compared to pure Pt surfaces. The structure of the catalyst surface often changes dynamically during reactions, similar to reversible surface processes observed in monometallic catalyst systems when the gaseous environment shifts between reductive and oxidative conditions. Bimetallic catalysts may exhibit a similar dependence of surface structure on the redox potential of reaction gases, providing an opportunity to adjust catalytic activity and selectivity.

The stability of bimetallic surface structures under reaction conditions is a critical factor in bimetallic catalysis, as it can modify catalytic properties. For example, under annealing conditions, the subsurface PtNiPt(111) structure is more thermodynamically stable than the surface NiPtPt(111) structure in vacuum. Pt3d alloys in fuel cell applications often have a Pt skin, indicating a thermodynamic preference for Pt-terminated bimetallic surfaces. The segregation energy (Eseg) determines whether the admetal segregates to the surface or remains in the subsurface, affecting the surface composition. Hydrogen-induced segregation is influenced by Eseg and the difference in hydrogen-binding energies on the surface and subsurface. Oxygen can destabilize the subsurface structure, driving subsurface 3d metals to segregate to the surface. Adsorbates with weak Pauling electronegativity have a small effect on the thermodynamic potential for interchanging surface and subsurface configurations, while those with strong Pauling electronegativity can significantly alter binding energy, leading to surface segregation when their coverage is high enough. Oxygen-induced surface segregation is also predicted for specific Pt-based alloy surfaces.

The thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions significantly influence the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems such as Pt-3d alloys. Under reductive conditions, such as vacuum and carbon monoxide, 3d transition metals prefer to occupy the subsurface layer due to their higher surface energy and smaller atomic size. However, under oxidizing conditions, the strong interaction between oxygen and 3d transition metals induces their segregation to the surface, leading to the formation of oxidized 3d transition metal islands. These structural changes have profound implications for the catalytic properties and performance of these materials in various applications. For instance, Pt(111) surfaces with atomic dispersed 3d transition metals in the surface layers exhibit high activity for CO oxidation through a bi-functional mechanism. The interplay between the structure, reaction environment, and catalytic activity is a critical factor in determining the performance of alloy catalysts.

The surface structures of PtNi, PtCo, and PtCu bimetallic catalysts exhibit reversible changes in response to the redox potential of the environmental gas. These changes can be controlled by treating the catalysts in various gases. Surface segregation is a common phenomenon in bimetallic surfaces, where a metal with a larger atomic radius tends to segregate to the surface to release strain. Platinum, with its larger atomic radius compared to cobalt, nickel, and copper, is more likely to segregate to the surface. The presence of hydrogen does not alter the thermodynamic driving force for surface segregation. Oxygen adsorption on Pt-M catalyst surfaces can induce the segregation of 3d transition metals to the top surface due to the strong bonding between oxygen and 3d transition metals. In oxidative environments, 3d transition metals can become oxidized, and the formed oxides tend to encapsulate platinum surfaces. The mass transport processes that occur during oxidation or reduction reactions are fully reversible, depending on the redox potential of the reaction gases. The reversible structural changes in Pt-based bimetallic catalysts have significant implications for real catalytic processes.

The stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems such as Pt-3d alloys, are influenced by thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions. Fe-Pt catalysts have been used in the preferential oxidation (PROX) of CO in excess H2, achieving high selectivity for CO oxidation. Pt-skin structures show high activity for catalyzing the hydrogenation of unsaturated hydrocarbons. The unique catalytic properties of the Pt-skin surfaces are attributed to the modification of the electronic structure of the surface Pt by the subsurface Fe underneath, influencing the adsorption and reaction characteristics of the surface species. The controlled preparation of various Fe-Pt surface structures allows for the derivation of the relationship between structure and catalytic properties, aiding in the design of high-performance and low-cost catalysts. The stability of the Pt-skin structure can be reduced under certain circumstances, such as an oxidative environment, leading to gas-induced Fe surface segregation. The structural configuration of the catalyst can be transformed between surface Fe or FeO and subsurface Fe on the Pt(111) surface by cycles of oxidation and reduction. These transformations have implications for the catalytic properties and performance of the catalysts in various applications, including oxygen reduction reactions, hydrogenation of unsaturated hydrocarbons, and the preferential oxidation of CO in excess H2. Depending on the preparation procedures and reaction conditions, Fe overlayers with either metallic or oxidized states may be present as the topmost surface or in the subsurface region of Pt. Different reactions can produce different Fe-Pt surface structural configurations. For oxygen reduction reactions (ORR), Pt-skin structures with Fe or some other transition metals in the subsurface regions showed a higher activity than pure Pt. For instance, Fe49Pt51 alloys with 100% Pt as the topmost layer had 25 times the activity of pure Pt catalysts in ORR. The optimization of the performance of Fe-Pt structures in magnetism and catalysis places a high demand on the design and control of the surface structural configurations and needs information on the stability of the various structures at elevated temperatures and under different reaction atmospheres.

Surface segregation in bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems such as Pt-3d alloys, is influenced by thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions. This phenomenon is crucial in materials science, catalysis, and surface chemistry, affecting properties like permeation, surface adsorption, crystal growth, and metal corrosion. Surface segregation can significantly alter the catalytic activities of alloys, as evidenced by enhanced oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activities in Pt alloys with 3d metals compared to pure Pt. The unusual catalytic activity, closely related to surface segregation, has sparked extensive research. Most studies have focused on understanding surface and subsurface structures and electronic properties under vacuum conditions. However, catalytic reactions like the ORR occur under environments with various adsorbates, which can influence surface segregation trends and change the surface composition of alloys. Therefore, studying the segregation trend of Pt-based alloys under surface adsorption is critical for understanding their catalytic properties and performance in various applications.

The stability and surface segregation tendencies of PdRu/Ru(0001) and PtRu/Ru(0001) surface alloys were studied using scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and Auger electron spectroscopy (AES). The results showed that after Ru deposition and subsequent re-alloying, the original surface alloy composition was almost completely restored, indicating that the buried Pd and Pt almost completely segregated to the surface layer. There was a slight loss of Pt during the re-alloying step. The slight differences in the stability of the surface alloy may be due to the lower Pd content (44%) in the surface alloy compared to Pt (70%). The preference for surface segregation of a metal atom dissolved in a host metal is related to the difference in surface energies of the two species and the difference in the optimal nearest-neighbor distances of host and guest metal. The surface energies decrease in the order Ru(0001) (1.31.6 eVatom1), Pt(111) (1 eVatom1) and Pd(111) (0.8 eVatom1), which is in good agreement with the observed tendency for segregation of Pt and Pd. The size mismatch of the larger guest metals Pt (0.277 nm) and Pd (0.275 nm) compared to the Ru(0001) single crystal (0.270 nm) would favor the inclusion of the impurity metals in the tensile stressed outermost Ru layer, providing additional driving force for surface segregation. The floating behavior was studied by following the variation in the surface morphology and structure during a series of four preparation steps: deposition of Pt (Pd) on Ru(0001), surface alloy formation by annealing, deposition of Ru on the surface alloy at 500 K, and re-alloying by annealing. The probability that a small amount of Pt (Pd) on Ru(0001) is dissolved in the subsurface region (buried by a layer of substrate material) during surface alloy formation can be estimated by a simple Boltzmann approach. The observation of a distinct bilayer island growth of Ru on the Pt0.70Ru0.30/Ru(0001) surface alloy at 500 K, in contrast to the layer-by-layer Ru growth on Pd0.44Ru0.56/Ru(0001) under similar growth conditions, may be attributed to the lower Pd content, the different 2D distribution of the components in the latter surface alloy with more Ru3 surface sites as compared to Pt0.70Ru0.30/Ru(0001), or to a less pronounced difference between RuRu bonding and RuPd bonding.

The study uses density functional theory to investigate oxygen adsorption and its impact on surface segregation in Pt(shell)/M(core) and Pt3M (M = Co, Ir) alloys on (211) surfaces. Oxygen adsorbs most favorably at the bridge site over and parallel to the (100) step. Surface segregation is observed in Pt3Co, Pt3Ir, and Pt/Co(core) systems. The Pt/Ir(core) structure exhibits antisegregation behavior even when oxygen is adsorbed. The arrangement of atoms in the first 23 layers of the catalyst surface significantly affects the catalytic activity of alloys, and surface segregation plays a crucial role in this. Characterizing the surface atomic distribution and understanding the effect of segregation on surface structure are important for catalytic alloys.

Thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions significantly influence the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems such as Pt-3d alloys. The lower surface free energy of Au compared to Pt makes it energetically favorable for Au to remain at the surface when Au is deposited on top of Pt. The immiscibility of Au and Pt at Au compositions greater than 17% also suggests that Au should remain on top of the Pt clusters. The adsorption of CO on the PtAu clusters at room temperature promotes the diffusion of Pt to the surface of the clusters, and this phenomenon is most pronounced for the clusters that are initially pure Au at the surface. Density functional theory calculations demonstrate that it is thermodynamically favorable for Pt to diffuse to the cluster surface in order to bind to CO. For CO oxidation, the first step in the reaction is the dissociation of O2 at Pt sites. Since this process requires more than one contiguous Pt site, it is not surprising that O2 dissociation cannot occur on the PtAu clusters that are 100% Au at the surface before CO exposure, given the low probability for ensembles of Pt sites to form at the surface. In contrast, CO oxidation does not occur at the cluster surfaces that are initially pure Au, presumably because the first step in the oxidation process is O2 dissociation, which requires neighboring Pt sites. These factors have consequent implications for the catalytic properties and performance of bimetallic catalysts in various applications.

The stability of Pt3dPt subsurface structures in various conditions is a critical factor in their catalytic properties and performance. These structures are desirable in heterogeneous catalysis and electrocatalysis. DFT predictions indicate that these structures are stable in vacuum and with adsorbed hydrogen, but with adsorbed oxygen, the 3d atoms should segregate to the surface. These predictions have been experimentally verified on selected Pt3dPt(111) systems and expanded to polycrystalline Pt to understand the effects of multiple crystal facets on the kinetic barriers for the segregation of subsurface 3d atoms. The Pt3dPt subsurface structures are predicted to have higher activation barriers for oxygen-induced segregation compared to the respective Pt3dPt(111) configuration. The PtNiPt system is the most resistant to oxygen-induced segregation, while the PtTiPt configuration is the most susceptible. The stability of these structures in vacuum and with adsorbed hydrogen and oxygen has been demonstrated through DFT calculations and experimental verification on both single crystal Pt(111) and polycrystalline Pt foil. Using combined theoretical and experimental approaches, the relative stability of surface and subsurface bimetallic structures can be quantified and general trends predicted. The difference in the occupied d-band center, Δεd, can be used to screen potential bimetallic alloys with desirable stability in different environments. A BrnstedEvansPolanyi relationship has been derived to correlate thermodynamic stability from DFT calculations with kinetic barriers from experimental measurements for the Pt3dPt systems. Empirical equations have been developed to predict the thermodynamic stability of other bimetallic systems in various conditions. The large difference in binding energies between surface and subsurface structures highlights the need to understand their stability in reacting environments. For Pt3d bimetallic systems, the difference in oxygen binding energy for these configurations is on the order of hundreds of kcal/mol. Based on Sabatier's principle, if a subsurface alloy structure exhibits optimal binding properties for dehydrogenation and ORR, the surface structure would likely bind intermediates too strongly, halting the reaction. Conversely, if the surface alloy structure exhibits optimal binding properties for steam reforming, the subsurface structure would bind adsorbates too weakly, preventing the reaction from proceeding. The stability of bimetallic structures has been considered with various atomic species, which can be extended to more complex adsorbates using scaling relationships. DFT results predict that subsurface PtMPt(111) configurations are preferred in vacuum and with 0.5 ML H, while surface MPtPt(111) configurations are preferred with 0.5 ML O. Experimental measurements have verified the predicted segregation of subsurface 3d atoms in the presence of oxygen and quantified the activation barrier for adsorbate-induced segregation. AES results suggest two regions of segregation, revealing that DFT predictions and experimental measurements on single crystal bimetallic surfaces are applicable to polycrystalline substrates, bridging the materials gap. Predictions show that all Pt3dPt(100) structures have a higher activation barrier for oxygen-induced segregation compared to respective Pt3dPt(111) configurations. Linear trends in all systems show that the correlation of thermodynamic stability with the difference in d-band center can be used beyond Pt3d alloys. Switching the admetal/host component shifts the absolute driving potential of the segregation. This general stability trend predicts that all bimetallic systems have the same thermodynamically preferred configuration in each environment, with subsurface configurations preferred in vacuum and with 0.5 ML H, and surface configurations favored with 0.5 ML O.

The thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions influence the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems such as Pt-3d alloys. The simulation results showed that the Pd atoms would segregate into the outermost layers of the extended surfaces and the Pt concentration would increase monotonically from the extended surfaces into the bulk. The equilibrium PtPd nanoparticles were found to have Pd-enriched shells and Pt-enriched cores. In the shell of the PtPd nanoparticles, the Pd atoms were predicted to preferably segregate to the (100) facets rather than the (111) facets. These phenomena have consequent implications for their catalytic properties and performance in various applications.

The stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems such as Pt-3d alloys, are influenced by thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions. The dissolution of Fe atoms in a PtFe alloy under specific conditions leads to the formation of a Pt skin layer with predominantly (111)-oriented facets. This process is investigated using in situ electrochemical scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) in a 0.1 M HClO4 solution. The potential cycles applied to the PtFe film result in increased dissolution of Fe and the rearrangement of Pt at the surface, forming a protective Pt skin layer. This layer protects the underlying PtFe alloy from corrosion, which has implications for the catalytic properties and performance of the alloy in fuel cell applications. Further studies on the Pt skin layer, such as the adsorption and oxidation of CO, are being conducted to better understand its electrocatalytic behavior.

The literature does not provide specific information on how thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions influence the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems such as Pt-3d alloys, and what are the consequent implications for their catalytic properties and performance in various applications. However, it does mention that the design of high performance cathode electrocatalysts is essential for polymer electrolyte fuel cells, and that the enhancement of electrocatalytic activity of Pt by alloying with Fe results in a maximum activity at ca. 50% Fe content, which is 25 times higher than pure Pt activity. The enhancement could be well explained by the 5d-vacancy of the surface, but not by Pt interatomic distance or roughening of the surfaces.

The stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems such as Pt-3d alloys, are influenced by thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions. Platinum is a popular cathode electrocatalyst in PEM fuel cells, but its slow kinetics for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) limits catalytic efficiency. In recent years, Pt-based alloys, which include Pt and other transition metals, have been extensively studied due to their enhanced ORR activity. Surface segregation plays a key role in this process, leading to the formation of a pure Pt-skin in the outermost layer of the alloys. This surface segregation is closely related to the enhanced stability of Pt-based catalysts. Au shows strong surface segregation in PtAu alloys, whereas Co is usually unable to enrich PtCo alloy surfaces. The process of Au segregating from the second layer to the surface is exothermic, indicating that Au surface segregation is thermodynamically favorable. However, for the PtCo alloy, the surface Co atoms have a stronger tendency to migrate to the second layer, making the continuous segregation of Co unlikely. Therefore, Co segregating to the clean Pt(111) surface is both thermodynamically unfavorable and kinetically prohibitive. Surface segregation has been found to play a key role in the process of Pt-based alloys. For instance, Stamenkovic et al. found that the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is uniquely active on Pt-skin surfaces, and the reaction rate is four times that of the pure Pt catalyst. Numerous studies have been carried out using modern experimental and computational techniques to understand the importance of surface segregation for Pt-based alloys. For many Pt alloy systems, segregation trends have been unambiguously identified, and the components of surface and subsurface regions have successfully been characterized. The dissolution of metal atoms results in some defects on the alloy surface, which are critical to the rearrangement process. The phenomenon can also be observed in acidic solution, often with dissolution of the alloyed metal and rearrangement of Pt atoms. The segregation process includes interlayer migration of the impurity atom, vacancy movement at the second layer, and vacancy regeneration at the surface layer. The segregation model can successfully interpret these phenomena, particularly from a kinetics viewpoint. The pathway from 1 to 4 describes a complete cycle in which an impurity atom in the second layer segregates to the Pt(111) surface. The process is exothermic for the PtAu system, whereas it is endothermic for the PtCo system. Therefore, Co segregating to the clean Pt(111) surface is both thermodynamically unfavorable and kinetically prohibitive according to the model.

The thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions significantly influence the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems such as Pt-3d alloys. The introduction of 3d metals into the Pt(111) system considerably alters the surface adsorption properties, which can be considerably modified by the 3d metals. The electronic structure of the surface Pt atoms only differs very slightly for the segregated and nonsegregated alloys. The discrepant adsorption properties are therefore mainly attributed to the direct involvement of 3d metals either on the surface or in the subsurface. The stability of Pt atoms of Pt-skin surfaces of the three alloys is enhanced with respect to those in pure Pt surfaces. Such stability enhancement is observed both in clean surfaces and under 0.25 ML of adsorbed atomic oxygen, and the degree of stability enhancement follows the opposite order of the oxygen adsorption strengths in the three studied alloys, indicating the protective role of the 3d subsurface atoms determined by their strong binding to the Pt surface layer. The presence of 3d metals in the alloys modifies the electronic and geometric properties, altering the binding strength of adsorbates. This can lead to enhanced catalytic properties and performance in various applications, such as increased oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) rate and improved electrochemical stability against dissolution. The formation of a Pt-skin layer on the surface of Pt-3d alloys, accompanied by a Pt-depleted layer underneath, is a result of surface segregation that can facilitate the removal of adsorbed species, increasing the ORR rate. The stability enhancement of Pt-skin surfaces is associated with a positive potential shift, indicating that the dissolution of Pt atoms is delayed to higher potentials. The presence of adsorbates, such as oxygen, can affect the stability of the catalysts, but Pt-skin surfaces from the alloys still show enhanced stability compared to pure Pt under adsorbate coverage.

The literature does not provide specific information on how thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions influence the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems such as Pt-3d alloys, and the consequent implications for their catalytic properties and performance in various applications. However, it does discuss the effects of annealing temperature on the structural and chemical properties of bimetallic PtRu/Ru(0001) surfaces, which can be related to the broader question. The study shows that annealing leads to changes in the surface morphology from Pt islands on the Ru substrate to a PtRu/Ru(0001) surface alloy, which significantly alters the adsorption properties of the surface. This can be attributed to changes in the composition of the adsorption ensembles and electronic interactions between the metallic constituents upon alloy formation. These changes have implications for the catalytic properties of the surface, as they can affect the activity and selectivity of the catalyst. The literature also discusses the structural and chemical properties of bimetallic PtRu/Ru(0001) model catalysts and their modification upon stepwise annealing of a submonolayer Pt-covered Ru(0001) surface up to the formation of an equilibrated PtxRu1-x/Ru(0001) monolayer surface alloy. The study reveals that the surface structure significantly affects the adsorption properties of the bimetallic surface, which can be explained by changes in the composition of the adsorption ensembles (ensemble effects) for D adsorption and by changes in the electronic interaction (ligand effects, strain effects) of the metallic constituents for CO and D adsorption upon alloy formation. The surface structure and distribution of the components in the topmost layer are accessible by scanning tunneling microscopy (STM), and that the adsorption properties of the bimetallic surface can be explained by changes of the composition of the adsorption ensembles (ensemble effects) for D adsorption and by changes in the electronic interaction (ligand effects, strain effects) of the metallic constituents for CO and D adsorption upon alloy formation. The study reveals that the surface structure significantly affects the adsorption properties of the bimetallic surface, which can be explained by changes in the composition of the adsorption ensembles (ensemble effects) for D adsorption and by changes in the electronic interaction (ligand effects, strain effects) of the metallic constituents for CO and D adsorption upon alloy formation. The study shows that annealing leads to changes in the surface morphology from Pt islands on the Ru substrate to PtRu/Ru(0001) surface alloys, inducing significant changes in the adsorption properties of CO and deuterium. These changes can be attributed to ensemble effects for D adsorption and electronic interaction effects for CO and D adsorption upon alloy formation. The results demonstrate the sensitivity of probe molecule adsorption to the local structure and composition of a bimetallic surface, even for a combination of two chemically active metals such as Ru and Pt.

The stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems such as Pt-3d alloys, are influenced by thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions. Surface segregation, where one metal species enriches the surface or the first sub-surface layers over other components, has significant implications for materials science and surface chemistry. It affects physical and chemical properties such as permeation, surface adsorption, crystal growth, and metal corrosion. Notably, the catalytic activities of alloys can be dramatically altered through surface segregation. Pt, an efficient catalyst used in important chemical reactions like methanol oxidation and hydrocarbon reforming, is the most widely used electrocatalyst for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in fuel cells. Efforts to find alternative catalysts to Pt have focused on Pt-based bimetallic alloys, where some platinum is replaced by less expensive metals. The catalytic properties of these alloys are determined by the surface geometry and electronic structure, which can be modified by the chemical composition, leading to improved catalytic effects when appropriate structures are achieved. Enhanced ORR activities have been observed in Pt alloys with 3d metals, with surface segregation playing a key role. For example, Stamenkovic et al. found that the ORR on Pt-skin structures produced by Pt segregating on the surface of annealed Pt3Co alloys is uniquely active, with a reaction rate four times that of pure Pt. The enhanced activities can be attributed to the surface electronic structure and surface bond length of alloy systems. The surface geometry can considerably alter catalytic efficiency, but for Pt3Co (1 1 1) and Pt3Ni (1 1 1) systems, the maximum deviation of the surface bond length after Pt segregation is only 0.002 Å, indicating that the geometric effect does not contribute to the enhanced ORR activities of Pt-skin surfaces. Instead, the electronic structures modified through surface segregation are the main factor for such enhancement. Theoretical approaches can help to elucidate the driving force and the tendency of this phenomenon. Surface segregation is also governed by temperature and by the presence of adsorbates.

The literature does not provide specific information on how thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions influence the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems such as Pt-3d alloys, and the consequent implications for their catalytic properties and performance in various applications. However, it does discuss the growth of silver on a Pt(1 0 0) surface and the evolution of the structure with increasing temperature, which can be related to the stability and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts. At room temperature, the formation of elongated 2D-adislands with a composition of Ag80Pt20 was observed. Annealing of the sample above 600 K causes more extensive alloying starting at the perimeter of the Ag adislands by AgPt exchange and formation of a nanophasic AgPt alloy confined to the surface layer. With sufficient Ag, this alloy spreads across the surface until a uniform stoichiometry is established over the entire surface. Temperature-dependent AES studies indicate that there is some mixing of Ag with bulk Pt at elevated temperatures. These findings suggest that the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts can be influenced by thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions, which in turn can affect their catalytic properties and performance in various applications.

Ternary alloys have a strong tendency for platinum surface segregation, forming a platinum monolayer on their surfaces. This top platinum monolayer results in relatively weaker binding strengths of oxygen and hydroxyl groups in the ternary alloys, indicating enhanced activity for the oxygen reduction reaction compared to bimetallic alloy surfaces. Additionally, the platinum-skin surfaces of ternary alloys exhibit improved electrochemical stability against the dissolution of platinum atoms from the alloy surface.

The stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems such as Pt-3d alloys, are influenced by thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions. Some near-surface alloys (NSAs) bind atomic hydrogen as weakly as noble metals while dissociating H2 more easily, which is beneficial for hydrogen-related reactions. Hydrogen chemistry on NSAs is crucial for many chemical and pharmaceutical processes. Density functional theory calculations are used to develop new NSAs for these processes. Selected NSAs allow weak hydrogen binding and low H2 dissociation barriers, which is an exception to the general rule. The lowering of the transition-state energy is observed even on non-ideal NSAs, although the effect is less pronounced. NSAs promise high hydrogenation activity at low temperatures, which is beneficial for the production of chiral pharmaceutical compounds and could potentially permit easier separation and storage of hydrogen. The stability of near-surface alloys (NSAs) can be assessed using a two-step procedure: first, considering the composition in vacuum, and then accounting for the effects of hydrogen adsorption. Adsorbates can draw to the surface components of alloys to which they bind strongly. The tendency of hydrogen to induce surface segregation can be estimated by comparing the segregation energy (Eseg) of the solute to the difference in the magnitudes of the hydrogen binding energies between the pure solute and the pure host. Real NSAs may differ from idealized models, but these deviations do not substantially affect the main trends in adsorbate behavior. Some experimental studies have shown significantly modified catalytic activity on non-ideal NSAs, in line with theoretical predictions.

The thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions can influence the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems such as Pt-3d alloys. The addition of a third transition metal element M can modify the driving energy for Pt segregation to the outermost layer of Pt3Ni (111) surface. Transition metals V, Fe, Co, Mo, Tc, Ru, W, Re, Os, and Ir were predicted to lead to even more negative Pt surface segregation energies than that in the based Pt3Ni (111) surface, further promoting Pt surface segregation. In contrast, doping transition metals Ag, Au, and Pd would lead to positive segregation energies and hence suppress the Pt surface segregation in the corresponding Pt3Ni/M (111) surface. The surface energy effect, strain effect, and heat of solution effect induced by the doped element M would collectively affect the Pt surface segregation energy in the Pt3Ni/M (111) surfaces. The extent of Pt surface segregation is determined by the relative Pt surface segregation energy, lattice mismatch, and heat of solution of the Pt3M crystal with respect to those of the Pt3Ni crystal. Replacing Ni with transition metals V, Fe, Co, Mo, Tc, Ru, W, Re, Os, and Ir would lead to even stronger Pt segregation extent to the surface while replacing Ni with transition metals Ag, Au, and Pd could completely prohibit Pt segregating to the surface.

The stability of Pt-based alloys, such as Pt-3d alloys, is influenced by the oxygen coverage under electrochemical conditions. Alloys are generally less stable than pure Pt at the same oxygen coverage. Maintaining zero oxygen coverage at working potentials is crucial for achieving both high activity and stability. The stability of clean alloy surfaces can be inferred from the calculated Pt d-band structure, which shows that alloying generally leads to the stabilization of the Pt d-band, making surface Pt atoms more difficult to segregate or dissolve. However, in the presence of adsorbed O atoms, the removal of Pt is facilitated because the surface vacancy can be more strongly stabilized by O atoms. This is due to the fact that Pt atoms at the surface vacancy are less coordinated and possess more active d-states, which can more strongly bond with O atoms compared to terrace Pt atoms. Additionally, with the exposure of the second layer atoms at the surface vacancy, it is possible to form a much stronger OM bond compared to the OPt bond. This is observed in the search for the optimum structure after a Pt removal, which shows that the surface vacancy is preferentially terminated by O atoms that sink to bond with the solute M atoms at the second layer. For example, in Pt2Ti skin alloys, the surface vacancies with a configuration containing OTi bonding are much more stable than those with only OPt bonding. This is consistent with the fact that atomic O on metals is anion-like, with a strong tendency to accept electrons, and prefers to form ionic-bonds. The stability of Pt alloys under electrochemical conditions is generally lower than that of pure Pt when the oxygen coverage is the same, and maintaining zero oxygen coverage at working potentials (such as 0.9 V) is crucial for achieving both high activity and stability. Among more than 20 different Pt2M alloys, molybdenum (Mo) is identified as a good element that can alloy with Pt to form a stable surface at high electrochemical potentials. Pt2Mo has a lower kinetic barrier for oxygen reduction (OR) compared to Pt, and the barrier to OOH dissociation is a key kinetic parameter for OR activity. The higher stability of clean alloy surfaces can indeed be inferred from the calculated Pt d-band structure, which shows that alloying generally leads to the stabilization of the Pt d-band, making surface Pt atoms more difficult to segregate or dissolve. The stability of surfaces follows the order Pt2Mo > Pt > Pt2Ag > Pt2Pd > Pt2Nb > Pt2Ti > Pt2Sc > Pt2Zr, and only Pt2Mo exhibits higher stability than pure Pt at high potential (1.05 V). The oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) on a Pt2Mo alloy surface follows a similar reaction profile as on Pt, with the transition state (TS) for OOH dissociation determining the height of the potential profile. The TSs for OOH dissociation and O2 dissociation dictate the highest free energy positions in the reaction pathways. The aqueous environment, together with the in situ oxygen coverage, plays an important role in facilitating the ORR on alloy surfaces. The stability of PtxMo alloys drops quickly with increasing potential, in line with the rapid increase of surface oxygen coverage for PtxMo surfaces above 0.9 V. The Pt2Mo skin alloy achieves the best balance of stability and activity. A low Mo content (below 30%, e.g., Pt5Mo) may achieve a higher stability at high potentials, but the activity is not better than Pt at 0.9 V, while a high Mo content (above 30%, e.g., PtMo) will start to destabilize the alloy and also reduce the activity.

The stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems such as CuPt near-surface alloys, are influenced by thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions. CO adsorption at elevated pressures and temperatures can pull the less reactive Cu to the surface, driven by the formation of a stable self-organized CO/CuPt surface alloy structure. This is rationalized by the significantly stronger PtCO bond when Cu is present in the first surface layer of Pt. The results suggest new possibilities for selective and dynamical engineering of alloy surfaces for catalysis, with implications for catalytic properties and performance in various applications, including water-gas shift reactions. DFT calculations confirm the observed Cu surface segregation and the weakening of the PtCO bond with increasing Cu content in the second layer. The onset of bulk migration of Cu is explained by the results with adsorbed CO, and the interdiffusion of Cu and Pt becomes significant at 460 K, where the formation and breakup of the stable CO-induced surface alloy start to occur. The results add to the promise of using molecular adsorbate-induced surface changes as a tool for selective and dynamical engineering of alloy surfaces, likely extending to a wide variety of coinage (Cu, Ag)/Pt-group bimetallic surface alloys.
The stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems such as Pt-3d alloys, are influenced by thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions. Contrary to expectations, CO adsorption at elevated pressures and temperatures can pull the less reactive Cu to the surface of a CuPt near-surface alloy, forming a stable self-organized CO/CuPt surface alloy structure. This is due to the significantly stronger PtCO bond when Cu is present in the first surface layer of Pt. The findings suggest new possibilities for selective and dynamical engineering of alloy surfaces for catalysis, potentially applicable to a range of coinage (Cu, Ag)/Pt-group bimetallic surface alloys.

This is due to the drastically stronger PtCO bond when Cu is present in the first surface layer of Pt. The results are expected to apply to a range of coinage (Cu, Ag)/Pt-group bimetallic surface alloys. The bonding of adsorbates can induce changes in local atomic composition and surface structure, changing the activity and selectivity of the catalyst. The CuPt near-surface alloy (NSA) was suggested as a promising water-gas shift catalyst because of reduced PtCO bonding on a Pt catalyst surface with Cu present in the second layer. However, the NSA is unstable at elevated CO pressures and sample temperatures, forming instead a self-organized CO/CuPt surface alloy (SA) structure. The results are confirmed by extended density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Although Cu diffusion to the first layer is endothermic, the drastic increase in CO binding energy more than compensates for the endothermicity. The vastly increased PtCO bond strength when 2/3 ML of Cu is present in the first layer rationalizes the observed Cu surface segregation. The calculated higher stability of the CuPt SA compared with Cu in the bulk with CO adsorption on clean Pt(111) is nearly equal to the free-energy difference (ΔG). The interdiffusion of Cu and Pt becomes significant at 460 K, and the formation and breakup of the stable CO-induced surface alloy start to occur at this temperature. The DFT calculations reproduce the experimental observations and confirm the rationalization of the observed Cu surface segregation. The results for the CuPt system at elevated temperatures and CO pressures, where a novel stable CO-induced surface alloy forms, likely extend to a wide variety of coinage (Cu, Ag)/Pt-group bimetallic surface alloys.
The stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems such as Pt-3d alloys, are influenced by thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions.

The thermodynamics and kinetics of oxygen-induced segregation of 3d metals in Pt-based systems, such as Pt-3d alloys, are influenced by factors including the crystal plane, which affects the stability of subsurface 3d metals. This has implications for the catalytic properties and performance of bimetallic catalysts in various applications, particularly in oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activity. The stability of subsurface 3d metals in Pt(111) and Pt(100) under oxygen exposure is predicted through Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations. The crystal plane has an effect on the subsurface stability of the bimetallic catalysts. These factors influence the surface segregation and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, which in turn affect their catalytic properties and performance in various applications.

The thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions significantly influence the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems such as Pt-3d alloys. Bimetallic catalysts exhibit greater surface structural complexity compared to monometallic catalysts, with the second metal, in either its metallic or oxidized state, being present on the surface, in the near-surface region, or embedded in the bulk region. The surface structure of bimetallic catalysts is crucial to their catalytic properties. For instance, Pt-based bimetallic catalysts with Pt-skin surfaces and 3d transition metals in the subsurface region demonstrate superior catalytic performance in many reactions compared to pure Pt surfaces. The structure of the catalyst surface often changes dynamically during reactions, similar to reversible surface processes observed in monometallic catalyst systems when the gaseous environment shifts between reductive and oxidative conditions. Bimetallic catalysts may exhibit a similar dependence of surface structure on the redox potential of reaction gases, providing an opportunity to adjust catalytic activity and selectivity.

The stability of bimetallic surface structures under reaction conditions is a critical factor in bimetallic catalysis, as it can modify catalytic properties. For example, under annealing conditions, the subsurface PtNiPt(111) structure is more thermodynamically stable than the surface NiPtPt(111) structure in vacuum. Pt3d alloys in fuel cell applications often have a Pt skin, indicating a thermodynamic preference for Pt-terminated bimetallic surfaces. The segregation energy (Eseg) determines whether the admetal segregates to the surface or remains in the subsurface, affecting the surface composition. Hydrogen-induced segregation is influenced by Eseg and the difference in hydrogen-binding energies on the surface and subsurface. Oxygen can destabilize the subsurface structure, driving subsurface 3d metals to segregate to the surface. Adsorbates with weak Pauling electronegativity have a small effect on the thermodynamic potential for interchanging surface and subsurface configurations, while those with strong Pauling electronegativity can significantly alter binding energy, leading to surface segregation when their coverage is high enough. Oxygen-induced surface segregation is also predicted for specific Pt-based alloy surfaces.

The thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions significantly influence the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems such as Pt-3d alloys. Under reductive conditions, such as vacuum and carbon monoxide, 3d transition metals prefer to occupy the subsurface layer due to their higher surface energy and smaller atomic size. However, under oxidizing conditions, the strong interaction between oxygen and 3d transition metals induces their segregation to the surface, leading to the formation of oxidized 3d transition metal islands. These structural changes have profound implications for the catalytic properties and performance of these materials in various applications. For instance, Pt(111) surfaces with atomic dispersed 3d transition metals in the surface layers exhibit high activity for CO oxidation through a bi-functional mechanism. The interplay between the structure, reaction environment, and catalytic activity is a critical factor in determining the performance of alloy catalysts.

The surface structures of PtNi, PtCo, and PtCu bimetallic catalysts exhibit reversible changes in response to the redox potential of the environmental gas. These changes can be controlled by treating the catalysts in various gases. Surface segregation is a common phenomenon in bimetallic surfaces, where a metal with a larger atomic radius tends to segregate to the surface to release strain. Platinum, with its larger atomic radius compared to cobalt, nickel, and copper, is more likely to segregate to the surface. The presence of hydrogen does not alter the thermodynamic driving force for surface segregation. Oxygen adsorption on Pt-M catalyst surfaces can induce the segregation of 3d transition metals to the top surface due to the strong bonding between oxygen and 3d transition metals. In oxidative environments, 3d transition metals can become oxidized, and the formed oxides tend to encapsulate platinum surfaces. The mass transport processes that occur during oxidation or reduction reactions are fully reversible, depending on the redox potential of the reaction gases. The reversible structural changes in Pt-based bimetallic catalysts have significant implications for real catalytic processes.

The stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems such as Pt-3d alloys, are influenced by thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions. Fe-Pt catalysts have been used in the preferential oxidation (PROX) of CO in excess H2, achieving high selectivity for CO oxidation. Pt-skin structures show high activity for catalyzing the hydrogenation of unsaturated hydrocarbons. The unique catalytic properties of the Pt-skin surfaces are attributed to the modification of the electronic structure of the surface Pt by the subsurface Fe underneath, influencing the adsorption and reaction characteristics of the surface species. The controlled preparation of various Fe-Pt surface structures allows for the derivation of the relationship between structure and catalytic properties, aiding in the design of high-performance and low-cost catalysts. The stability of the Pt-skin structure can be reduced under certain circumstances, such as an oxidative environment, leading to gas-induced Fe surface segregation. The structural configuration of the catalyst can be transformed between surface Fe or FeO and subsurface Fe on the Pt(111) surface by cycles of oxidation and reduction. These transformations have implications for the catalytic properties and performance of the catalysts in various applications, including oxygen reduction reactions, hydrogenation of unsaturated hydrocarbons, and the preferential oxidation of CO in excess H2. Depending on the preparation procedures and reaction conditions, Fe overlayers with either metallic or oxidized states may be present as the topmost surface or in the subsurface region of Pt. Different reactions can produce different Fe-Pt surface structural configurations. For oxygen reduction reactions (ORR), Pt-skin structures with Fe or some other transition metals in the subsurface regions showed a higher activity than pure Pt. For instance, Fe49Pt51 alloys with 100% Pt as the topmost layer had 25 times the activity of pure Pt catalysts in ORR. The optimization of the performance of Fe-Pt structures in magnetism and catalysis places a high demand on the design and control of the surface structural configurations and needs information on the stability of the various structures at elevated temperatures and under different reaction atmospheres.

Surface segregation in bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems such as Pt-3d alloys, is influenced by thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions. This phenomenon is crucial in materials science, catalysis, and surface chemistry, affecting properties like permeation, surface adsorption, crystal growth, and metal corrosion. Surface segregation can significantly alter the catalytic activities of alloys, as evidenced by enhanced oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activities in Pt alloys with 3d metals compared to pure Pt. The unusual catalytic activity, closely related to surface segregation, has sparked extensive research. Most studies have focused on understanding surface and subsurface structures and electronic properties under vacuum conditions. However, catalytic reactions like the ORR occur under environments with various adsorbates, which can influence surface segregation trends and change the surface composition of alloys. Therefore, studying the segregation trend of Pt-based alloys under surface adsorption is critical for understanding their catalytic properties and performance in various applications.

The stability and surface segregation tendencies of PdRu/Ru(0001) and PtRu/Ru(0001) surface alloys were studied using scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and Auger electron spectroscopy (AES). The results showed that after Ru deposition and subsequent re-alloying, the original surface alloy composition was almost completely restored, indicating that the buried Pd and Pt almost completely segregated to the surface layer. There was a slight loss of Pt during the re-alloying step. The slight differences in the stability of the surface alloy may be due to the lower Pd content (44%) in the surface alloy compared to Pt (70%). The preference for surface segregation of a metal atom dissolved in a host metal is related to the difference in surface energies of the two species and the difference in the optimal nearest-neighbor distances of host and guest metal. The surface energies decrease in the order Ru(0001) (1.31.6 eVatom1), Pt(111) (1 eVatom1) and Pd(111) (0.8 eVatom1), which is in good agreement with the observed tendency for segregation of Pt and Pd. The size mismatch of the larger guest metals Pt (0.277 nm) and Pd (0.275 nm) compared to the Ru(0001) single crystal (0.270 nm) would favor the inclusion of the impurity metals in the tensile stressed outermost Ru layer, providing additional driving force for surface segregation. The floating behavior was studied by following the variation in the surface morphology and structure during a series of four preparation steps: deposition of Pt (Pd) on Ru(0001), surface alloy formation by annealing, deposition of Ru on the surface alloy at 500 K, and re-alloying by annealing. The probability that a small amount of Pt (Pd) on Ru(0001) is dissolved in the subsurface region (buried by a layer of substrate material) during surface alloy formation can be estimated by a simple Boltzmann approach. The observation of a distinct bilayer island growth of Ru on the Pt0.70Ru0.30/Ru(0001) surface alloy at 500 K, in contrast to the layer-by-layer Ru growth on Pd0.44Ru0.56/Ru(0001) under similar growth conditions, may be attributed to the lower Pd content, the different 2D distribution of the components in the latter surface alloy with more Ru3 surface sites as compared to Pt0.70Ru0.30/Ru(0001), or to a less pronounced difference between RuRu bonding and RuPd bonding.

The study uses density functional theory to investigate oxygen adsorption and its impact on surface segregation in Pt(shell)/M(core) and Pt3M (M = Co, Ir) alloys on (211) surfaces. Oxygen adsorbs most favorably at the bridge site over and parallel to the (100) step. Surface segregation is observed in Pt3Co, Pt3Ir, and Pt/Co(core) systems. The Pt/Ir(core) structure exhibits antisegregation behavior even when oxygen is adsorbed. The arrangement of atoms in the first 23 layers of the catalyst surface significantly affects the catalytic activity of alloys, and surface segregation plays a crucial role in this. Characterizing the surface atomic distribution and understanding the effect of segregation on surface structure are important for catalytic alloys.

Thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions significantly influence the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems such as Pt-3d alloys. The lower surface free energy of Au compared to Pt makes it energetically favorable for Au to remain at the surface when Au is deposited on top of Pt. The immiscibility of Au and Pt at Au compositions greater than 17% also suggests that Au should remain on top of the Pt clusters. The adsorption of CO on the PtAu clusters at room temperature promotes the diffusion of Pt to the surface of the clusters, and this phenomenon is most pronounced for the clusters that are initially pure Au at the surface. Density functional theory calculations demonstrate that it is thermodynamically favorable for Pt to diffuse to the cluster surface in order to bind to CO. For CO oxidation, the first step in the reaction is the dissociation of O2 at Pt sites. Since this process requires more than one contiguous Pt site, it is not surprising that O2 dissociation cannot occur on the PtAu clusters that are 100% Au at the surface before CO exposure, given the low probability for ensembles of Pt sites to form at the surface. In contrast, CO oxidation does not occur at the cluster surfaces that are initially pure Au, presumably because the first step in the oxidation process is O2 dissociation, which requires neighboring Pt sites. These factors have consequent implications for the catalytic properties and performance of bimetallic catalysts in various applications.
