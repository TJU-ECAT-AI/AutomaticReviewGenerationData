It affects physical and chemical properties such as permeation, surface adsorption, crystal growth, and metal corrosion.

Enhanced ORR activities have been observed in Pt alloys with 3d metals, with surface segregation playing a key role. For example, Stamenkovic et al. found that the ORR on Pt-skin structures produced by Pt segregating on the surface of annealed Pt3Co alloys is uniquely active, with a reaction rate four times that of pure Pt. The enhanced activities can be attributed to the surface electronic structure and surface bond length of alloy systems. The surface geometry can considerably alter catalytic efficiency, but for Pt3Co (1 1 1) and Pt3Ni (1 1 1) systems, the maximum deviation of the surface bond length after Pt segregation is only 0.002 Å, indicating that the geometric effect does not contribute to the enhanced ORR activities of Pt-skin surfaces.

Alloys are generally less stable than pure Pt at the same oxygen coverage. Maintaining zero oxygen coverage at working potentials is crucial for achieving both high activity and stability. The stability of clean alloy surfaces can be inferred from the calculated Pt d-band structure, which shows that alloying generally leads to the stabilization of the Pt d-band, making surface Pt atoms more difficult to segregate or dissolve. However, in the presence of adsorbed O atoms, the removal of Pt is facilitated because the surface vacancy can be more strongly stabilized by O atoms. This is due to the fact that Pt atoms at the surface vacancy are less coordinated and possess more active d-states, which can more strongly bond with O atoms compared to terrace Pt atoms. Additionally, with the exposure of the second layer atoms at the surface vacancy, it is possible to form a much stronger OM bond compared to the OPt bond. This is observed in the search for the optimum structure after a Pt removal, which shows that the surface vacancy is preferentially terminated by O atoms that sink to bond with the solute M atoms at the second layer. For example, in Pt2Ti skin alloys, the surface vacancies with a configuration containing OTi bonding are much more stable than those with only OPt bonding. This is consistent with the fact that atomic O on metals is anion-like, with a strong tendency to accept electrons, and prefers to form ionic-bonds. The stability of Pt alloys under electrochemical conditions is generally lower than that of pure Pt when the oxygen coverage is the same, and maintaining zero oxygen coverage at working potentials (such as 0.9 V) is crucial for achieving both high activity and stability. Among more than 20 different Pt2M alloys, molybdenum (Mo) is identified as a good element that can alloy with Pt to form a stable surface at high electrochemical potentials. Pt2Mo has a lower kinetic barrier for oxygen reduction (OR) compared to Pt, and the barrier to OOH dissociation is a key kinetic parameter for OR activity. The higher stability of clean alloy surfaces can indeed be inferred from the calculated Pt d-band structure, which shows that alloying generally leads to the stabilization of the Pt d-band, making surface Pt atoms more difficult to segregate or dissolve. The stability of surfaces follows the order Pt2Mo > Pt > Pt2Ag > Pt2Pd > Pt2Nb > Pt2Ti > Pt2Sc > Pt2Zr, and only Pt2Mo exhibits higher stability than pure Pt at high potential (1.05 V). The oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) on a Pt2Mo alloy surface follows a similar reaction profile as on Pt, with the transition state (TS) for OOH dissociation determining the height of the potential profile. The TSs for OOH dissociation and O2 dissociation dictate the highest free energy positions in the reaction pathways. The aqueous environment, together with the in situ oxygen coverage, plays an important role in facilitating the ORR on alloy surfaces. The stability of PtxMo alloys drops quickly with increasing potential, in line with the rapid increase of surface oxygen coverage for PtxMo surfaces above 0.9 V. The Pt2Mo skin alloy achieves the best balance of stability and activity. A low Mo content (below 30%, e.g., Pt5Mo) may achieve a higher stability at high potentials, but the activity is not better than Pt at 0.9 V, while a high Mo content (above 30%, e.g., PtMo) will start to destabilize the alloy and also reduce the activity.", "Chinese": "Pt基合金（如Pt-3d合金）的稳定性受电化学条件下氧覆盖度的影响。在相同的氧覆盖度下，合金通常比纯Pt的稳定性差。在工作电位下保持零氧覆盖度对于实现高活性和稳定性至关重要。从计算得到的Pt d带结构可以推断出清洁合金表面的稳定性，该结构显示合金化通常导致Pt d带的稳定，使表面Pt原子更难分层或溶解。然而，在吸附O原子的存在下，Pt的去除被促进，因为表面空位可以被O原子更强烈地稳定。这是由于表面空位处的Pt原子的配位较少，具有更活跃的d态，与O原子的结合力比台地Pt原子更强。此外，随着表面空位处第二层原子的暴露，与OPt键相比，可以形成更强的OM键。这在Pt去除后寻找最优结构的观察中得到证实，显示表面空位优先被下沉到第二层与溶质M原子结合的O原子终止。例如，在Pt2Ti皮肤合金中，含有OTi键的表面空位比仅含OPt键的空位更稳定。这与金属上的原子O是阴离子状的，有强烈的接受电子倾向，并倾向于形成离子键的事实一致。铂基合金（如Pt-3d合金）的稳定性受电化学条件下氧覆盖度的影响。合金在相同氧覆盖度下通常比纯Pt稳定性差。在工作电位下保持零氧覆盖度是实现高活性和稳定性的关键。清洁合金表面的稳定性可以从计算得到的Pt d带结构中推断出来，该结构显示合金化通常会导致Pt d带的稳定化，使表面Pt原子更难分层或溶解。在超过20种不同的Pt2M合金中，鉴定出钼（Mo）是一种好的元素，可以与铂合金化，在高电化学电位下形成稳定的表面。Pt2Mo相对于Pt具有较低的氧还原（OR）动力学障碍，而OOH解离的障碍是OR活性的关键动力学参数。从计算得到的Pt d带结构可以推断出清洁合金表面的较高稳定性，该结构显示合金化通常导致Pt d带的稳定，从而使表面铂原子更难分离或溶解。表面稳定性遵循Pt2Mo > Pt > Pt2Ag > Pt2Pd > Pt2Nb > Pt2Ti > Pt2Sc > Pt2Zr的顺序，只有Pt2Mo在高电位（1.05 V）下表现出比纯铂更高的稳定性。Pt2Mo合金表面的氧还原反应（ORR）遵循与Pt相似的反应轮廓，其中OOH解离的过渡态（TS）决定了电位轮廓的高度。OOH解离和O2解离的TS决定了反应路径中最高的自由能位置。水环境与原位氧覆盖一起在合金表面促进ORR中起着重要作用。PtxMo合金的稳定性随着电位的增加而迅速下降，这与PtxMo表面在0.9 V以上表面氧覆盖的迅速增加一致。Pt2Mo皮肤合金实现了稳定性和活性的最佳平衡。低Mo含量（低于30%，例如Pt5Mo）在高电位下可能实现更高的稳定性，但0.9 V时的活性并不优于Pt，而高Mo含量（高于30%，例如PtMo）将开始使合金不稳定，同时降低活性。", "Doi": "10.1039/c0ee00762e"},

Platinum is a popular cathode electrocatalyst in PEM fuel cells, but its slow kinetics for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) limits catalytic efficiency. In recent years, Pt-based alloys, which include Pt and other transition metals, have been extensively studied due to their enhanced ORR activity. Surface segregation plays a key role in this process, leading to the formation of a pure Pt-skin in the outermost layer of the alloys. This surface segregation is closely related to the enhanced stability of Pt-based catalysts. Au shows strong surface segregation in PtAu alloys, whereas Co is usually unable to enrich PtCo alloy surfaces. The process of Au segregating from the second layer to the surface is exothermic, indicating that Au surface segregation is thermodynamically favorable. However, for the PtCo alloy, the surface Co atoms have a stronger tendency to migrate to the second layer, making the continuous segregation of Co unlikely. Therefore, Co segregating to the clean Pt(111) surface is both thermodynamically unfavorable and kinetically prohibitive. Surface segregation has been found to play a key role in the process of Pt-based alloys. For instance, Stamenkovic et al. found that the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is uniquely active on Pt-skin surfaces, and the reaction rate is four times that of the pure Pt catalyst. Numerous studies have been carried out using modern experimental and computational techniques to understand the importance of surface segregation for Pt-based alloys. For many Pt alloy systems, segregation trends have been unambiguously identified, and the components of surface and subsurface regions have successfully been characterized. The dissolution of metal atoms results in some defects on the alloy surface, which are critical to the rearrangement process. The phenomenon can also be observed in acidic solution, often with dissolution of the alloyed metal and rearrangement of Pt atoms. The segregation process includes interlayer migration of the impurity atom, vacancy movement at the second layer, and vacancy regeneration at the surface layer. The segregation model can successfully interpret these phenomena, particularly from a kinetics viewpoint.

The introduction of 3d metals into the Pt(111) system considerably alters the surface adsorption properties, which can be considerably modified by the 3d metals. The electronic structure of the surface Pt atoms only differs very slightly for the segregated and nonsegregated alloys. The discrepant adsorption properties are therefore mainly attributed to the direct involvement of 3d metals either on the surface or in the subsurface. The stability of Pt atoms of Pt-skin surfaces of the three alloys is enhanced with respect to those in pure Pt surfaces. Such stability enhancement is observed both in clean surfaces and under 0.25 ML of adsorbed atomic oxygen, and the degree of stability enhancement follows the opposite order of the oxygen adsorption strengths in the three studied alloys, indicating the protective role of the 3d subsurface atoms determined by their strong binding to the Pt surface layer. The presence of 3d metals in the alloys modifies the electronic and geometric properties, altering the binding strength of adsorbates. This can lead to enhanced catalytic properties and performance in various applications, such as increased oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) rate and improved electrochemical stability against dissolution. The formation of a Pt-skin layer on the surface of Pt-3d alloys, accompanied by a Pt-depleted layer underneath, is a result of surface segregation that can facilitate the removal of adsorbed species, increasing the ORR rate. The stability enhancement of Pt-skin surfaces is associated with a positive potential shift, indicating that the dissolution of Pt atoms is delayed to higher potentials. The presence of adsorbates, such as oxygen, can affect the stability of the catalysts, but Pt-skin surfaces from the alloys still show enhanced stability compared to pure Pt under adsorbate coverage.", "Chinese": "热力学偏好和反应条件对双金属催化剂的稳定性、表面分层和结构配置有重大影响,特别是在Pt基系统如Pt-3d合金中。将3d金属引入Pt(111)系统会极大地改变表面吸附性质,这些性质可以通过3d金属进行显著修改。表面Pt原子的电子结构在分层和非分层合金之间仅略有不同。因此,不同的吸附性质主要归因于3d金属直接参与表面或次表面。三种合金的Pt皮肤表面的Pt原子的稳定性相对于纯Pt表面的Pt原子有所提高。这种稳定性增强在清洁表面和0.25 ML吸附原子氧下均被观察到,并且稳定性的增强程度遵循三种研究合金中氧吸附强度的相反顺序,表明3d次表面原子的保护作用,这是由它们与Pt表面层的强结合决定的。合金中3d金属的存在改变了电子和几何性质,改变了吸附物的结合强度。这可以导致各种应用中催化性能和性能的增强,例如氧还原反应(ORR)速率的增加和对溶解的电化学稳定性的提高。Pt-3d合金表面形成Pt皮肤层,伴随着下面的Pt耗尽层,是表面分层的结果,可以促进吸附物种的去除,增加ORR速率。Pt皮肤表面的稳定性增强与正电位偏移有关,表明Pt原子的溶解被延迟到更高的电位。吸附物的存在,如氧气,可能会影响催化剂的稳定性,但与纯Pt相比,在吸附物覆盖下,合金的Pt皮肤表面仍然显示出增强的稳定性。", "Doi": "10.1021/jp8046888"},

segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems such as Pt-3d alloys, are influenced by thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions. Some near-surface alloys (NSAs) bind atomic hydrogen as weakly as noble metals while dissociating H2 more easily, which is beneficial for hydrogen-related reactions. Hydrogen chemistry on NSAs is crucial for many chemical and pharmaceutical processes. Density functional theory calculations are used to develop new NSAs for these processes. Selected NSAs allow weak hydrogen binding and low H2 dissociation barriers, which is an exception to the general rule. The lowering of the transition-state energy is observed even on non-ideal NSAs, although the effect is less pronounced. NSAs promise high hydrogenation activity at low temperatures, which is beneficial for the production of chiral pharmaceutical compounds and could potentially permit easier separation and storage of hydrogen. The stability of near-surface alloys (NSAs) can be assessed using a two-step procedure: first, considering the composition in vacuum, and then accounting for the effects of hydrogen adsorption. Adsorbates can draw to the surface components of alloys to which they bind strongly. The tendency of hydrogen to induce surface segregation can be estimated by comparing the segregation energy (Eseg) of the solute to the difference in the magnitudes of the hydrogen binding energies between the pure solute and the pure host.

Alloys are generally less stable than pure Pt at the same oxygen coverage. Maintaining zero oxygen coverage at working potentials is crucial for achieving both high activity and stability. The stability of clean alloy surfaces can be inferred from the calculated Pt d-band structure, which shows that alloying generally leads to the stabilization of the Pt d-band, making surface Pt atoms more difficult to segregate or dissolve. However, in the presence of adsorbed O atoms, the removal of Pt is facilitated because the surface vacancy can be more strongly stabilized by O atoms. This is due to the fact that Pt atoms at the surface vacancy are less coordinated and possess more active d-states, which can more strongly bond with O atoms compared to terrace Pt atoms. Additionally, with the exposure of the second layer atoms at the surface vacancy, it is possible to form a much stronger OM bond compared to the OPt bond. This is observed in the search for the optimum structure after a Pt removal, which shows that the surface vacancy is preferentially terminated by O atoms that sink to bond with the solute M atoms at the second layer. For example, in Pt2Ti skin alloys, the surface vacancies with a configuration containing OTi bonding are much more stable than those with only OPt bonding. This is consistent with the fact that atomic O on metals is anion-like, with a strong tendency to accept electrons, and prefers to form ionic-bonds. The stability of Pt alloys under electrochemical conditions is generally lower than that of pure Pt when the oxygen coverage is the same, and maintaining zero oxygen coverage at working potentials (such as 0.9 V) is crucial for achieving both high activity and stability. Among more than 20 different Pt2M alloys, molybdenum (Mo) is identified as a good element that can alloy with Pt to form a stable surface at high electrochemical potentials. Pt2Mo has a lower kinetic barrier for oxygen reduction (OR) compared to Pt, and the barrier to OOH dissociation is a key kinetic parameter for OR activity. The higher stability of clean alloy surfaces can indeed be inferred from the calculated Pt d-band structure, which shows that alloying generally leads to the stabilization of the Pt d-band, making surface Pt atoms more difficult to segregate or dissolve. The stability of surfaces follows the order Pt2Mo > Pt > Pt2Ag > Pt2Pd > Pt2Nb > Pt2Ti > Pt2Sc > Pt2Zr, and only Pt2Mo exhibits higher stability than pure Pt at high potential (1.05 V). The oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) on a Pt2Mo alloy surface follows a similar reaction profile as on Pt, with the transition state (TS) for OOH dissociation determining the height of the potential profile. The TSs for OOH dissociation and O2 dissociation dictate the highest free energy positions in the reaction pathways. The aqueous environment, together with the in situ oxygen coverage, plays an important role in facilitating the ORR on alloy surfaces. The stability of PtxMo alloys drops quickly with increasing potential, in line with the rapid increase of surface oxygen coverage for PtxMo surfaces above 0.9 V. The Pt2Mo skin alloy achieves the best balance of stability and activity. A low Mo content (below 30%, e.g., Pt5Mo) may achieve a higher stability at high potentials, but the activity is not better than Pt at 0.9 V, while a high Mo content (above 30%, e.g., PtMo) will start to destabilize the alloy and also reduce the activity.", "Chinese": "Pt基合金（如Pt-3d合金）的稳定性受电化学条件下氧覆盖度的影响。在相同的氧覆盖度下，合金通常比纯Pt的稳定性差。在工作电位下保持零氧覆盖度对于实现高活性和稳定性至关重要。从计算得到的Pt d带结构可以推断出清洁合金表面的稳定性，该结构显示合金化通常导致Pt d带的稳定，使表面Pt原子更难分层或溶解。然而，在吸附O原子的存在下，Pt的去除被促进，因为表面空位可以被O原子更强烈地稳定。这是由于表面空位处的Pt原子的配位较少，具有更活跃的d态，与O原子的结合力比台地Pt原子更强。此外，随着表面空位处第二层原子的暴露，与OPt键相比，可以形成更强的OM键。这在Pt去除后寻找最优结构的观察中得到证实，显示表面空位优先被下沉到第二层与溶质M原子结合的O原子终止。例如，在Pt2Ti皮肤合金中，含有OTi键的表面空位比仅含OPt键的空位更稳定。这与金属上的原子O是阴离子状的，有强烈的接受电子倾向，并倾向于形成离子键的事实一致。铂基合金（如Pt-3d合金）的稳定性受电化学条件下氧覆盖度的影响。合金在相同氧覆盖度下通常比纯Pt稳定性差。在工作电位下保持零氧覆盖度是实现高活性和稳定性的关键。清洁合金表面的稳定性可以从计算得到的Pt d带结构中推断出来，该结构显示合金化通常会导致Pt d带的稳定化，使表面Pt原子更难分层或溶解。在超过20种不同的Pt2M合金中，鉴定出钼（Mo）是一种好的元素，可以与铂合金化，在高电化学电位下形成稳定的表面。Pt2Mo相对于Pt具有较低的氧还原（OR）动力学障碍，而OOH解离的障碍是OR活性的关键动力学参数。从计算得到的Pt d带结构可以推断出清洁合金表面的较高稳定性，该结构显示合金化通常导致Pt d带的稳定，从而使表面铂原子更难分离或溶解。表面稳定性遵循Pt2Mo > Pt > Pt2Ag > Pt2Pd > Pt2Nb > Pt2Ti > Pt2Sc > Pt2Zr的顺序，只有Pt2Mo在高电位（1.05 V）下表现出比纯铂更高的稳定性。Pt2Mo合金表面的氧还原反应（ORR）遵循与Pt相似的反应轮廓，其中OOH解离的过渡态（TS）决定了电位轮廓的高度。OOH解离和O2解离的TS决定了反应路径中最高的自由能位置。水环境与原位氧覆盖一起在合金表面促进ORR中起着重要作用。PtxMo合金的稳定性随着电位的增加而迅速下降，这与PtxMo表面在0.9 V以上表面氧覆盖的迅速增加一致。Pt2Mo皮肤合金实现了稳定性和活性的最佳平衡。低Mo含量（低于30%，例如Pt5Mo）在高电位下可能实现更高的稳定性，但0.9 V时的活性并不优于Pt，而高Mo含量（高于30%，例如PtMo）将开始使合金不稳定，同时降低活性。", "Doi": "10.1039/c0ee00762e"},

Platinum is a popular cathode electrocatalyst in PEM fuel cells, but its slow kinetics for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) limits catalytic efficiency. In recent years, Pt-based alloys, which include Pt and other transition metals, have been extensively studied due to their enhanced ORR activity. Surface segregation plays a key role in this process, leading to the formation of a pure Pt-skin in the outermost layer of the alloys. This surface segregation is closely related to the enhanced stability of Pt-based catalysts. Au shows strong surface segregation in PtAu alloys, whereas Co is usually unable to enrich PtCo alloy surfaces. The process of Au segregating from the second layer to the surface is exothermic, indicating that Au surface segregation is thermodynamically favorable.

Therefore, Co segregating to the clean Pt(111) surface is both thermodynamically unfavorable and kinetically prohibitive.

The electronic structure of the surface Pt atoms only differs very slightly for the segregated and nonsegregated alloys.

Alloys are generally less stable than pure Pt at the same oxygen coverage. Maintaining zero oxygen coverage at working potentials is crucial for achieving both high activity and stability. The stability of clean alloy surfaces can be inferred from the calculated Pt d-band structure, which shows that alloying generally leads to the stabilization of the Pt d-band, making surface Pt atoms more difficult to segregate or dissolve. However, in the presence of adsorbed O atoms, the removal of Pt is facilitated because the surface vacancy can be more strongly stabilized by O atoms. This is due to the fact that Pt atoms at the surface vacancy are less coordinated and possess more active d-states, which can more strongly bond with O atoms compared to terrace Pt atoms. Additionally, with the exposure of the second layer atoms at the surface vacancy, it is possible to form a much stronger OM bond compared to the OPt bond. This is observed in the search for the optimum structure after a Pt removal, which shows that the surface vacancy is preferentially terminated by O atoms that sink to bond with the solute M atoms at the second layer. For example, in Pt2Ti skin alloys, the surface vacancies with a configuration containing OTi bonding are much more stable than those with only OPt bonding. This is consistent with the fact that atomic O on metals is anion-like, with a strong tendency to accept electrons, and prefers to form ionic-bonds. The stability of Pt alloys under electrochemical conditions is generally lower than that of pure Pt when the oxygen coverage is the same, and maintaining zero oxygen coverage at working potentials (such as 0.9 V) is crucial for achieving both high activity and stability. Among more than 20 different Pt2M alloys, molybdenum (Mo) is identified as a good element that can alloy with Pt to form a stable surface at high electrochemical potentials. Pt2Mo has a lower kinetic barrier for oxygen reduction (OR) compared to Pt, and the barrier to OOH dissociation is a key kinetic parameter for OR activity. The higher stability of clean alloy surfaces can indeed be inferred from the calculated Pt d-band structure, which shows that alloying generally leads to the stabilization of the Pt d-band, making surface Pt atoms more difficult to segregate or dissolve. The stability of surfaces follows the order Pt2Mo > Pt > Pt2Ag > Pt2Pd > Pt2Nb > Pt2Ti > Pt2Sc > Pt2Zr, and only Pt2Mo exhibits higher stability than pure Pt at high potential (1.05 V). The oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) on a Pt2Mo alloy surface follows a similar reaction profile as on Pt, with the transition state (TS) for OOH dissociation determining the height of the potential profile. The TSs for OOH dissociation and O2 dissociation dictate the highest free energy positions in the reaction pathways. The aqueous environment, together with the in situ oxygen coverage, plays an important role in facilitating the ORR on alloy surfaces. The stability of PtxMo alloys drops quickly with increasing potential, in line with the rapid increase of surface oxygen coverage for PtxMo surfaces above 0.9 V. The Pt2Mo skin alloy achieves the best balance of stability and activity. A low Mo content (below 30%, e.g., Pt5Mo) may achieve a higher stability at high potentials, but the activity is not better than Pt at 0.9 V, while a high Mo content (above 30%, e.g., PtMo) will start to destabilize the alloy and also reduce the activity.", "Chinese": "Pt基合金（如Pt-3d合金）的稳定性受电化学条件下氧覆盖度的影响。在相同的氧覆盖度下，合金通常比纯Pt的稳定性差。在工作电位下保持零氧覆盖度对于实现高活性和稳定性至关重要。从计算得到的Pt d带结构可以推断出清洁合金表面的稳定性，该结构显示合金化通常导致Pt d带的稳定，使表面Pt原子更难分层或溶解。然而，在吸附O原子的存在下，Pt的去除被促进，因为表面空位可以被O原子更强烈地稳定。这是由于表面空位处的Pt原子的配位较少，具有更活跃的d态，与O原子的结合力比台地Pt原子更强。此外，随着表面空位处第二层原子的暴露，与OPt键相比，可以形成更强的OM键。这在Pt去除后寻找最优结构的观察中得到证实，显示表面空位优先被下沉到第二层与溶质M原子结合的O原子终止。例如，在Pt2Ti皮肤合金中，含有OTi键的表面空位比仅含OPt键的空位更稳定。这与金属上的原子O是阴离子状的，有强烈的接受电子倾向，并倾向于形成离子键的事实一致。铂基合金（如Pt-3d合金）的稳定性受电化学条件下氧覆盖度的影响。合金在相同氧覆盖度下通常比纯Pt稳定性差。在工作电位下保持零氧覆盖度是实现高活性和稳定性的关键。清洁合金表面的稳定性可以从计算得到的Pt d带结构中推断出来，该结构显示合金化通常会导致Pt d带的稳定化，使表面Pt原子更难分层或溶解。在超过20种不同的Pt2M合金中，鉴定出钼（Mo）是一种好的元素，可以与铂合金化，在高电化学电位下形成稳定的表面。Pt2Mo相对于Pt具有较低的氧还原（OR）动力学障碍，而OOH解离的障碍是OR活性的关键动力学参数。从计算得到的Pt d带结构可以推断出清洁合金表面的较高稳定性，该结构显示合金化通常导致Pt d带的稳定，从而使表面铂原子更难分离或溶解。表面稳定性遵循Pt2Mo > Pt > Pt2Ag > Pt2Pd > Pt2Nb > Pt2Ti > Pt2Sc > Pt2Zr的顺序，只有Pt2Mo在高电位（1.05 V）下表现出比纯铂更高的稳定性。Pt2Mo合金表面的氧还原反应（ORR）遵循与Pt相似的反应轮廓，其中OOH解离的过渡态（TS）决定了电位轮廓的高度。OOH解离和O2解离的TS决定了反应路径中最高的自由能位置。水环境与原位氧覆盖一起在合金表面促进ORR中起着重要作用。PtxMo合金的稳定性随着电位的增加而迅速下降，这与PtxMo表面在0.9 V以上表面氧覆盖的迅速增加一致。Pt2Mo皮肤合金实现了稳定性和活性的最佳平衡。低Mo含量（低于30%，例如Pt5Mo）在高电位下可能实现更高的稳定性，但0.9 V时的活性并不优于Pt，而高Mo含量（高于30%，例如PtMo）将开始使合金不稳定，同时降低活性。", "Doi": "10.1039/c0ee00762e"},

The onset of bulk migration of Cu is explained by the results with adsorbed CO, and the interdiffusion of Cu and Pt becomes significant at 460 K, where the formation and breakup of the stable CO-induced surface alloy start to occur. The results add to the promise of using molecular adsorbate-induced surface changes as a tool for selective and dynamical engineering of alloy surfaces, likely extending to a wide variety of coinage (Cu, Ag)/Pt-group bimetallic surface alloys.\nThe stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems such as Pt-3d alloys, are influenced by thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions. Contrary to expectations, CO adsorption at elevated pressures and temperatures can pull the less reactive Cu to the surface of a CuPt near-surface alloy, forming a stable self-organized CO/CuPt surface alloy structure. This is due to the significantly stronger PtCO bond when Cu is present in the first surface layer of Pt.

CO adsorption at elevated pressures and temperatures can pull the less reactive Cu to the surface of a CuPt near-surface alloy, driven by the formation of a stable self-organized CO/CuPt surface alloy structure. This is due to the drastically stronger PtCO bond when Cu is present in the first surface layer of Pt. The results are expected to apply to a range of coinage (Cu, Ag)/Pt-group bimetallic surface alloys. The bonding of adsorbates can induce changes in local atomic composition and surface structure, changing the activity and selectivity of the catalyst. The CuPt near-surface alloy (NSA) was suggested as a promising water-gas shift catalyst because of reduced PtCO bonding on a Pt catalyst surface with Cu present in the second layer. However, the NSA is unstable at elevated CO pressures and sample temperatures, forming instead a self-organized CO/CuPt surface alloy (SA) structure. The results are confirmed by extended density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Although Cu diffusion to the first layer is endothermic, the drastic increase in CO binding energy more than compensates for the endothermicity. The vastly increased PtCO bond strength when 2/3 ML of Cu is present in the first layer rationalizes the observed Cu surface segregation. The calculated higher stability of the CuPt SA compared with Cu in the bulk with CO adsorption on clean Pt(111) is nearly equal to the free-energy difference (ΔG). The interdiffusion of Cu and Pt becomes significant at 460 K, and the formation and breakup of the stable CO-induced surface alloy start to occur at this temperature. The DFT calculations reproduce the experimental observations and confirm the rationalization of the observed Cu surface segregation.

In recent years, Pt-based alloys, which include Pt and other transition metals, have been extensively studied due to their enhanced ORR activity.

Efforts to find alternative catalysts to Pt have focused on Pt-based bimetallic alloys, where some platinum is replaced by less expensive metals. The catalytic properties of these alloys are determined by the surface geometry and electronic structure, which can be modified by the chemical composition, leading to improved catalytic effects when appropriate structures are achieved. Enhanced ORR activities have been observed in Pt alloys with 3d metals, with surface segregation playing a key role. For example, Stamenkovic et al. found that the ORR on Pt-skin structures produced by Pt segregating on the surface of annealed Pt3Co alloys is uniquely active, with a reaction rate four times that of pure Pt. The enhanced activities can be attributed to the surface electronic structure and surface bond length of alloy systems. The surface geometry can considerably alter catalytic efficiency, but for Pt3Co (1 1 1) and Pt3Ni (1 1 1) systems, the maximum deviation of the surface bond length after Pt segregation is only 0.002 Å, indicating that the geometric effect does not contribute to the enhanced ORR activities of Pt-skin surfaces.

Alloys are generally less stable than pure Pt at the same oxygen coverage. Maintaining zero oxygen coverage at working potentials is crucial for achieving both high activity and stability. The stability of clean alloy surfaces can be inferred from the calculated Pt d-band structure, which shows that alloying generally leads to the stabilization of the Pt d-band, making surface Pt atoms more difficult to segregate or dissolve. However, in the presence of adsorbed O atoms, the removal of Pt is facilitated because the surface vacancy can be more strongly stabilized by O atoms. This is due to the fact that Pt atoms at the surface vacancy are less coordinated and possess more active d-states, which can more strongly bond with O atoms compared to terrace Pt atoms. Additionally, with the exposure of the second layer atoms at the surface vacancy, it is possible to form a much stronger OM bond compared to the OPt bond. This is observed in the search for the optimum structure after a Pt removal, which shows that the surface vacancy is preferentially terminated by O atoms that sink to bond with the solute M atoms at the second layer. For example, in Pt2Ti skin alloys, the surface vacancies with a configuration containing OTi bonding are much more stable than those with only OPt bonding. This is consistent with the fact that atomic O on metals is anion-like, with a strong tendency to accept electrons, and prefers to form ionic-bonds. The stability of Pt alloys under electrochemical conditions is generally lower than that of pure Pt when the oxygen coverage is the same, and maintaining zero oxygen coverage at working potentials (such as 0.9 V) is crucial for achieving both high activity and stability. Among more than 20 different Pt2M alloys, molybdenum (Mo) is identified as a good element that can alloy with Pt to form a stable surface at high electrochemical potentials. Pt2Mo has a lower kinetic barrier for oxygen reduction (OR) compared to Pt, and the barrier to OOH dissociation is a key kinetic parameter for OR activity. The higher stability of clean alloy surfaces can indeed be inferred from the calculated Pt d-band structure, which shows that alloying generally leads to the stabilization of the Pt d-band, making surface Pt atoms more difficult to segregate or dissolve. The stability of surfaces follows the order Pt2Mo > Pt > Pt2Ag > Pt2Pd > Pt2Nb > Pt2Ti > Pt2Sc > Pt2Zr, and only Pt2Mo exhibits higher stability than pure Pt at high potential (1.05 V). The oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) on a Pt2Mo alloy surface follows a similar reaction profile as on Pt, with the transition state (TS) for OOH dissociation determining the height of the potential profile. The TSs for OOH dissociation and O2 dissociation dictate the highest free energy positions in the reaction pathways. The aqueous environment, together with the in situ oxygen coverage, plays an important role in facilitating the ORR on alloy surfaces.

DFT predictions indicate that these structures are stable in vacuum and with adsorbed hydrogen, but with adsorbed oxygen, the 3d atoms should segregate to the surface. These predictions have been experimentally verified on selected Pt3dPt(111) systems and expanded to polycrystalline Pt to understand the effects of multiple crystal facets on the kinetic barriers for the segregation of subsurface 3d atoms. The Pt3dPt subsurface structures are predicted to have higher activation barriers for oxygen-induced segregation compared to the respective Pt3dPt(111) configuration.

It affects physical and chemical properties such as permeation, surface adsorption, crystal growth, and metal corrosion.

Enhanced ORR activities have been observed in Pt alloys with 3d metals, with surface segregation playing a key role. For example, Stamenkovic et al. found that the ORR on Pt-skin structures produced by Pt segregating on the surface of annealed Pt3Co alloys is uniquely active, with a reaction rate four times that of pure Pt. The enhanced activities can be attributed to the surface electronic structure and surface bond length of alloy systems. The surface geometry can considerably alter catalytic efficiency, but for Pt3Co (1 1 1) and Pt3Ni (1 1 1) systems, the maximum deviation of the surface bond length after Pt segregation is only 0.002 Å, indicating that the geometric effect does not contribute to the enhanced ORR activities of Pt-skin surfaces.

Alloys are generally less stable than pure Pt at the same oxygen coverage. Maintaining zero oxygen coverage at working potentials is crucial for achieving both high activity and stability. The stability of clean alloy surfaces can be inferred from the calculated Pt d-band structure, which shows that alloying generally leads to the stabilization of the Pt d-band, making surface Pt atoms more difficult to segregate or dissolve. However, in the presence of adsorbed O atoms, the removal of Pt is facilitated because the surface vacancy can be more strongly stabilized by O atoms. This is due to the fact that Pt atoms at the surface vacancy are less coordinated and possess more active d-states, which can more strongly bond with O atoms compared to terrace Pt atoms. Additionally, with the exposure of the second layer atoms at the surface vacancy, it is possible to form a much stronger OM bond compared to the OPt bond. This is observed in the search for the optimum structure after a Pt removal, which shows that the surface vacancy is preferentially terminated by O atoms that sink to bond with the solute M atoms at the second layer. For example, in Pt2Ti skin alloys, the surface vacancies with a configuration containing OTi bonding are much more stable than those with only OPt bonding. This is consistent with the fact that atomic O on metals is anion-like, with a strong tendency to accept electrons, and prefers to form ionic-bonds. The stability of Pt alloys under electrochemical conditions is generally lower than that of pure Pt when the oxygen coverage is the same, and maintaining zero oxygen coverage at working potentials (such as 0.9 V) is crucial for achieving both high activity and stability. Among more than 20 different Pt2M alloys, molybdenum (Mo) is identified as a good element that can alloy with Pt to form a stable surface at high electrochemical potentials. Pt2Mo has a lower kinetic barrier for oxygen reduction (OR) compared to Pt, and the barrier to OOH dissociation is a key kinetic parameter for OR activity. The higher stability of clean alloy surfaces can indeed be inferred from the calculated Pt d-band structure, which shows that alloying generally leads to the stabilization of the Pt d-band, making surface Pt atoms more difficult to segregate or dissolve. The stability of surfaces follows the order Pt2Mo > Pt > Pt2Ag > Pt2Pd > Pt2Nb > Pt2Ti > Pt2Sc > Pt2Zr, and only Pt2Mo exhibits higher stability than pure Pt at high potential (1.05 V). The oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) on a Pt2Mo alloy surface follows a similar reaction profile as on Pt, with the transition state (TS) for OOH dissociation determining the height of the potential profile. The TSs for OOH dissociation and O2 dissociation dictate the highest free energy positions in the reaction pathways. The aqueous environment, together with the in situ oxygen coverage, plays an important role in facilitating the ORR on alloy surfaces. The stability of PtxMo alloys drops quickly with increasing potential, in line with the rapid increase of surface oxygen coverage for PtxMo surfaces above 0.9 V. The Pt2Mo skin alloy achieves the best balance of stability and activity. A low Mo content (below 30%, e.g., Pt5Mo) may achieve a higher stability at high potentials, but the activity is not better than Pt at 0.9 V, while a high Mo content (above 30%, e.g., PtMo) will start to destabilize the alloy and also reduce the activity.", "Chinese": "Pt基合金（如Pt-3d合金）的稳定性受电化学条件下氧覆盖度的影响。在相同的氧覆盖度下，合金通常比纯Pt的稳定性差。在工作电位下保持零氧覆盖度对于实现高活性和稳定性至关重要。从计算得到的Pt d带结构可以推断出清洁合金表面的稳定性，该结构显示合金化通常导致Pt d带的稳定，使表面Pt原子更难分层或溶解。然而，在吸附O原子的存在下，Pt的去除被促进，因为表面空位可以被O原子更强烈地稳定。这是由于表面空位处的Pt原子的配位较少，具有更活跃的d态，与O原子的结合力比台地Pt原子更强。此外，随着表面空位处第二层原子的暴露，与OPt键相比，可以形成更强的OM键。这在Pt去除后寻找最优结构的观察中得到证实，显示表面空位优先被下沉到第二层与溶质M原子结合的O原子终止。例如，在Pt2Ti皮肤合金中，含有OTi键的表面空位比仅含OPt键的空位更稳定。这与金属上的原子O是阴离子状的，有强烈的接受电子倾向，并倾向于形成离子键的事实一致。铂基合金（如Pt-3d合金）的稳定性受电化学条件下氧覆盖度的影响。合金在相同氧覆盖度下通常比纯Pt稳定性差。在工作电位下保持零氧覆盖度是实现高活性和稳定性的关键。清洁合金表面的稳定性可以从计算得到的Pt d带结构中推断出来，该结构显示合金化通常会导致Pt d带的稳定化，使表面Pt原子更难分层或溶解。在超过20种不同的Pt2M合金中，鉴定出钼（Mo）是一种好的元素，可以与铂合金化，在高电化学电位下形成稳定的表面。Pt2Mo相对于Pt具有较低的氧还原（OR）动力学障碍，而OOH解离的障碍是OR活性的关键动力学参数。从计算得到的Pt d带结构可以推断出清洁合金表面的较高稳定性，该结构显示合金化通常导致Pt d带的稳定，从而使表面铂原子更难分离或溶解。表面稳定性遵循Pt2Mo > Pt > Pt2Ag > Pt2Pd > Pt2Nb > Pt2Ti > Pt2Sc > Pt2Zr的顺序，只有Pt2Mo在高电位（1.05 V）下表现出比纯铂更高的稳定性。Pt2Mo合金表面的氧还原反应（ORR）遵循与Pt相似的反应轮廓，其中OOH解离的过渡态（TS）决定了电位轮廓的高度。OOH解离和O2解离的TS决定了反应路径中最高的自由能位置。水环境与原位氧覆盖一起在合金表面促进ORR中起着重要作用。PtxMo合金的稳定性随着电位的增加而迅速下降，这与PtxMo表面在0.9 V以上表面氧覆盖的迅速增加一致。Pt2Mo皮肤合金实现了稳定性和活性的最佳平衡。低Mo含量（低于30%，例如Pt5Mo）在高电位下可能实现更高的稳定性，但0.9 V时的活性并不优于Pt，而高Mo含量（高于30%，例如PtMo）将开始使合金不稳定，同时降低活性。", "Doi": "10.1039/c0ee00762e"},

Platinum is a popular cathode electrocatalyst in PEM fuel cells, but its slow kinetics for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) limits catalytic efficiency. In recent years, Pt-based alloys, which include Pt and other transition metals, have been extensively studied due to their enhanced ORR activity. Surface segregation plays a key role in this process, leading to the formation of a pure Pt-skin in the outermost layer of the alloys. This surface segregation is closely related to the enhanced stability of Pt-based catalysts. Au shows strong surface segregation in PtAu alloys, whereas Co is usually unable to enrich PtCo alloy surfaces. The process of Au segregating from the second layer to the surface is exothermic, indicating that Au surface segregation is thermodynamically favorable. However, for the PtCo alloy, the surface Co atoms have a stronger tendency to migrate to the second layer, making the continuous segregation of Co unlikely. Therefore, Co segregating to the clean Pt(111) surface is both thermodynamically unfavorable and kinetically prohibitive. Surface segregation has been found to play a key role in the process of Pt-based alloys. For instance, Stamenkovic et al. found that the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is uniquely active on Pt-skin surfaces, and the reaction rate is four times that of the pure Pt catalyst. Numerous studies have been carried out using modern experimental and computational techniques to understand the importance of surface segregation for Pt-based alloys. For many Pt alloy systems, segregation trends have been unambiguously identified, and the components of surface and subsurface regions have successfully been characterized. The dissolution of metal atoms results in some defects on the alloy surface, which are critical to the rearrangement process. The phenomenon can also be observed in acidic solution, often with dissolution of the alloyed metal and rearrangement of Pt atoms. The segregation process includes interlayer migration of the impurity atom, vacancy movement at the second layer, and vacancy regeneration at the surface layer. The segregation model can successfully interpret these phenomena, particularly from a kinetics viewpoint.

The introduction of 3d metals into the Pt(111) system considerably alters the surface adsorption properties, which can be considerably modified by the 3d metals. The electronic structure of the surface Pt atoms only differs very slightly for the segregated and nonsegregated alloys. The discrepant adsorption properties are therefore mainly attributed to the direct involvement of 3d metals either on the surface or in the subsurface. The stability of Pt atoms of Pt-skin surfaces of the three alloys is enhanced with respect to those in pure Pt surfaces. Such stability enhancement is observed both in clean surfaces and under 0.25 ML of adsorbed atomic oxygen, and the degree of stability enhancement follows the opposite order of the oxygen adsorption strengths in the three studied alloys, indicating the protective role of the 3d subsurface atoms determined by their strong binding to the Pt surface layer. The presence of 3d metals in the alloys modifies the electronic and geometric properties, altering the binding strength of adsorbates. This can lead to enhanced catalytic properties and performance in various applications, such as increased oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) rate and improved electrochemical stability against dissolution. The formation of a Pt-skin layer on the surface of Pt-3d alloys, accompanied by a Pt-depleted layer underneath, is a result of surface segregation that can facilitate the removal of adsorbed species, increasing the ORR rate. The stability enhancement of Pt-skin surfaces is associated with a positive potential shift, indicating that the dissolution of Pt atoms is delayed to higher potentials. The presence of adsorbates, such as oxygen, can affect the stability of the catalysts, but Pt-skin surfaces from the alloys still show enhanced stability compared to pure Pt under adsorbate coverage.", "Chinese": "热力学偏好和反应条件对双金属催化剂的稳定性、表面分层和结构配置有重大影响,特别是在Pt基系统如Pt-3d合金中。将3d金属引入Pt(111)系统会极大地改变表面吸附性质,这些性质可以通过3d金属进行显著修改。表面Pt原子的电子结构在分层和非分层合金之间仅略有不同。因此,不同的吸附性质主要归因于3d金属直接参与表面或次表面。三种合金的Pt皮肤表面的Pt原子的稳定性相对于纯Pt表面的Pt原子有所提高。这种稳定性增强在清洁表面和0.25 ML吸附原子氧下均被观察到,并且稳定性的增强程度遵循三种研究合金中氧吸附强度的相反顺序,表明3d次表面原子的保护作用,这是由它们与Pt表面层的强结合决定的。合金中3d金属的存在改变了电子和几何性质,改变了吸附物的结合强度。这可以导致各种应用中催化性能和性能的增强,例如氧还原反应(ORR)速率的增加和对溶解的电化学稳定性的提高。Pt-3d合金表面形成Pt皮肤层,伴随着下面的Pt耗尽层,是表面分层的结果,可以促进吸附物种的去除,增加ORR速率。Pt皮肤表面的稳定性增强与正电位偏移有关,表明Pt原子的溶解被延迟到更高的电位。吸附物的存在,如氧气,可能会影响催化剂的稳定性,但与纯Pt相比,在吸附物覆盖下,合金的Pt皮肤表面仍然显示出增强的稳定性。", "Doi": "10.1021/jp8046888"},

segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems such as Pt-3d alloys, are influenced by thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions. Some near-surface alloys (NSAs) bind atomic hydrogen as weakly as noble metals while dissociating H2 more easily, which is beneficial for hydrogen-related reactions. Hydrogen chemistry on NSAs is crucial for many chemical and pharmaceutical processes. Density functional theory calculations are used to develop new NSAs for these processes. Selected NSAs allow weak hydrogen binding and low H2 dissociation barriers, which is an exception to the general rule. The lowering of the transition-state energy is observed even on non-ideal NSAs, although the effect is less pronounced. NSAs promise high hydrogenation activity at low temperatures, which is beneficial for the production of chiral pharmaceutical compounds and could potentially permit easier separation and storage of hydrogen. The stability of near-surface alloys (NSAs) can be assessed using a two-step procedure: first, considering the composition in vacuum, and then accounting for the effects of hydrogen adsorption. Adsorbates can draw to the surface components of alloys to which they bind strongly. The tendency of hydrogen to induce surface segregation can be estimated by comparing the segregation energy (Eseg) of the solute to the difference in the magnitudes of the hydrogen binding energies between the pure solute and the pure host.

Alloys are generally less stable than pure Pt at the same oxygen coverage. Maintaining zero oxygen coverage at working potentials is crucial for achieving both high activity and stability. The stability of clean alloy surfaces can be inferred from the calculated Pt d-band structure, which shows that alloying generally leads to the stabilization of the Pt d-band, making surface Pt atoms more difficult to segregate or dissolve. However, in the presence of adsorbed O atoms, the removal of Pt is facilitated because the surface vacancy can be more strongly stabilized by O atoms. This is due to the fact that Pt atoms at the surface vacancy are less coordinated and possess more active d-states, which can more strongly bond with O atoms compared to terrace Pt atoms. Additionally, with the exposure of the second layer atoms at the surface vacancy, it is possible to form a much stronger OM bond compared to the OPt bond. This is observed in the search for the optimum structure after a Pt removal, which shows that the surface vacancy is preferentially terminated by O atoms that sink to bond with the solute M atoms at the second layer. For example, in Pt2Ti skin alloys, the surface vacancies with a configuration containing OTi bonding are much more stable than those with only OPt bonding. This is consistent with the fact that atomic O on metals is anion-like, with a strong tendency to accept electrons, and prefers to form ionic-bonds. The stability of Pt alloys under electrochemical conditions is generally lower than that of pure Pt when the oxygen coverage is the same, and maintaining zero oxygen coverage at working potentials (such as 0.9 V) is crucial for achieving both high activity and stability. Among more than 20 different Pt2M alloys, molybdenum (Mo) is identified as a good element that can alloy with Pt to form a stable surface at high electrochemical potentials. Pt2Mo has a lower kinetic barrier for oxygen reduction (OR) compared to Pt, and the barrier to OOH dissociation is a key kinetic parameter for OR activity. The higher stability of clean alloy surfaces can indeed be inferred from the calculated Pt d-band structure, which shows that alloying generally leads to the stabilization of the Pt d-band, making surface Pt atoms more difficult to segregate or dissolve. The stability of surfaces follows the order Pt2Mo > Pt > Pt2Ag > Pt2Pd > Pt2Nb > Pt2Ti > Pt2Sc > Pt2Zr, and only Pt2Mo exhibits higher stability than pure Pt at high potential (1.05 V). The oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) on a Pt2Mo alloy surface follows a similar reaction profile as on Pt, with the transition state (TS) for OOH dissociation determining the height of the potential profile. The TSs for OOH dissociation and O2 dissociation dictate the highest free energy positions in the reaction pathways. The aqueous environment, together with the in situ oxygen coverage, plays an important role in facilitating the ORR on alloy surfaces. The stability of PtxMo alloys drops quickly with increasing potential, in line with the rapid increase of surface oxygen coverage for PtxMo surfaces above 0.9 V. The Pt2Mo skin alloy achieves the best balance of stability and activity. A low Mo content (below 30%, e.g., Pt5Mo) may achieve a higher stability at high potentials, but the activity is not better than Pt at 0.9 V, while a high Mo content (above 30%, e.g., PtMo) will start to destabilize the alloy and also reduce the activity.", "Chinese": "Pt基合金（如Pt-3d合金）的稳定性受电化学条件下氧覆盖度的影响。在相同的氧覆盖度下，合金通常比纯Pt的稳定性差。在工作电位下保持零氧覆盖度对于实现高活性和稳定性至关重要。从计算得到的Pt d带结构可以推断出清洁合金表面的稳定性，该结构显示合金化通常导致Pt d带的稳定，使表面Pt原子更难分层或溶解。然而，在吸附O原子的存在下，Pt的去除被促进，因为表面空位可以被O原子更强烈地稳定。这是由于表面空位处的Pt原子的配位较少，具有更活跃的d态，与O原子的结合力比台地Pt原子更强。此外，随着表面空位处第二层原子的暴露，与OPt键相比，可以形成更强的OM键。这在Pt去除后寻找最优结构的观察中得到证实，显示表面空位优先被下沉到第二层与溶质M原子结合的O原子终止。例如，在Pt2Ti皮肤合金中，含有OTi键的表面空位比仅含OPt键的空位更稳定。这与金属上的原子O是阴离子状的，有强烈的接受电子倾向，并倾向于形成离子键的事实一致。铂基合金（如Pt-3d合金）的稳定性受电化学条件下氧覆盖度的影响。合金在相同氧覆盖度下通常比纯Pt稳定性差。在工作电位下保持零氧覆盖度是实现高活性和稳定性的关键。清洁合金表面的稳定性可以从计算得到的Pt d带结构中推断出来，该结构显示合金化通常会导致Pt d带的稳定化，使表面Pt原子更难分层或溶解。在超过20种不同的Pt2M合金中，鉴定出钼（Mo）是一种好的元素，可以与铂合金化，在高电化学电位下形成稳定的表面。Pt2Mo相对于Pt具有较低的氧还原（OR）动力学障碍，而OOH解离的障碍是OR活性的关键动力学参数。从计算得到的Pt d带结构可以推断出清洁合金表面的较高稳定性，该结构显示合金化通常导致Pt d带的稳定，从而使表面铂原子更难分离或溶解。表面稳定性遵循Pt2Mo > Pt > Pt2Ag > Pt2Pd > Pt2Nb > Pt2Ti > Pt2Sc > Pt2Zr的顺序，只有Pt2Mo在高电位（1.05 V）下表现出比纯铂更高的稳定性。Pt2Mo合金表面的氧还原反应（ORR）遵循与Pt相似的反应轮廓，其中OOH解离的过渡态（TS）决定了电位轮廓的高度。OOH解离和O2解离的TS决定了反应路径中最高的自由能位置。水环境与原位氧覆盖一起在合金表面促进ORR中起着重要作用。PtxMo合金的稳定性随着电位的增加而迅速下降，这与PtxMo表面在0.9 V以上表面氧覆盖的迅速增加一致。Pt2Mo皮肤合金实现了稳定性和活性的最佳平衡。低Mo含量（低于30%，例如Pt5Mo）在高电位下可能实现更高的稳定性，但0.9 V时的活性并不优于Pt，而高Mo含量（高于30%，例如PtMo）将开始使合金不稳定，同时降低活性。", "Doi": "10.1039/c0ee00762e"},

Platinum is a popular cathode electrocatalyst in PEM fuel cells, but its slow kinetics for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) limits catalytic efficiency. In recent years, Pt-based alloys, which include Pt and other transition metals, have been extensively studied due to their enhanced ORR activity. Surface segregation plays a key role in this process, leading to the formation of a pure Pt-skin in the outermost layer of the alloys. This surface segregation is closely related to the enhanced stability of Pt-based catalysts. Au shows strong surface segregation in PtAu alloys, whereas Co is usually unable to enrich PtCo alloy surfaces. The process of Au segregating from the second layer to the surface is exothermic, indicating that Au surface segregation is thermodynamically favorable.

Therefore, Co segregating to the clean Pt(111) surface is both thermodynamically unfavorable and kinetically prohibitive.

The electronic structure of the surface Pt atoms only differs very slightly for the segregated and nonsegregated alloys.

Alloys are generally less stable than pure Pt at the same oxygen coverage. Maintaining zero oxygen coverage at working potentials is crucial for achieving both high activity and stability. The stability of clean alloy surfaces can be inferred from the calculated Pt d-band structure, which shows that alloying generally leads to the stabilization of the Pt d-band, making surface Pt atoms more difficult to segregate or dissolve. However, in the presence of adsorbed O atoms, the removal of Pt is facilitated because the surface vacancy can be more strongly stabilized by O atoms. This is due to the fact that Pt atoms at the surface vacancy are less coordinated and possess more active d-states, which can more strongly bond with O atoms compared to terrace Pt atoms. Additionally, with the exposure of the second layer atoms at the surface vacancy, it is possible to form a much stronger OM bond compared to the OPt bond. This is observed in the search for the optimum structure after a Pt removal, which shows that the surface vacancy is preferentially terminated by O atoms that sink to bond with the solute M atoms at the second layer. For example, in Pt2Ti skin alloys, the surface vacancies with a configuration containing OTi bonding are much more stable than those with only OPt bonding. This is consistent with the fact that atomic O on metals is anion-like, with a strong tendency to accept electrons, and prefers to form ionic-bonds. The stability of Pt alloys under electrochemical conditions is generally lower than that of pure Pt when the oxygen coverage is the same, and maintaining zero oxygen coverage at working potentials (such as 0.9 V) is crucial for achieving both high activity and stability. Among more than 20 different Pt2M alloys, molybdenum (Mo) is identified as a good element that can alloy with Pt to form a stable surface at high electrochemical potentials. Pt2Mo has a lower kinetic barrier for oxygen reduction (OR) compared to Pt, and the barrier to OOH dissociation is a key kinetic parameter for OR activity. The higher stability of clean alloy surfaces can indeed be inferred from the calculated Pt d-band structure, which shows that alloying generally leads to the stabilization of the Pt d-band, making surface Pt atoms more difficult to segregate or dissolve. The stability of surfaces follows the order Pt2Mo > Pt > Pt2Ag > Pt2Pd > Pt2Nb > Pt2Ti > Pt2Sc > Pt2Zr, and only Pt2Mo exhibits higher stability than pure Pt at high potential (1.05 V). The oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) on a Pt2Mo alloy surface follows a similar reaction profile as on Pt, with the transition state (TS) for OOH dissociation determining the height of the potential profile. The TSs for OOH dissociation and O2 dissociation dictate the highest free energy positions in the reaction pathways. The aqueous environment, together with the in situ oxygen coverage, plays an important role in facilitating the ORR on alloy surfaces. The stability of PtxMo alloys drops quickly with increasing potential, in line with the rapid increase of surface oxygen coverage for PtxMo surfaces above 0.9 V. The Pt2Mo skin alloy achieves the best balance of stability and activity. A low Mo content (below 30%, e.g., Pt5Mo) may achieve a higher stability at high potentials, but the activity is not better than Pt at 0.9 V, while a high Mo content (above 30%, e.g., PtMo) will start to destabilize the alloy and also reduce the activity.", "Chinese": "Pt基合金（如Pt-3d合金）的稳定性受电化学条件下氧覆盖度的影响。在相同的氧覆盖度下，合金通常比纯Pt的稳定性差。在工作电位下保持零氧覆盖度对于实现高活性和稳定性至关重要。从计算得到的Pt d带结构可以推断出清洁合金表面的稳定性，该结构显示合金化通常导致Pt d带的稳定，使表面Pt原子更难分层或溶解。然而，在吸附O原子的存在下，Pt的去除被促进，因为表面空位可以被O原子更强烈地稳定。这是由于表面空位处的Pt原子的配位较少，具有更活跃的d态，与O原子的结合力比台地Pt原子更强。此外，随着表面空位处第二层原子的暴露，与OPt键相比，可以形成更强的OM键。这在Pt去除后寻找最优结构的观察中得到证实，显示表面空位优先被下沉到第二层与溶质M原子结合的O原子终止。例如，在Pt2Ti皮肤合金中，含有OTi键的表面空位比仅含OPt键的空位更稳定。这与金属上的原子O是阴离子状的，有强烈的接受电子倾向，并倾向于形成离子键的事实一致。铂基合金（如Pt-3d合金）的稳定性受电化学条件下氧覆盖度的影响。合金在相同氧覆盖度下通常比纯Pt稳定性差。在工作电位下保持零氧覆盖度是实现高活性和稳定性的关键。清洁合金表面的稳定性可以从计算得到的Pt d带结构中推断出来，该结构显示合金化通常会导致Pt d带的稳定化，使表面Pt原子更难分层或溶解。在超过20种不同的Pt2M合金中，鉴定出钼（Mo）是一种好的元素，可以与铂合金化，在高电化学电位下形成稳定的表面。Pt2Mo相对于Pt具有较低的氧还原（OR）动力学障碍，而OOH解离的障碍是OR活性的关键动力学参数。从计算得到的Pt d带结构可以推断出清洁合金表面的较高稳定性，该结构显示合金化通常导致Pt d带的稳定，从而使表面铂原子更难分离或溶解。表面稳定性遵循Pt2Mo > Pt > Pt2Ag > Pt2Pd > Pt2Nb > Pt2Ti > Pt2Sc > Pt2Zr的顺序，只有Pt2Mo在高电位（1.05 V）下表现出比纯铂更高的稳定性。Pt2Mo合金表面的氧还原反应（ORR）遵循与Pt相似的反应轮廓，其中OOH解离的过渡态（TS）决定了电位轮廓的高度。OOH解离和O2解离的TS决定了反应路径中最高的自由能位置。水环境与原位氧覆盖一起在合金表面促进ORR中起着重要作用。PtxMo合金的稳定性随着电位的增加而迅速下降，这与PtxMo表面在0.9 V以上表面氧覆盖的迅速增加一致。Pt2Mo皮肤合金实现了稳定性和活性的最佳平衡。低Mo含量（低于30%，例如Pt5Mo）在高电位下可能实现更高的稳定性，但0.9 V时的活性并不优于Pt，而高Mo含量（高于30%，例如PtMo）将开始使合金不稳定，同时降低活性。", "Doi": "10.1039/c0ee00762e"},

The onset of bulk migration of Cu is explained by the results with adsorbed CO, and the interdiffusion of Cu and Pt becomes significant at 460 K, where the formation and breakup of the stable CO-induced surface alloy start to occur. The results add to the promise of using molecular adsorbate-induced surface changes as a tool for selective and dynamical engineering of alloy surfaces, likely extending to a wide variety of coinage (Cu, Ag)/Pt-group bimetallic surface alloys.\nThe stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems such as Pt-3d alloys, are influenced by thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions. Contrary to expectations, CO adsorption at elevated pressures and temperatures can pull the less reactive Cu to the surface of a CuPt near-surface alloy, forming a stable self-organized CO/CuPt surface alloy structure. This is due to the significantly stronger PtCO bond when Cu is present in the first surface layer of Pt.

CO adsorption at elevated pressures and temperatures can pull the less reactive Cu to the surface of a CuPt near-surface alloy, driven by the formation of a stable self-organized CO/CuPt surface alloy structure. This is due to the drastically stronger PtCO bond when Cu is present in the first surface layer of Pt. The results are expected to apply to a range of coinage (Cu, Ag)/Pt-group bimetallic surface alloys. The bonding of adsorbates can induce changes in local atomic composition and surface structure, changing the activity and selectivity of the catalyst. The CuPt near-surface alloy (NSA) was suggested as a promising water-gas shift catalyst because of reduced PtCO bonding on a Pt catalyst surface with Cu present in the second layer. However, the NSA is unstable at elevated CO pressures and sample temperatures, forming instead a self-organized CO/CuPt surface alloy (SA) structure. The results are confirmed by extended density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Although Cu diffusion to the first layer is endothermic, the drastic increase in CO binding energy more than compensates for the endothermicity. The vastly increased PtCO bond strength when 2/3 ML of Cu is present in the first layer rationalizes the observed Cu surface segregation. The calculated higher stability of the CuPt SA compared with Cu in the bulk with CO adsorption on clean Pt(111) is nearly equal to the free-energy difference (ΔG). The interdiffusion of Cu and Pt becomes significant at 460 K, and the formation and breakup of the stable CO-induced surface alloy start to occur at this temperature. The DFT calculations reproduce the experimental observations and confirm the rationalization of the observed Cu surface segregation.

The slight differences in the stability of the surface alloy may be due to the lower Pd content (44%) in the surface alloy compared to Pt (70%).
