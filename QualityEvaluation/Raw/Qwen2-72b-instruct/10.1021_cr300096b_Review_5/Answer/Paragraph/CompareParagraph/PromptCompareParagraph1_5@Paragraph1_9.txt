Detailed analysis established from the study of reference \[10.1007/s11244-010-9447-2\]. Synthesized comprehension stemming from references \[10.1088/0953-8984\_23\_47\_475301\] and \[10.1039/b107037a\].

    

    Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: The comprehensive review of thermodynamic stability, structural dynamics, and catalytic implications of bimetallic surface structures under varying reaction conditions, with emphasis on Pt-based alloy systems, reveals a rich tapestry of phenomena. Pt3dPt subsurface structures are stable in vacuum and hydrogen, but oxygen induces 3d atom surface segregation, with PtNiPt showing the highest resistance and PtTiPt being the most susceptible \[10.1007/s11244-010-9447-2\]. Simulation results on PtPd nanoparticles demonstrate Pd segregation to the surface, creating a gradient in Pt concentration with Pd-enriched shells and Pt-enriched cores \[10.1088/0953-8984\_23\_47\_475301\]. Under specific conditions, Fe dissolution in PtFe alloys triggers the formation of a protective Pt skin layer with (111)-oriented facets, shielding the alloy from corrosion \[10.1039/b107037a\].

    These findings underscore the pivotal role of surface segregation in catalytic properties and performance. The enhanced stability and catalytic activity of Pt-skin surfaces, particularly in oxygen reduction reactions (ORR), highlight the critical importance of understanding surface composition and segregation trends under operational conditions. The fourfold increase in ORR rate on Pt-skin surfaces compared to pure Pt, as observed in Pt3Co alloys \[10.1021/ct8004062\], exemplifies the potential for surface segregation to significantly boost catalytic performance.

    Future research endeavors might focus on the development of advanced computational models to predict surface segregation under various reaction conditions, incorporating the effects of temperature, pressure, and adsorbates. This could facilitate the design of novel bimetallic catalysts with optimized surface structures for specific applications. Additionally, the exploration of ternary and quaternary Pt-based alloys could offer new avenues for enhancing catalytic properties through complex surface dynamics and synergistic effects between multiple alloying elements.

    The integration of in situ spectroscopic techniques with computational methods could provide deeper insights into the dynamic changes in surface structure during catalytic reactions, enabling a more comprehensive understanding of the catalytic cycle. Furthermore, the investigation of Pt-based alloys in non-traditional catalytic processes, such as the selective oxidation of organic compounds or the conversion of CO2 to value-added chemicals, could reveal new applications for these materials.

    In summary, the detailed analysis of thermodynamic stability, structural dynamics, and catalytic implications of bimetallic surface structures under varying reaction conditions, with a focus on Pt-based alloy systems, provides a solid foundation for future research. The insights gained from this review highlight the potential for surface segregation to significantly impact catalytic performance and suggest promising directions for the development of advanced bimetallic catalysts.

3.1 DFT Calculations of Thermodynamic Stability
One of the most critical questions in bimetallic catalysis is the stability of bimetallic surface structures under reaction conditions, which would in turn modify the catalytic properties. For example, as shown earlier in Figure 3, the monolayer surface Ni atoms diffuse into the subsurface region of Pt(111) upon annealing, indicating that the subsurface Pt&ndash;Ni&ndash;Pt(111) structure is thermodynamically more stable than the surface Ni&ndash;Pt&ndash;Pt(111) structure in vacuum, i.e., without adsorbates. Several other investigations of Pt&ndash;3d alloys in fuel cell applications have suggested that the alloy films used in these studies are covered by a Pt skin, (195-197) again indicating the thermodynamic preference of Pt-terminated bimetallic surfaces.
Ruban et al. (198) have utilized DFT to calculate the segregation energy (Eseg) for transition metal alloys, which is the thermodynamic driving potential to move the subsurface admetal from the bulk to the surface of the host metal in vacuum. Alden et al. (199) have shown that the surface segregation energy in transition metal alloy depends strongly on the crystal structure and is essentially given by the difference in the surface energies of the pure alloy components. Ruban et al. (198) have performed DFT calculations of the values of Eseg for admetal atoms (M) on many host substrates (H), utilizing the linear-muffin&ndash;tin-orbitals coherent potential approximation. If Eseg is sufficiently negative, the admetal segregates to the surface to produce the M&ndash;H&ndash;H surface monolayer structure. If Eseg is sufficiently positive, the surface layer is the host metal, leading to the formation of the H&ndash;M&ndash;H subsurface monolayer structure. Christensen et al. (43) have also utilized DFT to investigate surface alloy phases and their stability based on surface phase diagrams constructed from the surface energy as a function of the surface composition.
Greeley and Mavrikakis (12) performed segregation energy calculations by examining the effects of adsorbates on the stability of the surface and subsurface structures. It was found that the thermodynamic driving force of hydrogen-induced segregation was related to two terms: the value of Eseg and the difference between the hydrogen-binding energies on the surface and subsurface structures. Because hydrogen binds relatively weakly to most transition metals, only a few bimetallic surfaces experience a hydrogen-induced segregation of the subsurface admetals.
Besides hydrogen, it is also important to study the influence of adsorbates on surface segregation using a strong adsorbate, such as oxygen. Figure 6 shows the total energy difference, ΔEseg, defined as the difference between the formation energy of the subsurface and surface structures, as a function of the surface d-band center in the 3d&ndash;Pt&ndash;Pt(111) structure. The values of ΔEseg are positive for all systems under vacuum, predicting that the Pt&ndash;3d&ndash;Pt(111) subsurface structures are thermodynamically more stable than the 3d&ndash;Pt&ndash;Pt(111) surface in vacuum. For comparison, the ΔEseg values are also included in Figure 6 with 0.5 ML atomic hydrogen and oxygen. (33) The DFT results predict that the subsurface configuration remains thermodynamically preferred with adsorbed hydrogen. However, the subsurface structure is no longer stable in the presence of 0.5 ML atomic oxygen, indicating a thermodynamic driving potential for the subsurface 3d metals to segregate to the surface. Additional atomic adsorbates are studied by Menning and Chen (200) to compare how the thermodynamic potential for segregation varies with adsorbate binding strength. An adsorbate with a weak Pauling electronegativity, such as H, S, Se, or C, binds weakly with both surface and subsurface configurations and provides only a small shift in the thermodynamic potential for interchanging the configuration. In contrast, an adsorbate with a strong Pauling electronegativity, such as N or O, produces a large difference in binding energy between the two configurations. When the surface coverage of N or O is high enough, this difference outweighs the thermodynamic potential for retaining the subsurface configuration in vacuum. (200)
The results in Figure 6 indicate that the presence of atomic oxygen makes the 3d&ndash;Pt&ndash;Pt(111) surface structure more thermodynamically stable than Pt&ndash;3d&ndash;Pt(111). Menning and Chen have extended DFT calculations to the Pt(100) substrate to explore the effect of crystal structure on segregation. Although the values of the d-band center and ΔEseg are different for 3d metals on Pt(111) and Pt(100), the general trend in the relative stability of the surface and subsurface structures remains the same. (33) The oxygen-induced surface segregation is also predicted for the (211) surfaces of Pt(shell)/M(core) and Pt3M (M = Co, Ir) alloys by Callejas-Tovar and Balbuena. (201) Table 2 provides a list of DFT calculations and experimental studies of surface segregation of various bimetallic surfaces with several types of atomic and molecular adsorbates.
