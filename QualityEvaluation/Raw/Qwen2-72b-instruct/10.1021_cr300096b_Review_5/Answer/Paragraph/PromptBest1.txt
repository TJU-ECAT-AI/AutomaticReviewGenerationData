The thermodynamic stability, structural dynamics, and catalytic implications of bimetallic surface structures under varying reaction conditions, with emphasis on Pt-based alloy systems, are intricately connected. DFT predictions and experimental evidence confirm the stability of Pt3dPt subsurface structures in vacuum and with hydrogen, but oxygen induces 3d atom segregation to the surface, forming 3dPtPt structures \[10.1007/s11244-010-9447-2\]. PtNiPt shows the highest resistance to oxygen-induced segregation, while PtTiPt is most susceptible. Stability trends favor subsurface configurations in vacuum and hydrogen, while surface configurations are preferred with oxygen. Δεd aids in screening alloys for stability, and empirical equations forecast thermodynamic stability in various environments. Sabatier's principle suggests that optimal binding properties for subsurface structures may halt reactions on surface structures and vice versa, impacting catalytic performance.

Simulations reveal Pd's surface segregation in PtPd nanoparticles, creating Pd-enriched shells and Pt-enriched cores \[10.1088/0953-8984_23_47_475301\]. Pd atoms prefer (100) facets over (111) facets on the nanoparticle shell, significantly affecting catalytic properties and performance in various applications. Under specific reaction conditions, a protective Pt skin layer forms on PtFe alloys, predominantly with (111)-oriented facets, as observed by in situ electrochemical STM \[10.1039/b107037a\]. This layer shields the alloy from corrosion, enhancing its stability and catalytic properties in fuel cell applications.

Alloying Pt with Fe enhances electrocatalytic activity, peaking at 50% Fe content, 25 times higher than pure Pt \[10.1016/s0022-0728(98)00361-1\]. This enhancement is attributed to the 5d-vacancy on the surface, which is pivotal for understanding catalytic implications under varying reaction conditions. In PEM fuel cells, Pt's sluggish oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) kinetics limit catalytic efficiency, leading to research on Pt-based alloys for enhanced activity \[10.1021/ct8004062\]. Surface segregation, where Pt forms a pure skin on the alloy surface, is crucial for stability and catalytic performance. Au exhibits strong segregation in PtAu alloys, thermodynamically favorable due to exothermic processes, unlike PtCo alloys where Co migration to the surface is both thermodynamically unfavorable and kinetically prohibitive. Pt-skin surfaces on Pt-based alloys show a fourfold increase in ORR activity compared to pure Pt, highlighting the role of surface segregation in catalytic efficiency.

In Pt-3d bimetallic catalysts, 3d metals enhance surface adsorption, stabilizing Pt-skin surfaces, particularly under oxygen-covered conditions \[10.1021/jp8046888\]. This stability, linked to oxygen adsorption strength, boosts catalytic properties, including the oxygen reduction reaction rate and electrochemical stability. Surface segregation facilitates adsorbate removal, increasing the ORR rate, and the stability of Pt-skin surfaces delays Pt atom dissolution to higher potentials, with 3d subsurface atoms providing protection.

Annealing transforms PtRu/Ru(0001) surfaces into surface alloys, impacting adsorption properties and catalytic activity \[10.1002/cphc.201000391\]. Probe molecule adsorption sensitivity to local surface structure and composition in Pt-based alloys highlights ensemble and electronic interaction effects, crucial for understanding catalytic properties. Surface segregation in Pt-3d bimetallic catalysts boosts catalytic activities, notably enhancing the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) beyond pure Pt capabilities \[10.1016/j.susc.2008.11.036\]. This phenomenon, closely tied to unusual catalytic activity, has attracted extensive research, with studies revealing that the ORR is uniquely active on Pt-skin surfaces, achieving reaction rates four times higher than pure Pt.

PtNiPt resists oxygen-induced segregation most, while PtTiPt is most susceptible. Δεd correlates with thermodynamic stability and kinetic barriers, predicting stability trends in various conditions. Sabatier's principle suggests subsurface structures with optimal binding may halt reactions on surface structures, and vice versa. DFT and experiments confirm subsurface configurations are preferred in vacuum and with hydrogen, while surface configurations are favored with oxygen. Activation barriers for oxygen-induced segregation vary among Pt3dPt structures, with Pt3dPt(100) having higher barriers than Pt3dPt(111) \[10.1007/s11244-010-9447-2\].

The thermodynamic stability and structural dynamics of bimetallic surface structures in Pt-based alloy systems, particularly in propane dehydrogenation catalysts, are significantly influenced by varying reaction conditions. Pt3dPt subsurface structures exhibit stability in vacuum and with hydrogen, but segregate with oxygen, as predicted by DFT and verified experimentally \[10.1007/s11244-010-9447-2\]. PtNiPt shows the highest resistance to oxygen-induced segregation, while PtTiPt is most susceptible. Stability trends correlate with d-band center differences, predicting preferred configurations in various environments. Oxygen binding energy differences highlight the need for understanding stability in reacting environments. Sabatier's principle suggests optimal binding properties in subsurface structures may halt reactions on surface structures and vice versa. Empirical equations predict thermodynamic stability in different conditions, and linear trends extend beyond Pt3d alloys. Segregation behavior is consistent across single crystal and polycrystalline substrates, bridging the materials gap. In PtPd nanoparticles, Pd segregates to the outer layers, forming Pd-enriched shells, while Pt concentration increases towards the bulk, creating Pt-enriched cores \[10.1088/0953-8984_23_47_475301\]. Notably, Pd atoms prefer (100) facets over (111) facets on the nanoparticle shell, which has implications for catalytic properties and performance in various applications. Under specific reaction conditions, Fe dissolution in PtFe alloys leads to the formation of a protective Pt skin layer with (111)-oriented facets, as observed by in situ electrochemical STM \[10.1039/b107037a\]. This layer, formed through increased Fe dissolution and Pt rearrangement, shields the PtFe alloy from corrosion, enhancing its catalytic properties in fuel cells, as indicated by the disappearance of the Fe2+/Fe3+ redox peak. Alloying Pt with Fe boosts electrocatalytic activity, peaking at 50% Fe content, 25 times higher than pure Pt, due to the 5d-vacancy of the surface, crucial for high-performance cathode electrocatalysts in polymer electrolyte fuel cells \[10.1016/s0022-0728(98)00361-1\]. Thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions significantly influence the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems. Pt, a crucial cathode electrocatalyst in PEM fuel cells, faces efficiency limitations due to slow ORR kinetics. Pt-based alloys, featuring Pt and transition metals, exhibit enhanced ORR activity attributed to surface segregation, which forms a pure Pt-skin on the outer layer, boosting stability. Au demonstrates strong surface segregation in PtAu alloys, unlike Co in PtCo alloys, where Au's segregation is thermodynamically favorable, whereas Co's is both thermodynamically unfavorable and kinetically prohibitive. Surface segregation notably increases ORR activity on Pt-skin surfaces, quadrupling the reaction rate compared to pure Pt \[10.1021/ct8004062\]. These findings underscore the critical role of surface segregation in the catalytic performance of Pt-based alloys.

The thermodynamic stability and structural dynamics of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems, are significantly influenced by reaction conditions, as evidenced by studies on Pt3dPt subsurface structures \[10.1007/s11244-010-9447-2\]. These structures are stable in vacuum and with hydrogen but segregate under oxygen, with PtNiPt exhibiting the greatest resistance and PtTiPt being the most susceptible. This stability trend, confirmed on single crystal and polycrystalline Pt, correlates with d-band center differences, enabling bimetallic alloy screening. Activation barriers for oxygen-induced segregation vary by crystal facet, with PtNiPt showing the highest resistance and PtTiPt being the most susceptible.

                    Surface segregation in Pt-based bimetallic catalysts, notably Pt-3d alloys, critically influences catalytic activities, enhancing oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) performance compared to pure Pt \[10.1016/j.susc.2008.11.036\]. This phenomenon significantly alters catalytic properties, with surface segregation under adsorbates playing a key role in activity improvement. Remarkably, the ORR is uniquely active on the Pt-skin surface of Pt3Co alloys, with reaction rates four times higher than pure Pt. Studying Pt alloys under surface adsorption is essential for optimizing catalytic applications, as it affects surface composition and electronic structure, determining catalytic properties.
