The thermodynamic stability, structural dynamics, and catalytic implications of bimetallic surface structures, particularly those based on platinum (Pt) alloys, are critical areas of investigation in heterogeneous catalysis. Under varying reaction conditions, these bimetallic surfaces exhibit unique properties that significantly influence their catalytic performance. The alloying of Pt with other metals can enhance the stability of the surface against sintering and poisoning, while also modifying the electronic structure of the catalyst, which in turn affects its reactivity. Structural dynamics, including changes in surface composition and morphology, play a crucial role in determining the catalytic activity and selectivity. For instance, the segregation of one metal component under certain reaction conditions can lead to the formation of active sites that are distinct from those present in the bulk material. Understanding these dynamics is essential for the rational design of bimetallic catalysts with improved performance in various chemical processes, such as hydrogenation, oxidation, and fuel cell reactions. Advanced characterization techniques, including in situ and operando methods, are pivotal in unraveling the complex interplay between structure, stability, and catalytic function in Pt-based alloy systems.
