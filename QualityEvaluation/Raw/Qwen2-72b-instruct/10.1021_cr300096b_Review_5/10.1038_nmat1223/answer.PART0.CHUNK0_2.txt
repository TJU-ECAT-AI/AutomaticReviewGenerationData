1.The stability of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems such as Pt-3d alloys, is influenced by a two-step procedure considering the composition in vacuum and the effects of hydrogen adsorption. Adsorbates can draw to the surface components of alloys to which they bind strongly, affecting the surface segregation. The tendency of hydrogen to induce surface segregation can be estimated by comparing the segregation energy of the solute to the difference in the magnitudes of the hydrogen binding energies between the pure solute and the pure host. Real near-surface alloys (NSAs) may differ from idealized models, with solute atoms segregating more deeply into the host, varying solute coverage, and unusual atomic arrangements leading to defects or long-range reconstructions. These deviations do not substantially affect the main trends in adsorbate behavior but have a quantitative effect on the properties of adsorbates. To fully benefit from the unique catalytic properties of NSAs, precise control of metal catalyst surface structure is needed, which may be achieved through improved nanofabrication techniques. Recent innovations suggest that practical nanofabrication strategies for metals are not far off.

1.双金属催化剂的稳定性，特别是在Pt基系统如Pt-3d合金中，受到考虑真空中的组成和氢吸附效应的两步程序的影响。吸附物可以将合金中与其强烈结合的组分吸引到表面，影响表面分层。氢诱导表面分层的倾向可以通过比较溶质的分层能量与纯溶质和纯基体之间氢结合能的差值来估计。实际的近表面合金（NSAs）可能与理想化模型不同，溶质原子可能更深入地分层到基体中，溶质覆盖度变化，以及异常的原子排列导致缺陷或长程重构。这些偏差不会实质上影响吸附物行为的主要趋势，但对吸附物的性质有定量影响。为了充分利用NSAs的独特催化性能，需要对金属催化剂表面结构进行精确控制，这可能通过改进的纳米制造技术实现。最近的创新表明，金属的实用纳米制造策略可能并不遥远。
