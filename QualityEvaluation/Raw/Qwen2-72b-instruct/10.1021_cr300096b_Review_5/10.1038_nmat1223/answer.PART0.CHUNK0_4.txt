1.The stability of near-surface alloys (NSAs) can be assessed using a two-step procedure: first, considering the composition in vacuum, and then accounting for the effects of hydrogen adsorption. Adsorbates can draw to the surface components of alloys to which they bind strongly. The tendency of hydrogen to induce surface segregation can be estimated by comparing the segregation energy (Eseg) of the solute to the difference in the magnitudes of the hydrogen binding energies between the pure solute and the pure host. Real NSAs may differ from idealized models, but these deviations do not substantially affect the main trends in adsorbate behavior. Some experimental studies have shown significantly modified catalytic activity on non-ideal NSAs, in line with theoretical predictions.

1.近表面合金（NSA）的稳定性可以通过两步程序进行评估：首先，考虑真空中的组成，然后考虑氢吸附的影响。吸附物可以将合金中与其强烈结合的成分吸引到表面。氢诱导表面分层的倾向可以通过比较溶质的分层能（Eseg）与纯溶质和纯基体之间氢结合能差值来估计。实际的NSA可能与理想模型有所不同，但这些偏差不会对吸附物行为的主要趋势产生实质性影响。一些实验研究已经表明，在非理想的NSA上，催化活性有显著的改变，这与理论预测一致。
