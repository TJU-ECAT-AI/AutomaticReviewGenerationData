[1] "Some of these NSAs bind atomic hydrogen (H) as weakly as the noble metals (Cu, Au) while, at the same time, dissociating H2 much more easily. This unique set of properties may permit these alloys to serve as low-temperature, highly selective catalysts for pharmaceuticals production and as robust fuel-cell anodes."
[2] "Hydrogen chemistry on NSAs is of particular interest, as this element has so important a role in many chemical12,13 and pharmaceutical14 processes. Hydrogen is also increasingly used in energy production and storage technologies15,16,17,18,19, including fuel cells."
[3] "The stability can be assessed using a simple, two-step procedure, first considering the composition in vacuum, and then accounting for the effects of hydrogen adsorption."
[4] "In general, adsorbates can draw to the surface components of alloys to which they bind strongly."
[5] "We find that a reliable estimate of the tendency of hydrogen to induce surface segregation can be made by comparing Eseg of the solute to the difference in the magnitudes of the hydrogen binding energies between the pure solute and the pure host (BEHsol  BEHhost, where BEH is the energy change when atomic hydrogen is adsorbed from the gas phase onto the metal surface)."
[6] "In the upper right and lower left quadrants, the parity line divides segregating from non-segregating regions."
[7] "We have confirmed that this simple technique reliably predicts segregation behaviour in the presence of hydrogen, although there may be exceptions in cases where Eseg and BEHsol  BEHhost are within 0.1 eV of one another."
[8] "In general, Fig. 1 suggests that hydrogen will not induce surface segregation for most solute/host transition metal pairs, at least at low temperatures and pressures."
[9] "The range of BEs of oxygen, sulphur and CO across the pure transition metals is larger than is the corresponding range for hydrogen (the range of BE between Au and Ru, for example, is 0.75 eV for H, 1.87 eV for CO, 2.25 eV for S and 2.70 eV for O), so these species will generally have larger thermodynamic driving forces for adsorbate-induced segregation."
[10] "Real NSAs may, nonetheless, differ in certain ways from our idealized NSA models."
[11] "In some cases, a portion of the solute in a subsurface alloy may segregate more deeply into the host."
[12] "In other cases, the total coverage of solute in the surface region may differ from one monolayer, leading to different types of subsurface alloy structures26."
[13] "In still other situations, arrangements of atoms with unusual periodicity (or even no periodicity at all) may permit the formation of defects or long-range reconstructions27,28."
[14] "We have found that these possible deviations from our idealized NSA structures do not substantially affect the main trends in adsorbate behaviour presented below."
[15] "However, the deviations from the idealized cases do have a quantitative effect on the properties of adsorbates on these NSAs."
[16] "Thus, to benefit fully from the unique catalytic properties of NSAs, more precise control of metal catalyst surface structure will be needed, perhaps through improved nanofabrication techniques."
[17] "Recent innovations in atomic layer deposition and in nanoparticle fabrication technologies for metals suggest that practical nanofabrication strategies for metals may not be far off29,30,31."

1.The stability of near-surface alloys (NSAs) can be assessed using a two-step procedure: first, considering the composition in vacuum, and then accounting for the effects of hydrogen adsorption. Adsorbates can draw to the surface components of alloys to which they bind strongly. The tendency of hydrogen to induce surface segregation can be estimated by comparing the segregation energy (Eseg) of the solute to the difference in the magnitudes of the hydrogen binding energies between the pure solute and the pure host. In general, hydrogen will not induce surface segregation for most solute/host transition metal pairs at low temperatures and pressures. However, real NSAs may differ from idealized models in terms of solute distribution, coverage, and atomic arrangements, which can lead to different types of subsurface alloy structures and affect the properties of adsorbates on these NSAs. To fully benefit from the unique catalytic properties of NSAs, precise control of metal catalyst surface structure is needed, which may be achieved through improved nanofabrication techniques.

1.近表面合金（NSAs）的稳定性可以通过两步程序进行评估：首先，考虑真空中的组成，然后考虑氢吸附的影响。吸附物可以将与之强烈结合的合金成分吸引到表面。氢诱导表面分层的倾向可以通过比较溶质的分层能（Eseg）与纯溶质和纯基体之间氢结合能的差值来估计。一般来说，在低温和低压下，氢不会诱导大多数溶质/基体过渡金属对的表面分层。然而，实际的NSAs可能在溶质分布、覆盖度和原子排列方面与理想模型有所不同，这可能导致不同类型的亚表面合金结构，并影响这些NSAs上吸附物的性质。为了充分利用NSAs的独特催化性能，需要对金属催化剂表面结构进行精确控制，这可能通过改进的纳米制造技术实现。

1.双金属催化剂的稳定性、表面分层和结构配置，特别是在基于Pt的系统如Pt-3d合金中，受到热力学偏好和反应条件的影响。一些近表面合金(NSAs)像贵金属一样弱地结合原子氢，同时更容易分解H2，这对氢相关的反应是有益的。NSAs上的氢化学对许多化学和制药过程至关重要。使用密度泛函理论计算来为这些过程开发新的NSAs。选定的NSAs允许弱的氢结合和低的H2解离势垒，这是对一般规则的例外。即使在非理想的NSAs上，过渡态能量的降低也被观察到，尽管效果不那么明显。NSAs在低温下承诺高氢化活性，这对生产手性药物化合物有利，而且可能允许更容易分离和储存氢。
