[1] "Some of these NSAs bind atomic hydrogen (H) as weakly as the noble metals (Cu, Au) while, at the same time, dissociating H2 much more easily."
[2] "Hydrogen chemistry on NSAs is of particular interest, as this element has so important a role in many chemical12,13 and pharmaceutical14 processes."
[3] "To develop new NSAs for such processes, we use periodic, self-consistent density functional theory calculations that have shown considerable predictive power for catalysis20."
[4] "We find, however, that selected NSAs offer an exciting exception to this rule by simultaneously allowing weak H binding and low H2 dissociation barriers."
[5] "The lowering of the transition-state energy is observed even on non-ideal NSAs although the effect is less pronounced."
[6] "Accordingly, NSAs promise high hydrogenation activity at low temperatures."
[7] "This new class of near-surface alloys could thus assist in highly selective hydrogenation reactions at low temperatures, of particular interest for the production of chiral pharmaceutical compounds, and could, potentially, permit easier separation and storage of hydrogen."

1.The stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems such as Pt-3d alloys, are influenced by thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions. Some near-surface alloys (NSAs) bind atomic hydrogen as weakly as noble metals while dissociating H2 more easily, which is beneficial for hydrogen-related reactions. Hydrogen chemistry on NSAs is crucial for many chemical and pharmaceutical processes. Density functional theory calculations are used to develop new NSAs for these processes. Selected NSAs allow weak hydrogen binding and low H2 dissociation barriers, which is an exception to the general rule. The lowering of the transition-state energy is observed even on non-ideal NSAs, although the effect is less pronounced. NSAs promise high hydrogenation activity at low temperatures, which is beneficial for the production of chiral pharmaceutical compounds and could potentially permit easier separation and storage of hydrogen.

1.双金属催化剂的稳定性、表面分层和结构配置，特别是在基于Pt的系统如Pt-3d合金中，受到热力学偏好和反应条件的影响。一些近表面合金(NSAs)像贵金属一样弱地结合原子氢，同时更容易分解H2，这对氢相关的反应是有益的。NSAs上的氢化学对许多化学和制药过程至关重要。使用密度泛函理论计算来为这些过程开发新的NSAs。选定的NSAs允许弱的氢结合和低的H2解离势垒，这是对一般规则的例外。即使在非理想的NSAs上，过渡态能量的降低也被观察到，尽管效果不那么明显。NSAs在低温下承诺高氢化活性，这对生产手性药物化合物有利，而且可能允许更容易分离和储存氢。
