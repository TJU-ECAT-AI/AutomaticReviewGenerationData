          [1] "Some of these NSAs bind atomic hydrogen (H) as weakly as the noble metals (Cu, Au) while, at the same time, dissociating H2 much more easily."
          [2] "Hydrogen chemistry on NSAs is of particular interest, as this element has so important a role in many chemical12,13 and pharmaceutical14 processes."
          [3] "The stability can be assessed using a simple, two-step procedure, first considering the composition in vacuum, and then accounting for the effects of hydrogen adsorption."
          [4] "In general, adsorbates can draw to the surface components of alloys to which they bind strongly."
          [5] "We find that a reliable estimate of the tendency of hydrogen to induce surface segregation can be made by comparing Eseg of the solute to the difference in the magnitudes of the hydrogen binding energies between the pure solute and the pure host (BEHsol  BEHhost, where BEH is the energy change when atomic hydrogen is adsorbed from the gas phase onto the metal surface)."
          [6] "In the upper right and lower left quadrants, the parity line divides segregating from non-segregating regions."
          [7] "We have confirmed that this simple technique reliably predicts segregation behaviour in the presence of hydrogen, although there may be exceptions in cases where Eseg and BEHsol  BEHhost are within 0.1 eV of one another."
          [8] "In general, Fig. 1 suggests that hydrogen will not induce surface segregation for most solute/host transition metal pairs, at least at low temperatures and pressures."
          [9] "The range of BEs of oxygen, sulphur and CO across the pure transition metals is larger than is the corresponding range for hydrogen (the range of BE between Au and Ru, for example, is 0.75 eV for H, 1.87 eV for CO, 2.25 eV for S and 2.70 eV for O), so these species will generally have larger thermodynamic driving forces for adsorbate-induced segregation."
          [10] "Real NSAs may, nonetheless, differ in certain ways from our idealized NSA models."
          [11] "In some cases, a portion of the solute in a subsurface alloy may segregate more deeply into the host."
          [12] "In other cases, the total coverage of solute in the surface region may differ from one monolayer, leading to different types of subsurface alloy structures26."
          [13] "In still other situations, arrangements of atoms with unusual periodicity (or even no periodicity at all) may permit the formation of defects or long-range reconstructions27,28."
          [14] "We have found that these possible deviations from our idealized NSA structures do not substantially affect the main trends in adsorbate behaviour presented below."
          [15] "However, the deviations from the idealized cases do have a quantitative effect on the properties of adsorbates on these NSAs."
          [16] "Thus, to benefit fully from the unique catalytic properties of NSAs, more precise control of metal catalyst surface structure will be needed, perhaps through improved nanofabrication techniques."
          [17] "Recent innovations in atomic layer deposition and in nanoparticle fabrication technologies for metals suggest that practical nanofabrication strategies for metals may not be far off29,30,31."
          [18] "Some of these NSAs bind atomic hydrogen (H) as weakly as the noble metals (Cu, Au) while, at the same time, dissociating H2 much more easily."
          [19] "Hydrogen chemistry on NSAs is of particular interest, as this element has so important a role in many chemical12,13 and pharmaceutical14 processes."
          [20] "To develop new NSAs for such processes, we use periodic, self-consistent density functional theory calculations that have shown considerable predictive power for catalysis20."
          [21] "We find, however, that selected NSAs offer an exciting exception to this rule by simultaneously allowing weak H binding and low H2 dissociation barriers."
          [22] "The lowering of the transition-state energy is observed even on non-ideal NSAs although the effect is less pronounced."
          [23] "Accordingly, NSAs promise high hydrogenation activity at low temperatures."
          [24] "This new class of near-surface alloys could thus assist in highly selective hydrogenation reactions at low temperatures, of particular interest for the production of chiral pharmaceutical compounds, and could, potentially, permit easier separation and storage of hydrogen."
          [25] "The stability can be assessed using a simple, two-step procedure, first considering the composition in vacuum, and then accounting for the effects of hydrogen adsorption."
          [26] "In general, adsorbates can draw to the surface components of alloys to which they bind strongly."
          [27] "We have found that a reliable estimate of the tendency of hydrogen to induce surface segregation can be made by comparing Eseg of the solute to the difference in the magnitudes of the hydrogen binding energies between the pure solute and the pure host (BEHsol  BEHhost, where BEH is the energy change when atomic hydrogen is adsorbed from the gas phase onto the metal surface; see Fig. 1)."
          [28] "Real NSAs may, nonetheless, differ in certain ways from our idealized NSA models."
          [29] "We have found that these possible deviations from our idealized NSA structures do not substantially affect the main trends in adsorbate behaviour presented below (some experimental studies have already shown significantly modified catalytic activity, along the lines of our theoretical predictions, even on non-ideal NSAs10,11)."

          The stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems such as Pt-3d alloys, are influenced by thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions. Some near-surface alloys (NSAs) bind atomic hydrogen as weakly as noble metals while dissociating H2 more easily, which is beneficial for hydrogen-related reactions. Hydrogen chemistry on NSAs is crucial for many chemical and pharmaceutical processes. Density functional theory calculations are used to develop new NSAs for these processes. Selected NSAs allow weak hydrogen binding and low H2 dissociation barriers, which is an exception to the general rule. The lowering of the transition-state energy is observed even on non-ideal NSAs, although the effect is less pronounced. NSAs promise high hydrogenation activity at low temperatures, which is beneficial for the production of chiral pharmaceutical compounds and could potentially permit easier separation and storage of hydrogen. The stability of near-surface alloys (NSAs) can be assessed using a two-step procedure: first, considering the composition in vacuum, and then accounting for the effects of hydrogen adsorption. Adsorbates can draw to the surface components of alloys to which they bind strongly. The tendency of hydrogen to induce surface segregation can be estimated by comparing the segregation energy (Eseg) of the solute to the difference in the magnitudes of the hydrogen binding energies between the pure solute and the pure host. Real NSAs may differ from idealized models, but these deviations do not substantially affect the main trends in adsorbate behavior. Some experimental studies have shown significantly modified catalytic activity on non-ideal NSAs, in line with theoretical predictions.

          双金属催化剂的稳定性、表面分层和结构配置，特别是在基于Pt的系统如Pt-3d合金中，受到热力学偏好和反应条件的影响。一些近表面合金(NSAs)像贵金属一样弱地结合原子氢，同时更容易分解H2，这对氢相关的反应是有益的。NSAs上的氢化学对许多化学和制药过程至关重要。使用密度泛函理论计算来为这些过程开发新的NSAs。选定的NSAs允许弱的氢结合和低的H2解离势垒，这是对一般规则的例外。即使在非理想的NSAs上，过渡态能量的降低也被观察到，尽管效果不那么明显。NSAs在低温下承诺高氢化活性，这对生产手性药物化合物有利，而且可能允许更容易分离和储存氢。近表面合金（NSA）的稳定性可以通过两步程序进行评估：首先，考虑真空中的组成，然后考虑氢吸附的影响。吸附物可以将合金中与其强烈结合的成分吸引到表面。氢诱导表面分层的倾向可以通过比较溶质的分层能（Eseg）与纯溶质和纯基体之间氢结合能差值来估计。实际的NSA可能与理想模型有所不同，但这些偏差不会对吸附物行为的主要趋势产生实质性影响。一些实验研究已经表明，在非理想的NSA上，催化活性有显著的改变，这与理论预测一致。
