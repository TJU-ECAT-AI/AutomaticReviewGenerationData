[1] "Some of these NSAs bind atomic hydrogen (H) as weakly as the noble metals (Cu, Au) while, at the same time, dissociating H2 much more easily."
[2] "To develop new NSAs for such processes, we use periodic, self-consistent density functional theory calculations that have shown considerable predictive power for catalysis."
[3] "We find, however, that selected NSAs offer an exciting exception to this rule by simultaneously allowing weak H binding and low H2 dissociation barriers."
[4] "The lowering of the transition-state energy is observed even on non-ideal NSAs although the effect is less pronounced."
[5] "Near-surface alloys, however, escape from that rule by offering the exciting combination of weak hydrogen binding and easy H2 activation."
[6] "Accordingly, NSAs promise high hydrogenation activity at low temperatures."
[7] "This new class of near-surface alloys could thus assist in highly selective hydrogenation reactions at low temperatures, of particular interest for the production of chiral pharmaceutical compounds, and could, potentially, permit easier separation and storage of hydrogen."

1.The stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems such as Pt-3d alloys, are influenced by thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions. Near-surface alloys (NSAs) can bind atomic hydrogen as weakly as noble metals while dissociating H2 more easily. These NSAs can offer low H2 dissociation barriers while allowing weak hydrogen binding, which is an exception to the general rule. The lowering of the transition-state energy is observed even on non-ideal NSAs, although the effect is less pronounced. NSAs promise high hydrogenation activity at low temperatures, which can assist in highly selective hydrogenation reactions, particularly for the production of chiral pharmaceutical compounds, and potentially permit easier separation and storage of hydrogen.

1.双金属催化剂的稳定性、表面分层和结构配置，特别是在基于Pt的系统如Pt-3d合金中，受到热力学偏好和反应条件的影响。近表面合金（NSAs）可以像贵金属一样弱地结合原子氢，同时更容易分解H2。这些NSAs可以提供低的H2解离能垒，同时允许弱的氢结合，这是对一般规则的例外。即使在非理想的NSAs上，也能观察到过渡态能的降低，尽管效果不那么明显。NSAs在低温下承诺有高氢化活性，这可以协助高度选择性的氢化反应，特别是用于手性药物化合物的生产，并可能允许更容易的氢气分离和储存。
