[1] "Compared with monometallic catalysts, bimetallic catalysts have more surface structural complexity, where the second metalin either the metallic or the oxidized statecan be exposed on the surface,in the near surface region, or embedded in bulk region. It has been demonstrated that the surface structure of the bimetallic catalyst is critical to their catalytic properties."
[2] "For example, Pt- based bimetallic catalysts consisting of Pt-skin surfaces with 3d transition metals at the subsurface region present super catalytic performances in many reactions compared to the pure Pt surface."
[3] "The structure of a catalyst surface often changes dynamically during reactions. For example, reversible surface processes such as wettingdewetting and sintering dispersion have been observed in monometallic catalyst sys- tems when the gaseous environment changes between reduc- tive and oxidative conditions."
[4] "The bimetallic catalysts may show similar dependence of surface structure on the redox po- tential of reaction gases, which offers eventually the opportu- nity to tune the catalytic activity and selectivity."

1.The surface structure of bimetallic catalysts, including the presence of the second metal in metallic or oxidized states on the surface, near the surface, or in the bulk, is critical to their catalytic properties. Pt-based bimetallic catalysts with Pt-skin surfaces and 3d transition metals in the subsurface region exhibit superior catalytic performance compared to pure Pt surfaces. The structure of the catalyst surface can change dynamically during reactions, influenced by the redox potential of the reaction gases. This dynamic change offers the opportunity to tune the catalytic activity and selectivity of bimetallic catalysts.

1.双金属催化剂的表面结构，包括第二金属以金属或氧化态存在于表面、近表面或体相中，对其催化性能至关重要。基于Pt的双金属催化剂，具有Pt表面层和3d过渡金属在次表面区域，与纯Pt表面相比，表现出优异的催化性能。催化剂表面结构在反应过程中可动态变化，受反应气体的氧化还原电位影响。这种动态变化为调节双金属催化剂的催化活性和选择性提供了机会。
