          [1] "Compared with monometallic catalysts, bimetallic catalysts have more surface structural complexity, where the second metalin either the metallic or the oxidized statecan be exposed on the surface,in the near surface region, or embedded in bulk region. It has been demonstrated that the surface structure of the bimetallic catalyst is critical to their catalytic properties."
          [2] "For example, Pt- based bimetallic catalysts consisting of Pt-skin surfaces with 3d transition metals at the subsurface region present super catalytic performances in many reactions compared to the pure Pt surface."
          [3] "The structure of a catalyst surface often changes dynamically during reactions. For example, reversible surface processes such as wettingdewetting and sintering dispersion have been observed in monometallic catalyst sys- tems when the gaseous environment changes between reduc- tive and oxidative conditions."
          [4] "The bimetallic catalysts may show similar dependence of surface structure on the redox po- tential of reaction gases, which offers eventually the opportu- nity to tune the catalytic activity and selectivity."

          The thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions significantly influence the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems such as Pt-3d alloys. Bimetallic catalysts exhibit greater surface structural complexity compared to monometallic catalysts, with the second metal, in either its metallic or oxidized state, being present on the surface, in the near-surface region, or embedded in the bulk region. The surface structure of bimetallic catalysts is crucial to their catalytic properties. For instance, Pt-based bimetallic catalysts with Pt-skin surfaces and 3d transition metals in the subsurface region demonstrate superior catalytic performance in many reactions compared to pure Pt surfaces. The structure of the catalyst surface often changes dynamically during reactions, similar to reversible surface processes observed in monometallic catalyst systems when the gaseous environment shifts between reductive and oxidative conditions. Bimetallic catalysts may exhibit a similar dependence of surface structure on the redox potential of reaction gases, providing an opportunity to adjust catalytic activity and selectivity.

          热力学偏好和反应条件对双金属催化剂的稳定性、表面分层和结构配置有重大影响，特别是在Pt基系统如Pt-3d合金中。与单金属催化剂相比，双金属催化剂具有更大的表面结构复杂性，其中第二金属，无论是金属态还是氧化态，都可以出现在表面、近表面区域或嵌入到体相中。双金属催化剂的表面结构对其催化性质至关重要。例如，具有Pt皮肤表面和3d过渡金属在次表面区域的Pt基双金属催化剂在许多反应中表现出比纯Pt表面更优异的催化性能。催化剂表面结构在反应过程中经常动态变化，类似于在单金属催化剂系统中观察到的可逆表面过程，当气体环境在还原和氧化条件之间变化时。双金属催化剂的表面结构可能也依赖于反应气体的氧化还原电位，这最终提供了调整催化活性和选择性的机会。
