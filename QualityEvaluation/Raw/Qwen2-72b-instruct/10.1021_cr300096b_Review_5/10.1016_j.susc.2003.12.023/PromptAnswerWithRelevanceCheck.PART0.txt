1.The literature does not provide specific information on how thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions influence the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems such as Pt-3d alloys, and what are the consequent implications for their catalytic properties and performance in various applications. However, it does discuss the growth of silver on a Pt(1 0 0) surface and the evolution of the structure with increasing temperature, which can be related to the stability and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts. At room temperature, the formation of elongated 2D-adislands with a composition of Ag80Pt20 was observed. Annealing of the sample above 600 K causes more extensive alloying starting at the perimeter of the Ag adislands by AgPt exchange and formation of a nanophasic AgPt alloy confined to the surface layer. This can affect the catalytic properties and performance of the bimetallic catalyst.

1.文献没有提供具体信息说明热力学偏好和反应条件如何影响双金属催化剂的稳定性、表面分层和结构配置，特别是在Pt基系统如Pt-3d合金中，以及这对它们在各种应用中的催化特性和性能有何影响。但是，它确实讨论了银在Pt(1 0 0)表面上的生长以及随着温度升高结构的演变，这可以与双金属催化剂的稳定性和结构配置相关。在室温下，观察到形成拉长的2D-adislands，其组成比例为Ag80Pt20。将样品加热至600 K以上会导致Ag adislands周边开始更广泛的合金化，通过AgPt交换形成限制在表面层的纳米相AgPt合金。这可能会影响双金属催化剂的催化特性和性能。

With sufficient Ag, this alloy spreads across the surface until a uniform stoichiometry is established over the entire surface. Temperature-dependent AES studies indicate that there is some mixing of Ag with bulk Pt at elevated temperatures. These findings suggest that the thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions can influence the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, which in turn can affect their catalytic properties and performance in various applications.

1.文献没有提供关于热力学偏好和反应条件如何影响双金属催化剂的稳定性、表面分层和结构配置，特别是在Pt基系统如Pt-3d合金中，以及这对它们在各种应用中的催化特性和性能的后果的具体信息。然而，它确实讨论了银在Pt(1 0 0)表面上的生长以及随着温度升高结构的演变，这可以与双金属催化剂的稳定性和结构配置相关。在室温下，观察到组成比例为Ag80Pt20的拉长的2D-adislands。将样品加热至600 K以上会导致AgPt交换开始在Ag adislands的边缘形成更广泛的合金化和形成限制在表面层的纳米相AgPt合金。随着足够的Ag，这种合金会扩散到整个表面，直到整个表面建立均匀的组成比例。温度依赖的AES研究表明，在较高温度下，Ag与体Pt存在一定程度的混合。这些发现表明，热力学偏好和反应条件可以影响双金属催化剂的稳定性、表面分层和结构配置，这反过来又可以影响它们在各种应用中的催化特性和性能。
