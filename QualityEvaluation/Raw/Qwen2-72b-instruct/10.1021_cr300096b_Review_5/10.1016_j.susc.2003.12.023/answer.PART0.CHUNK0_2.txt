1.The literature does not provide specific information on how thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions influence the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems such as Pt-3d alloys, and the consequent implications for their catalytic properties and performance in various applications. However, it does discuss the growth of silver on a Pt(1 0 0) surface and the evolution of the structure with increasing temperature, which can be related to the broader topic of bimetallic catalysts. At room temperature, the formation of elongated 2D-adislands with a composition of Ag80Pt20 was observed. Annealing of the sample above 600 K causes more extensive alloying starting at the perimeter of the Ag adislands by AgPt exchange and formation of a nanophasic AgPt alloy confined to the surface layer. This suggests that temperature can influence the structural configuration and stability of bimetallic catalysts, which in turn can affect their catalytic properties and performance.

1.文献没有提供具体信息说明热力学偏好和反应条件如何影响双金属催化剂的稳定性、表面分层和结构配置,特别是在Pt-3d合金等Pt基系统中,以及这对它们在各种应用中的催化特性和性能的后续影响。但是,它确实讨论了银在Pt(1 0 0)表面上的生长以及随着温度升高结构的演变,这可以与双金属催化剂的更广泛主题相关联。在室温下,观察到形成拉长的2D-adislands,其组成比例为Ag80Pt20。将样品加热至600 K以上会导致从Ag adislands的边缘开始更广泛的合金化,通过AgPt交换形成并限制在表面层的纳米相AgPt合金。这表明温度可以影响双金属催化剂的结构配置和稳定性,这反过来又会影响它们的催化特性和性能。
