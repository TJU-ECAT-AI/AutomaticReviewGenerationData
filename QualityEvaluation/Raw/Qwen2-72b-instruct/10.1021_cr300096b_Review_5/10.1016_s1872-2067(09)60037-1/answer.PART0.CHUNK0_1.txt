1.The thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions significantly influence the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems such as Pt-3d alloys. The stability of the Pt-skin structure can be reduced under certain circumstances, such as an oxidative environment, leading to gas-induced Fe surface segregation. The structural configuration of the catalyst can be transformed between surface Fe or FeO and subsurface Fe on the Pt(111) surface by cycles of oxidation and reduction. These transformations have implications for the catalytic properties and performance of the catalysts in various applications, including oxygen reduction reactions, hydrogenation of unsaturated hydrocarbons, and the preferential oxidation of CO in excess H2.

1.热力学偏好和反应条件对双金属催化剂的稳定性、表面分层和结构配置有重大影响，特别是在Pt基系统如Pt-3d合金中。Pt皮肤结构的稳定性在某些情况下可能会降低，例如在氧化环境中，这会导致气体诱导的Fe表面分层。通过氧化还原循环，催化剂的结构配置可以在Pt(111)表面的表面Fe或FeO与子表面Fe之间转换。这些转换对催化剂在各种应用中的催化特性和性能有影响，包括氧还原反应、不饱和烃的氢化以及过量H2中CO的优先氧化。
