          The stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems such as Pt-3d alloys, are influenced by thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions. Fe-Pt catalysts have been used in the preferential oxidation (PROX) of CO in excess H2, achieving high selectivity for CO oxidation. Pt-skin structures show high activity for catalyzing the hydrogenation of unsaturated hydrocarbons. The unique catalytic properties of the Pt-skin surfaces are attributed to the modification of the electronic structure of the surface Pt by the subsurface Fe underneath, influencing the adsorption and reaction characteristics of the surface species. The controlled preparation of various Fe-Pt surface structures allows for the derivation of the relationship between structure and catalytic properties, aiding in the design of high-performance and low-cost catalysts. The stability of the Pt-skin structure can be reduced under certain circumstances, such as an oxidative environment, leading to gas-induced Fe surface segregation. The structural configuration of the catalyst can be transformed between surface Fe or FeO and subsurface Fe on the Pt(111) surface by cycles of oxidation and reduction. These transformations have implications for the catalytic properties and performance of the catalysts in various applications, including oxygen reduction reactions, hydrogenation of unsaturated hydrocarbons, and the preferential oxidation of CO in excess H2. Depending on the preparation procedures and reaction conditions, Fe overlayers with either metallic or oxidized states may be present as the topmost surface or in the subsurface region of Pt. Different reactions can produce different Fe-Pt surface structural configurations. For oxygen reduction reactions (ORR), Pt-skin structures with Fe or some other transition metals in the subsurface regions showed a higher activity than pure Pt. For instance, Fe49Pt51 alloys with 100% Pt as the topmost layer had 25 times the activity of pure Pt catalysts in ORR. The optimization of the performance of Fe-Pt structures in magnetism and catalysis places a high demand on the design and control of the surface structural configurations and needs information on the stability of the various structures at elevated temperatures and under different reaction atmospheres.

          双金属催化剂的稳定性、表面分层和结构配置，特别是在Pt基系统如Pt-3d合金中，受到热力学偏好和反应条件的影响。Fe-Pt催化剂已被用于过量H2中CO的优先氧化(PROX)，实现了CO氧化的高选择性。Pt-皮肤结构在催化不饱和烃的氢化方面表现出高活性。Pt-皮肤表面独特的催化性能归因于表面Pt的电子结构由下面的Fe层修改，这影响了表面物种的吸附和反应特性。各种Fe-Pt表面结构的可控制备使我们能够推导出结构和催化性能之间的关系，有助于设计高性能和低成本的催化剂。Pt皮肤结构的稳定性在某些情况下可能会降低，例如在氧化环境中，这会导致气体诱导的Fe表面分层。通过氧化还原循环，催化剂的结构配置可以在Pt(111)表面的表面Fe或FeO与子表面Fe之间转换。这些转换对催化剂在各种应用中的催化特性和性能有影响，包括氧还原反应、不饱和烃的氢化以及过量H2中CO的优先氧化。根据制备程序和反应条件，Fe覆盖层可能以金属或氧化状态出现在Pt的最外层或次表面区域。不同的反应可以产生不同的Fe-Pt表面结构配置。对于氧还原反应(ORR)，次表面区域含有Fe或其他过渡金属的Pt-皮肤结构显示出比纯Pt更高的活性。例如，Fe49Pt51合金中100%的Pt作为最外层，其在ORR中的活性是纯Pt催化剂的25倍。为了在磁性和催化中优化Fe-Pt结构的性能，对表面结构配置的设计和控制提出了高要求，需要了解在高温和不同反应气氛下各种结构的稳定性信息。
