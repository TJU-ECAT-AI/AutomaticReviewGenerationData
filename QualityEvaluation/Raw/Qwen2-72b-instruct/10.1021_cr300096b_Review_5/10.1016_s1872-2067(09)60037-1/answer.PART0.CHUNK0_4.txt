1.The stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems such as Pt-3d alloys, are influenced by thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions. For example, Fe-Pt catalysts have been used in the preferential oxidation (PROX) of CO in excess H2, showing a high selectivity of approximately 100% for CO oxidation. The Pt-skin structures also showed high activity for catalyzing the hydrogenation of unsaturated hydrocarbons. The unique catalytic properties of the Pt-skin surfaces are attributed to the modification of the electronic structure of the surface Pt by the subsurface Fe underneath, which influences the adsorption and reaction characteristics of the surface species. The controlled preparation of various Fe-Pt surface structures enables the derivation of the relationship between structure and catalytic properties, which helps in the design of high-performance and low-cost catalysts.

1.双金属催化剂的稳定性、表面分层和结构配置，特别是在Pt基系统如Pt-3d合金中，受到热力学偏好和反应条件的影响。例如，Fe-Pt催化剂已被用于过量H2中CO的优先氧化(PROX)，显示出对CO氧化的高选择性，约为100%。Pt-皮肤结构也显示出催化不饱和烃氢化的高活性。Pt-皮肤表面独特的催化性能归因于表面Pt的电子结构由下面的Fe子层修改，这影响了表面物种的吸附和反应特性。各种Fe-Pt表面结构的受控制备使我们能够推导出结构和催化性能之间的关系，这有助于设计高性能和低成本的催化剂。
