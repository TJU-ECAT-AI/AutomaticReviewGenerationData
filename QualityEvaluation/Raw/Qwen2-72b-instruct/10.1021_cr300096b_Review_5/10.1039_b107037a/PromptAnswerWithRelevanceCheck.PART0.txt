[1] "The formation of a Pt skin layer with predominantly (111)-oriented facets induced by dissolution of Fe atoms in a PtFe alloy for fuel cell applications is investigated for the first time by using in situ electrochemical STM in 0.1 M HClO4 solution."
[2] "While electrochemical and other surface analysis techniques such as XPS, AES and EXAFS have been extensively used in the study of thin solid films, the information obtained from these methods is esssentially macroscopic and does not provide direct atomic-scale models for the film structures."
[3] "On the other hand, scanning tunnelling microscopy (STM) is a powerful technique to obtain atomic resolution images in UHV and also electrolyte solutions."
[4] "The small peak at 0.71 V indicated by an arrow is assigned to the Fe2+/Fe3+ redox process.13 However, the peak decreased with each additional potential cycle and finally disappeared, resulting in a steady CV. This result shows that the potential cycles lead to increased dissolution of Fe and the rearrangement of Pt at the surface and formation of a Pt skin layer, protecting the underlying PtFe alloy from corrosion."
[5] "The present result will shed new insight for electrode material study in fuel cells. Further studies on the Pt skin layer formed on the PtFe alloy electrode, such as the adsorption and oxidation of CO, are now in progress by using STM from the viewpoint of electrocatalysis."

1.The thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions influence the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems such as Pt-3d alloys, by inducing the dissolution of less noble metals like Fe and the rearrangement of Pt atoms at the surface. This process leads to the formation of a Pt skin layer with predominantly (111)-oriented facets, which protects the underlying alloy from corrosion. The use of scanning tunnelling microscopy (STM) in electrolyte solutions provides atomic-scale models for the film structures, offering insights into the microstructure of the catalysts. This understanding has implications for the catalytic properties and performance of these materials in fuel cell applications, as it relates to the adsorption and oxidation of CO.

1.热力学偏好和反应条件通过诱导较不贵重的金属如Fe的溶解和表面Pt原子的重排，影响双金属催化剂，特别是Pt基系统如Pt-3d合金的稳定性，表面分层和结构配置。这一过程导致形成主要为(111)取向面的Pt皮肤层，保护底层合金免受腐蚀。在电解质溶液中使用扫描隧道显微镜（STM）提供了薄膜结构的原子尺度模型，为催化剂的微观结构提供了见解。这种理解对这些材料在燃料电池应用中的催化特性和性能有影响，因为它与CO的吸附和氧化有关。

The dissolution of Fe atoms in a PtFe alloy under specific conditions leads to the formation of a Pt skin layer with predominantly (111)-oriented facets. This process is investigated using in situ electrochemical scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) in a 0.1 M HClO4 solution. The potential cycles applied to the PtFe film result in increased dissolution of Fe and the rearrangement of Pt at the surface, forming a protective Pt skin layer.
