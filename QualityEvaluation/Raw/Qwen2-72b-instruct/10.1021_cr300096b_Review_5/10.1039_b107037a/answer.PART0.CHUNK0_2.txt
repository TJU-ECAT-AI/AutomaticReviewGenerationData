[1] "The formation of a Pt skin layer with predominantly (111)-oriented facets induced by dissolution of Fe atoms in a PtFe alloy for fuel cell applications is investigated for the first time by using in situ electrochemical STM in 0.1 M HClO4 solution."
[2] "While electrochemical and other surface analysis techniques such as XPS, AES and EXAFS have been extensively used in the study of thin solid films, the information obtained from these methods is esssentially macroscopic and does not provide direct atomic-scale models for the film structures."
[3] "In this paper, we report an in situ STM study of a PtFe film in 0.1 M HClO4 solution."
[4] "The small peak at 0.71 V indicated by an arrow is assigned to the Fe2+/Fe3+ redox process.13 However, the peak decreased with each additional potential cycle and finally disappeared, resulting in a steady CV. This result shows that the potential cycles lead to increased dissolution of Fe and the rearrangement of Pt at the surface and formation of a Pt skin layer, protecting the underlying PtFe alloy from corrosion."
[5] "The present result will shed new insight for electrode material study in fuel cells. Further studies on the Pt skin layer formed on the PtFe alloy electrode, such as the adsorption and oxidation of CO, are now in progress by using STM from the viewpoint of electrocatalysis."

1.The stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems such as Pt-3d alloys, are influenced by thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions. The dissolution of Fe atoms in a PtFe alloy under specific conditions leads to the formation of a Pt skin layer with predominantly (111)-oriented facets. This process is investigated using in situ electrochemical scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) in a 0.1 M HClO4 solution. The potential cycles applied to the PtFe film result in increased dissolution of Fe and the rearrangement of Pt at the surface, forming a protective Pt skin layer. This layer protects the underlying PtFe alloy from corrosion, which has implications for the catalytic properties and performance of the alloy in fuel cell applications. Further studies on the Pt skin layer, such as the adsorption and oxidation of CO, are being conducted to better understand its electrocatalytic behavior.

1.双金属催化剂的稳定性、表面分层和结构配置，特别是在Pt基系统如Pt-3d合金中，受到热力学偏好和反应条件的影响。在特定条件下，PtFe合金中Fe原子的溶解导致形成以(111)取向为主的Pt皮肤层。这一过程使用原位电化学扫描隧道显微镜（STM）在0.1 M HClO4溶液中进行研究。对PtFe薄膜施加的电位循环导致Fe的溶解增加和Pt在表面的重新排列，形成保护性的Pt皮肤层。这层保护了底层的PtFe合金免受腐蚀，这对合金在燃料电池应用中的催化特性和性能有影响。关于Pt皮肤层的进一步研究，如CO的吸附和氧化，正在进行中，以更好地理解其电催化行为。
