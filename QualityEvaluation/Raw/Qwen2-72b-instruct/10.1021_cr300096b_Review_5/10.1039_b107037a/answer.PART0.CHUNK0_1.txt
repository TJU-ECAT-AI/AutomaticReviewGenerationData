[1] "The formation of a Pt skin layer with predominantly (111)-oriented facets induced by dissolution of Fe atoms in a PtFe alloy for fuel cell applications is investigated for the first time by using in situ electrochemical STM in 0.1 M HClO4 solution."
[2] "While electrochemical and other surface analysis techniques such as XPS, AES and EXAFS have been extensively used in the study of thin solid films, the information obtained from these methods is esssentially macroscopic and does not provide direct atomic-scale models for the film structures."
[3] "In this paper, we report an in situ STM study of a PtFe film in 0.1 M HClO4 solution."
[4] "The small peak at 0.71 V indicated by an arrow is assigned to the Fe2+/Fe3+ redox process.13 However, the peak decreased with each additional potential cycle and finally disappeared, resulting in a steady CV. This result shows that the potential cycles lead to increased dissolution of Fe and the rearrangement of Pt at the surface and formation of a Pt skin layer, protecting the underlying PtFe alloy from corrosion."
[5] "The present result will shed new insight for electrode material study in fuel cells. Further studies on the Pt skin layer formed on the PtFe alloy electrode, such as the adsorption and oxidation of CO, are now in progress by using STM from the viewpoint of electrocatalysis."

1.The stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems such as Pt-3d alloys, are influenced by thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions. The dissolution of Fe atoms in a PtFe alloy for fuel cell applications leads to the formation of a Pt skin layer with predominantly (111)-oriented facets. This process is investigated using in situ electrochemical scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) in a 0.1 M HClO4 solution. The potential cycles lead to increased dissolution of Fe and the rearrangement of Pt at the surface, resulting in the formation of a Pt skin layer that protects the underlying PtFe alloy from corrosion. This study provides new insights into electrode material research for fuel cells, and further studies on the Pt skin layer, such as the adsorption and oxidation of CO, are ongoing using STM from the perspective of electrocatalysis.

1.双金属催化剂的稳定性、表面分层和结构配置，特别是在Pt基系统如Pt-3d合金中，受到热力学偏好和反应条件的影响。在用于燃料电池应用的PtFe合金中，Fe原子的溶解导致形成以(111)取向为主的Pt皮肤层。这一过程使用原位电化学扫描隧道显微镜(STM)在0.1 M HClO4溶液中进行研究。电位循环导致Fe的溶解增加和Pt在表面的重新排列，形成保护底层PtFe合金免受腐蚀的Pt皮肤层。这项研究为燃料电池的电极材料研究提供了新的见解，关于Pt皮肤层的进一步研究，如CO的吸附和氧化，正在使用STM从电催化的角度进行。
