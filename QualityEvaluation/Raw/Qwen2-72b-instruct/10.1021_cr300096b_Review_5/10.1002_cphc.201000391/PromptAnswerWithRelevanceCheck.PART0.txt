1.The literature does not provide specific information on how thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions influence the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems such as Pt-3d alloys, and the consequent implications for their catalytic properties and performance in various applications. However, it does discuss the effects of annealing temperature on the structural and chemical properties of bimetallic PtRu/Ru(0001) surfaces, which can be related to the broader question. The study shows that annealing leads to changes in the surface morphology from Pt islands on the Ru substrate to a PtRu/Ru(0001) surface alloy, which significantly alters the adsorption properties of the surface. This can be attributed to changes in the composition of the adsorption ensembles and electronic interactions between the metallic constituents upon alloy formation. These changes have implications for the catalytic properties of the surface, as they can affect the activity and selectivity of the catalyst.

1.文献没有提供关于热力学偏好和反应条件如何影响双金属催化剂的稳定性、表面分层和结构配置的具体信息，特别是在Pt基系统如Pt-3d合金中，以及这对它们在各种应用中的催化特性和性能的后续影响。然而，它确实讨论了退火温度对双金属PtRu/Ru(0001)表面的结构和化学性质的影响，这可以与更广泛的问题相关联。研究显示，退火导致表面形态从Ru基底上的Pt岛变为PtRu/Ru(0001)表面合金，这显著改变了表面的吸附性质。这可以归因于合金形成时吸附集合体组成的改变和金属组分之间的电子相互作用的变化。这些变化对表面的催化性质有影响，因为它们可能影响催化剂的活性和选择性。

However, it does discuss the structural and chemical properties of bimetallic PtRu/Ru(0001) model catalysts and their modification upon stepwise annealing of a submonolayer Pt-covered Ru(0001) surface up to the formation of an equilibrated PtxRu1-x/Ru(0001) monolayer surface alloy. The study reveals that the surface structure significantly affects the adsorption properties of the bimetallic surface, which can be explained by changes in the composition of the adsorption ensembles (ensemble effects) for D adsorption and by changes in the electronic interaction (ligand effects, strain effects) of the metallic constituents for CO and D adsorption upon alloy formation.

The study shows that annealing leads to changes in the surface morphology from Pt islands on the Ru substrate to PtRu/Ru(0001) surface alloys, inducing significant changes in the adsorption properties of CO and deuterium. These changes can be attributed to ensemble effects for D adsorption and electronic interaction effects for CO and D adsorption upon alloy formation. The results demonstrate the sensitivity of probe molecule adsorption to the local structure and composition of a bimetallic surface, even for a combination of two chemically active metals such as Ru and Pt.
