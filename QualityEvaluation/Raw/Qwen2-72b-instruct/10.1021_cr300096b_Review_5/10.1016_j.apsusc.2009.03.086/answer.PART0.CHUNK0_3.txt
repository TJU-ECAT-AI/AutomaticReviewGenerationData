1.The surface structures of PtNi, PtCo, and PtCu bimetallic catalysts exhibit reversible changes in response to the redox potential of the environmental gas. These changes can be controlled by treating the catalysts in various gases. Surface segregation is a common phenomenon in bimetallic surfaces, where a metal with a larger atomic radius tends to segregate to the surface to release strain. Platinum, with its larger atomic radius compared to cobalt, nickel, and copper, is more likely to segregate to the surface. The presence of hydrogen does not alter the thermodynamic driving force for surface segregation. Oxygen adsorption on Pt-M catalyst surfaces can induce the segregation of 3d transition metals to the top surface due to the strong bonding between oxygen and 3d transition metals. In oxidative environments, 3d transition metals can become oxidized, and the formed oxides tend to encapsulate platinum surfaces. The mass transport processes that occur during oxidation or reduction reactions are fully reversible, depending on the redox potential of the reaction gases.

1. PtNi，PtCo和PtCu等双金属催化剂的表面结构在响应环境气体的氧化还原电位时表现出可逆变化。这些变化可以通过在各种气体中处理催化剂来控制。在双金属表面上，表面分层是一种常见现象，其中具有较大原子半径的金属倾向于分层到表面以释放应变。与钴，镍和铜相比，铂具有较大的原子半径，更可能分层到表面。氢的存在不会改变表面分层的热力学驱动力。在Pt-M催化剂表面上吸附氧气可以诱导3d过渡金属分层到顶部表面，这是由于氧气和3d过渡金属之间的强键合。在氧化环境中，3d过渡金属可能被氧化，形成的氧化物倾向于封装铂表面。在氧化或还原反应中发生的质量传递过程完全可逆，取决于反应气体的氧化还原电位。
