1.The surface structures of PtNi, PtCo, and PtCu bimetallic catalysts exhibit reversible changes in response to the redox potential of the environmental gas. The surface structure of bimetallic catalysts can be manipulated by treating them in various gases. Surface segregation is a common phenomenon observed in bimetallic surfaces, where under vacuum conditions, the metal with a larger atomic radius tends to segregate to the surface to release strain. The presence of hydrogen does not alter the thermodynamic driving force for surface segregation. Oxygen adsorption on Pt-based bimetallic catalyst surfaces can induce the segregation of 3d transition metals to the top surface due to the strong bonding between oxygen and 3d transition metals. In oxidative environments, 3d transition metals can become oxidized, and the formed oxides tend to encapsulate Pt surfaces due to their low surface energy. The reversible mass transport processes in response to changes between oxygen and hydrogen contribute to the oscillations in surface structure and composition at PtNi nanoparticle systems. Similar reversible dynamic behaviors have been observed in PtCu and PtCo nanoparticle catalysts.

1. PtNi、PtCo 和 PtCu 等双金属催化剂的表面结构在响应环境气体的氧化还原电位时表现出可逆变化。通过在各种气体中处理，可以操纵双金属催化剂的表面结构。在双金属表面上，表面分层是一种常见的现象，其中在真空条件下，具有较大原子半径的金属倾向于分层到表面以释放应变。氢气的存在不会改变表面分层的热力学驱动力。氧气在基于铂的双金属催化剂表面上的吸附可以诱导3d过渡金属向顶部表面的分层，这是由于氧气和3d过渡金属之间的强结合。在氧化环境中，3d过渡金属可以被氧化，形成的氧化物由于其低表面能而倾向于封装铂表面。在响应氧气和氢气变化的可逆质量传输过程中，PtNi纳米粒子系统的表面结构和组成出现振荡。在PtCu和PtCo纳米粒子催化剂中也观察到了类似的可逆动态行为。
