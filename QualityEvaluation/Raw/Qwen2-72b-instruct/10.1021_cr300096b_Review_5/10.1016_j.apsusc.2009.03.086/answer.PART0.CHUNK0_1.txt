[1] "A solid catalyst is a complex dynamic system, which may change its surface morphology, structure, and chemical composi- tion under reaction conditions [16]."
[2] "Compared to monometallic catalysts, the bimetallic catalysts present more structural complexity, where the two components could have various structural configurations."
[3] "For example, bimetallic nanoparticles could have the structures of alloy, coreshell, and linked monometallic nanoparticles [19]."
[4] "In bimetallic model systems consisting of one metal overlayers grown on another metal single crystal, the second metal can be on the topmost surface, in the subsurface region, or in the bulk of the first metal crystal [16]."
[5] "Furthermore, reaction gases and/or temperature effects could induce interdiffusion between the two components and even change chemical sate of the metals."

[14] "Due to the low surface energy of most oxides (<1 J/m2) [35 37], the formed 3d transition metal oxides tend to encapsulate Pt surfaces (surface energy of Pt: 1.95 J/m2 [38])."

1.The stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems such as Pt-3d alloys, are influenced by thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions. Bimetallic catalysts present more structural complexity than monometallic catalysts, with various structural configurations including alloy, core-shell, and linked monometallic nanoparticles. Reaction gases and temperature effects can induce interdiffusion between the two components and change the chemical state of the metals. Surface segregation of a metal with a larger atomic radius is preferred under vacuum conditions to release strain at the bimetallic surface. The presence of H2 does not change the thermodynamic driving force for surface segregation. Adsorption of oxygen on Pt-M catalyst surfaces can induce segregation of 3d transition metals onto the top surface due to strong bonding between oxygen and 3d transition metals. 3d transition metals may become oxidized in oxidative environments, and the formed 3d transition metal oxides tend to encapsulate Pt surfaces due to their low surface energy. The mass transport processes in oxidation or reduction reactions are fully reversible depending on the redox potential of the reaction gases. The reversible structure changes in Pt-based bimetallic catalyst systems are significant in many real catalytic processes.

1.在Pt基系统如Pt-3d合金中，特别是在双金属催化剂的稳定性，表面分层和结构配置受热力学偏好和反应条件的影响。与单金属催化剂相比，双金属催化剂呈现更多的结构复杂性，具有各种结构配置，包括合金，核心壳和连接的单金属纳米粒子。反应气体和温度效应可以诱导两个组件之间的互扩散并改变金属的化学状态。在真空条件下，具有较大原子半径的金属的表面分层是优选的，以释放双金属表面的应变。H2的存在不会改变表面分层的热力学驱动力。在Pt-M催化剂表面上吸附氧气可以由于氧气和3d过渡金属之间的强结合而诱导3d过渡金属到顶部表面的分层。3d过渡金属可能在氧化环境中氧化，形成的3d过渡金属氧化物由于其低表面能量而倾向于封装Pt表面。氧化或还原反应中的质量传输过程完全可逆，取决于反应气体的氧化还原电位。Pt基双金属催化剂系统中的可逆结构变化在许多实际催化过程中具有重要意义。
