1.The surface structures of PtNi, PtCo, and PtCu bimetallic catalysts exhibit reversible changes in response to the redox potential of the environmental gas. These changes can be tuned by treating the catalysts in various gases, demonstrating the dynamic nature of bimetallic catalyst surfaces. The reversible behavior is clearly shown by the oscillations in the ratio of Ni 2p to Pt 4f intensity during oxidation and reduction cycles. The reversible structural changes in Pt-based bimetallic catalysts have significant implications for real catalytic processes.
