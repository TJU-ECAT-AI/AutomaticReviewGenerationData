[7] "Moreover, the 3d transition metals may become oxidized in the oxidative environments."
[8] "Due to the low surface energy of most oxides (<1 J/m2), the formed 3d transition metal oxides tend to encapsulate Pt surfaces (surface energy of Pt: 1.95 J/m2)."

1.The surface structures of PtNi, PtCo, and PtCu bimetallic catalysts exhibit reversible changes in response to the redox potential of the environmental gas. The surface structure of bimetallic catalysts can be manipulated by treating them in various gases. Surface segregation is a common phenomenon observed in bimetallic surfaces, particularly under vacuum conditions, where a metal with a larger atomic radius tends to segregate to the surface to relieve strain. The presence of hydrogen does not alter the thermodynamic driving force for surface segregation. Oxygen adsorption on Pt-based bimetallic catalyst surfaces can induce the segregation of 3d transition metals to the top surface due to the strong bonding between oxygen and 3d transition metals. In oxidative environments, 3d transition metals can become oxidized, and the resulting oxides, with lower surface energy, tend to encapsulate Pt surfaces. The mass transport processes, including surface segregation and encapsulation, are fully reversible and depend on the redox potential of the reaction gases.

1. PtNi、PtCo 和 PtCu 等双金属催化剂的表面结构在响应环境气体的氧化还原电位时表现出可逆变化。通过在各种气体中处理，可以操纵双金属催化剂的表面结构。表面分层是在双金属表面上普遍观察到的现象，特别是在真空条件下，具有较大原子半径的金属倾向于分层到表面以释放双金属表面的应变。氢的存在不会改变表面分层过程的热力学驱动力。先前的理论和实验研究表明，氧气在Pt-M催化剂表面的吸附可以诱导3d过渡金属向表面顶部的分层，这是由于氧气和3d过渡金属之间强烈的结合。此外，在氧化环境中，3d过渡金属可能会被氧化。由于大多数氧化物的表面能较低（<1 J/m2），形成的3d过渡金属氧化物倾向于封装Pt表面（Pt的表面能：1.95 J/m2）。在氧化或还原反应中活跃的质量传递过程完全可逆，取决于反应气体的氧化还原电位。
