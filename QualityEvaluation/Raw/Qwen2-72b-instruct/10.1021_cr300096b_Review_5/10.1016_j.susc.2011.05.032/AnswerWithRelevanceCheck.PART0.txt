          The thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions can influence the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems such as Pt-3d alloys. The addition of a third transition metal element M can modify the driving energy for Pt segregation to the outermost layer of Pt3Ni (111) surface. Transition metals V, Fe, Co, Mo, Tc, Ru, W, Re, Os, and Ir were predicted to lead to even more negative Pt surface segregation energies than that in the based Pt3Ni (111) surface, further promoting Pt surface segregation. In contrast, doping transition metals Ag, Au, and Pd would lead to positive segregation energies and hence suppress the Pt surface segregation in the corresponding Pt3Ni/M (111) surface. The surface energy effect, strain effect, and heat of solution effect induced by the doped element M would collectively affect the Pt surface segregation energy in the Pt3Ni/M (111) surfaces. The extent of Pt surface segregation is determined by the relative Pt surface segregation energy, lattice mismatch, and heat of solution of the Pt3M crystal with respect to those of the Pt3Ni crystal. Replacing Ni with transition metals V, Fe, Co, Mo, Tc, Ru, W, Re, Os, and Ir would lead to even stronger Pt segregation extent to the surface while replacing Ni with transition metals Ag, Au, and Pd could completely prohibit Pt segregating to the surface.

          热力学偏好和反应条件可以影响双金属催化剂的稳定性、表面分层和结构配置，特别是在基于铂的系统中，如Pt-3d合金。添加第三过渡金属元素M可以改变Pt在Pt3Ni (111)表面外层分层的驱动力。预测过渡金属V、Fe、Co、Mo、Tc、Ru、W、Re、Os和Ir会导致比基于Pt3Ni (111)表面更负的Pt表面分层能，进一步促进Pt表面分层。相反，掺杂过渡金属Ag、Au和Pd会导致正的分层能，从而抑制Pt在相应的Pt3Ni/M (111)表面的分层。由掺杂元素M诱导的表面能量效应、应变效应和溶解热效应共同影响Pt3Ni/M (111)表面上的Pt表面分层能量。Pt表面分层的程度由相对Pt表面分层能量、Pt3M晶体与Pt3Ni晶体的晶格不匹配以及溶解热决定。用过渡金属V、Fe、Co、Mo、Tc、Ru、W、Re、Os和Ir取代Ni会导致Pt向表面的分层程度更强，而用过渡金属Ag、Au和Pd取代Ni则可能完全阻止Pt向表面分层。
