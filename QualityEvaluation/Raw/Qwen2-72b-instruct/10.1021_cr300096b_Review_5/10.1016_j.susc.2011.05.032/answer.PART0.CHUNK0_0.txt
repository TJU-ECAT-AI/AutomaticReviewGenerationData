1.The thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions can influence the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems such as Pt-3d alloys. For instance, the addition of a third transition metal element M (M is a 3d, 4d, or 5d transition metal) can modify the driving energy for Pt segregation to the outermost layer of Pt3Ni (111) surface. Transition metals V, Fe, Co, Mo, Tc, Ru, W, Re, Os, and Ir were predicted to lead to even more negative Pt surface segregation energies than that in the based Pt3Ni (111) surface, further promoting Pt surface segregation. In contrast, doping transition metals Ag, Au, and Pd would lead to positive segregation energies and hence suppress the Pt surface segregation in the corresponding Pt3Ni/M (111) surface. The consequent implications for their catalytic properties and performance in various applications include enhanced catalytic activity for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cells (PEMFC) when Pt atoms segregated to the outermost surfaces and formed a mono surface layer on these alloys.

1.热力学偏好和反应条件可以影响双金属催化剂的稳定性、表面分层和结构配置，特别是在基于铂的系统中，如Pt-3d合金。例如，添加第三过渡金属元素M（M是3d、4d或5d过渡金属）可以改变Pt在Pt3Ni (111)表面外层分层的驱动力。预测过渡金属V、Fe、Co、Mo、Tc、Ru、W、Re、Os和Ir会导致比基于Pt3Ni (111)表面更负的Pt表面分层能，进一步促进Pt表面分层。相反，掺杂过渡金属Ag、Au和Pd会导致正的分层能，从而抑制Pt在相应的Pt3Ni/M (111)表面的分层。这对它们在各种应用中的催化性能和表现的后续影响包括当Pt原子分层到最外层表面并在这些合金上形成单层表面时，聚合物电解质膜燃料电池（PEMFC）中氧还原反应（ORR）的催化活性增强。
