1.The thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions influence the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems such as Pt-3d alloys, by affecting the driving forces for surface segregation. The surface energy effect, strain effect, and heat of solution effect induced by the doped element M would collectively affect the Pt surface segregation energy in the Pt3Ni/M (111) surfaces. These effects determine whether the doped transition metal M would promote or suppress the Pt segregation to the outermost layer of the Pt3Ni/M (111) surface. Consequently, the consequent implications for their catalytic properties and performance in various applications are that the extent of Pt surface segregation can be tuned by doping a third transition metal element, which can lead to enhanced catalytic activity for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in fuel cell applications.

1.热力学偏好和反应条件通过影响表面分层的驱动力，影响了双金属催化剂，特别是基于Pt的系统，如Pt-3d合金的稳定性，表面分层和结构配置。由掺杂元素M诱导的表面能量效应，应变效应和溶液热效应将共同影响Pt3Ni/M (111)表面上的Pt表面分层能量。这些效应决定了掺杂的过渡金属M是否会促进或抑制Pt向Pt3Ni/M (111)表面最外层的分层。因此，对于它们在各种应用中的催化特性和性能的影响是，通过掺杂第三过渡金属元素，可以调节Pt表面分层的程度，这可以导致在燃料电池应用中对氧还原反应(ORR)的催化活性增强。
