1.The thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions influence the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems such as Pt-3d alloys, by affecting the driving forces for surface segregation. The surface energy effect, strain effect, and heat of solution effect induced by the doped element M collectively affect the Pt surface segregation energy in the Pt3Ni/M (111) surfaces. The extent of Pt surface segregation is determined by the relative Pt surface segregation energy, lattice mismatch, and heat of solution of the Pt3M crystal with respect to those of the Pt3Ni crystal. These factors determine the stability and structural configuration of the bimetallic catalysts, which in turn affect their catalytic properties and performance in various applications.

1.热力学偏好和反应条件通过影响表面分层的驱动力，影响了双金属催化剂，特别是基于Pt的系统，如Pt-3d合金的稳定性、表面分层和结构配置。由掺杂元素M诱导的表面能量效应、应变效应和溶解热效应共同影响Pt3Ni/M (111)表面的Pt表面分层能量。Pt表面分层的程度由相对Pt表面分层能量、Pt3M晶体与Pt3Ni晶体的晶格不匹配以及溶解热决定。这些因素决定了双金属催化剂的稳定性和结构配置，反过来又影响了它们在各种应用中的催化性能和性能。
