Read the questions and answers provided below. First, critically assess the overall relevance of the answers provided to the set of questions asked.

If, upon your assessment, you find that the answers do not contain information that is relevant to the questions asked, stop your review process immediately and respond with a single sentence: "※※※※※※※The provided answers are not relevant to the questions.※※※※※※※". Do not provide any additional explanation or background information, only this sentence should be given as a response in case of irrelevant answers.

If, however, the answers are relevant to the questions asked, proceed to compile answers for each question according to the instructions below. Ensure to aggregate all the relevant answers from the multiple answer results provided in the document, and organize them sequentially by their order number, compiling the corresponding quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question.

If the provided answers' quotes are not differentiated by question, ensure to break them down and assign the quotes to each respective question, outputting them separately within each question's section.

To provide a comprehensive review, differentiate the responses into quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question based on the details given in the 'Answer' XML tags. Structure your review using the XML format showcased below if the answers are relevant to the questions asked:

[1] "Ternary alloys exhibit a strong Pt surface segregation tendency leading to the formation of a Pt monolayer (ML) on their surfaces. The presence of such top Pt ML induces relatively weaker binding strengths of O and OH in the ternary alloys, suggesting further activity enhancement for the ORR compared to the corresponding bimetallic alloy surfaces. Moreover, the Pt-skin surfaces of and show an enhanced electrochemical stability with respect to the dissolution of Pt atoms from the alloy surface."

1.Ternary alloys have a strong tendency for platinum surface segregation, forming a platinum monolayer on their surfaces. This top platinum monolayer results in relatively weaker binding strengths of oxygen and hydroxyl groups in the ternary alloys, indicating a potential for enhanced activity in the oxygen reduction reaction compared to bimetallic alloy surfaces. Furthermore, the platinum-skin surfaces of these alloys exhibit enhanced electrochemical stability against the dissolution of platinum atoms from the alloy surface.
