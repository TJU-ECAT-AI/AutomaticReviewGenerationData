[1] "Ternary alloys exhibit a strong Pt surface segregation tendency leading to the formation of a Pt monolayer (ML) on their surfaces. The presence of such top Pt ML induces relatively weaker binding strengths of O and OH in the ternary alloys, suggesting further activity enhancement for the ORR compared to the corresponding bimetallic alloy surfaces. Moreover, the Pt-skin surfaces of and show an enhanced electrochemical stability with respect to the dissolution of Pt atoms from the alloy surface."

1.Ternary alloys have a strong tendency for platinum surface segregation, forming a platinum monolayer on their surfaces. This top platinum monolayer results in relatively weaker binding strengths of oxygen and hydroxyl groups in the ternary alloys, indicating enhanced activity for the oxygen reduction reaction compared to bimetallic alloy surfaces. Additionally, the platinum-skin surfaces of ternary alloys exhibit improved electrochemical stability against the dissolution of platinum atoms from the alloy surface.
