1.The stability of Pt3dPt subsurface structures in various conditions is reviewed, focusing on their applications in heterogeneous catalysis and electrocatalysis. Density functional theory (DFT) predicts that these structures are stable in vacuum and with adsorbed hydrogen, but with adsorbed oxygen, the 3d atoms should segregate to the surface. These predictions have been experimentally verified on selected Pt3dPt(111) systems, and the experimental efforts have been expanded to polycrystalline Pt to determine the effects on kinetic barriers for the segregation of subsurface 3d atoms. A BrnstedEvansPolanyi relationship has been derived to correlate thermodynamic stability from DFT calculations with kinetic barriers from experimental measurements for the Pt3dPt systems. Empirical equations have been developed to predict the thermodynamic stability of other bimetallic systems in different conditions.

1.本论文回顾了Pt3dPt亚表面结构在不同条件下的稳定性，重点是它们在异相催化和电催化中的应用。密度泛函理论（DFT）预测，这些结构在真空和吸附氢的情况下是稳定的，但在吸附氧的情况下，3d原子应该迁移到表面。这些预测已经在选定的Pt3dPt(111)系统上得到了实验验证，实验工作已经扩展到多晶Pt，以确定对亚表面3d原子分层的动能障碍的影响。已经推导出一个BrnstedEvansPolanyi关系，以将DFT计算的热力学稳定性与Pt3dPt系统的实验测量的动能障碍相关联。已经开发出了经验方程，用于预测其他双金属系统在不同条件下的热力学稳定性。
