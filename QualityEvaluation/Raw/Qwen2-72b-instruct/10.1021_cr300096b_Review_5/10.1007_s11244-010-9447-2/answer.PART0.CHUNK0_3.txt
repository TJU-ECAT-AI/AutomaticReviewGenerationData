1.The stability of Pt3dPt subsurface structures, which are desirable in heterogeneous catalysis and electrocatalysis, is influenced by thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions. These structures are stable in vacuum and with adsorbed hydrogen, but with adsorbed oxygen, the 3d atoms segregate to the surface, forming 3dPtPt surface structures. DFT predictions have been verified experimentally on selected Pt3dPt(111) systems and expanded to polycrystalline Pt to determine the effects on kinetic barriers for subsurface 3d atom segregation. The large difference in binding energies between surface and subsurface structures highlights the need to understand their stability in reacting environments. For Pt3d bimetallic systems, the difference in oxygen binding energy for these configurations is on the order of hundreds of kcal/mol. Based on Sabatier's principle, if a subsurface alloy structure exhibits optimal binding properties for dehydrogenation and ORR, the surface structure would likely bind intermediates too strongly, halting the reaction. Conversely, if the surface alloy structure exhibits optimal binding properties for steam reforming, the subsurface structure would bind adsorbates too weakly, preventing the reaction from proceeding. The stability of bimetallic structures has been considered with various atomic species, which can be extended to more complex adsorbates using scaling relationships. DFT results predict that subsurface PtMPt(111) configurations are preferred in vacuum and with 0.5 ML H, while surface MPtPt(111) configurations are preferred with 0.5 ML O. Experimental measurements have verified the predicted segregation of subsurface 3d atoms in the presence of oxygen and quantified the activation barrier for adsorbate-induced segregation. AES results suggest two regions of segregation, revealing that DFT predictions and experimental measurements on single crystal bimetallic surfaces are applicable to polycrystalline substrates, bridging the materials gap. Predictions show that all Pt3dPt(100) structures have a higher activation barrier for oxygen-induced segregation compared to respective Pt3dPt(111) configurations. Linear trends in all systems show that the correlation of thermodynamic stability with the difference in d-band center can be used beyond Pt3d alloys. Switching the admetal/host component shifts the absolute driving potential of the segregation. This general stability trend predicts that all bimetallic systems have the same thermodynamically preferred configuration in each environment, with subsurface configurations preferred in vacuum and with 0.5 ML H, and surface configurations favored with 0.5 ML O.

1.Pt3dPt亚表面结构的稳定性在异相催化和电催化中是理想的结构配置，受到热力学偏好和反应条件的影响。这些结构在真空和吸附氢气时是稳定的，但在吸附氧气时，3d原子会迁移到表面，形成3dPtPt表面结构。DFT预测已经在选定的Pt3dPt(111)系统上得到实验验证，并扩展到多晶Pt，以确定对亚表面3d原子分层的动能障碍的影响。表面和亚表面结构之间的结合能的巨大差异突出了在反应环境中理解这些配置的稳定性的必要性。对于Pt3d双金属系统，这两种配置的氧结合能的差异在几百千卡/摩尔的量级。根据萨巴蒂尔原理，如果亚表面合金结构在脱氢和ORR中表现出最佳的结合性能，表面结构可能会将中间体结合得太强，从而停止反应。相反，如果表面合金结构在蒸汽重整中表现出最佳的结合性能，亚表面结构可能会将吸附物结合得太弱，从而阻止反应的进行。双金属结构的稳定性已经考虑了各种原子物种，可以使用缩放关系扩展到更复杂的吸附物。DFT结果预测，亚表面PtMPt(111)配置在真空和0.5 ML H下是优选的，而表面MPtPt(111)配置在0.5 ML O下是优选的。实验测量已经验证了在氧气存在下预测的亚表面3d原子的分层，并量化了吸附物诱导分层的激活势垒。AES结果表明存在两个分层区域，揭示了DFT预测和单晶双金属表面的实验测量适用于多晶基底，弥合了材料差距。预测显示，所有Pt3dPt(100)结构的氧诱导分层的激活势垒比相应的Pt3dPt(111)配置更高。所有系统中的线性趋势表明，热力学稳定性与d带中心差异之间的相关性可以用于Pt3d合金之外。切换admetal/host组件会改变分层的绝对驱动力。这种一般的稳定性趋势预测，所有双金属系统在每种环境中都有相同的热力学优选的双金属配置，亚表面配置在真空和0.5 ML H下是优选的，而表面配置在0.5 ML O下是优选的。
