1.The stability of Pt3dPt subsurface structures in various conditions, such as vacuum, hydrogen, and oxygen adsorption, is a critical factor in determining the catalytic properties and performance of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems. These structures are desirable in heterogeneous catalysis and electrocatalysis applications. DFT predictions indicate that these structures are stable in vacuum and with adsorbed hydrogen, but with adsorbed oxygen, the 3d atoms tend to segregate to the surface, forming 3dPtPt surface structures. Experimental verification on Pt3dPt(111) systems supports these predictions. Further experimental efforts bridge the gap from single crystal to polycrystalline Pt, considering multiple crystal facets and their effects on kinetic barriers for subsurface 3d atom segregation. A BrnstedEvansPolanyi relationship is derived to correlate thermodynamic stability from DFT calculations with kinetic barriers from experimental measurements for Pt3dPt systems. Empirical equations are developed to predict the thermodynamic stability of other bimetallic systems in various environments.

1.在各种条件下，如真空、氢吸附和氧吸附，Pt3dPt亚表面结构的稳定性是决定双金属催化剂，特别是基于Pt的系统催化性能和表现的关键因素。这些结构在异相催化和电催化应用中是理想的。DFT预测表明，这些结构在真空和吸附氢的情况下是稳定的，但在吸附氧的情况下，3d原子倾向于向表面迁移，形成3dPtPt表面结构。在Pt3dPt(111)系统上的实验验证支持了这些预测。进一步的实验努力从单晶Pt到多晶Pt架起了桥梁，考虑了多个晶面及其对亚表面3d原子迁移的动能障碍的影响。导出了BrnstedEvansPolanyi关系，以将DFT计算的热力学稳定性与Pt3dPt系统实验测量的动能障碍相关联。开发了经验方程来预测其他双金属系统在各种环境中的热力学稳定性。
