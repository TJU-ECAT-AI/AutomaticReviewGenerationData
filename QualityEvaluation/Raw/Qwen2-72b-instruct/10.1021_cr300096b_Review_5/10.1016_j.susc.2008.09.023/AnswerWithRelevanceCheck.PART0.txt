          [1] "Density functional theory is used to study oxygen adsorption and its effect on surface segregation in (211) surfaces of Pt(shell)/M(core) and Pt3M (M = Co, Ir) alloys."
          [2] "It is found that the most energetically favorable oxygen adsorption site is the bridge site over and parallel to the (100) step."
          [3] "Surface segregation phenomena is observed in Pt3Co, Pt3Ir and Pt/Co(core) systems."
          [4] "The Pt/Ir(core) structure was the only one, among the studied systems, that showed antisegregation behavior even in presence of oxygen adsorbed."
          [5] "For alloys, it has been reported that catalytic activity depends dramatically on how the atoms arrange in the first 23 layers of the catalyst surface [912] and it is influenced by the surface segregation phenomenon."
          [6] "Therefore, it is important to characterize the surface atomic distribution of catalytic alloys and to elucidate the effect of segregation on surface structure."

          The study uses density functional theory to investigate oxygen adsorption and its impact on surface segregation in Pt(shell)/M(core) and Pt3M (M = Co, Ir) alloys on (211) surfaces. Oxygen adsorbs most favorably at the bridge site over and parallel to the (100) step. Surface segregation is observed in Pt3Co, Pt3Ir, and Pt/Co(core) systems. The Pt/Ir(core) structure exhibits antisegregation behavior even when oxygen is adsorbed. The arrangement of atoms in the first 23 layers of the catalyst surface significantly affects the catalytic activity of alloys, and surface segregation plays a crucial role in this. Characterizing the surface atomic distribution and understanding the effect of segregation on surface structure are important for catalytic alloys.

          该研究使用密度泛函理论来研究Pt(shell)/M(core)和Pt3M (M = Co, Ir)合金在(211)表面上的氧吸附及其对表面分层的影响。氧吸附在(100)台阶上方和平行的桥位上最有利。观察到Pt3Co，Pt3Ir和Pt/Co(core)系统中存在表面分层。Pt/Ir(core)结构即使在氧吸附存在的情况下也表现出反分层行为。对于合金，据报道，催化活性在很大程度上取决于催化剂表面前23层中原子的排列方式，并受到表面分层现象的影响。因此，表征催化合金的表面原子分布并阐明分层对表面结构的影响是重要的。
