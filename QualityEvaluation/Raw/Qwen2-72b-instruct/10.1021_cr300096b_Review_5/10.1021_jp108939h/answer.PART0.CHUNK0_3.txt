[1] "The lower surface free energy of Au compared to Pt (1.13 (44, 45) vs 2.48 (46) J/m2) makes it energetically favorable for Au to remain at the surface when Au is deposited on top of Pt. The fact that Au and Pt are immiscible at Au compositions greater than 17% (47) also suggests that Au should remain on top of the Pt clusters."
[2] "Density functional theory calculations demonstrate that it is thermodynamically favorable for Pt to diffuse to the cluster surface in order to bind to CO."
[3] "For CO oxidation, the first step in the reaction is the dissociation of O2 at Pt sites. Since this process requires more than one contiguous Pt site, it is not surprising that O2 dissociation cannot occur on the PtAu clusters that are 100% Au at the surface before CO exposure, given the low probability for ensembles of Pt sites to form at the surface."

1.Thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions significantly influence the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems such as Pt-3d alloys. The lower surface free energy of Au compared to Pt makes it energetically favorable for Au to remain at the surface when Au is deposited on top of Pt. Additionally, the immiscibility of Au and Pt at Au compositions greater than 17% suggests that Au should remain on top of the Pt clusters. Density functional theory calculations demonstrate that it is thermodynamically favorable for Pt to diffuse to the cluster surface in order to bind to CO. For CO oxidation, the first step in the reaction is the dissociation of O2 at Pt sites. Since this process requires more than one contiguous Pt site, it is not surprising that O2 dissociation cannot occur on the PtAu clusters that are 100% Au at the surface before CO exposure, given the low probability for ensembles of Pt sites to form at the surface. These factors have consequent implications for the catalytic properties and performance of bimetallic catalysts in various applications.

1.热力学偏好和反应条件对双金属催化剂的稳定性、表面分层和结构配置有重大影响，特别是在Pt基系统如Pt-3d合金中。Au的表面自由能比Pt低，这使得当Au沉积在Pt顶部时，Au留在表面在能量上是有利的。此外，当Au组成大于17%时，Au和Pt的不互溶性表明Au应该留在Pt簇的顶部。密度泛函理论计算表明，Pt扩散到簇表面以与CO结合在热力学上是有利的。对于CO氧化，反应的第一步是O2在Pt位点的解离。由于这个过程需要一个以上的连续Pt位点，因此在CO暴露前表面为100% Au的PtAu簇上不能发生O2解离，考虑到在表面形成Pt位点集合的概率很低，这一点并不令人惊讶。这些因素对双金属催化剂在各种应用中的催化特性和性能有相应的含义。
