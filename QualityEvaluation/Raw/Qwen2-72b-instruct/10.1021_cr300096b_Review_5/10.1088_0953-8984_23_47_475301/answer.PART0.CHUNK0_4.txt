1.The thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions influence the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems such as Pt-3d alloys. The simulation results showed that the Pd atoms would segregate into the outermost layers of the extended surfaces and the Pt concentration would increase monotonically from the extended surfaces into the bulk. The equilibrium PtPd nanoparticles were found to have Pd-enriched shells and Pt-enriched cores. In the shell of the PtPd nanoparticles, the Pd atoms were predicted to preferably segregate to the (100) facets rather than the (111) facets. These phenomena have consequent implications for their catalytic properties and performance in various applications.

1.热力学偏好和反应条件影响双金属催化剂的稳定性、表面分层和结构配置，特别是在Pt基系统如Pt-3d合金中。模拟结果显示，Pd原子会分层到扩展表面的最外层，而Pt浓度会从扩展表面到体相单调增加。平衡的PtPd纳米粒子被发现有Pd富集的壳层和Pt富集的核心。在PtPd纳米粒子的壳层中，Pd原子被预测更倾向于分层到(100)面而不是(111)面。这些现象对它们在各种应用中的催化特性和性能有后续影响。
