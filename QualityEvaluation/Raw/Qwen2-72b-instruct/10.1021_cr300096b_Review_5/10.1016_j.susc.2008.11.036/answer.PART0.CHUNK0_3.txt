[1] "Surface segregation has been drawing much experimental and theoretical attention due to its importance to materials science, catalysis and surface chemistry."
[2] "The phenomenon is able to influence many important physical and chemical properties such as permeation, surface adsorption, crystal growth, metal corrosion, etc."
[3] "In particular, it has been found out that the catalytic activities of alloys can be significantly altered through surface segregation."
[4] "Platinum-based alloys have been extensively studied as cathode catalysts for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR)."
[5] "Compared to pure Pt, enhanced ORR activities were observed in the case of Pt alloyed with 3d metals."
[6] "Remarkably, surface segregation was found closely related to the activity improvement."
[7] "For instance, Stamenkovic et al. compared the kinetics of the ORR on bulk alloy of Pt3Co and the Pt-skin structure produced by Pt-segregating on the topmost layer of the annealed surface."
[8] "The ORR was uniquely active on the Pt-skin surface and the rate of reaction is four times that for the pure Pt catalyst."
[9] "The unusual catalytic activity has intrigued many researchers and numerous experimental and computational studies have been carried out for the surface segregation of Pt alloys."
[10] "For most of them, the endeavors focused on the understanding of the surface and subsurface structures and electronic properties under vacuum conditions."
[11] "However, catalytic reactions such as the ORR are typically take place under operating environments with various adsorbates."
[12] "The adsorbates can affect the surface segregation trend and even change the surface composition of the alloys in some cases."
[13] "As the catalytic properties are primarily determined by the surface geometry and the electronic structure which can be modified by the surface composition of the alloys, studying the segregation trend of Pt-based alloys under surface adsorption is thus of great importance."

1.Surface segregation in bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems such as Pt-3d alloys, is influenced by thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions. This phenomenon is crucial in materials science, catalysis, and surface chemistry, affecting properties like permeation, surface adsorption, crystal growth, and metal corrosion. Surface segregation can significantly alter the catalytic activities of alloys, as evidenced by enhanced oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activities in Pt alloys with 3d metals compared to pure Pt. The unusual catalytic activity, closely related to surface segregation, has sparked extensive research. Most studies have focused on understanding surface and subsurface structures and electronic properties under vacuum conditions. However, catalytic reactions like the ORR occur under environments with various adsorbates, which can influence surface segregation trends and change the surface composition of alloys. Therefore, studying the segregation trend of Pt-based alloys under surface adsorption is critical for understanding their catalytic properties and performance in various applications.

1.在双金属催化剂中，特别是在基于Pt的系统如Pt-3d合金中，表面分层受热力学偏好和反应条件的影响。这种现象在材料科学、催化和表面化学中至关重要，影响诸如渗透、表面吸附、晶体生长和金属腐蚀等性质。表面分层可以显著改变合金的催化活性，正如在与3d金属合金化的Pt中观察到的增强的氧还原反应（ORR）活性，与纯Pt相比。与表面分层紧密相关的异常催化活性激发了广泛的研究。大多数研究集中在理解真空条件下表面和次表面结构以及电子性质。然而，像ORR这样的催化反应通常发生在具有各种吸附物的环境中，这些吸附物可以影响表面分层趋势，甚至在某些情况下改变合金的表面组成。因此，研究Pt基合金在表面吸附下的分层趋势对于理解它们在各种应用中的催化性质和性能至关重要。
