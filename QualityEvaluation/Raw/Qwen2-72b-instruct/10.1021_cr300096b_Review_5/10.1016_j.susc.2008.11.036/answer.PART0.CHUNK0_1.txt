1.Surface segregation in bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems such as Pt-3d alloys, is influenced by thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions. This phenomenon is significant in materials science, catalysis, and surface chemistry, affecting properties like permeation, surface adsorption, crystal growth, and metal corrosion. The catalytic activities of alloys can be significantly altered through surface segregation. Platinum-based alloys, as cathode catalysts for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), exhibit enhanced activities when alloyed with 3d metals, with surface segregation closely related to activity improvement. For example, the ORR on Pt3Co shows a fourfold increase in reaction rate on a Pt-skin surface compared to pure Pt. This unusual catalytic activity has prompted extensive research on the surface segregation of Pt alloys, with a focus on understanding surface and subsurface structures and electronic properties under vacuum conditions. However, catalytic reactions like the ORR occur under environments with various adsorbates, which can influence surface segregation trends and alter the surface composition of alloys. Therefore, studying the segregation trend of Pt-based alloys under surface adsorption is crucial for understanding their catalytic properties, which are primarily determined by surface geometry and electronic structure, which can be modified by surface composition.

1.在双金属催化剂中，特别是在基于Pt的系统如Pt-3d合金中，表面分层受热力学偏好和反应条件的影响。这种现象在材料科学、催化和表面化学中具有重要意义，影响诸如渗透、表面吸附、晶体生长和金属腐蚀等性质。通过表面分层，合金的催化活性可以显著改变。作为氧还原反应(ORR)的阴极催化剂，基于铂的合金在与3d金属合金化时表现出增强的活性，表面分层与活性改善密切相关。例如，Pt3Co上的ORR在Pt-皮肤表面上的反应速率比纯Pt高四倍。这种异常的催化活性促使对Pt合金的表面分层进行了广泛的研究，重点是理解真空条件下表面和次表面结构以及电子性质。然而，像ORR这样的催化反应通常发生在含有各种吸附物的环境中，这些吸附物可以影响表面分层趋势，甚至在某些情况下改变合金的表面组成。因此，研究Pt基合金在表面吸附下的分层趋势对于理解其催化性质至关重要，这些性质主要由表面几何和电子结构决定，这些结构可以由表面组成修改。
