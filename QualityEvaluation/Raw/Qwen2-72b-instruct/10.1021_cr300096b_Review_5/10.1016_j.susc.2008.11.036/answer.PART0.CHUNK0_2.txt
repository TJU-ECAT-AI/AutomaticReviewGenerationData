1.Surface segregation in materials science, catalysis, and surface chemistry has received significant attention due to its impact on physical and chemical properties such as permeation, surface adsorption, crystal growth, and metal corrosion. The catalytic activities of alloys can be significantly altered through surface segregation. Platinum-based alloys, particularly those alloyed with 3d metals, have been extensively studied as cathode catalysts for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), with enhanced activities observed compared to pure Pt. Surface segregation has been closely linked to this activity improvement. For Pt3d alloys, experimental studies have shown that a Pt-skin layer forms under vacuum conditions, accompanied by a Pt-depleted layer underneath. This work examines the surface segregation trend of Pt3M(1 1 1) (M = Fe, Co, and Ni) alloy systems under the adsorption of atomic oxygen using periodic density functional theory (DFT) calculations. The interactions of oxygen with the alloy surfaces play a critical role in the segregation of Pt-based alloys. The influence of surface segregation on the ORR catalytic activity is complex, involving factors such as the concentration of adsorbates, segregation kinetics, dissolution of Pt and/or less-noble atoms, and the ORR mechanism.

1.表面分层在材料科学、催化和表面化学领域受到了大量实验和理论的关注，因为它对渗透、表面吸附、晶体生长和金属腐蚀等重要的物理和化学性质有影响。特别是，人们发现通过表面分层，合金的催化活性可以显著改变。铂基合金，特别是与3d金属合金化的铂，已被广泛研究作为氧还原反应(ORR)的阴极催化剂，与纯铂相比，观察到增强的ORR活性。值得注意的是，表面分层与活性提高密切相关。对于许多Pt3d合金，以前的实验研究已经表明，在真空条件下，Pt皮肤层的形成伴随着下面的Pt耗尽层。本研究采用周期性密度泛函理论(DFT)计算，研究了Pt3M(1 1 1)(M=Fe、Co和Ni)合金体系在原子氧吸附下的表面分层趋势。正如我们将展示的，氧与合金表面的相互作用在铂基合金的分层中起着关键作用。表面分层对ORR催化活性的影响相当复杂，因为存在许多因素，如吸附物的浓度、分层动力学、Pt和/或低贵原子的溶解以及ORR机制。
