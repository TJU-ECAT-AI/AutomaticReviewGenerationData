1.Surface segregation in bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems such as Pt-3d alloys, is influenced by thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions. This phenomenon is significant in materials science, catalysis, and surface chemistry, affecting properties like permeation, surface adsorption, crystal growth, and metal corrosion. Surface segregation can notably alter the catalytic activities of alloys, as evidenced by enhanced oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activities in Pt alloys with 3d metals compared to pure Pt. The activity improvement is closely related to surface segregation, as demonstrated by the increased ORR activity on a Pt-skin surface produced by Pt segregating on the topmost layer of an annealed Pt3Co alloy surface, with a reaction rate four times that of pure Pt. This unusual catalytic activity has sparked numerous studies on the surface segregation of Pt alloys, with a focus on understanding surface and subsurface structures and electronic properties under vacuum conditions. However, catalytic reactions like the ORR occur under environments with various adsorbates, which can influence surface segregation trends and alter the surface composition of alloys. Studying the segregation trend of Pt-based alloys under surface adsorption is crucial as catalytic properties are primarily determined by surface geometry and electronic structure, which can be modified by surface composition.

1.在双金属催化剂中，特别是在基于Pt的系统如Pt-3d合金中，表面分层受热力学偏好和反应条件的影响。这种现象在材料科学、催化和表面化学中具有重要意义，影响诸如渗透、表面吸附、晶体生长和金属腐蚀等性质。表面分层可以显著改变合金的催化活性，正如在与3d金属合金化的Pt中观察到的增强的氧还原反应（ORR）活性，与纯Pt相比。活动的提高与表面分层密切相关，正如在Pt3Co合金表面的顶部层通过Pt分层产生的Pt-皮肤结构上观察到的增强的ORR活性所证明的，反应速率是纯Pt的四倍。这种异常的催化活性激发了对Pt合金的表面分层的大量研究，重点是理解表面和次表面结构以及真空条件下的电子性质。然而，像ORR这样的催化反应通常发生在具有各种吸附物的环境中，这些吸附物可以影响表面分层趋势，甚至在某些情况下改变合金的表面组成。研究Pt基合金在表面吸附下的分层趋势是至关重要的，因为催化性质主要由可以被表面组成修改的表面几何和电子结构决定。

This phenomenon is significant in materials science, catalysis, and surface chemistry, affecting properties like permeation, surface adsorption, crystal growth, and metal corrosion. The catalytic activities of alloys can be significantly altered through surface segregation. Platinum-based alloys, as cathode catalysts for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), exhibit enhanced activities when alloyed with 3d metals, with surface segregation closely related to activity improvement. For example, the ORR on Pt3Co shows a fourfold increase in reaction rate on a Pt-skin surface compared to pure Pt. This unusual catalytic activity has prompted extensive research on the surface segregation of Pt alloys, with a focus on understanding surface and subsurface structures and electronic properties under vacuum conditions. However, catalytic reactions like the ORR occur under environments with various adsorbates, which can influence surface segregation trends and alter the surface composition of alloys. Therefore, studying the segregation trend of Pt-based alloys under surface adsorption is crucial for understanding their catalytic properties, which are primarily determined by surface geometry and electronic structure, which can be modified by surface composition.

1.Surface segregation in materials science, catalysis, and surface chemistry has received significant attention due to its impact on physical and chemical properties such as permeation, surface adsorption, crystal growth, and metal corrosion. The catalytic activities of alloys can be significantly altered through surface segregation. Platinum-based alloys, particularly those alloyed with 3d metals, have been extensively studied as cathode catalysts for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), with enhanced activities observed compared to pure Pt. Surface segregation has been closely linked to this activity improvement. For Pt3d alloys, experimental studies have shown that a Pt-skin layer forms under vacuum conditions, accompanied by a Pt-depleted layer underneath. This work examines the surface segregation trend of Pt3M(1 1 1) (M = Fe, Co, and Ni) alloy systems under the adsorption of atomic oxygen using periodic density functional theory (DFT) calculations. The interactions of oxygen with the alloy surfaces play a critical role in the segregation of Pt-based alloys. The influence of surface segregation on the ORR catalytic activity is complex, involving factors such as the concentration of adsorbates, segregation kinetics, dissolution of Pt and/or less-noble atoms, and the ORR mechanism.
