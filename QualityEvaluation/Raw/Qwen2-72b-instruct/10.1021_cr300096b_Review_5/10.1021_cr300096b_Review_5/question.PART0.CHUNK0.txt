3.1 DFT Calculations of Thermodynamic Stability
One of the most critical questions in bimetallic catalysis is the stability of bimetallic surface structures under reaction conditions, which would in turn modify the catalytic properties. For example, as shown earlier in Figure 3, the monolayer surface Ni atoms diffuse into the subsurface region of Pt(111) upon annealing, indicating that the subsurface PtNiPt(111) structure is thermodynamically more stable than the surface NiPtPt(111) structure in vacuum, i.e., without adsorbates. Several other investigations of Pt3d alloys in fuel cell applications have suggested that the alloy films used in these studies are covered by a Pt skin, (195-197) again indicating the thermodynamic preference of Pt-terminated bimetallic surfaces.
Ruban et al. (198) have utilized DFT to calculate the segregation energy (Eseg) for transition metal alloys, which is the thermodynamic driving potential to move the subsurface admetal from the bulk to the surface of the host metal in vacuum. Alden et al. (199) have shown that the surface segregation energy in transition metal alloy depends strongly on the crystal structure and is essentially given by the difference in the surface energies of the pure alloy components. Ruban et al. (198) have performed DFT calculations of the values of Eseg for admetal atoms (M) on many host substrates (H), utilizing the linear-muffintin-orbitals coherent potential approximation. If Eseg is sufficiently negative, the admetal segregates to the surface to produce the MHH surface monolayer structure. If Eseg is sufficiently positive, the surface layer is the host metal, leading to the formation of the HMH subsurface monolayer structure. Christensen et al. (43) have also utilized DFT to investigate surface alloy phases and their stability based on surface phase diagrams constructed from the surface energy as a function of the surface composition.
Greeley and Mavrikakis (12) performed segregation energy calculations by examining the effects of adsorbates on the stability of the surface and subsurface structures. It was found that the thermodynamic driving force of hydrogen-induced segregation was related to two terms: the value of Eseg and the difference between the hydrogen-binding energies on the surface and subsurface structures. Because hydrogen binds relatively weakly to most transition metals, only a few bimetallic surfaces experience a hydrogen-induced segregation of the subsurface admetals.
Besides hydrogen, it is also important to study the influence of adsorbates on surface segregation using a strong adsorbate, such as oxygen. Figure 6 shows the total energy difference, ΔEseg, defined as the difference between the formation energy of the subsurface and surface structures, as a function of the surface d-band center in the 3dPtPt(111) structure. The values of ΔEseg are positive for all systems under vacuum, predicting that the Pt3dPt(111) subsurface structures are thermodynamically more stable than the 3dPtPt(111) surface in vacuum. For comparison, the ΔEseg values are also included in Figure 6 with 0.5 ML atomic hydrogen and oxygen. (33) The DFT results predict that the subsurface configuration remains thermodynamically preferred with adsorbed hydrogen. However, the subsurface structure is no longer stable in the presence of 0.5 ML atomic oxygen, indicating a thermodynamic driving potential for the subsurface 3d metals to segregate to the surface. Additional atomic adsorbates are studied by Menning and Chen (200) to compare how the thermodynamic potential for segregation varies with adsorbate binding strength. An adsorbate with a weak Pauling electronegativity, such as H, S, Se, or C, binds weakly with both surface and subsurface configurations and provides only a small shift in the thermodynamic potential for interchanging the configuration. In contrast, an adsorbate with a strong Pauling electronegativity, such as N or O, produces a large difference in binding energy between the two configurations. When the surface coverage of N or O is high enough, this difference outweighs the thermodynamic potential for retaining the subsurface configuration in vacuum. (200) The results in Figure 6 indicate that the presence of atomic oxygen makes the 3dPtPt(111) surface structure more thermodynamically stable than Pt3dPt(111). Menning and Chen have extended DFT calculations to the Pt(100) substrate to explore the effect of crystal structure on segregation. Although the values of the d-band center and ΔEseg are different for 3d metals on Pt(111) and Pt(100), the general trend in the relative stability of the surface and subsurface structures remains the same. (33) The oxygen-induced surface segregation is also predicted for the (211) surfaces of Pt(shell)/M(core) and Pt3M (M = Co, Ir) alloys by Callejas-Tovar and Balbuena. (201) Table 2 provides a list of DFT calculations and experimental studies of surface segregation of various bimetallic surfaces with several types of atomic and molecular adsorbates.
