1.The stability of bimetallic surface structures under reaction conditions is a critical factor in bimetallic catalysis, as it can modify the catalytic properties. For example, under certain conditions, the subsurface PtNiPt(111) structure is more stable than the surface NiPtPt(111) structure. In fuel cell applications, Pt3d alloys often have a Pt skin, indicating a thermodynamic preference for Pt-terminated surfaces. The thermodynamic driving force of hydrogen-induced segregation is related to the segregation energy and the difference in hydrogen-binding energies on the surface and subsurface structures. However, hydrogen binds weakly to most transition metals, so only a few bimetallic surfaces experience hydrogen-induced segregation of subsurface admetals. Oxygen, on the other hand, can induce surface segregation of subsurface 3d metals. Adsorbates with weak Pauling electronegativity, such as H, S, Se, or C, provide only a small shift in the thermodynamic potential for interchanging the surface and subsurface configurations. Adsorbates with strong Pauling electronegativity, such as N or O, can produce a large difference in binding energy between the two configurations, leading to surface segregation when the surface coverage is high enough.

1.在双金属催化中，反应条件下双金属表面结构的稳定性是一个关键问题，因为它可以改变催化性能。例如，在某些条件下，子表面PtNiPt(111)结构比表面NiPtPt(111)结构更稳定。在燃料电池应用中，Pt3d合金通常有Pt皮肤，表明对Pt终止表面有热力学偏好。氢诱导分层的热力学驱动力与分层能和表面和子表面结构上的氢结合能之差有关。然而，氢与大多数过渡金属的结合较弱，因此只有少数双金属表面经历氢诱导的子表面吸附金属的分层。另一方面，氧气可以诱导子表面3d金属的表面分层。具有弱泡利电负性的吸附物，如H、S、Se或C，只会使表面和子表面配置之间的热力学势能发生微小变化。具有强泡利电负性的吸附物，如N或O，可以在两种配置之间产生很大的结合能差异，当表面覆盖率足够高时，会导致表面分层。
