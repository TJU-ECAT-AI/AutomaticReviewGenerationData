          [1] "One of the most critical questions in bimetallic catalysis is the stability of bimetallic surface structures under reaction conditions, which would in turn modify the catalytic properties."
          [2] "the monolayer surface Ni atoms diffuse into the subsurface region of Pt(111) upon annealing, indicating that the subsurface PtNiPt(111) structure is thermodynamically more stable than the surface NiPtPt(111) structure in vacuum, i.e., without adsorbates."
          [3] "Several other investigations of Pt3d alloys in fuel cell applications have suggested that the alloy films used in these studies are covered by a Pt skin, (195-197) again indicating the thermodynamic preference of Pt-terminated bimetallic surfaces."
          [4] "If Eseg is sufficiently negative, the admetal segregates to the surface to produce the MHH surface monolayer structure. If Eseg is sufficiently positive, the surface layer is the host metal, leading to the formation of the HMH subsurface monolayer structure."
          [5] "the thermodynamic driving force of hydrogen-induced segregation was related to two terms: the value of Eseg and the difference between the hydrogen-binding energies on the surface and subsurface structures."
          [6] "Because hydrogen binds relatively weakly to most transition metals, only a few bimetallic surfaces experience a hydrogen-induced segregation of the subsurface admetals."
          [7] "the subsurface configuration remains thermodynamically preferred with adsorbed hydrogen. However, the subsurface structure is no longer stable in the presence of 0.5 ML atomic oxygen, indicating a thermodynamic driving potential for the subsurface 3d metals to segregate to the surface."
          [8] "An adsorbate with a weak Pauling electronegativity, such as H, S, Se, or C, binds weakly with both surface and subsurface configurations and provides only a small shift in the thermodynamic potential for interchanging the configuration."
          [9] "An adsorbate with a strong Pauling electronegativity, such as N or O, produces a large difference in binding energy between the two configurations. When the surface coverage of N or O is high enough, this difference outweighs the thermodynamic potential for retaining the subsurface configuration in vacuum."
          [10] "The oxygen-induced surface segregation is also predicted for the (211) surfaces of Pt(shell)/M(core) and Pt3M (M = Co, Ir) alloys by Callejas-Tovar and Balbuena."

          The stability of bimetallic surface structures under reaction conditions is a critical factor in bimetallic catalysis, as it can modify catalytic properties. For example, under annealing conditions, the subsurface PtNiPt(111) structure is more thermodynamically stable than the surface NiPtPt(111) structure in vacuum. Pt3d alloys in fuel cell applications often have a Pt skin, indicating a thermodynamic preference for Pt-terminated bimetallic surfaces. The segregation energy (Eseg) determines whether the admetal segregates to the surface or remains in the subsurface, affecting the surface composition. Hydrogen-induced segregation is influenced by Eseg and the difference in hydrogen-binding energies on the surface and subsurface. Oxygen can destabilize the subsurface structure, driving subsurface 3d metals to segregate to the surface. Adsorbates with weak Pauling electronegativity have a small effect on the thermodynamic potential for interchanging surface and subsurface configurations, while those with strong Pauling electronegativity can significantly alter binding energy, leading to surface segregation when their coverage is high enough. Oxygen-induced surface segregation is also predicted for specific Pt-based alloy surfaces.

          在双金属催化中，反应条件下双金属表面结构的稳定性是一个关键问题，因为它可以改变催化性能。例如，在退火条件下，亚表面PtNiPt(111)结构在真空中的热力学稳定性高于表面NiPtPt(111)结构。在燃料电池应用中，Pt3d合金通常具有Pt皮肤，表明热力学上更倾向于Pt终止的表面。分离能(Eseg)决定了吸附金属是分离到表面还是保留在亚表面，影响表面组成。氢诱导的分离受Eseg和表面与亚表面氢结合能差的影响。氧气可以破坏亚表面结构，促使亚表面3d金属向表面分离。具有弱泡利电负性的吸附物对表面和亚表面配置之间热力学潜力的交换只有很小的影响，而具有强泡利电负性的吸附物可以显著改变结合能，当其覆盖度足够高时，会导致表面分离。氧气诱导的表面分离也被预测为特定Pt基合金表面。
