[1] "One of the most critical questions in bimetallic catalysis is the stability of bimetallic surface structures under reaction conditions, which would in turn modify the catalytic properties."
[2] "the monolayer surface Ni atoms diffuse into the subsurface region of Pt(111) upon annealing, indicating that the subsurface PtNiPt(111) structure is thermodynamically more stable than the surface NiPtPt(111) structure in vacuum, i.e., without adsorbates."
[3] "Several other investigations of Pt3d alloys in fuel cell applications have suggested that the alloy films used in these studies are covered by a Pt skin, (195-197) again indicating the thermodynamic preference of Pt-terminated bimetallic surfaces."
[4] "the thermodynamic driving force of hydrogen-induced segregation was related to two terms: the value of Eseg and the difference between the hydrogen-binding energies on the surface and subsurface structures."
[5] "Because hydrogen binds relatively weakly to most transition metals, only a few bimetallic surfaces experience a hydrogen-induced segregation of the subsurface admetals."
[6] "the subsurface configuration remains thermodynamically preferred with adsorbed hydrogen. However, the subsurface structure is no longer stable in the presence of 0.5 ML atomic oxygen, indicating a thermodynamic driving potential for the subsurface 3d metals to segregate to the surface."
[7] "An adsorbate with a weak Pauling electronegativity, such as H, S, Se, or C, binds weakly with both surface and subsurface configurations and provides only a small shift in the thermodynamic potential for interchanging the configuration."
[8] "In contrast, an adsorbate with a strong Pauling electronegativity, such as N or O, produces a large difference in binding energy between the two configurations."
[9] "When the surface coverage of N or O is high enough, this difference outweighs the thermodynamic potential for retaining the subsurface configuration in vacuum."

1.The stability of bimetallic surface structures under reaction conditions is a critical factor in bimetallic catalysis, as it can modify the catalytic properties.
2.Under annealing conditions, the subsurface PtNiPt(111) structure is more thermodynamically stable than the surface NiPtPt(111) structure in vacuum.
3.Pt3d alloys in fuel cell applications often have a Pt skin, indicating a thermodynamic preference for Pt-terminated bimetallic surfaces.
4.The thermodynamic driving force of hydrogen-induced segregation is related to the value of Eseg and the difference in hydrogen-binding energies on the surface and subsurface structures.
5.Hydrogen binds weakly to most transition metals, resulting in few bimetallic surfaces experiencing hydrogen-induced segregation of subsurface admetals.
6.In the presence of hydrogen, the subsurface configuration remains thermodynamically preferred, but with oxygen, the subsurface structure is no longer stable, indicating a thermodynamic driving potential for subsurface 3d metals to segregate to the surface.
7.Adsorbates with weak Pauling electronegativity, such as H, S, Se, or C, bind weakly with both surface and subsurface configurations, providing only a small shift in the thermodynamic potential for interchanging the configuration.
8.Adsorbates with strong Pauling electronegativity, such as N or O, produce a large difference in binding energy between the two configurations.
9.When the surface coverage of N or O is high enough, the difference in binding energy outweighs the thermodynamic potential for retaining the subsurface configuration in vacuum.

1.在双金属催化中，反应条件下双金属表面结构的稳定性是一个关键问题，因为它可以改变催化性能。
2.在退火条件下，亚表面PtNiPt(111)结构在真空中的热力学稳定性高于表面NiPtPt(111)结构。
3.Pt3d合金在燃料电池应用中通常有Pt皮肤，表明Pt终止的双金属表面具有热力学偏好。
4.氢诱导分层的热力学驱动力与Eseg值和表面与亚表面结构上的氢结合能之差有关。
5.氢与大多数过渡金属的结合较弱，导致很少有双金属表面经历亚表面吸附金属的氢诱导分层。
6.在氢的存在下，亚表面构型在热力学上仍然是优选的，但与氧一起，亚表面结构不再稳定，表明亚表面3d金属向表面分层的热力学驱动力。
7.具有弱泡利电负性的吸附物，如H、S、Se或C，与表面和亚表面构型的结合较弱，仅提供交换构型的热力学势的小变化。
8.具有强泡利电负性的吸附物，如N或O，在两种构型之间产生大的结合能差异。
9.当N或O的表面覆盖率足够高时，结合能的差异超过了在真空中保持亚表面构型的热力学势。
