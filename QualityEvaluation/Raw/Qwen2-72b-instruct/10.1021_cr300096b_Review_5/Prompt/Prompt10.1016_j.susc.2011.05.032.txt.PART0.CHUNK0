Density functional theory calculation of platinum surface segregation energy in Pt3Ni (111) surface doped with a third transition metal Abstract We have used density functional theory method to calculate the Pt surface segregation energy in the Pt3Ni (111) surface doped with a third transition metal M and thus investigated the influence of component M on the extent of Pt segregation to the outermost layer of these Pt3Ni/M (111) surface. As a third component in the Pt3Ni/M (111) surface, V, Fe, Co, Mo, Tc, Ru, W, Re, Os, and Ir were predicted to lead to even more negative Pt surface segregation energies than that in the based Pt3Ni (111) surface; Ti, Cr, Mn, Cu, Zr, Nb, Rh, Hf, and Ta would still retain the preference of Pt segregation to the surface but with less extent than the replaced Ni, while Pd, Ag, and Au would completely suppress the Pt segregation to the Pt3Ni/M (111) surfaces. Furthermore, we examined the relation between the Pt surface segregation energy in the Pt3Ni/M (111) surfaces and the material properties (lattice parameter, heat of solution, and Pt surface segregation energy) of binary alloys Pt3M. It was found that the surface energy effect, strain effect, and heat of solution effect induced by the doped element M would collectively affect the Pt surface segregation energy in the Pt3Ni/M (111) surfaces.
Highlights We calculate the Pt surface segregation energy in the Pt3Ni/M (111) surface.  V, Fe, Co, Mo, Tc, Ru, W, Re, Os, and Ir further promote Pt surface segregation.  Pd, Ag, and Au suppress Pt surface segregation.  Surface energy, strain, and heat of solution are important effects.
1. Introduction
Polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cells (PEMFC) require efficient electrocatalysts to convert hydrogen and oxygen to produce water and generate electricity. Among pure metals, Platinum (Pt) has the best catalytic activity for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), which takes place on the cathode of PEMFC. However, Pt is a precious metal. To reduce the cost as well as to improve the performance of PEMFC, much research efforts have been focused on studying the surface composition, surface electronic structures, and catalytic activity for ORR of Pt binary [1] ,[2] ,[3] ,[4] ,[5] ,[6] and ternary alloys [7] ,[8] ,[9] ,[10] ,[11] . In particular, it has been found that some Pt alloys could exhibit even higher catalytic activity for ORR than pure Pt catalysts. For example, Paulus et al.
[1] observed an activity enhancement by a factor of 23 in Pt50Co50 alloy catalysts; Stamenkovic et al.
[3] found that Pt75Co25 and Pt75Ni25 could have at least three times better performance than pure Pt; Toda et al.
[5] discovered that Pt50Fe50 alloy catalysts led to an enhanced electrocatalytic performance which was 25 times higher than that of pure Pt. High-throughput study of PtNiZr catalysts by Whitacre et al.
[7] revealed that Pt59Ni39Zr2 alloy could provide higher Tafel current, increased current density, and higher onset potential for ORR than Pt. He et al.
[8] used combinational high through-put method to screen a series of Pt ternary alloys and found that PtTiNi, PtTiCu and PtTiV alloys, respectively, could have a ten-fold, an eight-fold, and a six-fold activity enhancement for ORR than pure Pt. In more elaborated studies, the Pt alloy catalysts were fabricated by depositing a monolayer Pt on the surface of various transition metal or alloy nanoparticles [9] ,[10] ,[11] . These Pt monolayer electrocatalysts have been demonstrated to have up to a 20-fold enhancement in Pt mass activity for ORR as compared with pure Pt catalysts [9] ,[11] . All these investigations show promises to find a Pt alloy with an optimized catalytic performance but reduced Pt contents for PEMFC.
Surface segregation refers to the phenomenon by which the chemical composition at the surface of alloy materials differs from the composition in the bulk. Because surface region is the active place for many material processes to occur, surface segregation affects such material properties as thermionic emission, crystal growth, catalysis, friction and wear, oxidation, corrosion, and surface adsorption [12] . Currently, it is generally agreed that Pt surface segregation in Pt alloy electro-catalysts plays a critical role in improving the ORR kinetics on these catalysts and hence should be taken advantage of during the development of economical yet effective catalysts for PEMFC. The Pt-Ni, Pt-Co, and Pt-Fe alloys had been found to have even better catalytic performance for ORR than pure Pt if the Pt atoms segregated to the outermost surfaces and formed a mono surface layer on these alloys [1] ,[3] ,[13] ,[14] . For instance, it was found that due to surface segregation there would be 100% Pt in the outermost layer but only 50% Pt (namely, 50% Ni) in the sub-layer of the (111) surface of Pt75Ni25 alloy.
[3] ,[13] ,[15] In such a Pt-segregated surface structure, the transition metal atoms beneath the Pt monolayer could shift the d electron band of the Pt outermost surface layer toward higher catalytic activity for ORR.
[13] ,[16] Therefore, it is pivotal for us to reliably predict the surface segregation extent in the Pt alloy surfaces in order to effectively design electrocatalysts for fuel cell applications.
There have been extensive studies both in experiment [15] ,[17] ,[18] and in theory [19] ,[20] ,[21] ,[22] ,[23] on the surface segregation phenomena in binary alloys. However, the study of the surface segregation phenomena in ternary alloys is relatively scarce [24] ,[25] . Particularly, it is still lacking a systematic and fundamental understanding about how adding a third component would impact the surface segregation process in the based binary alloy. Generally speaking, a third component may promote or suppress the surface segregation in the based binary alloys, depending on its preference to stay in the surface or bulk regions and its strength of interaction with the other two component metals [7] ,[11] . In this work, we used density functional theory (DFT) calculation method to investigate how a third transition metal element M (M is a 3 d, 4 d, or 5 d transition metal) could modify the driving energy for Pt segregation to the outermost layer of Pt3Ni (111) surface. We chose Pt3Ni crystal as our based binary alloy of study because the surface segregation profiles of the Pt3Ni (111) surface have been well-established.
[23] In the annealed (111) surface of PtNi alloys, Pt will strongly segregate to the outermost layer, Ni will segregate to the subsurface layer, while Pt will slightly enrich the third surface layer. Thus, the surface segregation process in the Pt-Ni alloys leads to the formation of a Pt-Ni-Pt sandwich structure in their (111) surfaces [17] ,[23] . Previous simulation results manifested that due to surface segregation the annealed (111) surface of the Pt3Ni alloy would have about 100 at.% Pt in the outermost layer, 50 at.% Pt in the second layer, and 75 at.% Pt in the third layer [23] . It has been further demonstrated that such Pt surface-segregated Pt-Ni catalysts had enhanced catalytic performance for ORR [13] .
In this paper, we first performed DFT calculations to determine the optimized structures of the bulk-terminated and Pt-segregated Pt3Ni (111) surfaces doped with a third transition metal M (denoted as Pt3Ni/M (111)). Then, we evaluated the Pt surface segregation energy in these Pt3Ni/M (111) surfaces. Here, Pt surface segregation energy was computed as the energy difference between the lowest-energy configurations of the optimized Pt-segregated and bulk-terminated Pt3Ni/M (111) surfaces. Using these calculated Pt surface segregation energies, we examined whether the doped transition metal M would promote or suppress the Pt segregation to the outermost layer of the Pt3Ni/M (111) surface. Furthermore, we discussed the effect of the doped M on the Pt segregation to the Pt3Ni/M (111) surface in terms of the relative Pt surface segregation energy, lattice parameter, and heat of solution of Pt3M crystal with respect to those quantities of Pt3Ni crystal.
2. Computation models
All relaxed structures and their energies in this work were determined using the DFT method implemented in the Vienna Ab-initio Simulation Package (VASP) code, which adopts a plane-wave based pseudopotential formalism. In our calculations, the exchange-correlation effects were described using Perdew, Burke and Ernzerhof (PBE) function [26] under generalized gradient approximation (GGA);[27] the core electrons were represented by the projector augmented wave (PAW) pseudo-potentials [28] ,[29] and the valence electrons were described by plane wave basis set; and the plane wave cutoff energy was set at 600 eV. For Brillouin zone integration, we used 15 × 15 × 15 Monkhorst-Pack k-point mesh for the bulk (unit cell) calculations and 4 × 4 × 1 mesh for the surface (slab) calculations. Spin-polarization was included in all the calculations. The MethfesselPaxon method was employed to determine electron occupancies with a smearing parameter, σ of 0.2 eV. The convergence criteria of the electronic self-consistent iteration and the atomic force relaxation were set to be 105 eV and 0.01 eV/Å, respectively.
In its equilibrium form, Pt3Ni crystal assumes an L12 crystal structure in which one Ni atom lies at the corner and three Pt atoms lie at the face centers of a face-centered cubic crystal structure. The lattice parameter of Pt3Ni (L12) crystal was predicted from our DFT calculations to be 3.885 Å, which is merely about 1.2% larger than the experimental data of 3.84 Å [30] . We modeled the (111) surface using a surface slab in a periodic super cell, in which there were five layers of atoms and five layers of vacuum (about 11.2 Å thick) in the [111] direction normal to the surface. There were four atoms in each atomic layer corresponding to a 2 × 2 surface unit cell. Moreover, we modeled the Pt3Ni/M (111) surface by replacing one Ni atom with a transition metal M (M = Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Cu, Zr, Nb, Mo, Tc, Ru, Rh, Pd, Ag, Hf, Ta, W, Re, Os, Ir, or Au) atom in the surface slab. We restricted the location of the M atom only in the three outermost layers of the (111) surface in this study. During structural optimization, the positions of atoms in the outermost three layers were allowed to relax to the lowest energy configuration while the atoms in the bottom two layers were fixed to the positions determined by bulk Pt3Ni crystals.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Bulk-terminated Pt3Ni/M (111) surface
Shown in Fig. 1 for bulk-terminated Pt3Ni/M (111) surfaces, the doped atom of transition metal M could replace the Ni atom in the outermost ( Fig. 1 (a)), second ( Fig. 1 (b)), or third ( Fig. 1 (c)) layer of the surface. Our DFT calculations (results given in Table 1 of Supplemental Material) predicted that the lowest energy configuration of the bulk-terminated Pt3Ni/M (111) surface would be the structure as shown in Fig. 1 (a) when M were the late-transition metal elements Cu, Rh, Pd, Ag, Ir, and Au, indicating that these elements would prefer appearing in the outermost layer of the surface. In contrast, the lowest energy configuration of the bulk-terminated Pt3Ni/M (111) surface would be the structure as shown in Fig. 1 (b) when M were the transition metal elements Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Zr, Nb, Mo, Ru, Hf, Ta, W, and Os, suggesting that these elements would prefer lying in the second layer of the surface. In addition, we found that the bulk-terminated Pt3Ni/Tc and Pt3Ni/Re (111) surfaces would be most stable (having the lowest energy) by replacing the Ni atom in the third layer of the surface with the Tc or Re atoms (structure shown in Fig. 1 (c)). Consequently, our DFT results implies that as a third component metal element Cu, Rh, Pd, Ag, Ir, and Au prefer segregating to the outermost surface ( Fig. 1 (a)) while Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Zr, Nb, Mo, Tc, Ru, Hf, Ta, W, Re, and Os would like to stay in the bulk region (Figs. 1(b) or (c)) in the bulk-terminated Pt3Ni/M (111) surfaces.

3.2. Pt-segregated Pt3Ni/M (111) surface
In the bulk-terminated Pt3Ni/M (111) surfaces, there are always 75 at.% Pt at each surface layer. In contrast, the outermost surface layer will be composed with pure Pt (namely, 100 at.% Pt) in a Pt-segregated Pt3Ni/M (111) surface. As shown in Fig. 2 , there are four possible structural configurations when we used a third element M atom to replace a Ni atom in our modeled Pt-segregated Pt3Ni/M (111) surfaces. In Structure I ( Fig. 2 (a)), transition metals M and Ni are mixed together and enrich the second layer of the surface; In Structure II ( Fig. 2 (b)), only Ni enriches the second layer while transition metal M occupies the third layer of the surface; In Structure III ( Fig. 2 (c)), transition metal M and Ni are mixed together and enrich the third layer of the surface; while in Structure IV ( Fig. 2 (d)), Ni enriches the third layer while transition metal M occupies the second layer of the surface.

Distinct from the bulk-terminated Pt3Ni/M (111) surface (shown in Fig. 1 ), the outermost layer was pure Pt, the second layer was composed with (a) 50 at.% Pt, 25 at.% Ni, and 25 at.% M, (b) 50 at.% Pt and 50 at.% Ni, (c) 75 at.% Pt and 25 at.% Ni, or (d) 75 at.% Pt and 25 at.% M, and the third layer was composed with (a) 75 at.% Pt and 25 at.% Ni, (b) 75 at.% Pt and 25 at.% M, (c) 50 at.% Pt, 25 at.% Ni, and 25 at.% M, or (d) 50 at.% Pt and 50 at.% Ni, in the Pt-segregated Pt3Ni/M (111) surface. In the figure, purple balls represent Pt atoms, dark blue balls represent Ni atoms, and light blue balls represent M atoms, respectively.
With DFT optimization calculations, we found in Table 1 among the four possible structures of the Pt-segregated Pt3Ni/M (111) surfaces that Structure I was the lowest energy configuration when M was element Mn, Cu, Rh, Pd, Ag or Au; Structure II was the lowest energy configuration when M was element Ti, V, Cr, Fe, Co, Nb, Mo, Tc, Ru, Ta, W, Re, or Os; Structure III was the lowest energy configuration only when M was element Ir; and Structure IV was the lowest energy configuration when M was element Zr or Hf. Previous studies [31] ,[32] have pointed out that the enrichment of transition metals in the second surface layer was beneficial in tailoring the electronic structure and catalytic behavior of the outermost layer of Pt. Hence, Structure I and II above would be much desirable for the purpose of catalyst design. Hence, most transition metals (except Ir, Zr, and Hf) were predicted from our DFT calculations to maintain the desired segregation of Pt to the outermost layer as well as the enrichment of transition metals in the sub-surface layer in their energetically favorable configurations of the Pt-segregated Pt3Ni/M (111) surfaces as that in the Pt-segregated Pt3Ni (111) surface.
3.3. Pt surface segregation energy in Pt3Ni/M (111) surface
Surface segregation energy, which is the driving force of segregating one component of the alloy to the surface, can be defined as the difference in the configuration energies of the alloy surfaces with that component atom in the surface layer and in the bulk [21] . For the Pt3Ni (111) surface, Pt surface segregation energy can be evaluated as the energy difference between the Pt-segregated surface model [in which the outmost layer has 100 at.% Pt and the second layer has 50 at.% Pt (and 50 at.% Ni)] and the bulk-terminated surface model [in which each layer has 75 at.% Pt (and 25 at.% Ni)]. Following this definition, we calculated the Pt surface segregation energy in the Pt3Ni (111) surface to be  0.399 eV, close to  0.38 eV calculated by Ma et al.
[33] . Negative sign here indicates that the Pt-segregated Pt3Ni (111) surface was more energetically favorable than the bulk-terminated one, hence Pt was predicted to segregate to the outermost layer of the Pt3Ni (111) surface. This is consistent with the experimental observation [17] .When replacing one Ni atom with an atom of element M in the Pt3Ni (111) surface model, there are three distinct structures for the bulk-terminated Pt3Ni/M (111) surface (shown in Fig. 1 ) and four distinct structures for the Pt-segregated Pt3Ni/M (111) surface (shown in Fig. 2 ). The calculated differences (given in Table 1 ) between the energies of the four Pt-segregated surfaces and the energy of the lowest-energy bulk-terminated surface (identified in Section 3.1) could indicate whether the Pt atoms would favor segregation to the outermost layer of the Pt3Ni/M (111) surface or not. In this work, the Pt surface segregation energy in the Pt3Ni/M (111) surface was defined as the difference between the energy of the lowest-energy configuration of the Pt-segregated surface (given in Section 3.2) and the energy of the lowest-energy configuration of the bulk-terminated surface (given in Section 3.1).
In Fig. 3 , we plotted the calculated Pt surface segregation energy in the Pt3Ni/M (111) surface as a function of the number of the d electrons of the doped metal M. Following the definition, positive Pt surface segregation energy implies that transition metal M would suppress the Pt segregation to the Pt3Ni/M (111) surface while negative Pt surface segregation energy implies that transition metal M would keep the extent of Pt segregation to the Pt3Ni/M (111) surface. For 4 d and 5 d transition metals, our results in Fig. 3 showed that those elements with half-filled d band could further decrease the Pt surface segregation energy while those elements with nearly-filled d band would increase the Pt surface segregation energy in the Pt3Ni/M (111) surface as compared with that in the based Pt3Ni (111) surface. For 3 d transition metals, our results exhibited that the calculated Pt surface segregation energies in the Pt3Ni/M (111) surface did not vary much with the number of the d electrons of metal M. Specifically, our results in Fig. 3 indicated that replacing some Ni with metal M (M = V, Fe, Co, Mo, Tc, Ru, W, Re, Os, or Ir) could result in even more negative Pt surface segregation energy in the Pt3Ni/M (111) surface than that in the based Pt3Ni (111) surface. In contrast, doping transition metal M (M = Ag, Au, or Pd) would lead to positive segregation energies and hence suppress the Pt surface segregation in the corresponding Pt3Ni/M (111) surface. Our theoretical predictions here about metals Ag, Au, and Pd concur with the experimental observations that Ag, Au, and Pd prefer segregating themselves (instead of Pt) to the surface of binary alloys Pt-Au,[34] ,[35] Pt-Ag [36] and Pt-Pd [37] ,[38] .

The upper dash line indicates where the Pt surface segregation energy is equal to zero and the lower dash line indicates where the Pt surface segregation energy is equal to  0.399 eV (which is the calculated Pt surface segregation energy in the based Pt3Ni (111) surface).
3.4. Factors affecting Pt surface segregation energy in Pt3Ni/M (111) surface
For binary alloys, three major physical mechanisms are believed to govern the surface segregation process [39] . (1) Surface energy effect: the component (in its pure element form) with lower surface energy will segregate to the alloy surface; (2) Strain effect: when the atomic sizes of the two components are dramatically different, one component (normally, the one with larger size) will segregate to the surface to reduce the strain energy in the alloys; and (3) Heat of solution effect: if the heat of solution is negative, the majority component of the alloy will enrich the surface to maximize the mixing of the two components in the bulk.
However, it is not well understood how adding a third component could improve or suppress the surface segregation process in the based binary alloy. In particular, it is of great interest to study how we can qualitatively estimate the influence of a third component M on the Pt surface segregation energy in the Pt3Ni/M (111) surface mainly based on the material properties of the constituent binary alloys. To gain knowledge on this issue, we attempted to examine the relation between the predicted Pt surface segregation energy in the Pt3Ni/M (111) surface and the relative material properties of the binary alloys Pt3M with respect to those of Pt3Ni. In this work, transition metal M was added into the (111) surface of the L12 Pt3Ni crystal. Consequently, we computed the lattice parameter and the heat of solution of the bulk Pt3M crystal with an L12 structure and the Pt surface segregation energy in the L12 Pt3M (111) surface. Our calculation results are presented in Table 2 .

For the Pt3Ni alloy, our DFT calculations predicted its equilibrium lattice parameter to be 3.884 Å and the Pt surface segregation energy in its (111) surface to be  0.399 eV. In Fig. 4 , we thus plotted the correlation between our calculated Pt surface segregation energy in the Pt3Ni/M (111) surface and these two relative quantities.

Diagrams showing the correlation between the Pt surface segregation energy in the Pt3Ni/M (111) surface and the relative properties (lattice parameter and Pt surface segregation energy) of the Pt3M crystal with respect to those of the Pt3Ni crystal. In the figure, circles represent transition metals M (the corresponding element type is marked beside the circle). Here, a color code is employed to represent the range of the magnitude of the Pt surface segregation in the Pt3Ni/M (111) surface. Blue indicates that the Pt surface segregation energy is larger than or equal to 0; green indicates that the Pt surface segregation energy is less than 0 but larger than or equal to  0.399 eV (Note: it is the Pt surface segregation energy in the Pt3Ni (111) surface); and red indicates that the Pt surface segregation energy is less than  0.399 eV. Dashed squares are used to enclose all the transition metals M leading to the Pt surface segregation energies less than  0.399 eV.
First, relative Pt surface segregation energy gauges the difference in the extent of Pt segregation to the Pt3M and Pt3Ni (111) surfaces and can be considered as a quantity measuring the energetic change of the Pt3Ni/M (111) surface after replacing Ni with transition metal M. Our results in Fig. 4 suggest that this surface energy effect be quite influential in determining the Pt surface segregation energy in the Pt3Ni/M (111) surface. Re, W, Tc, Os, Mo, Ru, Co, Ir, and Fe were the only transition metal elements predicted to have negative relative Pt surface segregation energies in this work and all were found to have Pt surface segregation energy in the Pt3Ni/M (111) surface less than  0.399 eV (Pt surface segregation energy in the Pt3Ni (111) surface). Conversely, the other transition metals (with an exception of V) were predicted to have positive relative Pt surface segregation energies and were found to have the Pt surface segregation energy in the Pt3Ni/M (111) surface higher than  0.399 eV. Although having a positive relative Pt surface segregation energy of 0.047 eV, V still caused stronger Pt segregation to the Pt3Ni/V (111) surface than the replaced Ni. Therefore, our result for V shows that it is not always reliable to predict the extent of the Pt segregation in the ternary Pt3Ni/M (111) surface simply by comparing the Pt surface segregation energies in the corresponding binary Pt3M and Pt3Ni (111) surfaces.
Second, strain effect was considered to be the more prominent force driving the larger Pt component atoms to the surface of the based Pt3Ni (111) surfaces.
[23] Moreover, it is noticeable in Fig. 4 that the lattice mismatches between the Pt3M and Pt3Ni crystals were positive for all the transition metals M studied in this work. It means that replacing some Ni atoms with the M atoms in the based Pt3Ni crystal would always induce tensile strain, which would favor segregating the largest component atoms to the surface of the alloy. One way to compare the atomic size of different component metal elements is to compare the nearest neighbor distance in their single crystals. It was found from our DFT calculations ( Table 2 of Supplemental Materials) that the atomic size of the transition metals studied in this work had an increasing order from Fe, Cr, Co, Ni, Mn, Cu, V, Ru, Os, Rh, Tc, Mo, Ir, W, Re, Pd, Pt, Ta, Nb, Ti, Ag, Au, Hf, to Zr in their single crystals. We noticed from our results in Fig. 3 that all the transition metals M, which were predicted to further decrease the Pt surface segregation energy in the Pt3Ni/M (111) surface than that ( 0.399 eV) in the Pt3Ni (111) surface, are smaller than the Pt atoms. Following this rule, replacing Ni with V (smaller than Pt) in the Pt3Ni/V (111) surface could induce tensile strain in the based Pt3Ni crystal lattice and thus further promote the segregation of the largest component (Pt) atoms to the outermost surface layer. This appears to provide an explanation why the Pt surface segregation energy in the Pt3Ni/V (111) surface ( 0.469 eV) is lower than  0.399 eV even if the Pt surface segregation energy in the Pt3V (111) surface ( 0.347 eV) is higher than  0.399 eV. However, Rh would cause the same strain effect in the Pt3Ni/Rh (111) surface as that in the Pt3Ni/V (111) surface but still have a Pt surface segregation energy ( 0.315 eV) higher than  0.399 eV in the Pt3Ni/Rh (111) surface. To resolve this contradiction, we must also take the heat of solution effect into consideration as discussed below.
The third effect should be considered is the heat of solution effect. The calculated heat of solution in Table 2 quantifies the strength of the Pt-M bond in the L12 Pt3M crystal. Large negative heat of solution implies strong mixing tendency among the Pt and M atoms in the bulk region and hence causes strong Pt (the majority component) segregation to the Pt3Ni/M (111) surface. The heats of solution for the Pt3V, Pt3Ni, and Pt3Rh crystal were calculated to be  0.433 eV/atom, -0.115 eV/atom, and  0.011 eV/atom, respectively. Therefore, adding V into the based Pt3Ni alloy would further decrease the heat of solution of the ternary alloy and thus promote the Pt segregation to the Pt3Ni/V (111) surface. In contrast, adding Rh into the Pt3Ni alloy would increase the heat of solution of the ternary alloy and thus does not help Pt segregating to the Pt3Ni/Rh (111) surface. Considering both strain and heat of solution effects, we can better understand why the Pt surface segregation energy in the Pt3Ni/V (111) surface was found to be lower than  0.399 eV while the Pt surface segregation energy in the Pt3Ni/Rh (111) surface higher than  0.399 eV.
Moreover, the heat of solution effect offers explanation to another puzzling observation found in Fig. 4 and Table 2 . The calculated Pt surface segregation energy in the Pt3Hf, Pt3Zr, and Pt3Ti (111) surfaces are positive and even higher than those in the Pt3Au and Pt3Ag (111) surfaces. In addition, the Hf, Zr, and Ti atoms are found to be larger than the Pt atoms in the Pt3Ni/M (111) surface ( Table 2 of Supplemental Materials). Consequently, both surface energy effect and strain effect would have caused much weaker Pt surface segregation (i.e., more positive Pt surface segregation energy) in the Pt3Ni/Hf, Pt3Ni/Zr, and Pt3Ni/Ti (111) surfaces than in the Pt3Ni/Au and Pt3Ni/Ag (111) surfaces. In contrary, our DFT calculations predicted the lower Pt surface segregation energy in the Pt3Ni/Hf, Pt3Ni/Zr, and Pt3Ni/Ti (111) surfaces ( 0.279 eV, -0.302 eV, and  0.343 eV, respectively) as compared with + 0.448 eV in the Pt3Ni/Au (111) surface and + 0.297 eV in the Pt3Ni/Ag (111) surface. The solution to this puzzle lies on the heat of solution effect to the surface segregation process. Given in Table 2 , the heats of solution for the Pt3Hf, Pt3Zr, and Pt3Ti crystal were calculated to be  1.108 eV, -1.031 eV, and  0.838 eV (much more negative than  0.068 eV for Pt3Ni crystal), respectively. In contrast, the calculated heat of solution were + 0.057 eV for the Pt3Au, and + 0.030 for the Pt3Ag. Therefore, doping Hf, Zr, or Ti into the based Pt3Ni alloy could dramatically decrease the heat of solution of the ternary alloys and this process would significantly favor the majority component Pt segregation to the corresponding Pt3Ni/M (111) surfaces.
As discussed above, the surface energy effect (relative Pt surface segregation energy), the strain effect (lattice mismatch), and the heat of solution effect collectively influence the values of the Pt surface segregation energy in the Pt3Ni/M (111) surfaces.
4. Conclusions
In this work, we have investigated the effect of the third component element M on the Pt surface segregation energy in the Pt3Ni/M (111) surfaces using the DFT calculation method. Our results indicated that the third component metal could appreciably alter the extent of Pt surface segregation to the Pt3Ni/M (111) surface as compared with that in the binary Pt3Ni (111) surface. It was found that replacing Ni with transition metals V, Fe, Co, Mo, Tc, Ru, W, Re, Os, and Ir would lead to even stronger Pt segregation extent to the surface while replacing Ni with transition metals Ag, Au, and Pd could completely prohibit Pt segregating to the surface. Although with a less extent than metal Ni, transition metals Ti, Mn, Cr, Cu, Zr, Nb, Rh, Hf, and Ta were predicted to still promote the Pt segregation to the Pt3Ni/M (111) surfaces as the third component replacing Ni. Among all the metals studied, Re was found to be the most efficient third component to promote the Pt segregation to the outermost layer of the Pt3Ni/M (111) surface.
Furthermore, we explored the relation between the calculated Pt surface segregation energy in the Pt3Ni/M (111) surfaces and the relative changes in the properties (lattice parameter, heat of solution, and Pt surface segregation energy) of the binary alloys Pt3M and Pt3Ni. Our major findings were: (1) Relative Pt surface segregation energy, a comparison between the Pt surface segregation energies in the Pt3M and Pt3Ni (111) surfaces, exhibits the difference for elements M and Ni in promoting the Pt surface segregation in their corresponding Pt binary alloy surfaces. In this work, we found that in most cases the calculated relative Pt surface segregation energies for binary alloys were consistent with the variation of the Pt surface segregation energies in the Pt3Ni/M (111) as compared with that in the Pt3Ni (111) surface. (2) Adding a third transition metal into the Pt3Ni crystal induced tensile strain which would drive the largest component atoms segregate to the outermost surface layer. Hence, those transition metals with atomic size smaller than Pt would better maintain the extent of the Pt surface segregation to the Pt3Ni/M (111) surfaces. (3) The heat of solution of the Pt3M crystal manifests how strong the bonding between the Pt and M atoms in an L12 crystal lattice. If the heat of solution of the Pt3M is more negative than that of the Pt3Ni, doping M into the based Pt3Ni crystal would decrease the heat of solution of the resultant ternary alloy. It was found that a decreased heat of solution of alloys could promote the surface segregation of the majority component Pt in the Pt3Ni/M (111) surfaces.In particular, our study obtained some useful insights for developing low-cost yet high performance Pt alloys as the electrocatalysts for ORR. First, we identified that V, Fe, Co, Mo, Tc, Ru, W, Re, Os, and Ir could further enhance the Pt surface segregation as a third component metal replacing Ni in the Pt-Ni alloys. Second, it was predicted that the Pt-segregated Pt3Ni/Mn, Pt3Ni/Cu, and Pt3Ni/Rh (111) surface would have a structure (shown in Fig. 2 (a)) in which the outermost layer was composed with pure Pt while the second sub-layer consisted of 50 at% Pt, 25 at.% Ni, and 25 at.% M. Controlling the degree of this enrichment of Ni and M beneath the pure Pt outermost layer enables us to tailor the surface electronic structure of these Pt ternary alloys.
In this work, we only added one transition metal M atom into the based Pt3Ni (111) surface and investigated the effect of M on the Pt segregation in the Pt3Ni/M (111) surface. Thus, our conclusions presented here are only rigorously applicable to those ternary alloys with dilute third component M. Nonetheless, the acquired knowledge on how a third transition metal component alters the surface energy, lattice strain, and heat of solution of the based Pt3Ni crystal, and subsequently the Pt surface segregation energy in the Pt3Ni/M (111) surface could guide the development of the low-cost, high-performance, and long-durability Pt ternary alloy catalysts for fuel cell applications.
