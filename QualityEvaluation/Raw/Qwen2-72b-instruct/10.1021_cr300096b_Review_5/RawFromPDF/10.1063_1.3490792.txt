We investigated the surface segregation phenomena in the (111) surface of ordered
Pt

Ti
crystal using density functional theory (DFT) calculation (with no configuration sampling) and Monte Carlo (MC) simulation method (employing modified embedded atom method potentials and with extensive configuration sampling). Our DFT study suggested that the off-stoichiometric effect (specifically, a Pt concentration higher than

Pt

Ti
(111) surface would downshift by 0.21 eV as compared to that of a pure Pt (111) surface. As a result, O adsorption energy on the Pt-segregated
Pt

Ti
(111) surface was found to be at least 0.16 eV weaker than that on the pure Pt (111) surface. Thus, we theoretically modeled the geometric and electronic structures of the Pt-segregated

I. INTRODUCTION
The surface segregation process in alloy materials normally causes their chemical composition in the surface region to differ from their bulk composition. Thus, the surface segregation phenomenon in materials significantly influences material properties such as adsorption, wetting, oxidation, corrosion, electrical contact, friction and wear, crystal growth, and catalysis.1,2 Surface segregation can occur in both disordered and ordered alloys. For disordered binary alloys (or binary solid solutions), there are three major physical mechanisms that promote surface segregation. (1) If the heat of the solution is negative, the majority component of the alloy will enrich the surface to maximize the mixing of the two components in bulk. (2) When the atomic sizes of the two components are dramatically different, one component will segregate to the surface to reduce strain energy in the alloys. (3) The component (in its pure element form) with a lower surface energy will segregate to the alloy surface. The surface segregation process in disordered alloys is always exothermic and accompanies a decrease in system configurational entropy. On the other hand, the surface segregation process in ordered binary alloys increases system configurational entropy and, hence, can be either endothermic or exothermic.3 Besides (1)–(3) above, surface segregation in ordered alloys can be a result of the generation and motion of antisite defects due to the off-stoichiometric effect.4 Theoretically predicting surface segregation in binary alloys has long been pursued.5–15 In particular, microscopic theories, involving both evaluating energies with some theoretical models [for examples, tight-binding theory (TBT),8 embedded atom method (EAM),9 density functional theory (DFT)]10 and sampling distinct configurations using statistical mechanics methods,11–15 have been widely employed to attain the equilibrium compositions of alloy surfaces. Most previous work has studied the surface segregation in disordered alloy systems. In the present work, we applied the same computational approach to predicting the surface segregation in ordered
Pt
3
Ti
(platinum-titanium) crystal.
Catalytic activities of bimetallic alloys are mainly determined by their surface structure and composition. Consequently, we can take advantage of surface segregation to design and synthesize high-activity catalysts. For instance, Pt is an efficient catalyst in many important chemical reactions, such as
O
2
reduction and hydrocarbon reforming. However, Pt is a precious metal. It is desirable to develop new catalysts with reduced Pt content yet good performance. For this reason, many researchers have focused on studying Pt-based bimetallic alloys, in which some of the Pt content was replaced with less expensive metals.16–23 It was further found that due to surface segregation, some Pt binary alloys had enhanced activities for oxygen reduction reactions (ORRs).17,20,22,24 For example, surface segregation leads to 100% Pt in the outermost layer, but only 50% Pt (i.e., 50% Ni) in the sublayer of the
Pt
3
Ni
(111) surface. The Ni atoms beneath the Pt monolayer shift the
d
electron band of the Pt toward a higher catalytic activity for the ORR.20 To rationally design Pt alloy catalysts using the surface segregation process, it is essential to establish the correlation between surface composition and catalytic activities of the alloys. To this end, more efforts have been devoted to either experimentally examining the catalytic activities23–27 or theoretically determining the
d
electron band structures19 for monolayer metals deposited on Pt. In this work, we first predicted the composition of the
Pt
3
Ti
(111) surface by simulating the surface segregation process, and then we calculated the electronic structure and the O adsorption on the Pt-segregated
Pt
3
Ti
(111) surface using a first-principles DFT method. This study provides us insights about how surface segregation may alter the catalytic performance of
Pt
3
Ti
crystal.
Pt–Ti alloys have a large negative heat of solution because of the strong bonding interactions in the
d
-orbitals of the Pt and Ti atoms. This property leads to the superior chemical stability of
Pt
3
Ti
crystal. Moreover,
Pt
3
Ti
crystal has quite good catalytic performance for ORRs. It was found that carbon-supported
Pt
75
Ti
25
nanoparticles displayed a twofold improvement in catalytic activities (or a 20 mV shift to a higher potential) toward molecular oxygen electroreduction, as compared to a benchmark Pt/C catalyst.28,29 As for the surface segregation in
Pt
3
Ti
crystal, low energy electron diffraction (LEED) structural analysis found that in the (111) surface, one pure Pt outermost layer will be formed on top of the bulk lattice structure of the
Pt
3
Ti
⁠,30 while in the (001) surface, the bulk-terminated pure Pt layer will be the outermost layer.31 With ultraviolet photoemission spectroscopy, Mun et al. observed that the position of the
d
-band center of
Pt
3
Ti
polycrystals moves away from the Fermi level after annealing in a vacuum, suggesting the formation of a pure Pt outermost surface layer.18 The surface segregation process in ordered
Pt
3
Ti
crystal is quite different from other disordered Pt alloys.11–14 Theoretical calculations showed that the surface segregation phenomena in most Pt alloys (like
Pt
3
Co
⁠,
Pt
3
Ni
⁠, and
Pt
3
Fe
⁠) could be explained by simply exchanging the Pt atoms in the sublayer with the second-element atoms in the outermost layer. However, the same study found out that surface segregation in
Pt
3
Ti
could not be obtained in this way.32 In this work, we elaborated on the surface segregation process in the (111) surface of ordered
Pt
3
Ti
crystal using atomistic modeling techniques.
II. COMPUTATION METHODS
A. Density functional theory calculations
In this work, a first-principles DFT33,34 method was employed to determine some bulk and surface properties of Pt–Ti alloys. In particular, we used the DFT method to study the possible routes for Pt segregating to the (111) surface of
Pt
3
Ti
crystal. We used the Vienna Ab Initio Simulation Package (VASP) for these calculations.35 The DFT calculations were performed with the projector augmented wave and the pseudopotential approach.36,37 The generalized gradient approximation with the PW91 functional by Perdew and co-workers38,39 was used for evaluating the exchange-correlation energy. The plane-wave cutoff energy was set to 600 eV in all the calculations. A

B. The Monte Carlo method
In this article, the Monte Carlo (MC) method based upon the Metropolis algorithm40 was employed to simulate the surface segregation process in the
Pt
3
Ti
alloys considering configuration sampling at high temperatures. At a given temperature, the probability
P
X
Y
of a configuration transformation (from
X
to
Y
⁠) is determined by the Boltzmann factor (distribution function) of the energy change
(

of a system,

,
(1)
where
k
B
is the Boltzmann constant and
T
is the temperature. Starting from an initially assumed configuration, configuration transformations were tried at each simulation step. In our MC algorithm, the new configuration was always retained if
P
X
Y
≥
1
(energy decreases); while when
P
X
Y
<
1
(energy increases), the new configuration was kept only if
P
X
Y
was larger than a computer-generated random number (which ranged from 0 to 1).
Starting from an initial structure of the
Pt
3
Ti
(111) surface, we randomly picked a pair of Pt and Ti atoms and attempted to exchange their positions using Eq. (1) at each MC step. After repeating such operations millions of times, our MC simulation was able to yield a succession of atomic configurations distributed according to the canonical ensemble. Furthermore, the material properties of our simulated alloy systems can be evaluated through averaging the values of these quantities from the equilibrated configurations.
In this work, the energy change
Δ
E
[in Eq. (1)] was evaluated using our developed modified embedded atom method (MEAM) atomic interaction potentials for Pt–Ti alloys. In the frame of the MEAM, the total energy of a system,

where
ρ
¯
i
is the background charge density of atom
i
due to superposition of individual electron density from its neighboring atoms. In the frame of previous EAMs,41,42 such charge density depended only on atomic separation distances. As an improvement, the new atomic charge density in the MEAM consisted of both radial and angular contributions from neighboring atoms.43,44 In Eq. (2), the first term
F
(

is an embedding function of atom

⁠, while the second term
Φ
(

is the core-core repulsive pairwise interaction between atoms

and

⁠. Moreover, the current MEAM in our modeling work considered only the nearest-neighboring interactions, thus a screening procedure was adopted in defining the nearest neighbors for an atom. Regarding detailed information of the MEAM potentials for alloy systems, see Refs. 12, 45, and 46.
III. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
A. DFT study of surface segregation in
Pt
3
Ti
(111)
In its equilibrium form, the
Pt
3
Ti
alloy adopts an
L
1
2
crystal structure in which one Ti atom lies at the corner and three Pt atoms lie at the face centers of a face-centered cubic lattice. The lattice parameter of the
Pt
3
Ti
(
L
1
2
)
crystal was predicted from our DFT calculations to be 3.956 Å, which is about 1.28% larger than the experimental data of 3.906 Å.47 We modeled the bulk-terminated (111) surface of the
Pt
3
Ti
crystal with a surface slab (having two surfaces) in a periodic super cell, in which there were eight atomic layers and a 12 Å thick vacuum in the [111] direction normal to the surface. At each atomic layer, there were four atoms (three Pt atoms and one Ti atom) in a surface unit cell, as shown in Fig. 1(a). Furthermore, we modeled the Pt-segregated
Pt
3
Ti
(111) surfaces by changing the outermost layer of the bulk-terminated
Pt
3
Ti
(111) to a pure Pt layer (i.e., four Pt atoms but no Ti atoms). Then, we fully relaxed the atomic structures of all the modeled surface slabs with the DFT method. Comparing the energies of these optimized surface models, we examined two possible routes for the Pt to segregate to the outermost layer of the
Pt
3
Ti
(111).

crystal.
Route I: Direct exchange. In this route, the segregation of the Pt atoms to the outermost layer of the
Pt
3
Ti
(111) surface was accomplished by exchanging the positions of the surface Ti atoms with the interior Pt atoms. To examine this route, we computed the Pt surface segregation energy, which is the energy difference between Pt-segregated and bulk-terminated
Pt
3
Ti
(111) surface models. The Pt-segregated surface model was constructed by exchanging the Ti atom in the outermost layer with a Pt atom at a subsurface layer of the bulk-terminated
Pt
3
Ti
(111) model. Negative Pt surface segregation energy indicates that it was an exothermal process for the Pt atoms to segregate to the surface. Table I gives the calculated Pt surface segregation energies based on this route. Our results show that the Pt surface segregation energies were positive for exchanging the surface Ti atom with the Pt atom in the second, third, and fourth sublayers. Consequently, it was not energetically favorable for Pt atoms to segregate to the surface through this direct exchange route at low temperatures. Moreover, the calculated Pt surface segregation energy increased with the sequence number of the sublayer (where the exchanged Pt atom came from). Thus, exchanging the surface Ti atom with the second layer Pt atom led to the lowest Pt surface segregation energy, which is calculated here to be 0.68 eV and is in exact agreement with the previous DFT study.32

Third layer  1.78  1.30 
Fourth layer  1.97  1.28 
Route II: Antisite migration. In this route, the segregation of Pt atoms to the outermost layer of the
Pt
3
Ti
(111) surface was achieved by migrating Pt antisites to the surface. An antisite is an off-stoichiometric structural defect existing in ordered alloys.48 In this work, a Pt antisite (denoted as
Pt
Ti
⁠) refers to a Ti atom replaced by a Pt atom in the ordered
Pt
3
Ti
crystal [Fig. 1(b)], while a Ti antisite (denoted as
Ti
Pt
⁠) refers to a Pt atom replaced by a Ti atom [Fig. 1(c)]. For this route, surface segregation energy was evaluated as the energy difference between the
Pt
3
Ti
(111) surface slab model having an antisite defect in its surface region (at the first, second, and third atomic layers) and the one having an antisite in the bulk region (at the fourth atomic layer). We listed in Table II the calculated surface segregation energies from the DFT calculations. Our results in Table II show that it was most energetically favorable (gaining 1.25 eV) for
Pt
Ti
(i.e., excess Pt atoms) to migrate from bulk to the outermost layer of the
Pt
3
Ti
(111) surface. In contrast, it was energetically favorable (gaining 0.37 eV) for
Ti
Pt
(i.e., excess Ti atoms) to migrate from the outermost layer to the interior layers of the
Pt
3
Ti
(111) surface. Thus, our results infer that the off-stoichiometric effect in the
Pt
3
Ti
crystals could have caused the
Pt
Ti
atoms to segregate to the outermost surface layer (when the Pt concentration was above
75
at
.
%
⁠) or the
Ti
Pt
atoms to move inside to the bulk (when the Pt concentration was below
75
at
.
%
⁠).

Third layer  −0.18  0.00  −0.10  −0.02 
In summary, our DFT calculations above suggest that a direct exchange route requires at least 0.68 eV of energy to segregate Pt to the outermost layer of the
Pt
3
Ti
(111) surface; hence, it is not energetically favorable. In contrast, an antisite migration route is energetically favorable to segregate
Pt
Ti
to the outermost layer of the
Pt
3
Ti
(111) surface. Here, we would like to make some further comments on our DFT calculation study of the surface segregation in the
Pt
3
Ti
(111) surface. First, we have fully optimized the atomic structures and thus included strain relaxation in our DFT calculations. Without structural relaxation, the calculated Pt surface segregation energies would have been about 0.4 eV higher than those values in Table I for a direct exchange route and would have differed by about 0.1 eV from those values in Table II for an antisite migration route. However, no qualitative change (positive or negative sign change) in the Pt surface segregation energy was found. This indicates that the structural relaxation process did not alter the surface segregation process in the
Pt
3
Ti
(111) surface. Second, it can be considered that two antisite defects are generated in a direct exchange route, but only one antisite defect is generated in an antisite migration route. Consequently, the calculated Pt surface segregation energies (Table I for the direct exchange route and Table II for the antisite migration route) should not be directly compared with each other. Third, our calculated surface segregation energies in Tables I and II are the energy differences between the initial and final configurations during the Pt segregation process. Hence, our DFT calculations here indicate only the thermodynamic feasibility of a Pt segregation route, but not the exact migration paths and their corresponding energy barriers. In kinetics, both routes consist of multiple atomic diffusion processes through
Pt
3
Ti
crystal.
B. MC study of surface segregation in
Pt
3
Ti
(111)
DFT calculations are very accurate in predicting material system geometries and energies at 0 K. However, prohibitively high computation resources are required to reasonably sample possible configurations of the material system at high temperatures. In order to take a configurational entropy contribution into account when studying the surface segregation of
Pt
3
Ti
(111), we employed both the MC simulation method to generate a configuration ensemble and the MEAM to evaluate the energies of various configurations.
1. Developing MEAM potentials for Pt–Ti alloys
In this work, the MEAM potentials for pure Pt and Ti metals were similar to those in Refs. 43 and 44, with some renormalized scaling factors in the atomic charge densities. To develop the Pt–Ti alloy potential, the
Pt
3
Ti
crystal [
L
1
2
-type, Fig. 2(a)] was taken as the reference phase. The same formula of the cross part describing Pt–Ti interactions was adopted in Refs. 11, 12, and 14.

The parameters of the developed MEAM potential for the Pt–Ti alloy are given in Table III. In Table IV, we report the angular screening factors for this potential. The surface energy of pure component metals is an important factor in affecting surface segregation phenomena in binary alloys. Hence, Table V gives the predicted surface energies of pure Pt and Ti metals using the developed Pt–Ti MEAM potential. Our calculated surface energies for pure hcp Ti metals agree excellently with the published DFT calculation results.49 Though lower than the DFT results, our calculated surface energies for pure fcc Pt are in quite good agreement with the earlier results from Ref. 43 by Baskes.

Further, we checked the transferability of our developed potential by comparing our MEAM and DFT calculation results for PtTi [

PtTi

[

2
⁠, Fig. 2(c), and

⁠, Fig. 2(d)] crystals. Table VI shows our results from the MEAM potential calculations, which are in good agreement with those from the DFT calculations. Particularly, both the MEAM and the DFT results point out that
PtTi
3
crystal would have a lower cohesive energy in an
A
15
than in an
L
1
2
crystal structure. This prediction is consistent with the experimental observation that
A
15
is the equilibrium lattice structure for the
PtTi
3
crystal.50 Moreover, we used our MEAM potential to calculate the surface segregation energy (in diluted limits, as defined in Ref. 10) of a Pt atom in the hcp Ti (0001) surface and a Ti atom in the fcc Pt (111) surface. We found the surface segregation energy of Pt atom in Ti to be −1.34 eV (compared with −0.72 eV from the DFT calculations)10 and the Ti atom in Pt to be 1.23 eV (compared with 0.66 eV from the DFT calculations).10 Despite the noticeable discrepancy in their absolute values, both the MEAM and the DFT methods predicted that Pt would segregate to the close-packed surface of the Pt–Ti alloys. We also calculated the Pt surface segregation energies specifically for
Pt
3
Ti
(111), assuming the direct and antisite migration routes with the developed MEAM potential. Our MEAM results in Tables I and II are in qualitative agreement (having the same positive or negative sign) with those results from our DFT calculations, although the discrepancy in their absolute values are noticeable in some cases. It was found to be very difficult for the MEAM to faithfully reproduce all the data yielded by the DFT calculations. Therefore, our current approach was to make our MEAM potential to best reproduce the DFT energetic data in Table II for
Pt
Ti
in the first surface layer and
Ti
Pt
in the second surface layer. Both of these two data are negative values and thus related to the most favorable moves occurring in the surface in our subsequent MC simulations.

2. Simulating surface segregation of

Ti
(111)
Pt

Ti
alloy crystal has a rather high order-disorder transition temperature,
>
1800
K
according to experimental measurements.51 In this work, we chose to study the surface segregation phenomena at 1100 K. Consequently, we needed to ensure that our developed MEAM potentials would predict an ordered phase of
Pt
3
Ti
at 1100 K. To this end, we used the MC simulation method to determine the variation of the Bragg–Williams long-range order (LRO) parameter52,53 of the
Pt
3
Ti
crystal as a function of temperature. In evaluating the LRO parameter, we divided the
L
1
2
lattice of the
Pt
3
Ti
crystal [Fig. 2(a)] into two sublattices:
α
(three face-center positions) and
β
(one corner position). The LRO parameter of the
Pt
3
Ti
crystal was calculated using the expression
(
P
Pt
α
−
0.75
)
/
0.25
⁠. Here,
P
Pt
α
is the probability for
α
lattice sites occupied by Pt atoms. Following this definition, LRO is 1.0 for perfectly ordered
Pt
3
Ti
crystal and 0.0 for completely disordered
Pt
3
Ti
crystal. Starting from a perfectly ordered
(
LRO
=
1.0
)
Pt
3
Ti
simulation cell (containing 500 atoms), we carried out
10
×
10
6
MC simulation steps to ensure the full convergence of system energy and we sampled the values of the LRO every 1000 steps in the last
5
×
10
6
MC simulation steps. In each MC simulation step, we attempted to exchange the positions of two randomly selected Pt and Ti atoms. After the simulation, we calculated the average of all the sampled LRO values.
Figure 3 plots the results of the calculated LRO parameters for
Pt
3
Ti
crystal in the temperature range of 1800–3400 K. The LRO values were found to be nearly 1.0 (ordered phase) below 2700 K and about 0.0 (disordered phase) above 2900 K using our developed MEAM potentials. Thus, our MC simulation predicted the critical temperature to be about 2800 K for the order-disorder transition of
Pt
3
Ti
crystal. In the experiments, the order-disorder transition temperature of the
Pt
3
Ti
crystal was found to be higher than 1800 K.51 It should be pointed out that our developed MEAM potentials also significantly overestimated the melting temperature of
Pt
3
Ti
⁠: our theoretical prediction was 3500 K, while the experimental value was 2224 K.50 In this work, we were most interested in studying the surface segregation process in ordered
Pt
3
Ti
at 1100 K. To this purpose, our MEAM potential correctly predicted an ordered
Pt
3
Ti
phase (⁠
L
1
2
-type) at 1100 K. Hence, the shortcoming of our MEAM potentials in overestimating melting temperature and order-disorder transition temperature does not affect the validity of our results about surface segregation.

To model the surface segregation process using MC simulations, we first constructed a bulk-terminated ordered
Pt
3
Ti
(111) surface slab whose normal direction was [111] and which contained 15 surface layers (32 atoms in each layer). In this stoichiometric surface model, each surface layer had

MC simulation steps. After the simulation, we calculated the average of all the sampled Pt concentrations.
In Fig. 4(a), as a function of the overall Pt concentration in the model, we plotted the calculated Pt concentrations in the first, second, and third layers of thermodynamically equilibrated

%
⁠), the outermost layer of the
Pt
3

(111) surface was Pt enriched, while the other (second and third) layers kept their Pt concentrations at

⁠. At a critical value of Pt concentration (⁠

in our case), the annealed
Pt
3
Ti
(111) surface had a special Pt-segregated structure in which pure Pt was formed in the outermost layer and ordered
Pt
3
Ti
crystal was underneath that layer. Further above that critical concentration, the extra
Pt
Ti
enriched the second and third layers of the surface. It is noticeable in Fig. 4(a) that the second surface layer always had lower Pt concentrations than the overall Pt concentrations in the model.
Moreover, our MC simulation predicted that if Pt concentration was slightly higher than
75
at
.
%
⁠, the annealed
Pt
3
Ti
(111) would have a special Pt-segregated structure: pure Pt in the outermost layer and ordered
Pt

Ti
crystal underneath. This prediction is in exact agreement with the LEED study.30 Our slab model for the
Pt
3
Ti
(111) surface has 15 atomic layers (about 32 Å thick) in the [111] direction and two outermost surface layers. Using this model, we predicted that a pure Pt outermost layer would form in
Pt
3
Ti
(111) when the overall Pt concentration was over
C
Pt
∗
=
78.3

%
⁠. Obviously, the value of
C
Pt

depends on the size of the employed model. If there were 15 000 atomic layers (about
3.2
μ

C
Pt
∗
would be
75.003
at
.
%
⁠, assuming all
Pt
Ti
atoms migrated to the outermost layers. Thus, a very slight off-stoichiometric effect in the experimental sample of
Pt
3
Ti
(111)-oriented bulk crystal (containing more Pt) could lead to the formation of a pure Pt outermost layer. This explains why the previous experimental study30 did not link the observed Pt segregation in the
Pt
3
Ti
(111) with the Pt off-stoichiometric effect in the
Pt
3
Ti
crystals. To verify our theoretical predictions presented here, thin films of Pt–Ti alloys (instead of a single crystal surface) with precisely controlled thicknesses and compositions should be used in future experimental measurements.
Examining the reliability of our results from the MC simulations, we conducted two more tests modeling the Pt surface segregation in
Pt
3
Ti
(111). In the first test, the initial structures of the
Pt
3
Ti
(111) surface slab were not constructed from bulk-terminated
L
1
2
crystal structures. Instead, they were constructed from the face-centered cubic lattices with randomly distributed Pt and Ti atoms. Starting from these disordered Pt–Ti alloy (111) surfaces, our MC simulations gave the same predictions about the Pt surface segregation composition profiles in Fig. 4(b) as in Fig. 4(a). This result indicates that our conclusions from the MC simulations are not sensitive to the initial structures. In the second test, our MC simulations started from bulk-terminated ordered
Pt
3
Ti
(111) surface slabs but included both compositional and structural relaxations. The compositional relaxation was achieved by exchanging the positions of different elements, while the structural relaxation was achieved by displacing the positions of atoms in the MC simulations. In this work, the atomic displacement in each MC step had a random magnitude within (0, 0.02 Å] and was along the [111] direction. In this way, the interlayer strain relaxation in the
Pt
3
Ti
(111) surface was taken into consideration in our MC simulations (in which we conducted
10
×
10
6
steps of MC simulation at
T
=
1100
K
and sampled the values of the Pt concentrations in the outermost three layers every 1000 steps in the last
6
×
10
6
steps). Our results in Fig. 4(c) from the MC simulations considering strain relaxation are very close to the results in Fig. 4(a) with no relaxation. This indicates that the strain relaxation does not alter the Pt surface segregation profiles of the
Pt
3
Ti
(111) surface, agreeing with our DFT calculation results in Sec. III A.

.
%
⁠. Aiming at understanding how such a surface structure alters the catalytic activity of ORRs on
Pt
3
Ti
(111), we further performed DFT calculations to determine the geometric structure, electronic structure, and O adsorption properties of the Pt-segregated
Pt
3
Ti
(111) surface. We first constructed a five-layer bulk-terminated (111) surface model of
Pt
3
Ti
crystal with a

×
2
unit
cell and then replaced the outermost layer with a pure Pt layer. During structure optimization, the bottom two surface layers were fixed to their positions in a perfect
Pt
3
Ti
crystal, and the upper three surface layers were allowed to fully relax. Our DFT calculations predicted that in the relaxed Pt-segregated
Pt
3
Ti
(111) model the separation between the outermost and second surface layer
(
d
12
)
would be about 2.30 Å, the separation between the second and third surface layer
(
d
23
)
would be about 2.28 Å, the buckling in the outermost layer (one Pt atom moves out of the (111) plane formed by the other three Pt atoms) would be
b

=
0.08
Å
⁠, and the buckling in the subsurface layer [where the Ti atom moves out of the (111) plane formed by the other three Pt atoms] would be
b

It has been established by Hammer and Nørskov that the
d
-band center of the surface with respect to the Fermi level is a useful indicator to measure the chemical reactivity of transition metal catalysts.54 For the cathode electrocatalysts of proton exchange membrane fuel cells, some downshift of the
d
-band center with respect to the one of pure Pt was theoretically predicted and later experimentally confirmed to enhance the reaction activity of the oxygen reduction reaction.55,56 The
d
-band center refers to the center of the density of states (DOS) of
d
-electrons with reference to the Fermi energy in the outermost surface layer of the catalyst. This can be determined from the projected DOS of the surface atoms by calculating the first-moment of the occupied states of the
d
-electrons. We plotted the calculated
d
-electron DOS and pointed out the location of the
d
-band centers of bulk-terminated
Pt

Ti

Pt
3
Ti
(111) in Fig. 5(b), and pure Pt (111) in Fig. 5(c). The values of the
d
-band centers of the three surfaces are given in Table VII. Compared to the
d
-band center of pure Pt (111), the
d
-band center of Pt-segregated
Pt

Ti
(111) downshifts by 0.21 eV, and the
d

Pt
3

(111) downshifts by 0.46 eV. With ultraviolet photoemission spectroscopy, Mun et al. had observed a downshift in the
d
-band center of about 0.8 eV when comparing annealed
Pt
3
Ti
and Pt polycrystal surfaces.18 It appears that our model calculation in this work is in qualitative agreement only with that experimental measurement.

Furthermore, we evaluated the adsorption energies of O atoms on the bulk-terminated

(111), and pure Pt (111). In the pure Pt (111) surface, the fcc site (above a threefold position in which there is no atom in the subsurface) was the lowest-energy location for O to adsorb on the surface. However, there were two types of fcc sites and two types of hcp sites (above a threefold position in which there was an atom in the subsurface) as shown in Fig. 6 on bulk-terminated and Pt-segregated
Pt
3
Ti
(111) surfaces. Table VII also gives our calculated O adsorption energies on the three modeled surfaces using DFT method. The adsorption energy is calculated as the energy difference between the adsorption and isolated configurations of O and the surface. The more negative the adsorption energy, the more strongly the O adsorbs on the surface. Our results for bulk-terminated
Pt
3
Ti
(111) indicate that O will be adsorbed on the surface more strongly at fcc1 and hcp2 sites (where a Ti atom is nearby) than at fcc2 and hcp1 sites (where only Pt atoms are nearby). Moreover, our results show that O will adsorb more weakly on Pt-segregated
Pt
3
Ti
(111), at least by 0.16 eV, than on pure Pt (111). Based on previous experimental data and theoretical model,22 slightly weakened O adsorption on a Pt-segregated

IV. CONCLUSIONS
In this work, we have studied surface segregation phenomena in the (111) surface of ordered
Pt
3
Ti
crystal using accurate DFT calculations with no configuration sampling and the MEAM potential-based MC simulations with extensive configuration sampling.
Our DFT results for stoichiometric ordered
Pt
3
Ti
crystal show that it requires at least 0.68 eV to directly exchange the surface Ti atoms with the Pt atoms inside the crystal. Consequently, it is hardly possible for Pt to segregate to the outermost surface layer through this direct exchange route. In addition, we examined the influence of the off-stoichiometric effect on surface segregation in
Pt
3
Ti
crystal using DFT calculations. In particular, we compared the generation energies of antisite defects in the surface and bulk regions of
Pt
3
Ti
(111). Our DFT results in Table II reveal that if there is more Pt in the
Pt
3
Ti
crystal than the stoichiometric value
(
75
at
.
%
)
⁠, those excessive
Pt
Ti
atoms will migrate to the outermost layer of (111) surface. In contrast, if there is more Ti in the
Pt
3
Ti
crystal than the stoichiometric value
(
25
at
.
%
)
⁠, those excessive
Ti
Pt
atoms will migrate to the second layer of the (111) surface. Thus, our DFT study implies that the migration of
Pt
Ti
defects may cause Pt surface segregation in the outermost layer of
Pt
3
Ti
(111).
In order to further elaborate surface segregation in
Pt
3
Ti
(111) at the experimental annealing temperature, we simulated the surface segregation process at
T
=
1100
K
using the MC simulation method and our developed MEAM potentials. Our developed MEAM potentials are capable of correctly predicting the surface energies of pure Pt and Ti crystals, the structural and energetic properties of bulk
Pt

Pt
3
Ti
crystal than the stoichiometric value
(

%
)
⁠, those excessive
Pt
Ti
atoms will migrate to the outermost layer of the (111) surface. Our MC simulation results in Fig. 4 clearly show that a strong segregation of Pt to the outermost layer will occur in the
Pt

Ti
(111) surfaces whose overall Pt concentration is above

⁠. When the bulk Pt concentration was

%
in our surface slab model, the Pt-segregated
Pt
3
Ti
(111) surface had such a structure: the outermost layer was pure Pt and the second and below layers were ordered
Pt
3
Ti
(111) surface layers. This theoretical prediction agrees very well with the experimental measurement.30

Furthermore, we evaluated the geometric and electronic structures of the Pt-segregated
Pt
3
Ti
(111) surface using DFT method. Our predicted structural parameters of the Pt-segregated
Pt
3
Ti
(111) surface are very close to the corresponding data extracted from LEED measurements.30 We also found that the
d
-band center of the Pt-segregated
Pt
3
Ti
(111) surface will downshift when compared with the one of pure Pt (111). This theoretical prediction is in qualitative agreement with experimental measurements.18 More importantly, we predicted that O adsorption is slightly weaker on the Pt-segregated
Pt
3
Ti
(111) surface than on the pure (111). We believe this slightly weakened O adsorption could lead to the observed catalytic activity enhancement for ORRs on carbon-supported
Pt
75

nanoparticles.28 
Through our theoretical investigations in this work, we have gained much insight into the surface segregation phenomena in the (111) surface of ordered
Pt
3
Ti
crystal. The attained knowledge will be useful for designing and fabricating Pt–Ti alloys as high performance catalysts, especially for their application as electrocatalysts in fuel cells.
