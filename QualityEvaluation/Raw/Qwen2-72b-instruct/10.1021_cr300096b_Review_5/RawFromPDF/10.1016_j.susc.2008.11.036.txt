Surface segregation in bimetallic Pt3M (M = Fe, Co, Ni) alloys with adsorbed oxygen
Abstract
Surface segregation of Pt3M (M = Fe, Co, and Ni) alloys under oxygen environment has been examined using periodic density functional theory. The segregation trend at a (1 1 1) surface is found to be substantially modified by the adsorbed oxygen. Our calculations indicate that under 1/4 monolayer O coverage both the Pt-segregated and M-segregated surfaces are less stable than the non-segregated one. Further analysis reveals that segregation energy under adsorption environments can be expressed as the sum of the segregation energy under vacuum conditions and the adsorption energy difference of the segregated and non-segregated alloy systems. Therefore, the surface segregation trend under adsorption conditions is directly correlated to the surface-adsorbate binding strength.
1. Introduction
Surface segregation has been drawing much experimental and theoretical attention due to its importance to materials science, catalysis and surface chemistry
[1]
,
[2]
. The phenomenon is able to influence many important physical and chemical properties such as permeation, surface adsorption, crystal growth, metal corrosion, etc. In particular, it has been found out that the catalytic activities of alloys can be significantly altered through surface segregation.
Platinum-based alloys have been extensively studied as cathode catalysts for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). Compared to pure Pt, enhanced ORR activities were observed in the case of Pt alloyed with 3d metals
[3]
,
[4]
,
[5]
,
[6]
,
[7]
. Remarkably, surface segregation was found closely related to the activity improvement
[6]
,
[8]
. For instance, Stamenkovic et al. compared the kinetics of the ORR on bulk alloy of Pt3Co and the Pt-skin structure produced by Pt-segregating on the topmost layer of the annealed surface. The ORR was uniquely active on the Pt-skin surface and the rate of reaction is four times that for the pure Pt catalyst
[6]
. The unusual catalytic activity has intrigued many researchers and numerous experimental and computational studies have been carried out for the surface segregation of Pt alloys

. For most of them, the endeavors focused on the understanding of the surface and subsurface structures and electronic properties under vacuum conditions. However, catalytic reactions such as the ORR are typically take place under operating environments with various adsorbates. The adsorbates can affect the surface segregation trend and even change the surface composition of the alloys in some cases. Menning et al. investigated the stability of Pt–3d–Pt and 3d–Pt–Pt configurations in vacuum and with 1/2 ML atomic oxygen using a combined experimental and computational approach. They predicted that for both (1 1 1) and (1 0 0) crystal planes the subsurface Pt–3d–Pt configurations were thermodynamically preferred in vacuum and that the surface 3d–Pt–Pt configurations were preferred with the adsorption of oxygen
[20]
,
[21]
,
[22]
. Han et al. found that oxygen adsorption can dramatically alter the segregation and surface ordering tendency of Pt–Ru alloys based on the first-principles calculations
[23]
. Recent reports focused on core/shell Pt/Ir (1 1 1) surfaces
[24]
and on Pt3Co and Pt3Ir stepped (2 1 1) surfaces
[25]
.
As the catalytic properties are primarily determined by the surface geometry and the electronic structure which can be modified by the surface composition of the alloys, studying the segregation trend of Pt-based alloys under surface adsorption is thus of great importance. For many Pt–3d alloys, previous experimental studies have already shown that the formation of a Pt-skin layer is accompanied with a Pt-depleted layer underneath under vacuum conditions
[7]
,
[26]
,
[27]
. In this work, we carry out periodic density functional theory (DFT) calculations to examine the surface segregation trend of Pt3M(1 1 1) (M = Fe, Co, and Ni) alloy systems under the adsorption of atomic oxygen. As we will show, the interactions of oxygen with the alloy surfaces play a critical role in the segregation of Pt-based alloys.
2. Computational details
The spin-polarized DFT calculations were performed using the Vienna ab initio simulation package (VASP)
[28]
,
[29]
,
[30]
,
[31]
,
[32]
, in which the Kohn–Sham equations are solved by self-consistent algorithms. The valence electrons were described by plane wave basis sets with a cutoff energy of 350 eV and the core electrons were replaced by the projector augmented wave (PAW) pseudo-potentials
[33]
,
[34]
for improving the computational efficiency. The Brillouin zone was sampled with an 8 × 8 × 1 Monkhorst-Pack k-point mesh for the slab calculations. The exchange-correlation functional was described within the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) proposed by Perdew, Burke and Ernzerhof (PBE)
[35]
. The Methfessel–Paxon method was employed to determine electron occupancies with a width of the smearing in 0.2 eV. The geometries of the slabs were relaxed until the forces converge to 10−4 eV/Å.
As Pt3M(M = Fe, Co, and Ni) alloys possess close-packed fcc structures
[4]
,
[36]
,
[37]
, our slab models were constructed based on the ordered fcc structure. The lattice constants from our previous study were used in the calculations. The values are 3.91, 3.89 and 3.88 Ǻ for Pt3Fe, Pt3Co and Pt3Ni, respectively
[19]
. A 2 × 2 (1 1 1) unit cell was employed for all the slab models. Each super cell consists of a five-layer slab and six equivalent layers of vacuum and each slab layer contains three Pt atoms and one 3d metal atom. The Pt-segregated structure was built by exchanging M atoms in the first layer and Pt atoms in the second layer. The topmost layer is consequently fully covered by Pt atoms and the second layer contains 50% Pt atoms. Similarly, exchanging the surface Pt atoms and the second-layer M atoms led to the M-segregated structure, in which the first layer is composed of 50% M and 50% Pt atoms and the second layer comprises solely Pt atoms, as illustrated in
Fig. 1
. The relatively simple segregation model allows us to compare the segregation trends under the same criteria. The atoms in the top three layers were allowed to relax to their lowest energy configuration, while the atoms of the bottom two layers were fixed to their bulk positions keeping their optimized lattice constants.

The adsorption of atomic oxygen was modeled on the alloy surface. Four types of adsorption sites: top, bridge, HCP, and FCC, were examined at 1/4 monolayer coverage. In our calculations, the adsorption energy of atomic oxygen, Eads, is given by the equation, Eads = Eslab/O − Eslab − Eo, in which Eslab/O is the total energy of the slab with adsorbed oxygen, Eslab is the energy of the slab, and Eo is the energy of gas phase O. The surface segregation energy, Esegr, is defined as the difference of total free energies of the slab with the segregated structure and with the non-segregated structure. A negative Esegr indicates that the corresponding surface segregation is thermodynamically favorable, while a positive Esegr suggests that the surface segregation is thermodynamically prohibited.
3. Results and discussion
Under vacuum conditions, surface segregation is mainly determined by the surface energy and the atomic size. Metal atoms with larger radii and lower surface energies usually tend to segregate to the surface. As Fe, Co, and Ni possess comparable surface energies but much smaller atomic radii compared to Pt
[38]
,
[39]
, Pt tends to segregate to the surface of the corresponding Pt3M alloy. This has been verified by some experimental studies
[14]
,
[40]
,
[41]
,
[42]
,
[43]

[44]
and our previous calculations
[19]
. However, in the presence of adsorbate atoms on the surface, the surface composition may be different in that the adsorption can stabilize or destabilize the alloy structures. 3d metals generally exhibit higher affinity to oxygen than Pt. Stronger adsorption is therefore expected when oxygen atoms are bound to 3d-metal-enriched surfaces
[45]
. To prove this point, we calculate the adsorption energy of atomic oxygen on the non-segregated, Pt-segregated and M-segregated Pt3M(1 1 1) surfaces at 1/4 ML O coverage. For each surface, four types of adsorption sites, top, bridge, hcp, and fcc are investigated, as illustrated in
Fig. 2
. Although there are 2–8 possible sites for each type of adsorption, only the one with the lowest adsorption energy are listed in
Table 1
. For each alloy, the binding strength has the order of fcc > hcp > bridge > top, except for the Fe-segregated Pt3Fe(1 1 1) system, in which the fcc adsorption energy (−5.23 eV) are weaker than the fcc and bridge ones (−5.50 and −5.33 eV). We also note that the relative strength of oxygen adsorption is M-segregated structure > non-segregated structure > Pt-segregated structure. The M-segregated surfaces possess the strongest adsorption because more 3d metal atoms are engaged into the interactions with oxygen. The loss of the surface 3d metal atoms results in much weaker oxygen binding for the Pt-segregated structures. The strength of oxygen adsorption is also correlated to the distance of oxygen and the surface layer, dO1. As shown in
Table 2
, the shortest distance can be found in M-segregated structures, corresponding to the strongest binding; whereas the longest distance suggests the weakest binding between oxygen and the alloy surface. Moreover, our calculations give the following order of the oxygen binding strength for the non-segregated and M-segregated structures by comparing the most stable adsorption site for each alloy: Pt3Fe(1 1 1) > Pt3Co(1 1 1) > Pt3Ni(1 1 1), whereas the reverse order are observed for the Pt-segregated structures.

Oxygen adsorption decreases the stability of the Pt-segregated surfaces and even alters the segregation trend for Pt3M alloys. According to
Table 3
, most calculated segregation energies are positive, revealing that the Pt-segregated surface is generally not thermodynamically favored when covered by 1/4 ML of oxygen. The only exception is the segregation energy for the top adsorption on Pt3Ni(1 1 1), with a small negative value of −0.05 eV. Furthermore, we also evaluate the M-segregation trend for the alloy systems. The positive segregation energies indicate that the M-segregated structures are not as stable as the non-segregated ones. Although oxygen adsorption does induce the M-segregation arising from the strong interactions of oxygen and the 3d metal atoms, the segregation must overcome the strong surface segregation tendency of Pt. The two opposite effects compete each other and the latter takes the advantage in this case. Therefore, non-segregated structures exhibit the highest stability in comparison to the Pt-segregated and M-segregated ones.

In our previous study
[19]
, we pointed out that the distance between the first and the second layers (d12) generally increases with a negative segregation energy and the displacement can approximately predict the segregation trend under vacuum. However, the values of d12 in
Table 2
indicate that the rule does not apply under adsorption conditions. Under vacuum, d12 is fully determined by the properties of the alloys. Under adsorption conditions, the distance is also dependent on the interactions with the adsorbates.
As discussed above, the segregation energy under adsorbate environment,
, can be expressed as

(5)
indicates that the segregation trend of an alloy system in the presence of adsorbates can be evaluated by the segregation energy under vacuum conditions and the adsorption energies of the segregated and non-segregated alloy systems. The equation is very useful for analyzing adsorbent-induced segregation: for Pt3Fe(1 1 1), Pt3Co(1 1 1), and Pt3Ni(1 1 1), the corresponding Pt-segregation energies under vacuum,
, are −0.41, −0.61 and −0.38 eV, respectively. However, the difference of the adsorption energies,
ranging from 0.33 to 1.37 eV, is generally larger than the magnitude of
(
Table 4
). This yields the positive values of the segregation energy under oxygen adsorption, showing that the Pt surface segregation process is unlikely to take place in oxygen environment. As the only exception, the value of
(0.33 eV) for Pt3Ni(1 1 1) with top-site oxygen adsorption, is smaller than the magnitude of
(−0.38 eV), leading to a negative
of −0.05 eV. For the surface segregation of 3d metals, the calculated positive values of
indicate that the 3d metals atoms tend not to segregate to the surface. On the other hand, the oxygen adsorption on the M-segregated surface is much stronger than that of the non-segregated surface. The combination of
and
, however, still produces positive values of
because the former term dominates the segregation trend. The latter term can play a more important role at higher oxygen coverage in that more oxygen atoms are involved into the surface-adsorbate interactions. The segregation trend is consequently reversed, leading to an M-segregated surface.

4. Conclusions
We have evaluated the surface segregation trend of Pt3M (M = Fe, Co, and Ni) alloys in the presence of absorbed atomic oxygen, by means of the segregation energies obtained from DFT calculations. It is found that the surface structure is significantly modified under the influence of surface segregation: neither Pt-segregation nor M-segregation is favored on the (1 1 1) surface at 1/4 ML oxygen coverage. The segregation energy under surface adsorption can be represented as the sum of the segregation energy under vacuum conditions and the adsorption energy difference of the segregated and non-segregated alloy systems. For the Pt-segregated structures, the vacuum segregation energy is unable to compensate the loss of the surface adsorption energy due to Pt-segregation; whereas for the M-segregated structures, the extra adsorption energy gained from M-segregation cannot counterbalance the strong anti-segregation energy. Therefore, the non-segregated structures remain the most thermodynamically stable. The influence of surface segregation on the ORR catalytic activity is quite complex because of the existence of many factors such as concentration of adsorbates, segregation kinetics, dissolution of Pt and/or less-noble atoms and the ORR mechanism. Current studies are underway to investigate some of these aspects and the results will be reported elsewhere.
