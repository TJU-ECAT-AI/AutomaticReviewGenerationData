Bimetallic catalysts often present superior catalytic perform-
ance in comparison to their parent metals and have been
widely used in many catalytic processes.[1–5] Compared with
monometallic catalysts, bimetallic catalysts have more surface
structural complexity, where the second metal—in either the
metallic or the oxidized state—can be exposed on the surface,
in the near surface region, or embedded in bulk region. It has
been demonstrated that the surface structure of the bimetallic
catalyst is critical to their catalytic properties. For example, Pt-
based bimetallic catalysts consisting of Pt-skin surfaces with 3d
transition metals at the subsurface region present super cata-
lytic performances in many reactions compared to the pure Pt
surface.[4,6–8] In order to optimize the catalytic performance, it
is highly demanding to modulate the surface structure of the
bimetallic catalysts. The structure of a catalyst surface often
changes dynamically during reactions. For example, reversible
surface processes such as wetting–dewetting and sintering–
dispersion have been observed in monometallic catalyst sys-
tems when the gaseous environment changes between reduc-
tive and oxidative conditions.[9–11] The bimetallic catalysts may
show similar dependence of surface structure on the redox po-
tential of reaction gases, which offers eventually the opportu-
nity to tune the catalytic activity and selectivity. Here, using
well-defined Fe–PtACHTUNGTRENUNG(111) systems we show that the surface
structure of the bimetallic Fe–Pt catalysts can be indeed
switched between the Pt-skin surface with Fe underneath and
the iron oxide rich Pt surface. The reversible structural modula-
tion regulated by cycled oxidation and reduction treatments

Fe overlayers with coverage of about 1.0 monolayer (ML)
were grown on a clean PtACHTUNGTRENUNG(111) by molecular beam epitaxy with
the substrate temperature at 487 K, producing a Fe/PtACHTUNGTRENUNG(111) sur-
face. Scanning tunnelling microscopy (STM), X-ray photoelec-
tron spectroscopy (XPS), and ion scattering spectroscopy (ISS)
[see Figure S1 in the Supporting Information (SI)] indicate that
Fe grows on PtACHTUNGTRENUNG(111) in the layer growth mode, at least for the
first layer under the current deposition conditions. Upon an-
nealing a ~1.0 ML Fe/PtACHTUNGTRENUNG(111) surface in ultrahigh vacuum
(UHV) at 850 K for 6 min, the surface Fe overlayers disappear
completely, as indicated by the ISS spectrum (see Figure S2a in
SI), where only Pt signals are present. This is confirmed further
by the characteristic morphology of the atomically flat PtACHTUNGTRENUNG(111)
surface (Figure 1a and inset therein) by STM. However, XPS
measurements still show a strong signal from Fe (Figure S2b in
SI), and a decrease of ~61% in the Fe 2p3/2 peak intensity
occurs upon the UHV annealing. Considering that the attenua-
tion of Fe 2p3/2 photoelectrons through one layer PtACHTUNGTRENUNG(111) is
around 30%, Fe should diffuse into the near surface regions
(mainly in first subsurface layer, around 0.5 ML) rather than the
deep bulk. Correspondingly, the binding energy (BE) of Fe 2p3/2
shifts from 707.2 eV for the surface Fe overlayers to 707.8 eV

for the subsurface Fe due to the increase of the Pt–Fe coordi-
nation number. The produced Pt-skin surface with subsurface
Fe underneath is noted as Pt/Fe/PtACHTUNGTRENUNG(111).
The similar Pt-skin structures have been demonstrated in
Cu/PtACHTUNGTRENUNG(111),[7] Ni/PtACHTUNGTRENUNG(111),[8,12] PtCo,[13] and Pt80Fe20
[14] bimetallic
systems, where the 3d transition metals tend to diffuse into
subsurface regions to form Pt-skin surfaces upon UHV anneal-
ing or in case of growth of the 3d metals at elevated tempera-
tures. These Pt-skin structures have been shown to be promis-
ing catalysts for many reactions. However, the stability of the
bimetallic catalysts under gaseous reaction environments re-
mains unclear.[1,15] In order to study the change of the Fe–
PtACHTUNGTRENUNG(111) surface structure under different gas conditions, the Pt-
skin surface was treated in the typical oxidative and reductive
atmospheres, that is, O2 and H2, respectively. The Pt/Fe/PtACHTUNGTRENUNG(111)
surface was first heated in 1.1106 mbar O2 at 850 K for
6 min, and the surface morphology acquired via STM was
shown in Figure 1b. The surface now exhibits a superstructure
with a periodicity of 25 , which is a typical Moir pattern of
two-dimensional monolayer FeO film grown on PtACHTUNGTRENUNG(111).[16,17]
The well-defined FeO atomic structure can be clearly discerned
from the high resolution STM image (see inset in Figure 1b).
Moreover, a strong Fe signal is detected by ISS after the oxida-
tion (Figure S2a in SI), which indicates the existence of Fe on
the surface. At the same time, the intensity of XPS Fe 2p peak
increases by ~45%, and the BE of Fe 2p3/2 peak shifts up to
709.2 eV (Figure S2b in SI), which indicates the presence of the
Fe(II) valence state of the segregated Fe. These results show
unambiguously that the Pt/Fe/PtACHTUNGTRENUNG(111) surface is not stable in
O2, and subsurface Fe tends to segregate towards the surface
and form an ordered FeO film on PtACHTUNGTRENUNG(111) [noted as FeO/
PtACHTUNGTRENUNG(111)] upon oxidation. Subsequent annealing of the FeO/
PtACHTUNGTRENUNG(111) surface in 1.1106 mbar H2 at 800 K for 6 min removes
completely the surface O, and all surface Fe atoms diffuse into
the subsurface region, which is accompanied by a shift of the
Fe 2p3/2 BE back to 707.8 eV. STM and ISS measurements indi-
cate that the H2-annealed surface has the same surface struc-
ture and composition as PtACHTUNGTRENUNG(111), namely, the Pt-skin surface,
Pt/Fe/PtACHTUNGTRENUNG(111), is resumed from FeO/PtACHTUNGTRENUNG(111) upon the reduction.
More interestingly, the change between the surface Fe struc-
ture, FeO/PtACHTUNGTRENUNG(111), and the Pt-skin structure, Pt/Fe/PtACHTUNGTRENUNG(111), can
be repeated via the cycled oxidation and reduction treatments.
As shown in Figure 1c, four cycles of oxidation and reduction
have been conducted on a Fe–PtACHTUNGTRENUNG(111) surface. Oxidation of
each Pt-skin surface results in appearance of a strong Fe signal
in the ISS spectra and an increase in the XPS Fe 2p3/2 intensity
along with a shift of Fe 2p3/2 BE to around 709.2 eV, indicating
the formation of FeO/PtACHTUNGTRENUNG(111) surfaces. Starting with each FeO/
PtACHTUNGTRENUNG(111) surface, the Pt-skin surfaces can be regenerated via the
reduction treatment, which was confirmed by absence of Fe
signal in ISS spectra, decrease of XPS Fe 2p3/2 intensity to
~60% , and shift of Fe 2p3/2 BE to 707.8 eV. The Fe–PtACHTUNGTRENUNG(111) sur-
face shows a fully reversible change between the FeO covered
Pt structure and the Pt-skin structure (Figure 1c). The original
Fe 2p3/2 XPS spectra in the four cycles are presented in Fig-
ure S3 in SI. It should be noted that the similar reversible
change in surface structure and composition of Fe–Pt bimetal-
lic catalysts was also observed in supported Fe–Pt nanoparti-
cles (Figure S4 in SI).
Spin-polarized density function theory (DFT) calculations
using ultrasoft pseudopotential plane wave and the GGA-
PW91 method implemented in DACAPO package[18,19] are per-
formed to study the stability of the Fe–PtACHTUNGTRENUNG(111) surface under
reductive and oxidative environments. The Fe–PtACHTUNGTRENUNG(111) surface
is modelled by substituting one Pt atom with Fe atom from
the topmost Pt layer to the fourth Pt layer in the seven layer
(22) PtACHTUNGTRENUNG(111) slab separated by 15  vacuum (Figure 2 inset)
with full structural optimization. For the clean surface (Fig-
ure 2a), which corresponds to the condition in vacuum, the
heat of formation, DH, of Fe–Pt bimetallic surface with respect
to the PtACHTUNGTRENUNG(111) and bulk fcc Fe are plotted. When the Fe atom
displaces from the topmost Pt layer to the subsurface Pt layer,
DH is lowered by 0.71 eV, but it increases gradually when the
Fe atom moves into the deeper region. The result suggests
that subsurface Fe below the topmost Pt layer is the most en-
ergetically favourable one. With hydrogen adsorption (qH=
0.50 ML) on the surface (Figure 2b), the relative stability of H-
adsorbed Fe–Pt bimetallic surface by including the bonding
energy between H and corresponding substrates does not
change. These results agree well with surface-science experi-
ments, where the Pt-skin surfaces with subsurface Fe are the
most stable structure after annealing Fe–Pt samples under
vacuum and H2 conditions. Our calculations show that upon
oxygen adsorption (qO=0.50 ML), Fe–Pt bimetallic surface with
Fe in the topmost Pt layer is the most stable, due to the signif-
icantly stronger OFe bonding than that of OPt, which even-
tually leads to Fe segregation and formation of the FeO mono-
layer on PtACHTUNGTRENUNG(111), as found experimentally (Figure 1). The prefer-
ence of subsurface Fe right below the topmost Pt layer under
the reducing conditions and strong OFe interaction are the
reason for the reversible change of the FePt surface struc-
tures during the oxidation and reduction cycles.
The oxidation and reduction treatments produce a Pt sur-
face covered by iron oxide and Pt-skin surface with subsurface

Fe, respectively. Since the FeO structure formed on PtACHTUNGTRENUNG(111) via
the full oxidation treatments is inert to many gases, such as
CO and O2, the reactivity of the FeO covered PtACHTUNGTRENUNG(111) surface
should behave as the pure PtACHTUNGTRENUNG(111) surface. Therefore, we de-
scribe here a comparative reactivity study on PtACHTUNGTRENUNG(111) and Pt-
skin surfaces. First, CO and O adsorption on PtACHTUNGTRENUNG(111) and Pt/Fe/
PtACHTUNGTRENUNG(111) were studied by high resolution electron energy loss
spectroscopy (HREELS). Atomic O species were produced on
both surfaces by adsorption of 100 L O2 on Pt/Fe/PtACHTUNGTRENUNG(111) and
30 L O2 on PtACHTUNGTRENUNG(111) at 110 K followed by annealing up to 300 K.
On PtACHTUNGTRENUNG(111) the HREELS spectrum shows one typical vibrational
mode near 58.8 meV, which can be assigned to nACHTUNGTRENUNG(PtO) mode
of O on the 3-fold fcc hollow sites of PtACHTUNGTRENUNG(111).[20] The vibrational
mode of O on Pt/Fe/PtACHTUNGTRENUNG(111) is similar to that on PtACHTUNGTRENUNG(111), but
the frequency presents a red shift by 3 meV relative to that on
PtACHTUNGTRENUNG(111), located at 55.8 meV (Figure 3a). Although weak ad-
sorption of O on Pt skin surfaces has been reported previously
from the ligand effect induced by subsurface Fe using DFT cal-
culations,[21–23] our HREELS data present a first direct evidence
for such an effect. The weaker adsorption on Pt/Fe/PtACHTUNGTRENUNG(111) also
explains why large O2 exposure is applied to produce O on the
surface. CO adsorption on the PtACHTUNGTRENUNG(111) and Pt/Fe/PtACHTUNGTRENUNG(111) surfa-
ces at 110 K was also investigated by HREELS. Figure 3b dis-
plays the HREELS spectra of CO adsorption on both surfaces
with 0.8 L CO exposure. The top-site adsorption on both surfa-
ces has the similar frequency at 258.8 meV while the bridge-
site adsorption of CO on Pt/Fe/PtACHTUNGTRENUNG(111) shows a blue shift com-
pared to the PtACHTUNGTRENUNG(111), from 226.8 to 228.9 meV. The frequency
shift for the bridge-site CO on Pt/Fe/PtACHTUNGTRENUNG(111) is close to the cal-
culated value on a similar Pt skin structure of Pt80Fe20 alloy,[24]
which should be related to the weakened CO adsorption on Pt
skin surface according to the classic Blyholder model.[25]
The variation of bond strength of CO on the PtACHTUNGTRENUNG(111) and Pt-
skin surfaces was further confirmed by temperature-program-
med ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (TP-UPS). Pt surfa-
ces saturated by 6 L CO at 300 K were heated at the rate of
3 K/minute and monitored in-situ by He II UPS. The normalized
intensity of the CO characteristic peak at 9.4 eV in the He II
UPS spectra as a function of the sample temperature is plotted
in Figure 3c and Figure S5 in SI. Complete desorption of CO
on the Pt/Fe/PtACHTUNGTRENUNG(111) surface occurs at around 370 K, while on
PtACHTUNGTRENUNG(111) CO desorbs slowly and disappears completely at about
430 K. In this context, we note that amount of subsurface Fe
accumulated under reducing conditions is thermodynamically
dependent. With increasing temperatures, the entropy effect
becomes significant, and subsurface Fe atoms tend to diffuse
further into the bulk region. The ligand effect induced by sub-
surface Fe on the reactivity of Pt-skin surface becomes weaker.
Correspondingly, Pt-skin surface behaves like pure Pt. This is
indeed verified by our experiments. By annealing as-prepared
~1 ML Fe/PtACHTUNGTRENUNG(111) at 900 K for 6 min and exposing the same
amount of CO, we found that CO desorbs completely at 405 K,
which is higher than Pt/Fe/PtACHTUNGTRENUNG(111) (370 K) due to the less
amount of subsurface Fe, but remains lower than pure PtACHTUNGTRENUNG(111)
(430 K), as plotted in Figure 3c.
The surface adsorption and desorption results suggest that
the presence of subsurface Fe at PtACHTUNGTRENUNG(111) alleviates the poison-
ing by CO and makes dissociated O more reactive, which may
enhance the catalytic activity with CO and/or O involved. To il-
lustrate this, the performance of SiO2 supported Pt and Fe-Pt
nanoparticles were compared for the preferential oxidation re-
action of CO (PROX) in excess of H2. The activity of the cata-
lysts for CO PROX reaction (1% CO, 0.5% O2, 98.5% H2,
0.1 MPa, 36000 mLg1h1) was measured by performing the
reactions at room temperature. For the Pt/SiO2 catalyst only
6% CO conversion is observed, while the Fe-Pt/SiO2 catalysts
treated in H2 (1 bar) at 623 K has much higher CO conversion,
close to 20% (Figure 3d). Our experimental results show that
the treatments of Fe–PtACHTUNGTRENUNG(111) surface and supported Fe–Pt
nanoparticles in H2 could produce Pt-skin structure (Figure 1
and Figure S4 in SI). Thus, the higher CO conversion of Fe–Pt/
SiO2 catalysts pre-treated in H2 should be attributed to the for-
mation of Pt-skin surface, which decreases the CO poisoning
and enhances the CO oxidation activity.[23] However, oxidation
in O2 drives the segregation of subsurface Fe to the top sur-
face and results in a partial covering of Pt by iron oxides
(Figure 1 and Figure S4 in SI). Thus, it is expected that the oxi-
dized Fe–Pt catalysts should behave more like the pure Pt cat-
alyst. Indeed, we observed that oxidizing the Fe–Pt/SiO2 cata-
lysts in O2 (1 bar, 623 K) deteriorates the catalytic performance,
showing CO conversion around 7%—close to that of pure Pt
catalyst. Moreover, the alternating O2 and H2 treatments lead
to up-down oscillations in CO conversion—high upon H2 re-
duction but low after O2 annealing. The reversible catalytic per-
formance with the redox treatments is consistent with the
structure change with O2 and H2 environments (Figure 1 and
Figure 3. HREELS spectra of a) atomic O and b) CO adsorbed on PtACHTUNGTRENUNG(111) and
Pt/Fe/PtACHTUNGTRENUNG(111), respectively. c) CO desorption from the PtACHTUNGTRENUNG(111) surface, Pt/Fe/
PtACHTUNGTRENUNG(111) surface, and the PtACHTUNGTRENUNG(111) with Fe in bulk. The CO desorption was
monitored by TP-UPS. d) CO conversion for Pt/SiO2 and Fe–Pt/SiO2 catalysts
in the PROX reactions at room temperature. Before each reaction, the Fe–Pt/
SiO2 catalysts were treated in flowing H2 or O2 gases at 623 K.

Figure S4 in Support Information), showing the tunability of
catalytic performance.
Dynamic change in the catalyst surface structures in re-
sponse to variation in gaseous environments is one of the
most important phenomena in heterogeneous catalysis and
has been addressed in some catalyst systems.[1,9–11,26] In the
present work, based on the comprehensive surface characteri-
zation data and theoretical contributions we have demonstrat-
ed that the Fe–Pt bimetallic catalyst presents the dynamic
change in surface structure. The reversible structural modula-
tion between the Pt skin surface and the iron oxide rich Pt sur-
face can be induced by cycled oxidation and reduction. Fur-
thermore, the reversible structural changes at Fe–Pt bimetallic
catalyst surfaces results in tunability of the surface reactivities,
such as PROX activity. The tunability of the surface structure
and reactivity of bimetallic catalysts may open an effective way
to design highly efficient catalysts for many important catalytic
processes.
Experimental Section
The surface experiments were performed in an Omicron Mutlip-
robe surface science system, which is composed of sample prepa-
ration chamber, spectroscopic chamber, and microscope chamber.
The PtACHTUNGTRENUNG(111) is cleaned by cycles of 2.0 keV Ar+ sputtering and an-
nealing at 1000 K in UHV. The sample can be resistively heated up
to 1100 K and cooled by liquid nitrogen down to 110 K. The Fe
source is made of a coil of two 0.5 mm diameter tungsten wires
wrapped with a 0.1 mm diameter Fe wire, and Fe coverage was de-
termined by STM. All STM images are acquired at room tempera-
ture with a constant current mode of a tungsten tip. XPS measure-
ment was performed with MgKa (1253.6 eV) using a pass energy
of 30 eV. All ISS spectra were measured at He 5.0108 mbar with
1.0 keV primary energy and the ion incidence angle of 508 with re-
spect to the sample surface if not specially specified. The HREELS
measurements are operated with the primary beam energy of
7.287 eV. The angles of incidence and reflection are 60 degree with
respect to the surface normal in the specular direction. The gases
of O2, CO, and H2 (purity of 99.999%) are dosed into the system
via sapphire leak valves.
The Pt and Fe–Pt nanoparticles supported on silica were prepared
by a sol-gel method using H2PtCl6 and FeACHTUNGTRENUNG(NO3)3 as the precursors.
Through aging, nucleation, and subsequent H2 treatment, Pt/SiO2
and Fe-Pt/SiO2 catalysts were produced, in which the loading of Fe
and Pt was controlled at 4 wt.%. PROX reaction was conducted
under the conditions of 1% CO, 0.5% O2, 98.5% H2, 0.1 MPa, and
36000 mLg1h1 at RT.
