          The thermodynamics and kinetics of oxygen-induced segregation of 3d metals in Pt-based systems, such as Pt-3d alloys, are influenced by factors including the crystal plane, which affects the stability of subsurface 3d metals. This has implications for the catalytic properties and performance of bimetallic catalysts in various applications, particularly in oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activity. The stability of subsurface 3d metals in Pt(111) and Pt(100) under oxygen exposure is predicted through Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations. The crystal plane has an effect on the subsurface stability of the bimetallic catalysts. These factors influence the surface segregation and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, which in turn affect their catalytic properties and performance in various applications.
