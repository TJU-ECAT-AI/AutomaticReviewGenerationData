1.The thermodynamics and kinetics of oxygen-induced segregation of 3d metals in Pt-based systems, such as Pt-3d alloys, are influenced by factors including the crystal plane, which affects the stability of subsurface 3d metals. This has implications for the catalytic properties and performance of bimetallic catalysts in various applications, particularly in oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activity.
