1.Surface segregation plays a key role in the process of Pt-based alloys. For instance, Stamenkovic et al. found that the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is uniquely active on Pt-skin surfaces, and the reaction rate is four times that of the pure Pt catalyst. Numerous studies have been carried out using modern experimental and computational techniques to understand the importance of surface segregation for Pt-based alloys. For many Pt alloy systems, segregation trends have been unambiguously identified, and the components of surface and subsurface regions have successfully been characterized. The dissolution of metal atoms results in some defects on the alloy surface, which are critical to the rearrangement process. The phenomenon can also be observed in acidic solution, often with dissolution of the alloyed metal and rearrangement of Pt atoms. The segregation process includes interlayer migration of the impurity atom, vacancy movement at the second layer, and vacancy regeneration at the surface layer. The segregation model can successfully interpret these phenomena, particularly from a kinetics viewpoint. The pathway from 1 to 4 describes a complete cycle in which an impurity atom in the second layer segregates to the Pt(111) surface.

1.表面分层在Pt基合金的过程中起着关键作用。例如，Stamenkovic等人发现氧还原反应（ORR）在Pt皮肤表面上独特地活跃，反应速率是纯Pt催化剂的四倍。为了理解表面分层对Pt基合金的重要性，已经使用现代实验和计算技术进行了大量研究。对于许多Pt合金系统，已经明确识别了分层趋势，并成功地表征了表面和次表面区域的成分。金属原子的溶解在合金表面上产生了一些缺陷，这些缺陷对重排过程至关重要。这种现象也可以在酸性溶液中观察到，通常伴随着合金金属的溶解和Pt原子的重排。分层过程包括杂质原子的层间迁移、第二层的空位移动和表面层的空位再生。分层模型可以成功地从动力学角度解释这些现象。从1到4的路径描述了一个完整的循环，其中第二层中的杂质原子分层到Pt(111)表面。该过程对于PtAu系统是放热的，而对于PtCo系统则是吸热的。因此，根据模型，Co分层到清洁的Pt(111)表面在热力学上是不利的，并且在动力学上是禁止的。
