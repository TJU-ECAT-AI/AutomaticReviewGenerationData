[1] "Platinum has become the most popular cathode electrocatalyst in polymer electrode membrane (PEM) fuel cells. However, its relatively sluggish kinetics for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) significantly limits the catalytic efficiency."

[3] "Surface segregation has been found to play a key role in the process."

1.The stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems such as Pt-3d alloys, are influenced by thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions. Platinum is a popular cathode electrocatalyst in PEM fuel cells, but its slow kinetics for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) limits catalytic efficiency. In recent years, Pt-based alloys, which include Pt and other transition metals, have been extensively studied due to their enhanced ORR activity. Surface segregation plays a key role in this process, leading to the formation of a pure Pt-skin in the outermost layer of the alloys. This surface segregation is closely related to the enhanced stability of Pt-based catalysts.

1.双金属催化剂的稳定性、表面分层和结构配置，特别是在Pt基系统如Pt-3d合金中，受到热力学偏好和反应条件的影响。铂是PEM燃料电池中流行的阴极电催化剂，但其对氧还原反应(ORR)的缓慢动力学限制了催化效率。近年来，由于Pt基合金(包括Pt和其他过渡金属)的增强ORR活性，对其进行了广泛的研究。表面分层在这个过程中起着关键作用，导致合金外层形成纯Pt皮肤。这种表面分层与Pt基催化剂的增强稳定性密切相关。
