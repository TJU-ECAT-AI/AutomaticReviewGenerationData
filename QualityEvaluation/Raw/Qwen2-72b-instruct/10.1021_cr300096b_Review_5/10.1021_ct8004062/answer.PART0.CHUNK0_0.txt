[1] "Platinum has become the most popular cathode electrocatalyst in polymer electrode membrane (PEM) fuel cells. However, its relatively sluggish kinetics for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) significantly limits the catalytic efficiency."
[2] "In recent years, Pt-based alloys, composed of Pt and other transition metals, have been extensively investigated (1-7) owing to their enhanced ORR activity."
[3] "Surface segregation has been found to play a key role in the process."
[4] "A pure Pt-skin is formed in the outmost layer of the alloys due to surface segregation of Pt atoms."
[5] "The enhanced stability of Pt-based catalysts is also closely related to surface segregation."
[6] "Au shows strong surface segregation in PtAu alloys, (29, 30) whereas Co is usually unable to enrich PtCo alloy surfaces. (16, 17)"
[7] "The pathway from 1 to 4 describes a complete cycle in which an impurity atom in the second layer segregates to the Pt(111) surface. The process is exothermic (0.57 eV) for the PtAu system, whereas it is endothermic (0.45 eV) for the PtCo system."
[8] "This leads to the conclusion that Au surface segregation is thermodynamically favorable, consistent with previous studies. (26, 28-30)"
[9] "For the PtCo alloy, the conversion from 2 to 1 has an energy barrier of 0.63 eV, much lower than that of the competitive step from 3 to 4 (1.15 eV), suggesting the surface Co atoms have a stronger tendency to migrate to the second layer compared to the Pt atoms."
[10] "Accordingly, structure 4 most likely will not be formed, and thus the continuous segregation of Co cannot be reached."
[11] "Therefore, Co segregating to the clean Pt(111) surface is both thermodynamically unfavorable and kinetically prohibitive according to our model."

1.Platinum is widely used as a cathode electrocatalyst in PEM fuel cells, but its catalytic efficiency is limited by sluggish kinetics for the oxygen reduction reaction. In recent years, Pt-based alloys have been extensively studied due to their enhanced ORR activity. Surface segregation plays a key role in this process, forming a pure Pt-skin on the surface of the alloys, which is closely related to the enhanced stability of Pt-based catalysts. Au shows strong surface segregation in PtAu alloys, while Co is usually unable to enrich PtCo alloy surfaces. The process of Au segregating from the second layer to the surface is exothermic, indicating that Au surface segregation is thermodynamically favorable. However, for the PtCo alloy, the surface Co atoms have a stronger tendency to migrate to the second layer, making the continuous segregation of Co unlikely. Therefore, Co segregating to the clean Pt(111) surface is both thermodynamically unfavorable and kinetically prohibitive.

1.铂被广泛用作PEM燃料电池中的阴极电催化剂，但由于氧还原反应的缓慢动力学，其催化效率受到限制。近年来，由于Pt基合金的增强ORR活性，Pt基合金得到了广泛研究。表面分层在这个过程中起着关键作用，形成了合金表面的纯铂层，这与Pt基催化剂的增强稳定性密切相关。Au在PtAu合金中表现出强烈的表面分层，而Co通常无法丰富PtCo合金表面。Au从第二层向表面分层的过程是放热的，表明Au表面分层在热力学上是有利的。然而，对于PtCo合金，表面Co原子有更强的倾向迁移到第二层，使得Co的连续分层不太可能。因此，Co向清洁Pt(111)表面分层在热力学上是不利的，在动力学上也是被禁止的。
