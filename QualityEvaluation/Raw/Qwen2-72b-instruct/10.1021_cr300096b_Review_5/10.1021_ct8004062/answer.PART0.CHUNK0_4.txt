1.The stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems such as Pt-3d alloys, are influenced by thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions. Platinum is a popular cathode electrocatalyst in PEM fuel cells, but its sluggish kinetics for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) limits catalytic efficiency. In recent years, Pt-based alloys have been extensively investigated due to their enhanced ORR activity. Surface segregation plays a key role in this process, forming a pure Pt-skin in the outmost layer of the alloys. The enhanced stability of Pt-based catalysts is closely related to surface segregation. Numerous studies have been carried out to understand the segregation trends and components of surface and subsurface regions in Pt alloy systems. However, the kinetics of surface segregation, which is critical to elucidate the driving forces and process of this phenomenon, has not been fully addressed at a molecular level.

1.双金属催化剂的稳定性、表面分层和结构配置，特别是在Pt基系统如Pt-3d合金中，受到热力学偏好和反应条件的影响。铂是PEM燃料电池中流行的阴极电催化剂，但其对氧还原反应(ORR)的缓慢动力学限制了催化效率。近年来，由于Pt基合金的ORR活性增强，对其进行了广泛的研究。表面分层在这个过程中起着关键作用，在合金的最外层形成纯Pt皮肤。Pt基催化剂的增强稳定性与表面分层密切相关。为了理解Pt合金系统中的分层趋势和表面及次表面区域的成分，已经进行了大量的研究。然而，表面分层的动力学，这是阐明这种现象的驱动力和过程的关键，尚未在分子水平上得到充分解决。
