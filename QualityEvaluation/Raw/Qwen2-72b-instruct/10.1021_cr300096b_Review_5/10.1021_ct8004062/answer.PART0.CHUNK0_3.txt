1.Platinum is a popular cathode electrocatalyst in PEM fuel cells, but its sluggish kinetics for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) limits catalytic efficiency. In recent years, Pt-based alloys, composed of Pt and other transition metals, have been extensively investigated due to their enhanced ORR activity. Surface segregation plays a key role in this process, as a pure Pt-skin is formed in the outmost layer of the alloys due to surface segregation of Pt atoms. This leads to enhanced stability of Pt-based catalysts, which is closely related to surface segregation.

1.铂是聚合物电极膜(PEM)燃料电池中流行的阴极电催化剂，但其对氧还原反应(ORR)的相对缓慢的动力学显著限制了催化效率。近年来，由于Pt和其他过渡金属组成的Pt基合金的ORR活性增强，Pt基合金得到了广泛的研究。表面分层在这个过程中起着关键作用，因为由于铂原子的表面分层，在合金的最外层形成了纯的铂皮。这导致了Pt基催化剂的增强稳定性，这与表面分层密切相关。
