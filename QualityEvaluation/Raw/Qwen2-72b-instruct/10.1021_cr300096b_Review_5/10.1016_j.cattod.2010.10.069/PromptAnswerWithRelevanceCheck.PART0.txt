[1] "Under reductive conditions (vacuum and CO), 3d TM prefers to occupy in the subsurface layer due to its higher surface energy and smaller atomic size."
[2] "While under the oxidizing conditions, the strong O3d TMs interaction would induce 3d TM segregation to the surface, migrating further in the surface layer to form oxidized 3d TM islands."
[3] "We find that Pt (1 1 1) with the atomic dispersed 3d TM in surface layers is highly active for CO oxidation via bi-functional mechanism."
[4] "The interplay between structure and reaction environment as well as effect on the catalytic activity is highlighted."

1.The thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions significantly influence the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems such as Pt-3d alloys. Under reductive conditions, such as vacuum and carbon monoxide, 3d transition metals prefer to occupy the subsurface layer due to their higher surface energy and smaller atomic size. However, under oxidizing conditions, the strong interaction between oxygen and 3d transition metals induces the segregation of 3d transition metals to the surface, leading to the formation of oxidized 3d transition metal islands. This structural evolution has profound implications for the catalytic properties and performance of these materials in various applications. For instance, Pt (1 1 1) surfaces with atomic dispersed 3d transition metals in the surface layers exhibit high activity for CO oxidation through a bi-functional mechanism. The interplay between the structure, reaction environment, and catalytic activity is a critical factor in understanding and optimizing the performance of alloy catalysts.

1.热力学偏好和反应条件对双金属催化剂的稳定性、表面分层和结构配置有重大影响，特别是在Pt基系统如Pt-3d合金中。在还原条件下，如真空和一氧化碳，3d过渡金属倾向于占据次表面层，这是由于它们的表面能较高和原子尺寸较小。然而，在氧化条件下，氧气和3d过渡金属之间的强相互作用导致3d过渡金属向表面分层，形成氧化的3d过渡金属岛。这种结构演变对这些材料在各种应用中的催化性质和性能有深远的影响。例如，表面层中分散有原子3d过渡金属的Pt (1 1 1)表面在CO氧化中表现出高活性，通过双功能机制。结构、反应环境和催化活性之间的相互作用是理解和优化合金催化剂性能的关键因素。

Under reductive conditions, such as vacuum and carbon monoxide (CO) environments, 3d transition metals (TMs) tend to occupy the subsurface layer due to their higher surface energy and smaller atomic size. In contrast, under oxidizing conditions, the strong interaction between oxygen and 3d TMs leads to the segregation of 3d TMs to the surface, which can further migrate and form oxidized 3d TM islands.
