[1] "The stability of PdRu/Ru(0001) and PtRu/Ru(0001) surface alloys and the tendency for surface segregation of Pd and Pt subsurface guest metals in these surface alloys is studied by scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and Auger electron spec- troscopy (AES)."
[2] "Hence, the AES results confirm the findings of the STM mea- surements, with an (almost) complete restoration of the origi- nal surface alloy composition after Ru deposition and subse- quent re-alloying, indicative of (almost) complete segregation of the buried Pd (Pt) to the surface layer, and a slight loss of Pt during the re-alloying step."
[3] "The slight differences in the stability of the surface alloy may be caused by the lower Pd content (44%) in the surface alloy compared to Pt (70%)."
[4] "The preference for surface segregation of a metal atom dissolved in a host metal is related to the dif- ference in surface energies of the two species and the differ- ence of the two optimal nearest-neighbor distances of host and guest metal."
[5] "The surface energies decrease in the order Ru(0001) (1.31.6 eVatom1), Pt(111) (1 eVatom1) and Pd(111) (0.8 eVatom1),[6669] in good agreement with the ob- served tendency for segregation of Pt and Pd."
[6] "Also the size mismatch of the larger guest metals Pt (0.277 nm) and Pd (0.275 nm) compared to the Ru(0001) single crystal (0.270 nm) would favor the inclusion of the impurity metals in the tensile stressed outermost Ru layer, providing additional driving force for surface segregation."

1.The stability and surface segregation behavior of PdRu/Ru(0001) and PtRu/Ru(0001) surface alloys were investigated using scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and Auger electron spectroscopy (AES). The results showed that after Ru deposition and subsequent re-alloying, the original surface alloy composition was almost completely restored, indicating that the buried Pd and Pt were almost completely segregated to the surface layer. However, there was a slight loss of Pt during the re-alloying step. The slight differences in the stability of the surface alloy may be due to the lower Pd content (44%) in the surface alloy compared to Pt (70%). The preference for surface segregation of a metal atom dissolved in a host metal is related to the difference in surface energies of the two species and the difference in the optimal nearest-neighbor distances of host and guest metal. The surface energies decrease in the order Ru(0001) (1.31.6 eVatom1), Pt(111) (1 eVatom1) and Pd(111) (0.8 eVatom1), which is in good agreement with the observed tendency for segregation of Pt and Pd. The size mismatch of the larger guest metals Pt (0.277 nm) and Pd (0.275 nm) compared to the Ru(0001) single crystal (0.270 nm) would favor the inclusion of the impurity metals in the tensile stressed outermost Ru layer, providing additional driving force for surface segregation.

1.使用扫描隧道显微镜(STM)和Auger电子光谱(AES)研究了PdRu/Ru(0001)和PtRu/Ru(0001)表面合金的稳定性和表面分层行为。结果表明,在Ru沉积和随后的再合金化后,原始表面合金组成几乎完全恢复,表明埋藏的Pd和Pt几乎完全分层到表面层。然而,在再合金化过程中,Pt有轻微的损失。表面合金稳定性的微小差异可能是由于表面合金中Pd含量(44%)低于Pt(70%)。溶解在宿主金属中的金属原子对表面分层的偏好与两种物种的表面能量差异和宿主与客体金属的最优最近邻距离差异有关。表面能量按Ru(0001)(1.31.6 eVatom1)、Pt(111)(1 eVatom1)和Pd(111)(0.8 eVatom1)的顺序降低,这与观察到的Pt和Pd的分层趋势一致。与Ru(0001)单晶(0.270 nm)相比,较大的客体金属Pt(0.277 nm)和Pd(0.275 nm)的尺寸不匹配将有利于杂质金属在受拉应力的最外层Ru层中的包覆,为表面分层提供额外的驱动力。
