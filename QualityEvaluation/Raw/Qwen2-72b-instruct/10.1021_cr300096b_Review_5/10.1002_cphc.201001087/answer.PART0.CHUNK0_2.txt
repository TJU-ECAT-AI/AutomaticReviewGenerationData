[1] "The stability of PdRu/Ru(0001) and PtRu/Ru(0001) surface alloys and the tendency for surface segregation of Pd and Pt subsurface guest metals in these surface alloys is studied by scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and Auger electron spec- troscopy (AES)."
[2] "The floating behavior was studied in detail by following the variation in the surface morphology and structure during a series of four preparation steps: 1) deposition of Pt (Pd) on Ru(0001), 2) surface alloy formation by annealing to 1350 K (annealing at 1150 K for 10 s), 3) deposition of Ru on the sur- face alloy at 500 K, and 4) re-alloying by annealing to 1350 K (annealing at 1150 K for 10 s)."
[3] "Hence, the AES results confirm the findings of the STM mea- surements, with an (almost) complete restoration of the origi- nal surface alloy composition after Ru deposition and subse- quent re-alloying, indicative of (almost) complete segregation of the buried Pd (Pt) to the surface layer, and a slight loss of Pt during the re-alloying step."
[4] "The slight differences in the stability of the surface alloy may be caused by the lower Pd content (44%) in the surface alloy compared to Pt (70%)."
[5] "The preference for surface segregation of a metal atom dissolved in a host metal is related to the dif- ference in surface energies of the two species and the differ- ence of the two optimal nearest-neighbor distances of host and guest metal."
[6] "The surface energies decrease in the order Ru(0001) (1.31.6 eVatom1), Pt(111) (1 eVatom1) and Pd(111) (0.8 eVatom1),[6669] in good agreement with the ob- served tendency for segregation of Pt and Pd."
[7] "Also the size mismatch of the larger guest metals Pt (0.277 nm) and Pd (0.275 nm) compared to the Ru(0001) single crystal (0.270 nm) would favor the inclusion of the impurity metals in the tensile stressed outermost Ru layer, providing additional driving force for surface segregation."
[8] "Based on these data, considering only exchange between the surface layer and the subsurface region consisting of the second (bulk dissolution inhibited) and using the annealing temperatures of 1350 K and 1150 K, respectively, the probability that a small amount of Pt (Pd) on Ru(0001) is dissolved in the subsurface region (buried by a layer of substrate material) during surface alloy formation can be estimated by a simple Boltzmann ap- proach given by Equation (1):pbury  exp  DEseg kBT
1 This estimate results in very low probabilities of 0.16% to bury Pt in the subsurface region for PtRu/Ru(0001)[36] and of
0.004% for Pd in PdRu/Ru(0001),[29] which are negligible within
the experimental accuracy."
[9] "The ob- servation of a distinct bilayer island growth of Ru on the Pt0.70Ru0.30/Ru(0001) surface alloy at 500 K, in contrast to the layer-by-layer Ru growth on Pd0.44Ru0.56/Ru(0001) under similar growth conditions, may be attributed to the lower Pd content,the different 2D distribution of the components in the latter surface alloy with more Ru3 surface sites as compared to Pt0.70Ru0.30/Ru(0001), or to a less pronounced difference be- tween RuRu bonding and RuPd bonding."

1.The stability of PdRu/Ru(0001) and PtRu/Ru(0001) surface alloys and the tendency for surface segregation of Pd and Pt subsurface guest metals in these surface alloys were studied using scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and Auger electron spectroscopy (AES). The floating behavior was studied by following the variation in the surface morphology and structure during a series of four preparation steps: deposition of Pt (Pd) on Ru(0001), surface alloy formation by annealing, deposition of Ru on the surface alloy at 500 K, and re-alloying by annealing. The AES results confirmed the findings of the STM measurements, with an (almost) complete restoration of the original surface alloy composition after Ru deposition and subsequent re-alloying, indicative of (almost) complete segregation of the buried Pd (Pt) to the surface layer, and a slight loss of Pt during the re-alloying step. The slight differences in the stability of the surface alloy may be caused by the lower Pd content (44%) in the surface alloy compared to Pt (70%). The preference for surface segregation of a metal atom dissolved in a host metal is related to the difference in surface energies of the two species and the difference of the two optimal nearest-neighbor distances of host and guest metal. The surface energies decrease in the order Ru(0001) (1.31.6 eVatom1), Pt(111) (1 eVatom1) and Pd(111) (0.8 eVatom1), in good agreement with the observed tendency for segregation of Pt and Pd. Also the size mismatch of the larger guest metals Pt (0.277 nm) and Pd (0.275 nm) compared to the Ru(0001) single crystal (0.270 nm) would favor the inclusion of the impurity metals in the tensile stressed outermost Ru layer, providing additional driving force for surface segregation. The probability that a small amount of Pt (Pd) on Ru(0001) is dissolved in the subsurface region (buried by a layer of substrate material) during surface alloy formation can be estimated by a simple Boltzmann approach, resulting in very low probabilities of 0.16% to bury Pt in the subsurface region for PtRu/Ru(0001) and of 0.004% for Pd in PdRu/Ru(0001), which are negligible within the experimental accuracy. The observation of a distinct bilayer island growth of Ru on the Pt0.70Ru0.30/Ru(0001) surface alloy at 500 K, in contrast to the layer-by-layer Ru growth on Pd0.44Ru0.56/Ru(0001) under similar growth conditions, may be attributed to the lower Pd content, the different 2D distribution of the components in the latter surface alloy with more Ru3 surface sites as compared to Pt0.70Ru0.30/Ru(0001), or to a less pronounced difference between RuRu bonding and RuPd bonding.

1.研究了PdRu/Ru(0001)和PtRu/Ru(0001)表面合金的稳定性和Pd和Pt在这些表面合金中的表面分层倾向，使用了扫描隧道显微镜（STM）和Auger电子光谱（AES）。通过一系列四个制备步骤研究了浮动行为：在Ru(0001)上沉积Pt（Pd），通过退火形成表面合金，在500 K下在表面合金上沉积Ru，以及通过退火进行再合金化。AES结果证实了STM测量的结果，即在Ru沉积和随后的再合金化后，原始表面合金组成几乎完全恢复，这表明（几乎）完全的Pd（Pt）分层到表面层，以及在再合金化步骤中Pt的轻微损失。表面合金稳定性的微小差异可能是由于表面合金中Pd含量（44％）低于Pt（70％）。溶解在宿主金属中的金属原子的表面分层倾向与两种物种的表面能量差异和宿主和客体金属的两个最优近邻距离的差异有关。表面能量按Ru(0001)（1.31.6 eVatom1），Pt(111)（1 eVatom1）和Pd(111)（0.8 eVatom1）的顺序降低，与观察到的Pt和Pd的分层倾向一致。与Ru(0001)单晶（0.270 nm）相比，较大的客体金属Pt（0.277 nm）和Pd（0.275 nm）的尺寸不匹配将有利于杂质金属在拉应力最大的Ru外层的包含，为表面分层提供了额外的驱动力。在Ru(0001)上，一小部分Pt（Pd）在表面合金形成过程中溶解在次表面区域（被一层基体材料覆盖）的概率可以通过一个简单的Boltzmann方法估计，对于PtRu/Ru(0001)，埋藏Pt的概率为0.16％，对于PdRu/Ru(0001)，埋藏Pd的概率为0.004％，在实验精度范围内可以忽略不计。在500 K下，Ru在Pt0.70Ru0.30/Ru(0001)表面合金上的明显双层岛生长与在类似生长条件下Pd0.44Ru0.56/Ru(0001)上的层状Ru生长形成对比，这可能归因于较低的Pd含量，后一种表面合金中成分的2D分布不同，与Pt0.70Ru0.30/Ru(0001)相比，有更多的Ru3表面位点，或者RuRu键合和RuPd键合之间的差异不那么明显。
