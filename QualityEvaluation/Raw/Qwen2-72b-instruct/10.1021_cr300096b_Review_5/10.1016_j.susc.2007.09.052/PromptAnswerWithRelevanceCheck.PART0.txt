[4] "For many years, numerous efforts to search alternative catalysts to Pt have mainly focused on Pt-based bimetallic alloys, in which some of the platinum is replaced by less expensive metals."
[5] "Since the catalytic properties are chiefly determined by the surface geometry and the electronic structure which can be modified by the chemical composition of the bimetallic alloys, the catalytic effect can be considerably improved when appropriate structures are achieved."

[13] "The interlayer distance is also found to be correlated with the segregation energy."
[14] "Furthermore, this study reveals that the surface geometry is not responsible for the enhanced ORR activity of the Pt-skin surfaces for Pt3Ni(1 1 1) and Pt3Co(1 1 1); instead the modified electronic structure should plays a key role for the catalytic reactions."

1.二元合金，特别是基于Pt的系统（如Pt-3d合金）的稳定性，表面分层和结构配置受热力学偏好和反应条件的影响。一种金属物种在表面或第一亚表面层上富集其他成分的现象称为表面分层，由于其对材料科学和表面化学的重要性，引起了实验和理论的广泛关注。它影响许多重要的物理和化学性质，如渗透，表面吸附，晶体生长，金属腐蚀等。特别是，已经发现合金的催化活性可以通过表面分层发生巨大变化。Pt被用作许多重要化学反应（如甲醇氧化和碳氢化合物重整）的有效催化剂，特别是在燃料电池中，Pt已成为氧还原反应（ORR）中最广泛使用的电催化剂。多年来，寻找Pt替代催化剂的主要集中在基于Pt的二元合金上，其中一些铂被更便宜的金属取代。由于二元合金的催化性质主要由表面几何形状和电子结构决定，可以通过合金的化学组成进行修改，因此当实现适当的结构时，催化效果可以大大改善。在Pt与3d金属合金化的情况下，报告了增强的ORR活性。值得注意的是，表面分层在ORR中起着关键作用。例如，Stamenkovic等人比较了块状Pt3Co合金和Pt在退火合金表面最外层分层产生的Pt-皮肤结构上的ORR动力学。他们注意到ORR在Pt-皮肤表面上是独特的活性，反应速率是纯Pt催化剂的4倍。理论方法有助于阐明这种现象的驱动力和趋势。在这篇论文中，选择了广泛研究的Pt3M(1 1 1)（M = Ag，Au，Co，Cr，Cu，Fe，Ir，Mn，Mo，Ni，Pd，Re，Rh，Ru，Ti，V）合金系统。计算表明，表面分层不仅由原子大小和表面能量的大小决定，而且还由亚表面原子结构决定。值得注意的是，发现了Pt表面分层趋势与金属M从合金表面移出的位移之间的相关性。这种位移可以有效地预测表面分层，而不考虑亚表面分层结构。还发现层间距离与分层能相关。此外，这项研究揭示了表面几何形状不是Pt3Ni(1 1 1)和Pt3Co(1 1 1)的Pt-皮肤表面增强ORR活性的原因；相反，修改后的电子结构应该对催化反应起关键作用。

1.Surface segregation in bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems such as Pt-3d alloys, is influenced by thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions. This phenomenon, where one metal species enriches the surface or the first sub-surface layers over other components, has significant implications for materials science and surface chemistry. It affects physical and chemical properties such as permeation, surface adsorption, crystal growth, and metal corrosion. Notably, the catalytic activities of alloys can be dramatically altered through surface segregation. Pt, an efficient catalyst used in important chemical reactions like methanol oxidation and hydrocarbon reforming, is the most widely used electrocatalyst for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in fuel cells. Efforts to find alternative catalysts to Pt have focused on Pt-based bimetallic alloys, where some platinum is replaced by less expensive metals. The catalytic properties of these alloys are determined by the surface geometry and electronic structure, which can be modified by the chemical composition, leading to improved catalytic effects when appropriate structures are achieved. Enhanced ORR activities have been observed in Pt alloys with 3d metals, with surface segregation playing a key role. For example, Stamenkovic et al. found that the ORR on Pt-skin structures produced by Pt segregating on the surface of annealed Pt3Co alloys is uniquely active, with a reaction rate four times that of pure Pt. The enhanced activities can be attributed to the surface electronic structure and surface bond length of alloy systems. The surface geometry can considerably alter catalytic efficiency, but for Pt3Co (1 1 1) and Pt3Ni (1 1 1) systems, the maximum deviation of the surface bond length after Pt segregation is only 0.002 Å, indicating that the geometric effect does not contribute to the enhanced ORR activities of Pt-skin surfaces. Instead, the electronic structures modified through surface segregation are the main factor for such enhancement.

The catalytic properties are chiefly determined by the surface geometry and the electronic structure which can be modified by the chemical composition of the bimetallic alloys, the catalytic effect can be considerably improved when appropriate structures are achieved. Enhanced ORR activities have been reported in the case of Pt alloyed with 3d metals. Notably, surface segregation plays a key role in the ORR. For instance, Stamenkovic et al. compared the kinetics of the ORR on bulk Pt3Co alloy and on the Pt-skin structure produced by Pt segregating on the outmost layer of the annealed alloy surface. They noted that the ORR is uniquely active on the Pt-skin surface and the reaction rate is 4 times that for the pure Pt catalyst. Theoretical approaches can help to elucidate the driving force and the tendency of this phenomenon. Surface segregation is also governed by temperature and by the presence of adsorbates.

1.许多合金的表面化学成分与体相显著不同，这种现象称为表面偏析，由于其对材料科学和表面化学的重要性，引起了大量的实验和理论关注。表面偏析影响许多重要的物理和化学性质，如渗透、表面吸附、晶体生长、金属腐蚀等，并且发现合金的催化活性可以通过表面偏析发生显著变化。Pt作为一种高效的催化剂，被用于许多重要的化学反应，如甲醇氧化和碳氢化合物重整。特别是，Pt已成为燃料电池中氧还原反应(ORR)最广泛使用的电催化剂。多年来，寻找Pt替代催化剂的努力主要集中在Pt基双金属合金上，其中一些铂被更便宜的金属取代。催化性质主要由双金属合金的表面几何形状和电子结构决定，当达到适当的结构时，催化效果可以显著提高。在Pt与3d金属合金化的情况下，报告了增强的ORR活性。值得注意的是，表面偏析在ORR中起着关键作用。例如，Stamenkovic等人比较了块体Pt3Co合金和Pt在退火合金表面最外层偏析产生的Pt-skin结构上的ORR动力学。他们注意到，ORR在Pt-skin表面上是独特的活性，反应速率是纯Pt催化剂的4倍。理论方法有助于阐明这种现象的驱动力和趋势。表面偏析也受温度和吸附物的存在控制。
