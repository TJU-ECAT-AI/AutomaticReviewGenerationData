[1] "For many alloys, the chemical composition at the surface is significantly different from that in the bulk. In general, one metal species enriches the surface or the first sub-surface layers over other components. The phenomenon called surface segregation has drawn much experimental and theoretical attention due to its importance to materials science and surface chemistry."

[13] "For the well-studied Pt3Co (1 1 1) and Pt3Ni (1 1 1) systems, the maximum deviation of the surface bond length is only 0.002 Å after Pt segregation."

1.The chemical composition at the surface of many alloys is significantly different from that in the bulk, a phenomenon called surface segregation, which has drawn much experimental and theoretical attention due to its importance to materials science and surface chemistry.

1.许多合金的表面化学成分与体相显著不同，这种现象称为表面分层，由于其对材料科学和表面化学的重要性，引起了大量实验和理论的关注。表面分层影响许多重要的物理和化学性质，如渗透、表面吸附、晶体生长、金属腐蚀等。特别是，人们发现，通过表面分层，合金的催化活性可以发生显著变化。Pt被用作许多重要化学反应的有效催化剂，如甲醇氧化和碳氢化合物重整。特别是，Pt已成为燃料电池中氧还原反应(ORR)最广泛使用的电催化剂。多年来，寻找替代Pt的催化剂的努力主要集中在Pt基双金属合金上，其中一些铂被更便宜的金属取代。催化性能主要由双金属合金的表面几何形状和电子结构决定，当达到适当的结构时，催化效果可以显著提高。在Pt与3d金属合金化的情况下，报告了增强的ORR活性。值得注意的是，表面分层在ORR中起着关键作用。例如，Stamenkovic等人比较了块体Pt3Co合金和Pt在退火合金表面最外层分层产生的Pt-皮肤结构上的ORR动力学。他们注意到，ORR在Pt-皮肤表面是独特的活性，反应速率是纯Pt催化剂的4倍。增强的活性可归因于两个关键因素:合金系统的表面电子结构和表面键长。人们认为，表面几何形状能够显著改变催化效率。对于每个非分层合金，表面金属键长的变化范围很窄(最多0.12 Å)。对于Pt分层结构，发现表面几何形状接近非分层几何形状，尽管所有的M原子都被Pt原子取代。对于研究得很好的Pt3Co(1 1 1)和Pt3Ni(1 1 1)系统，在Pt分层后，表面键长的最大偏差仅为0.002 Å。因此，几何效应不会导致Pt-皮肤表面增强的ORR活性;相反，通过表面分层修改的电子结构应该是这种增强的主要因素。
