[1] "The higher stability of clean alloy surfaces can indeed be inferred by the calculated Pt d-band structure, which shows that the alloying generally leads to the stabilization of the Pt d-band,8b,34, and therefore the surface Pt atoms are more difficult to segregate or dissolve."
[2] "By contrast, in the presence of adsorbed O atoms the Pt removal is facilitated, because the surface vacancy can be more strongly stabilized by O atoms compared to the initial perfect surface."
[3] "This can be understood as follows. Firstly, the Pt atoms at the surface vacancy are less coordinated and possess more active d-states, which can more strongly bond with O atoms, compared to terrace Pt atoms."
[4] "Secondly, with the exposure of the second layer atoms at the surface vacancy, it is possible to form a much stronger OM bond compared to the OPt bond."
[5] "This is indeed observed in our search for the optimum structure after a Pt removal, which shows that the surface vacancy is preferentially terminated by O atoms that sink to bond with the solute M atoms at the second layer."
[6] "For example, in Pt2Ti skin alloys, the surface vacancies with a configuration containing OTi bonding are much more stable (by 1.44 eV) than those with only OPt bonding."
[7] "This is consistent with the fact that the atomic O on metals is anion-like, with a strong tendency to accept electrons, and prefers to form ionic-bonds."

1.从计算得到的Pt d带结构可以推断出清洁合金表面的稳定性，该结构显示合金化通常会导致Pt d带的稳定，从而使表面Pt原子更难分层或溶解。然而，在吸附O原子的存在下，Pt的去除被促进，因为表面空位可以被O原子更强烈地稳定。这是由于表面空位处的Pt原子的配位较少，具有更活跃的d态，与O原子的结合力比台地Pt原子更强。此外，随着表面空位处第二层原子的暴露，与OPt键相比，可以形成更强的OM键。这在Pt去除后寻找最优结构的观察中得到证实，显示表面空位优先被下沉到第二层与溶质M原子结合的O原子终止。例如，在Pt2Ti皮肤合金中，含有OTi键的表面空位比仅含OPt键的空位更稳定。这与金属上的原子O是阴离子状的，有强烈的接受电子倾向，并倾向于形成离子键的事实一致。

1.The stability of Pt alloys under electrochemical conditions is generally lower than that of pure Pt when the oxygen coverage is the same, and maintaining zero oxygen coverage at working potentials (such as 0.9 V) is crucial for achieving both high activity and stability. Among more than 20 different Pt2M alloys, molybdenum (Mo) is identified as a good element that can alloy with Pt to form a stable surface at high electrochemical potentials. Pt2Mo has a lower kinetic barrier for oxygen reduction (OR) compared to Pt, and the barrier to OOH dissociation is a key kinetic parameter for OR activity. The higher stability of clean alloy surfaces can be inferred from the calculated Pt d-band structure, which shows that alloying generally leads to the stabilization of the Pt d-band, making surface Pt atoms more difficult to segregate or dissolve. The stability of surfaces follows the order Pt2Mo > Pt > Pt2Ag > Pt2Pd > Pt2Nb > Pt2Ti > Pt2Sc > Pt2Zr, and only Pt2Mo exhibits higher stability than pure Pt at high potential (1.05 V). The oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) on a Pt2Mo alloy surface follows a similar reaction profile as on Pt, with the transition state (TS) for OOH dissociation determining the height of the potential profile. The TSs for OOH dissociation and O2 dissociation dictate the highest free energy positions in the reaction pathways. The aqueous environment, together with the in situ oxygen coverage, plays an important role in facilitating the ORR on alloy surfaces. The stability of PtxMo alloys drops quickly with increasing potential, in line with the rapid increase of surface oxygen coverage for PtxMo surfaces above 0.9 V. The Pt2Mo skin alloy achieves the best balance of stability and activity.

1.在相同的氧覆盖下，铂合金在电化学条件下的稳定性通常低于纯铂，而在工作电位（如0.9 V）下保持零氧覆盖对于实现高活性和稳定性至关重要。在超过20种不同的Pt2M合金中，鉴定出钼（Mo）是一种好的元素，可以与铂合金化，在高电化学电位下形成稳定的表面。Pt2Mo相对于Pt具有较低的氧还原（OR）动力学障碍，而OOH解离的障碍是OR活性的关键动力学参数。从计算出的Pt d带结构可以推断出清洁合金表面的较高稳定性，该结构显示合金化通常导致Pt d带的稳定，从而使表面铂原子更难分离或溶解。表面稳定性遵循Pt2Mo > Pt > Pt2Ag > Pt2Pd > Pt2Nb > Pt2Ti > Pt2Sc > Pt2Zr的顺序，只有Pt2Mo在高电位（1.05 V）下表现出比纯铂更高的稳定性。Pt2Mo合金表面的氧还原反应（ORR）遵循与Pt相似的反应轮廓，其中OOH解离的过渡态（TS）决定了电位轮廓的高度。OOH解离和O2解离的TS决定了反应路径中最高的自由能位置。水环境与原位氧覆盖一起在合金表面促进ORR中起着重要作用。PtxMo合金的稳定性随着电位的增加而迅速下降，这与PtxMo表面在0.9 V以上表面氧覆盖的迅速增加一致。Pt2Mo皮肤合金实现了稳定性和活性的最佳平衡。

[10] "Theoretically, the thermodynamic equilibrium O coverage under electrochemical potentials can be determined by constructing the surface phase diagram."

1.Pt基合金（如Pt-3d合金）的稳定性受电化学条件下氧覆盖度的影响。在相同的氧覆盖度下，合金通常比纯Pt的稳定性差。在工作电位下保持零氧覆盖度对于实现高活性和稳定性至关重要。从计算得到的Pt d带结构可以推断出清洁合金表面的稳定性，该结构显示合金化通常导致Pt d带的稳定，使表面Pt原子更难分层或溶解。合金的稳定性对合金元素和氧覆盖度都敏感，因此在电化学电位下，比纯Pt低得多的氧覆盖度是稳定氧还原反应（ORR）催化剂的先决条件。在高电位下，只有Pt2Mo的稳定性高于纯Pt。Pt2Mo皮肤合金实现了稳定性和活性的最佳平衡，Mo含量约为30%时效果最佳。
