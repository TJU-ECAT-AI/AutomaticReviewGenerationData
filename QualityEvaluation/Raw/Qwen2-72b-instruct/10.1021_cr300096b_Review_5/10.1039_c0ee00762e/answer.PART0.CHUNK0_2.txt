[1] "By analyzing a large set of Pt alloys, we show that alloys are in general less stable than Pt at the same O coverage under electrochemical conditions, and that maintaining a zero O coverage at the working potentials (e.g. 0.9 V) is key to achieve both high activity and stability."
[2] "The higher stability of clean alloy surfaces can indeed be inferred by the calculated Pt d-band structure, which shows that the alloying generally leads to the stabilization of the Pt d-band,8b,33,34 and therefore the surface Pt atoms are more difficult to segregate or dissolve."
[3] "Since the stability of alloys is sensitive to both the alloying element and the coverage of O, it is naturally expected that a considerably lower O coverage at the concerned electrochemical potentials (0.81.2 V) than that on Pt is a prerequisite for a stable ORR catalyst."
[4] "The results imply that the stability of even skin alloys under electrochemical conditions could be a severe problem for the long-term operation of cathodes, without even mentioning the activity."
[5] "The higher stability of clean alloy surfaces can indeed be inferred by the calculated Pt d-band structure, which shows that the alloying generally leads to the stabilization of the Pt d-band,8b,33,34 and therefore the surface Pt atoms are more difficult to segregate or dissolve."
[6] "By contrast, in the presence of adsorbed O atoms the Pt removal is facilitated, because the surface vacancy can be more strongly stabilized by O atoms compared to the initial perfect surface."
[7] "This is indeed observed in our search for the optimum structure after a Pt removal, which shows that the surface vacancy is preferentially terminated by O atoms that sink to bond with the solute M atoms at the second layer."
[8] "For example, in Pt2Ti skin alloys, the surface vacancies with a configuration containing OTi bonding are much more stable (by 1.44 eV) than those with only OPt bonding."
[9] "This is consistent with the fact that the atomic O on metals is anion-like, with a strong tendency to accept electrons, and prefers to form ionic-bonds."
[10] "Theoretically, the thermodynamic equilibrium O coverage under electrochemical potentials can be determined by constructing the surface phase diagram."
[11] "Therefore, our next step is to select seven representative Pt2M skin alloys (M = 3d: Sc, Ti; 4d: Zr, Nb, Mo, Ag, Pd) to determine their O coverage at around 1 V and examine their stability."
[12] "At this time, 4d metals are taken as the major candidates because their ΔGc* are generally larger than those of 3d metal alloys in the presence of O (Fig. 1)."
[13] "It reveals that up to the high potential 1.05 V, only Pt2Mo exhibits a higher stability than pure Pt."
[14] "With Mo being identified as a promising alloying candidate, we are now in the position to examine the ORR reaction kinetics at 0.80.9 V potentials to ensure that ORR can also occur efficiently on Pt2Mo."
[15] "The TS for OOH dissociation dictates the height of the potential profile, and in all systems the overall barrier, ΔG (the free energy difference between the adsorbed O2 and the TS for OOH dissociation), determines the activity."
[16] "By comparing Pt2Mo with Pt, we can see that the O/OH (ΔG1 + ΔG3 in Fig. 3) and molecular O2 (ΔG1) bind more strongly on the O-covered Pt surface, while the free energy of the OOH state (ΔG1 + ΔG2) and the TS for OOH dissociation (ΔG + ΔG1) are similar for Pt2Mo and Pt."
[17] "As a result, the overall barrier ΔG is about 0.2 eV lower on Pt2Mo than that on Pt, due to the reduced O2adsorption on the skin alloy surface."
[18] "For example, at 0.9 V, the ΔG on Pt is 0.63 V, while it is only 0.43 eV on Pt2Mo."
[19] "From microkinetics, it can be deduced that the overall rate at 0.9 V (under the standard conditions) on the Pt2Mo surface is three orders of magnitude faster than that on Pt provided with the same preexpoential factor."
[20] "These results demonstrate that the aqueous environment, together with the in situ O coverage, plays an important role in facilitating the ORR on alloy surfaces."
[21] "Finally, it is interesting to ask whether there is an optimum Pt:Mo ratio in the PtxMo skin alloys."
[22] "To identify the best ratio, we further considered three skin alloys with varied Pt:Mo ratios (x = 11, 5 and 1), and their activity and stability were then evaluated and compared with those of the Pt2Mo skin alloy."
[23] "We notice that due to the too weak adsorption of O2 and O on PtMo, the dissociation of OOH on PtMo becomes kinetically difficult, which leads to the high overall barrier on PtMo."
[24] "Therefore, we can conclude that the Pt2Mo skin alloy achieves the best balance of stability and activity."
[25] "A low Mo content (below 30% e.g.Pt5Mo) may achieve a higher stability at high potentials but the activity is not better than Pt at 0.9 V, whilst a high Mo content (above 30%, e.g.PtMo) will start to destabilize the alloy and also reduce the activity."

1.The stability of Pt-based alloys, such as Pt-3d alloys, is influenced by the oxygen coverage under electrochemical conditions.
