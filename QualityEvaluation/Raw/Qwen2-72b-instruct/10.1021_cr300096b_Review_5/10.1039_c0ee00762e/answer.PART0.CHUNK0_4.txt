[1] "By analyzing a large set of Pt alloys, we show that alloys are in general less stable than Pt at the same O coverage under electrochemical conditions, and that maintaining a zero O coverage at the working potentials (e.g. 0.9 V) is key to achieve both high activity and stability."
[2] "The higher stability of clean alloy surfaces can indeed be inferred by the calculated Pt d-band structure, which shows that the alloying generally leads to the stabilization of the Pt d-band,8b,33,34 and therefore the surface Pt atoms are more difficult to segregate or dissolve."
[3] "Since the stability of alloys is sensitive to both the alloying element and the coverage of O, it is naturally expected that a considerably lower O coverage at the concerned electrochemical potentials (0.81.2 V) than that on Pt is a prerequisite for a stable ORR catalyst."
[4] "It reveals that up to the high potential 1.05 V, only Pt2Mo exhibits a higher stability than pure Pt."
[5] "Therefore, we can conclude that the Pt2Mo skin alloy achieves the best balance of stability and activity. A low Mo content (below 30% e.g.Pt5Mo) may achieve a higher stability at high potentials but the activity is not better than Pt at 0.9 V, whilst a high Mo content (above 30%, e.g.PtMo) will start to destabilize the alloy and also reduce the activity."

1.The stability of Pt-based alloys, such as Pt-3d alloys, is influenced by the oxygen coverage under electrochemical conditions. Alloys are generally less stable than pure Pt at the same oxygen coverage. Maintaining a zero oxygen coverage at working potentials is crucial for achieving both high activity and stability. The stability of clean alloy surfaces can be inferred from the calculated Pt d-band structure, which shows that alloying generally leads to the stabilization of the Pt d-band, making surface Pt atoms more difficult to segregate or dissolve. The stability of alloys is sensitive to both the alloying element and the oxygen coverage, and a considerably lower oxygen coverage at electrochemical potentials is a prerequisite for a stable oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) catalyst. Pt2Mo exhibits higher stability than pure Pt at high potentials. The Pt2Mo skin alloy achieves the best balance of stability and activity, with a Mo content of around 30% being optimal.

1.Pt基合金（如Pt-3d合金）的稳定性受电化学条件下氧覆盖度的影响。在相同的氧覆盖度下，合金通常比纯Pt的稳定性差。在工作电位下保持零氧覆盖度对于实现高活性和稳定性至关重要。从计算得到的Pt d带结构可以推断出清洁合金表面的稳定性，该结构显示合金化通常导致Pt d带的稳定，使表面Pt原子更难分层或溶解。合金的稳定性对合金元素和氧覆盖度都敏感，因此在电化学电位下，比纯Pt低得多的氧覆盖度是稳定氧还原反应（ORR）催化剂的先决条件。在高电位下，只有Pt2Mo的稳定性高于纯Pt。Pt2Mo皮肤合金实现了稳定性和活性的最佳平衡，Mo含量约为30%时效果最佳。
