[1] "By analyzing a large set of Pt alloys, we show that alloys are in general less stable than Pt at the same O coverage under electrochemical conditions, and that maintaining a zero O coverage at the working potentials (e.g. 0.9 V) is key to achieve both high activity and stability."
[2] "From more than 20 different Pt2M alloys, we identify Mo as a good element, which can alloy with Pt to make a stable surface at high electrochemical potentials."
[3] "We further show that Pt2Mo possesses a lower kinetic barrier for OR compared to Pt, and the barrier towards OOH dissociation is a key kinetic parameter for OR activity."
[4] "The higher stability of clean alloy surfaces can indeed be inferred by the calculated Pt d-band structure, which shows that the alloying generally leads to the stabilization of the Pt d-band,8b,33,34 and therefore the surface Pt atoms are more difficult to segregate or dissolve."
[5] "This shows that the stability of the surfaces follows the order Pt2Mo > Pt > Pt2Ag > Pt2Pd > Pt2Nb > Pt2Ti > Pt2Sc > Pt2Zr. It reveals that up to the high potential 1.05 V, only Pt2Mo exhibits a higher stability than pure Pt."
[6] "The ORR on a Pt2Mo alloy surface follows a similar reaction profile as that on Pt, as shown in Fig. 3. The TS for OOH dissociation dictates the height of the potential profile, and in all systems the overall barrier, ΔG (the free energy difference between the adsorbed O2 and the TS for OOH dissociation), determines the activity."
[7] "We found that these TSs dictate the highest free energy positions in the reaction pathways."
[8] "The results demonstrate that the aqueous environment, together with the in situ O coverage, plays an important role in facilitating the ORR on alloy surfaces."
[9] "The stability of the PtxMo alloys drops quickly with increasing potential, which is in line with the rapid increase of surface O coverage for PtxMo surfaces above 0.9 V."
[10] "Therefore, we can conclude that the Pt2Mo skin alloy achieves the best balance of stability and activity."

1.The stability of Pt alloys under electrochemical conditions is generally lower than that of pure Pt when the oxygen coverage is the same, and maintaining zero oxygen coverage at working potentials (such as 0.9 V) is crucial for achieving both high activity and stability. Among more than 20 different Pt2M alloys, molybdenum (Mo) is identified as a good element that can alloy with Pt to form a stable surface at high electrochemical potentials. Pt2Mo has a lower kinetic barrier for oxygen reduction (OR) compared to Pt, and the barrier to OOH dissociation is a key kinetic parameter for OR activity. The higher stability of clean alloy surfaces can be inferred from the calculated Pt d-band structure, which shows that alloying generally leads to the stabilization of the Pt d-band, making surface Pt atoms more difficult to segregate or dissolve. The stability of surfaces follows the order Pt2Mo > Pt > Pt2Ag > Pt2Pd > Pt2Nb > Pt2Ti > Pt2Sc > Pt2Zr, and only Pt2Mo exhibits higher stability than pure Pt at high potential (1.05 V). The oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) on a Pt2Mo alloy surface follows a similar reaction profile as on Pt, with the transition state (TS) for OOH dissociation determining the height of the potential profile. The TSs for OOH dissociation and O2 dissociation dictate the highest free energy positions in the reaction pathways. The aqueous environment, together with the in situ oxygen coverage, plays an important role in facilitating the ORR on alloy surfaces. The stability of PtxMo alloys drops quickly with increasing potential, in line with the rapid increase of surface oxygen coverage for PtxMo surfaces above 0.9 V. The Pt2Mo skin alloy achieves the best balance of stability and activity.

1.在相同的氧覆盖下，铂合金在电化学条件下的稳定性通常低于纯铂，而在工作电位（如0.9 V）下保持零氧覆盖对于实现高活性和稳定性至关重要。在超过20种不同的Pt2M合金中，鉴定出钼（Mo）是一种好的元素，可以与铂合金化，在高电化学电位下形成稳定的表面。Pt2Mo相对于Pt具有较低的氧还原（OR）动力学障碍，而OOH解离的障碍是OR活性的关键动力学参数。从计算出的Pt d带结构可以推断出清洁合金表面的较高稳定性，该结构显示合金化通常导致Pt d带的稳定，从而使表面铂原子更难分离或溶解。表面稳定性遵循Pt2Mo > Pt > Pt2Ag > Pt2Pd > Pt2Nb > Pt2Ti > Pt2Sc > Pt2Zr的顺序，只有Pt2Mo在高电位（1.05 V）下表现出比纯铂更高的稳定性。Pt2Mo合金表面的氧还原反应（ORR）遵循与Pt相似的反应轮廓，其中OOH解离的过渡态（TS）决定了电位轮廓的高度。OOH解离和O2解离的TS决定了反应路径中最高的自由能位置。水环境与原位氧覆盖一起在合金表面促进ORR中起着重要作用。PtxMo合金的稳定性随着电位的增加而迅速下降，这与PtxMo表面在0.9 V以上表面氧覆盖的迅速增加一致。Pt2Mo皮肤合金实现了稳定性和活性的最佳平衡。
