[1] "By analyzing a large set of Pt alloys, we show that alloys are in general less stable than Pt at the same O coverage under electrochemical conditions, and that maintaining a zero O coverage at the working potentials (e.g. 0.9 V) is key to achieve both high activity and stability."
[2] "From more than 20 different Pt2M alloys, we identify Mo as a good element, which can alloy with Pt to make a stable surface at high electrochemical potentials."
[3] "We further show that Pt2Mo possesses a lower kinetic barrier for OR compared to Pt, and the barrier towards OOH dissociation is a key kinetic parameter for OR activity."
[4] "The higher stability of clean alloy surfaces can indeed be inferred by the calculated Pt d-band structure, which shows that the alloying generally leads to the stabilization of the Pt d-band,8b,33,34 and therefore the surface Pt atoms are more difficult to segregate or dissolve."
[5] "The results imply that the stability of even skin alloys under electrochemical conditions could be a severe problem for the long-term operation of cathodes, without even mentioning the activity."
[6] "Theoretically, the thermodynamic equilibrium O coverage under electrochemical potentials can be determined by constructing the surface phase diagram."
[7] "It reveals that up to the high potential 1.05 V, only Pt2Mo exhibits a higher stability than pure Pt."
[8] "The ORR on a Pt2Mo alloy surface follows a similar reaction profile as that on Pt, as shown in Fig. 3."
[9] "We can see that the O/OH (ΔG1 + ΔG3 in Fig. 3) and molecular O2 (ΔG1) bind more strongly on the O-covered Pt surface, while the free energy of the OOH state (ΔG1 + ΔG2) and the TS for OOH dissociation (ΔG + ΔG1) are similar for Pt2Mo and Pt."
[10] "The overall barrier ΔG is about 0.2 eV lower on Pt2Mo than that on Pt, due to the reduced O2adsorption on the skin alloy surface."
[11] "The aqueous environment, together with the in situ O coverage, plays an important role in facilitating the ORR on alloy surfaces."
[12] "The optimum content of Mo in PtxMo skin alloy is 30%."
[13] "Therefore, we can conclude that the Pt2Mo skin alloy achieves the best balance of stability and activity."

1.The stability of Pt-based alloys, such as Pt-3d alloys, is influenced by the oxygen coverage under electrochemical conditions. Maintaining zero oxygen coverage at working potentials is crucial for achieving high activity and stability. Pt2Mo is identified as a good candidate for a stable surface at high electrochemical potentials. The Pt2Mo alloy has a lower kinetic barrier for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) compared to Pt, and the barrier towards OOH dissociation is a key parameter for OR activity. The stability of clean alloy surfaces can be inferred from the calculated Pt d-band structure, which shows that alloying generally stabilizes the Pt d-band, making surface Pt atoms more difficult to segregate or dissolve. However, the stability of even skin alloys under electrochemical conditions could be a severe problem for the long-term operation of cathodes. The thermodynamic equilibrium oxygen coverage under electrochemical potentials can be determined by constructing the surface phase diagram. At high potential 1.05 V, only Pt2Mo exhibits higher stability than pure Pt. The ORR on a Pt2Mo alloy surface follows a similar reaction profile as that on Pt. The O/OH and molecular O2 bind more strongly on the O-covered Pt surface, while the free energy of the OOH state and the TS for OOH dissociation are similar for Pt2Mo and Pt. The overall barrier ΔG is about 0.2 eV lower on Pt2Mo than that on Pt, due to the reduced O2 adsorption on the skin alloy surface. The aqueous environment and the in situ O coverage play an important role in facilitating the ORR on alloy surfaces. The optimum content of Mo in PtxMo skin alloy is 30%. The Pt2Mo skin alloy achieves the best balance of stability and activity.

1.Pt基合金（如Pt-3d合金）的稳定性受电化学条件下氧覆盖度的影响。在工作电位下保持零氧覆盖度对于实现高活性和稳定性至关重要。Pt2Mo被鉴定为在高电化学电位下具有稳定表面的良好候选者。Pt2Mo合金的氧还原反应（ORR）的动能势垒比Pt低，而向OOH解离的势垒是OR活性的关键参数。从计算的Pt d带结构可以推断出清洁合金表面的稳定性，该结构显示合金化通常稳定Pt d带，使表面Pt原子更难分隔或溶解。然而，即使皮肤合金在电化学条件下的稳定性也可能对阴极的长期运行构成严重问题。电化学电位下氧的热力学平衡覆盖度可以通过构建表面相图来确定。在高电位1.05 V下，只有Pt2Mo比纯Pt具有更高的稳定性。Pt2Mo合金表面的ORR遵循与Pt相似的反应轮廓。O/OH和分子O2在O覆盖的Pt表面上结合得更牢固，而OOH状态的自由能和OOH解离的TS在Pt2Mo和Pt中相似。由于皮肤合金表面上O2吸附减少，Pt2Mo上的总势垒ΔG比Pt低约0.2 eV。水环境和原位O覆盖度在促进合金表面上的ORR中起着重要作用。PtxMo皮肤合金中Mo的最佳含量为30%。Pt2Mo皮肤合金实现了稳定性和活性的最佳平衡。
