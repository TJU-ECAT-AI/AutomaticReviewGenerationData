[1] "The coprecipitation was carried out by dissolving Ce(NO3)4 together with a precursor for the dopant, which was either a nitrate (for Gd, Y, La, Sm, Yb, Pr dopants), or a chloride (for Nb, Ta dopants), or an oxynitrate ZrO(NO3)2 (for Zr dopant)."
[2] "The solvent was evaporated, which caused coprecipitation, and the residue was calcined at 600 C in air."
[3] "The Nb-doped ceria was also prepared by the coprecipitation of an aqueous solution of Ce(NO3)4 and NbCl5 by treatment with NH4OH."
[4] "The two Nb-doped ceria samples have different n-butane combustion rates: the rate for the sample made from hydroxide was 5% higher."
[5] "The effective activation energies were also different (85 kJ/mol for the sample obtained from the coprecipitated hydroxides and 105 kJ/mol for the other sample)."

1.The coprecipitation method for synthesizing doped ceria catalysts involves dissolving Ce(NO3)4 with a precursor for the dopant, which can be a nitrate for Gd, Y, La, Sm, Yb, Pr dopants, a chloride for Nb, Ta dopants, or an oxynitrate for Zr dopant. The solvent is evaporated to cause coprecipitation, and the residue is calcined at 600 degrees Celsius in air. For Nb-doped ceria, an aqueous solution of Ce(NO3)4 and NbCl5 is treated with NH4OH. Different preparation techniques can lead to variations in the structural properties and catalytic performance of the resulting catalysts. For instance, the Nb-doped ceria samples prepared by different methods have different n-butane combustion rates, with the sample made from hydroxide having a 5% higher rate. The effective activation energies also differ, being 85 kJ/mol for the sample obtained from the coprecipitated hydroxides and 105 kJ/mol for the other sample.

1.合成掺杂氧化铈催化剂的共沉淀方法涉及将Ce(NO3)4与掺杂剂的前体溶解，掺杂剂可以是Gd，Y，La，Sm，Yb，Pr掺杂剂的硝酸盐，Nb，Ta掺杂剂的氯化物，或Zr掺杂剂的氧硝酸盐。溶剂被蒸发以引起共沉淀，残留物在空气中的600摄氏度下煅烧。对于Nb掺杂的氧化铈，将Ce(NO3)4和NbCl5的水溶液用NH4OH处理。不同的制备技术可以导致最终催化剂的结构特性和催化性能的变化。例如，通过不同方法制备的Nb掺杂氧化铈样品具有不同的n-丁烷燃烧速率，其中从氢氧化物制备的样品的速率高5％。有效活化能也不同，从共沉淀氢氧化物获得的样品为85 kJ/mol，而其他样品为105 kJ/mol。
