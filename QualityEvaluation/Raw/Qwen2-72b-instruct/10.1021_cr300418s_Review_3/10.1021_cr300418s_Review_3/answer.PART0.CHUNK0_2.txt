[1] "The coprecipitation was carried out by dissolving Ce(NO3)4 together with a precursor for the dopant, which was either a nitrate (for Gd, Y, La, Sm, Yb, Pr dopants), or a chloride (for Nb, Ta dopants), or an oxynitrate ZrO(NO3)2 (for Zr dopant)."
[2] "The solvent was evaporated, which caused coprecipitation, and the residue was calcined at 600 C in air."
[3] "The Nb-doped ceria was also prepared by the coprecipitation of an aqueous solution of Ce(NO3)4 and NbCl5 by treatment with NH4OH."
[4] "The precipitate was washed, dried, and calcined in air at 600 C."
[5] "The two Nb-doped ceria samples have different n-butane combustion rates: the rate for the sample made from hydroxide was 5% higher."
[6] "The effective activation energies were also different (85 kJ/mol for the sample obtained from the coprecipitated hydroxides and 105 kJ/mol for the other sample)."

The coprecipitation method for synthesizing doped ceria catalysts involves dissolving Ce(NO3)4 with a precursor for the dopant, which can be a nitrate for Gd, Y, La, Sm, Yb, Pr dopants, a chloride for Nb, Ta dopants, or an oxynitrate for Zr dopant. The solvent is evaporated to cause coprecipitation, and the residue is calcined at 600 degrees Celsius in air. For Nb-doped ceria, an aqueous solution of Ce(NO3)4 and NbCl5 is treated with NH4OH, and the precipitate is washed, dried, and calcined in air at 600 degrees Celsius. The preparation technique affects the structural properties and catalytic performance of the resulting catalysts. For example, two Nb-doped ceria samples have different n-butane combustion rates, with the sample made from hydroxide having a 5% higher rate. The effective activation energies also differ, with 85 kJ/mol for the sample obtained from the coprecipitated hydroxides and 105 kJ/mol for the other sample.

合成掺杂氧化铈催化剂的共沉淀法包括将Ce(NO3)4与掺杂剂前体溶解，掺杂剂前体可以是用于Gd，Y，La，Sm，Yb，Pr掺杂剂的硝酸盐，用于Nb，Ta掺杂剂的氯化物，或用于Zr掺杂剂的氧硝酸盐。溶剂被蒸发以引起共沉淀，残留物在600摄氏度的空气中煅烧。对于Nb掺杂的氧化铈，将Ce(NO3)4和NbCl5的水溶液与NH4OH处理，沉淀物在空气中在600摄氏度下洗涤，干燥和煅烧。制备技术影响了所得催化剂的结构特性和催化性能。例如，两个Nb掺杂的氧化铈样品具有不同的n-丁烷燃烧速率，其中从氢氧化物制成的样品的速率高5％。有效活化能也不同，从共沉淀的氢氧化物获得的样品为85 kJ/mol，而另一个样品为105 kJ/mol。
