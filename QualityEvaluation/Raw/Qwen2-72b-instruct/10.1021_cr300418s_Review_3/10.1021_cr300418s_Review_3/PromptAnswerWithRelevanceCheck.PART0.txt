Explain the coprecipitation method for synthesizing doped ceria catalysts, including the process variations and types of dopants used, and analyze how different preparation techniques affect the structural properties and catalytic performance of the resulting catalysts, using the example of Nb-doped ceria to illustrate the impact on n-butane combustion rates and activation energies.

[1] "The coprecipitation was carried out by dissolving Ce(NO3)4 together with a precursor for the dopant, which was either a nitrate (for Gd, Y, La, Sm, Yb, Pr dopants), or a chloride (for Nb, Ta dopants), or an oxynitrate ZrO(NO3)2 (for Zr dopant)."
[2] "The solvent was evaporated, which caused coprecipitation, and the residue was calcined at 600 C in air."
[3] "The Nb-doped ceria was also prepared by the coprecipitation of an aqueous solution of Ce(NO3)4 and NbCl5 by treatment with NH4OH."
[4] "The two Nb-doped ceria samples have different n-butane combustion rates: the rate for the sample made from hydroxide was 5% higher."
[5] "The effective activation energies were also different (85 kJ/mol for the sample obtained from the coprecipitated hydroxides and 105 kJ/mol for the other sample)."

合成掺杂氧化铈催化剂的共沉淀方法包括溶解Ce(NO3)4和掺杂前体，掺杂前体可以是用于Gd，Y，La，Sm，Yb，Pr掺杂剂的硝酸盐，用于Nb，Ta掺杂剂的氯化物，或用于Zr掺杂剂的氧硝酸盐。溶剂被蒸发以引起共沉淀，残留物在空气中的600摄氏度下煅烧。对于Nb掺杂的氧化铈，通过用NH4OH处理Ce(NO3)4和NbCl5的水溶液来制备。不同的制备技术会影响所得催化剂的结构特性和催化性能。例如，通过不同方法制备的Nb掺杂氧化铈样品具有不同的n-丁烷燃烧速率，其中从氢氧化物制备的样品的速率高5％。有效活化能也不同，从共沉淀氢氧化物获得的样品为85 kJ/mol，而另一个样品为105 kJ/mol。
