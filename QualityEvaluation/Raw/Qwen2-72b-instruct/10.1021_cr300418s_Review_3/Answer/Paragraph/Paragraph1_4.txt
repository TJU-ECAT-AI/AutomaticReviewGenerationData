                    The coprecipitation method for synthesizing doped ceria catalysts, as elucidated in reference \[10.1021/cr300418s_3\], involves the dissolution of Ce(NO3)4 with a precursor for the dopant, which can be a nitrate for Gd, Y, La, Sm, Yb, Pr dopants, a chloride for Nb, Ta dopants, or an oxynitrate for Zr dopant. The solvent is evaporated to cause coprecipitation, and the residue is calcined at 600 degrees Celsius in air. For Nb-doped ceria, an aqueous solution of Ce(NO3)4 and NbCl5 is treated with NH4OH, and the precipitate is washed, dried, and calcined in air at 600 degrees Celsius. Different preparation techniques can significantly influence the structural properties and catalytic performance of the resulting catalysts. For instance, the Nb-doped ceria samples prepared by varying methods exhibit different n-butane combustion rates, with the sample made from hydroxide showing a 5% higher rate. The effective activation energies are also distinct, with the sample obtained from the coprecipitated hydroxides having a lower activation energy.

                    Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: Considering the advancements and findings discussed in the file, there is a promising avenue to explore the optimization of coprecipitation conditions and the selection of dopants for enhancing the catalytic performance of doped ceria catalysts in propane dehydrogenation. Future research endeavors might focus on the systematic investigation of the impact of different dopants and their concentrations on the structural properties and catalytic activity. Additionally, the development of novel preparation techniques that can further refine the control over the catalyst's morphology and surface area could lead to significant improvements in catalytic efficiency and selectivity.

                    合成掺杂氧化铈催化剂的共沉淀方法，如参考文献\[10.1021/cr300418s_3\]所述，包括Ce(NO3)4与掺杂剂前体的溶解，掺杂剂前体可以是Gd, Y, La, Sm, Yb, Pr掺杂剂的硝酸盐，Nb, Ta掺杂剂的氯化物，或Zr掺杂剂的氧硝酸盐。溶剂被蒸发以引起共沉淀，残余物在空气中600度下煅烧。对于Nb掺杂的氧化铈，Ce(NO3)4和NbCl5的水溶液用NH4OH处理，沉淀物在空气中600度下洗涤、干燥和煅烧。不同的制备技术可以显著影响最终催化剂的结构特性和催化性能。例如，通过不同方法制备的Nb掺杂氧化铈样品表现出不同的n-丁烷燃烧速率，其中从氢氧化物制备的样品显示出5%更高的速率。有效活化能也各不相同，从共沉淀氢氧化物获得的样品具有较低的活化能。
