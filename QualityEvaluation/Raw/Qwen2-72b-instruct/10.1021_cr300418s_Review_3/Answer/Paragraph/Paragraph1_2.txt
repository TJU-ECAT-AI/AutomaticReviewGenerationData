                The coprecipitation method for synthesizing doped ceria catalysts, as elucidated in reference \[10.1021/cr300418s_3\], involves dissolving Ce(NO3)4 with a precursor for the dopant, which can be a nitrate for Gd, Y, La, Sm, Yb, Pr dopants, a chloride for Nb, Ta dopants, or an oxynitrate for Zr dopant. The solvent is evaporated to cause coprecipitation, and the residue is calcined at 600 degrees Celsius in air. For Nb-doped ceria, an aqueous solution of Ce(NO3)4 and NbCl5 is treated with NH4OH, and the precipitate is washed, dried, and calcined in air at 600 degrees Celsius. Different preparation techniques can significantly affect the structural properties and catalytic performance of the resulting catalysts. For instance, the Nb-doped ceria samples prepared by different methods exhibit distinct n-butane combustion rates, with the sample made from hydroxide having a 5% higher rate. The effective activation energies are also notably different, with the sample obtained from the coprecipitated hydroxides having a lower activation energy.

                通过参考文献\[10.1021/cr300418s_3\]的阐述，掺杂氧化铈催化剂的共沉淀合成方法包括将Ce(NO3)4与掺杂剂前体溶解，掺杂剂前体可以是Gd, Y, La, Sm, Yb, Pr掺杂剂的硝酸盐，Nb, Ta掺杂剂的氯化物，或Zr掺杂剂的氧硝酸盐。溶剂蒸发以引起共沉淀，残余物在空气中600度下煅烧。对于Nb掺杂的氧化铈，Ce(NO3)4和NbCl5的水溶液用NH4OH处理，沉淀物在空气中600度下洗涤、干燥和煅烧。不同的制备技术可以显著影响所得催化剂的结构特性和催化性能。例如，通过不同方法制备的Nb掺杂氧化铈样品表现出不同的n-丁烷燃烧速率，从氢氧化物制备的样品速率高5%。有效活化能也明显不同，从共沉淀氢氧化物获得的样品活化能较低。
