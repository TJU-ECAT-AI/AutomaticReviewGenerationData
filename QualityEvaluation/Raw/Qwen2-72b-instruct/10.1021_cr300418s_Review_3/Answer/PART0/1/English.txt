The coprecipitation method for synthesizing doped ceria catalysts involves dissolving Ce(NO3)4 with a precursor for the dopant, which can be a nitrate for Gd, Y, La, Sm, Yb, Pr dopants, a chloride for Nb, Ta dopants, or an oxynitrate for Zr dopant. The solvent is evaporated to cause coprecipitation, and the residue is calcined at 600 degrees Celsius in air. For Nb-doped ceria, an aqueous solution of Ce(NO3)4 and NbCl5 is treated with NH4OH, and the precipitate is washed, dried, and calcined in air at 600 degrees Celsius. Different preparation techniques can affect the structural properties and catalytic performance of the resulting catalysts. For example, the Nb-doped ceria samples prepared by different methods have different n-butane combustion rates, with the sample made from hydroxide having a 5% higher rate. The effective activation energies are also different, with the sample obtained from the coprecipitated hydroxides having a lower activation energy.
