1. The literature does not provide specific information on the factors driving the exploration of vanadium oxide-based catalysts as alternatives to Pt and CrOx for paraffin dehydrogenation, nor does it detail the evolution of research in this area since the 1980s. It does, however, mention that the nature and properties of vanadium oxide species on the surface of alumina are influenced by the method of preparation, the nature of the support, promoters, and environmental conditions. The literature also notes that the molecular structure of vanadium species and their catalytic properties are affected by variables such as the type of carrier, the surface area of the support, and the metal loading. For instance, different vanadium oxide species (V5+) are formed on the surface of alumina after calcination, depending on the vanadium loadings. At low coverages, mainly isolated and polymerized VO4 units are observed, while VO6 octahedra are predominant at higher vanadium loadings. The concentration of polyvanadate structures and the degree of polymerization increase with rising vanadium loadings. The oxygen coordination of V5+ ranges from tetrahedral at low coverages to octahedral at high coverages. At medium and high vanadium loadings, crystalline V2O5 is formed in addition to amorphous vanadium oxide. The TPR profile of the surface vanadium oxide species is influenced by the amount of vanadium and therefore by the ratio of isolated and polymerized surface vanadium oxide species.

1. 文献没有提供具体信息，说明为什么探索钒氧化物基催化剂作为Pt和CrOx的替代品用于石蜡脱氢，也没有详细说明自1980年代以来该研究领域的发展。但是，文献确实提到，铝矾土表面的钒氧化物物种的性质和特性受制备方法、支撑材料的性质、促进剂和环境条件的影响。文献还指出，钒物种的分子结构及其催化性能受载体类型、支撑材料的表面积和金属负载量等变量的影响。例如，根据煅烧后的钒负载量，在铝矾土表面会形成不同的钒氧化物物种（V5+）。在低覆盖度下，主要观察到孤立和聚合的VO4单元，而在较高钒负载量下，VO6八面体占主导地位。随着钒负载量的增加，多钒酸盐结构的浓度和聚合度增加。V5+的氧配位从低覆盖度下的四面体到高覆盖度下的八面体不等。在中高钒负载量下，除了无定形的钒氧化物外，还会形成结晶的V2O5。表面钒氧化物物种的TPR谱受钒含量的影响，因此受孤立和聚合表面钒氧化物物种比例的影响。
