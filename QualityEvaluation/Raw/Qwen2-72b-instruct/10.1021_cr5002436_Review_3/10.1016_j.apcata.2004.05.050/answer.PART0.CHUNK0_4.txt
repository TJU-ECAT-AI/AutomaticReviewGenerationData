1.The literature does not provide information on the factors driving the exploration of vanadium oxide-based catalysts as alternatives to Pt and CrOx for paraffin dehydrogenation, nor does it discuss the evolution of research in this area since the 1980s. The literature does mention that the nature and properties of vanadium oxide species formed on the alumina support are influenced by the method of preparation, the nature of the support, promoters, and environmental conditions. It also notes that different vanadium oxide species (V5+) are formed on the surface of alumina after calcination, depending on the vanadium loadings. The concentration of polyvanadate structures and the degree of polymerization increase with rising vanadium loadings. The oxygen coordination of V5+ ranges from tetrahedral at low coverages to octahedral at high coverages. At medium and high vanadium loadings, crystalline V2O5 is formed in addition to amorphous vanadium oxide. The TPR profile of the surface vanadium oxide species is influenced by the amount of vanadium and therefore by the ratio of isolated and polymerized surface vanadium oxide species.

1.文献没有提供关于探索将钒氧化物基催化剂作为Pt和CrOx替代品用于石蜡脱氢的因素的信息，也没有讨论自1980年代以来该研究领域的发展。文献确实提到，形成在氧化铝载体上的钒氧化物物种的性质和特性受制备方法、载体性质、促进剂和环境条件的影响。它还指出，根据钒负载量的不同，在煅烧后，不同的钒氧化物物种（V5+）会在氧化铝表面形成。随着钒负载量的增加，多聚钒酸盐结构的浓度和聚合度增加。V5+的氧配位从低覆盖度的四面体到高覆盖度的八面体不等。在中高钒负载量下，除了无定形的钒氧化物外，还会形成结晶的V2O5。表面钒氧化物物种的TPR谱受钒含量的影响，因此也受表面孤立和聚合的钒氧化物物种比例的影响。
