[1] "Recently, we have demonstrated that the VOx/MCM-41 catalyst with highly dispersed, near to isolated VOx species showed similar selec- tivity and, most importantly, stable catalytic performance in several DH/regeneration cycles surpassing in quality the industrially relevant CrOx/MCM-41 and PtSn/Al2O3.6 This was ascribed to the stability of VOx species against agglomeration in the course of DH and regeneration cycles."

1.Research has shown that vanadium oxide-based catalysts, particularly VOx/MCM-41 with highly dispersed VOx species, exhibit stable catalytic performance in dehydrogenation (DH) and regeneration cycles, surpassing the quality of industrially relevant CrOx/MCM-41 and PtSn/Al2O3 catalysts. This stability is attributed to the VOx species' resistance to agglomeration during DH and regeneration cycles. Since the 1980s, the exploration of vanadium oxide-based catalysts as alternatives has been driven by their potential to provide similar selectivity and stable performance. The current work aims to further investigate the potential of VOx-based catalysts for the DH reaction by selecting commercial Al2O3SiO2 materials, pure Al2O3, and SiO2 as supports to prepare catalysts free of crystalline V2O5 particles. The highest spacetime yield of propene achieved with these catalysts is only 25% lower than that of industrially relevant PtSn/Al2O3 under the same reaction conditions. The deactivation of the catalysts is related to propene-derived carbon deposits covering active VOx sites. However, such deposits formed on bare support sites can also participate in propane dehydrogenation, albeit with significantly lower activity compared to VOx species. The acidic properties of the support are crucial for the generation of catalytically active carbon species. The highest spacetime yields of propene were achieved over catalysts based on Siral supports with 10 and 1 wt.% of SiO2, respectively, approaching the values measured on industrially relevant PtSn/Al2O3 and being approximately two times higher than that delivered by the VOx/MCM-41 catalyst with a similar vanadium loading. All catalysts, except for the one containing 70 wt.% of SiO2 in the support, showed excellent ability to restore their initial activity after 10 DH/oxidative regeneration cycles. The optimal duration of the DH cycle without a significant loss of initial propene yield over Siral-based catalysts was determined to be 6 h. This is because carbon deposits are initially formed on the support sites not carrying VOx and are active in propane dehydrogenation. However, since their activity is significantly lower than that of VOx species, the catalysts start to deactivate when the latter also become covered by coke. The tendency of the catalysts to form coke increases with their surface acidity.

1.研究表明，特别是具有高度分散的VOx物种的VOx/MCM-41催化剂，在脱氢(DH)和再生循环中表现出稳定的催化性能，其质量超过了工业上相关的CrOx/MCM-41和PtSn/Al2O3催化剂。这种稳定性归因于VOx物种在DH和再生循环中对聚结的抵抗力。自1980年代以来，对钒氧化物基催化剂作为替代品的探索一直受到它们提供类似选择性和稳定性能的潜力的推动。目前的工作旨在通过选择商业Al2O3SiO2材料，纯Al2O3和SiO2作为支撑，制备不含结晶V2O5颗粒的催化剂，进一步研究VOx基催化剂在DH反应中的潜力。这些催化剂在相同反应条件下获得的最高时空丙烯产量仅比工业上相关的PtSn/Al2O3低25%。催化剂的失活与丙烯衍生的碳沉积物覆盖活性VOx位点有关。然而，这些沉积物在裸露的支撑位点上形成，也可以参与丙烷脱氢，尽管与VOx物种相比，其DH活性显著较低。支撑的酸性性质对于生成催化活性碳物种至关重要。在分别含有10和1 wt.% SiO2的Siral支撑的催化剂上，获得了最高的时空丙烯产量，接近在工业上相关的PtSn/Al2O3上测量的值，大约是具有相似钒负载的VOx/MCM-41催化剂的两倍。除了含有70 wt.% SiO2的支撑的催化剂外，所有其他催化剂在10个DH/氧化再生循环后都显示出恢复初始活性的出色能力。在Siral基催化剂上，没有显著损失初始丙烯产量的DH循环的最适持续时间确定为6 h。这是因为碳沉积物最初在不携带VOx的支撑位点上形成，并且在丙烷脱氢中是活性的。然而，由于它们的活性显著低于VOx物种，当后者也被焦炭覆盖时，催化剂开始失活。催化剂形成焦炭的倾向随着其表面酸性的增加而增加。
