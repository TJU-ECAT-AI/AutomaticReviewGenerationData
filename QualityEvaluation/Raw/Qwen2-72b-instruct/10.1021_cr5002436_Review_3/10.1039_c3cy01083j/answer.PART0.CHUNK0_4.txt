[1] "Recently, we have demonstrated that the VOx/MCM-41 catalyst with highly dispersed, near to isolated VOx species showed similar selec- tivity and, most importantly, stable catalytic performance in several DH/regeneration cycles surpassing in quality the industrially relevant CrOx/MCM-41 and PtSn/Al2O3.6 This was ascribed to the stability of VOx species against agglomeration in the course of DH and regeneration cycles."
[2] "The aim of the current work was to further explore the potential of VOx-based catalysts for the DH reaction. To this end, we selected commercial Al2O3SiO2 materials (Siral),pure Al2O3 and SiO2 as supports to prepare catalysts free Catal. Sci. Technol., 2014, 4, 13231332  1323 This journal is  The Royal Society of Chemistry 2014 of crystalline V2O5 particles."
[3] "In particular, we focused on (i) elucidating factors governing catalyst on-stream stability,(ii) analysing the role of pristine supports and carbon deposits in propene production and (iii) optimizing reactor operation to achieve industrially relevant propene production."
[4] "The distribution of VOx species on the surface of the freshly cal- cined catalysts was studied by UV/Vis spectroscopy."
[5] "The UV/Vis spectra of the catalysts at 550 C in a flow of O2 (20 vol.%) in N2 are shown in Fig. 1. The spectrum of VOx/MCM-41 is domi- nated by the charge transfer (CT) transition from O2to V5+ with a broad absorption band at ca. 300 nm characteristic of highly-dispersed dehydrated VO4 surface species.8,10 As the surface density of V increases, the red shift of the CT onset occurs for VOx/Al2O3 and VOx/Siral (Fig. 1) due to the appear- ance of polymerized VO4 entities linked via oxygen bridges.10"
[6] "The specific surface areas (SBET) of the calcined catalysts were lower than those of the corresponding pristine supports with the highest loss of 26% observed on VOx/S40 and VOx/S70."
[7] "The metal content of the calcined catalysts (Table 1) was determined by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES, Varian 715-ES)."
[8] "The surface acidity of the pristine supports was evaluated via infrared (IR) measurements of adsorbed pyridine using a Tensor 27 spectrometer (Bruker)."
[9] "The amount of carbon deposits formed during a DH cycle was determined from the amounts of CO and CO2 evolved during temperature-programmed oxidation (TPO) of the cata- lysts used in the DH reaction run at 550 C for 6 or 27 h."

1.Vanadium oxide-based catalysts have been explored as alternatives to Pt and CrOx for paraffin dehydrogenation due to their stable catalytic performance in several dehydrogenation/regeneration cycles, surpassing the quality of industrially relevant CrOx/MCM-41 and PtSn/Al2O3 catalysts. Research in this area has evolved since the 1980s, focusing on factors governing catalyst on-stream stability, analyzing the role of pristine supports and carbon deposits in propene production, and optimizing reactor operation to achieve industrially relevant propene production. Variables such as carrier type, support surface area, and metal loading influence the nature and behavior of vanadium species in these catalysts. The distribution of VOx species on the surface of freshly calcined catalysts can be studied by UV/Vis spectroscopy, showing that as the surface density of vanadium increases, the red shift of the charge transfer onset occurs due to the appearance of polymerized VO4 entities linked via oxygen bridges. The specific surface areas of calcined catalysts are lower than those of corresponding pristine supports, with the highest loss observed on VOx/S40 and VOx/S70. Metal content of calcined catalysts can be determined by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy, while the surface acidity of pristine supports can be evaluated via infrared measurements of adsorbed pyridine. Carbon deposits formed during a dehydrogenation cycle can be determined from the amounts of CO and CO2 evolved during temperature-programmed oxidation of catalysts used in the dehydrogenation reaction run at 550 C for 6 or 27 hours.

1.由于在多次脱氢/再生循环中表现出稳定的催化性能，超过了工业上相关的CrOx/MCM-41和PtSn/Al2O3催化剂的质量，因此探索了基于氧化钒的催化剂作为Pt和CrOx的替代品用于石蜡脱氢。自1980年代以来，该领域的研究一直在发展，重点是确定影响催化剂在线稳定性的因素，分析原始载体和碳沉积物在丙烯生产中的作用，以及优化反应器操作以实现工业相关的丙烯生产。载体类型、载体表面积和金属负载等变量影响这些催化剂中钒物种的性质和行为。可以通过UV/Vis光谱学研究新鲜煅烧催化剂表面上VOx物种的分布，显示随着钒的表面密度增加，电荷转移起始的红移发生，这是由于通过氧桥连接的聚合VO4实体的出现。煅烧催化剂的具体表面积低于相应的原始载体，其中VOx/S40和VOx/S70的损失最大。可以通过电感耦合等离子体光学发射光谱确定煅烧催化剂的金属含量，而原始载体的表面酸性可以通过红外测量吸附的吡啶来评估。在脱氢循环中形成的碳沉积物可以从在550 C下进行6或27小时的脱氢反应中使用的催化剂的温度程序氧化过程中产生的CO和CO2量来确定。
