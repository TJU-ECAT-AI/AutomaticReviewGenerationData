1.Since the 1980s, research has shown that vanadium oxide-based catalysts can offer similar selectivity and stable catalytic performance in dehydrogenation (DH) and regeneration cycles, surpassing the quality of industrially relevant CrOx and PtSn/Al2O3 catalysts. This is attributed to the stability of VOx species against agglomeration during DH and regeneration cycles. The current work aims to further explore the potential of VOx-based catalysts for the DH reaction by selecting commercial Al2O3SiO2 materials, pure Al2O3, and SiO2 as supports to prepare catalysts free of crystalline V2O5 particles. The focus is on elucidating factors governing catalyst on-stream stability, analyzing the role of pristine supports and carbon deposits in propene production, and optimizing reactor operation to achieve industrially relevant propene production. The highest spacetime yield of propene was only 25% lower than that over industrially relevant PtSn/Al2O3 under the same reaction conditions. Deactivation of the catalysts was related to propene-derived carbon deposits covering active VOx sites. However, depending on the catalyst, such deposits formed on bare support sites can also participate in propane dehydrogenation, although their DH activity is significantly lower compared to VOx species. Acidic properties of the support were found to be crucial for the generation of such catalytically active carbon species.

1.自1980年代以来，研究显示，基于氧化钒的催化剂可以在脱氢(DH)和再生循环中提供与工业相关的CrOx和PtSn/Al2O3催化剂相似的选择性和稳定的催化性能。这归因于VOx物种在DH和再生循环期间对聚集体的稳定性。目前的工作旨在通过选择商业Al2O3SiO2材料，纯Al2O3和SiO2作为支撑，制备不含结晶V2O5颗粒的催化剂，进一步探索VOx基催化剂在DH反应中的潜力。重点在于阐明影响催化剂在线稳定性因素，分析原始支撑和碳沉积物在丙烯生产中的作用，以及优化反应器操作以实现工业相关的丙烯生产。在相同的反应条件下，最高时空丙烯产量仅比工业相关的PtSn/Al2O3低25%。催化剂的失活与丙烯衍生的碳沉积物覆盖活性VOx位点有关。然而，根据催化剂的不同，这些沉积物在裸露的支撑位点上形成，也可以参与丙烷脱氢，尽管它们的DH活性与VOx物种相比显著较低。支撑的酸性性质对于生成此类催化活性碳物种至关重要。
