[1] "Recently, we have demonstrated that the VOx/MCM-41 catalyst with highly dispersed, near to isolated VOx species showed similar selec- tivity and, most importantly, stable catalytic performance in several DH/regeneration cycles surpassing in quality the industrially relevant CrOx/MCM-41 and PtSn/Al2O3.6 This was ascribed to the stability of VOx species against agglomeration in the course of DH and regeneration cycles."
[2] "The aim of the current work was to further explore the potential of VOx-based catalysts for the DH reaction. To this end, we selected commercial Al2O3SiO2 materials (Siral),pure Al2O3 and SiO2 as supports to prepare catalysts free Catal. Sci.

[3] "In particular, we focused on (i) elucidating factors governing catalyst on-stream stability,(ii) analysing the role of pristine supports and carbon deposits in propene production and (iii) optimizing reactor operation to achieve industrially relevant propene production."
[4] "The highest spacetime yield of propene was only 25% lower than that over industrially relevant PtSn/Al2O3 under the same reaction conditions."
[5] "All catalysts deactivated with time on stream, but restored their initial performance after oxidative regeneration as proven in a sequence of 10 DH/regeneration cycles lasting in total over 60 h."
[6] "The deactivation was related to propene-derived carbon deposits covering active VOx sites."
[7] "However, depending on the catalyst, such deposits formed on bare support sites can also participate in propane dehydrogenation."
[8] "Their DH activity is, however, significantly lower compared to VOx species."
[9] "Acidic properties of the support were found to be crucial for the generation of such catalytically active carbon species."

1.The exploration of vanadium oxide-based catalysts as alternatives to Pt and CrOx for paraffin dehydrogenation has been driven by the stability of VOx species against agglomeration in the course of DH and regeneration cycles. Research in this area has evolved since the 1980s, focusing on factors governing catalyst on-stream stability, analyzing the role of pristine supports and carbon deposits in propene production, and optimizing reactor operation to achieve industrially relevant propene production. Variables such as carrier type, support surface area, and metal loading influence the nature and behavior of vanadium species in these catalysts, with the highest spacetime yield of propene being only 25% lower than that over industrially relevant PtSn/Al2O3 under the same reaction conditions. All catalysts deactivated with time on stream, but restored their initial performance after oxidative regeneration. The deactivation was related to propene-derived carbon deposits covering active VOx sites, but such deposits formed on bare support sites can also participate in propane dehydrogenation, although their DH activity is significantly lower compared to VOx species. Acidic properties of the support were found to be crucial for the generation of such catalytically active carbon species.

1.探索将钒氧化物基催化剂作为Pt和CrOx的替代品用于石蜡脱氢，是由VOx物种在DH和再生循环过程中对聚集体的稳定性驱动的。自1980年代以来，该领域的研究已经发展，重点是确定催化剂在线稳定性的影响因素，分析原始载体和碳沉积物在丙烯生产中的作用，以及优化反应器操作以实现工业相关的丙烯生产。载体类型、载体表面积和金属负载等变量影响这些催化剂中钒物种的性质和行为，最高时空丙烯产量仅比工业相关的PtSn/Al2O3在相同反应条件下的产量低25%。所有催化剂都随时间在线失活，但在氧化再生后恢复了初始性能。失活与丙烯衍生的碳沉积物覆盖活性VOx位点有关，但根据催化剂的不同，这些沉积物在裸露的载体位点上形成，也可以参与丙烷脱氢，尽管它们的DH活性与VOx物种相比显著较低。发现载体的酸性性质对于生成此类催化活性碳物种至关重要。
