[1] "Recently, we have demonstrated that the VOx/MCM-41 catalyst with highly dispersed, near to isolated VOx species showed similar selec- tivity and, most importantly, stable catalytic performance in several DH/regeneration cycles surpassing in quality the industrially relevant CrOx/MCM-41 and PtSn/Al2O3.6 This was ascribed to the stability of VOx species against agglomeration in the course of DH and regeneration cycles."
[2] "The aim of the current work was to further explore the potential of VOx-based catalysts for the DH reaction. To this end, we selected commercial Al2O3SiO2 materials (Siral),pure Al2O3 and SiO2 as supports to prepare catalysts free Catal. Sci.

[3] "The highest spacetime yield of propene was only 25% lower than that over industrially relevant PtSn/Al2O3 under the same reaction conditions."

1.The exploration of vanadium oxide-based catalysts as alternatives to Pt and CrOx for paraffin dehydrogenation has been driven by the stability of VOx species against agglomeration during dehydrogenation and regeneration cycles. Research in this area has evolved since the 1980s, with recent studies focusing on the potential of VOx-based catalysts for the dehydrogenation reaction. Variables such as carrier type, support surface area, and metal loading influence the nature and behavior of vanadium species in these catalysts. For instance, the use of commercial Al2O3SiO2 materials, pure Al2O3, and SiO2 as supports can prepare catalysts free of crystalline V2O5 particles. The spacetime yield of propene from VOx-based catalysts can be comparable to that of industrially relevant PtSn/Al2O3 under the same reaction conditions. Deactivation of these catalysts is often related to propene-derived carbon deposits covering active VOx sites. However, such deposits formed on bare support sites can also participate in propane dehydrogenation, albeit with significantly lower activity compared to VOx species. Acidic properties of the support are crucial for the generation of catalytically active carbon species.

1.探索将钒氧化物基催化剂作为Pt和CrOx的替代品用于石蜡脱氢，是由VOx物种在脱氢和再生循环中对聚结的稳定性驱动的。自1980年代以来，该领域的研究已经发展，最近的研究集中在VOx基催化剂在脱氢反应中的潜力。载体类型、支撑表面面积和金属负载等变量影响这些催化剂中钒物种的性质和行为。例如，使用商业Al2O3SiO2材料、纯Al2O3和SiO2作为支撑体可以制备不含结晶V2O5颗粒的催化剂。VOx基催化剂的时空产率可以与在相同反应条件下工业相关的PtSn/Al2O3相当。这些催化剂的失活通常与丙烯衍生的碳沉积物覆盖活性VOx位点有关。然而，这些沉积物在裸露的支撑位点上形成，也可以参与丙烷脱氢，尽管与VOx物种相比，其活性显著降低。支撑体的酸性性质对于生成催化活性碳物种至关重要。
