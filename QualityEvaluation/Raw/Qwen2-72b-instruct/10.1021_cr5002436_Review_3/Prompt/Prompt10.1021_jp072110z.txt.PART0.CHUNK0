PidkoEmiel J. M. HensenRutger A. van Santen View Author Information View Author Information Open PDF Abstract The catalytic dehydrogenation of ethane over gallyl ions (GaO+) as a model for the active sites in oxidized Ga/ZSM-5 zeolite was studied using a density functional theory cluster modeling approach. Initial activation of ethane occurs either via heterolytic dissociation of the CH bond over the gallyl ion following an alkyl-type mechanism or via oxidation by the extralattice oxygen atom resulting in formation of an adsorbed ethanol molecule. In the latter case, ethanol rapidly reacts with the adsorption site producing a stable intermediate corresponding to the so-called carbenium initial activation. Both these paths are kinetically and thermodynamically favored as compared to the initial CH activation over reduced gallium species. However, the subsequent regeneration of the gallyl ion is very difficult. It is shown that the reduction of the gallyl ions upon the catalytic reaction is strongly preferred over the regeneration of the active sites. In addition, possible side reactions involving conversion of ethanol over GaO+ sites were discussed. Although several catalytic cycles can be expected to occur over the gallyl ions via a reaction channel involving one-step conversion of additional ethane molecules over the stable intermediates of the primary dehydrogenation path, these sites cannot be responsible for the reasonably stable catalytic activity of the oxidized Ga/ZSM-5 zeolites.

1. Introduction
High silica zeolites modified with gallium are known to be effective catalysts for promoting the dehydrogenation of light alkanes and subsequent aromatization of the thus produced alkenes. 1,2 The modifying gallium cations can be present in the zeolite in different forms. Among others, gallyl ions (GaO+) were proposed to be responsible for the high catalytic activity of Ga/ZSM-5. 3-10 Interaction of methane with the GaO+ cations in zeolite was theoretically studied by Himei et al.6 and Broclawik et al.7 The energetics of the dehydrogenation of ethane over GaO+ ions in ZSM-5 zeolite has been theoretically investigated.9 The gallyl ions were shown to be highly active for the initial CH bond cleavage.6-9 However, the subsequent regeneration of the active site was found to be strongly hampered by a high stability of the thus formed surface species. This does not tally with recent experimental results10 showing a high initial catalytic activity of the selectively oxidized Ga/ZSM-5 zeolite.
Indeed, the oxidized form of Ga/ZSM-5, where the main fraction of gallium ions is assumed to be present in the form of isolated gallyl ions, was found to be initially the most active for light alkane dehydrogenation.10 In addition to this, a high activity of the oxidized gallium-exchanged zeolites in the H/D reaction has been confirmed both experimentally 11 and theoretically. 12 However, the oxidized catalyst deactivates with time on stream. After prolonged reaction, the dehydrogenation activity of oxidized Ga/ZSM-5 becomes equal to that of a catalyst containing predominantly Ga+ ions.10 This finding was explained by rapid reduction of the gallyl ions under the reductive conditions of propane dehydrogenation. It was estimated that on average 1000 molecules of propane were converted per the oxidized gallium site before being reduced to Ga+. Clearly, currently available theoretical results do not satisfactorily agree with such experimental observations.
Recently, we have investigated in detail the mechanism of ethane dehydrogenation over different Lewis acid sites in ZSM-5 zeolite, such as extraframework zinc 13 and cadmium 14 cations, and reduced gallium sites in ZSM-5 zeolite. 15 In the present work, we continue the systematic theoretical studies of reactivity of various extraframework Lewis acidic cationic species in ZSM-5 zeolite. Here we present a detailed comparative analysis of the various reaction paths over the oxidized form of gallium, which is the gallyl GaO+ ion stabilized in ZSM-5 zeolite.
This contribution is organized as follows. The computational details are presented in section 2, and the results with their discussion are summarized in section 3. We consider catalytic dehydrogenation of ethane initiated by alkyl and carbenium mechanisms of the CH activation, interaction of ethanol molecules formed as one of the intermediates of the carbenium reaction path with the gallyl ions, and one-step concerted dehydrogenation of ethane over the surface intermediates involved in the primary catalytic paths, in this order. Section 4 summarizes the conclusions of the present work.
2. Computational Details
To obtain computational data suitable for comparison with those reported in our previous study15 concerning alkane activation over reduced gallium species in ZSM-5 zeolite, the same computational technique and cluster model were employed in the present work. The GaOHAl2Si6O9H14 cluster model shown in Figure 1 represents two adjacent five-membered rings from the wall of the straight channel of ZSM-5 zeolite. The starting geometry of the cluster corresponds to the lattice of ZSM-5 zeolite derived from X-ray diffraction (XRD) data. 16 Aluminum atoms were placed in the T12 and T8 lattice positions (Al1 and Al2, respectively, in Figure 1). 17 Note that the T12 site is located at the cross section of the straight and sinusoidal channels of ZSM-5; accordingly, the extraframework species stabilized in the vicinity of this site are considered to have the highest accessibility. Therefore, the charge-compensating gallyl ion was located in the five-membered ring containing aluminum at the T12 position (Al1 in Figure 1). Hydrogen atoms were used to saturate the dangling SiO bonds at the periphery of the cluster as well as the negative charge due to the aluminum atom at the T8 lattice site.
Figure 1 Optimized structure of the GaO+ ion stabilized in the cluster model representing ZSM-5 zeolite.
Density functional theory (DFT) with the B3LYP 18 hybrid exchange-correlation functional was used for the calculations. Geometry optimization and saddle-point searches were all performed using the Gaussian 03 program. 19 The 6-31G(d,p) basis set was used for gallium ion, whereas the ethane molecule and the zeolitic oxygen atoms were described by the 6-311G(d,p) basis set. Al and Si atoms of the zeolite framework as well as the boundary hydrogen atoms were treated by the D95-Dunning/Huzinaga basis set. It was shown earlier that such a combination is a successful compromise between the accuracy and the computational recourses required for the investigation of the reactivity of the cation-exchanged zeolites.13-15,20 Special restrictions on the positions of the boundary H atoms were imposed during the procedure of optimization, as described previously.13-15 In short, the structure of the initial zeolite cluster was first constrained to values derived from XRD patterns.16 Subsequently, only SiH and AlH bond lengths and the position of the exchanged cationic species were optimized, whereas positions of all of the other atoms as well as the directions of the bonds were fixed according to the crystallographic data. The positions of the terminal H atoms in subsequent calculations were then fixed, whereas the positions of the remaining atoms were optimized.
All energies obtained from the DFT calculations used for the estimation of the reaction heats and activation barriers were corrected for the zero-point energy obtained from frequency calculations performed on all the optimized structures. The frequency calculations also provided us with the thermochemical analysis using the ideal gas approximation at a pressure of 1 atm and temperatures of 298 and 823 K. The latter corresponds to the experimental conditions for ethane dehydrogenation over Ga/ZSM-5 zeolite.10 The values of ΔG were calculated at these conditions. Although the use of basis sets of different quality for different atoms of the model can cause relatively high basis set superposition error (BSSE), the contribution of the BSSE to the reaction energies and activation energies is expected to be small and similar for all the structures discussed and, hence, not to affect the conclusions drawn. Thus, the energetics reported was not corrected for BSSE.
The nature of the resulting stationary points was evaluated from the analytically calculated harmonic normal modes. During the normal-mode analysis, constraints on the boundary H atoms result in imaginary frequencies (negative force constants). These imaginary frequencies were suppressed by removing the contributions from the constrained atoms to the Hessian matrix for all the reaction intermediates. All the transition states showed a single imaginary frequency corresponding to the eigenvector along the reaction path.
3. Results and Discussion
3.1. Alkyl Path of Ethane Activation. The gallium and oxygen atoms of the gallyl ion GaO+ represent a Lewis acidbase pair that is able to polarize and cleave the CH bond of ethane following the alkyl (Cδ-Hδ+) mechanism. This leads to dissociative adsorption of ethane resulting in the formation of an alkyl fragment (C2H5δ-) and a hydroxyl group grafted to the gallium cation (IIa in Figure 2). This reaction (I + C2H6  TS1a  IIa) is strongly favored both thermodynamically (Table 1) and kinetically. The corresponding activation energy (ΔE) is equal to 96 kJ mol-1, and the reaction enthalpy (ΔE) equals 234 kJ mol-1.

Thus, heterolytic cleavage of the CH bond may also occur over the Lewis acidbase pair formed by the gallium ion and this framework oxygen anion. This competing path (I + C2H6  TS1a*) is reminiscent of the mechanism proposed for reduced gallium species in ZSM-5 (i.e., Ga+ and GaH2+ cations).15 The computed activation energy for this reaction path (I + C2H6  TS1a*, Figure 2) is significantly higher (by 58 kJ mol-1) than that of the reaction I + C2H6  TS1a. The difference lies in the higher basicity of the extraframework oxygen atom (O). Moreover, this mechanism results in the formation of a highly unstable neutral C2H5GaO species in the vicinity of an acidic proton. This species easily rearranges to intermediate IIa.
Activation of ethane over the gallyl ion is more facile than over reduced Ga+ and GaH2+ species. Recently, we computed ΔE values of 210 and 193 kJ mol-1 for the initial step of CH cleavage for the latter two species, respectively.15 Additionally, the heterolytic dissociation of ethane over the reduced sites is a slightly endothermic process (ΔE = 9 and 34 kJ mol-1, respectively), whereas it is strongly exothermic over the gallyl ion (ΔE = 234 kJ mol-1). The exothermic nature of reaction I  IIa is due to the formation of a strong covalent hydroxyl bond in the latter reaction mechanism. The high exothermicity and rather low activation energy for the alkyl ethane activation over gallyl ions in zeolite clearly show that these species should easily react with ethane.
The resulting intermediate IIa, [HOGaC2H5]+, decomposes via desorption of ethylene (IIa  TSaβ-H  III + C2H6) resulting in formation of the hydroxyhydridegallium ion III. This process is in fact a β-H transfer reaction, where the hydrogen atom at the β-position of the grafted C2H5- species is abstracted by the gallium cation. This reaction is endothermic (ΔE = 104 kJ mol-1) and faces a rather high activation barrier (ΔE = 203 kJ mol-1). However, it is accompanied with a significant entropy increase. As a result, the corresponding value of Gibbs free-energy change at the reaction temperature is rather low (Table 1). A similar elementary reaction was identified in the reaction mechanism of ethane over gallium dihydride species.15 A reaction enthalpy of 95 kJ mol-1 and an activation energy of 257 kJ mol-1 were computed for reduced gallium species. The lower activation energy for the β-H transfer in the present case is likely due to the enhanced Lewis acidity of the gallium ion bound to a hydroxide anion as compared to the case where gallium coordinates a hydride anion. The overall result is stronger polarization of the β-CH bond and facilitation of the subsequent hydride abstraction.
The catalytic cycle is closed via recombination of molecular hydrogen from [HOGaH]+ ions III (III  TSΗ2  I + H2). This reaction can be considered as a Brnsted acidbase reaction, where the proton from the HO(Ga) group attacks the hydride ion resulting in hydrogen desorption and regeneration of the GaO+ site. This reaction is calculated to be highly endothermic (ΔE = 259 kJ mol-1). Moreover, a very high activation energy of 328 kJ mol-1 has to be overcome. Indeed, because of the very high basicity of the extraframework oxygen atom, the dissociation of the H1O bond in III is very unfavorable (Table 1).
An alternative route is dissociation of the GaOH bond. Subsequent recombination of the hydroxyl group and the hydride ion (III  TSH2O  IV) leads to reduction of [HOGaH]+ to Ga+ via elimination of H2O. In agreement with the assumption made in ref 10, we found that this reduction path is preferred over the regeneration of the gallyl ion (I). The calculated enthalpy and the activation energy for the reduction are significantly lower (by 219 and 95 kJ mol-1, respectively) than the corresponding values for hydrogen recombination.
We have also considered a one-step reaction path leading to the regeneration of GaO+ ion from intermediate IIa (IIa  TSa1-step  I + C2H4 + H2, Figure 2) similar to the path proposed for Ga+.15 In this case, the hydrogen atom (H2) from the β-methyl group coordinates to the proton (H1) from the hydroxide group. However, this reaction proceeds via a very high activation energy barrier (ΔE = 390 kJ mol-1) because of the extremely low acidity of the H1 proton. In addition, this process is strongly thermodynamically unfavored even at high temperature (Table 1).
In summary, the initial alkyl CH bond cleavage over gallyl ions in ZSM-5 zeolite is a facile process, resulting in the formation of a stable [HOGaC2H5]+ intermediate IIa. This intermediate can in principle decompose to form the gallium hydroxide hydride ion III and ethylene. However, subsequent regeneration of structure I is prohibited. This implies that after the initial step of dissociative ethane adsorption the thermodynamic equilibrium will be almost completely shifted to structures IIa and III, whereas formation of structure I will not take place. Instead, reduction of the active site via desorption of water will lead to the formation of Ga+ sites. These findings tally with previous theoretical works,8,9 although the exact energy values significantly vary because of the larger size of the cluster employed in the present work. Table 2 summarizes selected interatomic distances for the intermediates and transition-state structures involved in the alkyl path of ethane dehydrogenation.

3.2. Carbenium Activation of Ethane. Alternative to the alkyl-type mechanism is the polarization of ethane over the Gaδ+Oδ- Lewis acidbase pair of the gallyl ion so as to lead to formation of a carbenium ion transition state (Cδ+Hδ-) with an increase of the positive charge on the C1 carbon atom simultaneous with an increase of the negative charge on the H1 hydrogen atom. Such a polarization is followed by heterolytic dissociation of ethane with subsequent formation of the intermediate IIc-2 (Figure 3) involving a hydride atom and an alkoxyl group bound to the extraframework gallium ion. Although this mechanism has been proposed before for ethane activation over GaO+ species, the respective transition-state structure has not been detected.9 Similarly, we also failed to identify the transition state corresponding to the direct heterolytic CH bond cleavage following the carbenium polarization mechanism.
Instead, we found an indirect route leading to IIc-2. In this case, the extraframework O atom initially plays the role of the oxidizing agent (Figure 3). At the initial step (I + C2H6  TSc1-1  IIc-1), the H1 atom of the ethane molecule coordinates to the basic O atom in the TSc1-1. This results in a significant elongation of the GaO and C1H1 bonds (Table 3). Then the remaining ethyl group binds to the oxygen (O) atom resulting in formation of IIc-1, which is a C2H5OH molecule coordinated to the extraframework Ga+ ion and hydrogen bound (H1···O4) to one of the basic lattice oxygens of the zeolite. Although this reaction is slightly less favorable that the alkyl CH activation, it is strongly exothermic (E = 141 kJ mol-1) and faces a rather low activation energy of 109 kJ mol-1.

In the next step, the adsorbed ethanol dissociates over the Ga+ site and intermediate IIc-2 is formed (IIc-1  TSc1-2  IIc-2). This process is slightly exothermic (ΔE = 21 kJ mol-1). Although the activation energy for ethanol dissociation is rather high (ΔE = 203 kJ mol-1), the overall activation barrier for the two-step carbenium activation (I + C2H6  IIc-2, Figure 3) is moderate (109 kJ mol-1). One notes that it is also favored thermodynamically (ΔG823 = 38 kJ mol-1, Table 4).

In this case, the OC1 bond breaks and one β-hydrogen atom (H2) of the ethyl group coordinates to the H1 atom of the GaH group. This results in a one-step desorption of molecular hydrogen and ethylene with simultaneous regeneration of the initial GaO+ active site. Similarly to the one-step decomposition of IIa, this reaction is improbable (Table 4). The calculated activation energy is equal to 354 kJ mol-1.
On the other hand, ethylene can desorb from IIc-2 via abstraction of a β-hydrogen atom (H2) by the extraframework O atom (IIc-2  TSβ-H  III + C2H6, solid lines in Figure 3). This step is much more favored both thermodynamically and kinetically than the above considered one-step process. Most likely this is due to formation of a strong OH2 bond. This energy gain significantly compensates the energy loss due to decomposition of the alkoxyl species. One can see that the overall activation energy for the dehydrogenation of ethane via carbenium mechanism until formation of III is less than 109 kJ mol-1. Therefore, one expects the generation of these species via this route under reaction conditions (Table 4). However, as was shown in section 3.1, the subsequent regeneration of the active site via the hydrogen recombination is prohibited.

The calculated activation barrier for the initial oxidation step of the carbenium activation is only slightly higher than that for the heterolytic CH bond cleavage over the gallyl ion. On the other hand, the former reaction is less exothermic. Taking into account that catalytic ethane dehydrogenation takes place at rather high temperatures, one can expect that the oxidative carbenium route is the most likely path. However, because of a small difference in energetics of the processes, the alkyl activation cannot be excluded as well.
3.3. Dehydration of Ethanol over GaO+ Sites. At the initial step of the carbenium mechanism of ethane activation, ethanol and the reduced Ga+ site are formed. Their further interaction faces a rather high activation barrier, and thus, desorption of ethylene can take place as a competitive route. Therefore, we also considered the interaction of the thus-formed ethanol with another GaO+ site of the zeolite. The energetics for this process is presented in Figure 4 and Table 5, and the geometry parameters of the intermediates and transition-state structures are listed in Table 6.

H1O4         1.942 1.821 1.970 2.164 1.743 Molecular adsorption of ethanol to the gallyl ion (I-1) is rather strong (ΔE = 83 kJ mol-1). During this process, a hydrogen bond is formed between the H1 atom of C2H5OH and the extraframework oxygen (O) of the gallyl ion. In addition, the negatively charged O atoms coordinate to the positively charged gallium (Table 6). Both these interactions result in significant weakening of the OH1 bond and facilitate its subsequent heterolytic cleavage. The OH1 bond of the ethanol heterolytically dissociates (I-1  TSe1  IIe, Figure 4) on the oxo-gallyl species, resulting in very stable [HOGaOC2H5]+ species IIe without notable barrier. Ethanol dissociation is strongly thermodynamically favored (Table 5). Further possible chemical transformations are very similar to those discussed above for the dehydrogenation of ethane.
Intermediate IIe can decompose in one step via reaction IIe  TSe1-step  IVe + C2H6, resulting in elimination of molecular ethylene and formation of water adsorbed on the gallyl ion GaO+. This reaction proceeds via coordination of a β-hydrogen atom (H2) from the ethoxyl group to the oxygen atom of the OH1 group (TSe1-step). This results in elongation of the OC1, C2H2, and GaO bonds with simultaneous shortening of the GaO and formation of a new OH2 bond (Table 6). The one-step reaction is strongly disfavored thermodynamically (ΔE = 248 kJ mol-1, ΔG823 = 131 kJ mol-1) and faces a high activation barrier (ΔE = 262 kJ mol-1).
Similarly to the above considered ethane activation, consecutive formation of ethylene and water is more favorable. The energetics of the β-hydrogen (H2) abstraction by the O atom resulting in formation of a [HOGaOH]+ intermediate IIIe (IIe  TSeβ-H  IIIe + C2H4, Figure 4) is very similar to that calculated for the IIc-2  TScβ-H  III + C2H4 reaction (Figure 3). This shows that the chemical transformations of the alkoxyl group bound to the extraframework gallium in ZSM-5 zeolite depend only slightly on other ligands attached to the Ga atom, unless they are directly involved in these transformations (e.g., one-step decomposition reactions).
The resulting dihydroxylgallium ion IIIe decomposes via water elimination (IIIe  TSeH2O  IVe). This reaction is also rather unfavorable (ΔE = 217 kJ mol-1; ΔE = 217 kJ mol-1). One can see that the reverse reaction is barrierless. The catalytic cycle for the dehydration of C2H5OH over gallyl ions is closed via water desorption (IVe  I + H2O). We expect the catalytic cycle for dehydration of ethanol over GaO+ sites will stop at the step of formation of either intermediate IIe or IIIe.
It was shown by Rane et al.10 that ethane dehydrogenation over the oxidized Ga/ZSM-5 zeolite faces a lower olefin selectivity as compared to the reduced catalyst. Moreover, coke formation in this case was also more pronounced. Indeed, formation of very reactive ethanol molecules upon ethane transformation over GaO+ sites as well as the existence of numerous reaction pathways are in accord with these findings. On the other hand, despite the lower reactivity, the Ga+ sites in ZSM-5 do not produce highly reactive intermediates and do not provide competitive reaction paths resulting in high and stable selectivity to the products of ethane dehydrogenation.15
3.4. Concerted Ethane Dehydrogenation over the Intermediates of the Primary Route. The primary ethane dehydrogenation paths over the GaO+ site in ZSM-5 zeolite result in the formation of very stable intermediates, and subsequent closure of the catalytic cycle is strongly activated as compared to the reduction of the gallyl ion to univalent gallium ions. However, it was experimentally shown10 that although the activity of the selectively oxidized Ga/ZSM-5 zeolite decreases with time on stream to the same value as for the sample containing only Ga+ sites, several catalytic cycles occur over the oxidized gallium species before their dehydration. Obviously, the reaction paths discussed above cannot explain formation of more than one ethylene molecule per oxidized active site.
Recently, Pereira and Nascimento 21,22 proposed a new concerted mechanism to describe the catalytic activity of dihydridegallium ions GaH2+ in ZSM-5. It was shown that the activation barrier in this case is only slightly higher than that of the conventional three-step mechanism proposed by Frash and van Santen.9 On the other hand, the concerted mechanism has an important advantage since it does not require conformational rearrangements of the reacting species. The primary routes of ethane dehydrogenation over GaO+ ions result in formation of intermediates IIc-2 and III, which contain a hydride ion bound to gallium. Thus, secondary reactions over these intermediates involving additional C2H6 molecules may explain the experimentally observed dehydrogenation activity.
The calculated reaction paths for the concerted ethane dehydrogenation pathway over intermediates IIc-2 and III as well as their energetics in comparison with the competing primary dehydrogenation or reduction routes are shown in Figure 5. Table 7 summarizes the geometry parameters of the intermediates and transition-state structures involved in these processes, whereas Table 8 shows changes in energy and Gibbs free energy upon the ethane dehydrogenation. Following this concerted reaction, one of the hydrogen atoms (H1) of the second ethane molecule coordinates to the gallium ion, while the hydrogen atom (H2) from the β-methyl group binds to the hydride ion grafted to Ga. This results in one-step formation of ethylene and dihydrogen as well as in regeneration of the active intermediate (IIc-2 or III). The geometry parameters for the corresponding transition-state structures TS1C and TS2C are very similar (Table 7). The activation energy for the direct dehydrogenation reaction only slightly depends on the noninteracting (OH or OC2H5) group bound to gallium. The calculated activation energies for the concerted ethane dehydrogenation over intermediates IIc-2 and III are equal to 258 and 262 kJ mol-1, respectively. These values are somewhat lower than those reported before21,22 for the respective process over the GaH2+ site. Most likely, this is due to a higher Lewis acidity of the gallium ion bound to oxygen atoms in IIc-2 and III compared to that of the GaH2+ ion.

The activation energies for the concerted C2H6 dehydrogenation paths are very close to those for the corresponding competitive elementary steps of the primary dehydrogenation route (III  TSH2O  IV and IIc-2  TScβ-H  III + C2H6, Figures 2 and 3). Therefore, these paths will compete, and several catalytic cycles can in principle occur following the concerted mechanism before the active intermediate transforms according to the primary reaction path. Moreover, taking into account that the concerted dehydrogenation paths lead to one-step formation of two gaseous molecules, these reactions imply a considerable increase in entropy. The overall activation energy for ethane dehydrogenation over GaO+ sites in this case will not exceed 150 kJ mol-1. This value is about 25% lower than the one calculated for ethane dehydrogenation over the reduced Ga+ sites in ZSM-5 zeolite.15 This could explain the very high initial activity of the oxidized Ga/ZSM-5 catalyst. However, with time on stream the active site will be reduced to form a more stable univalent gallium ion, since this reaction path is strongly preferred over the regeneration of the gallyl ions. We estimate formation of not more than three ethylene molecules per isolated GaO+ species before being reduced to Ga+. This, however, contradicts the recently reported observation of about 1000 catalytic cycles per oxidized gallium site in Ga/ZSM-5.10 On the other hand, a low stability and, therefore, very high reactivity of the isolated gallyl ions may cause processes such as oligomerization of the isolated GaO+ species in the selectively oxidized Ga/ZSM-5 zeolite. 23 In this case, a wide variety of different gallium oxide clusters can be generated. One expects this process being strongly dependent on the aluminum distribution in the zeolite. The latter factor together with the geometry of cation site will determine the stability and the reactivity of such species.
4. Conclusions
In the present study, we considered different reaction paths for ethane dehydrogenation over the gallium species in oxidized Ga/ZSM-5 (i.e., GaO+ ions stabilized at cationic sites of the zeolite). Two different reaction paths were found for the initial CH activation. The first one is the heterolytic dissociation of ethane on the gallyl ion following the alkyl (Cδ-Hδ+) polarization mechanism. This reaction path exhibits a rather low activation barrier and results in formation of a very stable intermediate [C2H5GaOH]+ that can be decomposed via ethylene desorption to form a [HGaOH]+ species. Further regeneration of the active site via H2 desorption is strongly disfavored both thermodynamically and kinetically.
Another possible reaction path for ethane dehydrogenation is initiated by partial oxidation of an ethane molecule by the extralattice oxygen atom. The resulting ethanol molecule then interacts with the adsorption site (Ga+), leading to formation of a product of carbenium mechanism [HGaOC2H5]+. The direct dissociative adsorption of ethane on GaO+ ions following such a polarization mechanism (Cδ+Hδ-) was not found. Similar to the case of the alkyl mechanism, subsequent ethylene desorption leads to highly stable intermediate [HGaOH]+.
Although catalytic cycles of these primary dehydrogenation routes cannot be closed because of formation of very stable intermediates, several catalytic cycles may occur via a concerted dehydrogenation mechanism. Involvement of these secondary reactions over the intermediates formed via the primary route leads to estimation of the overall activation energy for the catalytic ethane dehydrogenation over GaO+ ions below 150 kJ mol-1. This value is significantly lower than the overall activation energy calculated for the reduced gallium containing active sites. This coheres well with the experimentally observed high initial activity of the oxidized Ga/ZSM-5 zeolite. However, despite this facile pathway gallyl ions reduce very rapidly via water desorption to produce univalent gallium ions. This latter reaction faces an activation energy lower by 95 kJ mol-1 as compared to the regeneration of the oxidized active site and is significantly more favorable thermodynamically. From the results presented, one cannot expect formation of more than three ethylene molecules per GaO+ site before being reduced to Ga+. Therefore, gallyl ions cannot be considered as catalytically active sites for dehydrogenation of light alkanes.
