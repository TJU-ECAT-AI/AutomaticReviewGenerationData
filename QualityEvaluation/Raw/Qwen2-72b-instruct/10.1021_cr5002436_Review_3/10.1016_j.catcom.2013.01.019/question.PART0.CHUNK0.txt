1. Introduction
The synthesis of ordered mesoporous inorganic materials has attracted a lot of scientific interest due to their uniform mesopore sizes, high specific surface areas and ease of surface functionalization,which are features important in catalytic applications. A cooperative as- sembly of inorganic precursors with organic surfactants (soft tem- plates) by solgel method is the most widely applied approach to mesoporous solid preparation. This soft templating synthesis method is useful especially in the case of obtaining various families of siliceous materials (e.g. MCM, SBA). However, it is not suitable for the prepara- tion of non-siliceous materials because the hydrolysis and polymeriza- tion of transition-metal alkoxides are harder to control compared to silica alkoxides [1]. As a result, final solids have poor mesopore structure and low thermal stability after removal of templating agent.
The development of the nanocasting technique opened a new way for the synthesis of ordered mesoporous inorganic materials. In this method, a well ordered mesopore structure of the matrix, typically sili- ceous (e.g. SBA-15, KIT-6) or carbonaceous (e.g. CMK-3, OMC) material is filled with a precursor, which is then converted into suitable inorgan- ic materials by thermal treatment and removal of hard template. Up to now, many different inorganic materials have been successfully pre- pared by nanocasting. Preparation procedures, physicochemical prop- erties and possible applications of nanoreplicas have been discussed more precisely in several reviews [13].
In the last decade, several attempts at preparing ordered mesoporous Ga2O3 using soft templating approaches have been undertaken [46].
The results indicate a difficulty with the preparation of thermally sta- ble mesophase of pure Ga2O3. Although using soft templates yields surfactant-Ga2O3 mesophase, it finally collapses during thermal treatment leading to a formation of low surface area and poorly or- dered mesoporous Ga2O3. Similar unfavorable thermal transformation has also been observed in the case of disordered mesoporous γ-Ga2O3,which was converted into β-Ga2O3 during heating at 1073 K. This resulted in a loss of specific surface area from 120 to 40 m2·g1 and in a formation of wider pores [7]. Recently, ordered mesoporous Ga2O3 with a high specific surface area (307 m2·g1) has been prepared using nanoreplication [8]. The new method of Ga2O3 synthesis is very promising from the catalytic point of view because the hard template provides stable support, removed after high temperature crystallization.
In the case of Ga2O3, the presence of hard template suppresses collapse of mesopore structure that typically occurs during gallium oxide recrystallization.
Gallium-containing materials have been widely employed as cata- lysts in a variety of processes including transformation of alkanes into aromatic hydrocarbons (CYCLAR process) [9], selective catalytic re- duction (SCR) of NOx in the presence of hydrocarbons as reducing agents [10,11], as well as FriedelCrafts benzylation and acylation re- actions [12]. Furthermore, bulk Ga2O3 (different polymorphs), Ga2O3 supported on TiO2 and Ga2O3Al2O3 spinel-type mixed oxides exhibit a promising catalytic performance in the dehydrogenation of hydro- carbons in the presence of CO2 [1319]. This process is considered as an alternative to the commercial dehydrogenation pathway of Catalysis Communications 35 (2013) 95100 Corresponding author. Tel.: +48 12 628 27 29; fax: +48 12 628 20 37.

CO, which is formed from CO2 as a valuable by- product, can be additionally applied in chemical synthesis. It was found that in the dehydrogenation of alkanes (1) carried out over Ga-containing materials, CO2 enhances the olefin yield and sup- presses coke deposition by participation in the reverse watergas shift (2) and Boudouard (3) reactions, respectively [1316].
Taking into account the advantages of the nanocasting route and the promising catalytic performance of Ga-containing materials, we decided to prepare thermally stable ordered mesoporous Ga2O3 and Ga2O3Al2O3 materials using CMK-3 as a hard template. The catalytic performance of the synthesized materials was investigated in the de- hydrogenation of propane in the presence of CO2 (DHP-CO2).
2. Experimental
2.1. Preparation of materials
In a polypropylene bottle (250 cm3), 8 g of Pluronic P123 was dissolved in a solution containing 60 g of distilled water and 120 g of 2 M HCl at 308 K. The mixture was vigorously stirred until com- plete dissolution of polymeric surfactant. Subsequently, 17 g of TEOS (98%, Aldrich) was added dropwise. Finally, the mixture was stirred (400 rpm) for another 20 h at 308 K and then hydrothermal- ly treated under static conditions for 24 h at 363 K. The obtained white precipitate was filtered, dried at 333 K overnight and calcined in air by raising temperature from ambient to 823 K over 9 h period and an isothermal step at 823 K for another 12 h.
The prepared SBA-15 material was used as a hard template to the synthesis of carbon replica, CMK-3 [20]. In typical procedure, 1 g of SBA-15 was impregnated with a solution containing 5 g of water,
1.25 g of sucrose and 0.14 g of sulfuric acid. The sample was dried
in two steps: at 373 K for 6 h and then at 433 K for another 6 h.
The impregnation and drying procedures were repeated. In the second impregnation, a solution with 0.8 g of sucrose and 0.09 g of sulfuric acid dissolved in 3 g of water was used. Carbonization was completed in flowing N2 by raising temperature (1 K·min1) up to 1073 K, at which the material was kept for another 12 h. After cooling to room temperature the carbonsilica composite was washed twice in 10% hydrofluoric solution to remove the silica template.
Mesoporous Ga2O3 (Ga2O3m) and Ga2O3Al2O3 (Ga2O3Al2O3(1/4)) and Ga2O3Al2O3(4/1) with atomic ratios of Ga/Al=1/4 and 4/1, respec- tively, were obtained by the incipient wetness impregnation method according to the modified procedure reported by Roggenbuck et al. [21].
Unmodified CMK-3 carbon sieves were impregnated using an aqueous solution of metal nitrates containing 1 M of metal ions (Ga or Ga+Al).
After impregnation, the materials were heated under air atmosphere to 523 K with a constant rate of 1 K·min1 in order to decompose metal ni- trates. This procedure was repeated once. In the first and second impreg- nations volumes of 4.0 cm3 and 3.2 cm3 of solution per 1 g of CMK-3 were used, respectively. Finally, the materials were calcined in two steps. First, the materials were calcined in an inert gas (N2) atmosphere by rising temperature from ambient to 1073 K with a rate of 1 K·min 1 followed by an isothermal step at 1073 K for another 10 h. Subsequent- ly, after cooling to room temperature the materials were heated again in a dry air flow using the same program but with the final temperature of
873 K.
The reference sample denoted as Ga2O3-t was prepared by the ther- mal decomposition of commercial Ga(NO3)3 (Fluka AG) at 873 K for 10 h.
2.2. Physicochemical and catalytic characterization
XRD patterns were collected on a Panalytical X'Pert Pro instru- ment operated at 40 kV and 30 mA, equipped with a Cu Kα X-ray (λ=0.154 nm) radiation with a step size of 0.0167.ICP spectrometry (Perkin Elmer ELAN 6100) was applied for quan- titative determination of aluminum and gallium content in the samples.Morphology and structure of the solids were investigated by means of JEOL JSM  7500F Field Emission Scanning Electron Micro- scope with the EDS (energy dispersive spectra) detection system of characteristic X-ray radiation equipped with the transmission elec- tron microscopy detector TED. In the SEM experiments the samples were deposited on the sample holder. K575X Turbo Sputter Coater was used for coating the specimens with chromium (deposited film thickness  20 nm). The specimens for TEM investigation were pre- pared by depositing a small amount of the powder samples on holey carbon films supported on copper grids.Nitrogen adsorptiondesorption isotherms were measured at 77 K using a Micromeritics ASAP 2020 instrument. Specific surface areas were calculated using the BrunauerEmmettTeller method within the relative pressure of P/P0=0.050.15. Pore size distribu- tions were calculated from the desorption branch using the Barrett JoynerHalenda method and the corrected form of the Kelvin equa- tion proposed by Kruk et al. [22]. Total pore volumes were obtained from the volumes of nitrogen adsorbed at about P/P0=0.97.The samples after catalytic runs were analyzed by thermogravimetric method (TG) in flowing air (100 cm3·min1) using a SDT Q600 appara- tus (TA Instruments). Ca. 5 mg of a sample was placed in a corundum crucible and heated in the temperature range of 3031273 K at a heating rate of 20 K·min1.Temperature programmed desorption of ammonia (NH3-TPD) exper- iments were performed in a system consisted of a quartz microreactor, a well-controlled tubular furnace and a gas chromatograph with the ther- mal conductivity detector (TCD). A 100 mg sample was preheated in He at 873 K for 2 h and then equilibrated with NH3 at room temperature.Physisorbed NH3 was removed by purging with He at 373 K for 2 h. The TPD measurement was conducted by heating the sample from 373 to 873 K at 10 K·min1 in helium (30 cm3·min1).The catalytic properties of mesoporous oxides were investigated in the dehydrogenation of propane in the presence of CO2 (DHP-CO2).This process was carried out in a flow-type quartz reactor packed with 200 mg of the catalyst (grain size 0.20.3 mm) in the temperature range of 773873 K and under atmospheric pressure. The gaseous reac- tion mixture consisted of C3H8:CO2:He=1:5:9 (molar ratio), and the total flow rate was 30 cm3·min1. The products and unreacted sub- strates were analyzed using an Agilent 6890N gas chromatograph (equipped with Hayesep Q and 13× molecular sieves packed columns and thermal conductivity detector), connected on-line to the reactor outlet. The conversion of propane, yield of propene and selectivity to products were calculated as described elsewhere [20].In the selected case the prepared sample stability was investigated in the consecutive dehydrogenation, regeneration and purification cycles. DHP-CO2 tests were carried out for 240 min at 823 K, other re- action conditions were the same as described above. After each dehy- drogenation cycle the catalyst was regenerated shortly for 15 min with air at 823 K (Vair=30 cm3·min1) and then purified with helium at 823 K for 5 min (VHe=30 cm3·min1).
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Characterization of materials
Fig. 1 displays the XRD patterns of pure SBA-15, CMK-3 as well as Ga2O3m and Ga2O3Al2O3 mixed oxides with Ga:Al atomic ratios of
4:1 and 1:4 obtained by nanoreplication. In the 2θ range of 0.56.0
SBA-15 shows three diffraction lines indexed to the (100), (110) and (200) reflection characteristic for a 2D hexagonal phase (space group p6mm) [23]. The negative replica of SBA-15 (CMK-3) exhibits one intensive (100) reflection and two very weak and broad reflec- tions, all of them are slightly shifted towards higher 2 theta values 96

compared to SBA-15. Pure Ga2O3m and the Ga2O3Al2O3 samples show one intensive (100) reflection and in some cases two signifi- cantly weaker (110) and (200) ones (visible after magnification) indicating that hexagonal pore rearrangement of the initial hard tem- plate (SBA-15) is remained after repeated templating.
SEM and TEM images of SBA-15, CMK-3 and Ga2O3m samples are presented in Fig. 2. Pure SBA-15 consists of wheat-like aggregates with rope-like domains characterized by a uniform size of about 1 μm.
Its negative replica, CMK-3, and pure Ga2O3m have very similar shapes and a slightly lower size of particles that suggests that after replications the morphology of the initial rigid template (SBA-15) is preserved. TEM imaging (Fig. 2GI) confirms that SBA-15 and CMK-3 materials have a uniform pore structure. It should be noticed that Ga2O3m possesses a mesoporous structure, however, with less regular long-range structural order.
The N2-physisorption isotherms of SBA-15 and their negative carbon replica, CMK-3 are shown in Fig. 3A. According to the IUPAC classification the isotherms are a type IV with a steep increase around P/P0=0.4 in the case of CMK-3 and above 0.5 for the Ga-containing mesoporous materials.
The pore size distributions calculated with the BJH method evi- dence that all obtained materials have a uniform pore size in the mesoporous range. Pure SBA-15 has very narrow pore size distribu- tion with the pronounced peak at 8.2 nm, while its negative replica CMK-3 shows a less uniform pore-size centered at 4.3 nm. The pore sizes in mesoporous Ga2O3m and Ga2O3Al2O3 obtained by repeated templating are in the range between those for SBA-15 and its nega- tive replica, CMK-3. The maxima in the pore size distributions can be found in the range between 6.2 to 6.5 nm for these materials that is in good agreement with the results reported recently for pure mesoporous Ga2O3 (6.3 nm) obtained with a similar method using GaCl3 solution in toluene [8]. Moreover, the fact that the pore Fig. 1. XRD pattern of SBA-15 (A) CMK-3 (B), GaAlO(1/4) (C), GaAlO(4/1) (D) and Ga2O3m (E).

sizes in mesoporous Ga2O3 and Ga2O3Al2O3 are lower than in SBA-15 can be explained by the structural shrinkage process. It is most likely that the carbon framework formed during carbonization of sucrose contracted and the empty distance between the pores' wall and carbon rods appeared (supplement, Fig. 1S). In result, both the wall thickness of CMK-3 (h=5.2 nm) and pore sizes of the mesoporous materials after repeated templating are lower compared to the pore size of SBA-15 applied as the initial hard template.The textural properties of the studied materials as well as chemi- cal and phase composition are summarized in Table 1.All samples obtained by nanocasting have lower SBET than that of SBA-15. Similarly, total pore volumes and average pore diameters of the replicas are lower compared to SBA-15 that is in consistence with the results reported in literature for various mesoporous metal oxides (e.g. MgO, In2O3, ZrO2, Ga2O3 and Al2O3) obtained using CMK-3 as the hard template [8,21,24,25]. Moreover, in the group of the investigated materials SBET and Vtotal decrease gradually with the increase of Ga content. The mentioned above changes in the textural properties correlate with the density of bulk oxides. In the case of the investigated materials the density increases in the order: Si>Al>Ga, therefore the SBET and Vtotal of SBA-15 are higher than that of all nanoreplicas and for the Ga-containing samples the textural parameters decrease with the increase in the Ga content.

823 K. Fig. 4 displays the variation of propane conversion and propene selectivity with time-on-stream over all prepared mesoporous oxides and the reference Ga2O3-t sample.
The highest initial conversion of propane was achieved for the Ga2O3-t sample. However, this material rapidly lost its activity and after 250 min on stream it was almost inactive. These results are in good agreement with the previous reports which show fast deactiva- tion of disordered Ga2O3 due to coke deposition [14,15,17]. Over Ga2O3m and Ga2O3Al2O3(Ga/Al=4/1) materials the initial conver- sion of propane was slightly lower in comparison with Ga2O3-t, but during the DHP-CO2 process the mesoporous materials deactivated more slowly than Ga2O3-t. In result, mesoporous oxides exhibited higher conversion of propane compared to Ga2O3-t after 30 min-on-stream. The lowest propane conversion was observed over the Ga2O3Al2O3(Ga/Al= 1/4) sample with the lowest Ga atomic ratio. However, over Ga2O3 Al2O3(Ga/Al=1/4) the conversion of propane was unchanged during 4 h of the process. Similar correlation between catalytic performance in DHP-CO2 and the Ga/Al composition has been reported by Chen et al.
[17] for spinel-type Ga2O3Al2O3 mixed oxides.
It has been proposed that the high catalytic performance of pure Ga2O3 and mixed Ga2O3Al2O3 materials is attributed to the surface gallium sites with a relatively weak acidity [17,18]. Our NH3-TPD measurements confirm that weak-medium acid sites dominate on the surface of the investigated materials. The TPD profiles of all mate- rials show one broad desorption peak with the maximum at about 467 K (supplement Fig. 2S). Table 2 summarizes the quantitative cal- culation of desorbed ammonia normalized to SBET (acid site density).
The coke amounts estimated based on TG analysis and initial yield of propene obtained at 823 K are reported as well.
The acid site density of the investigated materials varies parallelly with the initial yield of propene confirming that weak acid sites play important role in the dehydrogenation of light alkanes. Moreover,with raising the density of acid sites and initial yield of propene the amount of coke deposited during DHP-CO2 process increases. Such a relation between the deactivation and coke amount can be explained in terms of the substrateproduct reactivity. Several recent investiga- tions concerning dehydrogenations of hydrocarbons with CO2 indi- cate that the coke is produced more intensively from unsaturated hydrocarbons than from saturated ones [26,27]. Therefore, with in- crease of propane conversion to more reactive propene, intensifica- tion of coking during DHP-CO2 is observed. We cannot exclude that lower coke amount deposited on the samples containing Al is due to generation of new  AlOGa  sites as was proposed in literature [17,18]. However, our NH3-TPD results did not show significant differ- ence in the acid site strength between pure Ga2O3 and Ga2O3Al2O3 nanoreplicas.
During 4 h of process over mesoporous oxides, propene was obtained with slightly higher selectivity than over the reference Ga2O3-t sample. For example, in the presence of mesoporous Ga2O3m the selectivity to propene was 9195%, while over Ga2O3-t; which has identical chemical composition; the selectivity was 8592%. It has been found that in DHP-CO2 process over the Ga-containing materials the selectivity to propene depends on two factors. The first factor is as- sociated with the acidity which is determined either by the phase com- position of Ga2O3 or by the properties of the support [13,15,16,19]. For example, over α- and β-Ga2O3 polymorphs propene was obtained with a higher selectivity in DHP-CO2 than over δ- and γ-Ga2O3 [15].
The second factor is pore geometry which is important especially in the case of highly porous Ga-containing materials [19]. Since the XRD measurements prove that both Ga2O3m and Ga2O3-t have identical phase compositions (Table 1 and supplement Fig. 3S) we suspect that higher selectivity to propene over Ga2O3m is probably caused by its uniform mesopore structure with the higher order of pore size distribu- tion. It is most likely that mesoporosity facilitates the dehydrogenation reaction due to the rapid diffusion of the products in the available space of the biggest pores preventing against side reactions, which could decrease the selectivity to propene. However, such explanation needs further more careful investigation concerning the relationship between kinetics of the DHP-CO2 and pore structure of nanoreplicas.
Table 3 summarizes the catalytic results obtained after 10 min- on-stream over Ga2O3m at three different temperatures.
Propene is the primary product formed at all the studied tempera- tures. In addition, light hydrocarbons (methane, ethane and ethene) as well as small amounts of aromatic hydrocarbons (benzene and toluene) are produced. The selectivity to the side products rises with temperature indicating that hydrocracking, cracking and dehydrocyclization reac- tions are more privileged at high temperatures. With increasing reaction temperature the amount of coke estimated on the basis of TG analysis rises as well (the last column in Table 3) suggesting that in the dehydrogenation of propane in the presence of CO2 the reaction of Boudouard (Ccoke+CO2=2CO) does not suppress coke deposition.

Finally, the stability of Ga2O3m was investigated. Fig. 5A displays the variation of propene yield vs. time-on-stream in four consecutive dehydrogenation cycles at 823 K.
In each cycle, the yield of propene gradually decreases due to coking. However, after short regeneration with air the mesoporous Ga2O3m almost completely recovers its catalytic performance.
Moreover, comparison of the initial propene yield in each cycle shows that it drops only slightly. This suggests a high stability of Ga2O3m under the operation conditions. The structural characteriza- tion of regenerated Ga2O3m after the last dehydrogenation cycle reveals only small changes. A clear XRD (100) reflection (Fig. 5B) and narrow mesopore distributions (inset to Fig. 5C) confirm that the hexagonal pore structure was not changed considerably during the catalytic process.
4. Conclusions
Nanocasting was applied for the preparation of thermally stable mesoporous Ga2O3 and Ga2O3-Al2O3 oxides with large specific surface areas (231322 m2·g1), uniform mesopores in the 314 nm range and pore architecture similar to that of SBA-15 (hexagonal structure).
Pure mesoporous Ga2O3m and mixed GaAlO(Al/Ga=1:4) exhibit a promising catalytic performance in the dehydrogenation of propane to propene in the presence of CO2. Under the reaction conditions Ga2O3m exerts high structure stability and higher resistance to deac- tivation in comparison with the Ga2O3-t material obtained without a hard template.
