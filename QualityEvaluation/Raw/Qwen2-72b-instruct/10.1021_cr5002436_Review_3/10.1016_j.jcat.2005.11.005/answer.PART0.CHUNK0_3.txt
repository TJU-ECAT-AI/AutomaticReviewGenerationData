1.The increasing demand for light olefins and the insufficient capacity of current production by steam and catalytic cracking are the driving forces behind the investigation of alternative ways to manufacture these chemicals. Supported vanadium oxide (VOx) catalysts for the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of light alkanes have been studied extensively. They have also been explored in the dehydrogenation (DH) of light alkanes, including propane and butane, and show promise to be both active and selective for DH reactions. However, due to the limited number of studies on supported VOx for alkane DH, many questions remain unanswered; for example, the structure of supported VOx and the mechanism of deactivation/coke deposition under DH conditions are unclear. The focus of this study is to investigate the structure of surface VOx and the coke formation process during butane DH over V/θ-Al2O3 catalysts with various surface VOx densities using in situ UV Raman spectroscopy.

1.对轻烯烃需求的增加和目前通过蒸汽和催化裂解生产这些化学品的能力不足是探索制造这些化学品的替代方法的推动力。对轻烷氧化脱氢(ODH)用的负载型氧化钒(VOx)催化剂进行了广泛的研究。它们也被用于轻烷烃(包括丙烷和丁烷)的脱氢(DH)研究,并显示出对DH反应既具有活性又具有选择性的前景。然而,由于对烷烃DH用的负载型VOx的研究数量有限,许多问题仍然没有答案;例如,负载型VOx的结构以及在DH条件下失活/焦炭沉积的机制尚不清楚。本研究的重点是利用原位紫外拉曼光谱研究不同表面VOx密度下V/θ-Al2O3催化剂在丁烷DH过程中表面VOx的结构和焦炭形成过程。
