1.The increasing demand for light olefins and the insufficient capacity of current production by steam and catalytic crack- ing are the driving forces behind the investigation of alternative ways to manufacture these chemicals. Supported vanadium oxide (VOx) catalysts for the * Corresponding author. ODH of light alkanes have been studied extensively. They have also been explored in the DH of light alkanes, in- cluding propane and butane, and show promise to be both active and selective for DH reactions. Meanwhile, deactivation of VOx cata- lysts by coke species is also observed with time on stream in butane DH reactions. However, due to the limited number of studies on supported VOx for alkane DH, many questions re- main unanswered; for example, the structure of supported VOx and the mechanism of deactivation/coke deposition under DH conditions are unclear. The focus of this study is to investigate the structure of sur- face VOx and the coke formation process during butane DH over V/θ-Al2O3 catalysts with various surface VOx densities (0.0314.2 V/nm2) using in situ UV Raman spectroscopy. Our recent study suggested the existence of three types of VOx speciesmonovanadate, polyvanadate, and V2O5on the sur- face of θ-Al2O3. The distribution of these VOx species de- pends on the surface VOx density. Monovanadate is the only species on the sample with VOx density 0.16 V/nm2; poly- vanadates coexist with monovanadate on samples with a surface VOx density of 1.2 V/nm2, and a mixture of monovanadate,polyvanadates and crystalline V2O5 is found on samples with surface VOx density >1.2 V/nm2.

1.对轻烯烃需求的增加和当前通过蒸汽和催化裂化生产这些化学品的产能不足是探索制造这些化学品的替代方法的推动力。对于*通讯作者。轻烷烃的ODH，已广泛研究了支撑的钒氧化物(VOx)催化剂。它们还被探索用于轻烷烃的DH，包括丙烷和丁烷，显示出对DH反应具有活性和选择性的前景。同时，VOx催化剂在丁烷DH反应中随时间的推移，观察到由焦炭物种引起的失活。然而，由于对支撑VOx用于烷烃DH的研究有限，许多问题仍然没有答案；例如，支撑VOx的结构和在DH条件下失活/焦炭沉积的机制尚不清楚。本研究的重点是利用原位UV Raman光谱研究不同表面VOx密度(0.0314.2 V/nm2)下V/θ-Al2O3催化剂表面VOx的结构和丁烷DH过程中的焦炭形成过程。我们最近的研究表明，在θ-Al2O3的表面存在三种类型的VOx物种：单钒酸盐、多钒酸盐和V2O5。这些VOx物种的分布取决于表面VOx的密度。单钒酸盐是唯一在VOx密度为0.16 V/nm2的样品上的物种；多钒酸盐与单钒酸盐共存于表面VOx密度为1.2 V/nm2的样品上，在表面VOx密度>1.2 V/nm2的样品上发现单钒酸盐、多钒酸盐和结晶V2O5的混合物。
