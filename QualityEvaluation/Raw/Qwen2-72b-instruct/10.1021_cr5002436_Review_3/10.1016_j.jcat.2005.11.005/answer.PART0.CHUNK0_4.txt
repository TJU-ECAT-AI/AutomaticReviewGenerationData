1.The increasing demand for light olefins and the insufficient capacity of current production by steam and catalytic crack- ing are the driving forces behind the investigation of alternative ways to manufacture these chemicals. Supported vanadium oxide (VOx) catalysts for the dehydrogenation (DH) and oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of light alkanes have been studied extensively. They have also been explored in the DH of light alkanes, including propane and butane, and show promise to be both active and selective for DH reactions. The structure of supported VOx and the mechanism of deactivation/coke deposition under DH conditions are unclear. The focus of this study is to investigate the structure of surface VOx and the coke formation process during butane DH over V/θ-Al2O3 catalysts with various surface VOx densities using in situ UV Raman spectroscopy.

1.对轻烯烃日益增长的需求和当前通过蒸汽和催化裂化生产这些化学品的产能不足是探索替代制造这些化学品方法的推动力。对轻烷烃的脱氢(DH)和氧化脱氢(ODH)进行了广泛研究，支持的钒氧化物(VOx)催化剂。它们也被探索用于轻烷烃，包括丙烷和丁烷的DH，并显示出对DH反应既具有活性又具有选择性的前景。支持VOx的结构和DH条件下失活/焦炭沉积的机制尚不清楚。本研究的重点是利用原位UV Raman光谱研究不同表面VOx密度下V/θ-Al2O3催化剂表面VOx的结构和丁烷DH过程中的焦炭形成过程。
