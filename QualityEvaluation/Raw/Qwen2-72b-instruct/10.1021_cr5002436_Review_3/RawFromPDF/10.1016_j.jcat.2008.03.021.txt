Dehydrogenation of propane to propylene in the presence or absence of carbon dioxide was performed
over a series of mixed GaxAl10−xO15 oxides (with x varying from 0 to 10) synthesized through an alcoholic
coprecipitation pathway. Among the various compositions of GaxAl10−xO15, the maximum activity was
observed for x = 8. Whereas the same tendency was observed for the speciﬁc activity normalized by
BET surface area, signiﬁcantly enhanced stability was achieved for Ga2O3–Al2O3 with higher aluminum
content. A correlation between the NH3-TPD results and the initial activity for GaxAl10−xO15 reveals that
a high population of surface acid sites related to tetrahedral Ga3+ cations is important to achieving high
activity. The speciﬁc interaction between Ga2O3 and Al2O3 due to the formation of spinel-type γ -Ga2O3–
Al2O3 solid solutions is suggested to play a key role in the dispersion and distribution of surface gallium
sites, which makes GaxAl10−xO15 composites highly active and stable for the reaction.

1. Introduction
The catalytic dehydrogenation of alkanes is a process of con-
siderable importance, because it represents a route for obtaining
alkenes from poorly reactive and low-cost saturated feedstocks
[1–3]. In this respect, an important reaction is the dehydrogenation
of propane to propylene [4–6]. This process is of increasing signif-
icance due to the limited capabilities of steam cracking and ﬂuid
catalytic cracking to meet the increasing demands of the propy-
lene market [7–9]. In this sense, chromium oxide-based catalysts
have been used for the dehydrogenation of propane in the absence
of hydrogen as a co-feed gas [10–12], and platinum-based cata-
lysts have been used for the dehydrogenation of propane in the
presence of hydrogen [13–16]. From environmental and practical
standpoints, however, chromium-free catalysts are highly desirable
for the dehydrogenation of propane in the absence of hydrogen [5].
In recent years, Ga2O3-based catalysts have attracted interest
as potential candidates for alkane dehydrogenation processes [5,
17–21]. This was prompted by Nakagawa’s reports of exceptionally
high activity of the commercial Ga2O3 for the dehydrogenation of
ethane to ethylene in the presence of CO2 [20]. Although commer-
cial Ga2O3 has been shown to be far superior for the ethane de-
hydrogenation reaction compared with Cr2O3 and V2O5 catalysts,
some recent studies have demonstrated that supported gallium
oxides can be more active and stable for the dehydrogenation of
light alkanes [5,21–23]. In particular, promising results have been

obtained when the Ga2O3 catalysts are dispersed on an inert ox-
ide support, such as TiO2 or Al2O3 [21,23], which were found to
be quite active in the propane dehydrogenation reaction even at
temperatures as low as 773 K [23]. Other Ga2O3-based systems
evaluated in the recent literature as alkane dehydrogenation cat-
alysts include different polymorphs of Ga2O3, such as α-, β-, γ -,
and δ-Ga2O3 [24].
Despite extensive efforts dedicated to the reaction mechanism
and the factors that control activity, the aforementioned Ga2O3-
based catalysts all deactivate drastically within a few hours [21,
23,24], because a high density of medium-strong acid sites on the
surface of the Ga2O3-based materials favors considerable coke for-
mation under alkane dehydrogenation conditions [21,23,25]. Neu-
tralizing the acid sites by introducing potassium to the gallium
oxide system has been used in propane dehydrogenation in an ef-
fort to suppress coke deposition [4]; however, this leads only to
a drastic drop in catalytic activity. In the continuing search for
more effective technologies for propylene production [4–6], there
is a deﬁnite need for new, improved gallia-based catalysts that can
allow eﬃcient and stable dehydrogenation of propane in the pres-
ence of carbon dioxide under mild conditions.
Based on their superior ability to activate hydrocarbon species,
gallia–alumina solid solutions have attracted considerable recent
attention as excellent materials for the selective catalytic reduction
(SCR) of NOx by hydrocarbons owing to their unique surface acidity
properties [26–30]. To the best of our knowledge, however, the use
of Ga2O3–Al2O3 solid solutions as catalysts in the alkane dehydro-
genation reaction has not yet been reported. In the present study,
we investigated the development of a new, eﬃcient Ga2O3–Al2O3
solid solution system exhibiting signiﬁcantly enhanced activity and

stability for the catalytic dehydrogenation of propane. Our results
demonstrate that the formation of gallia–alumina solid solution
between Ga2O3 and Al2O3 can allow the favorable creation of a
higher population of surface gallium sites with weak Lewis acidity,
which makes the Ga2O3-based catalysts highly active and stable
for the reaction.
2. Experimental
2.1. Catalyst preparation
A series of mixed Ga2O3–Al2O3 oxide catalysts with various
compositions as well as the simple oxide of Al2O3 and Ga2O3 were
prepared through an alcoholic coprecipitation pathway [31]. In a
typical synthesis, concentrated aqueous ammonia (28 wt%) and
ethanol (50:50 in volume) was added dropwise to the ethanol so-
lution of gallium nitrate hydrate (Aldrich, 99.99%) and aluminum
nitrate hydrate (Fluka, 99.9%) with different Ga:Al molar ratio un-
til pH ca. 8.5 and no further precipitation occurred. The resulting
gel was quickly ﬁltered and thoroughly washed by ethanol, dried
at 373 K overnight, and ﬁnally calcined at 773 K for 6 h.
2.2. Catalyst characterization
The BET speciﬁc surface areas of the samples were determined
by adsorption–desorption of nitrogen at liquid nitrogen tempera-
ture using a Micromeritics TriStar 3000 instrument. Powder X-ray
diffraction (XRD) of the catalysts was carried out on a Germany
Bruker D8Advance X-ray diffractometer using nickel-ﬁltered CuKα
radiation at 40 kV and 20 mA. The acidic property of each cata-
lyst was characterized by NH3-TPD. NH3 was adsorbed at 393 K
after pretreatment at 773 K in a He stream. The desorbed NH3
in ﬂowing He gas was quantiﬁed (NH2 fragment of mass number
16) by mass spectroscopy (Balzers OmniStar) at 393–873 K (ramp
rate, 10 K min−1). To characterize the nature of the acid sites, spec-
tra of chemisorbed pyridine were obtained with a Bruker Vector
22 spectrometer using self-supporting wafers in a heatable IR gas
cell. The samples were pretreated at 773 K for 1 h under vac-
uum before pyridine adsorption. Pyridine was adsorbed at room
temperature from an argon ﬂow containing 2 vol% pyridine, after
which the samples were heated to 373 K and evacuated to remove
physisorbed and weakly chemisorbed pyridine. Each spectrum was
obtained by subtracting the background (base spectrum) of the un-
loaded sample.
The XPS spectra of the samples were obtained with a Perkin–
Elmer PHI 5000C spectrometer working in the constant analyzer
energy mode with MgKα radiation as the excitation source. The
carbonaceous C 1s line (284.6 eV) was used as the reference
to calibrate the binding energies (BEs). Elemental analysis was
performed using ion-coupled plasma (ICP) atomic emission spec-
troscopy on a Thermo Electron IRIS Intrepid II XSP spectrometer.
Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was conducted on a Perkin–
Elmer TGA-7 analyzer to determine the amount of coke deposited
on the catalyst after the reaction. Twenty milligrams of sample
was heated from room temperature to 873 K at a heating rate
of 10 K min−1 in ﬂowing air. 71Ga MAS NMR measurements were
performed on a Bruker Avance DMX-500 spectrometer operating
at 152.5 MHz, equipped with a 2.5-mm double-bearing MAS probe
head spinning at 30 kHz. Approximately 40,000 transients were
accumulated for each sample with a 0.1-s recycling delay. The
chemical shifts were referenced to 1 mol L−1 Ga(NO3)3 solution.
2.3. Catalytic activity tests
Catalytic tests were performed in a ﬁxed-bed ﬂow microreactor
at atmospheric pressure, with a catalyst load of 200 mg. Nitrogen
was used as the carrier gas at a ﬂow rate of 10 mL min−1. The cat-
alysts were pretreated at 773 K for 1 h in nitrogen ﬂow, and the
reaction temperature was 773 K. For dehydrogenation of propane
in the absence of CO2, the gas reactant contained 2.5 vol% propane
and the balance nitrogen (N2). For dehydrogenation of propane in
the presence of carbon dioxide, the gas reactant contained 2.5 vol%
propane, 5 vol% CO2, and the balance nitrogen. The hydrocarbon
reaction products were analyzed with an online gas chromatograph
(Type GC-122, Shanghai) equipped with a 6-m packed column of
Porapak Q and a ﬂame ionization detector. The gas products, in-
cluding N2, CO, and CO2, were analyzed online by another gas
chromatograph equipped with a TDX-01 column and a TCD.
2.4. Transient response of the pulsed reactions
Transient response measurements of pulsed reactions were car-
ried out at 773 K using a U-shaped quartz reactor (4 mm i.d.,
400 mm long), with 100 mg of the catalyst charged into the re-
actor. A pulse of propylene gas was introduced through a six-port
gas-sampling valve equipped with measuring tubes under a stream
of CO2 carrier gas. The signals of C3H6 (M/e = 41), CO (M/e = 28),
and H2 (M/e = 2), were recorded simultaneously by a Balzers Om-
niStar quadrupole mass spectrometer. Measured intensities were
corrected for the relative sensitivities of the respective ions.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Structural characterization
The powder XRD patterns of mixed Ga2O3–Al2O3 oxides with
nominal Ga:Al ratios of 4:1, 1:1, and 1:4 closely resembled those
of simple oxides of γ -Ga2O3 and γ -Al2O3. No diffraction lines as-
signed to other polymorphs of Ga2O3 were observed for all mixed
Ga2O3–Al2O3 oxide samples, although several phases of gallium
oxide (e.g., α-, β-, and δ-Ga2O3) are known to be present de-
pending on the treatment conditions [32]. As shown in Fig. 1, all
diffraction lines were very broad, demonstrating a low crystallinity
of all of the samples. This low crystallinity is a common feature of
the metastable γ -variety of both alumina and gallia polymorphs
[31] and was expected due to the high surface area of the mixed
Ga2O3–Al2O3 samples, for which nitrogen adsorption isotherms at
77 K gave BET surface area values ranging from 119 m2 g−1 for
the sample with a nominal Ga:Al ratio of 4:1 to 147 m2 g−1 for
Ga:Al = 1:4 (Table 1). Within this range of end values, speciﬁc
surface area was found to increase monotonously with increasing
aluminum content of the mixed gallia–alumina oxides.
Despite the broadness, the diffraction maxima evidenced in the
XRD patterns of the gallia–alumina samples could be assigned to
a single phase having the cubic spinel-type structure (space group
Fd3m) [33], as shown by the indexing in Fig. 1. The position of
the diffraction angle (2θ value) was found to decrease with in-
creasing aluminum content of the samples, thus suggesting solid
solution formation [24,31,34]. From the measured d(440) spacings,
corresponding values of the cubic lattice parameter, a0, were de-
termined; these values are plotted in the inset of Fig. 1 as a
function of gallium content of the mixed oxides. The a0 values of
0.790 nm for pure γ -Al2O3 and 0.832 nm for pure γ -Ga2O3 are
in good accordance with the values reported in the literature [31].
The a0 value for the gallia–alumina mixed oxides showed an ap-
proximately linear dependence on the chemical composition. This
result, taken together with the absence of any diffraction line not
assignable to a single cubic phase in the corresponding XRD pat-
terns, gives strong evidence of the formation of a series of spinel-
type solid solutions with the chemical composition GaxAl10−xO15
(0 < x < 10).

The 71Ga MAS NMR chemical shift is known to reﬂect the coor-
dination state of the Ga3+ ion in oxide compounds [31,34]. Fig. 2
shows the 71Ga MAS NMR spectra of the mixed Ga2O3–Al2O3 sam-
ples and the γ -Ga2O3 sample. Two asymmetric bands, split into at
least four spinning sidebands, with chemical shifts of about 180
and 10 ppm [referred to Ga(NO3)3] appeared in the NMR spec-
tra of the GaxAl10−xO15 samples. According to the literature [31,
34–37], these bands are assigned to the central transition of the
Ga3+ ion occupying tetrahedral (GaIV) and octahedral (GaVI) sites,
respectively. With increasing aluminum content, a progressively
increasing intensity of the line due to the tetrahedral Ga3+ ion
(∼180 ppm) was observed for the GaxAl10−xO15 samples, as op-
posed to the trend for the octahedral Ga3+ ion (10 ppm). A peak
deconvolution of the NMR GaIV and GaVI bands provides more
information about the Ga3+ distribution (among tetrahedral and
octahedral sites) in the spinel structure. As shown in Table 1, the
percentage of Ga3+ ions (referred to the total Ga content of the
mixed oxides) found in tetrahedral sites increased markedly with
decreasing Ga/Al ratio, indicating that the Ga3+ ions preferentially

occupied the tetrahedral sites of the defect spinel structure of the
γ -Ga2O3–Al2O3 solid solution [35–37]. The tetrahedral preference
of Ga3+, also found for many other spinels containing gallium [30,
31,38,39], can be explained in terms of a covalent contribution to
the metal–oxygen bond, which is strongly developed in closed-
shell d10 ions, such as Ga3+.
3.2. Surface acidity measurements
The surface acidity of the mixed Ga2O3–Al2O3 oxides, as well
as simple oxides of γ -Ga2O3 and γ -Al2O3, was measured by the
NH3-TPD method. Because of the site’s low density and moderate
strength, the samples were ﬂushed with nitrogen after ammonia

adsorption at a low temperature (393 K) before the TPD measure-
ments. All of the samples exhibited two desorption peaks: a broad
peak at 393–623 K and a smaller peak at 673–800 K, correspond-
ing to acid sites of weak and medium strength, respectively [23].
The relative acid values obtained from the NH3-TPD measurements
are given in Table 2. Because no obvious relationship between the
surface acidity of the oxides and the composition of the mixed
oxides was observed, we correlated the speciﬁc acid site density
(expressed in terms of μmol m−2) and the Ga3+ distribution based
on the 71Ga NMR data. The results, given in Fig. 3, show that the
weak acid site density for the gallia–alumina mixed oxides is an
approximately linear function of the tetrahedral Ga3+ population.
This result, in conjunction with much higher population of weak
acid sites relative to medium sites, suggests the essential role of
tetrahedral surface Ga3+ sites in creating the surface acidity of the
mixed oxides [40,41].
Additional insight into the acid nature of the catalysts was
gained from the pyridine adsorption coupled with FTIR measure-
ments reported in Fig. 4. The results show that pyridine adsorption
on fresh catalysts at room temperature, followed by evacuation at
423 K, gave rise to three characteristic IR bands at 1614 cm−1 (ν8a),
1490 cm+1 (ν19a), and ca. 1452 cm−1 (ν19b), which can be assigned
to pyridine species interacting with Lewis acid sites [34,40,42]. Ac-
cording to the literature data, these Lewis acid sites are related to
coordinatively unsaturated (cus) Ga3+ or Al3+ ions in the tetrahe-
dral position [40]. No bands were observed at 1640 or 1545 cm−1
in the spectra corresponding to pyridinium ions, indicating that
the material under study has no Brønsted acid sites of suﬃcient
strength to protonate the adsorbed molecule [42]. It is notewor-
thy that an appreciable increase in the intensity of the ν19b band
of adsorbed pyridine also has been identiﬁed for the mixed-oxide

catalysts with respect to the simple oxide of γ -Ga2O3, further con-
ﬁrming the greater surface density of Lewis acid sites that can be
achieved over the mixed-oxide materials.
3.3. Dehydrogenation of propane
The dehydrogenation of propane to propylene over the ﬁve
mixed- or single-oxide catalysts in the presence or absence of CO2
was investigated at 773 K. The major product formed in the reac-
tion was propylene, and the minor products were ethane, ethylene,
and methane. Note that the aromatization of propane occurring
predominantly over Ga-ZSM-5 systems [43] was not identiﬁed in
the present study, possibly due to the absence of Gaδ+ (δ < 2)
species on XPS measurements (not shown). The results, reported
in Table 3, point to a marked composition effect on the catalytic
performance of the GaxAl10−xO15 samples. The simple oxide of
γ -Al2O3 demonstrated very low activity, consistent with the in-
ferior activity of alumina and other metal oxides reported in the
literature [20], indicating that the presence of Ga species is in-
dispensable to the genesis of catalytically active sites for alkane
dehydrogenation. For all of the Ga-containing materials, the selec-
tivity to propylene was always high (>91%), whereas the highest
conversion of propane was 51.7%. The initial conversion of propane
on the catalysts decreased in the order Ga8Al2O15 > γ -Ga2O3 >
Ga5Al5O15 > Ga2Al8O15, with the same tendency observed for the
speciﬁc activity normalized by BET surface area. This demonstrates
that despite its lower Ga2O3 content, a γ -Ga2O3–Al2O3 solid solu-

tion with suitable composition can be even more active than bulk
γ -Ga2O3. Moreover, the promoting role of carbon dioxide in the
dehydrogenation of propane was not observed in all samples. Such
a negative effect was previously reported by Xu et al. over Al2O3-
and ZrO2-supported gallium oxide catalysts [23]. This unexpected
phenomenon has been attributed to the greatly reduced propane
adsorption capacity when CO2 is introduced into these systems
[21,23].
Fig. 5 characterizes the catalytic performance in both processes
as a function of reaction time. For all of the catalysts, propane con-
version decreased with increasing reaction time. Thus decreased
propene yield can be attributed to carbon deposition on the sur-
face of Ga2O3-based materials, as suggested in previous work
[24,25]. With the γ -Ga2O3 catalyst, rapid deactivation of the cata-
lyst in both the presence and absence of carbon dioxide was seen,
and conversion of propane decreased from 35.9 to 17% and from
41.3 to 11.6% within 8 h, respectively. In contrast, the propylene
yields were increased markedly by the introduction of aluminum
in both the presence and absence of carbon dioxide in the runs for
8 h. In addition, propane conversion of the GaxAl10−xO15 catalysts
at steady state were considerably higher in the presence of carbon
dioxide than in the absence of carbon dioxide, indicating remark-
able stability as a function of time on stream. The amounts of coke
deposited on the four Ga-containing catalysts in both processes
evaluated by TGA, given in Table 1, indicate that the markedly en-
hanced stability of the GaxAl10−xO15 catalysts in the presence of
CO2 may be due to their low coking tendency as a function of
time on stream, which appears to be rather unique in this type of
application.
Previous investigations of the use of Ga2O3-based catalysts for
ethane or propane dehydrogenation have found that various pa-
rameters, including the nature of the support, the coordination
state and reducibility of gallium species, and the acid/base prop-
erties and gallium content of the catalysts, must be considered to
account for the observed catalytic behavior in the dehydrogenation
of light alkanes [4,21–25]. Generally, a catalyst with a high surface
acid site density performs better in the dehydrogenation of alka-
nes [24]. To clarify the dependence of the catalytic activity on in-
corporation of aluminum, Fig. 6 illustrates the correlation between
the initial activity of the GaxAl10−xO15 catalysts in the presence of
CO2 and the density of both weak and medium-strong acid sites
as determined by NH3-TPD. Whereas the variation of surface weak
acid site density demonstrated excellent correlation with the cor-
responding propane conversion rates, a negative correlation was
identiﬁed between activity and medium-strong acid site density.
This indicates that weak surface acidity (speciﬁcally, weak Lewis
acid site density of the surface), not medium-strong surface acid-
ity, is crucial to achieving high activity and stability. This result,

along with the essential nature of tetrahedral Ga3+ population in
contributing to weak surface acidity, provides strong evidence of
the key role of surface tetrahedral Ga3+ sites in propane dehydro-
genation.
The participation of surface Ga3+ Lewis sites in gallia-based cat-
alysts for hydrocarbon activation has been reported [30]. In this
context, it has been suggested that hydrocarbon activation pro-
ceeds on low-coordinated Ga3+ cations, which may play a role in
the chemical activation of propane by proton abstraction, leading
to the formation of propyl-gallium adspecies [23,24]. The dehydro-
genation products are formed by subsequent decomposition of the
resulting propyl-Ga species. A recent spectroscopic investigation by
Kazansky et al. [44] found that the low-coordinated Ga3+ Lewis
sites over gallium oxide were highly effective in the heterolytic
dissociative adsorption of ethane even at room temperature. This
unusual alkane activation behavior was linked to a very strong po-
larizability of the C–H bonds resulting from perturbation of ethane
by the low-coordinated Ga3+ cations [44]. This may well account
for the markedly improved propane dehydrogenation activity of
the Ga2O3–Al2O3 solid solution materials compared with simple
gallium oxide. In this respect, it appears that more active cata-
lysts for propane dehydrogenation can be obtained by achieving
a higher population of low-coordinated surface Ga3+ sites in the
Ga2O3-based catalysts.
3.4. Stability and regeneration test
One of the main problems when using Ga2O3-based catalysts
in the dehydrogenation of propane is their deactivation with time
on stream [25]. To examine the likely long-term behavior of the
gallia–alumina solid solution catalysts under reaction conditions,
an extended 50-h on-stream operation for dehydrogenation of
propane in the presence of CO2 was carried out on the Ga5Al5O15
and γ -Ga2O3 catalysts. As shown in Fig. 7, despite the presence of
CO2, rapid deactivation of the catalyst performance was observed
for the simple oxide of γ -Ga2O3. After 16 h, propane conver-
sion decreased signiﬁcantly, to 2.1%. This signiﬁcant decrease in
propane conversion is consistent with the poor stability of Ga2O3-
based catalysts reported in the literature [24]. Compared with the
γ -Ga2O3 catalyst, the Ga5Al5O15 sample exhibited signiﬁcantly en-
hanced stability despite being slightly inferior to γ -Ga2O3 at the
initial stage of the reaction. The Ga5Al5O15 catalyst deactivated

from an initial propane conversion value of 33.7 to 26.5% after 16 h
on stream, corresponding to an activity loss of 17.2%. This loss of
activity compares favorably with that of 94% for γ -Ga2O3 from an
initial conversion of 35.9 to 2.1% after the same period of opera-
tion. It is noteworthy that even after 50 h on stream, high conver-
sion of propane (up to 22.5%) was still maintained for Ga5Al5O15.
To the best of our knowledge, simple Ga2O3 as a dehydrogena-
tion catalyst is inclined to deactivate rapidly, a problem that needs
to be addressed [21,24]. Remarkable stability for propane dehydro-
genation was recently reported for an HZSM-5-supported Ga2O3
catalyst at 873 K, but at the expense of marked side reactions,
such as propane aromatization [25]. With high selectivity to propy-
lene, such outstanding stability for the gallia-containing catalysts
has never before been reported.
To gain more insight into the dehydrogenation of propane in
the presence of CO2 over GaxAl10−xO15 catalysts, a pulsed reac-
tion technique was used to measure propylene adsorption over
the catalyst [21]. Fig. 8 shows the transient response of propylene
adsorption over various Ga2O3-based catalysts against a pulsed in-
troduction of propylene at 773 K under a steady ﬂow of CO2.
Nearly the same response of propylene with a similar propylene
area relative to the blank runs was observed for the Ga2Al8O15 cat-
alyst; however, the propylene response was lower for the γ -Ga2O3,
Ga8Al2O15, and Ga5Al5O15 catalysts than for the blank runs. In ad-
dition, the higher the gallium content, the smaller the propylene
signals. It is interesting to note that although the simple oxide γ -
Ga2O3 catalyst is characterized by a lower surface Lewis acidity, as
evidenced by the NH3-TPD and pyridine adsorption measurements,
the desorption of propylene from the catalyst surface appeared to
be favored on the surface of the gallia–alumina mixed oxide cata-
lysts. Although more work is needed to clarify the unusual adsorp-
tion behavior of propylene on the weak surface Lewis acid sites,
we believe that factors other than surface acidity, such as compet-
itive adsorption due to the presence of CO2, may play a role in
determining the unique adsorption capability of the Ga–Al mixed
oxide materials. Therefore, in conjunction with the coking forma-
tion data derived from TGA of the spent catalyst (Table 1), the
results seem to indicate that the increased desorption of propy-
lene from the catalyst surface is responsible for enhanced stability
of the GaxAl10−xO15 catalysts during the catalytic dehydrogenation
of propane [45–47].
Another issue of practical importance is the stability of the de-
hydrogenation catalyst after repeated regeneration cycles. Attempts
were made to regenerate the deactivated γ -Ga2O3, Ga8Al2O15, and
Ga5Al5O15 catalysts subjected to 8 h of reaction in the absence of

CO2 by recalcinating the used catalyst in ﬂowing air at 823 K for
4 h, followed by subsequent purging with N2. This procedure was
found to be suﬃcient to burn off all carbon species deposited on
the deactivated catalysts. As shown in Fig. 9, the Ga5Al5O15 cata-
lyst was much more stable than the other two samples. Clearly, the
original activity of the Ga5Al5O15 catalyst could be fully restored,
with no noticeable deactivation detected even after the second re-
generation. The Ga8Al2O15 catalyst was deactivated from an initial
conversion value of propane of 51.7% at 773 K to 45.5% after two
successive reaction–regeneration cycles, corresponding to an activ-
ity loss of 11.9%. This loss of activity compares favorably with that
of γ -Ga2O3, which exhibited poor aging properties in terms of a
26.9% loss from the initial steady conversion of 41.3 to 30.2% after
completing the cycling process.
Given the thermally metastable nature of the γ -type gallium
oxide materials [32,34,48], to gain further insight into the affect
of repeated regeneration on the phase structure in relation to the
catalytic behavior of the mixed Ga2O3–Al2O3 oxides, the phase
structure of the twice-regenerated catalysts (Fig. 9) was evaluated
by XRD, as shown in Fig. 10. For the γ -Ga2O3 sample, the major

phase after repeated regeneration was conﬁrmed to be β-Ga2O3,
which is the only stable form of Ga2O3 known [32,34,48]. Along
with such signiﬁcant phase transformation, the BET surface area of
the γ -Ga2O3 sample also dropped dramatically to 58 m2 g−1 (as
shown in Table 1), which may explain the poor performance of the
simple oxide of γ -Ga2O3 after repeated regeneration cycles. It is
noteworthy that for GaxAl10−xO15, no signiﬁcant differences were
seen in the diffraction patterns obtained before (Figs. 1b, 1c) and
after (Figs. 10b, 10c) the repeated regeneration, demonstrating the
improved thermal stability achievable over the mixed Ga2O3–Al2O3
oxide materials. The maintenance of the γ -phase of the solid solu-
tion materials on repeated thermal treatment is further supported
by the N2 adsorption data given in Table 1. Although repeated re-
generation led to a general decrease in the speciﬁc surface area,
higher surface areas (>100 m2 g−1) were always found for the
mixed-oxide materials. Similar improved thermal stability was re-
ported by Horiuchi et al. for alumina–gallia aerogel materials [49].
Thus, it can be concluded that the remarkable heat-tolerant nature
of the Ga2O3–Al2O3 materials with favorable surface and textural
properties is responsible for these materials’ superior activity and
stability in propane dehydrogenation.
4. Conclusion
The present work studied the catalytic dehydrogenation of
propane in the presence or absence of CO2 over a series of
GaxAl10−xO15 mixed oxides. Among the various compositions of
GaxAl10−xO15, the maximum initial activity and propylene yield
were observed at x = 8. The most interesting ﬁnding of this study
is the signiﬁcantly enhanced stability at high conversion levels for
Ga5Al5O15. The enhanced catalytic activity of GaxAl10−xO15 mixed
oxides can be linked to the abundant speciﬁc surface acid sites re-
lated to tetrahedral surface Ga3+ sites resulting from the formation
of Ga2O3–Al2O3 solid solution in the mixed-oxide systems. Com-
paring the NH3-TPD results and propane dehydrogenation activity
reveals that weak surface acidity (speciﬁcally, the weak Lewis acid
site density of the surface), not medium-strong surface acidity, is
important for achieving high activity and stability.
