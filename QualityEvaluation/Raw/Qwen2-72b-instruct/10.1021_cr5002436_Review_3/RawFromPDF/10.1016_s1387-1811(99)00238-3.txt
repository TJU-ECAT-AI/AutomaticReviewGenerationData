Abstract
X-ray absorption ( XANES and EXAFS) at the Ga K-edge and the Pt L-edge was used to monitor the variation
of chemical states of gallium and platinum under in situ redox treatments in Pt/Ga/H-beta zeolites prepared by
incipient wetness impregnation. It was found that the Ga species exist mainly as isolated GaO4 units after calcination.
Upon reduction, the gallium(III) cations are removed from the lattice to form gallium hydride oligomers or attach
to metallic platinum particles on the support. The gallium hydride oligomer is considered to be two Ga atoms
separated by a distance of 2.99 A
˚ with bridging H atoms. Both Ga K-edge and Pt L-edge EXAFS analyses indicate
the formation of GaPt bimetallic species with an interatomic distance of 2.51–2.54 A
˚ . These can prevent the sintering
of Pt aggregates to large particles and aﬀect the role of Pt in Pt/Ga/zeolites in aromatization of light paraﬃns. © 2000

Curve-ﬁtting procedures began with the ab
initio calculation of the phase shift and amplitude
functions for single-scattering of atom pairs using
the FEFF6 program [28]. As input to FEFF6, we
used a known atom cluster from several reference
compounds (such as Ga2O3, Pt metal) and intera-
tomic distances from published crystal structures.
After calculation by FEFF6, we could get the
theoretical phase shift and amplitude functions for
diﬀerent atom pairs, including the following:

proposed in this paper, we also got theoretical
functions of GaMPt or PtMGa and Ga,Ga from
FEFF6. The ﬁtting between the theory and experi-

is formed between Pt and Ga after high temper-

The experimental EXAFS data and curve-ﬁtting

and Pt/Ga/BEA(r, 550°C) are shown in Figs. 5

due to PtMPt pairs was observed in the FT EXAFS
of 1.6Pt/Ga/BEA(c), while a distinct PtMPt peak
appears in those of 2.8Pt/BEA(c) (Fig. 1) and
2.8Pt/Ga/BEA(c) (Fig. 6). The behavior of Pt in
the calcination process seems to be dependent on
the content of Pt in the samples.

The eﬀect of gallium on the particle size of
platinum was carefully compared with the Pt/BEA
system. The addition of Ga to Pt/BEA caused the
size of the resulting Pt particles to be dramatically
decreased as detected by TEM (Fig. 9). Such a
decrease could be explained by the surface cover-
age of the platinum particles with Ga atoms, with
the possible presence of interstitial hydrogen that,
in turn, may prevent the sintering of Pt aggregates
into large particles. This may also reduce the
hydrogenation and hydrogenolysis activities of Pt
and makes Pt/Ga/zeolite less resistant to coke
deactivation.
These analyses provide an explanation for the
eﬀect of addition of Pt to Ga/zeolite in promoting
the dehydrogenation of alkanes to alkenes, with
little or no eﬀect on aromatization.
