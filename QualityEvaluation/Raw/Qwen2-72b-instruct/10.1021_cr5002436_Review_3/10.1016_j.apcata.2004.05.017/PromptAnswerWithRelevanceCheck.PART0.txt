1.The exploration of vanadium oxide-based catalysts as alternatives to Pt and CrOx for paraffin dehydrogenation has been driven by the drawbacks of existing catalysts and the potential advantages of vanadium species. Research in this area has evolved since the 1980s, with a focus on understanding the influence of variables such as carrier type, support surface area, and metal loading on the nature and behavior of vanadium species. Carrier type significantly affects the physicochemical nature of VOx species, with different supports leading to various vanadium species such as monomeric or dimeric vanadates, VOx chains, vanadia overlayers, or V2O5 crystallites. Support surface area and metal loading also play crucial roles, with higher loadings potentially leading to the formation of V2O5 crystallites or vanadia overlayers, which can impact the catalyst's activity and selectivity.

1.The exploration of vanadium oxide-based catalysts as alternatives to Pt and CrOx for paraffin dehydrogenation has been driven by the drawbacks of existing catalysts and the potential advantages of vanadium species. Since the 1980s, research in this area has evolved to focus on understanding the influence of variables such as carrier type, support surface area, and metal loading on the nature and behavior of vanadium species. The nature of the oxide carrier is a key variable in controlling the performance of VOx catalysts, with the support affecting the physicochemical nature of VOx species. The type of support, such as USY zeolite or alumina, leads to different vanadium species, which in turn affects the catalytic activity and selectivity. The surface area of the support can also impact the dispersion of vanadium species, with larger surface areas potentially leading to better dispersion. Metal loading is another critical factor, as it can influence the formation of vanadia overlayers or crystallites, which can affect the catalytic properties of the catalyst.

1.The exploration of vanadium oxide-based catalysts as alternatives to Pt and CrOx for paraffin dehydrogenation has been driven by the drawbacks of existing catalysts, such as high temperatures and pressures required for significant alkene yields, and the potential for thermal cracking and coke formation. Research in this area has evolved since the 1980s, with a focus on understanding the influence of variables such as carrier type, support surface area, and metal loading on the nature and behavior of vanadium species. Carrier type has been shown to significantly affect the physicochemical nature of VOx species, with different supports leading to the formation of monomeric or dimeric vanadates, VOx chains, vanadia overlayers, or V2O5 crystallites. Support surface area can influence the dispersion and coverage of vanadium species, with larger surface areas potentially leading to more dispersed species. Metal loading can impact the acidity of the catalyst, with higher loadings potentially leading to increased acidity and the formation of V2O5 crystallites, which can block zeolite windows and supercages, reducing accessibility and promoting coke formation.
