1.The exploration of vanadium oxide-based catalysts as alternatives to Pt and CrOx for paraffin dehydrogenation has been driven by the drawbacks of existing catalysts and the potential advantages of vanadium species. Research in this area has evolved since the 1980s, with a focus on understanding the influence of variables such as carrier type, support surface area, and metal loading on the nature and behavior of vanadium species. Carrier type significantly affects the physicochemical nature of VOx species, with different supports leading to various vanadium species such as monomeric or dimeric vanadates, VOx chains, vanadia overlayers, or V2O5 crystallites. Support surface area and metal loading also play crucial roles, with higher loadings potentially leading to the formation of V2O5 crystallites or vanadia overlayers, which can impact the catalyst's activity and selectivity.
