1.The exploration of vanadium oxide-based catalysts as alternatives to Pt and CrOx for paraffin dehydrogenation has been driven by the drawbacks of existing catalysts and the potential advantages of vanadium-based systems. Since the 1980s, research in this area has evolved to focus on understanding the influence of variables such as carrier type, support surface area, and metal loading on the nature and behavior of vanadium species. Carrier type and support surface area have been shown to significantly affect the dispersion and redox properties of vanadium species, which in turn influence the catalytic activity and selectivity. Metal loading can also impact the formation of vanadium species, with higher loadings potentially leading to the formation of vanadia overlayers or crystallites, which may alter the catalytic performance.

1.探索将钒氧化物基催化剂作为Pt和CrOx的替代品用于石蜡脱氢，是由现有催化剂的缺点和钒基系统的潜在优势推动的。自20世纪80年代以来，该领域的研究已经发展到关注载体类型、支撑表面积和金属负载量等变量对钒物种性质和行为的影响。载体类型和支撑表面积被证明对钒物种的分散和氧化还原性质有显著影响，这反过来又影响催化活性和选择性。金属负载量也会影响钒物种的形成，更高的负载量可能导致钒氧化物覆盖层或结晶体的形成，这可能改变催化性能。
