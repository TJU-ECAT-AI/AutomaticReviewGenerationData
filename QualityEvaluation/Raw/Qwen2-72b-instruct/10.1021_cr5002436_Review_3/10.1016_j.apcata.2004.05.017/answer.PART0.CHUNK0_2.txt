1.The exploration of vanadium oxide-based catalysts as alternatives to Pt and CrOx for paraffin dehydrogenation has been driven by the drawbacks of existing catalysts and the potential advantages of vanadium species. Since the 1980s, research in this area has evolved to focus on understanding the influence of variables such as carrier type, support surface area, and metal loading on the nature and behavior of vanadium species. The nature of the oxide carrier is a key variable in controlling the performance of VOx catalysts, with the support affecting the physicochemical nature of VOx species. The type of support, such as USY zeolite or alumina, leads to different vanadium species, which in turn affects the catalytic activity and selectivity. The surface area of the support can also impact the dispersion of vanadium species, with larger surface areas potentially leading to better dispersion. Metal loading is another critical factor, as it can influence the formation of vanadia overlayers or crystallites, which can affect the catalytic properties of the catalyst.

1.探索将钒氧化物基催化剂作为Pt和CrOx的替代品用于石蜡脱氢,是由现有催化剂的缺点和钒物种的潜在优势推动的。自20世纪80年代以来,该领域的研究已经发展到关注载体类型、支撑表面面积和金属负载量等变量对钒物种性质和行为的影响。氧化物载体的性质是控制VOx催化剂性能的关键变量,支撑物会影响VOx物种的物理化学性质。支撑物的类型,如USY沸石或氧化铝,会导致不同的钒物种,这反过来会影响催化活性和选择性。支撑物的表面积也会影响钒物种的分散,较大的表面积可能带来更好的分散。金属负载量是另一个关键因素,因为它可以影响钒化物覆盖层或结晶体的形成,这会影响催化剂的催化性能。
