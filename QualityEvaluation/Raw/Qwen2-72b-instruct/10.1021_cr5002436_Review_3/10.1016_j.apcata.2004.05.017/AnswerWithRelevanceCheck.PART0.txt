          The exploration of vanadium oxide-based catalysts as alternatives to Pt and CrOx for paraffin dehydrogenation has been driven by the drawbacks of existing catalysts and the potential advantages of vanadium species. Research in this area has evolved since the 1980s, focusing on understanding the influence of variables such as carrier type, support surface area, and metal loading on the nature and behavior of vanadium species. Carrier type significantly affects the physicochemical nature of VOx species, leading to various vanadium species such as monomeric or dimeric vanadates, VOx chains, vanadia overlayers, or V2O5 crystallites. Support surface area and metal loading also play crucial roles, impacting the dispersion, redox properties, and formation of vanadium species, which in turn influence the catalytic activity, selectivity, and performance of the catalyst.

          探索将钒氧化物基催化剂作为Pt和CrOx的替代品用于石蜡脱氢，是由现有催化剂的缺点和钒物种的潜在优势推动的。自1980年代以来，该领域的研究已经发展，重点是理解载体类型、支撑表面面积和金属负载等变量对钒物种的性质和行为的影响。载体类型对VOx物种的物理化学性质有重大影响，不同的支撑物会导致各种钒物种的形成，如单体或二聚体钒酸盐、VOx链、钒氧化层或V2O5结晶体。支撑表面面积和金属负载也起着关键作用，影响钒物种的分散、氧化还原性质和形成，这反过来又影响催化活性、选择性和性能。
