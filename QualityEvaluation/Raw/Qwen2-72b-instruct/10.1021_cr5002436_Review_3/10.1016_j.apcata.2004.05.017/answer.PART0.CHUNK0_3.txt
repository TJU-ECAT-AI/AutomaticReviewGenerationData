1.The exploration of vanadium oxide-based catalysts as alternatives to Pt and CrOx for paraffin dehydrogenation has been driven by the drawbacks of existing catalysts, such as high temperatures and pressures required for significant alkene yields, and the potential for thermal cracking and coke formation. Research in this area has evolved since the 1980s, with a focus on understanding the influence of variables such as carrier type, support surface area, and metal loading on the nature and behavior of vanadium species. Carrier type has been shown to significantly affect the physicochemical nature of VOx species, with different supports leading to the formation of monomeric or dimeric vanadates, VOx chains, vanadia overlayers, or V2O5 crystallites. Support surface area can influence the dispersion and coverage of vanadium species, with larger surface areas potentially leading to more dispersed species. Metal loading can impact the acidity of the catalyst, with higher loadings potentially leading to increased acidity and the formation of V2O5 crystallites, which can block zeolite windows and supercages, reducing accessibility and promoting coke formation.
