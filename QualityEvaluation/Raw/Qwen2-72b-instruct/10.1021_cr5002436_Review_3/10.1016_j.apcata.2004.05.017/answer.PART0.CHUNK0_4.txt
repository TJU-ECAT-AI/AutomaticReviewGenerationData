1.The exploration of vanadium oxide-based catalysts as alternatives to Pt and CrOx for paraffin dehydrogenation has been driven by the drawbacks of existing catalysts and the potential advantages of vanadium species. Since the 1980s, research in this area has evolved to focus on understanding the influence of variables such as carrier type, support surface area, and metal loading on the nature and behavior of vanadium species. The nature of the oxide carrier is a key variable in controlling the performance of VOx catalysts, with the support affecting the physicochemical nature of VOx species. The type of support, such as USY zeolite or alumina, leads to different vanadium species, including well-dispersed mono or dimeric vanadates, VOx chains, vanadia overlayers, or V2O5 crystallites. The support surface area and metal loading also influence the dispersion and activity of vanadium species, with higher loadings potentially leading to the formation of V2O5 crystallites or vanadia overlayers, which can affect the catalytic performance.

1.探索将钒氧化物基催化剂作为Pt和CrOx的替代品用于石蜡脱氢,是由现有催化剂的缺点和钒物种的潜在优势驱动的。自20世纪80年代以来,该领域的研究已经发展到关注载体类型、支撑表面面积和金属负载量等变量对钒物种性质和行为的影响。氧化载体的性质是控制VOx催化剂性能的关键变量,支撑物影响VOx物种的物理化学性质。支撑物的类型,如USY沸石或氧化铝,会导致不同的钒物种,包括分散良好的单体或二聚体钒酸盐、VOx链、钒氧化物覆盖层或V2O5晶体。支撑表面面积和金属负载量也会影响钒物种的分散和活性,较高的负载量可能会导致V2O5晶体或钒氧化物覆盖层的形成,这可能会影响催化性能。
