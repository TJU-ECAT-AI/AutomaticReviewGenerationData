1.The exploration of vanadium oxide-based catalysts as alternatives to Pt and CrOx for paraffin dehydrogenation has been driven by issues such as catalyst poisoning, the high cost of Pt, and environmental concerns associated with the use of Cr. Research in this area started in the 1980s, initially focusing on oxidative dehydrogenation using vanadium-magnesium mixed oxides. The nature of the vanadium present on the catalyst is influenced by the type of carrier, support surface area, metal loading, and the oxidation state of vanadium. Below the theoretical monolayer coverage, isolated vanadium species are present, while at intermediate surface coverage, polymeric species or sheets of vanadium oxide are favored. Above monolayer coverage, V2O5 crystallites become dominant. The surface area-to-metal loading ratio determines which species will form, with monomeric species predominantly present below 1.2 V/nm2, polymeric vanadium species prevailing between 1.2 and 4.4 V/nm2, and crystalline V2O5 species preponderating at even higher loadings.

1.探索钒氧化物基催化剂作为Pt和CrOx的替代品用于石蜡脱氢，是由催化剂中毒、Pt的高成本以及Cr使用相关的环境问题等因素推动的。自20世纪80年代开始，该领域的研究最初关注的是使用钒-镁混合氧化物进行氧化脱氢。催化剂上钒的存在形式在很大程度上受载体类型、支撑表面面积、金属负载量和钒的氧化态的影响。在理论单层覆盖度以下，存在孤立的钒物种，而在中间表面覆盖度下，优先形成聚合钒物种或钒氧化物片层。在单层覆盖度以上，V2O5晶体成为主导。表面面积与金属负载比决定了将形成哪种物种，Wu等人报告称，在1.2 V/nm2以下，主要存在单体物种，在1.2至4.4 V/nm2之间，聚合钒物种占主导，在更高负载下，结晶V2O5物种占优势。
