1.The exploration of vanadium oxide-based catalysts as alternatives to Pt and CrOx for paraffin dehydrogenation has been driven by issues such as catalyst poisoning, the high cost of Pt, and environmental concerns associated with the use of Cr. Research in this area has evolved since the 1980s, initially focusing on oxidative dehydrogenation using vanadium-magnesium mixed oxides. The nature of vanadium species in these catalysts is influenced by factors such as carrier type, support surface area, and metal loading. Below the theoretical monolayer coverage, isolated vanadium species are present, while at intermediate surface coverage, polymeric species or sheets of vanadium oxide are favored. Above monolayer coverage, V2O5 crystallites become dominant. The surface area-to-metal loading ratio determines which species will form, with hydroxyl groups on the support surface serving as anchoring sites for vanadium precursors, while acid sites are detrimental to catalyst performance due to their facilitation of cracking and coke formation.

1.探索钒氧化物基催化剂作为Pt和CrOx的替代品用于石蜡脱氢，是由催化剂中毒、铂的高成本以及使用Cr的环境问题等因素推动的。自1980年代以来，该领域的研究已经发展，最初的重点是使用钒-镁混合氧化物进行氧化脱氢。钒物种在这些催化剂中的性质受到载体类型、支撑表面面积和金属负载等因素的影响。在低于理论单层覆盖度的情况下，存在孤立的钒物种，而在中间表面覆盖度下，优先形成聚合物种或钒氧化物片层。在超过单层覆盖度的情况下，V2O5晶体会占主导地位。表面面积与金属负载的比率决定了将形成哪种物种，支撑表面的羟基作为钒前体的锚定位点，而酸性位点由于促进裂解和焦炭形成，对催化剂性能有害。
