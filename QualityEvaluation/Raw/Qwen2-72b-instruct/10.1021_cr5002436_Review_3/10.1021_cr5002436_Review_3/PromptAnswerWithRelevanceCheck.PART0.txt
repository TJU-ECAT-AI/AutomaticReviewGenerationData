What factors have driven the exploration of vanadium oxide-based catalysts as alternatives to Pt and CrOx for paraffin dehydrogenation, how has research in this area evolved since the 1980s, and how do variables such as carrier type, support surface area, and metal loading influence the nature and behavior of vanadium species in these catalysts?

[1] "Despite the excellent performance of Pt and CrOx catalysts in paraffin dehydrogenation, a number of issues including catalyst poisoning, the high cost of Pt, and environmental concerns associated with the use of Cr have spurred the search for alternatives."
[2] "Vanadium oxides are known to be active for many hydrocarbon oxidation reactions, including dehydrogenation."
[3] "Research on vanadium-based dehydrogenation catalysts started in the 1980s, although at that time the focus was on oxidative dehydrogenation using vanadiummagnesium mixed oxides."
[4] "The nature of the vanadium present on the catalyst depends to a large extent on the type of carrier, the support surface area, the metal loading, and the oxidation state of vanadium."
[5] "Far below the theoretical monolayer coverage isolated vanadium species are present, at intermediate surface coverage polymeric species or sheets of vanadium oxide are favored, and above monolayer coverage V2O5 crystallites become dominant."
[6] "The surface area-to-metal loading ratio determines which species will form."
[7] "On the one hand, the presence of hydroxyl groups on the surface of the support is important to obtain a well-dispersed catalyst, as OH groups serve as anchoring sites for the vanadium precursors used to prepare these catalysts."
[8] "On the other hand, acid sites are detrimental for catalyst performance, because they facilitate cracking and induce coke formation."

1.探索钒氧化物基催化剂作为Pt和CrOx的替代品用于石蜡脱氢，是由催化剂中毒、铂的高成本以及使用Cr的环境问题等因素推动的。自1980年代以来，该领域的研究已经发展，最初的重点是使用钒-镁混合氧化物进行氧化脱氢。钒物种在这些催化剂中的性质受到载体类型、支撑表面面积和金属负载等因素的影响。在低于理论单层覆盖度的情况下，存在孤立的钒物种，而在中间表面覆盖度下，优先形成聚合物种或钒氧化物片层。在超过单层覆盖度的情况下，V2O5晶体会占主导地位。表面面积与金属负载的比率决定了将形成哪种物种，支撑表面的羟基作为钒前体的锚定位点，而酸性位点由于促进裂解和焦炭形成，对催化剂性能有害。
