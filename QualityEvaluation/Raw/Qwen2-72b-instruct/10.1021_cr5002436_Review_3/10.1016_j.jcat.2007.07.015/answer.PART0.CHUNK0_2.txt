1.The exploration of vanadium oxide-based catalysts as alternatives to Pt and CrOx for paraffin dehydrogenation has been driven by the need to mitigate against the severe catalyst deactivation observed in industrial chemical processes using chromia- or platinum-based catalysts. Research in this area has evolved since the 1980s, with numerous studies on the improvement of existing catalysts and the development of vanadia-based dehydrogenation catalysts. Variables such as carrier type, support surface area, and metal loading influence the nature and behavior of vanadium species in these catalysts, with the structure of dispersed vanadia changing on exposure to water vapor and the redox properties of the vanadia catalysts being important for reactions.
