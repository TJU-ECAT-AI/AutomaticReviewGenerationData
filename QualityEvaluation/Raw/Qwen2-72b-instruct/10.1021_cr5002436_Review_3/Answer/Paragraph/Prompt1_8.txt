{"DOC": "Vanadium oxide-based catalysts, notably VOx/MCM-41 with highly dispersed VOx species, have shown stable catalytic performance in dehydrogenation (DH) and regeneration cycles, outperforming industrially relevant CrOx/MCM-41 and PtSn/Al2O3 catalysts. This stability is attributed to VOx species' resistance to agglomeration. Research since the 1980s has explored VOx-based catalysts for DH, focusing on factors governing catalyst stability, the role of pristine supports and carbon deposits in propene production, and reactor operation optimization. The highest spacetime yield of propene was only 25% lower than that over PtSn/Al2O3 under the same conditions. Deactivation is related to propene-derived carbon deposits covering active VOx sites, with deposits on bare support sites also participating in propane dehydrogenation but with significantly lower activity. Acidic properties of the support are crucial for generating catalytically active carbon species. Catalysts based on Siral supports with 10 and 1 wt.% of SiO2 achieved the highest spacetime yields, approaching values measured on PtSn/Al2O3 and being twice as high as VOx/MCM-41 with similar vanadium loading. Most catalysts showed excellent ability to restore initial activity after DH/oxidative regeneration cycles. The optimal DH cycle duration without significant propene yield loss was 6 h, as carbon deposits initially form on support sites not carrying VOx and are active in propane dehydrogenation. Catalysts' tendency to form coke increases with surface acidity.", "Doi": "10.1039/c3cy01083j"},

Research since the 1980s has revealed that the structure of supported vanadia catalysts under redox conditions is crucial for catalytic performance. Techniques like Raman spectroscopy, using multiple excitation wavelengths, have provided detailed structural information of vanadium oxide species. The nature of vanadium species is influenced by variables such as carrier type, support surface area, and metal loading. Isolated VOx species dominate at low surface densities, polyvanadates coexist with monovanadates at intermediate densities, and V2O5 forms at high densities. The weight loss at the reduction step increases with vanadia loading, and the rate of catalyst re-oxidation is greater for higher vanadium loading catalysts. Supported VOx catalysts are highly active and selective for dehydrogenation and oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes. The initial dehydrogenation activity increases with surface VOx density, but activity decreases significantly with prolonged reaction time for samples with densities higher than 1.2 V/nm2 due to surface coke formation. Catalysts with surface VOx density no higher than 1.2 V/nm2 maintain stable activity. At higher butane pressures, catalysts with higher V/nm2 densities show enhanced activity. The structure of VOx species can be restored by oxidation of coke deposits up to 873 K, but only high-loaded samples are fully restored.

{"DOC": "Vanadium oxide-based catalysts, notably VOx/MCM-41 with isolated VOx species, have shown stable performance in dehydrogenation (DH) and regeneration cycles, outperforming PtSn/Al2O3 and CrOx/MCM-41. This stability is attributed to VOx species' resistance to agglomeration. Research since the 1980s has focused on VOx catalysts for their potential in paraffin dehydrogenation. Commercial Al2O3SiO2, pure Al2O3, and SiO2 were selected as supports to avoid crystalline V2O5 formation. The highest spacetime yield of propene was only 25% lower than that of PtSn/Al2O3. Deactivation is caused by propene-derived carbon deposits covering VOx sites, but these deposits on bare support sites can also participate in propane dehydrogenation, albeit less effectively. Acidic support properties are crucial for generating catalytically active carbon species. Catalysts based on Siral supports with 10 and 1 wt.% SiO2 achieved high propene yields, approaching PtSn/Al2O3 values. Most catalysts could restore initial activity after 10 DH/oxidative regeneration cycles. The optimal DH cycle duration without significant propene yield loss was 6 hours. Catalysts start to deactivate when VOx species become coke-covered, and this tendency increases with surface acidity.", "Doi": "10.1039/c3cy01083j"},
{"DOC": "The exploration of vanadium oxide-based catalysts as alternatives to Pt and CrOx for paraffin dehydrogenation has been driven by their rich chemistry, evolving significantly since the 1980s. Techniques like TPR and Raman spectroscopy have advanced understanding of vanadium species in these catalysts. The nature and behavior of vanadium species are influenced by carrier type, support surface area, and metal loading. Isolated VOx species dominate at low surface densities, polyvanadates coexist with monovanadates at intermediate densities, and V2O5 forms at high densities. The weight loss at the reduction step increases with vanadia loading, and the rate of catalyst re-oxidation is greater for higher vanadium loading catalysts. Supported VOx catalysts show good catalytic performance in both oxidation and reduction reactions, being among the most active and selective for dehydrogenation and oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes. The initial dehydrogenation activity increases with surface VOx density, but decreases significantly with prolonged reaction time for samples with densities higher than 1.2 V/nm2 due to coke formation. Catalysts with surface VOx density no higher than 1.2 V/nm2 maintain nearly unchanged dehydrogenation activity. At higher butane pressures, catalysts with higher V/nm2 densities show enhanced activity. The structure of VOx species can be restored by oxidation of coke deposits up to 873 K, but only high-loaded samples are fully restored. After regeneration, the surface area of an 8%V catalyst was reduced by 50%, indicating transformations in the nature of the support.", "Doi": "10.1002/9783527626113.ch15"},

{"DOC": "Vanadium oxide-based catalysts, notably VOx/MCM-41 with highly dispersed VOx species, have shown stable catalytic performance in dehydrogenation (DH) and regeneration cycles, outperforming industrially relevant CrOx/MCM-41 and PtSn/Al2O3 catalysts. This stability is attributed to VOx species' resistance to agglomeration. Research since the 1980s has explored these catalysts as alternatives, driven by their potential for similar selectivity and stable performance. The current work investigates VOx-based catalysts for DH using commercial Al2O3SiO2, pure Al2O3, and SiO2 supports. The highest spacetime yield of propene is only 25% lower than that of PtSn/Al2O3 under the same conditions. Deactivation is linked to propene-derived carbon deposits covering active VOx sites, but such deposits on bare support sites can also participate in propane dehydrogenation, albeit with lower activity. Support acidity is crucial for generating catalytically active carbon species. The best spacetime yields were achieved with Siral supports containing 10 and 1 wt.% SiO2, approaching PtSn/Al2O3 values and being twice as high as VOx/MCM-41 with similar vanadium loading. Most catalysts, except for the one with 70 wt.% SiO2, can restore initial activity after 10 DH/oxidative regeneration cycles. The optimal DH cycle duration without significant propene yield loss is 6 h, as carbon deposits initially form on support sites not carrying VOx, which are active in propane dehydrogenation. However, the catalysts start to deactivate when VOx species also become coke-covered. The tendency to form coke increases with surface acidity.", "Doi": "10.1039/c3cy01083j"},
