{"DOC": "Vanadium oxide-based catalysts, notably VOx/MCM-41 with highly dispersed VOx species, have shown stable catalytic performance in dehydrogenation (DH) and regeneration cycles, outperforming industrially relevant CrOx/MCM-41 and PtSn/Al2O3. This stability is attributed to VOx species' resistance to agglomeration. Research since the 1980s has focused on VOx-based catalysts for DH, with recent work exploring commercial Al2O3SiO2, pure Al2O3, and SiO2 supports. The highest spacetime yield of propene is only 25% lower than that of PtSn/Al2O3 under similar conditions. Deactivation is linked to propene-derived carbon deposits covering active VOx sites, with deposits on bare support sites also participating in propane dehydrogenation, albeit less effectively. Acidic support properties are crucial for generating catalytically active carbon species. Catalysts based on Siral supports with 10 and 1 wt.% SiO2 showed spacetime yields approaching those of PtSn/Al2O3, being twice as high as VOx/MCM-41. Most catalysts, except those with 70 wt.% SiO2, restored initial activity after 10 DH/oxidative regeneration cycles. The optimal DH cycle duration for Siral-based catalysts is 6 hours, as carbon deposits initially form on non-VOx sites and become active in propane dehydrogenation. Catalysts start to deactivate when VOx species are also covered by coke, with coke formation increasing with surface acidity.", "Doi": "10.1039/c3cy01083j"},
{"DOC": "The exploration of vanadium oxide-based catalysts as alternatives for paraffin dehydrogenation has been driven by their complex chemistry, evolving significantly since the 1980s. Techniques like TPR and Raman spectroscopy have advanced understanding of vanadium species in these catalysts. The nature of vanadium species is influenced by carrier type, support surface area, and metal loading, with isolated VOx species dominating at low surface densities, polyvanadates coexisting at intermediate densities, and V2O5 forming at high densities. The weight loss at the reduction step increases with vanadia loading, and higher vanadium loading catalysts re-oxidize faster. Supported VOx catalysts are highly active and selective for dehydrogenation and oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes. The initial dehydrogenation activity increases with surface VOx density, but activity decreases significantly for samples with densities higher than 1.2 V/nm2 due to surface coke formation. Catalysts with densities no higher than 1.2 V/nm2 maintain stable activity. At higher pressures, catalysts with higher V/nm2 densities show enhanced activity. The structure of VOx species can be restored by oxidation of coke deposits up to 873 K, but only high-loaded samples are fully restored.

Catalysts based on Siral supports with 10 and 1 wt.% SiO2 achieved high propene yields, approaching PtSn/Al2O3 values. Most catalysts could restore initial activity after 10 DH/oxidative regeneration cycles. The optimal DH cycle duration without significant propene yield loss was 6 hours. Carbon deposits initially form on non-VOx support sites, leading to deactivation when VOx species also become covered.

{"DOC": "The exploration of vanadium oxide-based catalysts as alternatives to Pt and CrOx for paraffin dehydrogenation has been driven by their rich chemistry, with research evolving since the 1980s. Techniques like TPR and Raman spectroscopy, especially using multiple excitation wavelengths, have provided insights into the structure of supported vanadia catalysts. The nature of vanadium species is influenced by variables such as carrier type, support surface area, and metal loading. Isolated VOx species dominate at low surface densities, polyvanadates coexist with monovanadates at intermediate densities, and V2O5 forms at high densities. The weight loss at the reduction step increases with vanadia loading, and the rate of catalyst re-oxidation is greater for higher vanadium loading catalysts. Supported VOx catalysts show good catalytic performance in both oxidation and reduction reactions, being among the most active for dehydrogenation and oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes. The initial dehydrogenation activity increases with surface VOx density, but decreases significantly with prolonged reaction time for samples with densities higher than 1.2 V/nm2 due to coke formation. Catalysts with surface VOx density no higher than 1.2 V/nm2 maintain nearly unchanged dehydrogenation activity. At higher butane pressures, catalysts with higher V/nm2 densities show enhanced activity. The structure of VOx species can be restored by oxidation of coke deposits up to 873 K, as indicated by Raman spectroscopy and confirmed by 51V MAS NMR. After regeneration, the surface area of an 8%V catalyst was reduced by 50%, attributed to transformations in the nature of the support.", "Doi": "10.1002/9783527626113.ch15"},

{"DOC": "Vanadium oxide-based catalysts, notably VOx/MCM-41 with isolated VOx species, have shown stable performance in dehydrogenation (DH) and regeneration cycles, outperforming CrOx/MCM-41 and PtSn/Al2O3. This stability is attributed to VOx species' resistance to agglomeration. Research since the 1980s has focused on VOx catalysts for their potential in paraffin dehydrogenation. The highest spacetime yield of propene is only 25% lower than that of PtSn/Al2O3. Deactivation is caused by propene-derived carbon deposits covering VOx sites, but these deposits can also participate in propane dehydrogenation with lower activity. Acidic support properties are crucial for generating catalytically active carbon species. Siral-based catalysts with 10 and 1 wt.% SiO2 achieved high propene yields, approaching those of PtSn/Al2O3.
