{"DOC": "Vanadium oxide-based catalysts, notably VOx/MCM-41 with highly dispersed VOx species, have demonstrated stable catalytic performance in dehydrogenation (DH) and regeneration cycles, outperforming industrially relevant CrOx/MCM-41 and PtSn/Al2O3 catalysts. This stability is attributed to VOx species' resistance to agglomeration. Since the 1980s, research has focused on VOx-based catalysts for their potential to match selectivity and performance. Recent work explores VOx catalysts using Al2O3SiO2, Al2O3, and SiO2 supports, achieving propene spacetime yields only 25% lower than PtSn/Al2O3 under similar conditions. Deactivation is linked to propene-derived carbon deposits covering active VOx sites, but these deposits can also participate in propane dehydrogenation with lower activity. Acidic support properties are crucial for generating catalytically active carbon species. Catalysts based on Siral supports with 10 and 1 wt.% SiO2 showed spacetime yields approaching those of PtSn/Al2O3, twice as high as VOx/MCM-41 with similar vanadium loading. Most catalysts restored initial activity after 10 DH/oxidative regeneration cycles. The optimal DH cycle duration for Siral-based catalysts is 6 hours, as carbon deposits initially form on non-VOx support sites, which are active in propane dehydrogenation. However, when VOx species also become covered by coke, the catalysts start to deactivate, with the tendency to form coke increasing with surface acidity.", "Doi": "10.1039/c3cy01083j"},

Techniques like Raman spectroscopy, using multiple excitation wavelengths, have provided deeper insights into the structure of supported vanadia catalysts. The nature of vanadium species is influenced by carrier type, support surface area, and metal loading, with isolated VOx species dominating at low surface densities, polyvanadates coexisting with monovanadates at intermediate densities, and V2O5 forming at high densities. The weight loss at the reduction step increases with vanadia loading, and the rate of catalyst re-oxidation is higher for higher vanadium loading catalysts. Supported VOx catalysts are highly active and selective for dehydrogenation and oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes. The initial dehydrogenation activity increases with surface VOx density, but decreases significantly with prolonged reaction time for samples with densities higher than 1.2 V/nm2 due to coke formation. Catalysts with surface VOx density no higher than 1.2 V/nm2 maintain stable activity. At higher butane pressures, catalysts with higher V/nm2 densities show enhanced activity. The structure of VOx species can be restored by oxidation of coke deposits up to 873 K, but only high-loaded samples are fully restored, as indicated by UV-Vis DRS. 51V MAS NMR confirms the re-oxidation of reduced vanadium species.

Supported VOx catalysts are highly active and selective for dehydrogenation and oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes. The initial dehydrogenation activity increases with surface VOx density, but prolonged reaction time leads to activity decrease for densities above 1.2 V/nm2 due to coke formation and site blocking. Catalysts with densities no higher than 1.2 V/nm2 maintain stable activity. At higher pressures, catalysts with higher densities show enhanced activity. Regeneration via oxidation can restore the structure of VOx species up to 873 K, but only high-loaded samples are fully restored. After regeneration, the surface area of an 8%V catalyst was reduced by 50%, indicating transformations in the support's nature.", "Doi": "10.1002/9783527626113.ch15"},

{"DOC": "Vanadium oxide-based catalysts, notably VOx/MCM-41 with dispersed VOx species, have shown stable dehydrogenation (DH) performance, outperforming PtSn/Al2O3 and CrOx/MCM-41. Research since the 1980s has focused on their potential for similar selectivity and stability. Catalysts prepared with Al2O3SiO2, Al2O3, and SiO2 supports have achieved propene yields close to industrial standards. Deactivation is linked to carbon deposits on VOx sites, with deposits on bare support sites also participating in propane dehydrogenation but with lower activity. Support acidity is critical for catalytically active carbon species. Siral-based catalysts with 10 and 1 wt.% SiO2 showed high propene yields, approaching PtSn/Al2O3 values. Most catalysts effectively restored initial activity after DH/oxidative regeneration cycles. The optimal DH cycle duration for Siral-based catalysts is 6 hours, as carbon deposits initially form on non-VOx sites, leading to deactivation when VOx species are also covered. Catalysts' tendency to form coke rises with surface acidity.", "Doi": "10.1039/c3cy01083j"},
{"DOC": "The exploration of vanadium oxide-based catalysts for paraffin dehydrogenation has evolved since the 1980s, driven by the complex chemistry of these materials. Research has advanced understanding of vanadium species behavior, influenced by variables such as surface density, carrier type, and metal loading. Isolated VOx species dominate at densities below 1 V/nm2, polyvanadates coexist with monovanadates between 1.2 and 4.4 V/nm2, and V2O5 forms at densities higher than 4.4 V/nm2. The weight loss at the reduction step increases with vanadia loading, and the rate of catalyst re-oxidation is greater for higher vanadium loading catalysts. Supported VOx catalysts show good catalytic performance in both oxidation and reduction reactions, being among the most active and selective for dehydrogenation and oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes. The use of multiple excitation wavelengths in Raman spectroscopy has allowed for more complete structural information of supported metal oxides. The initial dehydrogenation activity increases with surface VOx density, but decreases significantly with prolonged reaction time for samples with densities higher than 1.2 V/nm2 due to coke formation. Catalysts with surface VOx density no higher than 1.2 V/nm2 maintain nearly unchanged dehydrogenation activity. The structure of supported vanadia catalysts under redox conditions is directly related to catalytic performance. The possibility of using oxide systems other than chromia is being explored. Deactivation of VOx catalysts by coke species is observed, and the structure of supported VOx species under dehydrogenation conditions is unclear.
