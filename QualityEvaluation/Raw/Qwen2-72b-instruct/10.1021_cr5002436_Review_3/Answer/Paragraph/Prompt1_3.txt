{"DOC": "Vanadium oxide-based catalysts, notably VOx/MCM-41 with isolated VOx species, have shown stable catalytic performance in dehydrogenation (DH) and regeneration cycles, outperforming industrially relevant CrOx/MCM-41 and PtSn/Al2O3. This stability is attributed to VOx species' resistance to agglomeration. Research since the 1980s has focused on VOx-based catalysts for DH, selecting supports like Al2O3SiO2 to avoid crystalline V2O5. The highest spacetime yield of propene is only 25% lower than PtSn/Al2O3 under similar conditions. Deactivation is linked to carbon deposits covering VOx sites, but these deposits can also participate in propane dehydrogenation with lower activity. Acidic support properties are crucial for generating active carbon species. Catalysts based on Siral supports with 10 and 1 wt.% SiO2 achieve high propene yields, approaching PtSn/Al2O3 values. Most catalysts can restore initial activity after 10 DH/oxidative regeneration cycles. The optimal DH cycle duration is 6 hours, as carbon deposits initially form on non-VOx sites, leading to deactivation when VOx sites are also covered. Catalysts' tendency to form coke increases with surface acidity.", "Doi": "10.1039/c3cy01083j"},

Research since the 1980s has revealed that the structure of supported vanadia catalysts under redox conditions is crucial for catalytic performance. Techniques like Raman spectroscopy, using multiple excitation wavelengths, have provided new insights into the structure of supported metal oxides. The nature of vanadium species is influenced by factors such as carrier type, support surface area, and metal loading. For instance, isolated VOx species dominate at low surface densities, while V2O5 forms at higher densities. The weight loss during reduction increases with vanadia loading, and higher loading catalysts re-oxidize faster. Supported VOx catalysts are highly active for dehydrogenation reactions. The initial dehydrogenation activity increases with surface VOx density, but prolonged reaction time leads to activity decrease due to coke formation on catalysts with densities above 1.2 V/nm2. Catalysts with lower densities maintain stable activity. At higher pressures, catalysts with higher densities show enhanced activity. Raman spectroscopy indicates that VOx species can be restored by oxidation of coke deposits up to 873 K, but only high-loaded samples are fully restored as indicated by UV-Vis DRS. After regeneration, the surface area of an 8%V catalyst was reduced by 50%, suggesting transformations in the support nature.", "Doi": "10.1002/9783527626113.ch15"},

Catalysts show good performance in dehydrogenation reactions, with activity initially increasing with VOx density but decreasing over time for densities above 1.2 V/nm2 due to coke formation. Enhanced activity is observed at higher butane pressures for catalysts with higher V/nm2 densities. Regeneration via oxidation can restore the VOx species structure up to 873 K, but only high-loaded samples are fully restored, as indicated by UV-Vis DRS. 51V MAS NMR confirms the re-oxidation of reduced vanadium species. The transformation of the support is observed after regeneration, affecting the catalyst's surface area.", "Doi": "10.1002/9783527626113.ch15"},

{"DOC": "Vanadium oxide-based catalysts, notably VOx/MCM-41 with dispersed VOx species, have shown stable dehydrogenation (DH) and regeneration performance, outperforming PtSn/Al2O3 and CrOx/MCM-41. This stability is attributed to VOx species' resistance to agglomeration. Research since the 1980s has explored VOx catalysts for their potential in DH reactions, using supports like Al2O3SiO2, Al2O3, and SiO2. The highest spacetime yield of propene was only 25% lower than that of PtSn/Al2O3, achieved over Siral supports with 10 and 1 wt.% SiO2. Deactivation is linked to carbon deposits covering VOx sites, but these deposits can also participate in propane dehydrogenation with lower activity. Support acidity is crucial for generating catalytically active carbon species. Most catalysts, except those with 70 wt.% SiO2, can restore initial activity after 10 DH/oxidative regeneration cycles. The optimal DH cycle duration is 6 hours for Siral-based catalysts, as carbon initially forms on non-VOx sites, leading to deactivation when VOx sites also become coke-covered. Catalysts with higher surface acidity tend to form more coke.", "Doi": "10.1039/c3cy01083j"},
{"DOC": "The exploration of vanadium oxide-based catalysts for paraffin dehydrogenation has been driven by their complex chemistry, evolving since the 1980s with advances in understanding vanadium species behavior. Techniques like Raman spectroscopy, using multiple excitation wavelengths, have provided detailed structural insights. The nature of vanadium species is influenced by carrier type, support surface area, and metal loading, with isolated VOx species dominating at low surface densities, polyvanadates coexisting with monovanadates at intermediate densities, and V2O5 forming at high densities. Catalyst re-oxidation rates increase with vanadium loading, and the structure of VOx species can be restored by oxidizing coke deposits up to 873 K. Supported VOx catalysts exhibit good catalytic performance in oxidation and reduction reactions, being highly active and selective for dehydrogenation and oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes. The initial dehydrogenation activity increases with surface VOx density, but decreases significantly with prolonged reaction time for samples with densities higher than 1.2 V/nm2 due to coke formation and site blocking. Catalysts with densities no higher than 1.2 V/nm2 maintain stable activity, while those with higher densities show enhanced activity at higher butane pressures. Regeneration via oxidation restores the structure of VOx species, but high-loaded samples are not fully restored as indicated by UV-Vis DRS. 51V MAS NMR confirms the re-oxidation of reduced vanadium species.
