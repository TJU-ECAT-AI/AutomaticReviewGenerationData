{"DOC": "Research highlights VOx/MCM-41 catalysts with dispersed VOx species for stable dehydrogenation (DH) and regeneration cycles, outperforming PtSn/Al2O3 and CrOx/MCM-41. Since the 1980s, VOx-based catalysts have been explored for their potential in DH reactions, with recent studies focusing on Al2O3SiO2, Al2O3, and SiO2 supports to avoid V2O5 crystallization. Catalysts based on Siral supports with 10 and 1 wt.% SiO2 achieved propene yields close to PtSn/Al2O3, demonstrating significant improvement over VOx/MCM-41. Deactivation is linked to carbon deposits on VOx sites, though these can also catalyze propane dehydrogenation with lower activity. Acidic support properties are essential for active carbon species generation. Most catalysts, except those with 70 wt.% SiO2, regained initial activity after 10 DH/oxidative regeneration cycles. The optimal DH cycle duration for Siral-based catalysts is 6 hours, as carbon initially forms on non-VOx sites, leading to deactivation when VOx sites are also covered. Catalysts with higher surface acidity tend to form more coke.", "Doi": "10.1039/c3cy01083j"},

Techniques like TPR and Raman spectroscopy have advanced understanding of vanadium species in these catalysts. The nature and behavior of vanadium species are influenced by carrier type, support surface area, and metal loading. Isolated VOx species dominate at low surface densities, polyvanadates coexist with monovanadates at intermediate densities, and V2O5 forms at high densities. The weight loss at the reduction step increases with vanadia loading, and the rate of catalyst re-oxidation is greater for higher vanadium loading catalysts. Supported VOx catalysts show good catalytic performance in both oxidation and reduction reactions, being among the most active and selective for dehydrogenation and oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes. The initial dehydrogenation activity increases with surface VOx density, but decreases significantly with prolonged reaction time for samples with VOx density higher than 1.2 V/nm2 due to surface coke deposits and site blocking. Catalysts with surface VOx density no higher than 1.2 V/nm2 maintain nearly unchanged dehydrogenation activity. At higher butane pressures, catalysts with higher V/nm2 densities show enhanced activity. The structure of VOx species can be restored by oxidation of coke deposits up to 873 K, but only high-loaded samples are fully restored according to UV-Vis DRS. 51V MAS NMR confirms the re-oxidation of reduced vanadium species.

Acidic properties of the support are crucial for generating catalytically active carbon species. Catalysts based on Siral supports with 10 and 1 wt.% of SiO2 achieve high spacetime yields, approaching values measured on PtSn/Al2O3 and being twice as high as VOx/MCM-41 with similar vanadium loading. Most catalysts show excellent ability to restore initial activity after 10 DH/oxidative regeneration cycles. The optimal DH cycle duration without significant propene yield loss is 6 hours. Carbon deposits initially form on support sites not carrying VOx and are active in propane dehydrogenation. However, the catalysts start to deactivate when VOx species also become covered by coke, which increases with surface acidity.", "Doi": "10.1039/c3cy01083j"},
{"DOC": "The exploration of vanadium oxide-based catalysts for paraffin dehydrogenation, as alternatives to Pt and CrOx, has been driven by their complex chemistry and evolving research since the 1980s. Techniques like TPR and Raman spectroscopy have revealed the structure of vanadia species under reaction conditions, crucial for catalytic performance. The use of multiple excitation wavelengths in Raman spectroscopy has provided new insights into the structure of supported metal oxides. The nature of vanadium species is influenced by variables such as carrier type, support surface area, and metal loading, with isolated VOx species dominating at low surface densities, polyvanadates coexisting with monovanadates at intermediate densities, and V2O5 forming at high densities. The weight loss at the reduction step increases with vanadia loading, and the rate of catalyst re-oxidation is greater for higher vanadium loading catalysts. Supported VOx catalysts show good catalytic performance in both oxidation and reduction reactions, being highly active and selective for dehydrogenation and oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes. The initial dehydrogenation activity increases with surface VOx density, but decreases significantly with prolonged reaction time for samples with densities higher than 1.2 V/nm2 due to surface coke formation. Catalysts with surface VOx density no higher than 1.2 V/nm2 maintain stable activity. The structure of VOx species can be restored by oxidation of coke deposits up to 873 K, as indicated by Raman spectroscopy, although UV-Vis DRS suggests only high-loaded samples are fully restored. 51V MAS NMR confirms the re-oxidation of reduced vanadium species. After regeneration, the surface area of an 8%V catalyst was reduced by 50%, indicating transformations in the nature of the support.", "Doi": "10.1002/9783527626113.ch15"},

{"DOC": "Vanadium oxide-based catalysts, notably VOx/MCM-41 with highly dispersed VOx species, have shown stable catalytic performance in dehydrogenation (DH) and regeneration cycles, outperforming industrially relevant CrOx/MCM-41 and PtSn/Al2O3 catalysts. This stability is attributed to VOx species' resistance to agglomeration. Research since the 1980s has focused on VOx-based catalysts for DH, using commercial Al2O3SiO2, pure Al2O3, and SiO2 as supports. The highest spacetime yield of propene was only 25% lower than that of PtSn/Al2O3 under the same conditions. Deactivation is linked to propene-derived carbon deposits covering active VOx sites, but such deposits on bare support sites can also participate in propane dehydrogenation, albeit with lower activity. Acidic properties of the support are crucial for generating catalytically active carbon species. Catalysts based on Siral supports with 10 and 1 wt.% of SiO2 achieved high spacetime yields of propene, approaching values measured on PtSn/Al2O3 and being twice as high as VOx/MCM-41 with similar vanadium loading.
