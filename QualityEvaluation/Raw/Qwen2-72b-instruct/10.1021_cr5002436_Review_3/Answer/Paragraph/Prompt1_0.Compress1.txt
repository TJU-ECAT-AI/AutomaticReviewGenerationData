{"DOC": "Vanadium oxide-based catalysts, notably VOx/MCM-41 with isolated VOx species, have shown stable catalytic performance in dehydrogenation (DH) and regeneration cycles, outperforming industrially relevant CrOx/MCM-41 and PtSn/Al2O3 catalysts. This stability is attributed to VOx species' resistance to agglomeration. Research since the 1980s has focused on VOx-based catalysts for DH, using supports like Al2O3SiO2, Al2O3, and SiO2 to avoid crystalline V2O5 particles. The highest spacetime yield of propene is only 25% lower than that of PtSn/Al2O3 under similar conditions. Deactivation is linked to carbon deposits covering active VOx sites, but these deposits can also participate in propane dehydrogenation, albeit less effectively. Acidic support properties are crucial for generating catalytically active carbon species. Siral supports with 10 and 1 wt.% SiO2 achieved high propene yields, approaching those of PtSn/Al2O3 and doubling those of VOx/MCM-41. Most catalysts, except for one with 70 wt.% SiO2, can restore initial activity after 10 DH/oxidative regeneration cycles. The optimal DH cycle duration without significant propene yield loss is 6 hours. Carbon deposits initially form on non-VOx support sites, which are active in propane dehydrogenation, but the catalyst deactivates when VOx species also become coke-covered. The tendency to form coke increases with surface acidity.", "Doi": "10.1039/c3cy01083j"},
{"DOC": "Vanadium oxide-based catalysts have been explored as alternatives to Pt and CrOx for paraffin dehydrogenation due to their rich chemistry, which remains not fully understood. Research since the 1980s has advanced our understanding of vanadium species in these catalysts, utilizing techniques like TPR and Raman spectroscopy with multiple excitation wavelengths for detailed structural insights. The nature of vanadium species is influenced by carrier type, support surface area, and metal loading, with isolated VOx species dominating at low surface densities, polyvanadates coexisting with monovanadates at intermediate densities, and V2O5 forming at higher densities. The weight loss at the reduction step increases with vanadia loading, and the rate of catalyst re-oxidation is greater for higher vanadium loading catalysts. Supported VOx catalysts exhibit good catalytic performance in both oxidation and reduction reactions, making them active and selective for dehydrogenation and oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes. The initial dehydrogenation activity increases with surface VOx density, but prolonged reaction time leads to decreased activity for samples with densities higher than 1.2 V/nm2 due to surface coke formation. Catalysts with surface VOx density no higher than 1.2 V/nm2 maintain nearly unchanged dehydrogenation activity. At higher butane pressures, catalysts with higher V/nm2 densities show enhanced activity. The structure of VOx species can be restored by oxidation of coke deposits up to 873 K, but only high-loaded samples are fully restored, as indicated by UV-Vis DRS. 51V MAS NMR confirms the re-oxidation of reduced vanadium species. After regeneration, the surface area of an 8%V catalyst was reduced by 50%, indicating transformations in the nature of the support.", "Doi": "10.1002/9783527626113.ch15"},

{"DOC": "The exploration of vanadium oxide-based catalysts as alternatives to Pt and CrOx for paraffin dehydrogenation has been driven by their rich chemistry, evolving since the 1980s. Techniques like Raman spectroscopy, using multiple excitation wavelengths, have provided insights into the structure of supported vanadia catalysts. The nature of vanadium species is influenced by carrier type, support surface area, and metal loading, with isolated VOx species dominating at low surface densities, polyvanadates coexisting with monovanadates at intermediate densities, and V2O5 forming at high densities. The weight loss at the reduction step increases with vanadia loading, and the rate of catalyst re-oxidation is greater for higher vanadium loading catalysts. Supported VOx catalysts show good catalytic performance in both oxidation and reduction reactions, being among the most active and selective for dehydrogenation and oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes. The initial dehydrogenation activity increases with surface VOx density, but decreases significantly with prolonged reaction time for samples with densities higher than 1.2 V/nm2 due to coke formation. Catalysts with surface VOx density no higher than 1.2 V/nm2 maintain activity. At higher butane pressures, catalysts with higher V/nm2 densities show enhanced activity. The structure of VOx species can be restored by oxidation of coke deposits up to 873 K, but only high-loaded samples are fully restored. 51V MAS NMR confirms the re-oxidation of reduced vanadium species.", "Doi": "10.1002/9783527626113.ch15"},

{"DOC": "Vanadium oxide-based catalysts, notably VOx/MCM-41 with dispersed VOx species, have shown stable dehydrogenation (DH) performance, outperforming PtSn/Al2O3 and CrOx/MCM-41. This stability is attributed to VOx species' resistance to agglomeration. Research since the 1980s has focused on VOx catalysts' potential for DH, with recent work exploring Al2O3SiO2, Al2O3, and SiO2 supports. The highest propene spacetime yield was 25% lower than PtSn/Al2O3. Deactivation is linked to carbon deposits on VOx sites, but these can also form on support sites, participating in propane dehydrogenation with lower activity. Acidic support properties are crucial for active carbon species. Siral supports with 10 and 1 wt.% SiO2 achieved high propene yields, approaching PtSn/Al2O3 values. Most catalysts can restore initial activity after DH/oxidative regeneration cycles. The optimal DH cycle duration is 6 h, as carbon initially forms on non-VOx sites, leading to deactivation when VOx sites are also covered. Catalysts' coke formation tendency increases with surface acidity.", "Doi": "10.1039/c3cy01083j"},
{"DOC": "The exploration of vanadium oxide-based catalysts as alternatives for paraffin dehydrogenation has been driven by their rich chemistry, evolving since the 1980s.

Catalyst performance is influenced by variables such as carrier type, support surface area, and metal loading. Supported VOx catalysts show good activity in dehydrogenation reactions, with initial activity increasing as a function of surface VOx density.

At higher pressures, catalysts with higher V/nm2 densities exhibit enhanced activity. The structure of VOx species can be restored by oxidation of coke deposits up to 873 K, as indicated by Raman spectroscopy.
