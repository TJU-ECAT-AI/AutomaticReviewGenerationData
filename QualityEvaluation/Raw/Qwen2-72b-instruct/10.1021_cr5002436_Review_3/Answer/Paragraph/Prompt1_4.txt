{"DOC": "Vanadium oxide-based catalysts, notably VOx/MCM-41 with dispersed VOx species, have shown stable catalytic performance in dehydrogenation (DH) and regeneration cycles, outperforming PtSn/Al2O3 and CrOx/MCM-41. This stability is attributed to VOx species' resistance to agglomeration. Research since the 1980s has focused on these catalysts' potential for DH, with recent work exploring Al2O3SiO2, Al2O3, and SiO2 supports to avoid crystalline V2O5. The highest spacetime yield of propene is only 25% lower than that of PtSn/Al2O3. Deactivation is linked to carbon deposits covering VOx sites, but these deposits on bare support sites can also participate in propane dehydrogenation, albeit less effectively. Support acidity is crucial for generating catalytically active carbon species. Siral-based catalysts with 10 and 1 wt.% SiO2 achieved high propene yields, approaching PtSn/Al2O3 values and twice that of VOx/MCM-41. Most catalysts can restore initial activity after 10 DH/oxidative regeneration cycles. The optimal DH cycle duration is 6 hours, as carbon deposits initially form on non-VOx sites, leading to deactivation when VOx sites also become covered. Catalysts' tendency to form coke increases with surface acidity.", "Doi": "10.1039/c3cy01083j"},

Research since the 1980s has revealed that the structure of supported vanadia catalysts under redox conditions is crucial for catalytic performance. Techniques like Raman spectroscopy, using multiple excitation wavelengths, have provided new insights into the structure of vanadia species. The nature of vanadium species is influenced by variables such as carrier type, support surface area, and metal loading. Isolated VOx species dominate at low surface densities, polyvanadates coexist with monovanadates at intermediate densities, and V2O5 forms at high densities. The weight loss during reduction increases with vanadia loading, and the rate of re-oxidation is higher for catalysts with higher vanadium loading. Supported VOx catalysts show good performance in dehydrogenation reactions, with activity increasing as a function of surface VOx density. However, prolonged reaction time leads to decreased activity for samples with VOx density higher than 1.2 V/nm2 due to coke formation. Catalysts with surface VOx density no higher than 1.2 V/nm2 maintain stable activity. The structure of VOx species can be restored by oxidation of coke deposits up to 873 K, as indicated by Raman spectroscopy. After regeneration, the surface area of high-loaded catalysts may be reduced, indicating transformations in the support nature.", "Doi": "10.1002/9783527626113.ch15"},

This stability is due to VOx species' resistance to agglomeration. Research since the 1980s has aimed to explore VOx-based catalysts further, focusing on factors governing stability, the role of pristine supports and carbon deposits, and optimizing reactor operation. VOx species' distribution on the surface of freshly calcined catalysts was studied using UV/Vis spectroscopy, revealing the importance of support type and surface area. The specific surface areas of calcined catalysts were lower than those of pristine supports, with the highest loss observed on VOx/S40 and VOx/S70. All catalysts deactivated over time due to propene-derived carbon deposits covering active VOx sites, but restored initial performance after oxidative regeneration. The highest spacetime yield of propene was only 25% lower than that over PtSn/Al2O3. The deactivation was related to carbon deposits formed on support sites not carrying VOx, which are active in propane dehydrogenation but with significantly lower activity than VOx species. Acidic properties of the support are crucial for generating catalytically active carbon species. Catalysts based on Siral supports with 10 and 1 wt.% of SiO2 showed the highest spacetime yields, approaching values measured on PtSn/Al2O3 and being two times higher than VOx/MCM-41 with similar vanadium loading.

Techniques like Raman spectroscopy, using multiple excitation wavelengths, have provided new insights into the structure of vanadium species. The nature of vanadium species is influenced by carrier type, support surface area, and metal loading, with isolated VOx species dominating at low surface densities, polyvanadates coexisting with monovanadates at intermediate densities, and V2O5 forming at high densities. The weight loss during reduction increases with vanadia loading, and higher vanadium loading catalysts re-oxidize faster. Supported VOx catalysts are highly active and selective for dehydrogenation reactions. The initial dehydrogenation activity increases with surface VOx density, but decreases significantly with prolonged reaction time for samples with densities higher than 1.2 V/nm2 due to coke formation. Catalysts with densities no higher than 1.2 V/nm2 maintain stable activity. At higher butane pressures, catalysts with higher densities show enhanced activity. Regeneration via oxidation can restore the structure of VOx species up to 873 K, but only high-loaded samples are fully restored, as confirmed by 51V MAS NMR. After regeneration, the surface area of an 8%V catalyst was reduced by 50%, indicating transformations in the support nature.", "Doi": "10.1002/9783527626113.ch15"},

{"DOC": "Vanadium oxide-based catalysts, notably VOx/MCM-41 with dispersed VOx species, have shown stable catalytic performance in dehydrogenation (DH) and regeneration cycles, outperforming industrially relevant PtSn/Al2O3 and CrOx/MCM-41. This stability is attributed to VOx species' resistance to agglomeration. Research since the 1980s has explored these catalysts for their potential in paraffin dehydrogenation. The highest spacetime yield of propene was only 25% lower than that of PtSn/Al2O3, achieved over catalysts based on Siral supports with 10 and 1 wt.% of SiO2. Deactivation is related to carbon deposits covering active VOx sites, but such deposits on bare support sites can also participate in propane dehydrogenation, albeit with lower activity. Acidic properties of the support are crucial for generating catalytically active carbon species. Catalysts showed excellent ability to restore initial activity after 10 DH/oxidative regeneration cycles, except for the one with 70 wt.% SiO2. The optimal DH cycle duration without significant propene yield loss was 6 hours.", "Doi": "10.1039/c3cy01083j"},
