The exploration of vanadium oxide-based catalysts as alternatives for paraffin dehydrogenation has been driven by their rich chemistry and catalytic potential, evolving since the 1980s \[10.1039/c3cy01083j\]. Techniques like Raman spectroscopy, using multiple excitation wavelengths, have provided detailed structural insights into the nature of supported vanadia catalysts \[10.1002/9783527626113.ch15\]. The structure of vanadium species is influenced by carrier type, support surface area, and metal loading, with isolated VOx species dominating at low surface densities, polyvanadates coexisting with monovanadates at intermediate densities, and V2O5 forming at high densities \[10.1016/j.jcat.2007.07.015\]. The weight loss at the reduction step increases with vanadia loading, and the rate of catalyst re-oxidation is greater for higher vanadium loading catalysts \[10.1016/j.apcata.2004.05.017\]. Supported VOx catalysts show good catalytic performance in both oxidation and reduction reactions, being among the most active and selective for dehydrogenation and oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes \[10.1021/cr5002436_3\]. The initial dehydrogenation activity increases with surface VOx density, but decreases significantly with prolonged reaction time for samples with densities higher than 1.2 V/nm2 due to coke formation \[10.1016/j.jcat.2005.11.005\]. Catalysts with surface VOx density no higher than 1.2 V/nm2 maintain stable activity \[10.1039/c3cy01083j\]. At higher butane pressures, catalysts with higher V/nm2 densities show enhanced activity \[10.1002/9783527626113.ch15\]. The structure of VOx species can be restored by oxidation of coke deposits up to 873 K, but only high-loaded samples are fully restored \[10.1021/cr5002436_3\]. 51V MAS NMR confirms the re-oxidation of reduced vanadium species \[10.1002/9783527626113.ch15\].

The development and characterization of vanadium oxide-based catalysts as alternatives for paraffin dehydrogenation: from historical context to species behavior.

Research since the 1980s has highlighted vanadium oxide-based catalysts, notably VOx/MCM-41 with dispersed VOx species, for their stable dehydrogenation (DH) performance, outperforming PtSn/Al2O3 and CrOx/MCM-41 \[10.1039/c3cy01083j\]. This stability is attributed to VOx species' resistance to agglomeration. Studies have focused on VOx-based catalysts using Al2O3SiO2, Al2O3, and SiO2 supports, achieving propene yields close to industrial PtSn/Al2O3 standards \[10.1039/c3cy01083j\]. Deactivation is linked to carbon deposits on VOx sites, with deposits on support sites also participating in propane dehydrogenation but with lower activity. Acidic support properties are crucial for generating active carbon species \[10.1039/c3cy01083j\]. Catalysts based on Siral supports with 10 and 1 wt.% SiO2 showed high propene yields, approaching PtSn/Al2O3 values and outperforming VOx/MCM-41 \[10.1039/c3cy01083j\]. Most catalysts effectively restored initial activity after DH/oxidative regeneration cycles, with the optimal DH cycle duration being 6 hours for Siral-based catalysts \[10.1039/c3cy01083j\]. Catalysts' tendency to form coke increases with surface acidity \[10.1039/c3cy01083j\].

The exploration of vanadium oxide-based catalysts as alternatives to Pt and CrOx for paraffin dehydrogenation has been driven by their rich chemistry, evolving since the 1980s \[10.1002/9783527626113.ch15\]. Techniques like TPR and Raman spectroscopy have revealed the structure and behavior of vanadium species, showing that isolated VOx species dominate at low surface densities, polyvanadates coexist at intermediate densities, and V2O5 forms at high densities \[10.1002/9783527626113.ch15\]. The weight loss during reduction increases with vanadia loading, and higher loadings result in faster re-oxidation \[10.1002/9783527626113.ch15\]. Supported VOx catalysts exhibit good catalytic performance in dehydrogenation reactions, with activity initially increasing as a function of surface VOx density \[10.1002/9783527626113.ch15\]. However, prolonged reaction time leads to significant activity decrease for samples with densities above 1.2 V/nm2 due to coke formation and site blocking \[10.1002/9783527626113.ch15\]. Catalysts with densities no higher than 1.2 V/nm2 maintain stable activity \[10.1002/9783527626113.ch15\]. At higher pressures, catalysts with higher densities show enhanced activity \[10.1002/9783527626113.ch15\]. The structure of VOx species can be restored by oxidation of coke deposits up to 873 K, but only high-loaded samples are fully restored, as indicated by UV-Vis DRS \[10.1002/9783527626113.ch15\]. 51V MAS NMR confirms the re-oxidation of reduced vanadium species \[10.1002/9783527626113.ch15\]. After regeneration, the surface area of an 8%V catalyst was reduced by 50%, indicating transformations in the support's nature \[10.1002/9783527626113.ch15\].

Exploration of vanadium oxide catalysts for paraffin dehydrogenation, driven by the need to address catalyst deactivation issues, has evolved since the 1980s \[10.1016/j.jcat.2007.07.015\]. Research has focused on understanding how carrier type, support surface area, and metal loading affect vanadium species, which can exist as isolated or polymeric forms \[10.1016/j.jcat.2007.07.015\]. These species' nature influences catalytic activity and selectivity, particularly for carbon deposition and dehydrogenation reactions, with redox properties playing a crucial role \[10.1016/j.jcat.2007.07.015\]. The average oxidation state during operation is determined by the rates of reduction and reoxidation, highlighting the importance of these variables in catalyst performance \[10.1016/j.jcat.2007.07.015\].

Driven by the limitations of Pt and CrOx catalysts, research on vanadium oxide-based alternatives for paraffin dehydrogenation has evolved since the 1980s \[10.1016/j.apcata.2004.05.017\]. Carrier type, support surface area, and metal loading significantly impact the nature of vanadium species, affecting catalytic performance \[10.1016/j.apcata.2004.05.017\]. Carrier type influences the formation of monomeric, dimeric vanadates, VOx chains, vanadia overlayers, or V2O5 crystallites \[10.1016/j.apcata.2004.05.017\]. Support surface area and metal loading affect dispersion and redox properties, crucial for activity and selectivity \[10.1016/j.apcata.2004.05.017\].

Exploration of vanadium oxide-based catalysts for paraffin dehydrogenation, spurred by Pt's high cost and Cr's environmental concerns, began in the 1980s focusing on vanadium-magnesium mixed oxides \[10.1021/cr5002436_3\]. Vanadium species' nature is influenced by carrier type, support surface area, metal loading, and oxidation state \[10.1021/cr5002436_3\]. Below monolayer coverage, isolated species form; above, V2O5 crystallites dominate \[10.1021/cr5002436_3\]. Surface area-to-metal loading ratio dictates species type, with monomeric species below 1.2 V/nm2, polymeric between 1.2 and 4.4 V/nm2, and crystalline V2O5 at higher loadings \[10.1021/cr5002436_3\]. Hydroxyl groups on the support surface enhance dispersion, while acid sites hinder performance by facilitating cracking and coke formation \[10.1021/cr5002436_3\].

Rising demand for light olefins and production capacity constraints have spurred interest in vanadium oxide (VOx) catalysts for paraffin dehydrogenation, particularly for propane and butane, since the 1980s \[10.1016/j.jcat.2005.11.005\]. These catalysts are active and selective, but their structure and deactivation mechanisms under dehydrogenation conditions are still under investigation \[10.1016/j.jcat.2005.11.005\]. Research has focused on surface VOx structure and coke formation, revealing that carrier type, support surface area, and metal loading impact vanadium species \[10.1016/j.jcat.2005.11.005\]. The distribution of VOx species, including monovanadate, polyvanadate, and V2O5, is influenced by surface VOx density \[10.1016/j.jcat.2005.11.005\].
