{"DOC": "Research since the 1980s has highlighted vanadium oxide-based catalysts, notably VOx/MCM-41 with dispersed VOx species, for their stable dehydrogenation (DH) performance, outperforming PtSn/Al2O3 and CrOx/MCM-41. Stability is attributed to VOx species' resistance to agglomeration. Studies have focused on VOx-based catalysts using Al2O3SiO2, Al2O3, and SiO2 supports, achieving propene yields close to industrial PtSn/Al2O3 standards. Deactivation is linked to carbon deposits on VOx sites, with deposits on support sites also participating in propane dehydrogenation but with lower activity. Acidic support properties are crucial for generating active carbon species. Catalysts based on Siral supports with 10 and 1 wt.% SiO2 showed high propene yields, approaching PtSn/Al2O3 values and outperforming VOx/MCM-41. Most catalysts effectively restored initial activity after DH/oxidative regeneration cycles, with the optimal DH cycle duration being 6 hours for Siral-based catalysts. Catalysts' tendency to form coke increases with surface acidity.", "Doi": "10.1039/c3cy01083j"},
{"DOC": "The exploration of vanadium oxide-based catalysts as alternatives to Pt and CrOx for paraffin dehydrogenation has been driven by their rich chemistry, evolving since the 1980s. Techniques like TPR and Raman spectroscopy have revealed the structure and behavior of vanadium species, showing that isolated VOx species dominate at low surface densities, polyvanadates coexist at intermediate densities, and V2O5 forms at high densities. The weight loss during reduction increases with vanadia loading, and higher loadings result in faster re-oxidation. Supported VOx catalysts exhibit good catalytic performance in dehydrogenation reactions, with activity initially increasing as a function of surface VOx density. However, prolonged reaction time leads to significant activity decrease for samples with densities above 1.2 V/nm2 due to coke formation and site blocking. Catalysts with densities no higher than 1.2 V/nm2 maintain stable activity. At higher pressures, catalysts with higher densities show enhanced activity. The structure of VOx species can be restored by oxidation of coke deposits up to 873 K, but only high-loaded samples are fully restored, as indicated by UV-Vis DRS. 51V MAS NMR confirms the re-oxidation of reduced vanadium species. After regeneration, the surface area of an 8%V catalyst was reduced by 50%, indicating transformations in the support's nature.", "Doi": "10.1002/9783527626113.ch15"},

The nature of vanadium species is influenced by carrier type, support surface area, and metal loading, with isolated VOx species dominating at low surface densities, polyvanadates coexisting with monovanadates at intermediate densities, and V2O5 forming at high densities. The weight loss during reduction increases with vanadia loading, and higher vanadium loading catalysts re-oxidize faster. Supported VOx catalysts are highly active and selective for dehydrogenation and oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes. Initial dehydrogenation activity increases with surface VOx density, but activity decreases significantly for samples with densities above 1.2 V/nm2 due to coke formation and site blocking. Catalysts with densities no higher than 1.2 V/nm2 maintain stable activity. At higher butane pressures, catalysts with higher V/nm2 densities show enhanced activity. The structure of VOx species can be restored by oxidation of coke deposits up to 873 K, but only high-loaded samples are fully restored, as indicated by UV-Vis DRS. 51V MAS NMR confirms the re-oxidation of reduced vanadium species. After regeneration, the surface area of an 8%V catalyst was reduced by 50%, indicating transformations in the support nature.", "Doi": "10.1002/9783527626113.ch15"},

{"DOC": "Recent studies highlight VOx/MCM-41 catalysts with dispersed VOx species for dehydrogenation (DH), showing stable performance exceeding CrOx/MCM-41 and PtSn/Al2O3 quality. This stability is attributed to VOx species' resistance to agglomeration. Research since the 1980s has explored VOx-based catalysts for DH, focusing on supports like Al2O3SiO2, Al2O3, and SiO2 to avoid crystalline V2O5. The highest spacetime yield of propene is only 25% lower than PtSn/Al2O3 under similar conditions. Deactivation is linked to propene-derived carbon deposits on VOx sites, but deposits on bare support sites can also participate in propane dehydrogenation, albeit less effectively. Acidic support properties are key for catalytically active carbon species. Siral supports with 10 and 1 wt.% SiO2 yield propene spacetime yields approaching PtSn/Al2O3 values, twice that of VOx/MCM-41 with similar vanadium loading. Most catalysts, except those with 70 wt.% SiO2, recover initial activity after 10 DH/oxidative regeneration cycles. The optimal DH cycle duration for Siral-based catalysts is 6 hours, as carbon deposits initially form on non-VOx sites, active in propane dehydrogenation. However, lower activity than VOx species leads to deactivation when VOx sites are also covered. The tendency to form coke increases with surface acidity.", "Doi": "10.1039/c3cy01083j"},
