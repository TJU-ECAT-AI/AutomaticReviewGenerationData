{"DOC": "Vanadium oxide-based catalysts, notably VOx/MCM-41 with isolated VOx species, have shown stable catalytic performance in dehydrogenation (DH) and regeneration cycles, outperforming CrOx/MCM-41 and PtSn/Al2O3. This stability is attributed to VOx species' resistance to agglomeration. Research since the 1980s has focused on VOx catalysts for their potential in paraffin dehydrogenation. Commercial Al2O3SiO2, pure Al2O3, and SiO2 supports were used to prepare catalysts without crystalline V2O5 particles. The highest spacetime yield of propene was only 25% lower than industrially relevant PtSn/Al2O3. Deactivation is linked to propene-derived carbon deposits covering active VOx sites, but these deposits can also participate in propane dehydrogenation with lower activity. Acidic support properties are crucial for generating catalytically active carbon species. Catalysts based on Siral supports with 10 and 1 wt.% SiO2 showed yields approaching those of PtSn/Al2O3, twice as high as VOx/MCM-41. Most catalysts could restore initial activity after 10 DH/oxidative regeneration cycles. The optimal DH cycle duration without significant propene yield loss was 6 hours. Carbon deposits initially form on support sites not carrying VOx, which are active in propane dehydrogenation, but the catalysts deactivate when VOx species also become coke-covered.

Techniques like TPR and Raman spectroscopy, especially using multiple excitation wavelengths, have advanced understanding of vanadium species.

Supported VOx catalysts are active for dehydrogenation reactions. Initial dehydrogenation activity rises with VOx density but decreases over time for densities above 1.2 V/nm2 due to coke formation. Catalysts with densities no higher than 1.2 V/nm2 maintain stable activity. At higher pressures, catalysts with higher densities show enhanced activity. Raman spectroscopy indicates that VOx species structure can be restored by coke deposit oxidation up to 873 K, but UV-Vis DRS suggests only high-loaded samples are fully restored. 51V MAS NMR confirms vanadium species re-oxidation.

Supported VOx catalysts are highly active and selective for dehydrogenation and oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes. The initial dehydrogenation activity increases with surface VOx density, but decreases significantly over time for densities above 1.2 V/nm2 due to coke formation and site blocking. Catalysts with densities no higher than 1.2 V/nm2 maintain stable activity. At higher pressures, catalysts with higher densities show enhanced activity. The structure of VOx species can be restored by oxidation of coke deposits up to 873 K, but only high-loaded samples are fully restored, as indicated by UV-Vis DRS and confirmed by 51V MAS NMR. After regeneration, the surface area of an 8%V catalyst was reduced by 50%, indicating transformations in the support nature.", "Doi": "10.1002/9783527626113.ch15"},

{"DOC": "Research highlights VOx/MCM-41 catalysts with dispersed VOx species for stable dehydrogenation and regeneration cycles, outperforming PtSn/Al2O3 and CrOx/MCM-41. Since the 1980s, exploration has focused on VOx-based catalysts for their selectivity and stability. Studies on Al2O3SiO2, Al2O3, and SiO2 supports reveal that spacetime yields of propene are 25% lower than PtSn/Al2O3 but significantly higher than VOx/MCM-41. Deactivation is linked to carbon deposits on VOx sites, with deposits on support sites also participating in propane dehydrogenation but less actively. Acidic support properties are crucial for catalytically active carbon species. Siral-based catalysts with 10 and 1 wt.% SiO2 achieve high propene yields, approaching PtSn/Al2O3 values. Most catalysts can restore initial activity after 10 DH/oxidative regeneration cycles. The optimal DH cycle duration is 6 hours, as carbon initially forms on non-VOx sites, leading to deactivation when VOx sites are also covered. Catalysts with higher surface acidity tend to form more coke.", "Doi": "10.1039/c3cy01083j"},
{"DOC": "The exploration of vanadium oxide-based catalysts for paraffin dehydrogenation has been driven by their complex chemistry, evolving since the 1980s with advancements in understanding vanadium species. Techniques like Raman spectroscopy using multiple wavelengths have provided deeper insights into the structure of supported metal oxides. The nature of vanadium species is influenced by carrier type, support surface area, and metal loading, with isolated VOx species dominating at low surface densities, polyvanadates coexisting with monovanadates at intermediate densities, and V2O5 forming at high densities.
