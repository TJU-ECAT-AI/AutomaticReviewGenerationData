The development and characterization of vanadium oxide-based catalysts as alternatives for paraffin dehydrogenation have been a focal point of research since the 1980s, driven by the limitations of Pt and CrOx catalysts \[10.1039/c3cy01083j\]. Vanadium oxide catalysts, notably VOx/MCM-41 with isolated VOx species, have demonstrated stable catalytic performance in dehydrogenation (DH) and regeneration cycles, outperforming CrOx/MCM-41 and PtSn/Al2O3 \[10.1039/c3cy01083j\]. This stability is attributed to VOx species' resistance to agglomeration. Research has evolved, focusing on the complex chemistry of vanadium species, influenced by carrier type, support surface area, and metal loading \[10.1002/9783527626113.ch15\]. Techniques like TPR and Raman spectroscopy, especially using multiple excitation wavelengths, have advanced understanding of vanadium species \[10.1002/9783527626113.ch15\]. Isolated VOx species dominate at low surface densities, polyvanadates coexist at intermediate densities, and V2O5 forms at high densities \[10.1002/9783527626113.ch15\]. Catalyst re-oxidation rates increase with vanadium loading \[10.1002/9783527626113.ch15\]. Supported VOx catalysts are highly active for dehydrogenation reactions, with initial dehydrogenation activity rising with surface VOx density but decreasing over time for densities above 1.2 V/nm2 due to coke formation \[10.1002/9783527626113.ch15\]. Catalysts with densities no higher than 1.2 V/nm2 maintain stable activity \[10.1002/9783527626113.ch15\]. At higher pressures, catalysts with higher densities show enhanced activity \[10.1002/9783527626113.ch15\]. The structure of VOx species can be restored by oxidation of coke deposits up to 873 K, but only high-loaded samples are fully restored \[10.1002/9783527626113.ch15\]. After regeneration, the surface area of an 8%V catalyst was reduced by 50%, indicating transformations in the support nature \[10.1002/9783527626113.ch15\].

The quest for vanadium oxide-based catalysts as alternatives for paraffin dehydrogenation has evolved since the 1980s, driven by the need to address catalyst deactivation \[10.1016/j.jcat.2007.07.015\]. Research highlights the role of carrier type, support surface area, and metal loading on vanadium species, which can exist as isolated monomeric vanadia, polyvanadate domains, or V2O5 crystallites \[10.1016/j.jcat.2007.07.015\]. The structure of dispersed vanadia changes with water vapor exposure, and its redox properties are crucial for reactions \[10.1016/j.jcat.2007.07.015\]. The nature of vanadia species, whether isolated or polymeric, impacts catalytic activity and selectivity for carbon deposition and dehydrogenation reactions \[10.1016/j.jcat.2007.07.015\].

Driven by the limitations of Pt and CrOx catalysts, research on vanadium oxide-based alternatives for paraffin dehydrogenation has evolved since the 1980s \[10.1016/j.apcata.2004.05.017\]. Carrier type, support surface area, and metal loading significantly influence the nature of vanadium species, affecting catalytic activity and selectivity \[10.1016/j.apcata.2004.05.017\]. Carrier type determines the formation of vanadium species, including monomeric or dimeric vanadates, VOx chains, vanadia overlayers, or V2O5 crystallites \[10.1016/j.apcata.2004.05.017\]. Support surface area and metal loading impact dispersion and redox properties, crucial for optimal catalyst performance \[10.1016/j.apcata.2004.05.017\].



Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: Taking into consideration the advancements and findings discussed in the file, there lies an opportunity to explore emerging fields and innovative methodologies. Future research endeavors might focus on the development of novel vanadium oxide-based catalysts with tailored properties for enhanced stability and activity. The optimization of carrier type, support surface area, and metal loading could lead to the design of catalysts with improved resistance to deactivation. The use of advanced characterization techniques, such as in situ spectroscopy, could provide deeper insights into the dynamic behavior of vanadium species under reaction conditions. Moreover, the exploration of alternative supports with tailored acidity and hydroxyl group content could offer new avenues for controlling the formation and stability of vanadium species. The integration of computational methods with experimental data could also aid in the rational design of catalysts with optimized properties for paraffin dehydrogenation.

The exploration of vanadium oxide-based catalysts for paraffin dehydrogenation, driven by their rich chemistry and potential as alternatives to Pt and CrOx, has evolved significantly since the 1980s \[10.1002/9783527626113.ch15\]. Techniques like Raman spectroscopy, using multiple excitation wavelengths, have provided detailed structural information of vanadium oxide species \[10.1002/9783527626113.ch15\]. The nature of vanadium species is influenced by variables such as carrier type, support surface area, and metal loading \[10.1002/9783527626113.ch15\]. Isolated VOx species dominate at low surface densities, polyvanadates coexist with monovanadates at intermediate densities, and V2O5 forms at high densities \[10.1002/9783527626113.ch15\]. The weight loss at the reduction step increases with vanadia loading, and the rate of catalyst re-oxidation is greater for higher vanadium loading catalysts \[10.1002/9783527626113.ch15\]. Supported VOx catalysts show good catalytic performance in both oxidation and reduction reactions, being among the most active and selective for dehydrogenation and oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes \[10.1002/9783527626113.ch15\]. The initial dehydrogenation activity increases with surface VOx density, but decreases significantly with prolonged reaction time for samples with densities higher than 1.2 V/nm2 due to surface coke formation \[10.1002/9783527626113.ch15\]. Catalysts with surface VOx density no higher than 1.2 V/nm2 maintain nearly unchanged dehydrogenation activity \[10.1002/9783527626113.ch15\]. At higher butane pressures, catalysts with higher V/nm2 densities show enhanced activity \[10.1002/9783527626113.ch15\]. The structure of VOx species can be restored by oxidation of coke deposits up to 873 K, but only high-loaded samples are fully restored according to UV-Vis DRS \[10.1002/9783527626113.ch15\]. 51V MAS NMR confirms the re-oxidation of reduced vanadium species \[10.1002/9783527626113.ch15\]. After regeneration, the surface area of an 8%V catalyst was reduced by 50%, indicating transformations in the nature of the support \[10.1002/9783527626113.ch15\].
