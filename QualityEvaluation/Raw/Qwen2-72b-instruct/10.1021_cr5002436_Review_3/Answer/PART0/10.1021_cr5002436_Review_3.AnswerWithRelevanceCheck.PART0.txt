          [1] "Despite the excellent performance of Pt and CrOx catalysts in paraffin dehydrogenation, a number of issues including catalyst poisoning, the high cost of Pt, and environmental concerns associated with the use of Cr have spurred the search for alternatives."
          [2] "Vanadium oxides are known to be active for many hydrocarbon oxidation reactions, including dehydrogenation."
          [3] "Research on vanadium-based dehydrogenation catalysts started in the 1980s, although at that time the focus was on oxidative dehydrogenation using vanadiummagnesium mixed oxides."
          [4] "The nature of the vanadium present on the catalyst depends to a large extent on the type of carrier, the support surface area, the metal loading, and the oxidation state of vanadium."
          [5] "Far below the theoretical monolayer coverage isolated vanadium species are present, at intermediate surface coverage polymeric species or sheets of vanadium oxide are favored, and above monolayer coverage V2O5 crystallites become dominant."
          [6] "The surface area-to-metal loading ratio determines which species will form."
          [7] "Indeed, Wu et al. reported that monomeric species are predominantly present below 1.2 V/nm2, polymeric vanadium species prevail between 1.2 and 4.4 V/nm2, and crystalline V2O5 species preponderate at even higher loadings."
          [8] "On the one hand, the presence of hydroxyl groups on the surface of the support is important to obtain a well-dispersed catalyst, as OH groups serve as anchoring sites for the vanadium precursors used to prepare these catalysts."
          [9] "On the other hand, acid sites are detrimental for catalyst performance, because they facilitate cracking and induce coke formation."

          The exploration of vanadium oxide-based catalysts as alternatives to Pt and CrOx for paraffin dehydrogenation has been driven by issues such as catalyst poisoning, the high cost of Pt, and environmental concerns associated with the use of Cr. Research in this area started in the 1980s, initially focusing on oxidative dehydrogenation using vanadium-magnesium mixed oxides. The nature of the vanadium species in these catalysts is influenced by factors such as the type of carrier, support surface area, metal loading, and the oxidation state of vanadium. Below the theoretical monolayer coverage, isolated vanadium species are present, while at intermediate surface coverage, polymeric species or sheets of vanadium oxide are favored. Above monolayer coverage, V2O5 crystallites become dominant. The surface area-to-metal loading ratio determines which species will form, with monomeric species predominantly present below 1.2 V/nm2, polymeric vanadium species prevailing between 1.2 and 4.4 V/nm2, and crystalline V2O5 species preponderating at even higher loadings. The presence of hydroxyl groups on the support surface is crucial for a well-dispersed catalyst, as they serve as anchoring sites for vanadium precursors. However, acid sites on the support are detrimental to catalyst performance, as they can facilitate cracking and induce coke formation.

          探索钒氧化物基催化剂作为Pt和CrOx的替代品用于石蜡脱氢，是由催化剂中毒、铂的高成本以及使用Cr的环境问题等因素推动的。该领域的研究始于20世纪80年代，最初的重点是使用钒-镁混合氧化物进行氧化脱氢。这些催化剂中钒物种的性质受到载体类型、支撑表面面积、金属负载量和钒的氧化态等因素的影响。在理论单层覆盖度以下，存在孤立的钒物种，而在中间表面覆盖度下，优先形成聚合钒物种或钒氧化物片层。在超过单层覆盖度时，V2O5晶体成为主导。表面面积与金属负载量的比率决定了不同钒物种的形成，Wu等人报告称，在1.2 V/nm2以下，主要存在单体物种，在1.2至4.4 V/nm2之间，聚合钒物种占主导，在更高负载下，结晶V2O5物种占优势。支撑表面存在羟基对于获得分散良好的催化剂很重要，因为OH基团作为用于制备这些催化剂的钒前体的锚定位点。然而，酸位对催化剂性能有害，因为它们促进裂解并诱导焦炭形成。
