          The exploration of vanadium oxide-based catalysts as alternatives to Pt and CrOx for paraffin dehydrogenation has been driven by the need to mitigate severe catalyst deactivation observed in industrial chemical processes. Research in this area has evolved since the 1980s, with a focus on understanding the role of variables such as carrier type, support surface area, and metal loading on the nature and behavior of vanadium species. It is generally accepted that supported vanadium oxide can exist as isolated monomeric vanadia species, one- or two-dimensional polyvanadate domains, or bulk V2O5 crystallites. The structure of dispersed vanadia changes on exposure to water vapor, and the redox properties of the vanadia catalysts are important for reactions. The average oxidation state during catalytic operation depends on the relative rates of reduction and reoxidation. The nature of the vanadia species, whether isolated or polymeric, influences the catalytic activity and selectivity for carbon deposition and dehydrogenation reactions.

          探索将钒氧化物基催化剂作为Pt和CrOx的替代品用于石蜡脱氢,是由工业化学过程中观察到的严重催化剂失活的需要缓解所驱动的。自20世纪80年代以来,该领域的研究已经发展,重点是理解载体类型、支撑表面积和金属负载等变量对钒物种性质和行为的作用。通常认为,支撑的钒氧化物可以存在为孤立的单体钒酸盐物种、一维或二维聚钒酸盐域或V2O5晶体。分散的钒酸盐在暴露于水蒸气时结构会发生变化,钒酸盐催化剂的氧化还原性质对反应很重要。催化操作期间的平均氧化态取决于还原和再氧化的相对速率。钒酸盐物种的性质,无论是孤立的还是聚合的,影响催化活性和对碳沉积和脱氢反应的选择性。
