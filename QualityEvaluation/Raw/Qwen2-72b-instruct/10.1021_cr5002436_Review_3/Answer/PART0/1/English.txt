Research has shown that vanadium oxide-based catalysts, particularly VOx/MCM-41 with highly dispersed VOx species, exhibit stable catalytic performance in dehydrogenation (DH) and regeneration cycles, surpassing the quality of industrially relevant CrOx/MCM-41 and PtSn/Al2O3 catalysts. This stability is attributed to the VOx species' resistance to agglomeration during DH and regeneration cycles. Since the 1980s, the exploration of vanadium oxide-based catalysts as alternatives has been driven by their potential to provide similar selectivity and stable performance. The current work aims to further investigate the potential of VOx-based catalysts for the DH reaction by selecting commercial Al2O3SiO2 materials, pure Al2O3, and SiO2 as supports to prepare catalysts free of crystalline V2O5 particles. The highest spacetime yield of propene achieved with these catalysts is only 25% lower than that of industrially relevant PtSn/Al2O3 under the same reaction conditions. The deactivation of the catalysts is related to propene-derived carbon deposits covering active VOx sites. However, such deposits formed on bare support sites can also participate in propane dehydrogenation, albeit with significantly lower activity compared to VOx species. The acidic properties of the support are crucial for the generation of catalytically active carbon species. The highest spacetime yields of propene were achieved over catalysts based on Siral supports with 10 and 1 wt.% of SiO2, respectively, approaching the values measured on industrially relevant PtSn/Al2O3 and being approximately two times higher than that delivered by the VOx/MCM-41 catalyst with a similar vanadium loading. All catalysts, except for the one containing 70 wt.% of SiO2 in the support, showed excellent ability to restore their initial activity after 10 DH/oxidative regeneration cycles. The optimal duration of the DH cycle without a significant loss of initial propene yield over Siral-based catalysts was determined to be 6 h. This is because carbon deposits are initially formed on the support sites not carrying VOx and are active in propane dehydrogenation. However, since their activity is significantly lower than that of VOx species, the catalysts start to deactivate when the latter also become covered by coke. The tendency of the catalysts to form coke increases with their surface acidity.

The exploration of vanadium oxide-based catalysts as alternatives to Pt and CrOx for paraffin dehydrogenation has been driven by the rich and complex chemistry of these materials, which is still not fully understood. Research in this area has evolved since the 1980s, with significant advances made in understanding the structure and behavior of vanadium species in these catalysts. Techniques such as TPR, XPS, ESR, UV-Vis DRS, XAFS, and Raman spectroscopy have been applied to investigate the reduction of supported vanadia catalysts. The use of multiple excitation wavelengths in Raman spectroscopy has allowed for more complete structural information of supported metal oxides to be obtained. The nature and behavior of vanadium species in these catalysts are influenced by variables such as carrier type, support surface area, and metal loading. For example, isolated VOx species dominate at surface densities below 1 V/nm2, polyvanadates coexist with monovanadates at surface densities between 1.2 and 4.4 V/nm2, and V2O5 forms at a surface density higher than 4.4 V/nm2. The weight loss at the reduction step increases with vanadia loading, and the rate of catalyst re-oxidation is greater for higher vanadium loading catalysts. Once reduced, the 3.5%V sample did not regain its original state even after high temperature oxidation, while the reduced 8%V sample did convert to a species similar to the original oxidation state. Supported VOx catalysts show good catalytic performance in both oxidation and reduction reactions; for example, they are among the most active and selective simple metal oxides for dehydrogenation and oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes. The possibility of using oxide systems other than chromia is being explored in an effort to make the alkane-alkene conversion process more selective and stable. V/θ-Al2O3 catalysts with surface VOx density from 0.03 to 14.2 V/nm2 were tested for butane dehydrogenation under low partial pressures of butane at 873 K, and the activity and selectivity data on these different catalysts were compared. In essence, the initial dehydrogenation activity increases as a function of surface VOx density. However, the activity decreases significantly with prolonged reaction time for samples with VOx density higher than 1.2 V/nm2, apparently due to the formation of surface coke deposits and blocking of surface sites during the reaction. Interestingly, the dehydrogenation activity remains nearly unchanged on the catalysts with surface VOx density no higher than 1.2 V/nm2. However, at higher butane pressures, although the behavior of the 1.2 V/nm2 sample is unchanged, catalysts with higher V/nm2 densities show enhanced activity. The regeneration of samples of V/θ-Al2O3 coked from low partial pressure butane dehydrogenation via oxidation was also followed by UV Raman spectroscopy as well as gas chromatography (GC). The Raman spectroscopy indicates that the structure of the VOx species can be restored by oxidation of the coke deposits up to 873 K. UV-Vis DRS, however, suggests that only high-loaded samples are fully restored. 51V MAS NMR confirms the re-oxidation of reduced vanadium species and, as such, spectra of the regenerated catalyst can be acquired. After regeneration, the surface area of an 8%V catalyst was reduced by 50%, a change assigned to transformations in the nature of the support. A similar effect was observed after propane dehydrogenation over a vanadia/alumina catalyst, where a conversion of the γ-alumina support to α-alumina was confirmed by XRD. 27Al triple-quantum (3Q) MAS NMR studies have also demonstrated that the nature of the support undergoes a transformation.

Research in this area has evolved since the 1980s, with a focus on understanding the role of variables such as carrier type, support surface area, and metal loading on the nature and behavior of vanadium species. It is generally accepted that supported vanadium oxide can exist as isolated monomeric vanadia species, one- or two-dimensional polyvanadate domains, or bulk V2O5 crystallites. The structure of dispersed vanadia changes on exposure to water vapor, and the redox properties of the vanadia catalysts are important for reactions. The average oxidation state during catalytic operation depends on the relative rates of reduction and reoxidation. The nature of the vanadia species, whether isolated or polymeric, influences the catalytic activity and selectivity for carbon deposition and dehydrogenation reactions.

The exploration of vanadium oxide-based catalysts as alternatives to Pt and CrOx for paraffin dehydrogenation has been driven by the drawbacks of existing catalysts and the potential advantages of vanadium species. Research in this area has evolved since the 1980s, focusing on understanding the influence of variables such as carrier type, support surface area, and metal loading on the nature and behavior of vanadium species. Carrier type significantly affects the physicochemical nature of VOx species, leading to various vanadium species such as monomeric or dimeric vanadates, VOx chains, vanadia overlayers, or V2O5 crystallites. Support surface area and metal loading also play crucial roles, impacting the dispersion, redox properties, and formation of vanadium species, which in turn influence the catalytic activity, selectivity, and performance of the catalyst.

The exploration of vanadium oxide-based catalysts as alternatives to Pt and CrOx for paraffin dehydrogenation has been driven by issues such as catalyst poisoning, the high cost of Pt, and environmental concerns associated with the use of Cr. Research in this area started in the 1980s, initially focusing on oxidative dehydrogenation using vanadium-magnesium mixed oxides. The nature of the vanadium species in these catalysts is influenced by factors such as the type of carrier, support surface area, metal loading, and the oxidation state of vanadium. Below the theoretical monolayer coverage, isolated vanadium species are present, while at intermediate surface coverage, polymeric species or sheets of vanadium oxide are favored. Above monolayer coverage, V2O5 crystallites become dominant. The surface area-to-metal loading ratio determines which species will form, with monomeric species predominantly present below 1.2 V/nm2, polymeric vanadium species prevailing between 1.2 and 4.4 V/nm2, and crystalline V2O5 species preponderating at even higher loadings. The presence of hydroxyl groups on the support surface is crucial for a well-dispersed catalyst, as they serve as anchoring sites for vanadium precursors. However, acid sites on the support are detrimental to catalyst performance, as they can facilitate cracking and induce coke formation.

The increasing demand for light olefins and the insufficient capacity of current production by steam and catalytic cracking are driving the investigation of alternative ways to manufacture these chemicals. Supported vanadium oxide (VOx) catalysts for the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) and dehydrogenation (DH) of light alkanes have been extensively studied. They show promise for being both active and selective for DH reactions, particularly for propane and butane. However, the structure of supported VOx and the mechanism of deactivation/coke deposition under DH conditions remain unclear. Research has evolved since the 1980s, focusing on the structure of surface VOx and the coke formation process during butane DH over V/θ-Al2O3 catalysts with various surface VOx densities using in situ UV Raman spectroscopy. Variables such as carrier type, support surface area, and metal loading influence the nature and behavior of vanadium species in these catalysts. The distribution of VOx species, including monovanadate, polyvanadate, and V2O5, depends on the surface VOx density.

The nature of the vanadia species, whether isolated or polymeric, influences the catalytic activity and selectivity for carbon deposition and dehydrogenation reactions.

The exploration of vanadium oxide-based catalysts as alternatives to Pt and CrOx for paraffin dehydrogenation has been driven by the drawbacks of existing catalysts and the potential advantages of vanadium species. Research in this area has evolved since the 1980s, focusing on understanding the influence of variables such as carrier type, support surface area, and metal loading on the nature and behavior of vanadium species. Carrier type significantly affects the physicochemical nature of VOx species, leading to various vanadium species such as monomeric or dimeric vanadates, VOx chains, vanadia overlayers, or V2O5 crystallites. Support surface area and metal loading also play crucial roles, impacting the dispersion, redox properties, and formation of vanadium species, which in turn influence the catalytic activity, selectivity, and performance of the catalyst.

The exploration of vanadium oxide-based catalysts as alternatives to Pt and CrOx for paraffin dehydrogenation has been driven by issues such as catalyst poisoning, the high cost of Pt, and environmental concerns associated with the use of Cr. Research in this area started in the 1980s, initially focusing on oxidative dehydrogenation using vanadium-magnesium mixed oxides. The nature of the vanadium species in these catalysts is influenced by factors such as the type of carrier, support surface area, metal loading, and the oxidation state of vanadium. Below the theoretical monolayer coverage, isolated vanadium species are present, while at intermediate surface coverage, polymeric species or sheets of vanadium oxide are favored. Above monolayer coverage, V2O5 crystallites become dominant. The surface area-to-metal loading ratio determines which species will form, with monomeric species predominantly present below 1.2 V/nm2, polymeric vanadium species prevailing between 1.2 and 4.4 V/nm2, and crystalline V2O5 species preponderating at even higher loadings. The presence of hydroxyl groups on the support surface is crucial for a well-dispersed catalyst, as they serve as anchoring sites for vanadium precursors. However, acid sites on the support are detrimental to catalyst performance, as they can facilitate cracking and induce coke formation.

The increasing demand for light olefins and the insufficient capacity of current production by steam and catalytic cracking are driving the investigation of alternative ways to manufacture these chemicals. Supported vanadium oxide (VOx) catalysts for the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) and dehydrogenation (DH) of light alkanes have been extensively studied. They show promise for being both active and selective for DH reactions, particularly for propane and butane. However, the structure of supported VOx and the mechanism of deactivation/coke deposition under DH conditions remain unclear. Research has evolved since the 1980s, focusing on the structure of surface VOx and the coke formation process during butane DH over V/θ-Al2O3 catalysts with various surface VOx densities using in situ UV Raman spectroscopy. Variables such as carrier type, support surface area, and metal loading influence the nature and behavior of vanadium species in these catalysts. The distribution of VOx species, including monovanadate, polyvanadate, and V2O5, depends on the surface VOx density.

Research has shown that vanadium oxide-based catalysts, particularly VOx/MCM-41 with highly dispersed VOx species, exhibit stable catalytic performance in dehydrogenation (DH) and regeneration cycles, surpassing the quality of industrially relevant CrOx/MCM-41 and PtSn/Al2O3 catalysts. This stability is attributed to the VOx species' resistance to agglomeration during DH and regeneration cycles. Since the 1980s, the exploration of vanadium oxide-based catalysts as alternatives has been driven by their potential to provide similar selectivity and stable performance. The current work aims to further investigate the potential of VOx-based catalysts for the DH reaction by selecting commercial Al2O3SiO2 materials, pure Al2O3, and SiO2 as supports to prepare catalysts free of crystalline V2O5 particles. The highest spacetime yield of propene achieved with these catalysts is only 25% lower than that of industrially relevant PtSn/Al2O3 under the same reaction conditions. The deactivation of the catalysts is related to propene-derived carbon deposits covering active VOx sites. However, such deposits formed on bare support sites can also participate in propane dehydrogenation, albeit with significantly lower activity compared to VOx species. The acidic properties of the support are crucial for the generation of catalytically active carbon species. The highest spacetime yields of propene were achieved over catalysts based on Siral supports with 10 and 1 wt.% of SiO2, respectively, approaching the values measured on industrially relevant PtSn/Al2O3 and being approximately two times higher than that delivered by the VOx/MCM-41 catalyst with a similar vanadium loading. All catalysts, except for the one containing 70 wt.% of SiO2 in the support, showed excellent ability to restore their initial activity after 10 DH/oxidative regeneration cycles. The optimal duration of the DH cycle without a significant loss of initial propene yield over Siral-based catalysts was determined to be 6 h. This is because carbon deposits are initially formed on the support sites not carrying VOx and are active in propane dehydrogenation. However, since their activity is significantly lower than that of VOx species, the catalysts start to deactivate when the latter also become covered by coke. The tendency of the catalysts to form coke increases with their surface acidity.

The exploration of vanadium oxide-based catalysts as alternatives to Pt and CrOx for paraffin dehydrogenation has been driven by the rich and complex chemistry of these materials, which is still not fully understood. Research in this area has evolved since the 1980s, with significant advances made in understanding the structure and behavior of vanadium species in these catalysts. Techniques such as TPR, XPS, ESR, UV-Vis DRS, XAFS, and Raman spectroscopy have been applied to investigate the reduction of supported vanadia catalysts. The use of multiple excitation wavelengths in Raman spectroscopy has allowed for more complete structural information of supported metal oxides to be obtained. The nature and behavior of vanadium species in these catalysts are influenced by variables such as carrier type, support surface area, and metal loading. For example, isolated VOx species dominate at surface densities below 1 V/nm2, polyvanadates coexist with monovanadates at surface densities between 1.2 and 4.4 V/nm2, and V2O5 forms at a surface density higher than 4.4 V/nm2. The weight loss at the reduction step increases with vanadia loading, and the rate of catalyst re-oxidation is greater for higher vanadium loading catalysts. Once reduced, the 3.5%V sample did not regain its original state even after high temperature oxidation, while the reduced 8%V sample did convert to a species similar to the original oxidation state. Supported VOx catalysts show good catalytic performance in both oxidation and reduction reactions; for example, they are among the most active and selective simple metal oxides for dehydrogenation and oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes. The possibility of using oxide systems other than chromia is being explored in an effort to make the alkane-alkene conversion process more selective and stable. V/θ-Al2O3 catalysts with surface VOx density from 0.03 to 14.2 V/nm2 were tested for butane dehydrogenation under low partial pressures of butane at 873 K, and the activity and selectivity data on these different catalysts were compared. In essence, the initial dehydrogenation activity increases as a function of surface VOx density. However, the activity decreases significantly with prolonged reaction time for samples with VOx density higher than 1.2 V/nm2, apparently due to the formation of surface coke deposits and blocking of surface sites during the reaction. Interestingly, the dehydrogenation activity remains nearly unchanged on the catalysts with surface VOx density no higher than 1.2 V/nm2. However, at higher butane pressures, although the behavior of the 1.2 V/nm2 sample is unchanged, catalysts with higher V/nm2 densities show enhanced activity. The regeneration of samples of V/θ-Al2O3 coked from low partial pressure butane dehydrogenation via oxidation was also followed by UV Raman spectroscopy as well as gas chromatography (GC). The Raman spectroscopy indicates that the structure of the VOx species can be restored by oxidation of the coke deposits up to 873 K. UV-Vis DRS, however, suggests that only high-loaded samples are fully restored. 51V MAS NMR confirms the re-oxidation of reduced vanadium species and, as such, spectra of the regenerated catalyst can be acquired. After regeneration, the surface area of an 8%V catalyst was reduced by 50%, a change assigned to transformations in the nature of the support. A similar effect was observed after propane dehydrogenation over a vanadia/alumina catalyst, where a conversion of the γ-alumina support to α-alumina was confirmed by XRD. 27Al triple-quantum (3Q) MAS NMR studies have also demonstrated that the nature of the support undergoes a transformation.
