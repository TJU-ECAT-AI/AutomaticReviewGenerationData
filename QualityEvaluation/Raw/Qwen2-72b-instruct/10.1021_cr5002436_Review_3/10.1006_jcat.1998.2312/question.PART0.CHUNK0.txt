Journal of Catalysis 182, 117128 (1999) Article ID jcat.1998.2312, available online at http://www.idealibrary.com on Reaction Pathways and Rate-Determining Steps in Reactions of Alkanes on H-ZSM5 and Zn/H-ZSM5 Catalysts Joseph A. Biscardi and Enrique Iglesia1 Department of Chemical Engineering, University of California at Berkeley, Berkeley, California 94720 Received June 4, 1998; revised October 10, 1998; accepted October 20, 1998 Reactions of ethane and propane on H-ZSM5 lead primarily to undesired products of β-scission reactions. Turnover rates, aro- matic site-time yields, and the rate of hydrogen disposal during alkane conversion increase as the density of exchanged Zn cations increases in H-ZSM5. Zn cations decrease β-scission rates and the residence time of alkenes within oligomerization/β-scission cycles,leading to higher rates and selectivity for the synthesis of C6-C8 aro- matic products. Reactions of propene/2-13C propane mixtures show that initial dehydrogenation steps become increasingly irreversible as Zn cations catalyze the recombinative desorption of H-atoms and H2. This process depletes the surface hydrogen pool available for the reverse hydrogenation reactions and it increases the over- all rate of propene conversion to aromatics. Zn cations promote not only alkane dehydrogenation, but also the subsequent removal of hydrogen as H2, leading to unsaturated intermediates required in cyclization steps. C3H8/C3D8 isotopic exchange rates are much higher than propane conversion rates. Exchange rates are similar on H-ZSM5 and Zn/H-ZSM5, but negligible on Na-ZSM5, consistent with the involvement of Bronsted acid sites in isotopic scrambling within alkanes and with a predominant role of Zn in the recom- binative desorption of H-atoms. This proposal is consistent with the effects of Zn cations on the rate of H2/D2 isotopic equilibra- tion, with the role of added H2 on alkane reaction rates, and with the rate of incorporation of D-atoms into reaction products formed from C3H8/D2 mixtures. c 1999 Academic Press Key Words: H-ZSM5; Zn/H-ZSM5; deuterium exchange; alkane reaction mechanisms; ethane reactions; propane reactions; dehy- drogenation; aromatization.
1. INTRODUCTION
The conversion of light alkanes to aromatics and H2 via nonoxidative routes significantly expands the feedstocks available for synthesis of these valuable products. Many studies have focused on the use of medium-pore pentasil zeolites for these reactions. H-ZSM5 catalyzes the conver- sion of light alkanes to aromatics with low selectivity be- cause of fast β-scission side reactions. The introduction of 1 Corresponding author.

Ga (123), Zn (2436), and Pt (3743) species into H-ZSM5 increases the rate and selectivity of aromatization reactions and inhibits β-scission side reactions that lead to undesir- able products.
Aromatization reaction pathways have been discussed extensively. Most studies addressed the effect of catalyst composition on reaction rates and selectivities (1, 4, 10, 24,26, 38, 40, 44, 45, 47). Recently, direct evidence for the se- quence of propane aromatization steps has been obtained using isotopic tracer and exchange methods (48). These methods have established the nature and the rate of in- dividual reaction steps in this reaction sequence.
The catalytic role of metal cations in light alkane aromati- zation remains the subject of controversy even after signif- icant emphasis and numerous publications. Guisnet et al.
(3, 4, 10, 18, 40, 46, 49) observed a higher initial rate of propene formation when metal cations (Ga) were added,leading them to suggest that propane dehydrogenation and naphthene dehydrogenation steps occur on the Ga cations.
They suggested that all other required steps occurred on Bronsted acid sites within zeolite channels. Mole et al. (24) proposed that Zn cations in H-ZSM5 were involved in all dehydrogenation steps required for alkane aromatiza- tion, but only by catalyzing the recombinative desorption of H-atoms as H2, while all other steps occurred on acid sites.
Subsequent kinetic and isotopic tracer studies by Inui et al.
(37, 50), le van Mao et al. (5, 7, 30, 51), and Iglesia et al.
(8, 12, 14, 15, 29, 32) confirmed the involvement of metal cations in rate-determining hydrogen removal steps dur- ing propane reactions on Zn- and Ga-promoted H-ZSM5.
The latter studies suggested a synergy between acid sites and exchanged cations where alkane activation and initial C-H bond cleavage can occur on acid sites, but hydrogen atoms must be preferentially removed via hydrogen trans- fer to hydrocarbon species to form C2H6 and CH4, or via recombinative desorption on cation sites to form H2.
In this study, we present mechanistic evidence for bifunc- tional pathways in the conversion of ethane and propane to aromatics on H-ZSM5 modified by Zn cations. We also examine the effect of Zn loading on propane conversion and hydrogen removal rates and the nature of hydrogen 117 0021-9517/99 $30.00 Copyright c 1999 by Academic Press All rights of reproduction in any form reserved. 118

adsorption/desorption steps using deuterium exchange, hy- drogen kinetic measurements, and H2/D2 isotopic equili- bration reactions.
2. EXPERIMENTAL METHODS
2.1. Catalyst Synthesis
Na-ZSM5 (Zeochem, Si/Al = 14.5) was converted to NH4-ZSM5 by exchange with a 0.67 M solution of NH4NO3 (Fisher, Certified ACS, >98.0%) at 353 K for 10 h. The exchange procedure was repeated three times using fresh NH4NO3 solutions in order to ensure complete removal of Na+ cations. Solids were filtered, washed with deionized water, dried at 373 K for 20 h, and calcined at 773 K for 20 h in order to decompose NH+ 4 to H+ and to form the acidic form of the zeolite (H-ZSM5).
Three Zn/H-ZSM5 catalysts were prepared by ion- exchange of H-ZSM5 with a solution of Zn(NO3)2 (0.0050 M, Aldrich, >98.0%) at 343 K for 1, 5.5, or 9 h. Each sample was filtered, washed with deionized water, dried in flowing air at 383 K for 20 h, and then treated in flowing dry air at 773 K for 20 h.
2.2. Elemental Analysis
Si and Al contents in H-ZSM5 were measured by atomic emission spectroscopy (AES). The atomic Si/Al ratio in the ZSM5 material was 14.5. This value remained constant throughout all exchange procedures and thermal treat- ments. The residual Na content of the H-ZSM5 was less than 0.07 wt%. The Zn content was also measured by AES.
Zn contents were 0.62, 1.07, and 1.30 wt%, which corre- spond to Zn/Al atomic ratios of 0.10, 0.16, and 0.19, re- spectively. Isotopic exchange of zeolite OH groups with D2 in H-ZSM5 gave a H/Al ratio of 1.04, suggesting that any extra-framework Al species must be present in very low concentrations (53).
2.3. Catalytic Reaction Studies
Kinetic and isotopic tracer studies were conducted in a gradientless batch reactor consisting of a shallow packed- bed contained within a gas recirculation loop (8). Reactants and products were recirculated at 250 cm3 min1 using a graphite gear micropump in order to maintain differential reactor conditions (<2% conversion per pass). The reactor was evacuated by mechanical and diffusion pumps isolated from the system using liquid nitrogen traps. The chemical and isotopic compositions of the reactants and products were measured by capillary chromatography using flame ionization and electron-impact mass spectrometric detec- tion methods.Propane (Matheson, instrument purity, >99.5%), per- deuterated propane (Isotec, chemical purity >99.0%, iso- topic purity >99.0%), propane-2-13C (Cambridge Isotopes,chemical purity >98.0%, isotopic purity >99.0%), deu- terium (Matheson, C.P., chemical purity >99.5%, isotopic purity >99.0%), and propene (Matheson, C.P., >99.0%) were used as reactants without further purification. Hydro- gen (Matheson, C.P., >99.99%) was purified using an oxy- gen trap (Matheson) and a 13X molecular sieve trap held at room temperature. Helium (>99.95%) was purified using a 13X molecular sieve trap at room temperature before use as a diluent.Propane reaction rates are reported as the molar rate of propane conversion per g-atom Al in the catalyst charge.Product concentrations in the batch reactor are given as site-yields (moles of propane converted to a given prod- uct per g-atom Al) as a function of contact time; the slope of such plots give site-time yields for the formation of each product. Hydrocarbon selectivities are reported on a carbon basis, as the percentage of the converted propane that appears as each reaction product. Hydrogen selectivi- ties are reported as the percentage of the hydrogen in the propane that appears within each product.
2.4. Isotopic Equilibration of H2/D2 Mixtures
Isotopic exchange between H2 and D2 was carried out in a flow apparatus consisting of a metered gas manifold connected to a quartz capillary cell. Samples were heated to 773 K in a flowing H2/Ar mixture (5.0% H2, Matheson,certified standard, 100 cm3/min), held isothermal for 1 h,and then cooled to 300 K. The flow was then switched to a H2/D2/Ar mixture (5.0% H2, 5.0% D2, 1.0% N2, 89.0% Ar, Matheson, certified standard, 100 cm3/min) and the tem- perature was increased from 300 to 873 K at 10 K/min. The isotopic composition of the effluent from the cell was mea- sured by an on-line mass spectrometer (Leybold-Inficon, Model THP TS200). The kinetic rate constants were deter- mined by analysis methods reported by Boudart (52).
2.5. Deuterium and 13C Analysis in Hydrocarbon Mixtures
The deuterium fraction in reactants and products was determined from mass spectral data during propane con- version using C3H8/D2 mixtures. The fraction of the iso- topomers for each product was determined from mass spectra after correcting for ion fragmentation (54). Cross exchange products in C3H8/C3D8 mixtures were measured using a similar technique and the cross exchange rate was determined from the number of deuterium atoms (or hy- drogen atoms) in the propane isotopomers multiplied by the moles of unconverted propane and reported per g- atom Al in ZSM5 catalysts. 13C distributions were mea- sured on the products of C3H8-2-13C reactants and of C3H8-2-13C/C3H6 mixtures using mass spectral data and analysis methods that account for ion fragmentation and natural 13C abundance (54).

3. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
3.1. The Effect of Metal Cations on Propane and Ethane
Conversion Rate and Selectivity Propane conversion turnover rates and selectivities on H-ZSM5 and Zn/H-ZSM5 are shown in Table 1 at similar propane conversion levels (7.68.3%). Propane turnover rates, aromatics site-time yields, propene selectivity, aro- matic selectivities, and hydrogen (H2) selectivity increase with increasing Zn content in H-ZSM5. These results are similar to those reported previously by others (33, 55).
The data in Fig. 1 show that hydrogen desorption site- yields increase with increasing Zn content in H-ZSM5.
H-ZSM5 disposes of H-atoms at significantly lower rates and preferentially by hydrogen transfer to adsorbed hydrocarbonsfollowedbydesorptionofhydrogen-richCH4 and C2H6 alkanes.
In addition to increasing total propane conversion turnover rates, Zn increases site-yields for the formation of propene from propane (Fig. 2). Initial propene site- time yields increase from 2.4 × 104 s1 to 35.4 × 104 s1 when Zn (1.30 wt%) is ion-exchanged into H-ZSM5. Zn sites increase the rate of dehydrogenation reactions and in- hibit the formation of undesired β-scission products such as methane. Methane site-yields are lower on Zn/H-ZSM5 than on H-ZSM5 (Fig. 3), but they increase as Zn loading in- creases. The change in methane formation rates may result from the introduction of Zn into H-ZSM5 which replaces some of the initially present acid protons.

Previous structural characterization of the metal and acid density in Zn/H-ZSM5 (Si/Al = 14.5) has suggested that Zn resides at cation exchange sites as O-Zn+2-Ospecies and interacts with two framework aluminum atoms (53). The number of remaining protons after Zn exchange in Zn/H- ZSM5 has been determined from the isotopic titration of remaining surface hydrogen species with deuterium and is reported in Table 1. Thus, methane site-yields calculated based on the number of residual Bronsted acid sites rather than on the total Al sites still give lower values of methane site-time yields on Zn-containing samples than on H-ZSM5 (Fig. 4). The higher methane formation rate as Zn load- ing increases can be explained using reactions shown in

Scheme 1. From this reaction scheme, the rate of β-scission is expressed in Eq. [1]:rβ-scission = k2(C 3) = k1k2(C3H8) k2 + k3 .
[1] Zn cations increase the rate of dehydrogenation. When Zn is present, k3 becomes the dominant term in the denomina- tor and β-scission rates decrease when Zn is added. How- ever, as Zn content increases, k1 increases proportionately more than k3, resulting in higher propane β-scission rates.
The effect of Zn on alkane reactions is also evident for ethane reactants. Ethane conversion rates on H-ZSM5 and Zn/H-ZSM5 at 773 K are shown in Table 2. Ethane con-

Propane reaction mechanism for β-scission and dehy- drogenation. version turnover rates increase when Zn (1.07 wt%) is ex- changed into H-ZSM5. As with propane, ethane conversion rates, ethene selectivity, aromatics selectivity, and hydrogen formation rates all increase when Zn is present. Ethane and propane conversions appear to proceed by similar mecha- nistic routes, leading to methane, aromatics, and the corre- sponding alkene. Ethane conversion rates are lower than propane conversion rates on all catalysts.
Reaction rates at 773 K on H-ZSM5 and Zn/H-ZSM5 were also measured using propene as the reactant. As with ethane and propane reactants, the addition of Zn species to H-ZSM5 leads to an increase in propene con- version turnover rates, aromatics site-time yields, hydrogen desorption turnovers, aromatics selectivity, and hydrogen selectivity (Table 3). Also, the addition of Zn has a strong effect on the aromatics distribution. On H-ZSM5, toluene is the most abundant product, but benzene becomes the most abundant aromatic product of propene conversion on Zn/H-ZSM5 (Table 3).
3.2. Relative Rates of Propene Hydrogenation (r1)
and Propene Aromatization (r2) The reversibility and rate-determining nature of initial propane dehydrogenation steps were investigated using mixtures of propane-2-13C and unlabeled propene. The re- sults are described using the reactions shown in Scheme 2.
Zn species increase the rate of propane dehydrogenation (r1) (Fig. 2); therefore, they must also catalyze the reverse reaction: propene hydrogenation (r1). Relative rates of propene hydrogenation (r1) and conversion to other prod- ucts (r2) (Scheme 2) can be measured from the rate of isotopic scrambling between propane-2-13C and unlabeled propene and from the isotopic content of the other reaction products. From these data, r2 and r1 values can be obtained as a function of contact time on H-ZSM5 and Zn/H-ZSM5.

The (r2/r1) ratios on these catalysts are almost indepen- dent of contact time (and conversion), but they are higher on Zn/H-ZSM5 than on H-ZSM5; these values (after ex- trapolation to zero conversion) are about 2 on H-ZSM5 and 6 on Zn/H-ZSM5 (Fig. 5). Zn increases the rate of initial propane dehydrogenation steps (r1) and also the rate of its reverse reaction (r1, propene hydrogenation). However, Zn increases the rate of subsequent reactions of propene

(r2) more strongly than it increases r1, leading to higher (r2/r1) ratios. Zn species influence both initial propane de- hydrogenation steps and the subsequent dehydrogenation steps required in order to convert propene to aromatics products.
Ono et al. (1) have reported that the concentration of alkenes decreases with the addition of metal cations (Ga) during propane conversion. They concluded from these data that metal cations increase only alkene aromatization rates. Our data are not consistent with this proposal and support a different conclusion. Metal cations increase

propane conversion rates, but increase propene conversion rates even more, thus decreasing the concentration of inter- mediatealkenesduringpropaneconversionandthe(r1/r2) ratio.
On both H-ZSM5 and Zn/H-ZSM5, (r2/r1) ratios are greater than unity, consistent with a nonequilibrated ini- tial propane dehydrogenation step. In effect, this step becomes even more irreversible (r2/r1 increases) when Zn is introduced into H-ZSM5 catalysts because required subsequent oligomerization, cyclization, and dehydrogena- tion reactions become faster and scavenge alkenes before hydrogenation can occur. As propane dehydrogenation steps become increasingly irreversible, propene concentra- tions decrease and alkenes exit oligomerization/β-scission cycles more rapidly. The chemical and isotopic composi- tions of aromatics on Zn/H-ZSM5 should then resemble those expected from direct dimerization and cyclization of propene and the benzene content within C6-C8 aromatics increases (Tables 1 and 3).
Products of propane-2-13C reactions on Zn/H-ZSM5 sug- gest that alkenes exit from these oligomerization/β-scission cycles more rapidly than on H-ZSM5. On H-ZSM5, ben- zene molecules formed from propane-2-13C contain a bino- mial distribution of 13C-atoms even at very low conversions,instead of the expected single isotopomer with two 13C- atoms (Fig. 6). The 13C atoms have exchanged positions not only within a single C3 moiety, but among several. In effect, C-C bonds in propane have been cleaved and re-formed within both C3 fragments and larger surface chains many times in the time required for an aromatization turnover.
Such a turnover requires the formation of a C6 or larger molecule, a process that involves oligomerization reactions,

FIG. 7.

Products of propane-2-13C reactions on Zn/H-ZSM5 contain sharper 13C distributions,with the predominant presence of benzene isotopomers with the expected two 13C atoms (Fig. 6). Therefore, Zn cations increase the rate of removal of alkenes from these oligomerization/β-scission cycles. This removal must occur by the formation of products, such as aromatics (and H2) and alkanes, which are less reactive than alkenes in acid-catalyzed reactions. These data confirm that subse- quent oligomerization, cyclization, and dehydrogenation reactions are more strongly influenced by exchanged metal cations than the initial propane dehydrogenation step.
Propane-2-13C/propene mixtures lead to similar 13C con- tents in benzene and toluene, suggesting that they are formed from a common pool of alkene intermediates (32).
Thus, (toluene/benzene) molar ratios become an accurate measure of the average size of the alkenes in this pool.
On H-ZSM5, (toluene/benzene) ratios are higher than on Zn-containing catalysts (Fig. 7). If this reduction of the (toluene/benzene) ratio on Zn/H-ZSM5 is due to the de- crease in Bronsted acid sites, higher Zn loadings should re- duce this ratio even further. However, our data show that (toluene/benzene) ratios are independent of Zn loading (0.621.30 wt%) (Fig. 7). Therefore, Zn extracts C6 alkenes before these alkenes are able to crack and re-oligomerize to form a quasi-equilibrated pool of alkenes.
3.3. Isotopic Equilibration of C3H8/C3D8 Mixtures
and C-H Bond Activation Rates Initial propane dehydrogenation steps are not quasi- equilibrated during steady-state propane aromatization on H-ZSM5 and Zn/H-ZSM5 (Section 3.2). Thus, arom- atization proceeds via a sequence of irreversible dehydro- genation reactions with interspersed fast acid-catalyzed H-ZSM5 AND Zn/H-ZSM5 CATALYSTS 123 reactions that lead to chain lengthening/scission with occasional ring closure steps. Consequentially, the overall reaction rate is given accurately by the rate of the initial (ir- reversible) propane dehydrogenation step. Propane dehy- drogenation reactions require elementary steps involving the activation of C-H bonds and the elimination of the H- atoms formed. In this section, we report the relative rates of C3H8/C3D8 cross exchange and chemical conversion. These rates were measured during steady-state propane reactions on H-ZSM5 and Zn/H-ZSM5 using isotopic exchange and chemical reaction rates for C3H8/C3D8 reactant mixtures.
Isotopic mixtures can be used to provide information about the identity of elementary processes and interme- diates (5663). Isotopic tracer studies have also been used to determine the reversibility of C-H bond cleavage dur- ing alkane conversion (14, 32, 57, 6466). In our reaction,isotopic cross exchange rates can be used to determine the rate and reversibility of initial C-H bond activation steps.
This cross exchange rate is only a true measure of the C-H bond activation rate if all propane reactions (dehydrogena- tion, β-scission, and cross exchange) proceed through the same surface species (Scheme 3).
The reversibility of C-H activation steps leading to cross exchange, β-scission, and dehydrogenation can be exam- ined by comparing cross exchange rates to those for (irre- versible) propane dehydrogenation and β-scission steps.
Propane conversion turnover rates were obtained from the total rate of propane conversion (both C3H8 and C3D8) to products because all products are formed after the same initial propane activation step. Cross-exchange rates can be calculated from the concentration of propane isotopomers (C3H8, C3H7D1, C3H6D2, . . . , C3D8) as a function of contact time.
Significant isotopic equilibration occurs between C3H8 and C3D8 on H-ZSM5, even at low chemical conversions (Fig. 8). C3H8/C3D8 cross-exchange occurs by stepwise transfer of single D or H atoms, leading to statistical iso- topomer distributions within both the mostly undeuter- ated and mostly deuterated components in unreacted propane. The initial reaction products of C3H8/C3D8 reac- tant mixtures, propene and ethene, do not contain the two distributions of predominately protium (C2H4, C3H6) from C3H8 and predominately deuterium (C2D4, C3D6) from C3D8, expected of independent reactions of mostly deuter-

Instead, propene and ethene show unimodal binomial deuterium distribu- tions, consistent with statistical scrambling of the H and D atoms contributed by C3H8 and C3D8 reactants, respec- tively (Fig. 9). The isotopic compositions of propene and ethene are less than 50% D (Fig. 9) because propane reac- tions on H-ZSM5 using purely C3H8 or C3D8 feeds show a (rC3H8/rC3D8) kinetic isotope effect of 1.24, indicating that C3H8 reacts preferentially, leading to more protium on the ZSM5 surface after C-H cleavage. These products appear to sample the surface hydrogendeuterium pool and their isotopic content reflects accurately the isotopic composi- tion of this surface pool because C-H bonds have formed and broken many times in the time required for a propane conversion catalytic turnover.
Comparison of the rates of propane cross exchange and propane chemical conversion on H-ZSM5 show that iso- topic exchange occurs much faster than propane conver- sion (Table 4). Thus, if cross exchange accurately reflects the C-H bond activation step, it appears that this C-H bond activation step does not limit the rate of the overall chemi- cal conversion of propane on H-ZSM5.

Propane conversion rates, however, vary by more than a factor of 10 among these catalysts. Thus, initial C-H bond cleavage steps cannot limit propane chemical conversion rates, because Zn species increase propane conversion rates much more than they influence faster cross exchange rates.
The requirement of Bronsted acid sites for C3H8/C3D8 cross-exchange is evident from the data in Table 4. Cross exchange rates are much lower on Na-ZSM5 than on H- ZSM5, suggesting that Na-ZSM5, which lacks protonic sites, activates C-H bonds much more slowly than H-ZSM5.
The rate of C-H bond activation, obtained from C3H8/C3D8 cross-exchange rates, increases by about a factor of 2 when Zn cations are introduced (Table 4), suggesting that Zn may interact directly with propane molecules or that remaining acidsitesbecomemoreactiveforC-Hbondactivationwhen Zn cations reside nearby. Bronsted acid site requirements in C-H bond activation were also examined by Ono and co- workers (25) on weakly acidic Zn exchanged-borosilicates

with pentasil structures. Zn-exchanged borosilicates did not catalyze propane aromatization, but they converted propene to aromatics at significant rates. These data sug- gest that neither Zn cations nor weak Bronsted acid sites in borosilicates can activate C-H bonds in propane by them- selves. These weak acid sites, however, catalyze C-H activa- tion in propene. Zn cations are unable to carry out propane dehydrogenation steps without the concurrent presence of strong Bronsted acid sites, which appear to be involved in the initial activation of C-H bonds in alkanes.
3.4. Reversibility of Hydrogen Adsorption/
Desorption Steps The rate of hydrogen recombinative desorption steps during propane conversion can be measured from the deuterium content in reaction products and in unre- acted propane using C3H8/D2 mixtures as reactants. Quasi- equilibrated desorption steps would lead to complete mix- ing of D-atoms from D2 with H-atoms from propane in all reaction products, because aromatics formed from quasi- equilibrated alkene mixtures would sample statistically a surface hydrogen pool in chemical and isotopic equilib- rium with the gas phase hydrogen (deuterium) pool. In con- trast, irreversible (rate-determining) recombinative des- orption steps would lead to the predominant appearance of H-atoms in reaction products, because of slow communica- tion between gas phase (D2) and surface pools (H-atoms from reacting C3H8) of hydrogen isotopes.
On H-ZSM5, the initial deuterium content in all products of C3H8/D2 reactions is very low (3% D) and independent of conversion (e.g. toluene, propene; see Fig. 10), suggesting that hydrogen adsorptiondesorption steps are irreversible.
The distribution of D-atom isotopomers within each prod- uct formed on H-ZSM5 obeys a binomial distribution,

suggesting that multiple exchange events with a common surface hydrogen/deuterium pool occur during the forma- tion of each reaction product (e.g. propene; see Fig. 11).
Therefore, the deuterium content (3% D) in products re- flects the composition of a surface hydrogen/deuterium pool containing about 3% D and 97% H, instead of the pre- dominant deuterium coverage expected from equilibration with the (initially) pure D2 gas phase (Table 5). The surface hydrogen pool in H-ZSM5 contains mostly H atoms formed in C-H bond activation steps, the removal of which limits the rate of propane dehydrogenation reactions.
Deuterium contents are also very similar within all prod- ucts of C3H8/D2 reactants formed on a given Zn/H-ZSM5 catalyst (Fig. 10). Deuterium distributions are binomial in all products, even though aromatics form after shorter residence times within oligomerization/β-scission cycles on Zn/H-ZSM5 than on H-ZSM5. Deuterium contents de- crease with increasing contact time (or conversion), be- cause of the faster rate of formation of H2 on Zn-containing samples, which dilutes the initially pure D2 gas phase.

The deuterium fraction within all products is much higher on Zn/H-ZSM5 catalysts than on H-ZSM5 (e.g. toluene and propene; see Fig. 10 and Table 5) and it increases with increasing Zn content.
The addition of Zn cations also increases the deuterium contentinunreactedpropane(Fig.12),aresultthatseems surprising in view of the decrease in the reversibility of propane dehydrogenation steps as Zn content increases (Fig. 5). The rate of incorporation of D atoms into un- reacted propane provides an independent measure of the D content in the surface pool. Deuteration turnovers, cal- culated from the number of propane molecules that contain one or more deuterium atoms, increase upon the addition of Zn. These turnovers reflect the rate of the propene hy- drogenation step (r1) weighed by the probability that the hydrogen atom chosen from the surface pool to re-form the C-H bond is a deuterium atom.
3.5. Isotopic Equilibration of H2/D2 Mixtures
The increase in the hydrogen (H2) desorption rate dur- ing propane conversion on Zn/H-ZSM5 suggests that Zn cations catalyze the recombinative desorption of H atoms.
This was confirmed by the higher D contents in the prod- ucts of C3H8/D2 mixtures on Zn-containing catalysts. Thus, Zn cations must also increase the rate of dissocia- tive chemisorption of dihydrogen. Isotopic equilibration measurements using H2/D2 mixtures were conducted on Na-ZSM5, H-ZSM5, 1.07% Zn/H-ZSM5, and 1.30% Zn/H- ZSM5 in order to examine the role of Zn cations in the equilibration of hydrogen isotopes. H2/D2 exchange reac- tions directly probe the rates of H2 (and D2) dissociative 126

The rate of HD formation from H2/D2 reactants is very low on Na-ZSM5 (Fig. 13). Heylen et al. (67) examined the rate of H2/D2 equilibration on Na-Y and NH4-Y and re- ported similar HD formation rates, which they attributed to catalytic impurities. The HD formation rate on our sam- ples increases, however, when Na cations are replaced with protons in ZSM5. It appears that Na titrates sites responsi- ble for H2 dissociation whether these sites consist of defects,impurities, or protons.
Isotopic equilibration rates increase when Zn cations are introduced into H-ZSM5 (Fig. 13). The temperature re- quired to reach equilibration rates (per Al) of 2.5 × 102 s1 (the isokinetic temperature) is 750 K on Na-ZSM5 and 650 K on H-ZSM5. This isokinetic temperature decreases to 554 K and 537 K on 1.07% and 1.30% Zn/H-ZSM5, respec- tively. These results show that dissociative chemisorption of dihydrogen and recombinative desorption of H atoms occur slowly on H-ZSM5, consistent with the lack of deu- terium incorporation in products of C3H8/D2 mixtures.
3.6. Hydrogenation and Hydrogen Transfer
Properties of ZSM5 The presence of Zn increases the rate of H2/D2 isotopic equilibration and the rate of deuterium incorporation into the products of C3H8/D2 reactions. These data suggest that Zn increases the rate of communication between gas phase and surface hydrogen pools. In view of this, we have ex- amined the effect of H2 concentration on propane conver- sion turnover rates and selectivities on H-ZSM5 and Zn/
H-ZSM5.
Propane aromatization rates and selectivities are inde- pendent of H2 pressure (026.6 kPa H2) on H-ZSM5, as also reported by others (24, 31, 42, 46, 52). The isotopic content in reaction products of C3H8/D2 mixtures also shows that neither hydrogen (deuterium) dissociative adsorption nor recombinative desorption occurs readily on H-ZSM5. Hy- drogen desorption steps are irreversible on H-ZSM5 and the surface is covered with protium (97%) from propane activation steps rather than deuterium atoms from the con- tacting gas phase. As a result, gas phase hydrogen species compete ineffectively for available surface sites with H species formed locally in C-H activation steps; the local surface concentration of hydrogen is high because of a re- combinative desorption bottleneck.
On Zn/H-ZSM5, propane conversion turnover rates and aromatic selectivities decrease as H2 pressure increases (0
26.6kPaH2),becauseadsorptiondesorptionsitesprovided
by Zn cations allow gas phase hydrogen pressures to in- fluence surface hydrogen concentrations and the rate of hydrogenationdehydrogenation steps (Table 6). The pres- ence of Zn species allows gas phase hydrogen to dissocia- tively adsorb and to effectively compete for surface sites,thus decreasing aromatics selectivity. Similar results were reported by Mole et al. (24) and Hagen et al. (31) on Zn/H- ZSM5, by Meitzner et al. (12) on Ga/H-ZSM5, and by Roessner et al. (41-42) on Pt/H-ZSM5, suggesting that all these metal cations play similar roles during propane con- version. As Zn cations increase the rate (and reversibility) of adsorptiondesorption steps, surface hydrogen concen- trations and the extent of dehydrogenation of adsorbed intermediates begin to reflect not only the rate at which hydrogen forms in C-H bond activation steps, but also the rate at which it is introduced into the surface via dissociative chemisorption steps involving H2 in the gas phase.

Zn species act as portholes (68) for the desorption of H-atoms; as a result, they also increase the reverse reaction,the dissociative chemisorption of dihydrogen, as shown by the introduction of D atoms in the products of C3H8/D2 mixtures. The presence of H2 in the gas phase and of Zn sites to dissociate it causes Zn/H-ZSM5 to resemble H-ZSM5 catalytically as H2 gas-phase pressures increase. In effect, H-ZSM5 has a high virtual hydrogen surface concentra- tion (69, 70), imposed by its inability to remove the hy- drogen formed in fast C-H bond activation elementary steps. As a result, products tend to be mostly saturated hydrocarbonsonH-ZSM5.AmbientgasphaseH2pressures aremuchlowerthanthosethatwouldbeinequilibriumwith this virtual surface concentration on H-ZSM5. As H2 am- bient pressures increase, the surface of Zn/H-ZSM5 also becomes hydrogen-rich and surface intermediates and gas phase products become increasingly saturated; they resem- ble those formed on hydrogen-rich H-ZSM5 surfaces. This virtual surface concentration of hydrogen can be calculated from C3H8/D2 data (8). These data show that the hydro- gen concentration on the surface of H-ZSM5 corresponds

Hydrogen, aromatics, and β-scission selectivities versus vir- tual pressure calculated for H-ZSM5 and Zn/H-ZSM5 [773 K, 26.6 kPa C3H8, 6.7 kPa D2, 68.0 kPa He, selectivities are at 7.68.3% propane con- version]. to that in equilibrium with a H2 pressure (220 kPa), much higher than that in the gas phase (6.6 kPa) (Table 7). When Zn is added, the virtual surface pressure decreases and gas phase and surface pools communicate more effectively, but they are still not equilibrated even on 1.30% Zn/H-ZSM5.
This virtual surface concentration is inversely related to the hydrogen selectivity and aromatic selectivities during propane reactions (Fig. 14). The H-ZSM5 surface does not react with the gas phase hydrogen because it has such a high local concentration due to hydrogen desorption bottle- necks. As the gas phase H2 concentration becomes similar in magnitude to this surface pressure, the effect of gas phase H2 pressure begins to reduce propane conversion rates and aromatic selectivities.
4. CONCLUSIONS
Modifications of pentasil zeolites with exchanged Zn cations increase turnover rates, aromatic site-time yields,and the rate of hydrogen disposal during ethane, propane,and propene aromatization. The ratio of propene arom- atization (r2) to propene hydrogenation (r1) rates is higher on Zn-containing samples than on H-ZSM5, even though Zn cations increase the rate of dehydrogenation hydrogenation steps (r1, r1). Zn cations not only cata- lyze alkane dehydrogenation (r1), but also alkene conver- sion rates. This is not surprising because aromatization of alkenes (r2) also requires dehydrogenation steps and forms H atoms that are removed by Zn cations.
These Zn cations increase the rates of alkane aromati- zation by increasing the rate of recombinative desorption of the hydrogen atoms formed in C-H activation steps. In effect, C-H bond activation steps that can occur reversibly,but unproductively, on acid site because of unfavorable re- action affinities become coupled with recombinative des- orption on a separate site. These sites communicate with acid sites via rapid migration of H atoms from momen- tary adsorption sites in the vicinity of Bronsted acid sites to Lewis acids sites provided by the exchanged Zn cations.
Hydrogen adsorptiondesorption steps, however, remain irreversible (rate-determining) even on Zn/H-ZSM5 cata- lysts. This proposal is consistent with the rate of H2/D2 iso- topic equilibration and with the predominant presence of 128
