[1] "Although vanadia catalysts have not been used commercially there is a signifi cant literature concerning the dehydrogenation reaction over supported vanadia systems."
[2] "The structure of supported vanadia catalysts under redox reaction condi- tions is directly related to the catalytic performance."
[3] "A number of techniques have been applied to investigate the reduction of supported vanadia catalysts, such as TPR [36-38], X-ray photoelectron spectros- copy (XPS) [35],electron spin resonance (ESR) [39], UV-Vis DRS [40-45], X-ray absorption fi ne structure spectroscopy (XAFS) [46] and Raman spectroscopy [37,47-50]."
[4] "Most of these techniques give information only on the oxidation state of vanadia species."
[5] "However, several recent investigations on supported transition metal oxides [55-58], including vanadium oxides [55, 56] under ambient condi- tions, using both UV and visible wavelength Raman excitations suggest that more complete and sometimes new structural information of supported metal oxides can be achieved by using multiple excitation wavelengths."
[6] "The reason lies in the strong electronic absorptions in the UV and visible wavelength regions exhibited by most transition metal oxides, which make it possible to measure resonance -enhanced Raman spectra."
[7] "By measuring the Raman spectra at several wavelengths,more information can be obtained about the various VOx species in the distribu- tion."
[8] "Moreover, when UV excitation is employed, even Raman spectra from sup- ported VOx at low loadings (< 1 wt%) on oxides having strong fl uorescence are possible because of the avoidance of fl uorescence and enhanced sensitivity [59,60]."
[9] "In addition, the decreased self - absorption effects in the UV region indicated by in situ UV - Vis DRS studies of reduced VOx and CrOx [40-44, 61, 62] suggests that UV Raman spectroscopy may be capable of detecting reduced supported metal oxides."
[10] "Studies on alumina supported catalysts with a range of vanadia weight loadings revealed [63, 64] that isolated VOx species dominated at surface densities below 1 V/nm 2 ; polyvanadates coexisted with monovanadates at surface densities between 1.2 4.4 V/nm 2 ; and V2O5 formed at a surface density higher than 4.4 V/nm 2 ."
[11] "The vanadia densities of the catalysts were 1.1 V/nm 2 for the sample with the 1% loading, 3.7 V/nm 2 for the 3.5% loading and 10.4 V/nm 2 for the 8% loading."
[12] "Only the XRD pattern for the catalyst with the 8% loading exhibited additional charac- teristic peaks of crystalline V2O5 at 2 θ values 26.3 and 34.6 [65, 66]."
[13] "However,analysis by 51 V NMR revealed V2O5 on the 3.5% vanadium as well as on the 8% (Gladden and McGregor, unpublished results)."
[14] "Studies reveal that reduction takes place over a broad range of temperatures and the onset of reduction follows the weight loading with 8%<3.5%<1% but reduc- tion is complete for each sample by 873 K."
[15] "This difference in onset of reduction may be attributed to different reducibilities of vanadia species, monovanadates,polyvanadates and V2O5 coexisting on the catalyst s surface."
[16] "The weight loss at the reduction step increases with vanadia loading: when these weights are translated into oxygen loss we see that there is a 1 :1 relationship between vanadium atoms and oxygen atom loss (Table 15.1)."
[17] "This would suggest a change of 2 in the vanadium oxidation state, so if the vanadium were in a +5 oxidation state before reduction it would be converted to +3 after reduction."
[18] "Using oxygen chemisorption at 293 K and 873 K the average oxidation state of the 1% VOx/alumina was calculated as 3.8, whereas the average oxidation state for the 3.5% VOx/alumina was calculated as 2.6 [31]."
[19] "Both of these fi gures are in excel- lent agreement with the conclusions from the UV - Vis DRS."
[20] "Bulk re - oxidation data in conjunction with thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and TEOM results indicated that the ease of replacing oxygen that had been removed during reduction was 8%>3.5%>1% [31], (Gladden and McGregor,unpublished results)."
[21] "This difference was also seen in the UV - Vis DRS and in TEOM data."
[22] "TEOM data provide information on the quantity of oxygen taken up by the catalysts and on their rate of re - oxidation."
[23] "The rate of catalyst re - oxidation was seen to be greater for the 8 wt% catalyst than for materials of lower vanadium loading (Gladden and McGregor, unpublished results)."
[24] "Once reduced, the 3.5 %V sample did not regain its original state even after high temperature oxidation;however, the reduced 8 %V sample did convert to a species that was similar to the original oxidation state."
[25] "Supported VOx catalysts show good catalytic performance in both oxidation and reduction reactions; for example, they are among the most active and selective simple metal oxides for dehydrogenation and oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes."
[26] "The possibility of using oxide systems other than chromia is being Table 15.1 Extent of oxygen removal during reduction of vanadia/alumina catalysts."

[29] "In essence, the initial dehydrogenation activity increases as a function of surface VOx density."
[30] "However, the activity decreases signifi cantly with prolonged reaction time for samples with VOx density higher than 1.2 V/nm 2 , apparently due to the forma- tion of surface coke deposits and blocking of surface sites during the reaction."
[31] "Interestingly, the dehydrogenation activity remains nearly unchanged on the cata- lysts with surface VOx density no higher than 1.2 V/nm 2 ."

1. The exploration of vanadium oxide-based catalysts as alternatives to Pt and CrOx for paraffin dehydrogenation has been driven by the rich and complex chemistry that is still not yet fully understood, although considerable advances have been made over the last few years. Research in this area has evolved since the 1980s, with a significant literature concerning the dehydrogenation reaction over supported vanadia systems.
2. The structure of supported vanadia catalysts under redox reaction conditions is directly related to the catalytic performance. A number of techniques have been applied to investigate the reduction of supported vanadia catalysts, including TPR, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), electron spin resonance (ESR), UV-Vis DRS, X-ray absorption fine structure spectroscopy (XAFS), and Raman spectroscopy. Most of these techniques give information only on the oxidation state of vanadia species. However, recent investigations using both UV and visible wavelength Raman excitations suggest that more complete and sometimes new structural information of supported metal oxides can be achieved by using multiple excitation wavelengths. The reason lies in the strong electronic absorptions in the UV and visible wavelength regions exhibited by most transition metal oxides, which make it possible to measure resonance-enhanced Raman spectra. By measuring the Raman spectra at several wavelengths, more information can be obtained about the various VOx species in the distribution. Moreover, when UV excitation is employed, even Raman spectra from supported VOx at low loadings (< 1 wt%) on oxides having strong fluorescence are possible because of the avoidance of fluorescence and enhanced sensitivity. In addition, the decreased self-absorption effects in the UV region indicated by in situ UV-Vis DRS studies of reduced VOx and CrOx suggest that UV Raman spectroscopy may be capable of detecting reduced supported metal oxides.
3. Studies on alumina supported catalysts with a range of vanadia weight loadings revealed that isolated VOx species dominated at surface densities below 1 V/nm2; polyvanadates coexisted with monovanadates at surface densities between 1.2 and 4.4 V/nm2; and V2O5 formed at a surface density higher than 4.4 V/nm2. The vanadia densities of the catalysts were 1.1 V/nm2 for the sample with the 1% loading, 3.7 V/nm2 for the 3.5% loading, and 10.4 V/nm2 for the 8% loading. Only the XRD pattern for the catalyst with the 8% loading exhibited additional characteristic peaks of crystalline V2O5. However, analysis by 51V NMR revealed V2O5 on the 3.5% vanadium as well as on the 8%. Studies reveal that reduction takes place over a broad range of temperatures and the onset of reduction follows the weight loading with 8%<3.5%<1%, but reduction is complete for each sample by 873 K. This difference in onset of reduction may be attributed to different reducibilities of vanadia species, monovanadates, polyvanadates, and V2O5 coexisting on the catalyst's surface. The weight loss at the reduction step increases with vanadia loading: when these weights are translated into oxygen loss, we see that there is a 1:1 relationship between vanadium atoms and oxygen atom loss. This would suggest a change of 2 in the vanadium oxidation state, so if the vanadium were in a +5 oxidation state before reduction, it would be converted to +3 after reduction. Using oxygen chemisorption at 293 K and 873 K, the average oxidation state of the 1% VOx/alumina was calculated as 3.8, whereas the average oxidation state for the 3.5% VOx/alumina was calculated as 2.6. Both of these figures are in excellent agreement with the conclusions from the UV-Vis DRS. Bulk re-oxidation data in conjunction with thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and TEOM results indicated that the ease of replacing oxygen that had been removed during reduction was 8%>3.5%>1%. This difference was also seen in the UV-Vis DRS and in TEOM data. TEOM data provide information on the quantity of oxygen taken up by the catalysts and on their rate of re-oxidation. The rate of catalyst re-oxidation was seen to be greater for the 8 wt% catalyst than for materials of lower vanadium loading. Once reduced, the 3.5%V sample did not regain its original state even after high-temperature oxidation; however, the reduced 8%V sample did convert to a species that was similar to the original oxidation state.
4. Supported VOx catalysts show good catalytic performance in both oxidation and reduction reactions; for example, they are among the most active and selective simple metal oxides for dehydrogenation and oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes. The possibility of using oxide systems other than chromia is being explored in an effort to make the alkane-alkene conversion process more selective and stable. V/θ-Al2O3 catalysts with surface VOx density from 0.03 to 14.2 V/nm2 were tested for butane dehydrogenation under low partial pressures of butane at 873 K, and the activity and selectivity data on these different catalysts were compared. In essence, the initial dehydrogenation activity increases as a function of surface VOx density. However, the activity decreases significantly with prolonged reaction time for samples with VOx density higher than 1.2 V/nm2, apparently due to the formation of surface coke deposits and blocking of surface sites during the reaction. Interestingly, the dehydrogenation activity remains nearly unchanged on the catalysts with surface VOx density no higher than 1.2 V/nm2. However, at higher butane pressures, although the behavior of the 1.2 V/nm2 sample is unchanged, catalysts with higher V/nm2 densities show enhanced activity.
5. The regeneration of samples of V/θ-Al2O3 coked from low partial pressure butane dehydrogenation via oxidation was also followed by UV Raman spectroscopy as well as gas chromatography (GC). The Raman spectroscopy indicates that the structure of the VOx species can be restored by oxidation of the coke deposits up to 873 K. UV-Vis DRS, however, suggests that only high-loaded samples are fully restored. 51V MAS NMR confirms the re-oxidation of reduced vanadium species and, as such, spectra of the regenerated catalyst can be acquired. After regeneration, the surface area of an 8%V catalyst was reduced by 50%, a change assigned to transformations in the nature of the support. A similar effect was observed after propane dehydrogenation over a vanadia/alumina catalyst, where a conversion of the γ-alumina support to α-alumina was confirmed by XRD. 27Al triple-quantum (3Q) MAS NMR studies have also demonstrated that the nature of the support undergoes a transformation.

1. 对于石蜡脱氢反应，钒氧化物催化剂作为Pt和CrOx的替代品的探索，是由尚未完全理解的丰富和复杂的化学驱动的，尽管在过去的几年里已经取得了相当大的进展。自1980年代以来，这一领域的研究已经发展，有大量的文献关注于支持的钒氧化物系统上的脱氢反应。
2. 支持的钒氧化物催化剂在氧化还原反应条件下的结构直接关系到催化性能。已经应用了多种技术来研究支持的钒氧化物催化剂的还原，包括TPR、X射线光电子光谱（XPS）、电子自旋共振（ESR）、UV-Vis DRS、X射线吸收精细结构光谱（XAFS）和拉曼光谱。这些技术中的大多数只提供钒氧化物物种的氧化状态的信息。然而，最近使用UV和可见波长拉曼激发的研究表明，通过使用多种激发波长，可以得到更完整和有时是新的支持金属氧化物的结构信息。原因在于大多数过渡金属氧化物在UV和可见波长区域的强烈电子吸收，这使得可以测量共振增强的拉曼光谱。通过在几个波长下测量拉曼光谱，可以获得关于VOx物种分布中各种VOx物种的更多信息。此外，当使用UV激发时，即使在具有强荧光的氧化物上，支持的VOx在低负载（<1 wt%）下，由于避免了荧光和提高了灵敏度，也可以得到拉曼光谱。此外，通过原位UV-Vis DRS研究减少的VOx和CrOx在UV区域的自吸收效应的减少表明，UV拉曼光谱可能能够检测到减少的支持金属氧化物。
3. 对于一系列钒氧化物重量负载的氧化铝支持的催化剂的研究表明，在表面密度低于1 V/nm2时，孤立的VOx物种占主导地位；在表面密度在1.2和4.4 V/nm2之间时，多钒酸盐与单钒酸盐共存；在表面密度高于4.4 V/nm2时，形成了V2O5。催化剂的钒氧化物密度为1%负载的样品为1.1 V/nm2，3.5%负载的样品为3.7 V/nm2，8%负载的样品为10.4 V/nm2。只有8%负载的催化剂的XRD模式显示了结晶V2O5的额外特征峰。然而，通过51V NMR分析，在3.5%的钒上也发现了V2O5，以及在8%的钒上。研究表明，还原在广泛的温度范围内发生，还原的开始遵循重量负载，8%<3.5%<1%，但每个样品在873 K时还原完成。这种还原开始的差异可能归因于催化剂表面共存的钒氧化物物种、单钒酸盐、多钒酸盐和V2O5的不同还原性。在还原步骤中的重量损失随着钒氧化物负载的增加而增加：当这些重量转化为氧损失时，我们看到钒原子和氧原子的损失之间存在1:1的关系。这表明钒的氧化态变化了2，因此如果钒在还原前处于+5的氧化态，它将在还原后转化为+3。使用293 K和873 K的氧化学吸附，1% VOx/氧化铝的平均氧化态被计算为3.8，而3.5% VOx/氧化铝的平均氧化态被计算为2.6。这两个数字与从UV-Vis DRS得出的结论非常吻合。结合热重分析（TGA）和TEOM结果的批量再氧化数据表明，替换在还原过程中被移除的氧的容易程度为8%>3.5%>1%。这种差异在UV-Vis DRS和TEOM数据中也有所体现。TEOM数据提供了关于催化剂吸收的氧的数量和它们的再氧化率的信息。催化剂的再氧化率被发现对于8 wt%的催化剂来说，比低钒含量的材料要大。一旦被还原，3.5%V的样品即使在高温氧化后也没有恢复到原来的状态；然而，减少的8%V样品确实转化为与原来的氧化态相似的物种。
4. 支持的VOx催化剂在氧化和还原反应中都表现出良好的催化性能；例如，它们是脱氢和氧化脱氢烷烃中最活跃和最选择性的简单金属氧化物之一。除了CrOx之外，探索其他氧化物系统，以使烷烃-烯烃转化过程更具选择性和稳定性，这种可能性正在被探索。具有从0.03到14.2 V/nm2的表面VOx密度的V/θ-Al2O3催化剂在873 K下对丁烷的低分压进行了测试，这些不同催化剂的活性和选择性数据进行了比较。本质上，初始脱氢活性随着表面VOx密度的增加而增加。然而，对于VOx密度高于1.2 V/nm2的样品，由于在反应过程中表面焦炭沉积和表面位点的堵塞，活性会随着反应时间的延长而显著下降。有趣的是，在表面VOx密度不超过1.2 V/nm2的催化剂上，脱氢活性几乎保持不变。然而，在较高的丁烷压力下，虽然1.2 V/nm2样品的行为没有变化，但具有较高V/nm2密度的催化剂显示出增强的活性。
5. 通过氧化再生，对低分压丁烷脱氢产生的V/θ-Al2O3样品的焦炭进行了再生，这一过程也通过UV拉曼光谱和气相色谱（GC）进行了跟踪。拉曼光谱表明，通过氧化焦炭沉积物直到873 K，VOx物种的结构可以恢复。然而，UV-Vis DRS表明，只有高负载的样品才能完全恢复。51V MAS NMR证实了减少的钒物种的再氧化，因此，可以获取再生催化剂的光谱。再生后，8%V催化剂的表面积减少了50%，这种变化被归因于支持物性质的转变。在对丙烷脱氢的钒氧化铝催化剂上也观察到了类似的效果，其中γ-氧化铝支持物向α-氧化铝的转化通过XRD得到了确认。27Al三量子（3Q）MAS NMR研究也表明，支持物的性质发生了转变。
