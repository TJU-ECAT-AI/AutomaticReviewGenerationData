1.The variability in intraporous Ga species structure and distribution in H-ZSM-5 zeolites, influenced by factors such as Ga loading and Si/Al ratio, challenges the assumption of uniform PDH activity. The observed non-monotonic relationship between Ga/Al ratio and catalytic performance implies that the true nature of active sites is more complex than previously thought, and optimizing Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts requires a deeper understanding of these factors.

1.受镓负载和Si/Al比等因素影响，H-ZSM-5沸石中镓物种的孔内结构和分布的变异性，对PDH活性均匀性的假设构成了挑战。Ga/Al比与催化性能之间观察到的非单调关系表明，活性位点的真实性质比之前认为的更为复杂，优化Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂需要对这些因素有更深入的了解。
