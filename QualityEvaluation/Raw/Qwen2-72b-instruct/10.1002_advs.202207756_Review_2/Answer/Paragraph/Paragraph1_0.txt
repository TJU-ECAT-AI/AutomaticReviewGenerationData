                The variability in intraporous Ga species structure and distribution in H-ZSM-5 zeolites, influenced by factors such as Ga loading and Si/Al ratio, challenges the assumption of uniform PDH activity \[10.1016/j.jcat.2020.11.004\]. The observed non-monotonic relationship between Ga/Al ratio and catalytic performance implies that simply increasing the Ga loading does not necessarily lead to improved catalytic activity \[10.1016/j.jcat.2020.11.004\]. This is because at higher Ga loadings, the formation of Ga oligomers or the replacement of BAS with Ga becomes less efficient, which could negatively impact catalytic performance \[10.1016/j.jcat.2020.11.004\]. Understanding the true nature of active sites requires detailed characterization of the Ga species present under reaction conditions, as well as their reactivity towards reactants and probes \[10.1016/j.jcat.2020.11.004\]. Optimizing Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts involves finding the optimal balance between Ga loading and BAS density to maximize the formation of active Ga species while minimizing the formation of inactive or less active species \[10.1016/j.jcat.2020.11.004\]. The variability in intraporous Ga species structure and distribution in H-ZSM-5 zeolites, influenced by factors such as Ga loading and Si/Al ratio, challenges the assumption of uniform PDH activity because it shows that not all Ga species exchanged with the BAS are capable of forming Ga hydrides upon reduction \[10.1016/j.jcat.2020.11.004\]. This is clear evidence of the heterogeneity of the exchanged Ga species \[10.1016/j.jcat.2020.11.004\]. The observed non-monotonic relationship between Ga/Al ratio and catalytic performance implies that the true nature of active sites is not simply related to the amount of Ga loaded, but rather to the speciation of Ga, which can be influenced by the BAS density in the zeolite \[10.1016/j.jcat.2020.11.004\]. Optimizing Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts requires understanding the speciation of Ga under reaction conditions, which is dependent on both the Ga/Al ratio and the Si/Al ratio of the zeolite \[10.1016/j.jcat.2020.11.004\].

Optimizing Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts requires understanding the conditions that favor the formation of Ga+H+ pair sites over isolated Ga+ species, as the former are more active in PDH reactions \[10.1016/j.jcat.2020.11.004\].
