          The variability in intraporous Ga species structure and distribution in H-ZSM-5 zeolites, influenced by factors such as Ga loading and Si/Al ratio, challenges the assumption of uniform PDH activity because it shows that the speciation of Ga on the catalyst surface is not homogeneous. The observed non-monotonic relationship between Ga/Al ratio and catalytic performance implies that simply increasing the Ga loading does not necessarily lead to improved catalytic activity. This is because at higher Ga loadings, the formation of Ga oligomers or the replacement of BAS with Ga becomes less efficient, which could negatively impact catalytic performance. Understanding the true nature of active sites requires detailed characterization of the Ga species present under reaction conditions, as well as their reactivity towards reactants and probes. Optimizing Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts involves finding the optimal balance between Ga loading and BAS density to maximize the formation of active Ga species while minimizing the formation of inactive or less active species. The variability in intraporous Ga species structure and distribution in H-ZSM-5 zeolites, influenced by factors such as Ga loading and Si/Al ratio, challenges the assumption of uniform PDH activity because it shows that not all Ga species exchanged with the BAS are capable of forming Ga hydrides upon reduction. This is clear evidence of the heterogeneity of the exchanged Ga species. The observed non-monotonic relationship between Ga/Al ratio and catalytic performance implies that the true nature of active sites is not simply related to the amount of Ga loaded, but rather to the speciation of Ga, which can be influenced by the BAS density in the zeolite. Optimizing Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts requires understanding the speciation of Ga under reaction conditions, which is dependent on both the Ga/Al ratio and the Si/Al ratio of the zeolite. The variability in intraporous Ga species structure and distribution in H-ZSM-5 zeolites, influenced by factors such as Ga loading and Si/Al ratio, challenges the assumption of uniform PDH activity because it shows that not all Ga species exchanged with the BAS are capable of forming Ga hydrides upon reduction. This is clear evidence of the heterogeneity of the exchanged Ga species. The observed non-monotonic relationship between Ga/Al ratio and catalytic performance implies that the true nature of active sites is not simply related to the amount of Ga loaded, but rather to the speciation of Ga in the zeolite. Optimizing Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts requires understanding the conditions that favor the formation of Ga+H+ pair sites over isolated Ga+ species, as the former are more active in PDH reactions.

Optimizing Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts requires understanding the complex interplay between Ga loading, Si/Al ratio, and the resulting Ga speciation, rather than just maximizing Ga content.

          H-ZSM-5沸石中Ga物种的结构和分布的可变性,受Ga负载量和Si/Al比等因素的影响,对PDH活性的均匀性假设构成了挑战,因为它表明催化剂表面的Ga物种的分布并不均匀。Ga/Al比与催化性能之间观察到的非单调关系意味着仅仅增加Ga负载量并不一定会导致催化活性的提高。这是因为在更高的Ga负载量下,形成Ga寡聚物或用Ga取代BAS的效率会降低,这可能对催化性能产生负面影响。理解活性位点的真实性质需要对反应条件下存在的Ga物种及其对反应物和探针的反应性进行详细表征。优化Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂涉及在Ga负载量和BAS密度之间找到最佳平衡,以最大化活性Ga物种的形成,同时最小化不活跃或活性较低的物种的形成。H-ZSM-5沸石中Ga物种的结构和分布的可变性,受Ga负载量和Si/Al比的影响,挑战了PDH活性均匀性的假设,因为它表明并非所有与BAS交换的Ga物种在还原后都能形成Ga氢化物。这是交换Ga物种异质性的明确证据。Ga/Al比与催化性能之间观察到的非单调关系意味着活性位点的真实性质并不简单地与Ga的负载量相关,而是与Ga的物种化有关,这可能受沸石中BAS密度的影响。优化Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂需要理解反应条件下Ga的物种化,这取决于Ga/Al比和沸石的Si/Al比。H-ZSM-5分子筛中Ga物种的结构和分布的变异性，受Ga负载量和Si/Al比等因素的影响，对PDH活性的均匀性假设构成了挑战，因为它表明并非所有与BAS交换的Ga物种在还原后都能形成Ga氢化物。这是交换Ga物种异质性的明确证据。Ga/Al比与催化性能之间观察到的非单调关系意味着活性位点的真实性质并不简单地与Ga的负载量有关，而是与分子筛中Ga的物种化有关。优化Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂需要了解有利于Ga+H+对位点而不是孤立Ga+物种形成的条件，因为前者在PDH反应中更活跃。H-ZSM-5分子筛中Ga物种的结构和分布的变异性，受Ga负载量和Si/Al比的影响，挑战了PDH活性均匀性的假设，因为它表明并非所有与BAS交换的Ga物种在还原后都能形成Ga氢化物。这是交换Ga物种异质性的明确证据。Ga/Al比与催化性能之间观察到的非单调关系意味着活性位点的真实性质并不简单地与Ga的负载量相关，而是与受分子筛中BAS密度影响的Ga物种化有关。优化Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂需要理解Ga负载量、Si/Al比和由此产生的Ga物种化之间的复杂相互作用，而不仅仅是最大化Ga含量。H-ZSM-5分子筛中Ga物种的结构和分布受Ga负载量和Si/Al比的影响，这挑战了PDH活性均匀性的假设，因为研究表明并非所有与BAS交换的Ga物种在还原后都能形成Ga氢化物。这是交换Ga物种异质性的明确证据。Ga/Al比与催化性能之间观察到的非单调关系意味着活性位点的真实性质不仅仅与Ga的负载量有关，而是与分子筛中Ga的物种有关。优化Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂需要了解有利于Ga+H+对位点而非孤立Ga+物种形成的条件，因为前者在PDH反应中更活跃。
