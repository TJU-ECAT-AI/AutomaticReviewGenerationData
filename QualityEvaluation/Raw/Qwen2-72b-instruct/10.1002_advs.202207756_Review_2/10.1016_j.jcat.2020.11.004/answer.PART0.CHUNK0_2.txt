1.The variability in intraporous Ga species structure and distribution in H-ZSM-5 zeolites, influenced by factors such as Ga loading and Si/Al ratio, challenges the assumption of uniform PDH activity because it shows that not all Ga species exchanged with the BAS are capable of forming Ga hydrides upon reduction. This is clear evidence of the heterogeneity of the exchanged Ga species. The observed non-monotonic relationship between Ga/Al ratio and catalytic performance implies that the true nature of active sites is not simply related to the amount of Ga loaded, but rather to the speciation of Ga in the zeolite. Optimizing Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts requires understanding the conditions that favor the formation of Ga+H+ pair sites over isolated Ga+ species, as the former are more active in PDH reactions.

1.H-ZSM-5分子筛中Ga物种的结构和分布的变异性，受Ga负载量和Si/Al比等因素的影响，对PDH活性的均匀性假设构成了挑战，因为它表明并非所有与BAS交换的Ga物种在还原后都能形成Ga氢化物。这是交换Ga物种异质性的明确证据。Ga/Al比与催化性能之间观察到的非单调关系意味着活性位点的真实性质并不简单地与Ga的负载量有关，而是与分子筛中Ga的物种化有关。优化Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂需要了解有利于Ga+H+对位点而不是孤立Ga+物种形成的条件，因为前者在PDH反应中更活跃。
