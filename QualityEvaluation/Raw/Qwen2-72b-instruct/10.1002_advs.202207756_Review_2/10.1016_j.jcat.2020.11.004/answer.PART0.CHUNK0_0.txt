1.The variability in intraporous Ga species structure and distribution in H-ZSM-5 zeolites, influenced by factors such as Ga loading and Si/Al ratio, challenges the assumption of uniform PDH activity because it shows that the speciation of Ga on the catalyst surface is not homogeneous. The observed non-monotonic relationship between Ga/Al ratio and catalytic performance implies that simply increasing the Ga loading does not necessarily lead to improved catalytic activity. This is because at higher Ga loadings, the formation of Ga oligomers or the replacement of BAS with Ga becomes less efficient, which could negatively impact catalytic performance. Understanding the true nature of active sites requires detailed characterization of the Ga species present under reaction conditions, as well as their reactivity towards reactants and probes. Optimizing Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts involves finding the optimal balance between Ga loading and BAS density to maximize the formation of active Ga species while minimizing the formation of inactive or less active species.

1.H-ZSM-5沸石中Ga物种的结构和分布的可变性,受Ga负载量和Si/Al比等因素的影响,对PDH活性的均匀性假设构成了挑战,因为它表明催化剂表面的Ga物种的分布并不均匀。Ga/Al比与催化性能之间观察到的非单调关系意味着仅仅增加Ga负载量并不一定会导致催化活性的提高。这是因为在更高的Ga负载量下,形成Ga寡聚物或用Ga取代BAS的效率会降低,这可能对催化性能产生负面影响。理解活性位点的真实性质需要对反应条件下存在的Ga物种及其对反应物和探针的反应性进行详细表征。优化Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂涉及在Ga负载量和BAS密度之间找到最佳平衡,以最大化活性Ga物种的形成,同时最小化不活跃或活性较低的物种的形成。
