1.The variability in intraporous Ga species structure and distribution in H-ZSM-5 zeolites, influenced by factors such as Ga loading and Si/Al ratio, challenges the assumption of uniform PDH activity because it shows that not all Ga species exchanged with the BAS are capable of forming Ga hydrides upon reduction. This is clear evidence of the heterogeneity of the exchanged Ga species. The observed non-monotonic relationship between Ga/Al ratio and catalytic performance implies that the true nature of active sites is not simply related to the amount of Ga loaded, but rather to the speciation of Ga, which can be influenced by the BAS density in the zeolite. Optimizing Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts requires understanding the speciation of Ga under reaction conditions, which is dependent on both the Ga/Al ratio and the Si/Al ratio of the zeolite.

1.H-ZSM-5沸石中Ga物种的结构和分布的可变性,受Ga负载量和Si/Al比的影响,挑战了PDH活性均匀性的假设,因为它表明并非所有与BAS交换的Ga物种在还原后都能形成Ga氢化物。这是交换Ga物种异质性的明确证据。Ga/Al比与催化性能之间观察到的非单调关系意味着活性位点的真实性质并不简单地与Ga的负载量相关,而是与Ga的物种化有关,这可能受沸石中BAS密度的影响。优化Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂需要理解反应条件下Ga的物种化,这取决于Ga/Al比和沸石的Si/Al比。
