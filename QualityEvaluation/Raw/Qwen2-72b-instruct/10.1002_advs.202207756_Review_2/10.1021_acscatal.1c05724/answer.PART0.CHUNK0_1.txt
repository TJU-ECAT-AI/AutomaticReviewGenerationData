1.The variability in intraporous Ga species structure and distribution in H-ZSM-5 zeolites, influenced by factors such as Ga loading and Si/Al ratio, challenges the assumption of uniform PDH activity. The observed non-monotonic relationship between Ga/Al ratio and catalytic performance has implications for understanding the true nature of active sites and optimizing Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts. However, the specific details of these challenges and implications are not provided in the given literature.

1.受Ga负载和Si/Al比等因素影响，H-ZSM-5沸石中Ga物种的孔内结构和分布的变异性，对PDH活性均匀性的假设构成了挑战。Ga/Al比与催化性能之间观察到的非单调关系对理解活性位点的真实性质和优化Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂具有启示意义。但是，给定文献中没有提供这些挑战和含义的具体细节。
