[1] "A frequent implicit assumption of the reports discussed above is that all intraporous Ga species have a similar structure and PDH activity; thus, the characterization results obtained reflected the properties of all active Ga species in PDH."
[2] "However, this assumption implies that the TOF should be independent of Ga loading and the Si/Al ratio of the H-ZSM-5 support, as long as most Ga enters into the zeolite and sufficient BAS are present: these predictions turned out to be wide off the mark."
[3] "The non-monotonic trend of the PDH rate with increasing Ga loading suggested that a single type of active Ga species dominating PDH activity over the entire range of Ga/Al ratio was unlikely."
[4] "If there were only one type of active Ga species for PDH in Ga/H-ZSM-5, then the density of this species was expected to increase with Ga loading until the thermodynamic driving force for additional Ga to enter the zeolite was exhausted, which would lead to leveling off, rather than falling of PDH activity."

1.The variability in intraporous Ga species structure and distribution in H-ZSM-5 zeolites, influenced by factors such as Ga loading and Si/Al ratio, challenges the assumption of uniform PDH activity. The non-monotonic relationship between Ga/Al ratio and catalytic performance implies that the true nature of active sites is not a single type of Ga species dominating PDH activity over the entire range of Ga/Al ratio. This has implications for optimizing Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts, as it suggests that the density of active Ga species does not simply increase with Ga loading, but rather, the introduction of additional Ga can lead to the formation of less active or inactive Ga species, resulting in a decrease in PDH activity.

1.受Ga负载和Si/Al比等因素影响的H-ZSM-5沸石中Ga物种的结构和分布的变异性，对PDH活性的均匀性假设构成了挑战。Ga/Al比与催化性能之间的非单调关系表明，在整个Ga/Al比范围内，主导PDH活性的并非单一类型的Ga物种。这对优化Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂具有重要意义，因为它表明活性Ga物种的密度并非简单地随Ga负载的增加而增加，而是引入额外的Ga会导致形成活性较低或不活性的Ga物种，从而导致PDH活性的下降。
