[1] "A frequent implicit assumption of the reports discussed above is that all intraporous Ga species have a similar structure and PDH activity; thus, the characterization results obtained reflected the properties of all active Ga species in PDH."
[2] "However, this assumption implies that the TOF should be independent of Ga loading and the Si/Al ratio of the H-ZSM-5 support, as long as most Ga enters into the zeolite and sufficient BAS are present: these predictions turned out to be wide off the mark."
[3] "The non-monotonic trend of the PDH rate with increasing Ga loading suggested that a single type of active Ga species dominating PDH activity over the entire range of Ga/Al ratio was unlikely."
[4] "If there were only one type of active Ga species for PDH in Ga/H-ZSM-5, then the density of this species was expected to increase with Ga loading until the thermodynamic driving force for additional Ga to enter the zeolite was exhausted, which would lead to leveling off, rather than falling of PDH activity."

1.The variability in intraporous Ga species structure and distribution in H-ZSM-5 zeolites, influenced by factors such as Ga loading and Si/Al ratio, challenges the assumption of uniform PDH activity. The non-monotonic relationship between Ga/Al ratio and catalytic performance implies that a single type of active Ga species does not dominate PDH activity over the entire range of Ga/Al ratio. This suggests that the true nature of active sites is more complex than previously thought, and optimizing Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts requires a deeper understanding of the interplay between Ga species, BAS, and the zeolite framework.

1.受Ga负载和Si/Al比等因素影响的H-ZSM-5沸石中Ga物种的结构和分布的变异性,挑战了PDH活性均匀性的假设。Ga/Al比与催化性能之间的非单调关系表明,在整个Ga/Al比范围内,没有单一类型的活性Ga物种主导PDH活性。这表明活性位点的真实性质比之前认为的要复杂,优化Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂需要更深入地理解Ga物种、BAS和沸石框架之间的相互作用。
