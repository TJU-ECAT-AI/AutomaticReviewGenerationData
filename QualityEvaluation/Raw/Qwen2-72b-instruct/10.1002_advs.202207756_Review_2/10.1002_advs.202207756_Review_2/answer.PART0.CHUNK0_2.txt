[1] "A frequent implicit assumption of the reports discussed above is that all intraporous Ga species have a similar structure and PDH activity; thus, the characterization results obtained reflected the properties of all active Ga species in PDH."
[2] "However, this assumption implies that the TOF should be independent of Ga loading and the Si/Al ratio of the H-ZSM-5 support, as long as most Ga enters into the zeolite and sufficient BAS are present: these predictions turned out to be wide off the mark."
[3] "The non-monotonic trend of the PDH rate with increasing Ga loading suggested that a single type of active Ga species dominating PDH activity over the entire range of Ga/Al ratio was unlikely."
[4] "If there were only one type of active Ga species for PDH in Ga/H-ZSM-5, then the density of this species was expected to increase with Ga loading until the thermodynamic driving force for additional Ga to enter the zeolite was exhausted, which would lead to leveling off, rather than falling of PDH activity."

1.The assumption that all intraporous Ga species in H-ZSM-5 zeolites have a similar structure and PDH activity is challenged by the variability in Ga species structure and distribution, influenced by factors such as Ga loading and Si/Al ratio. This variability leads to a non-monotonic relationship between Ga/Al ratio and catalytic performance, suggesting that a single type of active Ga species does not dominate PDH activity over the entire range of Ga/Al ratio. The observed trend implies that the TOF should not be independent of Ga loading and the Si/Al ratio of the H-ZSM-5 support, which contradicts the initial assumption. This has implications for understanding the true nature of active sites and optimizing Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts, as it indicates that multiple active Ga species may exist with varying activities and stabilities under different conditions.

1.关于H-ZSM-5沸石中所有内孔Ga物种具有相似结构和PDH活性的假设，受到Ga负载和Si/Al比等因素影响Ga物种结构和分布的挑战。这种可变性导致Ga/Al比与催化性能之间呈现非单调关系，表明在整个Ga/Al比范围内，没有单一类型的活性Ga物种主导PDH活性。观察到的趋势表明，TOF不应独立于Ga负载和H-ZSM-5支撑的Si/Al比，这与最初的假设相矛盾。这对理解活性位点的真实性质和优化Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂具有影响，因为它表明在不同条件下可能存在具有不同活性和稳定性的多种活性Ga物种。
