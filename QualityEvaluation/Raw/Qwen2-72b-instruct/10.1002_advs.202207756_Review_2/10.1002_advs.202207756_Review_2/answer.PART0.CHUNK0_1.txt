[1] "A frequent implicit assumption of the reports discussed above is that all intraporous Ga species have a similar structure and PDH activity; thus, the characterization results obtained reflected the properties of all active Ga species in PDH."
[2] "However, this assumption implies that the TOF should be independent of Ga loading and the Si/Al ratio of the H-ZSM-5 support, as long as most Ga enters into the zeolite and sufficient BAS are present: these predictions turned out to be wide off the mark."
[3] "The non-monotonic trend of the PDH rate with increasing Ga loading suggested that a single type of active Ga species dominating PDH activity over the entire range of Ga/Al ratio was unlikely."
[4] "If there were only one type of active Ga species for PDH in Ga/H-ZSM-5, then the density of this species was expected to increase with Ga loading until the thermodynamic driving force for additional Ga to enter the zeolite was exhausted, which would lead to leveling off, rather than falling of PDH activity."

1.The variability in intraporous Ga species structure and distribution in H-ZSM-5 zeolites, influenced by factors such as Ga loading and Si/Al ratio, challenges the assumption of uniform PDH activity because the characterization results do not reflect the properties of all active Ga species in PDH. The non-monotonic relationship between Ga/Al ratio and catalytic performance implies that a single type of active Ga species does not dominate PDH activity over the entire range of Ga/Al ratio. This has implications for understanding the true nature of active sites and optimizing Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts, as it suggests that the density of active Ga species does not simply increase with Ga loading until leveling off, but rather, PDH activity may fall after a certain point due to the formation of less active or inactive Ga species.

1.受Ga负载和Si/Al比等因素影响的H-ZSM-5沸石中Ga物种的结构和分布的变异性,对PDH活性均匀性的假设构成了挑战,因为获得的表征结果并没有反映PDH中所有活性Ga物种的性质。Ga/Al比与催化性能之间的非单调关系表明,在整个Ga/Al比范围内,没有单一类型的活性Ga物种主导PDH活性。这对于理解活性位点的真实性质和优化Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂具有重要意义,因为它表明活性Ga物种的密度并不只是随着Ga负载的增加而增加,直到达到平稳,而是PDH活性可能在某个点后下降,这是由于形成了活性较低或不活性的Ga物种。
