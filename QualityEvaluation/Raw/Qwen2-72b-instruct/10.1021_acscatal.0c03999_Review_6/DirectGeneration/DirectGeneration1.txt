Fe oxide-based catalysts have garnered significant attention in the CO2 oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (CO2-ODHP) due to their high performance, reducibility, and unique reaction mechanisms. The choice of support materials plays a pivotal role in enhancing the catalytic activity of these catalysts. Supports not only provide a high surface area for the dispersion of active Fe oxide species but also influence the electronic properties of the catalyst, thereby affecting its reducibility and reactivity. For instance, the use of acidic supports can promote the formation of more active Fe species, while basic supports can stabilize the Fe oxide phases, leading to improved catalytic performance. Moreover, the interaction between the Fe oxide and the support can alter the reaction pathway, facilitating the selective conversion of CO2 and propane to the desired products. Understanding the relationship between catalyst properties, such as particle size, phase composition, and surface chemistry, and their catalytic activity is crucial for the rational design of more efficient Fe oxide-based catalysts for CO2-ODHP. This knowledge can guide the development of novel catalysts with tailored properties that maximize the conversion of CO2 and propane while minimizing the formation of undesired byproducts.
