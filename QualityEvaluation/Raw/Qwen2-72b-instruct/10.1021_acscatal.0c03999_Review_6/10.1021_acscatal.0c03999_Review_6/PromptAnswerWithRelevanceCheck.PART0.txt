Read the questions and answers provided below. First, critically assess the overall relevance of the answers provided to the set of questions asked.

If, upon your assessment, you find that the answers do not contain information that is relevant to the questions asked, stop your review process immediately and respond with a single sentence: "※※※※※※※The provided answers are not relevant to the questions.※※※※※※※". Do not provide any additional explanation or background information, only this sentence should be given as a response in case of irrelevant answers.

If, however, the answers are relevant to the questions asked, proceed to compile answers for each question according to the instructions below. Ensure to aggregate all the relevant answers from the multiple answer results provided in the document, and organize them sequentially by their order number, compiling the corresponding quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question.

If the provided answers' quotes are not differentiated by question, ensure to break them down and assign the quotes to each respective question, outputting them separately within each question's section.

To provide a comprehensive review, differentiate the responses into quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question based on the details given in the 'Answer' XML tags. Structure your review using the XML format showcased below if the answers are relevant to the questions asked:

[1] "H2-TPR results demonstrate that Fe2O3/AC exhibits improved reducibility, and its reduction proceeds through Fe2O3  Fe3O4  FeO  Fe. However, the reducibility of Fe2O3/γ-Al2O3 and hydrotalcite-derived FeMg catalysts is retarded due to the strong interaction between Fe oxide with support. For example, loading Fe2O3 on γ-Al2O3 leads to the formation of a spinel phase FeAl2O3 which is hardly reduced; Fe3+ cations are reduced to Fe2+ ions which are strongly stabilized in the MgO matrix. Clearly, the improved reducibility of Fe2O3 on AC accounts for the obtained high catalytic performance among the catalysts tested, and the redox cycle of Fe oxide likely plays a crucial role in CO2ODHP."

1.The reducibility of Fe2O3/AC is improved, and its reduction proceeds through Fe2O3 to Fe3O4, FeO, and finally Fe. However, the reducibility of Fe2O3/γ-Al2O3 and hydrotalcite-derived FeMg catalysts is hindered due to the strong interaction between Fe oxide and the support. For instance, when Fe2O3 is loaded on γ-Al2O3, a spinel phase FeAl2O3 is formed, which is difficult to reduce; Fe3+ cations are reduced to Fe2+ ions that are strongly stabilized in the MgO matrix. The enhanced reducibility of Fe2O3 on AC contributes to the high catalytic performance among the tested catalysts, and the redox cycle of Fe oxide is likely crucial in CO2ODHP.

1.Fe2O3/AC的还原性得到改善，其还原过程从Fe2O3到Fe3O4，再到FeO，最后到Fe。然而，Fe2O3/γ-Al2O3和水滑石衍生的FeMg催化剂的还原性受到阻碍，因为Fe氧化物与载体之间存在强烈的相互作用。例如，当Fe2O3加载在γ-Al2O3上时，会形成难以还原的尖晶石相FeAl2O3；Fe3+离子被还原为在MgO基质中强烈稳定的Fe2+离子。Fe2O3在AC上的增强还原性促成了在测试催化剂中获得的高催化性能，而Fe氧化物的氧化还原循环在CO2ODHP中可能起着关键作用。
