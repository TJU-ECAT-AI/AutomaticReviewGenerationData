[1] "H2-TPR results demonstrate that Fe2O3/AC exhibits improved reducibility, and its reduction proceeds through Fe2O3  Fe3O4  FeO  Fe. However, the reducibility of Fe2O3/γ-Al2O3 and hydrotalcite-derived FeMg catalysts is retarded due to the strong interaction between Fe oxide with support. For example, loading Fe2O3 on γ-Al2O3 leads to the formation of a spinel phase FeAl2O3 which is hardly reduced; Fe3+ cations are reduced to Fe2+ ions which are strongly stabilized in the MgO matrix. Clearly, the improved reducibility of Fe2O3 on AC accounts for the obtained high catalytic performance among the catalysts tested, and the redox cycle of Fe oxide likely plays a crucial role in CO2ODHP."

1.The reducibility of Fe2O3/AC is improved, and its reduction proceeds through Fe2O3 to Fe3O4, FeO, and finally Fe. However, the reducibility of Fe2O3/γ-Al2O3 and hydrotalcite-derived FeMg catalysts is hindered due to the strong interaction between Fe oxide and the support. For instance, when Fe2O3 is loaded on γ-Al2O3, a spinel phase FeAl2O3 is formed, which is difficult to reduce; Fe3+ cations are reduced to Fe2+ ions that are strongly stabilized in the MgO matrix. The enhanced reducibility of Fe2O3 on AC is responsible for the high catalytic performance among the tested catalysts, and the redox cycle of Fe oxide likely plays a crucial role in CO2ODHP.

1.Fe2O3/AC的还原性得到改善，其还原过程从Fe2O3到Fe3O4，再到FeO，最后到Fe。然而，Fe2O3/γ-Al2O3和水滑石衍生的FeMg催化剂的还原性受到阻碍，因为Fe氧化物与载体之间存在强烈的相互作用。例如，当Fe2O3加载在γ-Al2O3上时，会形成难以还原的尖晶石相FeAl2O3；Fe3+离子被还原为在MgO基质中强烈稳定的Fe2+离子。Fe2O3在AC上的增强还原性是测试催化剂中获得高催化性能的原因，Fe氧化物的氧化还原循环在CO2ODHP中可能起着关键作用。
