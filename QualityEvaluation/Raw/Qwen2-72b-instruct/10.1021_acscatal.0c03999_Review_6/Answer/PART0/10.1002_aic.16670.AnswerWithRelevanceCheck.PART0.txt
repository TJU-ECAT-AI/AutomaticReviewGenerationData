          The document does not provide specific information on how the reducibility and support materials of Fe oxide-based catalysts influence their performance in CO2-ODHP reactions. However, it does discuss the effects of bimetallic interactions on the catalytic reduction of CO2 by propane, which may occur via dry reforming to produce syngas or oxidative dehydrogenation to yield propylene. The study investigates several precious and non-precious bimetallic catalysts supported on reducible CeO2, finding that Pt-based bimetallic catalysts outperform Pd-based catalysts in terms of conversion and stability. The document also notes that the selectivity of FexNiy catalysts toward CO2-ODHP can be modified by changing the Ni content in the bimetallic composition, with increasing the Ni atomic ratio above 1 altering the selectivity to favor the dry reforming pathway rather than CO2-ODHP. CeO2 is described as a readily reducible oxide with the ability to reversibly convert between Ce4+ and Ce3+, which is critical for oxygen exchange properties that are important for CO2 activation. The CeO2 support is crystalline and approximately 33 nm in size, and under reaction conditions for the reduction of CO2 with ethane, the CeO2 lattice undergoes abrupt expansions, indicating an increase in the average Ce-O bond length due to the partial reduction of Ce4+ to Ce3+. These properties of CeO2 as a support material may influence the performance of Fe oxide-based catalysts in CO2-ODHP reactions by affecting the reducibility and stability of the catalysts, as well as the availability of oxygen for CO2 activation. The Fe3Ni1 catalyst, which consists of metallic Ni and oxidized Fe under reaction conditions, is found to favor oxidative C-H bond cleavage via the CO2-ODHP pathway. This suggests that the reducibility and support materials of Fe oxide-based catalysts may play a role in their performance in CO2-ODHP reactions, but further research is needed to fully understand the mechanisms involved and optimize catalytic systems for this process.

          文档没有提供Fe氧化物基催化剂的还原性和支撑材料如何影响其在CO2-ODHP反应中的性能的具体信息。然而，它确实讨论了双金属相互作用对丙烷催化还原CO2的影响，该过程可以通过干重整产生合成气，或通过氧化脱氢产生丙烯。该研究调查了多种贵金属和非贵金属双金属催化剂，它们被支撑在可还原的CeO2上，发现基于Pt的双金属催化剂在转化率和稳定性方面优于基于Pd的催化剂。文档还指出，通过改变双金属组成中的Ni含量，可以改变FexNiy催化剂对CO2-ODHP的选择性，将Ni的原子比提高到1以上会改变选择性，使其更倾向于干重整途径，而不是CO2-ODHP。CeO2被描述为一种可还原的氧化物，能够可逆地在Ce4+和Ce3+之间转换，这对于氧交换性质至关重要，这些性质对于CO2的活化很重要。CeO2支撑材料是结晶的，大约33纳米大小，并且在乙烷还原CO2的反应条件下，CeO2晶格会发生突然的膨胀，表明Ce4+部分还原为Ce3+导致平均Ce-O键长的增加。CeO2作为支撑材料的这些性质可能通过影响催化剂的还原性和稳定性，以及CO2活化所需的氧的可用性，影响Fe氧化物基催化剂在CO2-ODHP反应中的性能。Fe3Ni1催化剂在反应条件下由金属Ni和氧化Fe组成，被发现有利于通过CO2-ODHP途径进行氧化C-H键断裂。这表明Fe氧化物基催化剂的还原性和支撑材料可能在其在CO2-ODHP反应中的性能中发挥作用，但需要进一步的研究来充分理解涉及的机制并优化催化系统以适应这一过程。
