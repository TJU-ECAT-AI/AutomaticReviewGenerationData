However, it does mention that ceria (CeO2) is a good choice of oxide support because it has the ability to store/release oxygen and thus may induce direct CO bond scission of CO2, while also providing available lattice oxygen for coke suppression. The Fe3Ni catalyst, which consists of oxidized Fe and metallic Ni, shows promising selectivity toward propylene via the CO2-ODHP pathway. This suggests that the combination of Fe and Ni on a ceria support can enhance the catalytic activity for CO2-ODHP by promoting the oxidative CH bond cleavage of propane, leading to enhanced performance in CO2-ODHP reactions.", "Chinese": "文档没有提供Fe氧化物基催化剂的还原性和支撑材料如何影响其在CO2-ODHP反应中的性能的具体信息。但是，它确实提到氧化铈（CeO2）是良好的氧化物支撑材料，因为它具有储存/释放氧气的能力，从而可能诱导CO2的CO键断裂，同时提供可用的晶格氧来抑制焦炭的形成。Fe3Ni催化剂，由氧化Fe和金属Ni组成，显示出对通过CO2-ODHP途径生产丙烯的有希望的选择性。这表明Fe和Ni在氧化铈支撑材料上的组合可以通过促进丙烷的氧化CH键断裂来增强CO2-ODHP的催化活性，导致CO2-ODHP反应性能的增强。", "Doi": "10.1038/s41467-018-03793-w"},

However, it does discuss the effects of bimetallic interactions on the catalytic reduction of CO2 by propane, which may occur via dry reforming to produce syngas or oxidative dehydrogenation to yield propylene. The study investigates several precious and non-precious bimetallic catalysts supported on reducible CeO2, finding that Pt-based bimetallic catalysts outperform Pd-based catalysts in terms of conversion and stability. The document also notes that the selectivity of FexNiy catalysts toward CO2-ODHP can be modified by changing the Ni content in the bimetallic composition, with increasing the Ni atomic ratio above 1 altering the selectivity to favor the dry reforming pathway rather than CO2-ODHP. CeO2 is described as a readily reducible oxide with the ability to reversibly convert between Ce4+ and Ce3+, which is critical for oxygen exchange properties that are important for CO2 activation. The CeO2 support is crystalline and approximately 33 nm in size, and under reaction conditions for the reduction of CO2 with ethane, the CeO2 lattice undergoes abrupt expansions, indicating an increase in the average Ce-O bond length due to the partial reduction of Ce4+ to Ce3+. These properties of CeO2 as a support material may influence the performance of Fe oxide-based catalysts in CO2-ODHP reactions by affecting the reducibility and stability of the catalysts, as well as the availability of oxygen for CO2 activation. The Fe3Ni1 catalyst, which consists of metallic Ni and oxidized Fe under reaction conditions, is found to favor oxidative C-H bond cleavage via the CO2-ODHP pathway.
