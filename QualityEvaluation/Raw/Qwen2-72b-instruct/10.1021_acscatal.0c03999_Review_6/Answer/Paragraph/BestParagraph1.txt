The performance of Fe oxide-based catalysts in CO2-ODHP reactions is significantly influenced by their reducibility and the nature of the support materials \[10.1016/S0926-860X(00)00514-7\]. Active carbon has been identified as the most suitable support material for the dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene to styrene in the presence of carbon dioxide, with iron oxide showing the best activity and slower deactivation compared to chromium and copper oxides \[10.1016/S0926-860X(00)00514-7\]. The type of active carbon used and the iron content significantly impact the catalytic behavior, with the optimum amount of iron being 5 wt.% \[10.1016/S0926-860X(00)00514-7\]. Added alkaline metal oxides, such as potassium, enhance the activity of iron oxide supported on active carbon, with the best alkali metal/Fe atomic ratio being 0.1 \[10.1016/S0926-860X(00)00514-7\]. The formation of carbon deposits or gasification of the support after catalytic tests can be attributed to the reaction mechanism and the optimization of catalytic systems for the CO2-ODHP process \[10.1016/S0926-860X(00)00514-7\]. The reducibility of Fe2O3/AC is improved, and its reduction proceeds through Fe2O3 to Fe3O4, FeO, and finally Fe \[10.1021/acscatal.0c03999_6\]. However, the reducibility of Fe2O3/γ-Al2O3 and hydrotalcite-derived FeMg catalysts is hindered due to the strong interaction between Fe oxide and the support \[10.1021/acscatal.0c03999_6\]. The enhanced reducibility of Fe2O3 on AC contributes to the high catalytic performance among the tested catalysts, and the redox cycle of Fe oxide is likely crucial in CO2ODHP \[10.1021/acscatal.0c03999_6\]. Ceria (CeO2) is a good choice of oxide support because it has the ability to store/release oxygen and thus may induce direct CO bond scission of CO2, while also providing available lattice oxygen for coke suppression \[10.1038/s41467-018-03793-w\]. The Fe3Ni catalyst, which consists of oxidized Fe and metallic Ni, shows promising selectivity toward propylene via the CO2-ODHP pathway \[10.1038/s41467-018-03793-w\]. The combination of Fe and Ni on a ceria support can enhance the catalytic activity for CO2-ODHP by promoting the oxidative CH bond cleavage of propane, leading to enhanced performance in CO2-ODHP reactions \[10.1038/s41467-018-03793-w\]. The effects of bimetallic interactions on the catalytic reduction of CO2 by propane have been discussed, with Pt-based bimetallic catalysts outperforming Pd-based catalysts in terms of conversion and stability \[10.1002/aic.16670\]. The selectivity of FexNiy catalysts toward CO2-ODHP can be modified by changing the Ni content in the bimetallic composition, with increasing the Ni atomic ratio above 1 altering the selectivity to favor the dry reforming pathway rather than CO2-ODHP \[10.1002/aic.16670\]. CeO2 is described as a readily reducible oxide with the ability to reversibly convert between Ce4+ and Ce3+, which is critical for oxygen exchange properties that are important for CO2 activation \[10.1002/aic.16670\]. The Fe3Ni1 catalyst, which consists of metallic Ni and oxidized Fe under reaction conditions, is found to favor oxidative C-H bond cleavage via the CO2-ODHP pathway \[10.1002/aic.16670\].

                Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: The findings from the studies discussed in this review suggest that the reducibility and support materials of Fe oxide-based catalysts play a significant role in their performance in CO2-ODHP reactions. Active carbon has been identified as the most suitable support material for the dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene to styrene in the presence of carbon dioxide, with iron oxide showing the best activity and slower deactivation compared to chromium and copper oxides. The type of active carbon used and the iron content significantly impact the catalytic behavior, with the optimum amount of iron being 5 wt.%. Added alkaline metal oxides, such as potassium, enhance the activity of iron oxide supported on active carbon, with the best alkali metal/Fe atomic ratio being 0.1. The formation of carbon deposits or gasification of the support after catalytic tests can be attributed to the reaction mechanism and the optimization of catalytic systems for the CO2-ODHP process. The reducibility of Fe2O3/AC is improved, and its reduction proceeds through Fe2O3 to Fe3O4, FeO, and finally Fe. However, the reducibility of Fe2O3/γ-Al2O3 and hydrotalcite-derived FeMg catalysts is hindered due to the strong interaction between Fe oxide and the support. The enhanced reducibility of Fe2O3 on AC contributes to the high catalytic performance among the tested catalysts, and the redox cycle of Fe oxide is likely crucial in CO2ODHP. Ceria (CeO2) is a good choice of oxide support because it has the ability to store/release oxygen and thus may induce direct CO bond scission of CO2, while also providing available lattice oxygen for coke suppression. The Fe3Ni catalyst, which consists of oxidized Fe and metallic Ni, shows promising selectivity toward propylene via the CO2-ODHP pathway. The combination of Fe and Ni on a ceria support can enhance the catalytic activity for CO2-ODHP by promoting the oxidative CH bond cleavage of propane, leading to enhanced performance in CO2-ODHP reactions.

The Fe3Ni1 catalyst, which consists of metallic Ni and oxidized Fe under reaction conditions, is found to favor oxidative C-H bond cleavage via the CO2-ODHP pathway. Future research efforts could focus on developing new support materials that enhance the reducibility and stability of Fe oxide-based catalysts, as well as optimizing the bimetallic composition to improve selectivity toward CO2-ODHP. Additionally, further investigation into the reaction mechanism and the role of the redox cycle of Fe oxide in CO2-ODHP could provide insights into the optimization of catalytic systems for this process.
