The study investigates several precious and non-precious bimetallic catalysts supported on reducible CeO2, finding that Pt-based bimetallic catalysts outperform Pd-based catalysts in terms of conversion and stability. The document also notes that the selectivity of FexNiy catalysts toward CO2-ODHP can be modified by changing the Ni content in the bimetallic composition, with increasing the Ni atomic ratio above 1 altering the selectivity to favor the dry reforming pathway rather than CO2-ODHP. CeO2 is described as a readily reducible oxide with the ability to reversibly convert between Ce4+ and Ce3+, which is critical for oxygen exchange properties that are important for CO2 activation. The CeO2 support is crystalline and approximately 33 nm in size, and under reaction conditions for the reduction of CO2 with ethane, the CeO2 lattice undergoes abrupt expansions, indicating an increase in the average Ce-O bond length due to the partial reduction of Ce4+ to Ce3+. These properties of CeO2 as a support material may influence the performance of Fe oxide-based catalysts in CO2-ODHP reactions by affecting the reducibility and stability of the catalysts, as well as the availability of oxygen for CO2 activation. The Fe3Ni1 catalyst, which consists of metallic Ni and oxidized Fe under reaction conditions, is found to favor oxidative C-H bond cleavage via the CO2-ODHP pathway. This suggests that the reducibility and support materials of Fe oxide-based catalysts may play a role in their performance in CO2-ODHP reactions, but further research is needed to fully understand the mechanisms involved and optimize catalytic systems for this process.", "Doi": "10.1002/aic.16670"}
