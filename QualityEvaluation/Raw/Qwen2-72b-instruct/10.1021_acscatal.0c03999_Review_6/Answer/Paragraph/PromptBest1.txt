The performance of Fe oxide-based catalysts in CO2-ODHP reactions is significantly influenced by their reducibility and the nature of the support materials \[10.1016/S0926-860X(00)00514-7\]. Active carbon has been identified as the most suitable support material for the dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene to styrene in the presence of carbon dioxide, with iron oxide showing the best activity and slower deactivation compared to chromium and copper oxides \[10.1016/S0926-860X(00)00514-7\]. The type of active carbon used and the iron content significantly impact the catalytic behavior, with the optimum amount of iron being 5 wt.% \[10.1016/S0926-860X(00)00514-7\]. Added alkaline metal oxides, such as potassium, enhance the activity of iron oxide supported on active carbon, with the best alkali metal/Fe atomic ratio being 0.1 \[10.1016/S0926-860X(00)00514-7\]. The formation of carbon deposits or gasification of the support after catalytic tests can be attributed to the reaction mechanism and the optimization of catalytic systems for the CO2-ODHP process \[10.1016/S0926-860X(00)00514-7\]. The reducibility of Fe2O3/AC is improved, and its reduction proceeds through Fe2O3 to Fe3O4, FeO, and finally Fe \[10.1021/acscatal.0c03999_6\]. However, the reducibility of Fe2O3/γ-Al2O3 and hydrotalcite-derived FeMg catalysts is hindered due to the strong interaction between Fe oxide and the support \[10.1021/acscatal.0c03999_6\].

The Fe3Ni catalyst, which consists of oxidized Fe and metallic Ni, shows promising selectivity toward propylene via the CO2-ODHP pathway \[10.1038/s41467-018-03793-w\]. The combination of Fe and Ni on a ceria support can enhance the catalytic activity for CO2-ODHP by promoting the oxidative CH bond cleavage of propane, leading to enhanced performance in CO2-ODHP reactions \[10.1038/s41467-018-03793-w\].

The selectivity of FexNiy catalysts toward CO2-ODHP can be modified by changing the Ni content in the bimetallic composition, with increasing the Ni atomic ratio above 1 altering the selectivity to favor the dry reforming pathway rather than CO2-ODHP \[10.1002/aic.16670\]. CeO2 is described as a readily reducible oxide with the ability to reversibly convert between Ce4+ and Ce3+, which is critical for oxygen exchange properties that are important for CO2 activation \[10.1002/aic.16670\].

                Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: The insights gained from the studies on Fe oxide-based catalysts in CO2-ODHP reactions underscore the pivotal role of reducibility and support materials in catalytic performance. Active carbon emerges as a superior support material, enhancing the activity and stability of iron oxide catalysts.

Bimetallic interactions, particularly with Pt-based catalysts, show promise in improving conversion and stability. The tunability of selectivity in FexNiy catalysts by altering the Ni content suggests a path for optimizing catalytic systems for CO2-ODHP. Future research should focus on elucidating the specific mechanisms involved in the interaction between reducibility, support materials, and catalytic performance. This includes the development of advanced characterization techniques to monitor the dynamic changes in catalyst structure and composition under reaction conditions. Additionally, the exploration of novel support materials and bimetallic compositions that can further enhance the reducibility and stability of Fe oxide-based catalysts is warranted. The optimization of catalytic systems for CO2-ODHP could potentially lead to the development of more efficient and sustainable processes for the conversion of CO2 to value-added chemicals and fuels.

The reducibility and stability of Fe oxide-based catalysts, as well as the availability of oxygen for CO2 activation, are influenced by the properties of CeO2 as a support material \[10.1002/aic.16670\]. The Fe3Ni1 catalyst, consisting of metallic Ni and oxidized Fe under reaction conditions, favors oxidative C-H bond cleavage via the CO2-ODHP pathway \[10.1002/aic.16670\].
                ※※※
                Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: The findings from the studies suggest that the reducibility and support materials of Fe oxide-based catalysts play a significant role in their performance in CO2-ODHP reactions. Active carbon and ceria (CeO2) have been identified as promising support materials due to their ability to enhance the catalytic activity and stability of Fe oxide-based catalysts. The redox cycle of Fe oxide is crucial for the oxidative dehydrogenation process, and the addition of alkaline metal oxides can further enhance the activity of the catalysts. The combination of Fe and Ni on a ceria support has shown promising results in promoting the oxidative CH bond cleavage of propane. Future research efforts should focus on optimizing the reducibility and stability of Fe oxide-based catalysts, as well as exploring the potential of other support materials and bimetallic compositions to enhance the catalytic activity and selectivity for CO2-ODHP reactions. The development of new catalysts with improved performance and stability could lead to more efficient and sustainable processes for the conversion of CO2 to value-added chemicals and fuels.

                    The reducibility of Fe2O3/AC is notably improved, with its reduction proceeding through Fe2O3 to Fe3O4, FeO, and finally Fe \[10.1021/acscatal.0c03999_6\]. However, the reducibility of Fe2O3/γ-Al2O3 and hydrotalcite-derived FeMg catalysts is hindered due to the strong interaction between Fe oxide and the support \[10.1021/acscatal.0c03999_6\]. For instance, when Fe2O3 is loaded on γ-Al2O3, a spinel phase FeAl2O3 is formed, which is difficult to reduce; Fe3+ cations are reduced to Fe2+ ions that are strongly stabilized in the MgO matrix \[10.1021/acscatal.0c03999_6\]. The enhanced reducibility of Fe2O3 on AC contributes to the high catalytic performance among the tested catalysts, and the redox cycle of Fe oxide is likely crucial in CO2ODHP \[10.1021/acscatal.0c03999_6\].

                    The effects of bimetallic interactions on the catalytic reduction of CO2 by propane have been investigated, revealing that Pt-based bimetallic catalysts outperform Pd-based catalysts in terms of conversion and stability \[10.1002/aic.16670\]. The selectivity of FexNiy catalysts toward CO2-ODHP can be modified by changing the Ni content in the bimetallic composition, with increasing the Ni atomic ratio above 1 altering the selectivity to favor the dry reforming pathway rather than CO2-ODHP \[10.1002/aic.16670\]. CeO2, as a support material, may influence the performance of Fe oxide-based catalysts in CO2-ODHP reactions by affecting the reducibility and stability of the catalysts, as well as the availability of oxygen for CO2 activation \[10.1002/aic.16670\]. The Fe3Ni1 catalyst, consisting of metallic Ni and oxidized Fe under reaction conditions, is found to favor oxidative C-H bond cleavage via the CO2-ODHP pathway \[10.1002/aic.16670\].
