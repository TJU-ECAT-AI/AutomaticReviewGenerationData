The performance, reducibility, and reaction mechanism of Fe oxide-based catalysts in CO2-ODHP, with emphasis on the role of support materials and the relationship between catalyst properties and catalytic activity, have been extensively studied \[10.1016/S0926-860X(00)00514-7\]. Active carbon has been identified as the most suitable support material for the dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene to styrene in the presence of carbon dioxide, with iron oxide showing the best activity and slower deactivation compared to chromium and copper oxides \[10.1016/S0926-860X(00)00514-7\]. The type of active carbon used and the iron content significantly influenced the catalytic behavior, with the best support being active carbon (D-90) with the lowest ash content, and the optimum amount of iron being 5 wt.% \[10.1016/S0926-860X(00)00514-7\]. Added alkaline metal oxides raised the activity of iron oxide supported on active carbon, with the best alkali metal/Fe atomic ratio found to be 0.1 \[10.1016/S0926-860X(00)00514-7\]. The formation of carbon deposits or gasification of the support was observed after catalytic tests, which could be attributed to the reaction mechanism and the optimization of catalytic systems for the CO2-ODHP process \[10.1016/S0926-860X(00)00514-7\]. The reducibility of Fe2O3/AC is improved, and its reduction proceeds through Fe2O3 to Fe3O4, FeO, and finally Fe \[10.1021/acscatal.0c03999\_6\]. However, the reducibility of Fe2O3/γ-Al2O3 and hydrotalcite-derived FeMg catalysts is hindered due to the strong interaction between Fe oxide and the support \[10.1021/acscatal.0c03999\_6\]. The enhanced reducibility of Fe2O3 on AC contributes to the high catalytic performance among the tested catalysts, and the redox cycle of Fe oxide is likely crucial in CO2ODHP \[10.1021/acscatal.0c03999\_6\]. Ceria (CeO2) is a good choice of oxide support because it has the ability to store/release oxygen and thus may induce direct CO bond scission of CO2, while also providing available lattice oxygen for coke suppression \[10.1038/s41467-018-03793-w\]. The Fe3Ni catalyst, which consists of oxidized Fe and metallic Ni, shows promising selectivity toward propylene via the CO2-ODHP pathway \[10.1038/s41467-018-03793-w\]. The combination of Fe and Ni on a ceria support can enhance the catalytic activity for CO2-ODHP by promoting the oxidative CH bond cleavage of propane, leading to enhanced performance in CO2-ODHP reactions \[10.1038/s41467-018-03793-w\]. The effects of bimetallic interactions on the catalytic reduction of CO2 by propane have been discussed, with Pt-based bimetallic catalysts outperforming Pd-based catalysts in terms of conversion and stability \[10.1002/aic.16670\]. The selectivity of FexNiy catalysts toward CO2-ODHP can be modified by changing the Ni content in the bimetallic composition, with increasing the Ni atomic ratio above 1 altering the selectivity to favor the dry reforming pathway rather than CO2-ODHP \[10.1002/aic.16670\]. CeO2 is described as a readily reducible oxide with the ability to reversibly convert between Ce4+ and Ce3+, which is critical for oxygen exchange properties that are important for CO2 activation \[10.1002/aic.16670\]. The CeO2 support is crystalline and approximately 33 nm in size, and under reaction conditions for the reduction of CO2 with ethane, the CeO2 lattice undergoes abrupt expansions, indicating an increase in the average Ce-O bond length due to the partial reduction of Ce4+ to Ce3+ \[10.1002/aic.16670\]. These properties of CeO2 as a support material may influence the performance of Fe oxide-based catalysts in CO2-ODHP reactions by affecting the reducibility and stability of the catalysts, as well as the availability of oxygen for CO2 activation \[10.1002/aic.16670\]. The Fe3Ni1 catalyst, which consists of metallic Ni and oxidized Fe under reaction conditions, is found to favor oxidative C-H bond cleavage via the CO2-ODHP pathway \[10.1002/aic.16670\]. This suggests that the reducibility and support materials of Fe oxide-based catalysts may play a role in their performance in CO2-ODHP reactions, but further research is needed to fully understand the mechanisms involved and optimize catalytic systems for this process \[10.1002/aic.16670\].
                    
                    Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: The studies discussed in this review have provided valuable insights into the performance, reducibility, and reaction mechanism of Fe oxide-based catalysts in CO2-ODHP, with a focus on the role of support materials and the relationship between catalyst properties and catalytic activity.

This suggests that the reducibility and support materials of Fe oxide-based catalysts may play a role in their performance in CO2-ODHP reactions, but further research is needed to fully understand the mechanisms involved and optimize catalytic systems for this process. Future research efforts could focus on exploring the use of other support materials and optimizing the composition of Fe oxide-based catalysts to further enhance their performance in CO2-ODHP reactions. Additionally, the development of new characterization techniques and modeling approaches could provide deeper insights into the reaction mechanism and help guide the design of more efficient catalytic systems for CO2-ODHP.
