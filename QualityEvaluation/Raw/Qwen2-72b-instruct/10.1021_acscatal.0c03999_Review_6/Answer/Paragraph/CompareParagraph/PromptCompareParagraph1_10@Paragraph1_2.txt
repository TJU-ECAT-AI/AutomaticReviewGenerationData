Fe oxide-based catalysts have garnered significant attention in the CO2 oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (CO2-ODHP) due to their high performance, reducibility, and unique reaction mechanisms. The choice of support materials plays a pivotal role in enhancing the catalytic activity of these catalysts. Supports not only provide a high surface area for the dispersion of active Fe oxide species but also influence the electronic properties of the catalyst, thereby affecting its reducibility and reactivity. For instance, the use of acidic supports can promote the formation of more active Fe species, while basic supports can stabilize the Fe oxide phases, leading to improved catalytic performance. Moreover, the interaction between the Fe oxide and the support can alter the reaction pathway, facilitating the selective conversion of CO2 and propane to the desired products. Understanding the relationship between catalyst properties, such as particle size, phase composition, and surface chemistry, and their catalytic activity is crucial for the rational design of more efficient Fe oxide-based catalysts for CO2-ODHP. This knowledge can guide the development of novel catalysts with tailored properties that maximize the conversion of CO2 and propane while minimizing the formation of undesired byproducts.

<file-attachment-contents filename="Review B.txt"> 
The performance of Fe oxide-based catalysts in CO2-ODHP reactions is significantly influenced by their reducibility and the nature of the support materials \[10.1016/S0926-860X(00)00514-7\]. Active carbon has been identified as the most suitable support material for the dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene to styrene in the presence of carbon dioxide, with iron oxide showing superior activity and slower deactivation compared to chromium and copper oxides \[10.1016/S0926-860X(00)00514-7\]. The type of active carbon used and the iron content significantly impact the catalytic behavior, with the optimum amount of iron being 5 wt.% \[10.1016/S0926-860X(00)00514-7\]. The addition of alkaline metal oxides, particularly potassium, enhances the activity of iron oxide supported on active carbon, with the best alkali metal/Fe atomic ratio being 0.1 \[10.1016/S0926-860X(00)00514-7\]. The formation of carbon deposits or gasification of the support after catalytic tests suggests a correlation with the reaction mechanism and the optimization of catalytic systems for CO2-ODHP \[10.1016/S0926-860X(00)00514-7\].

                The reducibility of Fe2O3/AC is notably improved, with its reduction proceeding through Fe2O3 to Fe3O4, FeO, and finally Fe \[10.1021/acscatal.0c03999\_6\]. However, the reducibility of Fe2O3/γ-Al2O3 and hydrotalcite-derived FeMg catalysts is hindered due to the strong interaction between Fe oxide and the support \[10.1021/acscatal.0c03999\_6\]. For instance, when Fe2O3 is loaded on γ-Al2O3, a spinel phase FeAl2O3 is formed, which is difficult to reduce; Fe3+ cations are reduced to Fe2+ ions that are strongly stabilized in the MgO matrix \[10.1021/acscatal.0c03999\_6\]. The enhanced reducibility of Fe2O3 on AC contributes to the high catalytic performance among the tested catalysts, and the redox cycle of Fe oxide is likely crucial in CO2ODHP \[10.1021/acscatal.0c03999\_6\].

                Ceria (CeO2) is a favorable oxide support for Fe oxide-based catalysts in CO2-ODHP reactions due to its ability to store and release oxygen, which may induce direct CO bond scission of CO2 and provide lattice oxygen for coke suppression \[10.1038/s41467-018-03793-w\]. The Fe3Ni catalyst, consisting of oxidized Fe and metallic Ni, exhibits promising selectivity toward propylene via the CO2-ODHP pathway, suggesting that the combination of Fe and Ni on a ceria support can enhance catalytic activity by promoting oxidative CH bond cleavage of propane \[10.1038/s41467-018-03793-w\].

                The effects of bimetallic interactions on the catalytic reduction of CO2 by propane have been explored, with Pt-based bimetallic catalysts outperforming Pd-based catalysts in terms of conversion and stability \[10.1002/aic.16670\]. The selectivity of FexNiy catalysts toward CO2-ODHP can be modified by changing the Ni content in the bimetallic composition, with increasing the Ni atomic ratio above 1 altering the selectivity to favor the dry reforming pathway rather than CO2-ODHP \[10.1002/aic.16670\]. CeO2, as a support material, may influence the performance of Fe oxide-based catalysts in CO2-ODHP reactions by affecting the reducibility and stability of the catalysts, as well as the availability of oxygen for CO2 activation \[10.1002/aic.16670\]. The Fe3Ni1 catalyst, consisting of metallic Ni and oxidized Fe under reaction conditions, favors oxidative C-H bond cleavage via the CO2-ODHP pathway, indicating the role of reducibility and support materials in their performance in CO2-ODHP reactions \[10.1002/aic.16670\].
                
                Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: The insights gained from the studies on Fe oxide-based catalysts in CO2-ODHP reactions underscore the pivotal role of reducibility and support materials in catalytic performance. Active carbon emerges as a superior support material, enhancing the activity and stability of iron oxide catalysts. The redox cycle of Fe oxide, particularly on active carbon, is crucial for high catalytic performance. Ceria, with its oxygen storage and release properties, offers a promising alternative as a support material, potentially enabling direct CO bond scission of CO2 and providing lattice oxygen for coke suppression. The combination of Fe and Ni on ceria support enhances the catalytic activity for CO2-ODHP by promoting oxidative CH bond cleavage of propane. Bimetallic interactions, particularly with Pt-based catalysts, show promise in improving conversion and stability. The tunability of selectivity in FexNiy catalysts by altering the Ni content suggests a path for optimizing catalytic systems for CO2-ODHP. Future research should focus on elucidating the specific mechanisms involved in the interaction between reducibility, support materials, and catalytic performance. This includes the development of advanced characterization techniques to monitor the dynamic changes in catalyst structure and composition under reaction conditions. Additionally, the exploration of novel support materials and bimetallic compositions that can further enhance the reducibility and stability of Fe oxide-based catalysts is warranted. The optimization of catalytic systems for CO2-ODHP could potentially lead to the development of more efficient and sustainable processes for the conversion of CO2 to value-added chemicals and fuels.
