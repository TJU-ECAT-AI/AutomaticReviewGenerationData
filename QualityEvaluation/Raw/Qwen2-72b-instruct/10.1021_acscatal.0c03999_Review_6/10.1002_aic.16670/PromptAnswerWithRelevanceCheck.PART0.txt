1.The document does not provide specific information on how the reducibility and support materials of Fe oxide-based catalysts influence their performance in CO2-ODHP reactions. However, it does discuss the effects of bimetallic interactions on the catalytic reduction of CO2 by propane, which may occur via dry reforming to produce syngas or oxidative dehydrogenation to yield propylene. The study investigates several precious and non-precious bimetallic catalysts supported on reducible CeO2, finding that Pt-based bimetallic catalysts outperform Pd-based catalysts in terms of conversion and stability. The document also notes that the selectivity of FexNiy catalysts toward CO2-ODHP can be modified by changing the Ni content in the bimetallic composition, with increasing the Ni atomic ratio above 1 altering the selectivity to favor the dry reforming pathway rather than CO2-ODHP.

1.文档没有提供Fe氧化物基催化剂的还原性和支撑材料如何影响其在CO2-ODHP反应中的性能的具体信息。然而，它确实讨论了双金属相互作用对丙烷催化还原CO2的影响，这可能通过干重整产生合成气，或通过氧化脱氢产生丙烯。该研究调查了多种贵金属和非贵金属双金属催化剂，它们被支撑在可还原的CeO2上，发现基于Pt的双金属催化剂在转化率和稳定性方面优于基于Pd的催化剂。该文件还指出，FexNiy催化剂对CO2-ODHP的选择性可以通过改变双金属组成中的Ni含量来修改，将Ni原子比提高到1以上会改变选择性，使其更倾向于干重整途径，而不是CO2-ODHP。

1.The document does not provide specific information on how the reducibility and support materials of Fe oxide-based catalysts influence their performance in CO2-ODHP reactions. However, it does discuss the use of CeO2 as a support material for bimetallic catalysts in the reduction of CO2 by propane. CeO2 is described as a readily reducible oxide with the ability to reversibly convert between Ce4+ and Ce3+, which is critical for oxygen exchange properties that are important for CO2 activation. The document also notes that the CeO2 support is crystalline and approximately 33 nm in size, and that under reaction conditions for the reduction of CO2 with ethane, the CeO2 lattice undergoes abrupt expansions, indicating an increase in the average Ce-O bond length due to the partial reduction of Ce4+ to Ce3+. These properties of CeO2 as a support material may influence the performance of Fe oxide-based catalysts in CO2-ODHP reactions by affecting the reducibility and stability of the catalysts, as well as the availability of oxygen for CO2 activation.

1.文档没有提供Fe氧化物基催化剂的还原性和支撑材料如何影响其在CO2-ODHP反应中的性能的具体信息。但是，它确实讨论了CeO2作为双金属催化剂的支撑材料在丙烷还原CO2中的应用。CeO2被描述为一种可还原的氧化物，能够可逆地在Ce4+和Ce3+之间转换，这对于氧交换性质至关重要，这些性质对于CO2的活化很重要。文档还指出，CeO2支撑材料是结晶的，大约33纳米大小，并且在乙烷还原CO2的反应条件下，CeO2晶格会发生突然的膨胀，表明Ce4+部分还原为Ce3+导致平均Ce-O键长的增加。CeO2作为支撑材料的这些性质可能通过影响催化剂的还原性和稳定性，以及CO2活化所需的氧的可用性，影响Fe氧化物基催化剂在CO2-ODHP反应中的性能。

1.The document does not provide specific information on how the reducibility and support materials of Fe oxide-based catalysts influence their performance in CO2-ODHP reactions. However, it does mention that CeO2 is a readily reducible oxide with the ability to reversibly convert between Ce4+ and Ce3+, which is well known for oxygen exchange properties that are critical for CO2 activation. The document also discusses the effects of bimetallic interactions on the catalytic reduction of CO2 by propane, and how these interactions can influence the selectivity of the catalysts for either dry reforming or oxidative dehydrogenation. The Fe-containing catalysts with Pt1 and Pd1 were CO2-ODHP catalysts due to their ability to produce propylene, but these combinations exhibited the lowest conversion. The Fe3Pt1 catalyst was active and at steady state illustrated 2.6% and 1.1% CO2 and C3H8 conversion, respectively, with 32% and 65% C3H6 and CO selectivities, respectively. The Fe3Pd1 catalyst quickly deactivated within the first 2 hours on stream while exhibiting C3H6 selectivity greater than 50%. The in situ XANES results revealed that the Fe3Ni1 catalyst consisted mainly of metallic Ni and oxidized Fe, which may be the cause of the observed lower steady state activity and stability.

The document also discusses the effects of bimetallic interactions on the performance of catalysts in CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation and dry reforming of propane. The Fe3Ni1 catalyst, which consists of metallic Ni and oxidized Fe under reaction conditions, is found to favor oxidative C-H bond cleavage via the CO2-ODHP pathway. This suggests that the reducibility and support materials of Fe oxide-based catalysts may play a role in their performance in CO2-ODHP reactions, but further research is needed to fully understand the mechanisms involved and optimize catalytic systems for this process.
