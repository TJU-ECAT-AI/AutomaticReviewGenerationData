1.The document does not provide specific information on how the reducibility and support materials of Fe oxide-based catalysts influence their performance in CO2-ODHP reactions. However, it does discuss the use of CeO2 as a support material for bimetallic catalysts in the reduction of CO2 by propane. CeO2 is described as a readily reducible oxide with the ability to reversibly convert between Ce4+ and Ce3+, which is critical for oxygen exchange properties that are important for CO2 activation. The document also notes that the CeO2 support is crystalline and approximately 33 nm in size, and that under reaction conditions for the reduction of CO2 with ethane, the CeO2 lattice undergoes abrupt expansions, indicating an increase in the average Ce-O bond length due to the partial reduction of Ce4+ to Ce3+. These properties of CeO2 as a support material may influence the performance of Fe oxide-based catalysts in CO2-ODHP reactions by affecting the reducibility and stability of the catalysts, as well as the availability of oxygen for CO2 activation.

1.文档没有提供Fe氧化物基催化剂的还原性和支撑材料如何影响其在CO2-ODHP反应中的性能的具体信息。但是，它确实讨论了CeO2作为双金属催化剂的支撑材料在丙烷还原CO2中的应用。CeO2被描述为一种可还原的氧化物，能够可逆地在Ce4+和Ce3+之间转换，这对于氧交换性质至关重要，这些性质对于CO2的活化很重要。文档还指出，CeO2支撑材料是结晶的，大约33纳米大小，并且在乙烷还原CO2的反应条件下，CeO2晶格会发生突然的膨胀，表明Ce4+部分还原为Ce3+导致平均Ce-O键长的增加。CeO2作为支撑材料的这些性质可能通过影响催化剂的还原性和稳定性，以及CO2活化所需的氧的可用性，影响Fe氧化物基催化剂在CO2-ODHP反应中的性能。
