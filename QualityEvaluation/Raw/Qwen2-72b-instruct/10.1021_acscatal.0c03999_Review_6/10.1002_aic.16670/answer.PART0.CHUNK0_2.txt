1.The document does not provide specific information on how the reducibility and support materials of Fe oxide-based catalysts influence their performance in CO2-ODHP reactions. However, it does mention that CeO2 is a readily reducible oxide with the ability to reversibly convert between Ce4+ and Ce3+, which is well known for oxygen exchange properties that are critical for CO2 activation. The document also discusses the effects of bimetallic interactions on the catalytic reduction of CO2 by propane, and how these interactions can influence the selectivity of the catalysts for either dry reforming or oxidative dehydrogenation. The Fe-containing catalysts with Pt1 and Pd1 were CO2-ODHP catalysts due to their ability to produce propylene, but these combinations exhibited the lowest conversion. The Fe3Pt1 catalyst was active and at steady state illustrated 2.6% and 1.1% CO2 and C3H8 conversion, respectively, with 32% and 65% C3H6 and CO selectivities, respectively. The Fe3Pd1 catalyst quickly deactivated within the first 2 hours on stream while exhibiting C3H6 selectivity greater than 50%. The in situ XANES results revealed that the Fe3Ni1 catalyst consisted mainly of metallic Ni and oxidized Fe, which may be the cause of the observed lower steady state activity and stability.

1.文档没有提供Fe氧化物基催化剂的还原性和支撑材料如何影响其在CO2-ODHP反应中的性能的具体信息。但是，它确实提到CeO2是一种可还原的氧化物，具有可逆地在Ce4+和Ce3+之间转换的能力，这在CO2活化中对氧气交换性质至关重要。文档还讨论了双金属相互作用对丙烷催化还原CO2的影响，以及这些相互作用如何影响催化剂对干重整或氧化脱氢的选择性。含Fe的催化剂与Pt1和Pd1结合，由于它们能够产生丙烯，因此是CO2-ODHP催化剂，但这些组合表现出最低的转化率。Fe3Pt1催化剂是活性的，在稳态下，CO2和C3H8的转化率分别为2.6%和1.1%，C3H6和CO的选择性分别为32%和65%。Fe3Pd1催化剂在前2小时内迅速失活，同时表现出大于50%的C3H6选择性。原位XANES结果表明，Fe3Ni1催化剂主要由金属Ni和氧化Fe组成，这可能是观察到的较低稳态活性和稳定性的原因。
