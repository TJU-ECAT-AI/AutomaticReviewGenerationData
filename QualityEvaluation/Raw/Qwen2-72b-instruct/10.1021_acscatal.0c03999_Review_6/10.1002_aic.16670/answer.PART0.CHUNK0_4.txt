1.The document does not provide specific information on how the reducibility and support materials of Fe oxide-based catalysts influence their performance in CO2-ODHP reactions. However, it does mention that CeO2 is a readily reducible oxide with the ability to reversibly convert between Ce4+ and Ce3+, and is well known for oxygen exchange properties that are critical for CO2 activation. The document also discusses the effects of bimetallic interactions on the performance of catalysts in CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation and dry reforming of propane. The Fe3Ni1 catalyst, which consists of metallic Ni and oxidized Fe under reaction conditions, is found to favor oxidative C-H bond cleavage via the CO2-ODHP pathway. This suggests that the reducibility and support materials of Fe oxide-based catalysts may play a role in their performance in CO2-ODHP reactions, but further research is needed to fully understand the mechanisms involved and optimize catalytic systems for this process.

1.文档没有提供Fe氧化物基催化剂的还原性和支撑材料如何影响其在CO2-ODHP反应中的性能的具体信息。但是，它确实提到CeO2是一种可还原的氧化物，能够可逆地在Ce4+和Ce3+之间转换，并且以其对CO2活化至关重要的氧交换性质而闻名。文档还讨论了双金属相互作用对催化剂在CO2辅助的丙烷氧化脱氢和干重整中的性能的影响。Fe3Ni1催化剂在反应条件下由金属Ni和氧化Fe组成，被发现有利于通过CO2-ODHP途径进行氧化C-H键断裂。这表明Fe氧化物基催化剂的还原性和支撑材料可能在其在CO2-ODHP反应中的性能中发挥作用，但需要进一步的研究来充分理解涉及的机制并优化催化系统以适应这一过程。
