1.The document does not provide specific information on how the reducibility and support materials of Fe oxide-based catalysts influence their performance in CO2-ODHP reactions. However, it does mention that active carbon was found to be the best support material for the dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene to styrene in the presence of carbon dioxide. Among the transition metal oxides tested, iron oxide showed the best activity and slower deactivation compared to chromium and copper oxides. The optimum amount of iron was found to be 5 wt.%. The introduction of alkaline metal oxides as promoters also raised the activity of the iron oxide catalysts. These findings suggest that the reducibility and support materials of Fe oxide-based catalysts do play a significant role in their performance in CO2-ODHP reactions, but further details on the specific mechanisms are not provided in the document.

1.文件没有提供关于Fe氧化物基催化剂的还原性和支撑材料如何影响其在CO2-ODHP反应中的性能的具体信息。然而，它确实提到，在二氧化碳存在下，活性碳被发现是苯乙烯脱氢制乙苯的最佳支撑材料。在测试的过渡金属氧化物中，铁氧化物显示出最佳的活性和较慢的失活，与铬和铜氧化物相比。铁的最佳量被发现为5 wt.%。引入碱金属氧化物作为促进剂也提高了铁氧化物催化剂的活性。这些发现表明，Fe氧化物基催化剂的还原性和支撑材料确实对其在CO2-ODHP反应中的性能起着重要作用，但关于具体机制的更多细节在文件中没有提供。
