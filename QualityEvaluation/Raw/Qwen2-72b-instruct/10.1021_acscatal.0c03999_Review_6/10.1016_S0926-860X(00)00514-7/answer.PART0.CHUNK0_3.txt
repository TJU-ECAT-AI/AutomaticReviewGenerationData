1.The document does not provide specific information on how the reducibility and support materials of Fe oxide-based catalysts influence their performance in CO2-ODHP reactions. However, it does mention that active carbon was found to be the most suitable support material for Fe oxide catalysts in the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene with carbon dioxide. The optimum amount of iron was found to be 5 wt.%. Added alkaline metal oxides, such as potassium, raised the activity of iron oxide supported on active carbon. The best alkali metal/Fe atomic ratio was found to be 0.1. These findings suggest that the reducibility and support materials of Fe oxide-based catalysts can significantly impact their performance in CO2-ODHP reactions, and optimizing these factors can lead to improved catalytic activity and stability.

1.文档没有提供Fe氧化物基催化剂的还原性和支撑材料如何影响其在CO2-ODHP反应中的性能的具体信息。但是，它确实提到，在乙苯与二氧化碳的氧化脱氢反应中，发现活性炭是最适合Fe氧化物催化剂的支撑材料。发现铁的最佳含量为5 wt.%。添加的碱金属氧化物，如钾，提高了活性炭支撑的铁氧化物的活性。发现最佳的碱金属/Fe原子比为0.1。这些发现表明，Fe氧化物基催化剂的还原性和支撑材料可以显著影响其在CO2-ODHP反应中的性能，优化这些因素可以导致催化活性和稳定性的提高。
