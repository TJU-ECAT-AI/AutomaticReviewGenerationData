1.The document does not provide specific information on how the reducibility and support materials of Fe oxide-based catalysts influence their performance in CO2-ODHP reactions. However, it does state that active carbon was found to be the most suitable support material for the dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene to styrene in the presence of carbon dioxide. Among the transition metal oxides tested, iron oxide showed the best activity and stability. The introduction of alkali metal oxides as promoters further enhanced the activity of the iron oxide catalysts. These findings suggest that the reducibility of the Fe oxide and the nature of the support material play crucial roles in the catalytic performance for CO2-ODHP reactions. The proposed reaction mechanism involving the formation of potassium ferrite as the active phase is supported by the observed correlation between the surface concentration of potassium and the catalyst activity.

1.文档没有提供关于Fe氧化物基催化剂的还原性和支撑材料如何影响其在CO2-ODHP反应中的性能的具体信息。但是，它确实指出，活性碳被发现是存在二氧化碳的情况下将乙苯脱氢为苯乙烯的最合适的支撑材料。在测试的过渡金属氧化物中，铁氧化物显示出最佳的活性和稳定性。碱金属氧化物作为促进剂的引入进一步增强了铁氧化物催化剂的活性。这些发现表明，Fe氧化物的还原性和支撑材料的性质在CO2-ODHP反应的催化性能中起着关键作用。所提出的涉及钾铁酸盐作为活性相的反应机制得到了表面钾浓度与催化剂活性之间观察到的相关性的支持。
