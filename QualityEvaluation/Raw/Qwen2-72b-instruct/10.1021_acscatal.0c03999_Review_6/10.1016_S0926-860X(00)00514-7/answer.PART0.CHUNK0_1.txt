1.The document does not provide specific information on how the reducibility and support materials of Fe oxide-based catalysts influence their performance in CO2-ODHP reactions. However, it does mention that active carbon was found to be the best support material for the dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene to styrene in the presence of carbon dioxide. Among the transition metal oxides tested, iron oxide showed the best activity and slower deactivation compared to chromium and copper oxides supported on active carbon. The optimum amount of iron was found to be 5 wt.%. Added alkaline metal oxides, such as potassium, raised the activity of iron oxide supported on active carbon, with the best atomic ratio of alkali metal to iron being 0.1. These findings suggest that the reducibility and support materials of Fe oxide-based catalysts play a significant role in their performance in CO2-ODHP reactions, and optimizing these factors can lead to improved catalytic systems for this process.

1.文档没有提供Fe氧化物基催化剂的还原性和支撑材料如何影响其在CO2-ODHP反应中的性能的具体信息。但是，它确实提到活性碳被发现是在二氧化碳存在下将乙苯脱氢成苯乙烯的最佳支撑材料。在测试的过渡金属氧化物中，铁氧化物显示出最佳的活性和比在活性碳上支持的铬和铜氧化物更慢的失活。铁的最佳量被发现为5 wt.%。添加的碱金属氧化物，如钾，提高了在活性碳上支持的铁氧化物的活性，碱金属与铁的最佳原子比为0.1。这些发现表明，Fe氧化物基催化剂的还原性和支撑材料在其CO2-ODHP反应中的性能中起着重要作用，优化这些因素可以导致这种过程的改进的催化系统。
