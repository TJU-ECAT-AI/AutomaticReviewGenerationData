1.The document does not provide specific information on how the reducibility and support materials of Fe oxide-based catalysts influence their performance in CO2-ODHP reactions. However, it does state that active carbon was found to be the most suitable support material for the dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene to styrene in the presence of carbon dioxide. The introduction of Fe, Cr, or Cu oxides on active carbon supports led to active catalysts, with iron oxide showing the best activity and slower deactivation compared to chromium and copper oxides. The type of active carbon used and the iron content significantly influenced the catalytic behavior. The best support was active carbon (D-90) with the lowest ash content, and the optimum amount of iron was 5 wt.%. Added alkaline metal oxides raised the activity of iron oxide supported on active carbon, with the best alkali metal/Fe atomic ratio found to be 0.1. The formation of carbon deposits or gasification of the support was observed after catalytic tests, which could be attributed to the reaction mechanism and the optimization of catalytic systems for the CO2-ODHP process.

1.文档没有提供Fe氧化物基催化剂的还原性和支撑材料如何影响其在CO2-ODHP反应中的性能的具体信息。但是，它确实指出，发现活性碳是在二氧化碳存在下将乙苯脱氢为苯乙烯的最合适的支撑材料。在活性碳支撑上引入Fe、Cr或Cu氧化物导致活性催化剂，其中铁氧化物显示出最佳的活性和比铬和铜氧化物更慢的失活。所用活性碳的类型和铁含量对催化行为有显著影响。最好的支撑材料是具有最低灰分含量的活性碳(D-90)，铁的最佳含量在所有情况下都是5 wt.%。添加的碱金属氧化物提高了铁氧化物在活性碳上的活性，发现最佳的碱金属/Fe原子比为0.1。在催化测试后观察到碳沉积物的形成或支撑材料的气化，这可能归因于反应机制和CO2-ODHP过程催化系统的优化。
