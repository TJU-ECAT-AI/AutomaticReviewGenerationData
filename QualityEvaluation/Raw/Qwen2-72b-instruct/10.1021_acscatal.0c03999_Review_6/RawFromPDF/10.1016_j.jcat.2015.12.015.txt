A series of WOx–VOx catalysts supported on porous silica, with W/V molar ratios between 0 and 0.6, are
examined for propane dehydrogenation in the presence and absence of CO2 from 500 C to 600 C and at
atmospheric pressure. Catalysts characterization using temperature programmed reduction (H2-TPR),
temperature programmed oxidation (CO2-TPO), Raman spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction and transmission
electron microscopy shows that the combination of the two metal components allows retention of VOx
dispersion during the reaction.
CO2 has the ability to oxidize V2O3 to V2O4 and participates in the oxidative dehydrogenation of pro-
pane to propylene. When the reaction is carried out with D2 present in the feed together with C3H8
and CO2 (D2:C3H8:CO2 = 1:1:1), only 45% of the resulting water contains D2O. This conﬁrms that the reac-
tion follows the oxidative dehydrogenation route of propane but is also accompanied by the reverse
water gas shift reaction in combination with the non-oxidative dehydrogenation route. Moreover, one
of the major roles of CO2 is the suppression of the formation of surface carbon. A partially reduced vana-
dia dimer was used to represent the active site and density functional theory (DFT) calculations were per-
formed. This allowed to conﬁrm that propane dehydrogenation in the presence of CO2 can proceed
simultaneously via direct oxidative dehydrogenation and non-oxidative dehydrogenation followed by
the reverse water gas shift reaction. According to the DFT-calculated Gibbs free energy proﬁle at
600 C, the activation of the secondary CAH bond of propane (EDFT,act = 158 kJ/mol) is rate-limiting, while
re-oxidation of the catalyst with CO2 is potentially much faster.
The catalyst with a W/V = 0.1 M ratio has the highest C3H6 average turnover frequency but higher selec-
tivities were obtained with W/V = 0.6. In agreement with the value predicted from DFT, the experimental
apparent activation energy for all investigated W/V ratios is similar and varies from 127 ± 11 kJ/mol to
147 ± 12 kJ/mol with W/V molar ratios between 0 and 0.6.

1. Introduction
The demand for oleﬁns, especially propylene, is expected to
increase signiﬁcantly in the near future. Steam cracking, Fluid Cat-
alytic Cracking (FCC) and dehydrogenation (DH) are the primary
methods to obtain oleﬁns. Although these methods are commonly
used to produce alkenes, they have some disadvantages: they are
endothermic and suffer from the production of coke. In case of
DH, alkane conversion is limited by thermodynamic constraints
[1–5].
An attractive alternative to this approach is the oxidative dehy-
drogenation of propane (ODP) by molecular oxygen, which enables
lower reaction temperatures and more effective inhibition of sur-
face coke formation. The primary drawback of this process is a
low propylene selectivity due to total oxidation of propane and
propylene at high conversion. Thus there is an ongoing search for
a selective catalyst in this process.
Vanadium oxide is considered to be one of the most important
compounds in metal oxide catalysis [6–9]. The catalytic activity
and selectivity of vanadium oxide for oxidative dehydrogenation
(ODH) depends on its structure, dispersion and the characteristics
of its supporting material. The most active catalytic form for this
type of reaction is the monomeric, isolated VOx species. The oxygen
of the V@O (=vanadyl) group of this isolated VOx is responsible for
the ODH of propane to propylene and is also selective for propy-
lene formation [10–13]. The presence of bulk V2O5 on the other
hand decreases the selectivity and favors total oxidation. At this

point the best reported performance of a VOx/SiO2 catalyst is a
yield of 30% [14].
Improvement in this yield is possible with the addition of WOx.
It has been reported that tungsten oxide inﬂuences the dispersion
of VOx and improves the abundance of moderately distorted vana-
dium oxide species [15,16]. Alternatively, it has been suggested
that the promoting effect of tungsten oxide could also be beneﬁcial
for the WOx–VOx/SiO2 catalyst by inhibiting the strong tendency
for island formation of VOx and by interacting with neighboring
vanadium oxide species. The WOx hinders the compression of
vanadium oxide species from tetrahedral, isolated species to oligo-
mer, polymer or bulk V2O5 [9,17]. The interaction between neigh-
boring tungsten and vanadium oxides can also favor the reduction
of VOx, which is further beneﬁcial to the dehydrogenation perfor-
mance [17,18].
Recently, CO2 has received much attention as a co-feed gas for
dehydrogenation, because CO2 can act as a mild oxidant. Unlike
oxygen, CO2 will not be able to fully oxidize the catalyst to its orig-
inal state due to its weak oxidation capacity. It is a thermodynam-
ically stable and a kinetically inert molecule, and it is also cheap
and abundant [19–22]. Moreover, because of its high heat capacity,
using CO2 as a co-feed can alleviate the effects of the exothermal
ODP reaction, avoiding hot spots that can lead to cracking of the
alkane [21,23].
Utilization of carbon dioxide in some partial oxidation reactions,
such as CO2 reforming of methane and oxidative coupling of
methane has already been reported [22,24–27]. CO2 was found to
enhance the dehydrogenation of lower alkanes and ethylbenzene
over chromium and vanadium oxide based catalysts [20,28–32].
To date, Ga2O3 [33,34], Cr2O3 [31,35], In2O3 [36,37], and V2O5 [38]
based materials are most frequently reported in the ﬁeld of propane
dehydrogenation by CO2. However, the role of CO2 in oxidative
dehydrogenation and the mechanism of this reaction remain
unclear and are dependent on the nature of the catalyst and its
supporting material.
When using chromium or vanadium oxide based catalysts, CO2
can re-oxidize partially reduced metal oxides. It is generally
accepted that it follows a proposed pathway which is in agreement
with the Mars-Van Krevelen mechanism [39], but DH can occur
simultaneously with the ODH reaction. For gallium and indium
based catalysts, the promoting effect of CO2 is related to its
enhancing effect on the removal of coke, the Boudouard reaction,
and the reverse water gas shift (RWGS) reaction. Carbon dioxide
can eliminate the hydrogen produced by non-oxidative dehydro-
genation reactions by the RWGS. Coupling of the reverse water
gas shift reaction with DH therefore improves the equilibrium con-
version in these DH reactions toward propylene production
[19,21]. A thermodynamic analysis of propane dehydrogenation
with carbon dioxide was performed using the constrained Gibbs
free energy minimization method [40]. The inﬂuences of the
CO2/C3H8 molar ratio, temperature and pressure on equilibrium
conversion and product composition were examined. In the pres-
ence of CO2 with a molar ratio of CO2/C3H8 = 1, the temperature
of dehydrogenation can be 50 C lower than that of simple dehy-
drogenation to achieve 60% conversion of propane at 650 C. It
was found that the occurrence of dry reforming of propane and
coke forming side reactions could strongly impact the equilibrium
product composition of the multi–reaction system and, therefore,
these reactions should be kinetically controlled [40].
Nevertheless, CO2 assisted propane dehydrogenation with the
use of vanadium oxide based catalysts remains poorly understood.
Herein we report on the dynamic behavior of the WOx–VOx-based
catalyst and have examined the role of CO2 and the effects of tung-
sten
on
its
catalytic
activity,
selectivity
toward
propylene,
structural characteristics of the catalyst and coke formation. More-
over, density functional theory (DFT) calculations were performed
to elucidate the reaction mechanism of propane dehydrogenation
in the presence and in the absence of CO2.
2. Experimental procedures
2.1. Catalyst preparation
Catalysts were prepared via the incipient wetness method. Sil-
icagel (Kieselge l60, Sigma Aldrich) was impregnated with an aque-
ous solution of ammonium metavanadate (>99% NH4VO3, Sigma
Aldrich) and ammonium tungstate (99.99% [NH4]10H2[W2O7]6,
Sigma Aldrich). A molar equivalent of oxalic acid dihydrate (99%,

Chimica Janssen) was added to the solution to increase the solubility
of the ammonium metalcomplexes. The impregnated molar concen-
tration of ammonium metavanadate in the impregnated solution
(0.75 mL/g) remained 2 mmol/0.75 mL, while the concentration of
the ammonium tungstate varied from 0.2, 0.6 to 1.2 mmol/0.75 mL.
After impregnation, the powders were vacuum dried overnight at
room temperature. Finally, the powders were dried in a furnace at
100 C for 6 h and subsequently calcined in air at 600 C for 6 h with
a heating rate of 4 K/min. The bulk chemical composition of the
tested catalysts (see Table 1) was determined by means of induc-
tively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometry (ICP-AES) (IRIS
Advantage system, Thermo Jarrell Ash). The investigated catalysts
contain approximately the same amount of vanadium (ca. 3.5 wt.
% V) and are denoted based on their weight percentage of tungsten
as 0W–V (0 wt.% W), 1.5W–V (1.5 wt.% W), 4.5W–V (4.5 wt.% W),
and 6.8W–V (6.8 wt.% W).
2.2. Catalyst characterization
Crystallographic analysis of the tested catalysts was performed
by means of X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements in h–2h mode
using an ARL X’TRA Diffractometer (Thermo Scientiﬁc) apparatus
with lynx eye detector covering 3 and 192 channels over the range
5–60 with a step of 0.02. Raman analysis of the samples was per-
formed on a RXN1 Raman spectrometer (Kaiser Optical Systems)
ﬁtted with a 532 nm laser operating at 40 mW. H2-TPR measure-
ments were carried out in a U-shaped quartz reactor with 50 mg
of catalyst. The temperature was increased to 800 C at a rate of
10 K/min.
Microscopy
High-Resolution
Transmission
Electron
Microscopy (HRTEM), Bright Field (BF) and Dark Field (DF) Scan-
ning Transmission Electron Microscopy (STEM BF) were used for
structural analysis. Energy Dispersive X-ray spectrometry (EDX)
was used for local chemical analysis. These techniques were
implemented using a JEOL JEM-2200FS, Cs-corrected microscope
operated at 200 kV, which was equipped with a Schottky-type
ﬁeld-emission gun (FEG) and EDX JEOL JED-2300D. All samples
were deposited by immersion of the catalyst onto a lacey carbon
ﬁlm on a copper support grid.
In
view
of
obtaining
information
regarding
the
average
oxidation state of the catalyst, a chemical method was applied to
the catalysts using redox titration. Starting from the as prepared
sample, this procedure includes the following steps: (1) catalyst
reduction with 5%H2/Ar at 600 C followed by re-oxidation with
O2 or CO2 and (2) second isothermal reduction with hydrogen
(5%H2/Ar, 600 C) to determine the amount of exchangeable
oxygen in the O2 or CO2 pretreated catalyst.
An ex situ XPS study of several vanadium oxides catalysts was
performed to try and identify clearly the different oxidation states
present on the surface of these oxides. The amount of V and W in
the samples is small and thus only small peaks could be observed
in XPS (Figs. S1–S3), even after prolonged measuring times. Peak
positions were determined using Casa XPS software, Shirley
background subtraction and mixed Gaussian–Lorentzian peaks.
However, the ex situ nature of these measurements does not allow
the determination of the oxidation state of the catalyst during
reaction conditions.
2.3. Catalytic tests
Catalytic tests were performed at atmospheric pressure in a
quartz tube microreactor with an internal diameter of 10 mm,
which was housed inside an electric furnace (Autochem II 2920,
Micromeritics equipped with a TCD detector). Typically, 50 mg of
sample was packed between quartz wool plugs. The temperature
of the catalyst bed was measured with K-type thermocouples
touching the outside and inside of the reactor at the position of
the catalyst bed. The inlet gas ﬂow rates were controlled using
Brooks mass ﬂow controllers. The feed and product gas streams

were monitored online using a calibrated OmniStar Pfeiffer Mass
Spectrometer. MS signals were recorded for all major fragments
of C3H8, C3H6, C2H6, and C2H4. 29 amu was the most intense frag-
ment of C3H8, while its contribution for C2H6 and C2H4 was minor,
as veriﬁed by additional control experiments. For experiments
reported in this manuscript, the appropriately scaled 29 amu signal
(based on the C3H8 fragmentation ratios tabulated in the NIST
database) was subtracted from the 27–28 amu signals. The remain-
ing 27–28 amu signals and the 26 amu signal were not signiﬁcant
within experimental error, which led us to conclude that C2
formation is negligible in our experiments. The 41 amu signal
was used to follow C3H6 while the 16 amu signal was used to
follow CH4. The carbon balance was veriﬁed using Ar as an internal
standard
and
accounting
for
deposited
carbon
a
maximum
deviation of 15% was obtained.
The reaction temperature was limited to 600 C because above
that temperature non-catalytic reactions were observed. Kinetic
measurements were conducted at Wcat/FC3H8,0 = 44.8 kgcat s mol1
and PC3H8,0 = 5 kPa (1 N ml/s of 5 vol.% C3H8/He mixture). Three
types of experiments were performed. In the ﬁrst type of experi-
ments, the sample was oxidized in 1 N ml/s ﬂow of 20% O2/N2 at
600 C for 0.5 h. Then, at reaction temperature the reactor was
purged with He for 5 min and a catalytic measurement was per-
formed. In the second type of experiments, the sample was
reduced at 600 C for 5 min by 5% H2/Ar. After purging with helium
for 5 min, 1 N ml/s of 20 vol.% CO2/He was introduced to re-oxidize
the catalyst and a catalytic test was conducted. In the third type of
experiments, a mixture of C3H8 and CO2 was fed into the reactor.
After activity measurements, the reactor was purged with helium,
and 1 N ml/s of 20% O2/He was introduced in order to burn off car-
bon deposits until the CO2 signal returned to the baseline.
Experiments were repeated three times with as prepared sam-
ple material in order to obtain standard deviations. The average
turnover frequency (TOF, mol s1 molVOx
1) was calculated from
the difference in the inlet and outlet molar ﬂow rates, as measured
relative to an internal standard (Ar) using an online quadrupole
mass spectrometer, i.e.
TOFi ¼ ðF0
i  FiÞ=NVOx;s;
ð1Þ
with Fi the molar ﬂow rate of component i (mol s1), and NVOx,s the
amount of exposed (surface) VOx atoms in the sample (molVOx,s).
The conversion of propane is calculated as
XC3H8 ¼ ðFC3H8;0  FC3H8Þ=FC3H8;0
ð2Þ
with FC3H8,0 and FC3H8 (mol s1) the propane inlet and outlet molar
ﬂow rate.
The isotopic labeling experiments were performed with 600 C
as a standard temperature and a total ﬂow rate of 1 N ml/s. D2 was
co-fed with C3H8 and CO2 with D2:C3H8:CO2 = 1:1:1 ratio. D2 gas
(99.9% isotopic purity) was obtained from Sigma–Aldrich.
3. Computational procedures
Density functional theory (DFT) cluster calculations have been
performed with Gaussian 09 [41], using the B3LYP functional
[42] and triple-f plus polarization basis sets [43] (TZVP) on all
atoms. All atoms were allowed to relax during geometry optimiza-
tion, while the optimized structures were characterized as minima
or transition states by frequency calculations. The Gibbs free
energy for all structures was calculated using statistical thermody-
namics [44]. The partition functions for the gas-phase species
included vibrational, rotational and translational degrees of free-
dom, while only the vibrational contributions were taken into
account for the surface species.
4. Results and discussions
4.1. Catalyst characterization
XRD measurements were performed to determine whether
metal clusters and thus crystalline V2O5 and WO3 were present
in the samples (Fig. 1). As shown in Table 1, the catalysts contain
a similar V-loading and only differ in the amount of impregnated
tungsten oxide. XRD shows no signiﬁcant diffractions attributed
to bulk V2O5 for any sample, although the presence of crystalline
clusters, smaller than 3 nm, cannot be excluded based on XRD.
When the loading of tungsten oxide increases, two distinct diffrac-
tion lines arise at 2h = 24 and 2h = 34 which is a strong indication
that crystalline monoclinic WO3 was formed. Similar observations
have been observed in the literature [45,46]. For 1.5W–V, the sam-
ple with the lowest amount of tungsten, no WO3 diffractions can be
detected. This suggests that WOx is either dispersed on the surface
or that the WO3 crystallites are too small to be detected. The broad
peak between 2h = 20–30 originates from the amorphous silica
supporting material [10]. After catalysis and subsequent re-
oxidation, a similar XRD diffractogram was observed.
H2-TPR was carried out to investigate the reducibility of vana-
dium oxide surface species deposited on the SiO2 support. Compar-
ing the H2-TPR proﬁles of bulk V2O5 and 0W–V sample, shown in
Fig. 2, the reduction proﬁle for bulk V2O5 exhibits two major peaks

at 660 C and 790 C while for 0W–V only one signal at 580 C can
be observed. Similar observations on the reduction of bulk V2O5
were reported by Shee and Deo [47]. The presence of multiple
peaks is attributed to the reduction of V2O5 to V2O3 through the
intermediate formation of oxide species with different oxidation
states according to the following sequence:
V2O5 ! V2O4 ! V2O3
The symmetrical signal at 580 C for the 0W–V sample indicates
the presence of VOx in its isolated, monomeric form [11,48].
The effect of the amount of WOx on the reducibility of the VOx
species is shown in the inset of Fig. 2. H2-TPR shows a small
increase in the H2 consumption by vanadium oxide for the
WOx–VOx/SiO2 impregnated samples in comparison with the
0W–V sample. Oxidation of the H2 by WO3 does not take place in
this temperature range [17]. The position of the peak remains
unchanged and is approximately 580 C, indicating the reduction
of amorphous monomeric VOx surface species and that the
reducibility of all the samples remains the same.
STEM images (Fig. 3) show that the WO3 species remain rather
dispersed, for the lowest loading, and subsequently begin to cluster
into larger particles with increasing loading of tungsten. The largest
particles are estimated to have a size of 30 nm. It has been previ-
ously reported that thermal treatment at an elevated temperature
of 500 C results in the coalescence of grafted WOx species to form

WO3 clusters of 10 nm [46]. In this case, the calcination procedure is
mainly responsible for the WO3 crystal growth seen in Fig. 3
(b) and (c). The STEM image of the sample with the lowest tungsten
loading, i.e. Fig. 3(a), shows that here the WO3 crystals are better
dispersed on the mesoporous silica supporting material.
Raman spectroscopy was performed to study the structural
properties of the catalysts. The Raman spectrum in Fig. 4(a) shows
that no bulk V2O5 (995 cm1) was formed on the silica surface for
any sample. The signal at 1035 cm1 is generally attributed to the
vanadium oxide species. This signal indicates that VOx is present in
its mono-vanadyl (V@O) form on the surface of the porous silica
supporting material [12,49]. If V2O5 crystallites would have been
formed, this V@O signal would be shifted toward 995 cm1 [18].
Every sample contains a signal at 487 cm1, which correlates with
the amorphous silica supporting material [50]. Around 800 cm1,
two features overlap. There is a Si-O-Si symmetrical stretch at
800 cm1 that is present in all samples, but for the samples con-
taining higher loadings of WOx (spectra 3 and 4 in Fig. 4(a)),
another feature emerges at 800 cm1 that is assigned to the pres-
ence of bulk WO3 [17,51]. This is also conﬁrmed by the XRD
diffractograms of the samples.
To obtain information concerning the role of tungsten in retain-
ing VOx in a dispersed state, Raman spectra were also measured
after a reaction followed by a re-oxidation process. During the
re-oxidation step, the catalysts were calcined in air at 500 C with
a heating rate of 4 K/min for a period of 6 h. Comparing the Raman
spectra of the as-prepared (see Fig. 4(a)) and re-oxidized (see Fig. 4
(b)) catalysts, it is clear that the WOx-containing catalysts maintain
VOx in a highly dispersed state. The sample without the WOx pre-
sented (spectrum 1) shows much broader peaks and a shift toward
995 cm1, indicating the start of bulk V2O5 formation. This is
expected since VOx species have the tendency to cluster on silica
surfaces during high temperature treatments [52].
5. Propane dehydrogenation
5.1. O2 pre-oxidized catalysts
The observed relaxation to a steady-state corresponds to varia-
tions in the chemical or phase composition of the surface under the
effect of the reaction conditions and can be called extrinsic relax-
ation [53]. Two different start-up conditions were used i.e. O2 or
CO2 pretreated catalyst. Representative results of relaxation exper-
iments at 600 C on a O2 pretreated catalyst are depicted in Fig. 5.
The catalytic performance of the 0W–V catalyst, i.e. without
WOx, was examined in order to establish the catalytic properties.
In Fig. 5(a), the average turnover frequencies of propylene, hydro-
gen, and carbon dioxide, which are the only detectable products,
are shown as function of time on-stream. In the initial state of reac-
tion, the catalyst is fully oxidized and oxidative dehydrogenation
proceeds through the redox mechanism by reduction of V5+ to
V3+ combined with C3H6 and CO2 formation (Eqs. (3) and (4)). As
stated in the introduction, the formation of C3H6 and the unwanted
CO2 proceeds via different mechanisms on different surface oxy-
gens in vanadium oxide. During the relaxation period, the forma-
tion
of
carbon
dioxide
passes
through
a
maximum
and
completely disappears after 120 s. The propylene average turnover
frequency monotonically increases toward a steady-state value of
8.3 mmol/s/molVOx after 60 s. Beyond 180 s, the average turnover

of propylene at any time during the reaction. Since the oxidation
of V3+ cannot proceed after this stage, only non-oxidative dehydro-
genation is possible over these reduced sites according to Eq. (5)

Experimental data for the WOx-containing catalysts, Fig. 5(b–d),
show similar trends, but there are pronounced differences with
increasing WOx loading in the catalysts. The average turnover fre-
quency of both carbon dioxide and hydrogen decreases compared
to the catalyst containing no WOx, i.e. the 0W–V sample. Propylene
generation begins increasing earlier and reaches a higher steady-
state value up to 13.3 mmol/s/molVOx for the 1.5W–V sample. The
6.8W–V catalyst shows the highest initial selectivity toward propy-
lene, i.e. less carbon dioxide formation. Like carbon dioxide, water
formation passes through a maximum and then, completely disap-
pears after 80 s (Fig. 5d). This can be attributed to the same oxygen
storage capacity of the samples. Since non-selective bulk V2O5 is not
present in the promoted catalysts (see Fig. 4), the carbon dioxide
yield was ﬁve times smaller compared to the non-promoted

catalyst. The amount of hydrogen produced by all WOx promoted
catalysts was less than the amount of propylene produced during
the initial 90 s of the experiments. However, after this relaxation
period, the average turnover frequency of hydrogen production for
all promoted samples was higher than the propylene production.
This can be attributed to dehydrogenation reactions that are accom-
panied by complete propane dehydrogenation to surface carbon and
hydrogen (Eq. (6).

After the catalytic test, the reactor was purged with helium, and
1 N ml/s of 20% O2/He was introduced in order to burn off carbon
deposits from the catalysts. The quantity of carbon in mmolC/-
molVOx deposited on the catalyst after reaction (Fig. 6) was more
than three times lower for the tungsten promoted catalysts.
5.2. CO2 pre-oxidized catalysts
After reduction of WOx–VOx/SiO2 with 5% H2/Ar at 600 C fol-
lowed by re-oxidation with O2 or CO2, the isothermal reduction
proﬁles show an intense H2 consumption peak attributed to the
reduction of V2O5 to V2O3 [54,55]. The reduction proﬁles for
1.5W–V are shown in Fig. 7. The amount of oxygen present in the
O2 oxidized catalyst was 1.9 mol/molVOx. This result is close to the
theoretical amount of available oxygen for reduction of V5+ to V3+.
When the catalyst is reduced, and subsequently re-oxidized with
CO2 instead of O2 at the same temperature, the H2 consumption
peak is about 0.86 ± 0.13 mol/molVOx which is 45 ± 7% of that of
the samples that have been oxidized by O2. This clearly indicates
that less than half of the exchangeable oxygen is regenerated by
CO2, which can be attributed to the oxidation of V2O3 into V2O4
instead of V2O5. Reduction of WO3 by H2 does not take place under
these experimental conditions.
In order to avoid the effects of surface carbon on catalyst activ-
ity, kinetic measurements of propane dehydrogenation over CO2
re-oxidized catalysts were performed after reduction of the as
prepared catalysts by 5% H2/Ar for 10 min at 600 C and catalyst
re-oxidation in 20% CO2/He.
Representative results of extrinsic relaxation measurements at
600 C are depicted in Fig. 8. The average turnover frequencies of
propylene and hydrogen are shown as a function of time-on-
stream. The propylene yield monotonically increased toward a
steady-state value after 40 s for all catalysts. Beyond 180 s, the yield
of hydrogen systematically increased. The amount of hydrogen at
any time during the reaction was higher than the propylene yield
for the VOx unpromoted catalyst. The amount of hydrogen produced
by all promoted WOx catalysts was less than the propylene yield dur-
ing the initial 40 s period of the experiments. Compared to the
unpromoted catalyst at the same time-on-stream (i.e. 40 s), the
amount of hydrogen produced by the promoted catalysts decreased
from 13 mmol/s/molVOx to 9.9 mmol/s/molVOx for 1.5W–V, to
8.1 mmol/s/molVOx for 4.8W–V, and to 5.3 mmol/s/molVOx for
6.8W–V. Carbon dioxide was not observed in all cases. Water forma-
tion passed through a maximum and then completely disappeared
after 80 s (Fig. 8d). This can be explained by the fact that initially
the catalyst is partially oxidized and that selective oxidative dehy-
drogenation is accompanied by non-oxidative dehydrogenation.
Furthermore, the absence of CO2 as a product clearly shows that only
selective surface oxygen was formed after catalyst reoxidation by
carbon dioxide.
Following catalytic experiments, the carbon deposits were burnt
off from the catalysts. The amount of carbon in mmolC/molVOx
deposited on the catalyst after the reaction was approximately
the same as for the O2 oxidized catalysts (see Fig. 6).
5.3. In the presence of CO2
The effect of the presence of CO2 in the gas phase on propane
dehydrogenation was also investigated in order to clarify the con-
tribution of CO2 to the reaction. The average turnover frequencies
of propylene, hydrogen, carbon monoxide and water, which are
the only detectable products, are shown in Fig. 9(a) as function
of time-on-stream for the 6.8W–V sample. During the relaxation
period, C3H6 passed through a maximum and then reached a
steady-state value of 10.4 mmol/s/molVOx after 450 s. The yield of
hydrogen increased systematically reaching 3.7 mmol/s/molVOx

after 30 min. The amount of produced carbon monoxide was equal
to propylene only in the initial 100 s period of reaction before
decreasing to 9 mmol/s/molVOx. Water formation monotonically
increased and reached a steady-state value. Clearly, CO and H2O
are produced from CO2 and C3H8 during oxidative dehydrogenation
via a redox mechanism [9,13,56]. In this case, the amount of propy-
lene and carbon monoxide must be equal. On the other hand, reac-
tion of H2 and CO2 (RWGS) could also be responsible for CO
formation (Eq. (7)). Hydrogen can be produced by non-oxidative
dehydrogenation of propane as discussed above (see Figs. 5 and 8).
CO2 þ H2 $ CO þ H2O
ð7Þ
In order to investigate the catalytic properties of the 6.8W–V
catalyst in a RWGS reaction, experiments were performed while
feeding a gaseous mixture containing 20% CO2 and 20% H2 in the
He ﬂow. The reaction of propane dehydrogenation was performed
ﬁrst in order to obtain reduced vanadium oxide, and then the CO2
and H2 mixture was fed to the catalyst. The conversion of CO2 and
H2 was 28%, which conﬁrms a high activity of the catalyst in a
RWGS reaction.
Therefore, it cannot be excluded that propylene is produced by
non-oxidative dehydrogenation (Eq. (5)) [31,57,58] and that the
formation of CO and H2O is a result of the RWGS reaction (Eq.
(7)). In order to understand the origin of water formation, D2 was
co-fed with C3H8 and CO2. This experiment was carried out at
600 C with a D2:C3H8:CO2 = 1:1:1 ratio. Only 45% of the resulting
water contained D2O under these experimental conditions, sup-
porting the idea that in the case of dehydrogenation of C3H8 in
the presence of carbon dioxide, interaction of surface oxygen with
propane occurs. Thus, the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane
over the W–V catalyst in the presence of CO2 is accompanied by
the RWGS reaction. The amount of carbon deposited on the cata-
lyst after reaction with a mixture of CO2 and C3H8 at the different
reaction times depicted in Fig. 9(b) is three times less than that
which is deposited after reaction with only C3H8 for the same time
on stream. This result strongly suggests that one of the major roles
of the CO2 is suppression of surface carbon formation on the cata-
lyst. The reaction rate of propylene formation by the catalyst under
the described conditions is 6 mmol/s/kg. This value is similar to
existing C3H6 production methods and suggests viability for com-
mercialization of this catalyst.
In order to clarify the contribution of C3H8 and CO2 to the reac-
tion, the effect of the partial pressure of compounds on the cat-
alytic activity was investigated and the results are shown in
Fig. S4a and b. The reaction orders for C3H8 and CO2 were deter-
mined by plotting the logarithm of the average TOF versus the log-
arithm of the inlet molar ﬂow rate of the corresponding compound.
From the resulting slope, the reaction orders were found to be
0.82 ± 0.17 and 0.17 ± 0.03 for propane and carbon dioxide, respec-
tively. These results suggest that CAH bond activation in C3H8 is
the rate-determining step. Similar results for propane dehydro-
genation with CO2 were observed previously [31].
The apparent activation energies for the catalysts were calcu-
lated using Arrhenius plots. These data were obtained from exper-
iments performed at a temperature interval of 500 C to 600 C.
The Arrhenius plots yielded an apparent activation energy that is
very similar for all the investigated samples, namely 136 ± 12 kJ/-
mol for 0W–V, 145 ± 12 kJ/mol for 1.5W–V, 141 ± 15 kJ/mol for
4.5W–V, and 127 ± 11 kJ/mol for 6.8W–V (Supporting Information,
Fig. S5). Moreover, the activation energies measured in this work
are in agreement with those reported previously in the literature.
For V2O5/SiO2 catalysts with vanadium surface coverages below
0.5 V/nm2 (MCM-41), apparent activation energies of 122 ± 20 kJ/-
mol have been measured for propylene formation [59]. For V2O5/
Al2O3 and V2O5/ZrO2 catalysts, the apparent activation energies
for propylene formation are 110–120 kJ/mol [60] and around
99 kJ/mol [61] respectively.
5.4. Theoretical modeling of propane dehydrogenation in the presence
of CO2
Propane dehydrogenation in the presence of CO2 can be consid-
ered
to
proceed
via
a
parallel-consecutive
reaction
scheme
(Fig. 10), where propane can undergo either a direct oxidative
dehydrogenation or a non-oxidative dehydrogenation followed
by a reverse water gas shift reaction. Based on the experimental
results of CO2-assisted propane dehydrogenation indicating the
presence of isolated and partially reduced vanadia species under
reaction conditions, a cubic silsesquioxane cluster [62] with an iso-
lated V5+–O–V3+ unit is used to model the active site, as shown in
Fig. 11. The investigated redox mechanisms for the aforementioned
catalytic cycles involved in propane dehydrogenation in the pres-
ence of CO2 are depicted in Figs. 12–14, while detailed energy pro-
ﬁles along the reaction coordinate are provided in Supporting
Information (Figs. S6–S8).
As seen from Fig. 12, the direct oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH)
of propane can be described as a sequence of the following steps:
propane activation, hydrogen abstraction from the propyl radical,
desorption of propene, desorption of water, adsorption of CO2, and
oxygen abstraction from CO2. Interestingly enough, the oxygen
abstraction from CO2, which regenerates the vanadyl oxygen of
the active site, is a spontaneous process (DGr
600C = 74 kJ/mol),
while the ODH cycle seems to be limited by its ﬁrst elementary step,
namely propane activation, which has the largest Gibbs free energy
barrier (
= 245 kJ/mol). The respective Arrhenius activation
energy for this rate-determining step is 158 kJ/mol. In accordance
with previous theoretical studies [13,61–63], propane activation
has been considered to occur preferentially via a hydrogen abstrac-
tion from its secondary CAH bond [63].
As depicted in Fig. 13, the ﬁrst step of the non-oxidative dehy-
drogenation (DH) of propane was considered to be the same as in
the ODH cycle. However, unlike ODH where both hydrogen
abstractions occur at the same vanadyl oxygen, the bridge oxygen
is chosen for the hydrogen abstraction from the secondary propyl
radical in the DH cycle. Subsequently, the physisorbed propene
can easily desorb, while the following steps regenerate the active
site: hydrogen migration from the bridge oxygen to vanadium,
hydrogen migration from the vanadyl oxygen to bridge oxygen,
recombination of two hydrogen atoms, and desorption of H2. Sim-
ilar to ODH, the DH cycle is also limited by the ﬁrst elementary step
(
= 245 kJ/mol, Eact = 158 kJ/mol).
Finally, the reverse water gas shift (RWGS) reaction has been
envisaged to occur as follows (see Fig. 14): adsorption of H2, disso-
ciation of H2, hydrogen migration from the bridge oxygen to the
vanadyl oxygen, hydrogen migration from vanadium to bridge
oxygen, hydrogen migration from bridge oxygen to hydroxyl, des-
orption of water, adsorption of CO2, and oxygen abstraction from
CO2. As indicated in Fig. S9 in the Supporting Information, the ﬁrst
four steps of the RWGS cycle are the same as the last four steps of
the DH cycle but in the reverse direction, while the last three steps
of the RWGS cycle are the same as the last three steps of the ODH
cycle. The RWGS cycle seems to be limited by its fourth elementary
step, namely hydrogen migration from the vanadium site to the
vicinal bridge oxygen (
= 189 kJ/mol, Eact = 185 kJ/mol).
Overall, based on the largest Gibbs free energy barrier along the
investigated catalytic cycles, it can be concluded that propane
dehydrogenation in the presence of CO2 can proceed equally both
via direct oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) and by non-oxidative
dehydrogenation (DH) followed by reverse water gas shift (RWGS)
reaction. The rate-determining step of both direct (ODH) and
I. Ascoop et al. / Journal of Catalysis 335 (2016) 1–10

consecutive (DH + RWGS) pathways is the activation of the
secondary CAH bond of propane.
6. Conclusions
The presence of WOx clearly has an impact on the catalyst itself
and the conversion reaction of propane to propylene. It hinders the
clustering of the VOx species during reaction by acting as a physical
barrier between the VOx species. As a result it prevents the forma-
tion of non-selective oxygen which reduces the probability of CO2
formation and thus total oxidation of propane.
CO2 as the oxidant, on the other hand, cannot re-oxidize the
catalyst completely to its V2O5 state. Using CO2, it is only possible
to oxidize to V2O4, as conﬁrmed by the isothermal reduction exper-
iments of the CO2 re-oxidized sample. Furthermore, CO2-assisted
propane dehydrogenation results in a higher selectivity toward
propylene production and a reduction of carbon formation. Accord-
ing to isotopic experiments during reaction and density functional
theory (DFT) calculations, propane dehydrogenation in the presence
of CO2 can proceed simultaneously via direct oxidative dehydro-
genation and non-oxidative dehydrogenation followed by the
reverse water gas shift reaction. Based on the DFT-calculated Gibbs
free energy proﬁle at 600 C, CO2-assisted propane dehydrogenation
is limited by the activation of the secondary CAH bond of propane,
while re-oxidation of the catalyst with CO2 is occurring on a smaller
timescale.
