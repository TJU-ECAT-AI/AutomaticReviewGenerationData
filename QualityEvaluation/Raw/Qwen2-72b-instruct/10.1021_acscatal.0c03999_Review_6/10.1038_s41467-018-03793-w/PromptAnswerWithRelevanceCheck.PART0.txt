Read the questions and answers provided below. First, critically assess the overall relevance of the answers provided to the set of questions asked.

If, upon your assessment, you find that the answers do not contain information that is relevant to the questions asked, stop your review process immediately and respond with a single sentence: "※※※※※※※The provided answers are not relevant to the questions.※※※※※※※". Do not provide any additional explanation or background information, only this sentence should be given as a response in case of irrelevant answers.

If, however, the answers are relevant to the questions asked, proceed to compile answers for each question according to the instructions below. Ensure to aggregate all the relevant answers from the multiple answer results provided in the document, and organize them sequentially by their order number, compiling the corresponding quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question.

If the provided answers' quotes are not differentiated by question, ensure to break them down and assign the quotes to each respective question, outputting them separately within each question's section.

To provide a comprehensive review, differentiate the responses into quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question based on the details given in the 'Answer' XML tags. Structure your review using the XML format showcased below if the answers are relevant to the questions asked:

1.The document does not provide specific information on how the reducibility and support materials of Fe oxide-based catalysts influence their performance in CO2-ODHP reactions. However, it does mention that ceria (CeO2) is a good choice of oxide support because it has the ability to store/release oxygen and thus may induce direct CO bond scission of CO2, while also providing available lattice oxygen for coke suppression. The Fe3Ni catalyst, which consists of oxidized Fe and metallic Ni, shows promising selectivity toward propylene via the CO2-ODHP pathway. This suggests that the combination of Fe and Ni on a ceria support can enhance the catalytic activity for CO2-ODHP.

1.文档没有提供Fe氧化物基催化剂的还原性和支撑材料如何影响其在CO2-ODHP反应中的性能的具体信息。但是，它确实提到氧化铈（CeO2）是氧化物支撑材料的良好选择，因为它具有储存/释放氧气的能力，从而可能诱导CO2的CO键裂解，同时提供可用的晶格氧来抑制焦炭生成。Fe3Ni催化剂，由氧化Fe和金属Ni组成，显示出对CO2-ODHP途径的丙烯有良好的选择性。这表明Fe和Ni在氧化铈支撑材料上的组合可以增强CO2-ODHP的催化活性。

The Fe3Ni catalyst, which consists of oxidized Fe and metallic Ni, shows promising selectivity toward propylene via the CO2-ODHP pathway. This suggests that the combination of Fe and Ni on a ceria support can enhance the catalytic activity for CO2-ODHP by promoting the oxidative CH bond cleavage of propane.
