1.The literature does not provide specific information on the composition of coke deposits in catalytic systems or the analytical techniques used to elucidate the nature of coke constituents in propane dehydrogenation reactions. However, it does mention that temperature programmed oxidation (TPO) has been used to characterize the coke deposited on the catalyst during propane dehydrogenation, identifying different types of coke such as coke on the metal, coke on the support, and graphitic coke on the support. The amounts of these types of coke depend on the conditions, and a model has been proposed in which a minor part of the coke deactivates the catalyst.

1.The document does not provide information on the composition of coke deposits in catalytic systems or the analytical techniques used to study them. The document focuses on the study of propane dehydrogenation over alumina-supported Pt-Sn catalysts, determining the kinetics of coke formation and the deactivation functions for the coking and dehydrogenation reactions. It mentions the use of an oscillating microbalance reactor (TEOM) to study the dehydrogenation of propane, which gives a realistic representation of a fixed-bed reactor and is well suited for studying coke formation and the kinetics of the main and coking reactions. However, it does not delve into the detailed composition of coke or the analytical techniques used to elucidate its nature.
