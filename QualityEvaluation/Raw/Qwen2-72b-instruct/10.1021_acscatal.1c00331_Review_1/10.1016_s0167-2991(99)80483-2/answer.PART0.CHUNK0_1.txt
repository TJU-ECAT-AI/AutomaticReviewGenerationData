1.The literature does not provide specific information on the composition of coke deposits in catalytic systems or the analytical techniques used to elucidate the nature of coke constituents in propane dehydrogenation reactions. However, it does mention that temperature programmed oxidation (TPO) has been used to characterize the coke deposited on the catalyst during propane dehydrogenation, identifying different types of coke such as coke on the metal, coke on the support, and graphitic coke on the support. The amounts of these types of coke depend on the conditions, and a model has been proposed in which a minor part of the coke deactivates the catalyst.

1.文献没有提供关于催化系统中焦炭沉积物的组成或用于阐明丙烷脱氢反应中焦炭成分性质的分析技术的具体信息。但是，它确实提到温度程序氧化（TPO）已被用于表征在丙烷脱氢过程中沉积在催化剂上的焦炭，识别不同类型的焦炭，如金属上的焦炭、支撑物上的焦炭和支撑物上的石墨焦炭。这些类型的焦炭的数量取决于条件，已经提出了一个模型，其中一小部分焦炭使催化剂失活。
