[8] "The graphitic coke formed on the carrier is not formed through this route."
[9] "The experiments with different time on stream revealed that the first peak reached a constant level after about 15 h, while the second one still increased."
[10] "Hydrogen was very efficient in preventing coke formation and deactivation but could not remove coke already formed on the catalyst."

1.The composition of coke deposits in catalytic systems, particularly in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions, varies across different reaction conditions and catalyst types. Three types of coke have been identified: coke on and in the vicinity of the metal, coke on the carrier, and graphitic coke on the carrier. The formation of the first two types of coke increases with temperature and partial pressure of propene, while hydrogen suppresses their formation. The amount of graphitic coke increases with temperature and propane partial pressure. A model suggests that only a minor part of the coke deactivates the catalyst, and this coke is formed in parallel with the main coke formation. The graphitic coke formed on the carrier is not formed through the same route as the deactivating coke. Hydrogen is efficient in preventing coke formation and deactivation but cannot remove coke already formed on the catalyst.

1.在催化系统中，特别是在丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应中，焦炭沉积物的组成随不同的反应条件和催化剂类型而变化。已识别出三种类型的焦炭：金属附近和金属上的焦炭，载体上的焦炭，以及载体上的石墨化焦炭。前两种类型焦炭的形成随温度和丙烯分压的增加而增加，而氢气抑制了它们的形成。石墨化焦炭的量随温度和丙烷分压的增加而增加。一个模型表明，只有少量的焦炭使催化剂失活，这种焦炭与主要焦炭形成并行。载体上形成的石墨化焦炭不是通过与失活焦炭相同的途径形成的。氢气在防止焦炭形成和失活方面非常有效，但不能去除催化剂上已经形成的焦炭。
