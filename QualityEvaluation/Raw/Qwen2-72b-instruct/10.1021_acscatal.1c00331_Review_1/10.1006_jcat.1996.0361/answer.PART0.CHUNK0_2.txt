1.In the study of propane dehydrogenation reactions, three types of coke deposits were identified using temperature-programmed oxidation (TPO) profiles: coke on and in the vicinity of the metal, coke on the carrier, and graphitic coke on the carrier. The amounts of these coke types were found to be related to reaction conditions. The formation of the first two types of coke increases with temperature and the partial pressure of propene, while hydrogen suppresses their formation. The amount of the third type of coke, which is graphitic, increases with temperature and propane partial pressure. A model suggests that only a minor part of the coke deactivates the catalyst, and this deactivating coke is formed in parallel with the other coke types. The graphitic coke on the carrier is formed through a separate mechanism. Experiments with different times on stream showed that the first type of coke reached a constant level after about 15 hours, while the second type continued to increase. Hydrogen was effective in preventing coke formation and deactivation but could not remove coke that had already formed on the catalyst. The mechanisms of hydrogenolysis and cracking during propane dehydrogenation were also discussed.

1.在丙烷脱氢反应的研究中，通过温度程序氧化(TPO)谱图识别出了三种类型的焦炭沉积物：金属附近和金属上的焦炭，载体上的焦炭，以及载体上的石墨化焦炭。这些焦炭类型的量与反应条件有关。前两种焦炭的形成随着温度和丙烯分压的升高而增加，而氢气抑制了它们的形成。第三种石墨化焦炭的量随着温度和丙烷分压的升高而增加。一个模型表明，只有少量的焦炭会使催化剂失活，这种失活的焦炭与在TPO实验中观察到的前两种焦炭平行形成。载体上的石墨化焦炭是通过不同的机制形成的。不同时间流上的实验表明，第一种焦炭在大约15小时后达到恒定水平，而第二种焦炭继续增加。氢气在防止焦炭形成和失活方面非常有效，但不能去除已经沉积在催化剂上的焦炭。丙烷脱氢过程中氢解和裂解机制也被讨论了。
