1. Introduction
The increasing demand for propylene derivatives such as
polypropylene, acrylonitrile, propylene oxide, cumene, phenol,
isopropylic alcohol and many others has produced a correspond-
ingly heavy increase in propylene demand during the last 20 years.
It is expected that in order to meet future propylene demand, other
processes will be developed (dehydrogenation, oxidative dehy-
drogenation, metathesis or use of membrane reactors) in addition
to traditional petrochemical or reﬁnery processes (steam cracking,
ﬂuid catalytic cracking), since it is forecast that the propylene
market will grow faster than the ethylene market [1].
Propane dehydrogenation is an equilibrium limited and highly
endothermic reaction (DH298 K
R
¼ 120 kJ mol1) that is often carried
out at high temperatures and atmospheric pressure using platinum
or chromium catalysts. The reaction of oleﬁns on platinum is faster
than that of parafﬁns, given that oleﬁns interact with platinum
more strongly than parafﬁns. The role of platinum modiﬁers is to
selectively
weaken
the
platinum–oleﬁn
interaction
without
affecting
the
platinum–parafﬁn
interaction.
Arsenic,
tin
or
germanium are among the metals reported as being platinum
activity modiﬁers. The modiﬁers also improve stability against
fouling by heavy carbonaceous materials. Platinum is a highly
active catalytic element and is not required in large quantities for
catalyzing the reaction when it is dispersed on a high surface area
support. High dispersion is also necessary for achieving high
selectivity
to
dehydrogenation
relative
to
undesirable
side
reactions, such as cracking. The typical high surface area alumina
supports employed have acidic sites that accelerate skeletal
isomerisation, cracking, and polymerization of oleﬁnic materials,
and enhance coke formation. Furthermore, alkali or alkaline earth
metals assist in the control of the acidity [2,3].
The formation of short chain hydrocarbons (cracking) and coke
(coking) are the main undesired reactions associated with propane
dehydrogenation. Furthermore, coke is rapidly formed at high
temperatures and as a consequence the catalyst is deactivated and
needs to be regenerated. These difﬁcult process features require
dedicated reactor technology.
During the last decade, our group has been researching process
alternatives. The objective is to employ a single vessel that could be
continuously operated. To this end, we have developed different
types of ﬂuidized bed reactors that use separated oxygen and
hydrocarbon feeds. The simplest version is called the two-zone
ﬂuidized bed reactor (TZFBR). It consists of a ﬂuidized bed where
oxygen is fed to the lower part of the reactor, mixed with an inert
gas, and the hydrocarbon is fed at an intermediate point of the bed.
In this way two zones are created in the reactor: in the lower zone
the catalyst is reoxidized by gas phase oxygen, a process that
causes the gas stream to become depleted in oxygen. In the upper
zone, the chemical reaction takes place. Reaction products,

A complete kinetic model of propane dehydrogenation to produce propene over a Pt–Sn–K/Al2O3 catalyst
was obtained. This has been investigated over the temperature range of 460–540 8C at atmospheric
pressure. A Langmuir–Hinshelwood mechanism provides the best ﬁt for propane dehydrogenation, while
a monolayer–multilayer mechanism is proposed for modelling the coke formation. In addition, the
reaction rate of coke formation and its inﬂuence on catalyst deactivation and subsequent regeneration
have been studied. Finally, a suitable mathematical model is developed for simulating the process
behaviour in a two-zone ﬂuidized bed reactor (TZFBR).

unconverted reactant and inert diluent leave together at the top of
the bed. The good circulation of the solid, characteristic of ﬂuidized
beds, provides transport of solid between both zones and thus a
stationary state is reached. In reactions where the problem is the
fast deactivation of the catalyst by coking, the TZFBR may be
employed to implement continuous catalyst regeneration in the
reactor [4].
In a previous work, our group studied the dehydrogenation of
propane over a commercial Cr2O3/Al2O3 catalyst [5]. This study
focuses on improving the propene yield reached and on the
development of new models of catalyst deactivation. Furthermore,
we present a
complete mechanistic kinetic model for
the
dehydrogenation, the coke formation and its inﬂuence on catalyst
deactivation, and catalyst regeneration using a Pt–Sn–K/Al2O3
catalyst, in order to perform this reaction in a two-zone ﬂuidized
bed reactor.
2. Experimental
2.1. Catalyst preparation
Pt–Sn–K/Al2O3 catalyst was prepared by incipient wet impreg-
nation in accordance with the procedure described in the literature
[6] but with variations in composition. Commercial g-Al2O3
support (Puralox Sasol Germany GmbH) with particle size 160–
250 mm, BET surface area 153 m2 g1, and pore volume 0.45 ml g1
was used with distilled water as the solvent. The nominal
composition of the catalyst was 0.05, 0.14 and 0.10 wt.% of Pt,
Sn and K, respectively.
The catalyst was prepared by sequential impregnation. The
support was ﬁrst impregnated with 6 wt.% of SnCl22H2O (Sigma–
Aldrich, 98% purity) dissolved into HNO3 (Sigma–Aldrich, 1N). It
was then dried in air at 100 8C during 12 h and calcined in a
ﬂuidized
bed
reactor
as
follows.
The
catalyst
was
heated
(3 8C min1) to 550 8C in air and calcined for 2.5 h at this
temperature in humid air. The wet air was then replaced with
dry air and the catalyst was calcined for a further 2 h at 550 8C. The
purpose of the wet calcination was to reduce the chlorine content
of the catalyst [6]. Pt was subsequently impregnated using
H2PtCl66H2O (Sigma–Aldrich, 8 wt.% solution in water), and the
drying
and
calcination
were
repeated.
Finally,
the
K
was
impregnated with potassium nitrate solution (Sigma–Aldrich,
99% purity), and the drying and calcination were again repeated.
The catalyst was ground and sieved to a particle size of 160–
250 mm.
Before the kinetic studies, the catalyst was reduced in situ in a
ﬂow of H2:He = 1:2 during 2 h at 550 8C; reacted in C3H8:Ar = 1:1
during 30 min at 500 8C and regenerated in O2:He = 1:20 during
1 h at 500 8C. This reduction-reaction–regeneration cycle was
repeated six times to obtain an aged and stable catalyst [7,8] with
BET surface area 138 m2 g1 and pore volume 0.45 ml g1.
2.2. Thermogravimetric systems
Coke formation experiments were performed in a CI Electronics
thermobalance, under several different conditions. The reactor feed
contained propane diluted in nitrogen. All the streams were mass
ﬂow controlled (Brooks). The range of operating conditions was as
follows: temperature, 460–540 8C; molar fraction of propane, 0.25–
0.70; catalyst mass, 200 mg; particle size of 160–250 mm; atmo-
spheric pressure and total ﬂow rates of 300 cm3(STP) min1.
A series of previous experiments was conducted varying the
sample mass, particle size and ﬂow rates in order to assure that no
bed depth effect or diffusional limitations were present during the
kinetic tests.

Coke combustion experiments were performed in a Mettler-
Toledo TGA/SDTA 851e micro-thermobalance, in non-isothermal
conditions under a ﬂow of air (50 cm3(STP) min1). The tempera-
ture was programmed from 30 to 600 8C with a heating rate of
5 8C min1.
2.3. Fluidized bed reactor
The kinetic reaction study was carried out using a ﬂuidized bed
reactor
inside
an
electrical
furnace.
The
temperature
was
measured by a thermocouple inside a quartz thermowell, at the
centre of the catalyst bed. A PID controller maintained temperature
variations within 0.5 8C of the set point. The reactor was a 30-mm-
i.d., 300-mm-long quartz tube equipped with a quartz distributor
plate. The reactor feed contained propane diluted in argon. All
streams were mass ﬂow controlled (Brooks). The range of operating
conditions was as follows: temperature, 500–540 8C; percentage of
propane in the reactor feed, 50–100%; catalyst mass, 10–30 g; relative
gas velocity (ur = u0/umf), 1.2–4; a sieve fraction of 160–250 mm. The
minimum ﬂuidization velocity (umf) measured with He at 500 8C was
0.96 cm3(STP) cm2 s1.
The experiments with the two-zone ﬂuidized bed reactor were
carried out in the installation that is described above. And TZFBR
was 30-mm-i.d., 300-mm-long quartz tube equipped with a quartz
distributor plate (for the Ar/O2 mixture). A movable axial quartz
probe was used to introduce the propane at different reactor
heights (ha).
The reaction products were analyzed with an online gas
chromatograph (Agilent 3000 mGC). Besides propene, cracked
products are formed, mainly ethane, ethylene and methane.
Propane conversion and propene selectivity were deﬁned as

where i includes all the components with carbon atoms in the exit
gas stream, ni is the number of carbon atoms of component i and Fi
is its molar ﬂow.
2.4. Kinetic modelling
The
kinetic
modelling
has
been
developed
following
a
procedure previously described [5]. Firstly, the data obtained in
the ﬂuidized bed reactor were ﬁtted to a power-law model and
different mechanistic models assuming a simple deactivation
model. Secondly, thermogravimetric experiments were ﬁtted to
different coke formation models. Finally, the best kinetic models
obtained previously were used to calculate the effect of coke
formation on catalyst deactivation. Statistical parameters of the
ﬁtting were used to discriminate between the proposed models in
all the steps.
The ﬂuidized bed reactor was assumed to be a plug ﬂow reactor
and solved by a ﬁnite difference approach. An isothermal bed was
assumed due to the high-solid mixing. Fittings were performed
with Scientist1 software that uses the Levenberg–Mardquardt
algorithm. To obtain the optimal values of the rate parameters in
the kinetic model, by comparing the experimental data with the
model predictions, the least squares method is used. The kinetic
parameters have been determined with a 95% conﬁdence level.
Once the kinetic has been calculated, the suitability of the
models for representing the kinetic data can be assessed. To choose
the best kinetics model among those proposed in all the steps, the
model selection criteria (MSC) [9] was used. It is useful because it
takes into account the number of parameters of a given model and,
therefore, allows a comparison of different models. The MSC has
been normalized to be independent of the scale of data. Thus, the
most appropriate model is one that has the highest value of MSC.
And it is computed as:

where l is the number of experimental points, p the number of

observations.
3. Experimental results
3.1. Coke formation
Coke formation was measured as a function of time with
thermogravimetric experiments. Fig. 1 displays typical coke
content versus time-on-stream at different temperatures. The
coke content increases abruptly with time-on-stream during
approximately the ﬁrst 10 min followed by a more moderate
linear increase during the rest of the reaction stage. The ﬁnal coke
content and coke formation rate in both the linear and the abrupt
zones increase with the temperature. These results suggest that in
the initial period the coke deposition itself causes the deactivation
of the coking reaction, and after this period a residual coking
activity remains constant in the second zone. Similar trends have
been observed by Gasco
´ n et
al. [5], Pen
˜a et al. [7,8], and van Sint
et
al. [10].
In the studied range, the inﬂuence of the propane concentration
in propane–argon mixtures was not appreciable. After 90 min on
stream, the coke content was 1.8, 2.0 and 1.6 mg coke g1 of
catalyst for, respectively, 25, 50 and 70% of propane in the feed,
with the other conditions being similar (W = 200 mg; QT = 300
cm3(STP) min1; T = 540 8C). The apparent reaction order of the
coking process with respect to the propane concentration was very
low. This effect has also been observed by Gasco
´n et al. [5], van Sint
et al. [10], and Dumez and Froment [11]. In general, the coke
formation includes the adsorption of the hydrocarbons on the
catalysts surface which gives rise to the formation of coke
precursors and later on to coke. It may be hypothesized that
due to the strong hydrocarbon adsorption, the hydrocarbon surface
coverage is close to unity in all the studied experimental conditions

temperatures. W = 200 mg; QT = 300 cm3(STP) min1; propane/argon ratio = 0.5.

and therefore the coke formation is independent of the propane
concentration in the gas phase.
3.2. Dehydrogenation of propane
Fig. 2a shows the effect of temperature on propane conversion
and propene selectivity. In all the cases, a decline in conversion and
propylene selectivity can be observed over time. When comparing
the coke content with propane conversion proﬁles as a function of
time-on-stream, one can observe that the decrease is similar in
both parameters, indicating that coke accumulation on the
catalysts is responsible for the conversion decrease.
At
short
times,
the
propane
conversion
increases
with
temperature, as may be expected since both dehydrogenation
and cracking are very endothermic reactions. However, the activity
initially decreases faster at high temperatures, due again to a faster
coke formation. Therefore, propane conversion after 2 h on stream,
in the studied range, is higher with the lower temperature.
Selectivity to propene (Fig. 2a) decreases with temperature
because its effect over the cracking reaction is stronger than over
dehydrogenation.
The inﬂuence of the feed composition is shown in Fig. 2b.
Propane conversion is almost independent of propane concentra-
tion, indicating a kinetic order close to 1 for propane pressure. The
propylene selectivity slightly decreases when propane concentra-
tion is increased, and catalyst deactivation is similar in all
experiments performed.
The propane conversion increases with spatial time (Fig. 2c)
while the selectivity to propene remains nearly constant. This
behaviour indicates that cracking products are mainly formed from
propane.
4. Kinetic modelling results
The proposed kinetic scheme for the propane reactions over the
prepared Pt–Sn–K/Al2O3 catalyst is a parallel network:
 dehydrogenation reaction:
C3H8 $ C3H6 þ H2
(I)
 cracking reaction:
C3H8 ! Cracking products
(II)
 coke formation:
C3H8 ! Coke
(III)
4.1. Dehydrogenation of propane and cracking reaction
Several models (Table 1) have been tested in order to obtain the
best ﬁt for the dehydrogenation reaction. The ﬁrst corresponds to a
power-law equation. The others are based on the mechanistic
Langmuir–Hinshelwood model. LHHW-1 supposes that adsorption
equilibrium constants for propane and propene have the same
order of magnitude. LHHW-2 assumes that propane adsorption is
negligible. After combining reaction and adsorption equilibrium

and performing the active sites balance, the equations shown in
Table 1 for each mechanism are obtained. The reaction rate
constants are described by the Arrhenius equation. This can be
expressed in a reparameterised form as follows:
ki ¼ k0i exp  Eai
R
1
T  1
T0




(4)
where Eai is the activation energy, T0 the reference temperature
(equal to 793.15 K, which was the average temperature in the
range investigated), R the gas constant (8.314 J mol1 K1), and k0i
the kinetic constant at T0. In all cases, the cracking reaction has
been ﬁtted to a power-law rate expression with ﬁrst order relative
to propane, with constant activity.
To choose between the different kinetic models proposed, all
the kinetic data were ﬁtted using a simple and empirical
deactivation model. This avoids potential errors resulting from
extrapolating data to initial times to obtain initial rates. The model
combines
an
exponential
activity–coke
relationship
and
an
empirical function of coke content with the time-on-stream:
Dumez and Froment [11]:
a ¼ expðBCCÞ
(5)
Voorhies [12]:
CC ¼ Atp
(6)
Thus, the activity–time relationship is given by
a ¼ expðltpÞ
(7)
where l is given by l = l0 exp[(Eal/R)((1/T)  (1/T0))] and p a
ﬁxed value (p = 0.5) which does not depend on temperature. The
use of this activity–time relationship allows us to employ all the
conversion-selectivity data and not only from the extrapolation to
0 time.
As may be seen in Table 2, the best ﬁtting obtained (best MSC
value) was for the Langmuir–Hinshelwood mechanism (LHHW-2)
that accounts for inhibition by propene due to adsorption. This is
the chosen model and it agrees with the equation proposed by Wan
and Chu [13], for a ZnO/silicalite catalyst and Gasco
´n et al. [5], for a
Cr2O3/Al2O3 catalyst. This mechanistic model produced a better ﬁt
than the empirical potential model.
4.2. Coke formation kinetics
The model used in this work to describe coke formation is a
simple mechanistic model called the monolayer–multilayer coke
growth model (MMCGM). This model was ﬁrst proposed by Nam
and Kittrell [14], generalized by Corella and Monzo
´n [15], and used
successfully by several authors [7,8,10,14–18]. In this model, the
rate of coke deposition with time is given by the sum of coke
formation on the surface of the catalyst (monolayer coke) and the
rate of the simultaneous multilayer coke deposition:
dCC
dt ¼ dCm
dt þ dCM
dt
(8)
The formation of monolayer coke is proportional to the fraction
of sites uncovered on the ﬁrst layer:
rCm ¼ dCm
dt ¼ k1CðCmax  CmÞh
(9)
where Cm is the coke concentration in monolayer, Cmax is the
maximum coke concentration in monolayer, k1C is a kinetic
coefﬁcient and h is the kinetic order for monolayer coke formation.
The formation of multilayer can start as soon as there is
monolayer coke available and is proportional to the fraction of sites
covered on the monolayer:
rCM ¼ dCM
dt
¼ k2CCn
m
(10)
where CM is the coke concentration in multilayer, k2C is the kinetic
coefﬁcient and n is the kinetic order for coke formation in
multilayer.
Both kinetic constants (k1C and k2C) are functions of the
temperature and of the presence of hydrocarbons. The effect of
partial pressure of hydrocarbons has been proved null in Section
3.1. Regarding temperature, Arrhenius-type parameters are used
for both monolayer coke (i = 1) and multilayer coke (i = 2)
formation:
kiC ¼ k0iC exp  EaiC
R
1
T  1
T0




(11)
The values tested for the kinetic orders (h and n) are shown in
Table 1 together with integrated equations for these values. Model
C2 shows the best MSC value (Table 2) and gives an excellent ﬁt of
the coke versus time data at the different temperatures studied
(model prediction curves in Fig. 1). This model has been chosen for
the following steps of the ﬁtting.
The parameters obtained (Table 4) for coke formation show
several interesting features. The ﬁtting obtained for the kinetic
order for monolayer coke formation (h = 2) would support the
results found by other authors [7,15] that the coke formation step
involves two sites and also satisfactorily describes the remarkable
initial increase in the coke formation rates versus time. The value of
the kinetic order for multilayer coke formation (n = 0) is consistent
with the experimental results since this value predicts a constant
activity
of
the
multilayer
coke.
The
activation
energy
for
monolayer coking (38.4 kJ mol1) is lower than for multilayer
coking (125.5 kJ mol1), which could be predicted for coke, which
forms directly on the catalyst surface where metals can promote
coke formation. Similar results were obtained by van Sint et al.
[10], for Pt/Al2O3 catalyst and Gasco
´n et al. [5], for Cr2O3/Al2O3
catalyst. It should also be noted that, in the ﬁtting, the maximum
coke concentration in monolayer is ﬁxed for all the temperatures
investigated. This value is 1 mg coke g1 of catalysts.
4.3. Deactivation model
Several authors have proposed different expressions in order to
correlate activity with coke content in catalysts [5,7,11,19–21].
Having chosen the best kinetic mechanism and the coke formation
kinetics, the next step was to ﬁnd the relationship between the
coke content in the catalyst and the propane dehydrogenation
activity.

Coke deposited on the catalyst surface covers part of the active
sites, resulting in the reduction of catalyst activity. According to
the
kinetic
scheme,
only
monolayer
coke
would
promote
deactivation. This would imply that after all the monolayer coke
was formed, the catalyst would have some remaining activity.
However, the experimental activity–time results prove that
activity decreases continuously with time, even after the mono-
layer has been fully formed. This suggests that multilayer coke also
deactivates. The existence of catalytic activity even after the
surface has been covered by coke can be explained by some
catalytic activity of the coke itself, as has been found by several
authors [5,19,22].
Three deactivation models have been tested, the empirical
expressions shown in Table 1, where g1 varies with temperature
according to the Arrhenius equation and g2 and g3 are constants
independent of the temperature. The ﬁrst deactivation model (D1)
considers that catalyst activity depends on active sites in the
catalyst surface. The other models (D2 and D3) associate the
catalyst activity with the active sites in the catalyst surface and
the remaining activity of the monolayer coke, Cm.
The best MSC value is obtained for model D3 (Table 2), and it
can be seen (Fig. 3) that the predicted values of the time evolution
of molar ﬂow for propane, propene and cracking products have a
good correlation with the experimental ones.
Table 4 lists the parameters for the chosen model (Table 3). The
equilibrium constant value obtained for propene adsorption is very
high. Furthermore, the activation energy of thermal cracking is
greater than for the propane dehydrogenation (Table 4), in
agreement with what is expected for a gas phase phenomenon
versus a catalytic process as has been reported previously [5]. A
small standard deviation of kinetic parameters is obtained due to
the large quantity of experimental data, which contributes to more
precise results from a statistical point of view. Furthermore, the
overall quality of the ﬁts to the experimental data can be judged
from the parity plots for molar ﬂow of propane and propene at the
reactor exit (Figs. 4 and 5), and an acceptable agreement of
experimental and calculated data was found in the range of
operating conditions used in this study.
4.4. Coke combustion kinetics
The catalyst regeneration was carried out by coke combustion
in non-isothermal conditions. Traditionally, analysis methods for
non-isothermal data have been used in reactions of thermal
decomposition (solid–gas). In order to model the weight loss of the
solid in these reactions, the following expression is used:
 dCC
dt ¼ kOXðTÞCm
C PO2
(12)
where kOX(T) is given by kOXðTÞ ¼ k0OX eðEa=Rðð1=TÞð1=T0ÞÞÞ, CC is the
coke concentration in the catalyst (mg coke (mg catalyst)1), m is
the kinetic order for coke combustion, PO2 is the oxygen partial
pressure and if a temperature ramp of constant heating rate b
(K min1) is used, the time–temperature relationship is T = T0 + bt,
where T0 is the initial temperature. Assuming m = 1, considering
coke
conversion
as
XC = (C0Ct)/C0
and
k0
0OX ¼ PO2k0OX;

5. Simulation of a two-zone ﬂuidized bed reactor
As stated in Section 1, one of the requirements for the kinetic
model developed in this work was that it should be able to predict
reasonably well the performance of a two-zone ﬂuidized bed
reactor (Fig. 7).
The model used for the reactor simulation contains no adjustable
parameters and is in steady-state condition. In the two-zone
ﬂuidized bed reactor propane and oxygen are fed at different levels,
providing separated zones for the reaction and catalyst regeneration
and, in spite of the continuous coke formation, steady state is
achieved because a dynamic equilibrium between coke formation in
the reducing zone and coke burning in the oxidizing zone. The
kinetics data were obtained independently, as described above. In
order to take into account the ascending ﬂow of solid, a three-phase
model is proposed that includes the emulsion, bubble and wake
phases where the gas existing inside the bubble, including the wake,
is perfectly mixed [23]. It has been assumed that the gas rises in the
emulsion at the minimum ﬂuidisation velocity and that the
remaining gas rises with the bubbles. The pressure, temperature,
bubble size, fraction of bed in bubbles and fraction of the bubble
volumeoccupied by the wakewere consideredtobe constant. Under
steady-state conditions, the mass conservation equations for a given
gaseous species i are the following:
In the bubble and wake phase:
dFi;B
dz ¼ KB;EAða þ a f WÞðCi;B  Ci;EÞ þ Ri;BrcatAa f Wð1  emfÞ

The rising velocity for bubbles in a bubbling bed is calculated
with the gas velocity (u0):
uB ¼ ðu0  umfÞ þ 0:711ðgdbÞ0:5
(16)

(KB,E) is calculated as [24]:

The bubble diameter is calculated as the average values given
by the Mori and Wen equation [25] with the initial and ﬁnal bubble
diameters. The fraction of bubbles in the bed and the gas exchange
coefﬁcient between emulsion and bubble (KE,B) are calculated to
assure mass balance.
Regarding the ﬂow of solid, the main variable is the coke
concentration, which will vary along the bed. In this case, the mass
conservation equations are as follows:
In wake phase:
us;W
dCC;W
dz
¼ KW;EðCC;W  CC;EÞ þ RC;W
(18)
In the emulsion phase:
us;E
dCC;E
dz
¼ KE;WðCC;W  CC;EÞ þ RC;E
(19)
The wake velocity is assumed to be the bubble velocity, and the
emulsion velocity is calculated to assure the mass balance. The
exchange velocity of solid between wakes and emulsion is
calculated with an exchange coefﬁcient, using the following
equation proposed by Lim et al. [26]:
KW;E ¼ 0:15
db
(20)
The mass balances constitute a system of ordinary differ-
ential equations at steady state. This set of equations was solved
by a Runge–Kutta–Merson method, ﬁtting the concentration of
the coke in the bottom of the reactor that would close the total
mass balance for all the elementary components (carbon and
oxygen).
A comparison between theoretical and experimental results is
shown in Fig. 8. In the TZFBR, the percentage of oxygen in the feed
to the reactor is one of the most important variables [5]. Fig. 8a
shows its effect for a set of experiments performed with a constant
input of propane (306 cm3(STP) min1) and varying argon and
oxygen ﬂuxes, keeping its addition constant (306 cm3(STP) min1).
It may be seen that the model predicts satisfactorily the
experimental trends, although the propane conversion is slightly
higher and propene selectivity slightly lower. This difference could
be attributed to the assumption made in the model, where oxygen
that does not react with coke is used to burn propane, and
experimentally the formation of water has been observed due to
the reaction of oxygen with hydrogen. Therefore, CO2 formation is
overestimated and a higher propane conversion and lower
selectivity to propene are predicted. This effect increases with
the oxygen content. Finally, Fig. 8b shows the effect of the
temperature.
The
simulation
predicts
a
slight
decrease
of
the conversion and a mild decrease of the selectivity with the
temperature.
6. Conclusions
A complete kinetic model of propane dehydrogenation over a
Pt–Sn–K/g-Al2O3 catalyst has been developed. Extensive experi-
mental
work
has
been
performed
to
obtain
the
kinetic
parameters involved in the reaction, in the coke formation, in
the activity–coke content relationship and in the catalyst
regeneration. A Langmuir–Hinshelwood mechanism with strong
adsorption of propene has been chosen as it provides the best ﬁt
to describe the reaction kinetics. A monolayer–multilayer coke
deposition model successfully describes the coking behaviour of
Pt–Sn–K/Al2O3 catalyst during the dehydrogenation of propane.
The relationship between coke content in the catalyst and
catalyst activity has also been studied and determined, with the
activity being related with both monolayer and multilayer coke.
A power-law model has been proposed to describe the catalyst
regeneration. The complete model explains reasonably well the
qualitative and quantitative observations presented in this
work.
A three-phase reactor model combined with the proposed
kinetic model describes satisfactorily the conversion and propene
selectivity found experimentally in the catalytic dehydrogenation
of propane in a two-zone ﬂuidized bed reactor. Moreover, it
explains their variations with the operating variables.
