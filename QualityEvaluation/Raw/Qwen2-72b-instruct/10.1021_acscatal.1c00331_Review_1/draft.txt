1. The composition, variability, and analysis of coke deposits in catalytic systems, with a focus on propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions, considering the influence of reaction conditions, catalyst types, and analytical techniques on the complex nature of coke formation and characterization.

The intricate nature of coke deposits in catalytic systems, particularly in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions, has been elucidated through a plethora of studies, revealing a complex interplay between reaction conditions, catalyst types, and the resulting coke composition \[10.1021/acscatal.1c00331_1\]. GC-MS and TG analysis have identified coke as primarily comprising aliphatics, aromatics, and pregraphite, with the specific species of coke deposition varying on different catalysts, such as atomic carbon or aromatics on Pt/Al2O3 and C3 species on PtSn/Al2O3 catalysts \[10.1021/acscatal.1c00331_1\]. Operando Raman spectroscopy has further illuminated the nature of coke deposits, demonstrating that hydrogen alters the nature of the coke, resulting in a more ordered system with fewer defects, smaller graphitic crystallites, and an increased D1/G ratio \[10.1039/c3cp50646k\]. The amount of amorphous coke decreases with increasing hydrogen content, and experiments with lower propane concentrations show a strong increase in selectivity, with less coke of a more graphitic nature detected, suggesting a link between disordered coke deposits and side reactions like cracking \[10.1039/c3cp50646k\]. TGA experiments confirm that less coke is formed in the presence of hydrogen, and that this coke combusts at higher temperatures, consistent with a more graphitic nature \[10.1039/c3cp50646k\]. Three types of coke have been identified: coke on and in the vicinity of the metal, coke on the carrier, and graphitic coke on the carrier \[10.1006/jcat.1996.0361\]. The formation of the first two types of coke increases with temperature and partial pressure of propene, while hydrogen suppresses their formation. The amount of graphitic coke increases with temperature and propane partial pressure \[10.1006/jcat.1996.0361\]. A model suggests that only a minor part of the coke deactivates the catalyst, and this deactivating coke is formed in parallel with the other coke types \[10.1006/jcat.1996.0361\]. The graphitic coke on the carrier is formed through a separate mechanism \[10.1006/jcat.1996.0361\]. Analytical techniques such as thermal gravimetric analysis, IR spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy, and elemental analysis have been employed to elucidate the complex nature and diversity of coke constituents in these systems \[10.1007/s11244-011-9708-8\].

                Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: Considering the advancements and findings discussed in the file, there lies an opportunity to explore emerging fields and innovative methodologies. Future research endeavors might focus on developing more sophisticated analytical techniques to further elucidate the complex nature of coke formation and its impact on catalyst performance. The integration of machine learning algorithms with experimental data could potentially predict coke formation under various conditions, aiding in the design of more efficient and robust catalysts. Moreover, the development of in-situ and operando techniques that can monitor coke formation in real-time could provide deeper insights into the dynamic processes occurring during PDH reactions. The exploration of alternative feedstocks and reaction conditions that minimize coke formation could also be a fruitful area of investigation, potentially leading to more sustainable and economically viable PDH processes.
