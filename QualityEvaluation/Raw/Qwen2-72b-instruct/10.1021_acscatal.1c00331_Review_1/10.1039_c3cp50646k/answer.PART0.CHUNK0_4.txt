[1] "Operando Raman spectroscopy showed that hydrogen altered the nature of the coke deposits formed during propane dehydrogenation."
[2] "First of all, the Raman bands become narrower, which suggest a more ordered system with less defects."
[3] "Secondly, the shift in the position of the G Raman band implies that the size of the graphitic crystallites is decreased."
[4] "Finally, the D1/G ratio increases as the H2 concentration in the feed increases."
[5] "The amount of amorphous coke, as shown by the intensity of the D3 band decreases with increasing hydrogen content, but the error bars regarding the position and width are very large."
[6] "Catalyst cycling does not affect the Raman band positions,related widths and the ratio between the D1/G bands in most experiments performed, with the exception of experiments with 50 and 25% propane on the Pt/Al2O3 catalyst and 75% propane feed on the Pt-Sn/Al2O3 catalyst."
[7] "In these cases, three trends are observed as a function of catalyst cycling. First of all, the relative intensity of the coke bands drops over each following cycle."
[8] "Furthermore, the D1/G ratio drops from ca. 0.74 to 0.35."
[9] "Finally,the width of the D1 and G bands increases."
[10] "These trends suggest that less coke, with a more graphitic nature, is deposited for each consecutive cycle."
[11] "Interestingly, for these experiments the selectivity increases for each following cycle, suggesting a correlation with the type of coke formed: as less coke is deposited, which has a more graphitic nature, side reactions such as cracking are suppressed."

1.Operando Raman spectroscopy has been used to study the nature of coke deposits in catalytic systems, particularly in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. Hydrogen has been found to alter the nature of the coke deposits, leading to a more ordered system with less defects, smaller graphitic crystallites, and an increased D1/G ratio. The amount of amorphous coke decreases with increasing hydrogen content. Catalyst cycling affects the Raman band positions, widths, and D1/G ratio in some experiments, suggesting that less coke with a more graphitic nature is deposited for each consecutive cycle. This correlates with an increase in selectivity, as less coke deposition suppresses side reactions such as cracking.

1.在催化系统中，特别是在丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应中，使用原位拉曼光谱研究了焦炭沉积物的性质。氢被发现会改变焦炭沉积物的性质，导致一个缺陷更少、更有序的系统，更小的石墨结晶体，以及D1/G比值的增加。随着氢含量的增加，无定形焦炭的数量减少。催化剂循环在某些实验中影响了拉曼带的位置、宽度和D1/G比值，表明每连续一个周期，沉积的焦炭更少，性质更石墨化。这与选择性的增加相关，因为较少的焦炭沉积抑制了裂解等副反应。
