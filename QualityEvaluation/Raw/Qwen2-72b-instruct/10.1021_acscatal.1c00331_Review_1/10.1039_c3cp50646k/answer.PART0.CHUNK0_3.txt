[1] "Operando Raman spectroscopy showed that hydrogen altered the nature of the coke deposits formed during propane dehydrogenation."
[2] "First of all, the Raman bands become narrower, which suggest a more ordered system with less defects."
[3] "Secondly, the shift in the position of the G Raman band implies that the size of the graphitic crystallites is decreased."
[4] "Finally, the D1/G ratio increases as the H2 concentration in the feed increases."
[5] "The amount of amorphous coke, as shown by the intensity of the D3 band decreases with increasing hydrogen content, but the error bars regarding the position and width are very large."
[6] "Catalyst cycling does not affect the Raman band positions,related widths and the ratio between the D1/G bands in most experiments performed, with the exception of experiments with 50 and 25% propane on the Pt/Al2O3 catalyst and 75% propane feed on the Pt-Sn/Al2O3 catalyst."
[7] "Interestingly, for these experiments the selectivity increases for each following cycle, suggesting a correlation with the type of coke formed: as less coke is deposited, which has a more graphitic nature, side reactions such as cracking are suppressed."
[8] "The Raman spectroscopy data can be used to find an explanation for the trends observed in the activity data."
[9] "The increase in propane dehydrogenation conversion observed with increasing H2 concentration is related to the decreased deposition of coke, which was detected by operando Raman spectroscopy."
[10] "Finally,the experiments with propane concentrations of 25 and 50% show a strong increase in selectivity for each consecutive cycle."
[11] "For these specific experiments, less coke of a more graphitic nature is detected by operando Raman spectroscopy, suggesting a link between the presence of relatively disordered coke deposits and side reactions,such as cracking."

1.Operando Raman spectroscopy has been used to study the nature of coke deposits in catalytic systems, particularly in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. Hydrogen was found to alter the nature of the coke deposits, resulting in a more ordered system with fewer defects, smaller graphitic crystallites, and an increased D1/G ratio. The amount of amorphous coke decreases with increasing hydrogen content. Catalyst cycling affects the Raman band positions, widths, and D1/G ratio in some experiments, with a correlation between the type of coke formed and selectivity. The increase in propane dehydrogenation conversion with increasing hydrogen concentration is related to decreased coke deposition. Experiments with lower propane concentrations show a strong increase in selectivity, with less coke of a more graphitic nature detected, suggesting a link between disordered coke deposits and side reactions like cracking.

1.操作拉曼光谱已被用于研究催化系统中焦炭沉积物的性质，特别是在丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应中。发现氢改变了焦炭沉积物的性质，导致更有序的系统，缺陷更少，石墨结晶体更小，D1/G比值增加。随着氢含量的增加，无定形焦炭的数量减少。催化剂循环在某些实验中影响拉曼带的位置、宽度和D1/G比值，焦炭形成类型与选择性之间存在相关性。随着氢浓度的增加，丙烷脱氢转化率的增加与焦炭沉积的减少有关。丙烷浓度较低的实验显示出选择性的显著增加，检测到的焦炭较少，性质更石墨化，表明无序焦炭沉积物与裂解等副反应之间存在联系。
