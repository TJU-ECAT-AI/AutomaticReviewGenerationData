          [1] "Operando Raman spectroscopy showed that hydrogen altered the nature of the coke deposits formed during propane dehydrogenation."
          [2] "First of all, the Raman bands become narrower, which suggest a more ordered system with less defects."
          [3] "Secondly, the shift in the position of the G Raman band implies that the size of the graphitic crystallites is decreased."
          [4] "Finally, the D1/G ratio increases as the H2 concentration in the feed increases."
          [5] "The amount of amorphous coke, as shown by the intensity of the D3 band decreases with increasing hydrogen content, but the error bars regarding the position and width are very large."
          [6] "Catalyst cycling does not affect the Raman band positions,related widths and the ratio between the D1/G bands in most experiments performed, with the exception of experiments with 50 and 25% propane on the Pt/Al2O3 catalyst and 75% propane feed on the Pt-Sn/Al2O3 catalyst."
          [7] "In these cases, three trends are observed as a function of catalyst cycling. First of all, the relative intensity of the coke bands drops over each following cycle."
          [8] "Furthermore, the D1/G ratio drops from ca. 0.74 to 0.35."
          [9] "Finally,the width of the D1 and G bands increases."
          [10] "These trends suggest that less coke, with a more graphitic nature, is deposited for each consecutive cycle."
          [11] "Interestingly, for these experiments the selectivity increases for each following cycle, suggesting a correlation with the type of coke formed: as less coke is deposited, which has a more graphitic nature, side reactions such as cracking are suppressed."
          [12] "The Raman spectroscopy data can be used to find an explanation for the trends observed in the activity data."
          [13] "The increase in propane dehydrogenation conversion observed with increasing H2 concentration is related to the decreased deposition of coke, which was detected by operando Raman spectroscopy."
          [14] "The low initial selectivity can be explained by the fact that highly active sites present on the catalyst induce cracking and hydrogenolysis in the presence of H2."
          [15] "As the catalyst is cycled,less cracking products are observed, suggesting these sites become poisoned."
          [16] "Finally,the experiments with propane concentrations of 25 and 50% show a strong increase in selectivity for each consecutive cycle."
          [17] "For these specific experiments, less coke of a more graphitic nature is detected by operando Raman spectroscopy, suggesting a link between the presence of relatively disordered coke deposits and side reactions,such as cracking."
          [18] "Thermogravimetrical analysis (TGA) experiments, shown in the supplementary information Fig. S4, on deactivated Pt/Al2O3 and Pt-Sn/Al2O3 catalysts support the findings found by operando Raman spectroscopy."
          [19] "The amount of coke combusted decreases as H2 is added in the feed."
          [20] "Furthermore, the temperature at which this coke is combusted is increased from 450C to 600C for the feed consisting of 50% propane and 50% H2."
          [21] "In literature it has been reported many times, that disordered carbon combusts at lower temperatures than highly ordered graphitic sheets."
          [22] "On the other hand coke in the proximity of supported Pt particles is also more readily combusted, as the Pt can catalyse coke combustion."
          [23] "During propene hydrogenation much larger quantities of coke (around 20wt%) are formed, because large concentrations of propene rapidly polymerize to coke on the catalyst support."
          [24] "This coke is combusted at temperatures between 450 and 600C."
          [25] "We propose that in the presence of high concentrations of H2,more graphitic coke is formed that mainly covers the catalyst support."
          [26] "In the absence of H2, more disordered coke is formed,that is also present on the supported Pt nanoparticles."
          [27] "H2 assists in keeping the surface of the Pt free of these disordered coke species."

          Operando Raman spectroscopy has been used to study the nature of coke deposits in catalytic systems, particularly in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. Hydrogen was found to alter the nature of the coke deposits, resulting in a more ordered system with fewer defects, smaller graphitic crystallites, and an increased D1/G ratio. The amount of amorphous coke decreases with increasing hydrogen content. Catalyst cycling affects the Raman band positions, widths, and D1/G ratio in some experiments, with a correlation between the type of coke formed and selectivity. The increase in propane dehydrogenation conversion with increasing hydrogen concentration is related to decreased coke deposition. Experiments with lower propane concentrations show a strong increase in selectivity, with less coke of a more graphitic nature detected, suggesting a link between disordered coke deposits and side reactions like cracking. TGA experiments confirm that less coke is formed in the presence of hydrogen, and that this coke combusts at higher temperatures, consistent with a more graphitic nature. During propene hydrogenation, larger quantities of coke are formed, combusting at lower temperatures due to the presence of disordered carbon. In the presence of high hydrogen concentrations, more graphitic coke is formed, covering the catalyst support and keeping the surface of the Pt free of disordered coke species.

          在催化系统中，特别是在丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应中，使用原位拉曼光谱研究了焦炭沉积物的性质。氢被发现会改变焦炭沉积物的性质，导致一个缺陷更少、更有序的系统，更小的石墨结晶体，以及D1/G比值的增加。随着氢含量的增加，无定形焦炭的数量减少。催化剂循环在某些实验中影响了拉曼带的位置、宽度和D1/G比值，表明每连续一个周期，沉积的焦炭更少，性质更石墨化。这与选择性的增加相关，因为较少的焦炭沉积抑制了裂解等副反应。热重分析(TGA)实验确认，在氢气存在下，形成的焦炭较少，这种焦炭在更高的温度下燃烧，与更石墨的性质一致。在丙烯氢化过程中，形成更大数量的焦炭，在较低的温度下燃烧，由于存在无序的碳。在高氢气浓度下，形成更多的石墨焦炭，覆盖催化剂载体，并保持Pt表面免受无序焦炭物种的影响。
