[4] "Finally, the D1/G ratio increases as the H2 concentration in the feed increases."
[5] "The amount of amorphous coke, as shown by the intensity of the D3 band decreases with increasing hydrogen content, but the error bars regarding the position and width are very large."
[6] "Catalyst cycling does not affect the Raman band positions,related widths and the ratio between the D1/G bands in most experiments performed, with the exception of experiments with 50 and 25% propane on the Pt/Al2O3 catalyst and 75% propane feed on the Pt-Sn/Al2O3 catalyst."
[7] "Interestingly, for these experiments the selectivity increases for each following cycle, suggesting a correlation with the type of coke formed: as less coke is deposited, which has a more graphitic nature, side reactions such as cracking are suppressed."
[8] "The Raman spectroscopy data can be used to find an explanation for the trends observed in the activity data."

The amount of amorphous coke decreases with increasing hydrogen content. Catalyst cycling affects the Raman band positions, widths, and D1/G ratio in some experiments, with a correlation between the type of coke formed and selectivity. The Raman spectroscopy data provides insights into the trends observed in the activity data, with increased propane dehydrogenation conversion related to decreased coke deposition. Experiments with lower propane concentrations show a strong increase in selectivity, linked to the presence of relatively disordered coke deposits and side reactions.

1.Operando Raman spectroscopy has been used to study the nature of coke deposits formed during propane dehydrogenation reactions. Hydrogen has been found to alter the nature of these deposits, leading to a more ordered system with fewer defects, smaller graphitic crystallites, and an increased D1/G ratio. The amount of amorphous coke decreases with increasing hydrogen content. Catalyst cycling affects the intensity of coke bands, the D1/G ratio, and the width of the D1 and G bands, suggesting that less coke with a more graphitic nature is deposited with each cycle. This correlates with an increase in selectivity, indicating that less disordered coke leads to fewer side reactions. The Raman spectroscopy data supports the trends observed in activity data, with increased hydrogen concentration leading to decreased coke deposition and increased propane dehydrogenation conversion. The initial low selectivity is attributed to highly active sites inducing cracking and hydrogenolysis in the presence of hydrogen, which are poisoned over time. Experiments with lower propane concentrations show a strong increase in selectivity with each cycle, linked to less disordered coke deposits. TGA experiments confirm that less coke is formed in the presence of hydrogen, and that this coke combusts at higher temperatures, consistent with a more graphitic nature. During propene hydrogenation, larger quantities of coke are formed, combusting at lower temperatures due to the presence of disordered carbon. In the presence of high hydrogen concentrations, more graphitic coke is formed, covering the catalyst support and keeping the surface of the Pt free of disordered coke species.

1.在催化系统中，特别是在丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应中，操作拉曼光谱已被用于研究焦炭沉积物的性质。氢气改变了丙烷脱氢过程中形成的焦炭沉积物的性质，使拉曼带变窄，表明系统更加有序，缺陷更少。G拉曼带位置的移动表明石墨晶粒的尺寸减小。随着H2进料浓度的增加，D1/G比增加。随着氢含量的增加，无定形焦炭的量减少。催化剂循环影响某些实验中拉曼带的位置、宽度和D1/G带之间的比率。焦炭带的相对强度随每个后续循环而下降。D1/G比从大约0.74下降到0.35。D1和G带的宽度增加。这些趋势表明，随着每个连续循环，沉积的焦炭更少，性质更石墨化。选择性随每个后续循环而增加，表明与形成的焦炭类型有关。拉曼光谱数据可用于解释活动数据中观察到的趋势。随着H2浓度的增加，丙烷脱氢转化率的增加与焦炭沉积的减少有关。初始选择性较低可以解释为催化剂上存在高度活性位点，在H2存在下诱导裂解和氢解。随着催化剂的循环，观察到的裂解产物减少，表明这些位点被毒化。丙烷浓度为25%和50%的实验显示，每个连续循环的选择性显著增加。操作拉曼光谱检测到更少的、性质更石墨化的焦炭，表明相对无序的焦炭沉积物与裂解等副反应之间存在联系。热重分析(TGA)实验支持操作拉曼光谱发现的发现。随着H2的加入，燃烧的焦炭量减少。对于由50%丙烷和50%H2组成的进料，这种焦炭燃烧的温度从450C增加到600C。无序碳在比高度有序的石墨片更低的温度下燃烧。在受支持的Pt颗粒附近，焦炭也更容易燃烧，因为Pt可以催化焦炭燃烧。在丙烯氢化过程中，由于大量丙烯迅速在催化剂支撑上聚合成焦炭，形成了大量焦炭(约20wt%)。这种焦炭在450到600C之间的温度下燃烧。在高浓度H2的存在下，形成了更多的石墨化焦炭，主要覆盖催化剂支撑。在没有H2的情况下，形成了更多的无序焦炭，也存在于受支持的Pt颗粒上。H2有助于保持Pt表面不受这些无序焦炭物种的污染。
