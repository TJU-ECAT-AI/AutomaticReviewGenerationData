[2] "The rate of coke formation on the metal is weakly dependent on the propylene and hydrogen pressures but increasing with the propane pressure, while the rate of coke formation on the support is increasing with the propane and propylene pressures and decreasing with the hydrogen pressure."

1.在催化系统中，特别是在丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应中，焦炭沉积物的组成随不同的反应条件和催化剂类型而变化。在金属上形成的焦炭比在支撑物上形成的焦炭更软(含有更多的氢)。金属上焦炭的形成速率对丙烯和氢的压力依赖性较弱，但与丙烷压力同时增加。支撑物上焦炭的形成速率与丙烷和丙烯的压力同时增加，而与氢的压力降低。在金属上形成的焦炭具有烷烃的特性，含有的氢比在支撑物上形成的焦炭多。在支撑物上形成的焦炭具有芳香特性。热重分析、红外光谱、拉曼光谱和元素分析等分析技术已被用于阐明这些系统中焦炭成分的复杂性质和多样性。

1. The composition of coke deposits in catalytic systems, particularly in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions, varies across different reaction conditions and catalyst types. The coke formed on the metal is softer and contains more hydrogen than that formed on the support. Analytical techniques such as thermal gravimetric analysis, IR spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy, and elemental analysis have been employed to elucidate the complex nature and diversity of coke constituents in these systems.

1. 在催化系统中，特别是在丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应中，焦炭沉积物的组成随不同的反应条件和催化剂类型而变化。在金属上形成的焦炭比在支撑物上形成的焦炭更软，含氢量更高。已经使用了热重分析、红外光谱、拉曼光谱和元素分析等分析技术来阐明这些系统中焦炭成分的复杂性和多样性。
