1. The composition of coke deposits in catalytic systems, particularly in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions, varies across different reaction conditions and catalyst types. Coke formed on the metal is softer and contains more hydrogen than that formed on the support. Analytical techniques employed to elucidate the complex nature and diversity of coke constituents in these systems include thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA), infrared (IR) spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy, and elemental analysis.

1. 在催化系统中，特别是在丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应中，焦炭沉积物的组成随不同的反应条件和催化剂类型而变化。在金属上形成的焦炭比在支撑物上形成的焦炭更软，含氢量更高。用于阐明这些系统中焦炭成分复杂性和多样性的分析技术包括热重分析(TGA)、红外(IR)光谱、拉曼光谱和元素分析。
