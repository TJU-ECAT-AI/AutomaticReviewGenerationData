Abstract Propane dehydrogenation over alumina-supported Pt-Sn catalysts has been studied in an oscillating rnicrobalance reactor (TEOM). The kinetics of coke formation and the deactivation functions for the coking and the dehydrogenation reaction were determined. The selected model describes the formation of coke (measured as the mass increase) on the catalyst well over the entire temperature range studied (450-580 independent of whether hydrogen was present in the feed gas or not. A commercial Pt/AlO 3 catalyst (CK 303) showed a higher degree of deactivation although the coking rate was lower. The initial activity is difficult to determine due to rapid initial deactivation. A model based on fitting the turnover frequency against the measured coke deposition (as opposed to time on stream) is found to give improved estimates of the initial activity.
1. INTRODUCTION
Platinum is a key ingredient in most dehydrogenation catalysts due to its high activity for C- H bond rupture coupled with its poor ability to cleave C-C bonds [1]. Improvements in selectivity and in particular with respect to the catalyst stability towards deactivation due to coking may be achieved by catalyst modifications. It has become a common practice to incorporate a second metal (Sn, Ag, Ge, Pb) [2-6] and/or alkali metals [24].
Different mechanisms have been proposed for the enhanced lifetime of dehydrogenation catalyst as a result of Sn addition, pointing to such effects as inhibition of the formation of dehydrogenated hydrocarbon species required for coking, isomerization and hydrogenolysis [1]. These undesired side reactions have been identified as structure sensitive reactions [1,2].
Dilution of Pt with a second metal whichbreaks down the Pt ensembles, favours the structm insensitive dehydrogenation reaction. Dehydrogenation catalysts should preferably have a non-acidic support in contrast to bifimctional reforming catalysts. Elimination of acidic sites during catalyst preparation is one way of suppressing undesired reactions [6]. AlO 3 is frequently used as a support for dehydrogenation reactions despite its acidic character, mainly due to its high mechanical strength and because it provides high metal dispersions.Dehydrogenation reactions are limit by equih'brium and high temperatures are required to obtain high yields of the alkenes. Unforttmately, operation at elevated temperatures often gives lower selectivities and increased catalyst deactivation by coke formation. Temperature 334 programmed oxidation (TPO) has frequently been used to characterize the coke deposited on the catalyst during propane dehydrogenation. Lin et al. [7] found two main TPO peaks at 450 and 500 The peaks were ascribed to coke on the metal and coke on the support,respectively. Larsson et al. [8] identified three different types of coke in propane dehydrogenation, their conclusions were also based on TPO experiments. The three types were coke on the support, coke on and in the vicinity of the metal and graphitic coke on the support. The amounts of these types of coke depended on the conditions, and Larsson et al. [8] proposed a model in which a minor part of the coke deactivated the catalyst.Dumez and Froment [9] studied the coke formation during dehydrogenation of 1-butene over Cr203 catalysts between 490 and 600  using a gravimetric microbalance. The kinetics of coking from 1-butene and from butadiene and the deactivation functions for the main and the coking reactions were developed. A main disadvantage of the conventional microbalance is that a large part of the feed bypasses the catalyst basket malting it difficult to confirm differential operation. However, in the oscillating microbalance the problems of bypass are avoided [10].The present study deals with the use of an oscillating microbalance reactor (TEOM) to study the dehydrogenation of propane. The TEOM gives a realistic representation of a fixed-bed reactor and is very well suited for studying coke formation, kinetics of the main reaction as well as for the coking reaction. Very few reports exist about the use of the new TEOM technique for studying supported metal catalyst. Liu et al. [11] studied the deactivation of bimetallic reforming catalysts and Rebo et al. [5] have report some preliminary experiments about dehydrogenation on supported Pt-Sn catalysts.
2. EXPERIlVIENTAL
The Pt-SrgAlO 3 catalyst was prepared by impregnation to incipient wetness of boehmite (a precursor ofy-A1203) with Sn as SnC12.2I-O followed by impregnation with Pt as ttzPtC1,.6IzhO,both as aqueous solutions as previously described [5]. A commercial Pt/A1203 reforming catalyst from Akzo Chemie (CK 303, Europt-3) was also studied for comparison. The metal content of the catalysts was measured by Atomic Absorption Spectroscopy (AAS). The H:Pt ratio was measured volumetrically by I chemisorption at 25  using Micromeritics ASAP
2010. Temperature programmed reduction (TPR) experiments were carried out on 0.5 g
catalyst samples using 7 % hydrogen in argon and a heating rate of 10 from ambient to 900  The catalysts were not dried prior to the TPR experiments.
The TEOM reactor was used to study the propane dehydrogenation including coke deposition on the catalysts at temperatures between 450 and 700 over a range of space velocities and propane and hydrogen partial pressures. In all experiments the total pressure was i bar, with He as the balance. Compared to the previous description [5,10], the TEOM has been modified and can now be operated up to 700  and 60 bar. The reactants were purified (molecular sieve 4/ AUtech oxytrap), metered, mixed and introduced by switching an air actuated four-port valve (VICI AC4 UWE) with low internal dead volume situated very close to the TEOM inlet. A ZnO trap ensured sulfiw free operation. Both continuous and interrupted (pulse) experiments were performed. The TEOM operation is controlled and monitored using LabVIEW software. Product analyses were taken every 16 minutes with a HP 5890 C 335 equipped with a GS-Q column (30 m, 0.543 mm) and a FI detector. A mass spectrometer (Vacuum Generators 300) is also attached to the reactor outlet for continuous detection of the response from the pulse experiments.
Prior to the dehydrogenation experiments the catalyst (7-30 mg) was heated in H 2 to 520 at 4 and kept at 520  for 4 h. The temperatm was then adjusted to the actual temperature and the experiments started when a stable mass signal was obtained.
Initial reaction rates r 0 were found by plotting the reaction rate r (mole propane/(g cat.h)) versus the coke content and extrapolating to zero coke content by using Eq. 1 or Eq. 2;depending on which equation gave the best fit to the experimental results. r - r o 9 e (-ace) (1) r=r (1 + a'.

3. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
The following values were obtained from the catalyst characterization by the standard techniques described above. Pt-Sn/A1203:0.59 wt% Pt, 0.83 wt% Sn, H:Pt = 0.30 (irr.) and S= 215 m2/g. Pt]AlO 3 (CK 303, Europt -3): 0.27 wt% Pt, H:Pt = 0.58 (irr.) and S--267 m2/g. For the CK 303 catalyst the AAS value for Pt is somewhat lower than given by Akzo. The nominal Pt and Sn loadings were also higher than those given by the AAS measurements. Similar 336 deviations from the nominal metal contents were also found by Bari et al. [6] and Lambert and Gonzalez [13] reported much higher nominal metal loadings than those measured by AAS and Inductively Coupled Plasma (ICP) analysis for Pt and Pt-Sn catalysts. Since boehmite was the starting material, the phase composition of the alumina was investigated using XRD analysis. The analysis confirmed that the wet calcination at 550  transferred the boehmite completely to 7-A1203.
The H:Pt ratio of the Pt-Sn/A1203 catalyst was found to be 0.30, a rather low value. The calcination conditions used in the preparation were chosen to reduce the chloride content of the catalyst, and involved wet calcination with a rather high partial pressure of water. This could lead to sintering of the metal partides and hence explain the low observed dispersion. 12 ........................................................................................................................ 10 8 2

Figure I shows the TPR-profiles for the two catalysts. On the commercial Pt/A1203 catalyst,two major reduction peaks are observed as expected [14] with maxima at 280  and at 495 respectively. The Pt-Sn catalyst shows a similar low-temperature reduction peak. The peak has a shoulder at about 380  but the 480  peak is not present. Instead a peak at a higher temperattwe is seen (680 as well as high temperature peaks (900  and above, not shown here). The low-temperature peak is broader, indicating a less distinct separation of the two reduction steps seen on CK 303. The high temperature peaks can be attributed to the support.A separate TPR experiment with the support gave some hydrogen consumption at about 700 probably linked with a phase-change of the support. It is also possible that Sn-species on the support can contribute to the high-temperature peaks, as observed e.g. by Bari et al. [6].From the results presented above we assume that Pt is fully reduced below 500 The chosen pre-treatment procedure for the kinetic experiments which also included a 4 h hydrogen treatment at 520  should be sufficient to reduce Pt to its metallic state. The oxidation state of Sn in dehydrogenation catalysts has been frequently discussed in literature [4,6,15], but will not be discussed in length in this context. A general view is that on alumina Sn is reduced mainly to Sn , but with a possibility of the formation of some zero-valent Sn that can form an alloy with Pt [6]. 337 Figure 2 compares the coke formation and the turnover frequencies (TOgs) for propane dehydrogenation at 540  for CK 303 and Pt-Sn/A120 , at SV = 39 and 41 h", respectively. The partial pressure of propane was 0.09 bar in both cases with He as the diluent. Coke formation was much more rapid on the Pt-Sn catalyst, and at the same time the catalytic activity was also higher. Since dehydrogenation is a facile reaction the initial TOFs would be expected to be similar for the two catalysts, as also observed previously [6]. Coke was initially formed very rapidly on CK 303, but the coking rate approached zero atter only a few minutes on stream,coinciding with a loss of activity.
Figure 3 illustrates similar experiments using the same two catalysts, again at 540 However, these experiments were carried out with hydrogen present in the feed at a partial pressure of 0.13 bar. The partial pressure of propane was 0.08 bar. The initial activities were lower, but the deactivation was much less severe, giving a higher TOF compared to the experiment without H 2 present after some time on stream. Still the Pt-Sn catalyst shows a slightly higher initial TOF compared to the CK 303, but the difference is now much smaller.
Taking into consideration the differences in the coking and deactivation over these two samples, the results indicate that the initial activity is quite similar, which is in line with the earlier findings [6].
The coking curves were rather similar for the two catalysts when hydrogen was present in the feed, and the coking rate was slightly higher for the CK 303 and lower for the Pt-Sn catalyst compared to the curves shown in Figure 2. The higher coking rate for CK 303 with hydrogen present in the feed is due to the much higher partial pressure of propene, since the activity is maintained at a higher level.
Figure 4 illustrates the coke formation versus time on stream at 500 and 520  on the Pt- Sn/A120. catalyst. Experimental data from the oscillating microbalance reactor and the model according to Eq. 4 are plotted together. Eq. 4 was found to describe the coke formation versus time on stream very well in both cases. Eq. 4 was also found to describe the experimental coking data very well across the whole range of temperatures investigated (450 to 580 independent of whether hydrogen was present or not and at different partial pressures of propane.It is not always straightforward to determine the initial activity in deactivating processes and in particular in this case with a rapid initial deactivation. However, the initial reaction period is very important for the resulting deactivation of the catalyst. In the figures presented above, the activity is plotted versus the time on stream. A plot of the activity versus the coke content as done in Figure 5 might be a more correct way to illustrate how the activity changes as the reaction proceeds. It is seen from Figure 5 that the manner in which the extrapolation to initial activity is done strongly effects the value of the initial activity. The models corresponding to Eqs. 1 and 2 are plotted together with the experimental data obtained at 520
Extrapolating the reaction rate (as TOF) against the coke content using Eq. 2 gave a value for TOF o of 8.9 s", and Eq. 1 gave TOF o of 7.4 s". By fitting TOF versus time on stream to an exponential model, TOF 0 was found to be 4.8 s". Eq.1 was chosen in this work based on F-tests,338

4. CONCLUSIONS
Propane dehydrogenation over a Pt-Sn/7-A1203 catalyst and a commercial Pt/A1203 catalyst (CK 303) has been studied in an oscillating microbalance reactor. The kinetics of coke formation and the deactivation functions for the coking and main reaction were determined.
An excellent agreement was found between the selected model and the observed coke formation between 450 and 580  independently of whether or not hydrogen was present in the feed.
