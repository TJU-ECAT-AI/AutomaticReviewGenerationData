Modeling of Coke Formation and Catalyst Deactivation in Propane Dehydrogenation Over a Commercial Pt-Sn/ -Al2O3 Catalyst
S. Niknaddaf,1 M. Soltani,2 A. Farjoo,1 and F. Khorasheh1
1Department of Chemical and Petroleum Engineering, Sharif University of Technology, Tehran, Iran 2National Iranian Petrochemical Company, Research and Technology Division, Tehran, Iran Propane dehydrogenation was carried over a commercial Pt-Sn/ -Al2O3 catalyst at atmospheric pressure and reaction temperatures of 580, 600, and 620C and WHSV of 11 h1 in an experimental tubular quartz reactor. Propane conversions were measured for catalyst time on stream of up to nine days. The amounts of coke deposited on the catalyst were measured after one, three, six, and nine days on stream using a thermogravimetric differential thermal analyzer (TG-DTA) for each reaction temperature. The coke formation kinetics was successfully described by a coke formation model based on a monolayer-multilayer mechanism. In addition, catalyst deactivation was presented by a time-dependant deactivation function. The kinetic order for monolayer coke formation was found to be two, which would support a coke formation step involving two active sites. The kinetic order for multilayer coke formation was found to be zero. The activation energy for monolayer coke formation was found to be 29.1 kJ/mol, which was lower than the activation energy of about 265.1 kJ/mol for multilayer coke formation indicating that the presence of metals can promote coke formation on the catalyst surface.

INTRODUCTION
The predicted annual extensive demand of propylene will increase by 5% (Corma et al., 2005) and is anticipated to reach 75 million tons per year in 2010 (Bhasin et al., 2001). The dehydrogenation of paraffins has a significant role in the production of monomers for synthetic rubber and synthesis of other organic products. The increasing availability of lower alkanes resulting from more strict environmental legislation has made dehydrogenation processes economically attractive (Resasco and Haller, 1994) and intensive work has been done to develop catalytic dehydrogenation processes for light alkanes, especially for propane and isobutene, on platinum-based catalysts (Assabum- rungrat et al., 2000; Herguido et al., 2005). Dehydrogenation reactions of lower alkanes are Address correspondence to F.

highly endothermic and because of thermodynamic constraints are carried out at high temperatures generally in the range of 530630C using chromium (Gascn et al., 2003), and more recently due to environmental considerations by platinum-based catalysts (Lobera et al., 2008). At these high temperatures carbonaceous deposits, collectively termed coke, are rapidly formed and as a consequence catalyst deactivation and regeneration are important considerations for commercial processes. Catalyst deactivation in propane dehydrogenation over alumina supported platinum catalysts has received considerable attention in the past few years (Baris et al., 1996; Larsson et al., 1996). Coke deposition may cause a decrease in catalytic activity by either site coverage or pore blockage, or both.
The aim of this work was to develop a kinetic rate expression to quantitatively describe the formation of coke deposits on a commercial Pt-Sn/ -Al2O3 catalyst in propane dehydrogenation as a function of time-on-stream and to develop a time-dependent relationship for catalyst deactivation.

METHODS AND MATERIALS
A laboratory scale reactor set up was used for the propane dehydrogenation (PDH) experiments.
A simplified schematic of the setup is shown in Figure 1. Using a three-lines setup, propane,hydrogen, and nitrogen gas mixtures could be introduced whose composition and total flow was set using Brooks mass flow controllers. The inside diameter of the reactor was 12 mm, the length of the reactor was 90 cm, and the catalyst was loaded in the middle section of the reactor in between two layers of quarts particles. The height of the catalyst zone was approximately 2 cm.
The specifications of the catalyst are given in Table 1.

The temperature was then held constant for 3 hours. The catalyst was then heated from 150C to the desired reduction temperature of 450C in 3 h under hydrogen flow.
During this period nitrogen flow was decreased gradually such that when the catalyst temperature reached 450C, the nitrogen flow was zero. The temperature was then increased from 450C to 530C in 16 min under hydrogen flow only. The temperature was then held constant for 1 h at 530C. The temperature was then reduced to 350C in 3 h under hydrogen flow at which point the flow of propane was started. The feed to the reactor consisted of propane and hydrogen with H2/propane molar ratio of 0.8. The temperature was then increased to the desired reaction temperatures of 580, 600, or 620C at a rate of 5C per minute. The reactor temperature was measured by three thermocouples externally attached to the top, middle, and bottom of the reactor,and one thermocouple located inside the reactor at the bottom of the catalyst bed. Product gases were analyzed after a 90-min stabilization period. The outlet stream from the reactor was analyzed by an online gas chromatograph (model PERICHROM 2100 Packed column, SS316, 6m, 1/8 in,28% DC200 on Chromsorb PAW 60/80, ENRO 3015) equipped with thermal conductivity and flame ionization detectors to calculate the propane conversions. Dehydrogenation of propane was carried out at a weight hourly spaced velocity (WHSV) of 11 h1. To determine the amount of coke deposited on the catalyst, propane dehydrogenation experiments at each reaction temperature were performed four times terminating the reaction after one, three, six, and nine days. For each catalyst sample, the amount of coke deposited on the catalyst was measured by thermal gravimetric/differential thermal analysis (TG/DTA) using a Dimond-Perkin Elmer apparatus with Chan Win DRB software.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS
To obtain proper kinetic data for determination of intrinsic coke formation kinetics, it was necessary to perform experiments in the absence of external and internal mass transfer limitations.
Experiments were conducted using catalyst particles of different sizes to investigate internal mass transfer limitations. Feed flow rates were also varied over a wide range keeping WHSV constant to investigate external mass transfer limitations under reaction conditions.
3.1.
External Mass Transfer Limitations In order to eliminate the external mass transfer limitations several experiments were conducted in which the size of the catalyst pellet was kept constant and the feed flow rate was varied over a wide range while keeping WHSV constant at 4 h1. If conversion was unaffected by varying the propane flow rate at constant WHSV, it could be concluded that the reaction was independent of the external mass transfer of the fluid outside the catalyst pellet. The results of these experiments are shown in Table 2 indicating that when propane flow rate, Qc3, was greater than 44.36 cc/min,there was no external mass transfer limitations.

Internal Mass Transfer Limitations In order to eliminate internal mass transfer limitations, several experiments were performed using different sizes of catalyst pellets at a feed flow rate where external mass transfer limitations were absent (QC3 > 55:45 cc/min). The results are presented in Table 3. If the conversion did not change by further reduction in the size of the catalyst pellet, there would be no internal mass transfer limitations. Subsequent experiments were performed using catalysts pellets of 0.35 mm in diameter.
3.3.
Coke Formation Figure 2 illustrates the amounts of coke (as % weight of catalyst) deposited on the catalyst surface versus time-on-stream for different reaction temperatures. The results clearly indicate an increase in coke formation with increasing reaction temperature in accordance with coking as an endothermic reaction and with positive activation energy. The coke content increased sharply with time-on-stream during an initial stage followed by a more moderate linear increase during the later stage of the reaction. The coke content for both the initial and final stages of the reaction increased with increasing temperature. These results suggest that in the initial stage the coke deposition itself inhibits further coke formation and after this stage, a nearly constant residual coking activity is attained in the later stage. Similar trends have been observed by Gascn et al.
(2003), Pea et al. (1993a, 1993b), and van Sint et al. (2001).

Propane Conversion Figure 3 shows the effect of reaction temperature on propane conversion. For each reaction temperature, a decrease in conversion was observed with time-on-stream. The increase in catalyst coke content and the decrease in propane conversion with time-on-stream suggest that coke

(color figure available online) accumulation on the catalyst surface and the resulting active site blockage is responsible for the decrease in propane conversion. Figure 3 also demonstrates that the initial propane conversion increases with increasing reaction temperature. The decrease in propane conversion with time- on-stream, however, is also more pronounced at higher reaction temperature at higher reaction temperatures as coke formation leading to a loss in catalyst activity is enhanced at higher temperatures. In other words, higher reaction temperatures result in both higher initial catalyst activity as well as faster loss of activity. These results are in good accordance with those reported by Lobera et al. (2008).

Effect of Time on Stream on Side Reaction Side Products Figure 4 illustrates the molar flow rates of reaction side products, namely, methane, ethylene, and ethane, at the reactor exit with time-on-stream. While the flow rates for methane and ethylene increased with time-on-stream, those for ethane decreased. This observation could be explained

2457 by the fact that hydrogenolysis of propane leading to the formation of ethane and methane, and hydrogenation of ethylene to ethane are side reactions that could take place on the platinum active sites (Zhang et al., 2006). The catalyst deactivation by active site blockage due to coke formation would lead to a decrease in the formation of ethane as a side product. The main cracking products (ethylene and methane), on the other hand, are mainly formed by cracking on the catalyst support and to some extent, by thermal cracking, that are unaffected by the deactivation of the catalyst.

Kinetic Modeling
3.6.1.
Coke Formation Model The kinetic model used to describe the coke formation on the catalyst surface was based on the monolayermultilayer coke growth model (MMCGM) that is a simple mechanistic model first proposed by Nam and Kittrell (1984), and generalized and used successfully by various investigators including Monzn et al. (1999), Pea et al. (1993a, 1993b), Rodrguez et al. (1997),and Romero et al. (1996). In this model, the rate of coke formation on the catalyst surface with time-on-stream is given by the sum of coke formation rates for monolayer coke which is formed on the surface of the catalyst and the simultaneous multilayer coke deposition rate:dCC dt D dCm dt C dCM dt (1) For the monolayer coke, the rate of coke deposition on the surface of catalyst is related to the fraction of sites on the first layer which are not covered by carbonaceous species:rCm D dCm dt D k1.Cmax  Cm/m (2) where Cm is the monolayer coke concentration, Cmax is the maximum coke concentration in monolayer, k1 is a kinetic coefficient, and m is the kinetic order pertinent to monolayer coke formation. The multilayer coke formation initiate as soon as the monolayer coke is available and is related to sites that are covered by monolayer coke:rCM D dCM dt D k2C n m (3) where CM is the multilayer coke concentration, k2 is a kinetic coefficient, and n is the kinetic order pertinent to coke formation in multilayer. It is assumed that kinetic constants k1 and k2 are functions of temperature only and an Arrhenius-type relation is used for both monolayer .i D 1/ and multilayer coke .i D 2/ formation:ki D koi exp

The integrated form of the model equations are presented in Table 4 for three different sets of values for m and n.

3.6.2.
Time-dependent Deactivation Model A reduction in catalyst activity with time-on-stream is expected as coke formation leads to the coverage of active sites on the surface of catalyst by carbonaceous species. Experimental data indicate a gradual decrease in catalyst activity up to and beyond the initial stage of coke deposition. A time-dependent deactivation model (Romero et al., 1996) was used to describe the loss in catalyst activity with time-on-stream. The model contains an exponential relationship between catalyst activity, a, and catalyst coke content, CC, as well as a time-dependent relationship for catalyst coke content as follows:a D exp.BCC/ (6) CC D Atp (7) where A, B, and p are adjustable model parameters.

CONCLUSIONS
Extensive experiments on propane dehydrogenation reaction were performed to investigate the catalyst deactivation by coking. A monolayer-multilayer coke deposition model was proposed to describe the kinetics of coke formation on a commercial Pt-Sn/ -Al2O3 catalyst. The activation energies for monolayer and multilayer coke formation were found to be 29.1 and 265.1 kJ/mol,respectively, indicating that the presence of metals could promote coke formation on the catalyst surface during propane dehydrogenation. A time-dependent deactivation model was also developed to describe the loss of catalyst activity as function of time-on-stream and reaction temperatures.
Predicted values of coke deposition and catalyst activity from the two models were in good agreement with experimental data.
