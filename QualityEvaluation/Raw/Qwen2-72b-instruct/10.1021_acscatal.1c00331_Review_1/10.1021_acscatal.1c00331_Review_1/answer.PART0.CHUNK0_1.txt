1.The exact composition of coke is not well resolved due to the complex process of coke formation. Most studies generally attribute coke to the deposition of undesirable organic compounds. A recent study using gas chromatography combined with mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and thermogravimetric (TG) analysis has identified the detailed components of coke under propane dehydrogenation (PDH) on PtSn catalysts, suggesting that coke mainly consists of three types of species: aliphatics, aromatics, and pregraphite. The species of coke deposition can vary on different catalysts, such as atomic carbon or aromatics on Pt/Al2O3 and C3 species on PtSn/Al2O3 catalysts. The composition of cokes varies with reaction conditions and catalytic systems, without a universal definition.

1.由于焦炭形成过程的复杂性，焦炭的确切成分尚未得到很好的解析。大多数研究通常将焦炭归因于不希望的有机化合物的沉积。最近一项使用气相色谱结合质谱（GC-MS）和热重（TG）分析的研究确定了在PtSn催化剂下PDH过程中焦炭的详细成分，表明焦炭主要由三种类型的物种组成：脂肪族化合物、芳香族化合物和预石墨。在不同的催化剂上，焦炭沉积的物种可以变化，例如在Pt/Al2O3上为原子碳或芳香族化合物，在PtSn/Al2O3催化剂上为C3物种。焦炭的组成随反应条件和催化系统的不同而变化，没有一个普遍的定义。
