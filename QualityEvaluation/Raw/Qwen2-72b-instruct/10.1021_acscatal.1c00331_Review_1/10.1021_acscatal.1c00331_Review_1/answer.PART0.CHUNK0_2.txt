[1] "The exact constituents of coke are not well resolved because of the complex process of the coke formation. Most studies broadly attributed coke as the deposition of undesirable organic compounds."
[2] "A recent study with gas chromatography combined with mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and thermogravimetric (TG) analysis pin down the detailed components of coke under PDH on PtSn catalysts. It was suggested that the coke mainly consists of three kind of species: aliphatics, aromatics, and pregraphite."
[3] "The species could be atomic carbon or aromatics on Pt/Al2O3 and C3 species on PtSn/Al2O3 catalyst, respectively."
[4] "Overall, the composition of cokes varies with reaction condition and catalytic system without a universal definition."

1.The exact composition of coke is not well understood due to the complexity of its formation process. Most studies generally consider coke to be the deposition of undesirable organic compounds. A recent study using gas chromatography combined with mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and thermogravimetric (TG) analysis has identified the detailed components of coke under propane dehydrogenation (PDH) on PtSn catalysts, suggesting that coke mainly consists of three types of species: aliphatics, aromatics, and pregraphite. The species of coke deposition can vary on different catalysts, such as atomic carbon or aromatics on Pt/Al2O3 and C3 species on PtSn/Al2O3 catalysts. The composition of cokes varies with reaction conditions and catalytic systems, without a universal definition.

1.由于焦炭形成过程的复杂性，焦炭的确切组成尚未得到很好的解决。大多数研究普遍将焦炭归因于不希望的有机化合物的沉积。最近一项结合气相色谱-质谱（GC-MS）和热重（TG）分析的研究确定了在PtSn催化剂下PDH过程中焦炭的详细成分，表明焦炭主要由三种类型的物种组成：脂肪族化合物、芳香族化合物和预石墨。在不同的催化剂上，焦炭沉积的物种可能会有所不同，例如在Pt/Al2O3上可能是原子碳或芳香族化合物，在PtSn/Al2O3催化剂上可能是C3物种。焦炭的组成随反应条件和催化系统的不同而变化，没有一个普遍的定义。
