Coke deposition in catalytic systems, particularly in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions, is a complex phenomenon influenced by a variety of factors including reaction conditions, catalyst types, and analytical techniques. The composition of coke deposits can vary widely, consisting of a mixture of carbonaceous materials with different structures and functionalities. Variability in coke composition can significantly impact the performance and longevity of catalysts in PDH processes. Reaction conditions, such as temperature, pressure, and reactant feed rates, play a crucial role in determining the nature and extent of coke formation. Catalyst types, including their chemical composition and physical properties, also significantly influence coke deposition patterns. Analytical techniques, such as temperature-programmed desorption, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and scanning electron microscopy, are essential for characterizing the complex nature of coke deposits. Understanding these factors and their interplay is critical for developing strategies to mitigate coke formation and enhance the efficiency and selectivity of PDH reactions.
