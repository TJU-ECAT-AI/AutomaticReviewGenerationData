                    The exact composition of coke deposits in catalytic systems, particularly in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions, is a complex and multifaceted topic that has been elucidated through various analytical techniques and experimental conditions \[10.1021/acscatal.1c00331_1\]. Studies have identified that coke mainly consists of three types of species: aliphatics, aromatics, and pregraphite, with the species of coke deposition varying on different catalysts, such as atomic carbon or aromatics on Pt/Al2O3 and C3 species on PtSn/Al2O3 catalysts \[10.1021/acscatal.1c00331_1\]. The composition of cokes varies with reaction conditions and catalytic systems, without a universal definition \[10.1021/acscatal.1c00331_1\]. Operando Raman spectroscopy has been used to study the nature of coke deposits in catalytic systems, particularly in PDH reactions, revealing that hydrogen alters the nature of the coke deposits, resulting in a more ordered system with fewer defects, smaller graphitic crystallites, and an increased D1/G ratio \[10.1039/c3cp50646k\]. The amount of amorphous coke decreases with increasing hydrogen content, and catalyst cycling affects the Raman band positions, widths, and D1/G ratio in some experiments, with a correlation between the type of coke formed and selectivity \[10.1039/c3cp50646k\]. The increase in propane dehydrogenation conversion with increasing hydrogen concentration is related to decreased coke deposition \[10.1039/c3cp50646k\]. Experiments with lower propane concentrations show a strong increase in selectivity, with less coke of a more graphitic nature detected, suggesting a link between disordered coke deposits and side reactions like cracking \[10.1039/c3cp50646k\]. TGA experiments confirm that less coke is formed in the presence of hydrogen, and that this coke combusts at higher temperatures, consistent with a more graphitic nature \[10.1039/c3cp50646k\]. During propene hydrogenation, larger quantities of coke are formed, combusting at lower temperatures due to the presence of disordered carbon \[10.1039/c3cp50646k\]. In the presence of high hydrogen concentrations, more graphitic coke is formed, covering the catalyst support and keeping the surface of the Pt free of disordered coke species \[10.1039/c3cp50646k\]. Three types of coke have been identified in PDH reactions: coke on and in the vicinity of the metal, coke on the carrier, and graphitic coke on the carrier \[10.1006/jcat.1996.0361\]. The formation of the first two types of coke increases with temperature and partial pressure of propene, while hydrogen suppresses their formation \[10.1006/jcat.1996.0361\]. The amount of graphitic coke increases with temperature and propane partial pressure \[10.1006/jcat.1996.0361\]. A model suggests that only a minor part of the coke deactivates the catalyst, and this deactivating coke is formed in parallel with the other coke types \[10.1006/jcat.1996.0361\]. The graphitic coke on the carrier is formed through a separate mechanism \[10.1006/jcat.1996.0361\]. Experiments with different times on stream showed that the first type of coke reached a constant level after about 15 hours, while the second type continued to increase \[10.1006/jcat.1996.0361\]. Hydrogen was effective in preventing coke formation and deactivation but could not remove coke that had already formed on the catalyst \[10.1006/jcat.1996.0361\]. The mechanisms of hydrogenolysis and cracking during propane dehydrogenation were also discussed \[10.1006/jcat.1996.0361\]. Analytical techniques such as thermal gravimetric analysis, IR spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy, and elemental analysis have been employed to elucidate the complex nature and diversity of coke constituents in these systems \[10.1007/s11244-011-9708-8\]. The coke formed on the metal is softer (containing more hydrogen) than that formed on the support, with the rate of coke formation on the metal weakly dependent on the propylene and hydrogen pressures but increasing concurrently with the propane pressure \[10.1007/s11244-011-9708-8\]. The rate of coke formation on the support increases concurrently with the propane and propylene pressures and decreases with the hydrogen pressure \[10.1007/s11244-011-9708-8\]. The coke formed on the metal has aliphatic hydrocarbon characteristic, containing more hydrogen than that formed on the support, while the coke formed on the support has an aromatic characteristic \[10.1007/s11244-011-9708-8\].

                    丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应中催化系统中焦炭沉积物的确切组成是一个复杂且多维的话题，通过各种分析技术和实验条件得到了阐明\[10.1021/acscatal.1c00331_1\]。研究已确定焦炭主要由三种类型的物种组成：脂肪族、芳香族和预石墨，焦炭沉积物的种类在不同的催化剂上有所不同，例如Pt/Al2O3上的原子碳或芳香族和PtSn/Al2O3催化剂上的C3物种\[10.1021/acscatal.1c00331_1\]。焦炭的组成随反应条件和催化系统的不同而变化，没有一个普遍的定义\[10.1021/acscatal.1c00331_1\]。原位拉曼光谱已被用于研究催化系统中，特别是在PDH反应中焦炭沉积物的性质，揭示了氢气会改变焦炭沉积物的性质，导致一个更有序的系统，具有更少的缺陷，更小的石墨结晶体和增加的D1/G比\[10.1039/c3cp50646k\]。随着氢含量的增加，无定形焦炭的数量减少，催化剂循环影响某些实验中的拉曼带位置、宽度和D1/G比，焦炭的类型与选择性之间存在相关性\[10.1039/c3cp50646k\]。随着氢浓度的增加，丙烷脱氢转化率的增加与焦炭沉积的减少有关\[10.1039/c3cp50646k\]。在较低的丙烷浓度下进行的实验显示出选择性的显著增加，检测到较少的更石墨性质的焦炭，这表明无序焦炭沉积物与裂解等副反应之间存在联系\[10.1039/c3cp50646k\]。TGA实验确认，在氢气存在下形成的焦炭较少，且这种焦炭在更高的温度下燃烧，与更石墨性质一致\[10.1039/c3cp50646k\]。在丙烯氢化过程中，形成更多的焦炭，由于无序碳的存在，这些焦炭在较低的温度下燃烧\[10.1039/c3cp50646k\]。在高氢浓度下，形成更多的石墨焦炭，覆盖催化剂载体，使Pt表面免受无序焦炭物种的影响\[10.1039/c3cp50646k\]。在PDH反应中已识别出三种类型的焦炭：金属附近和金属上的焦炭、载体上的焦炭和载体上的石墨焦炭\[10.1006/jcat.1996.0361\]。前两种焦炭的形成随温度和丙烯分压的增加而增加，而氢气抑制了它们的形成\[10.1006/jcat.1996.0361\]。石墨焦炭的数量随温度和丙烷分压的增加而增加\[10.1006/jcat.1996.0361\]。一个模型表明，只有少量的焦炭会失活催化剂，这种失活焦炭与其它焦炭类型并行形成\[10.1006/jcat.1996.0361\]。载体上的石墨焦炭是通过一个独立的机制形成的\[10.1006/jcat.1996.0361\]。不同时间在线的实验表明，第一种类型的焦炭在大约15小时后达到恒定水平，而第二种类型则继续增加\[10.1006/jcat.1996.0361\]。氢气在防止焦炭形成和失活方面是有效的，但不能去除已经形成在催化剂上的焦炭\[10.1006/jcat.1996.0361\]。丙烷脱氢期间的氢解和裂解机制也被讨论\[10.1006/jcat.1996.0361\]。热重分析、红外光谱、拉曼光谱和元素分析等分析技术已被用于阐明这些系统中焦炭成分的复杂性和多样性\[10.1007/s11244-011-9708-8\]。金属上的焦炭比在载体上形成的焦炭更软（含有更多的氢），金属上的焦炭形成速率弱依赖于丙烯和氢气的压力，但与丙烷压力同时增加\[10.1007/s11244-011-9708-8\]。载体上的焦炭形成速率与丙烷和丙烯的压力同时增加，而与氢气压力的增加相反\[10.1007/s11244-011-9708-8\]。金属上的焦炭具有脂肪族烃的特性，含有的氢比在载体上形成的焦炭多，而载体上的焦炭具有芳香族的特性\[10.1007/s11244-011-9708-8\]。
