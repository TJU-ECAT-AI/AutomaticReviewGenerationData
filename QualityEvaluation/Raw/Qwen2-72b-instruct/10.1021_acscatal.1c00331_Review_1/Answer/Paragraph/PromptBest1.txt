The intricate nature of coke deposits in catalytic systems, particularly in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions, has been elucidated through a plethora of studies, revealing the variability in coke composition across different reaction conditions and catalyst types \[10.1021/acscatal.1c00331_1\]. GC-MS and TG analysis have identified coke as primarily comprising aliphatics, aromatics, and pregraphite, with the specific species of coke deposition varying on different catalysts, such as atomic carbon or aromatics on Pt/Al2O3 and C3 species on PtSn/Al2O3 catalysts \[10.1021/acscatal.1c00331_1\]. Operando Raman spectroscopy has further illuminated the nature of coke deposits, demonstrating that hydrogen alters the nature of the coke, resulting in a more ordered system with fewer defects, smaller graphitic crystallites, and an increased D1/G ratio \[10.1039/c3cp50646k\]. The amount of amorphous coke decreases with increasing hydrogen content, and experiments with lower propane concentrations show a strong increase in selectivity, with less coke of a more graphitic nature detected, suggesting a link between disordered coke deposits and side reactions like cracking \[10.1039/c3cp50646k\]. TGA experiments confirm that less coke is formed in the presence of hydrogen, and that this coke combusts at higher temperatures, consistent with a more graphitic nature \[10.1039/c3cp50646k\]. Three types of coke have been identified: coke on and in the vicinity of the metal, coke on the carrier, and graphitic coke on the carrier \[10.1006/jcat.1996.0361\]. The formation of the first two types of coke increases with temperature and partial pressure of propene, while hydrogen suppresses their formation. The amount of graphitic coke increases with temperature and propane partial pressure \[10.1006/jcat.1996.0361\]. A model suggests that only a minor part of the coke deactivates the catalyst, and this deactivating coke is formed in parallel with the other coke types \[10.1006/jcat.1996.0361\]. The graphitic coke on the carrier is formed through a separate mechanism \[10.1006/jcat.1996.0361\].

The exact composition of coke deposits in catalytic systems, particularly in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions, is a complex and multifaceted topic that has been extensively studied \[10.1021/acscatal.1c00331_1\]. Recent investigations using gas chromatography combined with mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and thermogravimetric (TG) analysis have revealed that coke mainly consists of three types of species: aliphatics, aromatics, and pregraphite \[10.1021/acscatal.1c00331_1\]. The species of coke deposition can vary on different catalysts, such as atomic carbon or aromatics on Pt/Al2O3 and C3 species on PtSn/Al2O3 catalysts \[10.1021/acscatal.1c00331_1\]. The composition of cokes varies with reaction conditions and catalytic systems, without a universal definition \[10.1021/acscatal.1c00331_1\]. Operando Raman spectroscopy has been used to study the nature of coke deposits in catalytic systems, particularly in PDH reactions \[10.1039/c3cp50646k\]. Hydrogen was found to alter the nature of the coke deposits, resulting in a more ordered system with fewer defects, smaller graphitic crystallites, and an increased D1/G ratio \[10.1039/c3cp50646k\]. The amount of amorphous coke decreases with increasing hydrogen content \[10.1039/c3cp50646k\]. Catalyst cycling affects the Raman band positions, widths, and D1/G ratio in some experiments, with a correlation between the type of coke formed and selectivity \[10.1039/c3cp50646k\]. The increase in PDH conversion with increasing hydrogen concentration is related to decreased coke deposition \[10.1039/c3cp50646k\]. Experiments with lower propane concentrations show a strong increase in selectivity, with less coke of a more graphitic nature detected, suggesting a link between disordered coke deposits and side reactions like cracking \[10.1039/c3cp50646k\]. TGA experiments confirm that less coke is formed in the presence of hydrogen, and that this coke combusts at higher temperatures, consistent with a more graphitic nature \[10.1039/c3cp50646k\]. During propene hydrogenation, larger quantities of coke are formed, combusting at lower temperatures due to the presence of disordered carbon \[10.1039/c3cp50646k\]. In the presence of high hydrogen concentrations, more graphitic coke is formed, covering the catalyst support and keeping the surface of the Pt free of disordered coke species \[10.1039/c3cp50646k\]. Three types of coke have been identified: coke on and in the vicinity of the metal, coke on the carrier, and graphitic coke on the carrier \[10.1006/jcat.1996.0361\].

Experiments with different times on stream showed that the first type of coke reached a constant level after about 15 hours, while the second type continued to increase \[10.1006/jcat.1996.0361\]. Hydrogen was effective in preventing coke formation and deactivation but could not remove coke that had already formed on the catalyst \[10.1006/jcat.1996.0361\]. The mechanisms of hydrogenolysis and cracking during propane dehydrogenation were also discussed \[10.1006/jcat.1996.0361\].

The rate of coke formation on the support increases with propane and propylene pressures and decreases with hydrogen pressure \[10.1007/s11244-011-9708-8\]. Analytical techniques such as thermal gravimetric analysis, IR spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy, and elemental analysis have been employed to elucidate the complex nature and diversity of coke constituents in these systems \[10.1007/s11244-011-9708-8\].

The exact composition of coke deposits in catalytic systems, particularly in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions, remains elusive due to the complex nature of coke formation \[10.1021/acscatal.1c00331_1\]. Recent studies using gas chromatography combined with mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and thermogravimetric (TG) analysis have identified the detailed components of coke under PDH on PtSn catalysts, revealing that coke primarily consists of aliphatics, aromatics, and pregraphite \[10.1021/acscatal.1c00331_1\]. The species of coke deposition can vary on different catalysts, such as atomic carbon or aromatics on Pt/Al2O3 and C3 species on PtSn/Al2O3 catalysts \[10.1021/acscatal.1c00331_1\]. Operando Raman spectroscopy has been employed to study the nature of coke deposits in PDH reactions, showing that hydrogen alters the nature of the coke deposits, resulting in a more ordered system with fewer defects, smaller graphitic crystallites, and an increased D1/G ratio \[10.1039/c3cp50646k\]. The amount of amorphous coke decreases with increasing hydrogen content, and hydrogen is effective in preventing coke formation and deactivation \[10.1039/c3cp50646k\]. Three types of coke have been identified: coke on and in the vicinity of the metal, coke on the carrier, and graphitic coke on the carrier \[10.1006/jcat.1996.0361\]. The formation of the first two types of coke increases with temperature and partial pressure of propene, while hydrogen suppresses their formation. The amount of graphitic coke increases with temperature and propane partial pressure \[10.1006/jcat.1996.0361\]. Temperature programmed oxidation (TPO) has been used to characterize the coke deposited on the catalyst during PDH, identifying different types of coke such as coke on the metal, coke on the support, and graphitic coke on the support \[10.1016/s0167-2991(99)80483-2\]. The rate of coke formation on the metal is weakly dependent on the propylene and hydrogen pressures but increases concurrently with the propane pressure. The rate of coke formation on the support increases concurrently with the propane and propylene pressures and decreases with the hydrogen pressure \[10.1007/s11244-011-9708-8\].

                Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: The complexity of coke formation in PDH reactions necessitates the development of advanced analytical techniques and modeling approaches to better understand the composition and variability of coke deposits. Future research should focus on the integration of in situ and operando spectroscopic methods with advanced computational simulations to elucidate the detailed mechanisms of coke formation and its impact on catalyst deactivation. The exploration of novel catalyst designs and reaction conditions that minimize coke formation while maximizing selectivity and activity is also a promising direction. The use of machine learning algorithms to predict coke formation based on catalyst composition and reaction conditions could further enhance our understanding and control of PDH processes.

The exact composition of coke deposits in catalytic systems, particularly in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions, is a complex and multifaceted topic that has been elucidated through various analytical techniques and experimental conditions \[10.1021/acscatal.1c00331_1\]. Studies have identified that coke mainly consists of three types of species: aliphatics, aromatics, and pregraphite, with the species of coke deposition varying on different catalysts, such as atomic carbon or aromatics on Pt/Al2O3 and C3 species on PtSn/Al2O3 catalysts \[10.1021/acscatal.1c00331_1\]. The composition of cokes varies with reaction conditions and catalytic systems, without a universal definition \[10.1021/acscatal.1c00331_1\]. Operando Raman spectroscopy has been used to study the nature of coke deposits in catalytic systems, particularly in PDH reactions, revealing that hydrogen alters the nature of the coke deposits, resulting in a more ordered system with fewer defects, smaller graphitic crystallites, and an increased D1/G ratio \[10.1039/c3cp50646k\]. The amount of amorphous coke decreases with increasing hydrogen content, and catalyst cycling affects the Raman band positions, widths, and D1/G ratio in some experiments, with a correlation between the type of coke formed and selectivity \[10.1039/c3cp50646k\]. The increase in propane dehydrogenation conversion with increasing hydrogen concentration is related to decreased coke deposition \[10.1039/c3cp50646k\]. Experiments with lower propane concentrations show a strong increase in selectivity, with less coke of a more graphitic nature detected, suggesting a link between disordered coke deposits and side reactions like cracking \[10.1039/c3cp50646k\]. TGA experiments confirm that less coke is formed in the presence of hydrogen, and that this coke combusts at higher temperatures, consistent with a more graphitic nature \[10.1039/c3cp50646k\]. During propene hydrogenation, larger quantities of coke are formed, combusting at lower temperatures due to the presence of disordered carbon \[10.1039/c3cp50646k\]. In the presence of high hydrogen concentrations, more graphitic coke is formed, covering the catalyst support and keeping the surface of the Pt free of disordered coke species \[10.1039/c3cp50646k\]. Three types of coke have been identified in PDH reactions: coke on and in the vicinity of the metal, coke on the carrier, and graphitic coke on the carrier \[10.1006/jcat.1996.0361\]. The formation of the first two types of coke increases with temperature and partial pressure of propene, while hydrogen suppresses their formation \[10.1006/jcat.1996.0361\]. The amount of graphitic coke increases with temperature and propane partial pressure \[10.1006/jcat.1996.0361\]. A model suggests that only a minor part of the coke deactivates the catalyst, and this deactivating coke is formed in parallel with the other coke types \[10.1006/jcat.1996.0361\]. The graphitic coke on the carrier is formed through a separate mechanism \[10.1006/jcat.1996.0361\]. Experiments with different times on stream showed that the first type of coke reached a constant level after about 15 hours, while the second type continued to increase \[10.1006/jcat.1996.0361\]. Hydrogen was effective in preventing coke formation and deactivation but could not remove coke that had already formed on the catalyst \[10.1006/jcat.1996.0361\]. The mechanisms of hydrogenolysis and cracking during propane dehydrogenation were also discussed \[10.1006/jcat.1996.0361\]. Analytical techniques such as thermal gravimetric analysis, IR spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy, and elemental analysis have been employed to elucidate the complex nature and diversity of coke constituents in these systems \[10.1007/s11244-011-9708-8\]. The coke formed on the metal is softer (containing more hydrogen) than that formed on the support, with the rate of coke formation on the metal weakly dependent on the propylene and hydrogen pressures but increasing concurrently with the propane pressure \[10.1007/s11244-011-9708-8\]. The rate of coke formation on the support increases concurrently with the propane and propylene pressures and decreases with the hydrogen pressure \[10.1007/s11244-011-9708-8\]. The coke formed on the metal has aliphatic hydrocarbon characteristic, containing more hydrogen than that formed on the support, while the coke formed on the support has an aromatic characteristic \[10.1007/s11244-011-9708-8\].
