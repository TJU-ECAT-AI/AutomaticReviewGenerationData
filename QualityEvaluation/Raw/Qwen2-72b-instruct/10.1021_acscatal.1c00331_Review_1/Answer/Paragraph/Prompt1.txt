{"DOC": "The exact composition of coke is not well understood due to the complex process of coke formation. Most studies generally attribute coke to the deposition of undesirable organic compounds. A recent study using gas chromatography combined with mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and thermogravimetric (TG) analysis has identified the detailed components of coke under propane dehydrogenation (PDH) on PtSn catalysts, suggesting that coke mainly consists of three types of species: aliphatics, aromatics, and pregraphite. The species of coke deposition can vary on different catalysts, such as atomic carbon or aromatics on Pt/Al2O3 and C3 species on PtSn/Al2O3 catalysts. The composition of cokes varies with reaction conditions and catalytic systems, without a universal definition.", "Doi": "10.1021/acscatal.1c00331_1"},
{"DOC": "Operando Raman spectroscopy has been used to study the nature of coke deposits in catalytic systems, particularly in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. Hydrogen was found to alter the nature of the coke deposits, resulting in a more ordered system with fewer defects, smaller graphitic crystallites, and an increased D1/G ratio. The amount of amorphous coke decreases with increasing hydrogen content. Catalyst cycling affects the Raman band positions, widths, and D1/G ratio in some experiments, with a correlation between the type of coke formed and selectivity. The increase in propane dehydrogenation conversion with increasing hydrogen concentration is related to decreased coke deposition. Experiments with lower propane concentrations show a strong increase in selectivity, with less coke of a more graphitic nature detected, suggesting a link between disordered coke deposits and side reactions like cracking. TGA experiments confirm that less coke is formed in the presence of hydrogen, and that this coke combusts at higher temperatures, consistent with a more graphitic nature. During propene hydrogenation, larger quantities of coke are formed, combusting at lower temperatures due to the presence of disordered carbon. In the presence of high hydrogen concentrations, more graphitic coke is formed, covering the catalyst support and keeping the surface of the Pt free of disordered coke species.", "Doi": "10.1039/c3cp50646k"},
{"DOC": "The composition of coke deposits in catalytic systems, particularly in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions, varies across different reaction conditions and catalyst types. Three types of coke have been identified: coke on and in the vicinity of the metal, coke on the carrier, and graphitic coke on the carrier. The formation of the first two types of coke increases with temperature and partial pressure of propene, while hydrogen suppresses their formation. The amount of graphitic coke increases with temperature and propane partial pressure. A model suggests that only a minor part of the coke deactivates the catalyst, and this deactivating coke is formed in parallel with the other coke types. The graphitic coke on the carrier is formed through a separate mechanism. Experiments with different times on stream showed that the first type of coke reached a constant level after about 15 hours, while the second type continued to increase. Hydrogen was effective in preventing coke formation and deactivation but could not remove coke that had already formed on the catalyst. The mechanisms of hydrogenolysis and cracking during propane dehydrogenation were also discussed.", "Doi": "10.1006/jcat.1996.0361"},
{"DOC": "The literature does not provide specific information on the composition of coke deposits in catalytic systems or the analytical techniques used to elucidate the nature of coke constituents in propane dehydrogenation reactions. However, it does mention that temperature programmed oxidation (TPO) has been used to characterize the coke deposited on the catalyst during propane dehydrogenation, identifying different types of coke such as coke on the metal, coke on the support, and graphitic coke on the support. The amounts of these types of coke depend on the conditions, and a model has been proposed in which a minor part of the coke deactivates the catalyst. The document focuses on the study of propane dehydrogenation over alumina-supported Pt-Sn catalysts, determining the kinetics of coke formation and the deactivation functions for the coking and dehydrogenation reactions. It mentions the use of an oscillating microbalance reactor (TEOM) to study the dehydrogenation of propane, which gives a realistic representation of a fixed-bed reactor and is well suited for studying coke formation and the kinetics of the main and coking reactions.", "Doi": "10.1016/s0167-2991(99)80483-2"},

{"DOC": "The composition of coke deposits in catalytic systems, particularly in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions, varies across different reaction conditions and catalyst types. The coke formed on the metal is softer (containing more hydrogen) than that formed on the support. The rate of coke formation on the metal is weakly dependent on the propylene and hydrogen pressures but increases concurrently with the propane pressure. The rate of coke formation on the support increases concurrently with the propane and propylene pressures and decreases with the hydrogen pressure. The coke formed on the metal has aliphatic hydrocarbon characteristic, containing more hydrogen than that formed on the support. The coke formed on the support has an aromatic characteristic. Analytical techniques such as thermal gravimetric analysis, IR spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy, and elemental analysis have been employed to elucidate the complex nature and diversity of coke constituents in these systems.", "Doi": "10.1007/s11244-011-9708-8"},
{"DOC": "The exact composition of coke is not well understood due to the complex process of coke formation. Most studies generally attribute coke to the deposition of undesirable organic compounds. A recent study using gas chromatography combined with mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and thermogravimetric (TG) analysis has identified the detailed components of coke under propane dehydrogenation (PDH) on PtSn catalysts, suggesting that coke mainly consists of three types of species: aliphatics, aromatics, and pregraphite.

{"DOC": "Operando Raman spectroscopy has been used to study the nature of coke deposits in catalytic systems, particularly in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. Hydrogen was found to alter the nature of the coke deposits, resulting in a more ordered system with fewer defects, smaller graphitic crystallites, and an increased D1/G ratio. The amount of amorphous coke decreases with increasing hydrogen content. Catalyst cycling affects the Raman band positions, widths, and D1/G ratio in some experiments, with a correlation between the type of coke formed and selectivity. The increase in propane dehydrogenation conversion with increasing hydrogen concentration is related to decreased coke deposition. Experiments with lower propane concentrations show a strong increase in selectivity, with less coke of a more graphitic nature detected, suggesting a link between disordered coke deposits and side reactions like cracking. TGA experiments confirm that less coke is formed in the presence of hydrogen, and that this coke combusts at higher temperatures, consistent with a more graphitic nature. During propene hydrogenation, larger quantities of coke are formed, combusting at lower temperatures due to the presence of disordered carbon. In the presence of high hydrogen concentrations, more graphitic coke is formed, covering the catalyst support and keeping the surface of the Pt free of disordered coke species.", "Doi": "10.1039/c3cp50646k"},
{"DOC": "The composition of coke deposits in catalytic systems, particularly in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions, varies across different reaction conditions and catalyst types. Three types of coke have been identified: coke on and in the vicinity of the metal, coke on the carrier, and graphitic coke on the carrier. The formation of the first two types of coke increases with temperature and partial pressure of propene, while hydrogen suppresses their formation. The amount of graphitic coke increases with temperature and propane partial pressure. A model suggests that only a minor part of the coke deactivates the catalyst, and this deactivating coke is formed in parallel with the other coke types. The graphitic coke on the carrier is formed through a separate mechanism. Experiments with different times on stream showed that the first type of coke reached a constant level after about 15 hours, while the second type continued to increase.
