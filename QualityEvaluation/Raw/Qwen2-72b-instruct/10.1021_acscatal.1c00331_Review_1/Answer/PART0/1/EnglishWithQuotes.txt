Hydrogen was found to alter the nature of the coke deposits, resulting in a more ordered system with fewer defects, smaller graphitic crystallites, and an increased D1/G ratio. The amount of amorphous coke decreases with increasing hydrogen content. Catalyst cycling affects the Raman band positions, widths, and D1/G ratio in some experiments, with a correlation between the type of coke formed and selectivity. The increase in propane dehydrogenation conversion with increasing hydrogen concentration is related to decreased coke deposition. Experiments with lower propane concentrations show a strong increase in selectivity, with less coke of a more graphitic nature detected, suggesting a link between disordered coke deposits and side reactions like cracking. TGA experiments confirm that less coke is formed in the presence of hydrogen, and that this coke combusts at higher temperatures, consistent with a more graphitic nature. During propene hydrogenation, larger quantities of coke are formed, combusting at lower temperatures due to the presence of disordered carbon. In the presence of high hydrogen concentrations, more graphitic coke is formed, covering the catalyst support and keeping the surface of the Pt free of disordered coke species.", "Doi": "10.1039/c3cp50646k"},
