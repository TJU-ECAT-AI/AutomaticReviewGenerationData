The amounts of these types of coke depend on the conditions, and a model has been proposed in which a minor part of the coke deactivates the catalyst. The document focuses on the study of propane dehydrogenation over alumina-supported Pt-Sn catalysts, determining the kinetics of coke formation and the deactivation functions for the coking and dehydrogenation reactions. It mentions the use of an oscillating microbalance reactor (TEOM) to study the dehydrogenation of propane, which gives a realistic representation of a fixed-bed reactor and is well suited for studying coke formation and the kinetics of the main and coking reactions.", "Chinese": "文献没有提供关于催化系统中焦炭沉积物的组成或用于阐明丙烷脱氢反应中焦炭成分性质的分析技术的具体信息。但是，它确实提到温度程序氧化（TPO）已被用于表征在丙烷脱氢过程中沉积在催化剂上的焦炭，识别不同类型的焦炭，如金属上的焦炭、支撑物上的焦炭和支撑物上的石墨焦炭。这些类型的焦炭的数量取决于条件，已经提出了一个模型，其中一小部分焦炭使催化剂失活。该文件专注于研究在氧化铝支持的Pt-Sn催化剂上丙烷脱氢，确定焦炭形成和脱氢反应的失活函数的反应动力学。它提到了使用振荡微平衡反应器（TEOM）来研究丙烷的脱氢，这给出了固定床反应器的真实表示，并且非常适合研究焦炭形成和主要反应和焦炭反应的动力学。", "Doi": "10.1016/s0167-2991(99)80483-2"},

The coke formed on the metal is softer (containing more hydrogen) than that formed on the support. The rate of coke formation on the metal is weakly dependent on the propylene and hydrogen pressures but increases concurrently with the propane pressure. The rate of coke formation on the support increases concurrently with the propane and propylene pressures and decreases with the hydrogen pressure. The coke formed on the metal has aliphatic hydrocarbon characteristic, containing more hydrogen than that formed on the support. The coke formed on the support has an aromatic characteristic. Analytical techniques such as thermal gravimetric analysis, IR spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy, and elemental analysis have been employed to elucidate the complex nature and diversity of coke constituents in these systems.", "Chinese": "在催化系统中，特别是在丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应中，焦炭沉积物的组成随不同的反应条件和催化剂类型而变化。在金属上形成的焦炭比在支撑物上形成的焦炭更软(含有更多的氢)。金属上焦炭的形成速率对丙烯和氢的压力依赖性较弱，但与丙烷压力同时增加。支撑物上焦炭的形成速率与丙烷和丙烯的压力同时增加，而与氢的压力降低。在金属上形成的焦炭具有烷烃的特性，含有的氢比在支撑物上形成的焦炭多。在支撑物上形成的焦炭具有芳香特性。热重分析、红外光谱、拉曼光谱和元素分析等分析技术已被用于阐明这些系统中焦炭成分的复杂性质和多样性。", "Doi": "10.1007/s11244-011-9708-8"},
