          [4] "The composition of cokes varies with reaction condition and catalytic system without a universal definition."

[1] "Operando Raman spectroscopy showed that hydrogen altered the nature of the coke deposits formed during propane dehydrogenation."
          [2] "First of all, the Raman bands become narrower, which suggest a more ordered system with less defects."
          [3] "Secondly, the shift in the position of the G Raman band implies that the size of the graphitic crystallites is decreased."

          [7] "In these cases, three trends are observed as a function of catalyst cycling. First of all, the relative intensity of the coke bands drops over each following cycle."
          [8] "Furthermore, the D1/G ratio drops from ca. 0.74 to 0.35."
          [9] "Finally,the width of the D1 and G bands increases."
          [10] "These trends suggest that less coke, with a more graphitic nature, is deposited for each consecutive cycle."
          [11] "Interestingly, for these experiments the selectivity increases for each following cycle, suggesting a correlation with the type of coke formed: as less coke is deposited, which has a more graphitic nature, side reactions such as cracking are suppressed."

          [13] "The increase in propane dehydrogenation conversion observed with increasing H2 concentration is related to the decreased deposition of coke, which was detected by operando Raman spectroscopy."
          [14] "The low initial selectivity can be explained by the fact that highly active sites present on the catalyst induce cracking and hydrogenolysis in the presence of H2."

          [22] "On the other hand coke in the proximity of supported Pt particles is also more readily combusted, as the Pt can catalyse coke combustion."
          [23] "During propene hydrogenation much larger quantities of coke (around 20wt%) are formed, because large concentrations of propene rapidly polymerize to coke on the catalyst support."

Three different peaks were identified from the TPO profiles on the PtSn catalyst and attributed to different types of coke; coke on and in the vicinity of the metal,coke on the carrier, and graphitic coke on the carrier.
          The amounts of these types were related to reaction conditions.
          The formation of the coke belonging to the first two peaks in the TPO profiles increases with temperature and partial pressure of propene.
          Hydrogen, on the other hand, suppresses the formation.
          The amount of coke that can be attributed to the third peak increases with temperature and propane partial pressure.
          A model is discussed where a minor part of the coke deactivates the catalyst.
          This coke is formed in parallel with the coke that is seen in the first two peaks in the TPO experiments.
          The graphitic coke formed on the carrier is not formed through this route.
          The experiments with different time on stream revealed that the first peak reached a constant level after about 15 h, while the second one still increased.
          Hydrogen was very efficient in preventing coke formation and deactivation but could not remove coke already formed on the catalyst.
          The hydrogenolysis and cracking mechanisms during the propane dehydrogenation are also discussed.

          [3] "The species could be atomic carbon or aromatics on Pt/Al2O3 and C3 species on PtSn/Al2O3 catalyst, respectively."
          [4] "The composition of cokes varies with reaction condition and catalytic system without a universal definition."

[1] "Operando Raman spectroscopy showed that hydrogen altered the nature of the coke deposits formed during propane dehydrogenation."
          [2] "First of all, the Raman bands become narrower, which suggest a more ordered system with less defects."
          [3] "Secondly, the shift in the position of the G Raman band implies that the size of the graphitic crystallites is decreased."

          [7] "In these cases, three trends are observed as a function of catalyst cycling. First of all, the relative intensity of the coke bands drops over each following cycle."
          [8] "Furthermore, the D1/G ratio drops from ca. 0.74 to 0.35."
          [9] "Finally,the width of the D1 and G bands increases."
          [10] "These trends suggest that less coke, with a more graphitic nature, is deposited for each consecutive cycle."
          [11] "Interestingly, for these experiments the selectivity increases for each following cycle, suggesting a correlation with the type of coke formed: as less coke is deposited, which has a more graphitic nature, side reactions such as cracking are suppressed."
          [12] "The Raman spectroscopy data can be used to find an explanation for the trends observed in the activity data."
          [13] "The increase in propane dehydrogenation conversion observed with increasing H2 concentration is related to the decreased deposition of coke, which was detected by operando Raman spectroscopy."
          [14] "The low initial selectivity can be explained by the fact that highly active sites present on the catalyst induce cracking and hydrogenolysis in the presence of H2."
          [15] "As the catalyst is cycled,less cracking products are observed, suggesting these sites become poisoned."
          [16] "Finally,the experiments with propane concentrations of 25 and 50% show a strong increase in selectivity for each consecutive cycle."

          [22] "On the other hand coke in the proximity of supported Pt particles is also more readily combusted, as the Pt can catalyse coke combustion."
          [23] "During propene hydrogenation much larger quantities of coke (around 20wt%) are formed, because large concentrations of propene rapidly polymerize to coke on the catalyst support."
          [24] "This coke is combusted at temperatures between 450 and 600C."
          [25] "We propose that in the presence of high concentrations of H2,more graphitic coke is formed that mainly covers the catalyst support."

Three different peaks were identified from the TPO profiles on the PtSn catalyst and attributed to different types of coke; coke on and in the vicinity of the metal,coke on the carrier, and graphitic coke on the carrier.
          The amounts of these types were related to reaction conditions.
          The formation of the coke belonging to the first two peaks in the TPO profiles increases with temperature and partial pressure of propene.
          Hydrogen, on the other hand, suppresses the formation.
          The amount of coke that can be attributed to the third peak increases with temperature and propane partial pressure.
          A model is discussed where a minor part of the coke deactivates the catalyst.
          This coke is formed in parallel with the coke that is seen in the first two peaks in the TPO experiments.
          The graphitic coke formed on the carrier is not formed through this route.
          The experiments with different time on stream revealed that the first peak reached a constant level after about 15 h, while the second one still increased.
          Hydrogen was very efficient in preventing coke formation and deactivation but could not remove coke already formed on the catalyst.
          The hydrogenolysis and cracking mechanisms during the propane dehydrogenation are also discussed.

          [4] "The composition of cokes varies with reaction condition and catalytic system without a universal definition."

[1] "Operando Raman spectroscopy showed that hydrogen altered the nature of the coke deposits formed during propane dehydrogenation."
          [2] "First of all, the Raman bands become narrower, which suggest a more ordered system with less defects."
          [3] "Secondly, the shift in the position of the G Raman band implies that the size of the graphitic crystallites is decreased."
          [4] "Finally, the D1/G ratio increases as the H2 concentration in the feed increases."
          [5] "The amount of amorphous coke, as shown by the intensity of the D3 band decreases with increasing hydrogen content, but the error bars regarding the position and width are very large."
          [6] "Catalyst cycling does not affect the Raman band positions,related widths and the ratio between the D1/G bands in most experiments performed, with the exception of experiments with 50 and 25% propane on the Pt/Al2O3 catalyst and 75% propane feed on the Pt-Sn/Al2O3 catalyst."
          [7] "In these cases, three trends are observed as a function of catalyst cycling. First of all, the relative intensity of the coke bands drops over each following cycle."
          [8] "Furthermore, the D1/G ratio drops from ca. 0.74 to 0.35."
          [9] "Finally,the width of the D1 and G bands increases."
          [10] "These trends suggest that less coke, with a more graphitic nature, is deposited for each consecutive cycle."
          [11] "Interestingly, for these experiments the selectivity increases for each following cycle, suggesting a correlation with the type of coke formed: as less coke is deposited, which has a more graphitic nature, side reactions such as cracking are suppressed."
          [12] "The Raman spectroscopy data can be used to find an explanation for the trends observed in the activity data."
          [13] "The increase in propane dehydrogenation conversion observed with increasing H2 concentration is related to the decreased deposition of coke, which was detected by operando Raman spectroscopy."
          [14] "The low initial selectivity can be explained by the fact that highly active sites present on the catalyst induce cracking and hydrogenolysis in the presence of H2."
          [15] "As the catalyst is cycled,less cracking products are observed, suggesting these sites become poisoned."
          [16] "Finally,the experiments with propane concentrations of 25 and 50% show a strong increase in selectivity for each consecutive cycle."
          [17] "For these specific experiments, less coke of a more graphitic nature is detected by operando Raman spectroscopy, suggesting a link between the presence of relatively disordered coke deposits and side reactions,such as cracking."
          [18] "Thermogravimetrical analysis (TGA) experiments, shown in the supplementary information Fig. S4, on deactivated Pt/Al2O3 and Pt-Sn/Al2O3 catalysts support the findings found by operando Raman spectroscopy."
          [19] "The amount of coke combusted decreases as H2 is added in the feed."
          [20] "Furthermore, the temperature at which this coke is combusted is increased from 450C to 600C for the feed consisting of 50% propane and 50% H2."
          [21] "In literature it has been reported many times, that disordered carbon combusts at lower temperatures than highly ordered graphitic sheets."
          [22] "On the other hand coke in the proximity of supported Pt particles is also more readily combusted, as the Pt can catalyse coke combustion."
          [23] "During propene hydrogenation much larger quantities of coke (around 20wt%) are formed, because large concentrations of propene rapidly polymerize to coke on the catalyst support."
          [24] "This coke is combusted at temperatures between 450 and 600C."
          [25] "We propose that in the presence of high concentrations of H2,more graphitic coke is formed that mainly covers the catalyst support."
          [26] "In the absence of H2, more disordered coke is formed,that is also present on the supported Pt nanoparticles."
          [27] "H2 assists in keeping the surface of the Pt free of these disordered coke species."

Three different peaks were identified from the TPO profiles on the PtSn catalyst and attributed to different types of coke; coke on and in the vicinity of the metal,coke on the carrier, and graphitic coke on the carrier.
          The amounts of these types were related to reaction conditions.
          The formation of the coke belonging to the first two peaks in the TPO profiles increases with temperature and partial pressure of propene.
          Hydrogen, on the other hand, suppresses the formation.
          The amount of coke that can be attributed to the third peak increases with temperature and propane partial pressure.
          A model is discussed where a minor part of the coke deactivates the catalyst.
          This coke is formed in parallel with the coke that is seen in the first two peaks in the TPO experiments.
          The graphitic coke formed on the carrier is not formed through this route.
          The experiments with different time on stream revealed that the first peak reached a constant level after about 15 h, while the second one still increased.
          Hydrogen was very efficient in preventing coke formation and deactivation but could not remove coke already formed on the catalyst.
          The hydrogenolysis and cracking mechanisms during the propane dehydrogenation are also discussed.
