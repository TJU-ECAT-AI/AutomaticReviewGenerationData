[1] "A series of CeO2-supported NiFe catalysts with different Ni/Fe ratios (SI Appendix, Table S1) were synthesized and tested (873 K, 10 mL/min C2H6 + 10 mL/min CO2 + 20 mL/min Ar, SI Appendix, Figs. S2 and S3 and Table S2), to explore the optimal Ni/Fe ratio for CO2-assisted dehydrogenation of ethane."
[2] "The NiFeOx interfaces and NiCeOx interfaces are identified as the most likely active sites for CO2-assisted dehydrogenation of ethane (i.e., selectively cleave the CH bonds while preserving the CC bond to produce ethylene) and dry reforming of ethane (efficiently break all of the CH and CC bonds to produce synthesis gas), respectively."
[3] "The in situ XRD and XAS measurements, the Ni-rich NiFe alloy exists as particles. Combined with the results revealed by the STEM-EELS analysis, it can be concluded that Fe (in the form of amorphous FeOx) is preferred to exist between metal particles and the CeO2 support (as the FeCe bonding is found on both catalysts) under reaction conditions."
[4] "The DFT calculations also confirm that the FeOx/Ni(111) interface can promote the stability of *CH3CH2 and therefore the dehydrogenation pathway, while hindering the formation of *CH3CH2O and its subsequent dehydrogenation and CC bond cleavage reactions via *CH3CO (Fig. 5)."
[5] "The DFT-calculated activation energy of oxidative dehydrogenation reaction (oxygen-assisted CH bond cleavage) is lower than that of dry-reforming reaction (CC bond scission) on FeOx/Ni(111), consistent with the experimental results that the NiFeOx interfaces are identified as the most likely active sites to promote the selective CH bond cleavage of ethane."

1.Advanced in situ and ex situ analytical techniques, including XRD, XANES, EXAFS, and ADF-STEM with EELS, have been used to synthesize and test a series of CeO2-supported NiFe catalysts with different Ni/Fe ratios. These techniques have helped to identify the NiFeOx and NiCeOx interfaces as the most likely active sites for CO2-assisted dehydrogenation of ethane and dry reforming of ethane, respectively. The in situ XRD and XAS measurements have revealed that the Ni-rich NiFe alloy exists as particles, and the STEM-EELS analysis has shown that Fe (in the form of amorphous FeOx) is preferred to exist between metal particles and the CeO2 support. The DFT calculations have confirmed that the FeOx/Ni(111) interface can promote the stability of *CH3CH2 and therefore the dehydrogenation pathway, while hindering the formation of *CH3CH2O and its subsequent dehydrogenation and CC bond cleavage reactions via *CH3CO. The DFT-calculated activation energy of oxidative dehydrogenation reaction (oxygen-assisted CH bond cleavage) is lower than that of dry-reforming reaction (CC bond scission) on FeOx/Ni(111), consistent with the experimental results that the NiFeOx interfaces are identified as the most likely active sites to promote the selective CH bond cleavage of ethane. These findings have significant implications for catalyst performance and design, as they provide insights into the structure-function relationships between the active site and catalytic performance, offering strategies for controlling and tuning the activity and selectivity of oxide-supported metal catalysts for the tandem reactions of CO2 reduction and ethane dehydrogenation.

1.先进的原位和非原位分析技术，包括XRD，XANES，EXAFS和ADF-STEM与EELS，已被用于合成和测试一系列具有不同Ni/Fe比率的CeO2支持的NiFe催化剂。这些技术有助于确定NiFeOx和NiCeOx界面是CO2辅助乙烷脱氢和乙烷干重整的最可能活性位点。原位XRD和XAS测量表明，Ni丰富的NiFe合金以颗粒形式存在，而STEM-EELS分析表明，Fe（以无定形FeOx的形式）优选存在于金属颗粒和CeO2支撑之间。DFT计算证实，FeOx/Ni(111)界面可以促进*CH3CH2的稳定性，从而促进脱氢途径，同时抑制*CH3CH2O的形成及其随后的脱氢和CC键裂解反应通过*CH3CO。DFT计算的氧化脱氢反应（氧气辅助的CH键裂解）的活化能低于FeOx/Ni(111)上的干重整反应（CC键裂解）。这与实验结果一致，即NiFeOx界面被确定为促进乙烷CH键选择性裂解的最可能活性位点。这些发现对催化剂性能和设计具有重要意义，因为它们提供了活性位点和催化性能之间的结构-功能关系的见解，为控制和调整氧化物支持的金属催化剂的活性和选择性提供了策略，用于CO2还原和乙烷脱氢的串联反应。
