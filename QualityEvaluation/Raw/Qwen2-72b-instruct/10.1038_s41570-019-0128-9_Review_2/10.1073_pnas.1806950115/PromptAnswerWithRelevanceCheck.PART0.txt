[1] "A series of CeO2-supported NiFe catalysts with different Ni/Fe ratios (SI Appendix, Table S1) were synthesized and tested (873 K, 10 mL/min C2H6 + 10 mL/min CO2 + 20 mL/min Ar, SI Appendix, Figs. S2 and S3 and Table S2), to explore the optimal Ni/Fe ratio for CO2-assisted dehydrogenation of ethane."
[2] "The in situ XRD experiments were performed to reveal the structural information of Ni1Fe3/CeO2 and Ni3Fe1/CeO2 under reaction conditions."
[3] "To further determine the valence state of Ni and Fe on Ni1Fe3/CeO2 and Ni3Fe1/CeO2, in situ X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) spectra were collected using a home-designed microchannel reactor (SI Appendix, Fig. S12)."
[4] "To confirm the formation of amorphous FeOx thin layers on CeO2, ex situ scanning transmission electron microscopy with electron-energy-loss spectroscopy (STEM- EELS) analysis was conducted on the spent Ni1Fe3/CeO2 and Ni3Fe1/CeO2 catalysts."
[5] "The detailed extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) fitting results (Table 1 and SI Appendix, Figs. S14 and S15) reveal that the coordination numbers (C.N.) of NiNi(Fe) on Ni1Fe3/CeO2 and Ni3Fe1/CeO2 were 10.4 and 11.3, indicating metallic NiFe alloy resided in the form of particles with diameters of 2.54.0 nm (based on hemisphere fcc models)."
[6] "The presence of FeOx layer was confirmed by the high-resolution STEM image as shown in Fig. 4E. A layer of 2-nm amorphous FeOx formed on CeO2 particles in Ni1Fe3/CeO2 were clearly seen (Fig. 4E and SI Appendix, Fig. S17)."
[7] "The profiles indicated the presence of a thin layer of FeOx formed on CeO2 particles in Ni1Fe3/CeO2 while such a layer was absent in Ni3Fe1/CeO2."

1.Advanced in situ and ex situ analytical techniques, including XRD, XANES, EXAFS, and ADF-STEM with EELS, have been used to study the structural properties, oxidation states, spatial distribution, and morphological characteristics of active sites in Fe3Ni1/CeO2 and Fe1Ni3/CeO2 catalysts. The XRD experiments revealed the structural information of the catalysts under reaction conditions, showing that metallic NiFe alloy with fcc structure was formed on both catalysts. The XANES spectra determined the valence state of Ni and Fe, indicating that Ni was in the metallic state while Fe was in a state between FeO and Fe3O4. The EXAFS fitting results revealed the coordination numbers and bond lengths of Ni and Fe, suggesting the formation of Ni-rich NiFe alloy particles. The STEM-EELS analysis confirmed the formation of amorphous FeOx thin layers on CeO2, with a 2-nm layer observed in Ni1Fe3/CeO2 but not in Ni3Fe1/CeO2. These findings suggest that the FeOx layer plays a crucial role in the selective CH bond cleavage of ethane to produce ethylene, while the NiCeOx interfacial sites are responsible for the efficient CC bond scission to produce synthesis gas. The differences in the structural properties and oxidation states of the active sites between the two catalysts have significant implications for their performance and design in CO2-assisted dehydrogenation of ethane.
