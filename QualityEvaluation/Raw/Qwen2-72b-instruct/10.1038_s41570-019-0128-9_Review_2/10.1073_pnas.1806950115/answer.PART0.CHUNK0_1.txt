[1] "In situ X-ray diffraction (XRD) experiments were performed to reveal the structural information of Ni1Fe3/CeO2 and Ni3Fe1/CeO2 under reaction conditions."
[2] "To further determine the valence state of Ni and Fe on Ni1Fe3/CeO2 and Ni3Fe1/CeO2, in situ X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) spectra were collected using a home-designed microchannel reactor."
[3] "To gain better understanding of the active sites for tuning the selectivity, density functional theory (DFT) calculations were performed to investigate the potential reaction pathways for the oxidative CH bond cleavage (dehydrogenation) and CC bond scission (reforming) of ethane."
[4] "Ex situ scanning transmission electron microscopy with electron-energy-loss spectroscopy (STEM-EELS) analysis was conducted on the spent Ni1Fe3/CeO2 and Ni3Fe1/CeO2 catalysts."
[5] "The results demonstrated that the NiFeOx and NiCeOx interfaces are the most likely active sites for CO2-assisted dehydrogenation of ethane (selective CH bond cleavage to produce ethylene) and dry reforming of ethane with CO2 (efficient CC bond scission to produce synthesis gas), respectively."

1.Advanced in situ and ex situ analytical techniques, including XRD, XANES, EXAFS, and ADF-STEM with EELS, have been used to understand the structural properties, oxidation states, spatial distribution, and morphological characteristics of active sites in Fe3Ni1/CeO2 and Fe1Ni3/CeO2 catalysts. XRD experiments revealed the structural information of the catalysts under reaction conditions, while XANES spectra were collected to determine the valence state of Ni and Fe. DFT calculations were performed to investigate the potential reaction pathways for the oxidative CH bond cleavage and CC bond scission of ethane. STEM-EELS analysis was conducted on the spent catalysts to understand the spatial distribution and morphological characteristics of the active sites. The key differences between the two catalysts are that the NiFeOx and NiCeOx interfaces are the most likely active sites for CO2-assisted dehydrogenation of ethane and dry reforming of ethane with CO2, respectively. These findings have significant implications for catalyst performance and design, as they provide insights into the structure-function relationships between the active site and catalytic performance.

1.先进的原位和外位分析技术，包括XRD，XANES，EXAFS和ADF-STEM与EELS，已被用于理解Fe3Ni1/CeO2和Fe1Ni3/CeO2催化剂中活性位点的结构特性，氧化态，空间分布和形态特征。XRD实验揭示了催化剂在反应条件下的结构信息，而XANES光谱被收集以确定Ni和Fe的价态。DFT计算被用来研究乙烷氧化CH键断裂和CC键裂解的潜在反应途径。在耗尽的催化剂上进行了STEM-EELS分析，以了解活性位点的空间分布和形态特征。这两种催化剂之间的主要区别在于NiFeOx和NiCeOx界面是最可能的活性位点，分别用于CO2辅助的乙烷脱氢和与CO2的乙烷干重整。这些发现对催化剂性能和设计具有重要意义，因为它们提供了活性位点和催化性能之间的结构-功能关系的见解。
