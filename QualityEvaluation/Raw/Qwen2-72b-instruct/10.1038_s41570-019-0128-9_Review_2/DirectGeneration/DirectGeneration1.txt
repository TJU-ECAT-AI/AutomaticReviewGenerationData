The comprehensive characterization and comparison of active sites in Fe3Ni1/CeO2 and Fe1Ni3/CeO2 catalysts is a critical area of research that employs advanced in situ and ex situ analytical techniques. These techniques enable the elucidation of structural, chemical, and morphological properties at both atomic and nanoscale levels. By using methods such as X-ray absorption spectroscopy, scanning transmission electron microscopy, and temperature-programmed reduction, researchers can gain insights into the nature of the active sites, their distribution, and their electronic states. This detailed understanding is essential for optimizing the catalytic performance of these materials in various chemical processes, as it allows for the identification of the most effective compositions and structures. Moreover, comparing Fe3Ni1/CeO2 and Fe1Ni3/CeO2 catalysts provides valuable information on how the ratio of iron to nickel affects catalytic activity and stability, guiding future catalyst design and development.
