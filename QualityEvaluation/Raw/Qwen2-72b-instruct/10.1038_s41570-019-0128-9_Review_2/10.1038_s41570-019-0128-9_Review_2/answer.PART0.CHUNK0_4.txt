[1] "In situ and ex situ characterization of active sites The structural properties of Fe3Ni1/CeO2 and Fe1Ni3/CeO2 are evident from in situ synchrotron X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns93, while the oxidation state of Ni and Fe come from in situ X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) data93."
[2] "Detailed extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) fitting results suggest that metallic Ni or FeNi alloys make up particles of diameters 2.54.0nm."
[3] "The existence of FeCe bonding and the low number of O atoms coordinated to Fe sites indicate that the oxidized Fe species exist as thin layers on CeO2, which can be corroborated using ex situ annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy (ADF-STEM) with electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS)93."
[4] "The high-resolution micrographs indicated that the CeO2 particles in Fe3Ni1/CeO2 (Fig. 5a,b) differ from those in Fe1Ni3/CeO2 (Fig. 5c,d), because the former catalyst has CeO2 in contact with a thin layer of FeOx (Fig. 5e), as also evidenced by EELS line scan profiles (Fig. 5f)."

1.Advanced in situ and ex situ analytical techniques, including XRD, XANES, EXAFS, and ADF-STEM with EELS, have been used to understand the structural properties, oxidation states, spatial distribution, and morphological characteristics of active sites in Fe3Ni1/CeO2 and Fe1Ni3/CeO2 catalysts. XRD patterns reveal the structural properties of the catalysts, while XANES data provide information on the oxidation states of Ni and Fe. EXAFS fitting results suggest the presence of metallic Ni or FeNi alloys with particle diameters of 2.5 to 4.0 nm. FeCe bonding and the low number of O atoms coordinated to Fe sites indicate that oxidized Fe species exist as thin layers on CeO2, which is confirmed by ADF-STEM with EELS. The CeO2 particles in Fe3Ni1/CeO2 differ from those in Fe1Ni3/CeO2, with the former having CeO2 in contact with a thin layer of FeOx. These findings have implications for catalyst performance and design, as they provide insights into the active sites responsible for catalytic activity.

1.先进的原位和非原位分析技术，包括XRD、XANES、EXAFS和ADF-STEM与EELS，已被用于理解Fe3Ni1/CeO2和Fe1Ni3/CeO2催化剂中活性位点的结构特性、氧化态、空间分布和形态特征。XRD图谱揭示了催化剂的结构特性，而XANES数据提供了Ni和Fe氧化态的信息。EXAFS拟合结果表明存在金属Ni或FeNi合金，颗粒直径为2.5至4.0纳米。FeCe键合和Fe位点上配位的O原子数量较少表明氧化Fe物种以薄层形式存在于CeO2上，这通过ADF-STEM与EELS得到证实。Fe3Ni1/CeO2中的CeO2颗粒与Fe1Ni3/CeO2中的不同，前者具有CeO2与薄层FeOx接触。这些发现对催化剂性能和设计有影响，因为它们提供了对催化活性负责的活性位点的见解。
