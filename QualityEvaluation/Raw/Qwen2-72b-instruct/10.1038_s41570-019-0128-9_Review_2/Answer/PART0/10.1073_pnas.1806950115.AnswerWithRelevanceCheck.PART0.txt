          [1] "A series of CeO2-supported NiFe catalysts with different Ni/Fe ratios (SI Appendix, Table S1) were synthesized and tested (873 K, 10 mL/min C2H6 + 10 mL/min CO2 + 20 mL/min Ar, SI Appendix, Figs. S2 and S3 and Table S2), to explore the optimal Ni/Fe ratio for CO2-assisted dehydrogenation of ethane."
          [2] "The in situ XRD experiments were performed to reveal the structural information of Ni1Fe3/CeO2 and Ni3Fe1/CeO2 under reaction conditions."
          [3] "To further determine the valence state of Ni and Fe on Ni1Fe3/CeO2 and Ni3Fe1/CeO2, in situ X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) spectra were collected using a home-designed microchannel reactor (SI Appendix, Fig. S12)."
          [4] "To confirm the formation of amorphous FeOx thin layers on CeO2, ex situ scanning transmission electron microscopy with electron-energy-loss spectroscopy (STEM- EELS) analysis was conducted on the spent Ni1Fe3/CeO2 and Ni3Fe1/CeO2 catalysts."
          [5] "The detailed extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) fitting results (Table 1 and SI Appendix, Figs. S14 and S15) reveal that the coordination numbers (C.N.) of NiNi(Fe) on Ni1Fe3/CeO2 and Ni3Fe1/CeO2 were 10.4 and 11.3, indicating metallic NiFe alloy resided in the form of particles with diameters of 2.54.0 nm (based on hemisphere fcc models)."
          [6] "The presence of FeOx layer was confirmed by the high-resolution STEM image as shown in Fig. 4E. A layer of 2-nm amorphous FeOx formed on CeO2 particles in Ni1Fe3/CeO2 were clearly seen (Fig. 4E and SI Appendix, Fig. S17)."
          [7] "The profiles indicated the presence of a thin layer of FeOx formed on CeO2 particles in Ni1Fe3/CeO2 while such a layer was absent in Ni3Fe1/CeO2."

          Advanced in situ and ex situ analytical techniques, including XRD, XANES, EXAFS, and ADF-STEM with EELS, have been used to understand the structural properties, oxidation states, spatial distribution, and morphological characteristics of active sites in Fe3Ni1/CeO2 and Fe1Ni3/CeO2 catalysts. XRD experiments revealed the structural information of the catalysts under reaction conditions, showing the formation of Ni-rich NiFe alloy with fcc structure. XANES spectra were collected to determine the valence state of Ni and Fe, indicating that the oxidation state of Ni was metallic Ni, while Fe exhibited similar near-edge features between FeO and Fe3O4. EXAFS fitting results revealed the coordination numbers and bond lengths of Ni and Fe, suggesting the formation of metallic NiFe alloy particles. ADF-STEM with EELS analysis confirmed the formation of amorphous FeOx thin layers on CeO2, with a 2-nm layer observed in Ni1Fe3/CeO2 but absent in Ni3Fe1/CeO2. These findings highlight the differences in the structural properties and spatial distribution of active sites between the two catalysts, which have implications for their performance and design in CO2-assisted dehydrogenation of ethane.

          利用XRD、XANES、EXAFS和ADF-STEM与EELS等先进的原位和非原位分析技术，我们能够理解Fe3Ni1/CeO2和Fe1Ni3/CeO2催化剂中活性位点的结构特性、氧化态、空间分布和形态特征。XRD实验揭示了催化剂在反应条件下的结构信息，显示形成了富镍的NiFe合金，具有fcc结构。收集XANES光谱以确定Ni和Fe的价态，表明Ni的氧化态为金属Ni，而Fe的近边特征介于FeO和Fe3O4之间。EXAFS拟合结果揭示了Ni和Fe的配位数和键长，表明形成了金属NiFe合金颗粒。ADF-STEM与EELS分析证实了CeO2上形成了无定形FeOx薄层，在Ni1Fe3/CeO2中观察到了2nm的层，但在Ni3Fe1/CeO2中却不存在。这些发现突出了两种催化剂之间活性位点的结构特性和空间分布的差异，这对它们在CO2辅助乙烷脱氢反应中的性能和设计具有重要意义。
