Advanced in situ and ex situ analytical techniques, including XRD, XANES, EXAFS, and ADF-STEM with EELS, have been used to understand the structural properties, oxidation states, spatial distribution, and morphological characteristics of active sites in Fe3Ni1/CeO2 and Fe1Ni3/CeO2 catalysts. XRD experiments revealed the structural information of the catalysts under reaction conditions, showing the formation of Ni-rich NiFe alloy with fcc structure. XANES spectra were collected to determine the valence state of Ni and Fe, indicating that the oxidation state of Ni was metallic Ni, while Fe exhibited similar near-edge features between FeO and Fe3O4. EXAFS fitting results revealed the coordination numbers and bond lengths of Ni and Fe, suggesting the formation of metallic NiFe alloy particles. ADF-STEM with EELS analysis confirmed the formation of amorphous FeOx thin layers on CeO2, with a 2-nm layer observed in Ni1Fe3/CeO2 but absent in Ni3Fe1/CeO2. These findings highlight the differences in the structural properties and spatial distribution of active sites between the two catalysts, which have implications for their performance and design in CO2-assisted dehydrogenation of ethane.

XRD patterns reveal the structural properties of the catalysts, while XANES data provide information on the oxidation states of Ni and Fe. EXAFS fitting results suggest the presence of metallic Ni or FeNi alloys with particle diameters of 2.5 to 4.0 nm. FeCe bonding and the low number of O atoms coordinated to Fe sites indicate that oxidized Fe species exist as thin layers on CeO2, which is confirmed by ADF-STEM with EELS. The CeO2 particles in Fe3Ni1/CeO2 differ from those in Fe1Ni3/CeO2, with the former having CeO2 in contact with a thin layer of FeOx. These findings have implications for catalyst performance and design, as they provide insights into the active sites responsible for catalytic activity.
