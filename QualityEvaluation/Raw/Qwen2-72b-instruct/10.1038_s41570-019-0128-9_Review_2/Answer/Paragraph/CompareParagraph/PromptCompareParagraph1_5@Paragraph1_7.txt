<file-attachment-contents filename="Review A.txt"> 
The comprehensive characterization of Fe3Ni1/CeO2 and Fe1Ni3/CeO2 catalysts using advanced in situ and ex situ analytical techniques, including XRD, XANES, EXAFS, and ADF-STEM with EELS, has provided detailed insights into their structural, chemical, and morphological properties at atomic and nanoscale levels \[10.1073/pnas.1806950115\]. XRD experiments revealed the structural information of the catalysts under reaction conditions, showing the formation of Ni-rich NiFe alloy with fcc structure. XANES spectra determined the valence state of Ni and Fe, indicating metallic Ni and Fe with near-edge features between FeO and Fe3O4. EXAFS fitting results revealed the coordination numbers and bond lengths of Ni and Fe, suggesting the formation of metallic NiFe alloy particles with diameters of 2.5 to 4.0 nm. ADF-STEM with EELS analysis confirmed the formation of amorphous FeOx thin layers on CeO2, with a 2-nm layer observed in Ni1Fe3/CeO2 but absent in Ni3Fe1/CeO2 \[10.1038/s41570-019-0128-9\_2\].
                    
                    Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: The synergistic use of advanced in situ and ex situ analytical techniques has unveiled the intricate details of active sites in Fe3Ni1/CeO2 and Fe1Ni3/CeO2 catalysts, providing a foundation for the design of more efficient propane dehydrogenation catalysts. Future research endeavors might focus on the development of novel catalysts with tailored active sites for enhanced selectivity and stability. The exploration of the dynamic behavior of active sites under reaction conditions, facilitated by in situ techniques, could offer insights into the catalytic mechanisms and guide the rational design of catalysts. Moreover, the integration of computational methods with experimental data could provide a deeper understanding of the structure-performance relationships, paving the way for the discovery of new catalysts with optimized properties.

These findings highlight the differences in the structural properties and spatial distribution of active sites between the two catalysts, which have implications for their performance and design in CO2-assisted dehydrogenation of ethane.
                
                Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: The synergistic use of advanced in situ and ex situ analytical techniques has unveiled the intricate details of active sites in Fe3Ni1/CeO2 and Fe1Ni3/CeO2 catalysts, providing a solid foundation for the rational design of catalysts for propane dehydrogenation. Future research endeavors might focus on the development of novel catalysts with optimized Ni/Fe ratios and enhanced stability, leveraging the insights gained from the detailed characterization of active sites. The exploration of new synthesis methods that can precisely control the formation of FeOx layers on CeO2 could lead to catalysts with improved activity and selectivity. Moreover, the integration of machine learning algorithms with experimental data could accelerate the discovery of catalysts with tailored properties for specific reactions, such as propane dehydrogenation. The application of in situ spectroscopic techniques to monitor the dynamic changes in catalyst structure and composition under reaction conditions could further enhance our understanding of the catalytic mechanisms and guide the design of more efficient catalysts.
