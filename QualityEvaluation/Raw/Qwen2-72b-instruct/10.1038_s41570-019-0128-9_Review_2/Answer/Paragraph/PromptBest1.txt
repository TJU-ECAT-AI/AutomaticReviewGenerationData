Advanced in situ and ex situ analytical techniques, including XRD, XANES, EXAFS, and ADF-STEM with EELS, have been employed to elucidate the structural properties, oxidation states, spatial distribution, and morphological characteristics of active sites in Fe3Ni1/CeO2 and Fe1Ni3/CeO2 catalysts for CO2-assisted dehydrogenation of ethane \[10.1073/pnas.1806950115\]. XRD experiments revealed the structural information of the catalysts under reaction conditions, showing the formation of Ni-rich NiFe alloy with fcc structure. XANES spectra were collected to determine the valence state of Ni and Fe, indicating that the oxidation state of Ni was metallic Ni, while Fe exhibited similar near-edge features between FeO and Fe3O4. EXAFS fitting results revealed the coordination numbers and bond lengths of Ni and Fe, suggesting the formation of metallic NiFe alloy particles. ADF-STEM with EELS analysis confirmed the formation of amorphous FeOx thin layers on CeO2, with a 2-nm layer observed in Ni1Fe3/CeO2 but absent in Ni3Fe1/CeO2. These findings highlight the differences in the structural properties and spatial distribution of active sites between the two catalysts, which have implications for their performance and design in CO2-assisted dehydrogenation of ethane \[10.1073/pnas.1806950115\].

The differences in structural properties and spatial distribution of active sites between the two catalysts suggest that the Ni/Fe ratio plays a crucial role in determining catalyst performance. Future research efforts might focus on the optimization of the Ni/Fe ratio to enhance catalytic activity and selectivity. Moreover, the development of new in situ and ex situ analytical techniques could further advance our understanding of the active sites and their role in catalytic reactions. The exploration of novel catalysts with tailored active sites could also lead to the design of more efficient catalysts for CO2-assisted dehydrogenation of ethane and other hydrocarbons.
