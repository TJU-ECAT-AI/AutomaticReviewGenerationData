Bell, University of California, Berkeley, CA, and approved July 9, 2018 (received for review April 24, 2018) Ethylene (C2H4) is one of the most important raw materials for chemical industry. The tandem reactions of CO2-assisted dehydroge- nation of ethane (C2H6) to ethylene creates an opportunity to effec- tively use the underutilized ethane from shale gas while mitigating anthropogenic CO2 emissions. Here we identify the most likely ac- tive sites over CeO2-supported NiFe catalysts by using combined in situ characterization with density-functional theory (DFT) calcula- tions. The experimental and theoretical results reveal that the Ni FeOx interfacial sites can selectively break the CH bonds and pre- serve the CC bond of C2H6 to produce ethylene, while the NiCeOx interfacial sites efficiently cleave all of the CH and CC bonds to produce synthesis gas. Controlled synthesis of the two distinct ac- tive sites enables rational enhancement of the ethylene selectivity for the CO2-assisted dehydrogenation of ethane.

S
hale gas has the potential to revolutionize the energy and chemical industry as its verified reserves have continually in- creased recently. Ethylene, one of the most important intermedi- ates for chemical industry, can be produced from the underutilized ethane (10% depending on the particular source) in shale gas (1,2). The traditional routes for ethylene production from thermal steam cracking (3, 4) and direct dehydrogenation (5) of ethane are energy-intensive and inevitably accompanied with serious coking problems (1, 6). Alternatively, the tandem CO2-assisted dehydro- genation of ethane to ethylene (overall reaction of C2H6 + CO2 C2H4 + CO + H2O) over bifunctional catalysts (e.g., reducible oxide-supported metal catalysts) has received significant attention (1, 710). In this case, CO2 can dissociate on the reducible oxide to produce CO and reactive oxygen species (*O). Then, the corre- sponding *O would assist the dehydrogenation of ethane that ad- sorbs on the metaloxide interfaces to ethylene and H2O.
According to the thermodynamic study (SI Appendix, Fig. S1), the compatible reaction temperatures should be over 823 K, at which these two tandem reactions can operate on different sites simul- taneously. In addition, in this temperature range the stability of catalysts is improved as coke can be removed via the reverse Boudouard reaction (CO2 + C 2CO). Furthermore, the equi- librium yield of ethylene can be increased as hydrogen is consumed via the reverse water gas shift reaction (CO2 + H2 CO + H2O).However, the competing dry-reforming pathway (C2H6 + 2CO2 4CO + 3H2) can also occur simultaneously through the CC bond scission to produce synthesis gas (CO and H2). Since the scission of the CC bond (377 kJ/mol) is thermodynamically more favorable than the cleavage of the CH bond (423 kJ/mol) of ethane (11), it is critical to identify catalysts that do not promote the CC bond scission to improve the selectivity to ethylene.
Previous work shows that typical catalysts used for CO2-assisted dehydrogenation of ethane are Ga-based oxides (6, 8), Cr-based oxides (9, 1216), Co-based oxides (17, 18), metal carbides (1, 19),and other catalysts (7, 20, 21). However, details are lacking on the nature of the active sites for the activation of CO2 and ethane and how to selectively control the CH and CC bond scission to in- crease the ethylene selectivity. Here we demonstrate that the se- lectivity of CO2-assisted dehydrogenation of ethane to ethylene can be controlled by using CeO2-supported NiFe catalysts with different Ni/Fe ratios. A small amount of Fe introduction promotes the CC bond scission activity (e.g., Ni3Fe1/CeO2 with 99% CO selectivity),while an optimal amount of Fe greatly increases the selective CH bond cleavage activity (e.g., Ni1Fe3/CeO2 with 78% C2H4 selectiv- ity). The NiFeOx interfaces and NiCeOx interfaces are identified as the most likely active sites for CO2-assisted dehydrogenation of ethane (i.e., selectively cleave the CH bonds while preserving the CC bond to produce ethylene) and dry reforming of ethane (ef- ficiently break all of the CH and CC bonds to produce synthesis gas), respectively. This work shows that the active sites on CeO2- supported NiFe catalysts can be fine-tuned to rationally manipulate the catalytic selectivity in parallel reaction pathways for the tandem reactions of CO2 reduction and ethane dehydrogenation.
Results Effect of Ni/Fe Ratio on Product Selectivity. A series of CeO2-sup- ported NiFe catalysts with different Ni/Fe ratios (SI Appendix, Table S1) were synthesized and tested (873 K, 10 mL/min C2H6 + 10 mL/min CO2 + 20 mL/min Ar, SI Appendix, Figs. S2 and S3 and Table S2), to explore the optimal Ni/Fe ratio for CO2-assisted dehydrogenation of ethane. As shown in Fig. 1A, the selectivity of C2H4 can be tuned from 1 to 78% by changing the Ni/Fe ratio, with the Ni1Fe3/CeO2 catalyst showing the highest C2H4 selectivity. As a comparison, Ni3Fe1/CeO2 shows the highest CO selectivity (99%) Significance Catalytic activity or selectivity of a supported metal catalyst is predominantly determined by its active site structure. Rational optimization of supported metal catalysts requires fundamental insights into active sites and structurefunction relationships.
Here, we convincingly identify two types of metaloxide active sites and successfully correlate them with the corresponding catalytic performance for CO2-assisted dehydrogenation of eth- ane. Controlled synthesis of the two distinct active sites enables rational manipulation of the activity and selectivity, offering an opportunity to efficiently convert the underutilized ethane from shale gas to value-added products while mitigating anthropo- genic CO2 emissions.

through the dry-reforming pathway. To examine the selectivity at comparable reactant conversion under reaction-limited conditions,two controlled experiments were performed at 873 K. The product selectivity was almost unchanged for both catalysts (70% dehy- drogenation selectivity for Ni1Fe3/CeO2 and 97% reforming se- lectivity for Ni3Fe1/CeO2) at comparable C2H6 conversion (Fig. 1B), suggesting that the difference came from the intrinsic kinetics without the effect of the heat/mass transport. Further analysis for the Ni1Fe3/CeO2 and Ni3Fe1/CeO2 catalysts, including the selec- tivity vs. conversion plots (SI Appendix, Fig. S4) and the conversion/ selectivity vs. gas hourly space velocity plots (SI Appendix, Fig. S5),can be found in SI Appendix. Since Ni/CeO2 showed an excellent reforming activity while Fe/CeO2 exhibited a poor activity for both reactions, the distinct performance of Ni1Fe3/CeO2 was inferred to be due to the formation of active sites that originated from inter- actions between Fe and Ni. To verify this, control experiments using Ni1Fe3/CeO2 and the physically mixed sample (Ni/CeO2 + Fe/CeO2) were performed (SI Appendix, Fig. S6). Significant dif- ferences were observed: Ni1Fe3/CeO2 still showed a dominant dehydrogenation selectivity while the mixed sample produced complete reforming products. This confirmed that the interaction between Fe and Ni resulted in a structural variation of active sites,leading to significant differences in the reaction mechanism and product selectivity.
Structures of CeO2 Support and Active Metals. In situ X-ray diffrac- tion (XRD) experiments were performed to reveal the structural information of Ni1Fe3/CeO2 and Ni3Fe1/CeO2 under reaction conditions. Abrupt expansions of CeO2 lattice were observed for both samples (more clearly shown in SI Appendix, Fig. S7 for Ni3Fe1/CeO2), indicating an increase of the average CeO bond length due to the partial reduction of Ce4+ to Ce3+. The reduced CeO2 could effectively promote the activation of CO2, causing direct CO bond cleavage at 873 K. Under reaction conditions,metallic Ni (or NiFe alloy) with face-centered cubic (fcc) structure was observed on both Ni1Fe3/CeO2 and Ni3Fe1/CeO2 (Fig. 2 and SI Appendix, Fig. S8). The main difference between the two cat- alysts was the appearance of crystalline Fe3O4 or Fe2O3 on Ni1Fe3/CeO2 while they were barely found on Ni3Fe1/CeO2. To confirm whether the metal on both catalysts was metallic Ni or NiFe alloy, in situ XRD analysis for Fe3/CeO2 and Ni3/CeO2 was also performed as comparisons (SI Appendix, Figs. S9 and S10).
For Ni3/CeO2, the fcc structural metallic Ni with a lattice constant of 3.558 Å was observed. The lattice constant of the active metal on Ni1Fe3/CeO2 and Ni3Fe1/CeO2 was calculated to be 3.575 and
3.570 Å, respectively, which is slightly larger than that of metallic
Ni, indicating the formation of Ni-rich NiFe alloy with fcc struc- ture (22). This conclusion was verified by the corresponding peak shift for both catalysts under various treatment conditions (Fig. 2 and SI Appendix, Fig. S11). The Fe in NiFe alloy could be oxidized in a CO2/He flow to form amorphous FeOx (23), resulting in a slight right shift of the diffraction peaks (more close to metallic Ni).
When Ni1Fe3/CeO2 was treated in a reductive atmosphere, FeOx could be reduced to form Fe-rich NiFe alloy with fcc structure,leading to a significantly increased lattice parameter (3.621 Å).
Therefore, the formation of Ni-rich NiFe alloy on both catalysts under reaction conditions was confirmed.
Valence State of Ni and Fe. To further determine the valence state of Ni and Fe on Ni1Fe3/CeO2 and Ni3Fe1/CeO2, in situ X-ray ab- sorption near-edge structure (XANES) spectra were collected using a home-designed microchannel reactor (SI Appendix, Fig. S12).

Under reaction conditions (Fig. 3), the oxidation state of Ni in both catalysts (and Ni3/CeO2 as well) was metallic Ni, while the Fe species in both catalysts (and Fe3/CeO2 as well) exhibited similar near-edge features between FeO and Fe3O4 (more close to Fe3O4,see the linear combination fitting results shown in SI Appendix, Fig.
S13 and Table S3 for more details). The detailed extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) fitting results (Table 1 and SI Appendix, Figs. S14 and S15) reveal that the coordination numbers (C.N.) of NiNi(Fe) on Ni1Fe3/CeO2 and Ni3Fe1/CeO2 were 10.4 and 11.3, indicating metallic NiFe alloy resided in the form of particles with diameters of 2.54.0 nm (based on hemisphere fcc models). Compared with Ni3/CeO2, a slight increase in the NiNi(Fe) bond length for both catalysts was observed, consistent with the formation of Ni-rich NiFe alloy with fcc structure as revealed by XRD results. This conclusion was further confirmed by the Fe K- edge EXAFS fittings results as metallic FeFe(Ni) bonding at 2.47 Å was observed in Ni3Fe1/CeO2. The Fe K-edge EXAFS fitting results with and without the contributions from Ce are also shown in SI Appendix, Fig. S16, which suggest that Fe is coordinated with an element with higher Z value (i.e., Ce). The FeCe bonding at
3.63.7 Å was observed on both Ni1Fe3/CeO2 and Ni3Fe1/CeO2,
indicating a strong interaction between Fe and the CeO2 support.
Combined with the small coordination numbers for the FeO bonding, the existence of FeCe bonding suggested that the oxi- dized Fe species tended to form thin layers on CeO2.
Physical State of Active Species. To confirm the formation of amor- phous FeOx thin layers on CeO2, ex situ scanning transmission electron microscopy with electron-energy-loss spectroscopy (STEM- EELS) analysis was conducted on the spent Ni1Fe3/CeO2 and Ni3Fe1/CeO2 catalysts. As shown in Fig. 4, Ni species tended to form particles, agreeing with both in situ XRD and x-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) results. Fe species were found on those Ni particles, suggesting the formation of NiFe alloy as revealed by the XRD and XAS data or the formation of amorphous FeOx at the surface of Ni (or NiFe alloy) particles as stated in the literature (23).
The presence of FeOx layer was confirmed by the high-resolution STEM image as shown in Fig. 4E. A layer of 2-nm amorphous FeOx formed on CeO2 particles in Ni1Fe3/CeO2 were clearly seen (Fig. 4E and SI Appendix, Fig. S17). To further verify this conclusion, EELS line-scan analysis of Fe species was conducted on the two samples. Fig. 4F shows the typical EELS line-scan profiles of Fe species over CeO2 particles for both samples. The profiles indicated the presence of a thin layer of FeOx formed on CeO2 particles in Ni1Fe3/CeO2 while such a layer was absent in Ni3Fe1/CeO2.
Activation Mechanisms of C2H6. To better understand the C2H6 ac- tivation mechanisms on Ni1Fe3/CeO2 and Ni3Fe1/CeO2, C2H6 pulse experiments were performed. The cumulative amounts of major products (C2H4, H2, CH4, and CO) after each pulse in- jection are plotted in SI Appendix, Fig. S18. The observations were consistent with the flow reactor data: C2H4 was the primary product on Ni1Fe3/CeO2 while CH4, CO, and H2 were the main products on Ni3Fe1/CeO2. More coke formation, associated with much higher CH4 and H2 production, was found on Ni3Fe1/CeO2 (SI Appendix, Fig. S19) as it promotes the CC bond scission. This phenomenon was confirmed by the thermogravimetric analysis results (SI Appendix, Fig. S20): the total amount of carbon de- posits on the spent Ni3Fe1/CeO2 catalyst after 14-h flow reactor operation was 8.7 wt % (7,250 μmol/g), while that on the spent Ni1Fe3/CeO2 sample was barely seen, only 0.2 wt % (170 μmol/g).
The competition between the selective CH bond cleavage and the CC bond scission of C2H6 can be reflected by the comparison of the amount of C2H4 production with the total amount of CH4, CO, and coke formation (SI Appendix, Fig. S21). The selectivities were almost the same with the flow reactor results, i.e., over 75% C2H4 selectivity on Ni1Fe3/CeO2 while over 99% CO selectivity on Ni3Fe1/CeO2. As shown in SI Appendix, Fig. S21C, two reaction pathways of C2H6, i.e., oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH, C2H6 + *O C2H4 + H2O) and direct dehydrogenation (DDH, C2H6 C2H4 + H2), were observed on Ni1Fe3/CeO2. The ODH pathway dominated the production of C2H4 at the first three injections,indicating that the ODH pathway was more favorable than the DDH pathway for C2H6 activation when the reactive oxygen spe- cies on Ni1Fe3/CeO2 were sufficient. For Ni3Fe1/CeO2, oxygen- assisted activation (C2H6 + *O CO) and direct dissociation of C2H6 (C2H6 CH4, coke) were competitive at the first three in- jections, suggesting that the two activation pathways were expected to occur in parallel when the amount of reactive oxygen species (or lattice oxygen) was sufficient.
It is noted that the ratio of the oxygen consumption amount on Ni3Fe1/CeO2 over that on Ni1Fe3/CeO2 is around 20, which is very close to the molar ratio of Fe in Ni1Fe3/CeO2 to Ce in Ni3Fe1/CeO2 (22.3). This might suggest that the oxygen species for oxidative dehydrogenation on Ni1Fe3/CeO2 are originated from iron oxides since the CeO2 support is partially covered by a thin layer of FeOx, while the oxygen species for assisted activa- tion of C2H6 on Ni3Fe1/CeO2 mainly comes from ceria lattice.

Density Functional Theory Calculations. To gain better understanding of the active sites for tuning the selectivity, density functional theory (DFT) calculations were performed to investigate the po- tential reaction pathways for the oxidative CH bond cleavage (dehydrogenation) and CC bond scission (reforming) of ethane.
The models for the DFT calculations were developed in close co- ordination with experimental observations to investigate the effect of Fe concentration in the NiFe bimetallic catalysts for CH and C C bond cleavage of ethane. Four different models for NiFe bi- metallic catalysts were considered in the DFT calculations: Ni(111), Ni-terminated-Ni3Fe(111), bulk-terminated-Ni3Fe(111), and FeOx/ Ni(111) interface. The (111) facet, the energetically most favorable low index surface, was used in the DFT calculations to model surface sites of nanoparticles. Ni-terminated-Ni3Fe(111), bulk- terminated-Ni3Fe(111) allow to systematically study the effect of possible Ni segregation on the oxidative CH and CC bond cleavage of ethane over the Ni3Fe1/CeO2 catalyst. The FeOx/ Ni(111) interface aimed at describing the presence of oxidized Fe in Ni1Fe3/CeO2 under reaction conditions. The formation of FeOx is due to the preferential oxidation of Fe over Ni on the Ni1Fe3/ CeO2 under reaction conditions, as confirmed by EXAFS experi- ments, likely resulting in FeOx-decorated NiFe/CeO2 with a Ni-rich surface. Here, the CeO2 support was not considered in the model.
It is justified because in our experiments CeO2 was the support for all catalysts studied. Therefore, the observed difference in the corresponding activity and selectivity would most likely depend on the metal sites of bimetallic particles, which is the focus of the current DFT calculations to identify the trend among the catalysts.
Ni(111), Ni-terminated-Ni3Fe(111), and bulk-terminated-Ni3Fe (111) surfaces were first partially covered by *O due to the direct *CO2 dissociation on the reduced CeO2 support or the metal oxide interfaces as observed in the CO2 pulse experiments (SI Appendix, Fig. S22). An inverse FeOx/Ni(111) model was used to represent the NiFeOx interfaces, where a small Fe3O3 cluster was deposited on the Ni(111) surface (details of the models are pro- vided in Methods and SI Appendix, Fig. S23). Such an inverse model has been shown to be appropriate to describe the catalytic prop- erties of metaloxide interfaces (2427). Herein, potential path- ways for the CH and CC bond cleavage of ethane leading to *CH2CH2 + H2O(g) and *CH3 + *CO + H2O(g), respectively,were investigated on each of the four model surfaces. It was found that hollow sites (SI Appendix, Tables S4S6) were the preferred sites for the intermediates that bind either via C or O atom on Ni (111), Ni-terminated-Ni3Fe(111), and bulk-terminated-Ni3Fe(111).
On FeOx/Ni(111), O-containing species *CxHyO preferred to bind at the FeOxNi(111) interface while *CxHy species most favorably bound at Ni sites (SI Appendix, Figs. S24 and S25 and Table S7).
Fig. 5 suggests that the first step along the CH and CC bond cleavage pathways are thermodynamically competitive on Ni(111), Ni-terminated-Ni3Fe(111), and bulk-terminated-Ni3Fe(111) (Fig. 5 AC). In contrast, Fig. 5D shows that the CH bond cleavage pathway is thermodynamically more favorable than the CC bond cleavage on FeOx/Ni(111).
The activation energies (Ea) of the elementary steps along the CH and CC bond cleavage pathways included in Fig. 5 were Fig. 4.

www.pnas.org/cgi/doi/10.1073/pnas.1806950115 Yan et al. calculated. As shown in SI Appendix, Table S8, *O-assisted first C H bond scission of ethane is highly activated on all surfaces and is likely the most difficult step in the oxidative CH and CC bond cleavage of ethane. On Ni(111), the *O insertion reaction (*CH3CH2 + *O *CH3CH2O + *) along the CC bond cleavage pathway (ΔE = 0.14 eV and Ea = 0.44 eV) is thermodynamically and kinetically more favorable than the oxidative dehydrogenation reaction (*CH3CH2 + *O *CH2CH2 + *OH) along the CH bond cleavage pathway (ΔE = 0.09 eV and Ea = 0.97 eV). The formed *CH3CH2O undergoes two facile dehydrogenation reac- tions: *CH3CH2O + * *CH3CHO + *H (ΔE = 0.29 eV and Ea =
0.92 eV) and *CH3CHO + * *CH3CO + *H (ΔE = 0.48 eV
and Ea = 0.35 eV) to produce *CH3CO, which facilitates the CC bond cleavage to form *CH3 + *CO (ΔE = 0.48 eV and Ea =
1.01 eV). The favorable CC bond cleavage via *CH3CH2O and
*CH3CO intermediates shows that the oxidative CC bond cleavage is preferred on Ni(111). On Ni-terminated-Ni3Fe(111), SI Appendix, Table S8 shows that the *O insertion reaction to form *CH3CH2O is comparable with the oxidative dehy- drogenation reaction to form *CH2CH2. Hence, Ni-terminated- Ni3Fe(111) is expected to promote both the CC and the CH bond cleavage. On the other hand, on bulk-terminated-Ni3Fe (111), the activation energy of oxidative dehydrogenation reaction is 0.16 eV lower in barrier than the *O insertion reaction. As a result, bulk-terminated-Ni3Fe(111) is predicted to promote the CH bond cleavage slightly more than the CC bond cleavage,suggesting that the presence of Fe on the surface is essential to selectively facilitate the CH bond cleavage of ethane to produce
CH2CH2. Furthermore, the DFT results on FeOx/Ni(111) show
that the oxidative dehydrogenation reaction (ΔE = 0.13 eV and Ea = 1.08 eV) is more favorable than the *O insertion reaction (ΔE = 0.04 eV and Ea = 1.67 eV). Due to the formation of FeOx,the *O on the surface of FeOx/Ni(111) is more stable than that on Ni(111). As a result, the formation of *CH3CH2O or the oxidative pathway is hindered (Fig. 5D). Instead, a hydrogen bond is formed between O of FeOx cluster and H of *CH3CH2 at the interface (SI Appendix, Fig. S25H), which promotes the stability of *CH3CH2 and therefore the dehydrogenation pathway. Consistent with the prediction from energy diagram in Fig. 5D and experiments, the Ni FeOx interface is expected as the active site to promote the de- hydrogenation of ethane.
Discussion As shown in SI Appendix, Table S2, the switch between two distinguished pathways is observed: Ni3Fe1/CeO2 can efficiently break all of the CH and CC bonds to produce synthesis gas; in contrast, Ni1Fe3/CeO2 selectively cleaves the CH bonds while preserving the CC bond to produce C2H4. Although there are significant differences in activity and selectivity, the formation of Ni-rich NiFe alloy with fcc structure (Fig. 2) is observed on both catalysts according to the in situ XRD results under reaction conditions. However, the metallic FeFe(Ni) bonding is only found on Ni3Fe1/CeO2 while barely seen on Ni1Fe3/CeO2 (Table 1), suggesting that the ratio of metallic Fe in overall Fe species is quite low, especially on Ni1Fe3/CeO2. The average valence state of Fe species on the two catalysts is also quite similar under reaction conditions (between FeO and Fe3O4, more close to Fe3O4), as shown in Fig. 3. The crystalline Fe3O4 or Fe2O3 species are only found on Ni1Fe3/CeO2 with relatively weak signals. This means a large proportion of FeOx (with an average valence state between FeO and Fe3O4) is highly dispersed or in an amorphous form taking into account that the ratio of metallic Fe is extremely low.
According to the in situ XRD and XAS measurements, the Ni-rich NiFe alloy exists as particles. Combined with the results revealed by the STEM-EELS analysis, it can be concluded that Fe (in the form of amorphous FeOx) is preferred to exist between metal particles and the CeO2 support (as the FeCe bonding is found on both catalysts) under reaction conditions.
For irreducible oxides (e.g., SiO2, Al2O3) supported Ni catalysts,metallic Ni (Ni0) particles are believed to be the active sites for CO2 reforming of alkanes, where the dissociation rate of alkane is faster than that of CO2 (28). In contrast, for CeO2-supported Ni catalysts, the reducible oxide, CeO2, helps in enabling the facile CO2 dissociation and producing *O species on the surface,making them bifunctional catalysts (29). The produced *O species on the support reacts with carbon originated from the ethane decomposition on the metallic Ni particles at the metalsupport interfaces to produce CO, leading to a much higher reforming activity compared with Ni/SiO2 under the same conditions (as shown in SI Appendix, Fig. S26). Therefore, the NiCeOx in- terfacial sites are proposed as the most likely active sites for dry reforming of ethane as they are more active than the metallic Ni sites in irreducible SiO2.When a small amount of Fe is added to Ni3/CeO2 (i.e., Ni3Fe1/CeO2), although FeOx is preferred to exist underneath the predominantly Ni particles, the NiCeOx interfacial sites still dominate the conversion of ethane with CO2, maintaining the CO selectivity at a high level (over 95%). Meanwhile, the formation of FeOx slightly promotes the removal of the coke deposits, leading to an enhanced reforming activity (23). There- fore, although the metallic Ni particles, Ni-rich NiFe alloy, and NiCeOx interfaces can be the possible active sites for Ni3Fe1/ CeO2, the NiCeOx interfaces are identified as the most likely active sites for dry reforming of ethane with CO2 (effective CH and CC bonds scission of C2H6 to produce synthesis gas) due to the highest activity observed in Ni3Fe1/CeO2.
When a large amount of Fe is introduced (i.e., Ni1Fe3/CeO2),the amorphous FeOx spreads far enough to form the NiFeOx interfacial sites on the perimeter of Ni particles, likely replacing the NiCeOx interfacial sites. Since the FeOx, CeOx, and FeOx CeOx interfaces (all of the possible active species on Fe3/CeO2) show little activity for either oxidative dehydrogenation or dry reforming of ethane, the NiFeOx interfaces are identified as the most likely active sites for CO2-assisted dehydrogenation of ethane (selective CH bond cleavage of C2H6 to produce C2H4).
The DFT calculations also confirm that the FeOx/Ni(111) in- terface can promote the stability of *CH3CH2 and therefore the dehydrogenation pathway, while hindering the formation of *CH3CH2O and its subsequent dehydrogenation and CC bond cleavage reactions via *CH3CO (Fig. 5). The DFT-calculated ac- tivation energy of oxidative dehydrogenation reaction (oxygen- assisted CH bond cleavage) is lower than that of dry-reforming reaction (CC bond scission) on FeOx/Ni(111), consistent with the experimental results that the NiFeOx interfaces are identified as the most likely active sites to promote the selective CH bond cleavage of ethane.
Based on the ethane pulse experiments, the oxidative CH bond cleavage (dehydrogenation) of ethane is proposed to be the primary reaction pathway on NiFeOx interfaces, while oxygen- assisted scission of CC bond and direct dissociation of the CC bond in ethane are competitive and occur in parallel on NiCeOx interfaces. The presence of Ni should help the reduction of its neighbor FeOx to form NiFe alloy with fcc structure. The higher amount of Ni loading, the lower formation temperature of the NiFe alloy. As shown in Fig. 2, the NiFe alloy on Ni1Fe3/CeO2 is not formed until 853 K, while the appearance of the NiFe alloy in the XRD patterns on Ni3Fe1/CeO2 starts at a temperature as low as 693 K. It can be inferred that when the loading amounts of Fe and Ni are close, e.g., Ni3Fe3/CeO2, a large amount of NiFeOx interfaces with moderate activity for oxidative dehydrogenation would coexist with a small amount of NiCeOx interfaces with high activity for dry reforming, leading to almost equal selectivities for both dry reforming and oxidative dehydrogenation pathways, as shown in SI Appendix, Table S2.

Conclusion Combined in situ/ex situ characterization with DFT calculations were employed to convincingly identify the two types of active sites for CO2-assisted dehydrogenation of ethane over CeO2-supported NiFe catalysts. The results demonstrated that the NiFeOx and NiCeOx interfaces are the most likely active sites for CO2-assisted dehydrogenation of ethane (selective CH bond cleavage to pro- duce ethylene) and dry reforming of ethane with CO2 (efficient CC bond scission to produce synthesis gas), respectively. For CeO2-supported NiFe catalysts, the role of Fe in controlling the ethylene selectivity is mainly due to the formation of NiFeOx interfacial sites replacing the NiCeOx interfacial sites. These results gain better understanding of the structurefunction rela- tionships between the active site and catalytic performance, offering strategies for controlling and tuning the activity and selectivity of oxide-supported metal catalysts for the tandem reactions of CO2 reduction and ethane dehydrogenation.
Methods All catalysts were synthesized by an incipient wetness impregnation approach over commercial CeO2 supports with an aqueous solution of the respective metal precursors. CO uptake measurements were performed using an Altamira AMI-300 ip system. The metal loading amount, atomic ratio, and CO uptake value of each catalyst are listed in SI Appendix, Table S1. Flow reactor studies of C2H6 + CO2 reactions were performed in a quartz tube reactor at atmospheric pressure in the presence of reactants (10 mL/min C2H6, 10 mL/min CO2, and 20 mL/min Ar, 873 K). Pulse reactor experiments were carried out at 873 K with 15 pulses of 10% C2H6/N2 via a 1-mL gas loop (423 K). The in situ XRD measurement was performed at Beamline 17-BM of Advanced Photon Source (APS) at Argonne National Laboratory (ANL). For each experiment, 10 mg sample was held at 873 K for 45 min in the presence of reactants (2.5 mL/min C2H6, 2.5 mL/min CO2, and 5.0 mL/min He).
The in situ XAS experiments were performed at Beamline 9-BM of APS at
ANL. Two sets of X-ray absorption fine structure (XAFS) spectra were ac-
quired for each sample: reduction in a H2/He flow at 723 K and reaction in a C2H6/CO2/He flow at 873 K. The STEM-EELS analysis for the spent Ni3Fe1/CeO2 and Ni1Fe3/CeO2 samples was executed on a Hitachi 2700C STEM with a probe aberration corrector operated at 200 kV. EELS data were collected using the Gatan Enfina spectrometer.
Spin-polarized DFT calculations were performed using Vienna Ab Initio Simulation Package (VASP) code. The Ni(111) surface was modeled using a four-layer 3 × 3 surface slab. The bulk-terminated Ni3Fe(111) surface was modeled using a four-layer 4 × 4 surface slab to represent Ni-rich NiFe alloy in experiments. The bulk-terminated Ni3Fe(111) surface was cleaved using an L12-Ni3Fe cubic crystal structure. The Ni-terminated-Ni3Fe(111) surface obtained by replacing surface layer of bulk-terminated-Ni3Fe(111) with Ni atoms was modeled to represent a NiFe alloy with dilute Fe content. The FeOx/Ni(111) interface was modeled by depositing a small Fe3O3 cluster on a three-layer 7 × 7 Ni(111) surface. The various possible adsorption sites shown in SI Appendix, Fig. S23 were considered during the calculations of binding energies. The transition state of a chemical reaction was located using the climbing image nudged elastic band method implemented in VASP.
