Molybdenum Carbide as Alternative Catalysts to Precious Metals for Highly Selective Reduction of CO2 to CO Graphical Abstract Active, selective, and cheap: Mo2C and cobalt-modified Mo2C were both shown to be effective catalysts for CO2 conversion by hydrogen in flow reactor experiments over powder catalysts. In-situ XANES measurements verified that Mo2C can undergo an oxidation-carburization cycle. Modifying Mo2C with small amounts of cobalt further improved catalytic performance.
Abstract Rising atmospheric CO2 is expected to have negative effects on the global environment from its role in climate change and ocean acidification. Utilizing CO2 as a feedstock to make valuable chemicals is potentially more desirable than sequestration. A substantial reduction of CO2 levels requires a large-scale CO2 catalytic conversion process, which in turn requires the discovery of low-cost catalysts. Results from the current study demonstrate the feasibility of using the non-precious metal material molybdenum carbide (Mo2C) as an active and selective catalyst for CO2 conversion by H2.
To sustain future population and economic growth, the global energy supply is expected to increase by 60% by 2040,1 but the associated CO2 emissions are a major concern. CO2 capture and conversion must become a significant industry to mitigate the threat of climate change and ocean acidification.2,3 Efforts have already been put forth to capture and sequester CO2;4,5 however, a process that can efficiently convert CO2 into a commodity chemical has the potential to provide a better solution compared to sequestration.6,7 One attractive route is converting CO2 into CO, which can be used as feedstock in the FischerTropsch process, a well known and well characterized route that has been used in industry to produce chemicals and synthetic fuels from syngas (CO + H2) for many decades.
Precious metals are the most commonly used catalysts for CO2 conversion by H2.8,9 It is generally accepted that catalytic conversion of CO2 by H2 occurs over precious metal catalysts in two principle steps.10 First, metal sites facilitate the dissociation of molecular hydrogen and the hydrogenation of CO2 into formate,11 then the oxide support assists with the cleavage of the CO bond. Therefore, this reaction requires a dual functional catalyst that exhibits high activity for both hydrogen dissociation and CO bond scission. It has been previously shown12 that platinum (Pt) based catalysts supported on CeO2, a reducible oxide, were more active for CO2 conversion than those supported on γ-Al2O3, an irreducible oxide.13 However, in an effort to reduce material costs for CO2 conversion, it is important to minimize or eliminate precious metals in catalysts. This is particularly important for large-scale processes that would be required to substantially reduce CO2 emissions.
Transition metal carbides (TMCs) are attractive alternatives because they have similar properties to precious metal catalysts in reforming,14,15 hydrogenation,16 water-gas shift (WGS),17,18 and CO oxidation19,20 reactions. The high activity of TMCs compared with their parent metals originates from a modification of the electronic properties from the addition of carbon,21 which in turn affects the binding energy and the reactivity of adsorbates.22 Mo2C is particularly interesting for CO2 conversion because of its low cost, dual functionality for H2 dissociation and CO bond scission, and potential to behave similarly to reducible oxides.
In CO2 conversion by H2, CO is a desired product for its ability to be used in the FischerTropsch process, while CH4 is undesired because of its low volumetric energy density and abundance.23 Thus, modifying Mo2C with a metal that can dissociate the unwanted product, CH4, and thereby recarburize the catalyst to maintain its active, carbidic form is highly desirable. Here, we first investigate CO2 activation over well-defined Mo2C surfaces with temperature-programmed surface reaction (TPSR) and ambient-pressure X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (AP-XPS) experiments to confirm the active nature of the Mo2C surface toward CO2 conversion to CO. Then, model surface results are extended to flow reactor experiments over porous Mo2C catalysts, and further explained by in-situ X-ray absorption near edge spectroscopy (XANES) experiments. The findings show that Mo2C outperforms precious metal bimetallic catalysts and is highly active and selective for CO2 conversion to CO. The activity, selectivity and stability of Mo2C can be further improved by modifying the carbide with another metal, cobalt (Co).
The TPSR experiments over a Mo2C model surface, prepared by carburizing a single-crystal Mo(110) substrate, were conducted using the AP-XPS system at Brookhaven National Laboratory. The TPSR for CO2 hydrogenation was conducted under 100mTorr CO2 and 700mTorr H2. Five gas-phase species, m/e=44 (CO2), 31 (methanol), 28 (CO), 18 (H2O) and 15 (CH4), were recorded while the sample was heated to 523K and then cooled to 373K. TPSR results for CO2 (m/e=44) in Figure1a show that Mo2C/Mo(110) is much more active for CO2 activation than MoOx/Mo(110). Figure1b shows the production of CO (m/e=28) from the two surfaces. Comparison of other products is shown in FigureS2 in the Supporting Information. Neither CH4 (m/e=15) nor methanol (m/e=31) was detected. Thus, the Mo2C surface is highly selective in converting CO2 to CO.

AP-XPS investigations of the Mo2C/Mo(110) surface under CO2 reduction by H2 conditions were performed to identify possible surface reaction intermediates. Figure2 shows the C1s and O1s regions of surface species on Mo2C/Mo(110) under near-ambient pressures. As seen in Figure2a-1, evidence for the formation of carbide is shown by the appearance of the C1s peak at 282.9eV, consistent with the reported value of 282.8eV.24 The O1s peak at 530.4eV is attributed to the presence of small amounts (ca. 10%) of unreduced MoOx on the surface. After exposing the surface to 150mTorr CO2, the C1s and O1s peaks of gas-phase CO2 appear at 292.0 and 537.3eV, respectively. A small peak at 283.6eV is assigned to oxycarbide (O-Mo-C), in agreement with the reported value of 283.5eV for molybdenum oxycarbide powder catalysts.24 The O1s of oxygen-modified Mo2C, with the oxygen bonded to carbon, appears at 531.7eV.15 TableS1 in the Supporting Information summarizes the binding energies for both C1s and O1s peaks.

After reaction at 523K, both C1s and O1s peaks of gas-phase CO2 are significantly reduced, corresponding to the consumption of CO2 by reaction. Meanwhile, the C1s peak at 283.6eV and O1s peak at 531.7eV increase in intensity, indicating higher coverage of surface oxycarbide after reaction. Figure2a-4 and b-4 show the AP-XPS results during reaction at 523K. Under reaction conditions, the major surface species are oxycarbides, indicating the presence of oxygen atoms on the Mo2C surface during CO2 reaction contributes to the catalytic activity. Previous studies over oxide-supported metal catalysts have proposed carbonate (CO3), carboxyl (CO2δ) and formate (HCOO) as the reaction intermediates for CO2 activation.2527 These surface intermediates have been identified by AP-XPS on Cu and CeOx/Cu(111) surfaces after exposing CO2 at ambient pressure, with intense C1s peaks for CO3, CO2δ and HCOO located at 289.3, 288.4 and 287.3eV, respectively.24 In comparison, the AP-XPS measurements on Mo2C in Figure2 do not show evidence supporting the presence of these intermediates, suggesting a different reaction mechanism for CO2 activation on Mo2C. One potential pathway is the direct reaction of CO2 with Mo2C to produce CO and oxycarbide (Mo2C-O), with Mo2C-O being subsequently reduced by hydrogen to produce H2O and Mo2C. This is consistent with the detection of H2O in the TPSR experiments in FigureS2 and with previous studies of steady-state H2O production from the hydrodeoxygenation of C3 oxygenates over Mo2C.28 Further studies in a flow reactor at 573K over Mo2C powder catalysts were carried out to verify the trends seen in the idealized model surfaces. Several precious metal based bimetallic catalysts, demonstrated previously in a batch reactor to be more active for CO2 conversion than monometallic Pt or Pd,12 were also evaluated as references. Experimental information regarding reactor studies and the synthesis and characterization of the catalysts can be found in the Supporting Information. Steady-state reactor results in Figure3a show that the turnover frequency (TOF) on CeO2-supported catalysts follows the trend of Pt-Co > Pt-Ni  Pd-Co > Pd-Ni. The conversion of each of the bimetallic catalysts, including monometallic Ni and Co can be found in FigureS7. Although bimetallic catalysts are active for CO2 reduction, Figure3 indicates that Mo2C clearly outperforms them in both activity and selectivity. Specific values for TOF and CO:CH4 ratio are shown in Table1. The higher activity of Mo2C may originate from its direct participation in the reaction through facile oxygen transfer. Upon CO2 dissociation, an oxygen atom is incorporated into Mo2C, forming an oxycarbide that can be subsequently reduced by H2. This process of oxygen transfer is analogous to the role of the reducible oxide in CeO2-supported bimetallic catalysts.12 Figure 3 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint a)TOF and b)selectivity at 573K on bimetallic supported catalysts on CeO2 (black bars) and Mo2C (dashed line).

Figure3 shows that bimetallic catalysts containing Co outperform their Ni containing counterparts. Therefore, by combining Co with the highly active Mo2C catalyst, it is possible to further improve the catalytic performance of Mo2C. As shown in Table1, the addition of 7.5wt% Co to Mo2C leads to an increase in conversion from 8.7 to 9.5% while the CO:CH4 ratio improves from 15 to 51.
In a study by Izhar etal., Co-Mo2C catalysts dissociate CH4 into H2 and C, with amorphous CoMoCyOz being identified as the critical active phase that dissociates CH4.29 In the current study, the ability of Co-Mo2C to dissociate CH4 is most likely responsible for improving the CO:CH4 selectivity by reacting with the CH4 product or CHx intermediate that leads to CH4 formation.
Further evidence of the effect of Co on Mo2C for CO2 conversion is shown as a function of Co loading in FigureS8. The 7.5wt% Co-Mo2C was identified as the optimal catalyst investigated in this study, and stability measurements in a flow reactor were conducted to measure the steady-state conversion and CO:CH4 ratio of the catalyst. After 36h on stream, Co-Mo2C showed improved activity, selectivity, and stability over Mo2C. The activity and selectivity of Co-Mo2C were higher than Mo2C initially and did not decrease over the course of the reaction. FigureS9 contains the comparison of steady-state results of Co-Mo2C and Mo2C.
The improved performance of Co-Mo2C over Mo2C was likely because the active phase of the catalyst, Mo2C, was maintained in a carburized state during the reaction, as confirmed by in-situ XANES measurements. Evidence of recarburization of Mo2C is provided in the Mo2C/MoO3 linear fits from XANES spectra of Mo2C in Table2, with selected spectra shown in Figure4a. The results in Table2 indicate that a fraction of Mo in Mo2C can be cycled between reduced and oxidized states. The Mo2C catalyst cycles between 92.7% Mo2C/7.3% MoO3 under reduction conditions, then forms a greater amount of oxidized species, likely oxycarbide, when exposed to pure CO2. With the addition of H2 to the CO2 stream at 573K, some of the oxycarbide is reduced, but the catalyst is not restored to the initial reduced state.

In-situ XANES measurements were also performed on the 7.5wt% Co-Mo2C catalyst to determine the effect of Co on the oxidation/recarburization cycle. The composition, according to the linear combination fit of the fresh 7.5wt% Co-Mo2C catalyst was found to be 29.0% Mo2C/71.0% MoO3, a much higher degree of oxidation than the pure Mo2C (Figure4b). After further treatments in H2, CO2, and CO2/H2, the catalyst could no longer be successfully fit by linear combination fit analysis. It is likely that after reduction, a CoMoCyOz phase formed, which would explain the inability of a combination of Mo2C and MoO3 to accurately represent the catalyst.
Additionally, as seen in Figure4b, the Mo K-edge of the Co-Mo2C catalyst is virtually unchanged from reduction in H2 to treatment in CO2 at 573K. This lack of change in the oxidation state of Mo in Co-Mo2C is a distinct difference from the pure Mo2C catalyst in Figure4a. To confirm existence of the CoMoCyOz phase, XRD measurements were performed on Mo2C and Co-Mo2C. The XRD results, found in the Supporting Information, indicate a change in the structure of Co-Mo2C upon reduction and the formation of the CoMoCyOz phase. Together, the XANES and XRD observations indicate that a highly stable CoMoCyOz phase is formed, which is most likely responsible for the enhanced catalytic performance for CO2 conversion.
In summary, our findings clearly show that Mo2C is an active catalyst for CO2 conversion by H2, while modifying the catalyst with Co forms a complex with Mo2C that further improves the activity, selectivity and stability of the catalyst. The active phase of Mo2C is primarily the carbide phase, as shown by TPSR experiments, but the oxide is generally present throughout the reaction, as indicated by AP-XPS and XANES experiments. The ability of Mo2C to break the CO bond, as well as to dissociate hydrogen to either perform hydrogenation of CO2 or remove oxygen from Mo2C-O, makes it dual functional and ideal for CO2 activation. Furthermore, because Mo2C is made from much more abundant elements than precious metals, the catalyst can be manufactured at much lower cost, which is critical for achieving a substantial reduction of CO2 levels by large-scale CO2 catalytic conversion processes. Furthermore, the reduction of CO2 also requires parallel advancement in the development of low-cost processes for CO2-free H2 production, such as in electrolysis or photoelectrochemical conversion of H2O.
Experimental Section AP-XPS and TPSR experiments were performed by oxidizing a Mo(110) surface under 1×106Torr O2 at 700K for 15min to form MoOx. The Mo2C was prepared by a procedure previously described30 by exposing Mo(110) to 5×107Torr C2H4 at 700K followed by annealing to 1000K. After preparation, the sample was moved to the entrance of the XPS analyzer and a total of 800mTorr gases (100mTorr CO2 and 700mTorr H2) were leaked into the main chamber at 300K. Then, the sample was heated to 523K. After reaction, the sample was cooled in the CO2/H2 gas mixture. The reaction products (intensities of ions with m/e of 44, 31, 28, 18 and 15) were recorded with time. The surface species were examined by AP-XPS. The O1s and C1s peaks were measured under the photon energy of 706eV and 538eV, respectively. All of the reported binding energies were calibrated by the Au4f7/2 peak of a gold foil at 84.0eV.
Monometallic and bimetallic catalysts were synthesized by incipient wetness impregnation over as-is commercially obtained CeO2 (3545m2g1, cubic, SigmaAldrich) support. Mo2C was synthesized in a procedure adapted from Shi etal.31 BET analysis showed that the synthesized Mo2C had a surface area of ca. 24.5m2g1. Cobalt metal was impregnated onto the Mo2C through evaporation-deposition of Co(NO3)26H2O (Alfa Aesar). Pulse CO chemisorption was performed using an AMI-200ip (Altamira) to compare the number of active sites in each Co-Mo2C catalyst.
EXAFS measurements were used to confirm the structure of Mo2C, while XANES measurements confirmed the oxidation state of Mo2C. Mo K-edge spectra were recorded for Mo2C and 7.5wt% Co-Mo2C under the same procedure in a custom designed, in-situ glassy carbon cell. Initial spectra were recorded at room temperature and after reduction in H2 and He at 723K. Following reduction, the sample was treated with a CO2 and H2 gas mixture, then pure CO2. During each gas treatment, the glassy carbon cell was heated at 573K for 90min, and then cooled to room temperature before XANES spectra were collected. The spectra from each treatment condition was fitted by a linear combination of MoO3 and Mo2C standards.
Reactor studies of powder catalysts were carried out in a quartz U-tube reactor under atmospheric pressure. In each experiment, approximately 100mg catalyst (6080 mesh) was loaded into the flow reactor. Prior to reaction, the catalyst was reduced under a 1:1 hydrogen and helium mixture (50mLmin1 total flow) at 723K for 1h. For each reaction, CO2 and hydrogen were set at 20mLmin1 and 40mLmin1, respectively. For each experiment, the temperature was ramped to 573K and held steady for approximately 8h. In the case of stability studies, the temperature was held constant for 36h. Product streams were analyzed by online gas chromatography equipped with a flame ionization detector (FID) and thermal conductivity detector (TCD). The concentration of each gas-phase species was calibrated by correlating the peak area of the pure compound to its concentration in a standard calibration gas.
