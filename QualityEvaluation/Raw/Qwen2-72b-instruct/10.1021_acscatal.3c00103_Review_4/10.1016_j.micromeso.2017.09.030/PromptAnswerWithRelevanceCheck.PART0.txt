Read the questions and answers provided below. First, critically assess the overall relevance of the answers provided to the set of questions asked.

If, upon your assessment, you find that the answers do not contain information that is relevant to the questions asked, stop your review process immediately and respond with a single sentence: "※※※※※※※The provided answers are not relevant to the questions.※※※※※※※". Do not provide any additional explanation or background information, only this sentence should be given as a response in case of irrelevant answers.

If, however, the answers are relevant to the questions asked, proceed to compile answers for each question according to the instructions below. Ensure to aggregate all the relevant answers from the multiple answer results provided in the document, and organize them sequentially by their order number, compiling the corresponding quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question.

If the provided answers' quotes are not differentiated by question, ensure to break them down and assign the quotes to each respective question, outputting them separately within each question's section.

To provide a comprehensive review, differentiate the responses into quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question based on the details given in the 'Answer' XML tags. Structure your review using the XML format showcased below if the answers are relevant to the questions asked:

1.The document does not provide specific information on how the physicochemical properties of catalysts influence their performance in dehydrogenation reactions or strategies for support modification to optimize these properties. However, it does mention that hierarchical zeolites, due to their combination of catalytic properties of conventional zeolites with enhanced access and transport of reagents in additional meso- or microporosity, can increase reaction rates and catalyst life-time. This is achieved by allowing molecules of substrates to access the active sites located within micropores and reducing the catalysts, leading to faster deactivation removal time of product molecules. Besides, secondary porosity of hierarchical zeolites creates an ideal space for deposition of active catalytic phases controlling their size and allows attaining high dispersion and strong interaction between zeolite and the medium.

1.文档没有提供催化剂的物理化学性质如何影响其在脱氢反应中的性能，或支持修改策略以优化这些性质的具体信息。但是，它确实提到，由于层次状沸石结合了传统沸石的催化性质和在额外的中孔或微孔中增强试剂的接触和传输，可以提高反应速率和催化剂的寿命。这是通过允许底物分子进入位于微孔内的活性位点并减少催化剂，从而加快产物分子的失活去除时间来实现的。此外，层次状沸石的次级孔隙性为活性催化相的沉积创造了一个理想的空间，控制了它们的大小，并允许获得沸石和介质之间的高分散性和强相互作用。
