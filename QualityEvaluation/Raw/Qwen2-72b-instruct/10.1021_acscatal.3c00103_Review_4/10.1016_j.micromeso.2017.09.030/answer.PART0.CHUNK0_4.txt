1.The document does not provide specific information on how the physicochemical properties of catalysts influence their performance in dehydrogenation reactions or strategies for support modification to optimize these properties. However, it does mention that hierarchical zeolites, due to their combination of catalytic properties of conventional zeolites with enhanced access and transport of reagents in additional meso- or microporosity, can increase reaction rates and catalyst life-time. This is achieved by allowing molecules of substrates to access the active sites located within micropores and reducing the catalysts, leading to faster deactivation removal time of product molecules. Besides, secondary porosity of hierarchical zeolites creates an ideal space for deposition of active catalytic phases controlling their size and allows attaining high dispersion and strong interaction between zeolite and the medium.

1.文档没有提供催化剂的物理化学性质如何影响其在脱氢反应中的性能，或支持修改策略以优化这些性质的具体信息。但是，它确实提到，由于层次状沸石结合了传统沸石的催化性质和在额外的中孔或微孔中增强试剂的接触和传输，可以提高反应速率和催化剂的寿命。这是通过允许底物分子进入位于微孔内的活性位点并减少催化剂，从而加快产物分子的失活去除时间来实现的。此外，层次状沸石的次级孔隙性为活性催化相的沉积创造了一个理想的空间，控制了它们的大小，并允许获得沸石和介质之间的高分散性和强相互作用。
