[1] "Although the equilibrium conversion of alkanes increases with temperature, alkene selectivity decreases with increasing temperature and chain length due to an increased tendency toward dehydrocyclization/aromatisation, thermal cracking and coke formation."
[2] "The extent of PtSn interactions depends on the impregnation sequence of Pt and Sn precursors on the support material."
[3] "The alkali promoter can also influence the nature of the Cr species present on the catalyst surface."
[4] "The framework of microporous zeolites exerts dispersive forces on the reactant's molecules that depend on the shape, channel and cavity of the framework."
[5] "The nature and the density of the active sites influence the framework dispersion forces."
[6] "Recent reports have shown that the strong electrostatic field between protons or exchanged metal ions and basic oxygen species can enhance and/or induce polarization of bonds in hydrocarbon adsorbates."
[7] "This agrees with Hashiguchi et al. [26] , who found enhanced activation of the CH bond on a homogeneous catalyst."
[8] "Wender et al. [27] showed that 3040% of heat adsorption in n-alkanes on Na-zeolite is due to polarization of the adsorbates."
[9] "Subbotina et al. [28] also demonstrated that the CH bond of ethane is more strongly polarized on Mg2 + and Ca2 + forms of Y zeolite than on Na+ forms."
[10] "Based on charge density considerations, Mg2 + cations are expected to exhibit a stronger polarizing effect than Ca2 + cations."
[11] "Subbotina et al. explain that because of the smaller ionic radius of Mg2 +, it is more strongly shielded by the surrounding oxygen atoms of the zeolite lattice than a Ca2 + ion, thereby reducing the polarizing effect of Mg2 + on the hydrocarbon adsorbate."
[12] "Sievers et al. [29] ,[30] also report that the La3 + form of X zeolite induces strong polarization of adsorbed alkane molecules; partial positive charges were induced on secondary and tertiary carbon atoms of alkane molecules."
[13] "The authors suggest that the polarization may be viewed as an intermediate condition to hydride abstraction (which is an important elementary step in CH activation)."
[14] "They add that CH bond polarization was enhanced by physisorbed water molecules that coordinate with La3 + cations."
[15] "The enhanced polarization of CH bonds by the presence of water molecules on La3 +X zeolite may have a beneficial effect in oxidative dehydrogenation where water is a by-product."
[16] "Alkane polarization studies on Na+, Mg2 +, Ca2 +, and La3 + exchanged X-zeolites indicate that the polarizing effect increases with increasing charge magnitude and ionic radius."
[17] "Note that these alkane polarizing cations occupy the same position on the zeolites as the well-known CH activation cations/metals, and thus the CH polarizing effect has a complementary effect on CH activation."
[18] "This may add to the number of relevant variables and increase the challenge of optimizing the ratio of activation/polarizing cations among exchangeable sites (Si/Al ratio), as well as the sequence for incorporating the cations or metals during catalyst preparation."
[19] "Further, it is important to note that the choice of cations should be such that they exhibit no catalytic (oligomerization, isomerization, aromatisation or oxidation) effects on the target alkene products at the reaction condition."
[20] "Furthermore, it may be beneficial to create a CH polarization effect on the zeolite framework."
[21] "This can be achieved by appropriate chance of framework atoms."
[22] "Since active sites are usually created on the zeolite frameworks."
[23] "The unimolecular mechanism involves direct protonation of an alkane-forming carbonium ion intermediate."
[24] "The proton can be inserted into either a CC or CH bond of the alkane."
[25] "Proton insertion through the CC bond leads to cracking of the alkane, with the acid site regenerated."
[26] "Insertion through the HC bond yields H2 and a carbenium ion/alkoxide intermediate."
[27] "Desorption of alkene from the intermediate regenerates the acid, or the alkoxide can enter the bimolecular conversion path."
[28] "In the bimolecular mechanism of CH activation, the alkoxide intermediate constitutes the active sites and CH activation occurs through hydride transfer from a second alkane molecule forming another alkoxide."
[29] "This may be followed by βscission to regenerate the active site and complete the catalytic cycle."
[30] "For example, activation of propane on acid zeolite based on the two mechanisms is illustrated in Scheme 1 ."
[31] "Low reactant partial pressure and high temperature favor unimolecular dehydrogenation of alkane on acid zeolite."
[32] "These conditions favor the endothermic desorption step (rate limiting step) leading to propene."
[33] "In contrast, high partial pressure and low temperature favor the bimolecular mechanism leading to a low propene yield."
[34] "The two molecular mechanisms devoid of side reactions give fairly predictable product distribution."
[35] "However, the products of each route are prone to side reactions (dimerization, oligomerization, isomerization & aromatisation) in the presence of Bronsted acid sites."
[36] "Hence propene selectivity on acidic zeolite is very low and products rich in aromatics are usually obtained [43] ."
[37] "The active sites (alkoxide intermediate) of the bimolecular pathway are formed in situ ( Scheme 1 )."
[38] "The alkoxide intermediate is made up of an alkyl carbenium ion ionically held to the zeolite framework oxygen ion."
[39] "The active sites of the unimolecular pathway are the charge balancing protons of the zeolite framework."
[40] "A proton and a carbenium ion are an electrophilic or Lewis acid species (a proton can also be considered as a special case of Lewis acidity)."
[41] "The two pathways essentially involve electrophilic CH activation."
[42] "The electrophiles (proton and carbenium ion) activate CH at high temperatures (500 C), giving low conversion rates of light alkanes and poor selectivity to corresponding alkenes."
[43] "The above proposition has been demonstrated on metal (e.g., Ga, Zn, and Co) exchanged zeolites."
[44] "The specific role of the exchanged metals has been the subject of several reports with special attention on Ga and Zn."
[45] "Although the framework Ga2O3 on H-MFI seems to have a CH polarization effect on desorbed methane, Ga2O3 exhibits lower CH activation activity [48] and the physical mixture of Ga2O3/HMFI displays higher propane aromatisation activity than pure H-MFI."
[46] "Similar synergistic effects have been reported for Zn/H-MFI and Co/H-MFI [49] ,[50] ,[51] ."
[47] "Exchanged cations behave as monomeric species at the exchange sites of zeolite."
[48] "Iglesia and Biscardi [49] hypothesized that the monomeric species enhance propane conversion by promoting re-combinative desorption (RD) of the H-adatom formed from the CH cleavage."
[49] "It is worthwhile noting that the exchange cations (electrophilic species) constitute the CH activation sites [52] ."
[50] "Hence, more insights are required about their additional role in promoting RD."
[51] "However, the authors did not provide further information on the nature of the H-adatoms and the mechanism of RD."
[52] "The exchanged metal ions in zeolites are held ionically by one or more basic oxygen atoms."
[53] "Different species have been suggested, depending on the density of the cation exchange site of the zeolite and method of introduction of the metals."
[54] "According to Kanansky et al."
[55] "Zn and Ga are introduced on H-ZSM-5 through a vapor deposition technique using Zn metal vapor and Ga(CH3)3 as the source of Zn and Ga, respectively."
[56] "The metal introduction technique allows quantitative exchange of the zeolite protons which leads to Zn/Al = 0.5 and Ga/Al = 1, respectively."
[57] "Zn2 + is generated directly, but Ga+ is produced by H2 treatment at 500 C to release the methyl groups."
[58] "The proposed active sites are OZn2+O and OGa+, respectively."
[59] "The mechanism of CH activation with ethane by the two sites under the same reaction conditions are summarized in Scheme 2 ."
[60] "The proposed mechanism is in agreement with the mechanism suggested from calculations using the GAUSSIAN 94 program for ethane activation on Zn-exchanged zeolite by Frash and van Santen [54] ."
[61] "In another theoretical study using a DFT cluster modeling approach, Pidko and van Santen [55] compared the activation energy of CH with three types of Zn species at active sites: OZn2+O, OZn+OZn+O and HOZn+ O."
[62] "The authors suggest that the reaction proceeds most easily on OZn2+O, and hypothesize that the enhanced Lewis activity of OZn2+O facilitates CH heterolytic cleavage."
[63] "They further argue that the first proton abstraction occurs preferentially on the oxygen sites neighboring the ring where the cation is located."
[64] "They proposed a one-step reaction to yield H2 and C2H4 from the decomposition of the Zn-alkyl and proton."
[65] "A proposed mechanism of CH activation on OGa+ has similarly been suggested using theoretical calculations [56] ."
[66] "High alkene selectivities are obtained on the H-ZSM-5 when exchangeable protons are rigorously replaced by Zn and Ga."
[67] "The Zn-exchanged H-ZSM-5 had higher ethane conversion rates but lower ethene selectivity than its Ga counterpart [53] ."
[68] "The CH activation on the OZn2+O site can be described by a Lewis base-assisted deprotonation mechanism."
[69] "This is accompanied by conversion of the Lewis base site to a conjugate Bronsted acid site."
[70] "The OGa+ site, however, activates the CH bond via oxidative addition without a protonic site intermediate [57] ."
[71] "A protonic site intermediate increases tendency of side reactions on the Zn-exchanged H-ZSM-5 relative to the Ga counterpart."
[72] "The elementary steps of CH activation on OGa+ ( Scheme 2 ) reveal that a redox cycle at the metal center is required for catalytic CH activation via the oxidative addition mechanism."
[73] "A redox cycle is not apparent in the elementary step presented for CH activation on OZn2+O."
[74] "Hence, a redox cycle is not a requisite for CH activation via the Lewis base-assisted deprotonation mechanism."
[75] "However, under alkane dehydrogenation reaction conditions, the OZn2+O sites can undergo a reversible Zn2 +/Zn redox process ( Scheme 3 ) [58] ."
[76] "This redox process increases the availability of undesired protonic site intermediates."
[77] "Zn-exchanged H-ZSM-5 prepared by conventional ion-exchange methods contain a significant percentage of unexchanged proton sites leading to lower alkene selectivity of the catalyst."
[78] "Iglesia and Biscardi [59] titrate the proton sites with NaOH."
[79] "The un-titrated and the titrated catalysts are denoted as Zn/H-ZSMS-5 and Zn/Na-ZSMS-5, respectively."
[80] "Zn/Na-ZSM-5 has four times the propane conversion rate and a higher propene selectivity than Zn/H-ZSMS-5."
[81] "The propene formation rate obtained with Zn/Na-ZSM-5 was ten times that of Zn/H-ZSMS-5."
[82] "The zinc species at the cation exchange site of the zeolite was identified as OZn+OH."
[83] "The higher propene selectivity obtained on Zn/Na-ZSM-5 compared to Zn/H-ZSMS-5 is presumably from the lower density and availability of proton sites on Zn/Na-ZSM-5."
[84] "The improved propane conversion rate of Zn/Na-ZSM-5 compared to Zn/H-ZSM-5 is attributable to the higher efficiency of OZn+OH sites in catalyzing desorption of H-adatoms than OZn2+O sites."
[85] "Another strategy to enhance alkene selectivity is by controlling the strength of the proton sites."
[86] "The acidity of the sites depends on the nature of the trivalent cation of the zeolite framework."
[87] "Proton sites in borosilicate zeolites are weaker than those of aluminosilicate [60] ,[61] ,[62] ,[63] ,[64] , and thus higher alkene selectivity is expected for alkane dehydrogenation over Zn/H[B]-ZSM-5 compared to Zn/H[Al]-ZSM-5."
[88] "However, Zn/H[B]-ZSM-5 shows no activity for propane dehydrogenation."
[89] "The desired weaker acidity of the proton sites of Zn/H[B]-ZSM-5 requires weaker basicity of the oxygen atoms in the zeolite framework."
[90] "This reduced basicity of the oxygen atoms is not sufficiently polarizing to complement the exchanged Zn2 + in CH bond cleavage."
[91] "In the next section, we examine use of zeolite support to design a Pt-based alkane dehydrogenation catalyst."
[92] "Elimination of the proton sites of zeolites is critical for obtaining a high alkene selectivity and stability in dehydrogenation catalysts."
[93] "Pt is the most versatile noble metal catalyst for alkane reactions [65] ."
[94] "Although Pt is expensive, the choice of Pt is often justified by its higher activity, stability and selectivity for these reactions compared to less expensive alternative transition metals."
[95] "However, rapid catalyst deactivation due to coke formation remains a challenge even when using a Pt-based catalyst for dehydrogenation of light alkanes."
[96] "Waku et al."
[97] "[66] exploited the unique property of zeolite as a support for achieving high metal dispersion through cation exchange sites to create a Pt/Na[Fe]-ZSM-5 catalyst with outstanding stability for dehydrogenation of light alkanes."
[98] "They found that the catalyst deactivation rate of Pt/Na[Fe]-ZSM-5 was lower than for any other Pt-based catalysts in refractory oxide support."
[99] "The unprecedented performance of Pt/Na[Fe]-ZSM-5 was attributed to its high Pt dispersion (cluster size < 1 mm) on zeolite through ion-exchange."
[100] "There is a tendency to generate some Brnsted protons on the zeolite during the exchange process, but the choice of Fe3 + as an isomorphous cation in place of Al3 + led to weaker Brnsted sites in [Fe]-ZSM compared to [Al]-ZSM."
[101] "The weaker acidity minimizes the tendency of side reactions (cracking of oligomerization, aromatisation, and coke), which translates into higher alkene selectivity and catalyst stability."
[102] "In another report, Xuebing and Iglesia [67] demonstrated the ability of Pt/Na[Fe]-ZSM-5 to dehydrogenate alkanes longer than C4; n-pentane and n-heptane were selectively converted to n-pentene and n-heptene, respectively."
[103] "Alkene selectivity was also improved when the residual proton generated during Pt exchange or Na-[Fe]-ZSM was titrated with Cs [67] ."
[104] "Although Pt with conventional refractory oxides (Al2O3, SiO2, ZrO2, etc.) used for dehydrogenation of alkanes has similar conversion rates to Pt/Na[Fe]-ZSM-5, deactivation rates are also rapid due to coke formation."
[105] "The presence of acid (Bronsted and Lewis) sites on the supports promotes readsorption, oligomerization and aromatisation of alkenes."
[106] "Promotion of Pt with metals, such as Sn, Ga, Zn, Re, etc., improves catalyst stability, but also leads to faster deactivation rates than Pt/Na[Fe]-ZSM-5."
[107] "However, recent reports by Bell et al."
[108] "[68] ,[69] ,[70] show that the use of calcined hydrotalcite (Al/Mg  0.1) supported on bimetallic PtGa or PtSn gave very high alkene selectivity and stability, comparable to Pt/Na[Fe]-ZSM-5."

1.The physicochemical properties of catalysts, including chemical qualities (such as acid strength and stability) and morphological characteristics, significantly influence their performance in dehydrogenation reactions. The equilibrium conversion of alkanes increases with temperature, but alkene selectivity decreases due to dehydrocyclization/aromatisation, thermal cracking, and coke formation. The extent of PtSn interactions and the impregnation sequence of Pt and Sn precursors on the support material affect the catalytic efficiency. The alkali promoter influences the nature of the Cr species present on the catalyst surface. The framework of microporous zeolites exerts dispersive forces on reactant molecules, depending on the shape, channel, and cavity of the framework. The nature and density of the active sites influence the framework dispersion forces. Protons or exchanged metal ions and basic oxygen species can enhance and/or induce polarization of bonds in hydrocarbon adsorbates. The polarizing effect increases with increasing charge magnitude and ionic radius. The choice of cations should not exhibit catalytic effects on the target alkene products at the reaction condition. Creating a CH polarization effect on the zeolite framework can be achieved by changing framework atoms. The unimolecular mechanism involves direct protonation of an alkane-forming carbonium ion intermediate, while the bimolecular mechanism involves hydride transfer from a second alkane molecule forming another alkoxide. Low reactant partial pressure and high temperature favor unimolecular dehydrogenation, while high partial pressure and low temperature favor the bimolecular mechanism. The products of each route are prone to side reactions in the presence of Bronsted acid sites, leading to low propene selectivity.

Zn-exchanged H-ZSM-5 prepared by conventional ion-exchange methods contain unexchanged proton sites leading to lower alkene selectivity. The zinc species at the cation exchange site of the zeolite was identified as OZn+OH. The higher propene selectivity obtained on Zn/Na-ZSM-5 compared to Zn/H-ZSMS-5 is from the lower density and availability of proton sites. The improved propane conversion rate of Zn/Na-ZSM-5 compared to Zn/H-ZSM-5 is attributable to the higher efficiency of OZn+OH sites in catalyzing desorption of H-adatoms than OZn2+O sites. Another strategy to enhance alkene selectivity is by controlling the strength of the proton sites. Proton sites in borosilicate zeolites are weaker than those of aluminosilicate, and thus higher alkene selectivity is expected for alkane dehydrogenation over Zn/H[B]-ZSM-5 compared to Zn/H[Al]-ZSM-5. Elimination of the proton sites of zeolites is critical for obtaining a high alkene selectivity and stability in dehydrogenation catalysts. Pt is the most versatile noble metal catalyst for alkane reactions, but rapid catalyst deactivation due to coke formation remains a challenge.

1.催化剂的物理化学性质，包括化学性质（如酸强度和稳定性）和形态特征，对脱氢反应的性能有重大影响。随着温度的升高，烷烃的平衡转化率增加，但由于脱氢环化/芳构化、热裂解和焦炭形成，烯烃的选择性降低。PtSn的相互作用程度和Pt和Sn前体在支撑材料上的浸渍顺序影响催化效率。碱性促进剂影响催化剂表面上Cr物种的性质。微孔沸石框架对反应物分子施加分散力，这取决于框架的形状、通道和腔体。活性位点的性质和密度影响框架分散力。质子或交换金属离子和碱性氧物种可以增强和/或诱导烃吸附物中键的极化。极化效应随电荷大小和离子半径的增加而增加。所选阳离子在反应条件下不应对目标烯烃产品产生催化作用。在沸石框架上创建CH极化效应可以通过改变框架原子来实现。单分子机制涉及直接质子化烷烃形成碳离子中间体，而双分子机制涉及从第二个烷烃分子转移氢化物形成另一个醇。低反应物分压和高温有利于单分子脱氢，而高分压和低温则有利于双分子机制。每种途径的产品在Bronsted酸位点的存在下容易发生副反应，导致丙烯选择性低。交换阳离子（亲电性物种）构成CH活化位点，并通过促进从CH裂解形成的H-原子的重组解吸（RD）来增强丙烷转化。沸石中交换的金属离子通过一个或多个碱性氧原子离子保持，根据沸石的阳离子交换位点密度和金属的引入方法，提出了不同的物种。当可交换质子被Zn和Ga严格取代时，可以获得高烯烃选择性。CH活化在OZn2+O位点可以通过Lewis碱辅助脱质子机制来描述，而OGa+位点通过氧化加成活化CH键，没有质子位点中间体。OZn2+O位点在烷烃脱氢反应条件下可以经历可逆的Zn2+/Zn氧化还原过程。通过常规离子交换方法制备的Zn交换H-ZSM-5含有未交换的质子位点，导致烯烃选择性降低。沸石中阳离子交换位点的锌物种被鉴定为OZn+OH。与Zn/H-ZSMS-5相比，在Zn/Na-ZSM-5上获得的更高丙烯选择性归因于质子位点的较低密度和可用性。与Zn/H-ZSM-5相比，Zn/Na-ZSM-5的丙烷转化率提高可归因于OZn+OH位点催化H-原子解吸的效率高于OZn2+O位点。另一种增强烯烃选择性的策略是控制质子位点的强度。硼硅酸盐沸石中的质子位点比铝硅酸盐弱，因此预计在Zn/H[B]-ZSM-5上烷烃脱氢的烯烃选择性高于Zn/H[Al]-ZSM-5。消除沸石的质子位点对于获得高烯烃选择性和脱氢催化剂的稳定性至关重要。Pt是烷烃反应中最通用的贵金属催化剂，但由于焦炭形成导致的催化剂失活速度加快，仍存在挑战。通过阳离子交换位点实现高金属分散的独特沸石支撑性质可以创建Pt/Na[Fe]-ZSM-5催化剂，用于轻烷烃脱氢的出色稳定性。将Fe3+作为异形阳离子代替Al3+导致[Fe]-ZSM中的Brnsted位点比[Al]-ZSM弱，从而最小化副反应的倾向，并转化为更高的烯烃选择性和催化剂稳定性。
