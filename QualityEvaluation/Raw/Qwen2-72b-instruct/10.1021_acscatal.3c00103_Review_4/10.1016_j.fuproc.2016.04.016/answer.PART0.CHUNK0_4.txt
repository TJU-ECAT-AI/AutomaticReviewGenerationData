1.The physicochemical properties of catalysts, including chemical qualities (such as acid strength and stability) and morphological characteristics, have a significant influence on their performance in dehydrogenation reactions. The equilibrium conversion of alkanes increases with temperature, but alkene selectivity decreases due to an increased tendency toward dehydrocyclization/aromatisation, thermal cracking, and coke formation. The extent of PtSn interactions depends on the impregnation sequence of Pt and Sn precursors on the support material. The elementary steps involved in the dehydrogenation of an alkane over a platinum catalyst are: dissociative adsorption of the alkane into an adsorbed hydrogen atom and alkyl group; elimination of the second hydrogen from the platinum atom bonded alkyl group; followed by desorption of the resulting alkene and recombination of the hydrogen atoms and desorption as a hydrogen molecule. The first and rate-limiting step of alkane dehydrogenation using platinum or chromium oxide-based catalysts involves CH activation. The framework of microporous zeolites exerts dispersive forces on the reactant's molecules that depend on the shape, channel, and cavity of the framework. The polarizing effect increases with increasing charge magnitude and ionic radius. The two pathways essentially involve electrophilic CH activation. The elementary steps of CH activation on OGa+ reveal that a redox cycle at the metal center is required for catalytic CH activation via the oxidative addition mechanism. The presence of acid (Bronsted and Lewis) sites on the supports promotes readsorption, oligomerization, and aromatisation of alkenes. The nature and interaction of vanadium with the support determine the nature of the predominant VOx structure. The reaction order of ODH reactions with respect to alkanes is usually one, or unity. The heats of adsorption of alkenes on acidic sites are higher than those of the corresponding alkanes. The extent of reduction of the VOx phase by an alkane influences alkene selectivity. The concentration of the O2 radicals increases during the reaction. The oxygen species, identified by spectra simulation, reacts partly with C3H8 and almost completely with C3H6 and CO at room temperature. The superior performance of NiOLiCl/SZ is strongly related to the presence and synergy of LiCl with NiO. The proposed mechanism of ODH over the Li/MgO catalyst does not involve removal of the catalyst lattice oxygen species, but instead CH activation leads to the formation of an alkyl radical. The reaction rates on Li/Dy/Mg/O/(Cl) were an order of magnitude greater than that on Li/Dy/Mg/O. The active site is a radical complex of two nucleophilic atoms, each capable of abstracting a hydrogen atom from the substrate. The rational choice of the dopant cation can increase the alkene selectivity of the catalyst. Support modification strategies can be employed to optimize these properties for enhanced catalytic efficiency and selectivity. For example, the choice of support material can influence the dispersion and stability of the active phase, while the modification of the support surface can alter the acidity and basicity, which can affect the adsorption and activation of reactants. Additionally, the modification of the support can also influence the redox properties of the active phase, which can affect the selectivity and activity of the catalyst.

1.催化剂的物理化学性质，包括化学性质（如酸强度和稳定性）和形态特征，对脱氢反应的性能有重大影响。随着温度的升高，烷烃的平衡转化率增加，但由于脱氢环化/芳构化、热裂解和焦炭形成的倾向增加，烯烃的选择性降低。PtSn相互作用的程度取决于Pt和Sn前体在支撑材料上的浸渍顺序。在铂催化剂上脱氢烷烃的基本步骤是：烷烃的解离吸附，形成吸附的氢原子和烷基基团；从与铂原子结合的烷基基团中消除第二个氢；随后是生成的烯烃的解吸和氢原子的重组以及作为氢分子的解吸。使用铂或铬氧化物基催化剂进行烷烃脱氢的首要和速率限制步骤涉及CH活化。微孔沸石框架对反应物分子施加的分散力取决于框架的形状、通道和腔体。极化效应随电荷大小和离子半径的增加而增加。两条途径本质上涉及电荷性CH活化。在OGa+上的CH活化的基本步骤揭示，金属中心的氧化还原循环是通过氧化加成机制进行催化CH活化所必需的。支撑材料上的酸（Bronsted和Lewis）位点的存在促进了烯烃的再吸附、寡聚化和芳构化。钒与支撑材料的性质和相互作用决定了主要VOx结构的性质。关于烷烃的ODH反应的反应级数通常为一，或为单位。烯烃在酸性位点上的吸附热高于相应的烷烃。钒氧化物相由烷烃还原的程度影响烯烃的选择性。O2自由基的浓度在反应过程中增加。通过光谱模拟识别的氧物种在室温下部分与C3H8反应，几乎完全与C3H6和CO反应。NiOLiCl/SZ的优越性能与LiCl与NiO的存在和协同作用密切相关。Li/MgO催化剂上的ODH提出的机制不涉及催化剂晶格氧物种的去除，而是CH活化导致烷基自由基的形成。Li/Dy/Mg/O/(Cl)上的反应速率比Li/Dy/Mg/O上的反应速率高一个数量级。活性位点是一个由两个亲核原子组成的自由基复合物，每个原子都能从底物中提取一个氢原子。合理选择掺杂阳离子可以提高催化剂的烯烃选择性。可以采用支撑材料改性策略来优化这些性质，以提高催化效率和选择性。例如，支撑材料的选择可以影响活性相的分散性和稳定性，而支撑表面的改性可以改变酸性和碱性，这可能影响反应物的吸附和活化。此外，支撑材料的改性也可以影响活性相的氧化还原性质，这可能影响催化剂的选择性和活性。
