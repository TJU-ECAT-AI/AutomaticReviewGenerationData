[1] "The extent of PtSn interactions depends on the impregnation sequence of Pt and Sn precursors on the support material. Co-impregnation will result in greater PtSn interaction than if precursors are impregnated sequentially. Sequential impregnation with tin added first results in a strong interaction with the support material, and the tin-support material interaction can influence the surface acidity of the catalyst."
[2] "The framework of microporous zeolites exerts dispersive forces on the reactant's molecules that depend on the shape, channel and cavity of the framework. In addition, the nature and the density of the active sites influence the framework dispersion forces."
[3] "The active sites (alkoxide intermediate) of the bimolecular pathway are formed in situ ( Scheme 1 ). The alkoxide intermediate is made up of an alkyl carbenium ion ionically held to the zeolite framework oxygen ion."
[4] "The exchanged metal ions in zeolites are held ionically by one or more basic oxygen atoms. Different species have been suggested, depending on the density of the cation exchange site of the zeolite and method of introduction of the metals."
[5] "The mechanism of CH activation on OGa+ has similarly been suggested using theoretical calculations [56] ."
[6] "The higher propene selectivity obtained on Zn/Na-ZSM-5 compared to Zn/H-ZSMS-5 is presumably from the lower density and availability of proton sites on Zn/Na-ZSM-5."
[7] "The acidity of the sites depends on the nature of the trivalent cation of the zeolite framework. Proton sites in borosilicate zeolites are weaker than those of aluminosilicate [60] ,[61] ,[62] ,[63] ,[64] , and thus higher alkene selectivity is expected for alkane dehydrogenation over Zn/H[B]-ZSM-5 compared to Zn/H[Al]-ZSM-5."
[8] "The presence of acid (Bronsted and Lewis) sites on the supports promotes readsorption, oligomerization and aromatisation of alkenes."

1.The extent of PtSn interactions on the support material depends on the impregnation sequence of Pt and Sn precursors. Co-impregnation results in greater PtSn interaction than sequential impregnation. Sequential impregnation with tin added first results in a strong interaction with the support material, which can influence the surface acidity of the catalyst.

1.PtSn在支撑材料上的相互作用程度取决于Pt和Sn前体的浸渍顺序。共浸渍会导致更大的PtSn相互作用，而顺序浸渍时，首先添加锡会导致与支撑材料的强烈相互作用，这可能会影响催化剂的表面酸性。
2.微孔沸石框架对反应物分子施加的分散力取决于框架的形状、通道和空腔。活性位点的性质和密度也会影响框架的分散力。
3.双分子途径的活性位点（醇酸中间体）在原位形成，由与沸石框架氧离子离子结合的烷基卡宾离子组成。
4.沸石中交换的金属离子通过一个或多个碱性氧原子离子结合。根据沸石的阳离子交换位点密度和金属引入方法，提出了不同的物种。
5.CH在OGa+上的活化机制已使用理论计算提出。
6.Zn/Na-ZSM-5相比Zn/H-ZSMS-5获得的丙烯选择性更高，这可能是由于Zn/Na-ZSM-5上质子位点的密度和可用性较低。
7.位点的酸性取决于沸石框架中三价阳离子的性质。硼硅酸盐沸石中的质子位点比铝硅酸盐弱，因此预计Zn/H[B]-ZSM-5在烷烃脱氢中的烯烃选择性高于Zn/H[Al]-ZSM-5。
8.支撑材料上的酸（Bronsted和Lewis）位点促进了烯烃的再吸附、寡聚化和芳构化。
9.商业Cr和Pt基脱氢催化剂中钾的作用是最大限度地减少质子位点对烯烃选择性的不利影响。
