[1] "Although the equilibrium conversion of alkanes increases with temperature, alkene selectivity decreases with increasing temperature and chain length due to an increased tendency toward dehydrocyclization/aromatisation, thermal cracking and coke formation."
[2] "Catalyst improvement endeavors can benefit from insights on alkane CH bond activation mechanisms."
[3] "The extent of PtSn interactions depends on the impregnation sequence of Pt and Sn precursors on the support material."
[4] "Sequential impregnation with tin added first results in a strong interaction with the support material, and the tin-support material interaction can influence the surface acidity of the catalyst."
[5] "The framework of microporous zeolites exerts dispersive forces on the reactant's molecules that depend on the shape, channel and cavity of the framework."
[6] "In addition, the nature and the density of the active sites influence the framework dispersion forces."
[7] "Recent reports have shown that the strong electrostatic field between protons or exchanged metal ions and basic oxygen species can enhance and/or induce polarization of bonds in hydrocarbon adsorbates."
[8] "This agrees with Hashiguchi et al. [26] , who found enhanced activation of the CH bond on a homogeneous catalyst."
[9] "Wender et al. [27] showed that 3040% of heat adsorption in n-alkanes on Na-zeolite is due to polarization of the adsorbates."
[10] "Subbotina et al. [28] also demonstrated that the CH bond of ethane is more strongly polarized on Mg2 + and Ca2 + forms of Y zeolite than on Na+ forms."
[11] "Mg2 +-Y zeolite molecules exhibit weaker adsorption and polarization of ethane than Ca2 +-zeolites."
[12] "Based on charge density considerations, Mg2 + cations are expected to exhibit a stronger polarizing effect than Ca2 + cations."
[13] "Subbotina et al. explain that because of the smaller ionic radius of Mg2 +, it is more strongly shielded by the surrounding oxygen atoms of the zeolite lattice than a Ca2 + ion, thereby reducing the polarizing effect of Mg2 + on the hydrocarbon adsorbate."
[14] "Sievers et al. [29] ,[30] also report that the La3 + form of X zeolite induces strong polarization of adsorbed alkane molecules; partial positive charges were induced on secondary and tertiary carbon atoms of alkane molecules."
[15] "The authors suggest that the polarization may be viewed as an intermediate condition to hydride abstraction (which is an important elementary step in CH activation)."
[16] "They add that CH bond polarization was enhanced by physisorbed water molecules that coordinate with La3 + cations."
[17] "The enhanced polarization of CH bonds by the presence of water molecules on La3 +X zeolite may have a beneficial effect in oxidative dehydrogenation where water is a by-product."
[18] "Alkane polarization studies on Na+, Mg2 +, Ca2 +, and La3 + exchanged X-zeolites indicate that the polarizing effect increases with increasing charge magnitude and ionic radius."
[19] "Note that these alkane polarizing cations occupy the same position on the zeolites as the well-known CH activation cations/metals, and thus the CH polarizing effect has a complementary effect on CH activation."
[20] "This may add to the number of relevant variables and increase the challenge of optimizing the ratio of activation/polarizing cations among exchangeable sites (Si/Al ratio), as well as the sequence for incorporating the cations or metals during catalyst preparation."
[21] "Further, it is important to note that the choice of cations should be such that they exhibit no catalytic (oligomerization, isomerization, aromatisation or oxidation) effects on the target alkene products at the reaction condition."
[22] "Furthermore, it may be beneficial to create a CH polarization effect on the zeolite framework."
[23] "This can be achieved by appropriate chance of framework atoms."
[24] "Since active sites are usually created on the zeolite frameworks."
[25] "The active sites (alkoxide intermediate) of the bimolecular pathway are formed in situ ( Scheme 1 )."
[26] "The alkoxide intermediate is made up of an alkyl carbenium ion ionically held to the zeolite framework oxygen ion."
[27] "The active sites of the unimolecular pathway are the charge balancing protons of the zeolite framework."
[28] "A proton and a carbenium ion are an electrophilic or Lewis acid species (a proton can also be considered as a special case of Lewis acidity)."
[29] "The two pathways essentially involve electrophilic CH activation."
[30] "The electrophiles (proton and carbenium ion) activate CH at high temperatures (500 C), giving low conversion rates of light alkanes and poor selectivity to corresponding alkenes."
[31] "The elementary steps of CH activation on OGa+ ( Scheme 2 ) reveal that a redox cycle at the metal center is required for catalytic CH activation via the oxidative addition mechanism."
[32] "A redox cycle is not apparent in the elementary step presented for CH activation on OZn2+O."
[33] "Hence, a redox cycle is not a requisite for CH activation via the Lewis base-assisted deprotonation mechanism."
[34] "However, under alkane dehydrogenation reaction conditions, the OZn2+O sites can undergo a reversible Zn2 +/Zn redox process ( Scheme 3 )."
[35] "This redox process increases the availability of undesired protonic site intermediates."
[36] "Zn-exchanged H-ZSM-5 prepared by conventional ion-exchange methods contain a significant percentage of unexchanged proton sites leading to lower alkene selectivity of the catalyst."
[37] "Iglesia and Biscardi [59] titrate the proton sites with NaOH."
[38] "The un-titrated and the titrated catalysts are denoted as Zn/H-ZSMS-5 and Zn/Na-ZSMS-5, respectively."
[39] "Zn/Na-ZSM-5 has four times the propane conversion rate and a higher propene selectivity than Zn/H-ZSMS-5."
[40] "The propene formation rate obtained with Zn/Na-ZSM-5 was ten times that of Zn/H-ZSMS-5."
[41] "The zinc species at the cation exchange site of the zeolite was identified as OZn+OH."
[42] "The higher propene selectivity obtained on Zn/Na-ZSM-5 compared to Zn/H-ZSMS-5 is presumably from the lower density and availability of proton sites on Zn/Na-ZSM-5."
[43] "The improved propane conversion rate of Zn/Na-ZSM-5 compared to Zn/H-ZSM-5 is attributable to the higher efficiency of OZn+OH sites in catalyzing desorption of H-adatoms than OZn2+O sites."
[44] "Another strategy to enhance alkene selectivity is by controlling the strength of the proton sites."
[45] "The acidity of the sites depends on the nature of the trivalent cation of the zeolite framework."
[46] "Proton sites in borosilicate zeolites are weaker than those of aluminosilicate [60] ,[61] ,[62] ,[63] ,[64] , and thus higher alkene selectivity is expected for alkane dehydrogenation over Zn/H[B]-ZSM-5 compared to Zn/H[Al]-ZSM-5."
[47] "However, Zn/H[B]-ZSM-5 shows no activity for propane dehydrogenation."
[48] "The desired weaker acidity of the proton sites of Zn/H[B]-ZSM-5 requires weaker basicity of the oxygen atoms in the zeolite framework."
[49] "This reduced basicity of the oxygen atoms is not sufficiently polarizing to complement the exchanged Zn2 + in CH bond cleavage."
[50] "In the next section, we examine use of zeolite support to design a Pt-based alkane dehydrogenation catalyst."
[51] "Elimination of the proton sites of zeolites is critical for obtaining a high alkene selectivity and stability in dehydrogenation catalysts."
[52] "Pt is the most versatile noble metal catalyst for alkane reactions [65] ."
[53] "Although Pt is expensive, the choice of Pt is often justified by its higher activity, stability and selectivity for these reactions compared to less expensive alternative transition metals."
[54] "However, rapid catalyst deactivation due to coke formation remains a challenge even when using a Pt-based catalyst for dehydrogenation of light alkanes."
[55] "Waku et al."
[56] "exploited the unique property of zeolite as a support for achieving high metal dispersion through cation exchange sites to create a Pt/Na[Fe]-ZSM-5 catalyst with outstanding stability for dehydrogenation of light alkanes."
[57] "They found that the catalyst deactivation rate of Pt/Na[Fe]-ZSM-5 was lower than for any other Pt-based catalysts in refractory oxide support."
[58] "The unprecedented performance of Pt/Na[Fe]-ZSM-5 was attributed to its high Pt dispersion (cluster size < 1 mm) on zeolite through ion-exchange."
[59] "There is a tendency to generate some Brnsted protons on the zeolite during the exchange process, but the choice of Fe3 + as an isomorphous cation in place of Al3 + led to weaker Brnsted sites in [Fe]-ZSM compared to [Al]-ZSM."
[60] "The weaker acidity minimizes the tendency of side reactions (cracking of oligomerization, aromatisation, and coke), which translates into higher alkene selectivity and catalyst stability."
[61] "In another report, Xuebing and Iglesia [67] demonstrated the ability of Pt/Na[Fe]-ZSM-5 to dehydrogenate alkanes longer than C4; n-pentane and n-heptane were selectively converted to n-pentene and n-heptene, respectively."
[62] "Alkene selectivity was also improved when the residual proton generated during Pt exchange or Na-[Fe]-ZSM was titrated with Cs [67] ."
[63] "Although Pt with conventional refractory oxides (Al2O3, SiO2, ZrO2, etc.) used for dehydrogenation of alkanes has similar conversion rates to Pt/Na[Fe]-ZSM-5, deactivation rates are also rapid due to coke formation."
[64] "The presence of acid (Bronsted and Lewis) sites on the supports promotes readsorption, oligomerization and aromatisation of alkenes."
[65] "Promotion of Pt with metals, such as Sn, Ga, Zn, Re, etc., improves catalyst stability, but also leads to faster deactivation rates than Pt/Na[Fe]-ZSM-5."
[66] "However, recent reports by Bell et al. [68] ,[69] ,[70] show that the use of calcined hydrotalcite (Al/Mg  0.1) supported on bimetallic PtGa or PtSn gave very high alkene selectivity and stability, comparable to Pt/Na[Fe]-ZSM-5."

1.催化剂的物理化学性质，包括化学品质（如酸强度和稳定性）和形态特征，对脱氢反应的性能有重大影响。催化剂改进的努力可以从对烷烃CH键活化机制的洞察中受益。PtSn相互作用的程度取决于Pt和Sn前体在支撑材料上的浸渍顺序。首先添加锡的顺序浸渍与支撑材料产生强烈的相互作用，锡-支撑材料相互作用可以影响催化剂的表面酸性。微孔沸石的框架对反应物分子施加分散力，这取决于框架的形状、通道和空腔。此外，活性位点的性质和密度影响框架分散力。最近的报告表明，质子或交换金属离子与基本氧物种之间的强静电场可以增强和/或诱导烃吸附物中键的极化。这可以导致在均相催化剂上CH键的增强活化。在Na+、Mg2+、Ca2+和La3+交换的X-沸石上进行的烷烃极化研究表明，极化效应随着电荷大小和离子半径的增加而增加。请注意，这些烷烃极化阳离子占据沸石上的相同位置，作为众所周知的CH活化阳离子/金属，因此CH极化效应对CH活化有互补作用。这可能会增加相关变量的数量，并增加优化交换位点（Si/Al比）中活化/极化阳离子比例以及在催化剂制备过程中掺入阳离子或金属顺序的挑战。此外，重要的是要注意，所选阳离子应确保在反应条件下对目标烯烃产品没有催化（寡聚化、异构化、芳构化或氧化）影响。此外，创建沸石框架上的CH极化效应可能有益。这可以通过适当的机会改变框架原子来实现。由于活性位点通常在沸石框架上创建。消除沸石的质子位点对于获得高烯烃选择性和脱氢催化剂的稳定性至关重要。硼硅酸盐沸石中的质子位点比铝硅酸盐弱，因此预计Zn/H[B]-ZSM-5的烷烃脱氢比Zn/H[Al]-ZSM-5具有更高的烯烃选择性。然而，Zn/H[B]-ZSM-5对丙烷脱氢没有活性。Zn/H[B]-ZSM-5中所需较弱的质子位点酸性需要沸石框架中氧原子的较弱碱性。这种氧原子碱性的降低不足以补充交换的Zn2+在CH键断裂中的作用。
