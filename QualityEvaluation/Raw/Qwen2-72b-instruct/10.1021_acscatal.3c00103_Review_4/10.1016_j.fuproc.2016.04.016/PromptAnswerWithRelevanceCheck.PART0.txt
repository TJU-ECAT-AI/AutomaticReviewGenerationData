[1] "Although the equilibrium conversion of alkanes increases with temperature, alkene selectivity decreases with increasing temperature and chain length due to an increased tendency toward dehydrocyclization/aromatisation, thermal cracking and coke formation."
[2] "The extent of PtSn interactions depends on the impregnation sequence of Pt and Sn precursors on the support material."
[3] "The alkali promoter can also influence the nature of the Cr species present on the catalyst surface."
[4] "The framework of microporous zeolites exerts dispersive forces on the reactant's molecules that depend on the shape, channel and cavity of the framework."
[5] "The nature and the density of the active sites influence the framework dispersion forces."
[6] "Recent reports have shown that the strong electrostatic field between protons or exchanged metal ions and basic oxygen species can enhance and/or induce polarization of bonds in hydrocarbon adsorbates."
[7] "This agrees with Hashiguchi et al. [26] , who found enhanced activation of the CH bond on a homogeneous catalyst."
[8] "Wender et al. [27] showed that 3040% of heat adsorption in n-alkanes on Na-zeolite is due to polarization of the adsorbates."
[9] "Subbotina et al. [28] also demonstrated that the CH bond of ethane is more strongly polarized on Mg2 + and Ca2 + forms of Y zeolite than on Na+ forms."
[10] "Based on charge density considerations, Mg2 + cations are expected to exhibit a stronger polarizing effect than Ca2 + cations."
[11] "Subbotina et al. explain that because of the smaller ionic radius of Mg2 +, it is more strongly shielded by the surrounding oxygen atoms of the zeolite lattice than a Ca2 + ion, thereby reducing the polarizing effect of Mg2 + on the hydrocarbon adsorbate."
[12] "Sievers et al. [29] ,[30] also report that the La3 + form of X zeolite induces strong polarization of adsorbed alkane molecules; partial positive charges were induced on secondary and tertiary carbon atoms of alkane molecules."
[13] "The authors suggest that the polarization may be viewed as an intermediate condition to hydride abstraction (which is an important elementary step in CH activation)."
[14] "They add that CH bond polarization was enhanced by physisorbed water molecules that coordinate with La3 + cations."
[15] "The enhanced polarization of CH bonds by the presence of water molecules on La3 +X zeolite may have a beneficial effect in oxidative dehydrogenation where water is a by-product."
[16] "Alkane polarization studies on Na+, Mg2 +, Ca2 +, and La3 + exchanged X-zeolites indicate that the polarizing effect increases with increasing charge magnitude and ionic radius."
[17] "Note that these alkane polarizing cations occupy the same position on the zeolites as the well-known CH activation cations/metals, and thus the CH polarizing effect has a complementary effect on CH activation."
[18] "This may add to the number of relevant variables and increase the challenge of optimizing the ratio of activation/polarizing cations among exchangeable sites (Si/Al ratio), as well as the sequence for incorporating the cations or metals during catalyst preparation."
[19] "Further, it is important to note that the choice of cations should be such that they exhibit no catalytic (oligomerization, isomerization, aromatisation or oxidation) effects on the target alkene products at the reaction condition."
[20] "Furthermore, it may be beneficial to create a CH polarization effect on the zeolite framework."
[21] "This can be achieved by appropriate chance of framework atoms."
[22] "Since active sites are usually created on the zeolite frameworks."
[23] "The unimolecular mechanism involves direct protonation of an alkane-forming carbonium ion intermediate."
[24] "The proton can be inserted into either a CC or CH bond of the alkane."
[25] "Proton insertion through the CC bond leads to cracking of the alkane, with the acid site regenerated."
[26] "Insertion through the HC bond yields H2 and a carbenium ion/alkoxide intermediate."
[27] "Desorption of alkene from the intermediate regenerates the acid, or the alkoxide can enter the bimolecular conversion path."
[28] "In the bimolecular mechanism of CH activation, the alkoxide intermediate constitutes the active sites and CH activation occurs through hydride transfer from a second alkane molecule forming another alkoxide."
[29] "This may be followed by βscission to regenerate the active site and complete the catalytic cycle."
[30] "For example, activation of propane on acid zeolite based on the two mechanisms is illustrated in Scheme 1 ."
[31] "Low reactant partial pressure and high temperature favor unimolecular dehydrogenation of alkane on acid zeolite."
[32] "These conditions favor the endothermic desorption step (rate limiting step) leading to propene."
[33] "In contrast, high partial pressure and low temperature favor the bimolecular mechanism leading to a low propene yield."
[34] "The two molecular mechanisms devoid of side reactions give fairly predictable product distribution."
[35] "However, the products of each route are prone to side reactions (dimerization, oligomerization, isomerization & aromatisation) in the presence of Bronsted acid sites."
[36] "Hence propene selectivity on acidic zeolite is very low and products rich in aromatics are usually obtained [43] ."
[37] "The active sites (alkoxide intermediate) of the bimolecular pathway are formed in situ ( Scheme 1 )."
[38] "The alkoxide intermediate is made up of an alkyl carbenium ion ionically held to the zeolite framework oxygen ion."
[39] "The active sites of the unimolecular pathway are the charge balancing protons of the zeolite framework."
[40] "A proton and a carbenium ion are an electrophilic or Lewis acid species (a proton can also be considered as a special case of Lewis acidity)."
[41] "The two pathways essentially involve electrophilic CH activation."
[42] "The electrophiles (proton and carbenium ion) activate CH at high temperatures (500 C), giving low conversion rates of light alkanes and poor selectivity to corresponding alkenes."
[43] "The above proposition has been demonstrated on metal (e.g., Ga, Zn, and Co) exchanged zeolites."
[44] "The specific role of the exchanged metals has been the subject of several reports with special attention on Ga and Zn."
[45] "Although the framework Ga2O3 on H-MFI seems to have a CH polarization effect on desorbed methane, Ga2O3 exhibits lower CH activation activity [48] and the physical mixture of Ga2O3/HMFI displays higher propane aromatisation activity than pure H-MFI."
[46] "Similar synergistic effects have been reported for Zn/H-MFI and Co/H-MFI [49] ,[50] ,[51] ."
[47] "Exchanged cations behave as monomeric species at the exchange sites of zeolite."
[48] "Iglesia and Biscardi [49] hypothesized that the monomeric species enhance propane conversion by promoting re-combinative desorption (RD) of the H-adatom formed from the CH cleavage."
[49] "It is worthwhile noting that the exchange cations (electrophilic species) constitute the CH activation sites [52] ."
[50] "Hence, more insights are required about their additional role in promoting RD."
[51] "However, the authors did not provide further information on the nature of the H-adatoms and the mechanism of RD."
[52] "The exchanged metal ions in zeolites are held ionically by one or more basic oxygen atoms."
[53] "Different species have been suggested, depending on the density of the cation exchange site of the zeolite and method of introduction of the metals."
[54] "According to Kanansky et al."
[55] "Zn and Ga are introduced on H-ZSM-5 through a vapor deposition technique using Zn metal vapor and Ga(CH3)3 as the source of Zn and Ga, respectively."
[56] "The metal introduction technique allows quantitative exchange of the zeolite protons which leads to Zn/Al = 0.5 and Ga/Al = 1, respectively."
[57] "Zn2 + is generated directly, but Ga+ is produced by H2 treatment at 500 C to release the methyl groups."
[58] "The proposed active sites are OZn2+O and OGa+, respectively."
[59] "The mechanism of CH activation with ethane by the two sites under the same reaction conditions are summarized in Scheme 2 ."
[60] "The proposed mechanism is in agreement with the mechanism suggested from calculations using the GAUSSIAN 94 program for ethane activation on Zn-exchanged zeolite by Frash and van Santen [54] ."
[61] "In another theoretical study using a DFT cluster modeling approach, Pidko and van Santen [55] compared the activation energy of CH with three types of Zn species at active sites: OZn2+O, OZn+OZn+O and HOZn+ O."
[62] "The authors suggest that the reaction proceeds most easily on OZn2+O, and hypothesize that the enhanced Lewis activity of OZn2+O facilitates CH heterolytic cleavage."
[63] "They further argue that the first proton abstraction occurs preferentially on the oxygen sites neighboring the ring where the cation is located."
[64] "They proposed a one-step reaction to yield H2 and C2H4 from the decomposition of the Zn-alkyl and proton."
[65] "A proposed mechanism of CH activation on OGa+ has similarly been suggested using theoretical calculations [56] ."
[66] "High alkene selectivities are obtained on the H-ZSM-5 when exchangeable protons are rigorously replaced by Zn and Ga."
[67] "The Zn-exchanged H-ZSM-5 had higher ethane conversion rates but lower ethene selectivity than its Ga counterpart [53] ."
[68] "The CH activation on the OZn2+O site can be described by a Lewis base-assisted deprotonation mechanism."
[69] "This is accompanied by conversion of the Lewis base site to a conjugate Bronsted acid site."
[70] "The OGa+ site, however, activates the CH bond via oxidative addition without a protonic site intermediate [57] ."
[71] "A protonic site intermediate increases tendency of side reactions on the Zn-exchanged H-ZSM-5 relative to the Ga counterpart."
[72] "The elementary steps of CH activation on OGa+ ( Scheme 2 ) reveal that a redox cycle at the metal center is required for catalytic CH activation via the oxidative addition mechanism."
[73] "A redox cycle is not apparent in the elementary step presented for CH activation on OZn2+O."
[74] "Hence, a redox cycle is not a requisite for CH activation via the Lewis base-assisted deprotonation mechanism."
[75] "However, under alkane dehydrogenation reaction conditions, the OZn2+O sites can undergo a reversible Zn2 +/Zn redox process ( Scheme 3 ) [58] ."
[76] "This redox process increases the availability of undesired protonic site intermediates."
[77] "Zn-exchanged H-ZSM-5 prepared by conventional ion-exchange methods contain a significant percentage of unexchanged proton sites leading to lower alkene selectivity of the catalyst."
[78] "Iglesia and Biscardi [59] titrate the proton sites with NaOH."
[79] "The un-titrated and the titrated catalysts are denoted as Zn/H-ZSMS-5 and Zn/Na-ZSMS-5, respectively."
[80] "Zn/Na-ZSM-5 has four times the propane conversion rate and a higher propene selectivity than Zn/H-ZSMS-5."
[81] "The propene formation rate obtained with Zn/Na-ZSM-5 was ten times that of Zn/H-ZSMS-5."
[82] "The zinc species at the cation exchange site of the zeolite was identified as OZn+OH."
[83] "The higher propene selectivity obtained on Zn/Na-ZSM-5 compared to Zn/H-ZSMS-5 is presumably from the lower density and availability of proton sites on Zn/Na-ZSM-5."
[84] "The improved propane conversion rate of Zn/Na-ZSM-5 compared to Zn/H-ZSM-5 is attributable to the higher efficiency of OZn+OH sites in catalyzing desorption of H-adatoms than OZn2+O sites."
[85] "Another strategy to enhance alkene selectivity is by controlling the strength of the proton sites."
[86] "The acidity of the sites depends on the nature of the trivalent cation of the zeolite framework."
[87] "Proton sites in borosilicate zeolites are weaker than those of aluminosilicate [60] ,[61] ,[62] ,[63] ,[64] , and thus higher alkene selectivity is expected for alkane dehydrogenation over Zn/H[B]-ZSM-5 compared to Zn/H[Al]-ZSM-5."
[88] "However, Zn/H[B]-ZSM-5 shows no activity for propane dehydrogenation."
[89] "The desired weaker acidity of the proton sites of Zn/H[B]-ZSM-5 requires weaker basicity of the oxygen atoms in the zeolite framework."
[90] "This reduced basicity of the oxygen atoms is not sufficiently polarizing to complement the exchanged Zn2 + in CH bond cleavage."
[91] "In the next section, we examine use of zeolite support to design a Pt-based alkane dehydrogenation catalyst."
[92] "Elimination of the proton sites of zeolites is critical for obtaining a high alkene selectivity and stability in dehydrogenation catalysts."
[93] "Pt is the most versatile noble metal catalyst for alkane reactions [65] ."
[94] "Although Pt is expensive, the choice of Pt is often justified by its higher activity, stability and selectivity for these reactions compared to less expensive alternative transition metals."
[95] "However, rapid catalyst deactivation due to coke formation remains a challenge even when using a Pt-based catalyst for dehydrogenation of light alkanes."
[96] "Waku et al."
[97] "[66] exploited the unique property of zeolite as a support for achieving high metal dispersion through cation exchange sites to create a Pt/Na[Fe]-ZSM-5 catalyst with outstanding stability for dehydrogenation of light alkanes."
[98] "They found that the catalyst deactivation rate of Pt/Na[Fe]-ZSM-5 was lower than for any other Pt-based catalysts in refractory oxide support."
[99] "The unprecedented performance of Pt/Na[Fe]-ZSM-5 was attributed to its high Pt dispersion (cluster size < 1 mm) on zeolite through ion-exchange."
[100] "There is a tendency to generate some Brnsted protons on the zeolite during the exchange process, but the choice of Fe3 + as an isomorphous cation in place of Al3 + led to weaker Brnsted sites in [Fe]-ZSM compared to [Al]-ZSM."
[101] "The weaker acidity minimizes the tendency of side reactions (cracking of oligomerization, aromatisation, and coke), which translates into higher alkene selectivity and catalyst stability."
[102] "In another report, Xuebing and Iglesia [67] demonstrated the ability of Pt/Na[Fe]-ZSM-5 to dehydrogenate alkanes longer than C4; n-pentane and n-heptane were selectively converted to n-pentene and n-heptene, respectively."
[103] "Alkene selectivity was also improved when the residual proton generated during Pt exchange or Na-[Fe]-ZSM was titrated with Cs [67] ."
[104] "Although Pt with conventional refractory oxides (Al2O3, SiO2, ZrO2, etc.) used for dehydrogenation of alkanes has similar conversion rates to Pt/Na[Fe]-ZSM-5, deactivation rates are also rapid due to coke formation."
[105] "The presence of acid (Bronsted and Lewis) sites on the supports promotes readsorption, oligomerization and aromatisation of alkenes."
[106] "Promotion of Pt with metals, such as Sn, Ga, Zn, Re, etc., improves catalyst stability, but also leads to faster deactivation rates than Pt/Na[Fe]-ZSM-5."
[107] "However, recent reports by Bell et al."
[108] "[68] ,[69] ,[70] show that the use of calcined hydrotalcite (Al/Mg  0.1) supported on bimetallic PtGa or PtSn gave very high alkene selectivity and stability, comparable to Pt/Na[Fe]-ZSM-5."

1.The physicochemical properties of catalysts, including chemical qualities (such as acid strength and stability) and morphological characteristics, significantly influence their performance in dehydrogenation reactions. The equilibrium conversion of alkanes increases with temperature, but alkene selectivity decreases due to dehydrocyclization/aromatisation, thermal cracking, and coke formation. The extent of PtSn interactions and the impregnation sequence of Pt and Sn precursors on the support material affect the catalytic efficiency. The alkali promoter influences the nature of the Cr species present on the catalyst surface. The framework of microporous zeolites exerts dispersive forces on reactant molecules, depending on the shape, channel, and cavity of the framework. The nature and density of the active sites influence the framework dispersion forces. Protons or exchanged metal ions and basic oxygen species can enhance and/or induce polarization of bonds in hydrocarbon adsorbates. The polarizing effect increases with increasing charge magnitude and ionic radius. The choice of cations should not exhibit catalytic effects on the target alkene products at the reaction condition. Creating a CH polarization effect on the zeolite framework can be achieved by changing framework atoms. The unimolecular mechanism involves direct protonation of an alkane-forming carbonium ion intermediate, while the bimolecular mechanism involves hydride transfer from a second alkane molecule forming another alkoxide. Low reactant partial pressure and high temperature favor unimolecular dehydrogenation, while high partial pressure and low temperature favor the bimolecular mechanism. The products of each route are prone to side reactions in the presence of Bronsted acid sites, leading to low propene selectivity. The exchanged cations (electrophilic species) constitute the CH activation sites and enhance propane conversion by promoting re-combinative desorption (RD) of the H-adatom formed from the CH cleavage.

The CH activation on the OZn2+O site can be described by a Lewis base-assisted deprotonation mechanism, while the OGa+ site activates the CH bond via oxidative addition without a protonic site intermediate. The OZn2+O sites can undergo a reversible Zn2+/Zn redox process under alkane dehydrogenation reaction conditions. Zn-exchanged H-ZSM-5 prepared by conventional ion-exchange methods contain unexchanged proton sites leading to lower alkene selectivity. The zinc species at the cation exchange site of the zeolite was identified as OZn+OH. The higher propene selectivity obtained on Zn/Na-ZSM-5 compared to Zn/H-ZSMS-5 is from the lower density and availability of proton sites. The improved propane conversion rate of Zn/Na-ZSM-5 compared to Zn/H-ZSM-5 is attributable to the higher efficiency of OZn+OH sites in catalyzing desorption of H-adatoms than OZn2+O sites. Another strategy to enhance alkene selectivity is by controlling the strength of the proton sites. Proton sites in borosilicate zeolites are weaker than those of aluminosilicate, and thus higher alkene selectivity is expected for alkane dehydrogenation over Zn/H[B]-ZSM-5 compared to Zn/H[Al]-ZSM-5. Elimination of the proton sites of zeolites is critical for obtaining a high alkene selectivity and stability in dehydrogenation catalysts. Pt is the most versatile noble metal catalyst for alkane reactions, but rapid catalyst deactivation due to coke formation remains a challenge. The unique property of zeolite as a support for achieving high metal dispersion through cation exchange sites can create a Pt/Na[Fe]-ZSM-5 catalyst with outstanding stability for dehydrogenation of light alkanes. The choice of Fe3+ as an isomorphous cation in place of Al3+ led to weaker Brnsted sites in [Fe]-ZSM compared to [Al]-ZSM, minimizing the tendency of side reactions and translating into higher alkene selectivity and catalyst stability.

1.催化剂的物理化学性质，包括化学性质（如酸强度和稳定性）和形态特征，对脱氢反应的性能有重大影响。随着温度的升高，烷烃的平衡转化率增加，但由于脱氢环化/芳构化、热裂解和焦炭形成，烯烃的选择性降低。PtSn的相互作用程度和Pt和Sn前体在支撑材料上的浸渍顺序影响催化效率。碱性促进剂影响催化剂表面上Cr物种的性质。微孔沸石框架对反应物分子施加分散力，这取决于框架的形状、通道和腔体。活性位点的性质和密度影响框架分散力。质子或交换金属离子和碱性氧物种可以增强和/或诱导烃吸附物中键的极化。极化效应随电荷大小和离子半径的增加而增加。所选阳离子在反应条件下不应对目标烯烃产品产生催化作用。在沸石框架上创建CH极化效应可以通过改变框架原子来实现。单分子机制涉及直接质子化烷烃形成碳离子中间体，而双分子机制涉及从第二个烷烃分子转移氢化物形成另一个醇。低反应物分压和高温有利于单分子脱氢，而高分压和低温则有利于双分子机制。每种途径的产品在Bronsted酸位点的存在下容易发生副反应，导致丙烯选择性低。交换阳离子（亲电性物种）构成CH活化位点，并通过促进从CH裂解形成的H-原子的重组解吸（RD）来增强丙烷转化。沸石中交换的金属离子通过一个或多个碱性氧原子离子保持，根据沸石的阳离子交换位点密度和金属的引入方法，提出了不同的物种。当可交换质子被Zn和Ga严格取代时，可以获得高烯烃选择性。CH活化在OZn2+O位点可以通过Lewis碱辅助脱质子机制来描述，而OGa+位点通过氧化加成活化CH键，没有质子位点中间体。OZn2+O位点在烷烃脱氢反应条件下可以经历可逆的Zn2+/Zn氧化还原过程。通过常规离子交换方法制备的Zn交换H-ZSM-5含有未交换的质子位点，导致烯烃选择性降低。沸石中阳离子交换位点的锌物种被鉴定为OZn+OH。与Zn/H-ZSMS-5相比，在Zn/Na-ZSM-5上获得的更高丙烯选择性归因于质子位点的较低密度和可用性。与Zn/H-ZSM-5相比，Zn/Na-ZSM-5的丙烷转化率提高可归因于OZn+OH位点催化H-原子解吸的效率高于OZn2+O位点。另一种增强烯烃选择性的策略是控制质子位点的强度。硼硅酸盐沸石中的质子位点比铝硅酸盐弱，因此预计在Zn/H[B]-ZSM-5上烷烃脱氢的烯烃选择性高于Zn/H[Al]-ZSM-5。消除沸石的质子位点对于获得高烯烃选择性和脱氢催化剂的稳定性至关重要。Pt是烷烃反应中最通用的贵金属催化剂，但由于焦炭形成导致的催化剂失活速度加快，仍存在挑战。通过阳离子交换位点实现高金属分散的独特沸石支撑性质可以创建Pt/Na[Fe]-ZSM-5催化剂，用于轻烷烃脱氢的出色稳定性。将Fe3+作为异形阳离子代替Al3+导致[Fe]-ZSM中的Brnsted位点比[Al]-ZSM弱，从而最小化副反应的倾向，并转化为更高的烯烃选择性和催化剂稳定性。

1.The physicochemical properties of catalysts, including chemical qualities (such as acid strength and stability) and morphological characteristics, significantly influence their performance in dehydrogenation reactions. The framework of microporous zeolites exerts dispersive forces on reactant molecules, which depend on the shape, channel, and cavity of the framework. The nature and density of active sites also influence the framework dispersion forces. Recent reports have shown that the strong electrostatic field between protons or exchanged metal ions and basic oxygen species can enhance and/or induce polarization of bonds in hydrocarbon adsorbates. This polarization effect can be viewed as an intermediate condition to hydride abstraction, an important elementary step in CH activation. The polarizing effect increases with increasing charge magnitude and ionic radius of the alkane polarizing cations. The choice of cations should be such that they exhibit no catalytic effects on the target alkene products at the reaction condition. It may be beneficial to create a CH polarization effect on the zeolite framework by appropriate modification of framework atoms. Active sites are usually created on the zeolite frameworks. The active sites of the bimolecular pathway are formed in situ and are made up of an alkyl carbenium ion ionically held to the zeolite framework oxygen ion. The active sites of the unimolecular pathway are the charge balancing protons of the zeolite framework. A proton and a carbenium ion are electrophilic or Lewis acid species, and the two pathways essentially involve electrophilic CH activation. The exchanged metal ions in zeolites are held ionically by one or more basic oxygen atoms. Different species have been suggested, depending on the density of the cation exchange site of the zeolite and the method of introduction of the metals. High alkene selectivities are obtained on the H-ZSM-5 when exchangeable protons are rigorously replaced by Zn and Ga. The CH activation on the OZn2+O site can be described by a Lewis base-assisted deprotonation mechanism, accompanied by conversion of the Lewis base site to a conjugate Bronsted acid site. The OGa+ site, however, activates the CH bond via oxidative addition without a protonic site intermediate. A protonic site intermediate increases the tendency of side reactions on the Zn-exchanged H-ZSM-5 relative to the Ga counterpart. The elementary steps of CH activation on OGa+ reveal that a redox cycle at the metal center is required for catalytic CH activation via the oxidative addition mechanism. However, under alkane dehydrogenation reaction conditions, the OZn2+O sites can undergo a reversible Zn2+/Zn redox process, increasing the availability of undesired protonic site intermediates. Zn-exchanged H-ZSM-5 prepared by conventional ion-exchange methods contain a significant percentage of unexchanged proton sites, leading to lower alkene selectivity of the catalyst. Another strategy to enhance alkene selectivity is by controlling the strength of the proton sites. The acidity of the sites depends on the nature of the trivalent cation of the zeolite framework. Proton sites in borosilicate zeolites are weaker than those of aluminosilicate, and thus higher alkene selectivity is expected for alkane dehydrogenation over Zn/H[B]-ZSM-5 compared to Zn/H[Al]-ZSM-5. However, Zn/H[B]-ZSM-5 shows no activity for propane dehydrogenation. The desired weaker acidity of the proton sites of Zn/H[B]-ZSM-5 requires weaker basicity of the oxygen atoms in the zeolite framework. This reduced basicity of the oxygen atoms is not sufficiently polarizing to complement the exchanged Zn2+ in CH bond cleavage. Elimination of the proton sites of zeolites is critical for obtaining a high alkene selectivity and stability in dehydrogenation catalysts. Pt is the most versatile noble metal catalyst for alkane reactions, often justified by its higher activity, stability, and selectivity for these reactions compared to less expensive alternative transition metals. However, rapid catalyst deactivation due to coke formation remains a challenge even when using a Pt-based catalyst for dehydrogenation of light alkanes.

1.催化剂的物理化学性质，包括化学品质（如酸强度和稳定性）和形态特征，对脱氢反应的性能有重大影响。微孔沸石框架对反应物分子施加分散力，这取决于框架的形状、通道和空腔。活性位点的性质和密度也影响框架的分散力。最近的报告表明，质子或交换金属离子与基本氧物种之间的强静电场可以增强和/或诱导烃吸附物中键的极化。这种极化效应可以视为向氢化物抽离过渡的中间条件，这是CH活化的重要基本步骤。极化效应随着烷基极化阳离子的电荷大小和离子半径的增加而增加。选择的阳离子应确保在反应条件下对目标烯烃产品没有催化作用。在沸石框架上创造CH极化效应可能是有益的，这可以通过适当修改框架原子来实现。活性位点通常在沸石框架上创建。双分子途径的活性位点是原位形成的，由离子结合到沸石框架氧离子的烷基卡宾离子组成。单分子途径的活性位点是沸石框架的质子平衡电荷。质子和卡宾离子是亲电性或路易斯酸性物种，两种途径本质上涉及亲电性CH活化。沸石中交换的金属离子通过一个或多个基本氧原子离子结合。根据沸石的阳离子交换位点密度和金属的引入方法，提出了不同的物种。当可交换的质子被严格替换为Zn和Ga时，H-ZSM-5获得了高烯烃选择性。OZn2+O位点上的CH活化可以通过路易斯碱辅助脱质子机制来描述，伴随路易斯碱位点转化为共轭布龙斯特酸位点。然而，OGa+位点通过氧化加成而不是质子位点中间体活化CH键。质子位点中间体增加了Zn交换的H-ZSM-5相对于Ga对应物的副反应倾向。OGa+的CH活化基本步骤揭示，金属中心的氧化还原循环是通过氧化加成机制催化CH活化所必需的。然而，在烷烃脱氢反应条件下，OZn2+O位点可以经历可逆的Zn2+/Zn氧化还原过程，增加了不希望的质子位点中间体的可用性。通过传统离子交换方法制备的Zn交换H-ZSM-5含有大量未交换的质子位点，导致催化剂的烯烃选择性降低。另一种增强烯烃选择性的策略是控制质子位点的强度。位点的酸性取决于沸石框架的三价阳离子的性质。硼硅酸盐沸石中的质子位点比铝硅酸盐弱，因此预计Zn/H[B]-ZSM-5在烷烃脱氢中的烯烃选择性高于Zn/H[Al]-ZSM-5。然而，Zn/H[B]-ZSM-5在丙烷脱氢中没有活性。Zn/H[B]-ZSM-5中所需较弱的质子位点酸性需要沸石框架中氧原子的较弱碱性。这种氧原子碱性的降低不足以补充交换的Zn2+在CH键断裂中的作用。消除沸石的质子位点对于获得高烯烃选择性和脱氢催化剂的稳定性至关重要。Pt是烷烃反应中最通用的贵金属催化剂，通常因其在这些反应中的较高活性、稳定性和选择性而被证明是合理的，与成本较低的替代过渡金属相比。然而，即使使用Pt基催化剂进行轻烷烃脱氢，由于焦炭形成导致的催化剂失活速度仍然很快。支持物上的酸（布龙斯特和路易斯）位点促进了烯烃的再吸附、寡聚化和芳构化。Pt与Sn、Ga、Zn、Re等金属的促进提高了催化剂的稳定性，但与Pt/Na[Fe]-ZSM-5相比，失活速度也更快。商业Cr和Pt基脱氢催化剂中钾的作用是最大限度地减少质子位点对烯烃选择性的不利影响。表面氧物种的性质和作用变得更加明显。Sn的电子促进效应与氧化加成CH活化机制一致。然而，路易斯碱辅助脱质子机制也可以解释在Cr基催化剂上提出的CH活化。最近的一份报告表明，一种多孔铜铝框架材料（由金属氧化物稳定）在丙烷脱氢中的性能（活性/选择性/稳定性）优于PtSn/Al2O3。可以在此处调用路易斯碱辅助脱质子机制，金属中心的氧化还原性质可能在实现350°C下的丙烷脱氢中发挥作用。这应该是非氧化脱氢较低烷烃的未来研究方向。

1.催化剂的物理化学性质，包括化学品质（如酸强度和稳定性）和形态特征，对脱氢反应的性能有重大影响。催化剂改进的努力可以从对烷烃CH键活化机制的洞察中受益。PtSn相互作用的程度取决于Pt和Sn前体在支撑材料上的浸渍顺序。首先添加锡的顺序浸渍与支撑材料产生强烈的相互作用，锡-支撑材料相互作用可以影响催化剂的表面酸性。微孔沸石的框架对反应物分子施加分散力，这取决于框架的形状、通道和空腔。此外，活性位点的性质和密度影响框架分散力。最近的报告表明，质子或交换金属离子与基本氧物种之间的强静电场可以增强和/或诱导烃吸附物中键的极化。这可以导致在均相催化剂上CH键的增强活化。在Na+、Mg2+、Ca2+和La3+交换的X-沸石上进行的烷烃极化研究表明，极化效应随着电荷大小和离子半径的增加而增加。请注意，这些烷烃极化阳离子占据沸石上的相同位置，作为众所周知的CH活化阳离子/金属，因此CH极化效应对CH活化有互补作用。这可能会增加相关变量的数量，并增加优化交换位点（Si/Al比）中活化/极化阳离子比例以及在催化剂制备过程中掺入阳离子或金属顺序的挑战。此外，重要的是要注意，所选阳离子应确保在反应条件下对目标烯烃产品没有催化（寡聚化、异构化、芳构化或氧化）影响。此外，创建沸石框架上的CH极化效应可能有益。这可以通过适当的机会改变框架原子来实现。由于活性位点通常在沸石框架上创建。消除沸石的质子位点对于获得高烯烃选择性和脱氢催化剂的稳定性至关重要。硼硅酸盐沸石中的质子位点比铝硅酸盐弱，因此预计Zn/H[B]-ZSM-5的烷烃脱氢比Zn/H[Al]-ZSM-5具有更高的烯烃选择性。然而，Zn/H[B]-ZSM-5对丙烷脱氢没有活性。Zn/H[B]-ZSM-5中所需较弱的质子位点酸性需要沸石框架中氧原子的较弱碱性。这种氧原子碱性的降低不足以补充交换的Zn2+在CH键断裂中的作用。

[1] "The extent of PtSn interactions depends on the impregnation sequence of Pt and Sn precursors on the support material. Co-impregnation will result in greater PtSn interaction than if precursors are impregnated sequentially. Sequential impregnation with tin added first results in a strong interaction with the support material, and the tin-support material interaction can influence the surface acidity of the catalyst."
[2] "The framework of microporous zeolites exerts dispersive forces on the reactant's molecules that depend on the shape, channel and cavity of the framework. In addition, the nature and the density of the active sites influence the framework dispersion forces."
[3] "The active sites (alkoxide intermediate) of the bimolecular pathway are formed in situ ( Scheme 1 ). The alkoxide intermediate is made up of an alkyl carbenium ion ionically held to the zeolite framework oxygen ion."
[4] "The exchanged metal ions in zeolites are held ionically by one or more basic oxygen atoms. Different species have been suggested, depending on the density of the cation exchange site of the zeolite and method of introduction of the metals."
[5] "The mechanism of CH activation on OGa+ has similarly been suggested using theoretical calculations [56] ."
[6] "The higher propene selectivity obtained on Zn/Na-ZSM-5 compared to Zn/H-ZSMS-5 is presumably from the lower density and availability of proton sites on Zn/Na-ZSM-5."
[7] "The acidity of the sites depends on the nature of the trivalent cation of the zeolite framework. Proton sites in borosilicate zeolites are weaker than those of aluminosilicate [60] ,[61] ,[62] ,[63] ,[64] , and thus higher alkene selectivity is expected for alkane dehydrogenation over Zn/H[B]-ZSM-5 compared to Zn/H[Al]-ZSM-5."
[8] "The presence of acid (Bronsted and Lewis) sites on the supports promotes readsorption, oligomerization and aromatisation of alkenes."

1.PtSn在支撑材料上的相互作用程度取决于Pt和Sn前体的浸渍顺序。共浸渍会导致更大的PtSn相互作用，而顺序浸渍时，首先添加锡会导致与支撑材料的强烈相互作用，这可能会影响催化剂的表面酸性。
2.微孔沸石框架对反应物分子施加的分散力取决于框架的形状、通道和空腔。活性位点的性质和密度也会影响框架的分散力。
3.双分子途径的活性位点（醇酸中间体）在原位形成，由与沸石框架氧离子离子结合的烷基卡宾离子组成。
4.沸石中交换的金属离子通过一个或多个碱性氧原子离子结合。根据沸石的阳离子交换位点密度和金属引入方法，提出了不同的物种。
5.CH在OGa+上的活化机制已使用理论计算提出。
6.Zn/Na-ZSM-5相比Zn/H-ZSMS-5获得的丙烯选择性更高，这可能是由于Zn/Na-ZSM-5上质子位点的密度和可用性较低。
7.位点的酸性取决于沸石框架中三价阳离子的性质。硼硅酸盐沸石中的质子位点比铝硅酸盐弱，因此预计Zn/H[B]-ZSM-5在烷烃脱氢中的烯烃选择性高于Zn/H[Al]-ZSM-5。
8.支撑材料上的酸（Bronsted和Lewis）位点促进了烯烃的再吸附、寡聚化和芳构化。
9.商业Cr和Pt基脱氢催化剂中钾的作用是最大限度地减少质子位点对烯烃选择性的不利影响。

1.The physicochemical properties of catalysts, including chemical qualities (such as acid strength and stability) and morphological characteristics, have a significant influence on their performance in dehydrogenation reactions. The equilibrium conversion of alkanes increases with temperature, but alkene selectivity decreases due to an increased tendency toward dehydrocyclization/aromatisation, thermal cracking, and coke formation. The extent of PtSn interactions depends on the impregnation sequence of Pt and Sn precursors on the support material. The elementary steps involved in the dehydrogenation of an alkane over a platinum catalyst are: dissociative adsorption of the alkane into an adsorbed hydrogen atom and alkyl group; elimination of the second hydrogen from the platinum atom bonded alkyl group; followed by desorption of the resulting alkene and recombination of the hydrogen atoms and desorption as a hydrogen molecule. The first and rate-limiting step of alkane dehydrogenation using platinum or chromium oxide-based catalysts involves CH activation. The framework of microporous zeolites exerts dispersive forces on the reactant's molecules that depend on the shape, channel, and cavity of the framework. The polarizing effect increases with increasing charge magnitude and ionic radius. The two pathways essentially involve electrophilic CH activation. The elementary steps of CH activation on OGa+ reveal that a redox cycle at the metal center is required for catalytic CH activation via the oxidative addition mechanism. The presence of acid (Bronsted and Lewis) sites on the supports promotes readsorption, oligomerization, and aromatisation of alkenes. The nature and interaction of vanadium with the support determine the nature of the predominant VOx structure. The reaction order of ODH reactions with respect to alkanes is usually one, or unity. The heats of adsorption of alkenes on acidic sites are higher than those of the corresponding alkanes. The extent of reduction of the VOx phase by an alkane influences alkene selectivity. The concentration of the O2 radicals increases during the reaction. The oxygen species, identified by spectra simulation, reacts partly with C3H8 and almost completely with C3H6 and CO at room temperature. The superior performance of NiOLiCl/SZ is strongly related to the presence and synergy of LiCl with NiO. The proposed mechanism of ODH over the Li/MgO catalyst does not involve removal of the catalyst lattice oxygen species, but instead CH activation leads to the formation of an alkyl radical. The reaction rates on Li/Dy/Mg/O/(Cl) were an order of magnitude greater than that on Li/Dy/Mg/O. The active site is a radical complex of two nucleophilic atoms, each capable of abstracting a hydrogen atom from the substrate. The rational choice of the dopant cation can increase the alkene selectivity of the catalyst. Support modification strategies can be employed to optimize these properties for enhanced catalytic efficiency and selectivity. For example, the choice of support material can influence the dispersion and stability of the active phase, while the modification of the support surface can alter the acidity and basicity, which can affect the adsorption and activation of reactants. Additionally, the modification of the support can also influence the redox properties of the active phase, which can affect the selectivity and activity of the catalyst.

1.催化剂的物理化学性质，包括化学性质（如酸强度和稳定性）和形态特征，对脱氢反应的性能有重大影响。随着温度的升高，烷烃的平衡转化率增加，但由于脱氢环化/芳构化、热裂解和焦炭形成的倾向增加，烯烃的选择性降低。PtSn相互作用的程度取决于Pt和Sn前体在支撑材料上的浸渍顺序。在铂催化剂上脱氢烷烃的基本步骤是：烷烃的解离吸附，形成吸附的氢原子和烷基基团；从与铂原子结合的烷基基团中消除第二个氢；随后是生成的烯烃的解吸和氢原子的重组以及作为氢分子的解吸。使用铂或铬氧化物基催化剂进行烷烃脱氢的首要和速率限制步骤涉及CH活化。微孔沸石框架对反应物分子施加的分散力取决于框架的形状、通道和腔体。极化效应随电荷大小和离子半径的增加而增加。两条途径本质上涉及电荷性CH活化。在OGa+上的CH活化的基本步骤揭示，金属中心的氧化还原循环是通过氧化加成机制进行催化CH活化所必需的。支撑材料上的酸（Bronsted和Lewis）位点的存在促进了烯烃的再吸附、寡聚化和芳构化。钒与支撑材料的性质和相互作用决定了主要VOx结构的性质。关于烷烃的ODH反应的反应级数通常为一，或为单位。烯烃在酸性位点上的吸附热高于相应的烷烃。钒氧化物相由烷烃还原的程度影响烯烃的选择性。O2自由基的浓度在反应过程中增加。通过光谱模拟识别的氧物种在室温下部分与C3H8反应，几乎完全与C3H6和CO反应。NiOLiCl/SZ的优越性能与LiCl与NiO的存在和协同作用密切相关。Li/MgO催化剂上的ODH提出的机制不涉及催化剂晶格氧物种的去除，而是CH活化导致烷基自由基的形成。Li/Dy/Mg/O/(Cl)上的反应速率比Li/Dy/Mg/O上的反应速率高一个数量级。活性位点是一个由两个亲核原子组成的自由基复合物，每个原子都能从底物中提取一个氢原子。合理选择掺杂阳离子可以提高催化剂的烯烃选择性。可以采用支撑材料改性策略来优化这些性质，以提高催化效率和选择性。例如，支撑材料的选择可以影响活性相的分散性和稳定性，而支撑表面的改性可以改变酸性和碱性，这可能影响反应物的吸附和活化。此外，支撑材料的改性也可以影响活性相的氧化还原性质，这可能影响催化剂的选择性和活性。
