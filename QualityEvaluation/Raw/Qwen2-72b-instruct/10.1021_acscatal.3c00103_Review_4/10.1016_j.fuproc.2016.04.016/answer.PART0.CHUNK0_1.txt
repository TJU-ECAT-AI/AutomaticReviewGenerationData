[1] "Although the equilibrium conversion of alkanes increases with temperature, alkene selectivity decreases with increasing temperature and chain length due to an increased tendency toward dehydrocyclization/aromatisation, thermal cracking and coke formation."
[2] "The framework of microporous zeolites exerts dispersive forces on the reactant's molecules that depend on the shape, channel and cavity of the framework."
[3] "In addition, the nature and the density of the active sites influence the framework dispersion forces."
[4] "Recent reports have shown that the strong electrostatic field between protons or exchanged metal ions and basic oxygen species can enhance and/or induce polarization of bonds in hydrocarbon adsorbates."
[5] "This agrees with Hashiguchi et al. [26] , who found enhanced activation of the CH bond on a homogeneous catalyst."
[6] "Wender et al. [27] showed that 3040% of heat adsorption in n-alkanes on Na-zeolite is due to polarization of the adsorbates."
[7] "Subbotina et al. [28] also demonstrated that the CH bond of ethane is more strongly polarized on Mg2 + and Ca2 + forms of Y zeolite than on Na+ forms."
[8] "Based on charge density considerations, Mg2 + cations are expected to exhibit a stronger polarizing effect than Ca2 + cations."
[9] "Subbotina et al. explain that because of the smaller ionic radius of Mg2 +, it is more strongly shielded by the surrounding oxygen atoms of the zeolite lattice than a Ca2 + ion, thereby reducing the polarizing effect of Mg2 + on the hydrocarbon adsorbate."
[10] "Sievers et al. [29] ,[30] also report that the La3 + form of X zeolite induces strong polarization of adsorbed alkane molecules; partial positive charges were induced on secondary and tertiary carbon atoms of alkane molecules."
[11] "The authors suggest that the polarization may be viewed as an intermediate condition to hydride abstraction (which is an important elementary step in CH activation)."
[12] "They add that CH bond polarization was enhanced by physisorbed water molecules that coordinate with La3 + cations."
[13] "The enhanced polarization of CH bonds by the presence of water molecules on La3 +X zeolite may have a beneficial effect in oxidative dehydrogenation where water is a by-product."
[14] "Alkane polarization studies on Na+, Mg2 +, Ca2 +, and La3 + exchanged X-zeolites indicate that the polarizing effect increases with increasing charge magnitude and ionic radius."
[15] "Note that these alkane polarizing cations occupy the same position on the zeolites as the well-known CH activation cations/metals, and thus the CH polarizing effect has a complementary effect on CH activation."
[16] "This may add to the number of relevant variables and increase the challenge of optimizing the ratio of activation/polarizing cations among exchangeable sites (Si/Al ratio), as well as the sequence for incorporating the cations or metals during catalyst preparation."
[17] "Further, it is important to note that the choice of cations should be such that they exhibit no catalytic (oligomerization, isomerization, aromatisation or oxidation) effects on the target alkene products at the reaction condition."
[18] "Furthermore, it may be beneficial to create a CH polarization effect on the zeolite framework."
[19] "This can be achieved by appropriate chance of framework atoms."
[20] "Since active sites are usually created on the zeolite frameworks."
[21] "The active sites (alkoxide intermediate) of the bimolecular pathway are formed in situ ( Scheme 1 )."
[22] "The alkoxide intermediate is made up of an alkyl carbenium ion ionically held to the zeolite framework oxygen ion."
[23] "The active sites of the unimolecular pathway are the charge balancing protons of the zeolite framework."
[24] "A proton and a carbenium ion are an electrophilic or Lewis acid species (a proton can also be considered as a special case of Lewis acidity)."
[25] "The two pathways essentially involve electrophilic CH activation."
[26] "The electrophiles (proton and carbenium ion) activate CH at high temperatures (500 C), giving low conversion rates of light alkanes and poor selectivity to corresponding alkenes."
[27] "The exchanged metal ions in zeolites are held ionically by one or more basic oxygen atoms."
[28] "Different species have been suggested, depending on the density of the cation exchange site of the zeolite and method of introduction of the metals."
[29] "According to Kanansky et al. [53] the exchanged Zn and Ga species on H-ZSM-5 and their mechanism of CH activation are distinctively different."
[30] "Zn and Ga are introduced on H-ZSM-5 through a vapor deposition technique using Zn metal vapor and Ga(CH3)3 as the source of Zn and Ga, respectively."
[31] "The metal introduction technique allows quantitative exchange of the zeolite protons which leads to Zn/Al = 0.5 and Ga/Al = 1, respectively."
[32] "Zn2 + is generated directly, but Ga+ is produced by H2 treatment at 500 C to release the methyl groups."
[33] "The proposed active sites are OZn2+O and OGa+, respectively."
[34] "The mechanism of CH activation with ethane by the two sites under the same reaction conditions are summarized in Scheme 2 ."
[35] "The proposed mechanism is in agreement with the mechanism suggested from calculations using the GAUSSIAN 94 program for ethane activation on Zn-exchanged zeolite by Frash and van Santen [54] ."
[36] "In another theoretical study using a DFT cluster modeling approach, Pidko and van Santen [55] compared the activation energy of CH with three types of Zn species at active sites: OZn2+O, OZn+OZn+O and HOZn+ O."
[37] "The authors suggest that the reaction proceeds most easily on OZn2+O, and hypothesize that the enhanced Lewis activity of OZn2+O facilitates CH heterolytic cleavage."
[38] "They further argue that the first proton abstraction occurs preferentially on the oxygen sites neighboring the ring where the cation is located."
[39] "They proposed a one-step reaction to yield H2 and C2H4 from the decomposition of the Zn-alkyl and proton."
[40] "A proposed mechanism of CH activation on OGa+ has similarly been suggested using theoretical calculations [56] ."
[41] "High alkene selectivities are obtained on the H-ZSM-5 when exchangeable protons are rigorously replaced by Zn and Ga."
[42] "The Zn-exchanged H-ZSM-5 had higher ethane conversion rates but lower ethene selectivity than its Ga counterpart [53] ."
[43] "The CH activation on the OZn2+O site can be described by a Lewis base-assisted deprotonation mechanism."
[44] "This is accompanied by conversion of the Lewis base site to a conjugate Bronsted acid site."
[45] "The OGa+ site, however, activates the CH bond via oxidative addition without a protonic site intermediate [57] ."
[46] "A protonic site intermediate increases tendency of side reactions on the Zn-exchanged H-ZSM-5 relative to the Ga counterpart."
[47] "The elementary steps of CH activation on OGa+ ( Scheme 2 ) reveal that a redox cycle at the metal center is required for catalytic CH activation via the oxidative addition mechanism."
[48] "A redox cycle is not apparent in the elementary step presented for CH activation on OZn2+O."
[49] "Hence, a redox cycle is not a requisite for CH activation via the Lewis base-assisted deprotonation mechanism."
[50] "However, under alkane dehydrogenation reaction conditions, the OZn2+O sites can undergo a reversible Zn2 +/Zn redox process ( Scheme 3 ) [58] ."
[51] "This redox process increases the availability of undesired protonic site intermediates."
[52] "Zn-exchanged H-ZSM-5 prepared by conventional ion-exchange methods contain a significant percentage of unexchanged proton sites leading to lower alkene selectivity of the catalyst."
[53] "Iglesia and Biscardi [59] titrate the proton sites with NaOH."
[54] "The un-titrated and the titrated catalysts are denoted as Zn/H-ZSMS-5 and Zn/Na-ZSMS-5, respectively."
[55] "Zn/Na-ZSM-5 has four times the propane conversion rate and a higher propene selectivity than Zn/H-ZSMS-5."
[56] "The propene formation rate obtained with Zn/Na-ZSM-5 was ten times that of Zn/H-ZSMS-5."
[57] "The zinc species at the cation exchange site of the zeolite was identified as OZn+OH."
[58] "The higher propene selectivity obtained on Zn/Na-ZSM-5 compared to Zn/H-ZSM-5 is presumably from the lower density and availability of proton sites on Zn/Na-ZSM-5."
[59] "The improved propane conversion rate of Zn/Na-ZSM-5 compared to Zn/H-ZSM-5 is attributable to the higher efficiency of OZn+OH sites in catalyzing desorption of H-adatoms than OZn2+O sites."
[60] "Another strategy to enhance alkene selectivity is by controlling the strength of the proton sites."
[61] "The acidity of the sites depends on the nature of the trivalent cation of the zeolite framework."
[62] "Proton sites in borosilicate zeolites are weaker than those of aluminosilicate [60] ,[61] ,[62] ,[63] ,[64] , and thus higher alkene selectivity is expected for alkane dehydrogenation over Zn/H[B]-ZSM-5 compared to Zn/H[Al]-ZSM-5."
[63] "However, Zn/H[B]-ZSM-5 shows no activity for propane dehydrogenation."
[64] "The desired weaker acidity of the proton sites of Zn/H[B]-ZSM-5 requires weaker basicity of the oxygen atoms in the zeolite framework."
[65] "This reduced basicity of the oxygen atoms is not sufficiently polarizing to complement the exchanged Zn2 + in CH bond cleavage."
[66] "In the next section, we examine use of zeolite support to design a Pt-based alkane dehydrogenation catalyst."
[67] "Elimination of the proton sites of zeolites is critical for obtaining a high alkene selectivity and stability in dehydrogenation catalysts."
[68] "Pt is the most versatile noble metal catalyst for alkane reactions [65] ."
[69] "Although Pt is expensive, the choice of Pt is often justified by its higher activity, stability and selectivity for these reactions compared to less expensive alternative transition metals."
[70] "However, rapid catalyst deactivation due to coke formation remains a challenge even when using a Pt-based catalyst for dehydrogenation of light alkanes."
[71] "Waku et al. [66] exploited the unique property of zeolite as a support for achieving high metal dispersion through cation exchange sites to create a Pt/Na[Fe]-ZSM-5 catalyst with outstanding stability for dehydrogenation of light alkanes."
[72] "They found that the catalyst deactivation rate of Pt/Na[Fe]-ZSM-5 was lower than for any other Pt-based catalysts in refractory oxide support."
[73] "The unprecedented performance of Pt/Na[Fe]-ZSM-5 was attributed to its high Pt dispersion (cluster size < 1 mm) on zeolite through ion-exchange."
[74] "There is a tendency to generate some Brnsted protons on the zeolite during the exchange process, but the choice of Fe3 + as an isomorphous cation in place of Al3 + led to weaker Brnsted sites in [Fe]-ZSM compared to [Al]-ZSM."
[75] "The weaker acidity minimizes the tendency of side reactions (cracking of oligomerization, aromatisation, and coke), which translates into higher alkene selectivity and catalyst stability."
[76] "In another report, Xuebing and Iglesia [67] demonstrated the ability of Pt/Na[Fe]-ZSM-5 to dehydrogenate alkanes longer than C4; n-pentane and n-heptane were selectively converted to n-pentene and n-heptene, respectively."
[77] "Alkene selectivity was also improved when the residual proton generated during Pt exchange or Na-[Fe]-ZSM was titrated with Cs [67] ."
[78] "Although Pt with conventional refractory oxides (Al2O3, SiO2, ZrO2, etc.) used for dehydrogenation of alkanes has similar conversion rates to Pt/Na[Fe]-ZSM-5, deactivation rates are also rapid due to coke formation."
[79] "The presence of acid (Bronsted and Lewis) sites on the supports promotes readsorption, oligomerization and aromatisation of alkenes."
[80] "Promotion of Pt with metals, such as Sn, Ga, Zn, Re, etc., improves catalyst stability, but also leads to faster deactivation rates than Pt/Na[Fe]-ZSM-5."
[81] "However, recent reports by Bell et al. [68] ,[69] ,[70] show that the use of calcined hydrotalcite (Al/Mg  0.1) supported on bimetallic PtGa or PtSn gave very high alkene selectivity and stability, comparable to Pt/Na[Fe]-ZSM-5."
[82] "At this stage, we can conclude that differences in the performance of Zn and Ga exchanged H-ZSM-5 obtained by Kanansky et al. [53] are attributable to their respective CH activation mechanisms."
[83] "In addition, the role of exchanged Zn and Ga as promoters of RD becomes evident from the mechanisms ( Scheme 2 )."
[84] "The RD mechanism on Ga exchanged H-ZSM-5 is by reductive elimination of a hydrogen molecule from O[Ga(H)2]+ intermediate."
[85] "Decomposition of ZnR and a protonic site, or neutralization of the proton sites by ZnH, leads to desorption of the hydrogen molecule on the Zn-exchanged H-ZSM-5."
[86] "By extrapolation, the mechanisms of CH activation on exchanged Zn and Ga H-ZSM-5 can described the mechanism of alkane dehydrogenation on Cr-based and Pt-based catalysts respectively."
[87] "The electronic promotion effect of Sn is in line with the oxidative addition CH activation mechanism."
[88] "However, the Lewis base-assisted deprotonation mechanism could also explain the proposed CH activation on Cr-based catalysts."
[89] "Now, the nature and the role of surface oxygen species become more evident."
[90] "The role of potassium in commercial Cr and Pt-based dehydrogenation catalysts is to minimize the undesired influence of protonic sites on alkene selectivity."
[91] "The highlights in this section are presented in Table 2 ."
[92] "The table reveals the insights achieved on the reaction mechanism, alkene selectivity and catalyst stability for non-oxidative dehydrogenation of lower alkanes."
[93] "Nonetheless, the level of catalyst activity is still far from acceptable, even at high temperature."
[94] "A recent report by Rothenberg et al. [71] provides a lead in this respect."
[95] "Their report indicates that a porous copperaluminum framework material (stabilized by metal oxide) has better performance (activity/selectivity/stability) for propane dehydrogenation than a PtSn/Al2O3."
[96] "Of particular interest, is the suggestion that achieving propane dehydrogenation at 350 C may be possible."
[97] "Few details are known about the structure of the porous copperaluminum framework material."
[98] "However, copper is implicated as providing the active sites for the catalysis."
[99] "Also, that the material activated in oxygen gave higher propane conversion rates than those activated in inert gas atmosphere underscores the role of the surface oxide (oxygen species) in the catalysis."
[100] "Thus, the Lewis base-assisted deprotonation mechanism may be invoked here, and the redox property of the metal center is likely to play a role in achieving propane dehydrogenation at 350 C."
[101] "This should constitute the future research direction for non-oxidative dehydrogenation of lower alkanes."

1.The physicochemical properties of catalysts, including chemical qualities (such as acid strength and stability) and morphological characteristics, significantly influence their performance in dehydrogenation reactions. The framework of microporous zeolites exerts dispersive forces on reactant molecules, which depend on the shape, channel, and cavity of the framework. The nature and density of active sites also influence the framework dispersion forces. Recent reports have shown that the strong electrostatic field between protons or exchanged metal ions and basic oxygen species can enhance and/or induce polarization of bonds in hydrocarbon adsorbates. This polarization effect can be viewed as an intermediate condition to hydride abstraction, an important elementary step in CH activation. The polarizing effect increases with increasing charge magnitude and ionic radius of the alkane polarizing cations. The choice of cations should be such that they exhibit no catalytic effects on the target alkene products at the reaction condition. It may be beneficial to create a CH polarization effect on the zeolite framework by appropriate modification of framework atoms. Active sites are usually created on the zeolite frameworks. The active sites of the bimolecular pathway are formed in situ and are made up of an alkyl carbenium ion ionically held to the zeolite framework oxygen ion. The active sites of the unimolecular pathway are the charge balancing protons of the zeolite framework. A proton and a carbenium ion are electrophilic or Lewis acid species, and the two pathways essentially involve electrophilic CH activation. The exchanged metal ions in zeolites are held ionically by one or more basic oxygen atoms. Different species have been suggested, depending on the density of the cation exchange site of the zeolite and the method of introduction of the metals. High alkene selectivities are obtained on the H-ZSM-5 when exchangeable protons are rigorously replaced by Zn and Ga. The CH activation on the OZn2+O site can be described by a Lewis base-assisted deprotonation mechanism, accompanied by conversion of the Lewis base site to a conjugate Bronsted acid site. The OGa+ site, however, activates the CH bond via oxidative addition without a protonic site intermediate. A protonic site intermediate increases the tendency of side reactions on the Zn-exchanged H-ZSM-5 relative to the Ga counterpart. The elementary steps of CH activation on OGa+ reveal that a redox cycle at the metal center is required for catalytic CH activation via the oxidative addition mechanism. However, under alkane dehydrogenation reaction conditions, the OZn2+O sites can undergo a reversible Zn2+/Zn redox process, increasing the availability of undesired protonic site intermediates. Zn-exchanged H-ZSM-5 prepared by conventional ion-exchange methods contain a significant percentage of unexchanged proton sites, leading to lower alkene selectivity of the catalyst. Another strategy to enhance alkene selectivity is by controlling the strength of the proton sites. The acidity of the sites depends on the nature of the trivalent cation of the zeolite framework.

The desired weaker acidity of the proton sites of Zn/H[B]-ZSM-5 requires weaker basicity of the oxygen atoms in the zeolite framework. This reduced basicity of the oxygen atoms is not sufficiently polarizing to complement the exchanged Zn2+ in CH bond cleavage. Elimination of the proton sites of zeolites is critical for obtaining a high alkene selectivity and stability in dehydrogenation catalysts. Pt is the most versatile noble metal catalyst for alkane reactions, often justified by its higher activity, stability, and selectivity for these reactions compared to less expensive alternative transition metals.

1.催化剂的物理化学性质，包括化学品质（如酸强度和稳定性）和形态特征，对脱氢反应的性能有重大影响。微孔沸石框架对反应物分子施加分散力，这取决于框架的形状、通道和空腔。活性位点的性质和密度也影响框架的分散力。最近的报告表明，质子或交换金属离子与基本氧物种之间的强静电场可以增强和/或诱导烃吸附物中键的极化。这种极化效应可以视为向氢化物抽离过渡的中间条件，这是CH活化的重要基本步骤。极化效应随着烷基极化阳离子的电荷大小和离子半径的增加而增加。选择的阳离子应确保在反应条件下对目标烯烃产品没有催化作用。在沸石框架上创造CH极化效应可能是有益的，这可以通过适当修改框架原子来实现。活性位点通常在沸石框架上创建。双分子途径的活性位点是原位形成的，由离子结合到沸石框架氧离子的烷基卡宾离子组成。单分子途径的活性位点是沸石框架的质子平衡电荷。质子和卡宾离子是亲电性或路易斯酸性物种，两种途径本质上涉及亲电性CH活化。沸石中交换的金属离子通过一个或多个基本氧原子离子结合。根据沸石的阳离子交换位点密度和金属的引入方法，提出了不同的物种。当可交换的质子被严格替换为Zn和Ga时，H-ZSM-5获得了高烯烃选择性。OZn2+O位点上的CH活化可以通过路易斯碱辅助脱质子机制来描述，伴随路易斯碱位点转化为共轭布龙斯特酸位点。然而，OGa+位点通过氧化加成而不是质子位点中间体活化CH键。质子位点中间体增加了Zn交换的H-ZSM-5相对于Ga对应物的副反应倾向。OGa+的CH活化基本步骤揭示，金属中心的氧化还原循环是通过氧化加成机制催化CH活化所必需的。然而，在烷烃脱氢反应条件下，OZn2+O位点可以经历可逆的Zn2+/Zn氧化还原过程，增加了不希望的质子位点中间体的可用性。通过传统离子交换方法制备的Zn交换H-ZSM-5含有大量未交换的质子位点，导致催化剂的烯烃选择性降低。另一种增强烯烃选择性的策略是控制质子位点的强度。位点的酸性取决于沸石框架的三价阳离子的性质。硼硅酸盐沸石中的质子位点比铝硅酸盐弱，因此预计Zn/H[B]-ZSM-5在烷烃脱氢中的烯烃选择性高于Zn/H[Al]-ZSM-5。然而，Zn/H[B]-ZSM-5在丙烷脱氢中没有活性。Zn/H[B]-ZSM-5中所需较弱的质子位点酸性需要沸石框架中氧原子的较弱碱性。这种氧原子碱性的降低不足以补充交换的Zn2+在CH键断裂中的作用。消除沸石的质子位点对于获得高烯烃选择性和脱氢催化剂的稳定性至关重要。Pt是烷烃反应中最通用的贵金属催化剂，通常因其在这些反应中的较高活性、稳定性和选择性而被证明是合理的，与成本较低的替代过渡金属相比。然而，即使使用Pt基催化剂进行轻烷烃脱氢，由于焦炭形成导致的催化剂失活速度仍然很快。支持物上的酸（布龙斯特和路易斯）位点促进了烯烃的再吸附、寡聚化和芳构化。Pt与Sn、Ga、Zn、Re等金属的促进提高了催化剂的稳定性，但与Pt/Na[Fe]-ZSM-5相比，失活速度也更快。商业Cr和Pt基脱氢催化剂中钾的作用是最大限度地减少质子位点对烯烃选择性的不利影响。表面氧物种的性质和作用变得更加明显。Sn的电子促进效应与氧化加成CH活化机制一致。然而，路易斯碱辅助脱质子机制也可以解释在Cr基催化剂上提出的CH活化。最近的一份报告表明，一种多孔铜铝框架材料（由金属氧化物稳定）在丙烷脱氢中的性能（活性/选择性/稳定性）优于PtSn/Al2O3。可以在此处调用路易斯碱辅助脱质子机制，金属中心的氧化还原性质可能在实现350°C下的丙烷脱氢中发挥作用。这应该是非氧化脱氢较低烷烃的未来研究方向。
