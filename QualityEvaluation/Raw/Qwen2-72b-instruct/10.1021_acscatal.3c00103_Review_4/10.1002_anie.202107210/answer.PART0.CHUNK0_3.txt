[1] "The geometric and electronic effects are known to be pivotal to most catalytic systems, including the PDH one."
[2] "Regarding the geometric effect, a catalyst design that is based on the alloying of Pt is generally applied."
[3] "Furthermore, PDH is a structure-insensitive reaction, whereas, side reactions, such as hydrogenolysis, isomerization, and polymerization, are structure-sensitive reactions."
[4] "The ensemble effect can also be maximized by completely isolating the Pt atoms by the second metals, thus favoring the first and second CH scissions, whereas the subsequent CH scission would be successfully inhibited."
[5] "As well as the geometric property, the electronic properties of Pt contribute to the adsorption strength of propylene on the Pt site."
[6] "For instance, an increase in the electron density of Pt induces its electrostatic repulsion to propylene, thereby promoting propylene desorption and improving stability."
[7] "Hence, tuning the electronic properties of Pt can be another approach for increasing the lifetime of PDH catalysts."
[8] "Therefore, the double modification of PtGa to synergize the geometric and electronic promotion effects can be a promising catalyst design concept to construct an ultra-stable catalytic system for PDH."
[9] "Crucially, the considered geometric and electronic effects for the double decoration concept should be compatible and not change the parent PtGa intermetallic structure."
[10] "Scheme1 shows a possible approach that satisfies this guideline."
[11] "The surface of the intermetallic PtGa nanoparticles on SiO2 was decorated with Pb for the geometric modification to block the Pt3 sites."
[12] "Moreover, a certain alkali or alkaline earth cation, such as Ca2+, is deposited around the PtGa nanoparticles as an electron-donating agent."
[13] "Hence, the resulting electron-enriched Pt1 site is expected to function as an ideal active site that can almost perfectly suppress side reactions in PDH."

1.The geometric and electronic effects are crucial for catalytic systems, including propane dehydrogenation (PDH). Geometric effects are achieved through the alloying of platinum (Pt), which can isolate Pt atoms and inhibit undesired side reactions. PDH is structure-insensitive, but side reactions are structure-sensitive. Electronic effects involve tuning the electron density of Pt to promote propylene desorption and improve stability. The double modification of PtGa intermetallics with Pb and Ca synergizes geometric and electronic effects without altering the parent PtGa structure. Pb blocks Pt3 sites, while Ca donates electrons to create an electron-enriched Pt1 site that suppresses side reactions.

1.几何和电子效应对于催化系统，包括丙烷脱氢（PDH）至关重要。几何效应通过铂（Pt）的合金化实现，可以隔离Pt原子并抑制不需要的副反应。PDH是结构不敏感的，但副反应是结构敏感的。电子效应涉及调整Pt的电子密度，以促进丙烯的解吸并提高稳定性。PtGa金属间化合物的双重改性，即Pb和Ca的协同作用，不会改变母体PtGa结构，同时协同几何和电子效应。Pb阻塞Pt3位点，而Ca捐赠电子以创建一个几乎可以完全抑制PDH中副反应的电子富集Pt1位点。
