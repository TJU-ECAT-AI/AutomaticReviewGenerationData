[1] "PtGaCaPb/SiO2 exhibited outstanding catalytic stability in PDH at 600C, and almost no deactivation was observed for up to 1month."
[2] "The geometric and electronic effects are known to be pivotal to most catalytic systems, including the PDH one."
[3] "Thus, the dilution of such ensembles (also known as the ensemble effect) by alloying Pt with inactive metals such as Sn,4-6 Ga,7-9 In,10 and Zn11, 12 has been generally applied to prevent side reactions."
[4] "Hence, tuning the electronic properties of Pt can be another approach for increasing the lifetime of PDH catalysts."
[5] "Therefore, the double modification of PtGa to synergize the geometric and electronic promotion effects can be a promising catalyst design concept to construct an ultra-stable catalytic system for PDH."
[6] "The surface of the intermetallic PtGa nanoparticles on SiO2 was decorated with Pb for the geometric modification to block the Pt3 sites."
[7] "Moreover, a certain alkali or alkaline earth cation, such as Ca2+,26-28 is deposited around the PtGa nanoparticles as an electron-donating agent."
[8] "Hence, the resulting electron-enriched Pt1 site is expected to function as an ideal active site that can almost perfectly suppress side reactions in PDH."
[9] "PtGaCaPb/SiO2 was barely deactivated for 1 month at least, thus highlighting its much greater stability compared with those of previously reported catalysts."

1.The physicochemical properties of catalysts, including chemical qualities and morphological characteristics, significantly influence their performance in dehydrogenation reactions. The geometric and electronic effects are crucial to catalytic systems, and the ensemble effect, achieved by alloying Pt with inactive metals, can prevent side reactions. Tuning the electronic properties of Pt can also increase the lifetime of PDH catalysts. The double modification of PtGa, which synergizes the geometric and electronic promotion effects, is a promising design concept for constructing ultra-stable catalytic systems for PDH. The geometric modification involves decorating the surface of intermetallic PtGa nanoparticles on SiO2 with Pb to block the Pt3 sites, while the electronic modification involves depositing an alkali or alkaline earth cation, such as Ca2+, around the PtGa nanoparticles as an electron-donating agent. The electron-enriched Pt1 site resulting from these modifications can almost perfectly suppress side reactions in PDH. The PtGaCaPb/SiO2 catalyst, which exhibits outstanding catalytic stability in PDH at 600C, demonstrates the effectiveness of this design concept.

1.催化剂的物理化学性质，包括化学品质和形态特征，对脱氢反应的性能有重大影响。几何和电子效应对于催化系统至关重要，通过将Pt与惰性金属合金化实现的集合效应可以防止副反应。调整Pt的电子性质也可以延长PDH催化剂的寿命。PtGa的双重改性，即协同几何和电子促进效应，是构建超稳定PDH催化系统的有希望的设计概念。几何改性涉及在SiO2上的PtGa纳米粒子表面用Pb进行装饰，以阻塞Pt3位点，而电子改性涉及在PtGa纳米粒子周围沉积碱金属或碱土金属阳离子，如Ca2+，作为电子供体。这些改性产生的电子丰富的Pt1位点几乎可以完全抑制PDH中的副反应。PtGaCaPb/SiO2催化剂在600C下表现出优异的催化稳定性，证明了这一设计概念的有效性。
