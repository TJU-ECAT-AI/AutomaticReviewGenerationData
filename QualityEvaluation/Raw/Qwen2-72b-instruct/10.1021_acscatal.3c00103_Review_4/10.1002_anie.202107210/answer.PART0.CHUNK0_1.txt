[1] "PtGaCaPb/SiO2 exhibited outstanding catalytic stability in PDH at 600C, and almost no deactivation was observed for up to 1month."
[2] "The geometric and electronic effects are known to be pivotal to most catalytic systems, including the PDH one."
[3] "Thus, materials possessing isolated Pt sites with high thermal stability should be utilized for continuous working at a high temperature (600C)."
[4] "As well as the geometric property, the electronic properties of Pt contribute to the adsorption strength of propylene on the Pt site."
[5] "Hence, tuning the electronic properties of Pt can be another approach for increasing the lifetime of PDH catalysts."
[6] "Therefore, the double modification of PtGa to synergize the geometric and electronic promotion effects can be a promising catalyst design concept to construct an ultra-stable catalytic system for PDH."
[7] "The surface of the intermetallic PtGa nanoparticles on SiO2 was decorated with Pb for the geometric modification to block the Pt3 sites."
[8] "Moreover, a certain alkali or alkaline earth cation, such as Ca2+, is deposited around the PtGa nanoparticles as an electron-donating agent."
[9] "The resulting electron-enriched Pt1 site is expected to function as an ideal active site that can almost perfectly suppress side reactions in PDH."
[10] "This strategy enabled the synergy of the geometric and electronic promotion effects without changing the parent PtGa structure, thereby affording, for the first time, an innovative catalyst with outstandingly high catalytic stability in PDH for up to 1month at 600C."

1.The physicochemical properties of catalysts, including chemical qualities and morphological characteristics, significantly influence their performance in dehydrogenation reactions. The geometric and electronic effects are crucial to catalytic systems, particularly in propane dehydrogenation (PDH). The geometric effect involves the isolation of Pt atoms to prevent side reactions, while the electronic effect relates to the adsorption strength of propylene on the Pt site. By tuning these properties, the lifetime of PDH catalysts can be increased. The double decoration of PtGa intermetallics with Pb and Ca is a promising catalyst design concept that synergizes the geometric and electronic promotion effects, leading to an ultra-stable catalytic system for PDH. Pb is used for geometric modification to block Pt3 sites, while Ca acts as an electron-donating agent to enrich the electron density of Pt1 sites, suppressing side reactions. This strategy results in a catalyst with outstanding stability in PDH for up to 1 month at 600C.

1.催化剂的物理化学性质，包括化学品质和形态特征，对脱氢反应的性能有重大影响。几何和电子效应对于催化系统至关重要，特别是在丙烷脱氢（PDH）中。几何效应涉及隔离Pt原子以防止副反应，而电子效应与丙烯在Pt位点的吸附强度有关。通过调整这些性质，可以延长PDH催化剂的寿命。PtGa金属间化合物的双重装饰与Pb和Ca是很有前景的催化剂设计概念，它协同了几何和电子促进效应，导致PDH的超稳定催化系统。Pb用于几何修饰以阻塞Pt3位点，而Ca作为电子供体，增加Pt1位点的电子密度，抑制副反应。这种策略导致在600C下PDH长达1个月的稳定性。
