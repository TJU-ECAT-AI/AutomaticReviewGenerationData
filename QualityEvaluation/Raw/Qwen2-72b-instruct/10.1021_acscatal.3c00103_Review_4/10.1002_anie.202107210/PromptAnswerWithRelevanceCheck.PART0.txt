[2] "The geometric and electronic effects are known to be pivotal to most catalytic systems, including the PDH one."
[3] "Pb is deposited on the three-fold Pt3 sites of the PtGa nanoparticles to block them, whereas Ca, which affords an electron-enriched single-atom-like Pt1 site, is placed around the nanoparticles."
[4] "Thus, PtGaCaPb/SiO2 exhibits an outstandingly high catalytic stability, even at 600C (kd=0.00033h1, τ=3067h), and almost no deactivation of the catalyst was observed for up to 1month for the first time."

[6] "Hence, tuning the electronic properties of Pt can be another approach for increasing the lifetime of PDH catalysts."
[7] "Therefore, the double modification of PtGa to synergize the geometric and electronic promotion effects can be a promising catalyst design concept to construct an ultra-stable catalytic system for PDH."

1.The physicochemical properties of catalysts, including chemical qualities and morphological characteristics, significantly influence their performance in dehydrogenation reactions. The geometric and electronic effects are crucial to most catalytic systems, including propane dehydrogenation (PDH). The double decoration of PtGa intermetallics by Pb and Ca synergizes the geometric and electronic promotion effects, leading to outstanding catalytic stability in PDH at high temperatures. Pb is deposited on the three-fold Pt3 sites of the PtGa nanoparticles to block them, while Ca, which provides an electron-enriched single-atom-like Pt1 site, is placed around the nanoparticles. This design results in an ultra-stable catalyst with almost no deactivation observed for up to one month at 600C. The ensemble effect can be maximized by isolating the Pt atoms, favoring the first and second CH scissions while inhibiting subsequent CH scissions. Tuning the electronic properties of Pt can also increase the lifetime of PDH catalysts. The double modification of PtGa to synergize the geometric and electronic promotion effects is a promising catalyst design concept for constructing an ultra-stable catalytic system for PDH. The surface of the intermetallic PtGa nanoparticles on SiO2 is decorated with Pb for geometric modification to block the Pt3 sites, while an alkali or alkaline earth cation, such as Ca2+, is deposited around the PtGa nanoparticles as an electron-donating agent. The resulting electron-enriched Pt1 site functions as an ideal active site that can almost perfectly suppress side reactions in PDH.

1.催化剂的物理化学性质，包括化学品质和形态特征，对脱氢反应的性能有重大影响。几何和电子效应对于大多数催化系统，包括丙烷脱氢（PDH）至关重要。PtGa金属间化合物的Pb和Ca双修饰协同了几何和电子促进效应，导致在高温下PDH的催化稳定性显著。Pb沉积在PtGa纳米颗粒的三重Pt3位点上以阻塞它们，而Ca，提供电子丰富的单原子Pt1位点，被放置在纳米颗粒周围。这种设计产生了一个超稳定的催化剂，在600C下几乎观察不到一个月的失活。通过隔离Pt原子，可以最大化集合效应，有利于第一和第二CH断裂，同时抑制后续的CH断裂。调整Pt的电子性质也可以增加PDH催化剂的寿命。PtGa的双修饰以协同几何和电子促进效应是构建PDH超稳定催化系统的有希望的催化剂设计概念。在SiO2上的金属间PtGa纳米颗粒表面用Pb进行几何修饰以阻塞Pt3位点，而碱金属或碱土金属阳离子，如Ca2+，作为电子供体沉积在PtGa纳米颗粒周围。由此产生的电子丰富的Pt1位点作为一个理想的活性位点，可以几乎完全抑制PDH中的副反应。

1.The geometric and electronic effects are crucial for catalytic systems, including propane dehydrogenation (PDH). Geometric effects are achieved through the alloying of platinum (Pt), which can isolate Pt atoms and inhibit undesired side reactions. PDH is structure-insensitive, but side reactions are structure-sensitive. Electronic effects involve tuning the electron density of Pt to promote propylene desorption and improve stability. The double modification of PtGa intermetallics with Pb and Ca synergizes geometric and electronic effects without altering the parent PtGa structure. Pb blocks Pt3 sites, while Ca donates electrons to create an electron-enriched Pt1 site that suppresses side reactions.
