[1] "PtGaCaPb/SiO2 exhibited outstanding catalytic stability in PDH at 600C, and almost no deactivation was observed for up to 1month."
[2] "The geometric and electronic effects are known to be pivotal to most catalytic systems, including the PDH one."
[3] "Regarding the geometric effect, a catalyst design that is based on the alloying of Pt is generally applied."
[4] "The ensemble effect can also be maximized by completely isolating the Pt atoms by the second metals, thus favoring the first and second CH scissions, whereas the subsequent CH scission would be successfully inhibited."
[5] "As well as the geometric property, the electronic properties of Pt contribute to the adsorption strength of propylene on the Pt site."
[6] "Hence, tuning the electronic properties of Pt can be another approach for increasing the lifetime of PDH catalysts."
[7] "Therefore, the double modification of PtGa to synergize the geometric and electronic promotion effects can be a promising catalyst design concept to construct an ultra-stable catalytic system for PDH."
[8] "Crucially, the considered geometric and electronic effects for the double decoration concept should be compatible and not change the parent PtGa intermetallic structure."
[9] "The surface of the intermetallic PtGa nanoparticles on SiO2 was decorated with Pb for the geometric modification to block the Pt3 sites."
[10] "Moreover, a certain alkali or alkaline earth cation, such as Ca2+, is deposited around the PtGa nanoparticles as an electron-donating agent."
[11] "The resulting electron-enriched Pt1 site is expected to function as an ideal active site that can almost perfectly suppress side reactions in PDH."
[12] "The effects of these modifications were synergistic and remarkably improved the catalytic stability in PDH."
[13] "The PtGaCaPb/SiO2 catalyst exhibited much superior stability to those of reported PDH catalysts (month-long stability, even at 600C) was achieved."

1.The physicochemical properties of catalysts, including chemical qualities and morphological characteristics, significantly influence their performance in dehydrogenation reactions. The geometric and electronic effects are pivotal to catalytic systems, particularly in propane dehydrogenation (PDH). Geometric effects can be optimized through alloying Pt, maximizing the ensemble effect by isolating Pt atoms with second metals to inhibit undesired side reactions. Electronic properties of Pt, such as adsorption strength of propylene, can be tuned to increase the lifetime of PDH catalysts. The double modification of PtGa, synergizing geometric and electronic promotion effects, constructs an ultra-stable catalytic system for PDH. Pb decoration on PtGa nanoparticles blocks Pt3 sites for geometric modification, while Ca deposition around the nanoparticles as an electron-donating agent enriches the electronic properties of Pt. These modifications are synergistic, remarkably improving catalytic stability in PDH. PtGaCaPb/SiO2 exhibits superior stability compared to reported PDH catalysts, achieving month-long stability even at 600C.

1.催化剂的物理化学性质，包括化学品质和形态特征，对脱氢反应的性能有重大影响。几何和电子效应对于催化系统，特别是丙烷脱氢（PDH）至关重要。通过合金化Pt，可以优化几何效应，通过第二金属隔离Pt原子最大化集合效应，以抑制不希望的副反应。Pt的电子性质，如丙烯的吸附强度，可以通过调整来增加PDH催化剂的寿命。PtGa的双重修饰，协同几何和电子促进效应，构建了PDH的超稳定催化系统。Pb修饰在PtGa纳米颗粒上堵塞Pt3位点，实现几何修饰，而Ca在PtGa纳米颗粒周围作为电子供体沉积，丰富了Pt的电子性质。这些修饰是协同的，显著提高了PDH中的催化稳定性。PtGaCaPb/SiO2的稳定性优于报道的PDH催化剂，即使在600C下也能实现长达一个月的稳定性。
