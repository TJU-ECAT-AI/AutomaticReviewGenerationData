          [1] "PtGaCaPb/SiO2 exhibited outstanding catalytic stability in PDH at 600C, and almost no deactivation was observed for up to 1month."
          [2] "The geometric and electronic effects are known to be pivotal to most catalytic systems, including the PDH one."
          [3] "Pb is deposited on the three-fold Pt3 sites of the PtGa nanoparticles to block them, whereas Ca, which affords an electron-enriched single-atom-like Pt1 site, is placed around the nanoparticles."
          [4] "Thus, PtGaCaPb/SiO2 exhibits an outstandingly high catalytic stability, even at 600C (kd=0.00033h1, τ=3067h), and almost no deactivation of the catalyst was observed for up to 1month for the first time."
          [5] "The ensemble effect can also be maximized by completely isolating the Pt atoms by the second metals, thus favoring the first and second CH scissions, whereas the subsequent CH scission would be successfully inhibited."
          [6] "Hence, tuning the electronic properties of Pt can be another approach for increasing the lifetime of PDH catalysts."
          [7] "Therefore, the double modification of PtGa to synergize the geometric and electronic promotion effects can be a promising catalyst design concept to construct an ultra-stable catalytic system for PDH."
          [8] "The surface of the intermetallic PtGa nanoparticles on SiO2 was decorated with Pb for the geometric modification to block the Pt3 sites."
          [9] "Moreover, a certain alkali or alkaline earth cation, such as Ca2+,26-28 is deposited around the PtGa nanoparticles as an electron-donating agent."
          [10] "The resulting electron-enriched Pt1 site is expected to function as an ideal active site that can almost perfectly suppress side reactions in PDH."

          The physicochemical properties of catalysts, including chemical qualities and morphological characteristics, significantly influence their performance in dehydrogenation reactions. The geometric and electronic effects are crucial to catalytic systems, particularly in propane dehydrogenation (PDH). The double decoration of PtGa intermetallics with Pb and Ca is a promising catalyst design concept that synergizes the geometric and electronic promotion effects, leading to an ultra-stable catalytic system for PDH. Pb is used for geometric modification to block Pt3 sites, while Ca acts as an electron-donating agent to enrich the electron density of Pt1 sites, suppressing side reactions. This strategy results in a catalyst with outstanding stability in PDH for up to 1 month at 600C.

          催化剂的物理化学性质，包括化学品质和形态特征，对脱氢反应的性能有重大影响。几何和电子效应对于催化系统至关重要，特别是在丙烷脱氢（PDH）中。PtGa金属间化合物的双重装饰与Pb和Ca是很有前景的催化剂设计概念，它协同了几何和电子促进效应，导致PDH的超稳定催化系统。Pb用于几何修饰以阻塞Pt3位点，而Ca作为电子供体，增加Pt1位点的电子密度，抑制副反应。这种策略导致在600C下PDH长达1个月的稳定性。
