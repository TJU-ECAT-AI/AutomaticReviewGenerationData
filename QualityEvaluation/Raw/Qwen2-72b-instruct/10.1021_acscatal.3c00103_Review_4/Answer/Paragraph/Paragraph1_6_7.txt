Mesoporous materials and MXenes offer more active sites and less coke deposition \[10.1039/D0CS00814A\]. Carbon materials, like nanotubes and graphene, are stable and inert supports \[10.1039/D0CS00814A\]. Each support has unique effects on catalytic properties, influencing selectivity and stability \[10.1039/D0CS00814A\].

    Catalyst properties, including chemical qualities and morphological characteristics, significantly impact dehydrogenation reactions \[10.1021/cr5002436\]. The surface area-to-metal loading ratio influences vanadium species formation, affecting catalytic activity \[10.1021/cr5002436\
