The physicochemical properties of catalysts, including chemical qualities and morphological characteristics, significantly influence dehydrogenation reactions, particularly propane dehydrogenation (PDH) \[10.1016/j.cej.2020.126656\]. The addition of Ca to Al2O3 reduces acid centers and enhances alloy formation, boosting propylene selectivity and stability. The Ca-promoted catalyst displays lower deactivation rates and higher residual activity at 600°C compared to the non-promoted sample, indicating improved resistance to coke formation \[10.1016/j.cej.2020.126656\]. This catalyst has a slightly higher activation energy, leading to reduced initial activity but superior performance in terms of activity and selectivity at steady state conditions \[10.1016/j.cej.2020.126656\].

Lewis acid sites from unsaturated AlIII in Al2O3 are crucial for dehydrogenation reactions, with γ-Al2O3-200 exhibiting the highest yield due to its high level of strong acid sites \[10.1039/D0CY00779J\].
