Mg modification disperses V2O5 crystallites and increases active V3+ species, improving catalytic performance and anti-coking capability \[10.1039/D1GC03700E\].

In dehydrogenation reactions, higher temperatures increase alkane conversion but decrease alkene selectivity due to dehydrocyclization, aromatization, cracking, and coke formation \[10.1016/j.fuproc.2016.04.016\]. PtSn interactions on support materials vary with the impregnation sequence \[10.1016/j.fuproc.2016.04.016\]. Zeolite frameworks exert dispersive forces on reactants, influenced by framework shape and active site density \[10.1016/j.fuproc.2016.04.016\]. Electrostatic fields between protons and metal ions enhance CH bond polarization, aiding hydride abstraction in CH activation \[10.1016/j.fuproc.2016.04.016\]. Polarization effects increase with cation charge and radius, and strategic cation choice avoids catalytic effects on alkene products \[10.1016/j.fuproc.2016.04.016\]. Creating CH polarization on zeolite frameworks by modifying framework atoms can enhance catalytic performance \[10.1016/j.fuproc.2016.04.016\].

The stability of metal oxides influenced by the zeolite framework and the effect of zeolite pore size on catalytic activity are critical for dehydrogenation reactions \[10.1039/C5SC01227A\].

In PDH, catalyst properties like geometric and electronic effects are critical \[10.1002/anie.202107210\]. The double modification of PtGa intermetallics with Pb for geometric blocking of Pt3 sites and Ca for electronic enrichment of Pt1 sites optimizes these effects \[10.1002/anie.202107210\]. This strategy creates an ultra-stable catalytic system, as evidenced by PtGaCaPb/SiO2's outstanding stability in PDH for up to 1 month at high temperatures, with almost no deactivation observed \[10.1002/anie.202107210\].

In dehydrogenation reactions, the acidity of supports significantly impacts the electronic properties of supported metals like Pt, and vice versa \[10.1021/jp055754k\]. Increased support acidity enhances Pt's electronic properties, while Pt's presence reduces the strength of the support's acid sites, affecting pyridine desorption and suppressing cracking reactions during decalin ring opening \[10.1021/jp055754k\]. These metal-acid site interactions can enhance catalytic efficiency and selectivity in reactions requiring both active sites \[10.1021/jp055754k\].

Support modification strategies, summarized in Table 3, aim to optimize these properties for improved catalytic performance \[10.1021/acscatal.3c00103_4\]. Zeolites' Lewis acid sites are optimal for propane dehydrogenation, whereas Brnsted acid sites favor cleavage reactions \[10.1021/acscatal.3c00103_4\]. Enhancing catalytic efficiency involves developing nanosized supports and specific morphologies with high external surfaces \[10.1021/acscatal.3c00103_4\].

The physicochemical properties of catalysts, including chemical qualities and morphological characteristics, significantly influence dehydrogenation reactions, as highlighted by studies on Ca-promoted catalysts \[10.1016/j.cej.2020.126656\]. Reducing acid centers and increasing alloy formation through Ca addition enhances propylene selectivity and stability, with lower deactivation rates and higher residual activity observed at 600 C. This modification slightly increases activation energy, initially reducing activity but improving resistance against coke-induced deactivation, thus optimizing steady-state performance and selectivity.

                    Lewis acid sites, originating from unsaturated AlIII in Al2O3, are pivotal for dehydrogenation reactions, particularly in propane conversion \[10.1039/D0CY00779J\]. γ-Al2O3, with a higher density of Lewis acid sites than θ-Al2O3, exhibits superior activity. The γ-Al2O3-200 catalyst, characterized by a high yield and regenerability, is sustainable for industrial propane dehydrogenation.

                    Catalyst properties, including silanol nests in zeolites synthesized using a diammonium-type bromide surfactant and sodium-free silica, significantly impact dehydrogenation reactions \[10.1016/j.jcat.2021.09.011\]. These nests facilitate the formation of Pt3Y alloy nanoparticles, which exhibit high catalytic durability, propane conversion, and propylene selectivity. Pt3Y shows fully reversible hydrogen chemisorption at room temperature, unlike monometallic Pt. Catalysts on silanol nest-containing zeolites have an activation period to reach full conversion, with propane conversion exceeding equilibrium values initially. Strategic support modification, such as using specific surfactants and silica sources, optimizes zeolite properties for enhanced catalytic efficiency and selectivity in dehydrogenation reactions.

                    CrOx on high-silica HZSM-5 zeolite with a SiO2/Al2O3 ratio of 260 excels in PDH, showcasing high activity, selectivity, and stability \[10.1016/j.jechem.2019.12.010\]. Cr loading and SiO2/Al2O3 ratio significantly affect catalytic performance. Brnsted acid sites in HZSM-5 enhance propane adsorption and CH bond activation, critical for high catalytic efficiency. HZSM-5's high surface area and well-defined pores facilitate Cr species dispersion and stabilization, ensuring activity and stability. Support choice is pivotal for Cr-based catalysts in PDH, with zeolites offering optimal acidic sites for performance.

                    Catalyst properties, including chemical qualities and morphological characteristics, significantly impact dehydrogenation reactions. The crystallization temperature of supports, like Al2O3, influences catalytic performance by affecting Lewis acid sites and surface V species distribution \[10.1039/D1GC03700E\]. P and Mg modifications can enhance VOx/Al2O3 catalyst stability and anti-coking capability. VOx/ZrO2 exhibits higher activity due to facile reduction of VO, VOV, and VOZr bonds, producing more active V3+ species. The balance of acid and base sites is crucial for all dehydrogenation methods. Developing active, selective, and stable catalysts is essential for dehydrogenation's viability.

                    Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: The advancements and findings discussed in the file underscore the pivotal role of catalyst physicochemical properties in dehydrogenation reactions. The strategic modification of supports, such as the addition of Ca to reduce acid centers and increase alloy formation, the use of γ-Al2O3 with a higher density of Lewis acid sites, and the synthesis of silanol nests in zeolites, optimizes catalytic efficiency and selectivity. These strategies enhance resistance against deactivation, improve steady-state performance, and facilitate the formation of stable and durable catalysts. Future research endeavors might focus on the development of novel support materials with tailored acidity and morphology, the exploration of emerging metal-support interactions for enhanced stability and selectivity, and the investigation of innovative synthesis methods to create catalysts with optimized physicochemical properties. The integration of computational methods with experimental studies could provide deeper insights into the molecular mechanisms of dehydrogenation reactions, guiding the design of more efficient and selective catalysts. Additionally, the study of metal center redox properties in copper-aluminum framework materials for propane dehydrogenation at lower temperatures suggests a promising direction for non-oxidative dehydrogenation of lower alkanes, which could potentially revolutionize the catalytic processes in the petrochemical industry.
