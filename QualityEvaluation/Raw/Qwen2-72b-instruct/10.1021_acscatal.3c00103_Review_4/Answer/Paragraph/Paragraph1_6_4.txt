The influence of catalyst physicochemical properties on dehydrogenation reactions, particularly propane dehydrogenation (PDH), is profound, with strategic support modification playing a pivotal role in optimizing catalytic performance \[10.1016/j.cej.2020.126656\]. Reduced acid centers and increased alloy formation, achieved through Ca addition, significantly enhance propylene selectivity and stability \[10.1016/j.cej.2020.126656\]. This modification leads to lower deactivation rates and higher residual activity at high temperatures, indicating improved resistance against coke-induced deactivation \[10.1016/j.cej.2020.126656\]. The slightly higher activation energy for Ca-promoted catalysts, due to enhanced GeOx reduction and Pt-Ge alloy formation, initially decreases activity but results in better steady-state performance in terms of both activity and selectivity \[10.1016/j.cej.2020.126656\].

Lewis acid sites, originating from unsaturated AlIII in Al2O3, are critical for dehydrogenation reactions, particularly in propane conversion \[10.1039/D0CY00779J\]. γ-Al2O3, with a higher density of Lewis acid sites than θ-Al2O3, exhibits superior activity in PDH \[10.1039/D0CY00779J\]. The γ-Al2O3-200 catalyst, characterized by a high yield and regenerability, is sustainable for industrial PDH \[10.1039/D0CY00779J\]. Support modification strategies can optimize these properties, enhancing catalytic efficiency and selectivity \[10.1039/D0CY00779J\].

Strategic support modification, such as using specific surfactants and silica sources, optimizes zeolite properties for enhanced catalytic efficiency and selectivity in dehydrogenation reactions \[10.1016/j.jcat.2021.09.011\]. This modification facilitates the formation of Pt3Y alloy nanoparticles, which exhibit high catalytic durability, propane conversion, and propylene selectivity \[10.1016/j.jcat.2021.09.011\]. These nanoparticles show fully reversible hydrogen chemisorption at room temperature, unlike monometallic Pt \[10.1016/j.jcat.2021.09.011\]. Catalysts on silanol nest-containing zeolites have an activation period to reach full conversion, with propane conversion exceeding equilibrium values initially \[10.1016/j.jcat.2021.09.011\].

CrOx on high-silica HZSM-5 (Cr/Z-5(260)), synthesized by wet impregnation, exhibits high activity, selectivity, and stability for PDH \[10.1016/j.jechem.2019.12.010\]. Cr species and Brnsted acid sites are pivotal, enhancing propane adsorption and activation \[10.1016/j.jechem.2019.12.010\]. Zeolite supports, particularly HZSM-5, offer a unique environment for catalysis, with Brnsted acid sites enhancing propane adsorption and activation \[10.1016/j.jechem.2019.12.010\]. Cr loading on HZSM-5 does not affect its crystallite structure, while acidity properties are crucial for catalytic performance \[10.1016/j.jechem.2019.12.010\].

Catalyst properties, including chemical qualities and morphological characteristics, significantly impact dehydrogenation reactions \[10.1039/D1GC03700E\]. The crystallization temperature of supports affects VOx/Al2O3 catalyst performance by increasing Lewis acid sites and altering surface V species distribution \[10.1039/D1GC03700E\]. P modification decreases VOx polymerization, enhancing stability and activity \[10.1039/D1GC03700E\]. Mg modification disperses V2O5 crystallites and increases active V3+ species, enhancing anti-coking capability and catalytic performance \[10.1039/D1GC03700E\]. VOx/ZrO2 is more active than VOx/Al2O3 due to the facile reduction of VO, VOV, and VOZr bonds, producing higher proportions of active V3+ species \[10.1039/D1GC03700E\]. The balance of acid and base sites on the catalyst surface is crucial for all dehydrogenation methods \[10.1039/D1GC03700E\].

Catalyst properties, including chemical and morphological aspects, significantly influence dehydrogenation reactions \[10.1016/j.fuproc.2016.04.016\]. Higher temperatures increase alkane conversion but decrease alkene selectivity due to increased dehydrocyclization, aromatization, cracking, and coke formation \[10.1016/j.fuproc.2016.04.016\]. PtSn interactions on support materials vary with the impregnation sequence \[10.1016/j.fuproc.2016.04.016\]. Zeolite frameworks exert dispersive forces on reactants, influenced by the framework's shape, channel, and cavity \[10.1016/j.fuproc.2016.04.016\]. Active site nature and density affect framework dispersion forces \[10.1016/j.fuproc.2016.04.016\]. Electrostatic fields between protons or metal ions and oxygen species enhance hydrocarbon bond polarization, aiding hydride abstraction in CH activation \[10.1016/j.fuproc.2016.04.016\]. Polarizing effects increase with cation charge and radius \[10.1016/j.fuproc.2016.04.016\]. Cation choice should prevent catalytic effects on alkene products \[10.1016/j.fuproc.2016.04.016\]. Creating CH polarization on zeolite frameworks by modifying framework atoms can be beneficial \[10.1016/j.fuproc.2016.04.016\]. Active sites are typically formed on zeolite frameworks, involving alkyl carbenium ions or charge balancing protons \[10.1016/j.fuproc.2016.04.016\]. Electrophilic CH activation occurs via proton or carbenium ion \[10.1016/j.fuproc.2016.04.016\]. CH activation on OZn2+O follows a Lewis base-assisted deprotonation mechanism, while OGa+ activates CH via oxidative addition \[10.1016/j.fuproc.2016.04.016\]. Protonic site intermediates increase side reactions on Zn-exchanged H-ZSM-5 \[10.1016/j.fuproc.2016.04.016\]. Zn/H-ZSM-5 with unexchanged proton sites shows lower alkene selectivity \[10.1016/j.fuproc.2016.04.016\]. Borosilicate zeolites have weaker proton sites than aluminosilicates, potentially enhancing alkene selectivity for alkane dehydrogenation \[10.1016/j.fuproc.2016.04.016\]. Eliminating proton sites in zeolites is crucial for high alkene selectivity and stability \[10.1016/j.fuproc.2016.04.016\]. Pt catalysts offer high activity, stability, and selectivity for alkane reactions, but rapid deactivation due to coke formation remains a challenge \[10.1016/j.fuproc.2016.04.016\]. Acid sites on supports promote alkene readsorption, oligomerization, and aromatization \[10.1016/j.fuproc.2016.04.016\]. Pt promotion with metals like Sn, Ga, Zn, Re improves stability but accelerates deactivation compared to Pt/Na[Fe]-ZSM-5 \[10.1016/j.fuproc.2016.04.016\]. Potassium in commercial Cr and Pt-based catalysts minimizes protonic site influence on alkene selectivity \[10.1016/j.fuproc.2016.04.016\]. The role of surface oxygen species is becoming clearer \[10.1016/j.fuproc.2016.04.016\]. The electronic promotion effect of Sn aligns with the oxidative addition CH activation mechanism \[10.1016/j.fuproc.2016.04.016\]. The Lewis base-assisted deprotonation mechanism may explain CH activation on Cr-based catalysts \[10.1016/j.fuproc.2016.04.016\]. Recent findings suggest a porous copper-aluminum framework material outperforms PtSn/Al2O3 for propane dehydrogenation, with potential for achieving propane dehydrogenation at 350 C, indicating a future research direction for non-oxidative dehydrogenation of lower alkanes \[10.1016/j.fuproc.2016.04.016\].

Catalyst properties, including metal oxides' stability influenced by zeolite framework and the effect of zeolite pore size on catalytic activity, significantly impact dehydrogenation reactions \[10.1039/C5SC01227A\]. The optimal AlAl distance in zeolites can minimize overall barriers, based on the Sabatier principle \[10.1039/C5SC01227A\]. Promoters like Au atoms and PtCu enhance catalytic efficiency and anti-coking ability, respectively \[10.1039/C5SC01227A\]. Theoretical studies aim to identify ideal catalysts for specific processes, leveraging advancements in computational methods to explore complex systems beyond simple transition-metal surfaces \[10.1039/C5SC01227A\]. Insights from case studies reveal dehydrogenation mechanisms, challenging to explore at the molecular level experimentally \[10.1039/C5SC01227A\].

In dehydrogenation reactions, particularly PDH, catalyst properties like geometric and electronic effects are critical \[10.1002/anie.202107210\]. The double modification of PtGa intermetallics with Pb and Ca optimizes these properties, creating an ultra-stable catalytic system \[10.1002/anie.202107210\]. Pb blocks Pt3 sites, while Ca enriches Pt1 sites, effectively suppressing side reactions \[10.1002/anie.202107210\]. This strategy results in a catalyst with exceptional stability in PDH, maintaining activity for up to 1 month at high temperatures, with almost no deactivation observed \[10.1002/anie.202107210\].

Support acidity modifies the electronic properties of metals such as Pt, enhancing catalytic efficiency and selectivity in dehydrogenation reactions \[10.1021/jp055754k\]. Conversely, Pt reduces acid site strength, affecting reactions requiring both metal and acid sites \[10.1021/jp055754k\].
