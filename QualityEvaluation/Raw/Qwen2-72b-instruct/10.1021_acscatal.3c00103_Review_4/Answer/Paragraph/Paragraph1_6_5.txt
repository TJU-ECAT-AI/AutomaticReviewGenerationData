Surface acidity at low-coordinated Al sites affects propane adsorption and activation, influencing coke deposition \[10.1016/j.jcat.2019.11.026\]. Support modification strategies, such as using γ-Al2O3 nanosheets and Ga2O3-Al2O3 interaction, optimize catalyst properties for enhanced efficiency and selectivity in dehydrogenation reactions \[10.1016/j.jcat.2019.11.026\].

        Catalyst acidity, assessed by NH3-TPD, reveals parent H-Beta with weak and strong acid sites, while Si-Beta lacks acid sites post-dealumination \[10.1016/j.jechem.2020.08.058\]. Pt introduces trace medium acid sites, and
