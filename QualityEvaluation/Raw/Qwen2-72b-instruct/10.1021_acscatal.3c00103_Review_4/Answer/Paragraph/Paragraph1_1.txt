                    The physicochemical properties of catalysts, including acid strength and alloy formation, significantly influence dehydrogenation reactions \[10.1016/j.cej.2020.126656\]. Adding Ca to Al2O3 decreases acid centers, enhancing propylene selectivity and stability. The Ca-promoted catalyst exhibits lower deactivation rates and higher residual activity, indicating improved resistance against deactivation by coke. This enhanced coke resistance contributes to better performance in terms of activity and selectivity at steady-state conditions. The properties of Al2O3, notably Lewis acid sites from AlIII, significantly impact dehydrogenation reactions \[10.1039/D0CY00779J\]. γ-Al2O3, with more Lewis acid sites than θ-Al2O3, enhances propane conversion, highlighting their role as active sites. The γ-Al2O3-200 catalyst, characterized by a high level of strong acid sites, demonstrates the highest yield and regenerability, making it a sustainable choice for industrial propane dehydrogenation. Strategic support modification can optimize these properties for improved catalytic efficiency and selectivity. The properties of catalysts, including chemical and morphological aspects, significantly impact dehydrogenation reactions \[10.1016/j.jcat.2021.09.011\]. Zeolites synthesized with a diammonium-type bromide surfactant and sodium-free silica source contain silanol nests, confirmed by spectroscopy. These nests facilitate the formation of Pt3Y alloy nanoparticles, which exhibit high catalytic durability, propane conversion, and propylene selectivity. Pt3Y shows fully reversible hydrogen chemisorption at room temperature, unlike monometallic Pt. The nanoparticles, approximately 2 nm in size, are evenly distributed and contain both Pt and Y, with a 3:1 atomic ratio. PtY(0.5)/MZ-sf-Br and PtY(0.5)/MZ-sf-OH catalysts outperform PtY(0.5)/MZ-dg in durability. Catalysts on silanol nest-containing zeolites have an activation period to reach full conversion, with propane conversion exceeding equilibrium values initially. The PtY(0.5)/MZ-sf-Br catalyst maintains activity for 20 days, contrasting with PtY(0.5)/MZ-sf-Br-NaCl's rapid deactivation. Support modification strategies, like using specific surfactants and silica sources, optimize zeolite properties for enhanced catalytic efficiency and selectivity in dehydrogenation reactions.

                    Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: The advancements and findings discussed in the file highlight the pivotal role of catalyst physicochemical properties in dehydrogenation reactions. The strategic modification of supports, such as the addition of Ca to Al2O3, can significantly enhance propylene selectivity and stability by reducing acid centers and improving resistance against deactivation by coke. The utilization of γ-Al2O3 with a high density of Lewis acid sites as a support for Pt and Ru sites, and its interaction with Ga2O3 to disperse Ga3+ cations, boosts PDH reaction activity and stability. The synthesis of zeolites with silanol nests using specific surfactants and silica sources facilitates the formation of Pt3Y alloy nanoparticles, which exhibit high catalytic durability, propane conversion, and propylene selectivity. These findings underscore the importance of support modification strategies in optimizing catalytic efficiency and selectivity. Future research endeavors might focus on the development of novel support materials with tailored acidity and morphology to further enhance catalytic performance in dehydrogenation reactions. The exploration of emerging fields, such as the use of 2D materials and metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) as supports, could offer new avenues for optimizing catalyst properties. Additionally, the integration of computational methods with experimental studies could provide deeper insights into the complex interplay between catalyst properties and dehydrogenation reactions, guiding the design of more efficient and selective catalysts.
