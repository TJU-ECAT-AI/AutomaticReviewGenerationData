The influence of catalyst physicochemical properties on dehydrogenation reactions, particularly propane dehydrogenation (PDH), is profound, with chemical qualities and morphological characteristics playing pivotal roles in catalytic performance and selectivity \[10.1016/j.cej.2020.126656\]. Acid strength and stability, alongside the morphology of the catalyst, significantly impact the efficiency of dehydrogenation reactions \[10.1016/j.jcat.2020.07.002\]. The addition of Ca to Al2O3, for instance, reduces acid centers and promotes alloy formation, enhancing propylene selectivity and stability in PDH reactions \[10.1016/j.cej.2020.126656\]. The Ca-promoted catalyst exhibits lower deactivation rates and higher residual activity at high temperatures, indicating improved resistance against coke formation \[10.1016/j.cej.2020.126656\]. Moreover, the slightly higher activation energy for the Ca-promoted catalyst, due to enhanced GeOx reduction and Pt-Ge alloy formation, initially decreases activity but boosts steady-state performance in terms of both activity and selectivity \[10.1016/j.cej.2020.126656\].

Lewis acid sites, originating from unsaturated AlIII in Al2O3, are critical for the catalytic cycle in PDH \[10.1039/D0CY00779J\]. γ-Al2O3, with more Lewis acid sites than θ-Al2O3, shows higher activity in propane dehydrogenation, as demonstrated by the γ-Al2O3-200 catalyst's high yield and selectivity \[10.1039/D0CY00779J\]. This catalyst's regenerability, allowing recovery after deactivation, is crucial for industrial applications, making it a sustainable choice \[10.1039/D0CY00779J\].

Strategic support modification, such as using diammonium-type bromide surfactants and sodium-free silica sources, optimizes zeolite properties for enhanced catalytic efficiency and selectivity in dehydrogenation reactions \[10.1016/j.jcat.2021.09.011\]. These modifications facilitate the formation of Pt3Y alloy nanoparticles, which exhibit high catalytic durability, propane conversion, and propylene selectivity \[10.1016/j.jcat.2021.09.011\]. Pt3Y shows fully reversible hydrogen chemisorption at room temperature, unlike monometallic Pt \[10.1016/j.jcat.2021.09.011\]. Catalysts supported on silanol nest-containing zeolites have an activation period to reach full conversion, with propane conversion exceeding equilibrium values initially \[10.1016/j.jcat.2021.09.011\].

CrOx on high-silica HZSM-5, synthesized by wet impregnation, exhibits high PDH activity, selectivity, and stability \[10.1016/j.jechem.2019.12.010\]. Zeolites, with their acidity and morphological features, offer a unique environment for catalysis, where Brnsted acid sites play a crucial role in alkane conversion \[10.1016/j.jechem.2019.12.010\]. Physicochemical characterizations, PDH tests, and Na+ doping experiments reveal the importance of Cr species and Brnsted acid sites in Cr/HZSM-5 catalysts \[10.1016/j.jechem.2019.12.010\].

The crystallization temperature of the support affects VOx/Al2O3 catalyst performance by increasing Lewis acid sites and altering surface V species distribution \[10.1039/D1GC03700E\]. P modification reduces VOx polymerization, enhancing stability and activity \[10.1039/D1GC03700E\]. Mg modification disperses V2O5 crystallites and increases active V3+ species, improving catalytic performance and anti-coking capability \[10.1039/D1GC03700E\].

In dehydrogenation reactions, higher temperatures increase alkane conversion but decrease alkene selectivity due to dehydrocyclization, aromatization, cracking, and coke formation \[10.1016/j.fuproc.2016.04.016\]. PtSn interactions on support materials vary with the impregnation sequence \[10.1016/j.fuproc.2016.04.016\]. Zeolite frameworks exert dispersive forces on reactants, influenced by framework shape and active site density \[10.1016/j.fuproc.2016.04.016\]. Electrostatic fields between protons and metal ions enhance CH bond polarization, aiding hydride abstraction in CH activation \[10.1016/j.fuproc.2016.04.016\]. Polarization effects increase with cation charge and radius, and strategic cation choice avoids catalytic effects on alkene products \[10.1016/j.fuproc.2016.04.016\]. Creating CH polarization on zeolite frameworks by modifying framework atoms can enhance catalytic performance \[10.1016/j.fuproc.2016.04.016\].

The stability of metal oxides influenced by the zeolite framework and the effect of zeolite pore size on catalytic activity are critical for dehydrogenation reactions \[10.1039/C5SC01227A\]. The optimal AlAl distance in zeolites, based on the Sabatier principle, minimizes overall barriers \[10.1039/C5SC01227A\]. Theoretical studies aim to identify ideal catalysts for specific processes, leveraging advancements in computational methods \[10.1039/C5SC01227A\].

In PDH, catalyst properties like geometric and electronic effects are critical \[10.1002/anie.202107210\]. The double modification of PtGa intermetallics with Pb for geometric blocking of Pt3 sites and Ca for electronic enrichment of Pt1 sites optimizes these effects \[10.1002/anie.202107210\]. This strategy creates an ultra-stable catalytic system, as evidenced by PtGaCaPb/SiO2's outstanding stability in PDH for up to 1 month at high temperatures, with almost no deactivation observed \[10.1002/anie.202107210\].

In dehydrogenation reactions, the acidity of supports significantly impacts the electronic properties of supported metals like Pt, and vice versa \[10.1021/jp055754k\]. Increased support acidity enhances Pt's electronic properties, while Pt's presence reduces the strength of the support's acid sites, affecting pyridine desorption and suppressing cracking reactions during decalin ring opening \[10.1021/jp055754k\]. These metal-acid site interactions can enhance catalytic efficiency and selectivity in reactions requiring both active sites \[10.1021/jp055754k\].

Support modification strategies, summarized in Table 3, aim to optimize these properties for improved catalytic performance \[10.1021/acscatal.3c00103\_4\]. Zeolites' Lewis acid sites are optimal for propane dehydrogenation, whereas Brnsted acid sites favor cleavage reactions \[10.1021/acscatal.3c00103\_4\]. Enhancing catalytic efficiency involves developing nanosized supports and specific morphologies with high external surfaces \[10.1021/acscatal.3c00103\_4\].
