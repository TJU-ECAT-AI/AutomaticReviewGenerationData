The influence of catalyst physicochemical properties on dehydrogenation reactions, particularly propane dehydrogenation (PDH), is profound, with chemical qualities and morphological characteristics playing pivotal roles in catalytic efficiency and selectivity \[10.1016/j.cej.2020.126656\]. Acid strength and alloy formation are critical factors, with the addition of Ca to Al2O3 reducing acid centers and enhancing alloy formation, leading to improved propylene selectivity and stability \[10.1016/j.cej.2020.126656\]. The Ca-promoted catalyst displays lower deactivation rates and higher residual activity at 600°C, indicating enhanced resistance to coke formation \[10.1016/j.cej.2020.126656\]. This catalyst has a slightly higher activation energy, leading to reduced initial activity but superior performance in terms of activity and selectivity at steady state conditions \[10.1016/j.cej.2020.126656\].

Lewis acid sites from unsaturated AlIII in Al2O3 are crucial for dehydrogenation reactions, with γ-Al2O3-200 exhibiting the highest yield due to its high level of strong acid sites \[10.1039/D0CY00779J\]. Propane conversion positively correlates with the amount of Lewis acid sites, indicating their role as active sites \[10.1039/D0CY00779J\]. The regenerability of the γ-Al2O3-200 catalyst, allowing recovery after deactivation, makes it sustainable for industrial use \[10.1039/D0CY00779J\].

Catalyst properties, including chemical and morphological aspects, are crucial in dehydrogenation reactions. A diammonium-type bromide surfactant and sodium-free silica source synthesize zeolites with silanol nests, confirmed by spectroscopy \[10.1016/j.jcat.2021.09.011\]. These nests enable the formation of Pt3Y alloy nanoparticles, which exhibit high catalytic durability, propane conversion, and propylene selectivity \[10.1016/j.jcat.2021.09.011\]. Pt3Y shows fully reversible hydrogen chemisorption at room temperature, unlike monometallic Pt \[10.1016/j.jcat.2021.09.011\]. PtY(0.5)/MZ-sf-Br and PtY(0.5)/MZ-sf-OH outperform PtY(0.5)/MZ-dg in durability, maintaining high propane conversion and propylene selectivity for 20 days \[10.1016/j.jcat.2021.09.011\]. In contrast, PtY(0.5)/MZ-sf-Br-NaCl deactivates rapidly \[10.1016/j.jcat.2021.09.011\]. The spent PtY(0.5)/MZ-sf-Br catalyst has 37 wt% coke deposition \[10.1016/j.jcat.2021.09.011\]. Support modification strategies, such as using specific surfactants and silica sources, optimize zeolite properties for enhanced catalytic efficiency and selectivity \[10.1016/j.jcat.2021.09.011\].

CrOx on high-silica HZSM-5, synthesized by wet impregnation, exhibits high activity and stability for PDH, highlighting the role of Cr species and Brnsted acid sites \[10.1016/j.jechem.2019.12.010\]. Zeolite supports, particularly HZSM-5, provide a unique environment for reactions, with Brnsted acid sites crucial for propane adsorption and activation \[10.1016/j.jechem.2019.12.010\]. High surface area and well-defined pores in HZSM-5 enhance Cr species dispersion and stability \[10.1016/j.jechem.2019.12.010\]. Cr loading amount and SiO2/Al2O3 ratio significantly affect catalytic performance \[10.1016/j.jechem.2019.12.010\]. Zeolites, with tunable acidity and thermal stability, are versatile supports for catalytic reactions, making HZSM-5 an ideal support for PDH due to its suitable acidic sites \[10.1016/j.jechem.2019.12.010\].



Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: Taking into consideration the advancements and findings discussed in the file, there lies an opportunity to explore emerging fields and innovative methodologies. Future research endeavors might focus on the development of novel catalysts with tailored physicochemical properties for enhanced catalytic efficiency and selectivity in PDH reactions. This could involve the synthesis of catalysts with optimized acid strength, stability, and morphology, as well as the exploration of new support modification strategies. The use of advanced computational methods to predict and design catalysts with ideal properties for specific dehydrogenation processes is a promising direction. Additionally, the investigation of the role of metal-support interactions in dehydrogenation reactions could lead to the discovery of new catalysts with improved stability and activity. The development of catalysts with enhanced resistance to deactivation by coke and the optimization of catalytic performance through strategic support modification are critical areas for future research. The exploration of new materials, such as mesoporous materials and MXenes, for their potential to offer more active sites and less coke deposition is also a promising avenue. The use of carbon materials, like nanotubes and graphene, as supports could provide large surface area and stability, affecting catalytic selectivity and stability. Each support has unique effects on catalytic properties, influencing selectivity and stability, and the optimization of these properties through support modification strategies is essential for enhanced catalytic efficiency and selectivity in dehydrogenation reactions.

The addition of Ca to Al2O3 decreases acid centers and increases alloy formation, enhancing propylene selectivity and stability \[10.1016/j.cej.2020.126656\]. γ-Al2O3, with more Lewis acid sites than θ-Al2O3, exhibits higher activity in propane dehydrogenation \[10.1039/D0CY00779J\].
