The physicochemical properties of catalysts, including chemical qualities and morphological characteristics, significantly influence dehydrogenation reactions, particularly propane dehydrogenation (PDH) \[10.1016/j.cej.2020.126656\]. The addition of Ca to Al2O3 reduces acid centers, enhancing propylene selectivity and stability. The Ca-promoted catalyst exhibits lower deactivation rates and higher residual activity at 600°C, indicating improved resistance to coke-induced deactivation. The activation energy for PDH reactions is marginally higher in Ca-enhanced catalysts due to increased GeOx reduction and Pt-Ge alloy formation, which initially decreases activity but optimizes steady-state performance in terms of both activity and selectivity \[10.1016/j.cej.2020.126656\].

Lewis acid sites from AlIII in Al2O3 are critical for PDH, with γ-Al2O3 exhibiting more such sites than θ-Al2O3, enhancing propane dehydrogenation activity \[10.1039/D0CY00779J\]. The conversion rate of propane is directly proportional to the number of Lewis acid sites, highlighting their role as active sites. The γ-Al2O3-200 catalyst, characterized by a high level of strong acid sites, demonstrates the highest yield and is regenerable, making it sustainable for industrial applications \[10.1039/D0CY00779J\].

Pt3Y alloy nanoparticles, formed with silanol nests in zeolites synthesized using specific surfactants and silica sources, exhibit high catalytic durability and selectivity \[10.1016/j.jcat.2021.09.011\]. These nanoparticles show fully reversible hydrogen chemisorption at room temperature, unlike monometallic Pt. PtY(0.5)/MZ-sf-Br and PtY(0.5)/MZ-sf-OH catalysts outperform PtY(0.5)/MZ-dg in durability. The spent PtY(0.5)/MZ-sf-Br catalyst has 37 wt% coke deposition, and there's an inverse relationship between propane conversion and metal loading amount when catalysts are fully activated \[10.1016/j.jcat.2021.09.011\].

CrOx on high-silica HZSM-5, synthesized by wet impregnation, excels in PDH with high activity, selectivity, and stability \[10.1016/j.jechem.2019.12.010\]. Zeolite supports, particularly Brnsted acid sites, are crucial for propane adsorption and activation. Cr loading and SiO2/Al2O3 ratio influence catalytic performance, with HZSM-5's high surface area and well-defined pores enhancing Cr species dispersion and stability. Zeolites, with their high surface area, thermal stability, and tunable acidity, are ideal supports for Cr-based PDH catalysts \[10.1016/j.jechem.2019.12.010\].

Support modification strategies, including the use of specific surfactants and silica sources, optimize zeolite properties for enhanced catalytic efficiency and selectivity in dehydrogenation reactions \[10.1016/j.jcat.2021.09.011\]. Strategic support modification, such as enhancing Lewis acid sites and optimizing crystalline structure, can improve catalytic efficiency and selectivity \[10.1039/D0CY00779J\]. Ca addition optimizes these properties for superior catalytic efficiency and selectivity \[10.1016/j.cej.2020.126656\].



Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: The advancements and findings discussed in the file reveal the pivotal role of catalyst physicochemical properties in dehydrogenation reactions, particularly PDH. The strategic modification of supports, such as the addition of Ca to Al2O3, the use of γ-Al2O3 with high Lewis acid sites, and the synthesis of Pt3Y alloy nanoparticles with silanol nests in zeolites, significantly enhances catalytic efficiency and selectivity \[10.1016/j.cej.2020.126656, 10.1039/D0CY00779J, 10.1016/j.jcat.2021.09.011\].

Future research endeavors might focus on exploring emerging fields and innovative methodologies to further optimize catalyst properties for enhanced catalytic efficiency and selectivity. This includes the development of novel supports with tailored acidity and morphology, the synthesis of advanced alloy nanoparticles with improved stability and activity, and the investigation of new dehydrogenation mechanisms and pathways \[10.1016/j.jcat.2021.09.011\]. Additionally, the integration of computational methods and experimental techniques can provide deeper insights into the molecular-level interactions and reaction mechanisms, guiding the design of more efficient and selective catalysts for PDH and other dehydrogenation reactions \[10.1016/j.cej.2020.126656\].

The physicochemical properties of catalysts play a pivotal role in dehydrogenation reactions, significantly impacting the efficiency and selectivity of these processes. Catalysts with tailored properties can enhance the adsorption and activation of reactants, leading to improved reaction rates and product yields. For instance, the size, shape, and electronic structure of metal nanoparticles can be manipulated to optimize their catalytic activity. Additionally, the nature of the support material, such as its acidity, basicity, or porosity, can influence the dispersion of active sites and the accessibility of reactants, thereby affecting catalytic performance. Strategic modification of the support, such as doping with specific elements or altering its texture, can further enhance the catalyst's stability and activity. This approach not only maximizes the efficiency of dehydrogenation reactions but also opens avenues for the design of more sustainable and cost-effective catalytic systems.
