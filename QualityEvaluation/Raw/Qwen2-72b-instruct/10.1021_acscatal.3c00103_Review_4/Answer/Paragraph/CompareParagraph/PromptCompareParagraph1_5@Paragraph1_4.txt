The influence of catalyst physicochemical properties on dehydrogenation reactions, particularly propane dehydrogenation (PDH), is profound, with chemical qualities and morphological characteristics playing pivotal roles in catalytic performance and selectivity \[10.1016/j.cej.2020.126656\]. Acid strength and stability, alongside the morphology of the catalyst, significantly impact the efficiency of dehydrogenation reactions \[10.1016/j.jcat.2020.07.002\]. The addition of Ca to Al2O3, for instance, reduces acid centers and promotes alloy formation, enhancing propylene selectivity and stability in PDH reactions \[10.1016/j.cej.2020.126656\]. The Ca-promoted catalyst exhibits lower deactivation rates and higher residual activity at high temperatures, indicating improved resistance against coke formation \[10.1016/j.cej.2020.126656\]. Moreover, the slightly higher activation energy for the Ca-promoted catalyst, due to enhanced GeOx reduction and Pt-Ge alloy formation, initially decreases activity but boosts steady-state performance in terms of both activity and selectivity \[10.1016/j.cej.2020.126656\].

Lewis acid sites, originating from unsaturated AlIII in Al2O3, are critical for the catalytic cycle in PDH \[10.1039/D0CY00779J\]. γ-Al2O3, with more Lewis acid sites than θ-Al2O3, shows higher activity in propane dehydrogenation, as demonstrated by the γ-Al2O3-200 catalyst's high yield and selectivity \[10.1039/D0CY00779J\]. This catalyst's regenerability, allowing recovery after deactivation, is crucial for industrial applications, making it a sustainable choice \[10.1039/D0CY00779J\].

Strategic support modification, such as using diammonium-type bromide surfactants and sodium-free silica sources, optimizes zeolite properties for enhanced catalytic efficiency and selectivity in dehydrogenation reactions \[10.1016/j.jcat.2021.09.011\]. These modifications facilitate the formation of Pt3Y alloy nanoparticles, which exhibit high catalytic durability, propane conversion, and propylene selectivity \[10.1016/j.jcat.2021.09.011\]. Pt3Y shows fully reversible hydrogen chemisorption at room temperature, unlike monometallic Pt \[10.1016/j.jcat.2021.09.011\]. Catalysts supported on silanol nest-containing zeolites have an activation period to reach full conversion, with propane conversion exceeding equilibrium values initially \[10.1016/j.jcat.2021.09.011\].

CrOx on high-silica HZSM-5, synthesized by wet impregnation, exhibits high PDH activity, selectivity, and stability \[10.1016/j.jechem.2019.12.010\]. Zeolites, with their acidity and morphological features, offer a unique environment for catalysis, where Brnsted acid sites play a crucial role in alkane conversion \[10.1016/j.jechem.2019.12.010\]. Physicochemical characterizations, PDH tests, and Na+ doping experiments reveal the importance of Cr species and Brnsted acid sites in Cr/HZSM-5 catalysts \[10.1016/j.jechem.2019.12.010\].

The crystallization temperature of the support affects VOx/Al2O3 catalyst performance by increasing Lewis acid sites and altering surface V species distribution \[10.1039/D1GC03700E\]. P modification reduces VOx polymerization, enhancing stability and activity \[10.1039/D1GC03700E\]. Mg modification disperses V2O5 crystallites and increases active V3+ species, improving catalytic performance and anti-coking capability \[10.1039/D1GC03700E\].

In dehydrogenation reactions, higher temperatures increase alkane conversion but decrease alkene selectivity due to dehydrocyclization, aromatization, cracking, and coke formation \[10.1016/j.fuproc.2016.04.016\]. PtSn interactions on support materials vary with the impregnation sequence \[10.1016/j.fuproc.2016.04.016\]. Zeolite frameworks exert dispersive forces on reactants, influenced by framework shape and active site density \[10.1016/j.fuproc.2016.04.016\]. Electrostatic fields between protons and metal ions enhance CH bond polarization, aiding hydride abstraction in CH activation \[10.1016/j.fuproc.2016.04.016\]. Polarization effects increase with cation charge and radius, and strategic cation choice avoids catalytic effects on alkene products \[10.1016/j.fuproc.2016.04.016\]. Creating CH polarization on zeolite frameworks by modifying framework atoms can enhance catalytic performance \[10.1016/j.fuproc.2016.04.016\].

The stability of metal oxides influenced by the zeolite framework and the effect of zeolite pore size on catalytic activity are critical for dehydrogenation reactions \[10.1039/C5SC01227A\]. The optimal AlAl distance in zeolites, based on the Sabatier principle, minimizes overall barriers \[10.1039/C5SC01227A\]. Theoretical studies aim to identify ideal catalysts for specific processes, leveraging advancements in computational methods \[10.1039/C5SC01227A\].

In PDH, catalyst properties like geometric and electronic effects are critical \[10.1002/anie.202107210\]. The double modification of PtGa intermetallics with Pb for geometric blocking of Pt3 sites and Ca for electronic enrichment of Pt1 sites optimizes these effects \[10.1002/anie.202107210\]. This strategy creates an ultra-stable catalytic system, as evidenced by PtGaCaPb/SiO2's outstanding stability in PDH for up to 1 month at high temperatures, with almost no deactivation observed \[10.1002/anie.202107210\].

In dehydrogenation reactions, the acidity of supports significantly impacts the electronic properties of supported metals like Pt, and vice versa \[10.1021/jp055754k\]. Increased support acidity enhances Pt's electronic properties, while Pt's presence reduces the strength of the support's acid sites, affecting pyridine desorption and suppressing cracking reactions during decalin ring opening \[10.1021/jp055754k\]. These metal-acid site interactions can enhance catalytic efficiency and selectivity in reactions requiring both active sites \[10.1021/jp055754k\].

Support modification strategies, summarized in Table 3, aim to optimize these properties for improved catalytic performance \[10.1021/acscatal.3c00103\_4\]. Zeolites' Lewis acid sites are optimal for propane dehydrogenation, whereas Brnsted acid sites favor cleavage reactions \[10.1021/acscatal.3c00103\_4\]. Enhancing catalytic efficiency involves developing nanosized supports and specific morphologies with high external surfaces \[10.1021/acscatal.3c00103\_4\].

This could lead to the development of more stable and efficient catalysts for dehydrogenation reactions.

3. **Optimizing Catalyst Properties**: Optimizing catalyst properties through strategic support modification, such as using diammonium-type bromide surfactants and sodium-free silica sources to create silanol nests in zeolites \[10.1016/j.jcat.2021.09.011\]. This modification facilitates the formation of Pt3Y alloy nanoparticles, which exhibit high catalytic durability, propane conversion, and propylene selectivity \[10.1016/j.jcat.2021.09.011\].

4. **Enhancing Selectivity and Stability**: Developing catalysts with enhanced selectivity and stability, as evidenced by the Ca-promoted catalyst's lower deactivation rates and higher residual activity at high temperatures \[10.1016/j.cej.2020.126656\].

8. **Exploring Novel Supports**: Investigating novel supports, such as MXenes and carbon materials, which offer large surface areas and stability in acidic/basic media \[10.1039/D0CS00814A\].

9. **Understanding Active Sites**: Gaining a deeper understanding of the nature of active sites in Ga-based dehydrogenation catalysts, which is still under debate \[10.1021/cr5002436\].

10. **Lower Temperature Reactions**: Exploring the potential for lower temperature dehydrogenation reactions, as suggested by recent findings that a porous copper-aluminum framework material outperforms PtSn/Al2O3 for propane dehydrogenation \[10.1016/j.fuproc.2016.04.016\].

These directions could potentially lead to the development of more efficient, selective, and stable catalysts for dehydrogenation reactions, addressing the challenges of rapid deactivation due to coke formation and promoting sustainable chemical processes.

The physicochemical properties of catalysts, including chemical qualities and morphological characteristics, significantly influence dehydrogenation reactions, particularly propane dehydrogenation (PDH) \[10.1016/j.cej.2020.126656\]. The addition of Ca to Al2O3 reduces acid centers, enhancing propylene selectivity and stability. The Ca-promoted catalyst exhibits lower deactivation rates and higher residual activity at 600°C, indicating improved resistance to coke-induced deactivation. The activation energy for PDH reactions is marginally higher in Ca-enhanced catalysts due to increased GeOx reduction and Pt-Ge alloy formation, which initially decreases activity but optimizes steady-state performance in terms of both activity and selectivity \[10.1016/j.cej.2020.126656\].

Lewis acid sites from AlIII in Al2O3 are critical for PDH, with γ-Al2O3 exhibiting more such sites than θ-Al2O3, enhancing propane dehydrogenation activity \[10.1039/D0CY00779J\]. The conversion rate of propane is directly proportional to the number of Lewis acid sites, highlighting their role as active sites. The γ-Al2O3-200 catalyst, characterized by a high level of strong acid sites, demonstrates the highest yield and is regenerable, making it sustainable for industrial applications \[10.1039/D0CY00779J\].

Pt3Y alloy nanoparticles, formed with silanol nests in zeolites synthesized using specific surfactants and silica sources, exhibit high catalytic durability and selectivity \[10.1016/j.jcat.2021.09.011\]. These nanoparticles show fully reversible hydrogen chemisorption at room temperature, unlike monometallic Pt. PtY(0.5)/MZ-sf-Br and PtY(0.5)/MZ-sf-OH catalysts outperform PtY(0.5)/MZ-dg in durability. The spent PtY(0.5)/MZ-sf-Br catalyst has 37 wt% coke deposition, and there's an inverse relationship between propane conversion and metal loading amount when catalysts are fully activated \[10.1016/j.jcat.2021.09.011\].

CrOx on high-silica HZSM-5, synthesized by wet impregnation, excels in PDH with high activity, selectivity, and stability \[10.1016/j.jechem.2019.12.010\].

Cr loading and SiO2/Al2O3 ratio influence catalytic performance, with HZSM-5's high surface area and well-defined pores enhancing Cr species dispersion and stability. Zeolites, with their high surface area, thermal stability, and tunable acidity, are ideal supports for Cr-based PDH catalysts \[10.1016/j.jechem.2019.12.010\].

Support modification strategies, including the use of specific surfactants and silica sources, optimize zeolite properties for enhanced catalytic efficiency and selectivity in dehydrogenation reactions \[10.1016/j.jcat.2021.09.011\]. Strategic support modification, such as enhancing Lewis acid sites and optimizing crystalline structure, can improve catalytic efficiency and selectivity \[10.1039/D0CY00779J\]. Ca addition optimizes these properties for superior catalytic efficiency and selectivity \[10.1016/j.cej.2020.126656\].
