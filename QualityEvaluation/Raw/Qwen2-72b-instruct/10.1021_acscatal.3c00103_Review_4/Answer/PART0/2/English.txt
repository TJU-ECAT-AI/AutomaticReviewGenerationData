Support modification strategies can be employed to optimize the physicochemical properties of catalysts for enhanced catalytic efficiency and selectivity. For example, the robustness against coking can be increased by adding promoters such as late transition metals, main-group metals including Sn and Ga, alkali-metal oxides, and rare-earth metal oxides. The existence of Au atoms in alloys shifts down the d band, weakening the interaction between σ* of CH bond and d states of surface metal atoms, resulting in an increase in the dissociation barrier height. The lower reactivity (i.e., higher dehydrogenation barrier) on PtSn alloy is due to the deeper d-band center compared to pure Pt. The PtCu catalyst inhibits the adsorption of formed propylene, suppressing secondary cracking reactions from propylene towards lighter hydrocarbons, which enhances the anti-coking ability of the catalyst. The weak binding of intermediates on certain sites favors the desorption of H2, and calculations have suggested an optimal AlAl distance in zeolites for a minimum overall barrier, based on the Sabatier principle.
