The physicochemical properties of catalysts, including chemical qualities and morphological characteristics, significantly influence their performance in dehydrogenation reactions. The decrease of acid centers of Al2O3 and the increase of the degree of alloy formation upon addition of Ca lead to enhanced propylene selectivity and catalyst stability. The deactivation model with residual activity (DMRA) was used to fit the experimental data of propane conversion vs. time, which allowed for the calculation of the intrinsic deactivation kinetic parameters for both catalysts. The Ca-promoted catalyst showed a lower deactivation function and higher residual activity, indicating better resistance against deactivation by coke. The activation energy of the PDH reaction for the Ca-promoted catalyst was slightly higher due to the enhanced reduction of the GeOx species, which enhanced the formation of a Pt-Ge alloy, decreasing the initial activity of the catalyst. However, this also led to better performance in terms of both activity and selectivity at steady state conditions. Support modification strategies, such as the addition of Ca, can optimize these properties for enhanced catalytic efficiency and selectivity.

The physicochemical properties of catalysts, including chemical qualities such as acid strength and stability, play a crucial role in their performance in dehydrogenation reactions. The Lewis acid site, arising from the unsaturated AlIII site in the Al2O3 structure, is the active site for the catalytic cycle. The amount of Lewis acid sites in Al2O3 is positively linked to the propane conversion rate, indicating their importance in propane dehydrogenation. Morphological characteristics, such as the crystalline structure, also influence catalytic performance. γ-Al2O3 possesses more Lewis acid sites than θ-Al2O3, which contributes to its higher activity. The regenerability of the γ-Al2O3-200 catalyst, which can be restored after deactivation, is an important property for practical applications. Support modification strategies, such as controlling the crystalline structure and increasing the number of Lewis acid sites, can be employed to optimize these properties for enhanced catalytic efficiency and selectivity.

The γ-Al2O3-200 catalyst, with a high level of strong acid sites, shows the highest yield in propane dehydrogenation. The formation of Lewis acid sites in Al2O3 is mainly due to the defective AIII site in the structure. The propane conversion rate is positively linked to the amount of Lewis acid sites in Al2O3, indicating that the Lewis acid sites are the active sites for propane dehydrogenation.

The physicochemical properties of catalysts, including chemical qualities and morphological characteristics, significantly influence their performance in dehydrogenation reactions. The use of a diammonium-type bromide surfactant and a sodium-free silica source in the synthesis procedure leads to the formation of silanol nests in the zeolite, which are confirmed by IR and NMR spectroscopies. These silanol nests play a critical role in the formation of intermetallic alloy nanoparticles, such as Pt3Y, which exhibit high catalytic durability, high propane conversion, and propylene selectivity in propane dehydrogenation. The alloy nanoparticles show fully reversible hydrogen chemisorption behavior at room temperature, unlike monometallic Pt nanoparticles. The nanoparticles are homogeneously distributed throughout the support material, with a size of approximately 2 nm. The EDS analysis confirms that these metal nanoparticles contain both Pt and Y in the same particle, with an average atomic ratio of Pt to Y of approximately 3. The PtY(0.5)/MZ-sf-Br and PtY(0.5)/MZ-sf-OH catalysts show superior catalytic durability compared to PtY(0.5)/MZ-dg. The catalysts supported on silanol nest-containing zeolites have an activation period to reach full conversion. The propane conversion is higher than the equilibrium value during the early reaction period. The TGA profile for the spent PtY(0.5)/MZ-sf-Br catalyst shows that 37 wt% of coke species are deposited on the catalyst sample. The PtY(0.5)/MZ-sf-Br catalyst exhibits slow deactivation over 20 days, while PtY(0.5)/MZ-sf-Br-NaCl is deactivated within 1 day, similar to Pt(0.5)/MZ-sc. Support modification strategies, such as the use of a diammonium-type bromide surfactant and a sodium-free silica source, can optimize the properties of zeolite supports for enhanced catalytic efficiency and selectivity in dehydrogenation reactions.

The physicochemical properties of catalysts, including chemical qualities and morphological characteristics, significantly influence their performance in dehydrogenation reactions. Catalysts synthesized by wet impregnation method, such as CrOx supported on high-silica HZSM-5 with a SiO2/Al2O3 ratio of 260, exhibit high catalytic activity, good selectivity, and excellent stability for PDH. The exploitation of an efficient PDH catalyst based on HZSM-5 zeolite to achieve both high selectivity and stability is still a challenge. In zeolite supported catalysts, zeolite provides a special environment for catalytic reactions, including channel confinement effects, acidic sites, and electron transfer. Acidic sites in zeolites play a key role in determining the catalytic performance of zeolite catalysts in alkane conversion. The role of Cr species and Brnsted acid sites in Cr/HZSM-5 catalysts is elucidated through physicochemical characterizations, PDH tests, and Na+ doping experiments. The structural properties of the prepared CrOx catalysts are detected by N2 sorption technique. The XRD patterns of parent HZSM-5(260) and Cr/Z-5(260) samples are similar, indicating that the Cr loading has little influence on the crystallite structure of HZSM-5 zeolite. The acidity properties of the prepared Cr/Z-5, Cr/SiO2, and Cr/Al2O3 catalysts are detected by NH3-TPD technique. The metal-support interactions between Cr species and HZSM-5 support are measured by XPS spectroscopy. During the PDH tests, the high reaction temperature results in coke formation onto the catalyst, which is the main cause of catalyst deactivation. The interactions between react/product molecules and catalysts are very important in dehydrogenation process. The effect of Cr loading amount and SiO2/Al2O3 ratio on the catalytic performance of Cr/HZSM-5 catalysts is investigated in detail. The role of Cr species and Brnsted acid sites in Cr/HZSM-5 catalysts is elucidated through physicochemical characterizations, PDH tests, and Na+ doping experiments. Characterization results and Na+ doping experiments reveal that the Cr species combined with Brnsted acid sites in Cr/HZSM-5 catalysts are responsible for the high catalytic performance. The Brnsted acid sites in HZSM-5 zeolite increase propane adsorption and enhance CH bond activation. The high surface area and well-defined pores of HZSM-5 zeolite provide a special environment for the dispersion and stabilization of Cr species, ensuring high catalytic activity and stability. The selection of supports for Cr-based catalysts is crucial for PDH. Zeolites, with their high surface area, well-defined channels, good thermal stability, and tunable acidity, can serve as catalysts or supports for various catalytic reactions. The high amounts of acidic sites of HZSM-5 zeolites are negative for PDH reaction, and only HZSM-5 zeolite with suitable acidic sites can be used as a good support for CrOx catalysts for PDH process. The Brnsted acid sites play an important role in determining the catalytic performance of Cr/Z-5 catalyst system. The Brnsted acid sites in HZSM-5(260) play a key role in propane adsorption and activation, affecting their catalytic performance.

The physicochemical properties of catalysts, including chemical qualities (such as acid strength and stability) and morphological characteristics, significantly influence their performance in dehydrogenation reactions. The equilibrium conversion of alkanes increases with temperature, but alkene selectivity decreases due to an increased tendency toward dehydrocyclization/aromatisation, thermal cracking, and coke formation. The extent of PtSn interactions depends on the impregnation sequence of Pt and Sn precursors on the support material. The framework of microporous zeolites exerts dispersive forces on reactant molecules, which depend on the shape, channel, and cavity of the framework. The nature and density of active sites also influence the framework dispersion forces. Recent reports have shown that the strong electrostatic field between protons or exchanged metal ions and basic oxygen species can enhance and/or induce polarization of bonds in hydrocarbon adsorbates. This polarization effect can be viewed as an intermediate condition to hydride abstraction, an important elementary step in CH activation. The polarizing effect increases with increasing charge magnitude and ionic radius of the alkane polarizing cations. The choice of cations should be such that they exhibit no catalytic effects on the target alkene products at the reaction condition. It may be beneficial to create a CH polarization effect on the zeolite framework by appropriate modification of framework atoms. Active sites are usually created on the zeolite frameworks. The active sites of the bimolecular pathway are formed in situ and are made up of an alkyl carbenium ion ionically held to the zeolite framework oxygen ion. The active sites of the unimolecular pathway are the charge balancing protons of the zeolite framework. A proton and a carbenium ion are electrophilic or Lewis acid species, and the two pathways essentially involve electrophilic CH activation. The exchanged metal ions in zeolites are held ionically by one or more basic oxygen atoms. Different species have been suggested, depending on the density of the cation exchange site of the zeolite and the method of introduction of the metals. High alkene selectivities are obtained on the H-ZSM-5 when exchangeable protons are rigorously replaced by Zn and Ga. The CH activation on the OZn2+O site can be described by a Lewis base-assisted deprotonation mechanism, accompanied by conversion of the Lewis base site to a conjugate Bronsted acid site. The OGa+ site, however, activates the CH bond via oxidative addition without a protonic site intermediate. A protonic site intermediate increases the tendency of side reactions on the Zn-exchanged H-ZSM-5 relative to the Ga counterpart. The elementary steps of CH activation on OGa+ reveal that a redox cycle at the metal center is required for catalytic CH activation via the oxidative addition mechanism. However, under alkane dehydrogenation reaction conditions, the OZn2+O sites can undergo a reversible Zn2+/Zn redox process, increasing the availability of undesired protonic site intermediates. Zn-exchanged H-ZSM-5 prepared by conventional ion-exchange methods contain a significant percentage of unexchanged proton sites, leading to lower alkene selectivity of the catalyst. Another strategy to enhance alkene selectivity is by controlling the strength of the proton sites. The acidity of the sites depends on the nature of the trivalent cation of the zeolite framework. Proton sites in borosilicate zeolites are weaker than those of aluminosilicate, and thus higher alkene selectivity is expected for alkane dehydrogenation over Zn/H[B]-ZSM-5 compared to Zn/H[Al]-ZSM-5. However, Zn/H[B]-ZSM-5 shows no activity for propane dehydrogenation. The desired weaker acidity of the proton sites of Zn/H[B]-ZSM-5 requires weaker basicity of the oxygen atoms in the zeolite framework. This reduced basicity of the oxygen atoms is not sufficiently polarizing to complement the exchanged Zn2+ in CH bond cleavage. Elimination of the proton sites of zeolites is critical for obtaining a high alkene selectivity and stability in dehydrogenation catalysts. Pt is the most versatile noble metal catalyst for alkane reactions, often justified by its higher activity, stability, and selectivity for these reactions compared to less expensive alternative transition metals. However, rapid catalyst deactivation due to coke formation remains a challenge even when using a Pt-based catalyst for dehydrogenation of light alkanes. The presence of acid (Bronsted and Lewis) sites on the supports promotes readsorption, oligomerization, and aromatization of alkenes. Promotion of Pt with metals, such as Sn, Ga, Zn, Re, etc., improves catalyst stability, but also leads to faster deactivation rates than Pt/Na[Fe]-ZSM-5. The role of potassium in commercial Cr and Pt-based dehydrogenation catalysts is to minimize the undesired influence of protonic sites on alkene selectivity. The nature and role of surface oxygen species become more evident. The electronic promotion effect of Sn is in line with the oxidative addition CH activation mechanism. However, the Lewis base-assisted deprotonation mechanism could also explain the proposed CH activation on Cr-based catalysts. A recent report suggests that a porous copper-aluminum framework material (stabilized by metal oxide) has better performance (activity/selectivity/stability) for propane dehydrogenation than a PtSn/Al2O3. The Lewis base-assisted deprotonation mechanism may be invoked here, and the redox property of the metal center is likely to play a role in achieving propane dehydrogenation at 350 C. This should constitute the future research direction for non-oxidative dehydrogenation of lower alkanes.

The physicochemical properties of catalysts, including chemical qualities (such as acid strength and stability) and morphological characteristics, significantly influence their performance in dehydrogenation reactions. For instance, the stability of metal oxides or hydride clusters is influenced by the structure of the zeolite framework, and the pore size of zeolites has a slight effect on the catalytic activity, with lower activation barriers for reactions in zeolites with larger pore size. The optimal distance between active sites, such as AlAl distance in zeolites, can be determined to achieve a minimum overall barrier, based on the Sabatier principle. The ultimate goal of theoretical studies is to identify optimal catalysts for specific chemical processes, and the advancements in computational approaches have enabled the exploration of more complex catalytic systems beyond simple transition-metal surfaces. Case studies have provided insights into dehydrogenation mechanisms in these systems, revealing information that is challenging to obtain at the molecular level even with advanced experimental equipment.

The physicochemical properties of catalysts, including chemical qualities and morphological characteristics, significantly influence their performance in dehydrogenation reactions. The geometric and electronic effects are crucial to catalytic systems, particularly in propane dehydrogenation (PDH). The double decoration of PtGa intermetallics with Pb and Ca is a promising catalyst design concept that synergizes the geometric and electronic promotion effects, leading to an ultra-stable catalytic system for PDH. Pb is used for geometric modification to block Pt3 sites, while Ca acts as an electron-donating agent to enrich the electron density of Pt1 sites, suppressing side reactions. This strategy results in a catalyst with outstanding stability in PDH for up to 1 month at 600C.

The literature does not provide specific information on how physicochemical properties of catalysts influence their performance in dehydrogenation reactions or on support modification strategies to optimize these properties. However, it does discuss the influence of support acidity on the electronic properties of supported metals, and how the presence of metals affects the acidic properties of supports. The study shows that the electronic properties of Pt are influenced by the acidity of the support, and the alteration of Pt properties increases with increasing acidity of the support. At the same time, the presence of platinum affects the acidic properties of the supports by reducing the strength of the acid sites. This is observed directly as the changes in desorption of pyridine from the acid sites and indirectly as the suppression of cracking reactions during the ring opening of decalin on the Pt-modified catalysts. This could potentially impact the catalytic efficiency and selectivity in reactions that require both metal and acid active sites.

The physicochemical properties of catalysts, including chemical qualities and morphological characteristics, significantly influence their performance in dehydrogenation reactions. Al2O3, due to its structural advantages and stability, is commonly used as a support in heterogeneous catalysis. The coordinately unsaturated Al3+ sites on the (100) facets of commercial γ-Al2O3 can serve as anchor sites for atomically dispersed Pt and Ru sites. The specific interaction between Ga2O3 and Al2O3 allows the tetrahedral Ga3+ cations to disperse in the spinel-type γ-Ga2O3-Al2O3 solid solution, enhancing activity and stability in PDH reactions. The γ-Al2O3 nanosheet, containing 27% penta-coordinated Al3+ sites, can disperse and stabilize bimetallic PtSn nanoclusters due to strong interactions between metals and support, leading to excellent performance in long-term PDH reactions at ultrahigh space velocities. Hydroxyl groups-eliminated Al2O3 shows high activity of coordinately unsaturated Al3+ as surface active sites in non-oxidative dehydrogenation of isobutane to isobutylene. The diversity and complexity of Al2O3 structure, such as surface acidity at low-coordinated Al sites, determine different properties in propane adsorption, activation, and coke deposition in PDH reactions. A one-step hydrothermal method synthesizes sheet-shaped CoAl2O3HT catalysts for efficient PDH catalysis, benchmarking structural and catalytic stabilities and CoAl2O3 interactions against an impregnated Co/Al2O3-IMP catalyst. The effect of C3H6 desorption behavior in Co-catalyzed PDH reactions is further illustrated. Support modification strategies, such as the use of γ-Al2O3 nanosheets and the specific interaction between Ga2O3 and Al2O3, can optimize these properties for enhanced catalytic efficiency and selectivity.

The acidity of the catalysts was evaluated by NH3-TPD, revealing that parent H-Beta has both weak and strong acid sites, while Si-Beta lacks acid sites after dealumination. The introduction of Pt species results in trace medium acid sites, and Zn species introduce higher amounts of Lewis acid sites. The presence of Pt in 2Zn/Si-Beta leads to an ammonia desorption peak with much higher intensity, indicating strong interaction between Pt and Zn species. Electron microscopy shows that 0.1Pt-2Zn/Si-Beta appears as small aggregates below 100 nm, with Pt and Zn species having close contact on the Si-Beta support. Infrared spectroscopy monitored the evolution of silanol groups after dealumination and metal incorporation, revealing the formation of Pt-Zn species on Si-Beta zeolite. The local electronic environment of Pt is significant for the PDH process and was investigated by FTIR spectra of CO adsorption. XRD patterns show typical diffraction lines for the BEA topology, with a decline in intensity after Zn introduction. Surface areas of zeolite samples were determined by argon adsorption/desorption isotherms, revealing high surface areas and large micropore volumes for all samples, indicating well-preserved microporous structures after dealumination and metal incorporation. The introduction of Pt species via impregnation does not change the dispersion of Zn species on Si-Beta support. The close contact between Pt-Zn species and the electronic interaction thereof make Pt-Zn/Si-Beta robust PDH catalysts.

The physicochemical properties of catalysts, including chemical qualities and morphological characteristics, significantly influence their performance in dehydrogenation reactions. The addition of excess NaCl contributes to the stability of propane dehydrogenation MFI-zeolite catalysts. NaCl promotes the dispersion of Pt, prevents sintering during calcination, and effectively suppresses zeolite acidity. Washing the catalysts after calcination further increases their activity and stability due to the redispersion of water-soluble chlorinated Pt compounds. High external surface acid site concentrations, specific Na/Pt atomic ratios, calcination temperatures, washing with water, and the order of component introduction all contribute to improved Pt dispersion and catalyst stability.

The stability of Pt particles on the surface of supports can be significantly improved by manipulating metal-support interactions. Al2O3 with coordinatively unsaturated pentacoordinate Al3+ sites can stabilize atomically dispersed Pt species by forming Al3+ penta-O-Pt bonds, anchoring Pt particles on the Al2O3 surface. Pt particles can also be tightly stabilized on heteroatoms in the oxide substrate lattice. Small Pt particles stabilized in lattice-confined Sn (IV/II) produce a highly selective and stable Pt-Sn catalyst for propane dehydrogenation. Pt particles confined at the Sn single-site in the zeolite framework exhibit high catalytic performance in propane dehydrogenation, mainly due to the strong interaction between Pt particles and the Sn-zeolite framework. The PtSn bimetallic particles confined in the mesopores of hierarchical ZSM-5 zeolite allow them to become a stable catalyst in propane dehydrogenation at high temperatures. The high efficiency of PtSn/hierarchical ZSM-5 catalysts in propane dehydrogenation is mainly attributed to the confinement of PtSn particles in the mesopores of hierarchical ZSM-5 zeolite.

The physicochemical properties of catalysts, including chemical qualities and morphological characteristics, significantly influence their performance in dehydrogenation reactions. For instance, the coordination saturation of Pt atoms affects the selectivity of propane dehydrogenation, while the unsaturated Pt atoms can catalyze side reactions, leading to carbon deposition. The adsorption configuration and strength of propylene are closely related to the surface structures, which governs the formation of coke. The acidity and coke mobility of the support also play a role in inhibiting coke formation. Various strategies have been proposed to inhibit coke formation, such as geometric separation, electron richness, poisoning acid sites, cofeeding streams, enhancing oxygen mobility, and coke transfer. The textural properties of supports, such as specific surface area, acid-base properties, and thermal stability, have significant influences on the catalytic performance of Pt-based catalysts. To prevent the occurrence of undesirable coke and alkane isomerization on supports, the support acidity should be carefully controlled. Supports with high surface area and uniform pore size distribution are preferred to increase the dispersion of metal particles. Alkaline metals, such as Li, Na, and K, can help poison the strong acid sites and avoid the coke deposition on the Al2O3 surface. Doping Mg into Al2O3 forms a stable spinel phase. Al2O3 nanosheets with abundant penta-coordinate Al atoms have a strong metal-support interaction owing to their capacity for anchoring Pt atoms, which accounts for their high stability. Due to the weak interaction between Pt and SiO2, Pt-based bimetals with high alloying degrees such as PtM intermetallic alloys can be formed by direct H2 pretreatment on SiO2 supports. Comparatively, there exist strong interactions between CeO2 and metal particles, where Pt atoms can be trapped in the form of Pt ions. Additionally, upon using water vapor, the coke deposition could be eliminated accounting for the redox properties of CeO2 under propane dehydrogenation. The adjustable Si/Al ratios and relatively large surface areas can hinder the formation of large hydrocarbon molecules, thus preventing the so-called coke deposits and improving the catalytic stability. Besides, some mesoporous materials, such as SBA-1561 and MCM-41, are often used as the catalyst supports to disperse the active phase with more active sites and less coke deposition. Two-dimensional (2D) early transition metal carbides, i.e., MXenes, due to their well-defined structures and tunable compositions have attracted much attention. Additionally, carbon materials have been widely used for plenty of reactions because of their large surface area, chemical inertness and stability in acidic/basic media. Novel nanostructured carbon materials including carbon nanotubes and graphene as supports have been gradually developed. Obviously, each specific support has its own characteristic and may exhibit a distinctive effect on the catalytic property. It can not only change the selectivity by influencing the component, morphology and distribution of metal particles but also alter the reaction stability by increasing mechanical strength, anti-sintering and anti-coking resistance.

The physicochemical properties of catalysts, including chemical qualities and morphological characteristics, have a significant impact on their performance in dehydrogenation reactions. For example, the surface area-to-metal loading ratio determines the formation of different vanadium species, which affects the catalytic activity. The reducibility of vanadium species also influences the catalytic performance. The addition of MgO can improve the selectivity of vanadium-based catalysts by reducing coke formation. Using silica to dope alumina support can enhance the stability and activity of vanadium oxide catalysts. The type of support and preparation conditions can affect the formation of molybdenum oxide species. Hydrogen reduction can increase conversion but decrease selectivity due to the formation of acid sites. The structure of the support, such as mesoporous GaAl mixed oxide, can increase the resistance to catalyst coking. Poisoning Brnsted acid sites with K can reduce coke formation. Alumina is the most common support, and various methods have been explored to produce chromia-alumina catalysts. The choice of support can also influence the stability and dispersion of the active phase, which in turn affects the catalytic efficiency and selectivity. For example, zirconia has been investigated as an alternative support due to its low surface acidity and enhanced sintering resistance, which can improve the performance of chromia-based catalysts. The acidity of the support can also play a role in catalytic behavior, as demonstrated by the study of porous chromia-pillared α-zirconium phosphate materials. Support modification strategies, such as doping with alkali metals or using mixed oxides, can optimize these properties for enhanced catalytic efficiency and selectivity. For instance, doping with alkali metals can stabilize the structure of the support, reduce surface acidity, and increase the number of active sites. Using mixed oxides can also improve the thermal stability and coking resistance of the catalysts. The surface area-to-metal loading ratio determines the formation of monomeric, polymeric, or crystalline vanadium species on the catalyst. Hydroxyl groups on the support surface are important for anchoring vanadium precursors, while acid sites are detrimental to catalyst performance. Silica doping of alumina support can improve catalyst stability and activity. Addition of MgO can improve dehydrogenation selectivity by reducing coke formation. The reducibility of vanadium species depends on their molecular structure. Molybdenum oxide can exist as monomers, polymers, or crystallites, depending on loading, support, and preparation conditions. Optimal molybdenum oxide activity is achieved with monolayer coverage on alumina. Hydrogen reduction of molybdenum oxide catalyst increases conversion but decreases selectivity. Ga2O3 polymorphs, particularly β-Ga2O3, have high concentration of weak Lewis acid sites for dehydrogenation activity. Coordinatively unsaturated tetrahedral Ga3+ cations are crucial for dehydrogenation activity. High concentration of Lewis acid groups in the form of Ga3+ cations is necessary for dehydrogenation activity. Zeolitic support with low medium and strong acid sites and high weak acid sites leads to most active and stable GaO3/H-ZSM-5 catalyst. Promotion with a base like potassium decreases activity, indicating acidic groups catalyze the reaction. Mesoporous GaAl mixed oxide has increased resistance to coking. Potassium reduces coke formation by poisoning Brnsted acid sites. Platinum acts as a promoter for GaOx, enhancing conversion and selectivity. Platinum assists hydrogen desorption, facilitating regeneration of gallium hydride hydroxide species. The nature of active sites in Ga-based dehydrogenation catalysts is still under debate. Molybdenum oxide can exist as monomers, polymers, or crystallites, depending on loading, support, and preparation conditions. Hydrogen reduction of catalyst increases conversion but decreases selectivity due to acid site formation. The physicochemical properties of catalysts, including chemical qualities and morphological characteristics, significantly influence their performance in dehydrogenation reactions. Alumina is the most common support, and its interaction with the active phase can profoundly impact catalyst activity and selectivity. Noble metals, particularly platinum, are preferred for their superior activation of paraffinic CH bonds and low activity for CC cleavage. The addition of alkaline metals like lithium, sodium, and potassium can poison acid sites on the support, suppressing coke formation. Zirconia is an alternative support that has been investigated, offering low surface acidity and enhanced sintering resistance. Silica requires a high surface area to stabilize Cr6+ sites. Mixed oxides prepared using layered double hydroxide precursors have also been studied for nonoxidative dehydrogenation reactions. The acidity of the support material, such as in chromia-pillared α-zirconium phosphate, can significantly affect catalytic behavior. The physicochemical properties of catalysts, including chemical qualities and morphological characteristics, significantly influence their performance in dehydrogenation reactions. The surface area-to-metal loading ratio determines the formation of different vanadium species, which affects the catalytic activity. The presence of hydroxyl groups on the support surface is crucial for anchoring vanadium precursors, while large V2O5 crystallites are inactive in dehydrogenation. The reducibility of vanadium species depends on their molecular structure, and the reduction of the catalyst by the hydrocarbon feed results in the formation of V4+ and V3+. Initially, deactivation is caused by the strong adsorption of reactants on the active sites and coke deposition. The calcination of the catalyst can remove coke but may further deactivate the catalyst due to the formation of larger V2O5 crystallites or mixed oxides. V2O5 crystallites can revert to active polymeric vanadium species under certain conditions. The addition of CO2 can have a beneficial effect on the catalyst by removing acid sites, facilitating coke gasification, and promoting hydrogen removal. The effect of CO2 depends on the catalyst support, with relatively weak basic sites on activated carbon support facilitating the reverse water gas shift reaction, while strong basic sites on Al2O3 and ZnO2 can be poisoned by CO2. Using silica to dope the alumina support can improve catalyst stability and activity. The addition of MgO can improve the performance of supported vanadium catalysts by reducing coke formation. The physicochemical properties of catalysts, including chemical qualities and morphological characteristics, significantly influence their performance in dehydrogenation reactions. The nature of the support is crucial as it not only determines the mechanical properties of the catalyst but also affects the interaction between the carrier and the active phase, which can profoundly impact catalyst activity and selectivity. For instance, alumina is the most common support, and the method of producing chromia-alumina catalysts can vary, affecting the catalyst's performance. The choice of support can also influence the catalytic activity, with different supports leading to varying orders of activity based on conversion and yield. Zirconia, as an alternative support, has been investigated for its low surface acidity and enhanced sintering resistance. Silica requires a high surface area to stabilize Cr6+ sites, and mixed oxides prepared using layered double hydroxide precursors have been studied for their catalytic properties in dehydrogenation reactions. The acidity of the support, as seen in chromia-pillared α-zirconium phosphate materials, can also influence catalytic behavior, with strong acid sites affecting cracking reactions and medium strength acid sites impacting dehydrogenation reactions. Support modification strategies can be employed to optimize the properties of catalysts for enhanced catalytic efficiency and selectivity. For example, doping alumina-based dehydrogenation catalysts with alkali ions can effectively poison undesirable acid sites, improving selectivity. Using zirconia as a support can prevent the formation of mixed oxides and offer higher thermal stability and surface area. Silica, with its high surface area, can stabilize Cr6+ sites, while mixed oxides prepared using layered double hydroxide precursors can provide improved coking resistance and thermal stability against sintering. Understanding the role of acidity in catalytic behavior can also guide the modification of supports to favor dehydrogenation reactions over cracking reactions. The physicochemical properties of catalysts, including chemical qualities and morphological characteristics, significantly influence their performance in dehydrogenation reactions. For instance, the nature of the support material, such as alumina, zirconia, or silica, can affect the dispersion and stability of the active phase, thereby impacting the catalytic activity and selectivity. The interaction between the support and the active phase can also alter the electronic properties of the catalyst, which can further enhance its performance. Support modification strategies, such as doping with alkali metals or using mixed oxides, can optimize these properties for enhanced catalytic efficiency and selectivity. For example, doping with alkali metals can reduce surface acidity and increase the number of active sites, while using mixed oxides can improve thermal stability and coking resistance.

The physicochemical properties of catalysts, including chemical qualities such as acid strength and stability, and morphological characteristics, significantly influence their performance in dehydrogenation reactions. The stability and tolerance to carbon deposits of Zr-Al-Beta promoted by alkali-metal ions were demonstrated. The modification of alkali-metal ions on both Lewis acid sites and Brnsted acid sites in Zr-Al-Beta was evidenced by XPS and FT-IR spectroscopy. The untreated materials displayed poor product selectivity and high coke deposit in the Meerwein-Ponndorf-Verley reduction of furfural and isopropanol; however, the treatment of alkali-metal ions promoted their catalytic performance with improved recalcitrance to deactivation and coking significantly. The type of alkali-metal ions and the concentration of alkaline solution influenced the catalytic performance, which were found to correlate to the acidity and textual properties. The optimum reaction result (97.3% yield of furfuryl alcohol at 99.6% conversion of furfural) can be obtained on 0.025 M-Na+-Zr-Al-Beta with high tolerance to the furfural concentration. Support modification strategies can be employed to optimize these properties for enhanced catalytic efficiency and selectivity by tuning and normalizing the various acidic sites of zeolites. For instance, the post-synthetic method is demonstrated to be preferential to form open sites, which have stronger Lewis acidic properties than the closed sites. The simple post-synthetic strategy to prepare a Zr-Al-Beta zeolite with both plentiful Lewis acid open Zr (IV) sites and Brnsted acid sites has shown a superior catalytic activity, water-tolerance ability, and reusability in the cascade conversion of cinnamaldehyde toward 1-cinnamyl 2-propyl ether. The controllable tuning for the acid properties with various active sites is greatly required to promote some of the chemical transformations and avoid the possibility of other undesired reaction pathways except for the aimed reaction route, such as dehydration, polymerization, and isomerization.

The physicochemical properties of catalysts, including chemical qualities and morphological characteristics, significantly impact their performance in dehydrogenation reactions. Chemical qualities, such as acid strength and stability, affect the selectivity toward the targeted alkene, while morphological and porous qualities influence the diffusion efficiency. Support modification strategies, summarized in Table 3, can optimize these properties for enhanced catalytic efficiency and selectivity. Proper acidity of the support is crucial for CH activation and propylene desorption in PDH reactions, while excessive acidity can lead to negative impacts such as CC cracking and deep dehydrogenation. For zeolites, Lewis acid sites are preferred for propane dehydrogenation, whereas Brnsted acid sites catalyze cleavage reactions. The diffusion efficiency of reactants and products in heterogeneous catalysts is determined by the morphology, structure, size, and chemical properties of the supports. Strategies to enhance catalytic efficiency include developing nanosized supports and synthesizing supports with specific morphologies and high external surfaces.

The physicochemical properties of catalysts, including chemical qualities and morphological characteristics, significantly influence their performance in dehydrogenation reactions. The decrease of acid centers of Al2O3 and the increase of the degree of alloy formation upon addition of Ca lead to enhanced propylene selectivity and catalyst stability. The deactivation model with residual activity (DMRA) was used to fit the experimental data of propane conversion vs. time, which allowed for the calculation of the intrinsic deactivation kinetic parameters for both catalysts. The Ca-promoted catalyst showed a lower deactivation function and higher residual activity, indicating better resistance against deactivation by coke. The activation energy of the PDH reaction for the Ca-promoted catalyst was slightly higher due to the enhanced reduction of the GeOx species, which enhanced the formation of a Pt-Ge alloy, decreasing the initial activity of the catalyst. However, this also led to better performance in terms of both activity and selectivity at steady state conditions. Support modification strategies, such as the addition of Ca, can optimize these properties for enhanced catalytic efficiency and selectivity.

The physicochemical properties of catalysts, including chemical qualities such as acid strength and stability, play a crucial role in their performance in dehydrogenation reactions. The Lewis acid site, arising from the unsaturated AlIII site in the Al2O3 structure, is the active site for the catalytic cycle. The amount of Lewis acid sites in Al2O3 is positively linked to the propane conversion rate, indicating their importance in propane dehydrogenation. Morphological characteristics, such as the crystalline structure, also influence catalytic performance. γ-Al2O3 possesses more Lewis acid sites than θ-Al2O3, which contributes to its higher activity. The regenerability of the γ-Al2O3-200 catalyst, which can be restored after deactivation, is an important property for practical applications. Support modification strategies, such as controlling the crystalline structure and increasing the number of Lewis acid sites, can be employed to optimize these properties for enhanced catalytic efficiency and selectivity.

The γ-Al2O3-200 catalyst, with a high level of strong acid sites, shows the highest yield in propane dehydrogenation. The formation of Lewis acid sites in Al2O3 is mainly due to the defective AIII site in the structure. The propane conversion rate is positively linked to the amount of Lewis acid sites in Al2O3, indicating that the Lewis acid sites are the active sites for propane dehydrogenation.

The physicochemical properties of catalysts, including chemical qualities and morphological characteristics, significantly influence their performance in dehydrogenation reactions. The use of a diammonium-type bromide surfactant and a sodium-free silica source in the synthesis procedure leads to the formation of silanol nests in the zeolite, which are confirmed by IR and NMR spectroscopies. These silanol nests play a critical role in the formation of intermetallic alloy nanoparticles, such as Pt3Y, which exhibit high catalytic durability, high propane conversion, and propylene selectivity in propane dehydrogenation. The alloy nanoparticles show fully reversible hydrogen chemisorption behavior at room temperature, unlike monometallic Pt nanoparticles. The nanoparticles are homogeneously distributed throughout the support material, with a size of approximately 2 nm. The EDS analysis confirms that these metal nanoparticles contain both Pt and Y in the same particle, with an average atomic ratio of Pt to Y of approximately 3. The PtY(0.5)/MZ-sf-Br and PtY(0.5)/MZ-sf-OH catalysts show superior catalytic durability compared to PtY(0.5)/MZ-dg. The catalysts supported on silanol nest-containing zeolites have an activation period to reach full conversion. The propane conversion is higher than the equilibrium value during the early reaction period. The TGA profile for the spent PtY(0.5)/MZ-sf-Br catalyst shows that 37 wt% of coke species are deposited on the catalyst sample. The PtY(0.5)/MZ-sf-Br catalyst exhibits slow deactivation over 20 days, while PtY(0.5)/MZ-sf-Br-NaCl is deactivated within 1 day, similar to Pt(0.5)/MZ-sc. Support modification strategies, such as the use of a diammonium-type bromide surfactant and a sodium-free silica source, can optimize the properties of zeolite supports for enhanced catalytic efficiency and selectivity in dehydrogenation reactions.

The physicochemical properties of catalysts, including chemical qualities and morphological characteristics, significantly influence their performance in dehydrogenation reactions. Catalysts synthesized by wet impregnation method, such as CrOx supported on high-silica HZSM-5 with a SiO2/Al2O3 ratio of 260, exhibit high catalytic activity, good selectivity, and excellent stability for PDH. The exploitation of an efficient PDH catalyst based on HZSM-5 zeolite to achieve both high selectivity and stability is still a challenge. In zeolite supported catalysts, zeolite provides a special environment for catalytic reactions, including channel confinement effects, acidic sites, and electron transfer. Acidic sites in zeolites play a key role in determining the catalytic performance of zeolite catalysts in alkane conversion. The role of Cr species and Brnsted acid sites in Cr/HZSM-5 catalysts is elucidated through physicochemical characterizations, PDH tests, and Na+ doping experiments. The structural properties of the prepared CrOx catalysts are detected by N2 sorption technique. The XRD patterns of parent HZSM-5(260) and Cr/Z-5(260) samples are similar, indicating that the Cr loading has little influence on the crystallite structure of HZSM-5 zeolite. The acidity properties of the prepared Cr/Z-5, Cr/SiO2, and Cr/Al2O3 catalysts are detected by NH3-TPD technique. The metal-support interactions between Cr species and HZSM-5 support are measured by XPS spectroscopy. During the PDH tests, the high reaction temperature results in coke formation onto the catalyst, which is the main cause of catalyst deactivation. The interactions between react/product molecules and catalysts are very important in dehydrogenation process. The effect of Cr loading amount and SiO2/Al2O3 ratio on the catalytic performance of Cr/HZSM-5 catalysts is investigated in detail. The role of Cr species and Brnsted acid sites in Cr/HZSM-5 catalysts is elucidated through physicochemical characterizations, PDH tests, and Na+ doping experiments. Characterization results and Na+ doping experiments reveal that the Cr species combined with Brnsted acid sites in Cr/HZSM-5 catalysts are responsible for the high catalytic performance. The Brnsted acid sites in HZSM-5 zeolite increase propane adsorption and enhance CH bond activation. The high surface area and well-defined pores of HZSM-5 zeolite provide a special environment for the dispersion and stabilization of Cr species, ensuring high catalytic activity and stability. The selection of supports for Cr-based catalysts is crucial for PDH. Zeolites, with their high surface area, well-defined channels, good thermal stability, and tunable acidity, can serve as catalysts or supports for various catalytic reactions. The high amounts of acidic sites of HZSM-5 zeolites are negative for PDH reaction, and only HZSM-5 zeolite with suitable acidic sites can be used as a good support for CrOx catalysts for PDH process. The Brnsted acid sites play an important role in determining the catalytic performance of Cr/Z-5 catalyst system. The Brnsted acid sites in HZSM-5(260) play a key role in propane adsorption and activation, affecting their catalytic performance.

The physicochemical properties of catalysts, including chemical qualities and morphological characteristics, significantly influence their performance in dehydrogenation reactions. The crystallization temperature of the support directly affects the catalytic performance of VOx/Al2O3 catalysts by increasing Lewis acid sites and influencing the distribution of different surface V species. P modification can decrease the degree of VOx polymerization, enhancing catalyst stability and activity. Mg modification can improve catalytic performance and anti-coking capability by dispersing V2O5 crystallites and increasing active V3+ species. Gelation and calcination temperatures also impact the catalytic performance of VOx/SiO2 catalysts in terms of propane conversion, propene selectivity, and yield of propene. Dealuminated beta zeolites (Si-beta) are promising catalyst supports due to their high surface area and thermal stability, and the initial propane conversion linearly increases with the amount of acid sites. VOx/ZrO2 is more active than VOx/Al2O3 and pure ZrO2 due to the facile reduction of VO, VOV, and VOZr bonds, producing higher proportions of the active V3+ species. The balance of acid and base sites on the catalyst surface is crucial for all dehydrogenation methods. The development of an active, selective, and stable catalyst is essential for dehydrogenation to be considered a viable process in the future. Support modification strategies can optimize these properties for enhanced catalytic efficiency and selectivity. Using supports with ordered mesoporosity and moderate surface acidity can aid mass transfer and avoid undesirable secondary reactions. Promoting elements can cause beneficial geometric and electronic effects on both the supports and active species. However, environmental and safety concerns exist in the preparation, usage, and disposal of certain catalysts due to their toxicity. Ga catalysts, while less active than Pt and Cr catalysts, have the advantage of being benign and inexpensive. The nature of the support is essential for vanadium-based catalysts, as the metalsupport interactions affect the resultant catalyst performance. The activity is dependent on the bond strength of the VOsupport bond, and catalyst performance is affected by different supports.

The physicochemical properties of catalysts, including chemical qualities (such as acid strength and stability) and morphological characteristics, significantly influence their performance in dehydrogenation reactions. The equilibrium conversion of alkanes increases with temperature, but alkene selectivity decreases due to an increased tendency toward dehydrocyclization/aromatisation, thermal cracking, and coke formation. The extent of PtSn interactions depends on the impregnation sequence of Pt and Sn precursors on the support material. The framework of microporous zeolites exerts dispersive forces on reactant molecules, which depend on the shape, channel, and cavity of the framework. The nature and density of active sites also influence the framework dispersion forces. Recent reports have shown that the strong electrostatic field between protons or exchanged metal ions and basic oxygen species can enhance and/or induce polarization of bonds in hydrocarbon adsorbates. This polarization effect can be viewed as an intermediate condition to hydride abstraction, an important elementary step in CH activation. The polarizing effect increases with increasing charge magnitude and ionic radius of the alkane polarizing cations. The choice of cations should be such that they exhibit no catalytic effects on the target alkene products at the reaction condition. It may be beneficial to create a CH polarization effect on the zeolite framework by appropriate modification of framework atoms. Active sites are usually created on the zeolite frameworks. The active sites of the bimolecular pathway are formed in situ and are made up of an alkyl carbenium ion ionically held to the zeolite framework oxygen ion. The active sites of the unimolecular pathway are the charge balancing protons of the zeolite framework. A proton and a carbenium ion are electrophilic or Lewis acid species, and the two pathways essentially involve electrophilic CH activation. The exchanged metal ions in zeolites are held ionically by one or more basic oxygen atoms. Different species have been suggested, depending on the density of the cation exchange site of the zeolite and the method of introduction of the metals. High alkene selectivities are obtained on the H-ZSM-5 when exchangeable protons are rigorously replaced by Zn and Ga. The CH activation on the OZn2+O site can be described by a Lewis base-assisted deprotonation mechanism, accompanied by conversion of the Lewis base site to a conjugate Bronsted acid site. The OGa+ site, however, activates the CH bond via oxidative addition without a protonic site intermediate. A protonic site intermediate increases the tendency of side reactions on the Zn-exchanged H-ZSM-5 relative to the Ga counterpart. The elementary steps of CH activation on OGa+ reveal that a redox cycle at the metal center is required for catalytic CH activation via the oxidative addition mechanism. However, under alkane dehydrogenation reaction conditions, the OZn2+O sites can undergo a reversible Zn2+/Zn redox process, increasing the availability of undesired protonic site intermediates. Zn-exchanged H-ZSM-5 prepared by conventional ion-exchange methods contain a significant percentage of unexchanged proton sites, leading to lower alkene selectivity of the catalyst. Another strategy to enhance alkene selectivity is by controlling the strength of the proton sites. The acidity of the sites depends on the nature of the trivalent cation of the zeolite framework. Proton sites in borosilicate zeolites are weaker than those of aluminosilicate, and thus higher alkene selectivity is expected for alkane dehydrogenation over Zn/H[B]-ZSM-5 compared to Zn/H[Al]-ZSM-5. However, Zn/H[B]-ZSM-5 shows no activity for propane dehydrogenation. The desired weaker acidity of the proton sites of Zn/H[B]-ZSM-5 requires weaker basicity of the oxygen atoms in the zeolite framework. This reduced basicity of the oxygen atoms is not sufficiently polarizing to complement the exchanged Zn2+ in CH bond cleavage. Elimination of the proton sites of zeolites is critical for obtaining a high alkene selectivity and stability in dehydrogenation catalysts. Pt is the most versatile noble metal catalyst for alkane reactions, often justified by its higher activity, stability, and selectivity for these reactions compared to less expensive alternative transition metals. However, rapid catalyst deactivation due to coke formation remains a challenge even when using a Pt-based catalyst for dehydrogenation of light alkanes. The presence of acid (Bronsted and Lewis) sites on the supports promotes readsorption, oligomerization, and aromatization of alkenes. Promotion of Pt with metals, such as Sn, Ga, Zn, Re, etc., improves catalyst stability, but also leads to faster deactivation rates than Pt/Na[Fe]-ZSM-5. The role of potassium in commercial Cr and Pt-based dehydrogenation catalysts is to minimize the undesired influence of protonic sites on alkene selectivity. The nature and role of surface oxygen species become more evident. The electronic promotion effect of Sn is in line with the oxidative addition CH activation mechanism. However, the Lewis base-assisted deprotonation mechanism could also explain the proposed CH activation on Cr-based catalysts. A recent report suggests that a porous copper-aluminum framework material (stabilized by metal oxide) has better performance (activity/selectivity/stability) for propane dehydrogenation than a PtSn/Al2O3. The Lewis base-assisted deprotonation mechanism may be invoked here, and the redox property of the metal center is likely to play a role in achieving propane dehydrogenation at 350 C. This should constitute the future research direction for non-oxidative dehydrogenation of lower alkanes.

The physicochemical properties of catalysts, including chemical qualities (such as acid strength and stability) and morphological characteristics, significantly influence their performance in dehydrogenation reactions. For instance, the stability of metal oxides or hydride clusters is influenced by the structure of the zeolite framework, and the pore size of zeolites has a slight effect on the catalytic activity, with lower activation barriers for reactions in zeolites with larger pore size. The optimal distance between active sites, such as AlAl distance in zeolites, can be determined to achieve a minimum overall barrier, based on the Sabatier principle. The ultimate goal of theoretical studies is to identify optimal catalysts for specific chemical processes, and the advancements in computational approaches have enabled the exploration of more complex catalytic systems beyond simple transition-metal surfaces. Case studies have provided insights into dehydrogenation mechanisms in these systems, revealing information that is challenging to obtain at the molecular level even with advanced experimental equipment.

The physicochemical properties of catalysts, including chemical qualities and morphological characteristics, significantly influence their performance in dehydrogenation reactions. The geometric and electronic effects are crucial to catalytic systems, particularly in propane dehydrogenation (PDH). The double decoration of PtGa intermetallics with Pb and Ca is a promising catalyst design concept that synergizes the geometric and electronic promotion effects, leading to an ultra-stable catalytic system for PDH. Pb is used for geometric modification to block Pt3 sites, while Ca acts as an electron-donating agent to enrich the electron density of Pt1 sites, suppressing side reactions. This strategy results in a catalyst with outstanding stability in PDH for up to 1 month at 600C.

The literature does not provide specific information on how physicochemical properties of catalysts influence their performance in dehydrogenation reactions or on support modification strategies to optimize these properties. However, it does discuss the influence of support acidity on the electronic properties of supported metals, and how the presence of metals affects the acidic properties of supports. The study shows that the electronic properties of Pt are influenced by the acidity of the support, and the alteration of Pt properties increases with increasing acidity of the support. At the same time, the presence of platinum affects the acidic properties of the supports by reducing the strength of the acid sites. This is observed directly as the changes in desorption of pyridine from the acid sites and indirectly as the suppression of cracking reactions during the ring opening of decalin on the Pt-modified catalysts. This could potentially impact the catalytic efficiency and selectivity in reactions that require both metal and acid active sites.

The physicochemical properties of catalysts, including chemical qualities and morphological characteristics, significantly influence their performance in dehydrogenation reactions. Al2O3, due to its structural advantages and stability, is commonly used as a support in heterogeneous catalysis. The coordinately unsaturated Al3+ sites on the (100) facets of commercial γ-Al2O3 can serve as anchor sites for atomically dispersed Pt and Ru sites. The specific interaction between Ga2O3 and Al2O3 allows the tetrahedral Ga3+ cations to disperse in the spinel-type γ-Ga2O3-Al2O3 solid solution, enhancing activity and stability in PDH reactions. The γ-Al2O3 nanosheet, containing 27% penta-coordinated Al3+ sites, can disperse and stabilize bimetallic PtSn nanoclusters due to strong interactions between metals and support, leading to excellent performance in long-term PDH reactions at ultrahigh space velocities. Hydroxyl groups-eliminated Al2O3 shows high activity of coordinately unsaturated Al3+ as surface active sites in non-oxidative dehydrogenation of isobutane to isobutylene. The diversity and complexity of Al2O3 structure, such as surface acidity at low-coordinated Al sites, determine different properties in propane adsorption, activation, and coke deposition in PDH reactions. A one-step hydrothermal method synthesizes sheet-shaped CoAl2O3HT catalysts for efficient PDH catalysis, benchmarking structural and catalytic stabilities and CoAl2O3 interactions against an impregnated Co/Al2O3-IMP catalyst. The effect of C3H6 desorption behavior in Co-catalyzed PDH reactions is further illustrated. Support modification strategies, such as the use of γ-Al2O3 nanosheets and the specific interaction between Ga2O3 and Al2O3, can optimize these properties for enhanced catalytic efficiency and selectivity.

The acidity of the catalysts was evaluated by NH3-TPD, revealing that parent H-Beta has both weak and strong acid sites, while Si-Beta lacks acid sites after dealumination. The introduction of Pt species results in trace medium acid sites, and Zn species introduce higher amounts of Lewis acid sites. The presence of Pt in 2Zn/Si-Beta leads to an ammonia desorption peak with much higher intensity, indicating strong interaction between Pt and Zn species. Electron microscopy shows that 0.1Pt-2Zn/Si-Beta appears as small aggregates below 100 nm, with Pt and Zn species having close contact on the Si-Beta support. Infrared spectroscopy monitored the evolution of silanol groups after dealumination and metal incorporation, revealing the formation of Pt-Zn species on Si-Beta zeolite. The local electronic environment of Pt is significant for the PDH process and was investigated by FTIR spectra of CO adsorption. XRD patterns show typical diffraction lines for the BEA topology, with a decline in intensity after Zn introduction. Surface areas of zeolite samples were determined by argon adsorption/desorption isotherms, revealing high surface areas and large micropore volumes for all samples, indicating well-preserved microporous structures after dealumination and metal incorporation. The introduction of Pt species via impregnation does not change the dispersion of Zn species on Si-Beta support. The close contact between Pt-Zn species and the electronic interaction thereof make Pt-Zn/Si-Beta robust PDH catalysts.

The physicochemical properties of catalysts, including chemical qualities and morphological characteristics, significantly influence their performance in dehydrogenation reactions. The addition of excess NaCl contributes to the stability of propane dehydrogenation MFI-zeolite catalysts. NaCl promotes the dispersion of Pt, prevents sintering during calcination, and effectively suppresses zeolite acidity. Washing the catalysts after calcination further increases their activity and stability due to the redispersion of water-soluble chlorinated Pt compounds. High external surface acid site concentrations, specific Na/Pt atomic ratios, calcination temperatures, washing with water, and the order of component introduction all contribute to improved Pt dispersion and catalyst stability.

The stability of Pt particles on the surface of supports can be significantly improved by manipulating metal-support interactions. Al2O3 with coordinatively unsaturated pentacoordinate Al3+ sites can stabilize atomically dispersed Pt species by forming Al3+ penta-O-Pt bonds, anchoring Pt particles on the Al2O3 surface. Pt particles can also be tightly stabilized on heteroatoms in the oxide substrate lattice. Small Pt particles stabilized in lattice-confined Sn (IV/II) produce a highly selective and stable Pt-Sn catalyst for propane dehydrogenation. Pt particles confined at the Sn single-site in the zeolite framework exhibit high catalytic performance in propane dehydrogenation, mainly due to the strong interaction between Pt particles and the Sn-zeolite framework. The PtSn bimetallic particles confined in the mesopores of hierarchical ZSM-5 zeolite allow them to become a stable catalyst in propane dehydrogenation at high temperatures. The high efficiency of PtSn/hierarchical ZSM-5 catalysts in propane dehydrogenation is mainly attributed to the confinement of PtSn particles in the mesopores of hierarchical ZSM-5 zeolite.

The physicochemical properties of catalysts, including chemical qualities and morphological characteristics, significantly influence their performance in dehydrogenation reactions. For instance, the coordination saturation of Pt atoms affects the selectivity of propane dehydrogenation, while the unsaturated Pt atoms can catalyze side reactions, leading to carbon deposition. The adsorption configuration and strength of propylene are closely related to the surface structures, which governs the formation of coke. The acidity and coke mobility of the support also play a role in inhibiting coke formation. Various strategies have been proposed to inhibit coke formation, such as geometric separation, electron richness, poisoning acid sites, cofeeding streams, enhancing oxygen mobility, and coke transfer. The textural properties of supports, such as specific surface area, acid-base properties, and thermal stability, have significant influences on the catalytic performance of Pt-based catalysts. To prevent the occurrence of undesirable coke and alkane isomerization on supports, the support acidity should be carefully controlled. Supports with high surface area and uniform pore size distribution are preferred to increase the dispersion of metal particles. Alkaline metals, such as Li, Na, and K, can help poison the strong acid sites and avoid the coke deposition on the Al2O3 surface. Doping Mg into Al2O3 forms a stable spinel phase. Al2O3 nanosheets with abundant penta-coordinate Al atoms have a strong metal-support interaction owing to their capacity for anchoring Pt atoms, which accounts for their high stability. Due to the weak interaction between Pt and SiO2, Pt-based bimetals with high alloying degrees such as PtM intermetallic alloys can be formed by direct H2 pretreatment on SiO2 supports. Comparatively, there exist strong interactions between CeO2 and metal particles, where Pt atoms can be trapped in the form of Pt ions. Additionally, upon using water vapor, the coke deposition could be eliminated accounting for the redox properties of CeO2 under propane dehydrogenation. The adjustable Si/Al ratios and relatively large surface areas can hinder the formation of large hydrocarbon molecules, thus preventing the so-called coke deposits and improving the catalytic stability. Besides, some mesoporous materials, such as SBA-1561 and MCM-41, are often used as the catalyst supports to disperse the active phase with more active sites and less coke deposition. Two-dimensional (2D) early transition metal carbides, i.e., MXenes, due to their well-defined structures and tunable compositions have attracted much attention. Additionally, carbon materials have been widely used for plenty of reactions because of their large surface area, chemical inertness and stability in acidic/basic media. Novel nanostructured carbon materials including carbon nanotubes and graphene as supports have been gradually developed. Obviously, each specific support has its own characteristic and may exhibit a distinctive effect on the catalytic property. It can not only change the selectivity by influencing the component, morphology and distribution of metal particles but also alter the reaction stability by increasing mechanical strength, anti-sintering and anti-coking resistance.

The physicochemical properties of catalysts, including chemical qualities and morphological characteristics, have a significant impact on their performance in dehydrogenation reactions. For example, the surface area-to-metal loading ratio determines the formation of different vanadium species, which affects the catalytic activity. The reducibility of vanadium species also influences the catalytic performance. The addition of MgO can improve the selectivity of vanadium-based catalysts by reducing coke formation. Using silica to dope alumina support can enhance the stability and activity of vanadium oxide catalysts. The type of support and preparation conditions can affect the formation of molybdenum oxide species. Hydrogen reduction can increase conversion but decrease selectivity due to the formation of acid sites. The structure of the support, such as mesoporous GaAl mixed oxide, can increase the resistance to catalyst coking. Poisoning Brnsted acid sites with K can reduce coke formation. Alumina is the most common support, and various methods have been explored to produce chromia-alumina catalysts. The choice of support can also influence the stability and dispersion of the active phase, which in turn affects the catalytic efficiency and selectivity. For example, zirconia has been investigated as an alternative support due to its low surface acidity and enhanced sintering resistance, which can improve the performance of chromia-based catalysts. The acidity of the support can also play a role in catalytic behavior, as demonstrated by the study of porous chromia-pillared α-zirconium phosphate materials. Support modification strategies, such as doping with alkali metals or using mixed oxides, can optimize these properties for enhanced catalytic efficiency and selectivity. For instance, doping with alkali metals can stabilize the structure of the support, reduce surface acidity, and increase the number of active sites. Using mixed oxides can also improve the thermal stability and coking resistance of the catalysts. The surface area-to-metal loading ratio determines the formation of monomeric, polymeric, or crystalline vanadium species on the catalyst. Hydroxyl groups on the support surface are important for anchoring vanadium precursors, while acid sites are detrimental to catalyst performance. Silica doping of alumina support can improve catalyst stability and activity. Addition of MgO can improve dehydrogenation selectivity by reducing coke formation. The reducibility of vanadium species depends on their molecular structure. Molybdenum oxide can exist as monomers, polymers, or crystallites, depending on loading, support, and preparation conditions. Optimal molybdenum oxide activity is achieved with monolayer coverage on alumina. Hydrogen reduction of molybdenum oxide catalyst increases conversion but decreases selectivity. Ga2O3 polymorphs, particularly β-Ga2O3, have high concentration of weak Lewis acid sites for dehydrogenation activity. Coordinatively unsaturated tetrahedral Ga3+ cations are crucial for dehydrogenation activity. High concentration of Lewis acid groups in the form of Ga3+ cations is necessary for dehydrogenation activity. Zeolitic support with low medium and strong acid sites and high weak acid sites leads to most active and stable GaO3/H-ZSM-5 catalyst. Promotion with a base like potassium decreases activity, indicating acidic groups catalyze the reaction. Mesoporous GaAl mixed oxide has increased resistance to coking. Potassium reduces coke formation by poisoning Brnsted acid sites. Platinum acts as a promoter for GaOx, enhancing conversion and selectivity. Platinum assists hydrogen desorption, facilitating regeneration of gallium hydride hydroxide species. The nature of active sites in Ga-based dehydrogenation catalysts is still under debate. Molybdenum oxide can exist as monomers, polymers, or crystallites, depending on loading, support, and preparation conditions. Hydrogen reduction of catalyst increases conversion but decreases selectivity due to acid site formation. The physicochemical properties of catalysts, including chemical qualities and morphological characteristics, significantly influence their performance in dehydrogenation reactions. Alumina is the most common support, and its interaction with the active phase can profoundly impact catalyst activity and selectivity. Noble metals, particularly platinum, are preferred for their superior activation of paraffinic CH bonds and low activity for CC cleavage. The addition of alkaline metals like lithium, sodium, and potassium can poison acid sites on the support, suppressing coke formation. Zirconia is an alternative support that has been investigated, offering low surface acidity and enhanced sintering resistance. Silica requires a high surface area to stabilize Cr6+ sites. Mixed oxides prepared using layered double hydroxide precursors have also been studied for nonoxidative dehydrogenation reactions. The acidity of the support material, such as in chromia-pillared α-zirconium phosphate, can significantly affect catalytic behavior. The physicochemical properties of catalysts, including chemical qualities and morphological characteristics, significantly influence their performance in dehydrogenation reactions. The surface area-to-metal loading ratio determines the formation of different vanadium species, which affects the catalytic activity. The presence of hydroxyl groups on the support surface is crucial for anchoring vanadium precursors, while large V2O5 crystallites are inactive in dehydrogenation. The reducibility of vanadium species depends on their molecular structure, and the reduction of the catalyst by the hydrocarbon feed results in the formation of V4+ and V3+. Initially, deactivation is caused by the strong adsorption of reactants on the active sites and coke deposition. The calcination of the catalyst can remove coke but may further deactivate the catalyst due to the formation of larger V2O5 crystallites or mixed oxides. V2O5 crystallites can revert to active polymeric vanadium species under certain conditions. The addition of CO2 can have a beneficial effect on the catalyst by removing acid sites, facilitating coke gasification, and promoting hydrogen removal. The effect of CO2 depends on the catalyst support, with relatively weak basic sites on activated carbon support facilitating the reverse water gas shift reaction, while strong basic sites on Al2O3 and ZnO2 can be poisoned by CO2. Using silica to dope the alumina support can improve catalyst stability and activity. The addition of MgO can improve the performance of supported vanadium catalysts by reducing coke formation. The physicochemical properties of catalysts, including chemical qualities and morphological characteristics, significantly influence their performance in dehydrogenation reactions. The nature of the support is crucial as it not only determines the mechanical properties of the catalyst but also affects the interaction between the carrier and the active phase, which can profoundly impact catalyst activity and selectivity. For instance, alumina is the most common support, and the method of producing chromia-alumina catalysts can vary, affecting the catalyst's performance. The choice of support can also influence the catalytic activity, with different supports leading to varying orders of activity based on conversion and yield. Zirconia, as an alternative support, has been investigated for its low surface acidity and enhanced sintering resistance. Silica requires a high surface area to stabilize Cr6+ sites, and mixed oxides prepared using layered double hydroxide precursors have been studied for their catalytic properties in dehydrogenation reactions. The acidity of the support, as seen in chromia-pillared α-zirconium phosphate materials, can also influence catalytic behavior, with strong acid sites affecting cracking reactions and medium strength acid sites impacting dehydrogenation reactions. Support modification strategies can be employed to optimize the properties of catalysts for enhanced catalytic efficiency and selectivity. For example, doping alumina-based dehydrogenation catalysts with alkali ions can effectively poison undesirable acid sites, improving selectivity. Using zirconia as a support can prevent the formation of mixed oxides and offer higher thermal stability and surface area. Silica, with its high surface area, can stabilize Cr6+ sites, while mixed oxides prepared using layered double hydroxide precursors can provide improved coking resistance and thermal stability against sintering. Understanding the role of acidity in catalytic behavior can also guide the modification of supports to favor dehydrogenation reactions over cracking reactions. The physicochemical properties of catalysts, including chemical qualities and morphological characteristics, significantly influence their performance in dehydrogenation reactions. For instance, the nature of the support material, such as alumina, zirconia, or silica, can affect the dispersion and stability of the active phase, thereby impacting the catalytic activity and selectivity. The interaction between the support and the active phase can also alter the electronic properties of the catalyst, which can further enhance its performance. Support modification strategies, such as doping with alkali metals or using mixed oxides, can optimize these properties for enhanced catalytic efficiency and selectivity. For example, doping with alkali metals can reduce surface acidity and increase the number of active sites, while using mixed oxides can improve thermal stability and coking resistance.

The physicochemical properties of catalysts, including chemical qualities such as acid strength and stability, and morphological characteristics, significantly influence their performance in dehydrogenation reactions. The stability and tolerance to carbon deposits of Zr-Al-Beta promoted by alkali-metal ions were demonstrated. The modification of alkali-metal ions on both Lewis acid sites and Brnsted acid sites in Zr-Al-Beta was evidenced by XPS and FT-IR spectroscopy. The untreated materials displayed poor product selectivity and high coke deposit in the Meerwein-Ponndorf-Verley reduction of furfural and isopropanol; however, the treatment of alkali-metal ions promoted their catalytic performance with improved recalcitrance to deactivation and coking significantly. The type of alkali-metal ions and the concentration of alkaline solution influenced the catalytic performance, which were found to correlate to the acidity and textual properties. The optimum reaction result (97.3% yield of furfuryl alcohol at 99.6% conversion of furfural) can be obtained on 0.025 M-Na+-Zr-Al-Beta with high tolerance to the furfural concentration. Support modification strategies can be employed to optimize these properties for enhanced catalytic efficiency and selectivity by tuning and normalizing the various acidic sites of zeolites. For instance, the post-synthetic method is demonstrated to be preferential to form open sites, which have stronger Lewis acidic properties than the closed sites. The simple post-synthetic strategy to prepare a Zr-Al-Beta zeolite with both plentiful Lewis acid open Zr (IV) sites and Brnsted acid sites has shown a superior catalytic activity, water-tolerance ability, and reusability in the cascade conversion of cinnamaldehyde toward 1-cinnamyl 2-propyl ether. The controllable tuning for the acid properties with various active sites is greatly required to promote some of the chemical transformations and avoid the possibility of other undesired reaction pathways except for the aimed reaction route, such as dehydration, polymerization, and isomerization.

The physicochemical properties of catalysts, including chemical qualities and morphological characteristics, significantly impact their performance in dehydrogenation reactions. Chemical qualities, such as acid strength and stability, affect the selectivity toward the targeted alkene, while morphological and porous qualities influence the diffusion efficiency. Support modification strategies, summarized in Table 3, can optimize these properties for enhanced catalytic efficiency and selectivity. Proper acidity of the support is crucial for CH activation and propylene desorption in PDH reactions, while excessive acidity can lead to negative impacts such as CC cracking and deep dehydrogenation. For zeolites, Lewis acid sites are preferred for propane dehydrogenation, whereas Brnsted acid sites catalyze cleavage reactions. The diffusion efficiency of reactants and products in heterogeneous catalysts is determined by the morphology, structure, size, and chemical properties of the supports. Strategies to enhance catalytic efficiency include developing nanosized supports and synthesizing supports with specific morphologies and high external surfaces.

The physicochemical properties of catalysts, including chemical qualities and morphological characteristics, significantly influence their performance in dehydrogenation reactions. The decrease of acid centers of Al2O3 and the increase of the degree of alloy formation upon addition of Ca lead to enhanced propylene selectivity and catalyst stability. The deactivation model with residual activity (DMRA) was used to fit the experimental data of propane conversion vs. time, which allowed for the calculation of the intrinsic deactivation kinetic parameters for both catalysts. The Ca-promoted catalyst showed a lower deactivation function and higher residual activity, indicating better resistance against deactivation by coke. The activation energy of the PDH reaction for the Ca-promoted catalyst was slightly higher due to the enhanced reduction of the GeOx species, which enhanced the formation of a Pt-Ge alloy, decreasing the initial activity of the catalyst. However, this also led to better performance in terms of both activity and selectivity at steady state conditions. Support modification strategies, such as the addition of Ca, can optimize these properties for enhanced catalytic efficiency and selectivity.

The physicochemical properties of catalysts, including chemical qualities such as acid strength and stability, play a crucial role in their performance in dehydrogenation reactions. The Lewis acid site, arising from the unsaturated AlIII site in the Al2O3 structure, is the active site for the catalytic cycle. The amount of Lewis acid sites in Al2O3 is positively linked to the propane conversion rate, indicating their importance in propane dehydrogenation. Morphological characteristics, such as the crystalline structure, also influence catalytic performance. γ-Al2O3 possesses more Lewis acid sites than θ-Al2O3, which contributes to its higher activity. The regenerability of the γ-Al2O3-200 catalyst, which can be restored after deactivation, is an important property for practical applications. Support modification strategies, such as controlling the crystalline structure and increasing the number of Lewis acid sites, can be employed to optimize these properties for enhanced catalytic efficiency and selectivity.

The γ-Al2O3-200 catalyst, with a high level of strong acid sites, shows the highest yield in propane dehydrogenation. The formation of Lewis acid sites in Al2O3 is mainly due to the defective AIII site in the structure. The propane conversion rate is positively linked to the amount of Lewis acid sites in Al2O3, indicating that the Lewis acid sites are the active sites for propane dehydrogenation.

The physicochemical properties of catalysts, including chemical qualities and morphological characteristics, significantly influence their performance in dehydrogenation reactions. The use of a diammonium-type bromide surfactant and a sodium-free silica source in the synthesis procedure leads to the formation of silanol nests in the zeolite, which are confirmed by IR and NMR spectroscopies. These silanol nests play a critical role in the formation of intermetallic alloy nanoparticles, such as Pt3Y, which exhibit high catalytic durability, high propane conversion, and propylene selectivity in propane dehydrogenation. The alloy nanoparticles show fully reversible hydrogen chemisorption behavior at room temperature, unlike monometallic Pt nanoparticles. The nanoparticles are homogeneously distributed throughout the support material, with a size of approximately 2 nm. The EDS analysis confirms that these metal nanoparticles contain both Pt and Y in the same particle, with an average atomic ratio of Pt to Y of approximately 3. The PtY(0.5)/MZ-sf-Br and PtY(0.5)/MZ-sf-OH catalysts show superior catalytic durability compared to PtY(0.5)/MZ-dg. The catalysts supported on silanol nest-containing zeolites have an activation period to reach full conversion. The propane conversion is higher than the equilibrium value during the early reaction period. The TGA profile for the spent PtY(0.5)/MZ-sf-Br catalyst shows that 37 wt% of coke species are deposited on the catalyst sample. The PtY(0.5)/MZ-sf-Br catalyst exhibits slow deactivation over 20 days, while PtY(0.5)/MZ-sf-Br-NaCl is deactivated within 1 day, similar to Pt(0.5)/MZ-sc. Support modification strategies, such as the use of a diammonium-type bromide surfactant and a sodium-free silica source, can optimize the properties of zeolite supports for enhanced catalytic efficiency and selectivity in dehydrogenation reactions.

The physicochemical properties of catalysts, including chemical qualities and morphological characteristics, significantly influence their performance in dehydrogenation reactions. Catalysts synthesized by wet impregnation method, such as CrOx supported on high-silica HZSM-5 with a SiO2/Al2O3 ratio of 260, exhibit high catalytic activity, good selectivity, and excellent stability for PDH. The exploitation of an efficient PDH catalyst based on HZSM-5 zeolite to achieve both high selectivity and stability is still a challenge. In zeolite supported catalysts, zeolite provides a special environment for catalytic reactions, including channel confinement effects, acidic sites, and electron transfer. Acidic sites in zeolites play a key role in determining the catalytic performance of zeolite catalysts in alkane conversion. The role of Cr species and Brnsted acid sites in Cr/HZSM-5 catalysts is elucidated through physicochemical characterizations, PDH tests, and Na+ doping experiments. The structural properties of the prepared CrOx catalysts are detected by N2 sorption technique. The XRD patterns of parent HZSM-5(260) and Cr/Z-5(260) samples are similar, indicating that the Cr loading has little influence on the crystallite structure of HZSM-5 zeolite. The acidity properties of the prepared Cr/Z-5, Cr/SiO2, and Cr/Al2O3 catalysts are detected by NH3-TPD technique. The metal-support interactions between Cr species and HZSM-5 support are measured by XPS spectroscopy. During the PDH tests, the high reaction temperature results in coke formation onto the catalyst, which is the main cause of catalyst deactivation. The interactions between react/product molecules and catalysts are very important in dehydrogenation process. The effect of Cr loading amount and SiO2/Al2O3 ratio on the catalytic performance of Cr/HZSM-5 catalysts is investigated in detail. The role of Cr species and Brnsted acid sites in Cr/HZSM-5 catalysts is elucidated through physicochemical characterizations, PDH tests, and Na+ doping experiments. Characterization results and Na+ doping experiments reveal that the Cr species combined with Brnsted acid sites in Cr/HZSM-5 catalysts are responsible for the high catalytic performance. The Brnsted acid sites in HZSM-5 zeolite increase propane adsorption and enhance CH bond activation. The high surface area and well-defined pores of HZSM-5 zeolite provide a special environment for the dispersion and stabilization of Cr species, ensuring high catalytic activity and stability. The selection of supports for Cr-based catalysts is crucial for PDH. Zeolites, with their high surface area, well-defined channels, good thermal stability, and tunable acidity, can serve as catalysts or supports for various catalytic reactions. The high amounts of acidic sites of HZSM-5 zeolites are negative for PDH reaction, and only HZSM-5 zeolite with suitable acidic sites can be used as a good support for CrOx catalysts for PDH process. The Brnsted acid sites play an important role in determining the catalytic performance of Cr/Z-5 catalyst system. The Brnsted acid sites in HZSM-5(260) play a key role in propane adsorption and activation, affecting their catalytic performance.

The physicochemical properties of catalysts, including chemical qualities and morphological characteristics, significantly influence their performance in dehydrogenation reactions. The crystallization temperature of the support directly affects the catalytic performance of VOx/Al2O3 catalysts by increasing Lewis acid sites and influencing the distribution of different surface V species. P modification can decrease the degree of VOx polymerization, enhancing catalyst stability and activity. Mg modification can improve catalytic performance and anti-coking capability by dispersing V2O5 crystallites and increasing active V3+ species. Gelation and calcination temperatures also impact the catalytic performance of VOx/SiO2 catalysts in terms of propane conversion, propene selectivity, and yield of propene. Dealuminated beta zeolites (Si-beta) are promising catalyst supports due to their high surface area and thermal stability, and the initial propane conversion linearly increases with the amount of acid sites. VOx/ZrO2 is more active than VOx/Al2O3 and pure ZrO2 due to the facile reduction of VO, VOV, and VOZr bonds, producing higher proportions of the active V3+ species. The balance of acid and base sites on the catalyst surface is crucial for all dehydrogenation methods. The development of an active, selective, and stable catalyst is essential for dehydrogenation to be considered a viable process in the future. Support modification strategies can optimize these properties for enhanced catalytic efficiency and selectivity. Using supports with ordered mesoporosity and moderate surface acidity can aid mass transfer and avoid undesirable secondary reactions. Promoting elements can cause beneficial geometric and electronic effects on both the supports and active species. However, environmental and safety concerns exist in the preparation, usage, and disposal of certain catalysts due to their toxicity. Ga catalysts, while less active than Pt and Cr catalysts, have the advantage of being benign and inexpensive. The nature of the support is essential for vanadium-based catalysts, as the metalsupport interactions affect the resultant catalyst performance. The activity is dependent on the bond strength of the VOsupport bond, and catalyst performance is affected by different supports.

The physicochemical properties of catalysts, including chemical qualities (such as acid strength and stability) and morphological characteristics, significantly influence their performance in dehydrogenation reactions. The equilibrium conversion of alkanes increases with temperature, but alkene selectivity decreases due to an increased tendency toward dehydrocyclization/aromatisation, thermal cracking, and coke formation. The extent of PtSn interactions depends on the impregnation sequence of Pt and Sn precursors on the support material. The framework of microporous zeolites exerts dispersive forces on reactant molecules, which depend on the shape, channel, and cavity of the framework. The nature and density of active sites also influence the framework dispersion forces. Recent reports have shown that the strong electrostatic field between protons or exchanged metal ions and basic oxygen species can enhance and/or induce polarization of bonds in hydrocarbon adsorbates. This polarization effect can be viewed as an intermediate condition to hydride abstraction, an important elementary step in CH activation. The polarizing effect increases with increasing charge magnitude and ionic radius of the alkane polarizing cations. The choice of cations should be such that they exhibit no catalytic effects on the target alkene products at the reaction condition. It may be beneficial to create a CH polarization effect on the zeolite framework by appropriate modification of framework atoms. Active sites are usually created on the zeolite frameworks. The active sites of the bimolecular pathway are formed in situ and are made up of an alkyl carbenium ion ionically held to the zeolite framework oxygen ion. The active sites of the unimolecular pathway are the charge balancing protons of the zeolite framework. A proton and a carbenium ion are electrophilic or Lewis acid species, and the two pathways essentially involve electrophilic CH activation. The exchanged metal ions in zeolites are held ionically by one or more basic oxygen atoms. Different species have been suggested, depending on the density of the cation exchange site of the zeolite and the method of introduction of the metals. High alkene selectivities are obtained on the H-ZSM-5 when exchangeable protons are rigorously replaced by Zn and Ga. The CH activation on the OZn2+O site can be described by a Lewis base-assisted deprotonation mechanism, accompanied by conversion of the Lewis base site to a conjugate Bronsted acid site. The OGa+ site, however, activates the CH bond via oxidative addition without a protonic site intermediate. A protonic site intermediate increases the tendency of side reactions on the Zn-exchanged H-ZSM-5 relative to the Ga counterpart. The elementary steps of CH activation on OGa+ reveal that a redox cycle at the metal center is required for catalytic CH activation via the oxidative addition mechanism. However, under alkane dehydrogenation reaction conditions, the OZn2+O sites can undergo a reversible Zn2+/Zn redox process, increasing the availability of undesired protonic site intermediates. Zn-exchanged H-ZSM-5 prepared by conventional ion-exchange methods contain a significant percentage of unexchanged proton sites, leading to lower alkene selectivity of the catalyst. Another strategy to enhance alkene selectivity is by controlling the strength of the proton sites. The acidity of the sites depends on the nature of the trivalent cation of the zeolite framework. Proton sites in borosilicate zeolites are weaker than those of aluminosilicate, and thus higher alkene selectivity is expected for alkane dehydrogenation over Zn/H[B]-ZSM-5 compared to Zn/H[Al]-ZSM-5. However, Zn/H[B]-ZSM-5 shows no activity for propane dehydrogenation. The desired weaker acidity of the proton sites of Zn/H[B]-ZSM-5 requires weaker basicity of the oxygen atoms in the zeolite framework. This reduced basicity of the oxygen atoms is not sufficiently polarizing to complement the exchanged Zn2+ in CH bond cleavage. Elimination of the proton sites of zeolites is critical for obtaining a high alkene selectivity and stability in dehydrogenation catalysts. Pt is the most versatile noble metal catalyst for alkane reactions, often justified by its higher activity, stability, and selectivity for these reactions compared to less expensive alternative transition metals. However, rapid catalyst deactivation due to coke formation remains a challenge even when using a Pt-based catalyst for dehydrogenation of light alkanes. The presence of acid (Bronsted and Lewis) sites on the supports promotes readsorption, oligomerization, and aromatization of alkenes. Promotion of Pt with metals, such as Sn, Ga, Zn, Re, etc., improves catalyst stability, but also leads to faster deactivation rates than Pt/Na[Fe]-ZSM-5. The role of potassium in commercial Cr and Pt-based dehydrogenation catalysts is to minimize the undesired influence of protonic sites on alkene selectivity. The nature and role of surface oxygen species become more evident. The electronic promotion effect of Sn is in line with the oxidative addition CH activation mechanism. However, the Lewis base-assisted deprotonation mechanism could also explain the proposed CH activation on Cr-based catalysts. A recent report suggests that a porous copper-aluminum framework material (stabilized by metal oxide) has better performance (activity/selectivity/stability) for propane dehydrogenation than a PtSn/Al2O3. The Lewis base-assisted deprotonation mechanism may be invoked here, and the redox property of the metal center is likely to play a role in achieving propane dehydrogenation at 350 C. This should constitute the future research direction for non-oxidative dehydrogenation of lower alkanes.

The physicochemical properties of catalysts, including chemical qualities (such as acid strength and stability) and morphological characteristics, significantly influence their performance in dehydrogenation reactions. For instance, the stability of metal oxides or hydride clusters is influenced by the structure of the zeolite framework, and the pore size of zeolites has a slight effect on the catalytic activity, with lower activation barriers for reactions in zeolites with larger pore size. The optimal distance between active sites, such as AlAl distance in zeolites, can be determined to achieve a minimum overall barrier, based on the Sabatier principle. The ultimate goal of theoretical studies is to identify optimal catalysts for specific chemical processes, and the advancements in computational approaches have enabled the exploration of more complex catalytic systems beyond simple transition-metal surfaces. Case studies have provided insights into dehydrogenation mechanisms in these systems, revealing information that is challenging to obtain at the molecular level even with advanced experimental equipment.

The physicochemical properties of catalysts, including chemical qualities and morphological characteristics, significantly influence their performance in dehydrogenation reactions. The geometric and electronic effects are crucial to catalytic systems, particularly in propane dehydrogenation (PDH). The double decoration of PtGa intermetallics with Pb and Ca is a promising catalyst design concept that synergizes the geometric and electronic promotion effects, leading to an ultra-stable catalytic system for PDH. Pb is used for geometric modification to block Pt3 sites, while Ca acts as an electron-donating agent to enrich the electron density of Pt1 sites, suppressing side reactions. This strategy results in a catalyst with outstanding stability in PDH for up to 1 month at 600C.

The literature does not provide specific information on how physicochemical properties of catalysts influence their performance in dehydrogenation reactions or on support modification strategies to optimize these properties. However, it does discuss the influence of support acidity on the electronic properties of supported metals, and how the presence of metals affects the acidic properties of supports. The study shows that the electronic properties of Pt are influenced by the acidity of the support, and the alteration of Pt properties increases with increasing acidity of the support. At the same time, the presence of platinum affects the acidic properties of the supports by reducing the strength of the acid sites. This is observed directly as the changes in desorption of pyridine from the acid sites and indirectly as the suppression of cracking reactions during the ring opening of decalin on the Pt-modified catalysts. This could potentially impact the catalytic efficiency and selectivity in reactions that require both metal and acid active sites.

The physicochemical properties of catalysts, including chemical qualities and morphological characteristics, significantly influence their performance in dehydrogenation reactions. Al2O3, due to its structural advantages and stability, is commonly used as a support in heterogeneous catalysis. The coordinately unsaturated Al3+ sites on the (100) facets of commercial γ-Al2O3 can serve as anchor sites for atomically dispersed Pt and Ru sites. The specific interaction between Ga2O3 and Al2O3 allows the tetrahedral Ga3+ cations to disperse in the spinel-type γ-Ga2O3-Al2O3 solid solution, enhancing activity and stability in PDH reactions. The γ-Al2O3 nanosheet, containing 27% penta-coordinated Al3+ sites, can disperse and stabilize bimetallic PtSn nanoclusters due to strong interactions between metals and support, leading to excellent performance in long-term PDH reactions at ultrahigh space velocities. Hydroxyl groups-eliminated Al2O3 shows high activity of coordinately unsaturated Al3+ as surface active sites in non-oxidative dehydrogenation of isobutane to isobutylene. The diversity and complexity of Al2O3 structure, such as surface acidity at low-coordinated Al sites, determine different properties in propane adsorption, activation, and coke deposition in PDH reactions. A one-step hydrothermal method synthesizes sheet-shaped CoAl2O3HT catalysts for efficient PDH catalysis, benchmarking structural and catalytic stabilities and CoAl2O3 interactions against an impregnated Co/Al2O3-IMP catalyst. The effect of C3H6 desorption behavior in Co-catalyzed PDH reactions is further illustrated. Support modification strategies, such as the use of γ-Al2O3 nanosheets and the specific interaction between Ga2O3 and Al2O3, can optimize these properties for enhanced catalytic efficiency and selectivity.

The acidity of the catalysts was evaluated by NH3-TPD, revealing that parent H-Beta has both weak and strong acid sites, while Si-Beta lacks acid sites after dealumination. The introduction of Pt species results in trace medium acid sites, and Zn species introduce higher amounts of Lewis acid sites. The presence of Pt in 2Zn/Si-Beta leads to an ammonia desorption peak with much higher intensity, indicating strong interaction between Pt and Zn species. Electron microscopy shows that 0.1Pt-2Zn/Si-Beta appears as small aggregates below 100 nm, with Pt and Zn species having close contact on the Si-Beta support. Infrared spectroscopy monitored the evolution of silanol groups after dealumination and metal incorporation, revealing the formation of Pt-Zn species on Si-Beta zeolite. The local electronic environment of Pt is significant for the PDH process and was investigated by FTIR spectra of CO adsorption. XRD patterns show typical diffraction lines for the BEA topology, with a decline in intensity after Zn introduction. Surface areas of zeolite samples were determined by argon adsorption/desorption isotherms, revealing high surface areas and large micropore volumes for all samples, indicating well-preserved microporous structures after dealumination and metal incorporation. The introduction of Pt species via impregnation does not change the dispersion of Zn species on Si-Beta support. The close contact between Pt-Zn species and the electronic interaction thereof make Pt-Zn/Si-Beta robust PDH catalysts.

The physicochemical properties of catalysts, including chemical qualities and morphological characteristics, significantly influence their performance in dehydrogenation reactions. The addition of excess NaCl contributes to the stability of propane dehydrogenation MFI-zeolite catalysts. NaCl promotes the dispersion of Pt, prevents sintering during calcination, and effectively suppresses zeolite acidity. Washing the catalysts after calcination further increases their activity and stability due to the redispersion of water-soluble chlorinated Pt compounds. High external surface acid site concentrations, specific Na/Pt atomic ratios, calcination temperatures, washing with water, and the order of component introduction all contribute to improved Pt dispersion and catalyst stability.

The stability of Pt particles on the surface of supports can be significantly improved by manipulating metal-support interactions. Al2O3 with coordinatively unsaturated pentacoordinate Al3+ sites can stabilize atomically dispersed Pt species by forming Al3+ penta-O-Pt bonds, anchoring Pt particles on the Al2O3 surface. Pt particles can also be tightly stabilized on heteroatoms in the oxide substrate lattice. Small Pt particles stabilized in lattice-confined Sn (IV/II) produce a highly selective and stable Pt-Sn catalyst for propane dehydrogenation. Pt particles confined at the Sn single-site in the zeolite framework exhibit high catalytic performance in propane dehydrogenation, mainly due to the strong interaction between Pt particles and the Sn-zeolite framework. The PtSn bimetallic particles confined in the mesopores of hierarchical ZSM-5 zeolite allow them to become a stable catalyst in propane dehydrogenation at high temperatures. The high efficiency of PtSn/hierarchical ZSM-5 catalysts in propane dehydrogenation is mainly attributed to the confinement of PtSn particles in the mesopores of hierarchical ZSM-5 zeolite.

The physicochemical properties of catalysts, including chemical qualities and morphological characteristics, significantly influence their performance in dehydrogenation reactions. For instance, the coordination saturation of Pt atoms affects the selectivity of propane dehydrogenation, while the unsaturated Pt atoms can catalyze side reactions, leading to carbon deposition. The adsorption configuration and strength of propylene are closely related to the surface structures, which governs the formation of coke. The acidity and coke mobility of the support also play a role in inhibiting coke formation. Various strategies have been proposed to inhibit coke formation, such as geometric separation, electron richness, poisoning acid sites, cofeeding streams, enhancing oxygen mobility, and coke transfer. The textural properties of supports, such as specific surface area, acid-base properties, and thermal stability, have significant influences on the catalytic performance of Pt-based catalysts. To prevent the occurrence of undesirable coke and alkane isomerization on supports, the support acidity should be carefully controlled. Supports with high surface area and uniform pore size distribution are preferred to increase the dispersion of metal particles. Alkaline metals, such as Li, Na, and K, can help poison the strong acid sites and avoid the coke deposition on the Al2O3 surface. Doping Mg into Al2O3 forms a stable spinel phase. Al2O3 nanosheets with abundant penta-coordinate Al atoms have a strong metal-support interaction owing to their capacity for anchoring Pt atoms, which accounts for their high stability. Due to the weak interaction between Pt and SiO2, Pt-based bimetals with high alloying degrees such as PtM intermetallic alloys can be formed by direct H2 pretreatment on SiO2 supports. Comparatively, there exist strong interactions between CeO2 and metal particles, where Pt atoms can be trapped in the form of Pt ions. Additionally, upon using water vapor, the coke deposition could be eliminated accounting for the redox properties of CeO2 under propane dehydrogenation. The adjustable Si/Al ratios and relatively large surface areas can hinder the formation of large hydrocarbon molecules, thus preventing the so-called coke deposits and improving the catalytic stability. Besides, some mesoporous materials, such as SBA-1561 and MCM-41, are often used as the catalyst supports to disperse the active phase with more active sites and less coke deposition. Two-dimensional (2D) early transition metal carbides, i.e., MXenes, due to their well-defined structures and tunable compositions have attracted much attention. Additionally, carbon materials have been widely used for plenty of reactions because of their large surface area, chemical inertness and stability in acidic/basic media. Novel nanostructured carbon materials including carbon nanotubes and graphene as supports have been gradually developed. Obviously, each specific support has its own characteristic and may exhibit a distinctive effect on the catalytic property. It can not only change the selectivity by influencing the component, morphology and distribution of metal particles but also alter the reaction stability by increasing mechanical strength, anti-sintering and anti-coking resistance.

The physicochemical properties of catalysts, including chemical qualities and morphological characteristics, have a significant impact on their performance in dehydrogenation reactions. For example, the surface area-to-metal loading ratio determines the formation of different vanadium species, which affects the catalytic activity. The reducibility of vanadium species also influences the catalytic performance. The addition of MgO can improve the selectivity of vanadium-based catalysts by reducing coke formation. Using silica to dope alumina support can enhance the stability and activity of vanadium oxide catalysts. The type of support and preparation conditions can affect the formation of molybdenum oxide species. Hydrogen reduction can increase conversion but decrease selectivity due to the formation of acid sites. The structure of the support, such as mesoporous GaAl mixed oxide, can increase the resistance to catalyst coking. Poisoning Brnsted acid sites with K can reduce coke formation. Alumina is the most common support, and various methods have been explored to produce chromia-alumina catalysts. The choice of support can also influence the stability and dispersion of the active phase, which in turn affects the catalytic efficiency and selectivity. For example, zirconia has been investigated as an alternative support due to its low surface acidity and enhanced sintering resistance, which can improve the performance of chromia-based catalysts. The acidity of the support can also play a role in catalytic behavior, as demonstrated by the study of porous chromia-pillared α-zirconium phosphate materials. Support modification strategies, such as doping with alkali metals or using mixed oxides, can optimize these properties for enhanced catalytic efficiency and selectivity. For instance, doping with alkali metals can stabilize the structure of the support, reduce surface acidity, and increase the number of active sites. Using mixed oxides can also improve the thermal stability and coking resistance of the catalysts. The surface area-to-metal loading ratio determines the formation of monomeric, polymeric, or crystalline vanadium species on the catalyst. Hydroxyl groups on the support surface are important for anchoring vanadium precursors, while acid sites are detrimental to catalyst performance. Silica doping of alumina support can improve catalyst stability and activity. Addition of MgO can improve dehydrogenation selectivity by reducing coke formation. The reducibility of vanadium species depends on their molecular structure. Molybdenum oxide can exist as monomers, polymers, or crystallites, depending on loading, support, and preparation conditions. Optimal molybdenum oxide activity is achieved with monolayer coverage on alumina. Hydrogen reduction of molybdenum oxide catalyst increases conversion but decreases selectivity. Ga2O3 polymorphs, particularly β-Ga2O3, have high concentration of weak Lewis acid sites for dehydrogenation activity. Coordinatively unsaturated tetrahedral Ga3+ cations are crucial for dehydrogenation activity. High concentration of Lewis acid groups in the form of Ga3+ cations is necessary for dehydrogenation activity. Zeolitic support with low medium and strong acid sites and high weak acid sites leads to most active and stable GaO3/H-ZSM-5 catalyst. Promotion with a base like potassium decreases activity, indicating acidic groups catalyze the reaction. Mesoporous GaAl mixed oxide has increased resistance to coking. Potassium reduces coke formation by poisoning Brnsted acid sites. Platinum acts as a promoter for GaOx, enhancing conversion and selectivity. Platinum assists hydrogen desorption, facilitating regeneration of gallium hydride hydroxide species. The nature of active sites in Ga-based dehydrogenation catalysts is still under debate. Molybdenum oxide can exist as monomers, polymers, or crystallites, depending on loading, support, and preparation conditions. Hydrogen reduction of catalyst increases conversion but decreases selectivity due to acid site formation. The physicochemical properties of catalysts, including chemical qualities and morphological characteristics, significantly influence their performance in dehydrogenation reactions. Alumina is the most common support, and its interaction with the active phase can profoundly impact catalyst activity and selectivity. Noble metals, particularly platinum, are preferred for their superior activation of paraffinic CH bonds and low activity for CC cleavage. The addition of alkaline metals like lithium, sodium, and potassium can poison acid sites on the support, suppressing coke formation. Zirconia is an alternative support that has been investigated, offering low surface acidity and enhanced sintering resistance. Silica requires a high surface area to stabilize Cr6+ sites. Mixed oxides prepared using layered double hydroxide precursors have also been studied for nonoxidative dehydrogenation reactions. The acidity of the support material, such as in chromia-pillared α-zirconium phosphate, can significantly affect catalytic behavior. The physicochemical properties of catalysts, including chemical qualities and morphological characteristics, significantly influence their performance in dehydrogenation reactions. The surface area-to-metal loading ratio determines the formation of different vanadium species, which affects the catalytic activity. The presence of hydroxyl groups on the support surface is crucial for anchoring vanadium precursors, while large V2O5 crystallites are inactive in dehydrogenation. The reducibility of vanadium species depends on their molecular structure, and the reduction of the catalyst by the hydrocarbon feed results in the formation of V4+ and V3+. Initially, deactivation is caused by the strong adsorption of reactants on the active sites and coke deposition. The calcination of the catalyst can remove coke but may further deactivate the catalyst due to the formation of larger V2O5 crystallites or mixed oxides. V2O5 crystallites can revert to active polymeric vanadium species under certain conditions. The addition of CO2 can have a beneficial effect on the catalyst by removing acid sites, facilitating coke gasification, and promoting hydrogen removal. The effect of CO2 depends on the catalyst support, with relatively weak basic sites on activated carbon support facilitating the reverse water gas shift reaction, while strong basic sites on Al2O3 and ZnO2 can be poisoned by CO2. Using silica to dope the alumina support can improve catalyst stability and activity. The addition of MgO can improve the performance of supported vanadium catalysts by reducing coke formation. The physicochemical properties of catalysts, including chemical qualities and morphological characteristics, significantly influence their performance in dehydrogenation reactions. The nature of the support is crucial as it not only determines the mechanical properties of the catalyst but also affects the interaction between the carrier and the active phase, which can profoundly impact catalyst activity and selectivity. For instance, alumina is the most common support, and the method of producing chromia-alumina catalysts can vary, affecting the catalyst's performance. The choice of support can also influence the catalytic activity, with different supports leading to varying orders of activity based on conversion and yield. Zirconia, as an alternative support, has been investigated for its low surface acidity and enhanced sintering resistance. Silica requires a high surface area to stabilize Cr6+ sites, and mixed oxides prepared using layered double hydroxide precursors have been studied for their catalytic properties in dehydrogenation reactions. The acidity of the support, as seen in chromia-pillared α-zirconium phosphate materials, can also influence catalytic behavior, with strong acid sites affecting cracking reactions and medium strength acid sites impacting dehydrogenation reactions. Support modification strategies can be employed to optimize the properties of catalysts for enhanced catalytic efficiency and selectivity. For example, doping alumina-based dehydrogenation catalysts with alkali ions can effectively poison undesirable acid sites, improving selectivity. Using zirconia as a support can prevent the formation of mixed oxides and offer higher thermal stability and surface area. Silica, with its high surface area, can stabilize Cr6+ sites, while mixed oxides prepared using layered double hydroxide precursors can provide improved coking resistance and thermal stability against sintering. Understanding the role of acidity in catalytic behavior can also guide the modification of supports to favor dehydrogenation reactions over cracking reactions. The physicochemical properties of catalysts, including chemical qualities and morphological characteristics, significantly influence their performance in dehydrogenation reactions. For instance, the nature of the support material, such as alumina, zirconia, or silica, can affect the dispersion and stability of the active phase, thereby impacting the catalytic activity and selectivity. The interaction between the support and the active phase can also alter the electronic properties of the catalyst, which can further enhance its performance. Support modification strategies, such as doping with alkali metals or using mixed oxides, can optimize these properties for enhanced catalytic efficiency and selectivity. For example, doping with alkali metals can reduce surface acidity and increase the number of active sites, while using mixed oxides can improve thermal stability and coking resistance.

The physicochemical properties of catalysts, including chemical qualities such as acid strength and stability, and morphological characteristics, significantly influence their performance in dehydrogenation reactions. The stability and tolerance to carbon deposits of Zr-Al-Beta promoted by alkali-metal ions were demonstrated. The modification of alkali-metal ions on both Lewis acid sites and Brnsted acid sites in Zr-Al-Beta was evidenced by XPS and FT-IR spectroscopy. The untreated materials displayed poor product selectivity and high coke deposit in the Meerwein-Ponndorf-Verley reduction of furfural and isopropanol; however, the treatment of alkali-metal ions promoted their catalytic performance with improved recalcitrance to deactivation and coking significantly. The type of alkali-metal ions and the concentration of alkaline solution influenced the catalytic performance, which were found to correlate to the acidity and textual properties. The optimum reaction result (97.3% yield of furfuryl alcohol at 99.6% conversion of furfural) can be obtained on 0.025 M-Na+-Zr-Al-Beta with high tolerance to the furfural concentration. Support modification strategies can be employed to optimize these properties for enhanced catalytic efficiency and selectivity by tuning and normalizing the various acidic sites of zeolites. For instance, the post-synthetic method is demonstrated to be preferential to form open sites, which have stronger Lewis acidic properties than the closed sites. The simple post-synthetic strategy to prepare a Zr-Al-Beta zeolite with both plentiful Lewis acid open Zr (IV) sites and Brnsted acid sites has shown a superior catalytic activity, water-tolerance ability, and reusability in the cascade conversion of cinnamaldehyde toward 1-cinnamyl 2-propyl ether. The controllable tuning for the acid properties with various active sites is greatly required to promote some of the chemical transformations and avoid the possibility of other undesired reaction pathways except for the aimed reaction route, such as dehydration, polymerization, and isomerization.

The physicochemical properties of catalysts, including chemical qualities and morphological characteristics, significantly impact their performance in dehydrogenation reactions. Chemical qualities, such as acid strength and stability, affect the selectivity toward the targeted alkene, while morphological and porous qualities influence the diffusion efficiency. Support modification strategies, summarized in Table 3, can optimize these properties for enhanced catalytic efficiency and selectivity. Proper acidity of the support is crucial for CH activation and propylene desorption in PDH reactions, while excessive acidity can lead to negative impacts such as CC cracking and deep dehydrogenation. For zeolites, Lewis acid sites are preferred for propane dehydrogenation, whereas Brnsted acid sites catalyze cleavage reactions. The diffusion efficiency of reactants and products in heterogeneous catalysts is determined by the morphology, structure, size, and chemical properties of the supports. Strategies to enhance catalytic efficiency include developing nanosized supports and synthesizing supports with specific morphologies and high external surfaces.

The physicochemical properties of catalysts, including chemical qualities and morphological characteristics, significantly influence their performance in dehydrogenation reactions. The decrease of acid centers of Al2O3 and the increase of the degree of alloy formation upon addition of Ca lead to enhanced propylene selectivity and catalyst stability. The deactivation model with residual activity (DMRA) was used to fit the experimental data of propane conversion vs. time, which allowed for the calculation of the intrinsic deactivation kinetic parameters for both catalysts. The Ca-promoted catalyst showed a lower deactivation function and higher residual activity, indicating better resistance against deactivation by coke. The activation energy of the PDH reaction for the Ca-promoted catalyst was slightly higher due to the enhanced reduction of the GeOx species, which enhanced the formation of a Pt-Ge alloy, decreasing the initial activity of the catalyst. However, this also led to better performance in terms of both activity and selectivity at steady state conditions. Support modification strategies, such as the addition of Ca, can optimize these properties for enhanced catalytic efficiency and selectivity.

The physicochemical properties of catalysts, including chemical qualities such as acid strength and stability, play a crucial role in their performance in dehydrogenation reactions. The Lewis acid site, arising from the unsaturated AlIII site in the Al2O3 structure, is the active site for the catalytic cycle. The amount of Lewis acid sites in Al2O3 is positively linked to the propane conversion rate, indicating their importance in propane dehydrogenation. Morphological characteristics, such as the crystalline structure, also influence catalytic performance. γ-Al2O3 possesses more Lewis acid sites than θ-Al2O3, which contributes to its higher activity. The regenerability of the γ-Al2O3-200 catalyst, which can be restored after deactivation, is an important property for practical applications. Support modification strategies, such as controlling the crystalline structure and increasing the number of Lewis acid sites, can be employed to optimize these properties for enhanced catalytic efficiency and selectivity.

The γ-Al2O3-200 catalyst, with a high level of strong acid sites, shows the highest yield in propane dehydrogenation. The formation of Lewis acid sites in Al2O3 is mainly due to the defective AIII site in the structure. The propane conversion rate is positively linked to the amount of Lewis acid sites in Al2O3, indicating that the Lewis acid sites are the active sites for propane dehydrogenation.

The physicochemical properties of catalysts, including chemical qualities and morphological characteristics, significantly influence their performance in dehydrogenation reactions. The use of a diammonium-type bromide surfactant and a sodium-free silica source in the synthesis procedure leads to the formation of silanol nests in the zeolite, which are confirmed by IR and NMR spectroscopies. These silanol nests play a critical role in the formation of intermetallic alloy nanoparticles, such as Pt3Y, which exhibit high catalytic durability, high propane conversion, and propylene selectivity in propane dehydrogenation. The alloy nanoparticles show fully reversible hydrogen chemisorption behavior at room temperature, unlike monometallic Pt nanoparticles. The nanoparticles are homogeneously distributed throughout the support material, with a size of approximately 2 nm. The EDS analysis confirms that these metal nanoparticles contain both Pt and Y in the same particle, with an average atomic ratio of Pt to Y of approximately 3. The PtY(0.5)/MZ-sf-Br and PtY(0.5)/MZ-sf-OH catalysts show superior catalytic durability compared to PtY(0.5)/MZ-dg. The catalysts supported on silanol nest-containing zeolites have an activation period to reach full conversion. The propane conversion is higher than the equilibrium value during the early reaction period. The TGA profile for the spent PtY(0.5)/MZ-sf-Br catalyst shows that 37 wt% of coke species are deposited on the catalyst sample. The PtY(0.5)/MZ-sf-Br catalyst exhibits slow deactivation over 20 days, while PtY(0.5)/MZ-sf-Br-NaCl is deactivated within 1 day, similar to Pt(0.5)/MZ-sc. Support modification strategies, such as the use of a diammonium-type bromide surfactant and a sodium-free silica source, can optimize the properties of zeolite supports for enhanced catalytic efficiency and selectivity in dehydrogenation reactions.

The physicochemical properties of catalysts, including chemical qualities and morphological characteristics, significantly influence their performance in dehydrogenation reactions. Catalysts synthesized by wet impregnation method, such as CrOx supported on high-silica HZSM-5 with a SiO2/Al2O3 ratio of 260, exhibit high catalytic activity, good selectivity, and excellent stability for PDH. The exploitation of an efficient PDH catalyst based on HZSM-5 zeolite to achieve both high selectivity and stability is still a challenge. In zeolite supported catalysts, zeolite provides a special environment for catalytic reactions, including channel confinement effects, acidic sites, and electron transfer. Acidic sites in zeolites play a key role in determining the catalytic performance of zeolite catalysts in alkane conversion. The role of Cr species and Brnsted acid sites in Cr/HZSM-5 catalysts is elucidated through physicochemical characterizations, PDH tests, and Na+ doping experiments. The structural properties of the prepared CrOx catalysts are detected by N2 sorption technique. The XRD patterns of parent HZSM-5(260) and Cr/Z-5(260) samples are similar, indicating that the Cr loading has little influence on the crystallite structure of HZSM-5 zeolite. The acidity properties of the prepared Cr/Z-5, Cr/SiO2, and Cr/Al2O3 catalysts are detected by NH3-TPD technique. The metal-support interactions between Cr species and HZSM-5 support are measured by XPS spectroscopy. During the PDH tests, the high reaction temperature results in coke formation onto the catalyst, which is the main cause of catalyst deactivation. The interactions between react/product molecules and catalysts are very important in dehydrogenation process. The effect of Cr loading amount and SiO2/Al2O3 ratio on the catalytic performance of Cr/HZSM-5 catalysts is investigated in detail. The role of Cr species and Brnsted acid sites in Cr/HZSM-5 catalysts is elucidated through physicochemical characterizations, PDH tests, and Na+ doping experiments. Characterization results and Na+ doping experiments reveal that the Cr species combined with Brnsted acid sites in Cr/HZSM-5 catalysts are responsible for the high catalytic performance. The Brnsted acid sites in HZSM-5 zeolite increase propane adsorption and enhance CH bond activation. The high surface area and well-defined pores of HZSM-5 zeolite provide a special environment for the dispersion and stabilization of Cr species, ensuring high catalytic activity and stability. The selection of supports for Cr-based catalysts is crucial for PDH. Zeolites, with their high surface area, well-defined channels, good thermal stability, and tunable acidity, can serve as catalysts or supports for various catalytic reactions. The high amounts of acidic sites of HZSM-5 zeolites are negative for PDH reaction, and only HZSM-5 zeolite with suitable acidic sites can be used as a good support for CrOx catalysts for PDH process. The Brnsted acid sites play an important role in determining the catalytic performance of Cr/Z-5 catalyst system. The Brnsted acid sites in HZSM-5(260) play a key role in propane adsorption and activation, affecting their catalytic performance.

The physicochemical properties of catalysts, including chemical qualities and morphological characteristics, significantly influence their performance in dehydrogenation reactions. The crystallization temperature of the support directly affects the catalytic performance of VOx/Al2O3 catalysts by increasing Lewis acid sites and influencing the distribution of different surface V species. P modification can decrease the degree of VOx polymerization, enhancing catalyst stability and activity. Mg modification can improve catalytic performance and anti-coking capability by dispersing V2O5 crystallites and increasing active V3+ species. Gelation and calcination temperatures also impact the catalytic performance of VOx/SiO2 catalysts in terms of propane conversion, propene selectivity, and yield of propene. Dealuminated beta zeolites (Si-beta) are promising catalyst supports due to their high surface area and thermal stability, and the initial propane conversion linearly increases with the amount of acid sites. VOx/ZrO2 is more active than VOx/Al2O3 and pure ZrO2 due to the facile reduction of VO, VOV, and VOZr bonds, producing higher proportions of the active V3+ species. The balance of acid and base sites on the catalyst surface is crucial for all dehydrogenation methods. The development of an active, selective, and stable catalyst is essential for dehydrogenation to be considered a viable process in the future. Support modification strategies can optimize these properties for enhanced catalytic efficiency and selectivity. Using supports with ordered mesoporosity and moderate surface acidity can aid mass transfer and avoid undesirable secondary reactions. Promoting elements can cause beneficial geometric and electronic effects on both the supports and active species. However, environmental and safety concerns exist in the preparation, usage, and disposal of certain catalysts due to their toxicity. Ga catalysts, while less active than Pt and Cr catalysts, have the advantage of being benign and inexpensive. The nature of the support is essential for vanadium-based catalysts, as the metalsupport interactions affect the resultant catalyst performance. The activity is dependent on the bond strength of the VOsupport bond, and catalyst performance is affected by different supports.

The physicochemical properties of catalysts, including chemical qualities (such as acid strength and stability) and morphological characteristics, significantly influence their performance in dehydrogenation reactions. The equilibrium conversion of alkanes increases with temperature, but alkene selectivity decreases due to an increased tendency toward dehydrocyclization/aromatisation, thermal cracking, and coke formation. The extent of PtSn interactions depends on the impregnation sequence of Pt and Sn precursors on the support material. The framework of microporous zeolites exerts dispersive forces on reactant molecules, which depend on the shape, channel, and cavity of the framework. The nature and density of active sites also influence the framework dispersion forces. Recent reports have shown that the strong electrostatic field between protons or exchanged metal ions and basic oxygen species can enhance and/or induce polarization of bonds in hydrocarbon adsorbates. This polarization effect can be viewed as an intermediate condition to hydride abstraction, an important elementary step in CH activation. The polarizing effect increases with increasing charge magnitude and ionic radius of the alkane polarizing cations. The choice of cations should be such that they exhibit no catalytic effects on the target alkene products at the reaction condition. It may be beneficial to create a CH polarization effect on the zeolite framework by appropriate modification of framework atoms. Active sites are usually created on the zeolite frameworks. The active sites of the bimolecular pathway are formed in situ and are made up of an alkyl carbenium ion ionically held to the zeolite framework oxygen ion. The active sites of the unimolecular pathway are the charge balancing protons of the zeolite framework. A proton and a carbenium ion are electrophilic or Lewis acid species, and the two pathways essentially involve electrophilic CH activation. The exchanged metal ions in zeolites are held ionically by one or more basic oxygen atoms. Different species have been suggested, depending on the density of the cation exchange site of the zeolite and the method of introduction of the metals. High alkene selectivities are obtained on the H-ZSM-5 when exchangeable protons are rigorously replaced by Zn and Ga. The CH activation on the OZn2+O site can be described by a Lewis base-assisted deprotonation mechanism, accompanied by conversion of the Lewis base site to a conjugate Bronsted acid site. The OGa+ site, however, activates the CH bond via oxidative addition without a protonic site intermediate. A protonic site intermediate increases the tendency of side reactions on the Zn-exchanged H-ZSM-5 relative to the Ga counterpart. The elementary steps of CH activation on OGa+ reveal that a redox cycle at the metal center is required for catalytic CH activation via the oxidative addition mechanism. However, under alkane dehydrogenation reaction conditions, the OZn2+O sites can undergo a reversible Zn2+/Zn redox process, increasing the availability of undesired protonic site intermediates. Zn-exchanged H-ZSM-5 prepared by conventional ion-exchange methods contain a significant percentage of unexchanged proton sites, leading to lower alkene selectivity of the catalyst. Another strategy to enhance alkene selectivity is by controlling the strength of the proton sites. The acidity of the sites depends on the nature of the trivalent cation of the zeolite framework. Proton sites in borosilicate zeolites are weaker than those of aluminosilicate, and thus higher alkene selectivity is expected for alkane dehydrogenation over Zn/H[B]-ZSM-5 compared to Zn/H[Al]-ZSM-5. However, Zn/H[B]-ZSM-5 shows no activity for propane dehydrogenation. The desired weaker acidity of the proton sites of Zn/H[B]-ZSM-5 requires weaker basicity of the oxygen atoms in the zeolite framework. This reduced basicity of the oxygen atoms is not sufficiently polarizing to complement the exchanged Zn2+ in CH bond cleavage. Elimination of the proton sites of zeolites is critical for obtaining a high alkene selectivity and stability in dehydrogenation catalysts. Pt is the most versatile noble metal catalyst for alkane reactions, often justified by its higher activity, stability, and selectivity for these reactions compared to less expensive alternative transition metals. However, rapid catalyst deactivation due to coke formation remains a challenge even when using a Pt-based catalyst for dehydrogenation of light alkanes. The presence of acid (Bronsted and Lewis) sites on the supports promotes readsorption, oligomerization, and aromatization of alkenes. Promotion of Pt with metals, such as Sn, Ga, Zn, Re, etc., improves catalyst stability, but also leads to faster deactivation rates than Pt/Na[Fe]-ZSM-5. The role of potassium in commercial Cr and Pt-based dehydrogenation catalysts is to minimize the undesired influence of protonic sites on alkene selectivity. The nature and role of surface oxygen species become more evident. The electronic promotion effect of Sn is in line with the oxidative addition CH activation mechanism. However, the Lewis base-assisted deprotonation mechanism could also explain the proposed CH activation on Cr-based catalysts. A recent report suggests that a porous copper-aluminum framework material (stabilized by metal oxide) has better performance (activity/selectivity/stability) for propane dehydrogenation than a PtSn/Al2O3. The Lewis base-assisted deprotonation mechanism may be invoked here, and the redox property of the metal center is likely to play a role in achieving propane dehydrogenation at 350 C. This should constitute the future research direction for non-oxidative dehydrogenation of lower alkanes.

The physicochemical properties of catalysts, including chemical qualities (such as acid strength and stability) and morphological characteristics, significantly influence their performance in dehydrogenation reactions. For instance, the stability of metal oxides or hydride clusters is influenced by the structure of the zeolite framework, and the pore size of zeolites has a slight effect on the catalytic activity, with lower activation barriers for reactions in zeolites with larger pore size. The optimal distance between active sites, such as AlAl distance in zeolites, can be determined to achieve a minimum overall barrier, based on the Sabatier principle. The ultimate goal of theoretical studies is to identify optimal catalysts for specific chemical processes, and the advancements in computational approaches have enabled the exploration of more complex catalytic systems beyond simple transition-metal surfaces. Case studies have provided insights into dehydrogenation mechanisms in these systems, revealing information that is challenging to obtain at the molecular level even with advanced experimental equipment.

The physicochemical properties of catalysts, including chemical qualities and morphological characteristics, significantly influence their performance in dehydrogenation reactions. The geometric and electronic effects are crucial to catalytic systems, particularly in propane dehydrogenation (PDH). The double decoration of PtGa intermetallics with Pb and Ca is a promising catalyst design concept that synergizes the geometric and electronic promotion effects, leading to an ultra-stable catalytic system for PDH. Pb is used for geometric modification to block Pt3 sites, while Ca acts as an electron-donating agent to enrich the electron density of Pt1 sites, suppressing side reactions. This strategy results in a catalyst with outstanding stability in PDH for up to 1 month at 600C.

The literature does not provide specific information on how physicochemical properties of catalysts influence their performance in dehydrogenation reactions or on support modification strategies to optimize these properties. However, it does discuss the influence of support acidity on the electronic properties of supported metals, and how the presence of metals affects the acidic properties of supports. The study shows that the electronic properties of Pt are influenced by the acidity of the support, and the alteration of Pt properties increases with increasing acidity of the support. At the same time, the presence of platinum affects the acidic properties of the supports by reducing the strength of the acid sites. This is observed directly as the changes in desorption of pyridine from the acid sites and indirectly as the suppression of cracking reactions during the ring opening of decalin on the Pt-modified catalysts. This could potentially impact the catalytic efficiency and selectivity in reactions that require both metal and acid active sites.

The physicochemical properties of catalysts, including chemical qualities and morphological characteristics, significantly influence their performance in dehydrogenation reactions. Al2O3, due to its structural advantages and stability, is commonly used as a support in heterogeneous catalysis. The coordinately unsaturated Al3+ sites on the (100) facets of commercial γ-Al2O3 can serve as anchor sites for atomically dispersed Pt and Ru sites. The specific interaction between Ga2O3 and Al2O3 allows the tetrahedral Ga3+ cations to disperse in the spinel-type γ-Ga2O3-Al2O3 solid solution, enhancing activity and stability in PDH reactions. The γ-Al2O3 nanosheet, containing 27% penta-coordinated Al3+ sites, can disperse and stabilize bimetallic PtSn nanoclusters due to strong interactions between metals and support, leading to excellent performance in long-term PDH reactions at ultrahigh space velocities. Hydroxyl groups-eliminated Al2O3 shows high activity of coordinately unsaturated Al3+ as surface active sites in non-oxidative dehydrogenation of isobutane to isobutylene. The diversity and complexity of Al2O3 structure, such as surface acidity at low-coordinated Al sites, determine different properties in propane adsorption, activation, and coke deposition in PDH reactions. A one-step hydrothermal method synthesizes sheet-shaped CoAl2O3HT catalysts for efficient PDH catalysis, benchmarking structural and catalytic stabilities and CoAl2O3 interactions against an impregnated Co/Al2O3-IMP catalyst. The effect of C3H6 desorption behavior in Co-catalyzed PDH reactions is further illustrated. Support modification strategies, such as the use of γ-Al2O3 nanosheets and the specific interaction between Ga2O3 and Al2O3, can optimize these properties for enhanced catalytic efficiency and selectivity.

The acidity of the catalysts was evaluated by NH3-TPD, revealing that parent H-Beta has both weak and strong acid sites, while Si-Beta lacks acid sites after dealumination. The introduction of Pt species results in trace medium acid sites, and Zn species introduce higher amounts of Lewis acid sites. The presence of Pt in 2Zn/Si-Beta leads to an ammonia desorption peak with much higher intensity, indicating strong interaction between Pt and Zn species. Electron microscopy shows that 0.1Pt-2Zn/Si-Beta appears as small aggregates below 100 nm, with Pt and Zn species having close contact on the Si-Beta support. Infrared spectroscopy monitored the evolution of silanol groups after dealumination and metal incorporation, revealing the formation of Pt-Zn species on Si-Beta zeolite. The local electronic environment of Pt is significant for the PDH process and was investigated by FTIR spectra of CO adsorption. XRD patterns show typical diffraction lines for the BEA topology, with a decline in intensity after Zn introduction. Surface areas of zeolite samples were determined by argon adsorption/desorption isotherms, revealing high surface areas and large micropore volumes for all samples, indicating well-preserved microporous structures after dealumination and metal incorporation. The introduction of Pt species via impregnation does not change the dispersion of Zn species on Si-Beta support. The close contact between Pt-Zn species and the electronic interaction thereof make Pt-Zn/Si-Beta robust PDH catalysts.

The physicochemical properties of catalysts, including chemical qualities and morphological characteristics, significantly influence their performance in dehydrogenation reactions. The addition of excess NaCl contributes to the stability of propane dehydrogenation MFI-zeolite catalysts. NaCl promotes the dispersion of Pt, prevents sintering during calcination, and effectively suppresses zeolite acidity. Washing the catalysts after calcination further increases their activity and stability due to the redispersion of water-soluble chlorinated Pt compounds. High external surface acid site concentrations, specific Na/Pt atomic ratios, calcination temperatures, washing with water, and the order of component introduction all contribute to improved Pt dispersion and catalyst stability.

The stability of Pt particles on the surface of supports can be significantly improved by manipulating metal-support interactions. Al2O3 with coordinatively unsaturated pentacoordinate Al3+ sites can stabilize atomically dispersed Pt species by forming Al3+ penta-O-Pt bonds, anchoring Pt particles on the Al2O3 surface. Pt particles can also be tightly stabilized on heteroatoms in the oxide substrate lattice. Small Pt particles stabilized in lattice-confined Sn (IV/II) produce a highly selective and stable Pt-Sn catalyst for propane dehydrogenation. Pt particles confined at the Sn single-site in the zeolite framework exhibit high catalytic performance in propane dehydrogenation, mainly due to the strong interaction between Pt particles and the Sn-zeolite framework. The PtSn bimetallic particles confined in the mesopores of hierarchical ZSM-5 zeolite allow them to become a stable catalyst in propane dehydrogenation at high temperatures. The high efficiency of PtSn/hierarchical ZSM-5 catalysts in propane dehydrogenation is mainly attributed to the confinement of PtSn particles in the mesopores of hierarchical ZSM-5 zeolite.

The physicochemical properties of catalysts, including chemical qualities and morphological characteristics, significantly influence their performance in dehydrogenation reactions. For instance, the coordination saturation of Pt atoms affects the selectivity of propane dehydrogenation, while the unsaturated Pt atoms can catalyze side reactions, leading to carbon deposition. The adsorption configuration and strength of propylene are closely related to the surface structures, which governs the formation of coke. The acidity and coke mobility of the support also play a role in inhibiting coke formation. Various strategies have been proposed to inhibit coke formation, such as geometric separation, electron richness, poisoning acid sites, cofeeding streams, enhancing oxygen mobility, and coke transfer. The textural properties of supports, such as specific surface area, acid-base properties, and thermal stability, have significant influences on the catalytic performance of Pt-based catalysts. To prevent the occurrence of undesirable coke and alkane isomerization on supports, the support acidity should be carefully controlled. Supports with high surface area and uniform pore size distribution are preferred to increase the dispersion of metal particles. Alkaline metals, such as Li, Na, and K, can help poison the strong acid sites and avoid the coke deposition on the Al2O3 surface. Doping Mg into Al2O3 forms a stable spinel phase. Al2O3 nanosheets with abundant penta-coordinate Al atoms have a strong metal-support interaction owing to their capacity for anchoring Pt atoms, which accounts for their high stability. Due to the weak interaction between Pt and SiO2, Pt-based bimetals with high alloying degrees such as PtM intermetallic alloys can be formed by direct H2 pretreatment on SiO2 supports. Comparatively, there exist strong interactions between CeO2 and metal particles, where Pt atoms can be trapped in the form of Pt ions. Additionally, upon using water vapor, the coke deposition could be eliminated accounting for the redox properties of CeO2 under propane dehydrogenation. The adjustable Si/Al ratios and relatively large surface areas can hinder the formation of large hydrocarbon molecules, thus preventing the so-called coke deposits and improving the catalytic stability. Besides, some mesoporous materials, such as SBA-1561 and MCM-41, are often used as the catalyst supports to disperse the active phase with more active sites and less coke deposition. Two-dimensional (2D) early transition metal carbides, i.e., MXenes, due to their well-defined structures and tunable compositions have attracted much attention. Additionally, carbon materials have been widely used for plenty of reactions because of their large surface area, chemical inertness and stability in acidic/basic media. Novel nanostructured carbon materials including carbon nanotubes and graphene as supports have been gradually developed. Obviously, each specific support has its own characteristic and may exhibit a distinctive effect on the catalytic property. It can not only change the selectivity by influencing the component, morphology and distribution of metal particles but also alter the reaction stability by increasing mechanical strength, anti-sintering and anti-coking resistance.

The physicochemical properties of catalysts, including chemical qualities and morphological characteristics, have a significant impact on their performance in dehydrogenation reactions. For example, the surface area-to-metal loading ratio determines the formation of different vanadium species, which affects the catalytic activity. The reducibility of vanadium species also influences the catalytic performance. The addition of MgO can improve the selectivity of vanadium-based catalysts by reducing coke formation. Using silica to dope alumina support can enhance the stability and activity of vanadium oxide catalysts. The type of support and preparation conditions can affect the formation of molybdenum oxide species. Hydrogen reduction can increase conversion but decrease selectivity due to the formation of acid sites. The structure of the support, such as mesoporous GaAl mixed oxide, can increase the resistance to catalyst coking. Poisoning Brnsted acid sites with K can reduce coke formation. Alumina is the most common support, and various methods have been explored to produce chromia-alumina catalysts. The choice of support can also influence the stability and dispersion of the active phase, which in turn affects the catalytic efficiency and selectivity. For example, zirconia has been investigated as an alternative support due to its low surface acidity and enhanced sintering resistance, which can improve the performance of chromia-based catalysts. The acidity of the support can also play a role in catalytic behavior, as demonstrated by the study of porous chromia-pillared α-zirconium phosphate materials. Support modification strategies, such as doping with alkali metals or using mixed oxides, can optimize these properties for enhanced catalytic efficiency and selectivity. For instance, doping with alkali metals can stabilize the structure of the support, reduce surface acidity, and increase the number of active sites. Using mixed oxides can also improve the thermal stability and coking resistance of the catalysts. The surface area-to-metal loading ratio determines the formation of monomeric, polymeric, or crystalline vanadium species on the catalyst. Hydroxyl groups on the support surface are important for anchoring vanadium precursors, while acid sites are detrimental to catalyst performance. Silica doping of alumina support can improve catalyst stability and activity. Addition of MgO can improve dehydrogenation selectivity by reducing coke formation. The reducibility of vanadium species depends on their molecular structure. Molybdenum oxide can exist as monomers, polymers, or crystallites, depending on loading, support, and preparation conditions. Optimal molybdenum oxide activity is achieved with monolayer coverage on alumina. Hydrogen reduction of molybdenum oxide catalyst increases conversion but decreases selectivity. Ga2O3 polymorphs, particularly β-Ga2O3, have high concentration of weak Lewis acid sites for dehydrogenation activity. Coordinatively unsaturated tetrahedral Ga3+ cations are crucial for dehydrogenation activity. High concentration of Lewis acid groups in the form of Ga3+ cations is necessary for dehydrogenation activity. Zeolitic support with low medium and strong acid sites and high weak acid sites leads to most active and stable GaO3/H-ZSM-5 catalyst. Promotion with a base like potassium decreases activity, indicating acidic groups catalyze the reaction. Mesoporous GaAl mixed oxide has increased resistance to coking. Potassium reduces coke formation by poisoning Brnsted acid sites. Platinum acts as a promoter for GaOx, enhancing conversion and selectivity. Platinum assists hydrogen desorption, facilitating regeneration of gallium hydride hydroxide species. The nature of active sites in Ga-based dehydrogenation catalysts is still under debate. Molybdenum oxide can exist as monomers, polymers, or crystallites, depending on loading, support, and preparation conditions. Hydrogen reduction of catalyst increases conversion but decreases selectivity due to acid site formation. The physicochemical properties of catalysts, including chemical qualities and morphological characteristics, significantly influence their performance in dehydrogenation reactions. Alumina is the most common support, and its interaction with the active phase can profoundly impact catalyst activity and selectivity. Noble metals, particularly platinum, are preferred for their superior activation of paraffinic CH bonds and low activity for CC cleavage. The addition of alkaline metals like lithium, sodium, and potassium can poison acid sites on the support, suppressing coke formation. Zirconia is an alternative support that has been investigated, offering low surface acidity and enhanced sintering resistance. Silica requires a high surface area to stabilize Cr6+ sites. Mixed oxides prepared using layered double hydroxide precursors have also been studied for nonoxidative dehydrogenation reactions. The acidity of the support material, such as in chromia-pillared α-zirconium phosphate, can significantly affect catalytic behavior. The physicochemical properties of catalysts, including chemical qualities and morphological characteristics, significantly influence their performance in dehydrogenation reactions. The surface area-to-metal loading ratio determines the formation of different vanadium species, which affects the catalytic activity. The presence of hydroxyl groups on the support surface is crucial for anchoring vanadium precursors, while large V2O5 crystallites are inactive in dehydrogenation. The reducibility of vanadium species depends on their molecular structure, and the reduction of the catalyst by the hydrocarbon feed results in the formation of V4+ and V3+. Initially, deactivation is caused by the strong adsorption of reactants on the active sites and coke deposition. The calcination of the catalyst can remove coke but may further deactivate the catalyst due to the formation of larger V2O5 crystallites or mixed oxides. V2O5 crystallites can revert to active polymeric vanadium species under certain conditions. The addition of CO2 can have a beneficial effect on the catalyst by removing acid sites, facilitating coke gasification, and promoting hydrogen removal. The effect of CO2 depends on the catalyst support, with relatively weak basic sites on activated carbon support facilitating the reverse water gas shift reaction, while strong basic sites on Al2O3 and ZnO2 can be poisoned by CO2. Using silica to dope the alumina support can improve catalyst stability and activity. The addition of MgO can improve the performance of supported vanadium catalysts by reducing coke formation. The physicochemical properties of catalysts, including chemical qualities and morphological characteristics, significantly influence their performance in dehydrogenation reactions. The nature of the support is crucial as it not only determines the mechanical properties of the catalyst but also affects the interaction between the carrier and the active phase, which can profoundly impact catalyst activity and selectivity. For instance, alumina is the most common support, and the method of producing chromia-alumina catalysts can vary, affecting the catalyst's performance. The choice of support can also influence the catalytic activity, with different supports leading to varying orders of activity based on conversion and yield. Zirconia, as an alternative support, has been investigated for its low surface acidity and enhanced sintering resistance. Silica requires a high surface area to stabilize Cr6+ sites, and mixed oxides prepared using layered double hydroxide precursors have been studied for their catalytic properties in dehydrogenation reactions. The acidity of the support, as seen in chromia-pillared α-zirconium phosphate materials, can also influence catalytic behavior, with strong acid sites affecting cracking reactions and medium strength acid sites impacting dehydrogenation reactions. Support modification strategies can be employed to optimize the properties of catalysts for enhanced catalytic efficiency and selectivity. For example, doping alumina-based dehydrogenation catalysts with alkali ions can effectively poison undesirable acid sites, improving selectivity. Using zirconia as a support can prevent the formation of mixed oxides and offer higher thermal stability and surface area. Silica, with its high surface area, can stabilize Cr6+ sites, while mixed oxides prepared using layered double hydroxide precursors can provide improved coking resistance and thermal stability against sintering. Understanding the role of acidity in catalytic behavior can also guide the modification of supports to favor dehydrogenation reactions over cracking reactions. The physicochemical properties of catalysts, including chemical qualities and morphological characteristics, significantly influence their performance in dehydrogenation reactions. For instance, the nature of the support material, such as alumina, zirconia, or silica, can affect the dispersion and stability of the active phase, thereby impacting the catalytic activity and selectivity. The interaction between the support and the active phase can also alter the electronic properties of the catalyst, which can further enhance its performance. Support modification strategies, such as doping with alkali metals or using mixed oxides, can optimize these properties for enhanced catalytic efficiency and selectivity. For example, doping with alkali metals can reduce surface acidity and increase the number of active sites, while using mixed oxides can improve thermal stability and coking resistance.

The physicochemical properties of catalysts, including chemical qualities such as acid strength and stability, and morphological characteristics, significantly influence their performance in dehydrogenation reactions. The stability and tolerance to carbon deposits of Zr-Al-Beta promoted by alkali-metal ions were demonstrated. The modification of alkali-metal ions on both Lewis acid sites and Brnsted acid sites in Zr-Al-Beta was evidenced by XPS and FT-IR spectroscopy. The untreated materials displayed poor product selectivity and high coke deposit in the Meerwein-Ponndorf-Verley reduction of furfural and isopropanol; however, the treatment of alkali-metal ions promoted their catalytic performance with improved recalcitrance to deactivation and coking significantly. The type of alkali-metal ions and the concentration of alkaline solution influenced the catalytic performance, which were found to correlate to the acidity and textual properties. The optimum reaction result (97.3% yield of furfuryl alcohol at 99.6% conversion of furfural) can be obtained on 0.025 M-Na+-Zr-Al-Beta with high tolerance to the furfural concentration. Support modification strategies can be employed to optimize these properties for enhanced catalytic efficiency and selectivity by tuning and normalizing the various acidic sites of zeolites. For instance, the post-synthetic method is demonstrated to be preferential to form open sites, which have stronger Lewis acidic properties than the closed sites. The simple post-synthetic strategy to prepare a Zr-Al-Beta zeolite with both plentiful Lewis acid open Zr (IV) sites and Brnsted acid sites has shown a superior catalytic activity, water-tolerance ability, and reusability in the cascade conversion of cinnamaldehyde toward 1-cinnamyl 2-propyl ether. The controllable tuning for the acid properties with various active sites is greatly required to promote some of the chemical transformations and avoid the possibility of other undesired reaction pathways except for the aimed reaction route, such as dehydration, polymerization, and isomerization.

The physicochemical properties of catalysts, including chemical qualities and morphological characteristics, significantly impact their performance in dehydrogenation reactions. Chemical qualities, such as acid strength and stability, affect the selectivity toward the targeted alkene, while morphological and porous qualities influence the diffusion efficiency. Support modification strategies, summarized in Table 3, can optimize these properties for enhanced catalytic efficiency and selectivity. Proper acidity of the support is crucial for CH activation and propylene desorption in PDH reactions, while excessive acidity can lead to negative impacts such as CC cracking and deep dehydrogenation. For zeolites, Lewis acid sites are preferred for propane dehydrogenation, whereas Brnsted acid sites catalyze cleavage reactions. The diffusion efficiency of reactants and products in heterogeneous catalysts is determined by the morphology, structure, size, and chemical properties of the supports. Strategies to enhance catalytic efficiency include developing nanosized supports and synthesizing supports with specific morphologies and high external surfaces.

The physicochemical properties of catalysts, including chemical qualities and morphological characteristics, significantly influence their performance in dehydrogenation reactions. The decrease of acid centers of Al2O3 and the increase of the degree of alloy formation upon addition of Ca lead to enhanced propylene selectivity and catalyst stability. The deactivation model with residual activity (DMRA) was used to fit the experimental data of propane conversion vs. time, which allowed for the calculation of the intrinsic deactivation kinetic parameters for both catalysts. The Ca-promoted catalyst showed a lower deactivation function and higher residual activity, indicating better resistance against deactivation by coke. The activation energy of the PDH reaction for the Ca-promoted catalyst was slightly higher due to the enhanced reduction of the GeOx species, which enhanced the formation of a Pt-Ge alloy, decreasing the initial activity of the catalyst. However, this also led to better performance in terms of both activity and selectivity at steady state conditions. Support modification strategies, such as the addition of Ca, can optimize these properties for enhanced catalytic efficiency and selectivity.

The physicochemical properties of catalysts, including chemical qualities such as acid strength and stability, play a crucial role in their performance in dehydrogenation reactions. The Lewis acid site, arising from the unsaturated AlIII site in the Al2O3 structure, is the active site for the catalytic cycle. The amount of Lewis acid sites in Al2O3 is positively linked to the propane conversion rate, indicating their importance in propane dehydrogenation. Morphological characteristics, such as the crystalline structure, also influence catalytic performance. γ-Al2O3 possesses more Lewis acid sites than θ-Al2O3, which contributes to its higher activity. The regenerability of the γ-Al2O3-200 catalyst, which can be restored after deactivation, is an important property for practical applications. Support modification strategies, such as controlling the crystalline structure and increasing the number of Lewis acid sites, can be employed to optimize these properties for enhanced catalytic efficiency and selectivity.

The γ-Al2O3-200 catalyst, with a high level of strong acid sites, shows the highest yield in propane dehydrogenation. The formation of Lewis acid sites in Al2O3 is mainly due to the defective AIII site in the structure. The propane conversion rate is positively linked to the amount of Lewis acid sites in Al2O3, indicating that the Lewis acid sites are the active sites for propane dehydrogenation.

The physicochemical properties of catalysts, including chemical qualities and morphological characteristics, significantly influence their performance in dehydrogenation reactions. The use of a diammonium-type bromide surfactant and a sodium-free silica source in the synthesis procedure leads to the formation of silanol nests in the zeolite, which are confirmed by IR and NMR spectroscopies. These silanol nests play a critical role in the formation of intermetallic alloy nanoparticles, such as Pt3Y, which exhibit high catalytic durability, high propane conversion, and propylene selectivity in propane dehydrogenation. The alloy nanoparticles show fully reversible hydrogen chemisorption behavior at room temperature, unlike monometallic Pt nanoparticles. The nanoparticles are homogeneously distributed throughout the support material, with a size of approximately 2 nm. The EDS analysis confirms that these metal nanoparticles contain both Pt and Y in the same particle, with an average atomic ratio of Pt to Y of approximately 3. The PtY(0.5)/MZ-sf-Br and PtY(0.5)/MZ-sf-OH catalysts show superior catalytic durability compared to PtY(0.5)/MZ-dg. The catalysts supported on silanol nest-containing zeolites have an activation period to reach full conversion. The propane conversion is higher than the equilibrium value during the early reaction period. The TGA profile for the spent PtY(0.5)/MZ-sf-Br catalyst shows that 37 wt% of coke species are deposited on the catalyst sample. The PtY(0.5)/MZ-sf-Br catalyst exhibits slow deactivation over 20 days, while PtY(0.5)/MZ-sf-Br-NaCl is deactivated within 1 day, similar to Pt(0.5)/MZ-sc. Support modification strategies, such as the use of a diammonium-type bromide surfactant and a sodium-free silica source, can optimize the properties of zeolite supports for enhanced catalytic efficiency and selectivity in dehydrogenation reactions.

The physicochemical properties of catalysts, including chemical qualities and morphological characteristics, significantly influence their performance in dehydrogenation reactions. Catalysts synthesized by wet impregnation method, such as CrOx supported on high-silica HZSM-5 with a SiO2/Al2O3 ratio of 260, exhibit high catalytic activity, good selectivity, and excellent stability for PDH. The exploitation of an efficient PDH catalyst based on HZSM-5 zeolite to achieve both high selectivity and stability is still a challenge. In zeolite supported catalysts, zeolite provides a special environment for catalytic reactions, including channel confinement effects, acidic sites, and electron transfer. Acidic sites in zeolites play a key role in determining the catalytic performance of zeolite catalysts in alkane conversion. The role of Cr species and Brnsted acid sites in Cr/HZSM-5 catalysts is elucidated through physicochemical characterizations, PDH tests, and Na+ doping experiments. The structural properties of the prepared CrOx catalysts are detected by N2 sorption technique. The XRD patterns of parent HZSM-5(260) and Cr/Z-5(260) samples are similar, indicating that the Cr loading has little influence on the crystallite structure of HZSM-5 zeolite. The acidity properties of the prepared Cr/Z-5, Cr/SiO2, and Cr/Al2O3 catalysts are detected by NH3-TPD technique. The metal-support interactions between Cr species and HZSM-5 support are measured by XPS spectroscopy. During the PDH tests, the high reaction temperature results in coke formation onto the catalyst, which is the main cause of catalyst deactivation. The interactions between react/product molecules and catalysts are very important in dehydrogenation process. The effect of Cr loading amount and SiO2/Al2O3 ratio on the catalytic performance of Cr/HZSM-5 catalysts is investigated in detail. The role of Cr species and Brnsted acid sites in Cr/HZSM-5 catalysts is elucidated through physicochemical characterizations, PDH tests, and Na+ doping experiments. Characterization results and Na+ doping experiments reveal that the Cr species combined with Brnsted acid sites in Cr/HZSM-5 catalysts are responsible for the high catalytic performance. The Brnsted acid sites in HZSM-5 zeolite increase propane adsorption and enhance CH bond activation. The high surface area and well-defined pores of HZSM-5 zeolite provide a special environment for the dispersion and stabilization of Cr species, ensuring high catalytic activity and stability. The selection of supports for Cr-based catalysts is crucial for PDH. Zeolites, with their high surface area, well-defined channels, good thermal stability, and tunable acidity, can serve as catalysts or supports for various catalytic reactions. The high amounts of acidic sites of HZSM-5 zeolites are negative for PDH reaction, and only HZSM-5 zeolite with suitable acidic sites can be used as a good support for CrOx catalysts for PDH process. The Brnsted acid sites play an important role in determining the catalytic performance of Cr/Z-5 catalyst system. The Brnsted acid sites in HZSM-5(260) play a key role in propane adsorption and activation, affecting their catalytic performance.

The physicochemical properties of catalysts, including chemical qualities and morphological characteristics, significantly influence their performance in dehydrogenation reactions. The crystallization temperature of the support directly affects the catalytic performance of VOx/Al2O3 catalysts by increasing Lewis acid sites and influencing the distribution of different surface V species. P modification can decrease the degree of VOx polymerization, enhancing catalyst stability and activity. Mg modification can improve catalytic performance and anti-coking capability by dispersing V2O5 crystallites and increasing active V3+ species. Gelation and calcination temperatures also impact the catalytic performance of VOx/SiO2 catalysts in terms of propane conversion, propene selectivity, and yield of propene. Dealuminated beta zeolites (Si-beta) are promising catalyst supports due to their high surface area and thermal stability, and the initial propane conversion linearly increases with the amount of acid sites. VOx/ZrO2 is more active than VOx/Al2O3 and pure ZrO2 due to the facile reduction of VO, VOV, and VOZr bonds, producing higher proportions of the active V3+ species. The balance of acid and base sites on the catalyst surface is crucial for all dehydrogenation methods. The development of an active, selective, and stable catalyst is essential for dehydrogenation to be considered a viable process in the future. Support modification strategies can optimize these properties for enhanced catalytic efficiency and selectivity. Using supports with ordered mesoporosity and moderate surface acidity can aid mass transfer and avoid undesirable secondary reactions. Promoting elements can cause beneficial geometric and electronic effects on both the supports and active species. However, environmental and safety concerns exist in the preparation, usage, and disposal of certain catalysts due to their toxicity. Ga catalysts, while less active than Pt and Cr catalysts, have the advantage of being benign and inexpensive. The nature of the support is essential for vanadium-based catalysts, as the metalsupport interactions affect the resultant catalyst performance. The activity is dependent on the bond strength of the VOsupport bond, and catalyst performance is affected by different supports.

The physicochemical properties of catalysts, including chemical qualities (such as acid strength and stability) and morphological characteristics, significantly influence their performance in dehydrogenation reactions. The equilibrium conversion of alkanes increases with temperature, but alkene selectivity decreases due to an increased tendency toward dehydrocyclization/aromatisation, thermal cracking, and coke formation. The extent of PtSn interactions depends on the impregnation sequence of Pt and Sn precursors on the support material. The framework of microporous zeolites exerts dispersive forces on reactant molecules, which depend on the shape, channel, and cavity of the framework. The nature and density of active sites also influence the framework dispersion forces. Recent reports have shown that the strong electrostatic field between protons or exchanged metal ions and basic oxygen species can enhance and/or induce polarization of bonds in hydrocarbon adsorbates. This polarization effect can be viewed as an intermediate condition to hydride abstraction, an important elementary step in CH activation. The polarizing effect increases with increasing charge magnitude and ionic radius of the alkane polarizing cations. The choice of cations should be such that they exhibit no catalytic effects on the target alkene products at the reaction condition. It may be beneficial to create a CH polarization effect on the zeolite framework by appropriate modification of framework atoms. Active sites are usually created on the zeolite frameworks. The active sites of the bimolecular pathway are formed in situ and are made up of an alkyl carbenium ion ionically held to the zeolite framework oxygen ion. The active sites of the unimolecular pathway are the charge balancing protons of the zeolite framework. A proton and a carbenium ion are electrophilic or Lewis acid species, and the two pathways essentially involve electrophilic CH activation. The exchanged metal ions in zeolites are held ionically by one or more basic oxygen atoms. Different species have been suggested, depending on the density of the cation exchange site of the zeolite and the method of introduction of the metals. High alkene selectivities are obtained on the H-ZSM-5 when exchangeable protons are rigorously replaced by Zn and Ga. The CH activation on the OZn2+O site can be described by a Lewis base-assisted deprotonation mechanism, accompanied by conversion of the Lewis base site to a conjugate Bronsted acid site. The OGa+ site, however, activates the CH bond via oxidative addition without a protonic site intermediate. A protonic site intermediate increases the tendency of side reactions on the Zn-exchanged H-ZSM-5 relative to the Ga counterpart. The elementary steps of CH activation on OGa+ reveal that a redox cycle at the metal center is required for catalytic CH activation via the oxidative addition mechanism. However, under alkane dehydrogenation reaction conditions, the OZn2+O sites can undergo a reversible Zn2+/Zn redox process, increasing the availability of undesired protonic site intermediates. Zn-exchanged H-ZSM-5 prepared by conventional ion-exchange methods contain a significant percentage of unexchanged proton sites, leading to lower alkene selectivity of the catalyst. Another strategy to enhance alkene selectivity is by controlling the strength of the proton sites. The acidity of the sites depends on the nature of the trivalent cation of the zeolite framework. Proton sites in borosilicate zeolites are weaker than those of aluminosilicate, and thus higher alkene selectivity is expected for alkane dehydrogenation over Zn/H[B]-ZSM-5 compared to Zn/H[Al]-ZSM-5. However, Zn/H[B]-ZSM-5 shows no activity for propane dehydrogenation. The desired weaker acidity of the proton sites of Zn/H[B]-ZSM-5 requires weaker basicity of the oxygen atoms in the zeolite framework. This reduced basicity of the oxygen atoms is not sufficiently polarizing to complement the exchanged Zn2+ in CH bond cleavage. Elimination of the proton sites of zeolites is critical for obtaining a high alkene selectivity and stability in dehydrogenation catalysts. Pt is the most versatile noble metal catalyst for alkane reactions, often justified by its higher activity, stability, and selectivity for these reactions compared to less expensive alternative transition metals. However, rapid catalyst deactivation due to coke formation remains a challenge even when using a Pt-based catalyst for dehydrogenation of light alkanes. The presence of acid (Bronsted and Lewis) sites on the supports promotes readsorption, oligomerization, and aromatization of alkenes. Promotion of Pt with metals, such as Sn, Ga, Zn, Re, etc., improves catalyst stability, but also leads to faster deactivation rates than Pt/Na[Fe]-ZSM-5. The role of potassium in commercial Cr and Pt-based dehydrogenation catalysts is to minimize the undesired influence of protonic sites on alkene selectivity. The nature and role of surface oxygen species become more evident. The electronic promotion effect of Sn is in line with the oxidative addition CH activation mechanism. However, the Lewis base-assisted deprotonation mechanism could also explain the proposed CH activation on Cr-based catalysts. A recent report suggests that a porous copper-aluminum framework material (stabilized by metal oxide) has better performance (activity/selectivity/stability) for propane dehydrogenation than a PtSn/Al2O3. The Lewis base-assisted deprotonation mechanism may be invoked here, and the redox property of the metal center is likely to play a role in achieving propane dehydrogenation at 350 C. This should constitute the future research direction for non-oxidative dehydrogenation of lower alkanes.

The physicochemical properties of catalysts, including chemical qualities (such as acid strength and stability) and morphological characteristics, significantly influence their performance in dehydrogenation reactions. For instance, the stability of metal oxides or hydride clusters is influenced by the structure of the zeolite framework, and the pore size of zeolites has a slight effect on the catalytic activity, with lower activation barriers for reactions in zeolites with larger pore size. The optimal distance between active sites, such as AlAl distance in zeolites, can be determined to achieve a minimum overall barrier, based on the Sabatier principle. The ultimate goal of theoretical studies is to identify optimal catalysts for specific chemical processes, and the advancements in computational approaches have enabled the exploration of more complex catalytic systems beyond simple transition-metal surfaces. Case studies have provided insights into dehydrogenation mechanisms in these systems, revealing information that is challenging to obtain at the molecular level even with advanced experimental equipment.

The physicochemical properties of catalysts, including chemical qualities and morphological characteristics, significantly influence their performance in dehydrogenation reactions. The geometric and electronic effects are crucial to catalytic systems, particularly in propane dehydrogenation (PDH). The double decoration of PtGa intermetallics with Pb and Ca is a promising catalyst design concept that synergizes the geometric and electronic promotion effects, leading to an ultra-stable catalytic system for PDH. Pb is used for geometric modification to block Pt3 sites, while Ca acts as an electron-donating agent to enrich the electron density of Pt1 sites, suppressing side reactions. This strategy results in a catalyst with outstanding stability in PDH for up to 1 month at 600C.

The literature does not provide specific information on how physicochemical properties of catalysts influence their performance in dehydrogenation reactions or on support modification strategies to optimize these properties. However, it does discuss the influence of support acidity on the electronic properties of supported metals, and how the presence of metals affects the acidic properties of supports. The study shows that the electronic properties of Pt are influenced by the acidity of the support, and the alteration of Pt properties increases with increasing acidity of the support. At the same time, the presence of platinum affects the acidic properties of the supports by reducing the strength of the acid sites. This is observed directly as the changes in desorption of pyridine from the acid sites and indirectly as the suppression of cracking reactions during the ring opening of decalin on the Pt-modified catalysts. This could potentially impact the catalytic efficiency and selectivity in reactions that require both metal and acid active sites.

The physicochemical properties of catalysts, including chemical qualities and morphological characteristics, significantly influence their performance in dehydrogenation reactions. Al2O3, due to its structural advantages and stability, is commonly used as a support in heterogeneous catalysis. The coordinately unsaturated Al3+ sites on the (100) facets of commercial γ-Al2O3 can serve as anchor sites for atomically dispersed Pt and Ru sites. The specific interaction between Ga2O3 and Al2O3 allows the tetrahedral Ga3+ cations to disperse in the spinel-type γ-Ga2O3-Al2O3 solid solution, enhancing activity and stability in PDH reactions. The γ-Al2O3 nanosheet, containing 27% penta-coordinated Al3+ sites, can disperse and stabilize bimetallic PtSn nanoclusters due to strong interactions between metals and support, leading to excellent performance in long-term PDH reactions at ultrahigh space velocities. Hydroxyl groups-eliminated Al2O3 shows high activity of coordinately unsaturated Al3+ as surface active sites in non-oxidative dehydrogenation of isobutane to isobutylene. The diversity and complexity of Al2O3 structure, such as surface acidity at low-coordinated Al sites, determine different properties in propane adsorption, activation, and coke deposition in PDH reactions. A one-step hydrothermal method synthesizes sheet-shaped CoAl2O3HT catalysts for efficient PDH catalysis, benchmarking structural and catalytic stabilities and CoAl2O3 interactions against an impregnated Co/Al2O3-IMP catalyst. The effect of C3H6 desorption behavior in Co-catalyzed PDH reactions is further illustrated. Support modification strategies, such as the use of γ-Al2O3 nanosheets and the specific interaction between Ga2O3 and Al2O3, can optimize these properties for enhanced catalytic efficiency and selectivity.

The acidity of the catalysts was evaluated by NH3-TPD, revealing that parent H-Beta has both weak and strong acid sites, while Si-Beta lacks acid sites after dealumination. The introduction of Pt species results in trace medium acid sites, and Zn species introduce higher amounts of Lewis acid sites. The presence of Pt in 2Zn/Si-Beta leads to an ammonia desorption peak with much higher intensity, indicating strong interaction between Pt and Zn species. Electron microscopy shows that 0.1Pt-2Zn/Si-Beta appears as small aggregates below 100 nm, with Pt and Zn species having close contact on the Si-Beta support. Infrared spectroscopy monitored the evolution of silanol groups after dealumination and metal incorporation, revealing the formation of Pt-Zn species on Si-Beta zeolite. The local electronic environment of Pt is significant for the PDH process and was investigated by FTIR spectra of CO adsorption. XRD patterns show typical diffraction lines for the BEA topology, with a decline in intensity after Zn introduction. Surface areas of zeolite samples were determined by argon adsorption/desorption isotherms, revealing high surface areas and large micropore volumes for all samples, indicating well-preserved microporous structures after dealumination and metal incorporation. The introduction of Pt species via impregnation does not change the dispersion of Zn species on Si-Beta support. The close contact between Pt-Zn species and the electronic interaction thereof make Pt-Zn/Si-Beta robust PDH catalysts.

The physicochemical properties of catalysts, including chemical qualities and morphological characteristics, significantly influence their performance in dehydrogenation reactions. The addition of excess NaCl contributes to the stability of propane dehydrogenation MFI-zeolite catalysts. NaCl promotes the dispersion of Pt, prevents sintering during calcination, and effectively suppresses zeolite acidity. Washing the catalysts after calcination further increases their activity and stability due to the redispersion of water-soluble chlorinated Pt compounds. High external surface acid site concentrations, specific Na/Pt atomic ratios, calcination temperatures, washing with water, and the order of component introduction all contribute to improved Pt dispersion and catalyst stability.

The stability of Pt particles on the surface of supports can be significantly improved by manipulating metal-support interactions. Al2O3 with coordinatively unsaturated pentacoordinate Al3+ sites can stabilize atomically dispersed Pt species by forming Al3+ penta-O-Pt bonds, anchoring Pt particles on the Al2O3 surface. Pt particles can also be tightly stabilized on heteroatoms in the oxide substrate lattice. Small Pt particles stabilized in lattice-confined Sn (IV/II) produce a highly selective and stable Pt-Sn catalyst for propane dehydrogenation. Pt particles confined at the Sn single-site in the zeolite framework exhibit high catalytic performance in propane dehydrogenation, mainly due to the strong interaction between Pt particles and the Sn-zeolite framework. The PtSn bimetallic particles confined in the mesopores of hierarchical ZSM-5 zeolite allow them to become a stable catalyst in propane dehydrogenation at high temperatures. The high efficiency of PtSn/hierarchical ZSM-5 catalysts in propane dehydrogenation is mainly attributed to the confinement of PtSn particles in the mesopores of hierarchical ZSM-5 zeolite.

The physicochemical properties of catalysts, including chemical qualities and morphological characteristics, significantly influence their performance in dehydrogenation reactions. For instance, the coordination saturation of Pt atoms affects the selectivity of propane dehydrogenation, while the unsaturated Pt atoms can catalyze side reactions, leading to carbon deposition. The adsorption configuration and strength of propylene are closely related to the surface structures, which governs the formation of coke. The acidity and coke mobility of the support also play a role in inhibiting coke formation. Various strategies have been proposed to inhibit coke formation, such as geometric separation, electron richness, poisoning acid sites, cofeeding streams, enhancing oxygen mobility, and coke transfer. The textural properties of supports, such as specific surface area, acid-base properties, and thermal stability, have significant influences on the catalytic performance of Pt-based catalysts. To prevent the occurrence of undesirable coke and alkane isomerization on supports, the support acidity should be carefully controlled. Supports with high surface area and uniform pore size distribution are preferred to increase the dispersion of metal particles. Alkaline metals, such as Li, Na, and K, can help poison the strong acid sites and avoid the coke deposition on the Al2O3 surface. Doping Mg into Al2O3 forms a stable spinel phase. Al2O3 nanosheets with abundant penta-coordinate Al atoms have a strong metal-support interaction owing to their capacity for anchoring Pt atoms, which accounts for their high stability. Due to the weak interaction between Pt and SiO2, Pt-based bimetals with high alloying degrees such as PtM intermetallic alloys can be formed by direct H2 pretreatment on SiO2 supports. Comparatively, there exist strong interactions between CeO2 and metal particles, where Pt atoms can be trapped in the form of Pt ions. Additionally, upon using water vapor, the coke deposition could be eliminated accounting for the redox properties of CeO2 under propane dehydrogenation. The adjustable Si/Al ratios and relatively large surface areas can hinder the formation of large hydrocarbon molecules, thus preventing the so-called coke deposits and improving the catalytic stability. Besides, some mesoporous materials, such as SBA-1561 and MCM-41, are often used as the catalyst supports to disperse the active phase with more active sites and less coke deposition. Two-dimensional (2D) early transition metal carbides, i.e., MXenes, due to their well-defined structures and tunable compositions have attracted much attention. Additionally, carbon materials have been widely used for plenty of reactions because of their large surface area, chemical inertness and stability in acidic/basic media. Novel nanostructured carbon materials including carbon nanotubes and graphene as supports have been gradually developed. Obviously, each specific support has its own characteristic and may exhibit a distinctive effect on the catalytic property. It can not only change the selectivity by influencing the component, morphology and distribution of metal particles but also alter the reaction stability by increasing mechanical strength, anti-sintering and anti-coking resistance.

The physicochemical properties of catalysts, including chemical qualities and morphological characteristics, have a significant impact on their performance in dehydrogenation reactions. For example, the surface area-to-metal loading ratio determines the formation of different vanadium species, which affects the catalytic activity. The reducibility of vanadium species also influences the catalytic performance. The addition of MgO can improve the selectivity of vanadium-based catalysts by reducing coke formation. Using silica to dope alumina support can enhance the stability and activity of vanadium oxide catalysts. The type of support and preparation conditions can affect the formation of molybdenum oxide species. Hydrogen reduction can increase conversion but decrease selectivity due to the formation of acid sites. The structure of the support, such as mesoporous GaAl mixed oxide, can increase the resistance to catalyst coking. Poisoning Brnsted acid sites with K can reduce coke formation. Alumina is the most common support, and various methods have been explored to produce chromia-alumina catalysts. The choice of support can also influence the stability and dispersion of the active phase, which in turn affects the catalytic efficiency and selectivity. For example, zirconia has been investigated as an alternative support due to its low surface acidity and enhanced sintering resistance, which can improve the performance of chromia-based catalysts. The acidity of the support can also play a role in catalytic behavior, as demonstrated by the study of porous chromia-pillared α-zirconium phosphate materials. Support modification strategies, such as doping with alkali metals or using mixed oxides, can optimize these properties for enhanced catalytic efficiency and selectivity. For instance, doping with alkali metals can stabilize the structure of the support, reduce surface acidity, and increase the number of active sites. Using mixed oxides can also improve the thermal stability and coking resistance of the catalysts. The surface area-to-metal loading ratio determines the formation of monomeric, polymeric, or crystalline vanadium species on the catalyst. Hydroxyl groups on the support surface are important for anchoring vanadium precursors, while acid sites are detrimental to catalyst performance. Silica doping of alumina support can improve catalyst stability and activity. Addition of MgO can improve dehydrogenation selectivity by reducing coke formation. The reducibility of vanadium species depends on their molecular structure. Molybdenum oxide can exist as monomers, polymers, or crystallites, depending on loading, support, and preparation conditions. Optimal molybdenum oxide activity is achieved with monolayer coverage on alumina. Hydrogen reduction of molybdenum oxide catalyst increases conversion but decreases selectivity. Ga2O3 polymorphs, particularly β-Ga2O3, have high concentration of weak Lewis acid sites for dehydrogenation activity. Coordinatively unsaturated tetrahedral Ga3+ cations are crucial for dehydrogenation activity. High concentration of Lewis acid groups in the form of Ga3+ cations is necessary for dehydrogenation activity. Zeolitic support with low medium and strong acid sites and high weak acid sites leads to most active and stable GaO3/H-ZSM-5 catalyst. Promotion with a base like potassium decreases activity, indicating acidic groups catalyze the reaction. Mesoporous GaAl mixed oxide has increased resistance to coking. Potassium reduces coke formation by poisoning Brnsted acid sites. Platinum acts as a promoter for GaOx, enhancing conversion and selectivity. Platinum assists hydrogen desorption, facilitating regeneration of gallium hydride hydroxide species. The nature of active sites in Ga-based dehydrogenation catalysts is still under debate. Molybdenum oxide can exist as monomers, polymers, or crystallites, depending on loading, support, and preparation conditions. Hydrogen reduction of catalyst increases conversion but decreases selectivity due to acid site formation. The physicochemical properties of catalysts, including chemical qualities and morphological characteristics, significantly influence their performance in dehydrogenation reactions. Alumina is the most common support, and its interaction with the active phase can profoundly impact catalyst activity and selectivity. Noble metals, particularly platinum, are preferred for their superior activation of paraffinic CH bonds and low activity for CC cleavage. The addition of alkaline metals like lithium, sodium, and potassium can poison acid sites on the support, suppressing coke formation. Zirconia is an alternative support that has been investigated, offering low surface acidity and enhanced sintering resistance. Silica requires a high surface area to stabilize Cr6+ sites. Mixed oxides prepared using layered double hydroxide precursors have also been studied for nonoxidative dehydrogenation reactions. The acidity of the support material, such as in chromia-pillared α-zirconium phosphate, can significantly affect catalytic behavior. The physicochemical properties of catalysts, including chemical qualities and morphological characteristics, significantly influence their performance in dehydrogenation reactions. The surface area-to-metal loading ratio determines the formation of different vanadium species, which affects the catalytic activity. The presence of hydroxyl groups on the support surface is crucial for anchoring vanadium precursors, while large V2O5 crystallites are inactive in dehydrogenation. The reducibility of vanadium species depends on their molecular structure, and the reduction of the catalyst by the hydrocarbon feed results in the formation of V4+ and V3+. Initially, deactivation is caused by the strong adsorption of reactants on the active sites and coke deposition. The calcination of the catalyst can remove coke but may further deactivate the catalyst due to the formation of larger V2O5 crystallites or mixed oxides. V2O5 crystallites can revert to active polymeric vanadium species under certain conditions. The addition of CO2 can have a beneficial effect on the catalyst by removing acid sites, facilitating coke gasification, and promoting hydrogen removal. The effect of CO2 depends on the catalyst support, with relatively weak basic sites on activated carbon support facilitating the reverse water gas shift reaction, while strong basic sites on Al2O3 and ZnO2 can be poisoned by CO2. Using silica to dope the alumina support can improve catalyst stability and activity. The addition of MgO can improve the performance of supported vanadium catalysts by reducing coke formation. The physicochemical properties of catalysts, including chemical qualities and morphological characteristics, significantly influence their performance in dehydrogenation reactions. The nature of the support is crucial as it not only determines the mechanical properties of the catalyst but also affects the interaction between the carrier and the active phase, which can profoundly impact catalyst activity and selectivity. For instance, alumina is the most common support, and the method of producing chromia-alumina catalysts can vary, affecting the catalyst's performance. The choice of support can also influence the catalytic activity, with different supports leading to varying orders of activity based on conversion and yield. Zirconia, as an alternative support, has been investigated for its low surface acidity and enhanced sintering resistance. Silica requires a high surface area to stabilize Cr6+ sites, and mixed oxides prepared using layered double hydroxide precursors have been studied for their catalytic properties in dehydrogenation reactions. The acidity of the support, as seen in chromia-pillared α-zirconium phosphate materials, can also influence catalytic behavior, with strong acid sites affecting cracking reactions and medium strength acid sites impacting dehydrogenation reactions. Support modification strategies can be employed to optimize the properties of catalysts for enhanced catalytic efficiency and selectivity. For example, doping alumina-based dehydrogenation catalysts with alkali ions can effectively poison undesirable acid sites, improving selectivity. Using zirconia as a support can prevent the formation of mixed oxides and offer higher thermal stability and surface area. Silica, with its high surface area, can stabilize Cr6+ sites, while mixed oxides prepared using layered double hydroxide precursors can provide improved coking resistance and thermal stability against sintering. Understanding the role of acidity in catalytic behavior can also guide the modification of supports to favor dehydrogenation reactions over cracking reactions. The physicochemical properties of catalysts, including chemical qualities and morphological characteristics, significantly influence their performance in dehydrogenation reactions. For instance, the nature of the support material, such as alumina, zirconia, or silica, can affect the dispersion and stability of the active phase, thereby impacting the catalytic activity and selectivity. The interaction between the support and the active phase can also alter the electronic properties of the catalyst, which can further enhance its performance. Support modification strategies, such as doping with alkali metals or using mixed oxides, can optimize these properties for enhanced catalytic efficiency and selectivity. For example, doping with alkali metals can reduce surface acidity and increase the number of active sites, while using mixed oxides can improve thermal stability and coking resistance.

The physicochemical properties of catalysts, including chemical qualities such as acid strength and stability, and morphological characteristics, significantly influence their performance in dehydrogenation reactions. The stability and tolerance to carbon deposits of Zr-Al-Beta promoted by alkali-metal ions were demonstrated. The modification of alkali-metal ions on both Lewis acid sites and Brnsted acid sites in Zr-Al-Beta was evidenced by XPS and FT-IR spectroscopy. The untreated materials displayed poor product selectivity and high coke deposit in the Meerwein-Ponndorf-Verley reduction of furfural and isopropanol; however, the treatment of alkali-metal ions promoted their catalytic performance with improved recalcitrance to deactivation and coking significantly. The type of alkali-metal ions and the concentration of alkaline solution influenced the catalytic performance, which were found to correlate to the acidity and textual properties. The optimum reaction result (97.3% yield of furfuryl alcohol at 99.6% conversion of furfural) can be obtained on 0.025 M-Na+-Zr-Al-Beta with high tolerance to the furfural concentration. Support modification strategies can be employed to optimize these properties for enhanced catalytic efficiency and selectivity by tuning and normalizing the various acidic sites of zeolites. For instance, the post-synthetic method is demonstrated to be preferential to form open sites, which have stronger Lewis acidic properties than the closed sites. The simple post-synthetic strategy to prepare a Zr-Al-Beta zeolite with both plentiful Lewis acid open Zr (IV) sites and Brnsted acid sites has shown a superior catalytic activity, water-tolerance ability, and reusability in the cascade conversion of cinnamaldehyde toward 1-cinnamyl 2-propyl ether. The controllable tuning for the acid properties with various active sites is greatly required to promote some of the chemical transformations and avoid the possibility of other undesired reaction pathways except for the aimed reaction route, such as dehydration, polymerization, and isomerization.

The physicochemical properties of catalysts, including chemical qualities and morphological characteristics, significantly impact their performance in dehydrogenation reactions. Chemical qualities, such as acid strength and stability, affect the selectivity toward the targeted alkene, while morphological and porous qualities influence the diffusion efficiency. Support modification strategies, summarized in Table 3, can optimize these properties for enhanced catalytic efficiency and selectivity. Proper acidity of the support is crucial for CH activation and propylene desorption in PDH reactions, while excessive acidity can lead to negative impacts such as CC cracking and deep dehydrogenation. For zeolites, Lewis acid sites are preferred for propane dehydrogenation, whereas Brnsted acid sites catalyze cleavage reactions. The diffusion efficiency of reactants and products in heterogeneous catalysts is determined by the morphology, structure, size, and chemical properties of the supports. Strategies to enhance catalytic efficiency include developing nanosized supports and synthesizing supports with specific morphologies and high external surfaces.

The physicochemical properties of catalysts, including chemical qualities and morphological characteristics, significantly influence their performance in dehydrogenation reactions. The decrease of acid centers of Al2O3 and the increase of the degree of alloy formation upon addition of Ca lead to enhanced propylene selectivity and catalyst stability. The deactivation model with residual activity (DMRA) was used to fit the experimental data of propane conversion vs. time, which allowed for the calculation of the intrinsic deactivation kinetic parameters for both catalysts. The Ca-promoted catalyst showed a lower deactivation function and higher residual activity, indicating better resistance against deactivation by coke. The activation energy of the PDH reaction for the Ca-promoted catalyst was slightly higher due to the enhanced reduction of the GeOx species, which enhanced the formation of a Pt-Ge alloy, decreasing the initial activity of the catalyst. However, this also led to better performance in terms of both activity and selectivity at steady state conditions. Support modification strategies, such as the addition of Ca, can optimize these properties for enhanced catalytic efficiency and selectivity.

The physicochemical properties of catalysts, including chemical qualities such as acid strength and stability, play a crucial role in their performance in dehydrogenation reactions. The Lewis acid site, arising from the unsaturated AlIII site in the Al2O3 structure, is the active site for the catalytic cycle. The amount of Lewis acid sites in Al2O3 is positively linked to the propane conversion rate, indicating their importance in propane dehydrogenation. Morphological characteristics, such as the crystalline structure, also influence catalytic performance. γ-Al2O3 possesses more Lewis acid sites than θ-Al2O3, which contributes to its higher activity. The regenerability of the γ-Al2O3-200 catalyst, which can be restored after deactivation, is an important property for practical applications. Support modification strategies, such as controlling the crystalline structure and increasing the number of Lewis acid sites, can be employed to optimize these properties for enhanced catalytic efficiency and selectivity.

The γ-Al2O3-200 catalyst, with a high level of strong acid sites, shows the highest yield in propane dehydrogenation. The formation of Lewis acid sites in Al2O3 is mainly due to the defective AIII site in the structure. The propane conversion rate is positively linked to the amount of Lewis acid sites in Al2O3, indicating that the Lewis acid sites are the active sites for propane dehydrogenation.

The physicochemical properties of catalysts, including chemical qualities and morphological characteristics, significantly influence their performance in dehydrogenation reactions. The use of a diammonium-type bromide surfactant and a sodium-free silica source in the synthesis procedure leads to the formation of silanol nests in the zeolite, which are confirmed by IR and NMR spectroscopies. These silanol nests play a critical role in the formation of intermetallic alloy nanoparticles, such as Pt3Y, which exhibit high catalytic durability, high propane conversion, and propylene selectivity in propane dehydrogenation. The alloy nanoparticles show fully reversible hydrogen chemisorption behavior at room temperature, unlike monometallic Pt nanoparticles. The nanoparticles are homogeneously distributed throughout the support material, with a size of approximately 2 nm. The EDS analysis confirms that these metal nanoparticles contain both Pt and Y in the same particle, with an average atomic ratio of Pt to Y of approximately 3. The PtY(0.5)/MZ-sf-Br and PtY(0.5)/MZ-sf-OH catalysts show superior catalytic durability compared to PtY(0.5)/MZ-dg. The catalysts supported on silanol nest-containing zeolites have an activation period to reach full conversion. The propane conversion is higher than the equilibrium value during the early reaction period. The TGA profile for the spent PtY(0.5)/MZ-sf-Br catalyst shows that 37 wt% of coke species are deposited on the catalyst sample. The PtY(0.5)/MZ-sf-Br catalyst exhibits slow deactivation over 20 days, while PtY(0.5)/MZ-sf-Br-NaCl is deactivated within 1 day, similar to Pt(0.5)/MZ-sc. Support modification strategies, such as the use of a diammonium-type bromide surfactant and a sodium-free silica source, can optimize the properties of zeolite supports for enhanced catalytic efficiency and selectivity in dehydrogenation reactions.

The physicochemical properties of catalysts, including chemical qualities and morphological characteristics, significantly influence their performance in dehydrogenation reactions. Catalysts synthesized by wet impregnation method, such as CrOx supported on high-silica HZSM-5 with a SiO2/Al2O3 ratio of 260, exhibit high catalytic activity, good selectivity, and excellent stability for PDH. The exploitation of an efficient PDH catalyst based on HZSM-5 zeolite to achieve both high selectivity and stability is still a challenge. In zeolite supported catalysts, zeolite provides a special environment for catalytic reactions, including channel confinement effects, acidic sites, and electron transfer. Acidic sites in zeolites play a key role in determining the catalytic performance of zeolite catalysts in alkane conversion. The role of Cr species and Brnsted acid sites in Cr/HZSM-5 catalysts is elucidated through physicochemical characterizations, PDH tests, and Na+ doping experiments. The structural properties of the prepared CrOx catalysts are detected by N2 sorption technique. The XRD patterns of parent HZSM-5(260) and Cr/Z-5(260) samples are similar, indicating that the Cr loading has little influence on the crystallite structure of HZSM-5 zeolite. The acidity properties of the prepared Cr/Z-5, Cr/SiO2, and Cr/Al2O3 catalysts are detected by NH3-TPD technique. The metal-support interactions between Cr species and HZSM-5 support are measured by XPS spectroscopy. During the PDH tests, the high reaction temperature results in coke formation onto the catalyst, which is the main cause of catalyst deactivation. The interactions between react/product molecules and catalysts are very important in dehydrogenation process. The effect of Cr loading amount and SiO2/Al2O3 ratio on the catalytic performance of Cr/HZSM-5 catalysts is investigated in detail. The role of Cr species and Brnsted acid sites in Cr/HZSM-5 catalysts is elucidated through physicochemical characterizations, PDH tests, and Na+ doping experiments. Characterization results and Na+ doping experiments reveal that the Cr species combined with Brnsted acid sites in Cr/HZSM-5 catalysts are responsible for the high catalytic performance. The Brnsted acid sites in HZSM-5 zeolite increase propane adsorption and enhance CH bond activation. The high surface area and well-defined pores of HZSM-5 zeolite provide a special environment for the dispersion and stabilization of Cr species, ensuring high catalytic activity and stability. The selection of supports for Cr-based catalysts is crucial for PDH. Zeolites, with their high surface area, well-defined channels, good thermal stability, and tunable acidity, can serve as catalysts or supports for various catalytic reactions. The high amounts of acidic sites of HZSM-5 zeolites are negative for PDH reaction, and only HZSM-5 zeolite with suitable acidic sites can be used as a good support for CrOx catalysts for PDH process. The Brnsted acid sites play an important role in determining the catalytic performance of Cr/Z-5 catalyst system. The Brnsted acid sites in HZSM-5(260) play a key role in propane adsorption and activation, affecting their catalytic performance.

The physicochemical properties of catalysts, including chemical qualities and morphological characteristics, significantly influence their performance in dehydrogenation reactions. The crystallization temperature of the support directly affects the catalytic performance of VOx/Al2O3 catalysts by increasing Lewis acid sites and influencing the distribution of different surface V species. P modification can decrease the degree of VOx polymerization, enhancing catalyst stability and activity. Mg modification can improve catalytic performance and anti-coking capability by dispersing V2O5 crystallites and increasing active V3+ species. Gelation and calcination temperatures also impact the catalytic performance of VOx/SiO2 catalysts in terms of propane conversion, propene selectivity, and yield of propene. Dealuminated beta zeolites (Si-beta) are promising catalyst supports due to their high surface area and thermal stability, and the initial propane conversion linearly increases with the amount of acid sites. VOx/ZrO2 is more active than VOx/Al2O3 and pure ZrO2 due to the facile reduction of VO, VOV, and VOZr bonds, producing higher proportions of the active V3+ species. The balance of acid and base sites on the catalyst surface is crucial for all dehydrogenation methods. The development of an active, selective, and stable catalyst is essential for dehydrogenation to be considered a viable process in the future. Support modification strategies can optimize these properties for enhanced catalytic efficiency and selectivity. Using supports with ordered mesoporosity and moderate surface acidity can aid mass transfer and avoid undesirable secondary reactions. Promoting elements can cause beneficial geometric and electronic effects on both the supports and active species. However, environmental and safety concerns exist in the preparation, usage, and disposal of certain catalysts due to their toxicity. Ga catalysts, while less active than Pt and Cr catalysts, have the advantage of being benign and inexpensive. The nature of the support is essential for vanadium-based catalysts, as the metalsupport interactions affect the resultant catalyst performance. The activity is dependent on the bond strength of the VOsupport bond, and catalyst performance is affected by different supports.

The physicochemical properties of catalysts, including chemical qualities (such as acid strength and stability) and morphological characteristics, significantly influence their performance in dehydrogenation reactions. The equilibrium conversion of alkanes increases with temperature, but alkene selectivity decreases due to an increased tendency toward dehydrocyclization/aromatisation, thermal cracking, and coke formation. The extent of PtSn interactions depends on the impregnation sequence of Pt and Sn precursors on the support material. The framework of microporous zeolites exerts dispersive forces on reactant molecules, which depend on the shape, channel, and cavity of the framework. The nature and density of active sites also influence the framework dispersion forces. Recent reports have shown that the strong electrostatic field between protons or exchanged metal ions and basic oxygen species can enhance and/or induce polarization of bonds in hydrocarbon adsorbates. This polarization effect can be viewed as an intermediate condition to hydride abstraction, an important elementary step in CH activation. The polarizing effect increases with increasing charge magnitude and ionic radius of the alkane polarizing cations. The choice of cations should be such that they exhibit no catalytic effects on the target alkene products at the reaction condition. It may be beneficial to create a CH polarization effect on the zeolite framework by appropriate modification of framework atoms. Active sites are usually created on the zeolite frameworks. The active sites of the bimolecular pathway are formed in situ and are made up of an alkyl carbenium ion ionically held to the zeolite framework oxygen ion. The active sites of the unimolecular pathway are the charge balancing protons of the zeolite framework. A proton and a carbenium ion are electrophilic or Lewis acid species, and the two pathways essentially involve electrophilic CH activation. The exchanged metal ions in zeolites are held ionically by one or more basic oxygen atoms. Different species have been suggested, depending on the density of the cation exchange site of the zeolite and the method of introduction of the metals. High alkene selectivities are obtained on the H-ZSM-5 when exchangeable protons are rigorously replaced by Zn and Ga. The CH activation on the OZn2+O site can be described by a Lewis base-assisted deprotonation mechanism, accompanied by conversion of the Lewis base site to a conjugate Bronsted acid site. The OGa+ site, however, activates the CH bond via oxidative addition without a protonic site intermediate. A protonic site intermediate increases the tendency of side reactions on the Zn-exchanged H-ZSM-5 relative to the Ga counterpart. The elementary steps of CH activation on OGa+ reveal that a redox cycle at the metal center is required for catalytic CH activation via the oxidative addition mechanism. However, under alkane dehydrogenation reaction conditions, the OZn2+O sites can undergo a reversible Zn2+/Zn redox process, increasing the availability of undesired protonic site intermediates. Zn-exchanged H-ZSM-5 prepared by conventional ion-exchange methods contain a significant percentage of unexchanged proton sites, leading to lower alkene selectivity of the catalyst. Another strategy to enhance alkene selectivity is by controlling the strength of the proton sites. The acidity of the sites depends on the nature of the trivalent cation of the zeolite framework. Proton sites in borosilicate zeolites are weaker than those of aluminosilicate, and thus higher alkene selectivity is expected for alkane dehydrogenation over Zn/H[B]-ZSM-5 compared to Zn/H[Al]-ZSM-5. However, Zn/H[B]-ZSM-5 shows no activity for propane dehydrogenation. The desired weaker acidity of the proton sites of Zn/H[B]-ZSM-5 requires weaker basicity of the oxygen atoms in the zeolite framework. This reduced basicity of the oxygen atoms is not sufficiently polarizing to complement the exchanged Zn2+ in CH bond cleavage. Elimination of the proton sites of zeolites is critical for obtaining a high alkene selectivity and stability in dehydrogenation catalysts. Pt is the most versatile noble metal catalyst for alkane reactions, often justified by its higher activity, stability, and selectivity for these reactions compared to less expensive alternative transition metals. However, rapid catalyst deactivation due to coke formation remains a challenge even when using a Pt-based catalyst for dehydrogenation of light alkanes. The presence of acid (Bronsted and Lewis) sites on the supports promotes readsorption, oligomerization, and aromatization of alkenes. Promotion of Pt with metals, such as Sn, Ga, Zn, Re, etc., improves catalyst stability, but also leads to faster deactivation rates than Pt/Na[Fe]-ZSM-5. The role of potassium in commercial Cr and Pt-based dehydrogenation catalysts is to minimize the undesired influence of protonic sites on alkene selectivity. The nature and role of surface oxygen species become more evident. The electronic promotion effect of Sn is in line with the oxidative addition CH activation mechanism. However, the Lewis base-assisted deprotonation mechanism could also explain the proposed CH activation on Cr-based catalysts. A recent report suggests that a porous copper-aluminum framework material (stabilized by metal oxide) has better performance (activity/selectivity/stability) for propane dehydrogenation than a PtSn/Al2O3. The Lewis base-assisted deprotonation mechanism may be invoked here, and the redox property of the metal center is likely to play a role in achieving propane dehydrogenation at 350 C. This should constitute the future research direction for non-oxidative dehydrogenation of lower alkanes.

The physicochemical properties of catalysts, including chemical qualities (such as acid strength and stability) and morphological characteristics, significantly influence their performance in dehydrogenation reactions. For instance, the stability of metal oxides or hydride clusters is influenced by the structure of the zeolite framework, and the pore size of zeolites has a slight effect on the catalytic activity, with lower activation barriers for reactions in zeolites with larger pore size. The optimal distance between active sites, such as AlAl distance in zeolites, can be determined to achieve a minimum overall barrier, based on the Sabatier principle. The ultimate goal of theoretical studies is to identify optimal catalysts for specific chemical processes, and the advancements in computational approaches have enabled the exploration of more complex catalytic systems beyond simple transition-metal surfaces. Case studies have provided insights into dehydrogenation mechanisms in these systems, revealing information that is challenging to obtain at the molecular level even with advanced experimental equipment.

The physicochemical properties of catalysts, including chemical qualities and morphological characteristics, significantly influence their performance in dehydrogenation reactions. The geometric and electronic effects are crucial to catalytic systems, particularly in propane dehydrogenation (PDH). The double decoration of PtGa intermetallics with Pb and Ca is a promising catalyst design concept that synergizes the geometric and electronic promotion effects, leading to an ultra-stable catalytic system for PDH. Pb is used for geometric modification to block Pt3 sites, while Ca acts as an electron-donating agent to enrich the electron density of Pt1 sites, suppressing side reactions. This strategy results in a catalyst with outstanding stability in PDH for up to 1 month at 600C.

The literature does not provide specific information on how physicochemical properties of catalysts influence their performance in dehydrogenation reactions or on support modification strategies to optimize these properties. However, it does discuss the influence of support acidity on the electronic properties of supported metals, and how the presence of metals affects the acidic properties of supports. The study shows that the electronic properties of Pt are influenced by the acidity of the support, and the alteration of Pt properties increases with increasing acidity of the support. At the same time, the presence of platinum affects the acidic properties of the supports by reducing the strength of the acid sites. This is observed directly as the changes in desorption of pyridine from the acid sites and indirectly as the suppression of cracking reactions during the ring opening of decalin on the Pt-modified catalysts. This could potentially impact the catalytic efficiency and selectivity in reactions that require both metal and acid active sites.

The physicochemical properties of catalysts, including chemical qualities and morphological characteristics, significantly influence their performance in dehydrogenation reactions. Al2O3, due to its structural advantages and stability, is commonly used as a support in heterogeneous catalysis. The coordinately unsaturated Al3+ sites on the (100) facets of commercial γ-Al2O3 can serve as anchor sites for atomically dispersed Pt and Ru sites. The specific interaction between Ga2O3 and Al2O3 allows the tetrahedral Ga3+ cations to disperse in the spinel-type γ-Ga2O3-Al2O3 solid solution, enhancing activity and stability in PDH reactions. The γ-Al2O3 nanosheet, containing 27% penta-coordinated Al3+ sites, can disperse and stabilize bimetallic PtSn nanoclusters due to strong interactions between metals and support, leading to excellent performance in long-term PDH reactions at ultrahigh space velocities. Hydroxyl groups-eliminated Al2O3 shows high activity of coordinately unsaturated Al3+ as surface active sites in non-oxidative dehydrogenation of isobutane to isobutylene. The diversity and complexity of Al2O3 structure, such as surface acidity at low-coordinated Al sites, determine different properties in propane adsorption, activation, and coke deposition in PDH reactions. A one-step hydrothermal method synthesizes sheet-shaped CoAl2O3HT catalysts for efficient PDH catalysis, benchmarking structural and catalytic stabilities and CoAl2O3 interactions against an impregnated Co/Al2O3-IMP catalyst. The effect of C3H6 desorption behavior in Co-catalyzed PDH reactions is further illustrated. Support modification strategies, such as the use of γ-Al2O3 nanosheets and the specific interaction between Ga2O3 and Al2O3, can optimize these properties for enhanced catalytic efficiency and selectivity.

The acidity of the catalysts was evaluated by NH3-TPD, revealing that parent H-Beta has both weak and strong acid sites, while Si-Beta lacks acid sites after dealumination. The introduction of Pt species results in trace medium acid sites, and Zn species introduce higher amounts of Lewis acid sites. The presence of Pt in 2Zn/Si-Beta leads to an ammonia desorption peak with much higher intensity, indicating strong interaction between Pt and Zn species. Electron microscopy shows that 0.1Pt-2Zn/Si-Beta appears as small aggregates below 100 nm, with Pt and Zn species having close contact on the Si-Beta support. Infrared spectroscopy monitored the evolution of silanol groups after dealumination and metal incorporation, revealing the formation of Pt-Zn species on Si-Beta zeolite. The local electronic environment of Pt is significant for the PDH process and was investigated by FTIR spectra of CO adsorption. XRD patterns show typical diffraction lines for the BEA topology, with a decline in intensity after Zn introduction. Surface areas of zeolite samples were determined by argon adsorption/desorption isotherms, revealing high surface areas and large micropore volumes for all samples, indicating well-preserved microporous structures after dealumination and metal incorporation. The introduction of Pt species via impregnation does not change the dispersion of Zn species on Si-Beta support. The close contact between Pt-Zn species and the electronic interaction thereof make Pt-Zn/Si-Beta robust PDH catalysts.

The physicochemical properties of catalysts, including chemical qualities and morphological characteristics, significantly influence their performance in dehydrogenation reactions. The addition of excess NaCl contributes to the stability of propane dehydrogenation MFI-zeolite catalysts. NaCl promotes the dispersion of Pt, prevents sintering during calcination, and effectively suppresses zeolite acidity. Washing the catalysts after calcination further increases their activity and stability due to the redispersion of water-soluble chlorinated Pt compounds. High external surface acid site concentrations, specific Na/Pt atomic ratios, calcination temperatures, washing with water, and the order of component introduction all contribute to improved Pt dispersion and catalyst stability.

The stability of Pt particles on the surface of supports can be significantly improved by manipulating metal-support interactions. Al2O3 with coordinatively unsaturated pentacoordinate Al3+ sites can stabilize atomically dispersed Pt species by forming Al3+ penta-O-Pt bonds, anchoring Pt particles on the Al2O3 surface. Pt particles can also be tightly stabilized on heteroatoms in the oxide substrate lattice. Small Pt particles stabilized in lattice-confined Sn (IV/II) produce a highly selective and stable Pt-Sn catalyst for propane dehydrogenation. Pt particles confined at the Sn single-site in the zeolite framework exhibit high catalytic performance in propane dehydrogenation, mainly due to the strong interaction between Pt particles and the Sn-zeolite framework. The PtSn bimetallic particles confined in the mesopores of hierarchical ZSM-5 zeolite allow them to become a stable catalyst in propane dehydrogenation at high temperatures. The high efficiency of PtSn/hierarchical ZSM-5 catalysts in propane dehydrogenation is mainly attributed to the confinement of PtSn particles in the mesopores of hierarchical ZSM-5 zeolite.

The physicochemical properties of catalysts, including chemical qualities and morphological characteristics, significantly influence their performance in dehydrogenation reactions. For instance, the coordination saturation of Pt atoms affects the selectivity of propane dehydrogenation, while the unsaturated Pt atoms can catalyze side reactions, leading to carbon deposition. The adsorption configuration and strength of propylene are closely related to the surface structures, which governs the formation of coke. The acidity and coke mobility of the support also play a role in inhibiting coke formation. Various strategies have been proposed to inhibit coke formation, such as geometric separation, electron richness, poisoning acid sites, cofeeding streams, enhancing oxygen mobility, and coke transfer. The textural properties of supports, such as specific surface area, acid-base properties, and thermal stability, have significant influences on the catalytic performance of Pt-based catalysts. To prevent the occurrence of undesirable coke and alkane isomerization on supports, the support acidity should be carefully controlled. Supports with high surface area and uniform pore size distribution are preferred to increase the dispersion of metal particles. Alkaline metals, such as Li, Na, and K, can help poison the strong acid sites and avoid the coke deposition on the Al2O3 surface. Doping Mg into Al2O3 forms a stable spinel phase. Al2O3 nanosheets with abundant penta-coordinate Al atoms have a strong metal-support interaction owing to their capacity for anchoring Pt atoms, which accounts for their high stability. Due to the weak interaction between Pt and SiO2, Pt-based bimetals with high alloying degrees such as PtM intermetallic alloys can be formed by direct H2 pretreatment on SiO2 supports. Comparatively, there exist strong interactions between CeO2 and metal particles, where Pt atoms can be trapped in the form of Pt ions. Additionally, upon using water vapor, the coke deposition could be eliminated accounting for the redox properties of CeO2 under propane dehydrogenation. The adjustable Si/Al ratios and relatively large surface areas can hinder the formation of large hydrocarbon molecules, thus preventing the so-called coke deposits and improving the catalytic stability. Besides, some mesoporous materials, such as SBA-1561 and MCM-41, are often used as the catalyst supports to disperse the active phase with more active sites and less coke deposition. Two-dimensional (2D) early transition metal carbides, i.e., MXenes, due to their well-defined structures and tunable compositions have attracted much attention. Additionally, carbon materials have been widely used for plenty of reactions because of their large surface area, chemical inertness and stability in acidic/basic media. Novel nanostructured carbon materials including carbon nanotubes and graphene as supports have been gradually developed. Obviously, each specific support has its own characteristic and may exhibit a distinctive effect on the catalytic property. It can not only change the selectivity by influencing the component, morphology and distribution of metal particles but also alter the reaction stability by increasing mechanical strength, anti-sintering and anti-coking resistance.

The physicochemical properties of catalysts, including chemical qualities and morphological characteristics, have a significant impact on their performance in dehydrogenation reactions. For example, the surface area-to-metal loading ratio determines the formation of different vanadium species, which affects the catalytic activity. The reducibility of vanadium species also influences the catalytic performance. The addition of MgO can improve the selectivity of vanadium-based catalysts by reducing coke formation. Using silica to dope alumina support can enhance the stability and activity of vanadium oxide catalysts. The type of support and preparation conditions can affect the formation of molybdenum oxide species. Hydrogen reduction can increase conversion but decrease selectivity due to the formation of acid sites. The structure of the support, such as mesoporous GaAl mixed oxide, can increase the resistance to catalyst coking. Poisoning Brnsted acid sites with K can reduce coke formation. Alumina is the most common support, and various methods have been explored to produce chromia-alumina catalysts. The choice of support can also influence the stability and dispersion of the active phase, which in turn affects the catalytic efficiency and selectivity. For example, zirconia has been investigated as an alternative support due to its low surface acidity and enhanced sintering resistance, which can improve the performance of chromia-based catalysts. The acidity of the support can also play a role in catalytic behavior, as demonstrated by the study of porous chromia-pillared α-zirconium phosphate materials. Support modification strategies, such as doping with alkali metals or using mixed oxides, can optimize these properties for enhanced catalytic efficiency and selectivity. For instance, doping with alkali metals can stabilize the structure of the support, reduce surface acidity, and increase the number of active sites. Using mixed oxides can also improve the thermal stability and coking resistance of the catalysts. The surface area-to-metal loading ratio determines the formation of monomeric, polymeric, or crystalline vanadium species on the catalyst. Hydroxyl groups on the support surface are important for anchoring vanadium precursors, while acid sites are detrimental to catalyst performance. Silica doping of alumina support can improve catalyst stability and activity. Addition of MgO can improve dehydrogenation selectivity by reducing coke formation. The reducibility of vanadium species depends on their molecular structure. Molybdenum oxide can exist as monomers, polymers, or crystallites, depending on loading, support, and preparation conditions. Optimal molybdenum oxide activity is achieved with monolayer coverage on alumina. Hydrogen reduction of molybdenum oxide catalyst increases conversion but decreases selectivity. Ga2O3 polymorphs, particularly β-Ga2O3, have high concentration of weak Lewis acid sites for dehydrogenation activity. Coordinatively unsaturated tetrahedral Ga3+ cations are crucial for dehydrogenation activity. High concentration of Lewis acid groups in the form of Ga3+ cations is necessary for dehydrogenation activity. Zeolitic support with low medium and strong acid sites and high weak acid sites leads to most active and stable GaO3/H-ZSM-5 catalyst. Promotion with a base like potassium decreases activity, indicating acidic groups catalyze the reaction. Mesoporous GaAl mixed oxide has increased resistance to coking. Potassium reduces coke formation by poisoning Brnsted acid sites. Platinum acts as a promoter for GaOx, enhancing conversion and selectivity. Platinum assists hydrogen desorption, facilitating regeneration of gallium hydride hydroxide species. The nature of active sites in Ga-based dehydrogenation catalysts is still under debate. Molybdenum oxide can exist as monomers, polymers, or crystallites, depending on loading, support, and preparation conditions. Hydrogen reduction of catalyst increases conversion but decreases selectivity due to acid site formation. The physicochemical properties of catalysts, including chemical qualities and morphological characteristics, significantly influence their performance in dehydrogenation reactions. Alumina is the most common support, and its interaction with the active phase can profoundly impact catalyst activity and selectivity. Noble metals, particularly platinum, are preferred for their superior activation of paraffinic CH bonds and low activity for CC cleavage. The addition of alkaline metals like lithium, sodium, and potassium can poison acid sites on the support, suppressing coke formation. Zirconia is an alternative support that has been investigated, offering low surface acidity and enhanced sintering resistance. Silica requires a high surface area to stabilize Cr6+ sites. Mixed oxides prepared using layered double hydroxide precursors have also been studied for nonoxidative dehydrogenation reactions. The acidity of the support material, such as in chromia-pillared α-zirconium phosphate, can significantly affect catalytic behavior. The physicochemical properties of catalysts, including chemical qualities and morphological characteristics, significantly influence their performance in dehydrogenation reactions. The surface area-to-metal loading ratio determines the formation of different vanadium species, which affects the catalytic activity. The presence of hydroxyl groups on the support surface is crucial for anchoring vanadium precursors, while large V2O5 crystallites are inactive in dehydrogenation. The reducibility of vanadium species depends on their molecular structure, and the reduction of the catalyst by the hydrocarbon feed results in the formation of V4+ and V3+. Initially, deactivation is caused by the strong adsorption of reactants on the active sites and coke deposition. The calcination of the catalyst can remove coke but may further deactivate the catalyst due to the formation of larger V2O5 crystallites or mixed oxides. V2O5 crystallites can revert to active polymeric vanadium species under certain conditions. The addition of CO2 can have a beneficial effect on the catalyst by removing acid sites, facilitating coke gasification, and promoting hydrogen removal. The effect of CO2 depends on the catalyst support, with relatively weak basic sites on activated carbon support facilitating the reverse water gas shift reaction, while strong basic sites on Al2O3 and ZnO2 can be poisoned by CO2. Using silica to dope the alumina support can improve catalyst stability and activity. The addition of MgO can improve the performance of supported vanadium catalysts by reducing coke formation. The physicochemical properties of catalysts, including chemical qualities and morphological characteristics, significantly influence their performance in dehydrogenation reactions. The nature of the support is crucial as it not only determines the mechanical properties of the catalyst but also affects the interaction between the carrier and the active phase, which can profoundly impact catalyst activity and selectivity. For instance, alumina is the most common support, and the method of producing chromia-alumina catalysts can vary, affecting the catalyst's performance. The choice of support can also influence the catalytic activity, with different supports leading to varying orders of activity based on conversion and yield. Zirconia, as an alternative support, has been investigated for its low surface acidity and enhanced sintering resistance. Silica requires a high surface area to stabilize Cr6+ sites, and mixed oxides prepared using layered double hydroxide precursors have been studied for their catalytic properties in dehydrogenation reactions. The acidity of the support, as seen in chromia-pillared α-zirconium phosphate materials, can also influence catalytic behavior, with strong acid sites affecting cracking reactions and medium strength acid sites impacting dehydrogenation reactions. Support modification strategies can be employed to optimize the properties of catalysts for enhanced catalytic efficiency and selectivity. For example, doping alumina-based dehydrogenation catalysts with alkali ions can effectively poison undesirable acid sites, improving selectivity. Using zirconia as a support can prevent the formation of mixed oxides and offer higher thermal stability and surface area. Silica, with its high surface area, can stabilize Cr6+ sites, while mixed oxides prepared using layered double hydroxide precursors can provide improved coking resistance and thermal stability against sintering. Understanding the role of acidity in catalytic behavior can also guide the modification of supports to favor dehydrogenation reactions over cracking reactions. The physicochemical properties of catalysts, including chemical qualities and morphological characteristics, significantly influence their performance in dehydrogenation reactions. For instance, the nature of the support material, such as alumina, zirconia, or silica, can affect the dispersion and stability of the active phase, thereby impacting the catalytic activity and selectivity. The interaction between the support and the active phase can also alter the electronic properties of the catalyst, which can further enhance its performance. Support modification strategies, such as doping with alkali metals or using mixed oxides, can optimize these properties for enhanced catalytic efficiency and selectivity. For example, doping with alkali metals can reduce surface acidity and increase the number of active sites, while using mixed oxides can improve thermal stability and coking resistance.

The physicochemical properties of catalysts, including chemical qualities such as acid strength and stability, and morphological characteristics, significantly influence their performance in dehydrogenation reactions. The stability and tolerance to carbon deposits of Zr-Al-Beta promoted by alkali-metal ions were demonstrated. The modification of alkali-metal ions on both Lewis acid sites and Brnsted acid sites in Zr-Al-Beta was evidenced by XPS and FT-IR spectroscopy. The untreated materials displayed poor product selectivity and high coke deposit in the Meerwein-Ponndorf-Verley reduction of furfural and isopropanol; however, the treatment of alkali-metal ions promoted their catalytic performance with improved recalcitrance to deactivation and coking significantly. The type of alkali-metal ions and the concentration of alkaline solution influenced the catalytic performance, which were found to correlate to the acidity and textual properties. The optimum reaction result (97.3% yield of furfuryl alcohol at 99.6% conversion of furfural) can be obtained on 0.025 M-Na+-Zr-Al-Beta with high tolerance to the furfural concentration. Support modification strategies can be employed to optimize these properties for enhanced catalytic efficiency and selectivity by tuning and normalizing the various acidic sites of zeolites. For instance, the post-synthetic method is demonstrated to be preferential to form open sites, which have stronger Lewis acidic properties than the closed sites. The simple post-synthetic strategy to prepare a Zr-Al-Beta zeolite with both plentiful Lewis acid open Zr (IV) sites and Brnsted acid sites has shown a superior catalytic activity, water-tolerance ability, and reusability in the cascade conversion of cinnamaldehyde toward 1-cinnamyl 2-propyl ether. The controllable tuning for the acid properties with various active sites is greatly required to promote some of the chemical transformations and avoid the possibility of other undesired reaction pathways except for the aimed reaction route, such as dehydration, polymerization, and isomerization.

The physicochemical properties of catalysts, including chemical qualities and morphological characteristics, significantly impact their performance in dehydrogenation reactions. Chemical qualities, such as acid strength and stability, affect the selectivity toward the targeted alkene, while morphological and porous qualities influence the diffusion efficiency. Support modification strategies, summarized in Table 3, can optimize these properties for enhanced catalytic efficiency and selectivity. Proper acidity of the support is crucial for CH activation and propylene desorption in PDH reactions, while excessive acidity can lead to negative impacts such as CC cracking and deep dehydrogenation. For zeolites, Lewis acid sites are preferred for propane dehydrogenation, whereas Brnsted acid sites catalyze cleavage reactions. The diffusion efficiency of reactants and products in heterogeneous catalysts is determined by the morphology, structure, size, and chemical properties of the supports. Strategies to enhance catalytic efficiency include developing nanosized supports and synthesizing supports with specific morphologies and high external surfaces.

The physicochemical properties of catalysts, including chemical qualities and morphological characteristics, significantly influence their performance in dehydrogenation reactions. The decrease of acid centers of Al2O3 and the increase of the degree of alloy formation upon addition of Ca lead to enhanced propylene selectivity and catalyst stability. The deactivation model with residual activity (DMRA) was used to fit the experimental data of propane conversion vs. time, which allowed for the calculation of the intrinsic deactivation kinetic parameters for both catalysts. The Ca-promoted catalyst showed a lower deactivation function and higher residual activity, indicating better resistance against deactivation by coke. The activation energy of the PDH reaction for the Ca-promoted catalyst was slightly higher due to the enhanced reduction of the GeOx species, which enhanced the formation of a Pt-Ge alloy, decreasing the initial activity of the catalyst. However, this also led to better performance in terms of both activity and selectivity at steady state conditions. Support modification strategies, such as the addition of Ca, can optimize these properties for enhanced catalytic efficiency and selectivity.

The physicochemical properties of catalysts, including chemical qualities such as acid strength and stability, play a crucial role in their performance in dehydrogenation reactions. The Lewis acid site, arising from the unsaturated AlIII site in the Al2O3 structure, is the active site for the catalytic cycle. The amount of Lewis acid sites in Al2O3 is positively linked to the propane conversion rate, indicating their importance in propane dehydrogenation. Morphological characteristics, such as the crystalline structure, also influence catalytic performance. γ-Al2O3 possesses more Lewis acid sites than θ-Al2O3, which contributes to its higher activity. The regenerability of the γ-Al2O3-200 catalyst, which can be restored after deactivation, is an important property for practical applications. Support modification strategies, such as controlling the crystalline structure and increasing the number of Lewis acid sites, can be employed to optimize these properties for enhanced catalytic efficiency and selectivity.

The γ-Al2O3-200 catalyst, with a high level of strong acid sites, shows the highest yield in propane dehydrogenation. The formation of Lewis acid sites in Al2O3 is mainly due to the defective AIII site in the structure. The propane conversion rate is positively linked to the amount of Lewis acid sites in Al2O3, indicating that the Lewis acid sites are the active sites for propane dehydrogenation.

The physicochemical properties of catalysts, including chemical qualities and morphological characteristics, significantly influence their performance in dehydrogenation reactions. The use of a diammonium-type bromide surfactant and a sodium-free silica source in the synthesis procedure leads to the formation of silanol nests in the zeolite, which are confirmed by IR and NMR spectroscopies. These silanol nests play a critical role in the formation of intermetallic alloy nanoparticles, such as Pt3Y, which exhibit high catalytic durability, high propane conversion, and propylene selectivity in propane dehydrogenation. The alloy nanoparticles show fully reversible hydrogen chemisorption behavior at room temperature, unlike monometallic Pt nanoparticles. The nanoparticles are homogeneously distributed throughout the support material, with a size of approximately 2 nm. The EDS analysis confirms that these metal nanoparticles contain both Pt and Y in the same particle, with an average atomic ratio of Pt to Y of approximately 3. The PtY(0.5)/MZ-sf-Br and PtY(0.5)/MZ-sf-OH catalysts show superior catalytic durability compared to PtY(0.5)/MZ-dg. The catalysts supported on silanol nest-containing zeolites have an activation period to reach full conversion. The propane conversion is higher than the equilibrium value during the early reaction period. The TGA profile for the spent PtY(0.5)/MZ-sf-Br catalyst shows that 37 wt% of coke species are deposited on the catalyst sample. The PtY(0.5)/MZ-sf-Br catalyst exhibits slow deactivation over 20 days, while PtY(0.5)/MZ-sf-Br-NaCl is deactivated within 1 day, similar to Pt(0.5)/MZ-sc. Support modification strategies, such as the use of a diammonium-type bromide surfactant and a sodium-free silica source, can optimize the properties of zeolite supports for enhanced catalytic efficiency and selectivity in dehydrogenation reactions.

The physicochemical properties of catalysts, including chemical qualities and morphological characteristics, significantly influence their performance in dehydrogenation reactions. Catalysts synthesized by wet impregnation method, such as CrOx supported on high-silica HZSM-5 with a SiO2/Al2O3 ratio of 260, exhibit high catalytic activity, good selectivity, and excellent stability for PDH. The exploitation of an efficient PDH catalyst based on HZSM-5 zeolite to achieve both high selectivity and stability is still a challenge. In zeolite supported catalysts, zeolite provides a special environment for catalytic reactions, including channel confinement effects, acidic sites, and electron transfer. Acidic sites in zeolites play a key role in determining the catalytic performance of zeolite catalysts in alkane conversion. The role of Cr species and Brnsted acid sites in Cr/HZSM-5 catalysts is elucidated through physicochemical characterizations, PDH tests, and Na+ doping experiments. The structural properties of the prepared CrOx catalysts are detected by N2 sorption technique. The XRD patterns of parent HZSM-5(260) and Cr/Z-5(260) samples are similar, indicating that the Cr loading has little influence on the crystallite structure of HZSM-5 zeolite. The acidity properties of the prepared Cr/Z-5, Cr/SiO2, and Cr/Al2O3 catalysts are detected by NH3-TPD technique. The metal-support interactions between Cr species and HZSM-5 support are measured by XPS spectroscopy. During the PDH tests, the high reaction temperature results in coke formation onto the catalyst, which is the main cause of catalyst deactivation. The interactions between react/product molecules and catalysts are very important in dehydrogenation process. The effect of Cr loading amount and SiO2/Al2O3 ratio on the catalytic performance of Cr/HZSM-5 catalysts is investigated in detail. The role of Cr species and Brnsted acid sites in Cr/HZSM-5 catalysts is elucidated through physicochemical characterizations, PDH tests, and Na+ doping experiments. Characterization results and Na+ doping experiments reveal that the Cr species combined with Brnsted acid sites in Cr/HZSM-5 catalysts are responsible for the high catalytic performance. The Brnsted acid sites in HZSM-5 zeolite increase propane adsorption and enhance CH bond activation. The high surface area and well-defined pores of HZSM-5 zeolite provide a special environment for the dispersion and stabilization of Cr species, ensuring high catalytic activity and stability. The selection of supports for Cr-based catalysts is crucial for PDH. Zeolites, with their high surface area, well-defined channels, good thermal stability, and tunable acidity, can serve as catalysts or supports for various catalytic reactions. The high amounts of acidic sites of HZSM-5 zeolites are negative for PDH reaction, and only HZSM-5 zeolite with suitable acidic sites can be used as a good support for CrOx catalysts for PDH process. The Brnsted acid sites play an important role in determining the catalytic performance of Cr/Z-5 catalyst system. The Brnsted acid sites in HZSM-5(260) play a key role in propane adsorption and activation, affecting their catalytic performance.

The physicochemical properties of catalysts, including chemical qualities and morphological characteristics, significantly influence their performance in dehydrogenation reactions. The crystallization temperature of the support directly affects the catalytic performance of VOx/Al2O3 catalysts by increasing Lewis acid sites and influencing the distribution of different surface V species. P modification can decrease the degree of VOx polymerization, enhancing catalyst stability and activity. Mg modification can improve catalytic performance and anti-coking capability by dispersing V2O5 crystallites and increasing active V3+ species. Gelation and calcination temperatures also impact the catalytic performance of VOx/SiO2 catalysts in terms of propane conversion, propene selectivity, and yield of propene. Dealuminated beta zeolites (Si-beta) are promising catalyst supports due to their high surface area and thermal stability, and the initial propane conversion linearly increases with the amount of acid sites. VOx/ZrO2 is more active than VOx/Al2O3 and pure ZrO2 due to the facile reduction of VO, VOV, and VOZr bonds, producing higher proportions of the active V3+ species. The balance of acid and base sites on the catalyst surface is crucial for all dehydrogenation methods. The development of an active, selective, and stable catalyst is essential for dehydrogenation to be considered a viable process in the future. Support modification strategies can optimize these properties for enhanced catalytic efficiency and selectivity. Using supports with ordered mesoporosity and moderate surface acidity can aid mass transfer and avoid undesirable secondary reactions. Promoting elements can cause beneficial geometric and electronic effects on both the supports and active species. However, environmental and safety concerns exist in the preparation, usage, and disposal of certain catalysts due to their toxicity. Ga catalysts, while less active than Pt and Cr catalysts, have the advantage of being benign and inexpensive. The nature of the support is essential for vanadium-based catalysts, as the metalsupport interactions affect the resultant catalyst performance. The activity is dependent on the bond strength of the VOsupport bond, and catalyst performance is affected by different supports.

The physicochemical properties of catalysts, including chemical qualities (such as acid strength and stability) and morphological characteristics, significantly influence their performance in dehydrogenation reactions. The equilibrium conversion of alkanes increases with temperature, but alkene selectivity decreases due to an increased tendency toward dehydrocyclization/aromatisation, thermal cracking, and coke formation. The extent of PtSn interactions depends on the impregnation sequence of Pt and Sn precursors on the support material. The framework of microporous zeolites exerts dispersive forces on reactant molecules, which depend on the shape, channel, and cavity of the framework. The nature and density of active sites also influence the framework dispersion forces. Recent reports have shown that the strong electrostatic field between protons or exchanged metal ions and basic oxygen species can enhance and/or induce polarization of bonds in hydrocarbon adsorbates. This polarization effect can be viewed as an intermediate condition to hydride abstraction, an important elementary step in CH activation. The polarizing effect increases with increasing charge magnitude and ionic radius of the alkane polarizing cations. The choice of cations should be such that they exhibit no catalytic effects on the target alkene products at the reaction condition. It may be beneficial to create a CH polarization effect on the zeolite framework by appropriate modification of framework atoms. Active sites are usually created on the zeolite frameworks. The active sites of the bimolecular pathway are formed in situ and are made up of an alkyl carbenium ion ionically held to the zeolite framework oxygen ion. The active sites of the unimolecular pathway are the charge balancing protons of the zeolite framework. A proton and a carbenium ion are electrophilic or Lewis acid species, and the two pathways essentially involve electrophilic CH activation. The exchanged metal ions in zeolites are held ionically by one or more basic oxygen atoms. Different species have been suggested, depending on the density of the cation exchange site of the zeolite and the method of introduction of the metals. High alkene selectivities are obtained on the H-ZSM-5 when exchangeable protons are rigorously replaced by Zn and Ga. The CH activation on the OZn2+O site can be described by a Lewis base-assisted deprotonation mechanism, accompanied by conversion of the Lewis base site to a conjugate Bronsted acid site. The OGa+ site, however, activates the CH bond via oxidative addition without a protonic site intermediate. A protonic site intermediate increases the tendency of side reactions on the Zn-exchanged H-ZSM-5 relative to the Ga counterpart. The elementary steps of CH activation on OGa+ reveal that a redox cycle at the metal center is required for catalytic CH activation via the oxidative addition mechanism. However, under alkane dehydrogenation reaction conditions, the OZn2+O sites can undergo a reversible Zn2+/Zn redox process, increasing the availability of undesired protonic site intermediates. Zn-exchanged H-ZSM-5 prepared by conventional ion-exchange methods contain a significant percentage of unexchanged proton sites, leading to lower alkene selectivity of the catalyst. Another strategy to enhance alkene selectivity is by controlling the strength of the proton sites. The acidity of the sites depends on the nature of the trivalent cation of the zeolite framework. Proton sites in borosilicate zeolites are weaker than those of aluminosilicate, and thus higher alkene selectivity is expected for alkane dehydrogenation over Zn/H[B]-ZSM-5 compared to Zn/H[Al]-ZSM-5. However, Zn/H[B]-ZSM-5 shows no activity for propane dehydrogenation. The desired weaker acidity of the proton sites of Zn/H[B]-ZSM-5 requires weaker basicity of the oxygen atoms in the zeolite framework. This reduced basicity of the oxygen atoms is not sufficiently polarizing to complement the exchanged Zn2+ in CH bond cleavage. Elimination of the proton sites of zeolites is critical for obtaining a high alkene selectivity and stability in dehydrogenation catalysts. Pt is the most versatile noble metal catalyst for alkane reactions, often justified by its higher activity, stability, and selectivity for these reactions compared to less expensive alternative transition metals. However, rapid catalyst deactivation due to coke formation remains a challenge even when using a Pt-based catalyst for dehydrogenation of light alkanes. The presence of acid (Bronsted and Lewis) sites on the supports promotes readsorption, oligomerization, and aromatization of alkenes. Promotion of Pt with metals, such as Sn, Ga, Zn, Re, etc., improves catalyst stability, but also leads to faster deactivation rates than Pt/Na[Fe]-ZSM-5. The role of potassium in commercial Cr and Pt-based dehydrogenation catalysts is to minimize the undesired influence of protonic sites on alkene selectivity. The nature and role of surface oxygen species become more evident. The electronic promotion effect of Sn is in line with the oxidative addition CH activation mechanism. However, the Lewis base-assisted deprotonation mechanism could also explain the proposed CH activation on Cr-based catalysts. A recent report suggests that a porous copper-aluminum framework material (stabilized by metal oxide) has better performance (activity/selectivity/stability) for propane dehydrogenation than a PtSn/Al2O3. The Lewis base-assisted deprotonation mechanism may be invoked here, and the redox property of the metal center is likely to play a role in achieving propane dehydrogenation at 350 C. This should constitute the future research direction for non-oxidative dehydrogenation of lower alkanes.

The physicochemical properties of catalysts, including chemical qualities (such as acid strength and stability) and morphological characteristics, significantly influence their performance in dehydrogenation reactions. For instance, the stability of metal oxides or hydride clusters is influenced by the structure of the zeolite framework, and the pore size of zeolites has a slight effect on the catalytic activity, with lower activation barriers for reactions in zeolites with larger pore size. The optimal distance between active sites, such as AlAl distance in zeolites, can be determined to achieve a minimum overall barrier, based on the Sabatier principle. The ultimate goal of theoretical studies is to identify optimal catalysts for specific chemical processes, and the advancements in computational approaches have enabled the exploration of more complex catalytic systems beyond simple transition-metal surfaces. Case studies have provided insights into dehydrogenation mechanisms in these systems, revealing information that is challenging to obtain at the molecular level even with advanced experimental equipment.

The physicochemical properties of catalysts, including chemical qualities and morphological characteristics, significantly influence their performance in dehydrogenation reactions. The geometric and electronic effects are crucial to catalytic systems, particularly in propane dehydrogenation (PDH). The double decoration of PtGa intermetallics with Pb and Ca is a promising catalyst design concept that synergizes the geometric and electronic promotion effects, leading to an ultra-stable catalytic system for PDH. Pb is used for geometric modification to block Pt3 sites, while Ca acts as an electron-donating agent to enrich the electron density of Pt1 sites, suppressing side reactions. This strategy results in a catalyst with outstanding stability in PDH for up to 1 month at 600C.

The literature does not provide specific information on how physicochemical properties of catalysts influence their performance in dehydrogenation reactions or on support modification strategies to optimize these properties. However, it does discuss the influence of support acidity on the electronic properties of supported metals, and how the presence of metals affects the acidic properties of supports. The study shows that the electronic properties of Pt are influenced by the acidity of the support, and the alteration of Pt properties increases with increasing acidity of the support. At the same time, the presence of platinum affects the acidic properties of the supports by reducing the strength of the acid sites. This is observed directly as the changes in desorption of pyridine from the acid sites and indirectly as the suppression of cracking reactions during the ring opening of decalin on the Pt-modified catalysts. This could potentially impact the catalytic efficiency and selectivity in reactions that require both metal and acid active sites.

The physicochemical properties of catalysts, including chemical qualities and morphological characteristics, significantly influence their performance in dehydrogenation reactions. Al2O3, due to its structural advantages and stability, is commonly used as a support in heterogeneous catalysis. The coordinately unsaturated Al3+ sites on the (100) facets of commercial γ-Al2O3 can serve as anchor sites for atomically dispersed Pt and Ru sites. The specific interaction between Ga2O3 and Al2O3 allows the tetrahedral Ga3+ cations to disperse in the spinel-type γ-Ga2O3-Al2O3 solid solution, enhancing activity and stability in PDH reactions. The γ-Al2O3 nanosheet, containing 27% penta-coordinated Al3+ sites, can disperse and stabilize bimetallic PtSn nanoclusters due to strong interactions between metals and support, leading to excellent performance in long-term PDH reactions at ultrahigh space velocities. Hydroxyl groups-eliminated Al2O3 shows high activity of coordinately unsaturated Al3+ as surface active sites in non-oxidative dehydrogenation of isobutane to isobutylene. The diversity and complexity of Al2O3 structure, such as surface acidity at low-coordinated Al sites, determine different properties in propane adsorption, activation, and coke deposition in PDH reactions. A one-step hydrothermal method synthesizes sheet-shaped CoAl2O3HT catalysts for efficient PDH catalysis, benchmarking structural and catalytic stabilities and CoAl2O3 interactions against an impregnated Co/Al2O3-IMP catalyst. The effect of C3H6 desorption behavior in Co-catalyzed PDH reactions is further illustrated. Support modification strategies, such as the use of γ-Al2O3 nanosheets and the specific interaction between Ga2O3 and Al2O3, can optimize these properties for enhanced catalytic efficiency and selectivity.

The acidity of the catalysts was evaluated by NH3-TPD, revealing that parent H-Beta has both weak and strong acid sites, while Si-Beta lacks acid sites after dealumination. The introduction of Pt species results in trace medium acid sites, and Zn species introduce higher amounts of Lewis acid sites. The presence of Pt in 2Zn/Si-Beta leads to an ammonia desorption peak with much higher intensity, indicating strong interaction between Pt and Zn species. Electron microscopy shows that 0.1Pt-2Zn/Si-Beta appears as small aggregates below 100 nm, with Pt and Zn species having close contact on the Si-Beta support. Infrared spectroscopy monitored the evolution of silanol groups after dealumination and metal incorporation, revealing the formation of Pt-Zn species on Si-Beta zeolite. The local electronic environment of Pt is significant for the PDH process and was investigated by FTIR spectra of CO adsorption. XRD patterns show typical diffraction lines for the BEA topology, with a decline in intensity after Zn introduction. Surface areas of zeolite samples were determined by argon adsorption/desorption isotherms, revealing high surface areas and large micropore volumes for all samples, indicating well-preserved microporous structures after dealumination and metal incorporation. The introduction of Pt species via impregnation does not change the dispersion of Zn species on Si-Beta support. The close contact between Pt-Zn species and the electronic interaction thereof make Pt-Zn/Si-Beta robust PDH catalysts.

The physicochemical properties of catalysts, including chemical qualities and morphological characteristics, significantly influence their performance in dehydrogenation reactions. The addition of excess NaCl contributes to the stability of propane dehydrogenation MFI-zeolite catalysts. NaCl promotes the dispersion of Pt, prevents sintering during calcination, and effectively suppresses zeolite acidity. Washing the catalysts after calcination further increases their activity and stability due to the redispersion of water-soluble chlorinated Pt compounds. High external surface acid site concentrations, specific Na/Pt atomic ratios, calcination temperatures, washing with water, and the order of component introduction all contribute to improved Pt dispersion and catalyst stability.

The stability of Pt particles on the surface of supports can be significantly improved by manipulating metal-support interactions. Al2O3 with coordinatively unsaturated pentacoordinate Al3+ sites can stabilize atomically dispersed Pt species by forming Al3+ penta-O-Pt bonds, anchoring Pt particles on the Al2O3 surface. Pt particles can also be tightly stabilized on heteroatoms in the oxide substrate lattice. Small Pt particles stabilized in lattice-confined Sn (IV/II) produce a highly selective and stable Pt-Sn catalyst for propane dehydrogenation. Pt particles confined at the Sn single-site in the zeolite framework exhibit high catalytic performance in propane dehydrogenation, mainly due to the strong interaction between Pt particles and the Sn-zeolite framework. The PtSn bimetallic particles confined in the mesopores of hierarchical ZSM-5 zeolite allow them to become a stable catalyst in propane dehydrogenation at high temperatures. The high efficiency of PtSn/hierarchical ZSM-5 catalysts in propane dehydrogenation is mainly attributed to the confinement of PtSn particles in the mesopores of hierarchical ZSM-5 zeolite.

The physicochemical properties of catalysts, including chemical qualities and morphological characteristics, significantly influence their performance in dehydrogenation reactions. For instance, the coordination saturation of Pt atoms affects the selectivity of propane dehydrogenation, while the unsaturated Pt atoms can catalyze side reactions, leading to carbon deposition. The adsorption configuration and strength of propylene are closely related to the surface structures, which governs the formation of coke. The acidity and coke mobility of the support also play a role in inhibiting coke formation. Various strategies have been proposed to inhibit coke formation, such as geometric separation, electron richness, poisoning acid sites, cofeeding streams, enhancing oxygen mobility, and coke transfer. The textural properties of supports, such as specific surface area, acid-base properties, and thermal stability, have significant influences on the catalytic performance of Pt-based catalysts. To prevent the occurrence of undesirable coke and alkane isomerization on supports, the support acidity should be carefully controlled. Supports with high surface area and uniform pore size distribution are preferred to increase the dispersion of metal particles. Alkaline metals, such as Li, Na, and K, can help poison the strong acid sites and avoid the coke deposition on the Al2O3 surface. Doping Mg into Al2O3 forms a stable spinel phase. Al2O3 nanosheets with abundant penta-coordinate Al atoms have a strong metal-support interaction owing to their capacity for anchoring Pt atoms, which accounts for their high stability. Due to the weak interaction between Pt and SiO2, Pt-based bimetals with high alloying degrees such as PtM intermetallic alloys can be formed by direct H2 pretreatment on SiO2 supports. Comparatively, there exist strong interactions between CeO2 and metal particles, where Pt atoms can be trapped in the form of Pt ions. Additionally, upon using water vapor, the coke deposition could be eliminated accounting for the redox properties of CeO2 under propane dehydrogenation. The adjustable Si/Al ratios and relatively large surface areas can hinder the formation of large hydrocarbon molecules, thus preventing the so-called coke deposits and improving the catalytic stability. Besides, some mesoporous materials, such as SBA-1561 and MCM-41, are often used as the catalyst supports to disperse the active phase with more active sites and less coke deposition. Two-dimensional (2D) early transition metal carbides, i.e., MXenes, due to their well-defined structures and tunable compositions have attracted much attention. Additionally, carbon materials have been widely used for plenty of reactions because of their large surface area, chemical inertness and stability in acidic/basic media. Novel nanostructured carbon materials including carbon nanotubes and graphene as supports have been gradually developed. Obviously, each specific support has its own characteristic and may exhibit a distinctive effect on the catalytic property. It can not only change the selectivity by influencing the component, morphology and distribution of metal particles but also alter the reaction stability by increasing mechanical strength, anti-sintering and anti-coking resistance.

The physicochemical properties of catalysts, including chemical qualities and morphological characteristics, have a significant impact on their performance in dehydrogenation reactions. For example, the surface area-to-metal loading ratio determines the formation of different vanadium species, which affects the catalytic activity. The reducibility of vanadium species also influences the catalytic performance. The addition of MgO can improve the selectivity of vanadium-based catalysts by reducing coke formation. Using silica to dope alumina support can enhance the stability and activity of vanadium oxide catalysts. The type of support and preparation conditions can affect the formation of molybdenum oxide species. Hydrogen reduction can increase conversion but decrease selectivity due to the formation of acid sites. The structure of the support, such as mesoporous GaAl mixed oxide, can increase the resistance to catalyst coking. Poisoning Brnsted acid sites with K can reduce coke formation. Alumina is the most common support, and various methods have been explored to produce chromia-alumina catalysts. The choice of support can also influence the stability and dispersion of the active phase, which in turn affects the catalytic efficiency and selectivity. For example, zirconia has been investigated as an alternative support due to its low surface acidity and enhanced sintering resistance, which can improve the performance of chromia-based catalysts. The acidity of the support can also play a role in catalytic behavior, as demonstrated by the study of porous chromia-pillared α-zirconium phosphate materials. Support modification strategies, such as doping with alkali metals or using mixed oxides, can optimize these properties for enhanced catalytic efficiency and selectivity. For instance, doping with alkali metals can stabilize the structure of the support, reduce surface acidity, and increase the number of active sites. Using mixed oxides can also improve the thermal stability and coking resistance of the catalysts. The surface area-to-metal loading ratio determines the formation of monomeric, polymeric, or crystalline vanadium species on the catalyst. Hydroxyl groups on the support surface are important for anchoring vanadium precursors, while acid sites are detrimental to catalyst performance. Silica doping of alumina support can improve catalyst stability and activity. Addition of MgO can improve dehydrogenation selectivity by reducing coke formation. The reducibility of vanadium species depends on their molecular structure. Molybdenum oxide can exist as monomers, polymers, or crystallites, depending on loading, support, and preparation conditions. Optimal molybdenum oxide activity is achieved with monolayer coverage on alumina. Hydrogen reduction of molybdenum oxide catalyst increases conversion but decreases selectivity. Ga2O3 polymorphs, particularly β-Ga2O3, have high concentration of weak Lewis acid sites for dehydrogenation activity. Coordinatively unsaturated tetrahedral Ga3+ cations are crucial for dehydrogenation activity. High concentration of Lewis acid groups in the form of Ga3+ cations is necessary for dehydrogenation activity. Zeolitic support with low medium and strong acid sites and high weak acid sites leads to most active and stable GaO3/H-ZSM-5 catalyst. Promotion with a base like potassium decreases activity, indicating acidic groups catalyze the reaction. Mesoporous GaAl mixed oxide has increased resistance to coking. Potassium reduces coke formation by poisoning Brnsted acid sites. Platinum acts as a promoter for GaOx, enhancing conversion and selectivity. Platinum assists hydrogen desorption, facilitating regeneration of gallium hydride hydroxide species. The nature of active sites in Ga-based dehydrogenation catalysts is still under debate. Molybdenum oxide can exist as monomers, polymers, or crystallites, depending on loading, support, and preparation conditions. Hydrogen reduction of catalyst increases conversion but decreases selectivity due to acid site formation. The physicochemical properties of catalysts, including chemical qualities and morphological characteristics, significantly influence their performance in dehydrogenation reactions. Alumina is the most common support, and its interaction with the active phase can profoundly impact catalyst activity and selectivity. Noble metals, particularly platinum, are preferred for their superior activation of paraffinic CH bonds and low activity for CC cleavage. The addition of alkaline metals like lithium, sodium, and potassium can poison acid sites on the support, suppressing coke formation. Zirconia is an alternative support that has been investigated, offering low surface acidity and enhanced sintering resistance. Silica requires a high surface area to stabilize Cr6+ sites. Mixed oxides prepared using layered double hydroxide precursors have also been studied for nonoxidative dehydrogenation reactions. The acidity of the support material, such as in chromia-pillared α-zirconium phosphate, can significantly affect catalytic behavior. The physicochemical properties of catalysts, including chemical qualities and morphological characteristics, significantly influence their performance in dehydrogenation reactions. The surface area-to-metal loading ratio determines the formation of different vanadium species, which affects the catalytic activity. The presence of hydroxyl groups on the support surface is crucial for anchoring vanadium precursors, while large V2O5 crystallites are inactive in dehydrogenation. The reducibility of vanadium species depends on their molecular structure, and the reduction of the catalyst by the hydrocarbon feed results in the formation of V4+ and V3+. Initially, deactivation is caused by the strong adsorption of reactants on the active sites and coke deposition. The calcination of the catalyst can remove coke but may further deactivate the catalyst due to the formation of larger V2O5 crystallites or mixed oxides. V2O5 crystallites can revert to active polymeric vanadium species under certain conditions. The addition of CO2 can have a beneficial effect on the catalyst by removing acid sites, facilitating coke gasification, and promoting hydrogen removal. The effect of CO2 depends on the catalyst support, with relatively weak basic sites on activated carbon support facilitating the reverse water gas shift reaction, while strong basic sites on Al2O3 and ZnO2 can be poisoned by CO2. Using silica to dope the alumina support can improve catalyst stability and activity. The addition of MgO can improve the performance of supported vanadium catalysts by reducing coke formation. The physicochemical properties of catalysts, including chemical qualities and morphological characteristics, significantly influence their performance in dehydrogenation reactions. The nature of the support is crucial as it not only determines the mechanical properties of the catalyst but also affects the interaction between the carrier and the active phase, which can profoundly impact catalyst activity and selectivity. For instance, alumina is the most common support, and the method of producing chromia-alumina catalysts can vary, affecting the catalyst's performance. The choice of support can also influence the catalytic activity, with different supports leading to varying orders of activity based on conversion and yield. Zirconia, as an alternative support, has been investigated for its low surface acidity and enhanced sintering resistance. Silica requires a high surface area to stabilize Cr6+ sites, and mixed oxides prepared using layered double hydroxide precursors have been studied for their catalytic properties in dehydrogenation reactions. The acidity of the support, as seen in chromia-pillared α-zirconium phosphate materials, can also influence catalytic behavior, with strong acid sites affecting cracking reactions and medium strength acid sites impacting dehydrogenation reactions. Support modification strategies can be employed to optimize the properties of catalysts for enhanced catalytic efficiency and selectivity. For example, doping alumina-based dehydrogenation catalysts with alkali ions can effectively poison undesirable acid sites, improving selectivity. Using zirconia as a support can prevent the formation of mixed oxides and offer higher thermal stability and surface area. Silica, with its high surface area, can stabilize Cr6+ sites, while mixed oxides prepared using layered double hydroxide precursors can provide improved coking resistance and thermal stability against sintering. Understanding the role of acidity in catalytic behavior can also guide the modification of supports to favor dehydrogenation reactions over cracking reactions. The physicochemical properties of catalysts, including chemical qualities and morphological characteristics, significantly influence their performance in dehydrogenation reactions. For instance, the nature of the support material, such as alumina, zirconia, or silica, can affect the dispersion and stability of the active phase, thereby impacting the catalytic activity and selectivity. The interaction between the support and the active phase can also alter the electronic properties of the catalyst, which can further enhance its performance. Support modification strategies, such as doping with alkali metals or using mixed oxides, can optimize these properties for enhanced catalytic efficiency and selectivity. For example, doping with alkali metals can reduce surface acidity and increase the number of active sites, while using mixed oxides can improve thermal stability and coking resistance.

The physicochemical properties of catalysts, including chemical qualities such as acid strength and stability, and morphological characteristics, significantly influence their performance in dehydrogenation reactions. The stability and tolerance to carbon deposits of Zr-Al-Beta promoted by alkali-metal ions were demonstrated. The modification of alkali-metal ions on both Lewis acid sites and Brnsted acid sites in Zr-Al-Beta was evidenced by XPS and FT-IR spectroscopy. The untreated materials displayed poor product selectivity and high coke deposit in the Meerwein-Ponndorf-Verley reduction of furfural and isopropanol; however, the treatment of alkali-metal ions promoted their catalytic performance with improved recalcitrance to deactivation and coking significantly. The type of alkali-metal ions and the concentration of alkaline solution influenced the catalytic performance, which were found to correlate to the acidity and textual properties. The optimum reaction result (97.3% yield of furfuryl alcohol at 99.6% conversion of furfural) can be obtained on 0.025 M-Na+-Zr-Al-Beta with high tolerance to the furfural concentration. Support modification strategies can be employed to optimize these properties for enhanced catalytic efficiency and selectivity by tuning and normalizing the various acidic sites of zeolites. For instance, the post-synthetic method is demonstrated to be preferential to form open sites, which have stronger Lewis acidic properties than the closed sites. The simple post-synthetic strategy to prepare a Zr-Al-Beta zeolite with both plentiful Lewis acid open Zr (IV) sites and Brnsted acid sites has shown a superior catalytic activity, water-tolerance ability, and reusability in the cascade conversion of cinnamaldehyde toward 1-cinnamyl 2-propyl ether. The controllable tuning for the acid properties with various active sites is greatly required to promote some of the chemical transformations and avoid the possibility of other undesired reaction pathways except for the aimed reaction route, such as dehydration, polymerization, and isomerization.

The physicochemical properties of catalysts, including chemical qualities and morphological characteristics, significantly impact their performance in dehydrogenation reactions. Chemical qualities, such as acid strength and stability, affect the selectivity toward the targeted alkene, while morphological and porous qualities influence the diffusion efficiency. Support modification strategies, summarized in Table 3, can optimize these properties for enhanced catalytic efficiency and selectivity. Proper acidity of the support is crucial for CH activation and propylene desorption in PDH reactions, while excessive acidity can lead to negative impacts such as CC cracking and deep dehydrogenation. For zeolites, Lewis acid sites are preferred for propane dehydrogenation, whereas Brnsted acid sites catalyze cleavage reactions. The diffusion efficiency of reactants and products in heterogeneous catalysts is determined by the morphology, structure, size, and chemical properties of the supports. Strategies to enhance catalytic efficiency include developing nanosized supports and synthesizing supports with specific morphologies and high external surfaces.
