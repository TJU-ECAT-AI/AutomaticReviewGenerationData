The equilibrium conversion of alkanes increases with temperature, but alkene selectivity decreases due to an increased tendency toward dehydrocyclization/aromatisation, thermal cracking, and coke formation. The extent of PtSn interactions depends on the impregnation sequence of Pt and Sn precursors on the support material. The framework of microporous zeolites exerts dispersive forces on reactant molecules, which depend on the shape, channel, and cavity of the framework. The nature and density of active sites also influence the framework dispersion forces. Recent reports have shown that the strong electrostatic field between protons or exchanged metal ions and basic oxygen species can enhance and/or induce polarization of bonds in hydrocarbon adsorbates. This polarization effect can be viewed as an intermediate condition to hydride abstraction, an important elementary step in CH activation. The polarizing effect increases with increasing charge magnitude and ionic radius of the alkane polarizing cations. The choice of cations should be such that they exhibit no catalytic effects on the target alkene products at the reaction condition. It may be beneficial to create a CH polarization effect on the zeolite framework by appropriate modification of framework atoms. Active sites are usually created on the zeolite frameworks. The active sites of the bimolecular pathway are formed in situ and are made up of an alkyl carbenium ion ionically held to the zeolite framework oxygen ion. The active sites of the unimolecular pathway are the charge balancing protons of the zeolite framework. A proton and a carbenium ion are electrophilic or Lewis acid species, and the two pathways essentially involve electrophilic CH activation. The exchanged metal ions in zeolites are held ionically by one or more basic oxygen atoms. Different species have been suggested, depending on the density of the cation exchange site of the zeolite and the method of introduction of the metals. High alkene selectivities are obtained on the H-ZSM-5 when exchangeable protons are rigorously replaced by Zn and Ga. The CH activation on the OZn2+O site can be described by a Lewis base-assisted deprotonation mechanism, accompanied by conversion of the Lewis base site to a conjugate Bronsted acid site. The OGa+ site, however, activates the CH bond via oxidative addition without a protonic site intermediate. A protonic site intermediate increases the tendency of side reactions on the Zn-exchanged H-ZSM-5 relative to the Ga counterpart. The elementary steps of CH activation on OGa+ reveal that a redox cycle at the metal center is required for catalytic CH activation via the oxidative addition mechanism. However, under alkane dehydrogenation reaction conditions, the OZn2+O sites can undergo a reversible Zn2+/Zn redox process, increasing the availability of undesired protonic site intermediates. Zn-exchanged H-ZSM-5 prepared by conventional ion-exchange methods contain a significant percentage of unexchanged proton sites, leading to lower alkene selectivity of the catalyst. Another strategy to enhance alkene selectivity is by controlling the strength of the proton sites. The acidity of the sites depends on the nature of the trivalent cation of the zeolite framework. Proton sites in borosilicate zeolites are weaker than those of aluminosilicate, and thus higher alkene selectivity is expected for alkane dehydrogenation over Zn/H[B]-ZSM-5 compared to Zn/H[Al]-ZSM-5. However, Zn/H[B]-ZSM-5 shows no activity for propane dehydrogenation. The desired weaker acidity of the proton sites of Zn/H[B]-ZSM-5 requires weaker basicity of the oxygen atoms in the zeolite framework. This reduced basicity of the oxygen atoms is not sufficiently polarizing to complement the exchanged Zn2+ in CH bond cleavage. Elimination of the proton sites of zeolites is critical for obtaining a high alkene selectivity and stability in dehydrogenation catalysts. Pt is the most versatile noble metal catalyst for alkane reactions, often justified by its higher activity, stability, and selectivity for these reactions compared to less expensive alternative transition metals. However, rapid catalyst deactivation due to coke formation remains a challenge even when using a Pt-based catalyst for dehydrogenation of light alkanes. The presence of acid (Bronsted and Lewis) sites on the supports promotes readsorption, oligomerization, and aromatization of alkenes. Promotion of Pt with metals, such as Sn, Ga, Zn, Re, etc., improves catalyst stability, but also leads to faster deactivation rates than Pt/Na[Fe]-ZSM-5. The role of potassium in commercial Cr and Pt-based dehydrogenation catalysts is to minimize the undesired influence of protonic sites on alkene selectivity. The nature and role of surface oxygen species become more evident. The electronic promotion effect of Sn is in line with the oxidative addition CH activation mechanism. However, the Lewis base-assisted deprotonation mechanism could also explain the proposed CH activation on Cr-based catalysts. A recent report suggests that a porous copper-aluminum framework material (stabilized by metal oxide) has better performance (activity/selectivity/stability) for propane dehydrogenation than a PtSn/Al2O3. The Lewis base-assisted deprotonation mechanism may be invoked here, and the redox property of the metal center is likely to play a role in achieving propane dehydrogenation at 350 C.

mechanisms on Pt-based and representative metal oxide-based catalysts would be clarified.\n          The coordination saturated Pt atoms are more selective for propane dehydrogenation, while the coordinatively unsaturated Pt atoms will catalyze the side reactions, such as CC breaking and deep dehydrogenation, resulting in the formation of carbon deposits.\n          The adsorption configuration and strength of propylene can be both greatly perturbed by surface structures, coke formation is inherently governed by the surface geometric and electronic structures, and thus the construction of specific reaction ensembles is important.\n          Tuning the support's acidity and coke mobility can also inhibit the coke formation.\n          The effective strategies for inhibiting coke are summarized as follows.\n          Geometric separation: Previous research studies have shown that separating the active metal components could inhibit the structure-sensitive side reactions with improved propylene selectivity.\n          Electron richness: A high electron density of Pt particles is beneficial to weaken Pt(CC) bonds, inhibit coke precursors, and suppress deep dehydrogenation and CC cleavage as well, thus promoting desorption of C3H6, leading to a favorable C3H6 selectivity.\n          Poisoning acid sites: In addition to the coke on metal particles, the coke on acidic supports can also suppress the diffusion of reactive molecules.\n          Cofeeding streams: In addition to the modulation of catalyst structures and the properties of supports, changes in reaction conditions by cofeeding streams, such as H2, and CO2, can also have a positive effect on coke elimination.\n          Enhancing oxygen mobility: The oxidation of the adsorbed surface carbonaceous species can help eliminate the coke deposition over supported metals and thus is beneficial to the improvement of catalytic stability.\n          Coke transfer: In addition to inhibiting the coke accumulation on a Pt surface, transferring coke precursors from Pt to supports can also prolong the catalyst life.\n          Their textural properties such as specific surface area, acidbase properties, and thermal stability have been demonstrated to have significant influences on the catalytic performance of Pt-based catalysts.\n          For example, to avert the occurrence of undesirable coke and alkane isomerization on supports, the support acidity should be carefully controlled.\n          Additionally, to increase the dispersion of metal particles, supports with high surface area and uniform pore size distribution are preferred.\n          Some alkaline metals, such as Li, Na, and K, can help poison the strong acid sites and avoid the coke deposition on the Al2O3 surface.\n          Additionally, doping Mg into Al2O3 forms a stable spinel phase.\n          An-Hui Lu and coworkers indicated that Al2O3 nanosheets with abundant penta-coordinate Al atoms have a strong metalsupport interaction owing to their capacity for anchoring Pt atoms, which accounts for their high stability.\n          Due to the weak interaction between Pt and SiO2, Pt-based bimetals with high alloying degrees such as PtM intermetallic alloys can be formed by direct H2 pretreatment on SiO2 supports.\n          Comparatively, there exist strong interactions between CeO2 and metal particles, where Pt atoms can be trapped in the form of Pt ions.\n          Additionally, upon using water vapor, the coke deposition could be eliminated accounting for the redox properties of CeO2 under propane dehydrogenation.\n          The adjustable Si/Al ratios and relatively large surface areas can hinder the formation of large hydrocarbon molecules, thus preventing the so-called coke deposits and improving the catalytic stability.\n          Besides, some mesoporous materials, such as SBA-1561 and MCM-41, are often used as the catalyst supports to disperse the active phase with more active sites and less coke deposition.\n          Two-dimensional (2D) early transition metal carbides, i.e., MXenes, due to their well-defined structures and tunable compositions have attracted much attention.\n          Additionally, carbon materials have been widely used for plenty of reactions because of their large surface area, chemical inertness and stability in acidic/basic media.\n          Novel nanostructured carbon materials including carbon nanotubes and graphene as supports have been gradually developed.\n          Obviously, each specific support has its own characteristic and may exhibit a distinctive effect on the catalytic property.\n          It can not only change the selectivity by influencing the component, morphology and distribution of metal particles but also alter the reaction stability by increasing mechanical strength, anti-sintering and anti-coking resistance.", "English": "The physicochemical properties of catalysts, including chemical qualities and morphological characteristics, significantly influence their performance in dehydrogenation reactions. For instance, the coordination saturation of Pt atoms affects the selectivity of propane dehydrogenation, while the unsaturated Pt atoms can catalyze side reactions, leading to carbon deposition. The adsorption configuration and strength of propylene are closely related to the surface structures, which governs the formation of coke. The acidity and coke mobility of the support also play a role in inhibiting coke formation. Various strategies have been proposed to inhibit coke formation, such as geometric separation, electron richness, poisoning acid sites, cofeeding streams, enhancing oxygen mobility, and coke transfer. The textural properties of supports, such as specific surface area, acid-base properties, and thermal stability, have significant influences on the catalytic performance of Pt-based catalysts. To prevent the occurrence of undesirable coke and alkane isomerization on supports, the support acidity should be carefully controlled. Supports with high surface area and uniform pore size distribution are preferred to increase the dispersion of metal particles. Alkaline metals, such as Li, Na, and K, can help poison the strong acid sites and avoid the coke deposition on the Al2O3 surface. Doping Mg into Al2O3 forms a stable spinel phase. Al2O3 nanosheets with abundant penta-coordinate Al atoms have a strong metal-support interaction owing to their capacity for anchoring Pt atoms, which accounts for their high stability. Due to the weak interaction between Pt and SiO2, Pt-based bimetals with high alloying degrees such as PtM intermetallic alloys can be formed by direct H2 pretreatment on SiO2 supports. Comparatively, there exist strong interactions between CeO2 and metal particles, where Pt atoms can be trapped in the form of Pt ions. Additionally, upon using water vapor, the coke deposition could be eliminated accounting for the redox properties of CeO2 under propane dehydrogenation. The adjustable Si/Al ratios and relatively large surface areas can hinder the formation of large hydrocarbon molecules, thus preventing the so-called coke deposits and improving the catalytic stability. Besides, some mesoporous materials, such as SBA-1561 and MCM-41, are often used as the catalyst supports to disperse the active phase with more active sites and less coke deposition. Two-dimensional (2D) early transition metal carbides, i.e., MXenes, due to their well-defined structures and tunable compositions have attracted much attention. Additionally, carbon materials have been widely used for plenty of reactions because of their large surface area, chemical inertness and stability in acidic/basic media. Novel nanostructured carbon materials including carbon nanotubes and graphene as supports have been gradually developed. Obviously, each specific support has its own characteristic and may exhibit a distinctive effect on the catalytic property. It can not only change the selectivity by influencing the component, morphology and distribution of metal particles but also alter the reaction stability by increasing mechanical strength, anti-sintering and anti-coking resistance.", "Chinese": "催化剂的物理化学性质，包括化学性质和形态特征，对脱氢反应的性能有重大影响。例如，Pt原子的配位饱和度影响丙烷脱氢的选择性，而未饱和的Pt原子可以催化副反应，导致碳沉积。丙烯的吸附构型和强度与表面结构密切相关，这决定了焦炭的形成。支撑材料的酸性和焦炭流动性也在抑制焦炭形成中发挥作用。为了抑制焦炭形成，提出了多种策略，如几何分离、电子丰富性、酸性位点中毒、共进料流、增强氧流动性以及焦炭转移。支撑材料的纹理性质，如比表面积、酸碱性质和热稳定性，对Pt基催化剂的催化性能有显著影响。为了防止在支撑材料上发生不希望的焦炭和烷烃异构化，应仔细控制支撑材料的酸性。为了增加金属颗粒的分散度，优选具有高比表面积和均匀孔径分布的支撑材料。一些碱金属，如Li、Na和K，可以帮助毒化强酸位点，避免在Al2O3表面沉积焦炭。在Al2O3中掺杂Mg形成稳定的尖晶石相。具有丰富五配位Al原子的Al2O3纳米片由于其锚定Pt原子的能力而具有强烈的金属-支撑相互作用，这解释了它们的高稳定性。由于Pt和SiO2之间的弱相互作用，可以通过在SiO2支撑材料上直接H2预处理形成具有高合金度的Pt基双金属，如PtM金属间合金。相比之下，CeO2和金属颗粒之间存在强烈的相互作用，其中Pt原子可以以Pt离子的形式被捕获。此外，通过使用水蒸气，焦炭沉积可以被消除，这归因于CeO2在丙烷脱氢下的氧化还原性质。可调的Si/Al比和相对较大的比表面积可以阻止大烃分子的形成，从而防止所谓的焦炭沉积，提高催化稳定性。此外，一些介孔材料，如SBA-1561和MCM-41，通常用作催化剂支撑材料，以分散活性相，具有更多的活性位点和更少的焦炭沉积。二维（2D）早期过渡金属碳化物，即MXenes，由于其明确定义的结构和可调成分而受到广泛关注。此外，碳材料因其大比表面积、化学惰性和在酸性/碱性介质中的稳定性而被广泛用于大量反应。包括碳纳米管和石墨烯在内的新型纳米结构碳材料作为支撑材料逐渐被开发。显然，每种特定支撑材料都有其自身的特点，可能对催化性能产生独特的影响。它不仅可以改变选择性，影响金属颗粒的成分、形态和分布，还可以通过增加机械强度、抗烧结和抗焦炭性来改变反应稳定性。", "Doi": "10.1039/D0CS00814A"},

Akin to Al2O3, Ga2O3 has different polymorphs of which β-Ga2O3 is not only the most stable, but also the most active Ga species in PDH according to some authors.\n          β-Ga2O3 has a monoclinic structure, in which gallium atoms are equally distributed between tetrahedral and octahedral configurations. This crystal structure has a high concentration of weak Lewis acid sites (coordinatively unsaturated tetrahedral ones on the surface of the material), which are deemed to be centers of dehydrogenation activity.\n          The assignment of Lewis acid sites as the active species was substantiated by Chen et al., who, by relating the results of NH3-TPD measurements with activity data for different GaxAl10xO15 mixed oxides, showed that a high concentration of Lewis acid groups in the form of coordinatively unsaturated tetrahedral Ga3+ cations is a prerequisite for dehydrogenation activity.\n          Xu et al. reported dehydrogenation activity on both Lewis and Brnsted acid sites on GaO3/H-ZSM-5.

Support modification strategies, such as doping with alkali metals or using mixed oxides, can optimize these properties for enhanced catalytic efficiency and selectivity. For example, doping with alkali metals can reduce surface acidity and increase the number of active sites, while using mixed oxides can improve thermal stability and coking resistance.", "English": "The physicochemical properties of catalysts, including chemical qualities and morphological characteristics, have a significant impact on their performance in dehydrogenation reactions. For example, the surface area-to-metal loading ratio determines the formation of different vanadium species, which affects the catalytic activity. The reducibility of vanadium species also influences the catalytic performance. The addition of MgO can improve the selectivity of vanadium-based catalysts by reducing coke formation. Using silica to dope alumina support can enhance the stability and activity of vanadium oxide catalysts. The type of support and preparation conditions can affect the formation of molybdenum oxide species. Hydrogen reduction can increase conversion but decrease selectivity due to the formation of acid sites. The structure of the support, such as mesoporous GaAl mixed oxide, can increase the resistance to catalyst coking. Poisoning Brnsted acid sites with K can reduce coke formation. Alumina is the most common support, and various methods have been explored to produce chromia-alumina catalysts. The choice of support can also influence the stability and dispersion of the active phase, which in turn affects the catalytic efficiency and selectivity. For example, zirconia has been investigated as an alternative support due to its low surface acidity and enhanced sintering resistance, which can improve the performance of chromia-based catalysts. The acidity of the support can also play a role in catalytic behavior, as demonstrated by the study of porous chromia-pillared α-zirconium phosphate materials. Support modification strategies, such as doping with alkali metals or using mixed oxides, can optimize these properties for enhanced catalytic efficiency and selectivity. For instance, doping with alkali metals can stabilize the structure of the support, reduce surface acidity, and increase the number of active sites. Using mixed oxides can also improve the thermal stability and coking resistance of the catalysts. The surface area-to-metal loading ratio determines the formation of monomeric, polymeric, or crystalline vanadium species on the catalyst. Hydroxyl groups on the support surface are important for anchoring vanadium precursors, while acid sites are detrimental to catalyst performance. Silica doping of alumina support can improve catalyst stability and activity. Addition of MgO can improve dehydrogenation selectivity by reducing coke formation. The reducibility of vanadium species depends on their molecular structure. Molybdenum oxide can exist as monomers, polymers, or crystallites, depending on loading, support, and preparation conditions. Optimal molybdenum oxide activity is achieved with monolayer coverage on alumina. Hydrogen reduction of molybdenum oxide catalyst increases conversion but decreases selectivity. Ga2O3 polymorphs, particularly β-Ga2O3, have high concentration of weak Lewis acid sites for dehydrogenation activity. Coordinatively unsaturated tetrahedral Ga3+ cations are crucial for dehydrogenation activity. High concentration of Lewis acid groups in the form of Ga3+ cations is necessary for dehydrogenation activity. Zeolitic support with low medium and strong acid sites and high weak acid sites leads to most active and stable GaO3/H-ZSM-5 catalyst. Promotion with a base like potassium decreases activity, indicating acidic groups catalyze the reaction. Mesoporous GaAl mixed oxide has increased resistance to coking. Potassium reduces coke formation by poisoning Brnsted acid sites. Platinum acts as a promoter for GaOx, enhancing conversion and selectivity. Platinum assists hydrogen desorption, facilitating regeneration of gallium hydride hydroxide species. The nature of active sites in Ga-based dehydrogenation catalysts is still under debate. Molybdenum oxide can exist as monomers, polymers, or crystallites, depending on loading, support, and preparation conditions. Hydrogen reduction of catalyst increases conversion but decreases selectivity due to acid site formation. The physicochemical properties of catalysts, including chemical qualities and morphological characteristics, significantly influence their performance in dehydrogenation reactions. Alumina is the most common support, and its interaction with the active phase can profoundly impact catalyst activity and selectivity. Noble metals, particularly platinum, are preferred for their superior activation of paraffinic CH bonds and low activity for CC cleavage. The addition of alkaline metals like lithium, sodium, and potassium can poison acid sites on the support, suppressing coke formation. Zirconia is an alternative support that has been investigated, offering low surface acidity and enhanced sintering resistance. Silica requires a high surface area to stabilize Cr6+ sites. Mixed oxides prepared using layered double hydroxide precursors have also been studied for nonoxidative dehydrogenation reactions. The acidity of the support material, such as in chromia-pillared α-zirconium phosphate, can significantly affect catalytic behavior. The physicochemical properties of catalysts, including chemical qualities and morphological characteristics, significantly influence their performance in dehydrogenation reactions. The surface area-to-metal loading ratio determines the formation of different vanadium species, which affects the catalytic activity. The presence of hydroxyl groups on the support surface is crucial for anchoring vanadium precursors, while large V2O5 crystallites are inactive in dehydrogenation. The reducibility of vanadium species depends on their molecular structure, and the reduction of the catalyst by the hydrocarbon feed results in the formation of V4+ and V3+. Initially, deactivation is caused by the strong adsorption of reactants on the active sites and coke deposition. The calcination of the catalyst can remove coke but may further deactivate the catalyst due to the formation of larger V2O5 crystallites or mixed oxides. V2O5 crystallites can revert to active polymeric vanadium species under certain conditions. The addition of CO2 can have a beneficial effect on the catalyst by removing acid sites, facilitating coke gasification, and promoting hydrogen removal. The effect of CO2 depends on the catalyst support, with relatively weak basic sites on activated carbon support facilitating the reverse water gas shift reaction, while strong basic sites on Al2O3 and ZnO2 can be poisoned by CO2. Using silica to dope the alumina support can improve catalyst stability and activity. The addition of MgO can improve the performance of supported vanadium catalysts by reducing coke formation. The physicochemical properties of catalysts, including chemical qualities and morphological characteristics, significantly influence their performance in dehydrogenation reactions. The nature of the support is crucial as it not only determines the mechanical properties of the catalyst but also affects the interaction between the carrier and the active phase, which can profoundly impact catalyst activity and selectivity. For instance, alumina is the most common support, and the method of producing chromia-alumina catalysts can vary, affecting the catalyst's performance. The choice of support can also influence the catalytic activity, with different supports leading to varying orders of activity based on conversion and yield. Zirconia, as an alternative support, has been investigated for its low surface acidity and enhanced sintering resistance. Silica requires a high surface area to stabilize Cr6+ sites, and mixed oxides prepared using layered double hydroxide precursors have been studied for their catalytic properties in dehydrogenation reactions. The acidity of the support, as seen in chromia-pillared α-zirconium phosphate materials, can also influence catalytic behavior, with strong acid sites affecting cracking reactions and medium strength acid sites impacting dehydrogenation reactions. Support modification strategies can be employed to optimize the properties of catalysts for enhanced catalytic efficiency and selectivity. For example, doping alumina-based dehydrogenation catalysts with alkali ions can effectively poison undesirable acid sites, improving selectivity. Using zirconia as a support can prevent the formation of mixed oxides and offer higher thermal stability and surface area. Silica, with its high surface area, can stabilize Cr6+ sites, while mixed oxides prepared using layered double hydroxide precursors can provide improved coking resistance and thermal stability against sintering. Understanding the role of acidity in catalytic behavior can also guide the modification of supports to favor dehydrogenation reactions over cracking reactions. The physicochemical properties of catalysts, including chemical qualities and morphological characteristics, significantly influence their performance in dehydrogenation reactions. For instance, the nature of the support material, such as alumina, zirconia, or silica, can affect the dispersion and stability of the active phase, thereby impacting the catalytic activity and selectivity. The interaction between the support and the active phase can also alter the electronic properties of the catalyst, which can further enhance its performance. Support modification strategies, such as doping with alkali metals or using mixed oxides, can optimize these properties for enhanced catalytic efficiency and selectivity. For example, doping with alkali metals can reduce surface acidity and increase the number of active sites, while using mixed oxides can improve thermal stability and coking resistance.", "Chinese": "催化剂的物理化学性质，包括化学品质和形态特征，对脱氢反应的性能有重大影响。例如，表面面积与金属负载比决定了不同钒物种的形成，这影响了催化活性。钒物种的还原性也影响催化性能。添加MgO可以提高钒基催化剂的选择性，减少焦炭形成。使用硅对氧化铝载体进行掺杂可以增强钒氧化物催化剂的稳定性和活性。载体类型和制备条件可以影响钼氧化物物种的形成。氢还原可以增加转化率，但会因酸性位点的形成而降低选择性。载体结构，如介孔GaAl混合氧化物，可以增加对催化剂焦炭的抵抗力。用K中毒Brnsted酸位点可以减少焦炭形成。氧化铝是最常见的载体，已经探索了各种方法来生产铬氧化铝催化剂。载体的选择也会影响活性相的稳定性和分散性，进而影响催化效率和选择性。例如，由于其低表面酸性和增强的烧结抗性，锆酸盐已被研究作为替代载体，可以改善铬基催化剂的性能。载体的酸性也可以在催化行为中发挥作用，正如多孔铬氧化物柱状α-磷酸锆材料的研究所示。通过载体改性策略，如用碱金属掺杂或使用混合氧化物，可以优化这些性质，以增强催化效率和选择性。例如，用碱金属掺杂可以稳定载体结构，降低表面酸性，并增加活性位点的数量。使用混合氧化物也可以提高催化剂的热稳定性和抗焦性。表面面积与金属负载比决定了催化剂上形成单体、聚合体或结晶钒物种。支持表面的羟基对于锚定钒前体很重要，而酸性位点对催化剂性能有害。硅酸盐掺杂氧化铝支持可以改善催化剂稳定性和活性。添加MgO可以提高脱氢选择性，减少焦炭形成。钒物种的还原性取决于其分子结构。钼氧化物可以存在为单体、聚合体或结晶体，取决于负载、支持和制备条件。在氧化铝上形成单层覆盖的钼氧化物可实现最佳活性。钼氧化物催化剂的氢还原增加了转化率，但降低了选择性。Ga2O3多晶型，特别是β-Ga2O3，具有高浓度的弱路易斯酸位点，用于脱氢活性。配位不饱和的四面体Ga3+离子对于脱氢活性至关重要。以Ga3+离子形式的高浓度路易斯酸基团是脱氢活性的必要条件。具有低中强酸位点和高弱酸位点的沸石支持导致最活跃和最稳定的GaO3/H-ZSM-5催化剂。用碱如钾的促进会降低活性，表明酸性位点催化反应。介孔GaAl混合氧化物具有增强的抗焦炭性。钾通过毒化布伦斯特酸位点减少焦炭形成。铂作为GaOx的促进剂，增强转化率和选择性。铂协助氢解吸，促进镓氢氧化物物种的再生。Ga基脱氢催化剂中活性位点的本质仍在争议中。钼氧化物可以存在为单体、聚合体或结晶体，取决于负载、支持和制备条件。催化剂的氢还原增加了转化率，但因酸位点的形成而降低了选择性。催化剂的物理化学性质，包括化学品质和形态特征，对脱氢反应的性能有重大影响。氧化铝是最常见的载体，它与活性相的相互作用可以深刻影响催化剂的活性和选择性。贵金属，尤其是铂，因其对烷烃CH键的优异活化和对CC键断裂的低活性而被优先选择。添加碱金属如锂、钠和钾可以毒化载体上的酸位点，抑制焦炭的形成。锆酸盐作为一种替代载体已被研究，它具有低表面酸性和增强的抗烧结性。二氧化硅作为载体需要相对高的表面积来稳定Cr6+位点。使用层状双氢氧化物前体制备的混合氧化物也被研究用于非氧化脱氢反应。载体材料的酸性，如在铬酸盐柱撑α-磷酸锆中，可以显著影响催化行为。催化剂的物理化学性质，包括化学品质和形态特征，对脱氢反应的性能有重大影响。表面面积与金属负载比决定了不同钒物种的形成，影响催化活性。支撑表面存在羟基对于锚定钒前体至关重要，而大V2O5晶体在脱氢中是不活跃的。钒物种的还原性取决于其分子结构，而催化剂通过烃类进料的还原会导致V4+和V3+的形成。最初，失活是由反应物在活性位点上的强烈吸附和焦炭沉积引起的。催化剂的煅烧可以去除焦炭，但可能会因形成更大的V2O5晶体或混合氧化物而进一步失活。V2O5晶体在一定条件下可以逆转为活性聚钒物种。添加CO2可以通过去除酸位点、促进焦炭气化和促进氢气去除对催化剂产生有益影响。CO2的影响取决于催化剂载体，相对弱的碱性位点在活性炭载体上可以促进逆水煤气变换反应，而Al2O3和ZnO2上的强碱性位点可以被CO2毒化。使用二氧化硅掺杂氧化铝载体可以改善催化剂的稳定性和活性。添加MgO可以改善支撑钒催化剂的性能，通过减少焦炭形成。催化剂的物理化学性质，包括化学品质和形态特征，对脱氢反应的性能有重大影响。载体的性质不仅决定了催化剂的机械性能，还影响了载体与活性相之间的相互作用，这可能对催化剂活性和选择性产生深远影响。例如，氧化铝是最常见的载体，生产氧化铬-氧化铝催化剂的方法可以变化，影响催化剂的性能。载体的选择也会影响催化活性，不同的载体会导致基于转化率和产量的不同活性顺序。作为替代载体，氧化锆因其低表面酸性和增强的抗烧结性而被研究。二氧化硅作为载体需要高表面积来稳定Cr6+位点，使用层状双氢氧化物前体制备的混合氧化物已被研究其在脱氢反应中的催化性质。载体的酸性，如在氧化铬-柱撑α-磷酸锆材料中所见，也会影响催化行为，强酸位点会影响裂化反应，中等强度酸位点会影响脱氢反应。可以通过载体改性策略来优化催化剂的性质，以提高催化效率和选择性。例如，用碱金属离子掺杂氧化铝基脱氢催化剂可以有效地毒化不希望的酸位点，提高选择性。使用氧化锆作为载体可以防止混合氧化物的形成，并提供更高的热稳定性和表面积。二氧化硅，由于其高表面积，可以稳定Cr6+位点，而使用层状双氢氧化物前体制备的混合氧化物可以提供改善的焦化抗性和抗烧结热稳定性。了解酸性在催化行为中的作用也可以指导载体的改性，以利于脱氢反应而不是裂化反应。催化剂的物理化学性质，包括化学品质和形态特征，对脱氢反应的性能有重大影响。例如，支撑材料的性质，如氧化铝、氧化锆或二氧化硅，可以影响活性相的分散和稳定性，从而影响催化活性和选择性。支撑材料与活性相之间的相互作用还可以改变催化剂的电子性质，从而进一步提高其性能。支撑材料改性策略，如用碱金属掺杂或使用混合氧化物，可以优化这些性质，以提高催化效率和选择性。例如，用碱金属掺杂可以降低表面酸性，增加活性位点的数量，而使用混合氧化物可以提高热稳定性和抗焦炭性能。", "Doi": "10.1021/cr5002436"},

The stability and tolerance to carbon deposits of Zr-Al-Beta promoted by alkali-metal ions were demonstrated. The modification of alkali-metal ions on both Lewis acid sites and Brnsted acid sites in Zr-Al-Beta was evidenced by XPS and FT-IR spectroscopy. The untreated materials displayed poor product selectivity and high coke deposit in the Meerwein-Ponndorf-Verley reduction of furfural and isopropanol; however, the treatment of alkali-metal ions promoted their catalytic performance with improved recalcitrance to deactivation and coking significantly. The type of alkali-metal ions and the concentration of alkaline solution influenced the catalytic performance, which were found to correlate to the acidity and textual properties. The optimum reaction result (97.3% yield of furfuryl alcohol at 99.6% conversion of furfural) can be obtained on 0.025 M-Na+-Zr-Al-Beta with high tolerance to the furfural concentration. Support modification strategies can be employed to optimize these properties for enhanced catalytic efficiency and selectivity by tuning and normalizing the various acidic sites of zeolites. For instance, the post-synthetic method is demonstrated to be preferential to form open sites, which have stronger Lewis acidic properties than the closed sites. The simple post-synthetic strategy to prepare a Zr-Al-Beta zeolite with both plentiful Lewis acid open Zr (IV) sites and Brnsted acid sites has shown a superior catalytic activity, water-tolerance ability, and reusability in the cascade conversion of cinnamaldehyde toward 1-cinnamyl 2-propyl ether.

This in turn affected the distribution of different surface V species.\nGu et al. reported that P modification could greatly influence the structure and activity of VOx/Al2O3 catalysts.142 More specifically, P modification decreased the degree of VOx polymerization, which had positive implications on the catalyst stability, as evidenced by the retention of high activity (ca. 45% propane conversion) after an 8 h DDH reaction in all P-modified catalysts.\nSubsequent studies on a VOx/Al2O3 catalysts (with 12 wt% V loading) modified with Mg revealed the anti-coking capability and improved catalytic performance evident through propene yields of 1927% over a 6 h DDH reaction.143 It was found that the dispersing action of Mg modification to V2O5 crystallites and an increase in active V3+ species reduced the amount and polymerization of coke deposits.\nThe concentration of dopant atoms, and the temperature of reduction were other contributing factors that affected the catalytic behaviour for ZrO2-based catalysts.3 Numerous binary YZrOx and LaZrOx-based catalysts displayed high activity, selectivity and stability as well as comparable performance to KCrOx/Al2O3 catalysts over the course of 60 DDH cycles at 550 C, 600 C and 625 C under industrially relevant conditions. The experimental parameters had a beneficial effect on the concentration of Zrcus4+ ions, and the concentration of surface lattice oxygen, which in tandem play an active role in propane activation.\nThe specific requirements of catalyst design for each sub-reaction are discussed and we identify that, regardless of the method of dehydrogenation, the balance of acid and base sites on the catalyst surface is of paramount importance.\nThe development of an active, selective and stable catalyst is essential for dehydrogenation to be considered as a viable process in the near- and long-term future.\nThe exact composition of the HGM is likely to include copper oxide and additional promotors such as MnO2, supported on α-Al2O3.\nThe role of Cu in the catalyst was to dilute the Pt species and promote desorption of propene, thereby enhancing selectivity.\nThe h-BN nanosheets provided abundant stacking fault edges terminated with BO defects that are associated with unpaired electrons, which strongly interact with active metal species, helping to strengthen the interaction between the metal and support.\nThe preparation of new catalysts with simultaneously enhanced activity, selectivity and stability is the ultimate goal.\nThe modification of Al2O3 with metal oxides, such as TiO2 has been undertaken with some promising results.\nThe enhanced performance was ascribed to electron transfer and acid site modulation effects resulting in changes to the adsorption properties of Pt.\nThe enhanced performance and stability was attributed to ultra-small, uniformly dispersed particles, ranging in size from 1.0 to 1.4 nm, consistent with previous studies that observed structure-sensitivity.\nThe role of the subsurface was to facilitate the activation of propane on the surface.\nThe role of the support is simply to maximise the active Cr6+ surface area, rather than add any chemical functionality, hence this is the reason why chemically-unreactive supports such as SiO2 and activated carbon yield the most active CrOX catalysts.\nThe most significant barrier to commercial application is the poor on-stream stability exhibited by all chromium-based catalysts.\nThe stability was improved in the presence of CO2 (compared to DDH); ca. 74% of the original activity was retained after 10 h on-stream, which is relatively good compared to Ga- and Cr-based catalysts.\nThe origin of stability was linked to the low rate of coking associated with the spinel catalyst.\nThe role of CO2 in ODH-CO2 is to assist the above equilibrium by removing H2via the RWGS reaction.\nThe origin of this induction period was found to be reduction of In2O3 to In0 nanoclusters, which suggests the active structure is more of a supported nanoparticle type catalyst than a mixed-metal oxide.\nThe basicity of the In/ZrO2 system was suggested to promote the RWGS reaction, which in turn boosted the ODH-CO2 activity.\nThe initial STY of this catalyst was 10.7 molC3H6 kgcat1 h1 (Table 13, entry 4), which is amongst the most active reported to date, but requires significant improvements to its on-stream stability.\nDespite the low selectivity, the FeCeO2 catalysts exhibited a comparable STY to supported In2O3 (Table 13) and some Ga2O3 catalysts (Table 12).\nThe major side-reactions observed were dry reforming and cracking.\nThe cationanion double hydrolysis approach (CADH), used for the synthesis of mesoporous Al2O3 with high surface area and a pure γ-Al2O3 phase, was undertaken with the crystallisation temperature varied between 25120 C.141 It was found that the crystallisation temperature of the support directly influenced the catalytic performance of the VOx/Al2O3 catalysts, which was a consequence of the increase in Lewis acid sites with increasing crystallization temperatures up to 100 C. This in turn affected the distribution of different surface V species.\nThe authors concluded that the relative proportions of V3+, V4+ and V5+ species present on the catalyst surface were affected by V loading and at the optimal loading of 12 wt%, a high concentration of isolated V3+ species was detected.\nGu et al. reported that P modification could greatly influence the structure and activity of VOx/Al2O3 catalysts.142 More specifically, P modification decreased the degree of VOx polymerization, which had positive implications on the catalyst stability, as evidenced by the retention of high activity (ca. 45% propane conversion) after an 8 h DDH reaction in all P-modified catalysts.\nThe combined and synergistic effect of the surface acidity modifications, their influence on the active V3+ species, and weakened metalsupport interactions facilitated desorption of propene and inhibited the deep dehydrogenation that leads to coke precursors.\nSubsequent studies on a VOx/Al2O3 catalysts (with 12 wt% V loading) modified with Mg revealed the anti-coking capability and improved catalytic performance evident through propene yields of 1927% over a 6 h DDH reaction.143 It was found that the dispersing action of Mg modification to V2O5 crystallites and an increase in active V3+ species reduced the amount and polymerization of coke deposits.\nThe highest STY achieved was 7.8 molC3H6 kg1cat h1 (Table 6, entry 7).\nThe moderate vanadium doping level was conducive to highly dispersed vanadium species in the form of isolated and low-polymerized VOx species.\nHighly dispersed and stable VOx species, and an absence of V2O5 crystallites, were conducive to high catalytic activity and stability.\nThe STY was 6.2 molC3H6 kg1cat h1 (Table 6, entry 5), due to the low GHSV so while the catalyst achieved high selectivity at reasonable propane conversion, it was not as intrinsically active as other supported VOx catalysts.\nThe most active catalyst, V/Si-beta (having 3 wt% V loading) displayed an initial propene yield of 33.4% and retained activity over multiple dehydrogenationregeneration cycles.\nThe STY was 4.4 molC3H6 kg1cat h1 (Table 6, entry 6), which is 56 times less active than the most active VOx catalysts reported to date, suggesting that Si-beta does not facilitate a high concentration of active V sites.\nIt was found that VOx/ZrO2 is approximately five times more active than VOx/Al2O3 and pure ZrO2, exhibiting a STY of 9.2 molC3H6 kg1cat h1 (Table 6, entry 2).\nThe authors proposed that the enhanced performance of VOx/ZrO2 results from the facile reduction of VO, VOV and VOZr bonds, thus producing higher proportions of the active V3+ species.\nFor the most active catalyst, with 8 wt% V loading, the initial yield of propene increased from 24% at 550 C to 28% at 575 C with a negligible (<1%) increase at 600 C.\nThis corresponded to a STY of 24 molC3H6 kg1cat h1 (Table 6, entry 3), which is one of the most active VOx-based catalysts reported.\nThe STY of ZrO2 without VOx is actually much higher than in the current work.\nThe most active V species has been identified, the relative proportion and stability of this surface V species can be tuned by varying the preparation method.\nThe role of the other V species on the DDH reaction remains unclear so further work to elucidate this could yield more active and stable DDH catalysts.\nThe range in performance of V-based catalysts varies quite significantly, with the most active catalysts exhibiting STYs that are around 34 time less active than the most active Pt catalysts.\nThe specific requirements of catalyst design for each sub-reaction are discussed and we identify that, regardless of the method of dehydrogenation, the balance of acid and base sites on the catalyst surface is of paramount importance.\nThe development of an active, selective and stable catalyst is essential for dehydrogenation to be considered as a viable process in the near- and long-term future.\nIn the case of SC and coal-based MTO, this is unavoidable due to the nature of the feedstock. However, natural gas and propane can be produced from biomass. In these cases, the feedstock is renewable and so these processes are potentially much more sustainable than when using fossil fuels.\nThe majority of analyses focus on well-established processes, where more information and data are available, but no such analyses were found for oxidative dehydrogenation.\nThe thermodynamic tendency to form undesirable by-products means that such reactions must be carefully kinetically controlled. Careful catalyst design can inhibit and even switch-off some of these side-reactions, as will be discussed in the subsequent sections.\nThe exact composition of the HGM is likely to include copper oxide and additional promotors such as MnO2, supported on α-Al2O3.\nThe role of Cu in the catalyst was to dilute the Pt species and promote desorption of propene, thereby enhancing selectivity.\nThe role of the subsurface was to facilitate the activation of propane on the surface.\nThe preparation strategy could greatly influence the structure of Ga/SiO2 catalysts.\nThe preparation of GaRh supported catalytically active liquid metal solutions.\nThe GaPt alloy melts at temperatures between 270 C and 330 C.\nThe activity is dependent on the bond strength of the VOsupport bond.\nThe metalsupport (VOsupport) interactions affect the resultant catalyst performance.\nThe catalyst deactivated quickly due to carbon deposition, but retained its initial activity over the course of ten successive dehydrogenationregeneration cycles.\nThe first study of Cr2O3-based catalysts for ODH-CO2 was reported by Takahara et al. in 1996 using Cr2O3 supported on SiO2, activated carbon (AC) or Al2O3.\nIt was found that over 5 wt% Cr2O3/SiO2, the propene yield increased from 6.5% to 9.1% when CO2 was co-fed instead of Ar.\nIn contrast, the alumina supported catalyst was inhibited by the addition of CO2, as shown by the drop in propene yield from 12.7% to 3.3%.\nThe 5 wt% Cr2O3/AC material was unaffected by CO2 addition.\nThe Cr2O3/SiO2 catalyst deactivated rapidly, retaining just 66% of its original activity after 4 h on-stream.\nThe stability was noted to the same with or without CO2 in the reactant feed.\nNot only did this study establish Cr2O3 as an active ODH-CO2 catalyst, it also captured one of the recurring themes in catalyst design for ODH-CO2: some catalysts are inhibited by the addition of CO2 while others perform much better.\nRelative to many other metal oxides, Cr2O3 is considered to be one of the most promising catalysts for ODH-CO2.\nTakehira et al. compared the catalytic performance of several d block and p block oxides (namely Cr, Ga, Ni, V, Fe, Mn and Co) supported on MCM-41, at 550 C with a CO2:C3H8 molar ratio of 5.6.\nAfter 30 min on-stream, the propene yield of the Cr-based catalyst was 15% whereas for the Ga-based counterpart it was 5%.\nThe remaining catalysts all exhibited lower propene yields (in the 14% range).\nHowever, as the catalysts were not characterised, it is unclear if the dispersion of these catalysts was comparable, and therefore if the results reflect the true intrinsic activity of each metal.\nIt was also noted that the order of reactivity resembled the trends observed by Nakagawa et al. for diamond-supported metal catalysts in the DDH reaction.\nThis suggests that there are commonalities in catalyst design between DDH and ODH-CO2 which most likely relate to the interaction of the alkane with the catalyst.\nContrary to this, Zhang et al. compared ZrO2, SBA-15 and γ-Al2O3 as supports for Cr2O3 in the DDH, ODH-CO2 and ODH-O2 reactions.\nThey found that the highest propene yield was observed with different catalyst systems under different dehydrogenation reactions, i.e., the activity trends in DDH did not translate to ODH-CO2 catalysts.\nSpecifically, Cr2O3/ZrO2 catalyst was the most active for the DDH reaction, while the highest yield of propene for the ODH-CO2 and ODH-O2 reactions was observed over Cr2O3/SBA-15 (Table 11, entry 7).\nAcross all the catalysts however, the highest propene yields were generally observed in the DDH reaction, ascribed to the production of carbon oxides in the ODH-O2 and ODH-CO2 reactions.\nHowever, it was reported that Cr2O3/ZrO2 was more stable on-stream in ODH-CO2 than in the DDH reaction.\nWu et al. also observed increased stability of Cr2O3/ZrO2 in the presence of CO2 (Table 11, entry 4).\nThey reported that the CO formation rate was higher than the CO2 consumption rate and the excess CO was suggested to originate from the Boudouard reaction (CO2 + C  2CO); this could explain the increased stability of this catalyst.\nIt is possible that some dry reforming of propane also took place, which would produce H2 and CO.\nZhao et al. recently reported the facile preparation of Cr supported in mesoporous ZrO2 using an evaporation-induced self-assembly method (Table 11, entry 6).\nThe authors suggested that propene could react with carbon dioxide to form carbon monoxide, methane and water.\nOther studies have reported a stronger inhibition effect for Cr2O3/ZrO2 catalysts in the presence of CO2.\nFor instance, Ferreira et al. studied the adsorption properties of CO2 and concluded that it binds strongly to active Cr2O3 sites, lowering the activity and stability of the catalyst,\nwhereas Xie et al. suggested that coke formation could originate from CO2 hydrogenation over Cr2+ species.\nThese conflicting reports may relate to the structural polymorph of ZrO2 present in the catalyst support; this factor is often overlooked, but recent studies from Kondratenko et al. revealed that nanocrystalline ZrO2 is an active DDH catalyst in its own right151,152 under similar reaction conditions.\nThe ZrO2 crystal phase and crystallite size were strongly correlated to the catalyst activity: smaller crystallites were more active but amorphous ZrO2 had very low intrinsic activity.\nMoreover, monoclinic ZrO2 was more active than tetragonal ZrO2.\nCr2O3-catalysed ODH-CO2 has been examined over different polymorphs of SiO2,254256 including various structured porous oxides, including SBA-1,84 SBA-15,250,257 MCM-41,91 amorphous silica84 and mesoporous silica spheres.258\nNotably, Michorczyk et al. reported a detailed comparison of different silica supports, coupled with an in-depth characterisation study.84\nIt was shown that in each case, the same active Cr species was formed, namely Cr6+, but higher surface area silicas (e.g., SBA-1 and SBA-15) were able to facilitate a higher number of such sites.\nA clear correlation was found between the rate of propene formation and the wt% of Cr6+, as determined using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS).\nIn DDH, while Cr6+ is considered active, under reaction conditions Cr3+ is rapidly formed and considered the principle active species.93,94\nThe selectivity to propene was similar across the different silica supports (8893%), with the observed differences being attributable to differences in propane conversion rather than catalytic properties.\nThese Cr2O3/SiO2 catalysts were highly active at 550 C and the most active catalyst (Cr2O3/SBA-1) achieved a STY of 7.9 molC3H6 kgcat1 h1, as shown in Table 11, entry 12.\nIt should be noted that the experiments were carried out with a CO2:C3H8 ratio of 5, which as discussed above, has been shown to enable a higher equilibrium yield of propene.\nTherefore, in studies where high conversions are generally targeted and carbon dioxide is in excess of propane, higher propene yields are reported.\nTakehira et al. carried out X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) on CrOx/MCM-41, confirming that the reduction of Cr6+ occurs during the reaction.91\nSpecifically, they identified Cr6+O4 tetrahedra as the active species.\nThese Cr3+O6 octahedra were formed after reduction, which were considered to be less active.\nIt was shown that CO2 could re-oxidise the Cr, which suggests that the redox cycle between Cr6+ and Cr3+ is an important process during the reaction.\nYi et al. discriminated between isolated Cr6+ and polymeric Cr6+, finding that after reduction, isolated Cr3+ was more active than polymeric Cr3+. This underlines the importance of Cr dispersion in these catalysts.259\nIn a more detailed examination of Cr2O3/SBA-1, the relationship between the physicochemical properties of the catalyst and the observed activity were explored.85\nMichorczyk et al. found a strong positive correlation between the initial propene yield and the reducibility of the catalyst, specifically the H2 consumption.\nIn situ UV-vis measurements revealed that Cr6+ is rapidly reduced to Cr3+ or Cr2+ in the presence of C3H8 under reaction conditions.\nThe reaction proceeds through a Mars-Van Krevelen mechanism, via the Cr2+/3+ redox couple.\nRapid deactivation, typical of Cr2O3 catalysts, was observed, although the majority of the initial activity could be recovered after regeneration in air.\nThe remainder was ascribed to pore collapse and/or the formation of inactive Cr sites, although the loss of surface Cr sites through agglomeration was not considered.\nDespite early reports that activated carbon (AC) was not a suitable support for Cr2O3, subsequent studies have shown that above 550 C, the activity of Cr2O3/AC in the presence of CO2 was higher than in the DDH reaction.260\nThe enhancement in propane conversion due to the presence of CO2 increased at higher temperatures (i.e., above 600 C), although this was chiefly due to propane dry reforming proceeding, generating CO and H2 rather than propene.\nWhile this Cr2O3/AC exhibited the highest STY of propene out of all CrOx-based catalysts (21 molC3H6 kgcat1 h1, Table 11, entry 9), it rapidly deactivated on-stream and due to the support being carbonaceous, cannot be regenerated using air.\nThis severely limits the utility of this catalyst.\nZeolites have also been considered as catalyst supports for Cr2O3.\nZhang et al. prepared CrOx/Na-ZSM-5 via incipient wetness.261\nAlthough the initial conversion and selectivity was high (48% and 86%, respectively) (Table 11, entry 5), the catalysts deactivated rapidly and the reaction conditions were such that the STY was only 2.5 molC3H6 kgcat1 h1 at 550 C with a CO2:C3H8 ratio of 2.\nZhu et al. investigated a range of MFI supports, including silicalite-1 and H[B]MFI.262\nCrOx/H[B]MFI was found to be the most active catalyst, giving a STY of 4.7 molC3H6 kgcat1 h1 at 600 C with a CO2:C3H8 of 1 (Table 11, entry 15).\nAlthough the as-prepared catalyst exhibited typically poor stability for Cr catalysts, steam treating the catalyst resulted in a marked improvement.\nAfter 60 h on-stream, the as-prepared catalyst retained only 25% of its initial conversion, while the steam treated catalyst retained ca. 74%.\nThe authors ascribed the effect to stabilised Cr3+ formed in the steam treatment.\nPresumably the reduction of Cr6+ during the reaction results in an inactive or less active Cr3+ species.\nIt should also be noted that the as-prepared catalyst was initially almost twice as active as the steam treated catalyst, which leaves the possibility that at higher conversions, increased coke formation may have occurred which would exaggerate the deactivation compared to the steam treated catalyst.\nIdeally such stability comparisons would be made at isoconversion, however this discovery is one of only a few that shows improved stability on-stream.\nRecently, Michorczyk et al. prepared a Cr-β-zeolite and investigated the effect of dealumination, which clearly elucidated the effect of acidity on the catalytic performance.263\nIt was reported that the dealuminated catalyst, Cr-SiBeta, exhibited significantly higher propene yields (up to 27%), compared to the Al-containing catalyst, Cr-AlBeta (2%).\nThe presence of acid sites in the Cr-AlBeta catalyst resulted in cracking pathways that led to increased production of methane and ethene.\nMoreover, the CrAlbeta catalyst performed less well in the presence of CO2 than in the DDH reaction.\nThis was explained by the strong adsorption of CO2 on the catalyst, similar to the inhibition observed over Cr2O3/Al2O3 catalysts.\nThe stability of the dealuminated catalyst was also improved compared with CrAlbeta, but significant loss in activity was observed over the 4 h reaction.\nIn considering the redox properties of the catalysts in this work, and their previous investigations, the authors also identified a strong correlation between the H2 consumption from H2-TPR studies and the reported propene yield, as shown in Fig. 10.\nWhile the majority of investigations on ODH-CO2 Cr2O3 catalysts have focused on support modifications, the addition of a promotor has also been shown to be beneficial.\nYun et al. demonstrated that the addition of 0.5 wt% Ni to a 10 wt% CrOx/SBA-15 catalyst increased the propane and CO2 conversion, as well as the on-stream stability.264\nAfter 1 h on-stream, the Ni-promoted catalyst was 50% more active and the conversion and selectivity was almost maintained over 12 h on-stream.\nIn contrast, the less active unpromoted catalyst retained only half of the initial activity over the same time period.\nUsing three-stage H2-TPR experiments (where the catalyst is reduced twice under H2 and then re-oxidised in CO2 before the final H2-TPR program), the authors showed that the addition of Ni facilitated the re-oxidation of Cr during the reaction.\nThis is consistent with previously reported mechanisms of deactivation over Cr-based catalysts, although coking is also often reported to cause deactivation.\nInterestingly, the promoted catalyst was marginally more prone to coking.\nThis strongly suggests that overreduction of active Cr sites is the key deactivation mechanism over these catalysts.\nThere is a lot of potential to develop promoted Cr catalysts that could enhance the redox activity of the catalyst; precious metals including Pd and Pt are often supported on reducible supports for this purpose.265\nCrucially, it was found that above 0.5 wt% Ni, propane reforming was prevalent, which underlines the importance of appropriate loadings of promotors.\nO'Brien et al. investigated the effect of a Ru promoter to a 10 wt% CrOx/SiO2 catalyst.\nConsistent with Yun et al. it was shown that the propene formation rate was increased.\nA 1 wt% Ru loading was optimal and doubled the activity.\nInterestingly, this is approximately the same molar ratio reported as the optimum by Yun et al. for Ni-promoted CrOx/SBA-15 (Table 11, entry 14).\nAnother similarity was the propensity of reforming to dominate at high loadings (>1 wt%).\nThe enhanced stability seen in Ni-promoted Cr catalysts was not observed in this work and the activity could not be fully recovered after regeneration.\nConsequently, aggregation of Cr species was suggested as an additional deactivation mechanism in addition to coke formation and overreduction of Cr.\nRather than aid Cr re-oxidation in a one-step oxidative dehydrogenation, the authors concluded that the Ru promotes the RWGS reaction, which removes H2 and increases the equilibrium conversion of propane.\nHowever, the results of three-stage H2-TPR reactions indicated that Cr can be more easily oxidised in the presence of Ru, which suggests that Ru can participate in a similar role as Ni-promoted Cr catalysts.\nOverall supported chromium oxide catalysts represent one of the most active classes of ODH-CO2 catalysts, with STY values in the range of 222 molC3H6 kgcat1 h1.\nThe role of the support is simply to maximise the active Cr6+ surface area, rather than add any chemical functionality, hence this is the reason why chemically-unreactive supports such as SiO2 and activated carbon yield the most active CrOX catalysts.\nThe most significant barrier to commercial application is the poor on-stream stability exhibited by all chromium-based catalysts.\nWhile incremental improvements in the activity of Cr catalysts have been reported since their initial discovery, significant advances in catalyst stability have been relatively few.\nThe first study of Cr2O3-based catalysts for ODH-CO2 was reported by Takahara et al. in 1996 using Cr2O3 supported on SiO2, activated carbon (AC) or Al2O3.\nThe 5 wt% Cr2O3/SiO2 catalyst deactivated rapidly, retaining just 66% of its original activity after 4 h on-stream.\nThe stability was noted to the same with or without CO2 in the reactant feed.\nNot only did this study establish Cr2O3 as an active ODH-CO2 catalyst, it also captured one of the recurring themes in catalyst design for ODH-CO2: some catalysts are inhibited by the addition of CO2 while others perform much better.\nThe correct balance of acidic and basic sites is a key consideration in catalyst design.\nEqually, the ratio of carbon dioxide to propane is important to take in account, as it has kinetic and thermodynamic implications.\nThermodynamically, higher CO2:C3H8 ratios limit coke forming side-reactions.\nThe addition of CO2 in the dehydrogenation reaction has multiple effects: As discussed in Section 2, it facilitates the RWGS reaction which removes H2 from the system and shifts the thermodynamic equilibrium limit to favour propene production.\nAdditionally, CO2 can dissociate on the surface of a catalyst and provide O species to dehydrogenate propane directly.\nFinally, it can react with coke via the reverse-Boudouard reaction to produce CO, which can potentially extend the lifetime of the catalyst.\nThe role of the support is simply to maximise the active Cr6+ surface area, rather than add any chemical functionality, hence this is the reason why chemically-unreactive supports such as SiO2 and activated carbon yield the most active CrOX catalysts.\nThe most significant barrier to commercial application is the poor on-stream stability exhibited by all chromium-based catalysts.\nWhile incremental improvements in the activity of Cr catalysts have been reported since their initial discovery, significant advances in catalyst stability have been relatively few.\nThe addition of Al2O3 to ODH-CO2 catalysts is typically not beneficial.\nAlthough the addition of Al2O3 to ODH-CO2 catalysts is typically not beneficial, Chen et al. investigated spinel-type Ga2O3Al2O3 mixed oxides and showed that they can function as stable catalysts.\nThe origin of stability was linked to the low rate of coking associated with the spinel catalyst.\nUsing NH3-TPD analysis, the authors concluded that weak Lewis acid sites were conducive to high activity.\nThese acidbase properties most likely contribute to the enhanced stability as well; it is known that stronger acid sites promote oligomerisation pathways that produce coke.\nThe increased performance of Ga2O3/ZSM-48 was attributed to the abundance of weak and medium strength acid sites.\nThe low activity of Ga2O3/MgO and Ga2O3/SiO2 was ascribed to the absence of medium and strong acid sites.\nIn the Ga2O3/TiO2 catalyst, a significant proportion of the Ga (45%) was reduced.\nThis catalyst exhibited the highest propane conversion, but with a propene selectivity of 73% it did not result in the highest propene yield.\nThe origin of this induction period was found to be reduction of In2O3 to In0 nanoclusters, which suggests the active structure is more of a supported nanoparticle type catalyst than a mixed-metal oxide.\nThe basicity of the In/ZrO2 system was suggested to promote the RWGS reaction, which in turn boosted the ODH-CO2 activity.\nIt was found that 10 mol% Fe in CeO2 exhibited the highest propene yield.\nThe major side-reactions observed were dry reforming and cracking.\nThey showed that reforming pathways were more prevalent at higher CO2:C3H8 ratios, such as 2.5:1 and 5:1.\nDespite the low selectivity, the FeCeO2 catalysts exhibited a comparable STY to supported In2O3 and some Ga2O3 catalysts.\nThe number of studies on supported nanoparticle catalysts for ODH-CO2 are relatively few and those available indicate that this field of research has great potential.\nThe major challenge is in understanding and inhibiting side-reactions such as reforming, which are known to proceed over this class of catalyst, unlike in Cr- and Ga-based catalysts.\nCareful consideration of the nanostructure and composition has shown that the selectivity can be readily tuned to favour different pathways, and further investigation in this area may well be able to harness the high activity of supported nanoparticles as well as favour dehydrogenation pathways.\nDespite dozens of reports over several decades on Cr- and Ga- based catalysts, the improvements in catalyst performance have been incremental.\nThe knowledge gained from these studies on the importance of reducibility and the balance of acid and base sites should be applied to supported NP catalysts, which are a promising and somewhat neglected category of ODH-CO2 catalyst.\nThe specific requirements of catalyst design for each sub-reaction are discussed and we identify that, regardless of the method of dehydrogenation, the balance of acid and base sites on the catalyst surface is of paramount importance.\nThe development of an active, selective and stable catalyst is essential for dehydrogenation to be considered as a viable process in the near- and long-term future.\nIn the case of SC and coal-based MTO, this is unavoidable due to the nature of the feedstock. However, natural gas and propane can be produced from biomass.\nThe increased interest in direct propane dehydrogenation has been enhanced by the fall in propane price, which is the direct result of the discovery of vast shale gas reserves in North America.\nThe production of renewable green propane (also called bio-propane and bioLPG) is an emerging sector which is already being operated on a large scale.\nWith increasing pressure to source chemical feedstocks sustainably, we can expect that new interest will focus on renewable and green routes to the key platform chemicals currently required by modern society, and that green propane will play an important role in this.\nThe majority (86%) of filed patents are for DDH catalysts, followed by ODH-O2 (12%) and finally ODH-CO2 (2.4%).\nThe exact composition of the HGM is likely to include copper oxide and additional promotors such as MnO2, supported on α-Al2O3.\nThe importance of Al speciation in improving catalyst performance and stability was investigated by Shi et al.\nThe modification of Al2O3 with metal oxides, such as TiO2 has been undertaken with some promising results.\nThe role of Cu in the catalyst was to dilute the Pt species and promote desorption of propene, thereby enhancing selectivity.\nThe role of the subsurface was to facilitate the activation of propane on the surface.\nThe irreversible initial deactivation in the consecutive DDH cycles was attributed to either: (i) structural changes of active species (such as agglomeration), or (ii) collapse of pore structure.\nThe positive effect was attributed to the promoters ability to block the sites responsible for coke formation and negligible contribution to undesirable secondary reactions by the additional acid sites generated by the P-based modifier.\nThe authors attributed this enhanced performance to a high dispersion of Cr species, moderate acidity and strong metalsupport interactions in the CrOx/H-ZSM-5(260) catalyst.\nThe authors attributed high Ga/Al ratios (>0.5) with the formation of additional GaxOy clusters which negatively affected the dehydrogenation rate and thus catalytic performance.\nThe activity is dependent on the bond strength of the VOsupport bond. Therefore, it is expected that catalyst performance is affected when different supports, such as SiO2, Al2O3 and ZrO2 are utilised.", "English": "The physicochemical properties of catalysts, including chemical qualities and morphological characteristics, significantly influence their performance in dehydrogenation reactions. The crystallization temperature of the support directly affects the catalytic performance of VOx/Al2O3 catalysts by increasing Lewis acid sites and influencing the distribution of different surface V species. P modification can decrease the degree of VOx polymerization, enhancing catalyst stability and activity. Mg modification can improve catalytic performance and anti-coking capability by dispersing V2O5 crystallites and increasing active V3+ species. Gelation and calcination temperatures also impact the catalytic performance of VOx/SiO2 catalysts in terms of propane conversion, propene selectivity, and yield of propene. Dealuminated beta zeolites (Si-beta) are promising catalyst supports due to their high surface area and thermal stability, and the initial propane conversion linearly increases with the amount of acid sites. VOx/ZrO2 is more active than VOx/Al2O3 and pure ZrO2 due to the facile reduction of VO, VOV, and VOZr bonds, producing higher proportions of the active V3+ species. The balance of acid and base sites on the catalyst surface is crucial for all dehydrogenation methods. The development of an active, selective, and stable catalyst is essential for dehydrogenation to be considered a viable process in the future. Support modification strategies can optimize these properties for enhanced catalytic efficiency and selectivity. Using supports with ordered mesoporosity and moderate surface acidity can aid mass transfer and avoid undesirable secondary reactions. Promoting elements can cause beneficial geometric and electronic effects on both the supports and active species. However, environmental and safety concerns exist in the preparation, usage, and disposal of certain catalysts due to their toxicity. Ga catalysts, while less active than Pt and Cr catalysts, have the advantage of being benign and inexpensive. The nature of the support is essential for vanadium-based catalysts, as the metalsupport interactions affect the resultant catalyst performance. The activity is dependent on the bond strength of the VOsupport bond, and catalyst performance is affected by different supports.", "Chinese": "所有答案结果中的汇总中文答案 1", "Doi": "10.1039/D1GC03700E"},

The equilibrium conversion of alkanes increases with temperature, but alkene selectivity decreases due to an increased tendency toward dehydrocyclization/aromatisation, thermal cracking, and coke formation. The extent of PtSn interactions depends on the impregnation sequence of Pt and Sn precursors on the support material. The framework of microporous zeolites exerts dispersive forces on reactant molecules, which depend on the shape, channel, and cavity of the framework. The nature and density of active sites also influence the framework dispersion forces. Recent reports have shown that the strong electrostatic field between protons or exchanged metal ions and basic oxygen species can enhance and/or induce polarization of bonds in hydrocarbon adsorbates. This polarization effect can be viewed as an intermediate condition to hydride abstraction, an important elementary step in CH activation. The polarizing effect increases with increasing charge magnitude and ionic radius of the alkane polarizing cations. The choice of cations should be such that they exhibit no catalytic effects on the target alkene products at the reaction condition. It may be beneficial to create a CH polarization effect on the zeolite framework by appropriate modification of framework atoms. Active sites are usually created on the zeolite frameworks. The active sites of the bimolecular pathway are formed in situ and are made up of an alkyl carbenium ion ionically held to the zeolite framework oxygen ion. The active sites of the unimolecular pathway are the charge balancing protons of the zeolite framework. A proton and a carbenium ion are electrophilic or Lewis acid species, and the two pathways essentially involve electrophilic CH activation. The exchanged metal ions in zeolites are held ionically by one or more basic oxygen atoms. Different species have been suggested, depending on the density of the cation exchange site of the zeolite and the method of introduction of the metals. High alkene selectivities are obtained on the H-ZSM-5 when exchangeable protons are rigorously replaced by Zn and Ga. The CH activation on the OZn2+O site can be described by a Lewis base-assisted deprotonation mechanism, accompanied by conversion of the Lewis base site to a conjugate Bronsted acid site. The OGa+ site, however, activates the CH bond via oxidative addition without a protonic site intermediate. A protonic site intermediate increases the tendency of side reactions on the Zn-exchanged H-ZSM-5 relative to the Ga counterpart. The elementary steps of CH activation on OGa+ reveal that a redox cycle at the metal center is required for catalytic CH activation via the oxidative addition mechanism. However, under alkane dehydrogenation reaction conditions, the OZn2+O sites can undergo a reversible Zn2+/Zn redox process, increasing the availability of undesired protonic site intermediates. Zn-exchanged H-ZSM-5 prepared by conventional ion-exchange methods contain a significant percentage of unexchanged proton sites, leading to lower alkene selectivity of the catalyst. Another strategy to enhance alkene selectivity is by controlling the strength of the proton sites. The acidity of the sites depends on the nature of the trivalent cation of the zeolite framework. Proton sites in borosilicate zeolites are weaker than those of aluminosilicate, and thus higher alkene selectivity is expected for alkane dehydrogenation over Zn/H[B]-ZSM-5 compared to Zn/H[Al]-ZSM-5. However, Zn/H[B]-ZSM-5 shows no activity for propane dehydrogenation. The desired weaker acidity of the proton sites of Zn/H[B]-ZSM-5 requires weaker basicity of the oxygen atoms in the zeolite framework. This reduced basicity of the oxygen atoms is not sufficiently polarizing to complement the exchanged Zn2+ in CH bond cleavage. Elimination of the proton sites of zeolites is critical for obtaining a high alkene selectivity and stability in dehydrogenation catalysts. Pt is the most versatile noble metal catalyst for alkane reactions, often justified by its higher activity, stability, and selectivity for these reactions compared to less expensive alternative transition metals. However, rapid catalyst deactivation due to coke formation remains a challenge even when using a Pt-based catalyst for dehydrogenation of light alkanes. The presence of acid (Bronsted and Lewis) sites on the supports promotes readsorption, oligomerization, and aromatization of alkenes. Promotion of Pt with metals, such as Sn, Ga, Zn, Re, etc., improves catalyst stability, but also leads to faster deactivation rates than Pt/Na[Fe]-ZSM-5. The role of potassium in commercial Cr and Pt-based dehydrogenation catalysts is to minimize the undesired influence of protonic sites on alkene selectivity. The nature and role of surface oxygen species become more evident. The electronic promotion effect of Sn is in line with the oxidative addition CH activation mechanism. However, the Lewis base-assisted deprotonation mechanism could also explain the proposed CH activation on Cr-based catalysts. A recent report suggests that a porous copper-aluminum framework material (stabilized by metal oxide) has better performance (activity/selectivity/stability) for propane dehydrogenation than a PtSn/Al2O3. The Lewis base-assisted deprotonation mechanism may be invoked here, and the redox property of the metal center is likely to play a role in achieving propane dehydrogenation at 350 C. This should constitute the future research direction for non-oxidative dehydrogenation of lower alkanes.", "Chinese": "催化剂的物理化学性质，包括化学品质（如酸强度和稳定性）和形态特征，对脱氢反应的性能有重大影响。随着温度的升高，烷烃的平衡转化率增加，但由于脱氢环化/芳构化、热裂解和焦炭形成的倾向增加，烯烃的选择性降低。PtSn相互作用的程度取决于Pt和Sn前体在支撑材料上的浸渍顺序。微孔沸石框架对反应物分子施加的分散力取决于框架的形状、通道和腔体。活性位点的性质和密度也影响框架的分散力。最近的报告表明，质子或交换金属离子与基本氧物种之间的强静电场可以增强和/或诱导烃吸附物中键的极化。这种极化效应可以视为向氢化物抽离过渡的中间条件，这是CH活化的重要基本步骤。极化效应随电荷大小和离子半径的增加而增加。选择的阳离子应确保在反应条件下对目标烯烃产品没有催化作用。在沸石框架上创造CH极化效应可能是有益的，这可以通过适当修改框架原子来实现。活性位点通常在沸石框架上创建。双分子途径的活性位点是原位形成的，由离子结合到沸石框架氧离子的烷基卡宾离子组成。单分子途径的活性位点是沸石框架的质子平衡电荷。质子和卡宾离子是亲电性或路易斯酸性物种，两种途径本质上涉及亲电性CH活化。沸石中交换的金属离子通过一个或多个基本氧原子离子结合。根据沸石的阳离子交换位点密度和金属的引入方法，提出了不同的物种。当可交换的质子被严格替换为Zn和Ga时，H-ZSM-5获得了高烯烃选择性。OZn2+O位点上的CH活化可以通过路易斯碱辅助脱质子机制来描述，伴随路易斯碱位点转化为共轭布龙斯特酸位点。然而，OGa+位点通过氧化加成而不是质子位点中间体活化CH键。质子位点中间体增加了Zn交换的H-ZSM-5相对于Ga对应物的副反应倾向。OGa+的CH活化基本步骤揭示，金属中心的氧化还原循环是通过氧化加成机制催化CH活化所必需的。然而，在烷烃脱氢反应条件下，OZn2+O位点可以经历可逆的Zn2+/Zn氧化还原过程，增加了不希望的质子位点中间体的可用性。通过传统离子交换方法制备的Zn交换H-ZSM-5含有大量未交换的质子位点，导致催化剂的烯烃选择性降低。另一种增强烯烃选择性的策略是控制质子位点的强度。位点的酸性取决于沸石框架中三价阳离子的性质。硼硅酸盐沸石中的质子位点比铝硅酸盐弱，因此预计Zn/H[B]-ZSM-5在烷烃脱氢中的烯烃选择性高于Zn/H[Al]-ZSM-5。然而，Zn/H[B]-ZSM-5在丙烷脱氢中没有活性。Zn/H[B]-ZSM-5中所需较弱的质子位点酸性需要沸石框架中氧原子的较弱碱性。这种氧原子碱性的降低不足以补充交换的Zn2+在CH键断裂中的作用。消除沸石的质子位点对于获得高烯烃选择性和脱氢催化剂的稳定性至关重要。Pt是烷烃反应中最通用的贵金属催化剂，通常因其在这些反应中的较高活性、稳定性和选择性而被证明是合理的，与成本较低的替代过渡金属相比。然而，即使使用Pt基催化剂进行轻烷烃脱氢，由于焦炭形成导致的催化剂失活速度仍然很快。支持物上的酸（布龙斯特和路易斯）位点促进了烯烃的再吸附、寡聚化和芳构化。Pt与Sn、Ga、Zn、Re等金属的促进提高了催化剂的稳定性，但与Pt/Na[Fe]-ZSM-5相比，失活速度也更快。商业Cr和Pt基脱氢催化剂中钾的作用是最大限度地减少质子位点对烯烃选择性的不利影响。表面氧物种的性质和作用变得更加明显。Sn的电子促进效应与氧化加成CH活化机制一致。然而，路易斯碱辅助脱质子机制也可以解释在Cr基催化剂上提出的CH活化。最近的一份报告表明，一种多孔铜铝框架材料（由金属氧化物稳定）在丙烷脱氢中的性能（活性/选择性/稳定性）优于PtSn/Al2O3。可以在此处调用路易斯碱辅助脱质子机制，金属中心的氧化还原性质可能在实现350°C下的丙烷脱氢中发挥作用。这应该是非氧化脱氢较低烷烃的未来研究方向。", "Doi": "10.1016/j.fuproc.2016.04.016"},

site structures and dehydrogenation mechanisms are followed in the PDH process from a fundamental perspective.\n          In this section, the active sites, dehydrogenation pathways and deactivation mechanisms on Pt-based and representative metal oxide-based catalysts would be clarified.\n          The coordination saturated Pt atoms are more selective for propane dehydrogenation, while the coordinatively unsaturated Pt atoms will catalyze the side reactions, such as CC breaking and deep dehydrogenation, resulting in the formation of carbon deposits.\n          The adsorption configuration and strength of propylene can be both greatly perturbed by surface structures, coke formation is inherently governed by the surface geometric and electronic structures, and thus the construction of specific reaction ensembles is important.\n          Tuning the support's acidity and coke mobility can also inhibit the coke formation.\n          The effective strategies for inhibiting coke are summarized as follows.\n          Geometric separation: Previous research studies have shown that separating the active metal components could inhibit the structure-sensitive side reactions with improved propylene selectivity.\n          Electron richness: A high electron density of Pt particles is beneficial to weaken Pt(CC) bonds, inhibit coke precursors, and suppress deep

coke on acidic supports can also suppress the diffusion of reactive molecules.\n          Cofeeding streams: In addition to the modulation of catalyst structures and the properties of supports, changes in reaction conditions by cofeeding streams, such as H2, and CO2, can also have a positive effect on coke elimination.\n          Enhancing oxygen mobility: The oxidation of the adsorbed surface carbonaceous species can help eliminate the coke deposition over supported metals and thus is beneficial to the improvement of catalytic stability.\n          Coke transfer: In addition to

supports with high surface area and uniform pore size distribution are preferred.\n          Some alkaline metals, such as Li, Na, and K, can help poison the strong acid sites and avoid the coke deposition on the Al2O3 surface.\n          Additionally, doping Mg into Al2O3 forms a stable spinel phase.\n          An-Hui Lu and coworkers indicated that Al2O3 nanosheets with abundant penta-coordinate Al atoms have a strong metalsupport interaction owing to their capacity for anchoring Pt atoms, which accounts for their high stability.\n          Due to the weak interaction between

This crystal structure has a high concentration of weak Lewis acid sites (coordinatively unsaturated tetrahedral ones on the surface of the material), which are deemed to be centers of dehydrogenation activity.\n          The assignment of Lewis acid sites as the active species was substantiated by Chen et al., who, by relating the results of NH3-TPD measurements with activity data for different GaxAl10xO15 mixed oxides, showed that a high concentration of Lewis acid groups in the form of coordinatively unsaturated tetrahedral Ga3+ cations is a prerequisite for dehydrogenation activity.\n          Xu et al. reported dehydrogenation activity on both Lewis and Brnsted acid sites on GaO3/H-ZSM-5. A zeolitic support displaying a low concentration of medium and strong acid sites and a relatively high concentration of weak acid sites was found to lead to the most active and stable catalyst.\n          Michorczyk et al. concluded that acidic groups catalyze the reaction after observing that promotion with a base, such as potassium, resulted in a decrease in activity.\n          The structure of the support is also important, as a mesoporous GaAl mixed oxide exhibited an increased resistance to catalyst coking.\n          The function of K was to reduce coke formation by poisoning Brnsted acid sites.\n          Pt is believed to act as a promoter for the GaOx. Indeed, albeit 1000 ppm Pt/Al2O3 was found to be virtually inactive, 1000 ppm of Pt in combination with 3 wt % Ga afforded conversions close to the equilibrium and an propylene selectivity <95%.\n          The role of Pt is to assist hydrogen desorption, which facilitates the regeneration of the gallium hydride hydroxide species.\n          The exact nature of the active sites in Ga-based dehydrogenation catalysts is still under debate.\n          The chemistry of molybdenum oxide is comparable to that of vanadium oxide, as Mo can be present as MoOx monomers, polymers, or MoO3 crystallites, depending on the molybdenum loading, the type of support used, and catalyst preparation conditions.\n          The reducibility of the catalyst with hydrogen prior to reaction increases conversion, although selectivity decreases due to the formation of acid sites.\n          The chemistry of molybdenum oxide is comparable to that of vanadium oxide, as Mo can be present as MoOx monomers, polymers, or MoO3 crystallites, depending on the molybdenum loading, the type of support used, and catalyst preparation conditions.\n          The reducibility of the catalyst with hydrogen prior to reaction increases conversion, although selectivity decreases due to the formation of acid sites.\n          The chemistry of molybdenum oxide is comparable to that of vanadium oxide, as Mo can be present as MoOx monomers, polymers, or MoO3 crystallites, depending on the molybdenum loading, the type of support used, and catalyst preparation conditions.\n          The reducibility of the catalyst with hydrogen prior to reaction increases conversion, although selectivity decreases due to the formation of acid sites.\n          The chemistry of molybdenum oxide is comparable to that of vanadium oxide, as Mo can be present as MoOx monomers, polymers, or MoO3 crystallites, depending on the molybdenum loading, the type of support used, and catalyst preparation conditions.\n          The reducibility of the catalyst with hydrogen prior to reaction increases conversion, although selectivity decreases due to the formation of acid sites.\n          The chemistry of molybdenum oxide is comparable to that of vanadium oxide, as Mo can be present as MoOx monomers, polymers, or MoO3 crystallites, depending on the molybdenum loading, the type of support used, and catalyst preparation conditions.\n          The reducibility of the catalyst with hydrogen prior to reaction increases conversion, although selectivity decreases due to the formation of acid sites.\n          The chemistry of molybdenum oxide is comparable to that of vanadium oxide, as Mo can be present as MoOx monomers, polymers, or MoO3 crystallites, depending on the molybdenum loading, the type of support used, and catalyst preparation conditions.\n          The reducibility of the catalyst with hydrogen prior to reaction increases conversion, although selectivity decreases due to the formation of acid sites.\n          The chemistry of molybdenum oxide is comparable to that of vanadium oxide, as Mo can be present as MoOx monomers, polymers, or MoO3 crystallites, depending on the molybdenum loading, the type of support used, and catalyst preparation conditions.\n          The reducibility of the catalyst with hydrogen prior to reaction increases conversion, although selectivity decreases due to the formation of acid sites.\n          Alumina is by far the most common support, and a variety of methods to produce chromiaalumina catalysts have been investigated.\n          The nature of the support is important not only because it governs the mechanical properties of the catalyst, but also because the interaction of the carrier with the active phase can have a profound impact on catalyst activity and selectivity.\n          Albeit selectivity has been found to be insensitive to chromium loading, it does change over time.\n          The use of zirconia as an alternative support has also been investigated.\n          The use of silica as the support in chromia-based dehydrogenation catalysts requires a relative high surface area to stabilize Cr6+ sites.\n          CrMgAl and CrMg mixed oxides prepared using layered double hydroxide (LDH) precursors have been studied as catalysts for the nonoxidative dehydrogenation of ethane.\n          Finally, the study of porous chromia-pillared α-zirconium phosphate materials has been particularly informative with regards to the influence that acidity has on catalytic behavior.\n          The surface area-to-metal loading ratio determines which species will form. Indeed, Wu et al. reported that monomeric species are predominantly present below 1.2 V/nm2, polymeric vanadium species prevail between 1.2 and 4.4 V/nm2, and crystalline V2O5 species preponderate at even higher loadings.\n          On the one hand, the presence of hydroxyl groups on the surface of the support is important to obtain a well-dispersed catalyst, as OH groups serve as anchoring sites for the vanadium precursors used to prepare these catalysts. On the other hand, acid sites are detrimental for catalyst performance, because they facilitate cracking and induce coke formation.\n          Alumina is commonly used as a support for vanadium oxide catalysts, although Sokolov et al. concluded through testing a wide range of Si- and Al-based supports that using silica to dope the alumina support provides beneficial effects on catalyst stability and activity.\n          Furthermore, as was shown by Harlin et al., the performance of supported vanadium catalysts can be improved through the addition of MgO, either as a promoter or as a component of a mixed oxide. According to these workers, the increase in dehydrogenation selectivity stems from the basic nature of MgO, resulting in reduced coke formation.\n          The reducibility of the vanadium species depends on their molecular structure, VOV and VO bonds being more easily reduced than VO-support bonds.\n          Prior to reaction, the vanadium in these catalysts is generally present as V5+.

The interaction between the support and the active phase can also alter the electronic properties of the catalyst, which can further enhance its performance. Support modification strategies, such as doping with alkali metals or using mixed oxides, can optimize these properties for enhanced catalytic efficiency and selectivity.

For example, the surface area-to-metal loading ratio determines the formation of different vanadium species, which affects the catalytic activity. The reducibility of vanadium species also influences the catalytic performance. The addition of MgO can improve the selectivity of vanadium-based catalysts by reducing coke formation. Using silica to dope alumina support can enhance the stability and activity of vanadium oxide catalysts. The type of support and preparation conditions can affect the formation of molybdenum oxide species. Hydrogen reduction can increase conversion but decrease selectivity due to the formation of acid sites. The structure of the support, such as mesoporous GaAl mixed oxide, can increase the resistance to catalyst coking. Poisoning Brnsted acid sites with K can reduce coke formation. Alumina is the most common support, and various methods have been explored to produce chromia-alumina catalysts. The choice of support can also influence the stability and dispersion of the active phase, which in turn affects the catalytic efficiency and selectivity. For example, zirconia has been investigated as an alternative support due to its low surface acidity and enhanced sintering resistance, which can improve the performance of chromia-based catalysts. The acidity of the support can also play a role in catalytic behavior, as demonstrated by the study of porous chromia-pillared α-zirconium phosphate materials. Support modification strategies, such as doping with alkali metals or using mixed oxides, can optimize these properties for enhanced catalytic efficiency and selectivity. For instance, doping with alkali metals can stabilize the structure of the support, reduce surface acidity, and increase the number of active sites. Using mixed oxides can also improve the thermal stability and coking resistance of the catalysts. The surface area-to-metal loading ratio determines the formation of monomeric, polymeric, or crystalline vanadium species on the catalyst. Hydroxyl groups on the support surface are important for anchoring vanadium precursors, while acid sites are detrimental to catalyst performance. Silica doping of alumina support can improve catalyst stability and activity. Addition of MgO can improve dehydrogenation selectivity by reducing coke formation. The reducibility of vanadium species depends on their molecular structure. Molybdenum oxide can exist as monomers, polymers, or crystallites, depending on loading, support, and preparation conditions. Optimal molybdenum oxide activity is achieved with monolayer coverage on alumina. Hydrogen reduction of molybdenum oxide catalyst increases conversion but decreases selectivity. Ga2O3 polymorphs, particularly β-Ga2O3, have high concentration of weak Lewis acid sites for dehydrogenation activity. Coordinatively unsaturated tetrahedral Ga3+ cations are crucial for dehydrogenation activity. High concentration of Lewis acid groups in the form of Ga3+ cations is necessary for dehydrogenation activity. Zeolitic support with low medium and strong acid sites and high weak acid sites leads to most active and stable GaO3/H-ZSM-5 catalyst. Promotion with a base like potassium decreases activity, indicating acidic groups catalyze the reaction. Mesoporous GaAl mixed oxide has increased resistance to coking. Potassium reduces coke formation by poisoning Brnsted acid sites. Platinum acts as a promoter for GaOx, enhancing conversion and selectivity. Platinum assists hydrogen desorption, facilitating regeneration of gallium hydride hydroxide species. The nature of active sites in Ga-based dehydrogenation catalysts is still under debate. Molybdenum oxide can exist as monomers, polymers, or crystallites, depending on loading, support, and preparation conditions. Hydrogen reduction of catalyst increases conversion but decreases selectivity due to acid site formation. The physicochemical properties of catalysts, including chemical qualities and morphological characteristics, significantly influence their performance in dehydrogenation reactions. Alumina is the most common support, and its interaction with the active phase can profoundly impact catalyst activity and selectivity. Noble metals, particularly platinum, are preferred for their superior activation of paraffinic CH bonds and low activity for CC cleavage. The addition of alkaline metals like lithium, sodium, and potassium can poison acid sites on the support, suppressing coke formation. Zirconia is an alternative support that has been investigated, offering low surface acidity and enhanced sintering resistance. Silica requires a high surface area to stabilize Cr6+ sites. Mixed oxides prepared using layered double hydroxide precursors have also been studied for nonoxidative dehydrogenation reactions. The acidity of the support material, such as in chromia-pillared α-zirconium phosphate, can significantly affect catalytic behavior. The physicochemical properties of catalysts, including chemical qualities and morphological characteristics, significantly influence their performance in dehydrogenation reactions. The surface area-to-metal loading ratio determines the formation of different vanadium species, which affects the catalytic activity. The presence of hydroxyl groups on the support surface is crucial for anchoring vanadium precursors, while large V2O5 crystallites are inactive in dehydrogenation. The reducibility of vanadium species depends on their molecular structure, and the reduction of the catalyst by the hydrocarbon feed results in the formation of V4+ and V3+. Initially, deactivation is caused by the strong adsorption of reactants on the active sites and coke deposition. The calcination of the catalyst can remove coke but may further deactivate the catalyst due to the formation of larger V2O5 crystallites or mixed oxides. V2O5 crystallites can revert to active polymeric vanadium species under certain conditions. The addition of CO2 can have a beneficial effect on the catalyst by removing acid sites, facilitating coke gasification, and promoting hydrogen removal. The effect of CO2 depends on the catalyst support, with relatively weak basic sites on activated carbon support facilitating the reverse water gas shift reaction, while strong basic sites on Al2O3 and ZnO2 can be poisoned by CO2. Using silica to dope the alumina support can improve catalyst stability and activity. The addition of MgO can improve the performance of supported vanadium catalysts by reducing coke formation. The physicochemical properties of catalysts, including chemical qualities and morphological characteristics, significantly influence their performance in dehydrogenation reactions. The nature of the support is crucial as it not only determines the mechanical properties of the catalyst but also affects the interaction between the carrier and the active phase, which can profoundly impact catalyst activity and selectivity. For instance, alumina is the most common support, and the method of producing chromia-alumina catalysts can vary, affecting the catalyst's performance. The choice of support can also influence the catalytic activity, with different supports leading to varying orders of activity based on conversion and yield. Zirconia, as an alternative support, has been investigated for its low surface acidity and enhanced sintering resistance. Silica requires a high surface area to stabilize Cr6+ sites, and mixed oxides prepared using layered double hydroxide precursors have been studied for their catalytic properties in dehydrogenation reactions. The acidity of the support, as seen in chromia-pillared α-zirconium phosphate materials, can also influence catalytic behavior, with strong acid sites affecting cracking reactions and medium strength acid sites impacting dehydrogenation reactions. Support modification strategies can be employed to optimize the properties of catalysts for enhanced catalytic efficiency and selectivity. For example, doping alumina-based dehydrogenation catalysts with alkali ions can effectively poison undesirable acid sites, improving selectivity. Using zirconia as a support can prevent the formation of mixed oxides and offer higher thermal stability and surface area. Silica, with its high surface area, can stabilize Cr6+ sites, while mixed oxides prepared using layered double hydroxide precursors can provide improved coking resistance and thermal stability against sintering. Understanding the role of acidity in catalytic behavior can also guide the modification of supports to favor dehydrogenation reactions over cracking reactions. The physicochemical properties of catalysts, including chemical qualities and morphological characteristics, significantly influence their performance in dehydrogenation reactions. For instance, the nature of the support material, such as alumina, zirconia, or silica, can affect the dispersion and stability of the active phase, thereby impacting the catalytic activity and selectivity.

The stability and tolerance to carbon deposits of Zr-Al-Beta promoted by alkali-metal ions were demonstrated. The modification of alkali-metal ions on both Lewis acid sites and Brnsted acid sites in Zr-Al-Beta was evidenced by XPS and FT-IR spectroscopy. The untreated materials displayed poor product selectivity and high coke deposit in the Meerwein-Ponndorf-Verley reduction of furfural and isopropanol; however, the treatment of alkali-metal ions promoted their catalytic performance with improved recalcitrance to deactivation and coking significantly. The type of alkali-metal ions and the concentration of alkaline solution influenced the catalytic performance, which were found to correlate to the acidity and textual properties. The optimum reaction result (97.3% yield of furfuryl alcohol at 99.6% conversion of furfural) can be obtained on 0.025 M-Na+-Zr-Al-Beta with high tolerance to the furfural concentration. Support modification strategies can be employed to optimize these properties for enhanced catalytic efficiency and selectivity by tuning and normalizing the various acidic sites of zeolites.

The exploitation of an efficient PDH catalyst based on HZSM-5 zeolite to achieve both high selectivity and stability is still a challenge. In zeolite supported catalysts, zeolite provides a special environment for catalytic reactions, including channel confinement effects, acidic sites, and electron transfer. Acidic sites in zeolites play a key role in determining the catalytic performance of zeolite catalysts in alkane conversion.

This in turn affected the distribution of different surface V species.\nGu et al. reported that P modification could greatly influence the structure and activity of VOx/Al2O3 catalysts.142 More specifically, P modification decreased the degree of VOx polymerization, which had positive implications on the catalyst stability, as evidenced by the retention of high activity (ca. 45% propane conversion) after an 8 h DDH reaction in all P-modified catalysts.\nSubsequent studies on a VOx/Al2O3 catalysts (with 12 wt% V loading) modified with Mg revealed the anti-coking capability and improved catalytic performance evident through propene yields of 1927% over a 6 h DDH reaction.143 It was found that the dispersing action of Mg modification to V2O5 crystallites and an increase in active V3+ species reduced the amount and polymerization of coke deposits.\nThe concentration of dopant atoms, and the temperature of reduction were other contributing factors that affected the catalytic behaviour for ZrO2-based catalysts.3 Numerous binary YZrOx and LaZrOx-based catalysts displayed high activity, selectivity and stability as well as comparable performance to KCrOx/Al2O3 catalysts over the course of 60 DDH cycles at 550 C, 600 C and 625 C under industrially relevant conditions. The experimental parameters had a beneficial effect on the concentration of Zrcus4+ ions, and the concentration of surface lattice oxygen, which in tandem play an active role in propane activation.\nThe specific requirements of catalyst design for each sub-reaction are discussed and we identify that, regardless of the method of dehydrogenation, the balance of acid and base sites on the catalyst surface is of paramount importance.\nThe development of an active, selective and stable catalyst is essential for dehydrogenation to be considered as a viable process in the near- and long-term future.\nThe exact composition of the HGM is likely to include copper oxide and additional promotors such as MnO2, supported on α-Al2O3.\nThe role of Cu in the catalyst was to dilute the Pt species and promote desorption of propene, thereby enhancing selectivity.\nThe h-BN nanosheets provided abundant stacking fault edges terminated with BO defects that are associated with unpaired electrons, which strongly interact with active metal species, helping to strengthen the interaction between the metal and support.\nThe preparation of new catalysts with simultaneously enhanced activity, selectivity and stability is the ultimate goal.\nThe modification of Al2O3 with metal oxides, such as TiO2 has been undertaken with some promising results.\nThe enhanced performance was ascribed to electron transfer and acid site modulation effects resulting in changes to the adsorption properties of Pt.\nThe enhanced performance and stability was attributed to ultra-small, uniformly dispersed particles, ranging in size from 1.0 to 1.4 nm, consistent with previous studies that observed structure-sensitivity.\nThe role of the subsurface was to facilitate the activation of propane on the surface.\nThe role of the support is simply to maximise the active Cr6+ surface area, rather than add any chemical functionality, hence this is the reason why chemically-unreactive supports such as SiO2 and activated carbon yield the most active CrOX catalysts.\nThe most significant barrier to commercial application is the poor on-stream stability exhibited by all chromium-based catalysts.\nThe stability was improved in the presence of CO2 (compared to DDH); ca. 74% of the original activity was retained after 10 h on-stream, which is relatively good compared to Ga- and Cr-based catalysts.\nThe origin of stability was linked to the low rate of coking associated with the spinel catalyst.\nThe role of CO2 in ODH-CO2 is to assist the above equilibrium by removing H2via the RWGS reaction.\nThe origin of this induction period was found to be reduction of In2O3 to In0 nanoclusters, which suggests the active structure is more of a supported nanoparticle type catalyst than a mixed-metal oxide.\nThe basicity of the In/ZrO2 system was suggested to promote the RWGS reaction, which in turn boosted the ODH-CO2 activity.\nThe initial STY of this catalyst was 10.7 molC3H6 kgcat1 h1 (Table 13, entry 4), which is amongst the most active reported to date, but requires significant improvements to its on-stream stability.\nDespite the low selectivity, the FeCeO2 catalysts exhibited a comparable STY to supported In2O3 (Table 13) and some Ga2O3 catalysts (Table 12).\nThe major side-reactions observed were dry reforming and cracking.\nThe cationanion double hydrolysis approach (CADH), used for the synthesis of mesoporous Al2O3 with high surface area and a pure γ-Al2O3 phase, was undertaken with the crystallisation temperature varied between 25120 C.141 It was found that the crystallisation temperature of the support directly influenced the catalytic performance of the VOx/Al2O3 catalysts, which was a consequence of the increase in Lewis acid sites with increasing crystallization temperatures up to 100 C. This in turn affected the distribution of different surface V species.\nThe authors concluded that the relative proportions of V3+, V4+ and V5+ species present on the catalyst surface were affected by V loading and at the optimal loading of 12 wt%, a high concentration of isolated V3+ species was detected.\nGu et al. reported that P modification could greatly influence the structure and activity of VOx/Al2O3 catalysts.142 More specifically, P modification decreased the degree of VOx polymerization, which had positive implications on the catalyst stability, as evidenced by the retention of high activity (ca. 45% propane conversion) after an 8 h DDH reaction in all P-modified catalysts.\nThe combined and synergistic effect of the surface acidity modifications, their influence on the active V3+ species, and weakened metalsupport interactions facilitated desorption of propene and inhibited the deep dehydrogenation that leads to coke precursors.\nSubsequent studies on a VOx/Al2O3 catalysts (with 12 wt% V loading) modified with Mg revealed the anti-coking capability and improved catalytic performance evident through propene yields of 1927% over a 6 h DDH reaction.143 It was found that the dispersing action of Mg modification to V2O5 crystallites and an increase in active V3+ species reduced the amount and polymerization of coke deposits.\nThe highest STY achieved was 7.8 molC3H6 kg1cat h1 (Table 6, entry 7).\nThe moderate vanadium doping level was conducive to highly dispersed vanadium species in the form of isolated and low-polymerized VOx species.\nHighly dispersed and stable VOx species, and an absence of V2O5 crystallites, were conducive to high catalytic activity and stability.\nThe STY was 6.2 molC3H6 kg1cat h1 (Table 6, entry 5), due to the low GHSV so while the catalyst achieved high selectivity at reasonable propane conversion, it was not as intrinsically active as other supported VOx catalysts.\nThe most active catalyst, V/Si-beta (having 3 wt% V loading) displayed an initial propene yield of 33.4% and retained activity over multiple dehydrogenationregeneration cycles.\nThe STY was 4.4 molC3H6 kg1cat h1 (Table 6, entry 6), which is 56 times less active than the most active VOx catalysts reported to date, suggesting that Si-beta does not facilitate a high concentration of active V sites.\nIt was found that VOx/ZrO2 is approximately five times more active than VOx/Al2O3 and pure ZrO2, exhibiting a STY of 9.2 molC3H6 kg1cat h1 (Table 6, entry 2).\nThe authors proposed that the enhanced performance of VOx/ZrO2 results from the facile reduction of VO, VOV and VOZr bonds, thus producing higher proportions of the active V3+ species.\nFor the most active catalyst, with 8 wt% V loading, the initial yield of propene increased from 24% at 550 C to 28% at 575 C with a negligible (<1%) increase at 600 C.\nThis corresponded to a STY of 24 molC3H6 kg1cat h1 (Table 6, entry 3), which is one of the most active VOx-based catalysts reported.\nThe STY of ZrO2 without VOx is actually much higher than in the current work.\nThe most active V species has been identified, the relative proportion and stability of this surface V species can be tuned by varying the preparation method.\nThe role of the other V species on the DDH reaction remains unclear so further work to elucidate this could yield more active and stable DDH catalysts.\nThe range in performance of V-based catalysts varies quite significantly, with the most active catalysts exhibiting STYs that are around 34 time less active than the most active Pt catalysts.\nThe specific requirements of catalyst design for each sub-reaction are discussed and we identify that, regardless of the method of dehydrogenation, the balance of acid and base sites on the catalyst surface is of paramount importance.\nThe development of an active, selective and stable catalyst is essential for dehydrogenation to be considered as a viable process in the near- and long-term future.\nIn the case of SC and coal-based MTO, this is unavoidable due to the nature of the feedstock. However, natural gas and propane can be produced from biomass. In these cases, the feedstock is renewable and so these processes are potentially much more sustainable than when using fossil fuels.\nThe majority of analyses focus on well-established processes, where more information and data are available, but no such analyses were found for oxidative dehydrogenation.\nThe thermodynamic tendency to form undesirable by-products means that such reactions must be carefully kinetically controlled. Careful catalyst design can inhibit and even switch-off some of these side-reactions, as will be discussed in the subsequent sections.\nThe exact composition of the HGM is likely to include copper oxide and additional promotors such as MnO2, supported on α-Al2O3.\nThe role of Cu in the catalyst was to dilute the Pt species and promote desorption of propene, thereby enhancing selectivity.\nThe role of the subsurface was to facilitate the activation of propane on the surface.\nThe preparation strategy could greatly influence the structure of Ga/SiO2 catalysts.\nThe preparation of GaRh supported catalytically active liquid metal solutions.\nThe GaPt alloy melts at temperatures between 270 C and 330 C.\nThe activity is dependent on the bond strength of the VOsupport bond.\nThe metalsupport (VOsupport) interactions affect the resultant catalyst performance.\nThe catalyst deactivated quickly due to carbon deposition, but retained its initial activity over the course of ten successive dehydrogenationregeneration cycles.\nThe first study of Cr2O3-based catalysts for ODH-CO2 was reported by Takahara et al. in 1996 using Cr2O3 supported on SiO2, activated carbon (AC) or Al2O3.\nIt was found that over 5 wt% Cr2O3/SiO2, the propene yield increased from 6.5% to 9.1% when CO2 was co-fed instead of Ar.\nIn contrast, the alumina supported catalyst was inhibited by the addition of CO2, as shown by the drop in propene yield from 12.7% to 3.3%.\nThe 5 wt% Cr2O3/AC material was unaffected by CO2 addition.\nThe Cr2O3/SiO2 catalyst deactivated rapidly, retaining just 66% of its original activity after 4 h on-stream.\nThe stability was noted to the same with or without CO2 in the reactant feed.\nNot only did this study establish Cr2O3 as an active ODH-CO2 catalyst, it also captured one of the recurring themes in catalyst design for ODH-CO2: some catalysts are inhibited by the addition of CO2 while others perform much better.\nRelative to many other metal oxides, Cr2O3 is considered to be one of the most promising catalysts for ODH-CO2.\nTakehira et al. compared the catalytic performance of several d block and p block oxides (namely Cr, Ga, Ni, V, Fe, Mn and Co) supported on MCM-41, at 550 C with a CO2:C3H8 molar ratio of 5.6.\nAfter 30 min on-stream, the propene yield of the Cr-based catalyst was 15% whereas for the Ga-based counterpart it was 5%.\nThe remaining catalysts all exhibited lower propene yields (in the 14% range).\nHowever, as the catalysts were not characterised, it is unclear if the dispersion of these catalysts was comparable, and therefore if the results reflect the true intrinsic activity of each metal.\nIt was also noted that the order of reactivity resembled the trends observed by Nakagawa et al. for diamond-supported metal catalysts in the DDH reaction.\nThis suggests that there are commonalities in catalyst design between DDH and ODH-CO2 which most likely relate to the interaction of the alkane with the catalyst.\nContrary to this, Zhang et al. compared ZrO2, SBA-15 and γ-Al2O3 as supports for Cr2O3 in the DDH, ODH-CO2 and ODH-O2 reactions.\nThey found that the highest propene yield was observed with different catalyst systems under different dehydrogenation reactions, i.e., the activity trends in DDH did not translate to ODH-CO2 catalysts.\nSpecifically, Cr2O3/ZrO2 catalyst was the most active for the DDH reaction, while the highest yield of propene for the ODH-CO2 and ODH-O2 reactions was observed over Cr2O3/SBA-15 (Table 11, entry 7).\nAcross all the catalysts however, the highest propene yields were generally observed in the DDH reaction, ascribed to the production of carbon oxides in the ODH-O2 and ODH-CO2 reactions.\nHowever, it was reported that Cr2O3/ZrO2 was more stable on-stream in ODH-CO2 than in the DDH reaction.\nWu et al. also observed increased stability of Cr2O3/ZrO2 in the presence of CO2 (Table 11, entry 4).\nThey reported that the CO formation rate was higher than the CO2 consumption rate and the excess CO was suggested to originate from the Boudouard reaction (CO2 + C  2CO); this could explain the increased stability of this catalyst.\nIt is possible that some dry reforming of propane also took place, which would produce H2 and CO.\nZhao et al. recently reported the facile preparation of Cr supported in mesoporous ZrO2 using an evaporation-induced self-assembly method (Table 11, entry 6).\nThe authors suggested that propene could react with carbon dioxide to form carbon monoxide, methane and water.\nOther studies have reported a stronger inhibition effect for Cr2O3/ZrO2 catalysts in the presence of CO2.\nFor instance, Ferreira et al. studied the adsorption properties of CO2 and concluded that it binds strongly to active Cr2O3 sites, lowering the activity and stability of the catalyst,\nwhereas Xie et al. suggested that coke formation could originate from CO2 hydrogenation over Cr2+ species.\nThese conflicting reports may relate to the structural polymorph of ZrO2 present in the catalyst support; this factor is often overlooked, but recent studies from Kondratenko et al. revealed that nanocrystalline ZrO2 is an active DDH catalyst in its own right151,152 under similar reaction conditions.\nThe ZrO2 crystal phase and crystallite size were strongly correlated to the catalyst activity: smaller crystallites were more active but amorphous ZrO2 had very low intrinsic activity.\nMoreover, monoclinic ZrO2 was more active than tetragonal ZrO2.\nCr2O3-catalysed ODH-CO2 has been examined over different polymorphs of SiO2,254256 including various structured porous oxides, including SBA-1,84 SBA-15,250,257 MCM-41,91 amorphous silica84 and mesoporous silica spheres.258\nNotably, Michorczyk et al. reported a detailed comparison of different silica supports, coupled with an in-depth characterisation study.84\nIt was shown that in each case, the same active Cr species was formed, namely Cr6+, but higher surface area silicas (e.g., SBA-1 and SBA-15) were able to facilitate a higher number of such sites.\nA clear correlation was found between the rate of propene formation and the wt% of Cr6+, as determined using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS).\nIn DDH, while Cr6+ is considered active, under reaction conditions Cr3+ is rapidly formed and considered the principle active species.93,94\nThe selectivity to propene was similar across the different silica supports (8893%), with the observed differences being attributable to differences in propane conversion rather than catalytic properties.\nThese Cr2O3/SiO2 catalysts were highly active at 550 C and the most active catalyst (Cr2O3/SBA-1) achieved a STY of 7.9 molC3H6 kgcat1 h1, as shown in Table 11, entry 12.\nIt should be noted that the experiments were carried out with a CO2:C3H8 ratio of 5, which as discussed above, has been shown to enable a higher equilibrium yield of propene.\nTherefore, in studies where high conversions are generally targeted and carbon dioxide is in excess of propane, higher propene yields are reported.\nTakehira et al. carried out X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) on CrOx/MCM-41, confirming that the reduction of Cr6+ occurs during the reaction.91\nSpecifically, they identified Cr6+O4 tetrahedra as the active species.\nThese Cr3+O6 octahedra were formed after reduction, which were considered to be less active.\nIt was shown that CO2 could re-oxidise the Cr, which suggests that the redox cycle between Cr6+ and Cr3+ is an important process during the reaction.\nYi et al. discriminated between isolated Cr6+ and polymeric Cr6+, finding that after reduction, isolated Cr3+ was more active than polymeric Cr3+. This underlines the importance of Cr dispersion in these catalysts.259\nIn a more detailed examination of Cr2O3/SBA-1, the relationship between the physicochemical properties of the catalyst and the observed activity were explored.85\nMichorczyk et al. found a strong positive correlation between the initial propene yield and the reducibility of the catalyst, specifically the H2 consumption.\nIn situ UV-vis measurements revealed that Cr6+ is rapidly reduced to Cr3+ or Cr2+ in the presence of C3H8 under reaction conditions.\nThe reaction proceeds through a Mars-Van Krevelen mechanism, via the Cr2+/3+ redox couple.\nRapid deactivation, typical of Cr2O3 catalysts, was observed, although the majority of the initial activity could be recovered after regeneration in air.\nThe remainder was ascribed to pore collapse and/or the formation of inactive Cr sites, although the loss of surface Cr sites through agglomeration was not considered.\nDespite early reports that activated carbon (AC) was not a suitable support for Cr2O3, subsequent studies have shown that above 550 C, the activity of Cr2O3/AC in the presence of CO2 was higher than in the DDH reaction.260\nThe enhancement in propane conversion due to the presence of CO2 increased at higher temperatures (i.e., above 600 C), although this was chiefly due to propane dry reforming proceeding, generating CO and H2 rather than propene.\nWhile this Cr2O3/AC exhibited the highest STY of propene out of all CrOx-based catalysts (21 molC3H6 kgcat1 h1, Table 11, entry 9), it rapidly deactivated on-stream and due to the support being carbonaceous, cannot be regenerated using air.\nThis severely limits the utility of this catalyst.\nZeolites have also been considered as catalyst supports for Cr2O3.\nZhang et al. prepared CrOx/Na-ZSM-5 via incipient wetness.261\nAlthough the initial conversion and selectivity was high (48% and 86%, respectively) (Table 11, entry 5), the catalysts deactivated rapidly and the reaction conditions were such that the STY was only 2.5 molC3H6 kgcat1 h1 at 550 C with a CO2:C3H8 ratio of 2.\nZhu et al. investigated a range of MFI supports, including silicalite-1 and H[B]MFI.262\nCrOx/H[B]MFI was found to be the most active catalyst, giving a STY of 4.7 molC3H6 kgcat1 h1 at 600 C with a CO2:C3H8 of 1 (Table 11, entry 15).\nAlthough the as-prepared catalyst exhibited typically poor stability for Cr catalysts, steam treating the catalyst resulted in a marked improvement.\nAfter 60 h on-stream, the as-prepared catalyst retained only 25% of its initial conversion, while the steam treated catalyst retained ca. 74%.\nThe authors ascribed the effect to stabilised Cr3+ formed in the steam treatment.\nPresumably the reduction of Cr6+ during the reaction results in an inactive or less active Cr3+ species.\nIt should also be noted that the as-prepared catalyst was initially almost twice as active as the steam treated catalyst, which leaves the possibility that at higher conversions, increased coke formation may have occurred which would exaggerate the deactivation compared to the steam treated catalyst.\nIdeally such stability comparisons would be made at isoconversion, however this discovery is one of only a few that shows improved stability on-stream.\nRecently, Michorczyk et al. prepared a Cr-β-zeolite and investigated the effect of dealumination, which clearly elucidated the effect of acidity on the catalytic performance.263\nIt was reported that the dealuminated catalyst, Cr-SiBeta, exhibited significantly higher propene yields (up to 27%), compared to the Al-containing catalyst, Cr-AlBeta (2%).\nThe presence of acid sites in the Cr-AlBeta catalyst resulted in cracking pathways that led to increased production of methane and ethene.\nMoreover, the CrAlbeta catalyst performed less well in the presence of CO2 than in the DDH reaction.\nThis was explained by the strong adsorption of CO2 on the catalyst, similar to the inhibition observed over Cr2O3/Al2O3 catalysts.\nThe stability of the dealuminated catalyst was also improved compared with CrAlbeta, but significant loss in activity was observed over the 4 h reaction.\nIn considering the redox properties of the catalysts in this work, and their previous investigations, the authors also identified a strong correlation between the H2 consumption from H2-TPR studies and the reported propene yield, as shown in Fig. 10.\nWhile the majority of investigations on ODH-CO2 Cr2O3 catalysts have focused on support modifications, the addition of a promotor has also been shown to be beneficial.\nYun et al. demonstrated that the addition of 0.5 wt% Ni to a 10 wt% CrOx/SBA-15 catalyst increased the propane and CO2 conversion, as well as the on-stream stability.264\nAfter 1 h on-stream, the Ni-promoted catalyst was 50% more active and the conversion and selectivity was almost maintained over 12 h on-stream.\nIn contrast, the less active unpromoted catalyst retained only half of the initial activity over the same time period.\nUsing three-stage H2-TPR experiments (where the catalyst is reduced twice under H2 and then re-oxidised in CO2 before the final H2-TPR program), the authors showed that the addition of Ni facilitated the re-oxidation of Cr during the reaction.\nThis is consistent with previously reported mechanisms of deactivation over Cr-based catalysts, although coking is also often reported to cause deactivation.\nInterestingly, the promoted catalyst was marginally more prone to coking.\nThis strongly suggests that overreduction of active Cr sites is the key deactivation mechanism over these catalysts.\nThere is a lot of potential to develop promoted Cr catalysts that could enhance the redox activity of the catalyst; precious metals including Pd and Pt are often supported on reducible supports for this purpose.265\nCrucially, it was found that above 0.5 wt% Ni, propane reforming was prevalent, which underlines the importance of appropriate loadings of promotors.\nO'Brien et al. investigated the effect of a Ru promoter to a 10 wt% CrOx/SiO2 catalyst.\nConsistent with Yun et al. it was shown that the propene formation rate was increased.\nA 1 wt% Ru loading was optimal and doubled the activity.\nInterestingly, this is approximately the same molar ratio reported as the optimum by Yun et al. for Ni-promoted CrOx/SBA-15 (Table 11, entry 14).\nAnother similarity was the propensity of reforming to dominate at high loadings (>1 wt%).\nThe enhanced stability seen in Ni-promoted Cr catalysts was not observed in this work and the activity could not be fully recovered after regeneration.\nConsequently, aggregation of Cr species was suggested as an additional deactivation mechanism in addition to coke formation and overreduction of Cr.\nRather than aid Cr re-oxidation in a one-step oxidative dehydrogenation, the authors concluded that the Ru promotes the RWGS reaction, which removes H2 and increases the equilibrium conversion of propane.\nHowever, the results of three-stage H2-TPR reactions indicated that Cr can be more easily oxidised in the presence of Ru, which suggests that Ru can participate in a similar role as Ni-promoted Cr catalysts.\nOverall supported chromium oxide catalysts represent one of the most active classes of ODH-CO2 catalysts, with STY values in the range of 222 molC3H6 kgcat1 h1.\nThe role of the support is simply to maximise the active Cr6+ surface area, rather than add any chemical functionality, hence this is the reason why chemically-unreactive supports such as SiO2 and activated carbon yield the most active CrOX catalysts.\nThe most significant barrier to commercial application is the poor on-stream stability exhibited by all chromium-based catalysts.\nWhile incremental improvements in the activity of Cr catalysts have been reported since their initial discovery, significant advances in catalyst stability have been relatively few.\nThe first study of Cr2O3-based catalysts for ODH-CO2 was reported by Takahara et al. in 1996 using Cr2O3 supported on SiO2, activated carbon (AC) or Al2O3.\nThe 5 wt% Cr2O3/SiO2 catalyst deactivated rapidly, retaining just 66% of its original activity after 4 h on-stream.\nThe stability was noted to the same with or without CO2 in the reactant feed.\nNot only did this study establish Cr2O3 as an active ODH-CO2 catalyst, it also captured one of the recurring themes in catalyst design for ODH-CO2: some catalysts are inhibited by the addition of CO2 while others perform much better.\nThe correct balance of acidic and basic sites is a key consideration in catalyst design.\nEqually, the ratio of carbon dioxide to propane is important to take in account, as it has kinetic and thermodynamic implications.\nThermodynamically, higher CO2:C3H8 ratios limit coke forming side-reactions.\nThe addition of CO2 in the dehydrogenation reaction has multiple effects: As discussed in Section 2, it facilitates the RWGS reaction which removes H2 from the system and shifts the thermodynamic equilibrium limit to favour propene production.\nAdditionally, CO2 can dissociate on the surface of a catalyst and provide O species to dehydrogenate propane directly.\nFinally, it can react with coke via the reverse-Boudouard reaction to produce CO, which can potentially extend the lifetime of the catalyst.\nThe role of the support is simply to maximise the active Cr6+ surface area, rather than add any chemical functionality, hence this is the reason why chemically-unreactive supports such as SiO2 and activated carbon yield the most active CrOX catalysts.\nThe most significant barrier to commercial application is the poor on-stream stability exhibited by all chromium-based catalysts.\nWhile incremental improvements in the activity of Cr catalysts have been reported since their initial discovery, significant advances in catalyst stability have been relatively few.\nThe addition of Al2O3 to ODH-CO2 catalysts is typically not beneficial.\nAlthough the addition of Al2O3 to ODH-CO2 catalysts is typically not beneficial, Chen et al. investigated spinel-type Ga2O3Al2O3 mixed oxides and showed that they can function as stable catalysts.\nThe origin of stability was linked to the low rate of coking associated with the spinel catalyst.\nUsing NH3-TPD analysis, the authors concluded that weak Lewis acid sites were conducive to high activity.\nThese acidbase properties most likely contribute to the enhanced stability as well; it is known that stronger acid sites promote oligomerisation pathways that produce coke.\nThe increased performance of Ga2O3/ZSM-48 was attributed to the abundance of weak and medium strength acid sites.\nThe low activity of Ga2O3/MgO and Ga2O3/SiO2 was ascribed to the absence of medium and strong acid sites.\nIn the Ga2O3/TiO2 catalyst, a significant proportion of the Ga (45%) was reduced.\nThis catalyst exhibited the highest propane conversion, but with a propene selectivity of 73% it did not result in the highest propene yield.\nThe origin of this induction period was found to be reduction of In2O3 to In0 nanoclusters, which suggests the active structure is more of a supported nanoparticle type catalyst than a mixed-metal oxide.\nThe basicity of the In/ZrO2 system was suggested to promote the RWGS reaction, which in turn boosted the ODH-CO2 activity.\nIt was found that 10 mol% Fe in CeO2 exhibited the highest propene yield.\nThe major side-reactions observed were dry reforming and cracking.\nThey showed that reforming pathways were more prevalent at higher CO2:C3H8 ratios, such as 2.5:1 and 5:1.\nDespite the low selectivity, the FeCeO2 catalysts exhibited a comparable STY to supported In2O3 and some Ga2O3 catalysts.\nThe number of studies on supported nanoparticle catalysts for ODH-CO2 are relatively few and those available indicate that this field of research has great potential.\nThe major challenge is in understanding and inhibiting side-reactions such as reforming, which are known to proceed over this class of catalyst, unlike in Cr- and Ga-based catalysts.\nCareful consideration of the nanostructure and composition has shown that the selectivity can be readily tuned to favour different pathways, and further investigation in this area may well be able to harness the high activity of supported nanoparticles as well as favour dehydrogenation pathways.\nDespite dozens of reports over several decades on Cr- and Ga- based catalysts, the improvements in catalyst performance have been incremental.\nThe knowledge gained from these studies on the importance of reducibility and the balance of acid and base sites should be applied to supported NP catalysts, which are a promising and somewhat neglected category of ODH-CO2 catalyst.\nThe specific requirements of catalyst design for each sub-reaction are discussed and we identify that, regardless of the method of dehydrogenation, the balance of acid and base sites on the catalyst surface is of paramount importance.\nThe development of an active, selective and stable catalyst is essential for dehydrogenation to be considered as a viable process in the near- and long-term future.\nIn the case of SC and coal-based MTO, this is unavoidable due to the nature of the feedstock. However, natural gas and propane can be produced from biomass.\nThe increased interest in direct propane dehydrogenation has been enhanced by the fall in propane price, which is the direct result of the discovery of vast shale gas reserves in North America.\nThe production of renewable green propane (also called bio-propane and bioLPG) is an emerging sector which is already being operated on a large scale.\nWith increasing pressure to source chemical feedstocks sustainably, we can expect that new interest will focus on renewable and green routes to the key platform chemicals currently required by modern society, and that green propane will play an important role in this.\nThe majority (86%) of filed patents are for DDH catalysts, followed by ODH-O2 (12%) and finally ODH-CO2 (2.4%).\nThe exact composition of the HGM is likely to include copper oxide and additional promotors such as MnO2, supported on α-Al2O3.\nThe importance of Al speciation in improving catalyst performance and stability was investigated by Shi et al.\nThe modification of Al2O3 with metal oxides, such as TiO2 has been undertaken with some promising results.\nThe role of Cu in the catalyst was to dilute the Pt species and promote desorption of propene, thereby enhancing selectivity.\nThe role of the subsurface was to facilitate the activation of propane on the surface.\nThe irreversible initial deactivation in the consecutive DDH cycles was attributed to either: (i) structural changes of active species (such as agglomeration), or (ii) collapse of pore structure.\nThe positive effect was attributed to the promoters ability to block the sites responsible for coke formation and negligible contribution to undesirable secondary reactions by the additional acid sites generated by the P-based modifier.\nThe authors attributed this enhanced performance to a high dispersion of Cr species, moderate acidity and strong metalsupport interactions in the CrOx/H-ZSM-5(260) catalyst.\nThe authors attributed high Ga/Al ratios (>0.5) with the formation of additional GaxOy clusters which negatively affected the dehydrogenation rate and thus catalytic performance.\nThe activity is dependent on the bond strength of the VOsupport bond. Therefore, it is expected that catalyst performance is affected when different supports, such as SiO2, Al2O3 and ZrO2 are utilised.", "English": "The physicochemical properties of catalysts, including chemical qualities and morphological characteristics, significantly influence their performance in dehydrogenation reactions. The crystallization temperature of the support directly affects the catalytic performance of VOx/Al2O3 catalysts by increasing Lewis acid sites and influencing the distribution of different surface V species. P modification can decrease the degree of VOx polymerization, enhancing catalyst stability and activity. Mg modification can improve catalytic performance and anti-coking capability by dispersing V2O5 crystallites and increasing active V3+ species. Gelation and calcination temperatures also impact the catalytic performance of VOx/SiO2 catalysts in terms of propane conversion, propene selectivity, and yield of propene. Dealuminated beta zeolites (Si-beta) are promising catalyst supports due to their high surface area and thermal stability, and the initial propane conversion linearly increases with the amount of acid sites. VOx/ZrO2 is more active than VOx/Al2O3 and pure ZrO2 due to the facile reduction of VO, VOV, and VOZr bonds, producing higher proportions of the active V3+ species. The balance of acid and base sites on the catalyst surface is crucial for all dehydrogenation methods. The development of an active, selective, and stable catalyst is essential for dehydrogenation to be considered a viable process in the future. Support modification strategies can optimize these properties for enhanced catalytic efficiency and selectivity. Using supports with ordered mesoporosity and moderate surface acidity can aid mass transfer and avoid undesirable secondary reactions. Promoting elements can cause beneficial geometric and electronic effects on both the supports and active species. However, environmental and safety concerns exist in the preparation, usage, and disposal of certain catalysts due to their toxicity. Ga catalysts, while less active than Pt and Cr catalysts, have the advantage of being benign and inexpensive. The nature of the support is essential for vanadium-based catalysts, as the metalsupport interactions affect the resultant catalyst performance. The activity is dependent on the bond strength of the VOsupport bond, and catalyst performance is affected by different supports.", "Chinese": "所有答案结果中的汇总中文答案 1", "Doi": "10.1039/D1GC03700E"},

The equilibrium conversion of alkanes increases with temperature, but alkene selectivity decreases due to an increased tendency toward dehydrocyclization/aromatisation, thermal cracking, and coke formation. The extent of PtSn interactions depends on the impregnation sequence of Pt and Sn precursors on the support material. The framework of microporous zeolites exerts dispersive forces on reactant molecules, which depend on the shape, channel, and cavity of the framework. The nature and density of active sites also influence the framework dispersion forces. Recent reports have shown that the strong electrostatic field between protons or exchanged metal ions and basic oxygen species can enhance and/or induce polarization of bonds in hydrocarbon adsorbates. This polarization effect can be viewed as an intermediate condition to hydride abstraction, an important elementary step in CH activation. The polarizing effect increases with increasing charge magnitude and ionic radius of the alkane polarizing cations. The choice of cations should be such that they exhibit no catalytic effects on the target alkene products at the reaction condition. It may be beneficial to create a CH polarization effect on the zeolite framework by appropriate modification of framework atoms. Active sites are usually created on the zeolite frameworks. The active sites of the bimolecular pathway are formed in situ and are made up of an alkyl carbenium ion ionically held to the zeolite framework oxygen ion. The active sites of the unimolecular pathway are the charge balancing protons of the zeolite framework. A proton and a carbenium ion are electrophilic or Lewis acid species, and the two pathways essentially involve electrophilic CH activation. The exchanged metal ions in zeolites are held ionically by one or more basic oxygen atoms. Different species have been suggested, depending on the density of the cation exchange site of the zeolite and the method of introduction of the metals. High alkene selectivities are obtained on the H-ZSM-5 when exchangeable protons are rigorously replaced by Zn and Ga. The CH activation on the OZn2+O site can be described by a Lewis base-assisted deprotonation mechanism, accompanied by conversion of the Lewis base site to a conjugate Bronsted acid site. The OGa+ site, however, activates the CH bond via oxidative addition without a protonic site intermediate. A protonic site intermediate increases the tendency of side reactions on the Zn-exchanged H-ZSM-5 relative to the Ga counterpart. The elementary steps of CH activation on OGa+ reveal that a redox cycle at the metal center is required for catalytic CH activation via the oxidative addition mechanism. However, under alkane dehydrogenation reaction conditions, the OZn2+O sites can undergo a reversible Zn2+/Zn redox process, increasing the availability of undesired protonic site intermediates. Zn-exchanged H-ZSM-5 prepared by conventional ion-exchange methods contain a significant percentage of unexchanged proton sites, leading to lower alkene selectivity of the catalyst. Another strategy to enhance alkene selectivity is by controlling the strength of the proton sites. The acidity of the sites depends on the nature of the trivalent cation of the zeolite framework. Proton sites in borosilicate zeolites are weaker than those of aluminosilicate, and thus higher alkene selectivity is expected for alkane dehydrogenation over Zn/H[B]-ZSM-5 compared to Zn/H[Al]-ZSM-5. However, Zn/H[B]-ZSM-5 shows no activity for propane dehydrogenation. The desired weaker acidity of the proton sites of Zn/H[B]-ZSM-5 requires weaker basicity of the oxygen atoms in the zeolite framework. This reduced basicity of the oxygen atoms is not sufficiently polarizing to complement the exchanged Zn2+ in CH bond cleavage. Elimination of the proton sites of zeolites is critical for obtaining a high alkene selectivity and stability in dehydrogenation catalysts. Pt is the most versatile noble metal catalyst for alkane reactions, often justified by its higher activity, stability, and selectivity for these reactions compared to less expensive alternative transition metals. However, rapid catalyst deactivation due to coke formation remains a challenge even when using a Pt-based catalyst for dehydrogenation of light alkanes. The presence of acid (Bronsted and Lewis) sites on the supports promotes readsorption, oligomerization, and aromatization of alkenes. Promotion of Pt with metals, such as Sn, Ga, Zn, Re, etc., improves catalyst stability, but also leads to faster deactivation rates than Pt/Na[Fe]-ZSM-5. The role of potassium in commercial Cr and Pt-based dehydrogenation catalysts is to minimize the undesired influence of protonic sites on alkene selectivity. The nature and role of surface oxygen species become more evident. The electronic promotion effect of Sn is in line with the oxidative addition CH activation mechanism. However, the Lewis base-assisted deprotonation mechanism could also explain the proposed CH activation on Cr-based catalysts. A recent report suggests that a porous copper-aluminum framework material (stabilized by metal oxide) has better performance (activity/selectivity/stability) for propane dehydrogenation than a PtSn/Al2O3. The Lewis base-assisted deprotonation mechanism may be invoked here, and the redox property of the metal center is likely to play a role in achieving propane dehydrogenation at 350 C. This should constitute the future research direction for non-oxidative dehydrogenation of lower alkanes.", "Chinese": "催化剂的物理化学性质，包括化学品质（如酸强度和稳定性）和形态特征，对脱氢反应的性能有重大影响。随着温度的升高，烷烃的平衡转化率增加，但由于脱氢环化/芳构化、热裂解和焦炭形成的倾向增加，烯烃的选择性降低。PtSn相互作用的程度取决于Pt和Sn前体在支撑材料上的浸渍顺序。微孔沸石框架对反应物分子施加的分散力取决于框架的形状、通道和腔体。活性位点的性质和密度也影响框架的分散力。最近的报告表明，质子或交换金属离子与基本氧物种之间的强静电场可以增强和/或诱导烃吸附物中键的极化。这种极化效应可以视为向氢化物抽离过渡的中间条件，这是CH活化的重要基本步骤。极化效应随电荷大小和离子半径的增加而增加。选择的阳离子应确保在反应条件下对目标烯烃产品没有催化作用。在沸石框架上创造CH极化效应可能是有益的，这可以通过适当修改框架原子来实现。活性位点通常在沸石框架上创建。双分子途径的活性位点是原位形成的，由离子结合到沸石框架氧离子的烷基卡宾离子组成。单分子途径的活性位点是沸石框架的质子平衡电荷。质子和卡宾离子是亲电性或路易斯酸性物种，两种途径本质上涉及亲电性CH活化。沸石中交换的金属离子通过一个或多个基本氧原子离子结合。根据沸石的阳离子交换位点密度和金属的引入方法，提出了不同的物种。当可交换的质子被严格替换为Zn和Ga时，H-ZSM-5获得了高烯烃选择性。OZn2+O位点上的CH活化可以通过路易斯碱辅助脱质子机制来描述，伴随路易斯碱位点转化为共轭布龙斯特酸位点。然而，OGa+位点通过氧化加成而不是质子位点中间体活化CH键。质子位点中间体增加了Zn交换的H-ZSM-5相对于Ga对应物的副反应倾向。OGa+的CH活化基本步骤揭示，金属中心的氧化还原循环是通过氧化加成机制催化CH活化所必需的。然而，在烷烃脱氢反应条件下，OZn2+O位点可以经历可逆的Zn2+/Zn氧化还原过程，增加了不希望的质子位点中间体的可用性。通过传统离子交换方法制备的Zn交换H-ZSM-5含有大量未交换的质子位点，导致催化剂的烯烃选择性降低。另一种增强烯烃选择性的策略是控制质子位点的强度。位点的酸性取决于沸石框架中三价阳离子的性质。硼硅酸盐沸石中的质子位点比铝硅酸盐弱，因此预计Zn/H[B]-ZSM-5在烷烃脱氢中的烯烃选择性高于Zn/H[Al]-ZSM-5。然而，Zn/H[B]-ZSM-5在丙烷脱氢中没有活性。Zn/H[B]-ZSM-5中所需较弱的质子位点酸性需要沸石框架中氧原子的较弱碱性。这种氧原子碱性的降低不足以补充交换的Zn2+在CH键断裂中的作用。消除沸石的质子位点对于获得高烯烃选择性和脱氢催化剂的稳定性至关重要。Pt是烷烃反应中最通用的贵金属催化剂，通常因其在这些反应中的较高活性、稳定性和选择性而被证明是合理的，与成本较低的替代过渡金属相比。然而，即使使用Pt基催化剂进行轻烷烃脱氢，由于焦炭形成导致的催化剂失活速度仍然很快。支持物上的酸（布龙斯特和路易斯）位点促进了烯烃的再吸附、寡聚化和芳构化。Pt与Sn、Ga、Zn、Re等金属的促进提高了催化剂的稳定性，但与Pt/Na[Fe]-ZSM-5相比，失活速度也更快。商业Cr和Pt基脱氢催化剂中钾的作用是最大限度地减少质子位点对烯烃选择性的不利影响。表面氧物种的性质和作用变得更加明显。Sn的电子促进效应与氧化加成CH活化机制一致。然而，路易斯碱辅助脱质子机制也可以解释在Cr基催化剂上提出的CH活化。最近的一份报告表明，一种多孔铜铝框架材料（由金属氧化物稳定）在丙烷脱氢中的性能（活性/选择性/稳定性）优于PtSn/Al2O3。可以在此处调用路易斯碱辅助脱质子机制，金属中心的氧化还原性质可能在实现350°C下的丙烷脱氢中发挥作用。这应该是非氧化脱氢较低烷烃的未来研究方向。", "Doi": "10.1016/j.fuproc.2016.04.016"},

site structures and dehydrogenation mechanisms are followed in the PDH process from a fundamental perspective.\n          In this section, the active sites, dehydrogenation pathways and deactivation mechanisms on Pt-based and representative metal oxide-based catalysts would be clarified.\n          The coordination saturated Pt atoms are more selective for propane dehydrogenation, while the coordinatively unsaturated Pt atoms will catalyze the side reactions, such as CC breaking and deep dehydrogenation, resulting in the formation of carbon deposits.\n          The adsorption configuration and strength of propylene can be both greatly perturbed by surface structures, coke formation is inherently governed by the surface geometric and electronic structures, and thus the construction of specific reaction ensembles is important.\n          Tuning the support's acidity and coke mobility can also inhibit the coke formation.\n          The effective strategies for inhibiting coke are summarized as follows.\n          Geometric separation: Previous research studies have shown that separating the active metal components could inhibit the structure-sensitive side reactions with improved propylene selectivity.\n          Electron richness: A high electron density of Pt particles is beneficial to weaken Pt(CC) bonds, inhibit coke precursors, and suppress deep

coke on acidic supports can also suppress the diffusion of reactive molecules.\n          Cofeeding streams: In addition to the modulation of catalyst structures and the properties of supports, changes in reaction conditions by cofeeding streams, such as H2, and CO2, can also have a positive effect on coke elimination.\n          Enhancing oxygen mobility: The oxidation of the adsorbed surface carbonaceous species can help eliminate the coke deposition over supported metals and thus is beneficial to the improvement of catalytic stability.\n          Coke transfer: In addition to

supports with high surface area and uniform pore size distribution are preferred.\n          Some alkaline metals, such as Li, Na, and K, can help poison the strong acid sites and avoid the coke deposition on the Al2O3 surface.\n          Additionally, doping Mg into Al2O3 forms a stable spinel phase.\n          An-Hui Lu and coworkers indicated that Al2O3 nanosheets with abundant penta-coordinate Al atoms have a strong metalsupport interaction owing to their capacity for anchoring Pt atoms, which accounts for their high stability.\n          Due to the weak interaction between

This crystal structure has a high concentration of weak Lewis acid sites (coordinatively unsaturated tetrahedral ones on the surface of the material), which are deemed to be centers of dehydrogenation activity.\n          The assignment of Lewis acid sites as the active species was substantiated by Chen et al., who, by relating the results of NH3-TPD measurements with activity data for different GaxAl10xO15 mixed oxides, showed that a high concentration of Lewis acid groups in the form of coordinatively unsaturated tetrahedral Ga3+ cations is a prerequisite for dehydrogenation activity.\n          Xu et al. reported dehydrogenation activity on both Lewis and Brnsted acid sites on GaO3/H-ZSM-5. A zeolitic support displaying a low concentration of medium and strong acid sites and a relatively high concentration of weak acid sites was found to lead to the most active and stable catalyst.\n          Michorczyk et al. concluded that acidic groups catalyze the reaction after observing that promotion with a base, such as potassium, resulted in a decrease in activity.\n          The structure of the support is also important, as a mesoporous GaAl mixed oxide exhibited an increased resistance to catalyst coking.\n          The function of K was to reduce coke formation by poisoning Brnsted acid sites.\n          Pt is believed to act as a promoter for the GaOx. Indeed, albeit 1000 ppm Pt/Al2O3 was found to be virtually inactive, 1000 ppm of Pt in combination with 3 wt % Ga afforded conversions close to the equilibrium and an propylene selectivity <95%.\n          The role of Pt is to assist hydrogen desorption, which facilitates the regeneration of the gallium hydride hydroxide species.\n          The exact nature of the active sites in Ga-based dehydrogenation catalysts is still under debate.\n          The chemistry of molybdenum oxide is comparable to that of vanadium oxide, as Mo can be present as MoOx monomers, polymers, or MoO3 crystallites, depending on the molybdenum loading, the type of support used, and catalyst preparation conditions.\n          The reducibility of the catalyst with hydrogen prior to reaction increases conversion, although selectivity decreases due to the formation of acid sites.\n          The chemistry of molybdenum oxide is comparable to that of vanadium oxide, as Mo can be present as MoOx monomers, polymers, or MoO3 crystallites, depending on the molybdenum loading, the type of support used, and catalyst preparation conditions.\n          The reducibility of the catalyst with hydrogen prior to reaction increases conversion, although selectivity decreases due to the formation of acid sites.\n          The chemistry of molybdenum oxide is comparable to that of vanadium oxide, as Mo can be present as MoOx monomers, polymers, or MoO3 crystallites, depending on the molybdenum loading, the type of support used, and catalyst preparation conditions.\n          The reducibility of the catalyst with hydrogen prior to reaction increases conversion, although selectivity decreases due to the formation of acid sites.\n          The chemistry of molybdenum oxide is comparable to that of vanadium oxide, as Mo can be present as MoOx monomers, polymers, or MoO3 crystallites, depending on the molybdenum loading, the type of support used, and catalyst preparation conditions.\n          The reducibility of the catalyst with hydrogen prior to reaction increases conversion, although selectivity decreases due to the formation of acid sites.\n          The chemistry of molybdenum oxide is comparable to that of vanadium oxide, as Mo can be present as MoOx monomers, polymers, or MoO3 crystallites, depending on the molybdenum loading, the type of support used, and catalyst preparation conditions.\n          The reducibility of the catalyst with hydrogen prior to reaction increases conversion, although selectivity decreases due to the formation of acid sites.\n          The chemistry of molybdenum oxide is comparable to that of vanadium oxide, as Mo can be present as MoOx monomers, polymers, or MoO3 crystallites, depending on the molybdenum loading, the type of support used, and catalyst preparation conditions.\n          The reducibility of the catalyst with hydrogen prior to reaction increases conversion, although selectivity decreases due to the formation of acid sites.\n          The chemistry of molybdenum oxide is comparable to that of vanadium oxide, as Mo can be present as MoOx monomers, polymers, or MoO3 crystallites, depending on the molybdenum loading, the type of support used, and catalyst preparation conditions.\n          The reducibility of the catalyst with hydrogen prior to reaction increases conversion, although selectivity decreases due to the formation of acid sites.\n          Alumina is by far the most common support, and a variety of methods to produce chromiaalumina catalysts have been investigated.\n          The nature of the support is important not only because it governs the mechanical properties of the catalyst, but also because the interaction of the carrier with the active phase can have a profound impact on catalyst activity and selectivity.\n          Albeit selectivity has been found to be insensitive to chromium loading, it does change over time.\n          The use of zirconia as an alternative support has also been investigated.\n          The use of silica as the support in chromia-based dehydrogenation catalysts requires a relative high surface area to stabilize Cr6+ sites.\n          CrMgAl and CrMg mixed oxides prepared using layered double hydroxide (LDH) precursors have been studied as catalysts for the nonoxidative dehydrogenation of ethane.\n          Finally, the study of porous chromia-pillared α-zirconium phosphate materials has been particularly informative with regards to the influence that acidity has on catalytic behavior.\n          The surface area-to-metal loading ratio determines which species will form. Indeed, Wu et al. reported that monomeric species are predominantly present below 1.2 V/nm2, polymeric vanadium species prevail between 1.2 and 4.4 V/nm2, and crystalline V2O5 species preponderate at even higher loadings.\n          On the one hand, the presence of hydroxyl groups on the surface of the support is important to obtain a well-dispersed catalyst, as OH groups serve as anchoring sites for the vanadium precursors used to prepare these catalysts. On the other hand, acid sites are detrimental for catalyst performance, because they facilitate cracking and induce coke formation.\n          Alumina is commonly used as a support for vanadium oxide catalysts, although Sokolov et al. concluded through testing a wide range of Si- and Al-based supports that using silica to dope the alumina support provides beneficial effects on catalyst stability and activity.\n          Furthermore, as was shown by Harlin et al., the performance of supported vanadium catalysts can be improved through the addition of MgO, either as a promoter or as a component of a mixed oxide. According to these workers, the increase in dehydrogenation selectivity stems from the basic nature of MgO, resulting in reduced coke formation.\n          The reducibility of the vanadium species depends on their molecular structure, VOV and VO bonds being more easily reduced than VO-support bonds.\n          Prior to reaction, the vanadium in these catalysts is generally present as V5+.

The interaction between the support and the active phase can also alter the electronic properties of the catalyst, which can further enhance its performance. Support modification strategies, such as doping with alkali metals or using mixed oxides, can optimize these properties for enhanced catalytic efficiency and selectivity.

For example, the surface area-to-metal loading ratio determines the formation of different vanadium species, which affects the catalytic activity. The reducibility of vanadium species also influences the catalytic performance. The addition of MgO can improve the selectivity of vanadium-based catalysts by reducing coke formation. Using silica to dope alumina support can enhance the stability and activity of vanadium oxide catalysts. The type of support and preparation conditions can affect the formation of molybdenum oxide species. Hydrogen reduction can increase conversion but decrease selectivity due to the formation of acid sites. The structure of the support, such as mesoporous GaAl mixed oxide, can increase the resistance to catalyst coking. Poisoning Brnsted acid sites with K can reduce coke formation. Alumina is the most common support, and various methods have been explored to produce chromia-alumina catalysts. The choice of support can also influence the stability and dispersion of the active phase, which in turn affects the catalytic efficiency and selectivity. For example, zirconia has been investigated as an alternative support due to its low surface acidity and enhanced sintering resistance, which can improve the performance of chromia-based catalysts. The acidity of the support can also play a role in catalytic behavior, as demonstrated by the study of porous chromia-pillared α-zirconium phosphate materials. Support modification strategies, such as doping with alkali metals or using mixed oxides, can optimize these properties for enhanced catalytic efficiency and selectivity. For instance, doping with alkali metals can stabilize the structure of the support, reduce surface acidity, and increase the number of active sites. Using mixed oxides can also improve the thermal stability and coking resistance of the catalysts. The surface area-to-metal loading ratio determines the formation of monomeric, polymeric, or crystalline vanadium species on the catalyst. Hydroxyl groups on the support surface are important for anchoring vanadium precursors, while acid sites are detrimental to catalyst performance. Silica doping of alumina support can improve catalyst stability and activity. Addition of MgO can improve dehydrogenation selectivity by reducing coke formation. The reducibility of vanadium species depends on their molecular structure. Molybdenum oxide can exist as monomers, polymers, or crystallites, depending on loading, support, and preparation conditions. Optimal molybdenum oxide activity is achieved with monolayer coverage on alumina. Hydrogen reduction of molybdenum oxide catalyst increases conversion but decreases selectivity. Ga2O3 polymorphs, particularly β-Ga2O3, have high concentration of weak Lewis acid sites for dehydrogenation activity. Coordinatively unsaturated tetrahedral Ga3+ cations are crucial for dehydrogenation activity. High concentration of Lewis acid groups in the form of Ga3+ cations is necessary for dehydrogenation activity. Zeolitic support with low medium and strong acid sites and high weak acid sites leads to most active and stable GaO3/H-ZSM-5 catalyst. Promotion with a base like potassium decreases activity, indicating acidic groups catalyze the reaction. Mesoporous GaAl mixed oxide has increased resistance to coking. Potassium reduces coke formation by poisoning Brnsted acid sites. Platinum acts as a promoter for GaOx, enhancing conversion and selectivity. Platinum assists hydrogen desorption, facilitating regeneration of gallium hydride hydroxide species. The nature of active sites in Ga-based dehydrogenation catalysts is still under debate. Molybdenum oxide can exist as monomers, polymers, or crystallites, depending on loading, support, and preparation conditions. Hydrogen reduction of catalyst increases conversion but decreases selectivity due to acid site formation. The physicochemical properties of catalysts, including chemical qualities and morphological characteristics, significantly influence their performance in dehydrogenation reactions. Alumina is the most common support, and its interaction with the active phase can profoundly impact catalyst activity and selectivity. Noble metals, particularly platinum, are preferred for their superior activation of paraffinic CH bonds and low activity for CC cleavage. The addition of alkaline metals like lithium, sodium, and potassium can poison acid sites on the support, suppressing coke formation. Zirconia is an alternative support that has been investigated, offering low surface acidity and enhanced sintering resistance. Silica requires a high surface area to stabilize Cr6+ sites. Mixed oxides prepared using layered double hydroxide precursors have also been studied for nonoxidative dehydrogenation reactions. The acidity of the support material, such as in chromia-pillared α-zirconium phosphate, can significantly affect catalytic behavior. The physicochemical properties of catalysts, including chemical qualities and morphological characteristics, significantly influence their performance in dehydrogenation reactions. The surface area-to-metal loading ratio determines the formation of different vanadium species, which affects the catalytic activity. The presence of hydroxyl groups on the support surface is crucial for anchoring vanadium precursors, while large V2O5 crystallites are inactive in dehydrogenation. The reducibility of vanadium species depends on their molecular structure, and the reduction of the catalyst by the hydrocarbon feed results in the formation of V4+ and V3+. Initially, deactivation is caused by the strong adsorption of reactants on the active sites and coke deposition. The calcination of the catalyst can remove coke but may further deactivate the catalyst due to the formation of larger V2O5 crystallites or mixed oxides. V2O5 crystallites can revert to active polymeric vanadium species under certain conditions. The addition of CO2 can have a beneficial effect on the catalyst by removing acid sites, facilitating coke gasification, and promoting hydrogen removal. The effect of CO2 depends on the catalyst support, with relatively weak basic sites on activated carbon support facilitating the reverse water gas shift reaction, while strong basic sites on Al2O3 and ZnO2 can be poisoned by CO2. Using silica to dope the alumina support can improve catalyst stability and activity. The addition of MgO can improve the performance of supported vanadium catalysts by reducing coke formation. The physicochemical properties of catalysts, including chemical qualities and morphological characteristics, significantly influence their performance in dehydrogenation reactions. The nature of the support is crucial as it not only determines the mechanical properties of the catalyst but also affects the interaction between the carrier and the active phase, which can profoundly impact catalyst activity and selectivity. For instance, alumina is the most common support, and the method of producing chromia-alumina catalysts can vary, affecting the catalyst's performance. The choice of support can also influence the catalytic activity, with different supports leading to varying orders of activity based on conversion and yield. Zirconia, as an alternative support, has been investigated for its low surface acidity and enhanced sintering resistance. Silica requires a high surface area to stabilize Cr6+ sites, and mixed oxides prepared using layered double hydroxide precursors have been studied for their catalytic properties in dehydrogenation reactions. The acidity of the support, as seen in chromia-pillared α-zirconium phosphate materials, can also influence catalytic behavior, with strong acid sites affecting cracking reactions and medium strength acid sites impacting dehydrogenation reactions. Support modification strategies can be employed to optimize the properties of catalysts for enhanced catalytic efficiency and selectivity. For example, doping alumina-based dehydrogenation catalysts with alkali ions can effectively poison undesirable acid sites, improving selectivity. Using zirconia as a support can prevent the formation of mixed oxides and offer higher thermal stability and surface area. Silica, with its high surface area, can stabilize Cr6+ sites, while mixed oxides prepared using layered double hydroxide precursors can provide improved coking resistance and thermal stability against sintering. Understanding the role of acidity in catalytic behavior can also guide the modification of supports to favor dehydrogenation reactions over cracking reactions. The physicochemical properties of catalysts, including chemical qualities and morphological characteristics, significantly influence their performance in dehydrogenation reactions. For instance, the nature of the support material, such as alumina, zirconia, or silica, can affect the dispersion and stability of the active phase, thereby impacting the catalytic activity and selectivity.

The stability and tolerance to carbon deposits of Zr-Al-Beta promoted by alkali-metal ions were demonstrated. The modification of alkali-metal ions on both Lewis acid sites and Brnsted acid sites in Zr-Al-Beta was evidenced by XPS and FT-IR spectroscopy. The untreated materials displayed poor product selectivity and high coke deposit in the Meerwein-Ponndorf-Verley reduction of furfural and isopropanol; however, the treatment of alkali-metal ions promoted their catalytic performance with improved recalcitrance to deactivation and coking significantly. The type of alkali-metal ions and the concentration of alkaline solution influenced the catalytic performance, which were found to correlate to the acidity and textual properties. The optimum reaction result (97.3% yield of furfuryl alcohol at 99.6% conversion of furfural) can be obtained on 0.025 M-Na+-Zr-Al-Beta with high tolerance to the furfural concentration. Support modification strategies can be employed to optimize these properties for enhanced catalytic efficiency and selectivity by tuning and normalizing the various acidic sites of zeolites.

The exploitation of an efficient PDH catalyst based on HZSM-5 zeolite to achieve both high selectivity and stability is still a challenge. In zeolite supported catalysts, zeolite provides a special environment for catalytic reactions, including channel confinement effects, acidic sites, and electron transfer. Acidic sites in zeolites play a key role in determining the catalytic performance of zeolite catalysts in alkane conversion.

This in turn affected the distribution of different surface V species.\nGu et al. reported that P modification could greatly influence the structure and activity of VOx/Al2O3 catalysts.142 More specifically, P modification decreased the degree of VOx polymerization, which had positive implications on the catalyst stability, as evidenced by the retention of high activity (ca. 45% propane conversion) after an 8 h DDH reaction in all P-modified catalysts.\nSubsequent studies on a VOx/Al2O3 catalysts (with 12 wt% V loading) modified with Mg revealed the anti-coking capability and improved catalytic performance evident through propene yields of 1927% over a 6 h DDH reaction.143 It was found that the dispersing action of Mg modification to V2O5 crystallites and an increase in active V3+ species reduced the amount and polymerization of coke deposits.\nThe concentration of dopant atoms, and the temperature of reduction were other contributing factors that affected the catalytic behaviour for ZrO2-based catalysts.3 Numerous binary YZrOx and LaZrOx-based catalysts displayed high activity, selectivity and stability as well as comparable performance to KCrOx/Al2O3 catalysts over the course of 60 DDH cycles at 550 C, 600 C and 625 C under industrially relevant conditions. The experimental parameters had a beneficial effect on the concentration of Zrcus4+ ions, and the concentration of surface lattice oxygen, which in tandem play an active role in propane activation.\nThe specific requirements of catalyst design for each sub-reaction are discussed and we identify that, regardless of the method of dehydrogenation, the balance of acid and base sites on the catalyst surface is of paramount importance.\nThe development of an active, selective and stable catalyst is essential for dehydrogenation to be considered as a viable process in the near- and long-term future.\nThe exact composition of the HGM is likely to include copper oxide and additional promotors such as MnO2, supported on α-Al2O3.\nThe role of Cu in the catalyst was to dilute the Pt species and promote desorption of propene, thereby enhancing selectivity.\nThe h-BN nanosheets provided abundant stacking fault edges terminated with BO defects that are associated with unpaired electrons, which strongly interact with active metal species, helping to strengthen the interaction between the metal and support.\nThe preparation of new catalysts with simultaneously enhanced activity, selectivity and stability is the ultimate goal.\nThe modification of Al2O3 with metal oxides, such as TiO2 has been undertaken with some promising results.\nThe enhanced performance was ascribed to electron transfer and acid site modulation effects resulting in changes to the adsorption properties of Pt.\nThe enhanced performance and stability was attributed to ultra-small, uniformly dispersed particles, ranging in size from 1.0 to 1.4 nm, consistent with previous studies that observed structure-sensitivity.\nThe role of the subsurface was to facilitate the activation of propane on the surface.\nThe role of the support is simply to maximise the active Cr6+ surface area, rather than add any chemical functionality, hence this is the reason why chemically-unreactive supports such as SiO2 and activated carbon yield the most active CrOX catalysts.\nThe most significant barrier to commercial application is the poor on-stream stability exhibited by all chromium-based catalysts.\nThe stability was improved in the presence of CO2 (compared to DDH); ca. 74% of the original activity was retained after 10 h on-stream, which is relatively good compared to Ga- and Cr-based catalysts.\nThe origin of stability was linked to the low rate of coking associated with the spinel catalyst.\nThe role of CO2 in ODH-CO2 is to assist the above equilibrium by removing H2via the RWGS reaction.\nThe origin of this induction period was found to be reduction of In2O3 to In0 nanoclusters, which suggests the active structure is more of a supported nanoparticle type catalyst than a mixed-metal oxide.\nThe basicity of the In/ZrO2 system was suggested to promote the RWGS reaction, which in turn boosted the ODH-CO2 activity.\nThe initial STY of this catalyst was 10.7 molC3H6 kgcat1 h1 (Table 13, entry 4), which is amongst the most active reported to date, but requires significant improvements to its on-stream stability.\nDespite the low selectivity, the FeCeO2 catalysts exhibited a comparable STY to supported In2O3 (Table 13) and some Ga2O3 catalysts (Table 12).\nThe major side-reactions observed were dry reforming and cracking.\nThe cationanion double hydrolysis approach (CADH), used for the synthesis of mesoporous Al2O3 with high surface area and a pure γ-Al2O3 phase, was undertaken with the crystallisation temperature varied between 25120 C.141 It was found that the crystallisation temperature of the support directly influenced the catalytic performance of the VOx/Al2O3 catalysts, which was a consequence of the increase in Lewis acid sites with increasing crystallization temperatures up to 100 C. This in turn affected the distribution of different surface V species.\nThe authors concluded that the relative proportions of V3+, V4+ and V5+ species present on the catalyst surface were affected by V loading and at the optimal loading of 12 wt%, a high concentration of isolated V3+ species was detected.\nGu et al. reported that P modification could greatly influence the structure and activity of VOx/Al2O3 catalysts.142 More specifically, P modification decreased the degree of VOx polymerization, which had positive implications on the catalyst stability, as evidenced by the retention of high activity (ca. 45% propane conversion) after an 8 h DDH reaction in all P-modified catalysts.\nThe combined and synergistic effect of the surface acidity modifications, their influence on the active V3+ species, and weakened metalsupport interactions facilitated desorption of propene and inhibited the deep dehydrogenation that leads to coke precursors.\nSubsequent studies on a VOx/Al2O3 catalysts (with 12 wt% V loading) modified with Mg revealed the anti-coking capability and improved catalytic performance evident through propene yields of 1927% over a 6 h DDH reaction.143 It was found that the dispersing action of Mg modification to V2O5 crystallites and an increase in active V3+ species reduced the amount and polymerization of coke deposits.\nThe highest STY achieved was 7.8 molC3H6 kg1cat h1 (Table 6, entry 7).\nThe moderate vanadium doping level was conducive to highly dispersed vanadium species in the form of isolated and low-polymerized VOx species.\nHighly dispersed and stable VOx species, and an absence of V2O5 crystallites, were conducive to high catalytic activity and stability.\nThe STY was 6.2 molC3H6 kg1cat h1 (Table 6, entry 5), due to the low GHSV so while the catalyst achieved high selectivity at reasonable propane conversion, it was not as intrinsically active as other supported VOx catalysts.\nThe most active catalyst, V/Si-beta (having 3 wt% V loading) displayed an initial propene yield of 33.4% and retained activity over multiple dehydrogenationregeneration cycles.\nThe STY was 4.4 molC3H6 kg1cat h1 (Table 6, entry 6), which is 56 times less active than the most active VOx catalysts reported to date, suggesting that Si-beta does not facilitate a high concentration of active V sites.\nIt was found that VOx/ZrO2 is approximately five times more active than VOx/Al2O3 and pure ZrO2, exhibiting a STY of 9.2 molC3H6 kg1cat h1 (Table 6, entry 2).\nThe authors proposed that the enhanced performance of VOx/ZrO2 results from the facile reduction of VO, VOV and VOZr bonds, thus producing higher proportions of the active V3+ species.\nFor the most active catalyst, with 8 wt% V loading, the initial yield of propene increased from 24% at 550 C to 28% at 575 C with a negligible (<1%) increase at 600 C.\nThis corresponded to a STY of 24 molC3H6 kg1cat h1 (Table 6, entry 3), which is one of the most active VOx-based catalysts reported.\nThe STY of ZrO2 without VOx is actually much higher than in the current work.\nThe most active V species has been identified, the relative proportion and stability of this surface V species can be tuned by varying the preparation method.\nThe role of the other V species on the DDH reaction remains unclear so further work to elucidate this could yield more active and stable DDH catalysts.\nThe range in performance of V-based catalysts varies quite significantly, with the most active catalysts exhibiting STYs that are around 34 time less active than the most active Pt catalysts.\nThe specific requirements of catalyst design for each sub-reaction are discussed and we identify that, regardless of the method of dehydrogenation, the balance of acid and base sites on the catalyst surface is of paramount importance.\nThe development of an active, selective and stable catalyst is essential for dehydrogenation to be considered as a viable process in the near- and long-term future.\nIn the case of SC and coal-based MTO, this is unavoidable due to the nature of the feedstock. However, natural gas and propane can be produced from biomass. In these cases, the feedstock is renewable and so these processes are potentially much more sustainable than when using fossil fuels.\nThe majority of analyses focus on well-established processes, where more information and data are available, but no such analyses were found for oxidative dehydrogenation.\nThe thermodynamic tendency to form undesirable by-products means that such reactions must be carefully kinetically controlled. Careful catalyst design can inhibit and even switch-off some of these side-reactions, as will be discussed in the subsequent sections.\nThe exact composition of the HGM is likely to include copper oxide and additional promotors such as MnO2, supported on α-Al2O3.\nThe role of Cu in the catalyst was to dilute the Pt species and promote desorption of propene, thereby enhancing selectivity.\nThe role of the subsurface was to facilitate the activation of propane on the surface.\nThe preparation strategy could greatly influence the structure of Ga/SiO2 catalysts.\nThe preparation of GaRh supported catalytically active liquid metal solutions.\nThe GaPt alloy melts at temperatures between 270 C and 330 C.\nThe activity is dependent on the bond strength of the VOsupport bond.\nThe metalsupport (VOsupport) interactions affect the resultant catalyst performance.\nThe catalyst deactivated quickly due to carbon deposition, but retained its initial activity over the course of ten successive dehydrogenationregeneration cycles.\nThe first study of Cr2O3-based catalysts for ODH-CO2 was reported by Takahara et al. in 1996 using Cr2O3 supported on SiO2, activated carbon (AC) or Al2O3.\nIt was found that over 5 wt% Cr2O3/SiO2, the propene yield increased from 6.5% to 9.1% when CO2 was co-fed instead of Ar.\nIn contrast, the alumina supported catalyst was inhibited by the addition of CO2, as shown by the drop in propene yield from 12.7% to 3.3%.\nThe 5 wt% Cr2O3/AC material was unaffected by CO2 addition.\nThe Cr2O3/SiO2 catalyst deactivated rapidly, retaining just 66% of its original activity after 4 h on-stream.\nThe stability was noted to the same with or without CO2 in the reactant feed.\nNot only did this study establish Cr2O3 as an active ODH-CO2 catalyst, it also captured one of the recurring themes in catalyst design for ODH-CO2: some catalysts are inhibited by the addition of CO2 while others perform much better.\nRelative to many other metal oxides, Cr2O3 is considered to be one of the most promising catalysts for ODH-CO2.\nTakehira et al. compared the catalytic performance of several d block and p block oxides (namely Cr, Ga, Ni, V, Fe, Mn and Co) supported on MCM-41, at 550 C with a CO2:C3H8 molar ratio of 5.6.\nAfter 30 min on-stream, the propene yield of the Cr-based catalyst was 15% whereas for the Ga-based counterpart it was 5%.\nThe remaining catalysts all exhibited lower propene yields (in the 14% range).\nHowever, as the catalysts were not characterised, it is unclear if the dispersion of these catalysts was comparable, and therefore if the results reflect the true intrinsic activity of each metal.\nIt was also noted that the order of reactivity resembled the trends observed by Nakagawa et al. for diamond-supported metal catalysts in the DDH reaction.\nThis suggests that there are commonalities in catalyst design between DDH and ODH-CO2 which most likely relate to the interaction of the alkane with the catalyst.\nContrary to this, Zhang et al. compared ZrO2, SBA-15 and γ-Al2O3 as supports for Cr2O3 in the DDH, ODH-CO2 and ODH-O2 reactions.\nThey found that the highest propene yield was observed with different catalyst systems under different dehydrogenation reactions, i.e., the activity trends in DDH did not translate to ODH-CO2 catalysts.\nSpecifically, Cr2O3/ZrO2 catalyst was the most active for the DDH reaction, while the highest yield of propene for the ODH-CO2 and ODH-O2 reactions was observed over Cr2O3/SBA-15 (Table 11, entry 7).\nAcross all the catalysts however, the highest propene yields were generally observed in the DDH reaction, ascribed to the production of carbon oxides in the ODH-O2 and ODH-CO2 reactions.\nHowever, it was reported that Cr2O3/ZrO2 was more stable on-stream in ODH-CO2 than in the DDH reaction.\nWu et al. also observed increased stability of Cr2O3/ZrO2 in the presence of CO2 (Table 11, entry 4).\nThey reported that the CO formation rate was higher than the CO2 consumption rate and the excess CO was suggested to originate from the Boudouard reaction (CO2 + C  2CO); this could explain the increased stability of this catalyst.\nIt is possible that some dry reforming of propane also took place, which would produce H2 and CO.\nZhao et al. recently reported the facile preparation of Cr supported in mesoporous ZrO2 using an evaporation-induced self-assembly method (Table 11, entry 6).\nThe authors suggested that propene could react with carbon dioxide to form carbon monoxide, methane and water.\nOther studies have reported a stronger inhibition effect for Cr2O3/ZrO2 catalysts in the presence of CO2.\nFor instance, Ferreira et al. studied the adsorption properties of CO2 and concluded that it binds strongly to active Cr2O3 sites, lowering the activity and stability of the catalyst,\nwhereas Xie et al. suggested that coke formation could originate from CO2 hydrogenation over Cr2+ species.\nThese conflicting reports may relate to the structural polymorph of ZrO2 present in the catalyst support; this factor is often overlooked, but recent studies from Kondratenko et al. revealed that nanocrystalline ZrO2 is an active DDH catalyst in its own right151,152 under similar reaction conditions.\nThe ZrO2 crystal phase and crystallite size were strongly correlated to the catalyst activity: smaller crystallites were more active but amorphous ZrO2 had very low intrinsic activity.\nMoreover, monoclinic ZrO2 was more active than tetragonal ZrO2.\nCr2O3-catalysed ODH-CO2 has been examined over different polymorphs of SiO2,254256 including various structured porous oxides, including SBA-1,84 SBA-15,250,257 MCM-41,91 amorphous silica84 and mesoporous silica spheres.258\nNotably, Michorczyk et al. reported a detailed comparison of different silica supports, coupled with an in-depth characterisation study.84\nIt was shown that in each case, the same active Cr species was formed, namely Cr6+, but higher surface area silicas (e.g., SBA-1 and SBA-15) were able to facilitate a higher number of such sites.\nA clear correlation was found between the rate of propene formation and the wt% of Cr6+, as determined using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS).\nIn DDH, while Cr6+ is considered active, under reaction conditions Cr3+ is rapidly formed and considered the principle active species.93,94\nThe selectivity to propene was similar across the different silica supports (8893%), with the observed differences being attributable to differences in propane conversion rather than catalytic properties.\nThese Cr2O3/SiO2 catalysts were highly active at 550 C and the most active catalyst (Cr2O3/SBA-1) achieved a STY of 7.9 molC3H6 kgcat1 h1, as shown in Table 11, entry 12.\nIt should be noted that the experiments were carried out with a CO2:C3H8 ratio of 5, which as discussed above, has been shown to enable a higher equilibrium yield of propene.\nTherefore, in studies where high conversions are generally targeted and carbon dioxide is in excess of propane, higher propene yields are reported.\nTakehira et al. carried out X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) on CrOx/MCM-41, confirming that the reduction of Cr6+ occurs during the reaction.91\nSpecifically, they identified Cr6+O4 tetrahedra as the active species.\nThese Cr3+O6 octahedra were formed after reduction, which were considered to be less active.\nIt was shown that CO2 could re-oxidise the Cr, which suggests that the redox cycle between Cr6+ and Cr3+ is an important process during the reaction.\nYi et al. discriminated between isolated Cr6+ and polymeric Cr6+, finding that after reduction, isolated Cr3+ was more active than polymeric Cr3+. This underlines the importance of Cr dispersion in these catalysts.259\nIn a more detailed examination of Cr2O3/SBA-1, the relationship between the physicochemical properties of the catalyst and the observed activity were explored.85\nMichorczyk et al. found a strong positive correlation between the initial propene yield and the reducibility of the catalyst, specifically the H2 consumption.\nIn situ UV-vis measurements revealed that Cr6+ is rapidly reduced to Cr3+ or Cr2+ in the presence of C3H8 under reaction conditions.\nThe reaction proceeds through a Mars-Van Krevelen mechanism, via the Cr2+/3+ redox couple.\nRapid deactivation, typical of Cr2O3 catalysts, was observed, although the majority of the initial activity could be recovered after regeneration in air.\nThe remainder was ascribed to pore collapse and/or the formation of inactive Cr sites, although the loss of surface Cr sites through agglomeration was not considered.\nDespite early reports that activated carbon (AC) was not a suitable support for Cr2O3, subsequent studies have shown that above 550 C, the activity of Cr2O3/AC in the presence of CO2 was higher than in the DDH reaction.260\nThe enhancement in propane conversion due to the presence of CO2 increased at higher temperatures (i.e., above 600 C), although this was chiefly due to propane dry reforming proceeding, generating CO and H2 rather than propene.\nWhile this Cr2O3/AC exhibited the highest STY of propene out of all CrOx-based catalysts (21 molC3H6 kgcat1 h1, Table 11, entry 9), it rapidly deactivated on-stream and due to the support being carbonaceous, cannot be regenerated using air.\nThis severely limits the utility of this catalyst.\nZeolites have also been considered as catalyst supports for Cr2O3.\nZhang et al. prepared CrOx/Na-ZSM-5 via incipient wetness.261\nAlthough the initial conversion and selectivity was high (48% and 86%, respectively) (Table 11, entry 5), the catalysts deactivated rapidly and the reaction conditions were such that the STY was only 2.5 molC3H6 kgcat1 h1 at 550 C with a CO2:C3H8 ratio of 2.\nZhu et al. investigated a range of MFI supports, including silicalite-1 and H[B]MFI.262\nCrOx/H[B]MFI was found to be the most active catalyst, giving a STY of 4.7 molC3H6 kgcat1 h1 at 600 C with a CO2:C3H8 of 1 (Table 11, entry 15).\nAlthough the as-prepared catalyst exhibited typically poor stability for Cr catalysts, steam treating the catalyst resulted in a marked improvement.\nAfter 60 h on-stream, the as-prepared catalyst retained only 25% of its initial conversion, while the steam treated catalyst retained ca. 74%.\nThe authors ascribed the effect to stabilised Cr3+ formed in the steam treatment.\nPresumably the reduction of Cr6+ during the reaction results in an inactive or less active Cr3+ species.\nIt should also be noted that the as-prepared catalyst was initially almost twice as active as the steam treated catalyst, which leaves the possibility that at higher conversions, increased coke formation may have occurred which would exaggerate the deactivation compared to the steam treated catalyst.\nIdeally such stability comparisons would be made at isoconversion, however this discovery is one of only a few that shows improved stability on-stream.\nRecently, Michorczyk et al. prepared a Cr-β-zeolite and investigated the effect of dealumination, which clearly elucidated the effect of acidity on the catalytic performance.263\nIt was reported that the dealuminated catalyst, Cr-SiBeta, exhibited significantly higher propene yields (up to 27%), compared to the Al-containing catalyst, Cr-AlBeta (2%).\nThe presence of acid sites in the Cr-AlBeta catalyst resulted in cracking pathways that led to increased production of methane and ethene.\nMoreover, the CrAlbeta catalyst performed less well in the presence of CO2 than in the DDH reaction.\nThis was explained by the strong adsorption of CO2 on the catalyst, similar to the inhibition observed over Cr2O3/Al2O3 catalysts.\nThe stability of the dealuminated catalyst was also improved compared with CrAlbeta, but significant loss in activity was observed over the 4 h reaction.\nIn considering the redox properties of the catalysts in this work, and their previous investigations, the authors also identified a strong correlation between the H2 consumption from H2-TPR studies and the reported propene yield, as shown in Fig. 10.\nWhile the majority of investigations on ODH-CO2 Cr2O3 catalysts have focused on support modifications, the addition of a promotor has also been shown to be beneficial.\nYun et al. demonstrated that the addition of 0.5 wt% Ni to a 10 wt% CrOx/SBA-15 catalyst increased the propane and CO2 conversion, as well as the on-stream stability.264\nAfter 1 h on-stream, the Ni-promoted catalyst was 50% more active and the conversion and selectivity was almost maintained over 12 h on-stream.\nIn contrast, the less active unpromoted catalyst retained only half of the initial activity over the same time period.\nUsing three-stage H2-TPR experiments (where the catalyst is reduced twice under H2 and then re-oxidised in CO2 before the final H2-TPR program), the authors showed that the addition of Ni facilitated the re-oxidation of Cr during the reaction.\nThis is consistent with previously reported mechanisms of deactivation over Cr-based catalysts, although coking is also often reported to cause deactivation.\nInterestingly, the promoted catalyst was marginally more prone to coking.\nThis strongly suggests that overreduction of active Cr sites is the key deactivation mechanism over these catalysts.\nThere is a lot of potential to develop promoted Cr catalysts that could enhance the redox activity of the catalyst; precious metals including Pd and Pt are often supported on reducible supports for this purpose.265\nCrucially, it was found that above 0.5 wt% Ni, propane reforming was prevalent, which underlines the importance of appropriate loadings of promotors.\nO'Brien et al. investigated the effect of a Ru promoter to a 10 wt% CrOx/SiO2 catalyst.\nConsistent with Yun et al. it was shown that the propene formation rate was increased.\nA 1 wt% Ru loading was optimal and doubled the activity.\nInterestingly, this is approximately the same molar ratio reported as the optimum by Yun et al. for Ni-promoted CrOx/SBA-15 (Table 11, entry 14).\nAnother similarity was the propensity of reforming to dominate at high loadings (>1 wt%).\nThe enhanced stability seen in Ni-promoted Cr catalysts was not observed in this work and the activity could not be fully recovered after regeneration.\nConsequently, aggregation of Cr species was suggested as an additional deactivation mechanism in addition to coke formation and overreduction of Cr.\nRather than aid Cr re-oxidation in a one-step oxidative dehydrogenation, the authors concluded that the Ru promotes the RWGS reaction, which removes H2 and increases the equilibrium conversion of propane.\nHowever, the results of three-stage H2-TPR reactions indicated that Cr can be more easily oxidised in the presence of Ru, which suggests that Ru can participate in a similar role as Ni-promoted Cr catalysts.\nOverall supported chromium oxide catalysts represent one of the most active classes of ODH-CO2 catalysts, with STY values in the range of 222 molC3H6 kgcat1 h1.\nThe role of the support is simply to maximise the active Cr6+ surface area, rather than add any chemical functionality, hence this is the reason why chemically-unreactive supports such as SiO2 and activated carbon yield the most active CrOX catalysts.\nThe most significant barrier to commercial application is the poor on-stream stability exhibited by all chromium-based catalysts.\nWhile incremental improvements in the activity of Cr catalysts have been reported since their initial discovery, significant advances in catalyst stability have been relatively few.\nThe first study of Cr2O3-based catalysts for ODH-CO2 was reported by Takahara et al. in 1996 using Cr2O3 supported on SiO2, activated carbon (AC) or Al2O3.\nThe 5 wt% Cr2O3/SiO2 catalyst deactivated rapidly, retaining just 66% of its original activity after 4 h on-stream.\nThe stability was noted to the same with or without CO2 in the reactant feed.\nNot only did this study establish Cr2O3 as an active ODH-CO2 catalyst, it also captured one of the recurring themes in catalyst design for ODH-CO2: some catalysts are inhibited by the addition of CO2 while others perform much better.\nThe correct balance of acidic and basic sites is a key consideration in catalyst design.\nEqually, the ratio of carbon dioxide to propane is important to take in account, as it has kinetic and thermodynamic implications.\nThermodynamically, higher CO2:C3H8 ratios limit coke forming side-reactions.\nThe addition of CO2 in the dehydrogenation reaction has multiple effects: As discussed in Section 2, it facilitates the RWGS reaction which removes H2 from the system and shifts the thermodynamic equilibrium limit to favour propene production.\nAdditionally, CO2 can dissociate on the surface of a catalyst and provide O species to dehydrogenate propane directly.\nFinally, it can react with coke via the reverse-Boudouard reaction to produce CO, which can potentially extend the lifetime of the catalyst.\nThe role of the support is simply to maximise the active Cr6+ surface area, rather than add any chemical functionality, hence this is the reason why chemically-unreactive supports such as SiO2 and activated carbon yield the most active CrOX catalysts.\nThe most significant barrier to commercial application is the poor on-stream stability exhibited by all chromium-based catalysts.\nWhile incremental improvements in the activity of Cr catalysts have been reported since their initial discovery, significant advances in catalyst stability have been relatively few.\nThe addition of Al2O3 to ODH-CO2 catalysts is typically not beneficial.\nAlthough the addition of Al2O3 to ODH-CO2 catalysts is typically not beneficial, Chen et al. investigated spinel-type Ga2O3Al2O3 mixed oxides and showed that they can function as stable catalysts.\nThe origin of stability was linked to the low rate of coking associated with the spinel catalyst.\nUsing NH3-TPD analysis, the authors concluded that weak Lewis acid sites were conducive to high activity.\nThese acidbase properties most likely contribute to the enhanced stability as well; it is known that stronger acid sites promote oligomerisation pathways that produce coke.\nThe increased performance of Ga2O3/ZSM-48 was attributed to the abundance of weak and medium strength acid sites.\nThe low activity of Ga2O3/MgO and Ga2O3/SiO2 was ascribed to the absence of medium and strong acid sites.\nIn the Ga2O3/TiO2 catalyst, a significant proportion of the Ga (45%) was reduced.\nThis catalyst exhibited the highest propane conversion, but with a propene selectivity of 73% it did not result in the highest propene yield.\nThe origin of this induction period was found to be reduction of In2O3 to In0 nanoclusters, which suggests the active structure is more of a supported nanoparticle type catalyst than a mixed-metal oxide.\nThe basicity of the In/ZrO2 system was suggested to promote the RWGS reaction, which in turn boosted the ODH-CO2 activity.\nIt was found that 10 mol% Fe in CeO2 exhibited the highest propene yield.\nThe major side-reactions observed were dry reforming and cracking.\nThey showed that reforming pathways were more prevalent at higher CO2:C3H8 ratios, such as 2.5:1 and 5:1.\nDespite the low selectivity, the FeCeO2 catalysts exhibited a comparable STY to supported In2O3 and some Ga2O3 catalysts.\nThe number of studies on supported nanoparticle catalysts for ODH-CO2 are relatively few and those available indicate that this field of research has great potential.\nThe major challenge is in understanding and inhibiting side-reactions such as reforming, which are known to proceed over this class of catalyst, unlike in Cr- and Ga-based catalysts.\nCareful consideration of the nanostructure and composition has shown that the selectivity can be readily tuned to favour different pathways, and further investigation in this area may well be able to harness the high activity of supported nanoparticles as well as favour dehydrogenation pathways.\nDespite dozens of reports over several decades on Cr- and Ga- based catalysts, the improvements in catalyst performance have been incremental.\nThe knowledge gained from these studies on the importance of reducibility and the balance of acid and base sites should be applied to supported NP catalysts, which are a promising and somewhat neglected category of ODH-CO2 catalyst.\nThe specific requirements of catalyst design for each sub-reaction are discussed and we identify that, regardless of the method of dehydrogenation, the balance of acid and base sites on the catalyst surface is of paramount importance.\nThe development of an active, selective and stable catalyst is essential for dehydrogenation to be considered as a viable process in the near- and long-term future.\nIn the case of SC and coal-based MTO, this is unavoidable due to the nature of the feedstock. However, natural gas and propane can be produced from biomass.\nThe increased interest in direct propane dehydrogenation has been enhanced by the fall in propane price, which is the direct result of the discovery of vast shale gas reserves in North America.\nThe production of renewable green propane (also called bio-propane and bioLPG) is an emerging sector which is already being operated on a large scale.\nWith increasing pressure to source chemical feedstocks sustainably, we can expect that new interest will focus on renewable and green routes to the key platform chemicals currently required by modern society, and that green propane will play an important role in this.\nThe majority (86%) of filed patents are for DDH catalysts, followed by ODH-O2 (12%) and finally ODH-CO2 (2.4%).\nThe exact composition of the HGM is likely to include copper oxide and additional promotors such as MnO2, supported on α-Al2O3.\nThe importance of Al speciation in improving catalyst performance and stability was investigated by Shi et al.\nThe modification of Al2O3 with metal oxides, such as TiO2 has been undertaken with some promising results.\nThe role of Cu in the catalyst was to dilute the Pt species and promote desorption of propene, thereby enhancing selectivity.\nThe role of the subsurface was to facilitate the activation of propane on the surface.\nThe irreversible initial deactivation in the consecutive DDH cycles was attributed to either: (i) structural changes of active species (such as agglomeration), or (ii) collapse of pore structure.\nThe positive effect was attributed to the promoters ability to block the sites responsible for coke formation and negligible contribution to undesirable secondary reactions by the additional acid sites generated by the P-based modifier.\nThe authors attributed this enhanced performance to a high dispersion of Cr species, moderate acidity and strong metalsupport interactions in the CrOx/H-ZSM-5(260) catalyst.\nThe authors attributed high Ga/Al ratios (>0.5) with the formation of additional GaxOy clusters which negatively affected the dehydrogenation rate and thus catalytic performance.\nThe activity is dependent on the bond strength of the VOsupport bond. Therefore, it is expected that catalyst performance is affected when different supports, such as SiO2, Al2O3 and ZrO2 are utilised.", "English": "The physicochemical properties of catalysts, including chemical qualities and morphological characteristics, significantly influence their performance in dehydrogenation reactions. The crystallization temperature of the support directly affects the catalytic performance of VOx/Al2O3 catalysts by increasing Lewis acid sites and influencing the distribution of different surface V species. P modification can decrease the degree of VOx polymerization, enhancing catalyst stability and activity. Mg modification can improve catalytic performance and anti-coking capability by dispersing V2O5 crystallites and increasing active V3+ species. Gelation and calcination temperatures also impact the catalytic performance of VOx/SiO2 catalysts in terms of propane conversion, propene selectivity, and yield of propene. Dealuminated beta zeolites (Si-beta) are promising catalyst supports due to their high surface area and thermal stability, and the initial propane conversion linearly increases with the amount of acid sites. VOx/ZrO2 is more active than VOx/Al2O3 and pure ZrO2 due to the facile reduction of VO, VOV, and VOZr bonds, producing higher proportions of the active V3+ species. The balance of acid and base sites on the catalyst surface is crucial for all dehydrogenation methods. The development of an active, selective, and stable catalyst is essential for dehydrogenation to be considered a viable process in the future. Support modification strategies can optimize these properties for enhanced catalytic efficiency and selectivity. Using supports with ordered mesoporosity and moderate surface acidity can aid mass transfer and avoid undesirable secondary reactions. Promoting elements can cause beneficial geometric and electronic effects on both the supports and active species. However, environmental and safety concerns exist in the preparation, usage, and disposal of certain catalysts due to their toxicity. Ga catalysts, while less active than Pt and Cr catalysts, have the advantage of being benign and inexpensive. The nature of the support is essential for vanadium-based catalysts, as the metalsupport interactions affect the resultant catalyst performance. The activity is dependent on the bond strength of the VOsupport bond, and catalyst performance is affected by different supports.", "Chinese": "所有答案结果中的汇总中文答案 1", "Doi": "10.1039/D1GC03700E"},

The equilibrium conversion of alkanes increases with temperature, but alkene selectivity decreases due to an increased tendency toward dehydrocyclization/aromatisation, thermal cracking, and coke formation. The extent of PtSn interactions depends on the impregnation sequence of Pt and Sn precursors on the support material. The framework of microporous zeolites exerts dispersive forces on reactant molecules, which depend on the shape, channel, and cavity of the framework. The nature and density of active sites also influence the framework dispersion forces. Recent reports have shown that the strong electrostatic field between protons or exchanged metal ions and basic oxygen species can enhance and/or induce polarization of bonds in hydrocarbon adsorbates. This polarization effect can be viewed as an intermediate condition to hydride abstraction, an important elementary step in CH activation. The polarizing effect increases with increasing charge magnitude and ionic radius of the alkane polarizing cations. The choice of cations should be such that they exhibit no catalytic effects on the target alkene products at the reaction condition. It may be beneficial to create a CH polarization effect on the zeolite framework by appropriate modification of framework atoms. Active sites are usually created on the zeolite frameworks. The active sites of the bimolecular pathway are formed in situ and are made up of an alkyl carbenium ion ionically held to the zeolite framework oxygen ion. The active sites of the unimolecular pathway are the charge balancing protons of the zeolite framework. A proton and a carbenium ion are electrophilic or Lewis acid species, and the two pathways essentially involve electrophilic CH activation. The exchanged metal ions in zeolites are held ionically by one or more basic oxygen atoms. Different species have been suggested, depending on the density of the cation exchange site of the zeolite and the method of introduction of the metals. High alkene selectivities are obtained on the H-ZSM-5 when exchangeable protons are rigorously replaced by Zn and Ga. The CH activation on the OZn2+O site can be described by a Lewis base-assisted deprotonation mechanism, accompanied by conversion of the Lewis base site to a conjugate Bronsted acid site. The OGa+ site, however, activates the CH bond via oxidative addition without a protonic site intermediate. A protonic site intermediate increases the tendency of side reactions on the Zn-exchanged H-ZSM-5 relative to the Ga counterpart. The elementary steps of CH activation on OGa+ reveal that a redox cycle at the metal center is required for catalytic CH activation via the oxidative addition mechanism. However, under alkane dehydrogenation reaction conditions, the OZn2+O sites can undergo a reversible Zn2+/Zn redox process, increasing the availability of undesired protonic site intermediates. Zn-exchanged H-ZSM-5 prepared by conventional ion-exchange methods contain a significant percentage of unexchanged proton sites, leading to lower alkene selectivity of the catalyst. Another strategy to enhance alkene selectivity is by controlling the strength of the proton sites. The acidity of the sites depends on the nature of the trivalent cation of the zeolite framework. Proton sites in borosilicate zeolites are weaker than those of aluminosilicate, and thus higher alkene selectivity is expected for alkane dehydrogenation over Zn/H[B]-ZSM-5 compared to Zn/H[Al]-ZSM-5. However, Zn/H[B]-ZSM-5 shows no activity for propane dehydrogenation. The desired weaker acidity of the proton sites of Zn/H[B]-ZSM-5 requires weaker basicity of the oxygen atoms in the zeolite framework. This reduced basicity of the oxygen atoms is not sufficiently polarizing to complement the exchanged Zn2+ in CH bond cleavage. Elimination of the proton sites of zeolites is critical for obtaining a high alkene selectivity and stability in dehydrogenation catalysts. Pt is the most versatile noble metal catalyst for alkane reactions, often justified by its higher activity, stability, and selectivity for these reactions compared to less expensive alternative transition metals. However, rapid catalyst deactivation due to coke formation remains a challenge even when using a Pt-based catalyst for dehydrogenation of light alkanes. The presence of acid (Bronsted and Lewis) sites on the supports promotes readsorption, oligomerization, and aromatization of alkenes. Promotion of Pt with metals, such as Sn, Ga, Zn, Re, etc., improves catalyst stability, but also leads to faster deactivation rates than Pt/Na[Fe]-ZSM-5. The role of potassium in commercial Cr and Pt-based dehydrogenation catalysts is to minimize the undesired influence of protonic sites on alkene selectivity. The nature and role of surface oxygen species become more evident. The electronic promotion effect of Sn is in line with the oxidative addition CH activation mechanism. However, the Lewis base-assisted deprotonation mechanism could also explain the proposed CH activation on Cr-based catalysts. A recent report suggests that a porous copper-aluminum framework material (stabilized by metal oxide) has better performance (activity/selectivity/stability) for propane dehydrogenation than a PtSn/Al2O3. The Lewis base-assisted deprotonation mechanism may be invoked here, and the redox property of the metal center is likely to play a role in achieving propane dehydrogenation at 350 C. This should constitute the future research direction for non-oxidative dehydrogenation of lower alkanes.", "Chinese": "催化剂的物理化学性质，包括化学品质（如酸强度和稳定性）和形态特征，对脱氢反应的性能有重大影响。随着温度的升高，烷烃的平衡转化率增加，但由于脱氢环化/芳构化、热裂解和焦炭形成的倾向增加，烯烃的选择性降低。PtSn相互作用的程度取决于Pt和Sn前体在支撑材料上的浸渍顺序。微孔沸石框架对反应物分子施加的分散力取决于框架的形状、通道和腔体。活性位点的性质和密度也影响框架的分散力。最近的报告表明，质子或交换金属离子与基本氧物种之间的强静电场可以增强和/或诱导烃吸附物中键的极化。这种极化效应可以视为向氢化物抽离过渡的中间条件，这是CH活化的重要基本步骤。极化效应随电荷大小和离子半径的增加而增加。选择的阳离子应确保在反应条件下对目标烯烃产品没有催化作用。在沸石框架上创造CH极化效应可能是有益的，这可以通过适当修改框架原子来实现。活性位点通常在沸石框架上创建。双分子途径的活性位点是原位形成的，由离子结合到沸石框架氧离子的烷基卡宾离子组成。单分子途径的活性位点是沸石框架的质子平衡电荷。质子和卡宾离子是亲电性或路易斯酸性物种，两种途径本质上涉及亲电性CH活化。沸石中交换的金属离子通过一个或多个基本氧原子离子结合。根据沸石的阳离子交换位点密度和金属的引入方法，提出了不同的物种。当可交换的质子被严格替换为Zn和Ga时，H-ZSM-5获得了高烯烃选择性。OZn2+O位点上的CH活化可以通过路易斯碱辅助脱质子机制来描述，伴随路易斯碱位点转化为共轭布龙斯特酸位点。然而，OGa+位点通过氧化加成而不是质子位点中间体活化CH键。质子位点中间体增加了Zn交换的H-ZSM-5相对于Ga对应物的副反应倾向。OGa+的CH活化基本步骤揭示，金属中心的氧化还原循环是通过氧化加成机制催化CH活化所必需的。然而，在烷烃脱氢反应条件下，OZn2+O位点可以经历可逆的Zn2+/Zn氧化还原过程，增加了不希望的质子位点中间体的可用性。通过传统离子交换方法制备的Zn交换H-ZSM-5含有大量未交换的质子位点，导致催化剂的烯烃选择性降低。另一种增强烯烃选择性的策略是控制质子位点的强度。位点的酸性取决于沸石框架中三价阳离子的性质。硼硅酸盐沸石中的质子位点比铝硅酸盐弱，因此预计Zn/H[B]-ZSM-5在烷烃脱氢中的烯烃选择性高于Zn/H[Al]-ZSM-5。然而，Zn/H[B]-ZSM-5在丙烷脱氢中没有活性。Zn/H[B]-ZSM-5中所需较弱的质子位点酸性需要沸石框架中氧原子的较弱碱性。这种氧原子碱性的降低不足以补充交换的Zn2+在CH键断裂中的作用。消除沸石的质子位点对于获得高烯烃选择性和脱氢催化剂的稳定性至关重要。Pt是烷烃反应中最通用的贵金属催化剂，通常因其在这些反应中的较高活性、稳定性和选择性而被证明是合理的，与成本较低的替代过渡金属相比。然而，即使使用Pt基催化剂进行轻烷烃脱氢，由于焦炭形成导致的催化剂失活速度仍然很快。支持物上的酸（布龙斯特和路易斯）位点促进了烯烃的再吸附、寡聚化和芳构化。Pt与Sn、Ga、Zn、Re等金属的促进提高了催化剂的稳定性，但与Pt/Na[Fe]-ZSM-5相比，失活速度也更快。商业Cr和Pt基脱氢催化剂中钾的作用是最大限度地减少质子位点对烯烃选择性的不利影响。表面氧物种的性质和作用变得更加明显。Sn的电子促进效应与氧化加成CH活化机制一致。然而，路易斯碱辅助脱质子机制也可以解释在Cr基催化剂上提出的CH活化。最近的一份报告表明，一种多孔铜铝框架材料（由金属氧化物稳定）在丙烷脱氢中的性能（活性/选择性/稳定性）优于PtSn/Al2O3。可以在此处调用路易斯碱辅助脱质子机制，金属中心的氧化还原性质可能在实现350°C下的丙烷脱氢中发挥作用。这应该是非氧化脱氢较低烷烃的未来研究方向。", "Doi": "10.1016/j.fuproc.2016.04.016"},

site structures and dehydrogenation mechanisms are followed in the PDH process from a fundamental perspective.\n          In this section, the active sites, dehydrogenation pathways and deactivation mechanisms on Pt-based and representative metal oxide-based catalysts would be clarified.\n          The coordination saturated Pt atoms are more selective for propane dehydrogenation, while the coordinatively unsaturated Pt atoms will catalyze the side reactions, such as CC breaking and deep dehydrogenation, resulting in the formation of carbon deposits.\n          The adsorption configuration and strength of propylene can be both greatly perturbed by surface structures, coke formation is inherently governed by the surface geometric and electronic structures, and thus the construction of specific reaction ensembles is important.\n          Tuning the support's acidity and coke mobility can also inhibit the coke formation.\n          The effective strategies for inhibiting coke are summarized as follows.\n          Geometric separation: Previous research studies have shown that separating the active metal components could inhibit the structure-sensitive side reactions with improved propylene selectivity.\n          Electron richness: A high electron density of Pt particles is beneficial to weaken Pt(CC) bonds, inhibit coke precursors, and suppress deep

coke on acidic supports can also suppress the diffusion of reactive molecules.\n          Cofeeding streams: In addition to the modulation of catalyst structures and the properties of supports, changes in reaction conditions by cofeeding streams, such as H2, and CO2, can also have a positive effect on coke elimination.\n          Enhancing oxygen mobility: The oxidation of the adsorbed surface carbonaceous species can help eliminate the coke deposition over supported metals and thus is beneficial to the improvement of catalytic stability.\n          Coke transfer: In addition to

supports with high surface area and uniform pore size distribution are preferred.\n          Some alkaline metals, such as Li, Na, and K, can help poison the strong acid sites and avoid the coke deposition on the Al2O3 surface.\n          Additionally, doping Mg into Al2O3 forms a stable spinel phase.\n          An-Hui Lu and coworkers indicated that Al2O3 nanosheets with abundant penta-coordinate Al atoms have a strong metalsupport interaction owing to their capacity for anchoring Pt atoms, which accounts for their high stability.\n          Due to the weak interaction between

This crystal structure has a high concentration of weak Lewis acid sites (coordinatively unsaturated tetrahedral ones on the surface of the material), which are deemed to be centers of dehydrogenation activity.\n          The assignment of Lewis acid sites as the active species was substantiated by Chen et al., who, by relating the results of NH3-TPD measurements with activity data for different GaxAl10xO15 mixed oxides, showed that a high concentration of Lewis acid groups in the form of coordinatively unsaturated tetrahedral Ga3+ cations is a prerequisite for dehydrogenation activity.\n          Xu et al. reported dehydrogenation activity on both Lewis and Brnsted acid sites on GaO3/H-ZSM-5. A zeolitic support displaying a low concentration of medium and strong acid sites and a relatively high concentration of weak acid sites was found to lead to the most active and stable catalyst.\n          Michorczyk et al. concluded that acidic groups catalyze the reaction after observing that promotion with a base, such as potassium, resulted in a decrease in activity.\n          The structure of the support is also important, as a mesoporous GaAl mixed oxide exhibited an increased resistance to catalyst coking.\n          The function of K was to reduce coke formation by poisoning Brnsted acid sites.\n          Pt is believed to act as a promoter for the GaOx. Indeed, albeit 1000 ppm Pt/Al2O3 was found to be virtually inactive, 1000 ppm of Pt in combination with 3 wt % Ga afforded conversions close to the equilibrium and an propylene selectivity <95%.\n          The role of Pt is to assist hydrogen desorption, which facilitates the regeneration of the gallium hydride hydroxide species.\n          The exact nature of the active sites in Ga-based dehydrogenation catalysts is still under debate.\n          The chemistry of molybdenum oxide is comparable to that of vanadium oxide, as Mo can be present as MoOx monomers, polymers, or MoO3 crystallites, depending on the molybdenum loading, the type of support used, and catalyst preparation conditions.\n          The reducibility of the catalyst with hydrogen prior to reaction increases conversion, although selectivity decreases due to the formation of acid sites.\n          The chemistry of molybdenum oxide is comparable to that of vanadium oxide, as Mo can be present as MoOx monomers, polymers, or MoO3 crystallites, depending on the molybdenum loading, the type of support used, and catalyst preparation conditions.\n          The reducibility of the catalyst with hydrogen prior to reaction increases conversion, although selectivity decreases due to the formation of acid sites.\n          The chemistry of molybdenum oxide is comparable to that of vanadium oxide, as Mo can be present as MoOx monomers, polymers, or MoO3 crystallites, depending on the molybdenum loading, the type of support used, and catalyst preparation conditions.\n          The reducibility of the catalyst with hydrogen prior to reaction increases conversion, although selectivity decreases due to the formation of acid sites.\n          The chemistry of molybdenum oxide is comparable to that of vanadium oxide, as Mo can be present as MoOx monomers, polymers, or MoO3 crystallites, depending on the molybdenum loading, the type of support used, and catalyst preparation conditions.\n          The reducibility of the catalyst with hydrogen prior to reaction increases conversion, although selectivity decreases due to the formation of acid sites.\n          The chemistry of molybdenum oxide is comparable to that of vanadium oxide, as Mo can be present as MoOx monomers, polymers, or MoO3 crystallites, depending on the molybdenum loading, the type of support used, and catalyst preparation conditions.\n          The reducibility of the catalyst with hydrogen prior to reaction increases conversion, although selectivity decreases due to the formation of acid sites.\n          The chemistry of molybdenum oxide is comparable to that of vanadium oxide, as Mo can be present as MoOx monomers, polymers, or MoO3 crystallites, depending on the molybdenum loading, the type of support used, and catalyst preparation conditions.\n          The reducibility of the catalyst with hydrogen prior to reaction increases conversion, although selectivity decreases due to the formation of acid sites.\n          The chemistry of molybdenum oxide is comparable to that of vanadium oxide, as Mo can be present as MoOx monomers, polymers, or MoO3 crystallites, depending on the molybdenum loading, the type of support used, and catalyst preparation conditions.\n          The reducibility of the catalyst with hydrogen prior to reaction increases conversion, although selectivity decreases due to the formation of acid sites.\n          Alumina is by far the most common support, and a variety of methods to produce chromiaalumina catalysts have been investigated.\n          The nature of the support is important not only because it governs the mechanical properties of the catalyst, but also because the interaction of the carrier with the active phase can have a profound impact on catalyst activity and selectivity.\n          Albeit selectivity has been found to be insensitive to chromium loading, it does change over time.\n          The use of zirconia as an alternative support has also been investigated.\n          The use of silica as the support in chromia-based dehydrogenation catalysts requires a relative high surface area to stabilize Cr6+ sites.\n          CrMgAl and CrMg mixed oxides prepared using layered double hydroxide (LDH) precursors have been studied as catalysts for the nonoxidative dehydrogenation of ethane.\n          Finally, the study of porous chromia-pillared α-zirconium phosphate materials has been particularly informative with regards to the influence that acidity has on catalytic behavior.\n          The surface area-to-metal loading ratio determines which species will form. Indeed, Wu et al. reported that monomeric species are predominantly present below 1.2 V/nm2, polymeric vanadium species prevail between 1.2 and 4.4 V/nm2, and crystalline V2O5 species preponderate at even higher loadings.\n          On the one hand, the presence of hydroxyl groups on the surface of the support is important to obtain a well-dispersed catalyst, as OH groups serve as anchoring sites for the vanadium precursors used to prepare these catalysts. On the other hand, acid sites are detrimental for catalyst performance, because they facilitate cracking and induce coke formation.\n          Alumina is commonly used as a support for vanadium oxide catalysts, although Sokolov et al. concluded through testing a wide range of Si- and Al-based supports that using silica to dope the alumina support provides beneficial effects on catalyst stability and activity.\n          Furthermore, as was shown by Harlin et al., the performance of supported vanadium catalysts can be improved through the addition of MgO, either as a promoter or as a component of a mixed oxide. According to these workers, the increase in dehydrogenation selectivity stems from the basic nature of MgO, resulting in reduced coke formation.\n          The reducibility of the vanadium species depends on their molecular structure, VOV and VO bonds being more easily reduced than VO-support bonds.\n          Prior to reaction, the vanadium in these catalysts is generally present as V5+.

The interaction between the support and the active phase can also alter the electronic properties of the catalyst, which can further enhance its performance. Support modification strategies, such as doping with alkali metals or using mixed oxides, can optimize these properties for enhanced catalytic efficiency and selectivity.

For example, the surface area-to-metal loading ratio determines the formation of different vanadium species, which affects the catalytic activity. The reducibility of vanadium species also influences the catalytic performance. The addition of MgO can improve the selectivity of vanadium-based catalysts by reducing coke formation. Using silica to dope alumina support can enhance the stability and activity of vanadium oxide catalysts. The type of support and preparation conditions can affect the formation of molybdenum oxide species. Hydrogen reduction can increase conversion but decrease selectivity due to the formation of acid sites. The structure of the support, such as mesoporous GaAl mixed oxide, can increase the resistance to catalyst coking. Poisoning Brnsted acid sites with K can reduce coke formation. Alumina is the most common support, and various methods have been explored to produce chromia-alumina catalysts. The choice of support can also influence the stability and dispersion of the active phase, which in turn affects the catalytic efficiency and selectivity. For example, zirconia has been investigated as an alternative support due to its low surface acidity and enhanced sintering resistance, which can improve the performance of chromia-based catalysts. The acidity of the support can also play a role in catalytic behavior, as demonstrated by the study of porous chromia-pillared α-zirconium phosphate materials. Support modification strategies, such as doping with alkali metals or using mixed oxides, can optimize these properties for enhanced catalytic efficiency and selectivity. For instance, doping with alkali metals can stabilize the structure of the support, reduce surface acidity, and increase the number of active sites. Using mixed oxides can also improve the thermal stability and coking resistance of the catalysts. The surface area-to-metal loading ratio determines the formation of monomeric, polymeric, or crystalline vanadium species on the catalyst. Hydroxyl groups on the support surface are important for anchoring vanadium precursors, while acid sites are detrimental to catalyst performance. Silica doping of alumina support can improve catalyst stability and activity. Addition of MgO can improve dehydrogenation selectivity by reducing coke formation. The reducibility of vanadium species depends on their molecular structure. Molybdenum oxide can exist as monomers, polymers, or crystallites, depending on loading, support, and preparation conditions. Optimal molybdenum oxide activity is achieved with monolayer coverage on alumina. Hydrogen reduction of molybdenum oxide catalyst increases conversion but decreases selectivity. Ga2O3 polymorphs, particularly β-Ga2O3, have high concentration of weak Lewis acid sites for dehydrogenation activity. Coordinatively unsaturated tetrahedral Ga3+ cations are crucial for dehydrogenation activity. High concentration of Lewis acid groups in the form of Ga3+ cations is necessary for dehydrogenation activity. Zeolitic support with low medium and strong acid sites and high weak acid sites leads to most active and stable GaO3/H-ZSM-5 catalyst. Promotion with a base like potassium decreases activity, indicating acidic groups catalyze the reaction. Mesoporous GaAl mixed oxide has increased resistance to coking. Potassium reduces coke formation by poisoning Brnsted acid sites. Platinum acts as a promoter for GaOx, enhancing conversion and selectivity. Platinum assists hydrogen desorption, facilitating regeneration of gallium hydride hydroxide species. The nature of active sites in Ga-based dehydrogenation catalysts is still under debate. Molybdenum oxide can exist as monomers, polymers, or crystallites, depending on loading, support, and preparation conditions. Hydrogen reduction of catalyst increases conversion but decreases selectivity due to acid site formation. The physicochemical properties of catalysts, including chemical qualities and morphological characteristics, significantly influence their performance in dehydrogenation reactions. Alumina is the most common support, and its interaction with the active phase can profoundly impact catalyst activity and selectivity. Noble metals, particularly platinum, are preferred for their superior activation of paraffinic CH bonds and low activity for CC cleavage. The addition of alkaline metals like lithium, sodium, and potassium can poison acid sites on the support, suppressing coke formation. Zirconia is an alternative support that has been investigated, offering low surface acidity and enhanced sintering resistance. Silica requires a high surface area to stabilize Cr6+ sites. Mixed oxides prepared using layered double hydroxide precursors have also been studied for nonoxidative dehydrogenation reactions. The acidity of the support material, such as in chromia-pillared α-zirconium phosphate, can significantly affect catalytic behavior. The physicochemical properties of catalysts, including chemical qualities and morphological characteristics, significantly influence their performance in dehydrogenation reactions. The surface area-to-metal loading ratio determines the formation of different vanadium species, which affects the catalytic activity. The presence of hydroxyl groups on the support surface is crucial for anchoring vanadium precursors, while large V2O5 crystallites are inactive in dehydrogenation. The reducibility of vanadium species depends on their molecular structure, and the reduction of the catalyst by the hydrocarbon feed results in the formation of V4+ and V3+. Initially, deactivation is caused by the strong adsorption of reactants on the active sites and coke deposition. The calcination of the catalyst can remove coke but may further deactivate the catalyst due to the formation of larger V2O5 crystallites or mixed oxides. V2O5 crystallites can revert to active polymeric vanadium species under certain conditions. The addition of CO2 can have a beneficial effect on the catalyst by removing acid sites, facilitating coke gasification, and promoting hydrogen removal. The effect of CO2 depends on the catalyst support, with relatively weak basic sites on activated carbon support facilitating the reverse water gas shift reaction, while strong basic sites on Al2O3 and ZnO2 can be poisoned by CO2. Using silica to dope the alumina support can improve catalyst stability and activity. The addition of MgO can improve the performance of supported vanadium catalysts by reducing coke formation. The physicochemical properties of catalysts, including chemical qualities and morphological characteristics, significantly influence their performance in dehydrogenation reactions. The nature of the support is crucial as it not only determines the mechanical properties of the catalyst but also affects the interaction between the carrier and the active phase, which can profoundly impact catalyst activity and selectivity. For instance, alumina is the most common support, and the method of producing chromia-alumina catalysts can vary, affecting the catalyst's performance. The choice of support can also influence the catalytic activity, with different supports leading to varying orders of activity based on conversion and yield. Zirconia, as an alternative support, has been investigated for its low surface acidity and enhanced sintering resistance. Silica requires a high surface area to stabilize Cr6+ sites, and mixed oxides prepared using layered double hydroxide precursors have been studied for their catalytic properties in dehydrogenation reactions. The acidity of the support, as seen in chromia-pillared α-zirconium phosphate materials, can also influence catalytic behavior, with strong acid sites affecting cracking reactions and medium strength acid sites impacting dehydrogenation reactions. Support modification strategies can be employed to optimize the properties of catalysts for enhanced catalytic efficiency and selectivity. For example, doping alumina-based dehydrogenation catalysts with alkali ions can effectively poison undesirable acid sites, improving selectivity. Using zirconia as a support can prevent the formation of mixed oxides and offer higher thermal stability and surface area. Silica, with its high surface area, can stabilize Cr6+ sites, while mixed oxides prepared using layered double hydroxide precursors can provide improved coking resistance and thermal stability against sintering. Understanding the role of acidity in catalytic behavior can also guide the modification of supports to favor dehydrogenation reactions over cracking reactions. The physicochemical properties of catalysts, including chemical qualities and morphological characteristics, significantly influence their performance in dehydrogenation reactions. For instance, the nature of the support material, such as alumina, zirconia, or silica, can affect the dispersion and stability of the active phase, thereby impacting the catalytic activity and selectivity.

The stability and tolerance to carbon deposits of Zr-Al-Beta promoted by alkali-metal ions were demonstrated. The modification of alkali-metal ions on both Lewis acid sites and Brnsted acid sites in Zr-Al-Beta was evidenced by XPS and FT-IR spectroscopy. The untreated materials displayed poor product selectivity and high coke deposit in the Meerwein-Ponndorf-Verley reduction of furfural and isopropanol; however, the treatment of alkali-metal ions promoted their catalytic performance with improved recalcitrance to deactivation and coking significantly. The type of alkali-metal ions and the concentration of alkaline solution influenced the catalytic performance, which were found to correlate to the acidity and textual properties. The optimum reaction result (97.3% yield of furfuryl alcohol at 99.6% conversion of furfural) can be obtained on 0.025 M-Na+-Zr-Al-Beta with high tolerance to the furfural concentration. Support modification strategies can be employed to optimize these properties for enhanced catalytic efficiency and selectivity by tuning and normalizing the various acidic sites of zeolites.

The exploitation of an efficient PDH catalyst based on HZSM-5 zeolite to achieve both high selectivity and stability is still a challenge. In zeolite supported catalysts, zeolite provides a special environment for catalytic reactions, including channel confinement effects, acidic sites, and electron transfer. Acidic sites in zeolites play a key role in determining the catalytic performance of zeolite catalysts in alkane conversion.

This in turn affected the distribution of different surface V species.\nGu et al. reported that P modification could greatly influence the structure and activity of VOx/Al2O3 catalysts.142 More specifically, P modification decreased the degree of VOx polymerization, which had positive implications on the catalyst stability, as evidenced by the retention of high activity (ca. 45% propane conversion) after an 8 h DDH reaction in all P-modified catalysts.\nSubsequent studies on a VOx/Al2O3 catalysts (with 12 wt% V loading) modified with Mg revealed the anti-coking capability and improved catalytic performance evident through propene yields of 1927% over a 6 h DDH reaction.143 It was found that the dispersing action of Mg modification to V2O5 crystallites and an increase in active V3+ species reduced the amount and polymerization of coke deposits.\nThe concentration of dopant atoms, and the temperature of reduction were other contributing factors that affected the catalytic behaviour for ZrO2-based catalysts.3 Numerous binary YZrOx and LaZrOx-based catalysts displayed high activity, selectivity and stability as well as comparable performance to KCrOx/Al2O3 catalysts over the course of 60 DDH cycles at 550 C, 600 C and 625 C under industrially relevant conditions. The experimental parameters had a beneficial effect on the concentration of Zrcus4+ ions, and the concentration of surface lattice oxygen, which in tandem play an active role in propane activation.\nThe specific requirements of catalyst design for each sub-reaction are discussed and we identify that, regardless of the method of dehydrogenation, the balance of acid and base sites on the catalyst surface is of paramount importance.\nThe development of an active, selective and stable catalyst is essential for dehydrogenation to be considered as a viable process in the near- and long-term future.\nThe exact composition of the HGM is likely to include copper oxide and additional promotors such as MnO2, supported on α-Al2O3.\nThe role of Cu in the catalyst was to dilute the Pt species and promote desorption of propene, thereby enhancing selectivity.\nThe h-BN nanosheets provided abundant stacking fault edges terminated with BO defects that are associated with unpaired electrons, which strongly interact with active metal species, helping to strengthen the interaction between the metal and support.\nThe preparation of new catalysts with simultaneously enhanced activity, selectivity and stability is the ultimate goal.\nThe modification of Al2O3 with metal oxides, such as TiO2 has been undertaken with some promising results.\nThe enhanced performance was ascribed to electron transfer and acid site modulation effects resulting in changes to the adsorption properties of Pt.\nThe enhanced performance and stability was attributed to ultra-small, uniformly dispersed particles, ranging in size from 1.0 to 1.4 nm, consistent with previous studies that observed structure-sensitivity.\nThe role of the subsurface was to facilitate the activation of propane on the surface.\nThe role of the support is simply to maximise the active Cr6+ surface area, rather than add any chemical functionality, hence this is the reason why chemically-unreactive supports such as SiO2 and activated carbon yield the most active CrOX catalysts.\nThe most significant barrier to commercial application is the poor on-stream stability exhibited by all chromium-based catalysts.\nThe stability was improved in the presence of CO2 (compared to DDH); ca. 74% of the original activity was retained after 10 h on-stream, which is relatively good compared to Ga- and Cr-based catalysts.\nThe origin of stability was linked to the low rate of coking associated with the spinel catalyst.\nThe role of CO2 in ODH-CO2 is to assist the above equilibrium by removing H2via the RWGS reaction.\nThe origin of this induction period was found to be reduction of In2O3 to In0 nanoclusters, which suggests the active structure is more of a supported nanoparticle type catalyst than a mixed-metal oxide.\nThe basicity of the In/ZrO2 system was suggested to promote the RWGS reaction, which in turn boosted the ODH-CO2 activity.\nThe initial STY of this catalyst was 10.7 molC3H6 kgcat1 h1 (Table 13, entry 4), which is amongst the most active reported to date, but requires significant improvements to its on-stream stability.\nDespite the low selectivity, the FeCeO2 catalysts exhibited a comparable STY to supported In2O3 (Table 13) and some Ga2O3 catalysts (Table 12).\nThe major side-reactions observed were dry reforming and cracking.\nThe cationanion double hydrolysis approach (CADH), used for the synthesis of mesoporous Al2O3 with high surface area and a pure γ-Al2O3 phase, was undertaken with the crystallisation temperature varied between 25120 C.141 It was found that the crystallisation temperature of the support directly influenced the catalytic performance of the VOx/Al2O3 catalysts, which was a consequence of the increase in Lewis acid sites with increasing crystallization temperatures up to 100 C. This in turn affected the distribution of different surface V species.\nThe authors concluded that the relative proportions of V3+, V4+ and V5+ species present on the catalyst surface were affected by V loading and at the optimal loading of 12 wt%, a high concentration of isolated V3+ species was detected.\nGu et al. reported that P modification could greatly influence the structure and activity of VOx/Al2O3 catalysts.142 More specifically, P modification decreased the degree of VOx polymerization, which had positive implications on the catalyst stability, as evidenced by the retention of high activity (ca. 45% propane conversion) after an 8 h DDH reaction in all P-modified catalysts.\nThe combined and synergistic effect of the surface acidity modifications, their influence on the active V3+ species, and weakened metalsupport interactions facilitated desorption of propene and inhibited the deep dehydrogenation that leads to coke precursors.\nSubsequent studies on a VOx/Al2O3 catalysts (with 12 wt% V loading) modified with Mg revealed the anti-coking capability and improved catalytic performance evident through propene yields of 1927% over a 6 h DDH reaction.143 It was found that the dispersing action of Mg modification to V2O5 crystallites and an increase in active V3+ species reduced the amount and polymerization of coke deposits.\nThe highest STY achieved was 7.8 molC3H6 kg1cat h1 (Table 6, entry 7).\nThe moderate vanadium doping level was conducive to highly dispersed vanadium species in the form of isolated and low-polymerized VOx species.\nHighly dispersed and stable VOx species, and an absence of V2O5 crystallites, were conducive to high catalytic activity and stability.\nThe STY was 6.2 molC3H6 kg1cat h1 (Table 6, entry 5), due to the low GHSV so while the catalyst achieved high selectivity at reasonable propane conversion, it was not as intrinsically active as other supported VOx catalysts.\nThe most active catalyst, V/Si-beta (having 3 wt% V loading) displayed an initial propene yield of 33.4% and retained activity over multiple dehydrogenationregeneration cycles.\nThe STY was 4.4 molC3H6 kg1cat h1 (Table 6, entry 6), which is 56 times less active than the most active VOx catalysts reported to date, suggesting that Si-beta does not facilitate a high concentration of active V sites.\nIt was found that VOx/ZrO2 is approximately five times more active than VOx/Al2O3 and pure ZrO2, exhibiting a STY of 9.2 molC3H6 kg1cat h1 (Table 6, entry 2).\nThe authors proposed that the enhanced performance of VOx/ZrO2 results from the facile reduction of VO, VOV and VOZr bonds, thus producing higher proportions of the active V3+ species.\nFor the most active catalyst, with 8 wt% V loading, the initial yield of propene increased from 24% at 550 C to 28% at 575 C with a negligible (<1%) increase at 600 C.\nThis corresponded to a STY of 24 molC3H6 kg1cat h1 (Table 6, entry 3), which is one of the most active VOx-based catalysts reported.\nThe STY of ZrO2 without VOx is actually much higher than in the current work.\nThe most active V species has been identified, the relative proportion and stability of this surface V species can be tuned by varying the preparation method.\nThe role of the other V species on the DDH reaction remains unclear so further work to elucidate this could yield more active and stable DDH catalysts.\nThe range in performance of V-based catalysts varies quite significantly, with the most active catalysts exhibiting STYs that are around 34 time less active than the most active Pt catalysts.\nThe specific requirements of catalyst design for each sub-reaction are discussed and we identify that, regardless of the method of dehydrogenation, the balance of acid and base sites on the catalyst surface is of paramount importance.\nThe development of an active, selective and stable catalyst is essential for dehydrogenation to be considered as a viable process in the near- and long-term future.\nIn the case of SC and coal-based MTO, this is unavoidable due to the nature of the feedstock. However, natural gas and propane can be produced from biomass. In these cases, the feedstock is renewable and so these processes are potentially much more sustainable than when using fossil fuels.\nThe majority of analyses focus on well-established processes, where more information and data are available, but no such analyses were found for oxidative dehydrogenation.\nThe thermodynamic tendency to form undesirable by-products means that such reactions must be carefully kinetically controlled. Careful catalyst design can inhibit and even switch-off some of these side-reactions, as will be discussed in the subsequent sections.\nThe exact composition of the HGM is likely to include copper oxide and additional promotors such as MnO2, supported on α-Al2O3.\nThe role of Cu in the catalyst was to dilute the Pt species and promote desorption of propene, thereby enhancing selectivity.\nThe role of the subsurface was to facilitate the activation of propane on the surface.\nThe preparation strategy could greatly influence the structure of Ga/SiO2 catalysts.\nThe preparation of GaRh supported catalytically active liquid metal solutions.\nThe GaPt alloy melts at temperatures between 270 C and 330 C.\nThe activity is dependent on the bond strength of the VOsupport bond.\nThe metalsupport (VOsupport) interactions affect the resultant catalyst performance.\nThe catalyst deactivated quickly due to carbon deposition, but retained its initial activity over the course of ten successive dehydrogenationregeneration cycles.\nThe first study of Cr2O3-based catalysts for ODH-CO2 was reported by Takahara et al. in 1996 using Cr2O3 supported on SiO2, activated carbon (AC) or Al2O3.\nIt was found that over 5 wt% Cr2O3/SiO2, the propene yield increased from 6.5% to 9.1% when CO2 was co-fed instead of Ar.\nIn contrast, the alumina supported catalyst was inhibited by the addition of CO2, as shown by the drop in propene yield from 12.7% to 3.3%.\nThe 5 wt% Cr2O3/AC material was unaffected by CO2 addition.\nThe Cr2O3/SiO2 catalyst deactivated rapidly, retaining just 66% of its original activity after 4 h on-stream.\nThe stability was noted to the same with or without CO2 in the reactant feed.\nNot only did this study establish Cr2O3 as an active ODH-CO2 catalyst, it also captured one of the recurring themes in catalyst design for ODH-CO2: some catalysts are inhibited by the addition of CO2 while others perform much better.\nRelative to many other metal oxides, Cr2O3 is considered to be one of the most promising catalysts for ODH-CO2.\nTakehira et al. compared the catalytic performance of several d block and p block oxides (namely Cr, Ga, Ni, V, Fe, Mn and Co) supported on MCM-41, at 550 C with a CO2:C3H8 molar ratio of 5.6.\nAfter 30 min on-stream, the propene yield of the Cr-based catalyst was 15% whereas for the Ga-based counterpart it was 5%.\nThe remaining catalysts all exhibited lower propene yields (in the 14% range).\nHowever, as the catalysts were not characterised, it is unclear if the dispersion of these catalysts was comparable, and therefore if the results reflect the true intrinsic activity of each metal.\nIt was also noted that the order of reactivity resembled the trends observed by Nakagawa et al. for diamond-supported metal catalysts in the DDH reaction.\nThis suggests that there are commonalities in catalyst design between DDH and ODH-CO2 which most likely relate to the interaction of the alkane with the catalyst.\nContrary to this, Zhang et al. compared ZrO2, SBA-15 and γ-Al2O3 as supports for Cr2O3 in the DDH, ODH-CO2 and ODH-O2 reactions.\nThey found that the highest propene yield was observed with different catalyst systems under different dehydrogenation reactions, i.e., the activity trends in DDH did not translate to ODH-CO2 catalysts.\nSpecifically, Cr2O3/ZrO2 catalyst was the most active for the DDH reaction, while the highest yield of propene for the ODH-CO2 and ODH-O2 reactions was observed over Cr2O3/SBA-15 (Table 11, entry 7).\nAcross all the catalysts however, the highest propene yields were generally observed in the DDH reaction, ascribed to the production of carbon oxides in the ODH-O2 and ODH-CO2 reactions.\nHowever, it was reported that Cr2O3/ZrO2 was more stable on-stream in ODH-CO2 than in the DDH reaction.\nWu et al. also observed increased stability of Cr2O3/ZrO2 in the presence of CO2 (Table 11, entry 4).\nThey reported that the CO formation rate was higher than the CO2 consumption rate and the excess CO was suggested to originate from the Boudouard reaction (CO2 + C  2CO); this could explain the increased stability of this catalyst.\nIt is possible that some dry reforming of propane also took place, which would produce H2 and CO.\nZhao et al. recently reported the facile preparation of Cr supported in mesoporous ZrO2 using an evaporation-induced self-assembly method (Table 11, entry 6).\nThe authors suggested that propene could react with carbon dioxide to form carbon monoxide, methane and water.\nOther studies have reported a stronger inhibition effect for Cr2O3/ZrO2 catalysts in the presence of CO2.\nFor instance, Ferreira et al. studied the adsorption properties of CO2 and concluded that it binds strongly to active Cr2O3 sites, lowering the activity and stability of the catalyst,\nwhereas Xie et al. suggested that coke formation could originate from CO2 hydrogenation over Cr2+ species.\nThese conflicting reports may relate to the structural polymorph of ZrO2 present in the catalyst support; this factor is often overlooked, but recent studies from Kondratenko et al. revealed that nanocrystalline ZrO2 is an active DDH catalyst in its own right151,152 under similar reaction conditions.\nThe ZrO2 crystal phase and crystallite size were strongly correlated to the catalyst activity: smaller crystallites were more active but amorphous ZrO2 had very low intrinsic activity.\nMoreover, monoclinic ZrO2 was more active than tetragonal ZrO2.\nCr2O3-catalysed ODH-CO2 has been examined over different polymorphs of SiO2,254256 including various structured porous oxides, including SBA-1,84 SBA-15,250,257 MCM-41,91 amorphous silica84 and mesoporous silica spheres.258\nNotably, Michorczyk et al. reported a detailed comparison of different silica supports, coupled with an in-depth characterisation study.84\nIt was shown that in each case, the same active Cr species was formed, namely Cr6+, but higher surface area silicas (e.g., SBA-1 and SBA-15) were able to facilitate a higher number of such sites.\nA clear correlation was found between the rate of propene formation and the wt% of Cr6+, as determined using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS).\nIn DDH, while Cr6+ is considered active, under reaction conditions Cr3+ is rapidly formed and considered the principle active species.93,94\nThe selectivity to propene was similar across the different silica supports (8893%), with the observed differences being attributable to differences in propane conversion rather than catalytic properties.\nThese Cr2O3/SiO2 catalysts were highly active at 550 C and the most active catalyst (Cr2O3/SBA-1) achieved a STY of 7.9 molC3H6 kgcat1 h1, as shown in Table 11, entry 12.\nIt should be noted that the experiments were carried out with a CO2:C3H8 ratio of 5, which as discussed above, has been shown to enable a higher equilibrium yield of propene.\nTherefore, in studies where high conversions are generally targeted and carbon dioxide is in excess of propane, higher propene yields are reported.\nTakehira et al. carried out X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) on CrOx/MCM-41, confirming that the reduction of Cr6+ occurs during the reaction.91\nSpecifically, they identified Cr6+O4 tetrahedra as the active species.\nThese Cr3+O6 octahedra were formed after reduction, which were considered to be less active.\nIt was shown that CO2 could re-oxidise the Cr, which suggests that the redox cycle between Cr6+ and Cr3+ is an important process during the reaction.\nYi et al. discriminated between isolated Cr6+ and polymeric Cr6+, finding that after reduction, isolated Cr3+ was more active than polymeric Cr3+. This underlines the importance of Cr dispersion in these catalysts.259\nIn a more detailed examination of Cr2O3/SBA-1, the relationship between the physicochemical properties of the catalyst and the observed activity were explored.85\nMichorczyk et al. found a strong positive correlation between the initial propene yield and the reducibility of the catalyst, specifically the H2 consumption.\nIn situ UV-vis measurements revealed that Cr6+ is rapidly reduced to Cr3+ or Cr2+ in the presence of C3H8 under reaction conditions.\nThe reaction proceeds through a Mars-Van Krevelen mechanism, via the Cr2+/3+ redox couple.\nRapid deactivation, typical of Cr2O3 catalysts, was observed, although the majority of the initial activity could be recovered after regeneration in air.\nThe remainder was ascribed to pore collapse and/or the formation of inactive Cr sites, although the loss of surface Cr sites through agglomeration was not considered.\nDespite early reports that activated carbon (AC) was not a suitable support for Cr2O3, subsequent studies have shown that above 550 C, the activity of Cr2O3/AC in the presence of CO2 was higher than in the DDH reaction.260\nThe enhancement in propane conversion due to the presence of CO2 increased at higher temperatures (i.e., above 600 C), although this was chiefly due to propane dry reforming proceeding, generating CO and H2 rather than propene.\nWhile this Cr2O3/AC exhibited the highest STY of propene out of all CrOx-based catalysts (21 molC3H6 kgcat1 h1, Table 11, entry 9), it rapidly deactivated on-stream and due to the support being carbonaceous, cannot be regenerated using air.\nThis severely limits the utility of this catalyst.\nZeolites have also been considered as catalyst supports for Cr2O3.\nZhang et al. prepared CrOx/Na-ZSM-5 via incipient wetness.261\nAlthough the initial conversion and selectivity was high (48% and 86%, respectively) (Table 11, entry 5), the catalysts deactivated rapidly and the reaction conditions were such that the STY was only 2.5 molC3H6 kgcat1 h1 at 550 C with a CO2:C3H8 ratio of 2.\nZhu et al. investigated a range of MFI supports, including silicalite-1 and H[B]MFI.262\nCrOx/H[B]MFI was found to be the most active catalyst, giving a STY of 4.7 molC3H6 kgcat1 h1 at 600 C with a CO2:C3H8 of 1 (Table 11, entry 15).\nAlthough the as-prepared catalyst exhibited typically poor stability for Cr catalysts, steam treating the catalyst resulted in a marked improvement.\nAfter 60 h on-stream, the as-prepared catalyst retained only 25% of its initial conversion, while the steam treated catalyst retained ca. 74%.\nThe authors ascribed the effect to stabilised Cr3+ formed in the steam treatment.\nPresumably the reduction of Cr6+ during the reaction results in an inactive or less active Cr3+ species.\nIt should also be noted that the as-prepared catalyst was initially almost twice as active as the steam treated catalyst, which leaves the possibility that at higher conversions, increased coke formation may have occurred which would exaggerate the deactivation compared to the steam treated catalyst.\nIdeally such stability comparisons would be made at isoconversion, however this discovery is one of only a few that shows improved stability on-stream.\nRecently, Michorczyk et al. prepared a Cr-β-zeolite and investigated the effect of dealumination, which clearly elucidated the effect of acidity on the catalytic performance.263\nIt was reported that the dealuminated catalyst, Cr-SiBeta, exhibited significantly higher propene yields (up to 27%), compared to the Al-containing catalyst, Cr-AlBeta (2%).\nThe presence of acid sites in the Cr-AlBeta catalyst resulted in cracking pathways that led to increased production of methane and ethene.\nMoreover, the CrAlbeta catalyst performed less well in the presence of CO2 than in the DDH reaction.\nThis was explained by the strong adsorption of CO2 on the catalyst, similar to the inhibition observed over Cr2O3/Al2O3 catalysts.\nThe stability of the dealuminated catalyst was also improved compared with CrAlbeta, but significant loss in activity was observed over the 4 h reaction.\nIn considering the redox properties of the catalysts in this work, and their previous investigations, the authors also identified a strong correlation between the H2 consumption from H2-TPR studies and the reported propene yield, as shown in Fig. 10.\nWhile the majority of investigations on ODH-CO2 Cr2O3 catalysts have focused on support modifications, the addition of a promotor has also been shown to be beneficial.\nYun et al. demonstrated that the addition of 0.5 wt% Ni to a 10 wt% CrOx/SBA-15 catalyst increased the propane and CO2 conversion, as well as the on-stream stability.264\nAfter 1 h on-stream, the Ni-promoted catalyst was 50% more active and the conversion and selectivity was almost maintained over 12 h on-stream.\nIn contrast, the less active unpromoted catalyst retained only half of the initial activity over the same time period.\nUsing three-stage H2-TPR experiments (where the catalyst is reduced twice under H2 and then re-oxidised in CO2 before the final H2-TPR program), the authors showed that the addition of Ni facilitated the re-oxidation of Cr during the reaction.\nThis is consistent with previously reported mechanisms of deactivation over Cr-based catalysts, although coking is also often reported to cause deactivation.\nInterestingly, the promoted catalyst was marginally more prone to coking.\nThis strongly suggests that overreduction of active Cr sites is the key deactivation mechanism over these catalysts.\nThere is a lot of potential to develop promoted Cr catalysts that could enhance the redox activity of the catalyst; precious metals including Pd and Pt are often supported on reducible supports for this purpose.265\nCrucially, it was found that above 0.5 wt% Ni, propane reforming was prevalent, which underlines the importance of appropriate loadings of promotors.\nO'Brien et al. investigated the effect of a Ru promoter to a 10 wt% CrOx/SiO2 catalyst.\nConsistent with Yun et al. it was shown that the propene formation rate was increased.\nA 1 wt% Ru loading was optimal and doubled the activity.\nInterestingly, this is approximately the same molar ratio reported as the optimum by Yun et al. for Ni-promoted CrOx/SBA-15 (Table 11, entry 14).\nAnother similarity was the propensity of reforming to dominate at high loadings (>1 wt%).\nThe enhanced stability seen in Ni-promoted Cr catalysts was not observed in this work and the activity could not be fully recovered after regeneration.\nConsequently, aggregation of Cr species was suggested as an additional deactivation mechanism in addition to coke formation and overreduction of Cr.\nRather than aid Cr re-oxidation in a one-step oxidative dehydrogenation, the authors concluded that the Ru promotes the RWGS reaction, which removes H2 and increases the equilibrium conversion of propane.\nHowever, the results of three-stage H2-TPR reactions indicated that Cr can be more easily oxidised in the presence of Ru, which suggests that Ru can participate in a similar role as Ni-promoted Cr catalysts.\nOverall supported chromium oxide catalysts represent one of the most active classes of ODH-CO2 catalysts, with STY values in the range of 222 molC3H6 kgcat1 h1.\nThe role of the support is simply to maximise the active Cr6+ surface area, rather than add any chemical functionality, hence this is the reason why chemically-unreactive supports such as SiO2 and activated carbon yield the most active CrOX catalysts.\nThe most significant barrier to commercial application is the poor on-stream stability exhibited by all chromium-based catalysts.\nWhile incremental improvements in the activity of Cr catalysts have been reported since their initial discovery, significant advances in catalyst stability have been relatively few.\nThe first study of Cr2O3-based catalysts for ODH-CO2 was reported by Takahara et al. in 1996 using Cr2O3 supported on SiO2, activated carbon (AC) or Al2O3.\nThe 5 wt% Cr2O3/SiO2 catalyst deactivated rapidly, retaining just 66% of its original activity after 4 h on-stream.\nThe stability was noted to the same with or without CO2 in the reactant feed.\nNot only did this study establish Cr2O3 as an active ODH-CO2 catalyst, it also captured one of the recurring themes in catalyst design for ODH-CO2: some catalysts are inhibited by the addition of CO2 while others perform much better.\nThe correct balance of acidic and basic sites is a key consideration in catalyst design.\nEqually, the ratio of carbon dioxide to propane is important to take in account, as it has kinetic and thermodynamic implications.\nThermodynamically, higher CO2:C3H8 ratios limit coke forming side-reactions.\nThe addition of CO2 in the dehydrogenation reaction has multiple effects: As discussed in Section 2, it facilitates the RWGS reaction which removes H2 from the system and shifts the thermodynamic equilibrium limit to favour propene production.\nAdditionally, CO2 can dissociate on the surface of a catalyst and provide O species to dehydrogenate propane directly.\nFinally, it can react with coke via the reverse-Boudouard reaction to produce CO, which can potentially extend the lifetime of the catalyst.\nThe role of the support is simply to maximise the active Cr6+ surface area, rather than add any chemical functionality, hence this is the reason why chemically-unreactive supports such as SiO2 and activated carbon yield the most active CrOX catalysts.\nThe most significant barrier to commercial application is the poor on-stream stability exhibited by all chromium-based catalysts.\nWhile incremental improvements in the activity of Cr catalysts have been reported since their initial discovery, significant advances in catalyst stability have been relatively few.\nThe addition of Al2O3 to ODH-CO2 catalysts is typically not beneficial.\nAlthough the addition of Al2O3 to ODH-CO2 catalysts is typically not beneficial, Chen et al. investigated spinel-type Ga2O3Al2O3 mixed oxides and showed that they can function as stable catalysts.\nThe origin of stability was linked to the low rate of coking associated with the spinel catalyst.\nUsing NH3-TPD analysis, the authors concluded that weak Lewis acid sites were conducive to high activity.\nThese acidbase properties most likely contribute to the enhanced stability as well; it is known that stronger acid sites promote oligomerisation pathways that produce coke.\nThe increased performance of Ga2O3/ZSM-48 was attributed to the abundance of weak and medium strength acid sites.\nThe low activity of Ga2O3/MgO and Ga2O3/SiO2 was ascribed to the absence of medium and strong acid sites.\nIn the Ga2O3/TiO2 catalyst, a significant proportion of the Ga (45%) was reduced.\nThis catalyst exhibited the highest propane conversion, but with a propene selectivity of 73% it did not result in the highest propene yield.\nThe origin of this induction period was found to be reduction of In2O3 to In0 nanoclusters, which suggests the active structure is more of a supported nanoparticle type catalyst than a mixed-metal oxide.\nThe basicity of the In/ZrO2 system was suggested to promote the RWGS reaction, which in turn boosted the ODH-CO2 activity.\nIt was found that 10 mol% Fe in CeO2 exhibited the highest propene yield.\nThe major side-reactions observed were dry reforming and cracking.\nThey showed that reforming pathways were more prevalent at higher CO2:C3H8 ratios, such as 2.5:1 and 5:1.\nDespite the low selectivity, the FeCeO2 catalysts exhibited a comparable STY to supported In2O3 and some Ga2O3 catalysts.\nThe number of studies on supported nanoparticle catalysts for ODH-CO2 are relatively few and those available indicate that this field of research has great potential.\nThe major challenge is in understanding and inhibiting side-reactions such as reforming, which are known to proceed over this class of catalyst, unlike in Cr- and Ga-based catalysts.\nCareful consideration of the nanostructure and composition has shown that the selectivity can be readily tuned to favour different pathways, and further investigation in this area may well be able to harness the high activity of supported nanoparticles as well as favour dehydrogenation pathways.\nDespite dozens of reports over several decades on Cr- and Ga- based catalysts, the improvements in catalyst performance have been incremental.\nThe knowledge gained from these studies on the importance of reducibility and the balance of acid and base sites should be applied to supported NP catalysts, which are a promising and somewhat neglected category of ODH-CO2 catalyst.\nThe specific requirements of catalyst design for each sub-reaction are discussed and we identify that, regardless of the method of dehydrogenation, the balance of acid and base sites on the catalyst surface is of paramount importance.\nThe development of an active, selective and stable catalyst is essential for dehydrogenation to be considered as a viable process in the near- and long-term future.\nIn the case of SC and coal-based MTO, this is unavoidable due to the nature of the feedstock. However, natural gas and propane can be produced from biomass.\nThe increased interest in direct propane dehydrogenation has been enhanced by the fall in propane price, which is the direct result of the discovery of vast shale gas reserves in North America.\nThe production of renewable green propane (also called bio-propane and bioLPG) is an emerging sector which is already being operated on a large scale.\nWith increasing pressure to source chemical feedstocks sustainably, we can expect that new interest will focus on renewable and green routes to the key platform chemicals currently required by modern society, and that green propane will play an important role in this.\nThe majority (86%) of filed patents are for DDH catalysts, followed by ODH-O2 (12%) and finally ODH-CO2 (2.4%).\nThe exact composition of the HGM is likely to include copper oxide and additional promotors such as MnO2, supported on α-Al2O3.\nThe importance of Al speciation in improving catalyst performance and stability was investigated by Shi et al.\nThe modification of Al2O3 with metal oxides, such as TiO2 has been undertaken with some promising results.\nThe role of Cu in the catalyst was to dilute the Pt species and promote desorption of propene, thereby enhancing selectivity.\nThe role of the subsurface was to facilitate the activation of propane on the surface.\nThe irreversible initial deactivation in the consecutive DDH cycles was attributed to either: (i) structural changes of active species (such as agglomeration), or (ii) collapse of pore structure.\nThe positive effect was attributed to the promoters ability to block the sites responsible for coke formation and negligible contribution to undesirable secondary reactions by the additional acid sites generated by the P-based modifier.\nThe authors attributed this enhanced performance to a high dispersion of Cr species, moderate acidity and strong metalsupport interactions in the CrOx/H-ZSM-5(260) catalyst.\nThe authors attributed high Ga/Al ratios (>0.5) with the formation of additional GaxOy clusters which negatively affected the dehydrogenation rate and thus catalytic performance.\nThe activity is dependent on the bond strength of the VOsupport bond. Therefore, it is expected that catalyst performance is affected when different supports, such as SiO2, Al2O3 and ZrO2 are utilised.", "English": "The physicochemical properties of catalysts, including chemical qualities and morphological characteristics, significantly influence their performance in dehydrogenation reactions. The crystallization temperature of the support directly affects the catalytic performance of VOx/Al2O3 catalysts by increasing Lewis acid sites and influencing the distribution of different surface V species. P modification can decrease the degree of VOx polymerization, enhancing catalyst stability and activity. Mg modification can improve catalytic performance and anti-coking capability by dispersing V2O5 crystallites and increasing active V3+ species. Gelation and calcination temperatures also impact the catalytic performance of VOx/SiO2 catalysts in terms of propane conversion, propene selectivity, and yield of propene. Dealuminated beta zeolites (Si-beta) are promising catalyst supports due to their high surface area and thermal stability, and the initial propane conversion linearly increases with the amount of acid sites. VOx/ZrO2 is more active than VOx/Al2O3 and pure ZrO2 due to the facile reduction of VO, VOV, and VOZr bonds, producing higher proportions of the active V3+ species. The balance of acid and base sites on the catalyst surface is crucial for all dehydrogenation methods. The development of an active, selective, and stable catalyst is essential for dehydrogenation to be considered a viable process in the future. Support modification strategies can optimize these properties for enhanced catalytic efficiency and selectivity. Using supports with ordered mesoporosity and moderate surface acidity can aid mass transfer and avoid undesirable secondary reactions. Promoting elements can cause beneficial geometric and electronic effects on both the supports and active species. However, environmental and safety concerns exist in the preparation, usage, and disposal of certain catalysts due to their toxicity. Ga catalysts, while less active than Pt and Cr catalysts, have the advantage of being benign and inexpensive. The nature of the support is essential for vanadium-based catalysts, as the metalsupport interactions affect the resultant catalyst performance. The activity is dependent on the bond strength of the VOsupport bond, and catalyst performance is affected by different supports.", "Chinese": "所有答案结果中的汇总中文答案 1", "Doi": "10.1039/D1GC03700E"},

The equilibrium conversion of alkanes increases with temperature, but alkene selectivity decreases due to an increased tendency toward dehydrocyclization/aromatisation, thermal cracking, and coke formation. The extent of PtSn interactions depends on the impregnation sequence of Pt and Sn precursors on the support material. The framework of microporous zeolites exerts dispersive forces on reactant molecules, which depend on the shape, channel, and cavity of the framework. The nature and density of active sites also influence the framework dispersion forces. Recent reports have shown that the strong electrostatic field between protons or exchanged metal ions and basic oxygen species can enhance and/or induce polarization of bonds in hydrocarbon adsorbates. This polarization effect can be viewed as an intermediate condition to hydride abstraction, an important elementary step in CH activation. The polarizing effect increases with increasing charge magnitude and ionic radius of the alkane polarizing cations. The choice of cations should be such that they exhibit no catalytic effects on the target alkene products at the reaction condition. It may be beneficial to create a CH polarization effect on the zeolite framework by appropriate modification of framework atoms. Active sites are usually created on the zeolite frameworks. The active sites of the bimolecular pathway are formed in situ and are made up of an alkyl carbenium ion ionically held to the zeolite framework oxygen ion. The active sites of the unimolecular pathway are the charge balancing protons of the zeolite framework. A proton and a carbenium ion are electrophilic or Lewis acid species, and the two pathways essentially involve electrophilic CH activation. The exchanged metal ions in zeolites are held ionically by one or more basic oxygen atoms. Different species have been suggested, depending on the density of the cation exchange site of the zeolite and the method of introduction of the metals. High alkene selectivities are obtained on the H-ZSM-5 when exchangeable protons are rigorously replaced by Zn and Ga. The CH activation on the OZn2+O site can be described by a Lewis base-assisted deprotonation mechanism, accompanied by conversion of the Lewis base site to a conjugate Bronsted acid site. The OGa+ site, however, activates the CH bond via oxidative addition without a protonic site intermediate. A protonic site intermediate increases the tendency of side reactions on the Zn-exchanged H-ZSM-5 relative to the Ga counterpart. The elementary steps of CH activation on OGa+ reveal that a redox cycle at the metal center is required for catalytic CH activation via the oxidative addition mechanism. However, under alkane dehydrogenation reaction conditions, the OZn2+O sites can undergo a reversible Zn2+/Zn redox process, increasing the availability of undesired protonic site intermediates. Zn-exchanged H-ZSM-5 prepared by conventional ion-exchange methods contain a significant percentage of unexchanged proton sites, leading to lower alkene selectivity of the catalyst. Another strategy to enhance alkene selectivity is by controlling the strength of the proton sites. The acidity of the sites depends on the nature of the trivalent cation of the zeolite framework. Proton sites in borosilicate zeolites are weaker than those of aluminosilicate, and thus higher alkene selectivity is expected for alkane dehydrogenation over Zn/H[B]-ZSM-5 compared to Zn/H[Al]-ZSM-5. However, Zn/H[B]-ZSM-5 shows no activity for propane dehydrogenation. The desired weaker acidity of the proton sites of Zn/H[B]-ZSM-5 requires weaker basicity of the oxygen atoms in the zeolite framework. This reduced basicity of the oxygen atoms is not sufficiently polarizing to complement the exchanged Zn2+ in CH bond cleavage. Elimination of the proton sites of zeolites is critical for obtaining a high alkene selectivity and stability in dehydrogenation catalysts. Pt is the most versatile noble metal catalyst for alkane reactions, often justified by its higher activity, stability, and selectivity for these reactions compared to less expensive alternative transition metals. However, rapid catalyst deactivation due to coke formation remains a challenge even when using a Pt-based catalyst for dehydrogenation of light alkanes. The presence of acid (Bronsted and Lewis) sites on the supports promotes readsorption, oligomerization, and aromatization of alkenes. Promotion of Pt with metals, such as Sn, Ga, Zn, Re, etc., improves catalyst stability, but also leads to faster deactivation rates than Pt/Na[Fe]-ZSM-5. The role of potassium in commercial Cr and Pt-based dehydrogenation catalysts is to minimize the undesired influence of protonic sites on alkene selectivity. The nature and role of surface oxygen species become more evident. The electronic promotion effect of Sn is in line with the oxidative addition CH activation mechanism. However, the Lewis base-assisted deprotonation mechanism could also explain the proposed CH activation on Cr-based catalysts. A recent report suggests that a porous copper-aluminum framework material (stabilized by metal oxide) has better performance (activity/selectivity/stability) for propane dehydrogenation than a PtSn/Al2O3. The Lewis base-assisted deprotonation mechanism may be invoked here, and the redox property of the metal center is likely to play a role in achieving propane dehydrogenation at 350 C. This should constitute the future research direction for non-oxidative dehydrogenation of lower alkanes.", "Chinese": "催化剂的物理化学性质，包括化学品质（如酸强度和稳定性）和形态特征，对脱氢反应的性能有重大影响。随着温度的升高，烷烃的平衡转化率增加，但由于脱氢环化/芳构化、热裂解和焦炭形成的倾向增加，烯烃的选择性降低。PtSn相互作用的程度取决于Pt和Sn前体在支撑材料上的浸渍顺序。微孔沸石框架对反应物分子施加的分散力取决于框架的形状、通道和腔体。活性位点的性质和密度也影响框架的分散力。最近的报告表明，质子或交换金属离子与基本氧物种之间的强静电场可以增强和/或诱导烃吸附物中键的极化。这种极化效应可以视为向氢化物抽离过渡的中间条件，这是CH活化的重要基本步骤。极化效应随电荷大小和离子半径的增加而增加。选择的阳离子应确保在反应条件下对目标烯烃产品没有催化作用。在沸石框架上创造CH极化效应可能是有益的，这可以通过适当修改框架原子来实现。活性位点通常在沸石框架上创建。双分子途径的活性位点是原位形成的，由离子结合到沸石框架氧离子的烷基卡宾离子组成。单分子途径的活性位点是沸石框架的质子平衡电荷。质子和卡宾离子是亲电性或路易斯酸性物种，两种途径本质上涉及亲电性CH活化。沸石中交换的金属离子通过一个或多个基本氧原子离子结合。根据沸石的阳离子交换位点密度和金属的引入方法，提出了不同的物种。当可交换的质子被严格替换为Zn和Ga时，H-ZSM-5获得了高烯烃选择性。OZn2+O位点上的CH活化可以通过路易斯碱辅助脱质子机制来描述，伴随路易斯碱位点转化为共轭布龙斯特酸位点。然而，OGa+位点通过氧化加成而不是质子位点中间体活化CH键。质子位点中间体增加了Zn交换的H-ZSM-5相对于Ga对应物的副反应倾向。OGa+的CH活化基本步骤揭示，金属中心的氧化还原循环是通过氧化加成机制催化CH活化所必需的。然而，在烷烃脱氢反应条件下，OZn2+O位点可以经历可逆的Zn2+/Zn氧化还原过程，增加了不希望的质子位点中间体的可用性。通过传统离子交换方法制备的Zn交换H-ZSM-5含有大量未交换的质子位点，导致催化剂的烯烃选择性降低。另一种增强烯烃选择性的策略是控制质子位点的强度。位点的酸性取决于沸石框架中三价阳离子的性质。硼硅酸盐沸石中的质子位点比铝硅酸盐弱，因此预计Zn/H[B]-ZSM-5在烷烃脱氢中的烯烃选择性高于Zn/H[Al]-ZSM-5。然而，Zn/H[B]-ZSM-5在丙烷脱氢中没有活性。Zn/H[B]-ZSM-5中所需较弱的质子位点酸性需要沸石框架中氧原子的较弱碱性。这种氧原子碱性的降低不足以补充交换的Zn2+在CH键断裂中的作用。消除沸石的质子位点对于获得高烯烃选择性和脱氢催化剂的稳定性至关重要。Pt是烷烃反应中最通用的贵金属催化剂，通常因其在这些反应中的较高活性、稳定性和选择性而被证明是合理的，与成本较低的替代过渡金属相比。然而，即使使用Pt基催化剂进行轻烷烃脱氢，由于焦炭形成导致的催化剂失活速度仍然很快。支持物上的酸（布龙斯特和路易斯）位点促进了烯烃的再吸附、寡聚化和芳构化。Pt与Sn、Ga、Zn、Re等金属的促进提高了催化剂的稳定性，但与Pt/Na[Fe]-ZSM-5相比，失活速度也更快。商业Cr和Pt基脱氢催化剂中钾的作用是最大限度地减少质子位点对烯烃选择性的不利影响。表面氧物种的性质和作用变得更加明显。Sn的电子促进效应与氧化加成CH活化机制一致。然而，路易斯碱辅助脱质子机制也可以解释在Cr基催化剂上提出的CH活化。最近的一份报告表明，一种多孔铜铝框架材料（由金属氧化物稳定）在丙烷脱氢中的性能（活性/选择性/稳定性）优于PtSn/Al2O3。可以在此处调用路易斯碱辅助脱质子机制，金属中心的氧化还原性质可能在实现350°C下的丙烷脱氢中发挥作用。这应该是非氧化脱氢较低烷烃的未来研究方向。", "Doi": "10.1016/j.fuproc.2016.04.016"},

site structures and dehydrogenation mechanisms are followed in the PDH process from a fundamental perspective.\n          In this section, the active sites, dehydrogenation pathways and deactivation mechanisms on Pt-based and representative metal oxide-based catalysts would be clarified.\n          The coordination saturated Pt atoms are more selective for propane dehydrogenation, while the coordinatively unsaturated Pt atoms will catalyze the side reactions, such as CC breaking and deep dehydrogenation, resulting in the formation of carbon deposits.\n          The adsorption configuration and strength of propylene can be both greatly perturbed by surface structures, coke formation is inherently governed by the surface geometric and electronic structures, and thus the construction of specific reaction ensembles is important.\n          Tuning the support's acidity and coke mobility can also inhibit the coke formation.\n          The effective strategies for inhibiting coke are summarized as follows.\n          Geometric separation: Previous research studies have shown that separating the active metal components could inhibit the structure-sensitive side reactions with improved propylene selectivity.\n          Electron richness: A high electron density of Pt particles is beneficial to weaken Pt(CC) bonds, inhibit coke precursors, and suppress deep

coke on acidic supports can also suppress the diffusion of reactive molecules.\n          Cofeeding streams: In addition to the modulation of catalyst structures and the properties of supports, changes in reaction conditions by cofeeding streams, such as H2, and CO2, can also have a positive effect on coke elimination.\n          Enhancing oxygen mobility: The oxidation of the adsorbed surface carbonaceous species can help eliminate the coke deposition over supported metals and thus is beneficial to the improvement of catalytic stability.\n          Coke transfer: In addition to

supports with high surface area and uniform pore size distribution are preferred.\n          Some alkaline metals, such as Li, Na, and K, can help poison the strong acid sites and avoid the coke deposition on the Al2O3 surface.\n          Additionally, doping Mg into Al2O3 forms a stable spinel phase.\n          An-Hui Lu and coworkers indicated that Al2O3 nanosheets with abundant penta-coordinate Al atoms have a strong metalsupport interaction owing to their capacity for anchoring Pt atoms, which accounts for their high stability.\n          Due to the weak interaction between

This crystal structure has a high concentration of weak Lewis acid sites (coordinatively unsaturated tetrahedral ones on the surface of the material), which are deemed to be centers of dehydrogenation activity.\n          The assignment of Lewis acid sites as the active species was substantiated by Chen et al., who, by relating the results of NH3-TPD measurements with activity data for different GaxAl10xO15 mixed oxides, showed that a high concentration of Lewis acid groups in the form of coordinatively unsaturated tetrahedral Ga3+ cations is a prerequisite for dehydrogenation activity.\n          Xu et al. reported dehydrogenation activity on both Lewis and Brnsted acid sites on GaO3/H-ZSM-5. A zeolitic support displaying a low concentration of medium and strong acid sites and a relatively high concentration of weak acid sites was found to lead to the most active and stable catalyst.\n          Michorczyk et al. concluded that acidic groups catalyze the reaction after observing that promotion with a base, such as potassium, resulted in a decrease in activity.\n          The structure of the support is also important, as a mesoporous GaAl mixed oxide exhibited an increased resistance to catalyst coking.\n          The function of K was to reduce coke formation by poisoning Brnsted acid sites.\n          Pt is believed to act as a promoter for the GaOx. Indeed, albeit 1000 ppm Pt/Al2O3 was found to be virtually inactive, 1000 ppm of Pt in combination with 3 wt % Ga afforded conversions close to the equilibrium and an propylene selectivity <95%.\n          The role of Pt is to assist hydrogen desorption, which facilitates the regeneration of the gallium hydride hydroxide species.\n          The exact nature of the active sites in Ga-based dehydrogenation catalysts is still under debate.\n          The chemistry of molybdenum oxide is comparable to that of vanadium oxide, as Mo can be present as MoOx monomers, polymers, or MoO3 crystallites, depending on the molybdenum loading, the type of support used, and catalyst preparation conditions.\n          The reducibility of the catalyst with hydrogen prior to reaction increases conversion, although selectivity decreases due to the formation of acid sites.\n          The chemistry of molybdenum oxide is comparable to that of vanadium oxide, as Mo can be present as MoOx monomers, polymers, or MoO3 crystallites, depending on the molybdenum loading, the type of support used, and catalyst preparation conditions.\n          The reducibility of the catalyst with hydrogen prior to reaction increases conversion, although selectivity decreases due to the formation of acid sites.\n          The chemistry of molybdenum oxide is comparable to that of vanadium oxide, as Mo can be present as MoOx monomers, polymers, or MoO3 crystallites, depending on the molybdenum loading, the type of support used, and catalyst preparation conditions.\n          The reducibility of the catalyst with hydrogen prior to reaction increases conversion, although selectivity decreases due to the formation of acid sites.\n          The chemistry of molybdenum oxide is comparable to that of vanadium oxide, as Mo can be present as MoOx monomers, polymers, or MoO3 crystallites, depending on the molybdenum loading, the type of support used, and catalyst preparation conditions.\n          The reducibility of the catalyst with hydrogen prior to reaction increases conversion, although selectivity decreases due to the formation of acid sites.\n          The chemistry of molybdenum oxide is comparable to that of vanadium oxide, as Mo can be present as MoOx monomers, polymers, or MoO3 crystallites, depending on the molybdenum loading, the type of support used, and catalyst preparation conditions.\n          The reducibility of the catalyst with hydrogen prior to reaction increases conversion, although selectivity decreases due to the formation of acid sites.\n          The chemistry of molybdenum oxide is comparable to that of vanadium oxide, as Mo can be present as MoOx monomers, polymers, or MoO3 crystallites, depending on the molybdenum loading, the type of support used, and catalyst preparation conditions.\n          The reducibility of the catalyst with hydrogen prior to reaction increases conversion, although selectivity decreases due to the formation of acid sites.\n          The chemistry of molybdenum oxide is comparable to that of vanadium oxide, as Mo can be present as MoOx monomers, polymers, or MoO3 crystallites, depending on the molybdenum loading, the type of support used, and catalyst preparation conditions.\n          The reducibility of the catalyst with hydrogen prior to reaction increases conversion, although selectivity decreases due to the formation of acid sites.\n          Alumina is by far the most common support, and a variety of methods to produce chromiaalumina catalysts have been investigated.\n          The nature of the support is important not only because it governs the mechanical properties of the catalyst, but also because the interaction of the carrier with the active phase can have a profound impact on catalyst activity and selectivity.\n          Albeit selectivity has been found to be insensitive to chromium loading, it does change over time.\n          The use of zirconia as an alternative support has also been investigated.\n          The use of silica as the support in chromia-based dehydrogenation catalysts requires a relative high surface area to stabilize Cr6+ sites.\n          CrMgAl and CrMg mixed oxides prepared using layered double hydroxide (LDH) precursors have been studied as catalysts for the nonoxidative dehydrogenation of ethane.\n          Finally, the study of porous chromia-pillared α-zirconium phosphate materials has been particularly informative with regards to the influence that acidity has on catalytic behavior.\n          The surface area-to-metal loading ratio determines which species will form. Indeed, Wu et al. reported that monomeric species are predominantly present below 1.2 V/nm2, polymeric vanadium species prevail between 1.2 and 4.4 V/nm2, and crystalline V2O5 species preponderate at even higher loadings.\n          On the one hand, the presence of hydroxyl groups on the surface of the support is important to obtain a well-dispersed catalyst, as OH groups serve as anchoring sites for the vanadium precursors used to prepare these catalysts. On the other hand, acid sites are detrimental for catalyst performance, because they facilitate cracking and induce coke formation.\n          Alumina is commonly used as a support for vanadium oxide catalysts, although Sokolov et al. concluded through testing a wide range of Si- and Al-based supports that using silica to dope the alumina support provides beneficial effects on catalyst stability and activity.\n          Furthermore, as was shown by Harlin et al., the performance of supported vanadium catalysts can be improved through the addition of MgO, either as a promoter or as a component of a mixed oxide. According to these workers, the increase in dehydrogenation selectivity stems from the basic nature of MgO, resulting in reduced coke formation.\n          The reducibility of the vanadium species depends on their molecular structure, VOV and VO bonds being more easily reduced than VO-support bonds.\n          Prior to reaction, the vanadium in these catalysts is generally present as V5+.

The interaction between the support and the active phase can also alter the electronic properties of the catalyst, which can further enhance its performance. Support modification strategies, such as doping with alkali metals or using mixed oxides, can optimize these properties for enhanced catalytic efficiency and selectivity.

For example, the surface area-to-metal loading ratio determines the formation of different vanadium species, which affects the catalytic activity. The reducibility of vanadium species also influences the catalytic performance. The addition of MgO can improve the selectivity of vanadium-based catalysts by reducing coke formation. Using silica to dope alumina support can enhance the stability and activity of vanadium oxide catalysts. The type of support and preparation conditions can affect the formation of molybdenum oxide species. Hydrogen reduction can increase conversion but decrease selectivity due to the formation of acid sites. The structure of the support, such as mesoporous GaAl mixed oxide, can increase the resistance to catalyst coking. Poisoning Brnsted acid sites with K can reduce coke formation. Alumina is the most common support, and various methods have been explored to produce chromia-alumina catalysts. The choice of support can also influence the stability and dispersion of the active phase, which in turn affects the catalytic efficiency and selectivity. For example, zirconia has been investigated as an alternative support due to its low surface acidity and enhanced sintering resistance, which can improve the performance of chromia-based catalysts. The acidity of the support can also play a role in catalytic behavior, as demonstrated by the study of porous chromia-pillared α-zirconium phosphate materials. Support modification strategies, such as doping with alkali metals or using mixed oxides, can optimize these properties for enhanced catalytic efficiency and selectivity. For instance, doping with alkali metals can stabilize the structure of the support, reduce surface acidity, and increase the number of active sites. Using mixed oxides can also improve the thermal stability and coking resistance of the catalysts. The surface area-to-metal loading ratio determines the formation of monomeric, polymeric, or crystalline vanadium species on the catalyst. Hydroxyl groups on the support surface are important for anchoring vanadium precursors, while acid sites are detrimental to catalyst performance. Silica doping of alumina support can improve catalyst stability and activity. Addition of MgO can improve dehydrogenation selectivity by reducing coke formation. The reducibility of vanadium species depends on their molecular structure. Molybdenum oxide can exist as monomers, polymers, or crystallites, depending on loading, support, and preparation conditions. Optimal molybdenum oxide activity is achieved with monolayer coverage on alumina. Hydrogen reduction of molybdenum oxide catalyst increases conversion but decreases selectivity. Ga2O3 polymorphs, particularly β-Ga2O3, have high concentration of weak Lewis acid sites for dehydrogenation activity. Coordinatively unsaturated tetrahedral Ga3+ cations are crucial for dehydrogenation activity. High concentration of Lewis acid groups in the form of Ga3+ cations is necessary for dehydrogenation activity. Zeolitic support with low medium and strong acid sites and high weak acid sites leads to most active and stable GaO3/H-ZSM-5 catalyst. Promotion with a base like potassium decreases activity, indicating acidic groups catalyze the reaction. Mesoporous GaAl mixed oxide has increased resistance to coking. Potassium reduces coke formation by poisoning Brnsted acid sites. Platinum acts as a promoter for GaOx, enhancing conversion and selectivity. Platinum assists hydrogen desorption, facilitating regeneration of gallium hydride hydroxide species. The nature of active sites in Ga-based dehydrogenation catalysts is still under debate. Molybdenum oxide can exist as monomers, polymers, or crystallites, depending on loading, support, and preparation conditions. Hydrogen reduction of catalyst increases conversion but decreases selectivity due to acid site formation. The physicochemical properties of catalysts, including chemical qualities and morphological characteristics, significantly influence their performance in dehydrogenation reactions. Alumina is the most common support, and its interaction with the active phase can profoundly impact catalyst activity and selectivity. Noble metals, particularly platinum, are preferred for their superior activation of paraffinic CH bonds and low activity for CC cleavage. The addition of alkaline metals like lithium, sodium, and potassium can poison acid sites on the support, suppressing coke formation. Zirconia is an alternative support that has been investigated, offering low surface acidity and enhanced sintering resistance. Silica requires a high surface area to stabilize Cr6+ sites. Mixed oxides prepared using layered double hydroxide precursors have also been studied for nonoxidative dehydrogenation reactions. The acidity of the support material, such as in chromia-pillared α-zirconium phosphate, can significantly affect catalytic behavior. The physicochemical properties of catalysts, including chemical qualities and morphological characteristics, significantly influence their performance in dehydrogenation reactions. The surface area-to-metal loading ratio determines the formation of different vanadium species, which affects the catalytic activity. The presence of hydroxyl groups on the support surface is crucial for anchoring vanadium precursors, while large V2O5 crystallites are inactive in dehydrogenation. The reducibility of vanadium species depends on their molecular structure, and the reduction of the catalyst by the hydrocarbon feed results in the formation of V4+ and V3+. Initially, deactivation is caused by the strong adsorption of reactants on the active sites and coke deposition. The calcination of the catalyst can remove coke but may further deactivate the catalyst due to the formation of larger V2O5 crystallites or mixed oxides. V2O5 crystallites can revert to active polymeric vanadium species under certain conditions. The addition of CO2 can have a beneficial effect on the catalyst by removing acid sites, facilitating coke gasification, and promoting hydrogen removal. The effect of CO2 depends on the catalyst support, with relatively weak basic sites on activated carbon support facilitating the reverse water gas shift reaction, while strong basic sites on Al2O3 and ZnO2 can be poisoned by CO2. Using silica to dope the alumina support can improve catalyst stability and activity. The addition of MgO can improve the performance of supported vanadium catalysts by reducing coke formation. The physicochemical properties of catalysts, including chemical qualities and morphological characteristics, significantly influence their performance in dehydrogenation reactions. The nature of the support is crucial as it not only determines the mechanical properties of the catalyst but also affects the interaction between the carrier and the active phase, which can profoundly impact catalyst activity and selectivity. For instance, alumina is the most common support, and the method of producing chromia-alumina catalysts can vary, affecting the catalyst's performance. The choice of support can also influence the catalytic activity, with different supports leading to varying orders of activity based on conversion and yield. Zirconia, as an alternative support, has been investigated for its low surface acidity and enhanced sintering resistance. Silica requires a high surface area to stabilize Cr6+ sites, and mixed oxides prepared using layered double hydroxide precursors have been studied for their catalytic properties in dehydrogenation reactions. The acidity of the support, as seen in chromia-pillared α-zirconium phosphate materials, can also influence catalytic behavior, with strong acid sites affecting cracking reactions and medium strength acid sites impacting dehydrogenation reactions. Support modification strategies can be employed to optimize the properties of catalysts for enhanced catalytic efficiency and selectivity. For example, doping alumina-based dehydrogenation catalysts with alkali ions can effectively poison undesirable acid sites, improving selectivity. Using zirconia as a support can prevent the formation of mixed oxides and offer higher thermal stability and surface area. Silica, with its high surface area, can stabilize Cr6+ sites, while mixed oxides prepared using layered double hydroxide precursors can provide improved coking resistance and thermal stability against sintering. Understanding the role of acidity in catalytic behavior can also guide the modification of supports to favor dehydrogenation reactions over cracking reactions. The physicochemical properties of catalysts, including chemical qualities and morphological characteristics, significantly influence their performance in dehydrogenation reactions. For instance, the nature of the support material, such as alumina, zirconia, or silica, can affect the dispersion and stability of the active phase, thereby impacting the catalytic activity and selectivity.

The stability and tolerance to carbon deposits of Zr-Al-Beta promoted by alkali-metal ions were demonstrated. The modification of alkali-metal ions on both Lewis acid sites and Brnsted acid sites in Zr-Al-Beta was evidenced by XPS and FT-IR spectroscopy. The untreated materials displayed poor product selectivity and high coke deposit in the Meerwein-Ponndorf-Verley reduction of furfural and isopropanol; however, the treatment of alkali-metal ions promoted their catalytic performance with improved recalcitrance to deactivation and coking significantly. The type of alkali-metal ions and the concentration of alkaline solution influenced the catalytic performance, which were found to correlate to the acidity and textual properties. The optimum reaction result (97.3% yield of furfuryl alcohol at 99.6% conversion of furfural) can be obtained on 0.025 M-Na+-Zr-Al-Beta with high tolerance to the furfural concentration. Support modification strategies can be employed to optimize these properties for enhanced catalytic efficiency and selectivity by tuning and normalizing the various acidic sites of zeolites.

The exploitation of an efficient PDH catalyst based on HZSM-5 zeolite to achieve both high selectivity and stability is still a challenge. In zeolite supported catalysts, zeolite provides a special environment for catalytic reactions, including channel confinement effects, acidic sites, and electron transfer. Acidic sites in zeolites play a key role in determining the catalytic performance of zeolite catalysts in alkane conversion.

This in turn affected the distribution of different surface V species.\nGu et al. reported that P modification could greatly influence the structure and activity of VOx/Al2O3 catalysts.142 More specifically, P modification decreased the degree of VOx polymerization, which had positive implications on the catalyst stability, as evidenced by the retention of high activity (ca. 45% propane conversion) after an 8 h DDH reaction in all P-modified catalysts.\nSubsequent studies on a VOx/Al2O3 catalysts (with 12 wt% V loading) modified with Mg revealed the anti-coking capability and improved catalytic performance evident through propene yields of 1927% over a 6 h DDH reaction.143 It was found that the dispersing action of Mg modification to V2O5 crystallites and an increase in active V3+ species reduced the amount and polymerization of coke deposits.\nThe concentration of dopant atoms, and the temperature of reduction were other contributing factors that affected the catalytic behaviour for ZrO2-based catalysts.3 Numerous binary YZrOx and LaZrOx-based catalysts displayed high activity, selectivity and stability as well as comparable performance to KCrOx/Al2O3 catalysts over the course of 60 DDH cycles at 550 C, 600 C and 625 C under industrially relevant conditions. The experimental parameters had a beneficial effect on the concentration of Zrcus4+ ions, and the concentration of surface lattice oxygen, which in tandem play an active role in propane activation.\nThe specific requirements of catalyst design for each sub-reaction are discussed and we identify that, regardless of the method of dehydrogenation, the balance of acid and base sites on the catalyst surface is of paramount importance.\nThe development of an active, selective and stable catalyst is essential for dehydrogenation to be considered as a viable process in the near- and long-term future.\nThe exact composition of the HGM is likely to include copper oxide and additional promotors such as MnO2, supported on α-Al2O3.\nThe role of Cu in the catalyst was to dilute the Pt species and promote desorption of propene, thereby enhancing selectivity.\nThe h-BN nanosheets provided abundant stacking fault edges terminated with BO defects that are associated with unpaired electrons, which strongly interact with active metal species, helping to strengthen the interaction between the metal and support.\nThe preparation of new catalysts with simultaneously enhanced activity, selectivity and stability is the ultimate goal.\nThe modification of Al2O3 with metal oxides, such as TiO2 has been undertaken with some promising results.\nThe enhanced performance was ascribed to electron transfer and acid site modulation effects resulting in changes to the adsorption properties of Pt.\nThe enhanced performance and stability was attributed to ultra-small, uniformly dispersed particles, ranging in size from 1.0 to 1.4 nm, consistent with previous studies that observed structure-sensitivity.\nThe role of the subsurface was to facilitate the activation of propane on the surface.\nThe role of the support is simply to maximise the active Cr6+ surface area, rather than add any chemical functionality, hence this is the reason why chemically-unreactive supports such as SiO2 and activated carbon yield the most active CrOX catalysts.\nThe most significant barrier to commercial application is the poor on-stream stability exhibited by all chromium-based catalysts.\nThe stability was improved in the presence of CO2 (compared to DDH); ca. 74% of the original activity was retained after 10 h on-stream, which is relatively good compared to Ga- and Cr-based catalysts.\nThe origin of stability was linked to the low rate of coking associated with the spinel catalyst.\nThe role of CO2 in ODH-CO2 is to assist the above equilibrium by removing H2via the RWGS reaction.\nThe origin of this induction period was found to be reduction of In2O3 to In0 nanoclusters, which suggests the active structure is more of a supported nanoparticle type catalyst than a mixed-metal oxide.\nThe basicity of the In/ZrO2 system was suggested to promote the RWGS reaction, which in turn boosted the ODH-CO2 activity.\nThe initial STY of this catalyst was 10.7 molC3H6 kgcat1 h1 (Table 13, entry 4), which is amongst the most active reported to date, but requires significant improvements to its on-stream stability.\nDespite the low selectivity, the FeCeO2 catalysts exhibited a comparable STY to supported In2O3 (Table 13) and some Ga2O3 catalysts (Table 12).\nThe major side-reactions observed were dry reforming and cracking.\nThe cationanion double hydrolysis approach (CADH), used for the synthesis of mesoporous Al2O3 with high surface area and a pure γ-Al2O3 phase, was undertaken with the crystallisation temperature varied between 25120 C.141 It was found that the crystallisation temperature of the support directly influenced the catalytic performance of the VOx/Al2O3 catalysts, which was a consequence of the increase in Lewis acid sites with increasing crystallization temperatures up to 100 C. This in turn affected the distribution of different surface V species.\nThe authors concluded that the relative proportions of V3+, V4+ and V5+ species present on the catalyst surface were affected by V loading and at the optimal loading of 12 wt%, a high concentration of isolated V3+ species was detected.\nGu et al. reported that P modification could greatly influence the structure and activity of VOx/Al2O3 catalysts.142 More specifically, P modification decreased the degree of VOx polymerization, which had positive implications on the catalyst stability, as evidenced by the retention of high activity (ca. 45% propane conversion) after an 8 h DDH reaction in all P-modified catalysts.\nThe combined and synergistic effect of the surface acidity modifications, their influence on the active V3+ species, and weakened metalsupport interactions facilitated desorption of propene and inhibited the deep dehydrogenation that leads to coke precursors.\nSubsequent studies on a VOx/Al2O3 catalysts (with 12 wt% V loading) modified with Mg revealed the anti-coking capability and improved catalytic performance evident through propene yields of 1927% over a 6 h DDH reaction.143 It was found that the dispersing action of Mg modification to V2O5 crystallites and an increase in active V3+ species reduced the amount and polymerization of coke deposits.\nThe highest STY achieved was 7.8 molC3H6 kg1cat h1 (Table 6, entry 7).\nThe moderate vanadium doping level was conducive to highly dispersed vanadium species in the form of isolated and low-polymerized VOx species.\nHighly dispersed and stable VOx species, and an absence of V2O5 crystallites, were conducive to high catalytic activity and stability.\nThe STY was 6.2 molC3H6 kg1cat h1 (Table 6, entry 5), due to the low GHSV so while the catalyst achieved high selectivity at reasonable propane conversion, it was not as intrinsically active as other supported VOx catalysts.\nThe most active catalyst, V/Si-beta (having 3 wt% V loading) displayed an initial propene yield of 33.4% and retained activity over multiple dehydrogenationregeneration cycles.\nThe STY was 4.4 molC3H6 kg1cat h1 (Table 6, entry 6), which is 56 times less active than the most active VOx catalysts reported to date, suggesting that Si-beta does not facilitate a high concentration of active V sites.\nIt was found that VOx/ZrO2 is approximately five times more active than VOx/Al2O3 and pure ZrO2, exhibiting a STY of 9.2 molC3H6 kg1cat h1 (Table 6, entry 2).\nThe authors proposed that the enhanced performance of VOx/ZrO2 results from the facile reduction of VO, VOV and VOZr bonds, thus producing higher proportions of the active V3+ species.\nFor the most active catalyst, with 8 wt% V loading, the initial yield of propene increased from 24% at 550 C to 28% at 575 C with a negligible (<1%) increase at 600 C.\nThis corresponded to a STY of 24 molC3H6 kg1cat h1 (Table 6, entry 3), which is one of the most active VOx-based catalysts reported.\nThe STY of ZrO2 without VOx is actually much higher than in the current work.\nThe most active V species has been identified, the relative proportion and stability of this surface V species can be tuned by varying the preparation method.\nThe role of the other V species on the DDH reaction remains unclear so further work to elucidate this could yield more active and stable DDH catalysts.\nThe range in performance of V-based catalysts varies quite significantly, with the most active catalysts exhibiting STYs that are around 34 time less active than the most active Pt catalysts.\nThe specific requirements of catalyst design for each sub-reaction are discussed and we identify that, regardless of the method of dehydrogenation, the balance of acid and base sites on the catalyst surface is of paramount importance.\nThe development of an active, selective and stable catalyst is essential for dehydrogenation to be considered as a viable process in the near- and long-term future.\nIn the case of SC and coal-based MTO, this is unavoidable due to the nature of the feedstock. However, natural gas and propane can be produced from biomass. In these cases, the feedstock is renewable and so these processes are potentially much more sustainable than when using fossil fuels.\nThe majority of analyses focus on well-established processes, where more information and data are available, but no such analyses were found for oxidative dehydrogenation.\nThe thermodynamic tendency to form undesirable by-products means that such reactions must be carefully kinetically controlled. Careful catalyst design can inhibit and even switch-off some of these side-reactions, as will be discussed in the subsequent sections.\nThe exact composition of the HGM is likely to include copper oxide and additional promotors such as MnO2, supported on α-Al2O3.\nThe role of Cu in the catalyst was to dilute the Pt species and promote desorption of propene, thereby enhancing selectivity.\nThe role of the subsurface was to facilitate the activation of propane on the surface.\nThe preparation strategy could greatly influence the structure of Ga/SiO2 catalysts.\nThe preparation of GaRh supported catalytically active liquid metal solutions.\nThe GaPt alloy melts at temperatures between 270 C and 330 C.\nThe activity is dependent on the bond strength of the VOsupport bond.\nThe metalsupport (VOsupport) interactions affect the resultant catalyst performance.\nThe catalyst deactivated quickly due to carbon deposition, but retained its initial activity over the course of ten successive dehydrogenationregeneration cycles.\nThe first study of Cr2O3-based catalysts for ODH-CO2 was reported by Takahara et al. in 1996 using Cr2O3 supported on SiO2, activated carbon (AC) or Al2O3.\nIt was found that over 5 wt% Cr2O3/SiO2, the propene yield increased from 6.5% to 9.1% when CO2 was co-fed instead of Ar.\nIn contrast, the alumina supported catalyst was inhibited by the addition of CO2, as shown by the drop in propene yield from 12.7% to 3.3%.\nThe 5 wt% Cr2O3/AC material was unaffected by CO2 addition.\nThe Cr2O3/SiO2 catalyst deactivated rapidly, retaining just 66% of its original activity after 4 h on-stream.\nThe stability was noted to the same with or without CO2 in the reactant feed.\nNot only did this study establish Cr2O3 as an active ODH-CO2 catalyst, it also captured one of the recurring themes in catalyst design for ODH-CO2: some catalysts are inhibited by the addition of CO2 while others perform much better.\nRelative to many other metal oxides, Cr2O3 is considered to be one of the most promising catalysts for ODH-CO2.\nTakehira et al. compared the catalytic performance of several d block and p block oxides (namely Cr, Ga, Ni, V, Fe, Mn and Co) supported on MCM-41, at 550 C with a CO2:C3H8 molar ratio of 5.6.\nAfter 30 min on-stream, the propene yield of the Cr-based catalyst was 15% whereas for the Ga-based counterpart it was 5%.\nThe remaining catalysts all exhibited lower propene yields (in the 14% range).\nHowever, as the catalysts were not characterised, it is unclear if the dispersion of these catalysts was comparable, and therefore if the results reflect the true intrinsic activity of each metal.\nIt was also noted that the order of reactivity resembled the trends observed by Nakagawa et al. for diamond-supported metal catalysts in the DDH reaction.\nThis suggests that there are commonalities in catalyst design between DDH and ODH-CO2 which most likely relate to the interaction of the alkane with the catalyst.\nContrary to this, Zhang et al. compared ZrO2, SBA-15 and γ-Al2O3 as supports for Cr2O3 in the DDH, ODH-CO2 and ODH-O2 reactions.\nThey found that the highest propene yield was observed with different catalyst systems under different dehydrogenation reactions, i.e., the activity trends in DDH did not translate to ODH-CO2 catalysts.\nSpecifically, Cr2O3/ZrO2 catalyst was the most active for the DDH reaction, while the highest yield of propene for the ODH-CO2 and ODH-O2 reactions was observed over Cr2O3/SBA-15 (Table 11, entry 7).\nAcross all the catalysts however, the highest propene yields were generally observed in the DDH reaction, ascribed to the production of carbon oxides in the ODH-O2 and ODH-CO2 reactions.\nHowever, it was reported that Cr2O3/ZrO2 was more stable on-stream in ODH-CO2 than in the DDH reaction.\nWu et al. also observed increased stability of Cr2O3/ZrO2 in the presence of CO2 (Table 11, entry 4).\nThey reported that the CO formation rate was higher than the CO2 consumption rate and the excess CO was suggested to originate from the Boudouard reaction (CO2 + C  2CO); this could explain the increased stability of this catalyst.\nIt is possible that some dry reforming of propane also took place, which would produce H2 and CO.\nZhao et al. recently reported the facile preparation of Cr supported in mesoporous ZrO2 using an evaporation-induced self-assembly method (Table 11, entry 6).\nThe authors suggested that propene could react with carbon dioxide to form carbon monoxide, methane and water.\nOther studies have reported a stronger inhibition effect for Cr2O3/ZrO2 catalysts in the presence of CO2.\nFor instance, Ferreira et al. studied the adsorption properties of CO2 and concluded that it binds strongly to active Cr2O3 sites, lowering the activity and stability of the catalyst,\nwhereas Xie et al. suggested that coke formation could originate from CO2 hydrogenation over Cr2+ species.\nThese conflicting reports may relate to the structural polymorph of ZrO2 present in the catalyst support; this factor is often overlooked, but recent studies from Kondratenko et al. revealed that nanocrystalline ZrO2 is an active DDH catalyst in its own right151,152 under similar reaction conditions.\nThe ZrO2 crystal phase and crystallite size were strongly correlated to the catalyst activity: smaller crystallites were more active but amorphous ZrO2 had very low intrinsic activity.\nMoreover, monoclinic ZrO2 was more active than tetragonal ZrO2.\nCr2O3-catalysed ODH-CO2 has been examined over different polymorphs of SiO2,254256 including various structured porous oxides, including SBA-1,84 SBA-15,250,257 MCM-41,91 amorphous silica84 and mesoporous silica spheres.258\nNotably, Michorczyk et al. reported a detailed comparison of different silica supports, coupled with an in-depth characterisation study.84\nIt was shown that in each case, the same active Cr species was formed, namely Cr6+, but higher surface area silicas (e.g., SBA-1 and SBA-15) were able to facilitate a higher number of such sites.\nA clear correlation was found between the rate of propene formation and the wt% of Cr6+, as determined using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS).\nIn DDH, while Cr6+ is considered active, under reaction conditions Cr3+ is rapidly formed and considered the principle active species.93,94\nThe selectivity to propene was similar across the different silica supports (8893%), with the observed differences being attributable to differences in propane conversion rather than catalytic properties.\nThese Cr2O3/SiO2 catalysts were highly active at 550 C and the most active catalyst (Cr2O3/SBA-1) achieved a STY of 7.9 molC3H6 kgcat1 h1, as shown in Table 11, entry 12.\nIt should be noted that the experiments were carried out with a CO2:C3H8 ratio of 5, which as discussed above, has been shown to enable a higher equilibrium yield of propene.\nTherefore, in studies where high conversions are generally targeted and carbon dioxide is in excess of propane, higher propene yields are reported.\nTakehira et al. carried out X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) on CrOx/MCM-41, confirming that the reduction of Cr6+ occurs during the reaction.91\nSpecifically, they identified Cr6+O4 tetrahedra as the active species.\nThese Cr3+O6 octahedra were formed after reduction, which were considered to be less active.\nIt was shown that CO2 could re-oxidise the Cr, which suggests that the redox cycle between Cr6+ and Cr3+ is an important process during the reaction.\nYi et al. discriminated between isolated Cr6+ and polymeric Cr6+, finding that after reduction, isolated Cr3+ was more active than polymeric Cr3+. This underlines the importance of Cr dispersion in these catalysts.259\nIn a more detailed examination of Cr2O3/SBA-1, the relationship between the physicochemical properties of the catalyst and the observed activity were explored.85\nMichorczyk et al. found a strong positive correlation between the initial propene yield and the reducibility of the catalyst, specifically the H2 consumption.\nIn situ UV-vis measurements revealed that Cr6+ is rapidly reduced to Cr3+ or Cr2+ in the presence of C3H8 under reaction conditions.\nThe reaction proceeds through a Mars-Van Krevelen mechanism, via the Cr2+/3+ redox couple.\nRapid deactivation, typical of Cr2O3 catalysts, was observed, although the majority of the initial activity could be recovered after regeneration in air.\nThe remainder was ascribed to pore collapse and/or the formation of inactive Cr sites, although the loss of surface Cr sites through agglomeration was not considered.\nDespite early reports that activated carbon (AC) was not a suitable support for Cr2O3, subsequent studies have shown that above 550 C, the activity of Cr2O3/AC in the presence of CO2 was higher than in the DDH reaction.260\nThe enhancement in propane conversion due to the presence of CO2 increased at higher temperatures (i.e., above 600 C), although this was chiefly due to propane dry reforming proceeding, generating CO and H2 rather than propene.\nWhile this Cr2O3/AC exhibited the highest STY of propene out of all CrOx-based catalysts (21 molC3H6 kgcat1 h1, Table 11, entry 9), it rapidly deactivated on-stream and due to the support being carbonaceous, cannot be regenerated using air.\nThis severely limits the utility of this catalyst.\nZeolites have also been considered as catalyst supports for Cr2O3.\nZhang et al. prepared CrOx/Na-ZSM-5 via incipient wetness.261\nAlthough the initial conversion and selectivity was high (48% and 86%, respectively) (Table 11, entry 5), the catalysts deactivated rapidly and the reaction conditions were such that the STY was only 2.5 molC3H6 kgcat1 h1 at 550 C with a CO2:C3H8 ratio of 2.\nZhu et al. investigated a range of MFI supports, including silicalite-1 and H[B]MFI.262\nCrOx/H[B]MFI was found to be the most active catalyst, giving a STY of 4.7 molC3H6 kgcat1 h1 at 600 C with a CO2:C3H8 of 1 (Table 11, entry 15).\nAlthough the as-prepared catalyst exhibited typically poor stability for Cr catalysts, steam treating the catalyst resulted in a marked improvement.\nAfter 60 h on-stream, the as-prepared catalyst retained only 25% of its initial conversion, while the steam treated catalyst retained ca. 74%.\nThe authors ascribed the effect to stabilised Cr3+ formed in the steam treatment.\nPresumably the reduction of Cr6+ during the reaction results in an inactive or less active Cr3+ species.\nIt should also be noted that the as-prepared catalyst was initially almost twice as active as the steam treated catalyst, which leaves the possibility that at higher conversions, increased coke formation may have occurred which would exaggerate the deactivation compared to the steam treated catalyst.\nIdeally such stability comparisons would be made at isoconversion, however this discovery is one of only a few that shows improved stability on-stream.\nRecently, Michorczyk et al. prepared a Cr-β-zeolite and investigated the effect of dealumination, which clearly elucidated the effect of acidity on the catalytic performance.263\nIt was reported that the dealuminated catalyst, Cr-SiBeta, exhibited significantly higher propene yields (up to 27%), compared to the Al-containing catalyst, Cr-AlBeta (2%).\nThe presence of acid sites in the Cr-AlBeta catalyst resulted in cracking pathways that led to increased production of methane and ethene.\nMoreover, the CrAlbeta catalyst performed less well in the presence of CO2 than in the DDH reaction.\nThis was explained by the strong adsorption of CO2 on the catalyst, similar to the inhibition observed over Cr2O3/Al2O3 catalysts.\nThe stability of the dealuminated catalyst was also improved compared with CrAlbeta, but significant loss in activity was observed over the 4 h reaction.\nIn considering the redox properties of the catalysts in this work, and their previous investigations, the authors also identified a strong correlation between the H2 consumption from H2-TPR studies and the reported propene yield, as shown in Fig. 10.\nWhile the majority of investigations on ODH-CO2 Cr2O3 catalysts have focused on support modifications, the addition of a promotor has also been shown to be beneficial.\nYun et al. demonstrated that the addition of 0.5 wt% Ni to a 10 wt% CrOx/SBA-15 catalyst increased the propane and CO2 conversion, as well as the on-stream stability.264\nAfter 1 h on-stream, the Ni-promoted catalyst was 50% more active and the conversion and selectivity was almost maintained over 12 h on-stream.\nIn contrast, the less active unpromoted catalyst retained only half of the initial activity over the same time period.\nUsing three-stage H2-TPR experiments (where the catalyst is reduced twice under H2 and then re-oxidised in CO2 before the final H2-TPR program), the authors showed that the addition of Ni facilitated the re-oxidation of Cr during the reaction.\nThis is consistent with previously reported mechanisms of deactivation over Cr-based catalysts, although coking is also often reported to cause deactivation.\nInterestingly, the promoted catalyst was marginally more prone to coking.\nThis strongly suggests that overreduction of active Cr sites is the key deactivation mechanism over these catalysts.\nThere is a lot of potential to develop promoted Cr catalysts that could enhance the redox activity of the catalyst; precious metals including Pd and Pt are often supported on reducible supports for this purpose.265\nCrucially, it was found that above 0.5 wt% Ni, propane reforming was prevalent, which underlines the importance of appropriate loadings of promotors.\nO'Brien et al. investigated the effect of a Ru promoter to a 10 wt% CrOx/SiO2 catalyst.\nConsistent with Yun et al. it was shown that the propene formation rate was increased.\nA 1 wt% Ru loading was optimal and doubled the activity.\nInterestingly, this is approximately the same molar ratio reported as the optimum by Yun et al. for Ni-promoted CrOx/SBA-15 (Table 11, entry 14).\nAnother similarity was the propensity of reforming to dominate at high loadings (>1 wt%).\nThe enhanced stability seen in Ni-promoted Cr catalysts was not observed in this work and the activity could not be fully recovered after regeneration.\nConsequently, aggregation of Cr species was suggested as an additional deactivation mechanism in addition to coke formation and overreduction of Cr.\nRather than aid Cr re-oxidation in a one-step oxidative dehydrogenation, the authors concluded that the Ru promotes the RWGS reaction, which removes H2 and increases the equilibrium conversion of propane.\nHowever, the results of three-stage H2-TPR reactions indicated that Cr can be more easily oxidised in the presence of Ru, which suggests that Ru can participate in a similar role as Ni-promoted Cr catalysts.\nOverall supported chromium oxide catalysts represent one of the most active classes of ODH-CO2 catalysts, with STY values in the range of 222 molC3H6 kgcat1 h1.\nThe role of the support is simply to maximise the active Cr6+ surface area, rather than add any chemical functionality, hence this is the reason why chemically-unreactive supports such as SiO2 and activated carbon yield the most active CrOX catalysts.\nThe most significant barrier to commercial application is the poor on-stream stability exhibited by all chromium-based catalysts.\nWhile incremental improvements in the activity of Cr catalysts have been reported since their initial discovery, significant advances in catalyst stability have been relatively few.\nThe first study of Cr2O3-based catalysts for ODH-CO2 was reported by Takahara et al. in 1996 using Cr2O3 supported on SiO2, activated carbon (AC) or Al2O3.\nThe 5 wt% Cr2O3/SiO2 catalyst deactivated rapidly, retaining just 66% of its original activity after 4 h on-stream.\nThe stability was noted to the same with or without CO2 in the reactant feed.\nNot only did this study establish Cr2O3 as an active ODH-CO2 catalyst, it also captured one of the recurring themes in catalyst design for ODH-CO2: some catalysts are inhibited by the addition of CO2 while others perform much better.\nThe correct balance of acidic and basic sites is a key consideration in catalyst design.\nEqually, the ratio of carbon dioxide to propane is important to take in account, as it has kinetic and thermodynamic implications.\nThermodynamically, higher CO2:C3H8 ratios limit coke forming side-reactions.\nThe addition of CO2 in the dehydrogenation reaction has multiple effects: As discussed in Section 2, it facilitates the RWGS reaction which removes H2 from the system and shifts the thermodynamic equilibrium limit to favour propene production.\nAdditionally, CO2 can dissociate on the surface of a catalyst and provide O species to dehydrogenate propane directly.\nFinally, it can react with coke via the reverse-Boudouard reaction to produce CO, which can potentially extend the lifetime of the catalyst.\nThe role of the support is simply to maximise the active Cr6+ surface area, rather than add any chemical functionality, hence this is the reason why chemically-unreactive supports such as SiO2 and activated carbon yield the most active CrOX catalysts.\nThe most significant barrier to commercial application is the poor on-stream stability exhibited by all chromium-based catalysts.\nWhile incremental improvements in the activity of Cr catalysts have been reported since their initial discovery, significant advances in catalyst stability have been relatively few.\nThe addition of Al2O3 to ODH-CO2 catalysts is typically not beneficial.\nAlthough the addition of Al2O3 to ODH-CO2 catalysts is typically not beneficial, Chen et al. investigated spinel-type Ga2O3Al2O3 mixed oxides and showed that they can function as stable catalysts.\nThe origin of stability was linked to the low rate of coking associated with the spinel catalyst.\nUsing NH3-TPD analysis, the authors concluded that weak Lewis acid sites were conducive to high activity.\nThese acidbase properties most likely contribute to the enhanced stability as well; it is known that stronger acid sites promote oligomerisation pathways that produce coke.\nThe increased performance of Ga2O3/ZSM-48 was attributed to the abundance of weak and medium strength acid sites.\nThe low activity of Ga2O3/MgO and Ga2O3/SiO2 was ascribed to the absence of medium and strong acid sites.\nIn the Ga2O3/TiO2 catalyst, a significant proportion of the Ga (45%) was reduced.\nThis catalyst exhibited the highest propane conversion, but with a propene selectivity of 73% it did not result in the highest propene yield.\nThe origin of this induction period was found to be reduction of In2O3 to In0 nanoclusters, which suggests the active structure is more of a supported nanoparticle type catalyst than a mixed-metal oxide.\nThe basicity of the In/ZrO2 system was suggested to promote the RWGS reaction, which in turn boosted the ODH-CO2 activity.\nIt was found that 10 mol% Fe in CeO2 exhibited the highest propene yield.\nThe major side-reactions observed were dry reforming and cracking.\nThey showed that reforming pathways were more prevalent at higher CO2:C3H8 ratios, such as 2.5:1 and 5:1.\nDespite the low selectivity, the FeCeO2 catalysts exhibited a comparable STY to supported In2O3 and some Ga2O3 catalysts.\nThe number of studies on supported nanoparticle catalysts for ODH-CO2 are relatively few and those available indicate that this field of research has great potential.\nThe major challenge is in understanding and inhibiting side-reactions such as reforming, which are known to proceed over this class of catalyst, unlike in Cr- and Ga-based catalysts.\nCareful consideration of the nanostructure and composition has shown that the selectivity can be readily tuned to favour different pathways, and further investigation in this area may well be able to harness the high activity of supported nanoparticles as well as favour dehydrogenation pathways.\nDespite dozens of reports over several decades on Cr- and Ga- based catalysts, the improvements in catalyst performance have been incremental.\nThe knowledge gained from these studies on the importance of reducibility and the balance of acid and base sites should be applied to supported NP catalysts, which are a promising and somewhat neglected category of ODH-CO2 catalyst.\nThe specific requirements of catalyst design for each sub-reaction are discussed and we identify that, regardless of the method of dehydrogenation, the balance of acid and base sites on the catalyst surface is of paramount importance.\nThe development of an active, selective and stable catalyst is essential for dehydrogenation to be considered as a viable process in the near- and long-term future.\nIn the case of SC and coal-based MTO, this is unavoidable due to the nature of the feedstock. However, natural gas and propane can be produced from biomass.\nThe increased interest in direct propane dehydrogenation has been enhanced by the fall in propane price, which is the direct result of the discovery of vast shale gas reserves in North America.\nThe production of renewable green propane (also called bio-propane and bioLPG) is an emerging sector which is already being operated on a large scale.\nWith increasing pressure to source chemical feedstocks sustainably, we can expect that new interest will focus on renewable and green routes to the key platform chemicals currently required by modern society, and that green propane will play an important role in this.\nThe majority (86%) of filed patents are for DDH catalysts, followed by ODH-O2 (12%) and finally ODH-CO2 (2.4%).\nThe exact composition of the HGM is likely to include copper oxide and additional promotors such as MnO2, supported on α-Al2O3.\nThe importance of Al speciation in improving catalyst performance and stability was investigated by Shi et al.\nThe modification of Al2O3 with metal oxides, such as TiO2 has been undertaken with some promising results.\nThe role of Cu in the catalyst was to dilute the Pt species and promote desorption of propene, thereby enhancing selectivity.\nThe role of the subsurface was to facilitate the activation of propane on the surface.\nThe irreversible initial deactivation in the consecutive DDH cycles was attributed to either: (i) structural changes of active species (such as agglomeration), or (ii) collapse of pore structure.\nThe positive effect was attributed to the promoters ability to block the sites responsible for coke formation and negligible contribution to undesirable secondary reactions by the additional acid sites generated by the P-based modifier.\nThe authors attributed this enhanced performance to a high dispersion of Cr species, moderate acidity and strong metalsupport interactions in the CrOx/H-ZSM-5(260) catalyst.\nThe authors attributed high Ga/Al ratios (>0.5) with the formation of additional GaxOy clusters which negatively affected the dehydrogenation rate and thus catalytic performance.\nThe activity is dependent on the bond strength of the VOsupport bond. Therefore, it is expected that catalyst performance is affected when different supports, such as SiO2, Al2O3 and ZrO2 are utilised.", "English": "The physicochemical properties of catalysts, including chemical qualities and morphological characteristics, significantly influence their performance in dehydrogenation reactions. The crystallization temperature of the support directly affects the catalytic performance of VOx/Al2O3 catalysts by increasing Lewis acid sites and influencing the distribution of different surface V species. P modification can decrease the degree of VOx polymerization, enhancing catalyst stability and activity. Mg modification can improve catalytic performance and anti-coking capability by dispersing V2O5 crystallites and increasing active V3+ species. Gelation and calcination temperatures also impact the catalytic performance of VOx/SiO2 catalysts in terms of propane conversion, propene selectivity, and yield of propene. Dealuminated beta zeolites (Si-beta) are promising catalyst supports due to their high surface area and thermal stability, and the initial propane conversion linearly increases with the amount of acid sites. VOx/ZrO2 is more active than VOx/Al2O3 and pure ZrO2 due to the facile reduction of VO, VOV, and VOZr bonds, producing higher proportions of the active V3+ species. The balance of acid and base sites on the catalyst surface is crucial for all dehydrogenation methods. The development of an active, selective, and stable catalyst is essential for dehydrogenation to be considered a viable process in the future. Support modification strategies can optimize these properties for enhanced catalytic efficiency and selectivity. Using supports with ordered mesoporosity and moderate surface acidity can aid mass transfer and avoid undesirable secondary reactions. Promoting elements can cause beneficial geometric and electronic effects on both the supports and active species. However, environmental and safety concerns exist in the preparation, usage, and disposal of certain catalysts due to their toxicity. Ga catalysts, while less active than Pt and Cr catalysts, have the advantage of being benign and inexpensive. The nature of the support is essential for vanadium-based catalysts, as the metalsupport interactions affect the resultant catalyst performance. The activity is dependent on the bond strength of the VOsupport bond, and catalyst performance is affected by different supports.", "Chinese": "所有答案结果中的汇总中文答案 1", "Doi": "10.1039/D1GC03700E"},

The equilibrium conversion of alkanes increases with temperature, but alkene selectivity decreases due to an increased tendency toward dehydrocyclization/aromatisation, thermal cracking, and coke formation. The extent of PtSn interactions depends on the impregnation sequence of Pt and Sn precursors on the support material. The framework of microporous zeolites exerts dispersive forces on reactant molecules, which depend on the shape, channel, and cavity of the framework. The nature and density of active sites also influence the framework dispersion forces. Recent reports have shown that the strong electrostatic field between protons or exchanged metal ions and basic oxygen species can enhance and/or induce polarization of bonds in hydrocarbon adsorbates. This polarization effect can be viewed as an intermediate condition to hydride abstraction, an important elementary step in CH activation. The polarizing effect increases with increasing charge magnitude and ionic radius of the alkane polarizing cations. The choice of cations should be such that they exhibit no catalytic effects on the target alkene products at the reaction condition. It may be beneficial to create a CH polarization effect on the zeolite framework by appropriate modification of framework atoms. Active sites are usually created on the zeolite frameworks. The active sites of the bimolecular pathway are formed in situ and are made up of an alkyl carbenium ion ionically held to the zeolite framework oxygen ion. The active sites of the unimolecular pathway are the charge balancing protons of the zeolite framework. A proton and a carbenium ion are electrophilic or Lewis acid species, and the two pathways essentially involve electrophilic CH activation. The exchanged metal ions in zeolites are held ionically by one or more basic oxygen atoms. Different species have been suggested, depending on the density of the cation exchange site of the zeolite and the method of introduction of the metals. High alkene selectivities are obtained on the H-ZSM-5 when exchangeable protons are rigorously replaced by Zn and Ga. The CH activation on the OZn2+O site can be described by a Lewis base-assisted deprotonation mechanism, accompanied by conversion of the Lewis base site to a conjugate Bronsted acid site. The OGa+ site, however, activates the CH bond via oxidative addition without a protonic site intermediate. A protonic site intermediate increases the tendency of side reactions on the Zn-exchanged H-ZSM-5 relative to the Ga counterpart. The elementary steps of CH activation on OGa+ reveal that a redox cycle at the metal center is required for catalytic CH activation via the oxidative addition mechanism. However, under alkane dehydrogenation reaction conditions, the OZn2+O sites can undergo a reversible Zn2+/Zn redox process, increasing the availability of undesired protonic site intermediates. Zn-exchanged H-ZSM-5 prepared by conventional ion-exchange methods contain a significant percentage of unexchanged proton sites, leading to lower alkene selectivity of the catalyst. Another strategy to enhance alkene selectivity is by controlling the strength of the proton sites. The acidity of the sites depends on the nature of the trivalent cation of the zeolite framework. Proton sites in borosilicate zeolites are weaker than those of aluminosilicate, and thus higher alkene selectivity is expected for alkane dehydrogenation over Zn/H[B]-ZSM-5 compared to Zn/H[Al]-ZSM-5. However, Zn/H[B]-ZSM-5 shows no activity for propane dehydrogenation. The desired weaker acidity of the proton sites of Zn/H[B]-ZSM-5 requires weaker basicity of the oxygen atoms in the zeolite framework. This reduced basicity of the oxygen atoms is not sufficiently polarizing to complement the exchanged Zn2+ in CH bond cleavage. Elimination of the proton sites of zeolites is critical for obtaining a high alkene selectivity and stability in dehydrogenation catalysts. Pt is the most versatile noble metal catalyst for alkane reactions, often justified by its higher activity, stability, and selectivity for these reactions compared to less expensive alternative transition metals. However, rapid catalyst deactivation due to coke formation remains a challenge even when using a Pt-based catalyst for dehydrogenation of light alkanes. The presence of acid (Bronsted and Lewis) sites on the supports promotes readsorption, oligomerization, and aromatization of alkenes. Promotion of Pt with metals, such as Sn, Ga, Zn, Re, etc., improves catalyst stability, but also leads to faster deactivation rates than Pt/Na[Fe]-ZSM-5. The role of potassium in commercial Cr and Pt-based dehydrogenation catalysts is to minimize the undesired influence of protonic sites on alkene selectivity. The nature and role of surface oxygen species become more evident. The electronic promotion effect of Sn is in line with the oxidative addition CH activation mechanism. However, the Lewis base-assisted deprotonation mechanism could also explain the proposed CH activation on Cr-based catalysts. A recent report suggests that a porous copper-aluminum framework material (stabilized by metal oxide) has better performance (activity/selectivity/stability) for propane dehydrogenation than a PtSn/Al2O3. The Lewis base-assisted deprotonation mechanism may be invoked here, and the redox property of the metal center is likely to play a role in achieving propane dehydrogenation at 350 C. This should constitute the future research direction for non-oxidative dehydrogenation of lower alkanes.", "Chinese": "催化剂的物理化学性质，包括化学品质（如酸强度和稳定性）和形态特征，对脱氢反应的性能有重大影响。随着温度的升高，烷烃的平衡转化率增加，但由于脱氢环化/芳构化、热裂解和焦炭形成的倾向增加，烯烃的选择性降低。PtSn相互作用的程度取决于Pt和Sn前体在支撑材料上的浸渍顺序。微孔沸石框架对反应物分子施加的分散力取决于框架的形状、通道和腔体。活性位点的性质和密度也影响框架的分散力。最近的报告表明，质子或交换金属离子与基本氧物种之间的强静电场可以增强和/或诱导烃吸附物中键的极化。这种极化效应可以视为向氢化物抽离过渡的中间条件，这是CH活化的重要基本步骤。极化效应随电荷大小和离子半径的增加而增加。选择的阳离子应确保在反应条件下对目标烯烃产品没有催化作用。在沸石框架上创造CH极化效应可能是有益的，这可以通过适当修改框架原子来实现。活性位点通常在沸石框架上创建。双分子途径的活性位点是原位形成的，由离子结合到沸石框架氧离子的烷基卡宾离子组成。单分子途径的活性位点是沸石框架的质子平衡电荷。质子和卡宾离子是亲电性或路易斯酸性物种，两种途径本质上涉及亲电性CH活化。沸石中交换的金属离子通过一个或多个基本氧原子离子结合。根据沸石的阳离子交换位点密度和金属的引入方法，提出了不同的物种。当可交换的质子被严格替换为Zn和Ga时，H-ZSM-5获得了高烯烃选择性。OZn2+O位点上的CH活化可以通过路易斯碱辅助脱质子机制来描述，伴随路易斯碱位点转化为共轭布龙斯特酸位点。然而，OGa+位点通过氧化加成而不是质子位点中间体活化CH键。质子位点中间体增加了Zn交换的H-ZSM-5相对于Ga对应物的副反应倾向。OGa+的CH活化基本步骤揭示，金属中心的氧化还原循环是通过氧化加成机制催化CH活化所必需的。然而，在烷烃脱氢反应条件下，OZn2+O位点可以经历可逆的Zn2+/Zn氧化还原过程，增加了不希望的质子位点中间体的可用性。通过传统离子交换方法制备的Zn交换H-ZSM-5含有大量未交换的质子位点，导致催化剂的烯烃选择性降低。另一种增强烯烃选择性的策略是控制质子位点的强度。位点的酸性取决于沸石框架中三价阳离子的性质。硼硅酸盐沸石中的质子位点比铝硅酸盐弱，因此预计Zn/H[B]-ZSM-5在烷烃脱氢中的烯烃选择性高于Zn/H[Al]-ZSM-5。然而，Zn/H[B]-ZSM-5在丙烷脱氢中没有活性。Zn/H[B]-ZSM-5中所需较弱的质子位点酸性需要沸石框架中氧原子的较弱碱性。这种氧原子碱性的降低不足以补充交换的Zn2+在CH键断裂中的作用。消除沸石的质子位点对于获得高烯烃选择性和脱氢催化剂的稳定性至关重要。Pt是烷烃反应中最通用的贵金属催化剂，通常因其在这些反应中的较高活性、稳定性和选择性而被证明是合理的，与成本较低的替代过渡金属相比。然而，即使使用Pt基催化剂进行轻烷烃脱氢，由于焦炭形成导致的催化剂失活速度仍然很快。支持物上的酸（布龙斯特和路易斯）位点促进了烯烃的再吸附、寡聚化和芳构化。Pt与Sn、Ga、Zn、Re等金属的促进提高了催化剂的稳定性，但与Pt/Na[Fe]-ZSM-5相比，失活速度也更快。商业Cr和Pt基脱氢催化剂中钾的作用是最大限度地减少质子位点对烯烃选择性的不利影响。表面氧物种的性质和作用变得更加明显。Sn的电子促进效应与氧化加成CH活化机制一致。然而，路易斯碱辅助脱质子机制也可以解释在Cr基催化剂上提出的CH活化。最近的一份报告表明，一种多孔铜铝框架材料（由金属氧化物稳定）在丙烷脱氢中的性能（活性/选择性/稳定性）优于PtSn/Al2O3。可以在此处调用路易斯碱辅助脱质子机制，金属中心的氧化还原性质可能在实现350°C下的丙烷脱氢中发挥作用。这应该是非氧化脱氢较低烷烃的未来研究方向。", "Doi": "10.1016/j.fuproc.2016.04.016"},

site structures and dehydrogenation mechanisms are followed in the PDH process from a fundamental perspective.\n          In this section, the active sites, dehydrogenation pathways and deactivation mechanisms on Pt-based and representative metal oxide-based catalysts would be clarified.\n          The coordination saturated Pt atoms are more selective for propane dehydrogenation, while the coordinatively unsaturated Pt atoms will catalyze the side reactions, such as CC breaking and deep dehydrogenation, resulting in the formation of carbon deposits.\n          The adsorption configuration and strength of propylene can be both greatly perturbed by surface structures, coke formation is inherently governed by the surface geometric and electronic structures, and thus the construction of specific reaction ensembles is important.\n          Tuning the support's acidity and coke mobility can also inhibit the coke formation.\n          The effective strategies for inhibiting coke are summarized as follows.\n          Geometric separation: Previous research studies have shown that separating the active metal components could inhibit the structure-sensitive side reactions with improved propylene selectivity.\n          Electron richness: A high electron density of Pt particles is beneficial to weaken Pt(CC) bonds, inhibit coke precursors, and suppress deep

coke on acidic supports can also suppress the diffusion of reactive molecules.\n          Cofeeding streams: In addition to the modulation of catalyst structures and the properties of supports, changes in reaction conditions by cofeeding streams, such as H2, and CO2, can also have a positive effect on coke elimination.\n          Enhancing oxygen mobility: The oxidation of the adsorbed surface carbonaceous species can help eliminate the coke deposition over supported metals and thus is beneficial to the improvement of catalytic stability.\n          Coke transfer: In addition to

supports with high surface area and uniform pore size distribution are preferred.\n          Some alkaline metals, such as Li, Na, and K, can help poison the strong acid sites and avoid the coke deposition on the Al2O3 surface.\n          Additionally, doping Mg into Al2O3 forms a stable spinel phase.\n          An-Hui Lu and coworkers indicated that Al2O3 nanosheets with abundant penta-coordinate Al atoms have a strong metalsupport interaction owing to their capacity for anchoring Pt atoms, which accounts for their high stability.\n          Due to the weak interaction between

This crystal structure has a high concentration of weak Lewis acid sites (coordinatively unsaturated tetrahedral ones on the surface of the material), which are deemed to be centers of dehydrogenation activity.\n          The assignment of Lewis acid sites as the active species was substantiated by Chen et al., who, by relating the results of NH3-TPD measurements with activity data for different GaxAl10xO15 mixed oxides, showed that a high concentration of Lewis acid groups in the form of coordinatively unsaturated tetrahedral Ga3+ cations is a prerequisite for dehydrogenation activity.\n          Xu et al. reported dehydrogenation activity on both Lewis and Brnsted acid sites on GaO3/H-ZSM-5. A zeolitic support displaying a low concentration of medium and strong acid sites and a relatively high concentration of weak acid sites was found to lead to the most active and stable catalyst.\n          Michorczyk et al. concluded that acidic groups catalyze the reaction after observing that promotion with a base, such as potassium, resulted in a decrease in activity.\n          The structure of the support is also important, as a mesoporous GaAl mixed oxide exhibited an increased resistance to catalyst coking.\n          The function of K was to reduce coke formation by poisoning Brnsted acid sites.\n          Pt is believed to act as a promoter for the GaOx. Indeed, albeit 1000 ppm Pt/Al2O3 was found to be virtually inactive, 1000 ppm of Pt in combination with 3 wt % Ga afforded conversions close to the equilibrium and an propylene selectivity <95%.\n          The role of Pt is to assist hydrogen desorption, which facilitates the regeneration of the gallium hydride hydroxide species.\n          The exact nature of the active sites in Ga-based dehydrogenation catalysts is still under debate.\n          The chemistry of molybdenum oxide is comparable to that of vanadium oxide, as Mo can be present as MoOx monomers, polymers, or MoO3 crystallites, depending on the molybdenum loading, the type of support used, and catalyst preparation conditions.\n          The reducibility of the catalyst with hydrogen prior to reaction increases conversion, although selectivity decreases due to the formation of acid sites.\n          The chemistry of molybdenum oxide is comparable to that of vanadium oxide, as Mo can be present as MoOx monomers, polymers, or MoO3 crystallites, depending on the molybdenum loading, the type of support used, and catalyst preparation conditions.\n          The reducibility of the catalyst with hydrogen prior to reaction increases conversion, although selectivity decreases due to the formation of acid sites.\n          The chemistry of molybdenum oxide is comparable to that of vanadium oxide, as Mo can be present as MoOx monomers, polymers, or MoO3 crystallites, depending on the molybdenum loading, the type of support used, and catalyst preparation conditions.\n          The reducibility of the catalyst with hydrogen prior to reaction increases conversion, although selectivity decreases due to the formation of acid sites.\n          The chemistry of molybdenum oxide is comparable to that of vanadium oxide, as Mo can be present as MoOx monomers, polymers, or MoO3 crystallites, depending on the molybdenum loading, the type of support used, and catalyst preparation conditions.\n          The reducibility of the catalyst with hydrogen prior to reaction increases conversion, although selectivity decreases due to the formation of acid sites.\n          The chemistry of molybdenum oxide is comparable to that of vanadium oxide, as Mo can be present as MoOx monomers, polymers, or MoO3 crystallites, depending on the molybdenum loading, the type of support used, and catalyst preparation conditions.\n          The reducibility of the catalyst with hydrogen prior to reaction increases conversion, although selectivity decreases due to the formation of acid sites.\n          The chemistry of molybdenum oxide is comparable to that of vanadium oxide, as Mo can be present as MoOx monomers, polymers, or MoO3 crystallites, depending on the molybdenum loading, the type of support used, and catalyst preparation conditions.\n          The reducibility of the catalyst with hydrogen prior to reaction increases conversion, although selectivity decreases due to the formation of acid sites.\n          The chemistry of molybdenum oxide is comparable to that of vanadium oxide, as Mo can be present as MoOx monomers, polymers, or MoO3 crystallites, depending on the molybdenum loading, the type of support used, and catalyst preparation conditions.\n          The reducibility of the catalyst with hydrogen prior to reaction increases conversion, although selectivity decreases due to the formation of acid sites.\n          Alumina is by far the most common support, and a variety of methods to produce chromiaalumina catalysts have been investigated.\n          The nature of the support is important not only because it governs the mechanical properties of the catalyst, but also because the interaction of the carrier with the active phase can have a profound impact on catalyst activity and selectivity.\n          Albeit selectivity has been found to be insensitive to chromium loading, it does change over time.\n          The use of zirconia as an alternative support has also been investigated.\n          The use of silica as the support in chromia-based dehydrogenation catalysts requires a relative high surface area to stabilize Cr6+ sites.\n          CrMgAl and CrMg mixed oxides prepared using layered double hydroxide (LDH) precursors have been studied as catalysts for the nonoxidative dehydrogenation of ethane.\n          Finally, the study of porous chromia-pillared α-zirconium phosphate materials has been particularly informative with regards to the influence that acidity has on catalytic behavior.\n          The surface area-to-metal loading ratio determines which species will form. Indeed, Wu et al. reported that monomeric species are predominantly present below 1.2 V/nm2, polymeric vanadium species prevail between 1.2 and 4.4 V/nm2, and crystalline V2O5 species preponderate at even higher loadings.\n          On the one hand, the presence of hydroxyl groups on the surface of the support is important to obtain a well-dispersed catalyst, as OH groups serve as anchoring sites for the vanadium precursors used to prepare these catalysts. On the other hand, acid sites are detrimental for catalyst performance, because they facilitate cracking and induce coke formation.\n          Alumina is commonly used as a support for vanadium oxide catalysts, although Sokolov et al. concluded through testing a wide range of Si- and Al-based supports that using silica to dope the alumina support provides beneficial effects on catalyst stability and activity.\n          Furthermore, as was shown by Harlin et al., the performance of supported vanadium catalysts can be improved through the addition of MgO, either as a promoter or as a component of a mixed oxide. According to these workers, the increase in dehydrogenation selectivity stems from the basic nature of MgO, resulting in reduced coke formation.\n          The reducibility of the vanadium species depends on their molecular structure, VOV and VO bonds being more easily reduced than VO-support bonds.\n          Prior to reaction, the vanadium in these catalysts is generally present as V5+.

The interaction between the support and the active phase can also alter the electronic properties of the catalyst, which can further enhance its performance. Support modification strategies, such as doping with alkali metals or using mixed oxides, can optimize these properties for enhanced catalytic efficiency and selectivity.

For example, the surface area-to-metal loading ratio determines the formation of different vanadium species, which affects the catalytic activity. The reducibility of vanadium species also influences the catalytic performance. The addition of MgO can improve the selectivity of vanadium-based catalysts by reducing coke formation. Using silica to dope alumina support can enhance the stability and activity of vanadium oxide catalysts. The type of support and preparation conditions can affect the formation of molybdenum oxide species. Hydrogen reduction can increase conversion but decrease selectivity due to the formation of acid sites. The structure of the support, such as mesoporous GaAl mixed oxide, can increase the resistance to catalyst coking. Poisoning Brnsted acid sites with K can reduce coke formation. Alumina is the most common support, and various methods have been explored to produce chromia-alumina catalysts. The choice of support can also influence the stability and dispersion of the active phase, which in turn affects the catalytic efficiency and selectivity. For example, zirconia has been investigated as an alternative support due to its low surface acidity and enhanced sintering resistance, which can improve the performance of chromia-based catalysts. The acidity of the support can also play a role in catalytic behavior, as demonstrated by the study of porous chromia-pillared α-zirconium phosphate materials. Support modification strategies, such as doping with alkali metals or using mixed oxides, can optimize these properties for enhanced catalytic efficiency and selectivity. For instance, doping with alkali metals can stabilize the structure of the support, reduce surface acidity, and increase the number of active sites. Using mixed oxides can also improve the thermal stability and coking resistance of the catalysts. The surface area-to-metal loading ratio determines the formation of monomeric, polymeric, or crystalline vanadium species on the catalyst. Hydroxyl groups on the support surface are important for anchoring vanadium precursors, while acid sites are detrimental to catalyst performance. Silica doping of alumina support can improve catalyst stability and activity. Addition of MgO can improve dehydrogenation selectivity by reducing coke formation. The reducibility of vanadium species depends on their molecular structure. Molybdenum oxide can exist as monomers, polymers, or crystallites, depending on loading, support, and preparation conditions. Optimal molybdenum oxide activity is achieved with monolayer coverage on alumina. Hydrogen reduction of molybdenum oxide catalyst increases conversion but decreases selectivity. Ga2O3 polymorphs, particularly β-Ga2O3, have high concentration of weak Lewis acid sites for dehydrogenation activity. Coordinatively unsaturated tetrahedral Ga3+ cations are crucial for dehydrogenation activity. High concentration of Lewis acid groups in the form of Ga3+ cations is necessary for dehydrogenation activity. Zeolitic support with low medium and strong acid sites and high weak acid sites leads to most active and stable GaO3/H-ZSM-5 catalyst. Promotion with a base like potassium decreases activity, indicating acidic groups catalyze the reaction. Mesoporous GaAl mixed oxide has increased resistance to coking. Potassium reduces coke formation by poisoning Brnsted acid sites. Platinum acts as a promoter for GaOx, enhancing conversion and selectivity. Platinum assists hydrogen desorption, facilitating regeneration of gallium hydride hydroxide species. The nature of active sites in Ga-based dehydrogenation catalysts is still under debate. Molybdenum oxide can exist as monomers, polymers, or crystallites, depending on loading, support, and preparation conditions. Hydrogen reduction of catalyst increases conversion but decreases selectivity due to acid site formation. The physicochemical properties of catalysts, including chemical qualities and morphological characteristics, significantly influence their performance in dehydrogenation reactions. Alumina is the most common support, and its interaction with the active phase can profoundly impact catalyst activity and selectivity. Noble metals, particularly platinum, are preferred for their superior activation of paraffinic CH bonds and low activity for CC cleavage. The addition of alkaline metals like lithium, sodium, and potassium can poison acid sites on the support, suppressing coke formation. Zirconia is an alternative support that has been investigated, offering low surface acidity and enhanced sintering resistance. Silica requires a high surface area to stabilize Cr6+ sites. Mixed oxides prepared using layered double hydroxide precursors have also been studied for nonoxidative dehydrogenation reactions. The acidity of the support material, such as in chromia-pillared α-zirconium phosphate, can significantly affect catalytic behavior. The physicochemical properties of catalysts, including chemical qualities and morphological characteristics, significantly influence their performance in dehydrogenation reactions. The surface area-to-metal loading ratio determines the formation of different vanadium species, which affects the catalytic activity. The presence of hydroxyl groups on the support surface is crucial for anchoring vanadium precursors, while large V2O5 crystallites are inactive in dehydrogenation. The reducibility of vanadium species depends on their molecular structure, and the reduction of the catalyst by the hydrocarbon feed results in the formation of V4+ and V3+. Initially, deactivation is caused by the strong adsorption of reactants on the active sites and coke deposition. The calcination of the catalyst can remove coke but may further deactivate the catalyst due to the formation of larger V2O5 crystallites or mixed oxides. V2O5 crystallites can revert to active polymeric vanadium species under certain conditions. The addition of CO2 can have a beneficial effect on the catalyst by removing acid sites, facilitating coke gasification, and promoting hydrogen removal. The effect of CO2 depends on the catalyst support, with relatively weak basic sites on activated carbon support facilitating the reverse water gas shift reaction, while strong basic sites on Al2O3 and ZnO2 can be poisoned by CO2. Using silica to dope the alumina support can improve catalyst stability and activity. The addition of MgO can improve the performance of supported vanadium catalysts by reducing coke formation. The physicochemical properties of catalysts, including chemical qualities and morphological characteristics, significantly influence their performance in dehydrogenation reactions. The nature of the support is crucial as it not only determines the mechanical properties of the catalyst but also affects the interaction between the carrier and the active phase, which can profoundly impact catalyst activity and selectivity. For instance, alumina is the most common support, and the method of producing chromia-alumina catalysts can vary, affecting the catalyst's performance. The choice of support can also influence the catalytic activity, with different supports leading to varying orders of activity based on conversion and yield. Zirconia, as an alternative support, has been investigated for its low surface acidity and enhanced sintering resistance. Silica requires a high surface area to stabilize Cr6+ sites, and mixed oxides prepared using layered double hydroxide precursors have been studied for their catalytic properties in dehydrogenation reactions. The acidity of the support, as seen in chromia-pillared α-zirconium phosphate materials, can also influence catalytic behavior, with strong acid sites affecting cracking reactions and medium strength acid sites impacting dehydrogenation reactions. Support modification strategies can be employed to optimize the properties of catalysts for enhanced catalytic efficiency and selectivity. For example, doping alumina-based dehydrogenation catalysts with alkali ions can effectively poison undesirable acid sites, improving selectivity. Using zirconia as a support can prevent the formation of mixed oxides and offer higher thermal stability and surface area. Silica, with its high surface area, can stabilize Cr6+ sites, while mixed oxides prepared using layered double hydroxide precursors can provide improved coking resistance and thermal stability against sintering. Understanding the role of acidity in catalytic behavior can also guide the modification of supports to favor dehydrogenation reactions over cracking reactions. The physicochemical properties of catalysts, including chemical qualities and morphological characteristics, significantly influence their performance in dehydrogenation reactions. For instance, the nature of the support material, such as alumina, zirconia, or silica, can affect the dispersion and stability of the active phase, thereby impacting the catalytic activity and selectivity.

The stability and tolerance to carbon deposits of Zr-Al-Beta promoted by alkali-metal ions were demonstrated. The modification of alkali-metal ions on both Lewis acid sites and Brnsted acid sites in Zr-Al-Beta was evidenced by XPS and FT-IR spectroscopy. The untreated materials displayed poor product selectivity and high coke deposit in the Meerwein-Ponndorf-Verley reduction of furfural and isopropanol; however, the treatment of alkali-metal ions promoted their catalytic performance with improved recalcitrance to deactivation and coking significantly. The type of alkali-metal ions and the concentration of alkaline solution influenced the catalytic performance, which were found to correlate to the acidity and textual properties. The optimum reaction result (97.3% yield of furfuryl alcohol at 99.6% conversion of furfural) can be obtained on 0.025 M-Na+-Zr-Al-Beta with high tolerance to the furfural concentration. Support modification strategies can be employed to optimize these properties for enhanced catalytic efficiency and selectivity by tuning and normalizing the various acidic sites of zeolites.

The exploitation of an efficient PDH catalyst based on HZSM-5 zeolite to achieve both high selectivity and stability is still a challenge. In zeolite supported catalysts, zeolite provides a special environment for catalytic reactions, including channel confinement effects, acidic sites, and electron transfer. Acidic sites in zeolites play a key role in determining the catalytic performance of zeolite catalysts in alkane conversion.

This in turn affected the distribution of different surface V species.\nGu et al. reported that P modification could greatly influence the structure and activity of VOx/Al2O3 catalysts.142 More specifically, P modification decreased the degree of VOx polymerization, which had positive implications on the catalyst stability, as evidenced by the retention of high activity (ca. 45% propane conversion) after an 8 h DDH reaction in all P-modified catalysts.\nSubsequent studies on a VOx/Al2O3 catalysts (with 12 wt% V loading) modified with Mg revealed the anti-coking capability and improved catalytic performance evident through propene yields of 1927% over a 6 h DDH reaction.143 It was found that the dispersing action of Mg modification to V2O5 crystallites and an increase in active V3+ species reduced the amount and polymerization of coke deposits.\nThe concentration of dopant atoms, and the temperature of reduction were other contributing factors that affected the catalytic behaviour for ZrO2-based catalysts.3 Numerous binary YZrOx and LaZrOx-based catalysts displayed high activity, selectivity and stability as well as comparable performance to KCrOx/Al2O3 catalysts over the course of 60 DDH cycles at 550 C, 600 C and 625 C under industrially relevant conditions. The experimental parameters had a beneficial effect on the concentration of Zrcus4+ ions, and the concentration of surface lattice oxygen, which in tandem play an active role in propane activation.\nThe specific requirements of catalyst design for each sub-reaction are discussed and we identify that, regardless of the method of dehydrogenation, the balance of acid and base sites on the catalyst surface is of paramount importance.\nThe development of an active, selective and stable catalyst is essential for dehydrogenation to be considered as a viable process in the near- and long-term future.\nThe exact composition of the HGM is likely to include copper oxide and additional promotors such as MnO2, supported on α-Al2O3.\nThe role of Cu in the catalyst was to dilute the Pt species and promote desorption of propene, thereby enhancing selectivity.\nThe h-BN nanosheets provided abundant stacking fault edges terminated with BO defects that are associated with unpaired electrons, which strongly interact with active metal species, helping to strengthen the interaction between the metal and support.\nThe preparation of new catalysts with simultaneously enhanced activity, selectivity and stability is the ultimate goal.\nThe modification of Al2O3 with metal oxides, such as TiO2 has been undertaken with some promising results.\nThe enhanced performance was ascribed to electron transfer and acid site modulation effects resulting in changes to the adsorption properties of Pt.\nThe enhanced performance and stability was attributed to ultra-small, uniformly dispersed particles, ranging in size from 1.0 to 1.4 nm, consistent with previous studies that observed structure-sensitivity.\nThe role of the subsurface was to facilitate the activation of propane on the surface.\nThe role of the support is simply to maximise the active Cr6+ surface area, rather than add any chemical functionality, hence this is the reason why chemically-unreactive supports such as SiO2 and activated carbon yield the most active CrOX catalysts.\nThe most significant barrier to commercial application is the poor on-stream stability exhibited by all chromium-based catalysts.\nThe stability was improved in the presence of CO2 (compared to DDH); ca. 74% of the original activity was retained after 10 h on-stream, which is relatively good compared to Ga- and Cr-based catalysts.\nThe origin of stability was linked to the low rate of coking associated with the spinel catalyst.\nThe role of CO2 in ODH-CO2 is to assist the above equilibrium by removing H2via the RWGS reaction.\nThe origin of this induction period was found to be reduction of In2O3 to In0 nanoclusters, which suggests the active structure is more of a supported nanoparticle type catalyst than a mixed-metal oxide.\nThe basicity of the In/ZrO2 system was suggested to promote the RWGS reaction, which in turn boosted the ODH-CO2 activity.\nThe initial STY of this catalyst was 10.7 molC3H6 kgcat1 h1 (Table 13, entry 4), which is amongst the most active reported to date, but requires significant improvements to its on-stream stability.\nDespite the low selectivity, the FeCeO2 catalysts exhibited a comparable STY to supported In2O3 (Table 13) and some Ga2O3 catalysts (Table 12).\nThe major side-reactions observed were dry reforming and cracking.\nThe cationanion double hydrolysis approach (CADH), used for the synthesis of mesoporous Al2O3 with high surface area and a pure γ-Al2O3 phase, was undertaken with the crystallisation temperature varied between 25120 C.141 It was found that the crystallisation temperature of the support directly influenced the catalytic performance of the VOx/Al2O3 catalysts, which was a consequence of the increase in Lewis acid sites with increasing crystallization temperatures up to 100 C. This in turn affected the distribution of different surface V species.\nThe authors concluded that the relative proportions of V3+, V4+ and V5+ species present on the catalyst surface were affected by V loading and at the optimal loading of 12 wt%, a high concentration of isolated V3+ species was detected.\nGu et al. reported that P modification could greatly influence the structure and activity of VOx/Al2O3 catalysts.142 More specifically, P modification decreased the degree of VOx polymerization, which had positive implications on the catalyst stability, as evidenced by the retention of high activity (ca. 45% propane conversion) after an 8 h DDH reaction in all P-modified catalysts.\nThe combined and synergistic effect of the surface acidity modifications, their influence on the active V3+ species, and weakened metalsupport interactions facilitated desorption of propene and inhibited the deep dehydrogenation that leads to coke precursors.\nSubsequent studies on a VOx/Al2O3 catalysts (with 12 wt% V loading) modified with Mg revealed the anti-coking capability and improved catalytic performance evident through propene yields of 1927% over a 6 h DDH reaction.143 It was found that the dispersing action of Mg modification to V2O5 crystallites and an increase in active V3+ species reduced the amount and polymerization of coke deposits.\nThe highest STY achieved was 7.8 molC3H6 kg1cat h1 (Table 6, entry 7).\nThe moderate vanadium doping level was conducive to highly dispersed vanadium species in the form of isolated and low-polymerized VOx species.\nHighly dispersed and stable VOx species, and an absence of V2O5 crystallites, were conducive to high catalytic activity and stability.\nThe STY was 6.2 molC3H6 kg1cat h1 (Table 6, entry 5), due to the low GHSV so while the catalyst achieved high selectivity at reasonable propane conversion, it was not as intrinsically active as other supported VOx catalysts.\nThe most active catalyst, V/Si-beta (having 3 wt% V loading) displayed an initial propene yield of 33.4% and retained activity over multiple dehydrogenationregeneration cycles.\nThe STY was 4.4 molC3H6 kg1cat h1 (Table 6, entry 6), which is 56 times less active than the most active VOx catalysts reported to date, suggesting that Si-beta does not facilitate a high concentration of active V sites.\nIt was found that VOx/ZrO2 is approximately five times more active than VOx/Al2O3 and pure ZrO2, exhibiting a STY of 9.2 molC3H6 kg1cat h1 (Table 6, entry 2).\nThe authors proposed that the enhanced performance of VOx/ZrO2 results from the facile reduction of VO, VOV and VOZr bonds, thus producing higher proportions of the active V3+ species.\nFor the most active catalyst, with 8 wt% V loading, the initial yield of propene increased from 24% at 550 C to 28% at 575 C with a negligible (<1%) increase at 600 C.\nThis corresponded to a STY of 24 molC3H6 kg1cat h1 (Table 6, entry 3), which is one of the most active VOx-based catalysts reported.\nThe STY of ZrO2 without VOx is actually much higher than in the current work.\nThe most active V species has been identified, the relative proportion and stability of this surface V species can be tuned by varying the preparation method.\nThe role of the other V species on the DDH reaction remains unclear so further work to elucidate this could yield more active and stable DDH catalysts.\nThe range in performance of V-based catalysts varies quite significantly, with the most active catalysts exhibiting STYs that are around 34 time less active than the most active Pt catalysts.\nThe specific requirements of catalyst design for each sub-reaction are discussed and we identify that, regardless of the method of dehydrogenation, the balance of acid and base sites on the catalyst surface is of paramount importance.\nThe development of an active, selective and stable catalyst is essential for dehydrogenation to be considered as a viable process in the near- and long-term future.\nIn the case of SC and coal-based MTO, this is unavoidable due to the nature of the feedstock. However, natural gas and propane can be produced from biomass. In these cases, the feedstock is renewable and so these processes are potentially much more sustainable than when using fossil fuels.\nThe majority of analyses focus on well-established processes, where more information and data are available, but no such analyses were found for oxidative dehydrogenation.\nThe thermodynamic tendency to form undesirable by-products means that such reactions must be carefully kinetically controlled. Careful catalyst design can inhibit and even switch-off some of these side-reactions, as will be discussed in the subsequent sections.\nThe exact composition of the HGM is likely to include copper oxide and additional promotors such as MnO2, supported on α-Al2O3.\nThe role of Cu in the catalyst was to dilute the Pt species and promote desorption of propene, thereby enhancing selectivity.\nThe role of the subsurface was to facilitate the activation of propane on the surface.\nThe preparation strategy could greatly influence the structure of Ga/SiO2 catalysts.\nThe preparation of GaRh supported catalytically active liquid metal solutions.\nThe GaPt alloy melts at temperatures between 270 C and 330 C.\nThe activity is dependent on the bond strength of the VOsupport bond.\nThe metalsupport (VOsupport) interactions affect the resultant catalyst performance.\nThe catalyst deactivated quickly due to carbon deposition, but retained its initial activity over the course of ten successive dehydrogenationregeneration cycles.\nThe first study of Cr2O3-based catalysts for ODH-CO2 was reported by Takahara et al. in 1996 using Cr2O3 supported on SiO2, activated carbon (AC) or Al2O3.\nIt was found that over 5 wt% Cr2O3/SiO2, the propene yield increased from 6.5% to 9.1% when CO2 was co-fed instead of Ar.\nIn contrast, the alumina supported catalyst was inhibited by the addition of CO2, as shown by the drop in propene yield from 12.7% to 3.3%.\nThe 5 wt% Cr2O3/AC material was unaffected by CO2 addition.\nThe Cr2O3/SiO2 catalyst deactivated rapidly, retaining just 66% of its original activity after 4 h on-stream.\nThe stability was noted to the same with or without CO2 in the reactant feed.\nNot only did this study establish Cr2O3 as an active ODH-CO2 catalyst, it also captured one of the recurring themes in catalyst design for ODH-CO2: some catalysts are inhibited by the addition of CO2 while others perform much better.\nRelative to many other metal oxides, Cr2O3 is considered to be one of the most promising catalysts for ODH-CO2.\nTakehira et al. compared the catalytic performance of several d block and p block oxides (namely Cr, Ga, Ni, V, Fe, Mn and Co) supported on MCM-41, at 550 C with a CO2:C3H8 molar ratio of 5.6.\nAfter 30 min on-stream, the propene yield of the Cr-based catalyst was 15% whereas for the Ga-based counterpart it was 5%.\nThe remaining catalysts all exhibited lower propene yields (in the 14% range).\nHowever, as the catalysts were not characterised, it is unclear if the dispersion of these catalysts was comparable, and therefore if the results reflect the true intrinsic activity of each metal.\nIt was also noted that the order of reactivity resembled the trends observed by Nakagawa et al. for diamond-supported metal catalysts in the DDH reaction.\nThis suggests that there are commonalities in catalyst design between DDH and ODH-CO2 which most likely relate to the interaction of the alkane with the catalyst.\nContrary to this, Zhang et al. compared ZrO2, SBA-15 and γ-Al2O3 as supports for Cr2O3 in the DDH, ODH-CO2 and ODH-O2 reactions.\nThey found that the highest propene yield was observed with different catalyst systems under different dehydrogenation reactions, i.e., the activity trends in DDH did not translate to ODH-CO2 catalysts.\nSpecifically, Cr2O3/ZrO2 catalyst was the most active for the DDH reaction, while the highest yield of propene for the ODH-CO2 and ODH-O2 reactions was observed over Cr2O3/SBA-15 (Table 11, entry 7).\nAcross all the catalysts however, the highest propene yields were generally observed in the DDH reaction, ascribed to the production of carbon oxides in the ODH-O2 and ODH-CO2 reactions.\nHowever, it was reported that Cr2O3/ZrO2 was more stable on-stream in ODH-CO2 than in the DDH reaction.\nWu et al. also observed increased stability of Cr2O3/ZrO2 in the presence of CO2 (Table 11, entry 4).\nThey reported that the CO formation rate was higher than the CO2 consumption rate and the excess CO was suggested to originate from the Boudouard reaction (CO2 + C  2CO); this could explain the increased stability of this catalyst.\nIt is possible that some dry reforming of propane also took place, which would produce H2 and CO.\nZhao et al. recently reported the facile preparation of Cr supported in mesoporous ZrO2 using an evaporation-induced self-assembly method (Table 11, entry 6).\nThe authors suggested that propene could react with carbon dioxide to form carbon monoxide, methane and water.\nOther studies have reported a stronger inhibition effect for Cr2O3/ZrO2 catalysts in the presence of CO2.\nFor instance, Ferreira et al. studied the adsorption properties of CO2 and concluded that it binds strongly to active Cr2O3 sites, lowering the activity and stability of the catalyst,\nwhereas Xie et al. suggested that coke formation could originate from CO2 hydrogenation over Cr2+ species.\nThese conflicting reports may relate to the structural polymorph of ZrO2 present in the catalyst support; this factor is often overlooked, but recent studies from Kondratenko et al. revealed that nanocrystalline ZrO2 is an active DDH catalyst in its own right151,152 under similar reaction conditions.\nThe ZrO2 crystal phase and crystallite size were strongly correlated to the catalyst activity: smaller crystallites were more active but amorphous ZrO2 had very low intrinsic activity.\nMoreover, monoclinic ZrO2 was more active than tetragonal ZrO2.\nCr2O3-catalysed ODH-CO2 has been examined over different polymorphs of SiO2,254256 including various structured porous oxides, including SBA-1,84 SBA-15,250,257 MCM-41,91 amorphous silica84 and mesoporous silica spheres.258\nNotably, Michorczyk et al. reported a detailed comparison of different silica supports, coupled with an in-depth characterisation study.84\nIt was shown that in each case, the same active Cr species was formed, namely Cr6+, but higher surface area silicas (e.g., SBA-1 and SBA-15) were able to facilitate a higher number of such sites.\nA clear correlation was found between the rate of propene formation and the wt% of Cr6+, as determined using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS).\nIn DDH, while Cr6+ is considered active, under reaction conditions Cr3+ is rapidly formed and considered the principle active species.93,94\nThe selectivity to propene was similar across the different silica supports (8893%), with the observed differences being attributable to differences in propane conversion rather than catalytic properties.\nThese Cr2O3/SiO2 catalysts were highly active at 550 C and the most active catalyst (Cr2O3/SBA-1) achieved a STY of 7.9 molC3H6 kgcat1 h1, as shown in Table 11, entry 12.\nIt should be noted that the experiments were carried out with a CO2:C3H8 ratio of 5, which as discussed above, has been shown to enable a higher equilibrium yield of propene.\nTherefore, in studies where high conversions are generally targeted and carbon dioxide is in excess of propane, higher propene yields are reported.\nTakehira et al. carried out X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) on CrOx/MCM-41, confirming that the reduction of Cr6+ occurs during the reaction.91\nSpecifically, they identified Cr6+O4 tetrahedra as the active species.\nThese Cr3+O6 octahedra were formed after reduction, which were considered to be less active.\nIt was shown that CO2 could re-oxidise the Cr, which suggests that the redox cycle between Cr6+ and Cr3+ is an important process during the reaction.\nYi et al. discriminated between isolated Cr6+ and polymeric Cr6+, finding that after reduction, isolated Cr3+ was more active than polymeric Cr3+. This underlines the importance of Cr dispersion in these catalysts.259\nIn a more detailed examination of Cr2O3/SBA-1, the relationship between the physicochemical properties of the catalyst and the observed activity were explored.85\nMichorczyk et al. found a strong positive correlation between the initial propene yield and the reducibility of the catalyst, specifically the H2 consumption.\nIn situ UV-vis measurements revealed that Cr6+ is rapidly reduced to Cr3+ or Cr2+ in the presence of C3H8 under reaction conditions.\nThe reaction proceeds through a Mars-Van Krevelen mechanism, via the Cr2+/3+ redox couple.\nRapid deactivation, typical of Cr2O3 catalysts, was observed, although the majority of the initial activity could be recovered after regeneration in air.\nThe remainder was ascribed to pore collapse and/or the formation of inactive Cr sites, although the loss of surface Cr sites through agglomeration was not considered.\nDespite early reports that activated carbon (AC) was not a suitable support for Cr2O3, subsequent studies have shown that above 550 C, the activity of Cr2O3/AC in the presence of CO2 was higher than in the DDH reaction.260\nThe enhancement in propane conversion due to the presence of CO2 increased at higher temperatures (i.e., above 600 C), although this was chiefly due to propane dry reforming proceeding, generating CO and H2 rather than propene.\nWhile this Cr2O3/AC exhibited the highest STY of propene out of all CrOx-based catalysts (21 molC3H6 kgcat1 h1, Table 11, entry 9), it rapidly deactivated on-stream and due to the support being carbonaceous, cannot be regenerated using air.\nThis severely limits the utility of this catalyst.\nZeolites have also been considered as catalyst supports for Cr2O3.\nZhang et al. prepared CrOx/Na-ZSM-5 via incipient wetness.261\nAlthough the initial conversion and selectivity was high (48% and 86%, respectively) (Table 11, entry 5), the catalysts deactivated rapidly and the reaction conditions were such that the STY was only 2.5 molC3H6 kgcat1 h1 at 550 C with a CO2:C3H8 ratio of 2.\nZhu et al. investigated a range of MFI supports, including silicalite-1 and H[B]MFI.262\nCrOx/H[B]MFI was found to be the most active catalyst, giving a STY of 4.7 molC3H6 kgcat1 h1 at 600 C with a CO2:C3H8 of 1 (Table 11, entry 15).\nAlthough the as-prepared catalyst exhibited typically poor stability for Cr catalysts, steam treating the catalyst resulted in a marked improvement.\nAfter 60 h on-stream, the as-prepared catalyst retained only 25% of its initial conversion, while the steam treated catalyst retained ca. 74%.\nThe authors ascribed the effect to stabilised Cr3+ formed in the steam treatment.\nPresumably the reduction of Cr6+ during the reaction results in an inactive or less active Cr3+ species.\nIt should also be noted that the as-prepared catalyst was initially almost twice as active as the steam treated catalyst, which leaves the possibility that at higher conversions, increased coke formation may have occurred which would exaggerate the deactivation compared to the steam treated catalyst.\nIdeally such stability comparisons would be made at isoconversion, however this discovery is one of only a few that shows improved stability on-stream.\nRecently, Michorczyk et al. prepared a Cr-β-zeolite and investigated the effect of dealumination, which clearly elucidated the effect of acidity on the catalytic performance.263\nIt was reported that the dealuminated catalyst, Cr-SiBeta, exhibited significantly higher propene yields (up to 27%), compared to the Al-containing catalyst, Cr-AlBeta (2%).\nThe presence of acid sites in the Cr-AlBeta catalyst resulted in cracking pathways that led to increased production of methane and ethene.\nMoreover, the CrAlbeta catalyst performed less well in the presence of CO2 than in the DDH reaction.\nThis was explained by the strong adsorption of CO2 on the catalyst, similar to the inhibition observed over Cr2O3/Al2O3 catalysts.\nThe stability of the dealuminated catalyst was also improved compared with CrAlbeta, but significant loss in activity was observed over the 4 h reaction.\nIn considering the redox properties of the catalysts in this work, and their previous investigations, the authors also identified a strong correlation between the H2 consumption from H2-TPR studies and the reported propene yield, as shown in Fig. 10.\nWhile the majority of investigations on ODH-CO2 Cr2O3 catalysts have focused on support modifications, the addition of a promotor has also been shown to be beneficial.\nYun et al. demonstrated that the addition of 0.5 wt% Ni to a 10 wt% CrOx/SBA-15 catalyst increased the propane and CO2 conversion, as well as the on-stream stability.264\nAfter 1 h on-stream, the Ni-promoted catalyst was 50% more active and the conversion and selectivity was almost maintained over 12 h on-stream.\nIn contrast, the less active unpromoted catalyst retained only half of the initial activity over the same time period.\nUsing three-stage H2-TPR experiments (where the catalyst is reduced twice under H2 and then re-oxidised in CO2 before the final H2-TPR program), the authors showed that the addition of Ni facilitated the re-oxidation of Cr during the reaction.\nThis is consistent with previously reported mechanisms of deactivation over Cr-based catalysts, although coking is also often reported to cause deactivation.\nInterestingly, the promoted catalyst was marginally more prone to coking.\nThis strongly suggests that overreduction of active Cr sites is the key deactivation mechanism over these catalysts.\nThere is a lot of potential to develop promoted Cr catalysts that could enhance the redox activity of the catalyst; precious metals including Pd and Pt are often supported on reducible supports for this purpose.265\nCrucially, it was found that above 0.5 wt% Ni, propane reforming was prevalent, which underlines the importance of appropriate loadings of promotors.\nO'Brien et al. investigated the effect of a Ru promoter to a 10 wt% CrOx/SiO2 catalyst.\nConsistent with Yun et al. it was shown that the propene formation rate was increased.\nA 1 wt% Ru loading was optimal and doubled the activity.\nInterestingly, this is approximately the same molar ratio reported as the optimum by Yun et al. for Ni-promoted CrOx/SBA-15 (Table 11, entry 14).\nAnother similarity was the propensity of reforming to dominate at high loadings (>1 wt%).\nThe enhanced stability seen in Ni-promoted Cr catalysts was not observed in this work and the activity could not be fully recovered after regeneration.\nConsequently, aggregation of Cr species was suggested as an additional deactivation mechanism in addition to coke formation and overreduction of Cr.\nRather than aid Cr re-oxidation in a one-step oxidative dehydrogenation, the authors concluded that the Ru promotes the RWGS reaction, which removes H2 and increases the equilibrium conversion of propane.\nHowever, the results of three-stage H2-TPR reactions indicated that Cr can be more easily oxidised in the presence of Ru, which suggests that Ru can participate in a similar role as Ni-promoted Cr catalysts.\nOverall supported chromium oxide catalysts represent one of the most active classes of ODH-CO2 catalysts, with STY values in the range of 222 molC3H6 kgcat1 h1.\nThe role of the support is simply to maximise the active Cr6+ surface area, rather than add any chemical functionality, hence this is the reason why chemically-unreactive supports such as SiO2 and activated carbon yield the most active CrOX catalysts.\nThe most significant barrier to commercial application is the poor on-stream stability exhibited by all chromium-based catalysts.\nWhile incremental improvements in the activity of Cr catalysts have been reported since their initial discovery, significant advances in catalyst stability have been relatively few.\nThe first study of Cr2O3-based catalysts for ODH-CO2 was reported by Takahara et al. in 1996 using Cr2O3 supported on SiO2, activated carbon (AC) or Al2O3.\nThe 5 wt% Cr2O3/SiO2 catalyst deactivated rapidly, retaining just 66% of its original activity after 4 h on-stream.\nThe stability was noted to the same with or without CO2 in the reactant feed.\nNot only did this study establish Cr2O3 as an active ODH-CO2 catalyst, it also captured one of the recurring themes in catalyst design for ODH-CO2: some catalysts are inhibited by the addition of CO2 while others perform much better.\nThe correct balance of acidic and basic sites is a key consideration in catalyst design.\nEqually, the ratio of carbon dioxide to propane is important to take in account, as it has kinetic and thermodynamic implications.\nThermodynamically, higher CO2:C3H8 ratios limit coke forming side-reactions.\nThe addition of CO2 in the dehydrogenation reaction has multiple effects: As discussed in Section 2, it facilitates the RWGS reaction which removes H2 from the system and shifts the thermodynamic equilibrium limit to favour propene production.\nAdditionally, CO2 can dissociate on the surface of a catalyst and provide O species to dehydrogenate propane directly.\nFinally, it can react with coke via the reverse-Boudouard reaction to produce CO, which can potentially extend the lifetime of the catalyst.\nThe role of the support is simply to maximise the active Cr6+ surface area, rather than add any chemical functionality, hence this is the reason why chemically-unreactive supports such as SiO2 and activated carbon yield the most active CrOX catalysts.\nThe most significant barrier to commercial application is the poor on-stream stability exhibited by all chromium-based catalysts.\nWhile incremental improvements in the activity of Cr catalysts have been reported since their initial discovery, significant advances in catalyst stability have been relatively few.\nThe addition of Al2O3 to ODH-CO2 catalysts is typically not beneficial.\nAlthough the addition of Al2O3 to ODH-CO2 catalysts is typically not beneficial, Chen et al. investigated spinel-type Ga2O3Al2O3 mixed oxides and showed that they can function as stable catalysts.\nThe origin of stability was linked to the low rate of coking associated with the spinel catalyst.\nUsing NH3-TPD analysis, the authors concluded that weak Lewis acid sites were conducive to high activity.\nThese acidbase properties most likely contribute to the enhanced stability as well; it is known that stronger acid sites promote oligomerisation pathways that produce coke.\nThe increased performance of Ga2O3/ZSM-48 was attributed to the abundance of weak and medium strength acid sites.\nThe low activity of Ga2O3/MgO and Ga2O3/SiO2 was ascribed to the absence of medium and strong acid sites.\nIn the Ga2O3/TiO2 catalyst, a significant proportion of the Ga (45%) was reduced.\nThis catalyst exhibited the highest propane conversion, but with a propene selectivity of 73% it did not result in the highest propene yield.\nThe origin of this induction period was found to be reduction of In2O3 to In0 nanoclusters, which suggests the active structure is more of a supported nanoparticle type catalyst than a mixed-metal oxide.\nThe basicity of the In/ZrO2 system was suggested to promote the RWGS reaction, which in turn boosted the ODH-CO2 activity.\nIt was found that 10 mol% Fe in CeO2 exhibited the highest propene yield.\nThe major side-reactions observed were dry reforming and cracking.\nThey showed that reforming pathways were more prevalent at higher CO2:C3H8 ratios, such as 2.5:1 and 5:1.\nDespite the low selectivity, the FeCeO2 catalysts exhibited a comparable STY to supported In2O3 and some Ga2O3 catalysts.\nThe number of studies on supported nanoparticle catalysts for ODH-CO2 are relatively few and those available indicate that this field of research has great potential.\nThe major challenge is in understanding and inhibiting side-reactions such as reforming, which are known to proceed over this class of catalyst, unlike in Cr- and Ga-based catalysts.\nCareful consideration of the nanostructure and composition has shown that the selectivity can be readily tuned to favour different pathways, and further investigation in this area may well be able to harness the high activity of supported nanoparticles as well as favour dehydrogenation pathways.\nDespite dozens of reports over several decades on Cr- and Ga- based catalysts, the improvements in catalyst performance have been incremental.\nThe knowledge gained from these studies on the importance of reducibility and the balance of acid and base sites should be applied to supported NP catalysts, which are a promising and somewhat neglected category of ODH-CO2 catalyst.\nThe specific requirements of catalyst design for each sub-reaction are discussed and we identify that, regardless of the method of dehydrogenation, the balance of acid and base sites on the catalyst surface is of paramount importance.\nThe development of an active, selective and stable catalyst is essential for dehydrogenation to be considered as a viable process in the near- and long-term future.\nIn the case of SC and coal-based MTO, this is unavoidable due to the nature of the feedstock. However, natural gas and propane can be produced from biomass.\nThe increased interest in direct propane dehydrogenation has been enhanced by the fall in propane price, which is the direct result of the discovery of vast shale gas reserves in North America.\nThe production of renewable green propane (also called bio-propane and bioLPG) is an emerging sector which is already being operated on a large scale.\nWith increasing pressure to source chemical feedstocks sustainably, we can expect that new interest will focus on renewable and green routes to the key platform chemicals currently required by modern society, and that green propane will play an important role in this.\nThe majority (86%) of filed patents are for DDH catalysts, followed by ODH-O2 (12%) and finally ODH-CO2 (2.4%).\nThe exact composition of the HGM is likely to include copper oxide and additional promotors such as MnO2, supported on α-Al2O3.\nThe importance of Al speciation in improving catalyst performance and stability was investigated by Shi et al.\nThe modification of Al2O3 with metal oxides, such as TiO2 has been undertaken with some promising results.\nThe role of Cu in the catalyst was to dilute the Pt species and promote desorption of propene, thereby enhancing selectivity.\nThe role of the subsurface was to facilitate the activation of propane on the surface.\nThe irreversible initial deactivation in the consecutive DDH cycles was attributed to either: (i) structural changes of active species (such as agglomeration), or (ii) collapse of pore structure.\nThe positive effect was attributed to the promoters ability to block the sites responsible for coke formation and negligible contribution to undesirable secondary reactions by the additional acid sites generated by the P-based modifier.\nThe authors attributed this enhanced performance to a high dispersion of Cr species, moderate acidity and strong metalsupport interactions in the CrOx/H-ZSM-5(260) catalyst.\nThe authors attributed high Ga/Al ratios (>0.5) with the formation of additional GaxOy clusters which negatively affected the dehydrogenation rate and thus catalytic performance.\nThe activity is dependent on the bond strength of the VOsupport bond. Therefore, it is expected that catalyst performance is affected when different supports, such as SiO2, Al2O3 and ZrO2 are utilised.", "English": "The physicochemical properties of catalysts, including chemical qualities and morphological characteristics, significantly influence their performance in dehydrogenation reactions. The crystallization temperature of the support directly affects the catalytic performance of VOx/Al2O3 catalysts by increasing Lewis acid sites and influencing the distribution of different surface V species. P modification can decrease the degree of VOx polymerization, enhancing catalyst stability and activity. Mg modification can improve catalytic performance and anti-coking capability by dispersing V2O5 crystallites and increasing active V3+ species. Gelation and calcination temperatures also impact the catalytic performance of VOx/SiO2 catalysts in terms of propane conversion, propene selectivity, and yield of propene. Dealuminated beta zeolites (Si-beta) are promising catalyst supports due to their high surface area and thermal stability, and the initial propane conversion linearly increases with the amount of acid sites. VOx/ZrO2 is more active than VOx/Al2O3 and pure ZrO2 due to the facile reduction of VO, VOV, and VOZr bonds, producing higher proportions of the active V3+ species. The balance of acid and base sites on the catalyst surface is crucial for all dehydrogenation methods. The development of an active, selective, and stable catalyst is essential for dehydrogenation to be considered a viable process in the future. Support modification strategies can optimize these properties for enhanced catalytic efficiency and selectivity. Using supports with ordered mesoporosity and moderate surface acidity can aid mass transfer and avoid undesirable secondary reactions. Promoting elements can cause beneficial geometric and electronic effects on both the supports and active species. However, environmental and safety concerns exist in the preparation, usage, and disposal of certain catalysts due to their toxicity. Ga catalysts, while less active than Pt and Cr catalysts, have the advantage of being benign and inexpensive. The nature of the support is essential for vanadium-based catalysts, as the metalsupport interactions affect the resultant catalyst performance. The activity is dependent on the bond strength of the VOsupport bond, and catalyst performance is affected by different supports.", "Chinese": "所有答案结果中的汇总中文答案 1", "Doi": "10.1039/D1GC03700E"},

The equilibrium conversion of alkanes increases with temperature, but alkene selectivity decreases due to an increased tendency toward dehydrocyclization/aromatisation, thermal cracking, and coke formation. The extent of PtSn interactions depends on the impregnation sequence of Pt and Sn precursors on the support material. The framework of microporous zeolites exerts dispersive forces on reactant molecules, which depend on the shape, channel, and cavity of the framework. The nature and density of active sites also influence the framework dispersion forces. Recent reports have shown that the strong electrostatic field between protons or exchanged metal ions and basic oxygen species can enhance and/or induce polarization of bonds in hydrocarbon adsorbates. This polarization effect can be viewed as an intermediate condition to hydride abstraction, an important elementary step in CH activation. The polarizing effect increases with increasing charge magnitude and ionic radius of the alkane polarizing cations. The choice of cations should be such that they exhibit no catalytic effects on the target alkene products at the reaction condition. It may be beneficial to create a CH polarization effect on the zeolite framework by appropriate modification of framework atoms. Active sites are usually created on the zeolite frameworks. The active sites of the bimolecular pathway are formed in situ and are made up of an alkyl carbenium ion ionically held to the zeolite framework oxygen ion. The active sites of the unimolecular pathway are the charge balancing protons of the zeolite framework. A proton and a carbenium ion are electrophilic or Lewis acid species, and the two pathways essentially involve electrophilic CH activation. The exchanged metal ions in zeolites are held ionically by one or more basic oxygen atoms. Different species have been suggested, depending on the density of the cation exchange site of the zeolite and the method of introduction of the metals. High alkene selectivities are obtained on the H-ZSM-5 when exchangeable protons are rigorously replaced by Zn and Ga. The CH activation on the OZn2+O site can be described by a Lewis base-assisted deprotonation mechanism, accompanied by conversion of the Lewis base site to a conjugate Bronsted acid site. The OGa+ site, however, activates the CH bond via oxidative addition without a protonic site intermediate. A protonic site intermediate increases the tendency of side reactions on the Zn-exchanged H-ZSM-5 relative to the Ga counterpart. The elementary steps of CH activation on OGa+ reveal that a redox cycle at the metal center is required for catalytic CH activation via the oxidative addition mechanism. However, under alkane dehydrogenation reaction conditions, the OZn2+O sites can undergo a reversible Zn2+/Zn redox process, increasing the availability of undesired protonic site intermediates. Zn-exchanged H-ZSM-5 prepared by conventional ion-exchange methods contain a significant percentage of unexchanged proton sites, leading to lower alkene selectivity of the catalyst. Another strategy to enhance alkene selectivity is by controlling the strength of the proton sites. The acidity of the sites depends on the nature of the trivalent cation of the zeolite framework. Proton sites in borosilicate zeolites are weaker than those of aluminosilicate, and thus higher alkene selectivity is expected for alkane dehydrogenation over Zn/H[B]-ZSM-5 compared to Zn/H[Al]-ZSM-5. However, Zn/H[B]-ZSM-5 shows no activity for propane dehydrogenation. The desired weaker acidity of the proton sites of Zn/H[B]-ZSM-5 requires weaker basicity of the oxygen atoms in the zeolite framework. This reduced basicity of the oxygen atoms is not sufficiently polarizing to complement the exchanged Zn2+ in CH bond cleavage. Elimination of the proton sites of zeolites is critical for obtaining a high alkene selectivity and stability in dehydrogenation catalysts. Pt is the most versatile noble metal catalyst for alkane reactions, often justified by its higher activity, stability, and selectivity for these reactions compared to less expensive alternative transition metals. However, rapid catalyst deactivation due to coke formation remains a challenge even when using a Pt-based catalyst for dehydrogenation of light alkanes. The presence of acid (Bronsted and Lewis) sites on the supports promotes readsorption, oligomerization, and aromatization of alkenes. Promotion of Pt with metals, such as Sn, Ga, Zn, Re, etc., improves catalyst stability, but also leads to faster deactivation rates than Pt/Na[Fe]-ZSM-5. The role of potassium in commercial Cr and Pt-based dehydrogenation catalysts is to minimize the undesired influence of protonic sites on alkene selectivity. The nature and role of surface oxygen species become more evident. The electronic promotion effect of Sn is in line with the oxidative addition CH activation mechanism. However, the Lewis base-assisted deprotonation mechanism could also explain the proposed CH activation on Cr-based catalysts. A recent report suggests that a porous copper-aluminum framework material (stabilized by metal oxide) has better performance (activity/selectivity/stability) for propane dehydrogenation than a PtSn/Al2O3. The Lewis base-assisted deprotonation mechanism may be invoked here, and the redox property of the metal center is likely to play a role in achieving propane dehydrogenation at 350 C. This should constitute the future research direction for non-oxidative dehydrogenation of lower alkanes.", "Chinese": "催化剂的物理化学性质，包括化学品质（如酸强度和稳定性）和形态特征，对脱氢反应的性能有重大影响。随着温度的升高，烷烃的平衡转化率增加，但由于脱氢环化/芳构化、热裂解和焦炭形成的倾向增加，烯烃的选择性降低。PtSn相互作用的程度取决于Pt和Sn前体在支撑材料上的浸渍顺序。微孔沸石框架对反应物分子施加的分散力取决于框架的形状、通道和腔体。活性位点的性质和密度也影响框架的分散力。最近的报告表明，质子或交换金属离子与基本氧物种之间的强静电场可以增强和/或诱导烃吸附物中键的极化。这种极化效应可以视为向氢化物抽离过渡的中间条件，这是CH活化的重要基本步骤。极化效应随电荷大小和离子半径的增加而增加。选择的阳离子应确保在反应条件下对目标烯烃产品没有催化作用。在沸石框架上创造CH极化效应可能是有益的，这可以通过适当修改框架原子来实现。活性位点通常在沸石框架上创建。双分子途径的活性位点是原位形成的，由离子结合到沸石框架氧离子的烷基卡宾离子组成。单分子途径的活性位点是沸石框架的质子平衡电荷。质子和卡宾离子是亲电性或路易斯酸性物种，两种途径本质上涉及亲电性CH活化。沸石中交换的金属离子通过一个或多个基本氧原子离子结合。根据沸石的阳离子交换位点密度和金属的引入方法，提出了不同的物种。当可交换的质子被严格替换为Zn和Ga时，H-ZSM-5获得了高烯烃选择性。OZn2+O位点上的CH活化可以通过路易斯碱辅助脱质子机制来描述，伴随路易斯碱位点转化为共轭布龙斯特酸位点。然而，OGa+位点通过氧化加成而不是质子位点中间体活化CH键。质子位点中间体增加了Zn交换的H-ZSM-5相对于Ga对应物的副反应倾向。OGa+的CH活化基本步骤揭示，金属中心的氧化还原循环是通过氧化加成机制催化CH活化所必需的。然而，在烷烃脱氢反应条件下，OZn2+O位点可以经历可逆的Zn2+/Zn氧化还原过程，增加了不希望的质子位点中间体的可用性。通过传统离子交换方法制备的Zn交换H-ZSM-5含有大量未交换的质子位点，导致催化剂的烯烃选择性降低。另一种增强烯烃选择性的策略是控制质子位点的强度。位点的酸性取决于沸石框架中三价阳离子的性质。硼硅酸盐沸石中的质子位点比铝硅酸盐弱，因此预计Zn/H[B]-ZSM-5在烷烃脱氢中的烯烃选择性高于Zn/H[Al]-ZSM-5。然而，Zn/H[B]-ZSM-5在丙烷脱氢中没有活性。Zn/H[B]-ZSM-5中所需较弱的质子位点酸性需要沸石框架中氧原子的较弱碱性。这种氧原子碱性的降低不足以补充交换的Zn2+在CH键断裂中的作用。消除沸石的质子位点对于获得高烯烃选择性和脱氢催化剂的稳定性至关重要。Pt是烷烃反应中最通用的贵金属催化剂，通常因其在这些反应中的较高活性、稳定性和选择性而被证明是合理的，与成本较低的替代过渡金属相比。然而，即使使用Pt基催化剂进行轻烷烃脱氢，由于焦炭形成导致的催化剂失活速度仍然很快。支持物上的酸（布龙斯特和路易斯）位点促进了烯烃的再吸附、寡聚化和芳构化。Pt与Sn、Ga、Zn、Re等金属的促进提高了催化剂的稳定性，但与Pt/Na[Fe]-ZSM-5相比，失活速度也更快。商业Cr和Pt基脱氢催化剂中钾的作用是最大限度地减少质子位点对烯烃选择性的不利影响。表面氧物种的性质和作用变得更加明显。Sn的电子促进效应与氧化加成CH活化机制一致。然而，路易斯碱辅助脱质子机制也可以解释在Cr基催化剂上提出的CH活化。最近的一份报告表明，一种多孔铜铝框架材料（由金属氧化物稳定）在丙烷脱氢中的性能（活性/选择性/稳定性）优于PtSn/Al2O3。可以在此处调用路易斯碱辅助脱质子机制，金属中心的氧化还原性质可能在实现350°C下的丙烷脱氢中发挥作用。这应该是非氧化脱氢较低烷烃的未来研究方向。", "Doi": "10.1016/j.fuproc.2016.04.016"},

site structures and dehydrogenation mechanisms are followed in the PDH process from a fundamental perspective.\n          In this section, the active sites, dehydrogenation pathways and deactivation mechanisms on Pt-based and representative metal oxide-based catalysts would be clarified.\n          The coordination saturated Pt atoms are more selective for propane dehydrogenation, while the coordinatively unsaturated Pt atoms will catalyze the side reactions, such as CC breaking and deep dehydrogenation, resulting in the formation of carbon deposits.\n          The adsorption configuration and strength of propylene can be both greatly perturbed by surface structures, coke formation is inherently governed by the surface geometric and electronic structures, and thus the construction of specific reaction ensembles is important.\n          Tuning the support's acidity and coke mobility can also inhibit the coke formation.\n          The effective strategies for inhibiting coke are summarized as follows.\n          Geometric separation: Previous research studies have shown that separating the active metal components could inhibit the structure-sensitive side reactions with improved propylene selectivity.\n          Electron richness: A high electron density of Pt particles is beneficial to weaken Pt(CC) bonds, inhibit coke precursors, and suppress deep

coke on acidic supports can also suppress the diffusion of reactive molecules.\n          Cofeeding streams: In addition to the modulation of catalyst structures and the properties of supports, changes in reaction conditions by cofeeding streams, such as H2, and CO2, can also have a positive effect on coke elimination.\n          Enhancing oxygen mobility: The oxidation of the adsorbed surface carbonaceous species can help eliminate the coke deposition over supported metals and thus is beneficial to the improvement of catalytic stability.\n          Coke transfer: In addition to

supports with high surface area and uniform pore size distribution are preferred.\n          Some alkaline metals, such as Li, Na, and K, can help poison the strong acid sites and avoid the coke deposition on the Al2O3 surface.\n          Additionally, doping Mg into Al2O3 forms a stable spinel phase.\n          An-Hui Lu and coworkers indicated that Al2O3 nanosheets with abundant penta-coordinate Al atoms have a strong metalsupport interaction owing to their capacity for anchoring Pt atoms, which accounts for their high stability.\n          Due to the weak interaction between

This crystal structure has a high concentration of weak Lewis acid sites (coordinatively unsaturated tetrahedral ones on the surface of the material), which are deemed to be centers of dehydrogenation activity.\n          The assignment of Lewis acid sites as the active species was substantiated by Chen et al., who, by relating the results of NH3-TPD measurements with activity data for different GaxAl10xO15 mixed oxides, showed that a high concentration of Lewis acid groups in the form of coordinatively unsaturated tetrahedral Ga3+ cations is a prerequisite for dehydrogenation activity.\n          Xu et al. reported dehydrogenation activity on both Lewis and Brnsted acid sites on GaO3/H-ZSM-5. A zeolitic support displaying a low concentration of medium and strong acid sites and a relatively high concentration of weak acid sites was found to lead to the most active and stable catalyst.\n          Michorczyk et al. concluded that acidic groups catalyze the reaction after observing that promotion with a base, such as potassium, resulted in a decrease in activity.\n          The structure of the support is also important, as a mesoporous GaAl mixed oxide exhibited an increased resistance to catalyst coking.\n          The function of K was to reduce coke formation by poisoning Brnsted acid sites.\n          Pt is believed to act as a promoter for the GaOx. Indeed, albeit 1000 ppm Pt/Al2O3 was found to be virtually inactive, 1000 ppm of Pt in combination with 3 wt % Ga afforded conversions close to the equilibrium and an propylene selectivity <95%.\n          The role of Pt is to assist hydrogen desorption, which facilitates the regeneration of the gallium hydride hydroxide species.\n          The exact nature of the active sites in Ga-based dehydrogenation catalysts is still under debate.\n          The chemistry of molybdenum oxide is comparable to that of vanadium oxide, as Mo can be present as MoOx monomers, polymers, or MoO3 crystallites, depending on the molybdenum loading, the type of support used, and catalyst preparation conditions.\n          The reducibility of the catalyst with hydrogen prior to reaction increases conversion, although selectivity decreases due to the formation of acid sites.\n          The chemistry of molybdenum oxide is comparable to that of vanadium oxide, as Mo can be present as MoOx monomers, polymers, or MoO3 crystallites, depending on the molybdenum loading, the type of support used, and catalyst preparation conditions.\n          The reducibility of the catalyst with hydrogen prior to reaction increases conversion, although selectivity decreases due to the formation of acid sites.\n          The chemistry of molybdenum oxide is comparable to that of vanadium oxide, as Mo can be present as MoOx monomers, polymers, or MoO3 crystallites, depending on the molybdenum loading, the type of support used, and catalyst preparation conditions.\n          The reducibility of the catalyst with hydrogen prior to reaction increases conversion, although selectivity decreases due to the formation of acid sites.\n          The chemistry of molybdenum oxide is comparable to that of vanadium oxide, as Mo can be present as MoOx monomers, polymers, or MoO3 crystallites, depending on the molybdenum loading, the type of support used, and catalyst preparation conditions.\n          The reducibility of the catalyst with hydrogen prior to reaction increases conversion, although selectivity decreases due to the formation of acid sites.\n          The chemistry of molybdenum oxide is comparable to that of vanadium oxide, as Mo can be present as MoOx monomers, polymers, or MoO3 crystallites, depending on the molybdenum loading, the type of support used, and catalyst preparation conditions.\n          The reducibility of the catalyst with hydrogen prior to reaction increases conversion, although selectivity decreases due to the formation of acid sites.\n          The chemistry of molybdenum oxide is comparable to that of vanadium oxide, as Mo can be present as MoOx monomers, polymers, or MoO3 crystallites, depending on the molybdenum loading, the type of support used, and catalyst preparation conditions.\n          The reducibility of the catalyst with hydrogen prior to reaction increases conversion, although selectivity decreases due to the formation of acid sites.\n          The chemistry of molybdenum oxide is comparable to that of vanadium oxide, as Mo can be present as MoOx monomers, polymers, or MoO3 crystallites, depending on the molybdenum loading, the type of support used, and catalyst preparation conditions.\n          The reducibility of the catalyst with hydrogen prior to reaction increases conversion, although selectivity decreases due to the formation of acid sites.\n          Alumina is by far the most common support, and a variety of methods to produce chromiaalumina catalysts have been investigated.\n          The nature of the support is important not only because it governs the mechanical properties of the catalyst, but also because the interaction of the carrier with the active phase can have a profound impact on catalyst activity and selectivity.\n          Albeit selectivity has been found to be insensitive to chromium loading, it does change over time.\n          The use of zirconia as an alternative support has also been investigated.\n          The use of silica as the support in chromia-based dehydrogenation catalysts requires a relative high surface area to stabilize Cr6+ sites.\n          CrMgAl and CrMg mixed oxides prepared using layered double hydroxide (LDH) precursors have been studied as catalysts for the nonoxidative dehydrogenation of ethane.\n          Finally, the study of porous chromia-pillared α-zirconium phosphate materials has been particularly informative with regards to the influence that acidity has on catalytic behavior.\n          The surface area-to-metal loading ratio determines which species will form. Indeed, Wu et al. reported that monomeric species are predominantly present below 1.2 V/nm2, polymeric vanadium species prevail between 1.2 and 4.4 V/nm2, and crystalline V2O5 species preponderate at even higher loadings.\n          On the one hand, the presence of hydroxyl groups on the surface of the support is important to obtain a well-dispersed catalyst, as OH groups serve as anchoring sites for the vanadium precursors used to prepare these catalysts. On the other hand, acid sites are detrimental for catalyst performance, because they facilitate cracking and induce coke formation.\n          Alumina is commonly used as a support for vanadium oxide catalysts, although Sokolov et al. concluded through testing a wide range of Si- and Al-based supports that using silica to dope the alumina support provides beneficial effects on catalyst stability and activity.\n          Furthermore, as was shown by Harlin et al., the performance of supported vanadium catalysts can be improved through the addition of MgO, either as a promoter or as a component of a mixed oxide. According to these workers, the increase in dehydrogenation selectivity stems from the basic nature of MgO, resulting in reduced coke formation.\n          The reducibility of the vanadium species depends on their molecular structure, VOV and VO bonds being more easily reduced than VO-support bonds.\n          Prior to reaction, the vanadium in these catalysts is generally present as V5+.

The interaction between the support and the active phase can also alter the electronic properties of the catalyst, which can further enhance its performance. Support modification strategies, such as doping with alkali metals or using mixed oxides, can optimize these properties for enhanced catalytic efficiency and selectivity.

For example, the surface area-to-metal loading ratio determines the formation of different vanadium species, which affects the catalytic activity. The reducibility of vanadium species also influences the catalytic performance. The addition of MgO can improve the selectivity of vanadium-based catalysts by reducing coke formation. Using silica to dope alumina support can enhance the stability and activity of vanadium oxide catalysts. The type of support and preparation conditions can affect the formation of molybdenum oxide species. Hydrogen reduction can increase conversion but decrease selectivity due to the formation of acid sites. The structure of the support, such as mesoporous GaAl mixed oxide, can increase the resistance to catalyst coking. Poisoning Brnsted acid sites with K can reduce coke formation. Alumina is the most common support, and various methods have been explored to produce chromia-alumina catalysts. The choice of support can also influence the stability and dispersion of the active phase, which in turn affects the catalytic efficiency and selectivity. For example, zirconia has been investigated as an alternative support due to its low surface acidity and enhanced sintering resistance, which can improve the performance of chromia-based catalysts. The acidity of the support can also play a role in catalytic behavior, as demonstrated by the study of porous chromia-pillared α-zirconium phosphate materials. Support modification strategies, such as doping with alkali metals or using mixed oxides, can optimize these properties for enhanced catalytic efficiency and selectivity. For instance, doping with alkali metals can stabilize the structure of the support, reduce surface acidity, and increase the number of active sites. Using mixed oxides can also improve the thermal stability and coking resistance of the catalysts. The surface area-to-metal loading ratio determines the formation of monomeric, polymeric, or crystalline vanadium species on the catalyst. Hydroxyl groups on the support surface are important for anchoring vanadium precursors, while acid sites are detrimental to catalyst performance. Silica doping of alumina support can improve catalyst stability and activity. Addition of MgO can improve dehydrogenation selectivity by reducing coke formation. The reducibility of vanadium species depends on their molecular structure. Molybdenum oxide can exist as monomers, polymers, or crystallites, depending on loading, support, and preparation conditions. Optimal molybdenum oxide activity is achieved with monolayer coverage on alumina. Hydrogen reduction of molybdenum oxide catalyst increases conversion but decreases selectivity. Ga2O3 polymorphs, particularly β-Ga2O3, have high concentration of weak Lewis acid sites for dehydrogenation activity. Coordinatively unsaturated tetrahedral Ga3+ cations are crucial for dehydrogenation activity. High concentration of Lewis acid groups in the form of Ga3+ cations is necessary for dehydrogenation activity. Zeolitic support with low medium and strong acid sites and high weak acid sites leads to most active and stable GaO3/H-ZSM-5 catalyst. Promotion with a base like potassium decreases activity, indicating acidic groups catalyze the reaction. Mesoporous GaAl mixed oxide has increased resistance to coking. Potassium reduces coke formation by poisoning Brnsted acid sites. Platinum acts as a promoter for GaOx, enhancing conversion and selectivity. Platinum assists hydrogen desorption, facilitating regeneration of gallium hydride hydroxide species. The nature of active sites in Ga-based dehydrogenation catalysts is still under debate. Molybdenum oxide can exist as monomers, polymers, or crystallites, depending on loading, support, and preparation conditions. Hydrogen reduction of catalyst increases conversion but decreases selectivity due to acid site formation. The physicochemical properties of catalysts, including chemical qualities and morphological characteristics, significantly influence their performance in dehydrogenation reactions. Alumina is the most common support, and its interaction with the active phase can profoundly impact catalyst activity and selectivity. Noble metals, particularly platinum, are preferred for their superior activation of paraffinic CH bonds and low activity for CC cleavage. The addition of alkaline metals like lithium, sodium, and potassium can poison acid sites on the support, suppressing coke formation. Zirconia is an alternative support that has been investigated, offering low surface acidity and enhanced sintering resistance. Silica requires a high surface area to stabilize Cr6+ sites. Mixed oxides prepared using layered double hydroxide precursors have also been studied for nonoxidative dehydrogenation reactions. The acidity of the support material, such as in chromia-pillared α-zirconium phosphate, can significantly affect catalytic behavior. The physicochemical properties of catalysts, including chemical qualities and morphological characteristics, significantly influence their performance in dehydrogenation reactions. The surface area-to-metal loading ratio determines the formation of different vanadium species, which affects the catalytic activity. The presence of hydroxyl groups on the support surface is crucial for anchoring vanadium precursors, while large V2O5 crystallites are inactive in dehydrogenation. The reducibility of vanadium species depends on their molecular structure, and the reduction of the catalyst by the hydrocarbon feed results in the formation of V4+ and V3+. Initially, deactivation is caused by the strong adsorption of reactants on the active sites and coke deposition. The calcination of the catalyst can remove coke but may further deactivate the catalyst due to the formation of larger V2O5 crystallites or mixed oxides. V2O5 crystallites can revert to active polymeric vanadium species under certain conditions. The addition of CO2 can have a beneficial effect on the catalyst by removing acid sites, facilitating coke gasification, and promoting hydrogen removal. The effect of CO2 depends on the catalyst support, with relatively weak basic sites on activated carbon support facilitating the reverse water gas shift reaction, while strong basic sites on Al2O3 and ZnO2 can be poisoned by CO2. Using silica to dope the alumina support can improve catalyst stability and activity. The addition of MgO can improve the performance of supported vanadium catalysts by reducing coke formation. The physicochemical properties of catalysts, including chemical qualities and morphological characteristics, significantly influence their performance in dehydrogenation reactions. The nature of the support is crucial as it not only determines the mechanical properties of the catalyst but also affects the interaction between the carrier and the active phase, which can profoundly impact catalyst activity and selectivity. For instance, alumina is the most common support, and the method of producing chromia-alumina catalysts can vary, affecting the catalyst's performance. The choice of support can also influence the catalytic activity, with different supports leading to varying orders of activity based on conversion and yield. Zirconia, as an alternative support, has been investigated for its low surface acidity and enhanced sintering resistance. Silica requires a high surface area to stabilize Cr6+ sites, and mixed oxides prepared using layered double hydroxide precursors have been studied for their catalytic properties in dehydrogenation reactions. The acidity of the support, as seen in chromia-pillared α-zirconium phosphate materials, can also influence catalytic behavior, with strong acid sites affecting cracking reactions and medium strength acid sites impacting dehydrogenation reactions. Support modification strategies can be employed to optimize the properties of catalysts for enhanced catalytic efficiency and selectivity. For example, doping alumina-based dehydrogenation catalysts with alkali ions can effectively poison undesirable acid sites, improving selectivity. Using zirconia as a support can prevent the formation of mixed oxides and offer higher thermal stability and surface area. Silica, with its high surface area, can stabilize Cr6+ sites, while mixed oxides prepared using layered double hydroxide precursors can provide improved coking resistance and thermal stability against sintering. Understanding the role of acidity in catalytic behavior can also guide the modification of supports to favor dehydrogenation reactions over cracking reactions. The physicochemical properties of catalysts, including chemical qualities and morphological characteristics, significantly influence their performance in dehydrogenation reactions. For instance, the nature of the support material, such as alumina, zirconia, or silica, can affect the dispersion and stability of the active phase, thereby impacting the catalytic activity and selectivity.

The stability and tolerance to carbon deposits of Zr-Al-Beta promoted by alkali-metal ions were demonstrated. The modification of alkali-metal ions on both Lewis acid sites and Brnsted acid sites in Zr-Al-Beta was evidenced by XPS and FT-IR spectroscopy. The untreated materials displayed poor product selectivity and high coke deposit in the Meerwein-Ponndorf-Verley reduction of furfural and isopropanol; however, the treatment of alkali-metal ions promoted their catalytic performance with improved recalcitrance to deactivation and coking significantly. The type of alkali-metal ions and the concentration of alkaline solution influenced the catalytic performance, which were found to correlate to the acidity and textual properties. The optimum reaction result (97.3% yield of furfuryl alcohol at 99.6% conversion of furfural) can be obtained on 0.025 M-Na+-Zr-Al-Beta with high tolerance to the furfural concentration. Support modification strategies can be employed to optimize these properties for enhanced catalytic efficiency and selectivity by tuning and normalizing the various acidic sites of zeolites. For instance, the post-synthetic method is demonstrated to be preferential to form open sites, which have stronger Lewis acidic properties than the closed sites. The simple post-synthetic strategy to prepare a Zr-Al-Beta zeolite with both plentiful Lewis acid open Zr (IV) sites and Brnsted acid sites has shown a superior catalytic activity, water-tolerance ability, and reusability in the cascade conversion of cinnamaldehyde toward 1-cinnamyl 2-propyl ether.
