In Situ Crystallization of the Active Composite Partners Hierarchically porous Zeolite composites can be prepared by partial crystallization of mesoporous molecular sieves such as MCM-41 in the presence of appropriate microporous structure-directing agents. The resultant zeolite composites are exactly zeolite nanocrystals supported on or embedded into an amorphous mesoporous matrix. The synthetic approach of partial crystallization of ordered mesoporous silicates was firstly reported by Jansen et al. (225) After the ion exchange with tetrapropyl ammonium cations (TPA+), hexagonally ordered mesoporous silica partially crystallized in glycerol medium to give the formation of mesoporous materials containing very small protozeolitic or tectosilicate structures within the mesopore walls. Huang et al. realized the crystallization of ZSM-5 nanocrystals within the mesopore walls of MCM-41. (226) A hexagonally ordered mesoporous silica MCM-41 was firstly self-assembled from the initial synthesis gel containing the mesopore template and conventional zeolite synthesis components. The resultant support containing microporous structure direct agent TPA+ was subsequently crystallized, and ZSM-5 nanocrystals were formed within the disordered hexagonal mesoporous materials.
Ex Situ Crystallization of the Active Composite Partners Hierarchically structured zeolite composites can also be prepared by first impregnation of mesoporous silicas (SBA-15) (433) or mesoporous cellular foams (MCFs) (227) with zeolite seeds and then hydrothermal treatment. Trong On and Kaliaguine used larger-pore and thick-walled SBA-15 instead of smaller-pore MCM-41 as the mesoporous support. (228,229) The composites were prepared by impregnating calcined SBA-15 into TPAOH with designed chemical composition and following hydrothermal synthesis. By this method, both SBA-15/ZSM-5 (228) and SBA-15/TS-1 (229) were obtained. Similarly, another mesoporous composite comprising zeolite ZSM-5 was also obtained by hydrothermal treatment of the TPAOH-impregnated aluminosilicate gel. (447) A similar procedure using mesostructured cellular silica foams allowed the synthesis of mesoporous composites containing zeolites ZSM-5 and Y with larger mesopores. (227) MCM-41 was also reported as mesoporous supports for the synthesis of zeolite Beta nanocrystals. (230)
2.1.1.2.2.2. Complete Crystallization of Active Composite Partners
As discussed above, a partial crystallization of active support yields a zeolite-containing composite material while a complete transformation of ordered mesoporous materials results in a purely crystalline zeolite phase. The crystallization of preformed meso- or microporous supports is an efficient method to prepare zeolitic monoliths with hierarchical porosity.
Ideally, a hierarchically porous catalyst should possess both macropores and mesopores of uniform pore size within the macropore walls which in turn need to be constructed from tunable microporous zeolite units. To achieve this, a complete crystallization of bimodally porous preforms containing mesopores and macropores has been proven to be an efficient strategy to fabricate hierarchically macro-meso-microporous structure in all-zeolite materials. The major challenge is to preserve the macro-mesoporous hierarchy in the preformed supports during the zeolitization process. Therefore, a careful process control or a pore-protected synthesis should be made to yield high-quality zeolites with three-level porosity. Attempts were made previously to transform the amorphous silica skeleton into a crystalline zeolite system through the dry-gel conversion process. The starting porous hierarchy can be well preserved through a vapor atmosphere but not in solution. In this way, zeolite Silicalite-1 with hierarchical porosity can be produced by transforming the skeleton of porous silica into Silicalite-1 crystals. (231) The micropores were from Silicalite-1, and the mesopores and macropores were formed within macroporous silica gel. The same approach was followed to prepare hierarchically meso-macroporous ZSM-5 (108,232,233) and Beta (240) zeolite monoliths, which exhibited a higher catalytic performance in the cracking of large molecules than conventional microporous materials. Sachse et al. developed a pseudomorphic route to transform a macro-mesoporous silica monolith into zeolite composites, while maintaining its complete crack-free morphology allowing its use as a flow-through microreactor. (233) Based on the similar route, an amorphous silicoaluminophosphate monolith was crystallized into a hierarchically macro-meso-microporous zeolite SAPO-34, (236) in which the macropores arose from the interconnected spheres by aggregated zeolite SAPO-34 nanocrystals, and the mesopores were constructed by aggregated zeolite SAPO-34 nanocrystals. Besides, a seed-induced layer-by-layer synthesis method (239) or a vapor phase hydrothermal transformation (238) was also used to synthesize differently shaped binderless zeolite monoliths with interconnected macro-micropores. A pore-protection synthesis was proposed by Tong et al., in which carbon as a solid template was used to preserve the pore channels of the starting silica monolith as a whole without any structure collapse during the zeolitization transformation process. (241) A novel glycerol-assisted quasi-solid-state crystallization (QSSC) method was developed by Chen et al. to fabricate a series of highly stable and reusable large zeolite blocks with a hierarchically interconnected three-level micro-meso-macroporous structure. (234,235,237,242,243) Meso-macroporous materials (aluminosilicates, titanosilicates, zirconosilicates, aluminosilicophosphates, etc., ...) with amorphous architectures and well-defined macrochannels and very uniform interconnected interparticle mesopores were used as precursor materials. (448,449)Figure 15A displays the schematic representation of the synthesis of hierarchically micro-meso-macroporous zeolite TS-1 as an representative example by this glycerol-assisted quasi-solid-state crystallization (QSSC) process. (237) First, the starting titanosilicates with amorphous architecture were synthesized via a spontaneous self-formation procedure on the basis of the chemistry of metal alkoxides (450459) without any external templates. A droplet of Ti alkoxides and alkoxyl silanes with a defined molar ratio was simultaneously added into aqueous solution. The high-speed hydrolysis and condensation of two alkoxides lead immediately to the formation of a large number of titanosilicate nanocolloids which aggregated together to give a gel structure in the droplet as found in a solgel process. Water and alcohol molecules quickly released from high-speed hydrolysis and condensation will generate macrochannels as microporous porogens. Simultaneously, the self-assembly of nanocolloids of titanosilicates gave rise to the formation of well-organized and very uniform mesoporosity. (450459) These meso-macroporous titanosilicate preforms present thus well-defined macrochannels and interconnected mesopores. The amorphous hierarchical titanosilicate preforms after drying were first impregnated with the TPAOH (SDA) solution, then filled completely with glycerol liquid, and finally gradually transformed into a crystalline material with the zeolite TS-1 framework. The macropore channeled structure was preserved owing to the presence of glycerol liquid in the macrochannels. Furthermore, the crystallization rate was largely reduced due to the quasi-solid-state nature of the amorphous hierarchical titanosilicate preform. The slow crystallization rate allowed the preservation of initial hierarchical mesoporosity and well-organized microchannel arrays. Consequently, the hierarchical micro-, meso-, macro-pore systems obtained were homogeneously distributed throughout the final large zeolite blocks. The hierarchically micro-meso-macroporous zeolite TS-1 materials presented a well-organized macroscopic network with uniform straight channel-shaped macropores, arranged parallel to each other inherited from titanosilicate preforms (Figure 15B). The macropore walls were constructed entirely from uniform zeolite nanocrystals in a size of 150 nm with high crystallinity (Figure 15C), resulting in uniform interparticle mesopores in the products. Furthermore, the synthesis of micro-meso-macroporous materials with a whole zeolitic architecture by using this novel glycerol-assisted quasi-solid-state crystallization (QSSC) process is not limited to the synthesis of only hierarchically micro-meso-macroporous TS-1 zeolite but has been extended to the synthesis of micro-meso-macroporous zeolites with different crystalline frameworks, such as zeolite ZSM-5 (Figure 15D,E), (234) Beta (Figure 15F), (235) and Zr-Silicalite-1 (Figure 15G). (242) It is envisioned that this synthetic process can be further extended to synthesize a large variety of zeolite and zeotype frameworks such as SAPO, AlPO, Y, and X with highly organized and interconnected hierarchical micro-meso-macroporosity.

In conclusion, many templating routes were attempted to introduce meso- or macropores into zeolites during the past decades, and they can generally be divided into either direct templating or indirect templating routes. Different synthesis methods result in qualitatively different meso- or macroporosity, such as the amount, location (intra- or intercrystalline), size distribution, and interconnectivity of the additional pores. In addition, different routes have quite different effects on the intrinsic microporosity, crystallinity, acid-site strength, and distribution of the zeolites. Efforts should be made to achieve the optimal balance between the introduced mesoporosity and the intrinsic microporosity, thus realizing the better catalytic performances in zeolites.
2.1.2. Nontemplating Route
Hierarchically porous zeolites can also be prepared without the employment of secondary hard or soft templates. Several methods including engineering of intergrowth, (173,244251) additive-assisted crystallization, (173,218,252262) seed-induced synthesis, (263274,463465) a controlled crystallization process, (275289,466,467) and designing special structure-directing agents (290292) have been reported for the synthesis of hierarchically porous zeolites in the absence of organic templates.
2.1.2.1. Engineering of Intergrowth
Hierarchical materials with interconnected micropores and mesopores have been prepared by branching of zeolite nanosheets by repetitive twinning or other intergrowth processes. The method is applicable to all zeolite structures that can either grow anisotropically as thin layers or support branching at certain acute angles. Zhang et al. reported a mesoporogen-free approach for the synthesis of hierarchically structured zeolite by a repetitive branching mechanism on the basis of the correlation between the presence of structural twins and layerlike crystal growth. (249) The morphology modifying agents were tetrabutylphosphonium and tetrabutylammonium ions, which induced the formation of small amounts of the twin structure MEL as the MFI-type nanosheet branching points. They found that, in an environment that favors the epitaxial intergrowth of two structures with different levels of symmetry, the higher-symmetry structure (MEL) acts as a link to connect the lower-symmetry structures (MFI) to create branching. The regular and repeated intergrowth of these two zeolite frameworks induced mesopores into zeolites, and the mesopore sizes were decided by the frequency of branching (Figure 16A). (250,468) The resultant self-pillared pentasil (SPP) zeolite consisting of orthogonally connected single-unit-cell thick MFI nanosheets was obtained from the intergrowth of two different zeolite frameworks (Figure 16B,C). (573) In a similar strategy, hierarchically structured zeolites were synthesized by sequential intergrowth during a hydrothermal synthesis using solely (C3H7)3N+(CH2)5N+(C3H7)3 (diquat-C5) (Figure 16D). (251) The resultant single-crystalline hierarchical MFI zeolites had additional mesopores within the zeolite plates and macropores from the intergrown structure (Figure 16E,F). The organic structure-directing agent (OSDA) used in this method for the formation of the microporous zeolite framework was slightly different from the tetrapropylammonium cation. In particular, these OSDAs favored the generation of ultrathin plates with perpendicularly rotational intergrowth, resulting in the formation of the hierarchically porous structure. The synthesis of hierarchical zeolite formed by the intergrowth of two zeolite crystal structures has been explored in other systems, such as FAU/EMT, (173) EMT/FAU, (244) ETS-4/ETS-10, (245) CAN/SOD, (246) MFI, (247) and CHA. (248) However, only the SPP morphology has been reported to contain zeolite nanosheets of single-unit-cell thickness. (249) Figure 16 Figure 16.

2.1.2.2. Additive-Assisted Crystallization
In most cases, additives, such as growth inhibitor agents, (218,252,256258) polyanion nucleation promoter, (253,259,260) and growth modifying agents, (173,254,255,261,262,469,470) were used to control the crystallization process during the hydrothermal crystallization to obtain well-developed mesopores in microporous zeolites.
The growth inhibitor agents, such as amino or ethanol, were reported for the formation of nanozeolite aggregates. Zhang et al. developed a facile amino-acid-assisted strategy for constructing hierarchically nanosized ZSM-5 with a single-crystalline structure, defect-free frameworks, and abundant interconnected interparticle mesopores (Figure 17A). (252) It was achieved by using l-lysine molecules to control both the oriented aggregation of protozeolite nanoparticles formed at low temperature and the intraparticle ripening process at high temperature.

The role of small l-lysine molecules was studied and is essential since they not only inhibited the crystal growth but also facilitated the oriented aggregation of protozeolite nanoparticles in a noncompact manner. For the l-lysine-assisted crystallization, small l-lysine molecules play thus two very important roles. On one hand, a small amount of l-lysine solely acted as a crystal growth inhibitor to produce nanosized zeolite single crystals, while for excess l-lysine, l-lysine molecules induced the aggregation of protozeolitic nanoparticles in an oriented way at low temperature in a noncompact manner. This is particularly applicable for the targeted modified synthesis that results in reduced zeolite crystalline size. Besides, the high-temperature intraparticle ripening resulted in the formation of defect-free hierarchical nanozeolites with abundant interconnected interparticle mesopores (Figure 17BD). Ni et al. prepared hierarchical zeolite 4A microspheres in a simple ethanolwater mixed solvent system without any templates or structure-directing agents. (256) Adding ethanol into the conventional hydrothermal synthesis could change the physical properties of the synthesis system, such as alkalinity and viscosity, which could further affect the interactions among various species in the mixture and finally lead to products with a different structure and morphology. The presence of ethanol could hinder the overgrowth of zeolites crystals and slow down the crystallization process, which favors the self-assembly of zeolite nanocrystals and their subsequent deposition on the primarily formed crystals to build hierarchical spheres. (257) Similar phenomena were observed in the synthesis of hierarchically mesoporous zeolites by a hydrothermal route using hexadecyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) as mesoporogens. (218,258) Protocols consisting of multiple reaction steps have been developed for the synthesis of mesoporous nanozeolite aggregates starting from highly diluted clear solutions. (259) A polyanion nucleation promoter (H2PO4) was first reported by Kumar et al. (260) The presence of ionic species with greater polarizing ability enhances the process of crystallization significantly by accelerating the condensation process. (260) By adding H2PO4, Fang et al. realized the in situ assembly of MFI zeolite nanocrystals into a mesoporous aggregate with single-crystal-like morphology without a secondary mesopore template. (253) Organic additives, such as 3-(trimethoxysilyl) propyl octadecyldimethylammonium chloride (TPOAC) (254) and low-cost N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP), (262) are able to direct the formation of zeolite nanosheets. Figure 18A illustrates the rotational intergrowth of hierarchical FAU/EMT zeolites. (254) The EMT zeolite nucleated close to the edge of sheet 1 on (111) and (111) faces followed by branching to generate sheet 2. Further growth results in the formation of interpenetrated sheets with a hierarchically open house-of-cards arrangement (Figure 18B). (254) The EMT domains within the sheets were further confirmed by the electron diffraction pattern (Figure 18C,D). Low-cost N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP) was also reported as an additive in the synthesis system to direct a special hierarchical structure in zeolites. (262) The resultant ZSM-5 sample presented a regular house-of-cards-like morphology, which consisted of some orthogonal sheets.

Simple inorganic salts like Zn(NO3)2 and Li2CO3 instead of organic molecules can be used as morphology modifiers to generate FAU-type zeolite nanosheets. (173,254) The added Zn2+ ions conducted to the formation of a pronounced layerlike zeolite morphology with a cuboctahedral layer arrangement very similar to the layered morphology of NaX obtained from the synthesis with TPHAC. (255) The presence of Li2CO3 also resulted in the formation of well-defined cuboctahedral nanosheet assemblies but with particularly pronounced hexagonal (111) plates in a more skeleton-like arrangement.
Besides, growth modifying agents were also applied in the formation of layered zeolite crystals. These agents can be selectively adsorbed on certain crystal faces and change their growth rate, (261) leading to intercrystalline mesoporosity (hierarchically porous zeolites) or spanning meso- and/or macropores between the layers (aggregates of layered crystals).
2.1.2.3. Seed-Induced Synthesis
Seed-induced crystallization of zeolites in the absence of organic templates has already been realized in the synthesis of several important zeolites such as ZSM-5 (MFI), (263265) TS-1(MFI), (471) Beta (BEA), (266268,472) RUB-13 (RTH), (269) ZSM-12 (MTW), (270,271) RUB-50 (LEV), (268,272) and heulandite (HEU). (268) In this synthesis strategy, seed crystals of the target zeolite are synthesized using the conventional method with an SDA, and then, a small amount of the as-synthesized zeolite seeds are added to the organic template-free reactant gel to form the desired zeolite phase. The added zeolite seed crystals increase the nucleation and crystallization rate and enhance the quality of the desired zeolite phase by improving the crystallization. (463465) Hierarchical SSZ-13 microspheres, with abundant mesoporous channels, have been successfully synthesized by adding calcined SSZ-13 zeolite crystals in the starting gel without organic templates. (273) This strategy not only remarkably reduced the production cost and environmental pollution but also significantly decreased the crystallization time and reduced the zeolite crystal sizes. High concentrations of zeolite nuclei accelerated the growth and assembly of nanozeolites into easily filterable, stable aggregates. Nada et al. reported the synthesis of nanocrystalline ZSM-5 with a high quality and yield by using a small amount of seeds and a short synthesis time. (274) The addition of preprepared zeolite seeds or seed gels into the zeolite reaction gels can promote the nucleation of the desired phase and suppress side products, resulting in a significant decrease of crystallization times and the reduction of the SDA concentration. The effect of seed size, synthesis temperature, synthesis time, pH, amount of seeds and aging time was systematically investigated. However, the reproducibility is highly dependent on the quality of the preformed zeolite seeds or gels. (274)
2.1.2.4. Controlled Crystallization Process
For the synthesis of hierarchically porous nanozeolite aggregates, the synthetic environment should favor zeolite nucleation rather than crystal growth. Typical synthesis strategies are the conventional hydrothermal treatment and dry-gel conversion process.
2.1.2.4.1. Conventional Hydrothermal Treatment
The nontemplate approach requires critical control over both the zeolite nucleation and growth process. By precisely controlling the kinetics of zeolite nucleation and growth, hierarchically coreshell structured MFI zeolite single crystals were obtained (Figure 19A). The zeolite precursor was first aged at low temperature (T1) for a period (t1) and then heated at higher temperature (T2) for another period (t2), (275) resulting in hierarchically structured zeolites with nonporous core and a hyperbranched shell (Figure 19B,C). (275) Aluminum-zoning was the determinant of the branching epitaxial growth behavior, leading to the generation of a porous shell. Most of the Al-related acid sites were exposed on the shell and were greatly accessible. (275) It was reported that Al facilitated the nucleation and slowed down the growth rate of MFI zeolite during the hydrothermal synthesis. (276) For example, hierarchical ZSM-5 with various morphologies and crystal sizes can be obtained by changing the synthesis conditions, such as the concentration (277) of the precursor solution, or the sequence of preparing aluminate and silicate mixtures. (278) Sodium-rich Na2OAl2O3SiO2H2O precursor suspensions were also favorable for the organotemplate-free synthesis of ultrasmall hexagonal EMT zeolite nanocrystals (615 nm in size) at very low temperature (30 C). (279) Figure 19 Figure 19. (A) Mechanistic illustration of the hierarchically porous zeolite structure formation. (B) SEM and (C) TEM images of the zeolite 3/0.2/10/100020 C (2d)120 C (1d).

Submicron-sized hierarchically mesoporous ZSM-5 spherical particles, constructed by a thin intergrown zeolite shell and a micro-mesoporous core formed by the aggregation of 3050 nm MFI zeolite nanocrystals, were synthesized by regulating the nucleation and the growth of zeolites. (281) Such a unique hierarchical structure led to a wide interparticle mesopore-size distribution (315 nm) and created more mesopore volume. The resultant submicrometer spherical catalysts show significant improved mass transport and superior catalytic performance for the self-etherification of benzyl alcohol. A similar morphology was also reported for ZSM-5. (282) On the contrary, a mesoporous shell of uniformly arranged ZSM-5 nanocrystals and a microporous rod with a crystalline ZSM-5 core were synthesized by controlling silica/alumina ratios using conventional hydrothermal treatment under stirring, without any extra additives or pre-/post-treatments. (283) The key to obtain high mesoporosity in the crystals was the stirring of a synthesis mixture containing a relatively high concentration of alumina. Gaber et al. prepared faujasite sheets with a house-of-card assembled skeleton from inorganic sodium aluminosilicate sols simply by utilizing the gel memory effect of zeolite sols. (284) The memory meant that the hydrogels in zeolite synthesis were not found to substantially change the distribution of nuclei in the amorphous matrix, and the final crystal size was unaffected by the treatment. (284) The hierarchical morphology was optimized by suitable starting and final compositions, leading to the house-of-card assembly of the faujasite sheet (HCF) morphology with a narrow mesopore-size distribution.
2.1.2.4.2. Dry-Gel Conversion Process
The concentration of the zeolite synthesis gels greatly influences the final morphologies of the product. (473476) The concentrated reaction mixtures resulted in the generation of mesoporous aggregates of Beta zeolite nanocrystals, while the diluted ones led to isolated zeolite nanocrystals. (259) Thus, the dry-gel conversion process, with a highly concentrated zeolite precursor for promoting nucleation, was found to be a useful way to construct a hierarchical structure aggregated by zeolite nanocrystals. By this method, amorphous mesoporous silica TUD-1 was successfully transformed into zeolite ZSM-5 nanocrystals. (285) Bein et al. reported that mesoporous zeolite Beta nanocrystals were obtained with nearly 100% yield rapidly without templates. (287) Using mesoporous or colloidal silicas together with tetraethylammonium hydroxide (TEAOH) via a dry-gel conversion process resulted in assembled nanozeolites (20 nm) with intercrystalline mesopores of about 13 nm. Using this method, the Si/Al ratios in zeolite Beta can be tuned from 10 to 30. The synthesis parameters in this dry-gel conversion process should be carefully controlled, such as the drying temperature of the zeolite synthesis precursor, the induction period, and the humidity level, to ensure a high crystallinity and abundant mesoporosity. To simplify this method, Mller et al. used highly concentrated gels in a hydrothermal treatment to accelerate the zeolite nucleation and crystallization (Figure 20). (289) Dense zeolite precursor gels, containing aluminum sulfate as the potential nucleation promoter, were crystallized in a short time, resulting in highly mesoporous zeolite Beta aggregates. Besides, the mesopore size was controllable by tuning the crystalline time. With increased time, zeolite crystals continuously condensed into larger domains, thus generating larger intercrystalline mesopores. Hollow spheres with a 1020 nm thick shell of Silicalite-1 nanocrystals were prepared by a simple self-aggregation process of nanocrystals without any templates. (286) They first prepared Silicalite-1 nanocrystals via dry-gel conversion, and later these nanocrystals produced hollow spheres with a shell of fused nanocrystals under ultrasound. Although silicalite hollow spheres can be obtained by this simple aggregation process of nanocrystals, the organization phenomenon observed in the sonication of the nanocrystals needs to be further studied. Bein et al. converted an alkali-containing dense precursor gel to hierarchical zeolite Beta utilizing the steam-assisted conversion method. (287) The individual and uniform zeolite Beta nanoparticles were first formed and then condensed into a mesoporous network, resulting in hierarchical self-sustaining macroscopic zeolite aggregates assembled from Beta zeolite nanocrystals. The dry-gel conversion method was also applied to the synthesis of hierarchical Beta zeolites, (287,288) ZSM-5, (253) and TS-1 (467) with similar morphologies. This dry-gel conversion process provided excellent mesoporosity, although it was difficult to scale up.

2.1.2.5. Special Structure-Directing Agents
Almost all the reports reviewed above used a traditional structure-directing agent (SDA) to direct the zeolitic structure. Uncommon cyclic diammonium templates, such as 3,10-diazoniabicyclo[10.2.2] hexadeca-12,14,15-triene-3,3,10,10-tetramethyl-dichloride, can effectively direct the formation to the BEA zeolite framework in a highly concentrated Na+ system (Figure 21). (290) The pseudomorphic crystallization of mesoporous gel resulted in the formation of zeolite BEA nanocrystals containing abundant intercrystalline mesopores. The mesopores were formed due to the strong affinity between the positively charged cyclic diammonium templates and negatively charged silicate species and the effective structure-directing ability of cyclic diammonium templates toward the zeolite BEA framework. This synthesis method is further expanded to other cyclic diammonium compounds that can direct the formation of BEA, MTW, and MFI zeolite nanocrystals. (291) Rigid cyclic diammonium compounds containing phenyl or biphenyl bridges can effectively direct zeolite frameworks containing 12-membered pore channels, such as BEA and MTW, while a cyclic diammonium compound connected with two flexible hexamethylene linkages formed MFI zeolite with a 10-membered pore channel. With the cyclic diammonium compounds, BEA, MTW, and MFI zeolites were formed with tunable Si/Al ratios.

Cost-efficient alternative templates with a rigid cyclic geometry, such as piperidine- or imidazole-based dicationic ionic liquids, were also reported in the synthesis of aggregates of zeolite Beta nanocrystals. (292) Rajkumar et al. prepared a variety of geminal dicationic ionic liquids and investigated their potential in the synthesis of zeolites. In their study, several piperidine- and imidazole-based geminal dicationic ionic liquids were prepared. It was concluded that only the chair conformation rather than the boat conformation in the piperidine-based reagents is favorable for directing zeolite Beta nanocrystals. Besides, only if the two imidazoles in imidazole-based templates generate a certain angle, interparticle mesopores can be created in zeolite Beta aggregates. (292) Though great achievements have been realized in the nontemplating route for hierarchically porous zeolites during the past several decades, there still exist many challenges in the synthesis process. For example, this approach typically involves precise control over the crystallization process of zeolite synthesis protocols. No generalized approach has been achieved for many available zeolite structures. More efforts should be made to obtain a detailed insight into this synthesis route and to make significant technological developments.
As noted above, most of the research to date has focused on in situ approaches to produce hierarchically porous zeolites. These methods are worthwhile as they can yield solids with exceptional features. However, their further practical applications might be limited for the high cost of appropriate hard or soft templates. Additionally, the key point for the success of the in situ approach is the optimized interactions between the templates and the silicate or aluminosilicate species in the zeolite synthesis gels. Therefore, to efficiently mix the zeolite gel and the templates, elaborate synthesis steps are required. Besides, efforts should be made to achieve the optimal balance between the introduced mesoporosity and the intrinsic microporosity and the best control of the amount, location, size distribution, and interconnectivity of the additional pores. The template removal by combustion is a crucial step to obtain high-quality hierarchically porous zeolites, which requires careful consideration especially for large-scale industrial production. Therefore, the development of effective syntheses using low-cost template materials together with efficient and environmentally friendly synthetic strategies allows for the wide application of these template-based syntheses of hierarchically porous zeolites in the industries. As for the nontemplating method, hierarchically porous zeolites are produced without a mesopore or macropore template but instead from specially designed synthesis procedures. Most of these methods are not applicable for industrial synthesis due to their high costs and complicated synthesis routes.
2.2. Postsynthesis Approach
In contrast to the synthesis strategies discussed above, additional porosity can also be created within zeolites by postsynthesis treatment of zeolite crystals that leads to the formation of secondary meso-macropores. (477485) Generally, the postsynthesis treatments of previously formed zeolites consist of demetalation (extraction of framework atoms) or delamination, which are realized by steam, (293310) acid, (311,486494) base, (312340,495509) or fluoride treatments (341,510512) or more refined approaches such as swelling, (345348) exfoliating, (342,349) or interlayer pillaring with amorphous silica. (350352) The postsynthetic treatment is largely used in industry and the main source for the great success in the commercialization and application of zeolites in general, yielding superior properties of catalysts and adsorbents with high stability, designed composition, and desired acid site speciation. (353) The most important advantage of the postsynthetic approach is its simplicity and low cost while the disadvantages of this approach include the requirement of very harsh conditions leading to environmental pollution, defects in zeolites, partial collapse of the zeolite structure, and low control on the selective and precise extraction.
2.2.1. Demetalation
Generally, the demetalation route involves the treatment of a conventional, purely microporous zeolite by selective chemical extraction of one constituent, a metallic or semimetallic component, from the pristine zeolite framework. The typical conditions required to selectively extract some elements from zeolite crystals are quite harsh. Thus, the extracting process usually involves the usage of strong acids or bases, (311341,486512) or steam, (293310) in which the steaming or acid leaching is for aluminum extraction, and the alkaline or fluoride leaching is for silicon removal. (354) Recently, detitanation was also reported as a means to introduce intracrystalline mesoporosity in titanosilicate materials. (355357)
2.2.1.1. Steaming
Steaming treatment is the most widely used dealumination method invented in the mid-1960s. (293) In a typical approach, zeolite crystals are treated in a water vapor atmosphere at high temperature (>500 C). Under such conditions, the mobility of aluminum and silicon species is enhanced. The aluminum is finally extracted from the zeolite framework, leaving behind vacancies (hydroxyl nest) or partial amorphization of the framework. Some vacancies can be filled by free silicon species from the amorphous part while others grow to generate mesopores (Figure 22). (294297) The spherical or cylindrical mesopores (pore size of 1020 nm) created by dealumination are either isolated or connected. (298) However, their pore shapes are always uncontrollable. (299) Both the steaming temperature and time are decisive factors for the extraction of aluminum and the generation of mesopores. (300) This removed Al neutralizes the lattice charges, stabilizes the skeleton Al atoms, and prevents further dealumination. (301) Therefore, the amount of the extracted aluminum atoms has a limit in a single steaming cycle. (302) Figure 22 Figure 22. Schematic representation of the formation of mesopores in a steaming dealumination process. Reprinted with permission from ref (412). Copyright 2014 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.
In addition, the removal of aluminum and the migration of silicon lead to an increased framework Si/Al ratio and the formation of mesopores. However, the overall Si/Al ratio of dealuminated zeolites remains almost unchanged since the micropores and mesopores within the zeolites are partly covered by the debris from the amorphous part and the extraframework aluminum species. Mild acids, like diluted nitric acid or organic oxalic acid, can also be used to dissolve these extraframework species. Such a mild acid leaching process will not generate more mesopores. The complete extraction of the amorphous alumina residues finally creates intracrystalline mesopores with wide size distributions. For example, Lohse et al. reported a mesoporous structure (pore size of 10 nm) in zeolite Y formed by a steam treatment. (303) However, the residues of amorphous aluminosilicate fragments within the created mesopores seriously blocked these mesopores, which can be further removed with HCl treatment. After this acid leaching, the mesopore size increased to 20 nm. (303) Besides, the framework dealumination can stabilize the pristine Y zeolites (FAU topology), since their high framework Al content results in an unstable protonic form, providing zeolites with a larger mesopore volume and a higher Si/Al ratio. The repeated steaming and acid leaching to remove the extraframework species can provide zeolites with a larger mesopore volume and a higher Si/Al ratio. This treatment has been largely used for the production of ultrastable zeolite Y (USY), which is the main component of the fluid cracking catalysts used in crude oil transformation. (304) The dealumination of the framework can also increase (hydro)thermal stability. (305) Nevertheless, most mesopores formed by steam treatment are intracrystalline without good accessibility and thus do not significantly improve the mass transfer of bulky molecules. (307) Some mechanisms in the steam dealumination process still remain unexplained, (308) almost 50 years after their discovery. (309) The main disadvantage of steaming is that the additional porosity is generated at the sacrifice of framework Al atoms and the crystallinity. The relatively severe treatment causes amorphization of the partial zeolite framework, which decreases crystallinity and partially blocks the active sites. Another disadvantage is that the quantity and strength of the acidic sites are modified by the aluminum removal compared with the pristine zeolite. Besides, the amount and distribution of Al atoms in the zeolite framework are decisive of the quantity, the volume, the distribution, and the interconnectivity of the secondary mesopores. (310) Despite these drawbacks, the steaming treatment is still largely used to create additional porosity, adjust Si/Al ratio, and increase (hydro)thermal stability of zeolites.
2.2.1.2. Chemical Leaching
The chemical leaching as a largely spread post-treatment resulting in dealumination or desilication procedures, which correspond to the selective removal of framework aluminum or silicon atoms, respectively, from the zeolite structure, is an effective method to generate secondary intracrystalline mesopores. Based on sacrificing part of the zeolite frameworks, these leaching processes generate amorphous regions within the crystalline zeolites, and mesopores are formed after the extraction of the amorphous debris. In this section, we present a review of dealumination via acid leaching and desilication methods for the construction of hierarchically porous zeolites.
2.2.1.2.1. Acid Leaching
Acid leaching was first introduced by Barrer and Makki. Mineral acids are used to remove aluminum from clinoptilolite. (486) The acid leaching method can preferentially extract framework aluminum from a microporous zeolite to directly create mesopores within the crystals. Defect sites are formed through hydrolysis and breaking of the SiOAl bonds, thus leading to the formation of SiO defects and leaving extraframework alumina species behind. Mineral or organic acids with different acid strength such as nitric, sulfuric, or hydrochloric acids and acetic, oxalic, and tartaric acids were used at different concentrations. The effectiveness of this technique depends on the nature of the zeolite and acids used. For example, purely microporous mordenite, Beta, and ZSM-5 zeolites were partially dealuminated in HCl medium in an autoclave under microwave irradiation at 373 K for 15 min. Depending on the crystalline framework structure, Si/Al ratio, and acid leaching conditions, zeolite Beta was much easier to dealuminate than zeolite mordenite, while zeolite ZSM-5 was nearly unaffected. (487,488) The nature of the acid is a decisive factor for the final mesopore structure. For example, zeolite mordenite leached by oxalic acid had a much higher bulk Si/Al ratio but fewer mesopores than the one by nitric acid, owing to the higher pH of the oxalic acid solution and in particular the ability of the oxalate ions to coordinate with the aluminum ions. (487) Recently, Sun et al. reported the preparation of hierarchical SAPO-34 with a butterfly-shaped pore system by hydrothermal synthesis followed by an acid post-treatment. (311) They demonstrated the influence of different acids on the synergic effect of the multipores and acidic sites. The SAPO-34 treated with nitric acid or oxalic acid exhibits multipores including micropores, mesopores (4050 nm), and macropores (62500 nm). However, hierarchical SAPO-34 cannot be obtained by treating SAPO-34 with butanedioic acid. It was also found that acidic treatment could optimize the number of acidic sites of SAPO-34. The main disadvantage of acid leaching is the decreased number of acid sites leading to the increased framework Si/Al ratio and acid strength. (489) The creation of mesopores by acid leaching is always accompanied by the changes in number and strength of acid sites, making it complicated to separately study their influences on the catalytic performance. Besides, for the high-silicon-rich zeolites, the low amount of aluminum distributed in the entire framework will hardly be removed to generate a notable mesoporosity, since too few defect sites can be generated. (490492) For example, it is difficult to induce the mesoporosity in ZSM-5 zeolites by a dealumination process, due to the low amount of framework aluminum that can be extracted. As for the low-silica zeolites (Si/Al < 2.5), dealumination leads to partial structure collapse. (493,494) Moreover, the introduced mesopores are isolated, and the selective dealumination process cannot create an interconnected mesopore system. A pulsed field gradient (PFG) NMR was applied to study intracrystalline diffusion in a dealuminated Al-rich Y zeolite and indicated that the mesoporosity generated by such acid leaching did not enhance the diffusion of large molecules. (306)
2.2.1.2.1.1. Alkaline Leaching
Alkaline leaching or desilication refers to the selective extraction of silicon from the zeolite framework in alkaline medium. (326331) Contrary to the difficulty for the acid leaching to extract Al atoms with zeolites of high Si/Al ratio, the alkaline desilication is a promising approach suitable for zeolite with high Si/Al ratio to prepare hierarchically porous zeolites due to its applicability as a postsynthesis treatment of purely microporous zeolites of high Si/Al ratios. (332) The most extensive investigations concerned with the influence of treatment parameters on the mesopore formation have been made for zeolite ZSM-5. (333) The Si/Al ratio was effectively expanded from about 10 to 1, and the mesoporosity was generated in ZSM-5 by desilication. (312314) Besides, its effectiveness has also been demonstrated for other zeolite framework structures, including MTW, (315) MOR, (316) BEA, (317) AST, (318) FER, (319) MWW, (320) IFR, (321) STF, (322) CHA, (323) FAU, (324) and TON. (325) When an alkaline treatment is applied, silicon atoms are selectively extracted from the zeolite framework, while aluminum species accumulate on the external surface, playing an important role in pore direction. (313,495) Other trivalent heteroatoms in lattice positions, such as Fe3+, Ga3+, and B3+, were also reported as the pore-directing agent. (496) Several routes were reported to control the desilication process within the optimal range of Si/Al ratios, such as partial detemplationdesilication, (497) microwave irradiation, (498) and the use of alternative bases (499,500) or pore-growth moderators. (13) Moreover, by combining alkaline with steam (501) or acid (495) treatments, the mesopore formation was accompanied by acidity modification.
Contrary to the acid leaching to extract Al species, the mesopores created by desilication are mostly interconnected and highly accessible from the external surface of zeolites, resulting in improved performances in diffusion-controlled reactions. (312) Based on the hydrolysis of SiOSi and SiOAl bonds in an alkaline environment, the mesopores are first generated on either the outer surface or the defect areas within the crystalline structure. (327,330,502) The hydroxide anions (OH) would react with the silanol groups (defect sites) within the zeolite framework. The extracted silicate anions are stabilized by the alkali cation, resulting in voids within the framework. The Na+ ion is the best silicon atom leaching agent for its superior capability to stabilize silicate anions. (491) The alkaline leaching for enhanced adsorptive capacity and improved catalytic activity was first reported by Young. (334) Mao et al. further systematically studied the desilication methods. (335) They used sodium carbonate as the leaching agent to selectively extract silicon atoms within the zeolite frameworks. To realize the control over the desilication process, sodium hydroxide was added to adjust the pH. (336,337) Ogura et al. reported that the alkali treatment with NaOH created mesoporosity in zeolites, leading to enhanced diffusion properties and improved catalytic properties. (338,339) Further works by Groen et al. (327,340) reported that the introduced uniform mesopores have a broad pore-size distribution around 10 nm. (340) The external surface increased from 40 to 130 m2 g1 in the treated samples after the introduction of mesoporosity, but it was at the cost of microporosity.Ciziek et al. (503) found a possible relationship between the framework Al within the zeolite and the desilication possibility. Repulsion between the negative AlO4 tetrahedra and OH was found to prevent the hydrolysis of SiOAl bonds rather than the hydrolysis of SiOSi bonds, and hence, Al would slow down the dissolution rate. However, these only concerned unselective dissolution of zeolites but not the mesopore formation. Groen et al. systematically studied the role of Al on the controlled formation of mesoporosity in zeolites. (327,332,340,501) A framework Si/Al ratio of 2550 was reported to be optimal for the controlled desilication of the zeolites ZSM-5, (327) mordenite, (316) and ZSM-12. (315) At lower Si/Al ratios, high Al concentrations (Si/Al < 25) prevented the silicon dissolution and limited the mesopore formation, whereas too high silicon zeolites with Si/Al > 50 showed random and too much Si dissolution, resulting in extensive mesopore generation and serious crystallinity loss (Figure 23). (327) The nonuniform concentration of Al in zeolites would affect the Si removal within the zeolites. Large zeolite ZSM-5 crystals (510 μm), with an Al-rich external surface, (504,505) dissolved nonuniformly when treated with alkaline solution. (331) Based on these studies, Groen et al. reported the influence of aluminum gradients and the crystalline size of the zeolites to control the mesopore formation. (328) By the use of the Al gradients in ZSM-5 crystals, they realized the construction of hollow structured zeolites with an Al-rich shell. (328) Besides, the stability of framework Al within the zeolite is also decisive to the created mesoporosity. (14) For zeolite Beta, the alkaline leaching dissolves the framework without keeping the Brnsted acid sites. (317) The poor stability of framework Al within zeolites SSZ-13 is also problematic for their desilication treatment. (323) Figure 23 Figure 23. Schematic representation of the influence of Al content on the desilication of MFI zeolites in NaOH solution and the associated pore-formation mechanism. Adapted with permission from ref (327). Copyright 2004 American Chemical Society.In addition to mesopore formation, desilication also impacts the composition and aluminum distribution, which are key properties intimately related to the catalytic performance. (312) Zeolites treated by an alkaline solution usually present a decreased bulk Si/Al ratio, micropore volume, and crystallinity while presenting an increased amount of Lewis acid sites. (314,325,506509) Understanding the individual effects of the additional porosity and chemical composition of desilicated zeolites on their catalytic performance is thus highly relevant for their optimal design. It was reported that the variation both in chemical composition and in porosity induced by alkaline treatment significantly influences the catalytic performance of desilicated ZSM-5 in the liquid-phase alkylation of toluene with benzyl alcohol. (501) Thus, an optimal alkaline treatment is beneficial for preservation of the Al environment and the related acidic properties. (327)
2.2.1.2.2. Fluoride Leaching
Hydrofluoric acid (HF) is often used to partially etch or completely dissolve silicon-containing materials. Valtchev et al. reported the first fluoride leaching, combining a physical and chemical treatment, for generating a controlled secondary pore. (341) The high-energy (238) U ion bombardment was used prior to the fluoride treatment to form amorphous parts in the zeolites which were then selectively removed by HF. (341) The selective removal is based on the more rapid etching rates of the amorphous versus the crystalline regions, leading to the formation of macropores through the entire crystalline structure. The obtained material showed higher catalytic activity and stable product selectivity in the conversion of m-xylene to para- and ortho-isomers. Figure 24 shows the pristine and the corresponding macroporous zeolites. The treated zeolite exhibited both similar crystallinity and similar Si/Al ratio but a negligible increased external surface as compared with the pristine zeolites. The method allows changing both the amount and size of the introduced pores. Besides, no additional framework species were found. A study of the dissolution of ZSM-5 in HF with different concentrations reported that a diluted solution was Al-selective. (510) The selectivity in concentrated HF solution was greatly reduced due to the large presence of difluoride ions (HF2) having higher activity which can unselectively remove Si and Al atoms from the framework. The resultant hierarchical ZSM-5 zeolite had similar compositions to the parent ZSM-5. Lately, similar results were obtained with concentrated NH4F solution, where the release of NH3 produced HF2. (511) Recently, Qin et al. developed a new method based on etching zeolites with NH4F. (512) Small amounts of HF2 were in situ generated by the double hydrolysis of NH4F and then used to extract framework Si and Al atoms. (512) The etching species were homogeneously distributed inside the crystals. The dissolution kinetics can be controlled by both the concentration and the temperature of the etching solution.

In contrast to steaming or acid or alkaline leaching, this nonselective treatment using NH4F solution (removing Al and Si equally) has important advantages in the preparation of hierarchical materials with additional porosity. This treatment can be applied to zeolite with Si/Al ratios close to 1. Another important advantage is the increased number of Brnsted sites due to the preferential dissolution of defect zones and/or some nonzeolitic material present in the parent zeolites. The stress in these zones and the presence of surface hydroxyls make the defects more vulnerable for chemical etching.
In conclusion, this novel fluoride leaching route using NH4F solution to hierarchical zeolites with additional porosity is very promising. The method is universal and independent of either the composition or the structure of the parent zeolites. Moreover, the resulting hierarchical zeolites have a similar composition to their parents, which is quite different from the steaming or acid or alkaline leaching routes. Zeolite catalysts and adsorbents can now be modified more rationally by postsynthesis treatments.
2.2.2. Delamination
Contrary to the intracrystalline meso- or macropores created by the demetalation approach, delamination results in the formation of intercrystalline meso- or macropores in zeolites. After reducing the individual crystallite size from the micrometer scale to the nanometer scale in the third dimension, hierarchically porous zeolites aggregated by nanolayers are obtained. (358) The interactions between the layers in these hierarchically porous zeolites are relatively weak (van der Waals interaction, hydrogen bonds, and electrostatic interaction). After the removal of the template, precursors in the hierarchically porous zeolites with a layered structure are usually condensed. (359) To solve this problem, the structures or compositions of these precursor are postmodified by swelling, (345348) exfoliating, (342,349) or interlayer pillaring with amorphous silica. (350352) The swelling of lamellar precursors with surfactant molecules is usually the foundation for other postmodifications. For example, in a typical delamination process, the 2D zeolite precursor is first treated in alkaline solutions to expand the interlayer void assisted with surfactants. The obtained materials usually exhibit a high degree of intercrystalline (interlamellar) mesoporosity (Figure 25). (345) The initial swelling procedure is achieved in a high concentration of hydroxide (OH) and surfactant with high temperature, which could reduce the desilication and structure degradation. (346) Tsapatsis et al. (360) proposed a milder condition to swell the lamellar precursor at room temperature to protect the layer structure. Then, Zones et al. reported a new swelling mixture containing F and Cl ions to swell the lamellar precursor in nearly neutral conditions, leading to increased active sites when compared with leaching in highly alkaline solution. (361) The hierarchically porous zeolite with a delaminated structure and intercrystalline porosity was obtained after the ultrasound treatment of the swollen precursor [MCM-22(P), PREFER, and Nu-6(1)] to form 2D-zeolites (ITQ-2, ITQ-6, and ITQ-18), respectively. (342) Figure 25 Figure 25. Schematic representation of the introduction of intercrystalline (interlamellar) mesoporosity in the layered zeolite precursor by the delamination and pillaring of an MCM-22 precursor (MCM-22(P)) via an intermediate swelling step yielding ITQ-2 and MCM-36, respectively.

An alternative pillaring step is applied to introduce or to retain the preformed porosity in hierarchically porous zeolites with a layered structure. Typically, pillaring can be achieved by intercalating surfactant molecules into the interlamellar space to expand the interlamellar distance. (362) This approach includes the impregnation of the surfactant chains with a soluble material in the interlamellar space and the following hydrolyzation in an aqueous solution. Finally, hierarchically porous zeolites with stable interlamellar mesopores (expanded interlayer space) are obtained after calcination. (158) The interlayer pillaring with amorphous silica could maintain the large interlayer space, which would disappear upon the calcination of the swollen precursor. (352) Wu et al. developed a versatile method by the interlayer silylation of the precursors with specially chosen silanes to obtain the interlayer expand zeolites (IEZs), (343,344) which resulted in hierarchically porous zeolites with stable interlamellar mesopores and high crystallinity. An additional stabilization of these zeolite sheets is made through pillaring, and the mesoporous voids created by the surfactant tails are retained even after calcination. (158) The delamination approach leads to the exposure of a larger fraction of the highly acidic zeolite surface for adsorption and catalysis. However, the delamination approach is especially suitable only for a small range of zeolites. The biggest challenges of the delamination process are the high surfactant content and the alkalinity used for swelling leading to partial dissolution of the zeolite framework.
2.2.3. Recrystallization
The recrystallization approach involving zeolite dissolution and reassembly was first reported by Goto et al. in 2002 (513) and later by Ivanova et al. in 2004. (364) The first dissolution step is the partial dissolution of a zeolite framework and the removal of zeolite fragments, while the second reassembling process is to make these dissolving species form a mesoporous phase.
The dissolution degree is decisive for structural and textural properties of the recrystallized products. Various types of micro-mesoporous zeolites are obtained by tuning the corresponding recrystallization degree (Figure 26), (514516) including coated mesoporous or mesostructured zeolite crystals (RZEO-1) formed by mild recrystallization with intracrystalline and intercrystalline mesopores; (364372,380,517) micro-mesoporous nanocomposites (RZEO-2) containing cocrystallized zeolites crystals and ordered mesoporous phases obtained by deeper recrystallization; (364372,513,518,519) and mesoporous materials containing small zeolitic units (RZEO-3) synthesized by full recrystallization. (364378) Figure 26 Figure 26. Schematic representation of the recrystallization procedure that leads to different types of materials. Reprinted with permission from ref (520).

Surfactants are widely used in the recrystallization process to introduce additional porosity into zeolites. (379) The surfactant-templated recrystallization processes are divided into two different methods. The first synthesis is the one-step approach using surfactant templates with alkaline leaching to synthesize intracrystalline mesoporous zeolite single crystals. Based on the use of a dilute NH4OH solution, Garcia-Martinez and co-workers (379381) first introduced a surfactant-assisted route to create mesopores within zeolites. Surfactants, such as CTAB, can direct well-controlled mesopores within different zeolite frameworks (Y, mordenite, ZSM-5). For example, zeolite USY (CBV720 with a Si/Al ratio of 15) was first treated by steaming and then immersed into a solution of CTAB in 0.37 M NH4OH solution (or 0.09 M tetramethylammonium hydroxide solution, TMAOH). The surfactants removal results in the generation of uniformly distributed intracrystalline mesopores. (380) The second approach is the two-step approach consisting of partial-to-total dissolution of the zeolite in NaOH solution and the subsequent hydrothermal treatment with surfactants, such as cetyltrimethylammonium bromide or chloride (CTAB or CTAC). The introduction of well-controlled mesoporosity into zeolite crystals is based on a crystal-rearrangement theory (Figure 27A). (380) Only when the SiOSi bonds were opened by a cationic surfactant in base condition and transformed into negatively charged SiO species can the structural reorganization be realized. This approach allowed the necessary interactions between the surfactant and the zeolite and avoided the dissolution of the crystals. Almost full retrieval was achieved during this mesostructuring process. SEM images (Figure 27B) indicate that the crystalline morphology remained almost unchanged. The copresence of both additional mesopores and high crystallinity within the zeolite edges is confirmed in the TEM images (Figure 27B). Besides, these intracrystalline mesopores lead to a significantly high hydrothermal stability. (380) This method successfully avoided excess silica loss or crystallinity loss of the zeolites and is applicable to various Si/Al ratio zeolites from a high Si/Al ratio (USY, mordenite, ZSM-5) to low Si/Al ratio (NaY and NaA), (363) by a pretreatment approach with a weak organic or inorganic acid.

In conclusion, the recrystallization route contains the primary desilication/depolymerization process and the secondary reassembling process. The former has been applied to various zeolite types with high Si/Al ratios while the latter has few reports. The synthesis can be easily controlled by changing the alkalinity during the desilication step and various mesoporosities can be introduced into the materials. However, mesoporosity is introduced into the zeolites at the expense of microporosity in the recrystallization route. This calls for further study of the depolymerization/reassembling approach for its wider use in zeolites with low Si/Al ratios. Finally, the range of the organic surfactants for the reassembling step should be widened in order to enhance the variety of the final hierarchically porous zeolites.
As noted above, most postsynthetic approaches including steaming and acid or alkaline leaching have been used to synthesize hierarchically porous zeolites for decades due to their simplicity, scalability, and low cost. In these methods, most of the created mesopores are isolated cavities in the crystals and thus cannot significantly contribute to accelerating the mass transport. For example, the desilication has poor capabilities to tailor the mesoporosity and is seriously restricted by the relevant Si/Al ratio, leaching temperature, and leaching time. Dealumination decreases the number of acid sites with the Al-extraction from the framework. Accordingly, more efforts should be directed toward the controlled postsynthetic treatment, thus widening the applicability of this treatment. The postsynthesis of hierarchical zeolites with high structural stability and the design of such multimodal porous zeolitic materials with a better understanding of the cooperation between different pore systems still remain great challenges.
3. Hierarchical Structure
As discussed in section 2, a wide variety of strategies, such as in situ and postsyntheses, have been so far developed for generating additional pores, either inter- or intracrystalline or even a combination of both. The diffusion of molecules depending on the size and shape of pores plays a central role in the performance of zeolites. Figure 28 demonstrates the effect of pore size on the diffusion of molecules with varying dimensions. The configurational diffusion of these tightly fitting molecules into the micropores of zeolites is often the rate-limiting step of a catalytic reaction, and the molecular diffusivity is much smaller than that in larger mesopores or macropores.

For the simplest example of a diffusion limitation imposed by a uniform pore framework, the relative molecular uptake and release obey the following equation (521,522) (1) where R is the radius of the sample assumed to be a sphere, and DT is the intraparticle transport.
In the limiting cases of process control by intraparticle diffusion and surface permeation (surface-barrier control (523)), the respective moments (time constants of molecular uptake, release, or exchange) are (2) (3) where DT is the intraparticle transport diffusivity, α is the permeability through the particle surface (surface barrier), and R is the radius of the particle assumed to be a sphere.
For purely microporous zeolites, DT in eq 1 refers to the micropore diffusivity Dmicro.
Equation 1 is also applicable for the microporous zeolites with additional (meso- and/or macroporous) transport pores when the exchange between the micropores and the transport pores is sufficiently rapid. In this case, DT refers to effective diffusivity DTeff (4) (5) where Dmeso and Dmacro stand for the meso- and macropore diffusivity (with the first-order estimate as given by eqs 67) estimated by the Knudsen relation (521,524,525) (6) (7) where d is the mean pore diameter, R is the gas constant, and M is the molar mass. The tortuosity factor τ considers the extension of the diffusion pathways by the pore space tortuosity and is typically of the order of 24. (521,526528) pmeso and pmacro are the relative amount of molecules in the transport (meso- and macro-) pores and can be estimated as (529) (8) (9) where c is the guest concentration (in moles per unit mass), p is the gas pressure, and R is the universal gas constant. Vmeso, Vmacro, and Vmicro stand for the specific (per sample weight) total volumes of mesopores, macropores, and micropores.
With eq 2, the introduced transport pores into purely microporous zeolites will improve the mass transport under the fast-exchange conditions by enhancing the diffusivity DT (eqs 4 and 5).
Therefore, mass transport in hierarchically porous materials is highly dependent on the rate of mass exchange between these pore spaces. It is determined by the permeability of the interface between these spaces and by the hierarchy factor (13) defined as (Vmicro/Vtotal) × (Smeso/Stotal(BET)), where the mesopore surface area represents the interface between mesopore and micropores. Increasing hierarchy factors are known to result in increasing catalytic performance. (13,412) As discussed above, the interconnected hierarchy between the transport pores (meso- or macropores) and the micropores allows for the accelerated intracrystalline diffusion.
As a consequence, the spatial arrangement of the introduced larger pores is of key importance. The introduction of two or three levels of porosities in microporous zeolites with the interconnected hierarchy offers an effective solution to achieve a faster mass transfer in the zeolite framework, in which the macropores provide an unimpeded transport path, and the mesopores provide a fast pathway for mass transportation and enhanced micropore accessibility, thus preventing the further conversion of reactants into undesirable side products (coke precursors) and thereby extending catalyst lifetime.
Table 1 summarizes the different strategies employed for different zeolites and structures with hierarchical porosity. Different geometries with isolated voids imbedded in the zeolites and open pore channels through the whole zeolite crystal are obtained according to the in situ or postsynthesis approaches, thus leading to notably different mass transfer patterns. It is still a great challenge to achieve an optimized porous hierarchy within zeolites. (384,530533) To take full advantage of hierarchically porous structure in a catalytic reaction, it is important to maximize the interconnectivity among pores of multilevels. Thus, the fabrication of hierarchically porous zeolites needs an elaborated design that aims both at creating abundant meso- and/or macropores and at guaranteeing their interconnectivity within the microporous structure without compromising intrinsic properties of zeolites. Generally, hierarchically structured porous zeolites are divided into three groups based on the additional pore size, namely, micro-mesoporous zeolites (containing micropores and mesopores), micro-macroporous zeolites (containing micropores and macropores), and micro-meso-macroporous zeolites (containing micropores, mesopores, and macropores). This section presents some concrete examples on how to select and how to combine different preparation strategies described above in section 2 to fabricate each type of hierarchically structured zeolites.
3.1. Micro-Mesoporous Structured Zeolites
Extending the catalytic applications of the microporous zeolites to bulky organic molecules has long been a driving force for study aimed at mesoporous zeolites. Mesoporous zeolites combine the advantages of both the inherent crystalline structure of the microporous zeolite and an additional connected or disconnected, ordered or disordered, inter- or intracrystalline mesopore system. The introduced mesopores result in the exposure of a larger fraction of the highly acidic zeolite surface, thus making more pore openings accessible to the bulky reactants and further improving the already highly valued catalytic capabilities of microporous zeolites. The synthesis of mesoporous zeolites can be achieved either by introducing an additional pore system into zeolite single crystals, either during the crystallization process of the zeolite crystal or in an already synthesized microporous zeolite (intracrystalline mesopore, Figure 29A), or by a purposeful aggregation of individual zeolite nanocrystals or nanosheets (intercrystalline mesopore, Figure 29C,E).

3.1.1. Disordered Micro-Mesoporous Structured Zeolites
Many different strategies exist for tailoring the mesopore structure within zeolites to meet specific goals. The diversity of available approaches is discussed in section 2. Among them, the in situ templating synthesis is currently the most widely used method because of its versatility. The templating method is based on the addition of mesopore-scale hard and soft templates or supports into the synthesis mixture of microporous zeolites. The amount, size, distribution, and interconnectivity of the secondary porosity created in the microporous zeolites are directly related to the space occupied by the templates. This method can be applied to different zeolite structures with high yields and is especially suitable for preparing mesoporous zeolites with high zeolitic character and a large amount of introduced mesopores. However, the main drawback of this method is the difficulty of scaling-up due to the fact that the templates must be removed either by calcination (for organic templates) or by dissolution (for inorganic templates) under severe conditions after the crystallization process. For example, the high temperature during the calcination process can cause a strong damage of the zeolite crystalline structure.
The postsynthetic selective extraction of specific framework constituents (Al atoms or Si atoms) of the presynthesized microporous zeolite is another direct approach to prepare mesoporous zeolites. Obviously, these postsynthetic methods are not limited to the microporous zeolite systems to form mesoporous zeolite crystal but are also applied to introduce an additional mesoporosity in already mesoporous zeolite. These procedures are indeed destructive processes to scarify part of the as-synthesized zeolite crystals for creating larger mesopores. Thus, the main drawback of these methods is the dissolution and the great loss of the zeolite mass (up to 40% weight). The high-temperature steaming (534) and acid leaching techniques for removal of Al-atoms are widely used for zeolite Y, (535) mordenite, Beta, and ferrierite. The resultant mesoporous zeolites always exhibit low pore interconnectivity, disordered intracrystalline mesopore structure, and partial collapse of the microporous structure due to the relative uncontrollability of the treatments. For example, the steam-created mesopores in ultrastable Y (USY) are mainly isolated rather than interconnected and, hence, could not improve the diffusion of large molecules. (306) In addition, dealumination usually leads to an obvious change in Si/Al ratio and thus the acidity of the zeolites. Alternatively, desilication is more appropriate for creating an interconnected mesopore system. Basic media is used for the postsynthetic treatment to preferentially remove the framework silica atom from a given zeolite framework. This approach has been applied successfully to many zeolite topologies, such as MFI, (339) MTW, (315) MOR, (316) BEA, (317) AST, (318) FER, (319) MWW, (320) IFR, (321) STF, (322) CHA, (323) FAU, (324,536,537) TON, (325) and TUN. (538) However, its effectiveness strongly depends on the Si/Al ratio of the original zeolites. The presence of a high concentration of negatively charged AlO4 tetrahedra tends to stabilize the Si species, preventing its extraction from the framework. Contrarily, the silica-rich zeolites suffer from uncontrolled and excessive silicon atom extraction, resulting in wide pore-size distributions and extremely low yields. Besides, the desilication process usually leads to deposition of partial Al species on the external surface of zeolites and thus negatively affects the catalytic performance. (539) Another type of mesoporous zeolite is the aggregate of zeolite nanocrystals/nanosheets. These aggregates are ideal candidates to facilitate mass transport based on their interconnected secondary pore system, large external surface areas, and short intraparticle diffusion pathways (Figure 29C,D). (157,540) Hierarchically porous zeolites aggregated by nanocrystals can be prepared by the assembly and condensation of zeolite nanocrystals around surfactant micelles. This includes the use of common templates under specific synthesis conditions that favor nanozeolite growth. Seed-induced synthesis, multiple-step pretreatment, additive-assisted crystallization, and a controlled crystalline process are often used. The use of uncommon structure-directing agents, such as cyclic or linear diamino- or diamine structure-directing agents, under a common synthesis condition, or the self-assembly is also an applicable method to form larger and mechanically stable aggregates avoiding using a mesopore template. Hierarchically porous zeolites aggregated by nanosheets can be obtained by postsynthesis (Figure 29E,F), such as swelling, (346348) exfoliating, (342,349) or interlayer pillaring with amorphous silica, (350352) or in situ synthesis, such as soft template synthesis which was successfully applied to the synthesis of layered aluminosilicates (157,158) and aluminophosphates. (161) These intercrystalline mesopores are unstable and can be easily destroyed when treated under high stress. It is still a great challenge to improve the structural stability of the zeolite nanocrystal aggregates.
3.1.2. Ordered Micro-Mesoporous Structured Zeolites
All of the aforementioned mesopores are often disordered in hierarchically porous zeolites. Generally, an interconnected and three-dimensionally ordered mesopore system is introduced into zeolites during the crystallization process. Additionally, the precise control over the ordered mesoporous structure in these zeolites is difficult to achieve. In this subsection, we select the strategies and methods to realize pore interconnectivity (ordered mesopores).
The most straightforward technique for constructing an ordered mesoporous structure within zeolites is the replication in ordered porous structures produced by templated synthesis using colloidal assemblies. The general idea for these replications is to partially or fully replicate the preformed sacrificial templates which direct the final structures. Additionally, morphological characteristics of the mesopores can be precisely controlled. The diameter of the mesopores in 3DOM/m materials can be tuned by altering the size of the original colloidal spheres. For example, Tsapatsis and his co-workers prepared microporous zeolites with ordered mesoporosity by using three-dimensionally ordered mesoporous (3DOm) carbons with a face-centered-cubic structure as hard templates (Figure 30A). (48,49) The confined growth of Silicalite-1 zeolite crystals in these templates afforded 3DOm-imprinted single-crystal zeolite particles, which showed a network particulate structure consisting of primary nanoparticles (about 10, 20, or 40 nm in diameter) (Figure 30B). A wide range of crystal morphologies can be imprinted into zeolite crystals by replication of size-tunable mesoporous carbon templates. (48) Moreover, this novel method can be applied to synthesize not only the aforementioned Silicalite-1 zeolite but also many other types of zeolites, like BEA, LTA, FAU, and LTL. (49) Collectively, the 3DOm structure endows zeolites with a highly ordered pore system and thus promises a fluent mass transport ability, which is useful in various applications like catalysis, sensing, and adsorptionseparation.

The soft templating method is another conventional and general method for the synthesis of ordered micro-mesoporous structured zeolites. The diameter of the mesopores can be tuned by changing the surfactant. Additionally, the pores can be aligned perpendicular or parallel to the surface of the spheres. For instance, Ryoo and his co-workers prepared a functionalized surfactant and used it as a structure-directing agent (SDA) to synthesize zeolite MFI nanosheets with a thickness of 2 nm by the hydrothermal method. (158) The surfactant tails outside these obtained zeolite nanosheets direct their further aggregation into an ordered mesoporous multilamellar structure. Moreover, the diameter of interlayer mesopores can be controlled by tuning the surfactant tail length. Notably, the mesopores between zeolite nanosheets can be preserved by using silica pillars, even after surfactant removal (Figure 30C). In addition, it was observed that some paralleled zeolite nanosheets have single-unit-cell (Figure 30D). The pillared zeolite with a hierarchically ordered mesoporous structure possessed many advantageous features, like an ordered micro-mesoporous structure, large surface area, abundant pore volume, highly accessible acid sites, and tunable interlayer mesopores. (158) The hierarchically ordered meso-microporous zeolites will offer a short diffusion path during catalytic reactions, especially when large molecules are involved.
As a result of the numerous templating approaches that have been developed in past decade, researchers now hold in hand a vast choice of synthesis methods to construct micro-macroporous structured zeolites. More importantly, the in situ approach including hard and soft templating methods can produce ordered micro-mesoporous zeolite materials, which are very hardly obtained with postsynthesis methods. These ordered micro-mesoporous zeolites have the maximized connectivity between pores of various levels and can fully realize the benefits of hierarchy in catalytic reactions.
3.2. Micro-Macroporous Structured Zeolites
Macroporous zeolites constitute another important category of hierarchically porous zeolites. The introduction of a macroporous structure into a microporous zeolite results in a reduced diffusion path, accelerated mass transfer, and increased coke resistance in catalytic reactions. Many efforts have been devoted to synthesize macroporous zeolites. Various morphologies, such as hollow spheres (Figure 31A), (101) fibers, (145) and boxes (Figure 31B); (541) macroporous zeolite single crystals (Figure 31C); (120) and three-dimensional (3D) hierarchically macrostructured monoliths, were obtained.

The in situ templating method is an effective method to synthesize macroporous zeolites. Polymer spheres (97,99,430) or silica spheres (111,114,115) and other special materials, such as hydrothermally pretreated carbon black microspheres, (542) hydrothermally pretreated micron-sized carbon fibers, (543547) the fly ash cenosphere, (124) silica-containing vegetal cells, (137) and CaCO3, (548) are widely used to template hollow macroporous structures in the zeolites. The final morphologies of the hollow structure in macroporous structured zeolites can be easily controlled by changing the initial template morphologies. (118) For example, most of the methods for preparing macroporous zeolite with a hollow sphere structure are based on a layer-by-layer assembly technology. This includes the first alternative deposition of oppositely charged zeolite nanoparticles and polyelectrolytes onto the polymer spheres (97,99,430) or silica spheres (111,114,115) to form a coreshell composite followed by the removal of the template core to fabricate a hollow structure. Macroporous zeolites with a hollow fiber structure are synthesized by incorporating bacterial supercellular threads into the as-synthesized silicalite nanoparticles. (145) The self-assembly of the uniform spherical templates mentioned above can also be used to fabricate zeolite monoliths with closed or interconnected macropores. (112,113,117) Indirect templating involving both the inert support and the active support can also be used to synthesize macroporous zeolite monoliths. Inert supports are divided into permanent inorganic supports and sacrificial supports. In a typical synthesis, the microporous supports are immersed into the zeolite precursor solution, and then, the mixture is crystallized via a conventional one-step hydrothermal method. The synthesized zeolite nanocrystals are either loaded onto or coated onto the surface of these supports after impregnating the supports into the zeolite precursor solution. Different micro-macroporous zeolite monoliths are prepared by choosing various inert supports, such as diatoms, (430) porous Al2O3 beads/extrudes, (549) silicon oxycarbide (SiOC) ceramic foams, (223,550) ZrO2/Y2O3, (421) cordierite honeycomb, (551) and stainless steel. (422) Sacrificial supports, including natural templates (bacterial supercellular threads, (145) starch gels, (147) wood cells, (139,141) egg membranes (131)) and artificial templates (polyurethane foam, PUF (106)), are also used to prepare hierarchically micro-macroporous zeolite monoliths. The resultant materials exhibit a diverse hierarchical structure but a relatively low mechanical stability. To further improve the mechanical stability, macroporous supports containing the initial nutrients for the zeolite growth, such as active silica or alumina, are used. (135,434439,441443) After the complete or partial crystallizations, binder-free hierarchically porous zeolites or partly zeolite materials with hierarchical macroporous supports are obtained. Thus, the resultant macroporous zeolites exhibit a high mechanical stability owing to the strong interaction between zeolite nanocrystals or zeolite coatings and supports.
Mesoporous silica spheres (120) and other templates, such as nanosized CaCO3, (121) can also be used as hard templates to introduce intracrystalline macropores in zeolites. For example, the MFI-type zeolite single crystal with a classical morphology and well-interconnected intracrystalline macropores can be prepared using mesoporous silica spheres as both a silica nutrient and a sacrificial macropore porogen. Intracrystalline macropores that are connected to the crystal external surface are formed after the crystallization process by the sacrifice of silica particles (Figure 31E,F). (120) The in situ nontemplating route can also be used to prepare macroporous zeolites with a hollow sphere structure. For example, Silicalite-1 zeolite nanocrystals with a size less than 30 nm are self-assembled to form hollow spheres with a diameter of 100300 nm after sonication in an ammoniaethanol solution. (286) The postsynthesis desilication process is also an efficient methodology to construct hollow micro-macroporous zeolite architectures. For example, macroporous zeolite with a hollow microbox structure are prepared by treating the high-quality ZSM-5 zeolite single crystal in a mildly alkaline Na2CO3 solution, avoiding the excessive destruction of ZSM-5 zeolite crystals (Figure 31C,D). (541) Besides, the postsynthetic recrystallization approach is also developed for the preparation of macroporous zeolite TS-1 (552) and microporous zeolite ZSM-5 (553) with hollow structures.
3.3. Micro-Meso-Macroporous Structured Zeolites
Most reported hierarchically porous zeolites contain either mesopores or macropores. However, hierarchically porous structured catalysts with both mesopores and macropores are more desirable in catalytic applications. Nowadays, it is still highly challenging to simultaneously create both mesopores and macropores within zeolites. Until now, only a few micro-meso-macroporous zeolites with pores at three length scales are reported.
The in situ direct template method can be used to obtain hollow SAPO-34 zeolite nanocrystals with intracrystalline meso-macropores. The catalysts are prepared via the seed-assisted crystallization using triethylamine as the sole structure-directing agent. The samples exhibited a hollow structure with mesopores and macropores throughout the entire crystals. (554) The in situ indirect templating route is usually used for the synthesis of meso-macroporous zeolites. For example, a complete zeolitization of bimodally porous silica monoliths with a hierarchically meso-macroporous structure is an effective method to prepare various hierarchical zeolites with micro-meso-macroporous structures. For example, hierarchically porous Silicalite-1, (231) ZSM-5, (108) and Beta (240) zeolite monoliths are obtained by the transformation of the bimodally porous silica skeleton through a steam-assisted conversion. Thus, the sodalite (233) and SAPO-34 (236) zeolite monoliths with a hierarchical pore can be prepared by a pseudomorphic transformation of the meso-macroporous silica monolith (233) or a dry-gel conversion of amorphous silico aluminophosphate. (236) The connectivity between the various levels of pores in hierarchical zeolites is the key to maximize the benefits of hierarchy in catalytic reactions. An ideal hierarchically porous catalyst should contain well-defined macropores, interconnected and uniform mesopores within the macropore walls, and tunable microporous zeolite units. To realize this, a novel glycerol-assisted quasi-solid-state crystallization (QSSC) process was used to synthesize hierarchically micro-meso-macroporous zeolites. (237) All pores were introduced throughout the entire product to give highly interconnected macrochannels with uniform mesopores and micropores (Figure 32AC). By using this method, a series of hierarchically micro-meso-macroporous zeolites have been synthesized. (234,235,237,242) Figure 32 Figure 32. (A) Left: schematic representations of hierarchically micro-meso-macroporous zeolites synthesized via a quasi-solid-state crystallization approach.

Hierarchically micro-meso-macroporous MFI-type zeolites, with a coreshell architecture composed of a nonporous core and an epitaxially grown hyperbranched shell full of mesopores and macropores, were prepared by an in situ nontemplating two-step controlled crystallization process. (275) The first step was synthesized at low temperatures (2080 C), and most precursors hydrolyzed and condensed to obtain precrystallized clusters, which further aggregated in an oriented order at medium temperatures (100140 C) during the second synthesis step. The branching epitaxial growth due to aluminum-zoning resulted in the synthesis of the hierarchically porous zeolites.
The postsynthetic recrystallization can be used to prepare metal-encapsulated hollow zeolite nanocrystals. The synthesis consisted of two steps. First, a template-free hydrothermal synthesis of hollow aggregates of metal-containing zeolite nanocrystals was realized, and then, a selective desilicationrecrystallization together with a leachinghydrolysis was performed to transform the metal-containing zeolites into metal-encapsulated hollow zeolite crystals. The obtained material was found to possess a microporous (0.40.6 nm) wall of hollow zeolite crystals and a mesoporous (517 nm) shell of a nanovesicle with macropores of about 350 nm in the core (Figure 32DF). (555) In conclusion, hierarchically porous zeolites available today can be divided according to the size range of the additional porosity from micro-mesoporous structured zeolites, micro-macroporous structured zeolites, and micro-meso-macroporous structured zeolites, in which the secondary porosity can be found either within the zeolite crystals or in the intercrystalline voids. Numerous preparation methods are applied for hierarchically porous zeolites (Table 1). However, the underlying synthetic principles are simple, which are crystallization, aggregation, and extraction. (130) Hierarchically porous zeolites can be prepared by using a single principle or a combination of two or three principles during the synthesis process.
4. Applications
4.1. Catalytic Application
The introduction of meso- or macropores into microporous zeolites can significantly accelerate the mass transport, reduce the diffusion path of the reactants, and improve the accessibility of reactants to and the escape of products from the catalytic active sites in the catalytic reaction, leading to an increased reactant conversion/product selectivity and an extended lifetime of catalysts. (556,557) Therefore, hierarchically structured porous zeolites are quite desirable for catalysis and other processes. (9,558,559) In this section, we illustrate the abundant catalytic applications of hierarchically porous zeolites as catalysts in various reactions and show how the hierarchical porosities in zeolites can improve the catalytic properties of parent zeolites. Figure 33 and Table 2 give an overview of the catalytic applications of hierarchically porous zeolites.
