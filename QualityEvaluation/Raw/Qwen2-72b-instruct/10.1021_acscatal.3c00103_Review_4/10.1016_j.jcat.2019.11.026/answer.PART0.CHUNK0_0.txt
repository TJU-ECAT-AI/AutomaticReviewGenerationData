[1] "Al2O3 is one of the most commonly used supports in heterogeneous catalysis due to its structural advantages and stability."
[2] "The coordinately unsaturated Al3+ sites present on the (100) facets of commercial γ-Al2O3 can serve as anchor sites to anchor atomically dispersed Pt and Ru sites."
[3] "The specific interaction between Ga2O3 and Al2O3 can allow the tetrahedral Ga3+ cations to highly disperse in the spinel-type γ-Ga2O3-Al2O3 solid solution, leading to an enhanced activity and stability in PDH reaction."
[4] "The γ-Al2O3 nanosheet containing 27% penta-coordinated Al3+ sites has been proved that it could nicely disperse and stabilize bimetallic PtSn nanoclusters because of the strong interactions between metals and support."
[5] "The diversity and complexity on the structure of Al2O3, for example the surface acidity at the low-coordinated Al sites, determined the different properties in the adsorption and the activation of propane as well as coke deposition in the PDH reaction."

1.The physicochemical properties of catalysts, including chemical qualities and morphological characteristics, significantly influence their performance in dehydrogenation reactions. Al2O3, due to its structural advantages and stability, is commonly used as a support in heterogeneous catalysis. The coordinately unsaturated Al3+ sites on the (100) facets of commercial γ-Al2O3 can serve as anchor sites for atomically dispersed Pt and Ru sites. The specific interaction between Ga2O3 and Al2O3 allows the tetrahedral Ga3+ cations to highly disperse in the spinel-type γ-Ga2O3-Al2O3 solid solution, enhancing activity and stability in PDH reactions. The γ-Al2O3 nanosheet, containing 27% penta-coordinated Al3+ sites, can disperse and stabilize bimetallic PtSn nanoclusters due to strong interactions between metals and support. The diversity and complexity of Al2O3 structure, such as surface acidity at low-coordinated Al sites, determine different properties in propane adsorption, activation, and coke deposition in PDH reactions. Support modification strategies can optimize these properties for enhanced catalytic efficiency and selectivity.

1.催化剂的物理化学性质，包括化学品质和形态特征，对脱氢反应的性能有重大影响。由于其结构优势和稳定性，Al2O3在异相催化中常用作支撑。商业γ-Al2O3的(100)面上的配位不饱和Al3+位点可以作为锚定位点，锚定原子分散的Pt和Ru位点。Ga2O3和Al2O3之间的特定相互作用允许四面体Ga3+阳离子在自旋型γ-Ga2O3-Al2O3固溶体中高度分散，从而在PDH反应中增强活性和稳定性。含有27%五配位Al3+位点的γ-Al2O3纳米片由于金属和支撑之间强烈的相互作用，可以分散和稳定双金属PtSn纳米簇。Al2O3结构的多样性和复杂性，例如低配位Al位点的表面酸性，决定了PDH反应中丙烷吸附、活化和焦炭沉积的不同性质。支撑改性策略可以优化这些性质，以提高催化效率和选择性。
