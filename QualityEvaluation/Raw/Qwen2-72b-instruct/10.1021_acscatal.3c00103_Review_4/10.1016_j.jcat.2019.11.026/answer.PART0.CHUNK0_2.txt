1.The physicochemical properties of catalysts, including chemical qualities and morphological characteristics, significantly influence their performance in dehydrogenation reactions. Al2O3, due to its structural advantages and stability, is commonly used as a support in heterogeneous catalysis. The coordinately unsaturated Al3+ sites on the (100) facets of commercial γ-Al2O3 can serve as anchor sites for atomically dispersed Pt and Ru sites. The specific interaction between Ga2O3 and Al2O3 allows the tetrahedral Ga3+ cations to disperse in the spinel-type γ-Ga2O3-Al2O3 solid solution, enhancing activity and stability in PDH reactions. The γ-Al2O3 nanosheet, containing 27% penta-coordinated Al3+ sites, can disperse and stabilize bimetallic PtSn nanoclusters due to strong interactions between metals and support. The surface acidity at low-coordinated Al sites in Al2O3 determines the properties of propane adsorption, activation, and coke deposition in PDH reactions. A one-step hydrothermal method was used to synthesize sheet-shaped CoAl2O3HT catalysts for efficient PDH catalysis. The structural and catalytic stabilities, as well as the CoAl2O3 interaction, were benchmarked against an impregnated Co/Al2O3-IMP catalyst. The effect of C3H6 desorption behavior in Co-catalyzed PDH reactions was also illustrated. Support modification strategies, such as the use of γ-Al2O3 nanosheets and the specific interaction between Ga2O3 and Al2O3, can optimize these properties for enhanced catalytic efficiency and selectivity.

1.催化剂的物理化学性质，包括化学品质和形态特征，对脱氢反应的性能有重大影响。由于其结构优势和稳定性，Al2O3在异相催化中通常用作支撑。商业γ-Al2O3的(100)面上的配位不饱和Al3+位点可以作为锚定原子分散的Pt和Ru位点的锚定位点。Ga2O3和Al2O3之间的特定相互作用允许四面体Ga3+阳离子在自旋型γ-Ga2O3-Al2O3固溶体中高度分散，从而在PDH反应中增强活性和稳定性。含有27%五配位Al3+位点的γ-Al2O3纳米片由于金属和支撑物之间的强相互作用，可以分散和稳定双金属PtSn纳米簇。Al2O3中低配位Al位点的表面酸度决定了PDH反应中丙烷吸附、活化和焦炭沉积的性质。采用一步水热法合成了片状CoAl2O3HT催化剂，用于高效催化PDH反应。这些催化剂的结构和催化稳定性以及CoAl2O3的相互作用与浸渍的Co/Al2O3-IMP催化剂进行了基准测试。还说明了C3H6在Co催化PDH反应中的脱附行为。支撑改性策略，如使用γ-Al2O3纳米片和Ga2O3与Al2O3之间的特定相互作用，可以优化这些性质，以增强催化效率和选择性。
