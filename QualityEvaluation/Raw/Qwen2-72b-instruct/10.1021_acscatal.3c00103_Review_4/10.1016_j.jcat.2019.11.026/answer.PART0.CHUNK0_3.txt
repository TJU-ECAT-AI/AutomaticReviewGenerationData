1.The physicochemical properties of catalysts, including chemical qualities and morphological characteristics, significantly influence their performance in dehydrogenation reactions. Al2O3, as a commonly used support in heterogeneous catalysis, offers structural advantages and stability. The coordinately unsaturated Al3+ sites on the (100) facets of commercial γ-Al2O3 can serve as anchor sites for atomically dispersed Pt and Ru sites. The specific interaction between Ga2O3 and Al2O3 allows the tetrahedral Ga3+ cations to disperse highly in the spinel-type γ-Ga2O3-Al2O3 solid solution, enhancing activity and stability in PDH reactions. The γ-Al2O3 nanosheet containing 27% penta-coordinated Al3+ sites can disperse and stabilize bimetallic PtSn nanoclusters due to strong interactions between metals and support, leading to excellent performance in long-term PDH reactions at ultrahigh space velocities. The diversity and complexity of Al2O3 structure, such as surface acidity at low-coordinated Al sites, determine different properties in propane adsorption, activation, and coke deposition in PDH reactions. A one-step hydrothermal method synthesizes sheet-shaped CoAl2O3HT catalysts for efficient PDH catalysis, benchmarking structural and catalytic stabilities and CoAl2O3 interactions against an impregnated Co/Al2O3-IMP catalyst. The effect of C3H6 desorption behavior in Co-catalyzed PDH reactions is further illustrated.

1.催化剂的物理化学性质，包括化学品质和形态特征，对脱氢反应的性能有重大影响。Al2O3作为异相催化中常用的载体，具有结构优势和稳定性。商业γ-Al2O3的(100)面上的配位不饱和Al3+位点可以作为锚定位点，锚定原子分散的Pt和Ru位点。Ga2O3和Al2O3之间的特定相互作用允许四面体Ga3+阳离子在自旋型γ-Ga2O3-Al2O3固溶体中高度分散，从而在PDH反应中增强活性和稳定性。含有27%五配位Al3+位点的γ-Al2O3纳米片可以分散和稳定双金属PtSn纳米簇，这是由于金属和载体之间强烈的相互作用，导致在超高速空间速率下长期PDH反应的优异性能。Al2O3结构的多样性和复杂性，例如低配位Al位点的表面酸性，决定了PDH反应中丙烷吸附、活化和焦炭沉积的不同性质。采用一步水热法合成片状CoAl2O3HT催化剂，用于高效催化PDH反应，与浸渍的Co/Al2O3-IMP催化剂相比，基准结构和催化稳定性以及CoAl2O3相互作用。进一步说明了C3H6脱附行为在Co催化PDH反应中的影响。
