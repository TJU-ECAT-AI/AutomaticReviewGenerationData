[1] "Al2O3 is one of the most commonly used supports in heterogeneous catalysis due to its structural advantages and stability."

[3] "The specific interaction between Ga2O3 and Al2O3 can allow the tetrahedral Ga3+ cations to highly disperse in the spinel-type γ-Ga2O3-Al2O3 solid solution, leading to an enhanced activity and stability in PDH reaction."
[4] "The γ-Al2O3 nanosheet containing 27% penta-coordinated Al3+ sites has been proved that it could nicely disperse and stabilize bimetallic PtSn nanoclusters because of the strong interactions between metals and support."
[5] "This PtSn/Al2O3 sheet catalyst displayed an excellent performance at an ultrahigh space velocity in a long-term PDH reaction."
[6] "In addition to being an appropriate support, the hydroxyl groups-eliminated Al2O3 showed a high activity of coordinately unsaturated Al3+ as the surface active sites in non-oxidative dehydrogenation of isobutane to isobutylene."
[7] "Furthermore, the diversity and complexity on the structure of Al2O3, for example the surface acidity at the low-coordinated Al sites, determined the different properties in the adsorption and the activation of propane as well as coke deposition in the PDH reaction."

1.The physicochemical properties of catalysts, including chemical qualities and morphological characteristics, significantly influence their performance in dehydrogenation reactions. Al2O3, as a commonly used support in heterogeneous catalysis, offers structural advantages and stability. The coordinately unsaturated Al3+ sites on the (100) facets of commercial γ-Al2O3 can serve as anchor sites for atomically dispersed Pt and Ru sites. The specific interaction between Ga2O3 and Al2O3 allows the tetrahedral Ga3+ cations to highly disperse in the spinel-type γ-Ga2O3-Al2O3 solid solution, enhancing activity and stability in PDH reactions. The γ-Al2O3 nanosheet containing 27% penta-coordinated Al3+ sites can disperse and stabilize bimetallic PtSn nanoclusters due to strong interactions between metals and support, leading to excellent performance in long-term PDH reactions at ultrahigh space velocities. Hydroxyl groups-eliminated Al2O3 shows high activity of coordinately unsaturated Al3+ as surface active sites in non-oxidative dehydrogenation of isobutane to isobutylene. The diversity and complexity of Al2O3 structure, such as surface acidity at low-coordinated Al sites, determine different properties in the adsorption and activation of propane and coke deposition in PDH reactions. Tailoring the structure of Co2+ and Al2O3 composites can improve catalytic performance in PDH reactions.

1.催化剂的物理化学性质，包括化学品质和形态特征，对脱氢反应的性能有重大影响。Al2O3作为异相催化中常用的载体，提供了结构优势和稳定性。商业γ-Al2O3(100)面上的配位不饱和Al3+位点可以作为锚定位点，锚定原子分散的Pt和Ru位点。Ga2O3和Al2O3之间的特定相互作用允许四面体Ga3+阳离子在尖晶石型γ-Ga2O3-Al2O3固溶体中高度分散，提高了PDH反应的活性和稳定性。含有27%五配位Al3+位点的γ-Al2O3纳米片可以分散和稳定双金属PtSn纳米团簇，因为金属和载体之间有强烈的相互作用，这在长期PDH反应中以超高空间速度表现出优异的性能。去除羟基的Al2O3显示出高活性的配位不饱和Al3+作为表面活性位点，在异丁烷非氧化脱氢为异丁烯中表现出高活性。Al2O3结构的多样性和复杂性，例如低配位Al位点的表面酸性，决定了丙烷的吸附和活化以及PDH反应中焦炭沉积的不同性质。调整Co2+和Al2O3复合材料的结构可以提高PDH反应中的催化性能。
