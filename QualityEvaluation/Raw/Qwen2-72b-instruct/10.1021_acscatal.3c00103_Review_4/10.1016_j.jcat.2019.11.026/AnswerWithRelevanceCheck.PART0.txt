          Al2O3 is one of the most commonly used supports in heterogeneous catalysis due to its structural advantages and stability.
          The coordinately unsaturated Al3+ sites present on the (100) facets of commercial γ-Al2O3 can serve as anchor sites to anchor atomically dispersed Pt and Ru sites.
          The specific interaction between Ga2O3 and Al2O3 can allow the tetrahedral Ga3+ cations to highly disperse in the spinel-type γ-Ga2O3-Al2O3 solid solution, leading to an enhanced activity and stability in PDH reaction.
          The γ-Al2O3 nanosheet containing 27% penta-coordinated Al3+ sites has been proved that it could nicely disperse and stabilize bimetallic PtSn nanoclusters because of the strong interactions between metals and support.
          This PtSn/Al2O3 sheet catalyst displayed an excellent performance at an ultrahigh space velocity in a long-term PDH reaction.
          In addition to being an appropriate support, the hydroxyl groups-eliminated Al2O3 showed a high activity of coordinately unsaturated Al3+ as the surface active sites in non-oxidative dehydrogenation of isobutane to isobutylene.
          Furthermore, the diversity and complexity on the structure of Al2O3, for example the surface acidity at the low-coordinated Al sites, determined the different properties in the adsorption and the activation of propane as well as coke deposition in the PDH reaction.
          Herein, a one-step hydrothermal method is employed to synthesize sheet-shaped CoAl2O3HT catalysts for efficiently catalyzing the PDH reaction.
          The structural and catalytic stabilities as well as the CoAl2O3 interaction for these catalysts are benchmarked to an impregnated Co/Al2O3-IMP catalyst.
          We further illustrate the effect of C3H6 desorption behavior in the Co-catalyzed PDH reaction.

          The physicochemical properties of catalysts, including chemical qualities and morphological characteristics, significantly influence their performance in dehydrogenation reactions. Al2O3, due to its structural advantages and stability, is commonly used as a support in heterogeneous catalysis. The coordinately unsaturated Al3+ sites on the (100) facets of commercial γ-Al2O3 can serve as anchor sites for atomically dispersed Pt and Ru sites. The specific interaction between Ga2O3 and Al2O3 allows the tetrahedral Ga3+ cations to disperse in the spinel-type γ-Ga2O3-Al2O3 solid solution, enhancing activity and stability in PDH reactions.

The diversity and complexity of Al2O3 structure, such as surface acidity at low-coordinated Al sites, determine different properties in propane adsorption, activation, and coke deposition in PDH reactions. A one-step hydrothermal method synthesizes sheet-shaped CoAl2O3HT catalysts for efficient PDH catalysis, benchmarking structural and catalytic stabilities and CoAl2O3 interactions against an impregnated Co/Al2O3-IMP catalyst. The effect of C3H6 desorption behavior in Co-catalyzed PDH reactions is further illustrated. Support modification strategies, such as the use of γ-Al2O3 nanosheets and the specific interaction between Ga2O3 and Al2O3, can optimize these properties for enhanced catalytic efficiency and selectivity.

          催化剂的物理化学性质，包括化学品质和形态特征，对脱氢反应的性能有重大影响。Al2O3作为异相催化中常用的载体，提供了结构优势和稳定性。商业γ-Al2O3的(100)面上的配位不饱和Al3+位点可以作为锚定位点，锚定原子分散的Pt和Ru位点。Ga2O3和Al2O3之间的特定相互作用允许四面体Ga3+阳离子在尖晶石型γ-Ga2O3-Al2O3固溶体中高度分散，提高了PDH反应的活性和稳定性。含有27%五配位Al3+位点的γ-Al2O3纳米片可以分散和稳定双金属PtSn纳米团簇，因为金属和载体之间有强烈的相互作用，这在长期PDH反应中以超高空间速度表现出优异的性能。去除羟基的Al2O3显示出高活性的配位不饱和Al3+作为表面活性位点，在异丁烷非氧化脱氢为异丁烯中表现出高活性。Al2O3结构的多样性和复杂性，例如低配位Al位点的表面酸性，决定了丙烷的吸附和活化以及PDH反应中焦炭沉积的不同性质。采用一步水热法合成片状CoAl2O3HT催化剂，用于高效催化PDH反应，与浸渍的Co/Al2O3-IMP催化剂相比，基准结构和催化稳定性以及CoAl2O3相互作用。进一步说明了C3H6脱附行为在Co催化PDH反应中的影响。支撑改性策略，如使用γ-Al2O3纳米片和Ga2O3与Al2O3之间的特定相互作用，可以优化这些性质，以增强催化效率和选择性。
