          [1] "Different characterization techniques including H2-TPR, NH3-TPD, C3H6-TPD, XPS, BET, CO-chemisorption, CO-DRIFT, and TGA were used to unravel the properties of catalysts."
          [2] "Enhanced propylene selectivity (98.5% Vs 96.4% @ 600 C and 24 h TOS) and catalyst stability were achieved due to the decrease of acid centers of Al2O3 along with an increase of the degree of alloy formation upon addition of Ca."
          [3] "The experimental data of propane conversion vs. time were successfully fitted with the Deactivation Model with Residual Activity (DMRA), allowing for the calculation of the intrinsic deactivation kinetic parameters for both catalysts."
          [4] "For the Ca-promoted catalyst, a deactivation function of 0.05 h1 along with a residual activity of 0.82 at 600 C were obtained."
          [5] "Whereas, for the non-promoted sample, these values were 0.22 h1 and 0.63, respectively."
          [6] "The activation energy of the PDH reaction for the Pt0.5-Ge1.5/Al2O3-CaO catalyst was slightly higher than that of the unmodified one (74.8 kJ/mol vs. 66.4 kJ/mol) due to the enhanced reduction of the GeOx species on this sample, which enhanced the formation of a Pt-Ge alloy, decreasing the initial activity of the catalyst."
          [7] "However, the higher resistance against the deactivation by coke of the promoted catalyst was invoked to explain the better performance of this catalyst in terms both of activity and selectivity at steady state conditions."

          The physicochemical properties of catalysts, including chemical qualities and morphological characteristics, significantly influence their performance in dehydrogenation reactions. The decrease of acid centers of Al2O3 and the increase of the degree of alloy formation upon addition of Ca lead to enhanced propylene selectivity and catalyst stability. The deactivation model with residual activity (DMRA) was used to fit the experimental data of propane conversion vs. time, which allowed for the calculation of the intrinsic deactivation kinetic parameters for both catalysts. The Ca-promoted catalyst showed a lower deactivation function and higher residual activity, indicating better resistance against deactivation by coke. The activation energy of the PDH reaction for the Ca-promoted catalyst was slightly higher due to the enhanced reduction of the GeOx species, which enhanced the formation of a Pt-Ge alloy, decreasing the initial activity of the catalyst. However, this also led to better performance in terms of both activity and selectivity at steady state conditions. Support modification strategies, such as the addition of Ca, can optimize these properties for enhanced catalytic efficiency and selectivity.

          催化剂的物理化学性质，包括化学品质和形态特征，对脱氢反应的性能有重大影响。添加Ca后，Al2O3的酸中心减少，Pt-Ge合金的形成程度增加，这导致丙烯选择性和催化剂稳定性的提高。使用具有残余活性的失活模型(DMRA)拟合了丙烷转化率与时间的实验数据，这使得能够计算两种催化剂的内在失活动力学参数。Ca促进的催化剂显示出较低的失活函数和较高的残余活性，表明对焦炭失活有更好的抵抗力。Ca促进的催化剂的PDH反应的活化能略高，这是由于GeOx物种的增强还原，这增强了Pt-Ge合金的形成，降低了催化剂的初始活性。然而，这也导致在稳态条件下，活性和选择性方面都有更好的性能。通过添加Ca等支持修改策略，可以优化这些性质，以提高催化效率和选择性。
