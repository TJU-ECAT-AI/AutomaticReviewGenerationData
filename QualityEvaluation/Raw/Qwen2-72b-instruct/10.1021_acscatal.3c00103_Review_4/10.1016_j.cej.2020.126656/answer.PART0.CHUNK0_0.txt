[1] "Different characterization techniques including H2-TPR, NH3-TPD, C3H6-TPD, XPS, BET, CO-chemisorption, CO-DRIFT, and TGA were used to unravel the properties of catalysts."
[2] "Enhanced propylene selectivity (98.5% Vs 96.4% @ 600 C and 24 h TOS) and catalyst stability were achieved due to the decrease of acid centers of Al2O3 along with an increase of the degree of alloy formation upon addition of Ca."
[3] "The experimental data of propane conversion vs. time were successfully fitted with the Deactivation Model with Residual Activity (DMRA), allowing for the calculation of the intrinsic deactivation kinetic parameters for both catalysts."
[4] "For the Ca-promoted catalyst, a deactivation function of 0.05 h1 along with a residual activity of 0.82 at 600 C were obtained."
[5] "Whereas, for the non-promoted sample, these values were 0.22 h1 and 0.63, respectively."
[6] "The activation energy of the PDH reaction for the Pt0.5-Ge1.5/Al2O3-CaO catalyst was slightly higher than that of the unmodified one (74.8 kJ/mol vs. 66.4 kJ/mol) due to the enhanced reduction of the GeOx species on this sample, which enhanced the formation of a Pt-Ge alloy, decreasing the initial activity of the catalyst."
[7] "However, the higher resistance against the deactivation by coke of the promoted catalyst was invoked to explain the better performance of this catalyst in terms both of activity and selectivity at steady state conditions."

1.The physicochemical properties of catalysts, including chemical qualities and morphological characteristics, significantly influence their performance in dehydrogenation reactions. The decrease of acid centers of Al2O3 and the increase of the degree of alloy formation upon the addition of Ca lead to enhanced propylene selectivity and catalyst stability. The deactivation model with residual activity (DMRA) was used to fit the experimental data, revealing that the Ca-promoted catalyst has a lower deactivation function and higher residual activity compared to the non-promoted sample. The activation energy of the PDH reaction for the Ca-promoted catalyst is slightly higher, which is attributed to the enhanced reduction of GeOx species and the formation of a Pt-Ge alloy. The promoted catalyst exhibits higher resistance against deactivation by coke, resulting in better performance in terms of both activity and selectivity at steady state conditions.

1.催化剂的物理化学性质，包括化学品质和形态特征，对脱氢反应的性能有重大影响。添加Ca后，Al2O3的酸中心减少，Pt-Ge合金的形成程度增加，导致丙烯选择性和催化剂稳定性提高。使用残余活性的失活模型（DMRA）拟合实验数据，显示Ca促进的催化剂具有较低的失活函数和较高的残余活性，与未促进的样品相比。PDH反应的Ca促进催化剂的活化能略高，归因于GeOx物种的增强还原和Pt-Ge合金的形成。促进的催化剂对焦炭引起的失活具有更高的抵抗力，导致在稳态条件下，活性和选择性两方面都有更好的性能。
