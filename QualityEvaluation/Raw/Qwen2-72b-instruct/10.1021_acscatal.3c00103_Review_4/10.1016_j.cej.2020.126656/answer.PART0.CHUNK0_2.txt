[1] "The promoting effect of Ca on the catalytic performance of Pt0.5-Ge1.5/Al2O3 during propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reaction was studied using experimental methods and kinetic modeling."
[2] "Different characterization techniques including H2-TPR, NH3-TPD, C3H6-TPD, XPS, BET, CO-chemisorption, CO-DRIFT, and TGA were used to unravel the properties of catalysts."
[3] "Enhanced propylene selectivity (98.5% Vs 96.4% @ 600 C and 24 h TOS) and catalyst stability were achieved due to the decrease of acid centers of Al2O3 along with an increase of the degree of alloy formation upon addition of Ca."
[4] "The experimental data of propane conversion vs. time were successfully fitted with the Deactivation Model with Residual Activity (DMRA), allowing for the calculation of the intrinsic deactivation kinetic parameters for both catalysts."
[5] "For the Ca-promoted catalyst, a deactivation function of 0.05 h1 along with a residual activity of 0.82 at 600 C were obtained."
[6] "Whereas, for the non-promoted sample, these values were 0.22 h1 and 0.63, respectively."
[7] "The activation energy of the PDH reaction for the Pt0.5-Ge1.5/Al2O3-CaO catalyst was slightly higher than that of the unmodified one (74.8 kJ/mol vs. 66.4 kJ/mol) due to the enhanced reduction of the GeOx species on this sample, which enhanced the formation of a Pt-Ge alloy, decreasing the initial activity of the catalyst."
[8] "However, the higher resistance against the deactivation by coke of the promoted catalyst was invoked to explain the better performance of this catalyst in terms both of activity and selectivity at steady state conditions."

1.The physicochemical properties of catalysts, including chemical qualities and morphological characteristics, significantly influence their performance in dehydrogenation reactions. The addition of Ca to the Pt0.5-Ge1.5/Al2O3 catalyst enhances its performance in propane dehydrogenation by decreasing the acid centers of Al2O3 and increasing the degree of alloy formation. This results in enhanced propylene selectivity and catalyst stability. The deactivation behavior of the catalysts was studied using the Deactivation Model with Residual Activity (DMRA), which revealed that the Ca-promoted catalyst has a lower deactivation function and higher residual activity compared to the non-promoted sample. The activation energy of the PDH reaction for the Ca-promoted catalyst is slightly higher due to the enhanced reduction of GeOx species, which enhances the formation of a Pt-Ge alloy and decreases the initial activity of the catalyst. However, the promoted catalyst has a higher resistance against deactivation by coke, leading to better performance in terms of both activity and selectivity at steady state conditions.

1.催化剂的物理化学性质，包括化学品质和形态特征，对脱氢反应的性能有重大影响。向Pt0.5-Ge1.5/Al2O3催化剂中添加Ca，通过减少Al2O3的酸中心和增加合金形成程度，提高了其在丙烷脱氢中的性能。这导致了丙烯选择性和催化剂稳定性的增强。使用具有残余活性的失活模型(DMRA)研究了催化剂的失活行为，结果表明，与未促进样品相比，Ca促进的催化剂具有较低的失活函数和较高的残余活性。Ca促进的催化剂的PDH反应的活化能略高，这是由于GeOx物种的增强还原，这增强了Pt-Ge合金的形成，降低了催化剂的初始活性。然而，促进的催化剂对焦炭失活的抵抗力更高，这导致在稳态条件下，其在活性和选择性方面都有更好的性能。
