1.The study of the promoting effect of Ca on the catalytic performance of Pt0.5-Ge1.5/Al2O3 during propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reaction using experimental methods and kinetic modeling revealed that the addition of Ca leads to enhanced propylene selectivity and catalyst stability. This is attributed to the decrease of acid centers of Al2O3 and the increase of the degree of alloy formation. The experimental data of propane conversion vs. time were successfully fitted with the Deactivation Model with Residual Activity (DMRA), which allowed for the calculation of the intrinsic deactivation kinetic parameters for both catalysts. The Ca-promoted catalyst showed a lower deactivation function and higher residual activity compared to the non-promoted sample. The activation energy of the PDH reaction for the Ca-promoted catalyst was slightly higher due to the enhanced reduction of the GeOx species, which enhanced the formation of a Pt-Ge alloy, decreasing the initial activity of the catalyst. However, the higher resistance against the deactivation by coke of the promoted catalyst explained its better performance in terms of both activity and selectivity at steady state conditions.

1.通过实验方法和动力学建模研究了Ca对Pt0.5-Ge1.5/Al2O3在丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应中催化性能的促进作用，发现添加Ca导致丙烯选择性和催化剂稳定性的提高。这归因于Al2O3酸中心的减少和合金形成程度的增加。丙烷转化率与时间的实验数据成功地与具有残余活性的失活模型(DMRA)相匹配，这使得能够计算两种催化剂的内在失活动力学参数。Ca促进的催化剂显示出较低的失活函数和较高的残余活性，与未促进的样品相比。Ca促进的催化剂的PDH反应的活化能略高，这是由于GeOx物种的增强还原，增强了Pt-Ge合金的形成，降低了催化剂的初始活性。然而，Ca促进的催化剂对焦炭失活的更高抵抗力解释了其在稳态条件下在活性和选择性方面都表现出更好的性能。
