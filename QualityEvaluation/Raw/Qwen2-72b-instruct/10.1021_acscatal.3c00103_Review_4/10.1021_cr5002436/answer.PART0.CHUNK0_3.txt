[1] "Alumina is by far the most common support, and a variety of methods to produce chromiaalumina catalysts have been investigated."
[2] "The nature of the support is important not only because it governs the mechanical properties of the catalyst, but also because the interaction of the carrier with the active phase can have a profound impact on catalyst activity and selectivity."
[3] "Indeed, studies on the nonoxidative dehydrogenation of ethane have revealed that catalytic activity based on ethane conversion and ethylene yields follows the order CrOx/γ-Al2O3 > CrOx/SiO2 > CrOx/MCM-41  CrOx/MgO  CrOx/Si-2."
[4] "The use of zirconia as an alternative support has also been investigated."
[5] "The use of silica as the support in chromia-based dehydrogenation catalysts requires a relative high surface area to stabilize Cr6+ sites."
[6] "CrMgAl and CrMg mixed oxides prepared using layered double hydroxide (LDH) precursors have been studied as catalysts for the nonoxidative dehydrogenation of ethane."
[7] "Finally, the study of porous chromia-pillared α-zirconium phosphate materials has been particularly informative with regards to the influence that acidity has on catalytic behavior."

1.The physicochemical properties of catalysts, including chemical qualities and morphological characteristics, significantly influence their performance in dehydrogenation reactions. The nature of the support is crucial as it not only determines the mechanical properties of the catalyst but also affects the interaction between the carrier and the active phase, which can profoundly impact catalyst activity and selectivity. For instance, alumina is the most common support, and the method of producing chromia-alumina catalysts can vary, affecting the catalyst's performance. The choice of support can also influence the catalytic activity, with different supports leading to varying orders of activity based on conversion and yield. Zirconia, as an alternative support, has been investigated for its low surface acidity and enhanced sintering resistance. Silica requires a high surface area to stabilize Cr6+ sites, and mixed oxides prepared using layered double hydroxide precursors have been studied for their catalytic properties in dehydrogenation reactions. The acidity of the support, as seen in chromia-pillared α-zirconium phosphate materials, can also influence catalytic behavior, with strong acid sites affecting cracking reactions and medium strength acid sites impacting dehydrogenation reactions.

2.Support modification strategies can be employed to optimize the properties of catalysts for enhanced catalytic efficiency and selectivity. For example, doping alumina-based dehydrogenation catalysts with alkali ions can effectively poison undesirable acid sites, improving selectivity. Using zirconia as a support can prevent the formation of mixed oxides and offer higher thermal stability and surface area. Silica, with its high surface area, can stabilize Cr6+ sites, while mixed oxides prepared using layered double hydroxide precursors can provide improved coking resistance and thermal stability against sintering. Understanding the role of acidity in catalytic behavior can also guide the modification of supports to favor dehydrogenation reactions over cracking reactions.

1.催化剂的物理化学性质，包括化学品质和形态特征，对脱氢反应的性能有重大影响。载体的性质不仅决定了催化剂的机械性能，还影响了载体与活性相之间的相互作用，这可能对催化剂的活性和选择性产生深远影响。例如，氧化铝是最常见的载体，生产氧化铬-氧化铝催化剂的方法可以变化，影响催化剂的性能。载体的选择也会影响催化活性，不同的载体会导致基于转化率和产量的不同活性顺序。作为替代载体，氧化锆因其低表面酸性和增强的抗烧结性而被研究。二氧化硅作为载体需要高表面积来稳定Cr6+位点，使用层状双氢氧化物前体制备的混合氧化物已被研究其在脱氢反应中的催化性质。载体的酸性，如在氧化铬-柱撑α-磷酸锆材料中所见，也会影响催化行为，强酸位点会影响裂化反应，中等强度酸位点会影响脱氢反应。

2.可以通过载体改性策略来优化催化剂的性质，以提高催化效率和选择性。例如，用碱金属离子掺杂氧化铝基脱氢催化剂可以有效地毒化不希望的酸位点，提高选择性。使用氧化锆作为载体可以防止混合氧化物的形成，并提供更高的热稳定性和表面积。二氧化硅，由于其高表面积，可以稳定Cr6+位点，而使用层状双氢氧化物前体制备的混合氧化物可以提供改善的焦化抗性和抗烧结热稳定性。了解酸性在催化行为中的作用也可以指导载体的改性，以利于脱氢反应而不是裂化反应。
