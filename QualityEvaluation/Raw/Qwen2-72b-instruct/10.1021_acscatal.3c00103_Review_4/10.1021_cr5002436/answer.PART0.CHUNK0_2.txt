[1] "Alumina is by far the most common support, and a variety of methods to produce chromiaalumina catalysts have been investigated."
[2] "The nature of the support is important not only because it governs the mechanical properties of the catalyst, but also because the interaction of the carrier with the active phase can have a profound impact on catalyst activity and selectivity."
[3] "Albeit all of the noble metals of group VIIIB are active in the nonoxidative hydrogenation of alkanes, Pt is the only noble metal utilized in commercial applications due to its superior activation of paraffinic CH bonds and low activity to CC cleavage."
[4] "The addition of alkaline metals, such as Li, Na, and K, poisons these acid sites, suppressing the formation of coke on the support as shown in Figure 10."
[5] "The use of zirconia as an alternative support has also been investigated."
[6] "The use of silica as the support in chromia-based dehydrogenation catalysts requires a relative high surface area to stabilize Cr6+ sites."
[7] "CrMgAl and CrMg mixed oxides prepared using layered double hydroxide (LDH) precursors have been studied as catalysts for the nonoxidative dehydrogenation of ethane."
[8] "Finally, the study of porous chromia-pillared α-zirconium phosphate materials has been particularly informative with regards to the influence that acidity has on catalytic behavior."

1.The physicochemical properties of catalysts, including chemical qualities and morphological characteristics, significantly influence their performance in dehydrogenation reactions. Alumina is the most common support, and its interaction with the active phase can profoundly impact catalyst activity and selectivity. Noble metals, particularly platinum, are preferred for their superior activation of paraffinic CH bonds and low activity for CC cleavage. The addition of alkaline metals like lithium, sodium, and potassium can poison acid sites on the support, suppressing coke formation. Zirconia is an alternative support that has been investigated, offering low surface acidity and enhanced sintering resistance. Silica requires a high surface area to stabilize Cr6+ sites. Mixed oxides prepared using layered double hydroxide precursors have also been studied for nonoxidative dehydrogenation reactions. The acidity of the support material, such as in chromia-pillared α-zirconium phosphate, can significantly affect catalytic behavior.

1.催化剂的物理化学性质，包括化学品质和形态特征，对脱氢反应的性能有重大影响。氧化铝是最常见的载体，它与活性相的相互作用可以显著影响催化剂的活性和选择性。贵金属，尤其是铂，因其对烷烃CH键的优异活化和对CC键断裂的低活性而被优先选择。添加碱金属如锂、钠和钾可以毒化载体上的酸位点，抑制焦炭的形成。锆酸盐作为一种替代载体已被研究，它具有低表面酸性和增强的抗烧结性。二氧化硅作为载体需要相对高的表面积来稳定Cr6+位点。使用层状双氢氧化物前体制备的混合氧化物也被研究用于非氧化脱氢反应。载体材料的酸性，如在铬酸盐柱撑α-锆磷酸盐中，可以显著影响催化行为。
