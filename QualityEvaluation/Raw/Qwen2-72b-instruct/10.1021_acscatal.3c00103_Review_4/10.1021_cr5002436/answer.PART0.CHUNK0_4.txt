[1] "Alumina is by far the most common support, and a variety of methods to produce chromiaalumina catalysts have been investigated."
[2] "The nature of the support is important not only because it governs the mechanical properties of the catalyst, but also because the interaction of the carrier with the active phase can have a profound impact on catalyst activity and selectivity."
[3] "Albeit selectivity has been found to be insensitive to chromium loading, it does change over time."
[4] "The use of zirconia as an alternative support has also been investigated."
[5] "The use of silica as the support in chromia-based dehydrogenation catalysts requires a relative high surface area to stabilize Cr6+ sites."
[6] "CrMgAl and CrMg mixed oxides prepared using layered double hydroxide (LDH) precursors have been studied as catalysts for the nonoxidative dehydrogenation of ethane."
[7] "Finally, the study of porous chromia-pillared α-zirconium phosphate materials has been particularly informative with regards to the influence that acidity has on catalytic behavior."

1.The physicochemical properties of catalysts, including chemical qualities and morphological characteristics, significantly influence their performance in dehydrogenation reactions. For instance, the nature of the support material, such as alumina, zirconia, or silica, can affect the dispersion and stability of the active phase, thereby impacting the catalytic activity and selectivity. The interaction between the support and the active phase can also alter the electronic properties of the catalyst, which can further enhance its performance. Support modification strategies, such as doping with alkali metals or using mixed oxides, can optimize these properties for enhanced catalytic efficiency and selectivity. For example, doping with alkali metals can reduce surface acidity and increase the number of active sites, while using mixed oxides can improve thermal stability and coking resistance.

1.催化剂的物理化学性质，包括化学品质和形态特征，对脱氢反应的性能有重大影响。例如，支撑材料的性质，如氧化铝、氧化锆或二氧化硅，可以影响活性相的分散和稳定性，从而影响催化活性和选择性。支撑材料与活性相之间的相互作用还可以改变催化剂的电子性质，从而进一步提高其性能。支撑材料改性策略，如用碱金属掺杂或使用混合氧化物，可以优化这些性质，以提高催化效率和选择性。例如，用碱金属掺杂可以降低表面酸性，增加活性位点的数量，而使用混合氧化物可以提高热稳定性和抗焦炭性能。
