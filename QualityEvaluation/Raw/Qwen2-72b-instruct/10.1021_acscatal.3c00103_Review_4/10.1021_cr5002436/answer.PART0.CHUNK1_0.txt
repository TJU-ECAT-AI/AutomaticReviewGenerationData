[1] "The surface area-to-metal loading ratio determines which species will form. Indeed, Wu et al. reported that monomeric species are predominantly present below 1.2 V/nm2, polymeric vanadium species prevail between 1.2 and 4.4 V/nm2, and crystalline V2O5 species preponderate at even higher loadings."
[2] "The reducibility of the vanadium species depends on their molecular structure, VOV and VO bonds being more easily reduced than VO-support bonds."
[3] "The performance of supported vanadium catalysts can be improved through the addition of MgO, either as a promoter or as a component of a mixed oxide. According to these workers, the increase in dehydrogenation selectivity stems from the basic nature of MgO, resulting in reduced coke formation."
[4] "Alumina is commonly used as a support for vanadium oxide catalysts, although Sokolov et al. concluded through testing a wide range of Si- and Al-based supports that using silica to dope the alumina support provides beneficial effects on catalyst stability and activity."
[5] "The chemistry of molybdenum oxide is comparable to that of vanadium oxide, as Mo can be present as MoOx monomers, polymers, or MoO3 crystallites, depending on the molybdenum loading, the type of support used, and catalyst preparation conditions."
[6] "The reduction of the catalyst with hydrogen prior to reaction increases conversion, although selectivity decreases due to the formation of acid sites."
[7] "The structure of the support is also important, as a mesoporous GaAl mixed oxide exhibited an increased resistance to catalyst coking."
[8] "The function of K was to reduce coke formation by poisoning Brnsted acid sites."

1.The physicochemical properties of catalysts, including chemical qualities and morphological characteristics, have a significant impact on their performance in dehydrogenation reactions. For example, the surface area-to-metal loading ratio determines the formation of different vanadium species, which affects the catalytic activity. The reducibility of vanadium species also influences the catalytic performance. The addition of MgO can improve the selectivity of vanadium-based catalysts by reducing coke formation. Using silica to dope alumina support can enhance the stability and activity of vanadium oxide catalysts. The type of support and preparation conditions can affect the formation of molybdenum oxide species. Hydrogen reduction can increase conversion but decrease selectivity due to the formation of acid sites. The structure of the support, such as mesoporous GaAl mixed oxide, can increase the resistance to catalyst coking. Poisoning Brnsted acid sites with K can reduce coke formation.

1.催化剂的物理化学性质，包括化学品质和形态特征，对脱氢反应的性能有重大影响。例如，表面面积与金属负载比决定了不同钒物种的形成，这影响了催化活性。钒物种的还原性也影响催化性能。添加MgO可以提高钒基催化剂的选择性，减少焦炭形成。使用硅对氧化铝载体进行掺杂可以增强钒氧化物催化剂的稳定性和活性。载体类型和制备条件可以影响钼氧化物物种的形成。氢还原可以增加转化率，但会因酸性位点的形成而降低选择性。载体结构，如介孔GaAl混合氧化物，可以增加对催化剂焦炭的抵抗力。用K中毒Brnsted酸位点可以减少焦炭形成。
