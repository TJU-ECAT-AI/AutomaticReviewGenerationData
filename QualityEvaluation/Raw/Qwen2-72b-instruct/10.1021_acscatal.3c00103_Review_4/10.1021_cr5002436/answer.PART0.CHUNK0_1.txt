[1] "Alumina is by far the most common support, and a variety of methods to produce chromiaalumina catalysts have been investigated."
[2] "The nature of the support is important not only because it governs the mechanical properties of the catalyst, but also because the interaction of the carrier with the active phase can have a profound impact on catalyst activity and selectivity."
[3] "Albeit selectivity has been found to be insensitive to chromium loading, it does change over time."
[4] "The use of zirconia as an alternative support has also been investigated."
[5] "The use of silica as the support in chromia-based dehydrogenation catalysts requires a relative high surface area to stabilize Cr6+ sites."
[6] "CrMgAl and CrMg mixed oxides prepared using layered double hydroxide (LDH) precursors have been studied as catalysts for the nonoxidative dehydrogenation of ethane."
[7] "Finally, the study of porous chromia-pillared α-zirconium phosphate materials has been particularly informative with regards to the influence that acidity has on catalytic behavior."

1.The physicochemical properties of catalysts, including chemical qualities and morphological characteristics, significantly influence their performance in dehydrogenation reactions. Alumina is the most common support, and its interaction with the active phase can profoundly impact catalyst activity and selectivity. Selectivity may change over time, and alternative supports like zirconia have been investigated for their low surface acidity and enhanced sintering resistance. Silica requires a high surface area to stabilize Cr6+ sites. Mixed oxides prepared using layered double hydroxide precursors have also been studied for their catalytic performance in dehydrogenation reactions. The acidity of the support, as seen in chromia-pillared α-zirconium phosphate materials, can affect catalytic behavior, with strong acid sites rapidly deactivating and inhibiting cracking reactions.
2.Support modification strategies to optimize these properties for enhanced catalytic efficiency and selectivity include doping alumina-based dehydrogenation catalysts with alkali ions to poison undesirable acid sites, using zirconia as a substitute for alumina due to its low surface acidity and enhanced sintering resistance, and increasing the surface area and thermal stability of catalysts. Additionally, the use of mixed oxides and porous materials can improve catalytic performance by stabilizing active sites and controlling acidity.

1.催化剂的物理化学性质，包括化学品质和形态特征，对脱氢反应的性能有重大影响。氧化铝是最常见的载体，它与活性相的相互作用可以深刻影响催化剂的活性和选择性。选择性可能会随时间变化，已经研究了氧化锆等替代载体，因为它们的表面酸度低，抗烧结性增强。二氧化硅需要高表面积来稳定Cr6+位点。使用层状双氢氧化物前体制备的混合氧化物也已被研究用于脱氢反应的催化性能。在铬酸盐柱撑α-锆磷酸盐材料中，载体的酸性可以影响催化行为，强酸位点迅速失活，抑制裂解反应。
2.为了优化这些性质，提高催化效率和选择性，支持体改性策略包括用碱金属离子掺杂氧化铝基脱氢催化剂，以毒化不希望的酸位点；使用氧化锆代替氧化铝，因为其表面酸度低，抗烧结性增强；增加催化剂的表面积和热稳定性。此外，使用混合氧化物和多孔材料可以通过稳定活性位点和控制酸性来改善催化性能。
