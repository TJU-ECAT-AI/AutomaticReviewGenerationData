[1] "The surface area-to-metal loading ratio determines which species will form. Indeed, Wu et al. reported that monomeric species are predominantly present below 1.2 V/nm2, polymeric vanadium species prevail between 1.2 and 4.4 V/nm2, and crystalline V2O5 species preponderate at even higher loadings."
[2] "On the one hand, the presence of hydroxyl groups on the surface of the support is important to obtain a well-dispersed catalyst, as OH groups serve as anchoring sites for the vanadium precursors used to prepare these catalysts."
[3] "On the contrary, large V2O5 crystallites are practically inactive in dehydrogenation."
[4] "The reducibility of the vanadium species depends on their molecular structure, VOV and VO bonds being more easily reduced than VO-support bonds."
[5] "Prior to reaction, the vanadium in these catalysts is generally present as V5+. However, the reduction of the catalyst by the hydrocarbon feed results in the formation of V4+ and V3+."
[6] "Initially, deactivation is caused by the strong adsorption of reactants on the active sites and to a lesser extent to coke deposition."
[7] "When the coke is removed through the calcination of the catalyst, the latter may deactivate further as vanadium oxide species sinter and form larger V2O5 crystallites or mixed oxides such as AlVO4, both of which are less active."
[8] "V2O5 crystallites can revert to active polymeric vanadium species by treating the catalyst under an oxygen atmosphere at 600 C."
[9] "In several studies, CO2 is added to the feed as a mild oxidant to increase alkene yields."
[10] "Different reasons for this beneficial effect of CO2 have been suggested, such as the removal of acid sites that catalyze unwanted side reactions, coke gasification, oxidation of overly reduced vanadium centers, and hydrogen removal by the reverse watergas shift reaction."
[11] "Ogonowski et al. reported that the effect of CO2 depends strongly on the catalyst support."
[12] "Relatively weak basic sites on carriers, such as those present on an activated carbon support, facilitate the reverse water gas shift reaction, which lifts the thermodynamic limitation of the reaction and increases alkane conversion."
[13] "When these basic sites are too strong, as is the case on Al2O3 and ZnO2, CO2 irreversibly adsorbs and poisons these sites."
[14] "This increases the acidity of the support, which in turn increases coke formation and lowers selectivity."
[15] "Alumina is commonly used as a support for vanadium oxide catalysts, although Sokolov et al. concluded through testing a wide range of Si- and Al-based supports that using silica to dope the alumina support provides beneficial effects on catalyst stability and activity."
[16] "Furthermore, as was shown by Harlin et al., the performance of supported vanadium catalysts can be improved through the addition of MgO, either as a promoter or as a component of a mixed oxide."
[17] "According to these workers, the increase in dehydrogenation selectivity stems from the basic nature of MgO, resulting in reduced coke formation."

1.The physicochemical properties of catalysts, including chemical qualities and morphological characteristics, significantly influence their performance in dehydrogenation reactions. The surface area-to-metal loading ratio determines the formation of different vanadium species, which affects the catalytic activity. The presence of hydroxyl groups on the support surface is crucial for anchoring vanadium precursors and obtaining a well-dispersed catalyst. Large V2O5 crystallites are inactive in dehydrogenation, while polymeric vanadium species are more active. The reducibility of vanadium species depends on their molecular structure, with VOV and VO bonds being more easily reduced. The reduction of the catalyst by the hydrocarbon feed results in the formation of V4+ and V3+, which are more active species. Deactivation initially occurs due to the strong adsorption of reactants on active sites and coke deposition. After calcination to remove coke, the catalyst may further deactivate due to the formation of larger V2O5 crystallites or mixed oxides. V2O5 crystallites can revert to active polymeric vanadium species under certain conditions. CO2 addition to the feed can increase alkene yields by removing acid sites, facilitating coke gasification, oxidizing reduced vanadium centers, and removing hydrogen through the reverse water-gas shift reaction. The effect of CO2 depends on the catalyst support, with weak basic sites on activated carbon support facilitating the reverse water-gas shift reaction, while strong basic sites on Al2O3 and ZnO2 can be poisoned by CO2, increasing acidity and coke formation. Using silica to dope alumina support can improve catalyst stability and activity. The addition of MgO can enhance dehydrogenation selectivity by reducing coke formation due to its basic nature.

1.催化剂的物理化学性质，包括化学品质和形态特征，对脱氢反应的性能有重大影响。表面面积与金属负载比决定了不同钒物种的形成，影响催化活性。支撑表面存在羟基对于锚定钒前体和获得均匀分散的催化剂至关重要。大V2O5晶体在脱氢反应中几乎不活跃，而聚合钒物种则更活跃。钒物种的还原性取决于其分子结构，VOV和VO键更容易被还原。催化剂通过烃类进料还原，导致V4+和V3+的形成，这些是更活跃的物种。失活最初是由于反应物在活性位点的强烈吸附和焦炭沉积。通过煅烧去除焦炭后，催化剂可能由于形成更大的V2O5晶体或混合氧化物而进一步失活。V2O5晶体可以在一定条件下恢复为活性聚合钒物种。向进料中添加CO2可以通过去除酸位点、促进焦炭气化、氧化还原的钒中心和通过逆水煤气变换反应去除氢气来增加烯烃产量。CO2的影响取决于催化剂支撑，弱碱性位点在活性炭支撑上可以促进逆水煤气变换反应，而Al2O3和ZnO2上的强碱性位点可以被CO2毒化，增加酸性和焦炭形成。使用二氧化硅掺杂氧化铝支撑可以改善催化剂的稳定性和活性。添加MgO可以提高脱氢选择性，通过其碱性性质减少焦炭形成。
