[1] "Alumina is by far the most common support, and a variety of methods to produce chromiaalumina catalysts have been investigated."
[2] "The nature of the support is important not only because it governs the mechanical properties of the catalyst, but also because the interaction of the carrier with the active phase can have a profound impact on catalyst activity and selectivity."
[3] "Albeit all of the noble metals of group VIIIB are active in the nonoxidative hydrogenation of alkanes, Pt is the only noble metal utilized in commercial applications due to its superior activation of paraffinic CH bonds and low activity to CC cleavage."
[4] "Indeed, it has been observed that Cr5+ species that are not reduced in a hydrogen atmosphere can be reduced by alkanes."
[5] "The use of zirconia as an alternative support has also been investigated."
[6] "The use of silica as the support in chromia-based dehydrogenation catalysts requires a relative high surface area to stabilize Cr6+ sites."
[7] "CrMgAl and CrMg mixed oxides prepared using layered double hydroxide (LDH) precursors have been studied as catalysts for the nonoxidative dehydrogenation of ethane."
[8] "Finally, the study of porous chromia-pillared α-zirconium phosphate materials has been particularly informative with regards to the influence that acidity has on catalytic behavior."

1.The physicochemical properties of catalysts, including chemical qualities and morphological characteristics, significantly influence their performance in dehydrogenation reactions. For instance, the nature of the support is crucial as it not only determines the mechanical properties of the catalyst but also affects the interaction between the carrier and the active phase, which can profoundly impact catalyst activity and selectivity. Alumina is the most common support, and various methods have been explored to produce chromia-alumina catalysts. The choice of support can also influence the stability and dispersion of the active phase, which in turn affects the catalytic efficiency and selectivity. For example, zirconia has been investigated as an alternative support due to its low surface acidity and enhanced sintering resistance, which can improve the performance of chromia-based catalysts. The acidity of the support can also play a role in catalytic behavior, as demonstrated by the study of porous chromia-pillared α-zirconium phosphate materials. Support modification strategies, such as doping with alkali metals or using mixed oxides, can optimize these properties for enhanced catalytic efficiency and selectivity. For instance, doping with alkali metals can stabilize the structure of the support, reduce surface acidity, and increase the number of active sites. Using mixed oxides can also improve the thermal stability and coking resistance of the catalysts.

1.催化剂的物理化学性质，包括化学品质和形态特征，对脱氢反应的性能有重大影响。例如，载体的性质不仅决定了催化剂的机械性能，还影响了载体与活性相之间的相互作用，这可能对催化剂活性和选择性产生深远影响。氧化铝是最常见的载体，已经探索了各种方法来生产铬氧化铝催化剂。载体的选择也会影响活性相的稳定性和分散性，进而影响催化效率和选择性。例如，由于其低表面酸性和增强的烧结抗性，锆酸盐已被研究作为替代载体，可以改善铬基催化剂的性能。载体的酸性也可以在催化行为中发挥作用，正如多孔铬氧化物柱状α-锆酸盐材料的研究所示。通过载体改性策略，如用碱金属掺杂或使用混合氧化物，可以优化这些性质，以增强催化效率和选择性。例如，用碱金属掺杂可以稳定载体结构，降低表面酸性，并增加活性位点的数量。使用混合氧化物也可以提高催化剂的热稳定性和抗焦性。
