1.The physicochemical properties of catalysts, including chemical qualities and morphological characteristics, have a significant impact on their performance in dehydrogenation reactions. For example, the surface area-to-metal loading ratio determines the formation of different vanadium species, which affects the catalytic activity. The reducibility of vanadium species also influences the catalytic performance. The addition of MgO can improve the selectivity of vanadium-based catalysts by reducing coke formation. Using silica to dope alumina support can enhance the stability and activity of vanadium oxide catalysts. The type of support and preparation conditions can affect the formation of molybdenum oxide species. Hydrogen reduction can increase conversion but decrease selectivity due to the formation of acid sites. The structure of the support, such as mesoporous GaAl mixed oxide, can increase the resistance to catalyst coking. Poisoning Brnsted acid sites with K can reduce coke formation.

1.The physicochemical properties of catalysts, including chemical qualities and morphological characteristics, significantly influence their performance in dehydrogenation reactions. For instance, the nature of the support is crucial as it not only determines the mechanical properties of the catalyst but also affects the interaction between the carrier and the active phase, which can profoundly impact catalyst activity and selectivity. Alumina is the most common support, and various methods have been explored to produce chromia-alumina catalysts. The choice of support can also influence the stability and dispersion of the active phase, which in turn affects the catalytic efficiency and selectivity. For example, zirconia has been investigated as an alternative support due to its low surface acidity and enhanced sintering resistance, which can improve the performance of chromia-based catalysts. The acidity of the support can also play a role in catalytic behavior, as demonstrated by the study of porous chromia-pillared α-zirconium phosphate materials. Support modification strategies, such as doping with alkali metals or using mixed oxides, can optimize these properties for enhanced catalytic efficiency and selectivity. For instance, doping with alkali metals can stabilize the structure of the support, reduce surface acidity, and increase the number of active sites. Using mixed oxides can also improve the thermal stability and coking resistance of the catalysts.

1.催化剂的物理化学性质，包括化学品质和形态特征，对脱氢反应的性能有重大影响。表面面积与金属负载比决定了不同钒物种的形成，影响催化活性。支撑表面存在羟基对于锚定钒前体和获得均匀分散的催化剂至关重要。大V2O5晶体在脱氢反应中几乎不活跃，而聚合钒物种则更活跃。钒物种的还原性取决于其分子结构，VOV和VO键更容易被还原。催化剂通过烃类进料还原，导致V4+和V3+的形成，这些是更活跃的物种。失活最初是由于反应物在活性位点的强烈吸附和焦炭沉积。通过煅烧去除焦炭后，催化剂可能由于形成更大的V2O5晶体或混合氧化物而进一步失活。V2O5晶体可以在一定条件下恢复为活性聚合钒物种。向进料中添加CO2可以通过去除酸位点、促进焦炭气化、氧化还原的钒中心和通过逆水煤气变换反应去除氢气来增加烯烃产量。CO2的影响取决于催化剂支撑，弱碱性位点在活性炭支撑上可以促进逆水煤气变换反应，而Al2O3和ZnO2上的强碱性位点可以被CO2毒化，增加酸性和焦炭形成。使用二氧化硅掺杂氧化铝支撑可以改善催化剂的稳定性和活性。添加MgO可以提高脱氢选择性，通过其碱性性质减少焦炭形成。

Zirconia is an alternative support that has been investigated, offering low surface acidity and enhanced sintering resistance. Silica requires a high surface area to stabilize Cr6+ sites. Mixed oxides prepared using layered double hydroxide precursors have also been studied for nonoxidative dehydrogenation reactions. The acidity of the support material, such as in chromia-pillared α-zirconium phosphate, can significantly affect catalytic behavior.

1.催化剂的物理化学性质，包括化学品质和形态特征，对脱氢反应的性能有重大影响。氧化铝是最常见的载体，它与活性相的相互作用可以显著影响催化剂的活性和选择性。贵金属，尤其是铂，因其对烷烃CH键的优异活化和对CC键断裂的低活性而被优先选择。添加碱金属如锂、钠和钾可以毒化载体上的酸位点，抑制焦炭的形成。锆酸盐作为一种替代载体已被研究，它具有低表面酸性和增强的抗烧结性。二氧化硅作为载体需要相对高的表面积来稳定Cr6+位点。使用层状双氢氧化物前体制备的混合氧化物也被研究用于非氧化脱氢反应。载体材料的酸性，如在铬酸盐柱撑α-锆磷酸盐中，可以显著影响催化行为。

[1] "The surface area-to-metal loading ratio determines which species will form. Indeed, Wu et al. reported that monomeric species are predominantly present below 1.2 V/nm2, polymeric vanadium species prevail between 1.2 and 4.4 V/nm2, and crystalline V2O5 species preponderate at even higher loadings."
[2] "On the one hand, the presence of hydroxyl groups on the surface of the support is important to obtain a well-dispersed catalyst, as OH groups serve as anchoring sites for the vanadium precursors used to prepare these catalysts."
[3] "On the contrary, large V2O5 crystallites are practically inactive in dehydrogenation."
[4] "Prior to reaction, the vanadium in these catalysts is generally present as V5+. However, the reduction of the catalyst by the hydrocarbon feed results in the formation of V4+ and V3+."
[5] "Initially, deactivation is caused by the strong adsorption of reactants on the active sites and to a lesser extent to coke deposition."
[6] "When the coke is removed through the calcination of the catalyst, the latter may deactivate further as vanadium oxide species sinter and form larger V2O5 crystallites or mixed oxides such as AlVO4, both of which are less active."
[7] "V2O5 crystallites can revert to active polymeric vanadium species by treating the catalyst under an oxygen atmosphere at 600 C."
[8] "Alumina is commonly used as a support for vanadium oxide catalysts, although Sokolov et al. concluded through testing a wide range of Si- and Al-based supports that using silica to dope the alumina support provides beneficial effects on catalyst stability and activity."
[9] "Furthermore, as was shown by Harlin et al., the performance of supported vanadium catalysts can be improved through the addition of MgO, either as a promoter or as a component of a mixed oxide. According to these workers, the increase in dehydrogenation selectivity stems from the basic nature of MgO, resulting in reduced coke formation."

1.The physicochemical properties of catalysts, including chemical qualities and morphological characteristics, significantly influence their performance in dehydrogenation reactions. The surface area-to-metal loading ratio determines the formation of different vanadium species, which affects the catalytic activity. The presence of hydroxyl groups on the support surface is crucial for the dispersion of the catalyst, as they serve as anchoring sites for vanadium precursors. Large V2O5 crystallites are inactive in deactivation, while the reduction of the catalyst by the hydrocarbon feed results in the formation of V4+ and V3+, which are more active. Initially, deactivation is caused by the strong adsorption of reactants on the active sites and to a lesser extent to coke deposition. When the coke is removed through the calcination of the catalyst, the latter may deactivate further as vanadium oxide species sinter and form larger V2O5 crystallites or mixed oxides, both of which are less active. V2O5 crystallites can revert to active polymeric vanadium species by treating the catalyst under an oxygen atmosphere at 600 C.

1.催化剂的物理化学性质，包括化学品质和形态特征，对脱氢反应的性能有重大影响。表面面积与金属负载比决定了不同钒物种的形成，这影响了催化活性。支撑表面存在羟基对于催化剂的分散至关重要，因为它们作为钒前体的锚定位点。大V2O5晶体在失活中是不活跃的，而催化剂通过烃类进料的还原导致V4+和V3+的形成，这些更活跃。最初，失活是由反应物在活性位点上的强烈吸附和在较小程度上由焦炭沉积引起的。当通过催化剂的煅烧去除焦炭时，后者可能进一步失活，因为钒氧化物种烧结并形成更大的V2O5晶体或如AlVO4的混合氧化物，两者都比较不活跃。V2O5晶体可以通过在600°C的氧气气氛下处理催化剂而恢复为活性的多聚钒物种。使用二氧化硅掺杂氧化铝支撑提供了对催化剂稳定性和活性的有益影响。添加MgO可以改善支撑的钒催化剂的性能，通过减少焦炭形成。

1.The physicochemical properties of catalysts, including chemical qualities and morphological characteristics, significantly influence their performance in dehydrogenation reactions. The nature of the support is crucial as it not only determines the mechanical properties of the catalyst but also affects the interaction between the carrier and the active phase, which can profoundly impact catalyst activity and selectivity. For instance, alumina is the most common support, and the method of producing chromia-alumina catalysts can vary, affecting the catalyst's performance. The choice of support can also influence the catalytic activity, with different supports leading to varying orders of activity based on conversion and yield. Zirconia, as an alternative support, has been investigated for its low surface acidity and enhanced sintering resistance. Silica requires a high surface area to stabilize Cr6+ sites, and mixed oxides prepared using layered double hydroxide precursors have been studied for their catalytic properties in dehydrogenation reactions. The acidity of the support, as seen in chromia-pillared α-zirconium phosphate materials, can also influence catalytic behavior, with strong acid sites affecting cracking reactions and medium strength acid sites impacting dehydrogenation reactions.

2.Support modification strategies can be employed to optimize the properties of catalysts for enhanced catalytic efficiency and selectivity. For example, doping alumina-based dehydrogenation catalysts with alkali ions can effectively poison undesirable acid sites, improving selectivity. Using zirconia as a support can prevent the formation of mixed oxides and offer higher thermal stability and surface area. Silica, with its high surface area, can stabilize Cr6+ sites, while mixed oxides prepared using layered double hydroxide precursors can provide improved coking resistance and thermal stability against sintering. Understanding the role of acidity in catalytic behavior can also guide the modification of supports to favor dehydrogenation reactions over cracking reactions.

2.可以通过载体改性策略来优化催化剂的性质，以提高催化效率和选择性。例如，用碱金属离子掺杂氧化铝基脱氢催化剂可以有效地毒化不希望的酸位点，提高选择性。使用氧化锆作为载体可以防止混合氧化物的形成，并提供更高的热稳定性和表面积。二氧化硅，由于其高表面积，可以稳定Cr6+位点，而使用层状双氢氧化物前体制备的混合氧化物可以提供改善的焦化抗性和抗烧结热稳定性。了解酸性在催化行为中的作用也可以指导载体的改性，以利于脱氢反应而不是裂化反应。
