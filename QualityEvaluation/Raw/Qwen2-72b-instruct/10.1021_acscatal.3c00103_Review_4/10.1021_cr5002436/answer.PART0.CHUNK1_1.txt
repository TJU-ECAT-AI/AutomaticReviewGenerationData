[1] "The surface area-to-metal loading ratio determines which species will form. Indeed, Wu et al. reported that monomeric species are predominantly present below 1.2 V/nm2, polymeric vanadium species prevail between 1.2 and 4.4 V/nm2, and crystalline V2O5 species preponderate at even higher loadings."
[2] "On the one hand, the presence of hydroxyl groups on the surface of the support is important to obtain a well-dispersed catalyst, as OH groups serve as anchoring sites for the vanadium precursors used to prepare these catalysts. On the other hand, acid sites are detrimental for catalyst performance, because they facilitate cracking and induce coke formation."
[3] "Alumina is commonly used as a support for vanadium oxide catalysts, although Sokolov et al. concluded through testing a wide range of Si- and Al-based supports that using silica to dope the alumina support provides beneficial effects on catalyst stability and activity."
[4] "Furthermore, as was shown by Harlin et al., the performance of supported vanadium catalysts can be improved through the addition of MgO, either as a promoter or as a component of a mixed oxide. According to these workers, the increase in dehydrogenation selectivity stems from the basic nature of MgO, resulting in reduced coke formation."
[5] "The reducibility of the vanadium species depends on their molecular structure, VOV and VO bonds being more easily reduced than VO-support bonds."
[6] "The chemistry of molybdenum oxide is comparable to that of vanadium oxide, as Mo can be present as MoOx monomers, polymers, or MoO3 crystallites, depending on the molybdenum loading, the type of support used, and catalyst preparation conditions."
[7] "Harlin et al. noted that optimal activity was achieved with monolayer coverage of molybdenum oxide on an alumina support."
[8] "The reduction of the catalyst with hydrogen prior to reaction increases conversion, although selectivity decreases due to the formation of acid sites."
[9] "The exact nature of the active sites in Ga-based dehydrogenation catalysts is still under debate. Akin to Al2O3, Ga2O3 has different polymorphs of which β-Ga2O3 is not only the most stable, but also the most active Ga species in PDH according to some authors."
[10] "β-Ga2O3 has a monoclinic structure, in which gallium atoms are equally distributed between tetrahedral and octahedral configurations. This crystal structure has a high concentration of weak Lewis acid sites (coordinatively unsaturated tetrahedral ones on the surface of the material), which are deemed to be centers of dehydrogenation activity."
[11] "The assignment of Lewis acid sites as the active species was substantiated by Chen et al., who, by relating the results of NH3-TPD measurements with activity data for different GaxAl10xO15 mixed oxides, showed that a high concentration of Lewis acid groups in the form of coordinatively unsaturated tetrahedral Ga3+ cations is a prerequisite for dehydrogenation activity."
[12] "Xu et al. reported dehydrogenation activity on both Lewis and Brnsted acid sites on GaO3/H-ZSM-5. A zeolitic support displaying a low concentration of medium and strong acid sites and a relatively high concentration of weak acid sites was found to lead to the most active and stable catalyst."
[13] "Michorczyk et al. concluded that acidic groups catalyze the reaction after observing that promotion with a base, such as potassium, resulted in a decrease in activity."
[14] "The structure of the support is also important, as a mesoporous GaAl mixed oxide exhibited an increased resistance to catalyst coking."
[15] "The function of K was to reduce coke formation by poisoning Brnsted acid sites."
[16] "Pt is believed to act as a promoter for the GaOx. Indeed, albeit 1000 ppm Pt/Al2O3 was found to be virtually inactive, 1000 ppm of Pt in combination with 3 wt % Ga afforded conversions close to the equilibrium and an propylene selectivity <95%."
[17] "The role of Pt is to assist hydrogen desorption, which facilitates the regeneration of the gallium hydride hydroxide species."
[18] "The exact nature of the active sites in Ga-based dehydrogenation catalysts is still under debate."
[19] "The chemistry of molybdenum oxide is comparable to that of vanadium oxide, as Mo can be present as MoOx monomers, polymers, or MoO3 crystallites, depending on the molybdenum loading, the type of support used, and catalyst preparation conditions."
[20] "The reducibility of the catalyst with hydrogen prior to reaction increases conversion, although selectivity decreases due to the formation of acid sites."
