[1] "The surface area-to-metal loading ratio determines which species will form. Indeed, Wu et al. reported that monomeric species are predominantly present below 1.2 V/nm2, polymeric vanadium species prevail between 1.2 and 4.4 V/nm2, and crystalline V2O5 species preponderate at even higher loadings."
[2] "On the one hand, the presence of hydroxyl groups on the surface of the support is important to obtain a well-dispersed catalyst, as OH groups serve as anchoring sites for the vanadium precursors used to prepare these catalysts."
[3] "On the contrary, large V2O5 crystallites are practically inactive in dehydrogenation."
[4] "Prior to reaction, the vanadium in these catalysts is generally present as V5+. However, the reduction of the catalyst by the hydrocarbon feed results in the formation of V4+ and V3+."
[5] "Initially, deactivation is caused by the strong adsorption of reactants on the active sites and to a lesser extent to coke deposition."
[6] "When the coke is removed through the calcination of the catalyst, the latter may deactivate further as vanadium oxide species sinter and form larger V2O5 crystallites or mixed oxides such as AlVO4, both of which are less active."
[7] "V2O5 crystallites can revert to active polymeric vanadium species by treating the catalyst under an oxygen atmosphere at 600 C."
[8] "Alumina is commonly used as a support for vanadium oxide catalysts, although Sokolov et al. concluded through testing a wide range of Si- and Al-based supports that using silica to dope the alumina support provides beneficial effects on catalyst stability and activity."
[9] "Furthermore, as was shown by Harlin et al., the performance of supported vanadium catalysts can be improved through the addition of MgO, either as a promoter or as a component of a mixed oxide. According to these workers, the increase in dehydrogenation selectivity stems from the basic nature of MgO, resulting in reduced coke formation."

1.The physicochemical properties of catalysts, including chemical qualities and morphological characteristics, significantly influence their performance in dehydrogenation reactions. The surface area-to-metal loading ratio determines the formation of different vanadium species, which affects the catalytic activity. The presence of hydroxyl groups on the support surface is crucial for the dispersion of the catalyst, as they serve as anchoring sites for vanadium precursors. Large V2O5 crystallites are inactive in deactivation, while the reduction of the catalyst by the hydrocarbon feed results in the formation of V4+ and V3+, which are more active. Initially, deactivation is caused by the strong adsorption of reactants on the active sites and to a lesser extent to coke deposition. When the coke is removed through the calcination of the catalyst, the latter may deactivate further as vanadium oxide species sinter and form larger V2O5 crystallites or mixed oxides, both of which are less active. V2O5 crystallites can revert to active polymeric vanadium species by treating the catalyst under an oxygen atmosphere at 600 C. Using silica to dope the alumina support provides beneficial effects on catalyst stability and activity. The addition of MgO can improve the performance of supported vanadium catalysts by reducing coke formation.

1.催化剂的物理化学性质，包括化学品质和形态特征，对脱氢反应的性能有重大影响。表面面积与金属负载比决定了不同钒物种的形成，这影响了催化活性。支撑表面存在羟基对于催化剂的分散至关重要，因为它们作为钒前体的锚定位点。大V2O5晶体在失活中是不活跃的，而催化剂通过烃类进料的还原导致V4+和V3+的形成，这些更活跃。最初，失活是由反应物在活性位点上的强烈吸附和在较小程度上由焦炭沉积引起的。当通过催化剂的煅烧去除焦炭时，后者可能进一步失活，因为钒氧化物种烧结并形成更大的V2O5晶体或如AlVO4的混合氧化物，两者都比较不活跃。V2O5晶体可以通过在600°C的氧气气氛下处理催化剂而恢复为活性的多聚钒物种。使用二氧化硅掺杂氧化铝支撑提供了对催化剂稳定性和活性的有益影响。添加MgO可以改善支撑的钒催化剂的性能，通过减少焦炭形成。
