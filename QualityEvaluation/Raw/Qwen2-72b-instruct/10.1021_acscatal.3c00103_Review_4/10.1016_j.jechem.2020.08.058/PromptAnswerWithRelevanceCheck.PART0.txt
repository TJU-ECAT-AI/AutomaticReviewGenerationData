[1] "The acidity of Si-Beta, 0.1Pt/Si-Beta, 2Zn/Si-Beta and 0.1Pt-2Zn/Si-Beta samples were evaluated by means of NH3-TPD and the results are shown in Fig. 3 (c). Parent H-Beta demonstrates two NH3 desorption peaks, revealing the presence of both weak and strong acid sites, respectively (not shown here) [37] ,[38] ,[39] ,[40] ,[41] . After the complete dealumination of H-Beta, no desorption peaks could be observed for the resulting Si-Beta sample due to the absence of acid sites [42] . Subsequently, the introduction of a small amount of Pt species to the Si-Beta support results in the appearance of trace medium acid sites (NH3 desorption peak centered at 523 K) and the introduction of Zn results in the appearance of higher amount of Lewis acid sites (NH3 desorption peak centered at 423 K). With the introduction of Pt into 2Zn/Si-Beta, an ammonia desorption peak centered at 443 K with much higher intensity could be observed on 0.1Pt-2Zn/Si-Beta. With electrons transfer from Zn species to Pt species, the Zn species become electron-deficient and Lewis acidic thereof. In other word, the observed Lewis acidity in 0.1Pt-2Zn/Si-Beta as compared to 2Zn/Si-Beta should indicate the strong interaction between Pt and Zn species on the Si-Beta support."
[2] "The morphology of the zeolite support and the dispersion of Pt and Zn species on Si-Beta support were directly investigated by electron microscopy and the representative results are shown in Fig. 2 . Generally, 0.1Pt-2Zn/Si-Beta appears as small aggregates of below 100 nm. In the HR-TEM image, homogeneously dispersed dark dots of 1  2.5 nm could be observed. STEM mapping analyses reveal the presence of both highly-dispersed Zn species (<1 nm) and small aggregates (1  2.5 nm). Meanwhile, no aggregation of Pt species could be observed due to its high dispersion and low loading. Obviously, Pt and Zn species appear in the overlapped locations, hinting to the close contact between Pt and Zn species on Si-Beta zeolite support."
[3] "The evolution the silanol groups after dealumination and metal incorporation procedures was monitored by infrared spectroscopy to disclosed the formation of Pt-Zn species on Si-Beta zeolite."
[4] "The local electronic environment of Pt is of great significance for PDH process. In this study, the local electronic environment of Pt was investigated by FTIR spectra of CO adsorption, which is reliable for the discrimination of highly dispersed Pt centers and large metal bulks even at very low Pt loading."
[5] "The XRD patterns of the parent H-Beta, Si-Beta, Zn/Si-Beta, and Pt-Zn/Si-Beta are shown in Fig. 1 (a). Typical diffraction lines characteristic for the BEA topology are observed for all samples, while a noticeable decline in the intensity could be observed after the introduction of Zn species. For 0.1Pt-2Zn/Si-Beta, no diffraction lines corresponding to metal oxides or alloys could be detected due to the low loadings and high dispersion of species on the support [27] ."
[6] "The well-preserved microporous BEA topology structure of Beta are confirmed by the argon adsorptiondesorption measurement. As shown in Fig. 1 (b), all samples under study showed similar type I isotherms, revealing the typical microporous structure."
[7] "The surface areas of zeolite samples were determined by argon adsorption/desorption isotherms at 87 K collected on a Quantachrome iQ-MP gas adsorption analyzer. The Brunauer Emmett Teller (BET) method was used to calculate the total surface area and the t-plot method was employed to calculate the micropore properties."
[8] "The FTIR transmittance spectra in the framework vibration region (800  1400 cm1) of selected zeolite samples. No obvious band in the range of 900  1000 cm1 occurs on H-Beta sample, while a new FTIR band center at  960 cm1 appear for the Si-Beta sample due to the formation of abundant silanol defects from framework dealumination [23] ,[30] ,[31] . Subsequently, the IR band at  960 cm1 disappears on 2Zn/Si-Beta with the introduction of Zn species, indicating the strong interaction between Zn species and the silanols [32] . That is, the Zn species are stabilized by interaction with silanols with the formation of Si-O-Zn linkages, as revealed by UVvis spectra."

1.The acidity of the catalysts was evaluated using NH3-TPD. Parent H-Beta has both weak and strong acid sites. After dealumination, Si-Beta lacks acid sites. The introduction of Pt species creates medium acid sites, while Zn species introduce Lewis acid sites. The presence of Pt in 2Zn/Si-Beta increases the intensity of the Lewis acid sites, indicating strong interaction between Pt and Zn species.
2.Electron microscopy shows that 0.1Pt-2Zn/Si-Beta has small aggregates below 100 nm. Pt and Zn species are highly dispersed and have close contact on the Si-Beta support.
3.Infrared spectroscopy was used to monitor the evolution of silanol groups after dealumination and metal incorporation, revealing the formation of Pt-Zn species on Si-Beta zeolite.
4.The local electronic environment of Pt is significant for the PDH process and was investigated using FTIR spectra of CO adsorption.
5.XRD patterns show typical diffraction lines for the BEA topology, with a decline in intensity after Zn introduction. For 0.1Pt-2Zn/Si-Beta, no metal oxide or alloy diffraction lines were detected due to low loadings and high dispersion.
6.Argon adsorption-desorption measurement confirms the well-preserved microporous BEA topology structure of Beta zeolite.
7.Surface areas of zeolite samples were determined using argon adsorption/desorption isotherms, with the BET method for total surface area and the t-plot method for micropore properties.
8.FTIR transmittance spectra show the formation of silanol defects from framework dealumination in Si-Beta, which disappear upon Zn introduction, indicating strong interaction between Zn species and silanols.

1.催化剂的酸性通过NH3-TPD进行评估。母体H-Beta具有弱酸性和强酸性位点。经过脱铝后，Si-Beta缺乏酸性位点。引入Pt物种会形成中等酸性位点，而Zn物种会引入Lewis酸性位点。2Zn/Si-Beta中Pt的存在增加了Lewis酸性位点的强度，表明Pt和Zn物种之间有强烈的相互作用。
2.电子显微镜显示0.1Pt-2Zn/Si-Beta具有小于100纳米的小聚集体。Pt和Zn物种在Si-Beta支撑上高度分散且有紧密接触。
3.红外光谱用于监测脱铝和金属掺入后硅醇基团的演变，揭示了Pt-Zn物种在Si-Beta沸石上的形成。
4.Pt的局部电子环境对PDH过程具有重要意义，并通过CO吸附的FTIR光谱进行研究。
5.XRD图案显示了BEA拓扑的典型衍射线，Zn引入后强度下降。对于0.1Pt-2Zn/Si-Beta，由于负载量低和分散度高，未检测到金属氧化物或合金的衍射线。
6.氩气吸附-脱附测量证实了Beta沸石的微孔BEA拓扑结构保存良好。
7.沸石样品的表面积通过87K下的氩气吸附-脱附等温线确定，BET方法用于计算总表面积，t-plot方法用于计算微孔性质。
8.FTIR透射光谱显示Si-Beta中框架脱铝形成的硅醇缺陷，Zn引入后消失，表明Zn物种与硅醇之间有强烈的相互作用。

[1] "The acidity of Si-Beta, 0.1Pt/Si-Beta, 2Zn/Si-Beta and 0.1Pt-2Zn/Si-Beta samples were evaluated by means of NH3-TPD and the results are shown in Fig. 3 (c). Parent H-Beta demonstrates two NH3 desorption peaks, revealing the presence of both weak and strong acid sites, respectively (not shown here) [37] ,[38] ,[39] ,[40] ,[41] . After the complete dealumination of H-Beta, no desorption peaks could be observed for the resulting Si-Beta sample due to the absence of acid sites [42] . Subsequently, the introduction of a small amount of Pt species to the Si-Beta support results in the appearance of trace medium acid sites (NH3 desorption peak centered at 523 K) and the introduction of Zn results in the appearance of higher amount of Lewis acid sites (NH3 desorption peak centered at 423 K). With the introduction of Pt into 2Zn/Si-Beta, an ammonia desorption peak centered at 443 K with much higher intensity could be observed on 0.1Pt-2Zn/Si-Beta. With electrons transfer from Zn species to Pt species, the Zn species become electron-deficient and Lewis acidic thereof. In other word, the observed Lewis acidity in 0.1Pt-2Zn/Si-Beta as compared to 2Zn/Si-Beta should indicate the strong interaction between Pt and Zn species on the Si-Beta support."
[2] "The morphology of the zeolite support and the dispersion of Pt and Zn species on Si-Beta support were directly investigated by electron microscopy and the representative results are shown in Fig. 2 . Generally, 0.1Pt-2Zn/Si-Beta appears as small aggregates of below 100 nm. In the HR-TEM image, homogeneously dispersed dark dots of 1  2.5 nm could be observed. STEM mapping analyses reveal the presence of both highly-dispersed Zn species (<1 nm) and small aggregates (1  2.5 nm). Meanwhile, no aggregation of Pt species could be observed due to its high dispersion and low loading. Obviously, Pt and Zn species appear in the overlapped locations, hinting to the close contact between Pt and Zn species on Si-Beta zeolite support."
[3] "The evolution the silanol groups after dealumination and metal incorporation procedures was monitored by infrared spectroscopy to disclosed the formation of Pt-Zn species on Si-Beta zeolite."
[4] "The local electronic environment of Pt is of great significance for PDH process. In this study, the local electronic environment of Pt was investigated by FTIR spectra of CO adsorption, which is reliable for the discrimination of highly dispersed Pt centers and large metal bulks even at very low Pt loading."
[5] "The XRD patterns of the parent H-Beta, Si-Beta, Zn/Si-Beta, and Pt-Zn/Si-Beta are shown in Fig. 1 (a). Typical diffraction lines characteristic for the BEA topology are observed for all samples, while a noticeable decline in the intensity could be observed after the introduction of Zn species."
[6] "The surface areas of zeolite samples were determined by argon adsorption/desorption isotherms at 87 K collected on a Quantachrome iQ-MP gas adsorption analyzer. The Brunauer Emmett Teller (BET) method was used to calculate the total surface area and the t-plot method was employed to calculate the micropore properties."
[7] "The detailed textural properties of Si-Beta, and M/Si-Beta samples are summarized in Table S1 . All samples exhibit similar high surface areas of 553  616 m2 g1 and large micropore volumes of 0.3510.413 cm3 g1, indicating the well preserved microporous structure of Beta zeolite after dealumination and metal incorporation."
[8] "The introduction of Pt species via impregnation does not change the dispersion of Zn species on Si-Beta support."
[9] "The close contact between Pt-Zn species and the electronic interaction thereof make Pt-Zn/Si-Beta robust PDH catalysts."

1.The acidity of the catalysts was evaluated by NH3-TPD. Parent H-Beta has both weak and strong acid sites. After dealumination, Si-Beta has no acid sites. The introduction of Pt species results in trace medium acid sites, and the introduction of Zn results in higher amounts of Lewis acid sites. The introduction of Pt into 2Zn/Si-Beta leads to an ammonia desorption peak with much higher intensity, indicating the strong interaction between Pt and Zn species on the Si-Beta support.
2.The morphology of the zeolite support and the dispersion of Pt and Zn species on Si-Beta support were investigated by electron microscopy. 0.1Pt-2Zn/Si-Beta appears as small aggregates of below 100 nm. Pt and Zn species have close contact on Si-Beta zeolite support.

1.通过NH3-TPD评估了催化剂的酸性。母体H-Beta具有弱酸性和强酸性位点。经过脱铝后，Si-Beta没有酸性位点。引入Pt物种导致微量中等酸性位点的出现，引入Zn导致更高量的Lewis酸性位点的出现。将Pt引入2Zn/Si-Beta会导致氨脱附峰的强度大大增加，表明Pt和Zn物种在Si-Beta支撑上存在强烈的相互作用。
2.通过电子显微镜研究了沸石支撑的形态和Pt和Zn物种在Si-Beta支撑上的分散情况。0.1Pt-2Zn/Si-Beta表现为小于100纳米的小聚集体。Pt和Zn物种在Si-Beta沸石支撑上具有紧密的接触。
3.通过红外光谱监测了脱铝和金属掺入后硅醇基团的演变，揭示了Pt-Zn物种在Si-Beta沸石上的形成。
4.Pt的局部电子环境对PDH过程具有重要意义。通过CO吸附的FTIR光谱研究了Pt的局部电子环境。
5.母体H-Beta、Si-Beta、Zn/Si-Beta和Pt-Zn/Si-Beta的XRD图谱显示了BEA拓扑结构的典型衍射线。引入Zn物种后，衍射线的强度下降。
6.通过87K的氩气吸附/脱附等温线确定了沸石样品的表面积。所有样品都具有相似的高表面积和大微孔体积，表明脱铝和金属掺入后Beta沸石的微孔结构得到了很好的保存。
7.通过浸渍引入Pt物种不会改变Zn物种在Si-Beta支撑上的分散。
8.Pt-Zn物种之间的紧密接触和电子相互作用使Pt-Zn/Si-Beta成为PDH催化剂的稳健选择。
