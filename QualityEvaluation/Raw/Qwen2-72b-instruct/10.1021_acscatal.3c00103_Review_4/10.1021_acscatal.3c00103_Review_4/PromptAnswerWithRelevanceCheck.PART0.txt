[1] "The physicochemical properties of catalysts have a significant impact on their catalytic behaviors. Chemical qualities, including acid strength and hydrothermal and pH stability, affect the selectivity toward the targeted alkene in dehydrogenation reactions, while the morphological and porous qualities can influence the diffusion efficiency."
[2] "In this section, strategies focused on support modification for dehydrogenation catalysts are summarized (Table 3)."
[3] "PDH is an acid-sensitive reaction, which signifies that proper acidity of the support is preferable for CH activation and propylene desorption, while unduly strong acidity, on the other hand, can generate a negative impact on the PDH process, possibly leading to CC cracking and deep dehydrogenation."
[4] "As for zeolites, the Lewis acid sites are preferable for propane dehydrogenation, while the Brnsted acid sites are inductive factors in catalyzing cleavage reactions."
[5] "For heterogeneous catalysts, one kinetic factor, the diffusion efficiency of the reactants and products, which is determined by the morphology, structure, size, and chemical properties of the supports, should be taken into consideration."
[6] "Several strategies are proposed, focusing on shortening the diffusion path or diffusion resistance, including developing nanosized supports and synthesizing supports with particular morphologies and high external surfaces, e.g., needle-shaped, sheet-shaped, and mesh-shaped structures."

1.The physicochemical properties of catalysts, including chemical qualities and morphological characteristics, significantly influence their performance in dehydrogenation reactions. Chemical qualities, such as acid strength and stability, affect the selectivity toward the targeted alkene, while morphological and porous qualities influence the diffusion efficiency. Support modification strategies, summarized in Table 3, can be employed to optimize these properties for enhanced catalytic efficiency and selectivity. For instance, adjusting the acidity of the support is crucial for proper CH activation and propylene desorption in PDH reactions, as excessive acidity can lead to negative impacts such as CC cracking and deep dehydrogenation. In zeolites, Lewis acid sites are favorable for propane dehydrogenation, whereas Brnsted acid sites catalyze cleavage reactions. To improve diffusion efficiency, strategies include developing nanosized supports and synthesizing supports with specific morphologies and high external surfaces.

1.催化剂的物理化学性质，包括化学性质和形态特征，对脱氢反应的性能有重大影响。化学性质，如酸强度和稳定性，影响对目标烯烃的选择性，而形态和多孔性质影响扩散效率。可以采用支撑改性策略来优化这些性质，以提高催化效率和选择性，如表3所示。例如，调整支撑的酸性对于PDH反应中适当的CH活化和丙烯解吸至关重要，而过强的酸性可能对PDH过程产生负面影响，可能导致CC裂解和深度脱氢。对于沸石，Lewis酸位有利于丙烷脱氢，而Brnsted酸位催化裂解反应。为了提高扩散效率，策略包括开发纳米尺寸的支撑和合成具有特定形态和高外部表面的支撑。
