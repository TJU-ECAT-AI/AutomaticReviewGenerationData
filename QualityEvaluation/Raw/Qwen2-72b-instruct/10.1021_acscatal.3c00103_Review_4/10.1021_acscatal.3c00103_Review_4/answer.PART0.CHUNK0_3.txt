[1] "The physicochemical properties of catalysts have a significant impact on their catalytic behaviors. Chemical qualities, including acid strength and hydrothermal and pH stability, affect the selectivity toward the targeted alkene in dehydrogenation reactions, while the morphological and porous qualities can influence the diffusion efficiency."
[2] "In this section, strategies focused on support modification for dehydrogenation catalysts are summarized (Table 3)."
[3] "PDH is an acid-sensitive reaction, which signifies that proper acidity of the support is preferable for CH activation and propylene desorption, while unduly strong acidity, on the other hand, can generate a negative impact on the PDH process, possibly leading to CC cracking and deep dehydrogenation."
[4] "For heterogeneous catalysts, one kinetic factor, the diffusion efficiency of the reactants and products, which is determined by the morphology, structure, size, and chemical properties of the supports, should be taken into consideration."
[5] "Several strategies are proposed, focusing on shortening the diffusion path or diffusion resistance, including developing nanosized supports and synthesizing supports with particular morphologies and high external surfaces, e.g., needle-shaped, sheet-shaped, and mesh-shaped structures."

1.The physicochemical properties of catalysts, including chemical qualities such as acid strength and stability, and morphological characteristics, significantly impact their performance in dehydrogenation reactions. Acid strength and stability affect the selectivity towards the targeted alkene, while morphological and porous qualities influence the diffusion efficiency. Support modification strategies for dehydrogenation catalysts include adjusting acidity and regulating morphology and porosity to optimize these properties for enhanced catalytic efficiency and selectivity.
