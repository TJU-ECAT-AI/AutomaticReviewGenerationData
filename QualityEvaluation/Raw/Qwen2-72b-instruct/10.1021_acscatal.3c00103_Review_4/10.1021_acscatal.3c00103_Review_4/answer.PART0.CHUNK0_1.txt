[1] "The physicochemical properties of catalysts have a significant impact on their catalytic behaviors. Chemical qualities, including acid strength and hydrothermal and pH stability, affect the selectivity toward the targeted alkene in dehydrogenation reactions, while the morphological and porous qualities can influence the diffusion efficiency."
[2] "In this section, strategies focused on support modification for dehydrogenation catalysts are summarized (Table 3)."
[3] "PDH is an acid-sensitive reaction, which signifies that proper acidity of the support is preferable for CH activation and propylene desorption, while unduly strong acidity, on the other hand, can generate a negative impact on the PDH process, possibly leading to CC cracking and deep dehydrogenation."
[4] "For heterogeneous catalysts, one kinetic factor, the diffusion efficiency of the reactants and products, which is determined by the morphology, structure, size, and chemical properties of the supports, should be taken into consideration."
[5] "Several strategies are proposed, focusing on shortening the diffusion path or diffusion resistance, including developing nanosized supports and synthesizing supports with particular morphologies and high external surfaces, e.g., needle-shaped, sheet-shaped, and mesh-shaped structures."

1.The physicochemical properties of catalysts significantly impact their catalytic behaviors in dehydrogenation reactions. Chemical qualities, such as acid strength and stability, affect the selectivity toward the targeted alkene, while morphological and porous qualities influence the diffusion efficiency. Strategies for support modification, summarized in Table 3, include acidity adjustment, morphology regulation, and porosity regulation. Proper acidity is crucial for CH activation and propylene desorption, while excessive acidity can negatively impact the PDH process, leading to cracking and deep dehydrogenation. For heterogeneous catalysts, the diffusion efficiency of reactants and products, determined by the morphology, structure, size, and chemical properties of the supports, is a critical kinetic factor. Strategies to optimize these properties include developing nanosized supports and synthesizing supports with specific morphologies and high external surfaces.

1.催化剂的物理化学性质对其在脱氢反应中的催化行为有重大影响。化学性质，如酸强度和稳定性，影响对目标烯烃的选择性，而形态和多孔性质影响扩散效率。支持修改策略，如表3所示，包括酸度调整、形态调节和孔隙率调节。适当的酸度对CH活化和丙烯解吸至关重要，而过强的酸度可能对PDH过程产生负面影响，导致裂解和深度脱氢。对于异质催化剂，反应物和产物的扩散效率，由支持物的形态、结构、大小和化学性质决定，是一个关键的动力学因素。优化这些性质的策略包括开发纳米尺寸的支持物和合成具有特定形态和高外部表面的支持物。
