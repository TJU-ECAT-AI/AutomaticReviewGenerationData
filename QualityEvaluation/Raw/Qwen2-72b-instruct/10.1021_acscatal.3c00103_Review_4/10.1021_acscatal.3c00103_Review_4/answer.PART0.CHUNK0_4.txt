[1] "The physicochemical properties of catalysts have a significant impact on their catalytic behaviors. Chemical qualities, including acid strength and hydrothermal and pH stability, affect the selectivity toward the targeted alkene in dehydrogenation reactions, while the morphological and porous qualities can influence the diffusion efficiency."
[2] "In this section, strategies focused on support modification for dehydrogenation catalysts are summarized (Table 3)."
[3] "PDH is an acid-sensitive reaction, which signifies that proper acidity of the support is preferable for CH activation and propylene desorption, while unduly strong acidity, on the other hand, can generate a negative impact on the PDH process, possibly leading to CC cracking and deep dehydrogenation."
[4] "For heterogeneous catalysts, one kinetic factor, the diffusion efficiency of the reactants and products, which is determined by the morphology, structure, size, and chemical properties of the supports, should be taken into consideration."
[5] "Several strategies are proposed, focusing on shortening the diffusion path or diffusion resistance, including developing nanosized supports and synthesizing supports with particular morphologies and high external surfaces, e.g., needle-shaped, sheet-shaped, and mesh-shaped structures."

1.The physicochemical properties of catalysts, including chemical qualities and morphological characteristics, significantly impact their performance in dehydrogenation reactions. Chemical qualities, such as acid strength and stability, affect the selectivity toward the targeted alkene, while morphological and porous qualities influence the diffusion efficiency. Strategies for support modification, summarized in Table 3, can optimize these properties for enhanced catalytic efficiency and selectivity. For instance, adjusting the acidity of the support is crucial for proper CH activation and propylene desorption in PDH reactions, as excessive acidity can lead to cracking and deep dehydrogenation. Additionally, modifying the morphology and porosity of the support can improve diffusion efficiency, which is a critical factor for heterogeneous catalysts. This can be achieved by developing nanosized supports or synthesizing supports with specific morphologies and high external surfaces.

1.催化剂的物理化学性质，包括化学性质和形态特征，对脱氢反应的性能有重大影响。化学性质，如酸强度和稳定性，影响对目标烯烃的选择性，而形态和多孔性质影响扩散效率。表3中总结的支持修改策略可以优化这些性质，以提高催化效率和选择性。例如，调整支持物的酸度对于PDH反应中适当的CH活化和丙烯解吸至关重要，因为过强的酸度可能导致裂解和深度脱氢。此外，通过开发纳米尺寸的支持物或合成具有特定形态和高外部表面的支持物，可以改善支持物的形态和孔隙度，从而提高扩散效率，这对于异质催化剂来说是一个关键因素。
