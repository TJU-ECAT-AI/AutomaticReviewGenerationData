[1] "Although the steam reforming process is now widely used in the modern chemical industry, other alternative routes to process methane are still quite challenging. Such alternative processes include, among others, the direct conversion of methane to other valuable chemicals or the dry CO2 reforming which not only reduces greenhouse emission but also produces a H2/CO mixture with a H2/CO ratio adequate for the FischerTropsch process."
[2] "The robustness against coking can be increased with additional promoters, such as late transition metals, main-group metals including Sn and Ga, alkali-metal oxides and rare-earth metal oxides."
[3] "The existence of Au atoms shifts down the d band of alloys, which weakens the interaction between σ* of CH bond and d states of surface metal atoms. Thus, the transition state gains less stabilization from surface atoms, and finally results in an increase of the dissociation barrier height."
[4] "The calculated CHC dissociation barrier is 138 kJ mol1, higher than the dehydrogenation barrier to form CHC, indicating possible accumulation of CHC during this conversion, which is in good agreement with experimental observations."
[5] "The reason is that DFT results discussed here did not include thermodynamic correction, which would significantly reduce the free energy barrier for desorption steps due to the large entropy of gas phase propylene compared with the adsorbed ones."

1.The physicochemical properties of catalysts, including chemical qualities and morphological characteristics, significantly influence their performance in dehydrogenation reactions. Catalysts with higher d-band centers tend to bind intermediates and transition states more strongly, leading to lower dehydrogenation barriers. However, too high dehydrogenation activity can result in uncontrolled deep dehydrogenation and coke formation. Support modification strategies, such as alloying with late transition metals, main-group metals like Sn and Ga, alkali-metal oxides, and rare-earth metal oxides, can optimize these properties for enhanced catalytic efficiency and selectivity. These strategies can increase the robustness against coking and adjust the electronic structure of the catalyst, influencing the interaction between the catalyst and the reacting molecules.

1.催化剂的物理化学性质，包括化学品质和形态特征，对脱氢反应的性能有重大影响。具有较高d带中心的催化剂倾向于更强烈地结合中间体和过渡态，导致较低的脱氢能垒。然而，过高的脱氢活性可能导致不受控制的深度脱氢和焦炭形成。通过与晚期过渡金属、主族金属（如锡和镓）、碱金属氧化物和稀土金属氧化物合金化等支持改性策略，可以优化这些性质，以提高催化效率和选择性。这些策略可以增加对焦炭形成的抗性，并调整催化剂的电子结构，影响催化剂与反应分子之间的相互作用。
