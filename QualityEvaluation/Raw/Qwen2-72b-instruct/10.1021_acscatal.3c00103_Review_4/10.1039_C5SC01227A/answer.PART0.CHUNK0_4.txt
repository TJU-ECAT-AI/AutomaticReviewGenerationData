[1] "Although the steam reforming process is now widely used in the modern chemical industry, other alternative routes to process methane are still quite challenging. Such alternative processes include, among others, the direct conversion of methane to other valuable chemicals or the dry CO2 reforming which not only reduces greenhouse emission but also produces a H2/CO mixture with a H2/CO ratio adequate for the FischerTropsch process."
[2] "The robustness against coking can be increased with additional promoters, such as late transition metals, main-group metals including Sn and Ga, alkali-metal oxides and rare-earth metal oxides."
[3] "The later developed revised PBE functional (RPBE17) improves the reproducibility of experimental binding energies for surface species."
[4] "The energetics obtained directly from DFT calculations describe the potential energy surface at 0 K and 0 bar. To describe a chemical process under realistic reaction conditions, thermodynamic corrections are necessary, which includes the zero point energy as well as the contributions to enthalpy and entropy at higher temperature and pressure."
[5] "The most widely used metals used in commercial PDH catalysts include supported Pt or CrOx. Although supported Pt catalysts show high activity, the catalyst deactivation due to coke formation remains a challenging issue."
[6] "The robustness against coking can be increased with additional promoters, such as late transition metals, main-group metals including Sn and Ga, alkali-metal oxides and rare-earth metal oxides."
[7] "The existence of Au atoms shifts down the d band of alloys, which weakens the interaction between σ* of CH bond and d states of surface metal atoms. Thus, the transition state gains less stabilization from surface atoms, and finally results in an increase of the dissociation barrier height."
[8] "The calculated CHC dissociation barrier is 138 kJ mol1, higher than the dehydrogenation barrier to form CHC, indicating possible accumulation of CHC during this conversion, which is in good agreement with experimental observations."
[9] "The calculated binding energy indicates that the strongest binding occur on ad-row atoms. The discrepancy was explained by the formation of an agostic bond, which is a three-center CHmetal interaction normally with two electrons."
[10] "The enhanced activity on alloys does not seem to be unique for PtIr(111). Similar lower barriers on alloy surfaces were also observed on PdNi(111) and NiCu(111), while in the case of NiCo(111), the barriers are similar to those on Ni(111)."
[11] "The PtCu catalyst inhibits the adsorption of formed propylene, and thus suppresses the secondary cracking reactions from propylene towards lighter hydrocarbons. Thus, this reduced interaction between the product and the catalysts enhances the anti-coking ability of the catalyst."
[12] "The lower reactivity (i.e. higher dehydrogenation barrier) on PtSn alloy is due to the deeper d-band center compared to pure Pt."
[13] "The stability of metal oxides or hydride clusters is also influenced by the structure of the zeolite framework."
[14] "The weak binding of the intermediate on such sites favors the desorption of H2. Considering these two opposite effects, calculations suggested that the optimal AlAl distance to be 453 pm corresponding to a minimum overall barrier, and a simple structure-to-activity correlation based on the Sabatier principle was proposed."
[15] "The existence of B atoms may prevent the deposition of carbonaceous species on Co, comparable to the case for Ni described above."
[16] "The presence of on-surface carbonaceous species of the formula CHx (x = 03) have been discussed to influence the activity of a catalyst."
[17] "The ultimate goal for theoretical studies is to identify optimal catalysts for particular chemical processes."
[18] "The continuing improvements of computer hardware, the development of new functionals, as well as the increasing sophistication of computational electronic structure software have insured the ability of a computational study to access more complicated catalytic systems beyond simple transition-metal surfaces."
[19] "The lattice mismatch between the particle and support results in a shift of relative positions between sites on particle and surface, which results in different environments of given sites, leading to a large number of possibilities to be considered in a single study."
[20] "The complexity of the systems mentioned above seems to beyond the ability to completely scan the potential energy surfaces to a large extent with DFT calculations, which limits most of the current studies which focus to understand one aspect of the catalyst instead of the complete picture of dehydrogenation."

1.The physicochemical properties of catalysts, including chemical qualities (such as acid strength and stability) and morphological characteristics, play a crucial role in determining their performance in dehydrogenation reactions. For instance, the stability of metal oxides or hydride clusters is influenced by the structure of the zeolite framework, which can affect the catalytic activity. The weak binding of intermediates on certain sites can favor the desorption of H2, which is beneficial for the catalytic process. The optimal distance between active sites, such as AlAl distance in zeolites, can minimize the overall barrier for the reaction, leading to enhanced catalytic efficiency. The stability and reactivity of the catalyst can be improved by alloying with other metals, such as PtSn, which can increase the d-band center and result in higher dehydrogenation barriers. The presence of certain elements, such as B, can prevent the deposition of carbonaceous species on the catalyst surface, reducing the risk of coking and improving the anti-coking ability of the catalyst. The use of advanced computational methods, such as DFT calculations, can help to identify optimal catalysts for specific chemical processes by considering factors such as the stability of metal oxides or hydride clusters, the binding strength of intermediates, and the optimal distance between active sites. However, the complexity of the systems, such as the lattice mismatch between the particle and support, can limit the ability to completely scan the potential energy surfaces with DFT calculations, which may require further development of computational approaches.
2.Support modification strategies can be employed to optimize the physicochemical properties of catalysts for enhanced catalytic efficiency and selectivity. For example, the addition of promoters, such as late transition metals, main-group metals including Sn and Ga, alkali-metal oxides, and rare-earth metal oxides, can increase the robustness against coking. The use of alloying can also improve the stability and reactivity of the catalyst by increasing the d-band center and resulting in higher dehydrogenation barriers. The presence of certain elements, such as B, can prevent the deposition of carbonaceous species on the catalyst surface, reducing the risk of coking and improving the anti-coking ability of the catalyst. The use of advanced computational methods, such as DFT calculations, can help to identify optimal support modification strategies by considering factors such as the stability of metal oxides or hydride clusters, the binding strength of intermediates, and the optimal distance between active sites.

1.催化剂的物理化学性质，包括化学品质（如酸强度和稳定性）和形态特征，在决定脱氢反应中的催化剂性能方面起着至关重要的作用。例如，金属氧化物或氢化物簇的稳定性受沸石框架结构的影响，这可能影响催化活性。在某些位点上，中间体的弱结合有利于H2的解吸，这对催化过程是有利的。例如，沸石中AlAl距离的最优距离可以将总体反应势垒降至最低，从而提高催化效率。通过与其他金属合金化，如PtSn，可以提高催化剂的稳定性和反应性，增加d带中心，导致更高的脱氢势垒。某些元素的存在，如B，可以防止催化剂表面沉积碳质物质，降低结焦的风险，提高催化剂的抗结焦能力。使用先进的计算方法，如DFT计算，可以帮助识别特定化学过程的最优催化剂，考虑金属氧化物或氢化物簇的稳定性、中间体的结合强度以及活性位点之间的最优距离等因素。然而，系统的复杂性，如颗粒与支撑之间的晶格不匹配，可能限制使用DFT计算完全扫描势能面的能力，这可能需要进一步发展计算方法。
