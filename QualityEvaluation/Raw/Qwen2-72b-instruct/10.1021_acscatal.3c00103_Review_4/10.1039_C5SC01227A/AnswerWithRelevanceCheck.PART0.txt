          The physicochemical properties of catalysts, including chemical qualities (such as acid strength and stability) and morphological characteristics, significantly influence their performance in dehydrogenation reactions. For instance, the stability of metal oxides or hydride clusters is influenced by the structure of the zeolite framework, and the pore size of zeolites has a slight effect on the catalytic activity, with lower activation barriers for reactions in zeolites with larger pore size. The optimal distance between active sites, such as AlAl distance in zeolites, can be determined to achieve a minimum overall barrier, based on the Sabatier principle. The ultimate goal of theoretical studies is to identify optimal catalysts for specific chemical processes, and the advancements in computational approaches have enabled the exploration of more complex catalytic systems beyond simple transition-metal surfaces. Case studies have provided insights into dehydrogenation mechanisms in these systems, revealing information that is challenging to obtain at the molecular level even with advanced experimental equipment.

          催化剂的物理化学性质，包括化学品质（如酸强度和稳定性）和形态特征，对脱氢反应的性能有重大影响。例如，金属氧化物或氢化物簇的稳定性受沸石框架结构的影响，沸石的孔径大小对催化活性有轻微影响，孔径较大的沸石反应的活化能较低。沸石中活性位点（如AlAl距离）的最优距离可以根据萨巴蒂尔原理确定，以达到最小的整体能垒。理论研究的最终目标是为特定化学过程识别最优催化剂，计算方法的进步使我们能够探索比简单过渡金属表面更复杂的催化系统。案例研究为这些系统中的脱氢机制提供了见解，揭示了即使是使用最先进的实验设备也难以在分子水平上获得的信息。

          Support modification strategies can be employed to optimize the physicochemical properties of catalysts for enhanced catalytic efficiency and selectivity. For example, the robustness against coking can be increased by adding promoters such as late transition metals, main-group metals including Sn and Ga, alkali-metal oxides, and rare-earth metal oxides. The existence of Au atoms in alloys shifts down the d band, weakening the interaction between σ* of CH bond and d states of surface metal atoms, resulting in an increase in the dissociation barrier height. The lower reactivity (i.e., higher dehydrogenation barrier) on PtSn alloy is due to the deeper d-band center compared to pure Pt. The PtCu catalyst inhibits the adsorption of formed propylene, suppressing secondary cracking reactions from propylene towards lighter hydrocarbons, which enhances the anti-coking ability of the catalyst. The weak binding of intermediates on certain sites favors the desorption of H2, and calculations have suggested an optimal AlAl distance in zeolites for a minimum overall barrier, based on the Sabatier principle.

          可以通过支持体改性策略来优化催化剂的物理化学性质，以提高催化效率和选择性。例如，通过添加促进剂，如晚期过渡金属、主族金属（包括锡和镓）、碱金属氧化物和稀土金属氧化物，可以提高抗焦炭性能。合金中Au原子的存在会降低d带，削弱σ* CH键与表面金属原子d态之间的相互作用，导致解离能垒升高。PtSn合金的较低反应性（即较高的脱氢能垒）是由于其d带中心较深，与纯Pt相比。PtCu催化剂抑制了形成的丙烯吸附，从而抑制了从丙烯到较轻烃类的二次裂解反应，增强了催化剂的抗焦炭能力。某些位点上中间体的弱结合有利于H2的解吸，计算表明沸石中AlAl距离的最优值对应最小的整体能垒，基于萨巴蒂尔原理。
