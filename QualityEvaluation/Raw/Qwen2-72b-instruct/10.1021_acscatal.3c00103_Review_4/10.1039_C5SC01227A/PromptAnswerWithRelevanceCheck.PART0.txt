[1] "Although the steam reforming process is now widely used in the modern chemical industry, other alternative routes to process methane are still quite challenging. Such alternative processes include, among others, the direct conversion of methane to other valuable chemicals or the dry CO2 reforming which not only reduces greenhouse emission but also produces a H2/CO mixture with a H2/CO ratio adequate for the FischerTropsch process."
[2] "The most widely used commercial PDH catalysts include supported Pt or CrOx. Although supported Pt catalysts show high activity, the catalyst deactivation due to coke formation remains a challenging issue."
[3] "The robustness against coking can be increased with additional promoters, such as late transition metals, main-group metals including Sn and Ga, alkali-metal oxides and rare-earth metal oxides."
[4] "The existence of Au atoms shifts down the d band of alloys, which weakens the interaction between σ* of CH bond and d states of surface metal atoms. Thus, the transition state gains less stabilization from surface atoms, and finally results in an increase of the dissociation barrier height."
[5] "The lower reactivity (i.e. higher dehydrogenation barrier) on PtSn alloy is due to the deeper d-band center compared to pure Pt."
[6] "The PtCu catalyst inhibits the adsorption of formed propylene, and thus suppresses the secondary cracking reactions from propylene towards lighter hydrocarbons. Thus, this reduced interaction between the product and the catalysts enhances the anti-coking ability of the catalyst."
[7] "The stability of metal oxides or hydride clusters is also influenced by the structure of the zeolite framework."
[8] "The pore size is also considered to have a slight effect on the catalytic activity, i.e., lower activation barriers for reactions in zeolites with larger pore size."
[9] "The weak binding of the intermediate on such sites favors the desorption of H2. Considering these two opposite effects, calculations suggested that the optimal AlAl distance to be 453 pm corresponding to a minimum overall barrier, and a simple structure-to-activity correlation based on the Sabatier principle was proposed."
[10] "The ultimate goal for theoretical studies is to identify optimal catalysts for particular chemical processes."
[11] "The continuing improvements of computer hardware, the development of new functionals, as well as the increasing sophistication of computational electronic structure software have insured the ability of a computational study to access more complicated catalytic systems beyond simple transition-metal surfaces."
[12] "Although the general trend of catalytic activity is not as easy to be addressed for these as for metal systems, the case studies still shed light on dehydrogenation mechanisms in these systems, and more insights emerge which are normally difficult to be explored at molecular level even by the most advanced experimental equipment."

1.The physicochemical properties of catalysts, including chemical qualities (such as acid strength and stability) and morphological characteristics, significantly influence their performance in dehydrogenation reactions. For instance, the stability of metal oxides or hydride clusters is influenced by the structure of the zeolite framework, and the pore size of zeolites has a slight effect on the catalytic activity, with lower activation barriers for reactions in zeolites with larger pore size. The optimal distance between active sites, such as AlAl distance in zeolites, can be determined to achieve a minimum overall barrier, based on the Sabatier principle. The ultimate goal of theoretical studies is to identify optimal catalysts for specific chemical processes, and the advancements in computational approaches have enabled the exploration of more complex catalytic systems beyond simple transition-metal surfaces. Case studies have provided insights into dehydrogenation mechanisms in these systems, revealing information that is challenging to obtain at the molecular level even with advanced experimental equipment.
2.Support modification strategies can be employed to optimize the physicochemical properties of catalysts for enhanced catalytic efficiency and selectivity. For example, the robustness against coking can be increased by adding promoters such as late transition metals, main-group metals including Sn and Ga, alkali-metal oxides, and rare-earth metal oxides. The existence of Au atoms in alloys shifts down the d band, weakening the interaction between σ* of CH bond and d states of surface metal atoms, resulting in an increase in the dissociation barrier height. The lower reactivity (i.e., higher dehydrogenation barrier) on PtSn alloy is due to the deeper d-band center compared to pure Pt. The PtCu catalyst inhibits the adsorption of formed propylene, suppressing secondary cracking reactions from propylene towards lighter hydrocarbons, which enhances the anti-coking ability of the catalyst. The weak binding of intermediates on certain sites favors the desorption of H2, and calculations have suggested an optimal AlAl distance in zeolites for a minimum overall barrier, based on the Sabatier principle.

1.催化剂的物理化学性质，包括化学品质（如酸强度和稳定性）和形态特征，对脱氢反应的性能有重大影响。例如，金属氧化物或氢化物簇的稳定性受沸石框架结构的影响，沸石的孔径大小对催化活性有轻微影响，孔径较大的沸石反应的活化能较低。沸石中活性位点（如AlAl距离）的最优距离可以根据萨巴蒂尔原理确定，以达到最小的整体能垒。理论研究的最终目标是为特定化学过程识别最优催化剂，计算方法的进步使我们能够探索比简单过渡金属表面更复杂的催化系统。案例研究为这些系统中的脱氢机制提供了见解，揭示了即使是使用最先进的实验设备也难以在分子水平上获得的信息。
2.可以通过支持体改性策略来优化催化剂的物理化学性质，以提高催化效率和选择性。例如，通过添加促进剂，如晚期过渡金属、主族金属（包括锡和镓）、碱金属氧化物和稀土金属氧化物，可以提高抗焦炭性能。合金中Au原子的存在会降低d带，削弱σ* CH键与表面金属原子d态之间的相互作用，导致解离能垒升高。PtSn合金的较低反应性（即较高的脱氢能垒）是由于其d带中心较深，与纯Pt相比。PtCu催化剂抑制了形成的丙烯吸附，从而抑制了从丙烯到较轻烃类的二次裂解反应，增强了催化剂的抗焦炭能力。某些位点上中间体的弱结合有利于H2的解吸，计算表明沸石中AlAl距离的最优值对应最小的整体能垒，基于萨巴蒂尔原理。

1.催化剂的物理化学性质，包括化学品质（如酸强度和稳定性）和形态特征，对脱氢反应的性能有重大影响。甲烷的替代处理路线，如直接转化为其他有价值的化学品或干CO2重整，仍然具有挑战性。通过添加促进剂，如晚期过渡金属、主族金属（包括Sn和Ga）、碱金属氧化物和稀土金属氧化物，可以提高对焦炭的抵抗力。Au原子的存在会降低合金的d带，削弱CH键的σ*与表面金属原子的d态之间的相互作用，导致解离能垒升高。计算得到的CHC解离能垒高于形成CHC的脱氢能垒，表明在转化过程中CHC可能积累。热力学修正会显著降低气相丙烯与吸附态相比的自由能垒。两种效应的结合提高了ad-atom上的D2能垒。PtSn合金的较低反应性（即较高的脱氢能垒）是由于其d带中心较深。容易获得的副反应显著降低了乙烷ODH的效率，这被建议为乙烷在V2O5上ODH活性低的原因。直接去除H，无论是作为H2还是H2O，以再生催化剂的O位点是困难的，最终会降低催化剂的活性。这种位点上中间体的弱结合有利于H2的解吸。考虑到这两种相反的影响，计算表明AlAl距离为453 pm时，总体能垒最小，基于萨巴蒂尔原理提出了一个简单的结构-活性相关性。甲醇的分解导致钯催化剂近边缘位点上碳质物种的形成。如果氢气压力与烷烃压力之比在1到10之间，脱氢过程的性能最佳。颗粒与支撑之间的晶格失配导致颗粒和表面位点之间相对位置的偏移，导致给定位点的不同环境，以及单个研究中需要考虑的大量可能性。可以通过优化这些性质来增强催化效率和选择性，例如合金化、掺杂和调整颗粒大小和形状。

1.The physicochemical properties of catalysts, including chemical qualities and morphological characteristics, significantly influence their performance in dehydrogenation reactions. Catalysts with higher d-band centers tend to bind intermediates and transition states more strongly, leading to lower dehydrogenation barriers. However, too high dehydrogenation activity can result in uncontrolled deep dehydrogenation and coke formation. Support modification strategies, such as alloying with late transition metals, main-group metals like Sn and Ga, alkali-metal oxides, and rare-earth metal oxides, can optimize these properties for enhanced catalytic efficiency and selectivity. These strategies can increase the robustness against coking and adjust the electronic structure of the catalyst, influencing the interaction between the catalyst and the reacting molecules.

1.The physicochemical properties of catalysts, including chemical qualities (such as acid strength and stability) and morphological characteristics, play a crucial role in determining their performance in dehydrogenation reactions. For instance, the stability of metal oxides or hydride clusters is influenced by the structure of the zeolite framework, which can affect the catalytic activity. The weak binding of intermediates on certain sites can favor the desorption of H2, which is beneficial for the catalytic process. The optimal distance between active sites, such as AlAl distance in zeolites, can minimize the overall barrier for the reaction, leading to enhanced catalytic efficiency. The stability and reactivity of the catalyst can be improved by alloying with other metals, such as PtSn, which can increase the d-band center and result in higher dehydrogenation barriers. The presence of certain elements, such as B, can prevent the deposition of carbonaceous species on the catalyst surface, reducing the risk of coking and improving the anti-coking ability of the catalyst. The use of advanced computational methods, such as DFT calculations, can help to identify optimal catalysts for specific chemical processes by considering factors such as the stability of metal oxides or hydride clusters, the binding strength of intermediates, and the optimal distance between active sites. However, the complexity of the systems, such as the lattice mismatch between the particle and support, can limit the ability to completely scan the potential energy surfaces with DFT calculations, which may require further development of computational approaches.
2.Support modification strategies can be employed to optimize the physicochemical properties of catalysts for enhanced catalytic efficiency and selectivity. For example, the addition of promoters, such as late transition metals, main-group metals including Sn and Ga, alkali-metal oxides, and rare-earth metal oxides, can increase the robustness against coking. The use of alloying can also improve the stability and reactivity of the catalyst by increasing the d-band center and resulting in higher dehydrogenation barriers. The presence of certain elements, such as B, can prevent the deposition of carbonaceous species on the catalyst surface, reducing the risk of coking and improving the anti-coking ability of the catalyst. The use of advanced computational methods, such as DFT calculations, can help to identify optimal support modification strategies by considering factors such as the stability of metal oxides or hydride clusters, the binding strength of intermediates, and the optimal distance between active sites. However, the complexity of the systems, such as the lattice mismatch between the particle and support, can limit the ability to completely scan the potential energy surfaces with DFT calculations, which may require further development of computational approaches.

1.催化剂的物理化学性质，包括化学品质（如酸强度和稳定性）和形态特征，在决定脱氢反应中的催化剂性能方面起着至关重要的作用。例如，金属氧化物或氢化物簇的稳定性受沸石框架结构的影响，这可能影响催化活性。在某些位点上，中间体的弱结合有利于H2的解吸，这对催化过程是有利的。例如，沸石中AlAl距离的最优距离可以将总体反应势垒降至最低，从而提高催化效率。通过与其他金属合金化，如PtSn，可以提高催化剂的稳定性和反应性，增加d带中心，导致更高的脱氢势垒。某些元素的存在，如B，可以防止催化剂表面沉积碳质物质，降低结焦的风险，提高催化剂的抗结焦能力。使用先进的计算方法，如DFT计算，可以帮助识别特定化学过程的最优催化剂，考虑金属氧化物或氢化物簇的稳定性、中间体的结合强度以及活性位点之间的最优距离等因素。然而，系统的复杂性，如颗粒与支撑之间的晶格不匹配，可能限制使用DFT计算完全扫描势能面的能力，这可能需要进一步发展计算方法。
2.可以通过支持改性策略来优化催化剂的物理化学性质，以提高催化效率和选择性。例如，添加促进剂，如晚期过渡金属、主族金属（包括Sn和Ga）、碱金属氧化物和稀土金属氧化物，可以提高抗结焦的鲁棒性。通过合金化也可以通过增加d带中心和导致更高的脱氢势垒来提高催化剂的稳定性和反应性。某些元素的存在，如B，可以防止催化剂表面沉积碳质物质，降低结焦的风险，提高催化剂的抗结焦能力。使用先进的计算方法，如DFT计算，可以帮助识别最优的支持改性策略，考虑金属氧化物或氢化物簇的稳定性、中间体的结合强度以及活性位点之间的最优距离等因素。然而，系统的复杂性，如颗粒与支撑之间的晶格不匹配，可能限制使用DFT计算完全扫描势能面的能力，这可能需要进一步发展计算方法。
