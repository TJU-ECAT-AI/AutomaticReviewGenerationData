1.The physicochemical properties of catalysts, including chemical qualities such as acid strength and stability, and morphological characteristics, significantly influence their performance in dehydrogenation reactions. The stability and tolerance to carbon deposits of Zr-Al-Beta promoted by alkali-metal ions were demonstrated. The modification of alkali-metal ions on both Lewis acid sites and Brnsted acid sites in Zr-Al-Beta was evidenced by XPS and FT-IR spectroscopy. The untreated materials displayed poor product selectivity and high coke deposit in the Meerwein-Ponndorf-Verley reduction of furfural and isopropanol; however, the treatment of alkali-metal ions promoted their catalytic performance with improved recalcitrance to deactivation and coking significantly. The type of alkali-metal ions and the concentration of alkaline solution influenced the catalytic performance, which were found to correlate to the acidity and textual properties. The optimum reaction result (97.3% yield of furfuryl alcohol at 99.6% conversion of furfural) can be obtained on 0.025 M-Na+-Zr-Al-Beta with high tolerance to the furfural concentration. Support modification strategies can be employed to optimize these properties for enhanced catalytic efficiency and selectivity by tuning and normalizing the various acidic sites of zeolites.

1.催化剂的物理化学性质，包括化学品质如酸强度和稳定性，以及形态特征，对脱氢反应的性能有重大影响。通过XPS和FT-IR光谱证实，碱金属离子对Zr-Al-Beta的Lewis酸位和Brnsted酸位的改性，提高了其在Meerwein-Ponndorf-Verley还原反应中的产品选择性和对焦炭沉积的抵抗能力。未经处理的材料在糠醛和异丙醇的Meerwein-Ponndorf-Verley还原反应中表现出较差的产品选择性和较高的焦炭沉积；然而，碱金属离子的处理显著提高了它们的催化性能，显著提高了对失活和焦炭沉积的抵抗能力。碱金属离子的类型和碱性溶液的浓度影响催化性能，这与酸性和文本属性相关。在0.025 M-Na+-Zr-Al-Beta上，可以得到最佳的反应结果（99.6%的糠醛转化率下，糠醇的产率为97.3%），并具有对糠醛浓度的高耐受性。通过调整和标准化沸石的各种酸位，可以采用载体改性策略来优化这些性质，以提高催化效率和选择性。
