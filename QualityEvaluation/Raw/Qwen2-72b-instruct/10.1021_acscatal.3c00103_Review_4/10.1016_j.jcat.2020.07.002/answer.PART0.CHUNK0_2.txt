1.The physicochemical properties of catalysts, including chemical qualities such as acid strength and stability, and morphological characteristics, significantly influence their performance in dehydrogenation reactions. The modification of support can optimize these properties for enhanced catalytic efficiency and selectivity. For instance, the modification of alkali-metal ions on both Lewis acid sites and Brnsted acid sites in Zr-Al-Beta zeolite can improve its catalytic performance with increased resistance to deactivation and coking. The type of alkali-metal ions and the concentration of alkaline solution can influence the catalytic performance, which correlates to the acidity and textual properties. An appropriate treatment concentration of alkaline ions is required to achieve optimal catalytic results.
