1.The physicochemical properties of catalysts, including chemical qualities and morphological characteristics, significantly influence their performance in dehydrogenation reactions. CrOx supported on high-silica HZSM-5 with a SiO2/Al2O3 ratio of 260 exhibits high catalytic activity, good selectivity, and excellent stability for propane dehydrogenation (PDH). The Cr species combined with Brnsted acid sites in Cr/HZSM-5 catalysts are responsible for the high catalytic performance. The Brnsted acid sites in HZSM-5 zeolite increase propane adsorption and enhance CH bond activation. The high surface area and well-defined pores of HZSM-5 zeolite provide a special environment for the dispersion and stabilization of Cr species, ensuring high catalytic activity and stability. The selection of supports for Cr-based catalysts is crucial for PDH. Zeolites, with their high surface area, well-defined channels, good thermal stability, and tunable acidity, can serve as catalysts or supports for various catalytic reactions. In zeolite-supported catalysts, zeolites are not inert supports but provide a special environment for catalytic reactions, including channel confinement effects, acidic sites, and electron transfer. Acidic sites in zeolites play a key role in determining the catalytic performance of zeolite catalysts in alkane conversion. The role of Cr species and Brnsted acid sites in Cr/HZSM-5 catalysts was elucidated through physicochemical characterizations, PDH tests, and Na+ doping experiments.

1.催化剂的物理化学性质，包括化学品质和形态特征，对脱氢反应的性能有重大影响。CrOx在高硅HZSM-5上，SiO2/Al2O3比为260，表现出高催化活性、良好的选择性和优异的稳定性，用于丙烷脱氢（PDH）。Cr/HZSM-5催化剂中Cr物种与Brnsted酸位点的结合对高催化性能负有责任。HZSM-5沸石中的Brnsted酸位点增加了丙烷的吸附，增强了CH键的活化。HZSM-5沸石的高表面积和明确定义的孔隙为Cr物种的分散和稳定提供了特殊环境，从而确保了高催化活性和稳定性。Cr基催化剂的载体选择对PDH至关重要。沸石，具有高表面积、明确定义的通道、良好的热稳定性和可调酸度，可作为各种催化反应的催化剂或载体。在沸石支持的催化剂中，沸石通常不是惰性载体，而是为催化反应提供特殊环境，包括通道限制效应、酸性位点和电子转移。沸石中的酸性位点在确定沸石催化剂在烷烃转化中的催化性能中起着关键作用。Cr/HZSM-5催化剂中Cr物种和Brnsted酸位点的作用通过物理化学表征、PDH测试和Na+掺杂实验得到了阐明。
