[1] "CrOx supported on high-silica HZSM-5 with a SiO2/Al2O3 ratio of 260 (Cr/Z-5(260) is synthesized by a simple wet impregnation method, which exhibits high catalytic activity, good selectivity and excellent stability for PDH."
[2] "The exploitation of an efficient PDH catalyst based on HZSM-5 zeolite to achieve both high selectivity and stability is still a great challenge."
[3] "In zeolite supported catalysts, zeolite is usually not an inert support, which can provide a special environment (e.g., channel confinement effects, acidic sites and electron transfer) for catalytic reactions."
[4] "Especially, the acidic sites in zeolites play a key role in determining the catalytic performance of zeolite catalysts in alkane conversion."
[5] "The role of Cr species and Brnsted acid sites in Cr/HZSM-5 catalysts was elucidated on the basis of the physicochemical characterizations, PDH tests and Na+ doping experiments."
[6] "The high surface area and well-defined pores of HZSM-5 zeolite can provide a special environment for the dispersion and stabilization of Cr species, thus guaranteeing high catalytic activity and stability."
[7] "The Brnsted acid sites in HZSM-5 zeolite could increase the propane adsorption and enhance the CH bond activation."
[8] "The high amounts of acidic sites of HZSM-5 zeolites are negative for PDH reaction. Only HZSM-5 zeolite has suitable acidic sites that can be used as a good support for CrOx catalysts for PDH process."
[9] "The Brnsted acid sites play an important role in determining the catalytic performance of Cr/Z-5 catalyst system."
[10] "The Brnsted acid sites in HZSM-5(260) play a key role in propane adsorption and activation, affecting their catalytic performance."

1.The physicochemical properties of catalysts, including chemical qualities and morphological characteristics, significantly influence their performance in dehydrogenation reactions. Catalysts with high surface area and well-defined pores, such as CrOx supported on high-silica HZSM-5, provide a special environment for the dispersion and stabilization of active species, ensuring high catalytic activity and stability. Acidic sites, particularly Brnsted acid sites in zeolites, play a crucial role in determining the catalytic performance of zeolite catalysts in alkane conversion, affecting propane adsorption and CH bond activation. Support modification strategies, such as adjusting the SiO2/Al2O3 ratio of HZSM-5, can optimize these properties for enhanced catalytic efficiency and selectivity. Suitable acidic sites in HZSM-5 are essential for good PDH performance, while excessive acidic sites can lead to deep dehydrogenation and cracking, negatively impacting the reaction.
