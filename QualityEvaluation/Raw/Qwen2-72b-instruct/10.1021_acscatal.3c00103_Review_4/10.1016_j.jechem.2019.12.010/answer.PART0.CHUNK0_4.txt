[1] "CrOx supported on high-silica HZSM-5 with a SiO2/Al2O3 ratio of 260 (Cr/Z-5(260) is synthesized by a simple wet impregnation method, which exhibits high catalytic activity, good selectivity and excellent stability for PDH."
[2] "The exploitation of an efficient PDH catalyst based on HZSM-5 zeolite to achieve both high selectivity and stability is still a great challenge."
[3] "In zeolite supported catalysts, zeolite is usually not an inert support, which can provide a special environment (e.g., channel confinement effects, acidic sites and electron transfer) for catalytic reactions."
[4] "The role of Cr species and Brnsted acid sites in Cr/HZSM-5 catalysts was elucidated on the basis of the physicochemical characterizations, PDH tests and Na+ doping experiments."
[5] "The high surface area and well-defined pores of HZSM-5 zeolite can provide a special environment for the dispersion and stabilization of Cr species, thus guaranteeing high catalytic activity and stability."
[6] "The Brnsted acid sites in HZSM-5 zeolite could increase the propane adsorption and enhance the CH bond activation."
[7] "The acidity properties of the prepared Cr/Z-5, Cr/SiO2 and Cr/Al2O3 catalysts are detected by NH3-TPD technique."
[8] "The XPS results reveal that the Cr species combined with Brnsted acid sites in Cr/HZSM-5 catalysts are responsible for the high catalytic performance."
[9] "The high amounts of acidic sites of HZSM-5 zeolites are negative for PDH reaction. Only HZSM-5 zeolite has suitable acidic sites that can be used as a good support for CrOx catalysts for PDH process."

1.The physicochemical properties of catalysts, including chemical qualities and morphological characteristics, significantly influence their performance in dehydrogenation reactions. CrOx supported on high-silica HZSM-5 zeolite with a SiO2/Al2O3 ratio of 260 exhibits high catalytic activity, good selectivity, and excellent stability for propane dehydrogenation (PDH). The high surface area and well-defined pores of HZSM-5 provide a special environment for the dispersion and stabilization of Cr species, which is crucial for high catalytic activity and stability. The Brnsted acid sites in HZSM-5 enhance propane adsorption and CH bond activation, contributing to the high catalytic performance. The acidity properties of the catalysts are detected by NH3-TPD technique, and the XPS results reveal that the Cr species combined with Brnsted acid sites are responsible for the high catalytic performance. The high amounts of acidic sites of HZSM-5 zeolites are negative for PDH reaction, and only HZSM-5 zeolite with suitable acidic sites can be used as a good support for CrOx catalysts for PDH process. Support modification strategies, such as controlling the SiO2/Al2O3 ratio and doping with Na+, can be employed to optimize these properties for enhanced catalytic efficiency and selectivity.

1.催化剂的物理化学性质，包括化学品质和形态特征，对脱氢反应的性能有重大影响。CrOx在高硅HZSM-5沸石上，SiO2/Al2O3比为260，显示出高催化活性、良好的选择性和优异的稳定性，用于丙烷脱氢（PDH）。HZSM-5的高表面积和明确的孔隙为Cr物种的分散和稳定提供了特殊环境，这是高催化活性和稳定性的关键。HZSM-5中的Brnsted酸位点增强了丙烷的吸附和CH键的活化，对高催化性能有贡献。催化剂的酸性性质通过NH3-TPD技术进行检测，XPS结果表明，与Brnsted酸位点结合的Cr物种对高催化性能负责。HZSM-5沸石的高酸性位点对PDH反应是不利的，只有具有合适酸性位点的HZSM-5沸石才能作为CrOx催化剂的良好载体，用于PDH过程。通过控制SiO2/Al2O3比和用Na+掺杂等载体改性策略，可以优化这些性质，以提高催化效率和选择性。
