1.催化剂的物理化学性质，包括化学品质和形态特征，对脱氢反应的性能有重大影响。通过湿浸渍法合成的催化剂，如CrOx在高硅HZSM-5上，SiO2/Al2O3比为260，对PDH表现出高催化活性、良好的选择性和优异的稳定性。基于HZSM-5沸石开发高效PDH催化剂，同时实现高选择性和稳定性，仍是一个挑战。在沸石支撑的催化剂中，沸石为催化反应提供了特殊的环境，包括通道限制效应、酸性位点和电子转移。沸石中的酸性位点在烷烃转化的沸石催化剂的催化性能中起着关键作用。Cr/HZSM-5催化剂中Cr物种和Brnsted酸位点的作用通过物理化学表征、PDH测试和Na+掺杂实验得以阐明。制备的CrOx催化剂的结构性质通过N2吸附技术检测。母体HZSM-5(260)和Cr/Z-5(260)样品的XRD图谱非常相似，表明Cr负载对HZSM-5沸石的晶粒结构影响很小。制备的Cr/Z-5、Cr/SiO2和Cr/Al2O3催化剂的酸性性质通过NH3-TPD技术检测。Cr物种和HZSM-5支撑之间的金属-支撑相互作用通过XPS光谱测量。在PDH测试中，高温导致催化剂上的焦炭形成，这是催化剂失活的主要原因。反应/产物分子与催化剂之间的相互作用在脱氢过程中非常重要。Cr/HZSM-5催化剂的催化性能受Cr负载量和SiO2/Al2O3比的影响进行了详细研究。Cr/HZSM-5催化剂中Cr物种和Brnsted酸位点的作用通过物理化学表征、PDH测试和Na+掺杂实验得以阐明。
