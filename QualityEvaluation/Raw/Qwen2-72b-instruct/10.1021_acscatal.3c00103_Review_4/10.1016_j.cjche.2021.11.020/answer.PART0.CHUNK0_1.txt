1.The stability of Pt particles on the surface of supports can be greatly enhanced by manipulating metal-support interaction. Al2O3 with coordinatively unsaturated pentacoordinate Al3+ sites can stabilize atomically dispersed Pt species by forming Al3+ penta-O-Pt bonds, anchoring Pt particles on the Al2O3 support. Pt particles can also be tightly stabilized on heteroatoms in the lattice of oxide substrates. Small Pt particles stabilized in lattice-confined Sn (IV/II) produce a highly selective and stable Pt-Sn catalyst for propane dehydrogenation. Pt particles confined at the Sn single-site in zeolite framework show high catalytic performance in propane dehydrogenation, mainly due to the strong interaction between Pt particles and the framework of Sn-zeolite. The PtSn bimetallic particles confined in mesopores of hierarchical ZSM-5 become a stable catalyst in propane dehydrogenation at high temperature. The high efficiency of PtSn/hierarchical ZSM-5 catalysts for propane dehydrogenation is mainly attributed to the confinement of PtSn particles in the mesopores of hierarchical ZSM-5 zeolite.

1.通过操纵金属-支撑物相互作用，可以大大提高Pt颗粒在支撑物表面的稳定性。具有五配位Al3+（Al3+ penta）的Al2O3可以稳定原子分散的Pt物种，通过形成Al3+ penta-O-Pt键，将Pt颗粒锚定在Al2O3支撑物上。Pt颗粒也可以在氧化物基质的晶格中被异原子紧密稳定。在晶格限制的Sn (IV/II)中稳定的小Pt颗粒产生了一种高选择性和稳定的Pt-Sn催化剂，用于丙烷脱氢。在沸石框架中Sn单点处被限制的Pt颗粒在丙烷脱氢中表现出高催化性能，这主要归因于Pt颗粒与Sn-沸石框架之间的强相互作用。PtSn双金属颗粒在分级ZSM-5的介孔中被限制，成为在高温下丙烷脱氢的稳定催化剂。PtSn/分级ZSM-5催化剂在丙烷脱氢中的高效率主要归因于PtSn颗粒在分级ZSM-5沸石介孔中的限制。
