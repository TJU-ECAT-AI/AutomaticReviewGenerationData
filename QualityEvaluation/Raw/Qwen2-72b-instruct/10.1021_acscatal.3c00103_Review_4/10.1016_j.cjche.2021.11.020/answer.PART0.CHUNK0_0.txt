1.The stability of Pt particles on the surface of supports can be significantly improved by manipulating metal-support interactions. Al2O3 with coordinatively unsaturated pentacoordinate Al3+ sites can stabilize atomically dispersed Pt species by forming Al3+ penta-O-Pt bonds, anchoring Pt particles on the Al2O3 surface. Pt particles can also be tightly stabilized on heteroatoms in the oxide substrate lattice. Small Pt particles stabilized in lattice-confined Sn (IV/II) produce a highly selective and stable Pt-Sn catalyst for propane dehydrogenation. Pt particles confined at Sn single-sites in the zeolite framework exhibit high catalytic performance in propane dehydrogenation, mainly due to the strong interaction between Pt particles and the Sn-zeolite framework. The PtSn bimetallic particles confined in the mesopores of hierarchical ZSM-5 zeolite allow them to become a stable catalyst in propane dehydrogenation at high temperatures. The high efficiency of PtSn/hierarchical ZSM-5 catalysts in propane dehydrogenation is mainly attributed to the confinement of PtSn particles in the mesopores of hierarchical ZSM-5 zeolite.

1.通过操纵金属-载体相互作用，可以显著提高Pt颗粒在载体表面的稳定性。具有五配位Al3+（Al3+ penta）的Al2O3可以通过形成Al3+ penta-O-Pt键来稳定原子分散的Pt物种，从而将Pt颗粒锚定在Al2O3表面上。Pt颗粒也可以在氧化物基质晶格中的杂原子上紧密稳定。在晶格限制的Sn (IV/II)中稳定的小Pt颗粒产生了一种高选择性和稳定的Pt-Sn催化剂，用于丙烷脱氢。在沸石框架中Sn单点处限制的Pt颗粒在丙烷脱氢中表现出高催化性能，这主要归因于Pt颗粒与Sn-沸石框架之间的强相互作用。PtSn双金属颗粒在分级ZSM-5沸石的介孔中限制，使它们在高温下成为丙烷脱氢的稳定催化剂。PtSn/分级ZSM-5催化剂在丙烷脱氢中的高效率主要归因于PtSn颗粒在分级ZSM-5沸石介孔中的限制。
