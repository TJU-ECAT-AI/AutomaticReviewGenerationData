Chemical ReviewsVol 120/Issue 20Article Cite Share Jump to Expand REVIEWSeptember 11, 2020 Hierarchically Structured Zeolites: From Design to Application Li-Hua Chen* Ming-Hui Sun Zhao Wang Weimin Yang* Zaiku Xie* Bao-Lian Su* Open PDF Abstract Hierarchical zeolites combine the intrinsic catalytic properties of microporous zeolites and the enhanced access and transport of the additional meso- and/or macroporous system. These materials are the most desirable catalysts and sorbents for industry and become a highly evolving field of important current interests. In addition to the enhanced mass transfer leading to high activity, selectivity, and cycle time, another essential merit of the hierarchical structure in zeolite materials is that it can significantly improve the utilization effectiveness of zeolite materials resulting in the minimum energy, time, and raw materials consumption. Substantial progress has been made in the synthesis, characterization, and application of hierarchical zeolites. Herein, we provide an overview of recent achievements in the field, highlighting the significant progress in the past decade on the development of novel and remarkable strategies to create an additional pore system in zeolites. The most innovative synthesis approaches are reviewed according to the principle, versatility, effectiveness, and degree of reality while establishing a firm link between the preparation route and the resultant hierarchical pore quality in zeolites. Zeolites with different hierarchically porous structures, i.e., micro-mesoporous structure, micro-macroporous structure, and micro-meso-macroporous structure, are then analyzed in detail with concrete examples to illustrate their benefits and their fabrications. The significantly improved performances in catalytic, environmental, and biological applications resulting from enhanced mass transport properties are discussed through a series of representative cases. In the concluding part, we envision the emergence of material-properties-by-quantitative and real rational design based on the generalized Murrays Law that enables the predictable and controlled productions of bioinspired hierarchically structured zeolites. This Review is expected to attract important interests from catalysis, separation, environment, advanced materials, and chemical engineering fields as well as biomedicine for artificial organ and drug delivery systems.

1. Introduction
Zeolites are an important family of crystalline microporous materials with three-dimensional framework constructed by corner-sharing TO4 tetrahedrons (T refers to tetrahedrally coordinated framework atoms Si, Al, or other heteroatoms). The different ways of TO4 tetrahedra connections result in a rich variety of zeolite microporous structures. These microporous materials are either formed naturally by volcanic activity or synthesized artificially in the laboratory. Currently, 245 distinct zeolite framework structures are recognized by the Structure Commission of the International Zeolite Association (IZA-SC). (1) Since the first synthetic preparation of zeolites by Barrer in the 1940s, zeolites have been widely used as catalysts and catalyst supports in petroleum and chemical industries, (24) as ion exchangers in detergents, and as sorbents in separation processes. Today, they constitute more than 40% of all solid catalysts used for oil refining, petrochemical processing, and fine chemicals. (5) The remarkable properties of zeolites in these catalytic and separation processes are closely related to their well-defined microporous structure. (6,7) Notably, the intracrystalline molecular mobility in the zeolites is the determining factor of the overall reaction rate and separation efficiency. However, the intrinsic micropores (typically <2 nm) usually impose severe constraints for mass transfer of reactants/products to and away from the active center, especially when bulky molecules are involved. Diffusion, as the main mechanism of mass transfer, is a crucial factor in deciding the catalytic properties (activity, selectivity, and lifetime) and the utilization efficiency of the zeolites in many reactions and separation processes. (8) Moreover, the slow transport in zeolite microporous channels could lead to side reactions, significant coking, rapid deactivation of catalysts, and most importantly the waste of zeolite materials and energy. One fundamental approach to minimize the diffusion limitation is to shorten the diffusion path length, which can be realized by developing hierarchically porous materials that integrate porosities of multiple levels in a single solid body. Therefore, hierarchically porous zeolites are regarded as the most promising catalytic materials for industrial applications. (9) Many classes of organisms among both plants and animals contain hierarchical networks of interconnected pores to maximize the mass transport and increase the rates of reactions for optimal efficiency and least energy consumption (Figure 1). (10,11) Water transport in leaf vein systems is an essential part of plant growth and development. The efficient water transport via the leaves is mainly achieved by a two-level hierarchy consisting of the main veins and smaller capillaries. Our respiratory system is a highly efficient natural construction enabling both fast mass transport with minimum resistance and effective O2CO2 exchange between air and blood. The lung also contains a hierarchically porous system with the primary broad single channel trachea and the secondary large number of pulmonary alveoli with huge surface area. The blood circuit is a closed hierarchically organized vascular system wherein the pathway of blood starts from a certain point and eventually returns back to the same point. It is a highly efficient physiological process promoted by hierarchical distribution and hierarchical recollection. Theoretical calculations also confirmed that different hierarchical features of the flow distribution directly influence the average reaction rates in a structured catalytic microfluidic reactor. (12) Recently, a pioneering series of bioinspired materials emulating the natural vascular structure, in which pore sizes decrease along different scales and end in units of constant size, as in plant stems, leaf veins, vascular, and respiratory systems, have been fabricated. (10) Such biomimics provide hierarchical branching and facilitate mass transport in both liquid (or gas)solid and electrochemical processes. This is the first macro-meso-microporous material quantitatively designed and synthesized with optimum diameter ratios among multiscale pores. It is thus highly desirable to construct such hierarchical networks of interconnected pores within zeolite crystals. (10) Importantly, the synthesized hierarchically porous zeolites should retain a high zeolitic character; i.e., the additional porosities are introduced without impairing the intrinsic zeolite micropores. For the construction of hierarchically porous zeolite structures, Perez-Ramirez et al. (13) proposed increasing the mesopore surface area without severely sacrificing the intrinsic micropore volume of zeolite to maximize the hierarchy factor. (14) Figure 1 Figure 1.

Copyright Sogo.com.During the past decade, many different strategies to synthesize hierarchically porous zeolites with both an abundant secondary porosity and full interconnected mesopores or macropores have been developed. The preparation methods can be divided principally into the post-treatment synthetic routes and the in situ synthetic routes. (15,16) The post-treatment, including the selective desilication/dealumination processes, is mainly a destructive procedure by sacrificing part of the zeolite crystals to create larger meso- or macropores. (17,18) It usually results in a loss of crystallinity, and the secondary porosity generated is often uncontrollable. To solve this problem, different synthetic approaches, including reaction conditions and reactants, are adopted. The in situ synthesis approach usually uses the organic or inorganic templates in the zeolite crystallization process. It produces hierarchically porous zeolites with identical or similar components as conventional microporous zeolites. The key point is to maximize the interactions between the templates and the zeolite precursors and thus minimize their phase segregation during the zeolite crystallization process. It is the determining factor that influences not only the purity and the morphology of the zeolites but also the location and the interconnectivity between the intrinsic micropores and the introduced meso- or macropores.Hierarchically porous zeolites combining the intrinsic micropores with an auxiliary meso- and/or macropore network of inter- or intracrystalline structure, exhibiting an unimpeded transport path (macropores) and enhanced micropore accessibility (mesopores) without sacrificing their intrinsic catalytic activity (micropores), show great potential in a wide range of catalytic reactions, such as alkylation, acylation, rearrangement, FischerTropsch synthesis, hydroconversion, oxidation, methanol conversions, cracking, and biomass conversion. (19,20) In addition to the above-mentioned excellent catalytic properties, hierarchically porous zeolites also show exceptional sorption characteristics useful for the environmental benefits (wastewater treatment, adsorptive desulfurization, CO2 capture, and removal of volatile organic compounds) together with carrier qualities that enable them to be desirable hosts in biological applications.In this Review, we will focus on the synthesis and evaluation of the hierarchically porous zeolites. After this brief introduction (section 1), in section 2, the recent progress in the preparation methods of hierarchically porous zeolites is described. Section 3 outlines the concrete preparations of different defined types of hierarchically porous zeolites with an ordered or disordered structure, including micropores and mesopores (micro-mesoporous zeolites); micropores and macropores (micro-macroporous zeolites); or micropores, mesopores, and macropores (micro-meso-macroporous zeolites). The catalytic, environmental, and biological applications of hierarchically porous zeolites are reviewed in section 4. The last section (section 5) includes concluding remarks and future trends. This Review provides a comprehensive overview of synthesis methods, structural features, and applications of hierarchically porous zeolites. The detailed summary, analysis, and discussion in this Review will enable new researchers in this field to be more fully familiar with the subject and orient them to choose the research subdomain they are interested in. In addition, this Review will help researchers in this field to understand the latest research progress on the hierarchically porous zeolites from synthesis to applications.
2. Synthesis
Hierarchically porous zeolites are characterized by the intrinsic microporosity from the zeolitic framework and the introduced inter- or intracrystalline meso- or macropore system. Depending on the introduced pores, the resulting hierarchically porous zeolites can be further distinguished into (i) hierarchically micro-mesoporous structured zeolites, (ii) hierarchically micro-macroporous structured zeolites, and (iii) hierarchically micro-meso-macroporous structured zeolites. Numerous studies are carried out to synthesize hierarchical zeolites with the advanced pore structure of multiple levels to overcome the diffusion restrictions derived from sole micropores. The large variety of synthetic strategies for the construction of pore hierarchy can be divided into in situ and postsynthetic approaches. The in situ approach creates hierarchical zeolites by fabricating microporous and mesoporous products with or without the employment of secondary hard or soft templates during zeolite synthesis. On the other hand, the postsynthetic approach concerns the post-treatment of the as-synthesized zeolites to introduce a hierarchical structure into zeolites. In the following section, these two preparation approaches will be discussed in detail. Figure 2 gives a general overview of different strategies for the introduction of additional porosity. Besides, the hierarchically porous zeolite materials with different hierarchical structures obtained by various methods with concrete examples are summarized in Table 1.

Table 1. Different Methods Used to Prepare Hierarchical Zeolites
2.1. In Situ Approach
2.1.1. Templating Route
2.1.1.1. Direct Templating Route
The synthesis of hierarchically porous zeolites generally requires mesopore and/or macropore templates (also called porogens) for the generation of additional porosity and a structure-directing agent (SDA) for the formation of the microporous zeolite structure. The mesopore and/or macropore templates are firstly imbedded within the zeolite precursor slurry and then removed after the zeolite formation to free additional porosity. Depending on the rigidity (solid or liquid) of mesopore and/or macropore templates, these synthesis strategies can be classified into the hard templating route (16,21147) and the soft templating route. (75,148197)
2.1.1.1.1. Hard Templating Route
The hard templating route involves the use of either nonporous or porous solid materials with a relatively rigid structure usually used as sacrificial templates to create the additional porosity during zeolite crystallization. It can be applied for the synthesis of hierarchically porous zeolites of a wide range of zeolite structures since the solid template is chemically inert without an impact on the zeolite intrinsic structure formation. Generally, the synthesis procedure consists of the addition of solid templates into the zeolite synthetic mixture, the in situ crystallization of zeolites with the solid templates, and the subsequent template removal by either calcination or leaching. The solid templates can be incorporated into the zeolite crystals during dry-gel conversions (198) or zeolite crystallization. (21) The hard templating route produces zeolites with high crystallinity, uniform additional porosity, and a tailorable porous structure. The hard templating route is very suitable to fabricate hierarchical titanosilicate zeolites due to the special nature of the titanium species under either acid or alkali leaching treatments. (199,200) Carbonaceous materials, (16,2183) polymers/aerogel/resin, (84109) inorganic solid materials, (110130) and biological material (131147) have been applied as hard templates to fabricate hierarchically porous zeolites.
2.1.1.1.1.1. Carbonaceous Materials
Due to their excellent characteristics, such as chemical inertness, structural diversity, tunable surface functionality, morphology variety, cost effectiveness, and easy removal, carbon materials, such as carbon nanoparticles, (2131) nanotubes, (3236,382) nanofibers, (37) ordered mesoporous carbon CMK-1 and CMK-3, (3844) ordered porous carbons, (16,4551) and polymers, (84109) are widely used as hard templates. Whether the obtained porous structures are ordered and interconnected or not depends on how the templates are structured and how they interact with the zeolite synthesis gel during the crystallization process. The hydrophobic nature of the carbon templates usually makes them hard to be uniformly dispersed in the hydrophilic zeolite synthesis gel. (52) To avoid the phase separation between zeolite crystals and carbon materials during zeolite crystallization, the carbons are usually pretreated with mixture of nitric acid and sulfuric acids to form surface oxygen species with hydrophilic features. (53,54) Carbon Nanoparticles, Nanotubes, and Nanofibers Jacobsen et al. applied carbon nanoparticles for the confined space synthesis of zeolite ZSM-5 nanocrystals. (21) To realize the confined space crystallization, zeolite precursor gels with an amount equal to or even lower than the total pore volume of the carbon matrix were introduced into the carbon materials by the incipient wetness impregnation method. It is difficult to strictly constrain the zeolite crystallization within the templates due to the incompatible nature between the hydrophobic carbon template and the aqueous zeolitic precursor solution. Some precursor gel would migrate and crystallize out of the templates. Thus, dry-gel conversion was applied for this kind of synthesis, in which the zeolite precursors were reduced to a dry powder before they were converted in a water-vapor-rich atmosphere. The mobility in the reaction mixture was greatly reduced. The composites of dry gels were then crystallized. They found that, by using an excessive amount of mesoporous carbon nanoparticles, zeolite crystals nucleated strictly in the mesopores of carbon nanoparticles. (22) The final crystalline size of the zeolites is decided by the inert mesopore system rather than the gel composition. When excess synthesis gel was used, the carbon nanoparticles were dispersed into the zeolite precursor solution and then encapsulated by the growing zeolite crystals during the crystalline process (Figure 3A,B). (23) Contrary to the zeolite nanocrystals prepared in the confined space of porous carbons, removal of the embedded carbon matrix led to zeolite single crystals with intracrystalline mesopores, which are directly related to the size, shape, and connectivity of the carbon nanoparticles. Thus, it can be concluded that, in the carbon-templating synthesis, the generation of either nanocrystals or mesoporous single crystals largely depends on the synthetic condition that influences the nucleation rates relative to growth rates. (25) The high nucleation rates favored the formation of nanosized zeolites while the high growth rates favored the formation of mesoporous zeolite single crystals. (25) The wide availability of this approach was further demonstrated by the following successful synthesis of hierarchical zeolites with different frameworks and compositions and zeotypes, such as mesoporous zeolite single crystals of BEA (Beta), (21) MFI (TS-1, (26) ZSM-5 (27)), MEL (ZSM-11, TS-2, and Silicalite-2), (28) and MTW (ZSM-12) (29) framework structures, and hierarchical aluminum phosphates AFI (AlPO-5) (31) and CHA (AlPO-34) (31) framework structures. The obtained mesoporous zeolites showed highly improved diffusion performances and catalytic properties when compared with the conventional microporous materials. However, the cavity-like mesopores templated by the spherical carbon nanoparticles are not open to the external surface of the zeolite and are only accessible to the micropores, providing very little contribution to improve the mass transfer.

The use of carbon nanotubes (3236) and carbon nanofibers (37) offers an enhanced control over the size and shape of the introduced mesopores and leads to the generation of accessible and utilizable mesopores for improved mass transport. Schmidt et al. was the first to use multiwall carbon nanotubes (12 nm diameter and several micrometers in length) to produce zeolite Silicalite-1 with straight and uniform mesoporous channels (1230 nm in width, in accordance with the diameters of the carbon nanotubes) penetrating the whole zeolite single crystals (Figure 3C,D). (32) Mesoporous zeolite Y and ZSM-5 nanocrystals can also be synthesized in the confined internal mesoporous space of the carbon nanotubes with an internal diameter of 2030 nm. (36) The maximum crystal size is limited by the internal diameter of the carbon nanotubes, thus realizing the preparation of hierarchical zeolite nanocrystals with a desirable and controllable size distribution. Similar mesoporous zeolites were also obtained by using cost-effective carbon nanofibers as templates. (37) The produced mesopores in zeolite crystals are cylindrical and exhibit low tortuosity.
Chou et al. used carbon nanoparticles in both the hydrothermal synthesis process and the dry-gel conversion process for introducing mesoporosity into zeolite crystals. (55,56) During the hydrothermal synthesis, the carbon nanoparticles are excluded from the zeolite crystals, resulting in microporous zeolites similar to the one synthesized without templates. In the dry-gel conversion process, the zeolite growth rate is much slower due to the extremely slow transfer in the synthesis dry gel caused by the water limitation, thus resulting in a tight connection between the synthesis gel and the carbon template and producing hierarchically porous zeolite ZSM-5 with abundant mesopores. In certain zeolite synthesis systems, the carbon templates are more effective in dry-gel conversion than in hydrothermal synthesis. (57) Recent developments in the synthesis of carbon-templated hierarchical zeolites involve the application of microwave heating methods and the assistance of the fluoride route. Carbon-templated mesoporous ZSM-5 zeolites were directly synthesized from the conventional synthesis gel containing carbon nanoparticles as the mesopore template under controlled microwave heating. (30) Egeblad et al. synthesized a number of mesoporous zeolites by combining the carbon-templating strategy with the fluoride route. (31) In the fluoride media, the synthesis of mesoporous aluminum phosphate materials, including AlPO-5 and AlPO-34, was also proven possible. (31) The effects of carbon templates on the construction of hierarchical structures in zeolites have also been investigated with graphene oxide (GO) and graphene nanosheets, which exhibit unique structural, mechanical, and electronic properties due to the one-atom-thick carbon sheets. Hydrophilic GO sheets facilitated zeolite crystallization leading to the formation of large polycrystalline zeolite crystals, (58) while hydrophobic graphene sheets served as physical barriers to confine zeolite crystal growth with the formation of smaller crystals. (59) GO was further used in a solvent-free synthesis to realize the control over morphology and structure of the resulting zeolites. The addition of GO led to well-dispersed, faceted Si-ZSM-5 crystals, leading to oriented growth of the Si-ZSM-5 crystals along the c-axis. (60) Carbon Aerogels Carbon aerogels (CAs) are a version of the resorcinol formaldehyde (RF) aerogel that are pyrolyzed in an inert atmosphere. (6163) Compared to the mentioned mesoporous CMK-n (n = 15) templates, carbon aerogels (CAs) have larger mesopores and thicker mesoporous walls, making them more suitable mesopore templates to create intracrystalline mesopores in the zeolites. CAs usually exhibit a monolithic morphology with a three-dimensional pore system formed by the agglomerate structures of uniform spherical carbon particles. (64) Thus, these materials are used as hard templates for the preparation of hierarchically porous zeolites. The zeolite synthesis gel is introduced into the mesopores of CAs, and then, zeolite crystals intergrow within the three-dimensional pore system of the CA monolith. Consequently, zeolite monoliths with open mesopores can be obtained upon the complete removal of the carbon matrix by calcination, thus paving the way for monolithic self-supported mesoporous zeolite catalysts. By using a CA with mesopore size of 23 nm and pore wall thickness of 10 nm as a template, ZSM-5 (MFI structure, Figure 3E,F) (65) and Y (FAU structure) (66) zeolites containing uniform and abundant mesopores have been synthesized. The mesopore-size distributions of these zeolites are very narrow with maxima located at 11 nm, corresponding to the wall thickness of the pores in the CAs. Besides, the predominant porosity in CAs can be easily tuned by varying the molar ratios of starting materials (resorcinol/formaldehyde), thus realizing the control over the mesopore size in zeolites. For example, the ZSM-5 zeolite produced from a carbonized resorcinol/formaldehyde ratio of 2:1 had a mesopore volume of 0.98 cm3 g1, while a ZSM-5 zeolite produced from a resorcinol/formaldehyde ratio of 1:1 had a mesopore volume of 0.34 cm3 g1. (67) The obtained hierarchically porous N-doped biomass-derived carbonaceous monoliths served as a cost-effective hard template to synthesize hierarchically porous ZSM-5 zeolite single crystals with intracrystalline mesopores of 1216 nm in diameter. (68) Preformed Carbon Templates Preformed mesoporous carbons have been widely applied in the synthesis of hierarchically porous zeolites. The carbon templates with ordered mesopores are obtained either by replicating the ordered mesoporous silicates (3844) or by imprinting of colloidal silicas (16,4550) to give a hierarchical zeolite with ordered mesopores.
Replications of Ordered Mesoporous Silicates Ryoo and co-workers developed a series of ordered carbon mesoporous molecular sieves (CMK-n, n = 15) possessing high surface area and excellent thermal/hydrothermal stabilities. (6973) The ordered CMK-1 (cubic structure) (69) and CMK-3 (two-dimensional hexagonal structure) (70,71) materials were prepared by using the ordered mesoporous silicates MCM-48 (74,75) or SBA-15 (76,77) as templates, respectively.
Previous attempts have been made to synthesize MFI zeolites by directly using CMK-n (n = 15) as a hard template. Cho et al. investigated the conditions for the synthesis of an ordered mesoporous MFI zeolite using CMK-n (n = 15) mesoporous carbons as a template through the dry-gel conversion approach (Figure 3G,H). (38) They concluded that the successful replication of CMK in the dry-gel crystallization process mainly depended on the pore size, humidity, and framework rigidity. By carefully controlling the condition of the dry-gel conversion, Sakthivel et al. (39) prepared mesoporous aluminosilicates (RMM-1 and RMM-3) which precisely replicated the ordered structure of CMK-1 and CMK-3. The RMM-1 and RMM-3 appeared to be composite materials, constructed by mesoporous zeolites with ZSM-5 zeolite nanocrystals embedded in the pore walls. These works only obtained an aggregate of zeolite nanocrystals with a disordered mesopore structure.
Cho et al. (44) reported a modified synthetic procedure by recrystallization of carbon-filled mesoporous SBA-15. The final product was SBA-15 with zeolitic fragments in the mesopore wall. Fang et al. (41) further reported the successful synthesis of an ordered mesoporous aluminosilicate with a completely crystalline zeolite pore wall structure by recrystallization of SBA-15 using in situ formed CMK-5 as the hard template. This in situ formed CMK-5 hard template not only helped to preserve the original ordered mesoporous structure but also kinetically controlled the crystallization process to avoid the formation of large crystals. Wang et al. (43) confirmed that the prior formation of a well-developed carbon structure inside the mesopores of SBA-15 before the synthesis of Silicalite-1/SBA-15 composites can improve the stability of the meso-structure of the template during the zeolite crystallization process.
Imprints of Colloidal Silica Nanoparticles and Colloidal Silica Crystals The colloidal crystal templating is a popular method for designing ordered porous carbons. (45) Typically, both colloidal silica nanoparticles and colloidal silica crystals can be used as hard templates and mixed with a certain carbon precursor to prepare a carbon template. (16) After the subsequent carbonization and silica dissolution, carbon templates with ordered meso- or macroporous replicating the initial colloid silica nanoparticles were synthesized. (46) The application of such porous carbon as a mesopore template resulted in different mesoporous zeolite single crystals. Pinnavaia et al. demonstrated for the first time the nanocasting synthesis of uniform ZSM-5 zeolite nanocrystals using colloid-imprinted carbons (CICs) as hard templates. (47) By varying the particle size of the initial silica colloid, CICs with different pore-size distributions were obtained and used as carbon templates to synthesize zeolite nanocrystals with a controllable size. Fan et al. further reported the successful synthesis of size-tunable, uniformly shaped Silicalite-1 zeolite nanocrystals and orderedimprinted mesoporous zeolite single crystals within the three-dimensional ordered mesoporous (3DOm) carbon templates, which precisely replicated the ordered colloidal silica crystals composed of size-tunable silica nanoparticles (1040 nm), via steam-assisted crystallization (SAC). (48) The 3DOm-imprint method was also used to prepare monolithic 3DOm zeolites. Chen et al. introduced a modified hydrothermal synthesis procedure for the synthesis of hierarchical BEA, LTA, FAU, and LTL zeolite nanocrystals with highly ordered, tunable intercrystalline mesopores (Figure 3I,J). (49) As a hard template, 3DOm carbon with a pore size of around 1040 nm was firstly prepared by a replication process from colloidal crystals made by size-tunable silica nanoparticles. Though the strategy was time-consuming and costly, it still had the guiding significance for the fundamental studies of the relationship between the hierarchical mesopore structures and the catalytic performance in the zeolites. (49) However, the high cost of these preformed carbon materials has inhibited further industrial applications of their corresponding templated zeolites. (78) A promising alternative to the above porous carbon materials is natural and green materials that are cheap, abundant, and renewable. For example, mesoporous carbon materials derived from sugars such as sucrose (7982) and glucose (83) were also reported. A sucroseammonia mixture was hydrothermally treated and then carbonized. (79) The resultant porous carbon was impregnated with zeolite precursors; subsequently the mixture was hydrothermally treated to achieve the crystalline zeolite architecture. Homogeneously sized mesoporous Silicalite-1 single crystals were finally obtained after the carbon removal. Similarly, another cheap carbon template was in situ fabricated by the pyrolysis of sugar-impregnated silica gels. (82) These well-mixed carbon/silica composites were directly used for hydrothermal synthesis and crystallized into hierarchical ZSM-5/ZSM-11 zeolite nanocrystals (Figure 3K,L).
Polymers In the past decades, polymers, including polymer aerogels, (8490) polymer microspheres, (91101) and resins, (102109) have also been utilized to synthesize hierarchical zeolite monoliths with bimodal, trimodal, or even tetramodal porosity. Particularly, it is interesting to prepare such hierarchically porous zeolites integrating the advantages of different pore structures. (384) Generally, they are divided into supported and self-supported zeolite monoliths. For the supported ones, a layer of zeolite film is deposited on a rigid porous matrix by either in situ or ex situ coating processes. (223,385388) However, these supported zeolite monoliths usually have a low zeolite-to-support weight ratio and suffer from an easy exfoliation of the coated zeolite film and a restrained mass transport. Contrarily, the self-supported zeolite monoliths exhibit superior mass and heat transfer performances and are generally prepared by zeolite growth within a macro- or mesoporous matrix. These sacrificial substrates serve as a shape-directing macroporous template and can then be easily removed, e.g., by calcination, leaving a hierarchically porous zeolitic structure. The mostly widely used polymeric templates are carbon/organic aerogels, close-packed ordered polymer arrays, and resins.
Polymer Aerogels Resorcinolformaldehyde aerogel (RFA), used as the precursor for carbon aerogel, is characterized by its foamy structure, low-density, and open-framework. RFA is the polycondensation product of resorcinol (1,3-dihydroxybenzene) with formaldehyde. The subsequent drying of resorcinolformaldehyde (RF) gels with supercritical CO2 or supercritical acetone can retain the previous gel structure. The resultant RFAs are used as templates to fabricate mesoporous zeolites. (8487) As previously noted, mesoporous ZSM-5 and Y zeolites with high crystallinity were obtained by the CA template, (65,66) but it was difficult to obtain mesoporous zeolite A by such a rigid-structure casting method. (88) Alternatively, by using RFAs with more structural flexibility, mesoporous zeolite A (Linde Type A, LTA structure) (88) with a uniform and interconnected mesoporous structure was obtained. The resultant mesoporous zeolite A exhibited no crystalline defects, and the introduced mesopores strictly replicated the intrinsic pores in RFAs. Furthermore, RFA-templated mesoporous ZSM-5 zeolites exhibited a smaller pore volume, a larger pore size, and a wider pore-size distribution than the ones templated from CA templating. (89) It was reported that both mesopore sizes and mesopore volumes in the final zeolites are decided by the structures of the templates. (90) Therefore, CAs can create larger mesopore volumes in mesoporous zeolite ZSM-5 than those of RFAs due to their thicker pore walls and low mesopore volumes. Contrarily, the RFAs with relatively thicker and nonuniform walls resulted in mesoporous ZSM-5 zeolites with larger mesopores and a broader pore-size distribution in the mesoporous ZSM-5.
Recently, a novel polymerization-induced-colloid-aggregation process was developed for the in situ preparation of uniform hierarchical zeolite microspheres with different compositions. (86,87) Urea and formaldehyde solutions were added into the nanozeolite colloidal solutions with different compositions and then in situ polymerized after adding hydrochloric acid. By simply regulating the polymeric acidity, the morphology and composition of products were precisely controlled. The synthesized hierarchical nanozeolite microspheres exhibited a uniform spherical morphology and tunable secondary pore architecture. The change in morphology of the samples under different polymerization conditions can be explained according to the proposed polymerization-velocity match mechanism. (87) Polymer Microspheres The first three-dimensionally ordered macroporous zeolites fabricated on the basis of an assembly of PS microspheres as templates were reported by Holland et al. (91) Such macroporous zeolite monoliths with varying compositions and varying frameworks can also be synthesized by the evaporation-induced in situ self-assembly of PS microspheres and zeolite nanocrystals (92) or by casting different zeolite nanocrystals into the ordered PS arrays via infiltration. (9395) Hollow zeolite spheres were fabricated by a layer-by-layer strategy via an alternative deposition of zeolite nanocrystals and polyelectrolytes of opposite charges onto polystyrene spheres of positive charges. (96) Different hollow zeolites can be prepared by either changing the type of zeolite nanocrystals or changing the thickness of the deposited layers. (97,98) Such coreshell building blocks, which were exactly PS microspheres with a nanozeolites coating, were also used to prepare macroporous zeolite monoliths. (99) However, hollow zeolite microspheres obtained by the layer-by-layer method usually exhibited weak mechanical strength. To solve this problem, Valtchev et al. reported an effective approach to improve the mechanical strength of the layer-by-layer structured hollow zeolite sphere. (100,101) The surface charge of the polystyrene (PS) microspheres can be easily modified by simply depositing several layers of different polyelectrolytes, leading to enhanced electrostatic interaction with the building zeolite particles (Figure 4A). In this case, PS microspheres can act as sacrificial templates to fabricate hollow zeolites with hierarchically micro-macroporous structures (Figure 4B). These uniform spherical templates can further self-assemble into a highly ordered microporous structure simply by the centrifugation or sedimentation processes (Figure 4C). Therefore, zeolite monoliths with a three-dimensionally ordered macroporous structure are another main product when PS microspheres are used as macroporogen templates. (101) Figure 4 Figure 4.

Resins Using an ion exchange resin as a hard template has also been reported for the synthesis of mesoporous zeolite materials. In a typical procedure, the zeolite synthesis gel firstly was adsorbed onto the anionic ion-exchange resin beads, and then, the mesoporous Silicalite-1 zeolite microspheres were obtained after crystallization followed by calcination. (102) By this method, hierarchical palladium-containing zeolite has been reported. (103) However, such ion-exchange resins cannot be used to synthesize AlPO-n zeolites due to the existence of positively charged precursor species in the initial AlPO-synthesis gels. (104) Naydenov et al. introduced a modified method to prepare transition-metal-modified AlPO-5 spheres, allowing for the introduction of any metal ions into the AlPO-material. Vanadium-modified mesoporous AlPO-5 spheres were also prepared. (105) Besides, polyurethane foams (PUFs) can also be used as a hard template. Yoon et al. used PUF to prepare hierarchical zeolite Silicalite-1 and ZSM-5 monoliths with ramified and interconnected macropores together with tailorable sizes and shapes. (106,107) It is interesting that this PUF template gradually decomposed with the growth of the zeolitic shell, and the decomposed fragments of PUF in turn accelerated the crystallization rate. In the previous reports, bimodal porosity (micro-mesopores, micro-macropores) or even trimodal porosity was achieved by zeolite crystallization within appropriate macro- or mesoporous supports. However, for a self-supported zeolite monolith, it is still a challenge to simultaneously control the porosity on all length scales. An ideal hierarchically porous monolithic zeolite should contain macroporosity for fast mass transport, mesoporosity for precise shape selectivity, and microporosity for catalytic active sites. The macropores usually stem from the supports; the mesoporosity can be either the intercrystalline ones from the nanozeolite aggregates or the intracrystalline ones. (65,108) However, the intercrystalline mesopores are unstable and collapse during the catalytic process. Li et al. developed a one-pot synthesis strategy of a ZSM-5 zeolite monolith with controllable tetramodal porosity by using PUF as a sacrificial support through a simple steam-assisted crystallization (SAC) process. (109) A concentrated ZSM-5 precursor solution was soaked into the macropores of PUF supports. After PUF supports were removed by SAC treatment, the first-modal macroporosity in the resultant zeolite monolith (pore size of 33 μm) was formed from the PUF structure, the second-modal macroporosity (pore size of 0.21.7 μm) from the aggregated zeolite nanocrystals (crystalline size of 500 nm) in the voids of PUF, the third-modal template-free-derived mesoporosity (53 nm) from the intracrystalline voids in the zeolite nanocrystals, and the fourth-modal microporosity from the intrinsic microporosity.
In conclusion, a monolithic zeolite with a porous hierarchy can be prepared by the zeolite growth onto macro- or mesoporous resins. However, the simultaneous control over multipores inside monolithic zeolites is poor. The macropores templated by the resin are larger than 100 mm, and the macropores in the resins are not fully utilized. The mesopores in the hierarchical monolithic zeolite stemming from the intercrystalline mesopores aggregated by the zeolite nanocrystals are unstable and easily collapse during the catalytic process. Thus, it still remains a great challenge to overcome this drawback.
2.1.1.1.1.2. Inorganic Solid Materials
In addition to carbonaceous materials and polymers, other inorganic solid materials, such as mesoporous silica spheres (110120) and calcium carbonate nanoparticles, (121,122) were also used as secondary templates in hierarchical zeolite synthesis.
Mesoporous Silica Spheres It was reported that the usage and removal of polymer templates always result in environmental pollution. Besides, the calcination process to remove the polymer template cores causes considerable shrinkage (more than 20%) or even fracture in the products. (96,99) Alternatively, mesoporous silica spheres can be applied as hard templates to avoid the critical template removal step since they serve both as a mesopore/macropore template and as the silica nutrients for the growth of the zeolites, leading to their continuous digestion during the zeolite crystallization. Currently available methods involve the coating of these mesoporous silica spheres with zeolite seeds through a layer-by-layer deposition process, (110) resulting in hollow capsules with homogeneous and dense zeolitic shells (111) or robust zeolitic membranes with three-dimensional closed (112)/interconnected (113) macroporous structures. To further improve the mechanical stability and intactness of the hollow structure, a seed-induced hydrothermal crystallization process was developed to fabricate uniform hollow zeolite spheres with much lower breakage ratio (<2%) and higher mechanical stability due to the better intergrowth of zeolitic crystals formed under hydrothermal conditions compared to those prepared from the vapor phase transport (VPT) method. (114) Besides, the coordination between the zeolite shell intergrowth rate and the silica core dissolution rate in this approach was reported to be the key factor for the formation of perfect hollow zeolite spheres. (115) Similarly, Xiong et al. used spherically mesoporous SBA-15 as a silicon source and substrate to prepare hollow zeolite ZSM-5 spheres. (116) The uniform mesoporous silica (MS) spheres have also been employed to prepare three-dimensional porous zeolites with open or closed macropores. (112,113,117) A robust three-dimensional hierarchically macroporous zeolite monolith was obtained after the hydrothermal treatment of the array of nanozeolite coated MS spheres. (112,117) However, the closed macroporous system obtained did not favor mass transport. Therefore, Wang and Caruso reported a modified procedure to prepare zeolite monoliths with three-dimensionally interconnected macropores using open mesoporous silica spheres as templates. (113) The resultant zeolitic monolith with an open three-dimensionally interconnected macroporous structure demonstrated higher enzyme loadings and activities when compared with the corresponding zeolite monolith with a closed macroporous or nonporous structure. Moreover, the morphologies of these obtained hollow zeolite spheres can be easily controlled by varying the initial template morphologies. (118) For example, Song et al. reported the synthesis of a very interesting hexagonal hollow ZSM-5 tube by using mesoporous silica fibers as both the hard template and silica nutrient. (119) Recently, Machoke et al. developed a simple method to prepare zeolite crystals with an intracrystalline macropore system embedded in the zeolitic matrix (Figure 5). (120,203) This approach utilized the steam-assisted crystallization (SAC) of mesoporous silica particles (MSPs, a in Figure 5A,B) after their impregnation with tetrapropylammonium hydroxide (TPAOH). When these impregnated MSPs (b in Figure 5A) were heated to the crystallization temperature, the outer shell of the MSPs started to dissolve and increased the silica concentration on the external surface of these particles, thus initiating the nucleation and formation of the MFI nanocrystals on the external surface of the MSPs (c in Figure 5A). The dissolved silica was consumed in the following crystallization process to grow and fill the voids between the original packing of the MSPs (d in Figure 5A). This process continued until well-shaped crystals were formed. Finally, these MSP cores were dissolved which left a highly interconnected macropore network with a porosity of about 45%  5% distributed within the zeolite crystal with a classical MFI morphology (e in Figure 5A,C). (120) Macroporous zeolite single crystals ZSM-5 (201,202) and TS-1 (204) have been synthesized with the existing methods and exhibited a significantly improved catalyst performance.Figure 5 Figure 5. (A) Schematic representation of the crystallization process of macroporous zeolite crystals and corresponding (B) SEM image of the mesoporous silica spheres (MSPs). (C) TEM image of an individual zeolite crystal with corresponding zone axis electron diffraction pattern inset. Adapted with permission from ref (120). Copyright 2014 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.Calcium Carbonate Nanoparticles In addition, calcium carbonate (CaCO3) nanoparticles with spherical morphologies have also been used to prepare hierarchically porous zeolites. Xie et al. reported the synthesis of mesoporous MFI zeolites using CaCO3 as a hard template, which is cheap and easily available. (121) Interestingly, nanosized CaCO3 (average sizes of 100 nm) could also be added as a solid template into the solvent-free synthesis system to synthesize hierarchically porous zeolites by physically mixing, mechanically grinding, and then heating solid raw materials. (122) A potential advantage of CaCO3 templates is that they can bring some additional functions into zeolites. For example, the trapped CaCO3 in zeolite crystals was converted into basic CaO when the composites were calcined at a high temperature (>600 C). The resultant CaO/zeolite products exhibited both strong acidity from the zeolite and strong basicity from CaO, which would be very useful for catalysis required for both acidic and basic sites. (11) Other Inorganic Templates Other inorganic materials have also been used as templates to construct hierarchically porous zeolites. A typical example is zeolite Beta, which was used as a template to synthesize hollow BEAFAU zeolite composite spheres through a two-step hydrothermal crystallization process. (123) β-Zeolite was first prepared and used as silicon sources for the synthesis of Y-zeolite as well as the filler template for the formation of hollow spheres. Such an approach successfully avoided the complex removal procedure of the templates because the macropore template core also served as the consumption template to serve as the silica source. The fly ash cenosphere (FAC), an aluminosilicate-rich waste from power plants, was also employed as the rigid spherical template and the silica nutrient to prepare hollow zeolitic microspheres. (124) Based on this method, various hollow zeolite spheres with different frameworks were obtained by pretreating the FAC with different nanozeolite seeds. (124) Furthermore, ice was also used as a template to prepare the zeolite monolith with a microsized honeycomb structure. (125) In this approach, silica hydrogels were firstly obtained by unidirectional freezing, in which the rodlike ice crystals acted as a template for straight macropores. (126129) After removing the ice crystals by thawing and freeze drying, the silica gel precursor with a well-ordered channel of 1050 mm was obtained. Then, the obtained precursor silica gels were crystallized under steam at high temperature and pressure by using structure-directing agents (SDAs) to prepare the Silicate-1 zeolite monolith.
2.1.1.1.1.3. Biological Materials
The hard templating method is often limited by multistep procedures, which can be alleviated by using biological templates that are abundant, inexpensive, environmentally friendly, easily available, and renewable sources. Biotemplating techniques for the synthesis of bioinspired zeolites with novel shapes, complex functional patterns, and hierarchical porosity, in which the natural/biological tissues and materials are used as templates, could be of great importance for the development of zeolites with improved performances.
Biological materials, such as bacteria, (145) eggshells, (131) spider silks, (132) insects, (133) sugar cane bagasse, (134) diatoms, (135) leaves, (136,137) Luffa sponges, (138) wood, (139141) cotton threads, (142) rice husks, (143,144) starch-derived bread, (146) and starch gel, (147) are used as sacrificial templates to create additional pores in zeolites.
Generally, biomimetic zeolite replicas are achieved by adsorption or deposition of nanozeolite seeds onto the biological or natural support surface that was first modified by a cationic polyelectrolyte. (135) This was followed by the crystal growth process under a hydrothermal (139) or chemical vapor deposition (CVD) treatment. (135) For example, Valtchev et al. reported the very interesting imprinting of zeolite crystals on a leaf (Equisetum arvense) by a biomineral-silica-induced crystallization process, in which the intrinsic biogenic silica source of the leaf support acted as the promoter for the nucleation of zeolite crystals (Figure 6A,B). (136,137) Biomorphic self-supporting MFI zeolites with hierarchical porosity were prepared by an in situ seeding and secondary growth route with a Luffa sponge as the macroscale sacrificial structure template. (138) The zeolitic replica inherited the complex spongy morphology and the intricate open-porous architecture of Luffa (Figure 6C,D). Cotton threads were used to create hollow structures within zeolites, like bunchy/single hollow fiber, hollow monolith, or honeycomb structures, due to their flexibility and facility (Figure 6E,F). (142) Furthermore, carbonized rice husk was also used to fabricate ZSM-5 zeolite/porous carbon composites (Figure 6G,H). (143) However, hierarchically micro-macroporous zeolite monoliths synthesized by using natural templates usually showed poor mechanical stability and limited practical applications. Until now, only biomorphic replicas in the MFI structure (zeolite Silicalite-1 (131,135,136,138142,144147) and zeolite ZSM-5 (134,143)) and BEA structure (zeolite Beta (137)) were synthesized.

2.1.1.1.2. Soft Templating Route
Since the discovery of highly ordered mesoporous molecular sieves (M41S), soft templating methods are widely used for the synthesis of hierarchically porous zeolites. (75,389) Soft templates, including silylated polymers, (148150) hydrophilic cationic polymers, (151168) cationic organosilanes, (169174) and surfactants, (75,158163,165,175197) exhibit inherent flexibility and advantages, such as tunable size and adjustable functionality, and are more versatile than hard templates. During the crystallization process, these templates not only serve as physical supports but also directly interact with the silica species. (390403) Thus, the key factor is to choose the appropriate soft templates. The soft templates should (1) be stable in alkaline media even at 140180 C as the zeolite synthesis generally occurs in alkaline conditions, (2) be positively charged to achieve the strong interaction with negative silica species, (3) be of suitable mesoscale sizes in aqueous solution, and (4) be of low cost. Besides, the structure of the soft templates can be generally and easily controlled either by altering its functional groups or by changing the packing parameter of the surfactants. Thus, the soft template route offers a versatile way to tailor the mesopores. Using this method, either inter- or intracrystalline mesopores can be created in the zeolites by using designed organic molecules, self-organized molecule arrays, or emulsion forming agents. There are two general approaches, one is primary methods in which all the components (including the surfactant) are introduced into the synthesis system at the beginning of a one-step synthesis; the other is secondary methods in which all the components except the surfactant are introduced at the first step, and the surfactant is then added at the last step of a two-step procedure prior to the hydrothermal synthesis. (15)
2.1.1.1.2.1. Primary Methods
The main characteristic of the primary methods is one-step synthesis in which all the components are added at the beginning of synthesis.
Nonsurfactant Polymers The largest category of soft templates is macromolecular structures, such as soluble nonsurfactant polymers. They are largely available and tunable in their chemical composition, molar mass, and surface charge. For example, nonsurfactants such as silylated polymers or cationic polymers proved to be effective primary templates. The silylated polymers were used as mesopore templates to create intracrystalline mesopores within the zeolite matrix. (148150) Pinnavaia et al. reported that the SiO3 units in the silylated polymer allowed for its graft onto the zeolite surface by the formation of covalent SiOSi linkages (Figure 7A). (148) As the zeolite crystals grew, the incorporated polymers were phase-segregated from the zeolite matrix, resulting in an intracrystalline polymer network that was covalently linked to the zeolite framework. Mesoporous MFI zeolites were obtained after the removal of the polymer template. Each particle consisted of randomly oriented small mesopores (Figure 7B). Besides, the lattice fringes extended throughout the whole particle, thus indicating that each particle was a single crystal (Figure 7C). Another successful material was reported by Wang et al. (149) The synthesis was based on reducing the growth of zeolite crystals. Phenylaminopropyltrimethoxy-silane was used as a growth inhibitor to prevent the further aggregation of the zeolite seeds by silanization. Thus, the surface functionalization with silane coupling agents of nanozeolite precursors was considered to be a confined space synthesis. Furthermore, Hu et al. used organosilanes with amino-, mercapto-, and allyl- surface groups to control the growth of ZSM-5 nanocrystals. (206) Various organic functional groups can be regularly grafted on the surface of nanozeolites in situ, and the resulting nanozeolite particles not only preserve their nanosize and high crystallinity but also provide a diverse surface.

Hydrophilic cationic polymers exhibit a strong interaction with silica-based species due to their high positive charge and high alkali resistance stabilities in the high-temperature process (up to 200 C). The first example of their use as mesopore templates was reported by Xiao et al. (151153) They used a mesoscale hydrophilic cationic polymer (polydiallyldimethylammonium chloride, PDADMAC) to create the intracrystalline mesoporosity in zeolite Beta single crystals (Figure 7D). (151) The high charge density of the soft templates can effectively prevent the interfacial incompatibility between the template and zeolite gel. As mentioned above, the incompatibility always existed between the uncharged and hydrophobic templates such as carbons and the negatively charged aluminosilicate gels. After their self-assembling with aluminosilicate species, the fiberlike polymers dispersed homogeneously within the synthetic gel and were then entirely embedded in zeolite crystals after the hydrothermal crystallization. The calcined samples had a disordered mesopore system between 5 and 40 nm. These mesopores are partially continuous and opened to the external surface of the sample, which significantly improved the accessibility of reactants to the active sites of such mesoporous H-Beta zeolite (Figure 7E,F). The pore size could be tuned in a certain range by simply varying amounts of the soft templates in the synthesis gel during the hydrothermal synthesis. They further demonstrated a series of nonsurfactant polymers as dual-function templates for synthesizing hierarchical zeolites that feature open, interconnected mesopores. (154) The resultant three-dimensional single-crystalline zeolite framework was different from previously reported two-dimensional zeolite nanosheets or agglomerations of zeolite nanocrystals, in which the surfactant templates create an ordered mesostructure at the sacrifice of crystallinity. Nonsurfactant polymers have multiple advantages in synthesizing hierarchical zeolites. They have minimized intermolecular interactions, which have little influence on the zeolite crystallization process and thus contribute to the high zeolitic character of the final products. Besides, the mutual interpenetration of the polymers and the zeolite crystalline network provides disordered but highly interconnected mesopores within zeolites. Thus, nonsurfactant polymers allow for the synthesis of mesoporous zeolite single crystals with various compositions and different framework types. Moreover, extra functional groups can be added in the polymers to incorporate desired functionalities into hierarchical zeolites.
Introducing specially oriented and ordered mesopores within soft templates is still a great challenge. To achieve this, Xiao and coworkers synthesized a designed cationic amphiphilic copolymer by treating the copolymer polystyrene-co-4-polyvinylpyridine with methyl iodide (C-PSt-co-P4VP, Figure 8A, inset). (155) Using this polymer, unidirectional mesopores of 660 nm were introduced within the ZSM-5 single crystals along the b-axis owing to their strong interactions with the negatively charged silica species (Figure 8A,B). The resulting zeolite ZSM-5 with oriented mesopores showed a much higher catalytic conversion than that of the ZSM-5 with nonoriented mesopores in the condensation reaction of bulky substrates. They further used a conventional nonsurfactant cationic polymer (polydiallyldimethylammonium chloride, PDADMA, Figure 8C, inset) as a dual-function template to simultaneously generate micropores and b-oriented mesopores within zeolite Beta single crystals (Figure 8C,D). (156) The quaternary ammonium groups on the polymer served as a structure-directing agent (SDA) for the zeolite, the same as surfactant-based dual-function templates. (157164) It should be noted that, without hydrophobic segments, PDADMA did not self-assemble in aqueous solution to form micelles or ordered liquid crystalline structures that would disrupt the crystallization of the zeolite framework. Besides, the flexible PDADMA molecules do not affect the crystallization of zeolites into a thermodynamically stable form, that is, into a single crystal.

Obviously, the cationic polymer templating approach is not limited to hierarchically mesoporous ZSM-5 and Beta zeolites, which were synthesized by mixing mesoscale PDADMAC with microscale tetraethylammonium hydroxide. By blending mesoscale cationic polymer templates with other small organic ammoniums, a series of hierarchically mesoporous zeolites with various structures are obtained. (153) Moreover, the great diversity of available low-cost industrial cationic polymers makes it possible to fabricate a wide range of hierarchically mesoporous zeolites on an industrial scale.
One of the most important problems in the above-mentioned soft template directed synthesis of hierarchical zeolite is the long hydrothermal time required for zeolite synthesis. In particular, it is of notable concern for zeolites with a relatively high Al content. To solve this problem, a bulk crystal seeding method was developed and found to be effective in the hierarchical zeolite synthesis. (165) In a typical synthesis, a purely microporous ZSM-5 zeolite sample with a Si/Al ratio of 15 was added into the synthesis reaction gel as the crystallization-accelerating seed. This ZSM-5 zeolite was composed of aggregates of 100200 nm bulk crystals. This resulted in a five-fold rapid generation of MFI nanosheets. It was reported that seeding is an effective way to minimize the use of the organotemplate in the syntheses of hierarchically porous zeolites, resulting in cost and waste reduction and subsequent economic and environmental benefits. (166) Besides the inclusion in zeolite crystals, polymers can also be used to introduce mesoporosity in zeolites by assisting in the aggregation of zeolite particles, leading to the formation of interparticle mesoporosity. For example, Song et al. reported a novel synthesis route for the self-assembly of Beta zeolite nanocrystals with the help of mesoscale cationic polymer PDADMAC, conducting to the formation of bulky Beta particles containing interparticle mesoporosity. (167) Notably, the mesopores in the bulky Beta zeolite sample are disordered, which may be due to the use of irregular cationic polymers. (151) In comparison, the use of surfactant micelles will usually result in the formation of ordered mesostructures. (75,76) If PDADMAC was substituted by conventional surfactant molecules such as cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB), the bulky particles were not obtained. This suggested that the mesoscale cationic polymers with high charge density are easily assembled with Beta zeolite nanocrystals via their surface hydroxyl groups, leading to the aggregation of Beta zeolite nanocrystals to form bulky Beta zeolite particles. It is difficult for the conventional surfactants with relatively low charge density and small sizes to create a strong interaction with the surface hydroxyl groups of Beta zeolite nanocrystals and thus direct the self-assembly of zeolite nanocrystals. Moreover, polymers can also act indirectly as flocculating agents. Nanozeolite aggregates with tunable interparticle mesopores were synthesized by the flocculating action of a cationic polymer polydiallyldimethylammonium chloride (PDDA). (168) With PDDA, highly-concentrated zeolite Beta precursor firstly crystallized into zeolite nanocrystals, and then, these crystals aggregated in a one-step procedure with nearly 100% yield, exhibiting interparticle mesopores with very high mesopore volumes and surface areas. In addition, the interstitial mesopore size in the zeolite nanocrystals can be tuned between 40 and 400 nm by varying the polymer concentration, which is an important parameter.
Organosilanes In order to create mesopores less than 10 nm in zeolites, Pinnavaia and coworkers used silylated polymers to effectively construct zeolite morphologies. (148) The phase separation between the zeolite precursor and the organosilanes is minimized due to the formation of the covalent SiOSi linkage. Both the incorporated silicane fraction and the micropore template were removed after calcination. For example, polyethylenimine or poly(propylene oxide) diamine was silylated with glycidoxypropyl trimethoxysilane and was then incorporated into the zeolite precursor gel. The resultant zeolites exhibited intracrystalline mesopores of 23 nm, and the pore size was decided by the silylated polymers. For these silylated templates, the silylated ends are anchored in the zeolites while the alkyl fragments created the mesopores. Tunable length and composition of the alkyl fraction lead to various hierarchically porous zeolites. A great variety of alkylated siloxanes have been reported. Generally, these templates are divided into cationic organosilane surfactants, neutral alkyl amino siloxanes, and alkylated siloxanes. Cationic organosilane surfactants are directly used as mesopore templates to synthesize hierarchically porous zeolites, which will be discussed in this section. Neutral alkyl amino siloxanes and alkylated siloxanes are always used to functionalize the zeolitic seeds to further prevent the zeolite growth.
Cationic organosilanes were first synthesized by Ryoo and coworkers to prevent the separate formation of zeolite and ordered mesoporous molecular sieves. (169) The cationic organic molecules balance the negative charge of the zeolite framework, or they fill the space in the voids of zeolite framework, thus stabilizing the formation of zeolite phases under the required conditions. The organosilane surfactant has a hydrolysable methoxysilyl moiety connected to a hydrophilic quaternary ammonium and a hydrophobic alkyl tail. (170) The template 3-(trimethoxysilyl propyl))hexadecyl dimethylammonium chloride ([(CH3O)3SiC3H6N(CH3)2C16H33]Cl, TPHAC) was added directly to the conventional MFI synthesis gel and then hydrothermally converted to zeolite phase (Figure 9A). (169) In a typical zeolite synthesis condition, the CH3OSi bonds in TPHAC firstly hydrolyzed to HOSi and then formed SiOSi or SiOAl covalent bonds with silica or alumina sources. Thus, the surfactant micelles of TPHAC were well incorporated within the zeolite product. This was mainly due to the participation of the silica moiety present in TPHAC to the zeolite crystal formation with sodium silicate (or tetraethylorthosilicate, TEOS). Meanwhile, the quaternary ammonium head groups serve as SDA, and the hydrophobic alkyl tails assemble into a micelle, creating uniform mesopores within zeolites (Figure 9B,C). Besides, the mesopore size can be precisely controlled by simply extending the hydrophobic tail length of the TPHAC template (169) or by adding higher concentrations of the organosilanes. (172) Depending on the different alkyl chain lengths ranging from C12 to C18 in TPHAC, disordered wormholelike mesopores of about 27 nm were created (Figure 9D,E). (169) An extension of mesopore size to 24 nm was observed when the synthesis gel was enriched with the triblock copolymer EO20PO70EO20 (poly(ethylene oxide)poly(propylene oxide)poly(ethylene oxide), P123). (172) Xiao and coworkers further extended this synthesis strategy to synthesize a series of aluminosilicate zeolites with other zeolite structures like the LTA structure (zeolite A), (171,172) and other framework compositions like aluminophosphate zeolites with the CHA structure (zeolite SSZ-13), FAU structure (zeolite faujasite-X), (173) AFI structure (zeolite AlPO4-5), (174) and AEL structure (zeolite AlPO4-11). (174) For example, it was generally difficult to introduce mesopores into zeolite X, the high-aluminum version of FAU (Si/Al ratio 1.01.5), using the commonly applied desilication route; however, using the octadecyl derivative TPOAB ([(C2H5O)3SiC3H6N(CH3)2C18H37]Br), mesopores were successfully introduced into zeolite X.

The organosilane surfactant is also a promising candidate to control the formation of nanosheets, especially for the zeolites with a low Si/Al ratio that are difficult to be prepared by using other types of SDAs. (173) The direct synthesis of zeolites with layered structures via the SDA approach is still in an early stage of development. Recently, this approach has been employed to prepare hierarchical zeolite nanosheets with MFI and FAU topologies. (405) Surfactants Monovalent Surfactants The specially designed amphiphilic organosilane surfactants and nonsurfactant polymers offer precise control over mesoporosity, but they are difficult to synthesize and very expensive. Thus, it is still desirable to use conventional cationic surfactants, which are cheap and readily scalable porogens to introduce mesopores into zeolites. Due to their excellent mesopore-generating role in the synthesis of ordered mesoporous materials, surfactants are considered as a reasonable template to synthesize hierarchically porous zeolites. Initial attempts of such approaches were based on the use of mixed templates of monovalent surfactant molecules, such as cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTABr, mesopore template) and small organic ions, such as tetrapropylammonium (TPA+, micropore template), to simultaneously generate mesoporous and microporous structures in a single zeolite material. (406) However, the interaction of the zeolite with monofunctional surfactants (e.g., CTABr) is not strong enough to compete with the zeolite-forming SDA (e.g., TPA+ for MFI zeolite). (15,178,383,407) In most cases, only a physical mixture of bulk zeolite and an amorphous mesoporous material was obtained due to the phase separation caused by the competition between the two different templating systems. (175) To improve the interaction between the conventional monovalent cationic surfactants and the negatively charged silica-based species during zeolite synthesis, cosolvents such as tert-butyl alcohol (TBA) and1,3,5-trimethylbenzene (TMB) were introduced into the synthesis system, thus facilitating the condensation of the zeolites around the surfactant micelles and resulting in the formation of hierarchically mesoporous zeolites (Figure 10A). Using this method, hierarchically mesoporous zeolites, such as Y or sodalite, were synthesized (Figure 10B). (176) The addition of cosolvent altered the assembly of the surfactant micelle and increased the charge density of the micelle, resulting in an enhanced interaction between the silica species and the surfactant micelles. The resultant materials exhibited a high surface area and large pore volume from the self-assembly of zeolite nanocrystals (Figure 10C). (176) Figure 10 Figure 10.

Cotemplates, such as nonionic amphiphilic copolymer F127, (408) sulfonic-acid-ended organosilane, (409) carboxyl-ended organosilane, (410) and amphiphilic organosilane, (179) were added to assist CTABr in synthesizing hierarchically mesoporous ZSM-5 without the phase separation between the mesoporous phase and microporous zeolite phase. For example, Wang et al. reported the preparation of a hierarchically mesoporous ZSM-5 on the basis of a dual surfactant system made by mixing an amphiphilic organosilane (3-[(trimethoxysilyl) propyl] octyldimethylammonium chloride, TPOAC) and an ordinary surfactant (CTABr). (179) The effects of different combinations (different molar ratios) of these two mesogeneous templates (TPOAC/CTABr) on the mesoporosity of the highly siliceous mesoporous ZSM-5 zeolites were also studied. CTABr showed a more effective retarding effect than TPOAC on the nucleation and crystallization of the MFI structure. The effect of hydrothermal conditions on the interactions between surfactant molecules and silicate species has been made evident and has been shown to also play a crucial role in the structural transformations of silica precursors. Chen et al. found that, in the silicate-CTABr system, the original hexagonal structure of MCM-41 transformed to lamellar and then to the microporous MFI framework as the reaction temperature increased from room temperature to 150 C and then to 165C, respectively. (210) Besides, several successful attempts were reported in which microporous zeolites were crystallized at room temperature. (211213) Thus, the low-temperature crystallization of zeolites in the presence of surfactant micelles seemed to be a possible approach to synthesize hierarchically porous zeolites. There were a few reports on the synthesis of LTA (Linde type A) zeolite nanocrystals with CTABr. (207209) In these procedures, the organic surfactant was used as a capping agent to effectively minimize the crystalline size of the zeolite. The surfactant prevented further crystal growth by covering nanoparticle surfaces by electrostatic attraction, coordination bonding, or hydrogen bonding, or even using weak van der Waals interaction to the surface atoms. (180) The observed hierarchically porous structure in the products followed a two-stage growth mechanism. Small zeolite nanoparticles were formed and assembled around the CTABr micelles at the early stage of the gel evolution. The slow crystalline rate of the amorphous phase and the low growth rate of the formed crystals kept the CTABr micelles within the crystalline domain during the second stage. After template removal, the resultant zeolites exhibited abundant mesopores due to the intercrystalline voids among the aggregated zeolite nanocrystals. However, the surfactant capping was not effective enough to generalize the synthesis of hierarchical zeolites with other frameworks. The difficulties in the synthesis of hierarchically mesoporous zeolites using the conventional monovalent surfactant as soft templates have been mainly attributed to the weak binding between these monovalent surfactant molecules and silicate species which induces the phase separation. (411413) Multivalent Surfactants To avoid the severe phase separation observed in the synthesis using monovalent surfactants, two-in-one (dual-function) templates have been developed which are surfactant-based. (158161,177) The synthesis of hierarchically porous zeolites using multivalent surfactants has been reported. (178181) These surfactants directed a periodically ordered mesostructure by the self-assembled supramolecular micelle while micropores were generated by individual surfactant head groups. (182) Thus, the surfactants should have a sufficiently strong interaction with the growing zeolite surface to effectively compete with the zeolite SDA to allow for successful dual-template synthesis of hierarchical zeolites. (183185) Wu et al. synthesized a mesoporous CHA zeolite by using C22H45N+(Me)2C4H8N+(Me)2C4H9 as a mesopore template in a synthesis mixture containing N,N,N-trimethyl-adamantanammonium hydroxide for the micropore formation. The mesopore was generated by the growth interruption of zeolite crystals. Jo et al. further synthesized FAU-, MOR-, CHA-, and MFI-type zeolite nanocrystals using the capping effect of the multivalent cationic surfactants in the hydrothermal synthesis conditions. (180) The nanocrystals formed due to the stronger and multiple binding effect of the surfactant molecules on the zeolite surfaces when compared with monovalent surfactants. The agglomerated zeolite nanocrystals possessed intercrystalline mesopores. However, the zeolite morphologies (nanoparticles, nanorods, and nanosheets) and the intrinsic zeolite structures were still controlled by the surfactants.
The phase separation could be effectively eliminated in the synthesis using dual-function templates. However, there are still two major processes which are neither thermodynamically nor kinetically compatible: the condensation of aluminosilicates that forms the micropores and the assembly of surfactants that creates mesopores. The mesopores induce great strains inside zeolite structures. A supramolecular self-assembled mesoscale structure forms rapidly while the zeolites crystallize slowly. Therefore, it is quite difficult to simultaneously realize the long-range order of both micropores and mesopores. Surfactant-based templates create the ordered mesopores within zeolites at the cost of the crystallinity of the zeolite structure. Consequently, most developed zeolites possessed a lamellar structure with alternated two-dimensional zeolite nanosheets. For those two-dimensional zeolites (2D zeolites) constructed by nanosheets or nanosheet assemblies, the third dimension is limited to 23 nm, that is, a 12 unit cell. They exhibited large intersheet mesopore volume, high external surface area, open porous structures, and a large number of exposed acidic or catalytic sites when compared with conventional three-dimensional zeolites.
Long-chain alkyl-quaternary ammonium molecules are usually used to synthesize mesoporous silica materials due to the strong interactions between quaternary ammonium species with the inorganic frameworks. (75,186189) Choi et al. were the first to succeed in synthesizing lamellar mesostructured zeolites with dual-function surfactants (C22H45N+(CH3)2C6H12N+(CH3)2C6H13, C22-6-6). (157) The ammonium head groups induced the conversion of the amorphous silica precursor to the microporous crystalline zeolitic framework while the self-assembled surfactant tails directed the zeolite crystal morphology into the formation of a lamellar mesostructure. Based on the synthesis condition, the MFI zeolite nanosheets could be obtained in the form of multilamellar stacked MFI nanosheets (Figure 11AC) or unilamellar MFI nanosheets (Figure 11DF). For these multilamellar MFI zeolite nanosheets, the samples were arranged in a regular way along b-axis, resulting in the formation of uniform mesopores between neighboring nanosheets. However, the ordered mesopores disappeared after calcination. (157) An effective approach to inhibit the collapse of MFI zeolite layers is to introduce silica pillars in the interlayer space to maintain the ordered mesoporous structure of multilamellar MFI zeolite nanosheets. (158) Figure 11 Figure 11. (A) Schematic representation of MFI nanosheets that regularly assembled into multilamellar mesostructures.

After the success of the C22-6-6 dual-functional surfactant, Ryoo and co-workers extended the synthesis strategy to various zeolite structures (MFI, BEA, MRE, and MTW) in the form of nanosheets or nanosponges (165,190,191) by varying the localized SDA groups in surfactant molecules (160163,192194) and mesoporous structures.
A series of Gemini-type multiammonium surfactants (Figure 12A) were synthesized and used as structure-directing agents (SDAs) for ordered mesoporous molecular sieves with a crystalline microporous structure. (162,182) For example, a triquaternary ammonium surfactant C18H37N+(CH3)2C6H12N+(CH3)2C6H12N+(CH3)2C18H37 (18-N3-18) generated a hexagonally ordered mesoporous molecular sieve that possessed crystalline walls (Figure 12BD). (162) The multicationic fractions in the surfactant generated the micropores. Contrarily, the resultant zeolite Beta nanocrystals aggregated in a disordered arrangement when the micropore porogenic part in the surfactants is replaced by a phenyl group, (162) as reported in the synthesis of disordered mesoporous molecular sieves like KIT-1. (414) Besides, the average thickness of the framework is directly decided by the quantities of the ammonium groups in the surfactant. More ammonium groups led to thicker walls. Moreover, the mesopore size was tunable from 3.8 to 21 nm by using 1,3,5-trimethylbenzene (1,3,5-TMB) as a micelle-swelling agent. (157) Figure 12 Figure 12. (A) Gemini-type polyquaternary ammonium organic surfactants: (a) 18-N3-18, (b) 22-N4-22, (c) N4-phe, (d) N6-diphe, and (e) N8-triphe from top to bottom, respectively (white spheres, hydrogen; gray spheres, carbon; red spheres, nitrogen).

Recently, Xu et al. reported that aromatic groups introduced into the hydrophobic tail of the surfactant molecules (195,196) not only provide ππ interactions that could stabilize the lamellar micelle but also adjust their configuration to geometrically match the MFI zeolitic framework (Figure 13A). It was found that the dual stabilization effects made by multiple positively charged ammonium heads and the strong ππ interactions in the surfactant template energetically favored the formation of an MFI zeolite framework with a 90 rotational structure (Figure 13B). The resulting zeolite nanosheets had a hierarchically micro-meso-macroporous structure, in which the primary microporosity formed in the MFI nanosheet and the secondary mesopores in the 90 rotational boundary, and the tertiary macropores were constructed by the mutual pillaring between the plates. A theoretical analysis further confirmed that the coexistence of multiple quaternary ammonium heads and aromatic group tails in one surfactant molecule would significantly reduce the binding energies for mesostructured zeolites. Furthermore, they realized the cylindrical assembly of surfactants by introducing azobenzene into the hydrophobic tail of a surfactant with a diquaternary ammonium head group. This allowed the formation of ordered mesoporous MFI zeolite with an ordered two-dimensional square mesostructure (Figure 13C). (197) Figure 13 Figure 13.

2.1.1.1.2.2. Secondary Methods
As previously defined, the secondary methods contain a two-step synthesis process, in which all the components except the surfactant are added in the first step, while in the second step the soft template can either assist the assembly of zeolite seeds into hierarchically porous structures (149,169,214218,415) or form microemulsions/reverse micelles for confined space synthesis/steam-assisted conversion of hierarchically porous zeolites. (219222,416) Soft Template-Assisted Assembly of Zeolite Seeds into Hierarchically Porous Structures Neutral organosilanes, such as phenylaminopropyl trimethoxysilane (PHAPTMS), were also used to introduce mesopores in zeolites. Serrano and coworkers reported a multiple-step seed-silanization route to synthesize zeolite nanocrystals with extremely small crystal sizes and enhanced surface area and mesopore volume by interrupting the zeolite crystallization process through seed silanization. (149) The method was based on hindering the zeolite growth by modifying the zeolite seeds with PHAPTMS to avoid aggregating. The incorporated organosilane groups created interparticle mesopores among zeolite nanocrystals. The type and quantity of these organic fractions are key factors to decide the textural properties of the resultant zeolites. By this method, aggregates of zeolite (ZSM-5 and Beta) nanocrystals with interparticle mesopores were obtained. (149) The resultant MFI zeolites have identical textural properties with the ones templated by TPHAC described in the previous section as part of the primary method. (169) Both methods resulted in the aggregation of crystalline zeolite nanocrystals (10 nm) and created a large total surface area of 590 m2 g1 and a uniform mesopore size centered at about 5 nm. The study on the effect of the nature of surface-silanization species on the synthesis of hierarchically porous zeolite ZSM-5 nanocrystals was further carried out and showed that PHAPTMS was the best choice. (415) Moreover, they studied the effect of the main synthesis variables in order to obtain Beta zeolite samples with large external surface area and high pore volume. The mesoporosities of these nanozeolites were easily controlled either by varying the precrystallization conditions or by changing the quantity or the type of the organosilane. (216) Based on their previous studies, Serrano et al. synthesized mesoporous zeolite ZSM-5 by the crystallization of organosilane (PHAPTMS)-functionalized zeolite nanoseeds under hydrothermal conditions. The removal of the structure-directing agent and organosilane was made by calcination. (214) The anchoring of organosilanes on the external surface of the zeolitic seeds was a decisive factor to prevent the nanozeolite from further growing into large crystals (Figure 14A). The resultant mesoporous ZSM-5 zeolite particles of about 300400 nm were aggregations of ultrasmall zeolite crystallites below 10 nm with a significant degree of intergrowth (Figure 14B,C).

Moreover, it was found that, due to the strong interaction between the silanization agent and the linear alcohols, the viscosity of the gel decreased, and the silanization degree of the nanozeolites increased by combining silanization with alkoxylation by adding alcohols like 2-propanol or methanol. (217) For example, based on this strategy, Zhu et al. synthesized hierarchically mesoporous zeolites through the direct self-assembly of the kinetic controlled zeolite seeds. The resultant materials exhibited intercrystalline or intracrystalline mesoporosity. (218) It was realized by a two-step procedure. The zeolite synthesis gel was firstly aged at 100C for various time intervals to form sub-nanocrystals (zeolite seeds) with various degrees of polymerization. (218) Subsequently, the surfactant was added to direct the self-assembly of these sub-nano-pre-crystalline zeolites in hydrothermal synthesis conditions. Finally, either a mixture of mesoporous silica and microporous zeolite; mesoporous zeolites with cubic shape; or aggregates of nanocrystals with intercrystalline mesopores were obtained depending on the aging time of the zeolite seeds. (218) Simple alkylated siloxanes (alkyl = methyl, propyl, and octyl) were also reported by Srivastava et al. to synthesize mesoporous ZSM-5. (215) The size of zeolite nanocrystals was reduced to 20 nm by adding alkyltriethoxysilane into the conventional zeolite synthesis gel. Such an alkyltriethoxysilane-mediated synthesis method can effectively control the size of the zeolite crystals, particle morphology, and mesoporosity.
Use of Microemulsions and Reverse Micelles Another example of soft templating is the synthesis of hierarchically porous zeolites in microemulsions which function as nanoreactors for the zeolite growth. (416) They are as effective as the confined voids in porous carbons. (16,4550) Generally, the main principle in this approach is the phase-separation process of a mixture (an organic and an aqueous phase) during the zeolite formation, resulting in a stable, biphasic emulsion formed by the zeolite mixture (aqueous phase) and the porogen (organic solvent). (219,220) Thus, cosurfactants are necessary to assist surfactants to avoid the complete phase-separation in the microemulsion. (221) For example, polyoxyethylene nonylphenyl ether (nonionic surfactant) and butanol (cosurfactant) were used as emulsifiers to generate the aqueous droplets, consisting of TEOS/TPAOH/H2O, in heptane (organic solvent). (220) For each aqueous nanodroplet, zeolite Silicate-1 crystallized independently during the hydrothermal process. The surfactant adsorption became obvious as these encapsulated zeolites grew into a certain size, resulting in the aggregation of spherical microparticles constructed by zeolite nanocrystals. The resultant material exhibited intrinsic micropores and additional inter- or intraparticle meso-macropores. The crystallinity and size of such agglomerates can be easily modified by altering the aqueous phase and the concentration of water. (220) Similarly, Lee and Shantz also used microemulsions to synthesize Silicalite-1 microspheres/platelets aggregated by zeolite nanocrystals. (222) In contrast, Li et al. used a two-step approach. (219) The organic phase (CTAM in ethanol) was emulsified in the aqueous zeolite synthesis solution. The mixture was aged and then dried at 60 C to obtain an amorphous dry gel containing zeolite precursor, microporous SDA, and CTABr micelles (mesoporogen). The dry gel was then crystallized in the steam-assisted conversion process and transformed into hierarchically porous zeolite Silicalite-1 with interconnected trimodal pores. In such a two-step process, the generation of additional meso- or macropores is separated from the formation of crystalline zeolite. Thus, it can also be considered as a crystallization process in which a porous amorphous material successfully transformed into a hierarchically porous zeolite.
2.1.1.2. Indirect Templating Route
Hierarchical zeolite materials, including zeolite composites and zeolite monoliths, can also be prepared without direct mesopore or macropore porogens. In the indirect templating route, hierarchically porous zeolite is synthesized by partial zeolite crystallization of a mesoporous material (active composite partner) or by the deposition of microporous zeolites onto a mesoporous skeleton (inert composite partner). It is actually a borderline between direct templating and nontemplating routes. The indirect templating method typically produces composites consisting of supported nanosized zeolite crystals. Generally, these composite partners are divided into inert supports (223,224,385,386,417430) and active supports. (108,225243,431461) The inert supports can only be used as a macroporous template and cannot be used as the initial nutrients. (223,224,385,386,417430) The active supports generally contain one or two components, such as silica materials, porous glass, aluminosilicates, and titanosilicates, which might be able to form the building blocks of the zeolite framework. (108,225243,431459)
2.1.1.2.1. Inert Composite Partner
Zeolite composites have at least one additional material apart from zeolites. Generally, the synthesis of hierarchically porous zeolite composites includes a zeolite-shaping process (spray drying, granulation, tableting, or extrusion) by using either inorganic (silica, alumina, silicaalumina, or their mixtures) or organic (cellulose) binders (417,418) and ex situ or in situ zeolite coating on additional supports which should either be able to generate intercrystalline porosity or be porous itself, respectively. In most cases, binders such as SiO2 nanoparticles are added to the suspensions or slurries in order to obtain the stable zeolite coatings. Physicochemical interactions occurring between a zeolite and a binder during the shaping process result in composites with properties different from their simple mechanical mixture. However, the addition of binders often causes a decrease in the performance of zeolites due to the micropore blocking or the inactivation of active sites. (419) To overcome these disadvantages, a number of new methods to synthesize the hierarchically structured zeolite composites with meso- and/or macropores without binders were developed. An alternative way is to deposit zeolite nanoparticles onto the surface of supports with tailored macropores. Hierarchically structured catalysts with zeolites as active components and inert porous materials as supports have been reported. Various porous materials can be used as inert supports, such as glass, (385) porous α-Al2O3, (386,420) alumina ceramic foam, (421) stainless steel, (422,423) cordierite honeycomb, (424) and SiC. (425429) Generally, the hierarchical zeolite composites were obtained by a conventional one-step hydrothermal crystallization. In a typical process, the supports were first immersed into a zeolite synthesis solution, and then, the surface of the macroporous supports was loaded or coated with the zeolite crystals, leading to the desired inter-macroporosity. Zampieri et al. deposited MFI (Silicalite-1 or ZSM-5) zeolite nanocrystals on the ceramic foam supports through an in situ hydrothermal method, resulting in a novel zeoliteceramic composite with the bimodal pore system. (223) Similarly, Wang et al. reported the layer-by-layer coating of zeolite nanocrystals on diatom supports. (430) However, in these hierarchically structured zeolite composites, the zeolite loading and the zeolitesupport bond still need to be improved since weak acidity and poor mechanical strength will significantly limit their further applications. (224)
2.1.1.2.2. Active Composite Partners
2.1.1.2.2.1. Partial Crystallization of Active Composite Partners
An effective method to ameliorate the mechanical strength of the hierarchically porous zeolitic composites is to use supports that function both as a macroporous template and as initial silica and alumina nutrients. The active support can be partially crystallized during the construction of the micro-macropore structures, resulting in the successful incorporation of the active component into the monolith structure. These supports include hierarchically meso-macroporous silica or aluminosilicates, (227,230,236,238,431433) sintered kaolin honeycomb, (434,462) diatoms, (435) biomorphic rattan-derived cellular Si-SiC ceramics, (436,437) pumice granules, (438) and porous glass. (439443) Generally, the preparation routes are divided into in situ and ex situ crystallization of the consolidated supports. Various methods are available for the synthesis of monolithic structures, such as extrusion, (444) inverse replication, (445) hydrothermal treatment, (227,433) dry-gel conversion, (435) and 3D printing. (446) In all these examples, the supports were partly crystallized and still worked as macroporous supports.
