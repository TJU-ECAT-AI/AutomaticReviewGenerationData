γ-Al2O3 sheet-stabilized isolate Co2+ for catalytic propane dehydrogenation Highlights • Isolate Co2+ in γ-Al2O3 sheet efficiently catalyze propane dehydrogenation to propylene. • Tetrahedral Co2+ species can be stabilized by γ-Al2O3 sheet with a strong interaction. • Active Co2+ sites not only accelerate C3H6 desorption but also inhibit coke formation.
Abstract Co-based catalysts are promising alternatives to replace Pt- and Cr-based catalysts for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) in view of the catalytic activity for CH bond activation, low cost, and low toxicity. However, the reduction of unstable CoOx species and coke deposition cause serious catalyst deactivation. In this work, a sheet-shaped CoAl2O3 catalyst comprising of isolate Co2+ sites shows a high intrinsic activity (specific reaction rate > 16 mmol g1 h1) and catalytic stability in highly selective PDH reaction (>97% C3H6 selectivity). Extensive characterization demonstrates that the tetrahedral Co2+ isolated site is stabilized by the γ-Al2O3 matrix, facilitating propylene desorption to inhibit formation of coke and other byproducts and to free the active Co sites.

1. Introduction
Propylene is a key commodity chemical for the manufacture of a wide variety of products such as polypropylene, propylene oxide, acetone, acrylonitrile and acrolein [1] ,[2] ,[3] ,[4] . The increasing global demand of propylene and a large reserve of propane in shale-gas deposits are drawing interests in employing catalytic propane dehydrogenation (PDH) to produce propylene. The commercial PDH processes are based on two kinds of primary technologies, the Oleflex process with PtSn/Al2O3 catalyst and the Catofin process with Cr/Al2O3 catalyst [5] . For Pt-based catalysts, the electronic modification by promoters and the specific interaction with the optimized supports lead to the enhancement in both catalytic activity and stability [6] ,[7] ,[8] ,[9] ,[10] ,[11] . However, the high price of Pt metal and the serious toxicity issue of Cr catalyst greatly restrict the further development of the PDH process. Development of cost-effective and environmentally friendly catalysts (e.g., Ga-, Zn- or Sn-based candidates) remains as an important catalytic challenge [12] ,[13] ,[14] ,[15] ,[16] ,[17] ,[18] ,[19] ,[20] ,[21] ,[22] ,[23] ,[24] .
Low-coordinate cobalt species (Co+/Co2+) are known to be efficient in CH activation for hydrocarbons [25] . It has been reported that the oxygen-deficient cobalt/oxygen cluster ions could accomplish the dehydrogenation of isobutane via the insertion into the CH bond with formation of the [CoxOx-1C4H8]+ intermediates [26] . The isotopic labelling kinetics of Co+-catalyzed CH and CC activation of C3H8 show a remarkable dependence on the electronic state of Co+ cation adducts [27] . The activation of CH and CC bonds and H2/CH4 elimination favored the Co+ with the exited-state rather than with the ground-state [28] . Co2+ ion-exchanged ZSM-5 zeolite catalyst is capable of C3H8 activation; however it also reveals fast reaction rates of CC cracking pathways [29] ,[30] . Nearly 80% propylene selectivity could be obtained on a mesoporous CoAl2O4 spinel catalyst in the PDH reaction, whereas the rapid deactivation was observed [31] . The optimal catalytic performance of 21.5% C3H6 yield was achieved on a 5 wt% Co/Al2O3 catalyst [32] . Nonetheless, the unsatisfactory C3H6 selectivity of 83.6% indicated that the co-existence of the diverse Co active sites on the surface of Al2O3 support that caused significant side reactions. This is partly due to the lacking of structure-control on the Co sites. Modified spinel Co3O4 has shown good activity in the oxidative dehydrogenation of light alkanes, however, it can be easily reduced to metallic Co0 species during the anaerobic PDH reaction, causing the CC cracking and formation of significant methane and C2 molecules [33] ,[34] . Therefore, exposure of stabilized and active surface Co sites with a single state still remain as a key challenge for facilitating both catalytic selectivity and stability in Co-catalyzed PDH reaction [35] .
Al2O3 is one of the most commonly used supports in heterogeneous catalysis due to its structural advantages and stability. For instance, the coordinately unsaturated Al3+ sites present on the (100) facets of commercial γ-Al2O3 can serve as anchor sites to anchor atomically dispersed Pt and Ru sites [36] ,[37] . The specific interaction between Ga2O3 and Al2O3 can allow the tetrahedral Ga3+ cations to highly disperse in the spinel-type γ-Ga2O3-Al2O3 solid solution, leading to an enhanced activity and stability in PDH reaction [38] . The γ-Al2O3 nanosheet containing 27% penta-coordinated Al3+ sites has been proved that it could nicely disperse and stabilize bimetallic PtSn nanoclusters because of the strong interactions between metals and support [39] . This PtSn/Al2O3 sheet catalyst displayed an excellent performance at an ultrahigh space velocity in a long-term PDH reaction. In addition to being an appropriate support, the hydroxyl groups-eliminated Al2O3 showed a high activity of coordinately unsaturated Al3+ as the surface active sites in non-oxidative dehydrogenation of isobutane to isobutylene [40] . Furthermore, the diversity and complexity on the structure of Al2O3, for example the surface acidity at the low-coordinated Al sites, determined the different properties in the adsorption and the activation of propane as well as coke deposition in the PDH reaction. It is therefore desirable to tailor the structure of Co2+ and Al2O3 composites for improving the catalytic performance in the PDH reaction.
Herein, a one-step hydrothermal method is employed to synthesize sheet-shaped CoAl2O3HT catalysts for efficiently catalyzing the PDH reaction. The structural and catalytic stabilities as well as the CoAl2O3 interaction for these catalysts are benchmarked to an impregnated Co/Al2O3-IMP catalyst. We further illustrate the effect of C3H6 desorption behavior in the Co-catalyzed PDH reaction.
2. Experimental
2.1. Catalyst preparation
The γ-Al2O3 sheets were synthesized according to a previously reported hydrothermal procedure with minor modifications. The formation of the shaped boehmite (γ-AlO(OH)) precursor with the aid of urea is regard as the key to control the sheet-like morphology of the resultant catalysts [41] . 6.44 g of Al(NO3)3·9H2O and 9.4 g of urea (CO(NH2)2) were dissolved in 190 mL of deionized water to form a homogeneous solution under vigorous stirring for 15 min. The solution with a pH of approximately 4 was transferred into a Teflon-lined stainless autoclave and then maintained at 100 C for 48 h. After natural cooling, the white precipitate was filtered and then washed with deionized water and anhydrous alcohol several times. The powder was dried at 100 C overnight and calcined in air at 600 C for 2 h with a heating rate of 1 C/min to obtain the γ-Al2O3 sheets.
All CoAl2O3HT catalysts were prepared using the same hydrothermal procedure except of the addition of Co precursor salt. Urea was used as the precipitating agent and the certain molar ratio of Co and Al was adjusted by changing the dosages of Co(NO3)2·6H2O and Al(NO3)3·9H2O. Typically, the molar ratio of urea to total metals (Co+Al) was approximately 9:1. The synthesis of 5 wt% Co/Al2O3-IMP catalyst as the reference catalyst was followed the incipient wetness impregnation method. The diluted Co(NO3)2 solution was incipient impregnated into the γ-Al2O3 sheet support. The sample was maintained at room temperature for 2 h and then dried at 70 C overnight. All the Co catalysts were finally obtained by the calcination in air at 600 C for 4 h with a heating rate of 2 C/min.
2.2. Catalyst characterization
Ultravioletvisible diffuse reflectance (UVVisDR) spectra were recorded from 250 to 900 nm on a Lambda 950 spectrometer (PerkinElmer) equipped with a 150 mm integrating sphere. X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were collected between 10 and 80 in 2θ value on a Bruker AXS D8 Focus diffractrometer with Cu Kα radiation (λ = 0.154 nm) at 40 kV and 40 mA. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analyses were performed on a JEOL JEM 3010 instrument operated at 300 kV. Scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) and energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) elemental mapping were carried out on an FEI Tecnai G2 F20 S-TWIN system operated at 200 kV. The metal ratios of Co/Al in all catalysts were quantified using inductively coupled plasma-optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES, Avio 200, PerkinElmer). Thermo gravimetric analysis (TGA) was conducted on a TGA 2 (Mettler Toledo) with a raising rate of 10 C/min in air for coke measurement.
X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) spectra were obtained on an Escalab250Xi electron spectrometer (Thermo Scientific) with monochromatic 150 W Al Kα radiation, and the binding energy was referenced to the C 1s peak at 284.6 eV. The peak fitting is on the basis of the constraints as follow: the two doublet peaks and the two satellite peaks have the equal peak width, respectively. The Co 2p3/2 level peak with a binding energy (BE) of 780.9781.7 eV and the Co 2p1/2 level peak with a BE of 795706 eV are the characteristic of the octahedral Co3+ species of Co3O4. The Co 2p3/2 level peak with a BE of 779.5780.3 eV and the Co 2p1/2 level peak with a BE of 795706 eV are attributed to the tetrahedral Co2+ species. 27Al magic angle spinning nuclear magnetic resonance (MAS NMR) spectra were recorded on Bruker Avance III 400 equipped with 89 mm wide-bore 9.4 T superconducting magnets in 4 mm rotors at Larmor frequencies of 104.3 MHz. Single pulse 27Al MAS NMR spectrum was acquired at a spinning speed of 14 kHz and 1.0 s recycle delay. 27Al chemical shifts were referenced to 1 M Al(NO3)3 at 0 ppm.
Ex-situ Co K-edge extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) and X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) experiments were performed in transmission mode on the XAFCA beamline of the Singapore Synchrotron Light Source. The collected data was analyzed by by the IFEFFIT software package package follow the standard protocol [42] . EXAFS oscillations χ(k) were extracted from normalized spectrum and then Fourier transformation was performed in Athena to obtain k2-weighted r-space data. The r-space spectra were fitted in Artemis. The fitting window in k space is 311 Å1 while in r-space is 13 Å. The amplitude reduction factor So2 was obtained from the fitting for Co foil, assuming the coordination number of the first shell scattering atoms is 12. Then So2 was constrained as a constant in the following data fitting for the Co K edge spectrum from samples. The coordination number (CN), distance and Debye-Waller factor (σ2) were used as fitting variables.
Temperature programmed analyses were performed on a chemisorption analyzer (AutoChem 2920, Micromeritics) with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD) or a mass spectrometry (MS) detector (QGA, Hiden Analytical Ltd.). For temperature programmed reduction with hydrogen (H2-TPR), 150 mg of sample was pretreated at 400 C for 2 h and cooled down to 100 C under 30 mL/min of Ar stream. The sample was reduced by a 10% H2/Ar mixture gas (30 mL/min) in the temperature range of 100900 C at a heating rate of 10 C/min for the signal recording. For temperature programmed desorption of propylene (C3H6-TPD), 50 mg of catalyst was pretreated in Ar (30 mL/min) at 400 C for 120 min and cooled to 50 C. Subsequent absorption of propylene gas (99.99%, 10 mL/min) was lasted for 30 min and the system was then purged with Ar for 60 min. The catalyst was heated to 900 C at a constant rate of 10 C/min in Ar to collect the signal. 50 mg of sample was used in temperature programmed desorption of ammonia (NH3-TPD) and first pretreated in Ar stream (30 mL/min) at 400 C for 120 min. When the catalyst cooled to 50 C, NH3 was adsorbed for 30 min with 10% NH3/N2 (20 mL/min) and the gas was then switched to Ar to remove the physically absorbed NH3. The signal of NH3-desorption was recorded with heating sample at a rate of 10 C/min in 30 mL/min of Ar.
2.3. Catalytic tests
Catalytic PDH reaction was performed on a fixed-bed reactor under atmospheric pressure. The inner diameter of the quartz tubular reactor is 10 mm. Catalyst (0.15 g) with 3060 mesh was diluted with 0.15 g of quartz sand, loaded in the middle of the reactor. The catalyst was pretreated in N2 from room temperature to 590 C at 15 C/min and kept for 30 min for reaching the steady state and removing the impurities. For the PDH reaction, the molar ratio of C3H8:H2:N2 was 1:0.8:3.2 with the total flow rate of 20 mL/min. The weight hourly space velocity (WHSV) of propane was 2.9 h1. To study the diffusion effect, 0.15 g or 0.30 g of catalyst with 4050 mesh and varied flow rates were used. Based on the calculation result by ChemOffice software, the thermodynamical equilibrium conversion was 51.5% under used reaction conditions. An online gas chromatograph equipped a TCD detector channel with a 3 m TDX-1 column and a flame ionization detector (FID) channel with a KB-Al2O3 capillary column (60 m × 0.32 mm × 10 mm) was used to analyze the products including N2, C3H8, C3H6, C2H4, C2H6, C2H2, CH4, CO and CO2. The conversion of propane, selectivity to propylene, and turnover frequency (TOFCo) were determined from the following equations:where i represents the hydrocarbon products in the effluent gas, ni is the number of carbon atoms of component i, Fi is the corresponding flow rate, t is the reaction time, nin(C3H8) is the total number of C3H8 in the feeding gases, and NCo is the number of total Co atoms in the catalyst. If we convert the coke weights to reacted C3H8 moles, the contribution of coke is less than 0.05% in all cases. Therefore, the effect of coke on the evaluation of catalytic performances is ignored in this work.
For the coke removal and the catalyst regeneration in recycling tests, the reused catalyst was oxidized in 30 mL/min of O2 at 500 C, and then purged in 30 mL/min of N2 or post-reduced in 30 mL/min of H2 at 590 C.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Structures of Al2O3 sheets supported Co catalysts
Two kinds of Co-based catalysts on γ-Al2O3 sheets, CoAl2O3HT and Co/Al2O3-IMP, are prepared by one-step hydrothermal procedure and incipient witness impregnation, respectively. The similar Co loadings with approximately 5 wt% for both catalysts are clarified with ICP-OES results. The structural differences between these two Co catalysts are firstly investigated using detailed characterizations.
The TEM images reveal the sheet-like morphology for these two catalysts. Individual nanoparticles with 5 nm disperse on the Al2O3 sheets for Co/Al2O3-IMP catalyst, as shown in Fig. 1
A. Nonetheless, only nanosheets with <6 nm in thickness but no nanoparticles are found in CoAl2O3HT catalyst (
