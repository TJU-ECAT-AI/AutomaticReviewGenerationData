1.The physicochemical properties of catalysts, including chemical qualities and morphological characteristics, significantly influence their performance in dehydrogenation reactions. The Lewis acid site, arising from the unsaturated AlIII site in the Al2O3 structure, is the active site for the catalytic cycle. The γ-Al2O3-200 catalyst, with a high level of strong acid sites, shows the highest yield in propane dehydrogenation. The amount of Lewis acid sites in Al2O3 is positively linked to the propane conversion rate. The γ-Al2O3-200 catalyst is regenerable, making it a sustainable catalyst for industrial application. Support modification strategies can be employed to optimize these properties for enhanced catalytic efficiency and selectivity.

1.催化剂的物理化学性质，包括化学性质和形态特征，对脱氢反应的性能有重大影响。Al2O3结构中来自未饱和AlIII位点的Lewis酸位点是催化循环的活性位点。γ-Al2O3-200催化剂，具有高水平的强酸位点，在丙烷脱氢中显示出最高的产量。Al2O3中Lewis酸位点的数量与丙烷转化率正相关。γ-Al2O3-200催化剂是可再生的，使其成为工业应用的可持续催化剂。可以通过支持修改策略来优化这些性质，以提高催化效率和选择性。
