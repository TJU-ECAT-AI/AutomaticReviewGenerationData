[1] "The Lewis acid site arising from the unsaturated AlIII site in the Al2O3 structure is the active site for the catalytic cycle."
[2] "γ-Al2O3-200 catalyst shows the highest yield, which delivers an initial conversion of 48% and selectivity of 83%."
[3] "A majority of weak acid sites exist in γ-Al2O3-100 and θ-Al2O3-90, and a high level of strong acid sites is observable in γ-Al2O3-200."
[4] "The formation of Lewis acid sites in Al2O3 is mainly due to the defective AIII site in the structure."
[5] "The propane conversion rate is positively linked to the amount of Lewis acid sites in Al2O3, which also indicates that the Lewis acid sites could be the active sites for propane dehydrogenation."

1.The physicochemical properties of catalysts, including chemical qualities and morphological characteristics, significantly influence their performance in dehydrogenation reactions. The Lewis acid site, arising from the unsaturated AlIII site in the Al2O3 structure, is the active site for the catalytic cycle. The γ-Al2O3-200 catalyst, with a high level of strong acid sites, shows the highest yield in propane dehydrogenation. The formation of Lewis acid sites in Al2O3 is mainly due to the defective AIII site in the structure. The propane conversion rate is positively linked to the amount of Lewis acid sites in Al2O3, indicating that the Lewis acid sites are the active sites for propane dehydrogenation.

1.催化剂的物理化学性质，包括化学品质和形态特征，对脱氢反应的性能有重大影响。Al2O3结构中来自未饱和AIII位点的Lewis酸位点是催化循环的活性位点。γ-Al2O3-200催化剂，具有高水平的强酸位点，在丙烷脱氢中显示出最高的产量。Al2O3中Lewis酸位点的形成主要是由于结构中AIII位点的缺陷。丙烷转化率与Al2O3中Lewis酸位点的数量正相关，表明Lewis酸位点是丙烷脱氢的活性位点。
