1.The physicochemical properties of catalysts, including chemical qualities such as acid strength and stability, play a significant role in dehydrogenation reactions. The Lewis acid site, arising from the unsaturated AlIII site in the Al2O3 structure, is the active site for the catalytic cycle. γ-Al2O3 possesses more Lewis acid sites than θ-Al2O3, which contributes to its higher activity in propane dehydrogenation. The amount of Lewis acid sites in Al2O3 is positively linked to the propane conversion rate, indicating their importance as active sites for propane dehydrogenation. The regenerability of the γ-Al2O3-200 catalyst, which exhibits the highest yield, is reversible, allowing it to be a sustainable catalyst for industrial application. Support modification strategies can be employed to optimize these properties for enhanced catalytic efficiency and selectivity by increasing the number of active sites and improving the stability of the catalyst.

1.催化剂的物理化学性质，包括化学品质如酸强度和稳定性，在脱氢反应中起着重要作用。来自Al2O3结构中未饱和AlIII位点的Lewis酸位点是催化循环的活性位点。γ-Al2O3比θ-Al2O3具有更多的Lewis酸位点，这促使其在丙烷脱氢中具有更高的活性。Al2O3中Lewis酸位点的数量与丙烷转化率正相关，表明它们作为丙烷脱氢活性位点的重要性。γ-Al2O3-200催化剂的可再生性是可逆的，使其成为工业应用中可持续的催化剂。通过增加活性位点的数量和提高催化剂的稳定性，可以采用载体改性策略来优化这些性质，以提高催化效率和选择性。
