[1] "The Lewis acid site arising from the unsaturated AlIII site in the Al2O3 structure is the active site for the catalytic cycle."
[2] "According to the NH3 desorption temperature, a majority of weak acid sites exist in γ-Al2O3-100 and θ-Al2O3-90, and a high level of strong acid sites is observable in γ-Al2O3-200."
[3] "The calculated acid site distribution in these samples is given in Table 1, and γ-Al2O3 possesses more Lewis acid sites than θ-Al2O3."
[4] "The propane conversion rate is positively linked to the amount of Lewis acid sites in Al2O3, which also indicates that the Lewis acid sites could be the active sites for propane dehydrogenation."

1.The physicochemical properties of catalysts, including chemical qualities such as acid strength, play a significant role in dehydrogenation reactions. The Lewis acid site, arising from the unsaturated AlIII site in the Al2O3 structure, is the active site for the catalytic cycle. The amount of Lewis acid sites in Al2O3 is positively linked to the propane conversion rate, indicating their importance in propane dehydrogenation. Morphological characteristics, such as the crystalline structure, also influence catalytic performance. γ-Al2O3 possesses more Lewis acid sites than θ-Al2O3, contributing to its higher activity in propane dehydrogenation. Support modification strategies can be employed to optimize these properties for enhanced catalytic efficiency and selectivity by increasing the number of active sites and improving the stability of the catalyst.

1.催化剂的物理化学性质，包括化学性质如酸强度，在脱氢反应中起着重要作用。来自Al2O3结构中未饱和AlIII位点的Lewis酸位点是催化循环的活性位点。Al2O3中的Lewis酸位点数量与丙烷转化率正相关，表明它们在丙烷脱氢中的重要性。形态特征，如晶体结构，也影响催化性能。γ-Al2O3比θ-Al2O3具有更多的Lewis酸位点，这促成了其在丙烷脱氢中更高的活性。可以通过增加活性位点的数量和提高催化剂的稳定性来优化这些性质，以增强催化效率和选择性。
