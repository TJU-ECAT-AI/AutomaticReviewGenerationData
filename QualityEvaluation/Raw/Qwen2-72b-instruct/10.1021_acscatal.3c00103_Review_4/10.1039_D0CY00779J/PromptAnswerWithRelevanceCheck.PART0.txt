[1] "The Lewis acid site arising from the unsaturated AlIII site in the Al2O3 structure is the active site for the catalytic cycle."
[2] "According to the NH3 desorption temperature, a majority of weak acid sites exist in γ-Al2O3-100 and θ-Al2O3-90, and a high level of strong acid sites is observable in γ-Al2O3-200."
[3] "The calculated acid site distribution in these samples is given in Table 1, and γ-Al2O3 possesses more Lewis acid sites than θ-Al2O3."
[4] "The propane conversion rate is positively linked to the amount of Lewis acid sites in Al2O3, which also indicates that the Lewis acid sites could be the active sites for propane dehydrogenation."
[5] "The γ-Al2O3-200 catalyst which exhibits the highest yield was further studied to determine its regenerability in the propane dehydrogenation reaction."
[6] "The deactivation is reversible in this catalyst. The propane conversion decreases a little bit in the first cycle, in comparison to that in the fresh catalyst. Nevertheless, the propane conversion can be completely restored in the following two cycles."

1.The physicochemical properties of catalysts, including chemical qualities such as acid strength and stability, play a crucial role in their performance in dehydrogenation reactions. The Lewis acid site, arising from the unsaturated AlIII site in the Al2O3 structure, is the active site for the catalytic cycle. The amount of Lewis acid sites in Al2O3 is positively linked to the propane conversion rate, indicating their importance in propane dehydrogenation. Morphological characteristics, such as the crystalline structure, also influence catalytic performance. γ-Al2O3 possesses more Lewis acid sites than θ-Al2O3, which contributes to its higher activity. The regenerability of the γ-Al2O3-200 catalyst, which can be restored after deactivation, is an important property for practical applications. Support modification strategies, such as controlling the crystalline structure and increasing the number of Lewis acid sites, can be employed to optimize these properties for enhanced catalytic efficiency and selectivity.

1.催化剂的物理化学性质，包括化学品质如酸强度和稳定性，在脱氢反应中的性能起着关键作用。来自Al2O3结构中未饱和AlIII位点的Lewis酸位点是催化循环的活性位点。Al2O3中的Lewis酸位点数量与丙烷转化率正相关，表明它们在丙烷脱氢中的重要性。形态特征，如晶体结构，也影响催化性能。γ-Al2O3的Lewis酸位点比θ-Al2O3多，这促成了其更高的活性。γ-Al2O3-200催化剂的可再生性，即可以在失活后恢复，对于实际应用是一个重要的性质。通过控制晶体结构和增加Lewis酸位点的数量，载体改性策略可以被用来优化这些性质，以提高催化效率和选择性。
