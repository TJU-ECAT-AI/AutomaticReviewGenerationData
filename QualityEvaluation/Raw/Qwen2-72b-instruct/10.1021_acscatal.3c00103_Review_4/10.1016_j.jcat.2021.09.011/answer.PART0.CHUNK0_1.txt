[1] "The synthesis procedure employed a diammonium-type bromide surfactant [C18H37N(CH3)2C6H12N(CH3)2C4H9Br2] and a sodium-free silica source."
[2] "The presence of silanol nests in the resultant zeolite was confirmed by IR and NMR spectroscopies."
[3] "When the zeolite was supported with 0.50 wt% Pt and 0.50 wt% Y using nitrate precursors, a remarkably long catalytic lifetime of 20 days was obtained with high propane conversion and propylene selectivity under the reaction condition using neat propane gas at 853 K."
[4] "The Pt3Y alloy nanoparticles exhibited fully reversible hydrogen chemisorption behavior at room temperature, whereas the monometallic Pt nanoparticles showed only partially reversible chemisorption (4050% reversibility) due to the formation of a strong Pt-H bond."
[5] "The PtY(0.5)/MZ-sf-Br and PtY(0.5)/MZ-sf-OH catalysts were even superior to PtY(0.5)/MZ-dg in terms of catalytic durability."
[6] "The PtY(0.5)/MZ-sf-Br catalyst exhibited slow deactivation over 20 d as mentioned above, but PtY(0.5)/MZ-sf-Br-NaCl was deactivated within 1 d, similar to that of Pt(0.5)/MZ-sc."

1.The physicochemical properties of catalysts, including chemical qualities and morphological characteristics, significantly influence their performance in dehydrogenation reactions. The use of a diammonium-type bromide surfactant and a sodium-free silica source in the synthesis procedure leads to the formation of silanol nests in the zeolite, which is confirmed by IR and NMR spectroscopies. These silanol nests are crucial for the formation of intermetallic Pt3Y alloy nanoparticles when supported with Pt and Y on the zeolite. The Pt3Y alloy nanoparticles exhibit high catalytic durability with high propane conversion and propylene selectivity in propane dehydrogenation. The fully reversible hydrogen chemisorption behavior at room temperature of the Pt3Y alloy nanoparticles, compared to the partially reversible chemisorption of monometallic Pt nanoparticles, indicates a significant modification of the electronic state of Pt upon intermetallic compound formation. The PtY(0.5)/MZ-sf-Br and PtY(0.5)/MZ-sf-OH catalysts show superior catalytic durability to PtY(0.5)/MZ-dg, and the PtY(0.5)/MZ-sf-Br catalyst exhibits slow deactivation over 20 days, while PtY(0.5)/MZ-sf-Br-NaCl is deactivated within 1 day. Support modification strategies, such as the use of sodium-free synthesis conditions, can optimize the properties of zeolite-supported alloy catalysts for enhanced catalytic efficiency and selectivity in dehydrogenation reactions.

1.催化剂的物理化学性质，包括化学品质和形态特征，对脱氢反应的性能有重大影响。使用双铵型溴化表面活性剂和无钠硅源的合成程序导致在沸石中形成硅醇巢，这通过红外和核磁共振光谱学得到证实。这些硅醇巢对于在沸石上用Pt和Y支撑时形成Pt3Y金属间化合物纳米颗粒至关重要。Pt3Y合金纳米颗粒在丙烷脱氢中表现出高催化耐久性，丙烷转化率和丙烯选择性高。与单金属Pt纳米颗粒的可逆化学吸附相比，Pt3Y合金纳米颗粒在室温下表现出完全可逆的氢化学吸附行为，这表明在形成金属间化合物时Pt的电子状态发生了重大变化。PtY(0.5)/MZ-sf-Br和PtY(0.5)/MZ-sf-OH催化剂的催化耐久性优于PtY(0.5)/MZ-dg，而PtY(0.5)/MZ-sf-Br催化剂在20天内缓慢失活，而PtY(0.5)/MZ-sf-Br-NaCl在1天内失活。支持修改策略，如使用无钠合成条件，可以优化沸石支撑合金催化剂的性质，以提高脱氢反应的催化效率和选择性。
