[1] "The synthesis procedure employed a diammonium-type bromide surfactant [C18H37N(CH3)2C6H12N(CH3)2C4H9Br2] and a sodium-free silica source."
[2] "The presence of silanol nests in the resultant zeolite was confirmed by IR and NMR spectroscopies."
[3] "When the zeolite was supported with 0.50 wt% Pt and 0.50 wt% Y using nitrate precursors, a remarkably long catalytic lifetime of 20 days was obtained with high propane conversion and propylene selectivity under the reaction condition using neat propane gas at 853 K."
[4] "The mesoporous zeolite-supported Pt3Y catalyst deactivates slowly in propane dehydrogenation, maintaining high propane conversion and propylene selectivity, but the formation of the intermetallic compound requires atomistic migration of yttrium through silanol nests on the zeolite."
[5] "The Pt3Y alloy nanoparticles exhibited fully reversible hydrogen chemisorption behavior at room temperature, whereas the monometallic Pt nanoparticles showed only partially reversible chemisorption (4050% reversibility) due to the formation of a strong Pt-H bond."
[6] "The HAADF-STEM images show that the metal nanoparticles were homogeneously distributed throughout the support material in all cases."
[7] "The size of the metal particles was approximately 2 nm for all four samples."
[8] "The EDS analysis results confirmed that these metal nanoparticles contained both Pt and Y in the same particle."
[9] "The detailed atomic structure of the alloy nanoparticles was investigated by atomic-resolution HAADF-STEM analysis."
[10] "The measured spacing value of 0.403 nm corresponding to the Pt3Y L12 superlattice closely matched the known value of the Pt3Y bulk structure (i.e., 0.400 nm taken from PDF 00017-0058)."
[11] "The PtY(0.5)/MZ-sf-Br and PtY(0.5)/MZ-sf-OH catalysts were even superior to PtY(0.5)/MZ-dg in terms of catalytic durability."
[12] "The conversion-vs-time plot in Fig. 6 a shows that the three PtY(0.5) catalysts supported on silanol nest-containing zeolites have an activation period (12 h) to reach the full conversion."
[13] "The propane conversion was somewhat higher than the equilibrium value (42% at 853 K) during the early reaction period (e.g., < 7 d in PtY(0.5)/MZ-sf-Br)."
[14] "The TGA profile for the spent PtY(0.5)/MZ-sf-Br catalyst showed that 37 wt% of coke species were deposited on the catalyst sample."
[15] "The PtY(0.5)/MZ-sf-Br catalyst exhibited slow deactivation over 20 d as mentioned above, but PtY(0.5)/MZ-sf-Br-NaCl was deactivated within 1 d, similar to that of Pt(0.5)/MZ-sc."
[16] "The results show that there is an inverse relationship between the propane conversion and the metal loading amount when the catalysts were fully activated."
[17] "The conversion-vs-loading relationship appears to originate from increasing metal dispersion (or decreasing particle size) at low loadings."
[18] "The relatively low durability at low catalyst loading appears to be due to the increased fraction of the zeolite support in the catalyst."

1.Sodium-free synthesis conditions were used to create mesoporous MFI zeolites, which resulted in the formation of silanol nests on the zeolite surface. These silanol nests were confirmed by IR and NMR spectroscopies. The presence of silanol nests in the zeolite influenced the physicochemical properties of the catalysts by promoting the formation of intermetallic Pt3Y alloy nanoparticles. These nanoparticles exhibited high catalytic performance in propane dehydrogenation, with a long catalytic lifetime of 20 days, high propane conversion, and propylene selectivity. The formation of the intermetallic compound required atomistic migration of yttrium through silanol nests on the zeolite. The Pt3Y alloy nanoparticles showed fully reversible hydrogen chemisorption behavior at room temperature, unlike monometallic Pt nanoparticles. The nanoparticles were homogeneously distributed throughout the support material, with a size of approximately 2 nm. The EDS analysis confirmed that the metal nanoparticles contained both Pt and Y in the same particle. The detailed atomic structure of the alloy nanoparticles was investigated by atomic-resolution HAADF-STEM analysis. The measured spacing value of 0.403 nm corresponding to the Pt3Y L12 superlattice closely matched the known value of the Pt3Y bulk structure. The PtY(0.5)/MZ-sf-Br and PtY(0.5)/MZ-sf-OH catalysts were superior to PtY(0.5)/MZ-dg in terms of catalytic durability. The catalysts supported on silanol nest-containing zeolites had an activation period to reach full conversion. The propane conversion was higher than the equilibrium value during the early reaction period. The TGA profile for the spent PtY(0.5)/MZ-sf-Br catalyst showed that 37 wt% of coke species were deposited on the catalyst sample. The PtY(0.5)/MZ-sf-Br catalyst exhibited slow deactivation over 20 days, while PtY(0.5)/MZ-sf-Br-NaCl was deactivated within 1 day. There was an inverse relationship between the propane conversion and the metal loading amount when the catalysts were fully activated. The conversion-vs-loading relationship appeared to originate from increasing metal dispersion at low loadings. The relatively low durability at low catalyst loading was due to the increased fraction of the zeolite support in the catalyst.

1.在钠自由合成条件下制备了具有介孔的MFI沸石，这导致在沸石表面形成了硅醇巢。通过红外和核磁共振光谱学确认了这些硅醇巢的存在。沸石中硅醇巢的存在通过促进形成Pt3Y合金纳米粒子影响了催化剂的物理化学性质。这些纳米粒子在丙烷脱氢反应中表现出高催化性能，具有20天的长催化寿命，高丙烷转化率和丙烯选择性。形成金属间化合物需要通过沸石上的硅醇巢进行原子迁移。Pt3Y合金纳米粒子在室温下表现出完全可逆的氢化学吸附行为，与单金属Pt纳米粒子不同。纳米粒子均匀分布在支撑材料中，大小约为2纳米。EDS分析证实，金属纳米粒子在同一个粒子中同时含有Pt和Y。通过原子分辨率HAADF-STEM分析研究了合金纳米粒子的详细原子结构。测量的0.403纳米对应于Pt3Y L12超晶格的间距值与已知的Pt3Y体结构的值紧密匹配。PtY(0.5)/MZ-sf-Br和PtY(0.5)/MZ-sf-OH催化剂在催化耐久性方面优于PtY(0.5)/MZ-dg。在含有硅醇巢的沸石上支撑的催化剂有一个达到完全转化的激活期。在反应的早期阶段，丙烷转化率高于平衡值。用于PtY(0.5)/MZ-sf-Br催化剂的TGA曲线显示，37 wt%的焦炭物种沉积在催化剂样品上。PtY(0.5)/MZ-sf-Br催化剂在20天内缓慢失活，而PtY(0.5)/MZ-sf-Br-NaCl在1天内失活。当催化剂完全激活时，丙烷转化率与金属负载量之间存在反比关系。转化率与负载量的关系似乎源于在低负载时金属分散度的增加。在低催化剂负载下，耐久性相对较低，是由于催化剂中沸石支撑的份额增加。
