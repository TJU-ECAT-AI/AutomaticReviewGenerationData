[1] "The synthesis procedure employed a diammonium-type bromide surfactant [C18H37N(CH3)2C6H12N(CH3)2C4H9Br2] and a sodium-free silica source."
[2] "The presence of silanol nests in the resultant zeolite was confirmed by IR and NMR spectroscopies."
[3] "When the zeolite was supported with 0.50 wt% Pt and 0.50 wt% Y using nitrate precursors, a remarkably long catalytic lifetime of 20 days was obtained with high propane conversion and propylene selectivity under the reaction condition using neat propane gas at 853 K."
[4] "The Pt3Y alloy nanoparticles exhibited fully reversible hydrogen chemisorption behavior at room temperature, whereas the monometallic Pt nanoparticles showed only partially reversible chemisorption (4050% reversibility) due to the formation of a strong Pt-H bond."
[5] "The PtY(0.5)/MZ-sf-Br and PtY(0.5)/MZ-sf-OH catalysts were even superior to PtY(0.5)/MZ-dg in terms of catalytic durability."
[6] "The PtY(0.5)/MZ-sf-Br catalyst exhibited slow deactivation over 20 d as mentioned above, but PtY(0.5)/MZ-sf-Br-NaCl was deactivated within 1 d, similar to that of Pt(0.5)/MZ-sc."

1.The physicochemical properties of catalysts, including chemical qualities and morphological characteristics, significantly influence their performance in dehydrogenation reactions. The use of a diammonium-type bromide surfactant and a sodium-free silica source in the synthesis procedure leads to the formation of silanol nests in the zeolite, which are confirmed by IR and NMR spectroscopies. These silanol nests play a critical role in the formation of intermetallic alloy nanoparticles, such as Pt3Y, which exhibit high catalytic durability, high propane conversion, and propylene selectivity in propane dehydrogenation. The alloy nanoparticles show fully reversible hydrogen chemisorption behavior at room temperature, unlike monometallic Pt nanoparticles. Support modification strategies, such as the direct synthesis of mesoporous MFI zeolites under sodium-free conditions, can optimize these properties for enhanced catalytic efficiency and selectivity. The PtY catalysts supported on silanol nest-containing zeolites exhibit superior catalytic durability compared to those supported on zeolites without silanol nests.

1.催化剂的物理化学性质，包括化学品质和形态特征，对脱氢反应的性能有重大影响。使用双铵型溴化表面活性剂和无钠硅源的合成程序导致在沸石中形成硅醇巢，这通过红外和核磁共振光谱学得到证实。这些硅醇巢在形成金属间合金纳米粒子（如Pt3Y）中起着关键作用，这些粒子在丙烷脱氢中表现出高催化耐久性、高丙烷转化率和丙烯选择性。合金纳米粒子在室温下显示出完全可逆的氢化学吸附行为，与单金属Pt纳米粒子不同。通过直接在无钠条件下合成多孔MFI沸石的载体改性策略可以优化这些性质，以提高催化效率和选择性。支持在含硅醇巢的沸石上的PtY催化剂与支持在不含硅醇巢的沸石上的催化剂相比，表现出更优异的催化耐久性。
