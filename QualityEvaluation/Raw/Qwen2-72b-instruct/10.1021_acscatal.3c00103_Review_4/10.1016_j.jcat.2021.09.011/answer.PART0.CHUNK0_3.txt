[1] "The synthesis procedure employed a diammonium-type bromide surfactant [C18H37N(CH3)2C6H12N(CH3)2C4H9Br2] and a sodium-free silica source."
[2] "The presence of silanol nests in the resultant zeolite was confirmed by IR and NMR spectroscopies."
[3] "When the zeolite was supported with 0.50 wt% Pt and 0.50 wt% Y using nitrate precursors, a remarkably long catalytic lifetime of 20 days was obtained with high propane conversion and propylene selectivity under the reaction condition using neat propane gas at 853 K."
[4] "The mesoporous zeolite-supported Pt3Y catalyst deactivates slowly in propane dehydrogenation, maintaining high propane conversion and propylene selectivity, but the formation of the intermetallic compound requires atomistic migration of yttrium through silanol nests on the zeolite."
[5] "The Pt3Y alloy nanoparticles exhibited fully reversible hydrogen chemisorption behavior at room temperature, whereas the monometallic Pt nanoparticles showed only partially reversible chemisorption (4050% reversibility) due to the formation of a strong Pt-H bond."
[6] "The HAADF-STEM images show that the metal nanoparticles were homogeneously distributed throughout the support material in all cases."
[7] "The size of the metal particles was approximately 2 nm for all four samples."
[8] "The EDS analysis results confirmed that these metal nanoparticles contained both Pt and Y in the same particle."
[9] "The average atomic ratio of Pt to Y was determined to be approximately 3 for both PtY(0.5)/MZ-sf-OH and PtY(0.5)/MZ-sf-Br samples, which agrees well with the Pt/Y ratio of Pt3Y intermetallic alloys supported on MZ-dg in a previous study."
[10] "The PtY(0.5)/MZ-sf-Br and PtY(0.5)/MZ-sf-OH catalysts were even superior to PtY(0.5)/MZ-dg in terms of catalytic durability."
[11] "The conversion-vs-time plot in Fig. 6 a shows that the three PtY(0.5) catalysts supported on silanol nest-containing zeolites have an activation period (12 h) to reach the full conversion."
[12] "The propane conversion was somewhat higher than the equilibrium value (42% at 853 K) during the early reaction period (e.g., < 7 d in PtY(0.5)/MZ-sf-Br)."
[13] "The TGA profile for the spent PtY(0.5)/MZ-sf-Br catalyst showed that 37 wt% of coke species were deposited on the catalyst sample."
[14] "The PtY(0.5)/MZ-sf-Br catalyst exhibited slow deactivation over 20 d as mentioned above, but PtY(0.5)/MZ-sf-Br-NaCl was deactivated within 1 d, similar to that of Pt(0.5)/MZ-sc."

1.The physicochemical properties of catalysts, including chemical qualities and morphological characteristics, play a crucial role in dehydrogenation reactions. The use of a diammonium-type bromide surfactant and a sodium-free silica source in the synthesis procedure leads to the formation of silanol nests in the resultant zeolite, which is confirmed by IR and NMR spectroscopies. These silanol nests facilitate the formation of intermetallic Pt3Y alloy nanoparticles when the zeolite is supported with 0.50 wt% Pt and 0.50 wt% Y, resulting in a remarkably long catalytic lifetime of 20 days with high propane conversion and propylene selectivity. The formation of the intermetallic compound requires atomistic migration of yttrium through silanol nests on the zeolite. The Pt3Y alloy nanoparticles exhibit fully reversible hydrogen chemisorption behavior at room temperature, while the monometallic Pt nanoparticles show only partially reversible chemisorption. The metal nanoparticles are homogeneously distributed throughout the support material, with a size of approximately 2 nm. The EDS analysis confirms that these metal nanoparticles contain both Pt and Y in the same particle, with an average atomic ratio of Pt to Y of approximately 3. The PtY(0.5)/MZ-sf-Br and PtY(0.5)/MZ-sf-OH catalysts show superior catalytic durability compared to PtY(0.5)/MZ-dg. The catalysts supported on silanol nest-containing zeolites have an activation period to reach full conversion. The propane conversion is higher than the equilibrium value during the early reaction period. The TGA profile for the spent PtY(0.5)/MZ-sf-Br catalyst shows that 37 wt% of coke species are deposited on the catalyst sample. The PtY(0.5)/MZ-sf-Br catalyst exhibits slow deactivation over 20 days, while PtY(0.5)/MZ-sf-Br-NaCl is deactivated within 1 day, similar to Pt(0.5)/MZ-sc. Support modification strategies, such as the use of a diammonium-type bromide surfactant and a sodium-free silica source, can optimize the properties of zeolite supports for enhanced catalytic efficiency and selectivity in dehydrogenation reactions.

1.催化剂的物理化学性质，包括化学品质和形态特征，在脱氢反应中起着关键作用。使用双铵型溴化表面活性剂和无钠硅源的合成程序导致在最终的沸石中形成硅醇巢，这通过红外和核磁共振光谱学得到证实。当沸石被0.50 wt% Pt和0.50 wt% Y支撑时，这些硅醇巢促进了Pt3Y合金纳米颗粒的形成，导致长达20天的显著长催化寿命，具有高丙烷转化率和丙烯选择性。形成合金化合物需要钇原子通过沸石上的硅醇巢迁移。Pt3Y合金纳米颗粒在室温下表现出完全可逆的氢化学吸附行为，而单金属Pt纳米颗粒仅表现出部分可逆的化学吸附。金属纳米颗粒均匀分布在支撑材料中，大小约为2纳米。能量色散X射线光谱分析证实，这些金属纳米颗粒在同一颗粒中同时含有Pt和Y，Pt与Y的平均原子比约为3。PtY(0.5)/MZ-sf-Br和PtY(0.5)/MZ-sf-OH催化剂的催化耐久性优于PtY(0.5)/MZ-dg。在含有硅醇巢的沸石上支撑的催化剂有一个达到完全转化的激活期。在反应的早期阶段，丙烷转化率高于平衡值。PtY(0.5)/MZ-sf-Br催化剂的热重分析谱显示，37 wt%的焦炭物种沉积在催化剂样品上。PtY(0.5)/MZ-sf-Br催化剂在20天内缓慢失活，而PtY(0.5)/MZ-sf-Br-NaCl在1天内失活，类似于Pt(0.5)/MZ-sc。通过使用双铵型溴化表面活性剂和无钠硅源的支撑修改策略，可以优化沸石支撑的性质，以提高脱氢反应的催化效率和选择性。
