[1] "The synthesis procedure employed a diammonium-type bromide surfactant [C18H37N(CH3)2C6H12N(CH3)2C4H9Br2] and a sodium-free silica source."
[2] "The presence of silanol nests in the resultant zeolite was confirmed by IR and NMR spectroscopies."
[3] "When the zeolite was supported with 0.50 wt% Pt and 0.50 wt% Y using nitrate precursors, a remarkably long catalytic lifetime of 20 days was obtained with high propane conversion and propylene selectivity under the reaction condition using neat propane gas at 853 K."
[4] "The Pt3Y alloy nanoparticles exhibited fully reversible hydrogen chemisorption behavior at room temperature, whereas the monometallic Pt nanoparticles showed only partially reversible chemisorption (4050% reversibility) due to the formation of a strong Pt-H bond."
[5] "The PtY(0.5)/MZ-sf-Br and PtY(0.5)/MZ-sf-OH catalysts were even superior to PtY(0.5)/MZ-dg in terms of catalytic durability."
[6] "The PtY(0.5)/MZ-sf-Br catalyst exhibited slow deactivation over 20 d as mentioned above, but PtY(0.5)/MZ-sf-Br-NaCl was deactivated within 1 d, similar to that of Pt(0.5)/MZ-sc."

1.The physicochemical properties of catalysts, including chemical qualities and morphological characteristics, significantly influence their performance in dehydrogenation reactions. The use of a diammonium-type bromide surfactant and a sodium-free silica source in the synthesis procedure leads to the formation of silanol nests in the zeolite, which is confirmed by IR and NMR spectroscopies. These silanol nests play a critical role in the formation of intermetallic alloy nanoparticles, such as Pt3Y, which exhibit high catalytic durability, high propane conversion, and propylene selectivity in propane dehydrogenation. The alloy nanoparticles show fully reversible hydrogen chemisorption behavior at room temperature, unlike monometallic Pt nanoparticles. Support modification strategies, such as the generation of silanol nests, can optimize the properties of catalysts for enhanced catalytic efficiency and selectivity. Sodium-free synthesis conditions are crucial for the spontaneous generation of silanol nests, which promote the formation of intermetallic compounds and improve the catalytic performance of the supported metal nanoparticles.

1.催化剂的物理化学性质，包括化学品质和形态特征，对脱氢反应的性能有重大影响。在合成过程中使用双铵型溴化表面活性剂和无钠硅源，导致在沸石中形成硅醇巢，这通过红外和核磁共振光谱学得到证实。这些硅醇巢在形成金属间化合物纳米颗粒（如Pt3Y）中起着关键作用，这些颗粒在丙烷脱氢中表现出高催化耐久性、高丙烷转化率和丙烯选择性。合金纳米颗粒在室温下表现出完全可逆的氢化学吸附行为，与单金属Pt纳米颗粒不同。通过生成硅醇巢等载体改性策略，可以优化催化剂的性能，以提高催化效率和选择性。无钠合成条件对于硅醇巢的自发生成至关重要，这促进了金属间化合物的形成，提高了负载金属纳米颗粒的催化性能。
