1.The physicochemical properties of catalysts, including chemical qualities and morphological characteristics, have significant influences on their performance in dehydrogenation reactions. The support acidity should be carefully controlled to prevent the occurrence of undesirable coke and alkane isomerization.

1.催化剂的物理化学性质，包括化学品质和形态特征，对脱氢反应中的催化剂性能有显著影响。应仔细控制载体酸性，以防止在载体上发生不希望的焦炭和烷基异构化。为了增加金属颗粒的分散，优选具有高表面积和均匀孔径分布的载体。如Li，Na和K等碱金属可以帮助毒化强酸位点，避免在Al2O3表面沉积焦炭。在Al2O3中掺入Mg形成稳定的尖晶石相。具有大量五配位Al原子的Al2O3纳米片由于其锚定Pt原子的能力而具有强烈的金属支撑相互作用，这解释了它们的高稳定性。由于Pt和SiO2之间的弱相互作用，可以通过在SiO2载体上直接H2预处理形成具有高合金度的Pt基二元金属，例如PtM金属间合金。CeO2和金属颗粒之间存在强烈的相互作用，其中Pt原子可以以Pt离子的形式被捕获。在使用水蒸气的情况下，由于CeO2在丙烷脱氢下的氧化还原性质，可以消除焦炭沉积。可调的Si/Al比和相对较大的表面积可以阻止大烃分子的形成，从而防止所谓的焦炭沉积并提高催化稳定性。SBA-1561和MCM-41等介孔材料通常用作催化剂载体，以分散活性相，具有更多的活性位点和更少的焦炭沉积。二维（2D）早期过渡金属碳化物，即MXenes，由于其明确定义的结构和可调成分而受到广泛关注。碳材料因其大表面积，化学惰性和在酸性/碱性介质中的稳定性而被广泛用于大量反应。包括碳纳米管和石墨烯在内的新型纳米结构碳材料作为支撑物逐渐发展。每种特定的支撑物都有其自身的特点，可能对催化性能产生独特的影响。它不仅可以改变选择性，通过影响金属颗粒的成分，形态和分布，还可以通过增加机械强度，抗烧结和抗焦炭性来改变反应稳定性。
