[1] "Although numerous metal-based and metal oxide-based catalysts show superior activity and selectivity and have been widely developed, it is still unclear and ambiguous as to which active site structures and dehydrogenation mechanisms are followed in the PDH process from a fundamental perspective."
[2] "In this section, the active sites, dehydrogenation pathways and deactivation mechanisms on Pt-based and representative metal oxide-based catalysts would be clarified."
[3] "The coordination saturated Pt atoms are more selective for propane dehydrogenation, while the coordinatively unsaturated Pt atoms will catalyze the side reactions, such as CC breaking and deep dehydrogenation, resulting in the formation of carbon deposits."
[4] "The adsorption configuration and strength of propylene can be both greatly perturbed by surface structures, coke formation is inherently governed by the surface geometric and electronic structures, and thus the construction of specific reaction ensembles is important."
[5] "Tuning the support's acidity and coke mobility can also inhibit the coke formation."
[6] "The effective strategies for inhibiting coke are summarized as follows."
[7] "Geometric separation: Previous research studies have shown that separating the active metal components could inhibit the structure-sensitive side reactions with improved propylene selectivity."
[8] "Electron richness: A high electron density of Pt particles is beneficial to weaken Pt(CC) bonds, inhibit coke precursors, and suppress deep dehydrogenation and CC cleavage as well, thus promoting desorption of C3H6, leading to a favorable C3H6 selectivity."
[9] "Poisoning acid sites: In addition to the coke on metal particles, the coke on acidic supports can also suppress the diffusion of reactive molecules."
[10] "Cofeeding streams: In addition to the modulation of catalyst structures and the properties of supports, changes in reaction conditions by cofeeding streams, such as H2, and CO2, can also have a positive effect on coke elimination."
[11] "Enhancing oxygen mobility: The oxidation of the adsorbed surface carbonaceous species can help eliminate the coke deposition over supported metals and thus is beneficial to the improvement of catalytic stability."
[12] "Coke transfer: In addition to inhibiting the coke accumulation on a Pt surface, transferring coke precursors from Pt to supports can also prolong the catalyst life."

1.The physicochemical properties of catalysts, including chemical qualities and morphological characteristics, significantly influence their performance in dehydrogenation reactions. For instance, the coordination saturation of Pt atoms affects the selectivity of propane dehydrogenation, while the unsaturated Pt atoms can catalyze side reactions leading to carbon deposits. The adsorption configuration and strength of propylene are greatly influenced by surface structures, which in turn governs coke formation. Modifying the acidity and mobility of the support can also inhibit coke formation. Effective strategies for inhibiting coke include geometric separation, electron richness, poisoning acid sites, cofeeding streams, enhancing oxygen mobility, and coke transfer. Geometric separation can inhibit structure-sensitive side reactions and improve propylene selectivity. Electron richness can weaken Pt bonds, inhibit coke precursors, and promote propylene desorption. Poisoning acid sites can suppress the diffusion of reactive molecules. Cofeeding streams like H2 and CO2 can eliminate coke. Enhancing oxygen mobility can improve catalytic stability. Coke transfer can prolong catalyst life by moving coke precursors from Pt to supports.

1.催化剂的物理化学性质，包括化学品质和形态特征，对脱氢反应的性能有重大影响。例如，Pt原子的配位饱和度影响丙烷脱氢的选择性，而未饱和的Pt原子可以催化导致碳沉积的副反应。丙烯的吸附构型和强度受表面结构的极大影响，这反过来又决定了焦炭的形成。修改载体的酸性和流动性也可以抑制焦炭的形成。抑制焦炭的有效策略包括几何分离、电子丰富性、酸性位点中毒、共喂流、增强氧流动性以及焦炭转移。几何分离可以抑制结构敏感的副反应，提高丙烯的选择性。电子丰富性可以削弱Pt键，抑制焦炭前体，促进丙烯的解吸。酸性位点中毒可以抑制反应分子的扩散。共喂流如H2和CO2可以消除焦炭。增强氧流动性可以提高催化稳定性。焦炭转移可以通过将焦炭前体从Pt转移到载体上，延长催化剂的寿命。
