[1] "Although numerous metal-based and metal oxide-based catalysts show superior activity and selectivity and have been widely developed, it is still unclear and ambiguous as to which active site structures and dehydrogenation mechanisms are followed in the PDH process from a fundamental perspective."
[2] "In this section, the active sites, dehydrogenation pathways and deactivation mechanisms on Pt-based and representative metal oxide-based catalysts would be clarified."
[3] "The coordination saturated Pt atoms are more selective for propane dehydrogenation, while the coordinatively unsaturated Pt atoms will catalyze the side reactions, such as CC breaking and deep dehydrogenation, resulting in the formation of carbon deposits."
[4] "The adsorption configuration and strength of propylene can be both greatly perturbed by surface structures, coke formation is inherently governed by the surface geometric and electronic structures, and thus the construction of specific reaction ensembles is important."
[5] "Tuning the support's acidity and coke mobility can also inhibit the coke formation."
[6] "The main forms of deactivation are shown in Fig. 12a."
[7] "A first-order deactivation model is usually used to evaluate the catalyst stability."
[8] "The aforementioned deactivation phenomena have a crucial influence on the catalytic performance."
[9] "Therefore, for the design of catalytic systems with promoted performance, inhibition of deactivation can serve as an important requirement."
[10] "A number of synthetic strategies for inhibiting the deactivation have been shown, which can be classified in accordance with the modification of supports, metals and treatments."
[11] "In the following sections, we will introduce the deactivation mechanisms and the inhibition strategies."
[12] "In PDH reactions, coking behavior over Pt-based catalysts leads to decreased catalytic activity follows via two mechanisms: poisoning the active sites or limiting access of the reactants to the active sites due to the partial or complete blockage of pores by coke."
[13] "Both deactivation modes can occur simultaneously."
[14] "As shown above, the coordination saturated Pt atoms are more selective for propane dehydrogenation, while the coordinatively unsaturated Pt atoms will catalyze the side reactions, such as CC breaking and deep dehydrogenation, resulting in the formation of carbon deposits."
[15] "It has been reported that compared to flat surfaces (6372 kJ mol1), the energy barrier to form propylene is much lower on step sites (2434 kJ mol1) by DFT calculations."
[16] "Propylidyne intermediates, as precursors for coke formation and hydrogenolysis, can be easily generated, causing propane to adsorb strongly on the former."
[17] "In addition to the coke formation on Pt NPs, the coke types and positions on Pt-supported catalysts have been studied, which are classified into three locations: on Pt metal, on the Ptsupport boundary, and on supports."
[18] "For Pt/Al2O3 and PtSn/Al2O3 catalysts, coked during propane dehydrogenation, have been studied using temperature-programmed oxidation (TPO)."
[19] "TPO profiles on the PtSn catalyst imply that different peaks are consistent with coke on and near the metal, graphitic and disordered coke on the support, respectively."
[20] "The amount of coke that can be attributed to the third peak increases with temperature and propane partial pressure."
[21] "Both facilitating the propylene desorption and increasing the dehydrogenation barrier of propylene result in less coke."
[22] "As the adsorption configuration and strength of propylene can be both greatly perturbed by surface structures, coke formation is inherently governed by the surface geometric and electronic structures, and thus the construction of specific reaction ensembles is important."
[23] "Additionally, tuning the support's acidity and coke mobility can also inhibit the coke formation."
[24] "Geometric separation: Previous research studies have shown that separating the active metal components could inhibit the structure-sensitive side reactions with improved propylene selectivity."
[25] "For example, Gong and coworkers described an investigation of the promotional effect of Cu on the catalytic performance of Pt/Al2O3 catalysts for PDH."
[26] "The interaction between Pt and Cu elevates the energy barrier for CC bond breaking, and facilitates C3H6 desorption as well."
[27] "The optimized loading content of Cu is 0.5 wt%, which increases the C3H6 yield to 36.5% with a C3H6 selectivity of 90.8% and less coke."
[28] "Specifically, owing to the site-isolated Pt, C3H5 as a model precursor of coke formation can only contact with its surface through a single bond instead of more stable three PtC interactions on a 3-fold hollow site over Pt(111), which can significantly inhibit the structure-sensitive deep dehydrogenation side reactions."
[29] "For example, Pt/Cu single-atom alloys (SAAs) break the scaling relationship of Pt3M (M = 3d and 4d transition metals) alloys and eliminate the structure-sensitive deep dehydrogenation to improve the propylene selectivity up to 90%."
[30] "In regard to the significance of isolated active sites (i.e., geometric effects), a similar inference has been implied for PdIn/SiO2 intermetallic alloys in ethane dehydrogenation (EDH)."
[31] "Electron richness: As mentioned above, the empty d orbital of Pt can be occupied by electrons transferred from electron-rich C3H6 which acts as an electron-donor."
[32] "A high electron density of Pt particles is beneficial to weaken Pt(CC) bonds, inhibit coke precursors, and suppress deep dehydrogenation and CC cleavage as well, thus promoting desorption of C3H6, leading to a favorable C3H6 selectivity."
[33] "Since the reactivity of metal nanoparticle surfaces is determined by the electronic states through the valence d-bands, which is a region in the partial density of states (DOS), alloying with diverse promoters have a great impact on the energies and availability of the valence electrons to form chemical bonds with adsorbates, which is a feasible way to modulate the surface electronic structure and hence the reactivity."
[34] "Jeffrey Greeley and coworkers applied an integrated approach using DFT calculations, kinetics, and in situ X-ray spectroscopies."
[35] "The modified energy of the Pt 5d electrons by the amalgamation of Zn into the catalyst surface is directly related to transformation of rate promotion, while the ensemble effects of PtZn ensembles contribute to enhanced C3H6 selectivity."
[36] "In addition to the alloys, the addition of an appropriate amount of reducible metal oxides such as TiO2 improves catalytic stability and C3H6 selectivity, which is attributed to the electron transfer from partially reduced TiOx (x < 2) to Pt atoms."
[37] "Poisoning acid sites: In addition to the coke on metal particles, the coke on acidic supports can also suppress the diffusion of reactive molecules."
[38] "Another approach has been the use of non-acidic supports that lead to fewer cracking and polymerization reactions compared with acidic supports."
[39] "Alumina is a conventional support applied to platinum-based catalysts for dehydrogenation due to its high surface area, outstanding mechanical strength and thermal stability, which is beneficial to disperse platinum clusters on surfaces and thus enhance the stability of the catalyst."
[40] "However, most alumina supports are acidic, which tends to accelerate coke formation; therefore alkaline promoters are used to poison acid sites and curb support acidity, such as Li, Na, and K."
[41] "Zn and Mg with different ratios have also been used to dope the support."
[42] "The samples with a Zn/(Zn+Mg) of 0.05 showed the highest propylene selectivity."
[43] "Another way to modify an Al2O3 support is to introduce metal oxides (such as TiO2, and CeO2) into it."
[44] "Due to the enhanced interaction between Pt and the supports, the activity, stability and anti-coking capability of Pt-based catalysts would be improved to a large extent."
[45] "This kind of modification decreases the acidity of supports, and modulates the dispersion and the electronic properties of Pt."
[46] "Co-feeding streams: In addition to the modulation of catalyst structures and the properties of supports, changes in reaction conditions by cofeeding streams, such as H2, and CO2, can also have a positive effect on coke elimination."
[47] "Increasing hydrogen pressure leads to a lower coverage of deeply dehydrogenated coke precursors on the surface."
[48] "More recent experiments show that an increasing TOF of propylene during propane dehydrogenation is observed with increasing H2/C3H8 inlet ratio."
[49] "Several explanations are suggested: (i) H2 reduces the coverage of coke precursors, (ii) reaction energies and barriers depend on H2 coverage in a beneficial way, (iii) an alternative and energetically favorable reaction pathway exists at increased H2 coverage and (iv) subsurface hydrogen that may have emerged at high H2 coverage has an effect."
[50] "In addition to H2, cofeeding CO2 is an attractive method, where CO2 acts as a soft oxidant, and can reduce the amount of coke formed at elevated temperature on the catalysts via the reverse Boudouard reaction, thereby increasing conversion and maintaining the stability of the catalysts."
[51] "Enhancing oxygen mobility: The oxidation of the adsorbed surface carbonaceous species can help eliminate the coke deposition over supported metals and thus is beneficial to the improvement of catalytic stability."
[52] "As one of the most significant rare earth oxides, ceria has been widely employed."
[53] "When the cubic fluorite structure of CeO2 is modified with Ga3+ cations, both the surface oxygen mobility and lattice oxygen storage capacity are enhanced."
[54] "DFT calculations show that the addition of Ga can greatly improve C3H6 desorption, and inhibit deep dehydrogenation and the subsequent coke formation."
[55] "Coke transfer: In addition to inhibiting the coke accumulation on a Pt surface, transferring coke precursors from Pt to supports can also prolong the catalyst life."
[56] "The interaction between Pt and coke precursors is weakened by Pt atoms with high electron density, leading the coke precursors to migrate from the Pt sites to supports, hence resisting coke deposition and improving the stability of the catalyst to a large extent."
[57] "Consequentially, the coke amount was significantly decreased as the O2-TPO profiles in Fig. 13j show."
[58] "Experimentally, the addition of Sn does not only inhibit CC bond cleavage and improve selectivity towards styrene, but also allow the coke precursors to migrate from the active metals to supports with large surface area."
[59] "A drain off effect is proposed to explain the decrease of the coke coverage on the metallic sites upon addition of Sn."
[60] "But until now, the coke transfer pathway has not been directly demonstrated."
[61] "Sintering mechanism: As discussed above, Pt cluster size has a significant influence on the dehydrogenation pathway."
[62] "However, the Pt nanoparticles usually suffer from sintering at high PDH reaction and regeneration temperatures, which could lead to their permanent deactivation."
[63] "In principle, two aspects cause the sintering of metal particles."
[64] "The Ostwald ripening mechanism has been implied for metal nanoparticle sintering, which occurs between the nanoparticles with cognizable diameters."
[65] "Due to their higher surface energies, smaller particles nearby are sacrificed to enhance the interparticle transport of mobile species, causing the larger particles to grow."
[66] "In addition, the migrationcoalescence process has also been implied to the metal sintering, which involves in the Brownian motion of metal nanoparticles on the catalyst surface, resulting in the formation of larger particles when the small particles are close to each other."
[67] "In PDH reactions, the Ostwald ripening has been demonstrated to be the main sintering mechanism due to the low Tammann temperature of Pt (750 C)."
[68] "To date, many efforts have been directed towards inhibiting the sintering and/or helping re-disperse the aggregated nanoparticles during the dehydrogenation and regeneration processes."
[69] "Strong metalsupport interaction (SMSI) can be generated from chemical reactions at the metaloxide interface, diffusion, and charge redistribution with a metal contacting with a reducible oxide."
[70] "Alumina-supported Pt is one of the major industrial catalysts for light alkane dehydrogenation."
[71] "Compared to Al2O3, CeO2 is unique on account of its ability to trap Pt atoms in an ionic form due to the stronger SMSI."
[72] "The CeO2-supported PtSn clusters are highly stable, even upon extending the reaction temperature to 680 C."
[73] "Moreover, upon oxidation the PtSn clusters easily recover to the atomically dispersed species on CeO2 as shown in the TEM images in Fig. 14b, making PtSn/CeO2 a fully regenerable catalyst without deactivation of reaction performance (Fig. 14c)."
[74] "In addition to the oxide supports, SMSI is also developed on non-oxide carriers in PDH reactions."
[75] "Yue Wu and coworkers reported thermally stable PtTi intermetallic NPs prepared via SMSI between platinum and MXenes."
[76] "The results in this case showed that the catalysts become highly selective and stable for light alkane dehydrogenation."
[77] "Encapsulation with oxides, carbon layers or mesoporous materials: The confinement situation offered by a support can provide a high surface area for dispersing active metals, and exert a spatial constraint on metal clusters avoiding from sintering."
[78] "The package of a Pt core with an oxide shell could effectively prevent the aggregation of Pt nanoparticles at high temperatures, and changing the core particle size and the thickness of the shell is helpful in realizing controllable catalytic performances."
[79] "The coated Pt@SnO2/Al2O3 catalyst exhibited better stability during propane dehydrogenation compared with the conventional PtSn/Al2O3 catalyst, which is due to the peculiar coated structure and the coated configuration being maintained up to 700 C."
[80] "In addition, nanocarbons, such as carbon nanotubes and nanodiamonds, are outstanding catalyst supports for dehydrogenation."
[81] "Compared with Al2O3 supports, a defective graphene nanoshell leads to a strong protective effect in inhibiting the agglomeration of Pt NPs."
[82] "In addition, mesoporous materials have been reported as promising supports for Pt-based catalysts for PDH owing to their confinement effect."
[83] "Gong and coworkers used SBA-15 as a support and revealed that the average size of a SBA-15-supported PtFe@Pt catalyst is 6.9  0.5 nm, and that of SiO2-supported PtFe@Pt is 21.4  1.9 nm, indicating that the mesoporous structure of SBA-15 can confine the nanoparticles inside to prevent them from severe sintering during the reduction operation."
[84] "Fixation in zeolite crystals: Compared to the encapsulation with mesoporous zeolites, a novel strategy for preparing stable metal nanoparticle catalysts is provided by fixing metal species in zeolite crystals (metal@zeolite), where the stiff zeolite framework is beneficial to stabilize the metal nanoparticles."
[85] "Avelino Corma and coworkers found an innovative approach that can generate Pt nanoparticles and single Pt atoms with remarkably high thermal stability, formed within purely siliceous MCM-22 during the growth of a two-dimensional zeolite into three dimensions."
[86] "High temperature oxidationreduction treatments lead to conversion of encapsulated Pt species to small nanoparticles in the estimated size range of 1 to 2 nm."
[87] "A second metal element such as Sn can be incorporated together with Pt following the same synthesis procedure."
[88] "A similar situation occurred again."
[89] "After calcination in air, Pt species in the K-free PtSn@MFI sample agglomerate into nanoparticles, while the Pt species in the KPtSn@MFI sample remain atomically dispersed."
[90] "Consequently, the high catalytic performance of KPtSn@MFI can be maintained for at least three reactionregeneration cycles without obvious deactivation."
[91] "Other deactivation: Regenerating catalysts under oxidizing (or oxychlorination) conditions followed by H2 reduction is supposed to be an effective method to remove the coke and reactivate the catalysts."
[92] "Nevertheless, such continuous generation may not entirely restore catalytic performance, structural transformation and then the eventual loss of activity and selectivity in consecutive cycles."
[93] "Significantly, for spent Al2O3-supported PtSn catalysts, a portion of the Sn, which remains atomically dispersed, is favorable for redispersion of the Pt to form small nanoparticles on the Al2O3 surface."
[94] "However, without Sn, Pt may sinter into larger nanoparticles during oxidative regeneration."
[95] "In addition, the metal leaching and segregation reconstruction can also lead to catalyst deactivation by high PDH temperatures and complex atmospheres."
[96] "Although many efforts have been made, further understanding of the deactivation mechanism and proposals of effective strategies should be achieved."

1.催化剂的物理化学性质，包括化学性质（如酸强度和稳定性）和形态特征，对脱氢反应的性能有重大影响。活性位点结构和脱氢机制仍然不清楚和模糊，这使得难以理解PDH过程的基本方面。配位饱和的Pt原子对丙烷脱氢更有选择性，而配位不饱和的Pt原子将催化副反应，如CC断裂和深度脱氢，导致碳沉积的形成。丙烯的吸附构型和强度可以被表面结构极大地扰动，焦炭的形成本质上受表面几何和电子结构的控制。通过调节载体的酸性和焦炭的流动性也可以抑制焦炭的形成。
2.可以采用载体改性策略来优化催化剂的物理化学性质，以提高催化效率和选择性。主要的失活形式如图12a所示。通常使用一级失活模型来评估催化剂的稳定性。上述失活现象对催化性能有关键影响。因此，为了设计具有增强性能的催化系统，抑制失活可以作为重要要求。已经展示了许多合成策略来抑制失活，这些策略可以根据载体、金属和处理的修改进行分类。
3.几何分离、电子丰富性、酸性位点中毒和共喂流是抑制Pt基催化剂失活的有效策略。几何分离可以抑制结构敏感的副反应，提高丙烯选择性。电子丰富性可以削弱Pt(CC)键，抑制焦炭前体，抑制深度脱氢和CC裂解，从而促进C3H6的解吸，导致有利的C3H6选择性。酸性位点中毒可以毒化酸性位点，抑制载体酸性。共喂流可以减少焦炭前体的覆盖，促进C3H6的解吸。
4.抑制Pt基催化剂失活的策略包括增强氧流动性、焦炭转移、抑制烧结和使用强金属-载体相互作用（SMSI）。增强氧流动性可以帮助消除支撑金属上的焦炭沉积，提高催化稳定性。焦炭转移可以通过将焦炭前体从Pt转移到载体上，延长催化剂的寿命。抑制烧结可以防止Pt纳米颗粒在高PDH反应和再生温度下的永久失活。SMSI可以从金属与可还原氧化物接触时在金属氧化物界面的化学反应、扩散和电荷再分配中产生。
5.用氧化物、碳层或介孔材料封装可以防止Pt纳米颗粒在高温下的聚集，并为分散活性金属提供高表面积。在沸石晶体中固定可以由刚性的沸石框架稳定金属纳米颗粒。抑制Pt基催化剂失活的其他策略包括在氧化条件下再生催化剂，然后用H2还原，使用非酸性载体，以及添加适量的可还原金属氧化物。
