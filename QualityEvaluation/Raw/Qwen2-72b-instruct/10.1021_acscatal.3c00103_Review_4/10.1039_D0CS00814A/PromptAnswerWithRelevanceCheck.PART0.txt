Although numerous metal-based and metal oxide-based catalysts show superior activity and selectivity and have been widely developed, it is still unclear and ambiguous as to which active site structures and dehydrogenation mechanisms are followed in the PDH process from a fundamental perspective.
In this section, the active sites, dehydrogenation pathways and deactivation mechanisms on Pt-based and representative metal oxide-based catalysts would be clarified.
The coordination saturated Pt atoms are more selective for propane dehydrogenation, while the coordinatively unsaturated Pt atoms will catalyze the side reactions, such as CC breaking and deep dehydrogenation, resulting in the formation of carbon deposits.
The adsorption configuration and strength of propylene can be both greatly perturbed by surface structures, coke formation is inherently governed by the surface geometric and electronic structures, and thus the construction of specific reaction ensembles is important.
Tuning the support's acidity and coke mobility can also inhibit the coke formation.
The effective strategies for inhibiting coke are summarized as follows.
Geometric separation: Previous research studies have shown that separating the active metal components could inhibit the structure-sensitive side reactions with improved propylene selectivity.
Electron richness: A high electron density of Pt particles is beneficial to weaken Pt(CC) bonds, inhibit coke precursors, and suppress deep dehydrogenation and CC cleavage as well, thus promoting desorption of C3H6, leading to a favorable C3H6 selectivity.
Poisoning acid sites: In addition to the coke on metal particles, the coke on acidic supports can also suppress the diffusion of reactive molecules.
Cofeeding streams: In addition to the modulation of catalyst structures and the properties of supports, changes in reaction conditions by cofeeding streams, such as H2, and CO2, can also have a positive effect on coke elimination.
Enhancing oxygen mobility: The oxidation of the adsorbed surface carbonaceous species can help eliminate the coke deposition over supported metals and thus is beneficial to the improvement of catalytic stability.
Coke transfer: In addition to inhibiting the coke accumulation on a Pt surface, transferring coke precursors from Pt to supports can also prolong the catalyst life.

In addition to promoters, good supports for dehydrogenation of alkanes have to be thermally stable, especially under harsh dehydrogenation and regeneration conditions. Their textural properties such as specific surface area, acidbase properties, and thermal stability have been demonstrated to have significant influences on the catalytic performance of Pt-based catalysts.
For example, to avert the occurrence of undesirable coke and alkane isomerization on supports, the support acidity should be carefully controlled.
Additionally, to increase the dispersion of metal particles, supports with high surface area and uniform pore size distribution are preferred.
Some alkaline metals, such as Li, Na, and K, can help poison the strong acid sites and avoid the coke deposition on the Al2O3 surface.
Additionally, doping Mg into Al2O3 forms a stable spinel phase.
In addition, the amount of coordinatively unsaturated penta-coordinate Al atoms on the surface of Al2O3 can also have a great impact on the catalytic properties.
An-Hui Lu and coworkers indicated that Al2O3 nanosheets with abundant penta-coordinate Al atoms have a strong metalsupport interaction owing to their capacity for anchoring Pt atoms, which accounts for their high stability.
Due to the weak interaction between Pt and SiO2, Pt-based bimetals with high alloying degrees such as PtM intermetallic alloys can be formed by direct H2 pretreatment on SiO2 supports.
Comparatively, there exist strong interactions between CeO2 and metal particles, where Pt atoms can be trapped in the form of Pt ions.
During the regeneration step, the CeO2 support can help facilitate atomic redispersion of Pt clusters without using corrosive halogens.
Additionally, upon using water vapor, the coke deposition could be eliminated accounting for the redox properties of CeO2 under propane dehydrogenation.
The adjustable Si/Al ratios and relatively large surface areas can hinder the formation of large hydrocarbon molecules, thus preventing the so-called coke deposits and improving the catalytic stability.
Besides, some mesoporous materials, such as SBA-1561 and MCM-41, are often used as the catalyst supports to disperse the active phase with more active sites and less coke deposition.
In addition to oxide supports, some non-oxide-based supports such as carbides and carbon materials are applied.
Two-dimensional (2D) early transition metal carbides, i.e., MXenes, due to their well-defined structures and tunable compositions have attracted much attention.
Additionally, carbon materials have been widely used for plenty of reactions because of their large surface area, chemical inertness and stability in acidic/basic media.
Novel nanostructured carbon materials including carbon nanotubes and graphene as supports have been gradually developed.
Obviously, each specific support has its own characteristic and may exhibit a distinctive effect on the catalytic property.
It can not only change the selectivity by influencing the component, morphology and distribution of metal particles but also alter the reaction stability by increasing mechanical strength, anti-sintering and anti-coking resistance.

1.催化剂的物理化学性质，包括化学性质（如酸强度和稳定性）和形态特征，对脱氢反应中的性能有显著影响。例如，应仔细控制载体的酸性，以避免在载体上发生不希望的焦炭和烷烃异构化。为了增加金属颗粒的分散，优选具有高表面积和均匀孔径分布的载体。如Li、Na和K等碱金属可以帮助毒化强酸位点，避免Al2O3表面的焦炭沉积。在Al2O3中掺入Mg形成稳定的尖晶石相。Al2O3表面的五配位Al原子的数量也会对催化性能产生重大影响。具有大量五配位Al原子的Al2O3纳米片由于其锚定Pt原子的能力而与金属载体有强烈的相互作用，这解释了它们的高稳定性。由于Pt和SiO2之间的弱相互作用，可以通过直接在SiO2载体上进行H2预处理形成具有高合金度的PtM金属间合金等Pt基双金属。相比之下，CeO2和金属颗粒之间存在强烈的相互作用，其中Pt原子可以以Pt离子的形式被捕获。在再生步骤中，CeO2载体可以帮助促进Pt团簇的原子再分散，而无需使用腐蚀性卤素。此外，通过使用水蒸气，焦炭沉积可以被消除，这归因于CeO2在丙烷脱氢下的氧化还原性质。可调的Si/Al比和相对较大的表面积可以阻止大烃分子的形成，从而防止所谓的焦炭沉积，提高催化稳定性。此外，一些介孔材料，如SBA-1561和MCM-41，通常用作催化剂载体，以分散活性相，具有更多的活性位点和更少的焦炭沉积。除了氧化物载体，还应用了一些非氧化物载体，如碳化物和碳材料。二维（2D）早期过渡金属碳化物，即MXenes，由于其明确定义的结构和可调成分而受到广泛关注。此外，由于其大表面积、化学惰性和在酸性/碱性介质中的稳定性，碳材料已被广泛用于大量反应。包括碳纳米管和石墨烯在内的新型纳米结构碳材料作为载体逐渐被开发。显然，每种特定载体都有其自身的特点，可能对催化性能产生独特的影响。它不仅可以改变选择性，影响组分、形态和金属颗粒的分布，还可以通过增加机械强度、抗烧结和抗焦炭性能来改变反应稳定性。

Although numerous metal-based and metal oxide-based catalysts show superior activity and selectivity and have been widely developed, it is still unclear and ambiguous as to which active site structures and dehydrogenation mechanisms are followed in the PDH process from a fundamental perspective.
In this section, the active sites, dehydrogenation pathways and deactivation mechanisms on Pt-based and representative metal oxide-based catalysts would be clarified.
The coordination saturated Pt atoms are more selective for propane dehydrogenation, while the coordinatively unsaturated Pt atoms will catalyze the side reactions, such as CC breaking and deep dehydrogenation, resulting in the formation of carbon deposits.
The adsorption configuration and strength of propylene can be both greatly perturbed by surface structures, coke formation is inherently governed by the surface geometric and electronic structures, and thus the construction of specific reaction ensembles is important.
Tuning the support's acidity and coke mobility can also inhibit the coke formation.
The main forms of deactivation are shown in Fig. 12a.
A first-order deactivation model is usually used to evaluate the catalyst stability.
The aforementioned deactivation phenomena have a crucial influence on the catalytic performance.
Therefore, for the design of catalytic systems with promoted performance, inhibition of deactivation can serve as an important requirement.
A number of synthetic strategies for inhibiting the deactivation have been shown, which can be classified in accordance with the modification of supports, metals and treatments.
In the following sections, we will introduce the deactivation mechanisms and the inhibition strategies.
In PDH reactions, coking behavior over Pt-based catalysts leads to decreased catalytic activity follows via two mechanisms: poisoning the active sites or limiting access of the reactants to the active sites due to the partial or complete blockage of pores by coke.
Both deactivation modes can occur simultaneously.
As shown above, the coordination saturated Pt atoms are more selective for propane dehydrogenation, while the coordinatively unsaturated Pt atoms will catalyze the side reactions, such as CC breaking and deep dehydrogenation, resulting in the formation of carbon deposits.
It has been reported that compared to flat surfaces (6372 kJ mol1), the energy barrier to form propylene is much lower on step sites (2434 kJ mol1) by DFT calculations.
Propylidyne intermediates, as precursors for coke formation and hydrogenolysis, can be easily generated, causing propane to adsorb strongly on the former.
In addition to the coke formation on Pt NPs, the coke types and positions on Pt-supported catalysts have been studied, which are classified into three locations: on Pt metal, on the Ptsupport boundary, and on supports.
For Pt/Al2O3 and PtSn/Al2O3 catalysts, coked during propane dehydrogenation, have been studied using temperature-programmed oxidation (TPO).
TPO profiles on the PtSn catalyst imply that different peaks are consistent with coke on and near the metal, graphitic and disordered coke on the support, respectively.
The amount of coke that can be attributed to the third peak increases with temperature and propane partial pressure.
Both facilitating the propylene desorption and increasing the dehydrogenation barrier of propylene result in less coke.
As the adsorption configuration and strength of propylene can be both greatly perturbed by surface structures, coke formation is inherently governed by the surface geometric and electronic structures, and thus the construction of specific reaction ensembles is important.
Additionally, tuning the support's acidity and coke mobility can also inhibit the coke formation.
Geometric separation: Previous research studies have shown that separating the active metal components could inhibit the structure-sensitive side reactions with improved propylene selectivity.
For example, Gong and coworkers described an investigation of the promotional effect of Cu on the catalytic performance of Pt/Al2O3 catalysts for PDH.
The interaction between Pt and Cu elevates the energy barrier for CC bond breaking, and facilitates C3H6 desorption as well.
The optimized loading content of Cu is 0.5 wt%, which increases the C3H6 yield to 36.5% with a C3H6 selectivity of 90.8% and less coke.
Specifically, owing to the site-isolated Pt, C3H5 as a model precursor of coke formation can only contact with its surface through a single bond instead of more stable three PtC interactions on a 3-fold hollow site over Pt(111), which can significantly inhibit the structure-sensitive deep dehydrogenation side reactions.
For example, Pt/Cu single-atom alloys (SAAs) break the scaling relationship of Pt3M (M = 3d and 4d transition metals) alloys and eliminate the structure-sensitive deep dehydrogenation to improve the propylene selectivity up to 90%.
In regard to the significance of isolated active sites (i.e., geometric effects), a similar inference has been implied for PdIn/SiO2 intermetallic alloys in ethane dehydrogenation (EDH).
Electron richness: As mentioned above, the empty d orbital of Pt can be occupied by electrons transferred from electron-rich C3H6 which acts as an electron-donor.
A high electron density of Pt particles is beneficial to weaken Pt(CC) bonds, inhibit coke precursors, and suppress deep dehydrogenation and CC cleavage as well, thus promoting desorption of C3H6, leading to a favorable C3H6 selectivity.
Since the reactivity of metal nanoparticle surfaces is determined by the electronic states through the valence d-bands, which is a region in the partial density of states (DOS), alloying with diverse promoters have a great impact on the energies and availability of the valence electrons to form chemical bonds with adsorbates, which is a feasible way to modulate the surface electronic structure and hence the reactivity.
Jeffrey Greeley and coworkers applied an integrated approach using DFT calculations, kinetics, and in situ X-ray spectroscopies.
The modified energy of the Pt 5d electrons by the amalgamation of Zn into the catalyst surface is directly related to transformation of rate promotion, while the ensemble effects of PtZn ensembles contribute to enhanced C3H6 selectivity.
In addition to the alloys, the addition of an appropriate amount of reducible metal oxides such as TiO2 improves catalytic stability and C3H6 selectivity, which is attributed to the electron transfer from partially reduced TiOx (x < 2) to Pt atoms.
Poisoning acid sites: In addition to the coke on metal particles, the coke on acidic supports can also suppress the diffusion of reactive molecules.
Another approach has been the use of non-acidic supports that lead to fewer cracking and polymerization reactions compared with acidic supports.
Alumina is a conventional support applied to platinum-based catalysts for dehydrogenation due to its high surface area, outstanding mechanical strength and thermal stability, which is beneficial to disperse platinum clusters on surfaces and thus enhance the stability of the catalyst.
However, most alumina supports are acidic, which tends to accelerate coke formation; therefore alkaline promoters are used to poison acid sites and curb support acidity, such as Li, Na, and K.
Zn and Mg with different ratios have also been used to dope the support.
The samples with a Zn/(Zn+Mg) of 0.05 showed the highest propylene selectivity.
Another way to modify an Al2O3 support is to introduce metal oxides (such as TiO2, and CeO2) into it.
Due to the enhanced interaction between Pt and the supports, the activity, stability and anti-coking capability of Pt-based catalysts would be improved to a large extent.
This kind of modification decreases the acidity of supports, and modulates the dispersion and the electronic properties of Pt.
Co-feeding streams: In addition to the modulation of catalyst structures and the properties of supports, changes in reaction conditions by cofeeding streams, such as H2, and CO2, can also have a positive effect on coke elimination.
Increasing hydrogen pressure leads to a lower coverage of deeply dehydrogenated coke precursors on the surface.
More recent experiments show that an increasing TOF of propylene during propane dehydrogenation is observed with increasing H2/C3H8 inlet ratio.
Several explanations are suggested: (i) H2 reduces the coverage of coke precursors, (ii) reaction energies and barriers depend on H2 coverage in a beneficial way, (iii) an alternative and energetically favorable reaction pathway exists at increased H2 coverage and (iv) subsurface hydrogen that may have emerged at high H2 coverage has an effect.
In addition to H2, cofeeding CO2 is an attractive method, where CO2 acts as a soft oxidant, and can reduce the amount of coke formed at elevated temperature on the catalysts via the reverse Boudouard reaction, thereby increasing conversion and maintaining the stability of the catalysts.
Enhancing oxygen mobility: The oxidation of the adsorbed surface carbonaceous species can help eliminate the coke deposition over supported metals and thus is beneficial to the improvement of catalytic stability.
As one of the most significant rare earth oxides, ceria has been widely employed.
When the cubic fluorite structure of CeO2 is modified with Ga3+ cations, both the surface oxygen mobility and lattice oxygen storage capacity are enhanced.
DFT calculations show that the addition of Ga can greatly improve C3H6 desorption, and inhibit deep dehydrogenation and the subsequent coke formation.
Coke transfer: In addition to inhibiting the coke accumulation on a Pt surface, transferring coke precursors from Pt to supports can also prolong the catalyst life.
The interaction between Pt and coke precursors is weakened by Pt atoms with high electron density, leading the coke precursors to migrate from the Pt sites to supports, hence resisting coke deposition and improving the stability of the catalyst to a large extent.
Consequentially, the coke amount was significantly decreased as the O2-TPO profiles in Fig. 13j show.
Experimentally, the addition of Sn does not only inhibit CC bond cleavage and improve selectivity towards styrene, but also allow the coke precursors to migrate from the active metals to supports with large surface area.
A drain off effect is proposed to explain the decrease of the coke coverage on the metallic sites upon addition of Sn.
But until now, the coke transfer pathway has not been directly demonstrated.
Sintering mechanism: As discussed above, Pt cluster size has a significant influence on the dehydrogenation pathway.
However, the Pt nanoparticles usually suffer from sintering at high PDH reaction and regeneration temperatures, which could lead to their permanent deactivation.
In principle, two aspects cause the sintering of metal particles.
The Ostwald ripening mechanism has been implied for metal nanoparticle sintering, which occurs between the nanoparticles with cognizable diameters.
Due to their higher surface energies, smaller particles nearby are sacrificed to enhance the interparticle transport of mobile species, causing the larger particles to grow.
In addition, the migrationcoalescence process has also been implied to the metal sintering, which involves in the Brownian motion of metal nanoparticles on the catalyst surface, resulting in the formation of larger particles when the small particles are close to each other.
In PDH reactions, the Ostwald ripening has been demonstrated to be the main sintering mechanism due to the low Tammann temperature of Pt (750 C).
To date, many efforts have been directed towards inhibiting the sintering and/or helping re-disperse the aggregated nanoparticles during the dehydrogenation and regeneration processes.
Strong metalsupport interaction (SMSI) can be generated from chemical reactions at the metaloxide interface, diffusion, and charge redistribution with a metal contacting with a reducible oxide.
Alumina-supported Pt is one of the major industrial catalysts for light alkane dehydrogenation.
Compared to Al2O3, CeO2 is unique on account of its ability to trap Pt atoms in an ionic form due to the stronger SMSI.
The CeO2-supported PtSn clusters are highly stable, even upon extending the reaction temperature to 680 C.
Moreover, upon oxidation the PtSn clusters easily recover to the atomically dispersed species on CeO2 as shown in the TEM images in Fig. 14b, making PtSn/CeO2 a fully regenerable catalyst without deactivation of reaction performance (Fig. 14c).
In addition to the oxide supports, SMSI is also developed on non-oxide carriers in PDH reactions.
Yue Wu and coworkers reported thermally stable PtTi intermetallic NPs prepared via SMSI between platinum and MXenes.
The results in this case showed that the catalysts become highly selective and stable for light alkane dehydrogenation.
Encapsulation with oxides, carbon layers or mesoporous materials: The confinement situation offered by a support can provide a high surface area for dispersing active metals, and exert a spatial constraint on metal clusters avoiding from sintering.
The package of a Pt core with an oxide shell could effectively prevent the aggregation of Pt nanoparticles at high temperatures, and changing the core particle size and the thickness of the shell is helpful in realizing controllable catalytic performances.
The coated Pt@SnO2/Al2O3 catalyst exhibited better stability during propane dehydrogenation compared with the conventional PtSn/Al2O3 catalyst, which is due to the peculiar coated structure and the coated configuration being maintained up to 700 C.
In addition, nanocarbons, such as carbon nanotubes and nanodiamonds, are outstanding catalyst supports for dehydrogenation.
Compared with Al2O3 supports, a defective graphene nanoshell leads to a strong protective effect in inhibiting the agglomeration of Pt NPs.
In addition, mesoporous materials have been reported as promising supports for Pt-based catalysts for PDH owing to their confinement effect.
Gong and coworkers used SBA-15 as a support and revealed that the average size of a SBA-15-supported PtFe@Pt catalyst is 6.9  0.5 nm, and that of SiO2-supported PtFe@Pt is 21.4  1.9 nm, indicating that the mesoporous structure of SBA-15 can confine the nanoparticles inside to prevent them from severe sintering during the reduction operation.
Fixation in zeolite crystals: Compared to the encapsulation with mesoporous zeolites, a novel strategy for preparing stable metal nanoparticle catalysts is provided by fixing metal species in zeolite crystals (metal@zeolite), where the stiff zeolite framework is beneficial to stabilize the metal nanoparticles.
Avelino Corma and coworkers found an innovative approach that can generate Pt nanoparticles and single Pt atoms with remarkably high thermal stability, formed within purely siliceous MCM-22 during the growth of a two-dimensional zeolite into three dimensions.
High temperature oxidationreduction treatments lead to conversion of encapsulated Pt species to small nanoparticles in the estimated size range of 1 to 2 nm.
A second metal element such as Sn can be incorporated together with Pt following the same synthesis procedure.
A similar situation occurred again.
After calcination in air, Pt species in the K-free PtSn@MFI sample agglomerate into nanoparticles, while the Pt species in the KPtSn@MFI sample remain atomically dispersed.
Consequently, the high catalytic performance of KPtSn@MFI can be maintained for at least three reactionregeneration cycles without obvious deactivation.
Other deactivation: Regenerating catalysts under oxidizing (or oxychlorination) conditions followed by H2 reduction is supposed to be an effective method to remove the coke and reactivate the catalysts.
Nevertheless, such continuous generation may not entirely restore catalytic performance, structural transformation and then the eventual loss of activity and selectivity in consecutive cycles.
Significantly, for spent Al2O3-supported PtSn catalysts, a portion of the Sn, which remains atomically dispersed, is favorable for redispersion of the Pt to form small nanoparticles on the Al2O3 surface.
However, without Sn, Pt may sinter into larger nanoparticles during oxidative regeneration.
In addition, the metal leaching and segregation reconstruction can also lead to catalyst deactivation by high PDH temperatures and complex atmospheres.
Although many efforts have been made, further understanding of the deactivation mechanism and proposals of effective strategies should be achieved.

1.催化剂的物理化学性质，包括化学性质（如酸强度和稳定性）和形态特征，对脱氢反应的性能有重大影响。活性位点结构和脱氢机制仍然不清楚和模糊，这使得难以理解PDH过程的基本方面。配位饱和的Pt原子对丙烷脱氢更有选择性，而配位不饱和的Pt原子将催化副反应，如CC断裂和深度脱氢，导致碳沉积的形成。丙烯的吸附构型和强度可以被表面结构极大地扰动，焦炭的形成本质上受表面几何和电子结构的控制。通过调节载体的酸性和焦炭的流动性也可以抑制焦炭的形成。
2.可以采用载体改性策略来优化催化剂的物理化学性质，以提高催化效率和选择性。主要的失活形式如图12a所示。通常使用一级失活模型来评估催化剂的稳定性。上述失活现象对催化性能有关键影响。因此，为了设计具有增强性能的催化系统，抑制失活可以作为重要要求。已经展示了许多合成策略来抑制失活，这些策略可以根据载体、金属和处理的修改进行分类。
3.几何分离、电子丰富性、酸性位点中毒和共喂流是抑制Pt基催化剂失活的有效策略。几何分离可以抑制结构敏感的副反应，提高丙烯选择性。电子丰富性可以削弱Pt(CC)键，抑制焦炭前体，抑制深度脱氢和CC裂解，从而促进C3H6的解吸，导致有利的C3H6选择性。酸性位点中毒可以毒化酸性位点，抑制载体酸性。共喂流可以减少焦炭前体的覆盖，促进C3H6的解吸。
4.抑制Pt基催化剂失活的策略包括增强氧流动性、焦炭转移、抑制烧结和使用强金属-载体相互作用（SMSI）。增强氧流动性可以帮助消除支撑金属上的焦炭沉积，提高催化稳定性。焦炭转移可以通过将焦炭前体从Pt转移到载体上，延长催化剂的寿命。抑制烧结可以防止Pt纳米颗粒在高PDH反应和再生温度下的永久失活。SMSI可以从金属与可还原氧化物接触时在金属氧化物界面的化学反应、扩散和电荷再分配中产生。
5.用氧化物、碳层或介孔材料封装可以防止Pt纳米颗粒在高温下的聚集，并为分散活性金属提供高表面积。在沸石晶体中固定可以由刚性的沸石框架稳定金属纳米颗粒。抑制Pt基催化剂失活的其他策略包括在氧化条件下再生催化剂，然后用H2还原，使用非酸性载体，以及添加适量的可还原金属氧化物。

Their textural properties such as specific surface area, acidbase properties, and thermal stability have been demonstrated to have significant influences on the catalytic performance of Pt-based catalysts.
For example, to avert the occurrence of undesirable coke and alkane isomerization on supports, the support acidity should be carefully controlled.
Additionally, to increase the dispersion of metal particles, supports with high surface area and uniform pore size distribution are preferred.
Some alkaline metals, such as Li, Na, and K, can help poison the strong acid sites and avoid the coke deposition on the Al2O3 surface.
Additionally, doping Mg into Al2O3 forms a stable spinel phase.
An-Hui Lu and coworkers indicated that Al2O3 nanosheets with abundant penta-coordinate Al atoms have a strong metalsupport interaction owing to their capacity for anchoring Pt atoms, which accounts for their high stability.
Due to the weak interaction between Pt and SiO2, Pt-based bimetals with high alloying degrees such as PtM intermetallic alloys can be formed by direct H2 pretreatment on SiO2 supports.
Comparatively, there exist strong interactions between CeO2 and metal particles, where Pt atoms can be trapped in the form of Pt ions.
Additionally, upon using water vapor, the coke deposition could be eliminated accounting for the redox properties of CeO2 under propane dehydrogenation.
The adjustable Si/Al ratios and relatively large surface areas can hinder the formation of large hydrocarbon molecules, thus preventing the so-called coke deposits and improving the catalytic stability.
Besides, some mesoporous materials, such as SBA-1561 and MCM-41, are often used as the catalyst supports to disperse the active phase with more active sites and less coke deposition.
Two-dimensional (2D) early transition metal carbides, i.e., MXenes, due to their well-defined structures and tunable compositions have attracted much attention.

Although numerous metal-based and metal oxide-based catalysts show superior activity and selectivity and have been widely developed, it is still unclear and ambiguous as to which active site structures and dehydrogenation mechanisms are followed in the PDH process from a fundamental perspective.
In this section, the active sites, dehydrogenation pathways and deactivation mechanisms on Pt-based and representative metal oxide-based catalysts would be clarified.
The coordination saturated Pt atoms are more selective for propane dehydrogenation, while the coordinatively unsaturated Pt atoms will catalyze the side reactions, such as CC breaking and deep dehydrogenation, resulting in the formation of carbon deposits.
The adsorption configuration and strength of propylene can be both greatly perturbed by surface structures, coke formation is inherently governed by the surface geometric and electronic structures, and thus the construction of specific reaction ensembles is important.
Tuning the support's acidity and coke mobility can also inhibit the coke formation.
The effective strategies for inhibiting coke are summarized as follows.
Geometric separation: Previous research studies have shown that separating the active metal components could inhibit the structure-sensitive side reactions with improved propylene selectivity.
Electron richness: A high electron density of Pt particles is beneficial to weaken Pt(CC) bonds, inhibit coke precursors, and suppress deep dehydrogenation and CC cleavage as well, thus promoting desorption of C3H6, leading to a favorable C3H6 selectivity.
Poisoning acid sites: In addition to the coke on metal particles, the coke on acidic supports can also suppress the diffusion of reactive molecules.
Cofeeding streams: In addition to the modulation of catalyst structures and the properties of supports, changes in reaction conditions by cofeeding streams, such as H2, and CO2, can also have a positive effect on coke elimination.
Enhancing oxygen mobility: The oxidation of the adsorbed surface carbonaceous species can help eliminate the coke deposition over supported metals and thus is beneficial to the improvement of catalytic stability.
Coke transfer: In addition to inhibiting the coke accumulation on a Pt surface, transferring coke precursors from Pt to supports can also prolong the catalyst life.

In addition to metals and metal oxides, the modern green chemical industry has made urgent and strict demands for environmentally and economically friendly catalysts, which has seriously restricted the large scale applications of conventional metal-based catalysts, especially precious metal and toxic metal oxides. Alternative carbon-based materials and carbides and nitrides have been investigated widely.
Transition metal carbides and nitrides are produced by incorporating C and N atoms into the interstitial sites of transition metals and the formation of carbides and nitrides can significantly modify the physical and chemical properties of the parent metals.
The tunable surface functionalities and the relatively large π-conjugation systems provide nanocarbon materials stable catalytic activity in dehydrogenation of alkanes.
The N-coordinated Co(ii) sites were very stable up to 750 K under a H2 atmosphere and active for propane dehydrogenation.
The main forms of deactivation are shown in Fig. 12a.
A first-order deactivation model is usually used to evaluate the catalyst stability:73 kd = (ln[(1  Xfinal)/Xfinal]  ln[(1  Xinitial)/Xinitial])/t (6) where Xinitial represents the conversion measured in the initial period, Xfinal represents the conversion measured in the final period of an experiment, and t is the reaction time (h). kd represents the deactivation rate constant (h1); the higher the kd value is, the faster deactivation and lower stability are realized.
Therefore, for the design of catalytic systems with promoted performance, inhibition of deactivation can serve as an important requirement.
A number of synthetic strategies for inhibiting the deactivation have been shown, which can be classified in accordance with the modification of supports, metals and treatments (Fig. 12b).
In the following sections, we will introduce the deactivation mechanisms and the inhibition strategies.
Coke preferentially covers the surface uncoordinated active sites, which might be the possible reason why the activity tends to decrease more rapidly on smaller nanoparticles.
In addition, the high reaction and regeneration temperatures can also lead to the sintering of Pt NPs, leaching and reconstruction deactivation of PtM alloys.
The aforementioned deactivation phenomena have a crucial influence on the catalytic performance.
Compared with flat surfaces (6372 kJ mol1), the energy barrier to form propylene is much lower on step sites (2434 kJ mol1) by DFT calculations.
Propylidyne intermediates, as precursors for coke formation and hydrogenolysis, can be easily generated, causing propane to adsorb strongly on the former.
The dehydrogenation product of propylene, C3H5*, can be taken as a model precursor for coke deposition.
In addition to the coke formation on Pt NPs, the coke types and positions on Pt-supported catalysts have been studied, which are classified into three locations: on Pt metal, on the Ptsupport boundary, and on supports.
For Pt/Al2O3 and PtSn/Al2O3 catalysts, coked during propane dehydrogenation, have been studied using temperature-programmed oxidation (TPO).
TPO profiles on the PtSn catalyst imply that different peaks are consistent with coke on and near the metal, graphitic and disordered coke on the support, respectively.
The amount of coke that can be attributed to the third peak increases with temperature and propane partial pressure.
Both facilitating the propylene desorption and increasing the dehydrogenation barrier of propylene result in less coke.
As the adsorption configuration and strength of propylene can be both greatly perturbed by surface structures, coke formation is inherently governed by the surface geometric and electronic structures, and thus the construction of specific reaction ensembles is important.
Additionally, tuning the support's acidity and coke mobility can also inhibit the coke formation.
The effective strategies for inhibiting coke are summarized as follows.
Previous research studies have shown that separating the active metal components could inhibit the structure-sensitive side reactions with improved propylene selectivity.
For example, Gong and coworkers described an investigation of the promotional effect of Cu on the catalytic performance of Pt/Al2O3 catalysts for PDH.44
The interaction between Pt and Cu elevates the energy barrier for CC bond breaking, and facilitates C3H6 desorption as well.
The optimized loading content of Cu is 0.5 wt%, which increases the C3H6 yield to 36.5% with a C3H6 selectivity of 90.8% and less coke.
Specifically, owing to the site-isolated Pt, C3H5 as a model precursor of coke formation can only contact with its surface through a single bond instead of more stable three PtC interactions on a 3-fold hollow site over Pt(111), which can significantly inhibit the structure-sensitive deep dehydrogenation side reactions.
For example, Pt/Cu single-atom alloys (SAAs) break the scaling relationship of Pt3M (M = 3d and 4d transition metals) alloys and eliminate the structure-sensitive deep dehydrogenation to improve the propylene selectivity up to 90%.45,135
In regard to the significance of isolated active sites (i.e., geometric effects), a similar inference has been implied for PdIn/SiO2 intermetallic alloys in ethane dehydrogenation (EDH).136
As mentioned above, the empty d orbital of Pt can be occupied by electrons transferred from electron-rich C3H6 which acts as an electron-donor.
A high electron density of Pt particles is beneficial to weaken Pt(CC) bonds, inhibit coke precursors, and suppress deep dehydrogenation and CC cleavage as well, thus promoting desorption of C3H6, leading to a favorable C3H6 selectivity.
Since the reactivity of metal nanoparticle surfaces is determined by the electronic states through the valence d-bands, which is a region in the partial density of states (DOS) (Fig. 13c),42 alloying with diverse promoters have a great impact on the energies and availability of the valence electrons to form chemical bonds with adsorbates, which is a feasible way to modulate the surface electronic structure and hence the reactivity.
Jeffrey Greeley and coworkers applied an integrated approach using DFT calculations, kinetics, and in situ X-ray spectroscopies.
The modified energy of the Pt 5d electrons by the amalgamation of Zn into the catalyst surface is directly related to transformation of rate promotion, while the ensemble effects of PtZn ensembles contribute to enhanced C3H6 selectivity (Fig. 13d).42
In addition to the alloys, the addition of an appropriate amount of reducible metal oxides such as TiO2 improves catalytic stability and C3H6 selectivity, which is attributed to the electron transfer from partially reduced TiOx (x < 2) to Pt atoms.72
In addition to the coke on metal particles, the coke on acidic supports can also suppress the diffusion of reactive molecules.
Another approach has been the use of non-acidic supports that lead to fewer cracking and polymerization reactions compared with acidic supports.
Alumina is a conventional support applied to platinum-based catalysts for dehydrogenation due to its high surface area, outstanding mechanical strength and thermal stability, which is beneficial to disperse platinum clusters on surfaces and thus enhance the stability of the catalyst.
However, most alumina supports are acidic, which tends to accelerate coke formation; therefore alkaline promoters are used to poison acid sites and curb support acidity, such as Li, Na, and K.
Zn and Mg with different ratios have also been used to dope the support (Fig. 13e), where the samples with a Zn/(Zn+Mg) of 0.05 showed the highest propylene selectivity (Fig. 13f),137 because the resulting spinel phase is less acidic and thermally more stable.
Another way to modify an Al2O3 support is to introduce metal oxides (such as TiO2, and CeO2) into it.
Due to the enhanced interaction between Pt and the supports, the activity, stability and anti-coking capability of Pt-based catalysts would be improved to a large extent.
This kind of modification decreases the acidity of supports, and modulates the dispersion and the electronic properties of Pt.
In addition to the modulation of catalyst structures and the properties of supports, changes in reaction conditions by cofeeding streams, such as H2, and CO2, can also have a positive effect on coke elimination.
Increasing hydrogen pressure leads to a lower coverage of deeply dehydrogenated coke precursors on the surface (Fig. 13g).138
More recent experiments show that an increasing TOF of propylene during propane dehydrogenation is observed with increasing H2/C3H8 inlet ratio (Fig. 13h).
Several explanations are suggested: (i) H2 reduces the coverage of coke precursors, (ii) reaction energies and barriers depend on H2 coverage in a beneficial way, (iii) an alternative and energetically favorable reaction pathway exists at increased H2 coverage and (iv) subsurface hydrogen that may have emerged at high H2 coverage has an effect.
In addition to H2, cofeeding CO2 is an attractive method, where CO2 acts as a soft oxidant, and can reduce the amount of coke formed at elevated temperature on the catalysts via the reverse Boudouard reaction, thereby increasing conversion and maintaining the stability of the catalysts.139
The oxidation of the adsorbed surface carbonaceous species can help eliminate the coke deposition over supported metals and thus is beneficial to the improvement of catalytic stability.
As one of the most significant rare earth oxides, ceria has been widely employed.
When the cubic fluorite structure of CeO2 is modified with Ga3+ cations, both the surface oxygen mobility and lattice oxygen storage capacity are enhanced.140
DFT calculations show that the addition of Ga can greatly improve C3H6 desorption, and inhibit deep dehydrogenation and the subsequent coke formation.
In addition to inhibiting the coke accumulation on a Pt surface, transferring coke precursors from Pt to supports can also prolong the catalyst life.
The interaction between Pt and coke precursors is weakened by Pt atoms with high electron density, leading the coke precursors to migrate from the Pt sites to supports, hence resisting coke deposition and improving the stability of the catalyst to a large extent (Fig. 13i).
Consequentially, the coke amount was significantly decreased as the O2-TPO profiles in Fig. 13j show.72
Experimentally, the addition of Sn does not only inhibit CC bond cleavage and improve selectivity towards styrene, but also allow the coke precursors to migrate from the active metals to supports with large surface area.
A drain off effect is proposed to explain the decrease of the coke coverage on the metallic sites upon addition of Sn.
But until now, the coke transfer pathway has not been directly demonstrated.
As discussed above, Pt cluster size has a significant influence on the dehydrogenation pathway.
However, the Pt nanoparticles usually suffer from sintering at high PDH reaction and regeneration temperatures, which could lead to their permanent deactivation.
In principle, two aspects cause the sintering of metal particles.
The Ostwald ripening mechanism has been implied for metal nanoparticle sintering, which occurs between the nanoparticles with cognizable diameters.
Due to their higher surface energies, smaller particles nearby are sacrificed to enhance the interparticle transport of mobile species, causing the larger particles to grow.141
In addition, the migrationcoalescence process has also been implied to the metal sintering, which involves in the Brownian motion of metal nanoparticles on the catalyst surface, resulting in the formation of larger particles when the small particles are close to each other.
In PDH reactions, the Ostwald ripening has been demonstrated to be the main sintering mechanism due to the low Tammann temperature of Pt (750 C).
To date, many efforts have been directed towards inhibiting the sintering and/or helping re-disperse the aggregated nanoparticles during the dehydrogenation and regeneration processes.
Strong metalsupport interaction (SMSI) can be generated from chemical reactions at the metaloxide interface, diffusion, and charge redistribution with a metal contacting with a reducible oxide.
Alumina-supported Pt is one of the major industrial catalysts for light alkane dehydrogenation.
Compared to Al2O3, CeO2 is unique on account of its ability to trap Pt atoms in an ionic form due to the stronger SMSI (Fig. 14a).
The CeO2-supported PtSn clusters are highly stable, even upon extending the reaction temperature to 680 C.
Moreover, upon oxidation the PtSn clusters easily recover to the atomically dispersed species on CeO2 as shown in the TEM images in Fig. 14b, making PtSn/CeO2 a fully regenerable catalyst without deactivation of reaction performance (Fig. 14c).74
In addition to the oxide supports, SMSI is also developed on non-oxide carriers in PDH reactions.
Yue Wu and coworkers reported thermally stable PtTi intermetallic NPs prepared via SMSI between platinum and MXenes.
The results in this case showed that the catalysts become highly selective and stable for light alkane dehydrogenation.55
The confinement situation offered by a support can provide a high surface area for dispersing active metals, and exert a spatial constraint on metal clusters avoiding from sintering.
The package of a Pt core with an oxide shell could effectively prevent the aggregation of Pt nanoparticles at high temperatures, and changing the core particle size and the thickness of the shell is helpful in realizing controllable catalytic performances.
The coated Pt@SnO2/Al2O3 catalyst exhibited better stability during propane dehydrogenation compared with the conventional PtSn/Al2O3 catalyst, which is due to the peculiar coated structure and the coated configuration being maintained up to 700 C.
In addition, nanocarbons, such as carbon nanotubes and nanodiamonds, are outstanding catalyst supports for dehydrogenation (Fig. 14d).
Compared with Al2O3 supports (Fig. 14e), a defective graphene nanoshell leads to a strong protective effect in inhibiting the agglomeration of Pt NPs (Fig. 14f).142
In addition, mesoporous materials have been reported as promising supports for Pt-based catalysts for PDH owing to their confinement effect.
Gong and coworkers used SBA-15 as a support and revealed that the average size of a SBA-15-supported PtFe@Pt catalyst is 6.9  0.5 nm,47 and that of SiO2-supported PtFe@Pt is 21.4  1.9 nm, indicating that the mesoporous structure of SBA-15 can confine the nanoparticles inside to prevent them from severe sintering during the reduction operation.
Compared to the encapsulation with mesoporous zeolites, a novel strategy for preparing stable metal nanoparticle catalysts is provided by fixing metal species in zeolite crystals (metal@zeolite), where the stiff zeolite framework is beneficial to stabilize the metal nanoparticles.
Avelino Corma and coworkers found an innovative approach that can generate Pt nanoparticles and single Pt atoms with remarkably high thermal stability, formed within purely siliceous MCM-22 during the growth of a two-dimensional zeolite into three dimensions.
High temperature oxidationreduction treatments lead to conversion of encapsulated Pt species to small nanoparticles in the estimated size range of 1 to 2 nm.143
A second metal element such as Sn can be incorporated together with Pt following the same synthesis procedure.
A similar situation occurred again.
After calcination in air, Pt species in the K-free PtSn@MFI sample agglomerate into nanoparticles, while the Pt species in the KPtSn@MFI sample remain atomically dispersed (Fig. 14g and h).66,83
As displayed in Fig. 14i, the apparent Pt dispersion decreases with reduction time, especially from 0 to 6 h.
The decrease in exposed surface Pt should be caused by the formation of PtSn interactions in a scenario in which partially reduced Sn species interact with the external surfaces of the Pt clusters.
Consequently, the high catalytic performance of KPtSn@MFI can be maintained for at least three reactionregeneration cycles without obvious deactivation.
Regenerating catalysts under oxidizing (or oxychlorination) conditions followed by H2 reduction is supposed to be an effective method to remove the coke and reactivate the catalysts.
Nevertheless, such continuous generation may not entirely restore catalytic performance, structural transformation and then the eventual loss of activity and selectivity in consecutive cycles.144
Significantly, for spent Al2O3-supported PtSn catalysts, a portion of the Sn, which remains atomically dispersed, is favorable for redispersion of the Pt to form small nanoparticles on the Al2O3 surface.63
However, without Sn, Pt may sinter into larger nanoparticles during oxidative regeneration.
In addition, the metal leaching and segregation reconstruction can also lead to catalyst deactivation by high PDH temperatures and complex atmospheres.
Although many efforts have been made, further understanding of the deactivation mechanism and proposals of effective strategies should be achieved.

Morphological characteristics, such as surface area and pore structure, can influence the accessibility of reactants to the active sites and the diffusion of products. Support modification strategies can be employed to optimize these properties for enhanced catalytic efficiency and selectivity. For example, modifying the acidity of the support can improve the selectivity towards desired products and inhibit side reactions. Introducing metal oxides into the support can enhance the interaction between the active metal and the support, improving the stability and anti-coking capability of the catalyst. Tuning the surface functionalities and π-conjugation systems of nanocarbon materials can provide stable catalytic activity in dehydrogenation of alkanes. Incorporating C and N atoms into the interstitial sites of transition metals to form carbides and nitrides can significantly modify the physical and chemical properties of the parent metals, leading to improved catalytic performance. The N-coordinated Co(ii) sites on carbon materials can be very stable and active for propane dehydrogenation.
2.Catalyst deactivation can occur due to various factors, including coke formation, sintering, and metal leaching. Coke formation can cover the active sites and inhibit the diffusion of reactants and products, leading to decreased activity and selectivity. Sintering can result in the aggregation of metal nanoparticles, reducing the surface area and active sites, and thus decreasing the catalytic performance. Metal leaching can lead to the loss of active components and activity. Strategies to inhibit deactivation include geometric separation, electron richness, poisoning acid sites, cofeeding streams, enhancing oxygen mobility, and coke transfer. Geometric separation involves separating the active metal components to inhibit structure-sensitive side reactions and improve selectivity. Electron richness refers to increasing the electron density of the metal particles to weaken metal-carbon bonds, inhibit coke precursors, and suppress deep dehydrogenation and carbon-carbon cleavage, promoting the desorption of products. Poisoning acid sites involves using non-acidic supports or adding alkaline promoters to reduce the acidity of the support and curb support acidity, which can accelerate coke formation. Cofeeding streams, such as hydrogen or carbon dioxide, can help reduce the coverage of coke precursors and promote the desorption of products. Enhancing oxygen mobility can help eliminate coke deposition over supported metals, improving catalytic stability. Coke transfer involves transferring coke precursors from the metal surface to the support, resisting coke deposition and improving catalyst stability.
3.Modifying the support's acidity and coke mobility can inhibit coke formation. The support's acidity can be modified by using non-acidic supports or adding alkaline promoters to reduce the acidity of the support and curb support acidity, which can accelerate coke formation. Coke mobility can be enhanced by using supports with high surface area and large pore volume, which can facilitate the diffusion of coke precursors away from the active sites. Additionally, tuning the support's electronic properties, such as the d-band center, can also inhibit coke formation. The d-band center of the metal particles can be modulated by alloying with other metals or doping with non-metallic elements, which can weaken the metal-carbon bonds and inhibit coke precursors.
4.Strategies to inhibit sintering include strong metal-support interaction (SMSI), encapsulation, and embedding. SMSI can be generated from chemical reactions at the metal-oxide interface, diffusion, and charge redistribution with a metal contacting with a reducible oxide. This can help stabilize metal nanoparticles during dehydrogenation reactions. Encapsulation involves coating the metal core with an oxide shell, which can prevent the aggregation of metal nanoparticles at high temperatures. Embedding involves fixing metal species in zeolite crystals, where the stiff zeolite framework can stabilize the metal nanoparticles.
5.Strategies to inhibit metal leaching include using supports with high thermal stability and mechanical strength, which can prevent the leaching of metal particles during dehydrogenation reactions. Additionally, using supports with high surface area and large pore volume can help disperse metal particles and reduce the likelihood of metal leaching. Using supports with high metal-support interaction can also help stabilize metal particles and prevent leaching.
6.Strategies to inhibit deactivation caused by regeneration include using supports with high thermal stability and mechanical strength, which can withstand the high temperatures and mechanical stresses during regeneration. Additionally, using supports with high surface area and large pore volume can help disperse metal particles and reduce the likelihood of metal sintering during regeneration. Using supports with high metal-support interaction can also help stabilize metal particles and prevent sintering during regeneration.
7.Strategies to inhibit deactivation caused by structural transformation include using supports with high thermal stability and mechanical strength, which can withstand the high temperatures and mechanical stresses during dehydrogenation reactions. Additionally, using supports with high surface area and large pore volume can help disperse metal particles and reduce the likelihood of metal sintering during dehydrogenation reactions. Using supports with high metal-support interaction can also help stabilize metal particles and prevent sintering during dehydrogenation reactions.

Although numerous metal-based and metal oxide-based catalysts show superior activity and selectivity and have been widely developed, it is still unclear and ambiguous as to which active site structures and dehydrogenation mechanisms are followed in the PDH process from a fundamental perspective.
In this section, the active sites, dehydrogenation pathways and deactivation mechanisms on Pt-based and representative metal oxide-based catalysts would be clarified.
The coordination saturated Pt atoms are more selective for propane dehydrogenation, while the coordinatively unsaturated Pt atoms will catalyze the side reactions, such as CC breaking and deep dehydrogenation, resulting in the formation of carbon deposits.
The adsorption configuration and strength of propylene can be both greatly perturbed by surface structures, coke formation is inherently governed by the surface geometric and electronic structures, and thus the construction of specific reaction ensembles is important.
Tuning the support's acidity and coke mobility can also inhibit the coke formation.
The effective strategies for inhibiting coke are summarized as follows.
Geometric separation: Previous research studies have shown that separating the active metal components could inhibit the structure-sensitive side reactions with improved propylene selectivity.
Electron richness: A high electron density of Pt particles is beneficial to weaken Pt(CC) bonds, inhibit coke precursors, and suppress deep dehydrogenation and CC cleavage as well, thus promoting desorption of C3H6, leading to a favorable C3H6 selectivity.
Poisoning acid sites: In addition to the coke on metal particles, the coke on acidic supports can also suppress the diffusion of reactive molecules.
Cofeeding streams: In addition to the modulation of catalyst structures and the properties of supports, changes in reaction conditions by cofeeding streams, such as H2, and CO2, can also have a positive effect on coke elimination.
Enhancing oxygen mobility: The oxidation of the adsorbed surface carbonaceous species can help eliminate the coke deposition over supported metals and thus is beneficial to the improvement of catalytic stability.
Coke transfer: In addition to inhibiting the coke accumulation on a Pt surface, transferring coke precursors from Pt to supports can also prolong the catalyst life.
