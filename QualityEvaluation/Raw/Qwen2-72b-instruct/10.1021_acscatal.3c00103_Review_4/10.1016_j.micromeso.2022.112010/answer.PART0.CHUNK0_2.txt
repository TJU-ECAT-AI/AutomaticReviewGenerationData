1.The physicochemical properties of catalysts, including chemical qualities and morphological characteristics, significantly influence their performance in dehydrogenation reactions. The addition of excess NaCl contributes to the stability of propane dehydrogenation MFI-zeolite catalysts. NaCl promotes the dispersion of Pt, prevents sintering during calcination, and effectively suppresses zeolite acidity. Washing the catalysts after calcination further increases their activity and stability due to the redispersion of water-soluble chlorinated Pt compounds. High external surface acid site concentrations, specific Na/Pt atomic ratios, calcination temperatures, washing with water, and the order of component introduction all contribute to improved Pt dispersion and catalyst stability.

1.催化剂的物理化学性质，包括化学性质和形态特征，对脱氢反应的性能有重大影响。过量的NaCl有助于丙烷脱氢MFI-沸石催化剂的稳定性。NaCl促进Pt的分散，防止煅烧过程中的烧结，并有效抑制沸石的酸性。煅烧后清洗催化剂会进一步提高其活性和稳定性，因为水溶性氯化Pt化合物的再分散。高外部表面酸位浓度，特定的Na/Pt原子比，煅烧温度，用水清洗，以及组分引入的顺序都对提高Pt的分散性和催化剂的稳定性有贡献。
