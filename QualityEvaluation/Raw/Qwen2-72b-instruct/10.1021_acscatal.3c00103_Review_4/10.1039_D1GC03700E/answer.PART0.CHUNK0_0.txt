[3] "In the case of SC and coal-based MTO, this is unavoidable due to the nature of the feedstock. However, natural gas and propane can be produced from biomass. In these cases, the feedstock is renewable and so these processes are potentially much more sustainable than when using fossil fuels."

1.The physicochemical properties of catalysts, including chemical qualities such as acid strength and stability, and morphological characteristics, play a crucial role in determining their performance in dehydrogenation reactions. The balance of acid and base sites on the catalyst surface is of paramount importance for the dehydrogenation process. Support modification strategies can be employed to optimize these properties for enhanced catalytic efficiency and selectivity. For example, the addition of promoters such as Cu, MnO2, and other elements can improve the dispersion of active metal species and promote the desorption of propene, thereby enhancing selectivity. The preparation strategy can greatly influence the structure of catalysts, and the formation of intermetallic alloys can enhance the dehydrogenation performance. The nature of the support is also an essential parameter to consider, as it can affect the distribution of active species and the degree of polymerization. The metalsupport interactions can influence the resultant catalyst performance, and the bond strength of the VOsupport bond can determine the activity of the catalyst. However, the catalyst may deactivate quickly due to carbon deposition, and strategies to mitigate this issue are necessary for long-term stability.

1.催化剂的物理化学性质，包括化学品质（如酸强度和稳定性）和形态特征，在决定脱氢反应中的催化剂性能方面起着至关重要的作用。催化剂表面酸碱位点的平衡对于脱氢过程至关重要。可以通过支持体改性策略来优化这些性质，以提高催化效率和选择性。例如，添加Cu、MnO2和其他元素等促进剂可以改善活性金属物种的分散，并促进丙烯的解吸，从而提高选择性。制备策略可以极大地影响催化剂的结构，而形成金属间合金可以增强脱氢性能。支持体的性质也是一个需要考虑的关键参数，因为它可以影响活性物种的分布和聚合程度。金属-支持体相互作用可以影响最终催化剂的性能，而VO支持体键的键强度可以决定催化剂的活性。然而，催化剂可能会因碳沉积而迅速失活，需要采取策略来缓解这一问题，以实现长期稳定性。
