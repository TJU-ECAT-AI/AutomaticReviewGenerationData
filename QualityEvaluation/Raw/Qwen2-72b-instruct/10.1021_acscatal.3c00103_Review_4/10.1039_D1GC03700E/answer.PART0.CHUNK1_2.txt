[1] "The cationanion double hydrolysis approach (CADH), used for the synthesis of mesoporous Al2O3 with high surface area and a pure γ-Al2O3 phase, was undertaken with the crystallisation temperature varied between 25120 C.141 It was found that the crystallisation temperature of the support directly influenced the catalytic performance of the VOx/Al2O3 catalysts, which was a consequence of the increase in Lewis acid sites with increasing crystallization temperatures up to 100 C. This in turn affected the distribution of different surface V species."
[2] "The authors concluded that the relative proportions of V3+, V4+ and V5+ species present on the catalyst surface were affected by V loading and at the optimal loading of 12 wt%, a high concentration of isolated V3+ species was detected."
[3] "Gu et al. reported that P modification could greatly influence the structure and activity of VOx/Al2O3 catalysts.142 More specifically, P modification decreased the degree of VOx polymerization, which had positive implications on the catalyst stability, as evidenced by the retention of high activity (ca. 45% propane conversion) after an 8 h DDH reaction in all P-modified catalysts."
[4] "The combined and synergistic effect of the surface acidity modifications, their influence on the active V3+ species, and weakened metalsupport interactions facilitated desorption of propene and inhibited the deep dehydrogenation that leads to coke precursors."
[5] "Subsequent studies on a VOx/Al2O3 catalysts (with 12 wt% V loading) modified with Mg revealed the anti-coking capability and improved catalytic performance evident through propene yields of 1927% over a 6 h DDH reaction.143 It was found that the dispersing action of Mg modification to V2O5 crystallites and an increase in active V3+ species reduced the amount and polymerization of coke deposits."
[6] "The highest STY achieved was 7.8 molC3H6 kg1cat h1 (Table 6, entry 7)."
[7] "The moderate vanadium doping level was conducive to highly dispersed vanadium species in the form of isolated and low-polymerized VOx species."
[8] "Highly dispersed and stable VOx species, and an absence of V2O5 crystallites, were conducive to high catalytic activity and stability."
[9] "The STY was 6.2 molC3H6 kg1cat h1 (Table 6, entry 5), due to the low GHSV so while the catalyst achieved high selectivity at reasonable propane conversion, it was not as intrinsically active as other supported VOx catalysts."
[10] "The most active catalyst, V/Si-beta (having 3 wt% V loading) displayed an initial propene yield of 33.4% and retained activity over multiple dehydrogenationregeneration cycles."
[11] "The STY was 4.4 molC3H6 kg1cat h1 (Table 6, entry 6), which is 56 times less active than the most active VOx catalysts reported to date, suggesting that Si-beta does not facilitate a high concentration of active V sites."
[12] "It was found that VOx/ZrO2 is approximately five times more active than VOx/Al2O3 and pure ZrO2, exhibiting a STY of 9.2 molC3H6 kg1cat h1 (Table 6, entry 2)."
[13] "The authors proposed that the enhanced performance of VOx/ZrO2 results from the facile reduction of VO, VOV and VOZr bonds, thus producing higher proportions of the active V3+ species."
[14] "For the most active catalyst, with 8 wt% V loading, the initial yield of propene increased from 24% at 550 C to 28% at 575 C with a negligible (<1%) increase at 600 C."
[15] "This corresponded to a STY of 24 molC3H6 kg1cat h1 (Table 6, entry 3), which is one of the most active VOx-based catalysts reported."
[16] "The STY of ZrO2 without VOx is actually much higher than in the current work."
[17] "The most active V species has been identified, the relative proportion and stability of this surface V species can be tuned by varying the preparation method."
[18] "The role of the other V species on the DDH reaction remains unclear so further work to elucidate this could yield more active and stable DDH catalysts."
[19] "The range in performance of V-based catalysts varies quite significantly, with the most active catalysts exhibiting STYs that are around 34 time less active than the most active Pt catalysts."

1.支撑物的结晶温度直接影响了VOx/Al2O3催化剂的催化性能，这是由于结晶温度升高至100°C时，Lewis酸位点数量增加的结果。这进而影响了不同的表面V物种的分布。
2.催化剂表面存在的V3+，V4+和V5+物种的相对比例受V负载量的影响，在12 wt%的最优负载量下，检测到了高浓度的孤立V3+物种。
3.P改性可以显著影响VOx/Al2O3催化剂的结构和活性，具体而言，P改性降低了VOx的聚合度，这对催化剂的稳定性有积极影响，如在所有P改性催化剂中，经过8小时的DDH反应后，仍保持了约45%的丙烷转化率。
4.表面酸性改性、对活性V3+物种的影响以及金属-支撑物相互作用的减弱，协同作用促进了丙烯的脱附，抑制了导致焦炭前体的深度脱氢。
5.Mg改性对V2O5晶粒的分散作用和活性V3+物种的增加减少了焦炭沉积的数量和聚合。
6.最高达到的STY为7.8 molC3H6 kg1cat h1。
7.适度的钒掺杂水平有利于形成高度分散的钒物种，以孤立和低聚合的VOx物种的形式存在。
8.高度分散和稳定的VOx物种，以及V2O5晶粒的缺失，有利于高催化活性和稳定性。
9.STY为6.2 molC3H6 kg1cat h1，由于GHSV较低，虽然催化剂在合理的丙烷转化率下实现了高选择性，但其固有活性不如其他支撑VOx催化剂。

11.STY为4.4 molC3H6 kg1cat h1，这比迄今为止报道的最活跃的VOx催化剂低56倍，表明Si-beta并不促进高浓度的活性V位点。
12.VOx/ZrO2的活性大约是VOx/Al2O3和纯ZrO2的五倍，表现出9.2 molC3H6 kg1cat h1的STY。
13.VOx/ZrO2的增强性能归因于VO，VOV和VOZr键的容易还原，从而产生了更高比例的活性V3+物种。
14.对于最活跃的催化剂，具有8 wt% V负载量，初始丙烯产率从550°C的24%增加到575°C的28%，在600°C时几乎没有(<1%)增加。
15.这对应于24 molC3H6 kg1cat h1的STY，这是报道的最活跃的VOx基催化剂之一。
16.没有VOx的ZrO2的STY实际上比当前工作中的要高得多。
17.最活跃的V物种的相对比例和稳定性可以通过改变制备方法来调整。
18.其他V物种在DDH反应中的作用尚不清楚。
