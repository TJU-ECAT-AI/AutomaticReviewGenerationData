[1] "The role of the support was closely examined for propane ODH-CO2 by Xu et al.114 It was found that Ga2O3 supported on TiO2, Al2O3, and ZrO2 exhibited high activity, while SiO2 and MgO resulted in poorer performing catalysts. However, consistent with previous reports it was found that the addition of CO2 to the reaction feed was detrimental when Al2O3 and ZrO2 were used as supports and higher propane conversion was observed when using lower CO2:C3H8 ratios. Despite this, the propene yield was highest over Ga2O3/Al2O3 in ODH-CO2, the equivalent of 1.5 molC3H6 kgcat1 h1 (Table 12, entry 5). The low activity of Ga2O3/MgO and Ga2O3/SiO2 was ascribed to the absence of medium and strong acid sites. In addition to the acidbase properties of the support, the authors considered the interaction between the Ga and the support to be of importance. In the Ga2O3/TiO2 catalyst, a significant proportion of the Ga (45%) was reduced. This catalyst exhibited the highest propane conversion, but with a propene selectivity of 73% it did not result in the highest propene yield."
[2] "In addition to the acid and base sites of the support also affect the performance of the catalyst and can be adjusted with promotors. This strategy has been widely applied in DDH catalysts. The support may also play a more active role in catalysis, by activating propane, CO2 or O2."
[3] "The majority of investigations on ODH-CO2 Cr2O3 catalysts have focused on support modifications, the addition of a promotor has also been shown to be beneficial. Yun et al. demonstrated that the addition of 0.5 wt% Ni to a 10 wt% CrOx/SBA-15 catalyst increased the propane and CO2 conversion, as well as the on-stream stability. After 1 h on-stream, the Ni-promoted catalyst was 50% more active and the conversion and selectivity was almost maintained over 12 h on-stream. In contrast, the less active unpromoted catalyst retained only half of the initial activity over the same time period. Using three-stage H2-TPR experiments (where the catalyst is reduced twice under H2 and then re-oxidised in CO2 before the final H2-TPR program), the authors showed that the addition of Ni facilitated the re-oxidation of Cr during the reaction. This is consistent with previously reported mechanisms of deactivation over Cr-based catalysts, although coking is also often reported to cause deactivation. Interestingly, the promoted catalyst was marginally more prone to coking. This strongly suggests that overreduction of active Cr sites is the key deactivation mechanism over these catalysts. There is a lot of potential to develop promoted Cr catalysts that could enhance the redox activity of the catalyst; precious metals including Pd and Pt are often supported on reducible supports for this purpose.265 Crucially, it was found that above 0.5 wt% Ni, propane reforming was prevalent, which underlines the importance of appropriate loadings of promotors."

1.The physicochemical properties of catalysts, including chemical qualities and morphological characteristics, significantly influence their performance in dehydrogenation reactions. For instance, the support material can greatly affect the activity and selectivity of the catalyst. Ga2O3 supported on TiO2, Al2O3, and ZrO2 showed high activity in propane ODH-CO2, while SiO2 and MgO resulted in poorer performance due to the absence of medium and strong acid sites. The interaction between the active component and the support is also crucial, as demonstrated by the Ga2O3/TiO2 catalyst, where a significant proportion of Ga was reduced, leading to high propane conversion but lower propene selectivity.
2.Support modification strategies can be employed to optimize the physicochemical properties of catalysts for enhanced catalytic efficiency and selectivity. For example, the addition of a promoter can improve the performance of Cr2O3 catalysts in ODH-CO2. Yun et al. found that adding 0.5 wt% Ni to a 10 wt% CrOx/SBA-15 catalyst increased propane and CO2 conversion and on-stream stability. The Ni-promoted catalyst was 50% more active and maintained conversion and selectivity over 12 h on-stream, while the unpromoted catalyst retained only half of its initial activity. The promoter facilitated the re-oxidation of Cr during the reaction, which is crucial for maintaining activity. However, it is essential to control the loading of promoters, as excessive amounts can lead to side reactions like propane reforming.

1.催化剂的物理化学性质，包括化学品质和形态特征，对脱氢反应的性能有重大影响。例如，支撑材料可以极大地影响催化剂的活性和选择性。在丙烷ODH-CO2中，Ga2O3在TiO2、Al2O3和ZrO2上的支撑显示出高活性，而SiO2和MgO导致较差的性能，因为缺乏中等和强酸性位点。活性组分与支撑之间的相互作用也很重要，如Ga2O3/TiO2催化剂所示，其中大量Ga被还原，导致高丙烷转化率，但丙烯选择性较低。
2.可以通过支撑改性策略来优化催化剂的物理化学性质，以提高催化效率和选择性。例如，添加促进剂可以改善Cr2O3催化剂在ODH-CO2中的性能。Yun等人发现，在10 wt% CrOx/SBA-15催化剂中添加0.5 wt% Ni可以提高丙烷和CO2的转化率以及在线稳定性。Ni促进的催化剂活性提高了50%，并在12小时在线时间内保持了转化率和选择性，而未促进的催化剂仅保留了初始活性的一半。促进剂在反应过程中促进了Cr的再氧化，这对维持活性至关重要。然而，控制促进剂的负载量至关重要，因为过量的促进剂会导致副反应，如丙烷重整。
