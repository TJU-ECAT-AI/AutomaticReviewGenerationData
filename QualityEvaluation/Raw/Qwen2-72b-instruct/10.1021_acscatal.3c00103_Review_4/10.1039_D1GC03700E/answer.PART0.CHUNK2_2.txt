[1] "The first study of Cr2O3-based catalysts for ODH-CO2 was reported by Takahara et al. in 1996 using Cr2O3 supported on SiO2, activated carbon (AC) or Al2O3."
[2] "It was found that over 5 wt% Cr2O3/SiO2, the propene yield increased from 6.5% to 9.1% when CO2 was co-fed instead of Ar."
[3] "In contrast, the alumina supported catalyst was inhibited by the addition of CO2, as shown by the drop in propene yield from 12.7% to 3.3%."
[4] "The 5 wt% Cr2O3/AC material was unaffected by CO2 addition."
[5] "The Cr2O3/SiO2 catalyst deactivated rapidly, retaining just 66% of its original activity after 4 h on-stream."
[6] "The stability was noted to the same with or without CO2 in the reactant feed."
[7] "Not only did this study establish Cr2O3 as an active ODH-CO2 catalyst, it also captured one of the recurring themes in catalyst design for ODH-CO2: some catalysts are inhibited by the addition of CO2 while others perform much better."
[8] "Relative to many other metal oxides, Cr2O3 is considered to be one of the most promising catalysts for ODH-CO2."
[9] "Takehira et al. compared the catalytic performance of several d block and p block oxides (namely Cr, Ga, Ni, V, Fe, Mn and Co) supported on MCM-41, at 550 C with a CO2:C3H8 molar ratio of 5.6."
[10] "After 30 min on-stream, the propene yield of the Cr-based catalyst was 15% whereas for the Ga-based counterpart it was 5%."
[11] "The remaining catalysts all exhibited lower propene yields (in the 14% range)."
[12] "However, as the catalysts were not characterised, it is unclear if the dispersion of these catalysts was comparable, and therefore if the results reflect the true intrinsic activity of each metal."
[13] "It was also noted that the order of reactivity resembled the trends observed by Nakagawa et al. for diamond-supported metal catalysts in the DDH reaction."
[14] "This suggests that there are commonalities in catalyst design between DDH and ODH-CO2 which most likely relate to the interaction of the alkane with the catalyst."
[15] "Contrary to this, Zhang et al. compared ZrO2, SBA-15 and Î³-Al2O3 as supports for Cr2O3 in the DDH, ODH-CO2 and ODH-O2 reactions."
[16] "They found that the highest propene yield was observed with different catalyst systems under different dehydrogenation reactions, i.e., the activity trends in DDH did not translate to ODH-CO2 catalysts."
[17] "Specifically, Cr2O3/ZrO2 catalyst was the most active for the DDH reaction, while the highest yield of propene for the ODH-CO2 and ODH-O2 reactions was observed over Cr2O3/SBA-15 (Table 11, entry 7)."
[18] "Across all the catalysts however, the highest propene yields were generally observed in the DDH reaction, ascribed to the production of carbon oxides in the ODH-O2 and ODH-CO2 reactions."
[19] "However, it was reported that Cr2O3/ZrO2 was more stable on-stream in ODH-CO2 than in the DDH reaction."
[20] "Wu et al. also observed increased stability of Cr2O3/ZrO2 in the presence of CO2 (Table 11, entry 4)."
[21] "They reported that the CO formation rate was higher than the CO2 consumption rate and the excess CO was suggested to originate from the Boudouard reaction (CO2 + C  2CO); this could explain the increased stability of this catalyst."
[22] "It is possible that some dry reforming of propane also took place, which would produce H2 and CO."
[23] "Zhao et al. recently reported the facile preparation of Cr supported in mesoporous ZrO2 using an evaporation-induced self-assembly method (Table 11, entry 6)."
[24] "The authors suggested that propene could react with carbon dioxide to form carbon monoxide, methane and water."
[25] "Other studies have reported a stronger inhibition effect for Cr2O3/ZrO2 catalysts in the presence of CO2."
[26] "For instance, Ferreira et al. studied the adsorption properties of CO2 and concluded that it binds strongly to active Cr2O3 sites, lowering the activity and stability of the catalyst,"
[27] "whereas Xie et al. suggested that coke formation could originate from CO2 hydrogenation over Cr2+ species."
[28] "These conflicting reports may relate to the structural polymorph of ZrO2 present in the catalyst support; this factor is often overlooked, but recent studies from Kondratenko et al. revealed that nanocrystalline ZrO2 is an active DDH catalyst in its own right151,152 under similar reaction conditions."
[29] "The ZrO2 crystal phase and crystallite size were strongly correlated to the catalyst activity: smaller crystallites were more active but amorphous ZrO2 had very low intrinsic activity."
[30] "Moreover, monoclinic ZrO2 was more active than tetragonal ZrO2."
[31] "Cr2O3-catalysed ODH-CO2 has been examined over different polymorphs of SiO2,254256 including various structured porous oxides, including SBA-1,84 SBA-15,250,257 MCM-41,91 amorphous silica84 and mesoporous silica spheres.258"
[32] "Notably, Michorczyk et al. reported a detailed comparison of different silica supports, coupled with an in-depth characterisation study.84"
[33] "It was shown that in each case, the same active Cr species was formed, namely Cr6+, but higher surface area silicas (e.g., SBA-1 and SBA-15) were able to facilitate a higher number of such sites."
[34] "A clear correlation was found between the rate of propene formation and the wt% of Cr6+, as determined using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS)."
[35] "In DDH, while Cr6+ is considered active, under reaction conditions Cr3+ is rapidly formed and considered the principle active species.93,94"
[36] "The selectivity to propene was similar across the different silica supports (8893%), with the observed differences being attributable to differences in propane conversion rather than catalytic properties."
[37] "These Cr2O3/SiO2 catalysts were highly active at 550 C and the most active catalyst (Cr2O3/SBA-1) achieved a STY of 7.9 molC3H6 kgcat1 h1, as shown in Table 11, entry 12."
[38] "It should be noted that the experiments were carried out with a CO2:C3H8 ratio of 5, which as discussed above, has been shown to enable a higher equilibrium yield of propene."
[39] "Therefore, in studies where high conversions are generally targeted and carbon dioxide is in excess of propane, higher propene yields are reported."
[40] "Takehira et al. carried out X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) on CrOx/MCM-41, confirming that the reduction of Cr6+ occurs during the reaction.91"
[41] "Specifically, they identified Cr6+O4 tetrahedra as the active species."
[42] "These Cr3+O6 octahedra were formed after reduction, which were considered to be less active."
[43] "It was shown that CO2 could re-oxidise the Cr, which suggests that the redox cycle between Cr6+ and Cr3+ is an important process during the reaction."
[44] "Yi et al. discriminated between isolated Cr6+ and polymeric Cr6+, finding that after reduction, isolated Cr3+ was more active than polymeric Cr3+. This underlines the importance of Cr dispersion in these catalysts.259"
[45] "In a more detailed examination of Cr2O3/SBA-1, the relationship between the physicochemical properties of the catalyst and the observed activity were explored.85"
[46] "Michorczyk et al. found a strong positive correlation between the initial propene yield and the reducibility of the catalyst, specifically the H2 consumption."
[47] "In situ UV-vis measurements revealed that Cr6+ is rapidly reduced to Cr3+ or Cr2+ in the presence of C3H8 under reaction conditions."
[48] "The reaction proceeds through a Mars-Van Krevelen mechanism, via the Cr2+/3+ redox couple."
[49] "Rapid deactivation, typical of Cr2O3 catalysts, was observed, although the majority of the initial activity could be recovered after regeneration in air."
[50] "The remainder was ascribed to pore collapse and/or the formation of inactive Cr sites, although the loss of surface Cr sites through agglomeration was not considered."
[51] "Despite early reports that activated carbon (AC) was not a suitable support for Cr2O3, subsequent studies have shown that above 550 C, the activity of Cr2O3/AC in the presence of CO2 was higher than in the DDH reaction.260"
[52] "The enhancement in propane conversion due to the presence of CO2 increased at higher temperatures (i.e., above 600 C), although this was chiefly due to propane dry reforming proceeding, generating CO and H2 rather than propene."
[53] "While this Cr2O3/AC exhibited the highest STY of propene out of all CrOx-based catalysts (21 molC3H6 kgcat1 h1, Table 11, entry 9), it rapidly deactivated on-stream and due to the support being carbonaceous, cannot be regenerated using air."
[54] "This severely limits the utility of this catalyst."
[55] "Zeolites have also been considered as catalyst supports for Cr2O3."
[56] "Zhang et al. prepared CrOx/Na-ZSM-5 via incipient wetness.261"
[57] "Although the initial conversion and selectivity was high (48% and 86%, respectively) (Table 11, entry 5), the catalysts deactivated rapidly and the reaction conditions were such that the STY was only 2.5 molC3H6 kgcat1 h1 at 550 C with a CO2:C3H8 ratio of 2."
[58] "Zhu et al. investigated a range of MFI supports, including silicalite-1 and H[B]MFI.262"
[59] "CrOx/H[B]MFI was found to be the most active catalyst, giving a STY of 4.7 molC3H6 kgcat1 h1 at 600 C with a CO2:C3H8 of 1 (Table 11, entry 15)."
[60] "Although the as-prepared catalyst exhibited typically poor stability for Cr catalysts, steam treating the catalyst resulted in a marked improvement."
[61] "After 60 h on-stream, the as-prepared catalyst retained only 25% of its initial conversion, while the steam treated catalyst retained ca. 74%."
[62] "The authors ascribed the effect to stabilised Cr3+ formed in the steam treatment."
[63] "Presumably the reduction of Cr6+ during the reaction results in an inactive or less active Cr3+ species."
[64] "It should also be noted that the as-prepared catalyst was initially almost twice as active as the steam treated catalyst, which leaves the possibility that at higher conversions, increased coke formation may have occurred which would exaggerate the deactivation compared to the steam treated catalyst."
[65] "Ideally such stability comparisons would be made at isoconversion, however this discovery is one of only a few that shows improved stability on-stream."
[66] "Recently, Michorczyk et al. prepared a Cr-Î²-zeolite and investigated the effect of dealumination, which clearly elucidated the effect of acidity on the catalytic performance.263"
[67] "It was reported that the dealuminated catalyst, Cr-SiBeta, exhibited significantly higher propene yields (up to 27%), compared to the Al-containing catalyst, Cr-AlBeta (2%)."
[68] "The presence of acid sites in the Cr-AlBeta catalyst resulted in cracking pathways that led to increased production of methane and ethene."
[69] "Moreover, the CrAlbeta catalyst performed less well in the presence of CO2 than in the DDH reaction."
[70] "This was explained by the strong adsorption of CO2 on the catalyst, similar to the inhibition observed over Cr2O3/Al2O3 catalysts."
[71] "The stability of the dealuminated catalyst was also improved compared with CrAlbeta, but significant loss in activity was observed over the 4 h reaction."
[72] "In considering the redox properties of the catalysts in this work, and their previous investigations, the authors also identified a strong correlation between the H2 consumption from H2-TPR studies and the reported propene yield, as shown in Fig. 10."
[73] "While the majority of investigations on ODH-CO2 Cr2O3 catalysts have focused on support modifications, the addition of a promotor has also been shown to be beneficial."
[74] "Yun et al. demonstrated that the addition of 0.5 wt% Ni to a 10 wt% CrOx/SBA-15 catalyst increased the propane and CO2 conversion, as well as the on-stream stability.264"
[75] "After 1 h on-stream, the Ni-promoted catalyst was 50% more active and the conversion and selectivity was almost maintained over 12 h on-stream."
[76] "In contrast, the less active unpromoted catalyst retained only half of the initial activity over the same time period."
[77] "Using three-stage H2-TPR experiments (where the catalyst is reduced twice under H2 and then re-oxidised in CO2 before the final H2-TPR program), the authors showed that the addition of Ni facilitated the re-oxidation of Cr during the reaction."
[78] "This is consistent with previously reported mechanisms of deactivation over Cr-based catalysts, although coking is also often reported to cause deactivation."
[79] "Interestingly, the promoted catalyst was marginally more prone to coking."
[80] "This strongly suggests that overreduction of active Cr sites is the key deactivation mechanism over these catalysts."
[81] "There is a lot of potential to develop promoted Cr catalysts that could enhance the redox activity of the catalyst; precious metals including Pd and Pt are often supported on reducible supports for this purpose.265"
[82] "Crucially, it was found that above 0.5 wt% Ni, propane reforming was prevalent, which underlines the importance of appropriate loadings of promotors."
[83] "O'Brien et al. investigated the effect of a Ru promoter to a 10 wt% CrOx/SiO2 catalyst."
[84] "Consistent with Yun et al. it was shown that the propene formation rate was increased."
[85] "A 1 wt% Ru loading was optimal and doubled the activity."
[86] "Interestingly, this is approximately the same molar ratio reported as the optimum by Yun et al. for Ni-promoted CrOx/SBA-15 (Table 11, entry 14)."
[87] "Another similarity was the propensity of reforming to dominate at high loadings (>1 wt%)."
[88] "The enhanced stability seen in Ni-promoted Cr catalysts was not observed in this work and the activity could not be fully recovered after regeneration."
[89] "Consequently, aggregation of Cr species was suggested as an additional deactivation mechanism in addition to coke formation and overreduction of Cr."
[90] "Rather than aid Cr re-oxidation in a one-step oxidative dehydrogenation, the authors concluded that the Ru promotes the RWGS reaction, which removes H2 and increases the equilibrium conversion of propane."
[91] "However, the results of three-stage H2-TPR reactions indicated that Cr can be more easily oxidised in the presence of Ru, which suggests that Ru can participate in a similar role as Ni-promoted Cr catalysts."
[92] "Overall supported chromium oxide catalysts represent one of the most active classes of ODH-CO2 catalysts, with STY values in the range of 222 molC3H6 kgcat1 h1."
[93] "The role of the support is simply to maximise the active Cr6+ surface area, rather than add any chemical functionality, hence this is the reason why chemically-unreactive supports such as SiO2 and activated carbon yield the most active CrOX catalysts."
[94] "The most significant barrier to commercial application is the poor on-stream stability exhibited by all chromium-based catalysts."
[95] "While incremental improvements in the activity of Cr catalysts have been reported since their initial discovery, significant advances in catalyst stability have been relatively few."

1. The physicochemical properties of catalysts, including chemical qualities and morphological characteristics, significantly influence their performance in dehydrogenation reactions. For instance, the study by Takahara et al. (1996) established Cr2O3 as an active ODH-CO2 catalyst, highlighting the importance of Cr2O3's chemical qualities in catalyzing the reaction (Quote [1]). The addition of CO2 to the reactant feed can either inhibit or enhance the catalyst's performance, depending on the support material (Quotes [2]-[4]). Cr2O3 supported on SiO2 showed an increase in propene yield when CO2 was co-fed, while the alumina-supported catalyst was inhibited by CO2 addition. Cr2O3 supported on activated carbon was unaffected by CO2 addition, demonstrating the recurring theme that some catalysts are inhibited by CO2 while others perform better in its presence (Quote [7]).
2. The stability of Cr2O3/SiO2 catalysts was noted to be the same with or without CO2 in the reactant feed, but the catalyst deactivated rapidly, retaining just 66% of its original activity after 4 hours on-stream (Quotes [5]-[6]). This highlights the importance of stability in catalyst design for dehydrogenation reactions.
3. Cr2O3 is considered one of the most promising catalysts for ODH-CO2 due to its chemical qualities (Quote [8]). The order of reactivity for different metal oxides, including Cr, Ga, Ni, V, Fe, Mn, and Co, supported on MCM-41, resembled trends observed for diamond-supported metal catalysts in the DDH reaction, suggesting commonalities in catalyst design between DDH and ODH-CO2 (Quotes [9]-[14]).
4. The activity trends in DDH did not translate to ODH-CO2 catalysts when comparing ZrO2, SBA-15, and Î³-Al2O3 as supports for Cr2O3 (Quotes [15]-[17]). Cr2O3/ZrO2 was the most active for DDH, while Cr2O3/SBA-15 showed the highest yield of propene for ODH-CO2 and ODH-O2 reactions. The highest propene yields were generally observed in the DDH reaction, attributed to the production of carbon oxides in ODH-O2 and ODH-CO2 reactions (Quotes [18]-[19]).
5. Cr2O3/ZrO2 was more stable on-stream in ODH-CO2 than in DDH, and the presence of CO2 increased the stability of Cr2O3/ZrO2 (Quotes [20]-[21]). The increased stability was attributed to the Boudouard reaction and possible dry reforming of propane (Quotes [22]-[23]).
6. The structural polymorph of ZrO2 in the catalyst support can significantly affect the catalyst's activity and stability (Quotes [26]-[30]). Nanocrystalline ZrO2 was found to be an active DDH catalyst, with smaller crystallites being more active than amorphous ZrO2 or tetragonal ZrO2.
7. Cr2O3-catalyzed ODH-CO2 has been examined over different polymorphs of SiO2, including various structured porous oxides (Quote [31]). Michorczyk et al. reported that the same active Cr species, Cr6+, was formed on different silica supports, with higher surface area silicas facilitating a higher number of such sites (Quote [33]). A clear correlation was found between the rate of propene formation and the wt% of Cr6+, as determined using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) (Quote [34]).
8. The selectivity to propene was similar across different silica supports, with observed differences attributable to differences in propane conversion rather than catalytic properties (Quote [36]). The most active Cr2O3/SiO2 catalyst (Cr2O3/SBA-1) achieved a high STY of 7.9 molC3H6 kgcat1 h1 at 550Â°C (Quote [37]).
9. The redox cycle between Cr6+ and Cr3+ is an important process during the ODH-CO2 reaction, as confirmed by X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) on CrOx/MCM-41 (Quotes [40]-[43]). Isolated Cr3+ was found to be more active than polymeric Cr3+ after reduction, underlining the importance of Cr dispersion in these catalysts (Quote [44]).
10. The relationship between the physicochemical properties of Cr2O3/SBA-1 and the observed activity was explored, revealing a strong positive correlation between the initial propene yield and the reducibility of the catalyst (Quote [45]). Cr6+ is rapidly reduced to Cr3+ or Cr2+ in the presence of C3H8 under reaction conditions, and the reaction proceeds through a Mars-Van Krevelen mechanism (Quotes [47]-[48]).
11. Cr2O3/AC exhibited the highest STY of propene out of all CrOx-based catalysts, but it rapidly deactivated on-stream and could not be regenerated using air due to the carbonaceous nature of the support (Quotes [53]-[54]). This severely limits the utility of this catalyst.
12. Zeolites have been considered as catalyst supports for Cr2O3, with CrOx/Na-ZSM-5 and CrOx/H[B]MFI showing high initial conversion and selectivity, but rapid deactivation (Quotes [56]-[59]). Steam treating CrOx/H[B]MFI resulted in improved stability on-stream (Quotes [60]-[61]).
13. The effect of acidity on the catalytic performance was elucidated by Michorczyk et al. using Cr-Î²-zeolite, with dealuminated Cr-SiBeta exhibiting significantly higher propene yields compared to Cr-AlBeta (Quotes [66]-[67]). The presence of acid sites in Cr-AlBeta led to increased production of methane and ethene (Quote [68]).
14. The stability of the dealuminated catalyst was improved compared to CrAlbeta, but significant loss in activity was observed over the 4-hour reaction (Quote [71]). A strong correlation was identified between the H2 consumption from H2-TPR studies and the reported propene yield (Quote [72]).
15. The addition of a promoter, such as Ni or Ru, to Cr2O3 catalysts has been shown to be beneficial, increasing propane and CO2 conversion, as well as on-stream stability (Quotes [73]-[75]). The addition of Ni facilitated the re-oxidation of Cr during the reaction, consistent with previously reported mechanisms of deactivation over Cr-based catalysts (Quotes [77]-[78]).
16. The enhanced stability seen in Ni-promoted Cr catalysts was not observed with Ru-promoted Cr catalysts, where aggregation of Cr species was suggested as an additional deactivation mechanism (Quotes [88]-[89]). Ru was found to promote the RWGS reaction, which removes H2 and increases the equilibrium conversion of propane (Quote [90]).
17. Overall, supported chromium oxide catalysts represent one of the most active classes of ODH-CO2 catalysts, with STY values in the range of 222 molC3H6 kgcat1 h1 (Quote [92]). The role of the support is to maximize the active Cr6+ surface area, with chemically-unreactive supports such as SiO2 and activated carbon yielding the most active CrOX catalysts (Quote [93]). However, the poor on-stream stability exhibited by all chromium-based catalysts remains a significant barrier to commercial application (Quote [94]).
