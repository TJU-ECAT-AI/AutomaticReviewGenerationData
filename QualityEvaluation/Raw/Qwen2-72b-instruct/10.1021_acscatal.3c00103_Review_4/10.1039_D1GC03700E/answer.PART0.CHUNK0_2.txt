[1] "The specific requirements of catalyst design for each sub-reaction are discussed and we identify that, regardless of the method of dehydrogenation, the balance of acid and base sites on the catalyst surface is of paramount importance."
[2] "The development of an active, selective and stable catalyst is essential for dehydrogenation to be considered as a viable process in the near- and long-term future."
[3] "In the case of SC and coal-based MTO, this is unavoidable due to the nature of the feedstock. However, natural gas and propane can be produced from biomass. In these cases, the feedstock is renewable and so these processes are potentially much more sustainable than when using fossil fuels."
[4] "The majority of analyses focus on well-established processes, where more information and data are available, but no such analyses were found for oxidative dehydrogenation."
[5] "The thermodynamic tendency to form undesirable by-products means that such reactions must be carefully kinetically controlled. Careful catalyst design can inhibit and even switch-off some of these side-reactions, as will be discussed in the subsequent sections."
[6] "The exact composition of the HGM is likely to include copper oxide and additional promotors such as MnO2, supported on α-Al2O3."
[7] "The role of Cu in the catalyst was to dilute the Pt species and promote desorption of propene, thereby enhancing selectivity."
[8] "The role of the subsurface was to facilitate the activation of propane on the surface."
[9] "The preparation strategy could greatly influence the structure of Ga/SiO2 catalysts."
[10] "The preparation of GaRh supported catalytically active liquid metal solutions."
[11] "The GaPt alloy melts at temperatures between 270 C and 330 C."
[12] "The activity is dependent on the bond strength of the VOsupport bond."
[13] "The metalsupport (VOsupport) interactions affect the resultant catalyst performance."
[14] "The catalyst deactivated quickly due to carbon deposition, but retained its initial activity over the course of ten successive dehydrogenationregeneration cycles."

1.The physicochemical properties of catalysts, including chemical qualities and morphological characteristics, significantly influence their performance in dehydrogenation reactions. The balance of acid and base sites on the catalyst surface is crucial for all dehydrogenation methods. Catalyst design must carefully control the thermodynamic tendency to form undesirable by-products through kinetic control. Support modification strategies, such as the addition of promoters like copper oxide and MnO2, can optimize these properties for enhanced catalytic efficiency and selectivity. The preparation strategy can greatly influence the structure of catalysts, and the use of liquid metal solutions can also improve catalytic activity. The bond strength between the vanadium oxide and the support affects the catalyst performance, and the metalsupport interactions play a significant role in the resultant catalyst performance. However, catalysts can deactivate quickly due to carbon deposition, but may retain their initial activity over successive dehydrogenationregeneration cycles.

1.催化剂的物理化学性质，包括化学品质和形态特征，对脱氢反应的性能有重大影响。催化剂表面酸碱位点的平衡对所有脱氢方法都至关重要。催化剂设计必须通过动力学控制仔细控制形成不希望的副产品的热力学倾向。通过添加如氧化铜和MnO2等促进剂的载体改性策略可以优化这些性质，以提高催化效率和选择性。制备策略可以极大地影响催化剂的结构，使用液态金属溶液也可以提高催化活性。氧化钒与载体之间的键强度影响催化剂性能，金属载体相互作用在最终催化剂性能中起着重要作用。然而，催化剂可能由于碳沉积而迅速失活，但在连续的脱氢再生循环中可能保持其初始活性。
