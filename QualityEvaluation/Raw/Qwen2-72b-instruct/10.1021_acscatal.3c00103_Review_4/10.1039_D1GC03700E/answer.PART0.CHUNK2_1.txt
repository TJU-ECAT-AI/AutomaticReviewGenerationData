1. The physicochemical properties of catalysts, including chemical qualities and morphological characteristics, significantly influence their performance in dehydrogenation reactions. For instance, the role of the support is to maximize the active Cr6+ surface area, which is crucial for the activity of Cr-based catalysts. Chemically unreactive supports, such as SiO2 and activated carbon, yield the most active CrOX catalysts by maximizing the active surface area without adding chemical functionality that could interfere with the catalytic process. However, the poor on-stream stability of chromium-based catalysts is a significant barrier to their commercial application. Support modification strategies, such as the use of activated carbon, can optimize these properties for enhanced catalytic efficiency and selectivity by providing a high surface area without the issues of coking or overreduction that can occur with other supports.
2. The stability of catalysts can be improved in the presence of CO2 compared to direct dehydrogenation (DDH). For example, a 5 wt% ZnO/H-ZSM-5 catalyst retained approximately 74% of its original activity after 10 hours on-stream, which is relatively good compared to Ga- and Cr-based catalysts. This improved stability is attributed to the role of CO2 in assisting the equilibrium by removing H2 via the reverse water-gas shift (RWGS) reaction, which can prevent the overreduction of the catalyst and maintain its activity.
3. The origin of stability in certain catalysts, such as spinel-type Ga2O3Al2O3 mixed oxides, is linked to the low rate of coking associated with the spinel catalyst. This suggests that the structure of the catalyst can play a significant role in its stability and activity. The balance of acid and base sites is also important in mediating the activation of the alkane and the desorption of the alkene. The addition of CO2 can result in competitive adsorption on basic sites, leading to longer surface lifetimes of alkyl intermediates and undesirable side-reactions.
4. The basicity of the In/ZrO2 system was suggested to promote the RWGS reaction, which in turn boosted the ODH-CO2 activity. This highlights the importance of redox and acid-base properties in catalyst design for ODH-CO2. The stability of the catalyst can be improved by controlling these properties and minimizing competing reactions such as reforming.
5. The stability of supported vanadia catalysts can be improved by optimizing the vanadia loading on the support materials. At loadings of less than 5 wt%, the support surface is more exposed, allowing for adsorption of propene and total oxidation, which can lead to higher selectivity. However, at higher loadings, three-dimensional V2O5 clusters begin to form, and these have unreactive bulk V sites, which can decrease the selectivity.
6. The stability of FeCeO2 catalysts was comparable to supported In2O3 and some Ga2O3 catalysts, despite the low selectivity. This suggests that the stability of the catalyst can be improved by controlling the redox properties and minimizing competing reactions such as dry reforming and cracking.

1. 催化剂的物理化学性质，包括化学性质和形态特征，对脱氢反应的性能有重大影响。例如，载体的作用是最大化Cr6+的活性表面积，这是Cr基催化剂活性的关键。化学惰性载体，如SiO2和活性炭，通过最大化活性表面积而不添加可能干扰催化过程的化学功能，产生最活跃的CrOX催化剂。然而，铬基催化剂在流通过程中的稳定性差是其商业应用的主要障碍。通过使用活性炭等载体修改策略，可以优化这些性质，以提高催化效率和选择性，提供高表面积，同时避免与其他载体可能发生的焦化或过度还原问题。
2. 在CO2存在下，催化剂的稳定性可以比直接脱氢（DDH）有所提高。例如，5 wt% ZnO/H-ZSM-5催化剂在10小时流通过程后保留了大约74%的原始活性，与Ga和Cr基催化剂相比，这相对较好。这种改进的稳定性归因于CO2在协助平衡中去除H2通过逆向水煤气变换（RWGS）反应的作用，这可以防止催化剂的过度还原，保持其活性。
3. 某些催化剂，如尖晶石型Ga2O3Al2O3混合氧化物，稳定性的起源与尖晶石催化剂的低焦化率有关。这表明催化剂的结构在其稳定性和活性中起着重要作用。酸碱位点的平衡在调节烷烃的活化和烯烃的解吸中也很重要。CO2的添加会导致在碱性位点上的竞争性吸附，导致烷基中间体的表面寿命更长，从而产生不希望的副反应。
4. In/ZrO2系统的碱性被建议促进RWGS反应，这反过来又提高了ODH-CO2的活性。这突出了在ODH-CO2催化剂设计中氧化还原和酸碱性质的重要性。通过控制这些性质并最小化如重整等竞争反应，可以提高催化剂的稳定性。
5. 支撑钒催化剂的稳定性可以通过优化支撑材料上的钒负载来提高。在小于5 wt%的负载下，支撑表面更暴露，允许丙烯的吸附和完全氧化，这可以导致更高的选择性。然而，在较高负载下，开始形成三维V2O5簇，这些簇具有不活跃的V位点，这会降低选择性。
6. FeCeO2催化剂的稳定性与支撑的In2O3和一些Ga2O3催化剂相当，尽管选择性较低。这表明，通过控制氧化还原性质并最小化如干重整和裂解等竞争反应，可以提高催化剂的稳定性。
