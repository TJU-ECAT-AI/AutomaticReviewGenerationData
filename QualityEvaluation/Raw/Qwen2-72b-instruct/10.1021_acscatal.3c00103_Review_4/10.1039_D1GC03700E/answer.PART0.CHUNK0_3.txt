[1] "The specific requirements of catalyst design for each sub-reaction are discussed and we identify that, regardless of the method of dehydrogenation, the balance of acid and base sites on the catalyst surface is of paramount importance."
[2] "The development of an active, selective and stable catalyst is essential for dehydrogenation to be considered as a viable process in the near- and long-term future."
[3] "In the case of SC and coal-based MTO, this is unavoidable due to the nature of the feedstock. However, natural gas and propane can be produced from biomass."
[4] "The increased interest in direct propane dehydrogenation has been enhanced by the fall in propane price, which is the direct result of the discovery of vast shale gas reserves in North America."
[5] "The production of renewable green propane (also called bio-propane and bioLPG) is an emerging sector which is already being operated on a large scale."
[6] "With increasing pressure to source chemical feedstocks sustainably, we can expect that new interest will focus on renewable and green routes to the key platform chemicals currently required by modern society, and that green propane will play an important role in this."

[14] "The irreversible initial deactivation in the consecutive DDH cycles was attributed to either: (i) structural changes of active species (such as agglomeration), or (ii) collapse of pore structure."
[15] "The positive effect was attributed to the promoters ability to block the sites responsible for coke formation and negligible contribution to undesirable secondary reactions by the additional acid sites generated by the P-based modifier."
[16] "The authors attributed this enhanced performance to a high dispersion of Cr species, moderate acidity and strong metalsupport interactions in the CrOx/H-ZSM-5(260) catalyst."

[18] "The authors attributed high Ga/Al ratios (>0.5) with the formation of additional GaxOy clusters which negatively affected the dehydrogenation rate and thus catalytic performance."
[19] "The activity is dependent on the bond strength of the VOsupport bond. Therefore, it is expected that catalyst performance is affected when different supports, such as SiO2, Al2O3 and ZrO2 are utilised."

1.The physicochemical properties of catalysts, including chemical qualities (such as acid strength and stability) and morphological characteristics, play a crucial role in their performance in dehydrogenation reactions. The balance of acid and base sites on the catalyst surface is of paramount importance, regardless of the method of dehydrogenation. The development of an active, selective, and stable catalyst is essential for dehydrogenation to be considered a viable process in the near and long-term future. Support modification strategies can be employed to optimize these properties for enhanced catalytic efficiency and selectivity. The modification of Al2O3 with metal oxides, such as TiO2, has shown promising results. The role of subsurface layers in supported nanoparticles can also be crucial in facilitating the activation of propane on the surface. The irreversible initial deactivation in consecutive dehydrogenation cycles can be attributed to structural changes of active species or collapse of pore structure. Promoters can block sites responsible for coke formation and contribute to desirable secondary reactions by generating additional acid sites. The dispersion of Cr species, moderate acidity, and strong metalsupport interactions can enhance the performance of Cr-based catalysts. High Ga/Al ratios can negatively affect the dehydrogenation rate and catalytic performance due to the formation of additional GaxOy clusters. The bond strength of the VOsupport bond affects catalyst performance, and different supports can influence the distribution of V oxidation states.

1.催化剂的物理化学性质，包括化学品质（如酸强度和稳定性）和形态特征，在脱氢反应中起着至关重要的作用。无论采用哪种脱氢方法，催化剂表面酸碱位点的平衡都是至关重要的。开发活性、选择性和稳定的催化剂对于脱氢反应在近期和长期被视为可行的过程至关重要。可以通过优化这些性质以增强催化效率和选择性的支持修改策略。例如，将Al2O3与金属氧化物（如TiO2）进行改性已经显示出有希望的结果。在支撑的纳米粒子中，亚表面层的作用对于促进丙烷在表面上的活化至关重要。在连续的脱氢循环中，不可逆的初始失活可归因于活性物种的结构变化或孔结构的坍塌。促进剂可以阻止负责焦炭形成的位点，并通过生成额外的酸位点促进期望的二次反应。Cr物种的分散、适度的酸度和强烈的金属-支持物相互作用可以增强Cr基催化剂的性能。高Ga/Al比可以由于形成额外的GaxOy簇而对脱氢速率和催化性能产生负面影响。VOsupport键的键强度影响催化剂性能，不同的支持物可以影响V氧化态的分布。
