[1] "The cationanion double hydrolysis approach (CADH), used for the synthesis of mesoporous Al2O3 with high surface area and a pure γ-Al2O3 phase, was undertaken with the crystallisation temperature varied between 25120 C.141 It was found that the crystallisation temperature of the support directly influenced the catalytic performance of the VOx/Al2O3 catalysts, which was a consequence of the increase in Lewis acid sites with increasing crystallization temperatures up to 100 C. This in turn affected the distribution of different surface V species."
[2] "Gu et al. reported that P modification could greatly influence the structure and activity of VOx/Al2O3 catalysts.142 More specifically, P modification decreased the degree of VOx polymerization, which had positive implications on the catalyst stability, as evidenced by the retention of high activity (ca. 45% propane conversion) after an 8 h DDH reaction in all P-modified catalysts."
[3] "Subsequent studies on a VOx/Al2O3 catalysts (with 12 wt% V loading) modified with Mg revealed the anti-coking capability and improved catalytic performance evident through propene yields of 1927% over a 6 h DDH reaction.143 It was found that the dispersing action of Mg modification to V2O5 crystallites and an increase in active V3+ species reduced the amount and polymerization of coke deposits."
[4] "The concentration of dopant atoms, and the temperature of reduction were other contributing factors that affected the catalytic behaviour for ZrO2-based catalysts.3 Numerous binary YZrOx and LaZrOx-based catalysts displayed high activity, selectivity and stability as well as comparable performance to KCrOx/Al2O3 catalysts over the course of 60 DDH cycles at 550 C, 600 C and 625 C under industrially relevant conditions. The experimental parameters had a beneficial effect on the concentration of Zrcus4+ ions, and the concentration of surface lattice oxygen, which in tandem play an active role in propane activation."

1.The physicochemical properties of catalysts, including chemical qualities and morphological characteristics, significantly influence their performance in dehydrogenation reactions. For instance, the crystallization temperature of the support can directly impact the catalytic performance of VOx/Al2O3 catalysts by affecting the distribution of different surface V species and the number of Lewis acid sites. P modification can decrease the degree of VOx polymerization, enhancing catalyst stability and retaining high activity. Mg modification can improve catalytic performance and anti-coking capability by reducing the amount and polymerization of coke deposits. The concentration of dopant atoms and the temperature of reduction can also affect the catalytic behavior of ZrO2-based catalysts, influencing the concentration of active Zrcus4+ ions and surface lattice oxygen, which play a crucial role in propane activation.

1.催化剂的物理化学性质，包括化学品质和形态特征，对脱氢反应的性能有重大影响。例如，支撑材料的结晶温度可以直接影响VOx/Al2O3催化剂的催化性能，通过影响不同表面V物种的分布和Lewis酸位点的数量。P改性可以降低VOx的聚合程度，增强催化剂的稳定性，保持高活性。Mg改性可以减少焦炭沉积的数量和聚合，提高催化性能和抗焦炭能力。掺杂原子的浓度和还原温度也会影响ZrO2基催化剂的催化行为，影响活性Zrcus4+离子和表面晶格氧的浓度，这些在丙烷活化中起着关键作用。
