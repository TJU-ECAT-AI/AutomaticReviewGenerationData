[1] "The specific requirements of catalyst design for each sub-reaction are discussed and we identify that, regardless of the method of dehydrogenation, the balance of acid and base sites on the catalyst surface is of paramount importance."
[2] "The development of an active, selective and stable catalyst is essential for dehydrogenation to be considered as a viable process in the near- and long-term future."
[3] "In the case of SC and coal-based MTO, this is unavoidable due to the nature of the feedstock. However, natural gas and propane can be produced from biomass. In these cases, the feedstock is renewable and so these processes are potentially much more sustainable than when using fossil fuels."
[4] "The majority (86%) of filed patents are for DDH catalysts, followed by ODH-O2 (12%) and finally ODH-CO2 (2.4%)."
[5] "The exact composition of the HGM is likely to include copper oxide and additional promotors such as MnO2, supported on α-Al2O3."
[6] "The role of Cu in the catalyst was to dilute the Pt species and promote desorption of propene, thereby enhancing selectivity."
[7] "The h-BN nanosheets provided abundant stacking fault edges terminated with BO defects that are associated with unpaired electrons, which strongly interact with active metal species, helping to strengthen the interaction between the metal and support."
[8] "The most common deactivation pathway is coking, which can cause sintering in both the support and Cr."
[9] "Efforts to improve catalyst design include using supports with ordered mesoporosity and moderate surface acidity, both of which aid mass transfer and avoid undesirable secondary reactions."
[10] "Promoting elements have been found to cause beneficial geometric and electronic effects on both the supports and CrOx species."
[11] "However, significant environmental and safety concerns still exist in the preparation, usage and disposal of CrOx-based catalysts due to the associated toxicity."
[12] "Ga catalysts generally exhibit STYs that are one order of magnitude lower than Pt catalysts, and the most active CrOx catalysts, but have the advantage of being benign and inexpensive."
[13] "The nature of the support is an essential parameter to consider as several possible VOx can species exist."
[14] "It is generally accepted that the metalsupport (VOsupport) interactions affect the resultant catalyst performance."
[15] "The activity is dependent on the bond strength of the VOsupport bond."
[16] "Therefore, it is expected that catalyst performance is affected when different supports, such as SiO2, Al2O3 and ZrO2 are utilised."

1.The physicochemical properties of catalysts, including chemical qualities and morphological characteristics, significantly influence their performance in dehydrogenation reactions. The balance of acid and base sites on the catalyst surface is crucial for all dehydrogenation methods. The development of an active, selective, and stable catalyst is essential for dehydrogenation to be considered a viable process in the future. Support modification strategies can optimize these properties for enhanced catalytic efficiency and selectivity. Using supports with ordered mesoporosity and moderate surface acidity can aid mass transfer and avoid undesirable secondary reactions. Promoting elements can cause beneficial geometric and electronic effects on both the supports and active species. However, environmental and safety concerns exist in the preparation, usage, and disposal of certain catalysts due to their toxicity. Ga catalysts, while less active than Pt and Cr catalysts, have the advantage of being benign and inexpensive. The nature of the support is essential for vanadium-based catalysts, as the metalsupport interactions affect the resultant catalyst performance. The activity is dependent on the bond strength of the VOsupport bond, and catalyst performance is affected by different supports.
