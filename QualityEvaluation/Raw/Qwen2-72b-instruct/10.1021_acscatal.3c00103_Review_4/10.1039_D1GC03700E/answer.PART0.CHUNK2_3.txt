[1] "The first study of Cr2O3-based catalysts for ODH-CO2 was reported by Takahara et al. in 1996 using Cr2O3 supported on SiO2, activated carbon (AC) or Al2O3."
[2] "The 5 wt% Cr2O3/SiO2 catalyst deactivated rapidly, retaining just 66% of its original activity after 4 h on-stream."
[3] "The stability was noted to the same with or without CO2 in the reactant feed."
[4] "Not only did this study establish Cr2O3 as an active ODH-CO2 catalyst, it also captured one of the recurring themes in catalyst design for ODH-CO2: some catalysts are inhibited by the addition of CO2 while others perform much better."
[5] "The correct balance of acidic and basic sites is a key consideration in catalyst design."
[6] "Equally, the ratio of carbon dioxide to propane is important to take in account, as it has kinetic and thermodynamic implications."
[7] "Thermodynamically, higher CO2:C3H8 ratios limit coke forming side-reactions."
[8] "The addition of CO2 in the dehydrogenation reaction has multiple effects: As discussed in Section 2, it facilitates the RWGS reaction which removes H2 from the system and shifts the thermodynamic equilibrium limit to favour propene production."
[9] "Additionally, CO2 can dissociate on the surface of a catalyst and provide O species to dehydrogenate propane directly."
[10] "Finally, it can react with coke via the reverse-Boudouard reaction to produce CO, which can potentially extend the lifetime of the catalyst."
[11] "The role of the support is simply to maximise the active Cr6+ surface area, rather than add any chemical functionality, hence this is the reason why chemically-unreactive supports such as SiO2 and activated carbon yield the most active CrOX catalysts."
[12] "The most significant barrier to commercial application is the poor on-stream stability exhibited by all chromium-based catalysts."
[13] "While incremental improvements in the activity of Cr catalysts have been reported since their initial discovery, significant advances in catalyst stability have been relatively few."
[14] "The addition of Al2O3 to ODH-CO2 catalysts is typically not beneficial."
[15] "Although the addition of Al2O3 to ODH-CO2 catalysts is typically not beneficial, Chen et al. investigated spinel-type Ga2O3Al2O3 mixed oxides and showed that they can function as stable catalysts."
[16] "The origin of stability was linked to the low rate of coking associated with the spinel catalyst."
[17] "Using NH3-TPD analysis, the authors concluded that weak Lewis acid sites were conducive to high activity."
[18] "These acidbase properties most likely contribute to the enhanced stability as well; it is known that stronger acid sites promote oligomerisation pathways that produce coke."
[19] "The increased performance of Ga2O3/ZSM-48 was attributed to the abundance of weak and medium strength acid sites."
[20] "The low activity of Ga2O3/MgO and Ga2O3/SiO2 was ascribed to the absence of medium and strong acid sites."
[21] "In the Ga2O3/TiO2 catalyst, a significant proportion of the Ga (45%) was reduced."
[22] "This catalyst exhibited the highest propane conversion, but with a propene selectivity of 73% it did not result in the highest propene yield."
[23] "The origin of this induction period was found to be reduction of In2O3 to In0 nanoclusters, which suggests the active structure is more of a supported nanoparticle type catalyst than a mixed-metal oxide."
[24] "The basicity of the In/ZrO2 system was suggested to promote the RWGS reaction, which in turn boosted the ODH-CO2 activity."
[25] "It was found that 10 mol% Fe in CeO2 exhibited the highest propene yield."
[26] "The major side-reactions observed were dry reforming and cracking."
[27] "They showed that reforming pathways were more prevalent at higher CO2:C3H8 ratios, such as 2.5:1 and 5:1."
[28] "Despite the low selectivity, the FeCeO2 catalysts exhibited a comparable STY to supported In2O3 and some Ga2O3 catalysts."
[29] "The number of studies on supported nanoparticle catalysts for ODH-CO2 are relatively few and those available indicate that this field of research has great potential."
[30] "The major challenge is in understanding and inhibiting side-reactions such as reforming, which are known to proceed over this class of catalyst, unlike in Cr- and Ga-based catalysts."
[31] "Careful consideration of the nanostructure and composition has shown that the selectivity can be readily tuned to favour different pathways, and further investigation in this area may well be able to harness the high activity of supported nanoparticles as well as favour dehydrogenation pathways."
[32] "Despite dozens of reports over several decades on Cr- and Ga- based catalysts, the improvements in catalyst performance have been incremental."
[33] "The knowledge gained from these studies on the importance of reducibility and the balance of acid and base sites should be applied to supported NP catalysts, which are a promising and somewhat neglected category of ODH-CO2 catalyst."
