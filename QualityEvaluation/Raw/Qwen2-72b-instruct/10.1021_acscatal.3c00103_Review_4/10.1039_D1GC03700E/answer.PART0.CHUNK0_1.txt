1.The balance of acid and base sites on the catalyst surface is crucial for dehydrogenation reactions, regardless of the method used. The development of an active, selective, and stable catalyst is essential for dehydrogenation to be considered a viable process in the near and long-term future. Support modification strategies, such as the addition of copper oxide and other promoters, can optimize the physicochemical properties of catalysts for enhanced catalytic efficiency and selectivity. For example, the use of hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) nanosheets as a support can provide abundant stacking fault edges terminated with BO defects, which strongly interact with active metal species, helping to strengthen the interaction between the metal and support. The preparation of new catalysts with simultaneously enhanced activity, selectivity, and stability is the ultimate goal. The modification of Al2O3 with metal oxides, such as TiO2, has been undertaken with some promising results. The enhanced performance was ascribed to electron transfer and acid site modulation effects, resulting in changes to the adsorption properties of Pt. The role of the subsurface was to facilitate the activation of propane on the surface. The role of Cu in the catalyst was to dilute the Pt species and promote desorption of propene, thereby enhancing selectivity.

1.无论采用哪种脱氢方法，催化剂表面酸碱位点的平衡对脱氢反应至关重要。开发活性、选择性和稳定性高的催化剂对于脱氢在近期和远期被视为可行的过程至关重要。通过添加氧化铜和其他促进剂等支持修改策略，可以优化催化剂的物理化学性质，以提高催化效率和选择性。例如，使用六方氮化硼(h-BN)纳米片作为支撑，可以提供大量终止于BO缺陷的堆叠故障边缘，这些缺陷与未配对电子相关，与活性金属物种强烈相互作用，有助于增强金属与支撑之间的相互作用。制备同时具有增强活性、选择性和稳定性的新催化剂是最终目标。对Al2O3进行金属氧化物(如TiO2)的改性已取得一些有希望的结果。性能的提高归因于电子转移和酸位点调制效应，导致Pt吸附性质的变化。次表面的作用是促进丙烷在表面的活化。催化剂中Cu的作用是稀释Pt物种，促进丙烯的解吸，从而提高选择性。
