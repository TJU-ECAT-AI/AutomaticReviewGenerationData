[1] "The cationanion double hydrolysis approach (CADH), used for the synthesis of mesoporous Al2O3 with high surface area and a pure γ-Al2O3 phase, was undertaken with the crystallisation temperature varied between 25120 C.141 It was found that the crystallisation temperature of the support directly influenced the catalytic performance of the VOx/Al2O3 catalysts, which was a consequence of the increase in Lewis acid sites with increasing crystallization temperatures up to 100 C. This in turn affected the distribution of different surface V species."
[2] "Gu et al. reported that P modification could greatly influence the structure and activity of VOx/Al2O3 catalysts.142 More specifically, P modification decreased the degree of VOx polymerization, which had positive implications on the catalyst stability, as evidenced by the retention of high activity (ca. 45% propane conversion) after an 8 h DDH reaction in all P-modified catalysts."
[3] "Subsequent studies on a VOx/Al2O3 catalysts (with 12 wt% V loading) modified with Mg revealed the anti-coking capability and improved catalytic performance evident through propene yields of 1927% over a 6 h DDH reaction.143 It was found that the dispersing action of Mg modification to V2O5 crystallites and an increase in active V3+ species reduced the amount and polymerization of coke deposits."
[4] "Hu et al. investigated the influence of gelation and calcination temperatures on the properties and catalytic performance.147 Interestingly, enhancement to catalytic performance in terms of propane conversion, propene selectivity and yield of propene were observed for VOx/SiO2 catalysts (gelation temperature: 60 C, calcination temperature: 580 C)."
[5] "Dealuminated beta zeolites (Si-beta) are promising catalyst supports due to their high surface area and thermal stability as mentioned before. Chen et al. synthesized numerous VOx/Si-beta zeolites with various V loadings (in the 0.510 wt% range) with the initial propane conversion shown to linearly increase with the amount of acid sites, Fig. 6.148 This demonstrated the dependency of catalytic activity on total Lewis and Brnsted acid sites generated by VOx on silica, with Brnsted acid sites disappearing after high temperature treatment due to decomposition of hydrated VOx."
[6] "Alternatively, ZrO2 can be used as a support for VOx. It was found that VOx/ZrO2 is approximately five times more active than VOx/Al2O3 and pure ZrO2, exhibiting a STY of 9.2 molC3H6 kg1cat h1 (Table 6, entry 2).149 The authors proposed that the enhanced performance of VOx/ZrO2 results from the facile reduction of VO, VOV and VOZr bonds, thus producing higher proportions of the active V3+ species."

1.The physicochemical properties of catalysts, including chemical qualities and morphological characteristics, significantly influence their performance in dehydrogenation reactions. For instance, the crystallization temperature of the support directly affects the catalytic performance of VOx/Al2O3 catalysts by increasing Lewis acid sites and influencing the distribution of different surface V species. P modification can decrease the degree of VOx polymerization, enhancing catalyst stability and activity. Mg modification can improve catalytic performance and anti-coking capability by dispersing V2O5 crystallites and increasing active V3+ species. Gelation and calcination temperatures also impact the catalytic performance of VOx/SiO2 catalysts in terms of propane conversion, propene selectivity, and yield of propene. Dealuminated beta zeolites (Si-beta) are promising catalyst supports due to their high surface area and thermal stability, and the initial propane conversion linearly increases with the amount of acid sites. VOx/ZrO2 is more active than VOx/Al2O3 and pure ZrO2 due to the facile reduction of VO, VOV, and VOZr bonds, producing higher proportions of the active V3+ species.

1.催化剂的物理化学性质，包括化学品质和形态特征，对脱氢反应的性能有重大影响。例如，支撑物的结晶温度直接影响VOx/Al2O3催化剂的催化性能，通过增加Lewis酸位点和影响不同表面V物种的分布。P改性可以降低VOx的聚合度，增强催化剂的稳定性和活性。Mg改性可以通过分散V2O5晶体和增加活性V3+物种来改善催化性能和抗焦炭能力。凝胶化和煅烧温度也影响VOx/SiO2催化剂在丙烷转化率、丙烯选择性和丙烯产量方面的催化性能。脱铝β沸石（Si-beta）是很有前景的催化剂支撑物，因为它们具有高表面积和热稳定性，初始丙烷转化率随着酸位点数量的增加而线性增加。VOx/ZrO2比VOx/Al2O3和纯ZrO2更活跃，因为VO、VOV和VOZr键的容易还原，产生更高比例的活性V3+物种。
