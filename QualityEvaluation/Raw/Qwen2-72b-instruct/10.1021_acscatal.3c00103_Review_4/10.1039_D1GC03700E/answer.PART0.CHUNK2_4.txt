[1] "The role of the support is simply to maximise the active Cr6+ surface area, rather than add any chemical functionality, hence this is the reason why chemically-unreactive supports such as SiO2 and activated carbon yield the most active CrOX catalysts."
[2] "The most significant barrier to commercial application is the poor on-stream stability exhibited by all chromium-based catalysts."
[3] "While the majority of investigations on ODH-CO2 Cr2O3 catalysts have focused on support modifications, the addition of a promotor has also been shown to be beneficial."
[4] "The effect of the support was closely examined for propane ODH-CO2 by Xu et al.114 It was found that Ga2O3 supported on TiO2, Al2O3, and ZrO2 exhibited high activity, while SiO2 and MgO resulted in poorer performing catalysts."
[5] "In addition to the acidbase properties of the support, the authors considered the interaction between the Ga and the support to be of importance."
[6] "The origin of stability was linked to the low rate of coking associated with the spinel catalyst."
[7] "The stability was improved in the presence of CO2 (compared to DDH); ca. 74% of the original activity was retained after 10 h on-stream, which is relatively good compared to Ga- and Cr-based catalysts."
[8] "The stability of the dealuminated catalyst was also improved compared with CrAlbeta, but significant loss in activity was observed over the 4 h reaction."
