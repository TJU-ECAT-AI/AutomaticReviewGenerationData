1.The literature does not provide specific information on how physicochemical properties of catalysts influence their performance in dehydrogenation reactions or on support modification strategies to optimize these properties. However, it does discuss the influence of support acidity on the electronic properties of supported metals, and how the presence of metals affects the acidic properties of supports. The study shows that the electronic properties of Pt are influenced by the acidity of the support, and the alteration of Pt properties increases with increasing acidity of the support. At the same time, the presence of platinum affects the acidic properties of the supports by reducing the strength of the acid sites. This is observed directly as the changes in desorption of pyridine from the acid sites and indirectly as the suppression of cracking reactions during the ring opening of decalin on the Pt-modified catalysts.

1.文献没有提供催化剂的物理化学性质如何影响其在脱氢反应中的性能，或支持修改策略以优化这些性质的具体信息。但是，它确实讨论了支持酸度对支持金属的电子性质的影响，以及金属的存在如何影响支持的酸性性质。研究显示，Pt的电子性质受支持酸度的影响，且Pt性质的改变随支持酸度的增加而增加。同时，铂的存在通过降低酸位点的强度影响支持的酸性性质。这直接表现为从酸位点脱附的吡啶的变化，并间接表现为在Pt改性催化剂上脱氢反应期间裂解反应的抑制。
