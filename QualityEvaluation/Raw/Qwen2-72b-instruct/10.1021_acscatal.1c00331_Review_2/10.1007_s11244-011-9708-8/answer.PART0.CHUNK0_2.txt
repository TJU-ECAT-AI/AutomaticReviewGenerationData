[1] "The rate of coke formation on the metal is weakly dependent on the propylene and hydrogen pressures but increasing with the propane pressure, while the rate of coke formation on the support is increasing with the propane and propylene pressures and decreasing with the hydrogen pressure."

1.Hydrogen cofeeding in the propane dehydrogenation (PDH) process affects coke formation and catalyst stability by decreasing the rate of coke formation on the support, while having a weak effect on the rate of coke formation on the metal. The presence of hydrogen weakens the acidity of the support, reducing the coke formation rate. This has implications for the overall process efficiency and performance, as it can extend the catalyst's lifetime and reduce the frequency of regeneration cycles.

1.在丙烷脱氢(PDH)过程中，氢气共进料通过降低支撑上的焦炭形成速率，影响焦炭形成和催化剂稳定性，而对金属上的焦炭形成速率影响较弱。氢气的存在削弱了支撑的酸性，降低了焦炭形成速率。这对整体过程效率和性能有影响，因为它可以延长催化剂的寿命，减少再生周期的频率。
