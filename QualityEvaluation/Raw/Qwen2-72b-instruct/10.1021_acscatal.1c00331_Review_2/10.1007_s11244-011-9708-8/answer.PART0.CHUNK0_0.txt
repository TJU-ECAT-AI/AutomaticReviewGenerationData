[1] "The rate of coke formation on the metal is weakly dependent on the propylene and hydrogen pressures but increasing with the propane pressure, while the rate of coke formation on the support is increasing with the propane and propylene pressures and decreasing with the hydrogen pressure."

1.Hydrogen cofeeding in the propane dehydrogenation (PDH) process affects coke formation by decreasing the rate of coke formation on the support, while having a weak effect on the rate of coke formation on the metal. The presence of hydrogen reduces the rate of coke formation on the support by decreasing with the hydrogen pressure. This implies that hydrogen cofeeding can improve catalyst stability by reducing coke accumulation on the support, which is beneficial for the overall process efficiency and performance.

1.在丙烷脱氢(PDH)过程中，氢气共进料通过降低支撑上的焦炭形成速率来影响焦炭形成，而对金属上的焦炭形成速率的影响较弱。氢气的存在通过降低氢气压力减少了支撑上的焦炭形成速率。这意味着氢气共进料可以通过减少支撑上的焦炭积累来提高催化剂稳定性，这对整体过程效率和性能有益。
