[1] "The rate of coke formation on the metal is weakly dependent on the propylene and hydrogen pressures but increasing with the propane pressure, while the rate of coke formation on the support is increasing with the propane and propylene pressures and decreasing with the hydrogen pressure."

1.Hydrogen cofeeding in the propane dehydrogenation (PDH) process affects coke formation and catalyst stability by decreasing the rate of coke formation on the support, while having a weak effect on the rate of coke formation on the metal. The presence of hydrogen weakens the acidity of the support, reducing the formation of hard coke. However, hydrogen does not significantly affect the formation of soft coke on the metal. The reaction mechanisms are influenced by hydrogen, as it can suppress the formation of coke precursors and reduce the molecular weight of polymers during propylene polymerization. These effects have implications for the overall process efficiency and performance, as reducing coke formation can increase the propylene productivity and extend the catalyst's life, leading to a more efficient and stable PDH process.

1.在丙烷脱氢(PDH)过程中，氢气共进料通过降低支撑上的焦炭形成速率，影响焦炭形成和催化剂稳定性，而对金属上的焦炭形成速率影响较弱。氢气的存在削弱了支撑的酸性，减少了硬焦的形成。然而，氢气对金属上软焦的形成影响不大。反应机制受到氢气的影响，因为它可以抑制焦炭前体的形成，降低丙烯聚合过程中聚合物的分子量。这些影响对整体过程效率和性能有影响，因为减少焦炭形成可以提高丙烯产量，延长催化剂寿命，从而实现更高效、更稳定的PDH过程。
