[1] "The rate of coke formation on the metal is weakly dependent on the propylene and hydrogen pressures but increasing with the propane pressure, while the rate of coke formation on the support is increasing with the propane and propylene pressures and decreasing with the hydrogen pressure."

1.Hydrogen cofeeding in the propane dehydrogenation (PDH) process affects coke formation and catalyst stability by decreasing the rate of coke formation on the support, while having a weak effect on the rate of coke formation on the metal. The presence of hydrogen reduces the rate of coke formation on the support by decreasing the propylene and propane pressures. This has implications for the overall process efficiency and performance, as reducing coke formation can extend catalyst life and reduce the need for regeneration, leading to higher productivity and lower operating costs.

1.在丙烷脱氢(PDH)过程中，氢气共进料通过降低支撑物上的焦炭形成速率，影响焦炭形成和催化剂稳定性，而对金属上的焦炭形成速率影响较弱。氢气的存在通过降低丙烯和丙烷的压力，减少了支撑物上的焦炭形成速率。这对整体过程效率和性能有影响，因为减少焦炭形成可以延长催化剂寿命，减少再生需求，从而提高生产力，降低运营成本。
