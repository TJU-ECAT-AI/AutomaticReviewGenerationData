          [1] "The rate of coke formation on the metal is weakly dependent on the propylene and hydrogen pressures but increasing with the propane pressure, while the rate of coke formation on the support is increasing with the propane and propylene pressures and decreasing with the hydrogen pressure."

          Hydrogen cofeeding in the propane dehydrogenation (PDH) process affects coke formation by decreasing the rate of coke formation on the support, while having a weak effect on the rate of coke formation on the metal. The presence of hydrogen reduces the rate of coke formation on the support by decreasing the propylene and propane pressures. Hydrogen can suppress the formation of coke precursors and reduce the rate of catalyst deactivation. However, hydrogen cannot remove the coke that has already been formed on the catalyst. The addition of hydrogen in the feed greatly suppresses coke formation, and the decrease in the total amount of coke is mainly due to the decrease of the area of Peak II, which corresponds to the coke formed on the support. The shift of Peak II to lower temperature as the partial pressure of hydrogen increases indicates that hydrogen promotes the formation of softer coke on the support. The apparent reaction order of coking on the support is about first order with respect to propylene, 0.7 order with respect to hydrogen, and 1.4 order with respect to propane. This suggests that coke can be formed both from propane and propylene, but with different reaction mechanisms. The presence of hydrogen will weaken the acidity of the support by converting Brnsted acid sites to Lewis acid sites and thus reduce the coke formation rate. Hydrogen cofeeding affects coke formation and catalyst stability by decreasing the rate of coke formation on the support, while having a weak effect on the rate of coke formation on the metal. The presence of hydrogen weakens the acidity of the support, reducing the formation of hard coke. However, hydrogen does not significantly affect the formation of soft coke on the metal. The reaction mechanisms are influenced by hydrogen, as it can suppress the formation of coke precursors and reduce the molecular weight of polymers during propylene polymerization.

          在丙烷脱氢(PDH)过程中，氢气共进料通过降低支撑上的焦炭形成速率来影响焦炭形成，而对金属上的焦炭形成速率的影响较弱。氢气的存在通过降低丙烯和丙烷的压力，减少了支撑上的焦炭形成速率。氢气的存在可以抑制焦炭前体的形成，降低催化剂失活的速率。然而，氢气无法去除已经沉积在催化剂上的焦炭。在进料中添加氢气可以大大抑制焦炭的形成，总焦炭量的减少主要是由于峰II区域的减少，这对应于在支撑上形成的焦炭。随着氢气分压的增加，峰II向较低温度的移动表明氢气促进了支撑上较软焦炭的形成。支撑上焦炭形成的表观反应级数关于丙烯约为一级，关于氢气约为0.7级，关于丙烷约为1.4级。这表明焦炭可以从丙烷和丙烯中形成，但具有不同的反应机制。氢气的存在会通过将Brnsted酸位转化为Lewis酸位来减弱支撑的酸性，从而降低焦炭的形成速率。在丙烷脱氢(PDH)过程中，氢气共进料通过降低支撑上的焦炭形成速率，影响焦炭形成和催化剂稳定性，而对金属上的焦炭形成速率影响较弱。氢气的存在削弱了支撑的酸性，减少了硬焦的形成。然而，氢气对金属上软焦的形成影响不大。反应机制受到氢气的影响，因为它可以抑制焦炭前体的形成，降低丙烯聚合过程中聚合物的分子量。
