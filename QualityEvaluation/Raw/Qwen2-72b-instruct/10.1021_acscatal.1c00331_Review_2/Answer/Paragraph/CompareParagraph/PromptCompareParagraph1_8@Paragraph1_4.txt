The comprehensive effects and mechanisms of hydrogen cofeeding on coke formation, catalyst stability, and reaction dynamics in the propane dehydrogenation (PDH) process are elucidated through a synthesis of findings from multiple studies \[10.1002/anie.201701115\], \[10.1016/j.jcat.2010.06.016\], \[10.1039/c3cp50646k\], \[10.1039/c3cp53796j\], \[10.1006/jcat.1996.0361\], \[10.1021/acscatal.1c00331\_2\], and \[10.1007/s11244-011-9708-8\]. Hydrogen cofeeding suppresses coke formation by maintaining a reducing atmosphere, preventing coke precursor formation, and enhancing hydrogen-assisted dehydrogenation \[10.1002/anie.201701115\], \[10.1016/j.jcat.2010.06.016\]. This results in improved catalyst stability and prolonged catalyst life, enhancing process efficiency and performance by reducing deactivation and regeneration needs \[10.1002/anie.201701115\]. Hydrogen cofeeding also boosts alkene formation by enhancing hydrogen-assisted dehydrogenation, with minimal impact on alkene selectivity \[10.1016/j.jcat.2010.06.016\]. It significantly reduces coke formation by hydrogenating coke precursor species and alters coke deposits, promoting smaller, less defective graphite crystallites \[10.1039/c3cp50646k\]. Hydrogen cofeeding raises the energy barrier for the third, undesired cleavage step more than the first two, enhancing selectivity towards alkene formation \[10.1039/c3cp53796j\]. It suppresses coke precursor formation, preventing coke buildup and maintaining catalyst activity \[10.1006/jcat.1996.0361\]. Hydrogen cofeeding decreases coke on the support while keeping metal coke levels stable, weakens support acidity, and converts Lewis to Brnsted acid sites, reducing coking \[10.1021/acscatal.1c00331\_2\]. It decreases the total coke amount, especially on the support, promoting softer coke formation \[10.1007/s11244-011-9708-8\].
                    
                    Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: The insights gained from the comprehensive analysis of hydrogen cofeeding in PDH processes suggest a promising avenue for enhancing catalyst performance and process efficiency. The multifaceted role of hydrogen in suppressing coke formation, altering coke deposits, and enhancing alkene selectivity opens up opportunities for developing more efficient and stable catalysts. Future research could focus on optimizing the hydrogen-to-propane ratio to maximize the benefits while minimizing any potential drawbacks. Additionally, exploring the effects of hydrogen cofeeding on different catalyst compositions and reaction conditions could lead to the discovery of novel catalysts with enhanced stability and selectivity. The impact of hydrogen cofeeding on the energy barriers and reaction mechanisms also warrants further investigation to fully understand its role in the PDH process. These advancements could potentially lead to significant improvements in the overall efficiency and performance of PDH processes, contributing to the broader field of catalysis and chemical engineering.

Hydrogen cofeeding in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) significantly suppresses coke formation, akin to water vapor's effect, by maintaining a reducing atmosphere that prevents coke precursor formation \[10.1002/anie.201701115\]. This enhances catalyst stability and efficiency by reducing deactivation and regeneration needs, potentially prolonging catalyst life and enhancing process performance. Hydrogen cofeeding accelerates hydrogen-assisted dehydrogenation, with minimal impact on alkene selectivity, which remains near 100% \[10.1016/j.jcat.2010.06.016\]. It significantly reduces coke formation by hydrogenating coke precursors, and the presence of Ga in the catalyst further suppresses coke formation. The hydrogen-to-propane ratio affects propene formation differently than ethene, with a greater impact on propene selectivity, yet it remains above 95.5%. Hydrogen cofeeding enhances catalyst performance, akin to Sn addition, boosting propane conversion and propene selectivity \[10.1039/c3cp50646k\]. It alters coke deposits, forming smaller, less defective graphite crystallites. Competitive adsorption of hydrogen on the catalyst surface reduces carbon species, hindering coke formation. This decreases coke deposition, as confirmed by Raman spectroscopy, and increases conversion and selectivity, especially at 75% propane concentration. Hydrogen cofeeding reduces coke formation and enhances alkene selectivity \[10.1039/c3cp53796j\]. Adsorbed hydrogen facilitates alkene desorption over further dehydrogenation, raising the energy barrier for undesired cleavage more than for desired steps. This improves selectivity towards alkenes, optimizing process efficiency.
                    
                    Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: The comprehensive effects of hydrogen cofeeding on coke formation, catalyst stability, and reaction dynamics in the PDH process highlight the potential for advanced catalyst design and process optimization. Future research might focus on developing catalysts with enhanced hydrogenation capabilities to further suppress coke formation and improve selectivity. The exploration of novel hydrogen cofeeding strategies, such as dynamic hydrogen-to-propane ratio adjustments, could optimize process efficiency and alkene yields. Additionally, the integration of in-situ spectroscopic techniques for real-time monitoring of coke formation and catalyst activity could provide deeper insights into the reaction mechanisms and guide the development of more efficient PDH processes.
