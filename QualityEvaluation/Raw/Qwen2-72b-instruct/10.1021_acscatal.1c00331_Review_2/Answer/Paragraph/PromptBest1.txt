Hydrogen cofeeding in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) significantly suppresses coke formation, akin to water vapor's effect at high temperatures, by maintaining a reducing atmosphere that prevents coke precursor formation \[10.1002/anie.201701115\]. This enhances catalyst stability and efficiency by reducing deactivation and regeneration needs, potentially improving overall process performance. Hydrogen cofeeding enhances alkene formation by accelerating hydrogen-assisted dehydrogenation of surface alkyl species, with little effect on alkene selectivity, which remains near 100% \[10.1016/j.jcat.2010.06.016\]. It significantly reduces coke formation on catalysts by hydrogenating coke precursor species. The presence of Ga in the catalyst further suppresses coke formation. As alkene concentration approaches equilibrium, the rate of alkene formation decreases with increasing H2/alkane ratio. The lower coke formation during propane dehydrogenation compared to ethane dehydrogenation is attributed to the greater ease of hydrogenation of propyli-dyne compared to ethylidyne. Hydrogen cofeeding enhances catalyst performance, akin to adding Sn, boosting propane conversion and propene selectivity \[10.1039/c3cp50646k\]. It alters coke deposits, promoting smaller, less defective graphite crystallites. By competitively adsorbing on the catalyst surface, hydrogen suppresses coke formation, reducing carbon species' surface coverage, which lessens polymerization and coke formation. This increases catalyst stability, conversion, and selectivity on Pt-Sn/Al2O3 catalysts, with optimal performance at 75% propane concentration. Hydrogen cofeeding reduces coke formation, enhances alkene desorption, and raises the energy barrier for undesired cleavage steps, improving selectivity towards alkene formation \[10.1039/c3cp53796j\]. This effect, observed in the presence of adsorbed hydrogen atoms, suggests that small hydrogen additions can significantly boost process efficiency and performance by favoring desired reactions over coke-producing pathways. Hydrogen cofeeding in PDH suppresses coke formation, maintaining catalyst activity and preventing deactivation \[10.1006/jcat.1996.0361\]. It prevents the formation of coke precursors, crucial for sustaining catalytic activity. Hydrogen can remove reversible coke through hydrogenation, enhancing process efficiency. However, it does not remove already formed coke, highlighting its preventive rather than remedial role.

                    Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: The comprehensive effects of hydrogen cofeeding on coke formation, catalyst stability, and reaction dynamics in the propane dehydrogenation (PDH) process reveal a multifaceted mechanism that significantly enhances process efficiency and performance. Hydrogen cofeeding's ability to suppress coke formation, akin to water vapor's effect, by maintaining a reducing atmosphere and preventing coke precursor formation, is a critical factor in improving catalyst stability and efficiency. The literature suggests that hydrogen cofeeding can significantly reduce coke formation on catalysts by hydrogenating coke precursor species, thereby enhancing alkene formation while maintaining high alkene selectivity. The presence of Ga in the catalyst further suppresses coke formation, and the optimal hydrogen-to-propane ratio can influence propene selectivity. The alteration of coke deposits into smaller, less defective graphite crystallites by hydrogen cofeeding enhances catalyst stability, conversion, and selectivity, particularly on Pt-Sn/Al2O3 catalysts. The competitive adsorption of hydrogen on the catalyst surface reduces carbon species' surface coverage, decreasing polymerization and coke formation. The raising of energy barriers for undesired cleavage steps by hydrogen cofeeding improves selectivity towards alkene formation, suggesting that small hydrogen additions can significantly boost process efficiency and performance. Hydrogen cofeeding's role in maintaining catalyst activity and preventing deactivation by preventing the formation of coke precursors is crucial for sustaining catalytic activity. The preventive rather than remedial role of hydrogen cofeeding in coke management highlights the importance of early intervention in coke formation. Future research endeavors might focus on optimizing hydrogen cofeeding strategies to further enhance catalyst stability and efficiency, exploring the synergistic effects of hydrogen cofeeding with other additives like Sn and Ga, and investigating the impact of hydrogen cofeeding on the energy barriers, coke accumulation patterns, acid site conversions, and graphitization in PDH processes. The development of advanced catalysts that can effectively utilize hydrogen cofeeding to suppress coke formation and enhance alkene selectivity while maintaining high conversion rates and stability will be a key area of investigation. Additionally, the integration of hydrogen cofeeding with other process optimization techniques, such as temperature and pressure control, could lead to significant improvements in PDH process efficiency and performance.
