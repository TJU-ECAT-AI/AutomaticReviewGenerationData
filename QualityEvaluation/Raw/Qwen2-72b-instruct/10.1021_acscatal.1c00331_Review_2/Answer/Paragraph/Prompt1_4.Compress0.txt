However, it does mention that adding hydrogen to the feed increases the rate of alkene formation due to enhanced hydrogen-assisted dehydrogenation of surface alkyl species. The literature also notes that hydrogen addition to the feed has relatively little effect on alkene selectivity, which remains near 100%. The presence of hydrogen is crucial in reducing the amount of coke formed on the catalysts, via the hydrogenation of coke precursor species. The effects of hydrogen addition on the rate of propene formation are qualitatively similar to those seen for ethene formation, but the maximum in propene formation occurs at a different hydrogen-to-propane ratio than the maximum in ethene formation. The hydrogen-to-propane ratio has a somewhat larger effect on the selectivity to propene than on the selectivity to ethene produced by ethane dehydrogenation, but the propene selectivity still remains above 95.5% even at the highest hydrogen-to-propane ratio. The presence of Ga in the catalyst suppresses coke formation. The literature does not discuss the impact of hydrogen cofeeding on energy barriers, coke accumulation patterns, acid site conversions, graphitization, or the implications of these effects on overall process efficiency and performance. As the concentration of alkene in the product approaches the equilibrium concentration, the rate of alkene formation approaches that expected for equilibrium conversion of the alkane and the rate of alkene formation decreases with increasing H2/alkane ratio. The loss in activity of Pt/Mg(Ga)(Al)O with time on stream is smaller for ethane than propane dehydrogenation. Coke accumulation with time on stream is greater for ethane than propane dehydrogenation, and the moles of carbon deposited on the catalyst are many times higher than the moles of exposed Pt atoms. The lower coke formation during propane dehydrogenation compared to ethane dehydrogenation is attributed to the greater ease of hydrogenation of propyli- dyne compared to ethylidyne.", "Doi": "10.1016/j.jcat.2010.06.016"},

Hydrogen can suppress the formation of coke precursors and reduce the rate of catalyst deactivation. However, hydrogen cannot remove the coke that has already been formed on the catalyst. The addition of hydrogen in the feed greatly suppresses coke formation, and the decrease in the total amount of coke is mainly due to the decrease of the area of Peak II, which corresponds to the coke formed on the support. The shift of Peak II to lower temperature as the partial pressure of hydrogen increases indicates that hydrogen promotes the formation of softer coke on the support. The apparent reaction order of coking on the support is about first order with respect to propylene, 0.7 order with respect to hydrogen, and 1.4 order with respect to propane.

Hydrogen alters the nature of the coke deposits formed during propane dehydrogenation, leading to the formation of smaller graphite crystallites with less defects. The addition of hydrogen to the feed either increases the amount of defects in the graphitic lattice or decreases the size of the graphitic crystallites. The increase in propane dehydrogenation conversion observed with increasing hydrogen concentration is related to the decreased deposition of coke. Initially, active sites are inhibited by coke, but sintering of the supported Pt nanoparticles may permanently inhibit these sites. The experiments with propane concentrations of 25 and 50% show a strong increase in selectivity for each consecutive cycle. For these specific experiments, less coke of a more graphitic nature is detected, suggesting a link between the presence of relatively disordered coke deposits and side reactions, such as cracking. In the presence of high concentrations of hydrogen, more graphitic coke is formed that mainly covers the catalyst support. In the absence of hydrogen, more disordered coke is formed, also present on the supported Pt nanoparticles. Hydrogen assists in keeping the surface of the Pt free of these disordered coke species. These effects of hydrogen on coke formation, catalyst stability, and reaction mechanisms have implications for the overall process efficiency and performance, as they can lead to increased conversion and selectivity, reduced catalyst deactivation, and improved stability.", "Doi": "10.1039/c3cp50646k"},

Hydrogen can suppress the formation of coke precursors and reduce the rate of catalyst deactivation. However, hydrogen cannot remove the coke that has already been formed on the catalyst. The addition of hydrogen in the feed greatly suppresses coke formation, and the decrease in the total amount of coke is mainly due to the decrease of the area of Peak II, which corresponds to the coke formed on the support.

The acidity of the support is weakened in a hydrogen atmosphere, converting Lewis acid sites to Brnsted acid sites, which helps to reduce the rate of coking on the support. However, the graphitization of coke is positively correlated with hydrogen partial pressure, implying that it becomes more difficult to remove coke under hydrogen feeding because the highly ordered graphitic coke requires higher temperatures for combustion. These effects of hydrogen cofeeding have implications for the overall process efficiency and performance, as they can lead to longer catalyst lifetimes and potentially higher propylene yields.", "Doi": "10.1021/acscatal.1c00331_2"},

Hydrogen can suppress the formation of coke precursors and reduce the rate of catalyst deactivation. However, hydrogen cannot remove the coke that has already been formed on the catalyst. The addition of hydrogen in the feed greatly suppresses coke formation, and the decrease in the total amount of coke is mainly due to the decrease of the area of Peak II, which corresponds to the coke formed on the support. The shift of Peak II to lower temperature as the partial pressure of hydrogen increases indicates that hydrogen promotes the formation of softer coke on the support. The apparent reaction order of coking on the support is about first order with respect to propylene, 0.7 order with respect to hydrogen, and 1.4 order with respect to propane. This suggests that coke can be formed both from propane and propylene, but with different reaction mechanisms.

Hydrogen can suppress the formation of coke precursors and reduce the rate of catalyst deactivation. However, hydrogen cannot remove the coke that has already been formed on the catalyst. The addition of hydrogen in the feed greatly suppresses coke formation, and the decrease in the total amount of coke is mainly due to the decrease of the area of Peak II, which corresponds to the coke formed on the support.

The acidity of the support is weakened in a hydrogen atmosphere, converting Lewis acid sites to Brnsted acid sites, which helps to reduce the rate of coking on the support. However, the graphitization of coke is positively correlated with hydrogen partial pressure, implying that it becomes more difficult to remove coke under hydrogen feeding because the highly ordered graphitic coke requires higher temperatures for combustion. These effects of hydrogen cofeeding have implications for the overall process efficiency and performance, as they can lead to longer catalyst lifetimes and potentially higher propylene yields.", "Doi": "10.1021/acscatal.1c00331_2"},

The presence of hydrogen reduces the rate of coke formation on the support by decreasing the propylene and propane pressures. Hydrogen can suppress the formation of coke precursors and reduce the rate of catalyst deactivation. However, hydrogen cannot remove the coke that has already been formed on the catalyst. The addition of hydrogen in the feed greatly suppresses coke formation, and the decrease in the total amount of coke is mainly due to the decrease of the area of Peak II, which corresponds to the coke formed on the support. The shift of Peak II to lower temperature as the partial pressure of hydrogen increases indicates that hydrogen promotes the formation of softer coke on the support. The apparent reaction order of coking on the support is about first order with respect to propylene, 0.7 order with respect to hydrogen, and 1.4 order with respect to propane. This suggests that coke can be formed both from propane and propylene, but with different reaction mechanisms. The presence of hydrogen will weaken the acidity of the support by converting Brnsted acid sites to Lewis acid sites and thus reduce the coke formation rate. Hydrogen cofeeding affects coke formation and catalyst stability by decreasing the rate of coke formation on the support, while having a weak effect on the rate of coke formation on the metal.

{"Quotes": "", "English": "The literature does not provide specific information on how hydrogen cofeeding affects coke formation, catalyst stability, and reaction mechanisms in propane dehydrogenation. However, it does mention that adding hydrogen to the feed increases the rate of alkene formation due to enhanced hydrogen-assisted dehydrogenation of surface alkyl species. The literature also notes that hydrogen addition to the feed has relatively little effect on alkene selectivity, which remains near 100%. The presence of hydrogen is crucial in reducing the amount of coke formed on the catalysts, via the hydrogenation of coke precursor species. The effects of hydrogen addition on the rate of propene formation are qualitatively similar to those seen for ethene formation, but the maximum in propene formation occurs at a different hydrogen-to-propane ratio than the maximum in ethene formation. The hydrogen-to-propane ratio has a somewhat larger effect on the selectivity to propene than on the selectivity to ethene produced by ethane dehydrogenation, but the propene selectivity still remains above 95.5% even at the highest hydrogen-to-propane ratio. The presence of Ga in the catalyst suppresses coke formation. The literature does not discuss the impact of hydrogen cofeeding on energy barriers, coke accumulation patterns, acid site conversions, graphitization, or the implications of these effects on overall process efficiency and performance. As the concentration of alkene in the product approaches the equilibrium concentration, the rate of alkene formation approaches that expected for equilibrium conversion of the alkane and the rate of alkene formation decreases with increasing H2/alkane ratio. The loss in activity of Pt/Mg(Ga)(Al)O with time on stream is smaller for ethane than propane dehydrogenation. Coke accumulation with time on stream is greater for ethane than propane dehydrogenation, and the moles of carbon deposited on the catalyst are many times higher than the moles of exposed Pt atoms. The lower coke formation during propane dehydrogenation compared to ethane dehydrogenation is attributed to the greater ease of hydrogenation of propyli- dyne compared to ethylidyne.", "Doi": "10.1016/j.jcat.2010.06.016"},
