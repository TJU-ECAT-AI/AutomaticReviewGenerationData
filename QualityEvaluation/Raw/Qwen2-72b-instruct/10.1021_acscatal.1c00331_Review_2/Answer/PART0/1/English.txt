The literature does not provide specific information on how hydrogen cofeeding affects coke formation, catalyst stability, and reaction mechanisms in the propane dehydrogenation process. However, it does mention that the addition of water vapor can suppress the formation of coke during propane dehydrogenation at high temperatures. This suggests that hydrogen cofeeding, which often accompanies water vapor in steam reforming processes, may also contribute to coke suppression, improve catalyst stability by maintaining a reducing atmosphere that prevents the formation of coke precursors, and play a role in suppressing coke formation. The literature does not discuss the impact of hydrogen cofeeding on energy barriers, coke accumulation patterns, acid site conversions, or graphitization. However, the suppression of coke formation by water vapor implies that hydrogen cofeeding could have similar effects, leading to improved process efficiency and performance by reducing catalyst deactivation and regeneration requirements. The implications of these effects on the overall process efficiency and performance are not explicitly discussed, but it can be inferred that reducing coke formation would improve catalyst stability and prolong the life of the catalyst, leading to better process efficiency and performance.

The literature does not provide specific information on how hydrogen cofeeding affects coke formation, catalyst stability, and reaction mechanisms in propane dehydrogenation. However, it does mention that adding hydrogen to the feed increases the rate of alkene formation due to enhanced hydrogen-assisted dehydrogenation of surface alkyl species. The literature also notes that hydrogen addition to the feed has relatively little effect on alkene selectivity, which remains near 100%. The presence of hydrogen is crucial in reducing the amount of coke formed on the catalysts, via the hydrogenation of coke precursor species. The effects of hydrogen addition on the rate of propene formation are qualitatively similar to those seen for ethene formation, but the maximum in propene formation occurs at a different hydrogen-to-propane ratio than the maximum in ethene formation. The hydrogen-to-propane ratio has a somewhat larger effect on the selectivity to propene than on the selectivity to ethene produced by ethane dehydrogenation, but the propene selectivity still remains above 95.5% even at the highest hydrogen-to-propane ratio. The presence of Ga in the catalyst suppresses coke formation. The literature does not discuss the impact of hydrogen cofeeding on energy barriers, coke accumulation patterns, acid site conversions, graphitization, or the implications of these effects on overall process efficiency and performance. As the concentration of alkene in the product approaches the equilibrium concentration, the rate of alkene formation approaches that expected for equilibrium conversion of the alkane and the rate of alkene formation decreases with increasing H2/alkane ratio. The loss in activity of Pt/Mg(Ga)(Al)O with time on stream is smaller for ethane than propane dehydrogenation. Coke accumulation with time on stream is greater for ethane than propane dehydrogenation, and the moles of carbon deposited on the catalyst are many times higher than the moles of exposed Pt atoms. The lower coke formation during propane dehydrogenation compared to ethane dehydrogenation is attributed to the greater ease of hydrogenation of propyli- dyne compared to ethylidyne.

Hydrogen cofeeding in the propane dehydrogenation (PDH) process has a positive effect on the catalyst performance, comparable to the addition of Sn, which increases both propane conversion and propene selectivity. Hydrogen alters the nature of the coke deposits formed during propane dehydrogenation, leading to the formation of smaller graphite crystallites with fewer defects. This is due to hydrogen's ability to suppress coke formation on Pt-based catalysts by competitive adsorption on the catalyst surface, reducing the surface coverage of adsorbed carbon species. As the concentration of these species is reduced, they are less likely to polymerize and form coke. Hydrogen increases catalyst stability, conversion, and selectivity on the Pt-Sn/Al2O3 catalyst, with a propane concentration of 75% providing the optimal performance. The apparent shift in the position of the D Raman band is not yet understood. The narrowing of the Raman bands indicates a higher ordered carbon structure with fewer defects on the catalyst. The addition of H2 to the feed either increases the amount of defects in the graphitic lattice or decreases the size of the graphitic crystallites. The increase in propane dehydrogenation conversion observed with increasing H2 concentration is related to the decreased deposition of coke, which was detected by operando Raman spectroscopy. Initially, these sites are inhibited by coke, but sintering of the supported Pt nanoparticles may inhibit these sites permanently. The experiments with propane concentrations of 25 and 50% show a strong increase in selectivity for each consecutive cycle. For these specific experiments, less coke of a more graphitic nature is detected by operando Raman spectroscopy, suggesting a link between the presence of relatively disordered coke deposits and side reactions, such as cracking. These effects of hydrogen cofeeding on coke formation, catalyst stability, and reaction mechanisms have implications for the overall process efficiency and performance, as they can lead to improved conversion and selectivity, reduced catalyst deactivation, and potentially longer catalyst lifetimes. Hydrogen cofeeding in the propane dehydrogenation (PDH) process affects coke formation by decreasing the formation of coke deposits and altering the nature of the coke deposits formed during propane dehydrogenation. It increases the catalyst performance and stability, conversion and selectivity on the Pt-Sn/Al2O3 catalyst. The addition of hydrogen leads to smaller, more ordered graphite crystallites, while less coke is formed in the presence of hydrogen. The conversion and selectivity increases when hydrogen is added. Hydrogen assists in keeping the active sites for dehydrogenation free of coke deposits.

The increase in propane dehydrogenation conversion observed with increasing hydrogen concentration is related to the decreased deposition of coke, which was detected by operando Raman spectroscopy.

For these specific experiments, less coke of a more graphitic nature is detected by operando Raman spectroscopy, suggesting a link between the presence of relatively disordered coke deposits and side reactions, such as cracking.

The co-feeding of hydrogen in the propane dehydrogenation (PDH) process is advantageous as it reduces the rate of coke formation. The presence of an adsorbed hydrogen atom on the cluster facilitates the desorption of alkenes relative to the dehydrogenation of the adsorbed alkene. Hydrogen raises the energy of the third and undesired cleavage step to a greater extent than the first two steps, which could improve the selectivity of the reaction towards the formation of alkenes. This suggests that the addition of small amounts of hydrogen gas could enhance the selectivity of the reaction towards the formation of alkenes, thereby improving the overall process efficiency and performance.

Hydrogen cofeeding in the propane dehydrogenation (PDH) process suppresses the formation of coke, maintaining the activity of the catalyst and preventing deactivation. However, it does not remove coke that has already formed on the catalyst. Hydrogen's role in suppressing coke formation is attributed to its ability to prevent the formation of coke precursors. This effect is crucial for maintaining the catalytic activity during the reaction. Hydrogen can remove reversible coke through hydrogenation, which helps in maintaining the overall process efficiency and performance. The implications of these effects are that hydrogen cofeeding can significantly enhance the stability and efficiency of the PDH process by reducing coke formation and maintaining catalyst activity.

Hydrogen cofeeding in the propane dehydrogenation (PDH) process has a significant impact on coke formation, catalyst stability, and reaction mechanisms. Hydrogen decreases the rate of coke formation and enhances catalyst stability by removing the precursor of coke. Computational simulations have confirmed that hydrogen adsorption on the Pt surface increases the energy barrier for propylene dehydrogenation, preventing deep reactions that lead to coke formation. For a conventional PtSn/Al2O3 catalyst, hydrogen cofeeding reduces coke formation primarily by decreasing coke accumulation on the support, while the amount of coke on the metal remains relatively unchanged. The acidity of the support is weakened in a hydrogen atmosphere, converting Lewis acid sites to Brnsted acid sites, which helps to reduce the rate of coking on the support. However, the graphitization of coke is positively correlated with hydrogen partial pressure, implying that it becomes more difficult to remove coke under hydrogen feeding because the highly ordered graphitic coke requires higher temperatures for combustion. These effects of hydrogen cofeeding have implications for the overall process efficiency and performance, as they can lead to longer catalyst lifetimes and potentially higher propylene yields.

Hydrogen cofeeding in the propane dehydrogenation (PDH) process affects coke formation by decreasing the rate of coke formation on the support, while having a weak effect on the rate of coke formation on the metal. The presence of hydrogen reduces the rate of coke formation on the support by decreasing the propylene and propane pressures. Hydrogen can suppress the formation of coke precursors and reduce the rate of catalyst deactivation. However, hydrogen cannot remove the coke that has already been formed on the catalyst. The addition of hydrogen in the feed greatly suppresses coke formation, and the decrease in the total amount of coke is mainly due to the decrease of the area of Peak II, which corresponds to the coke formed on the support. The shift of Peak II to lower temperature as the partial pressure of hydrogen increases indicates that hydrogen promotes the formation of softer coke on the support. The apparent reaction order of coking on the support is about first order with respect to propylene, 0.7 order with respect to hydrogen, and 1.4 order with respect to propane. This suggests that coke can be formed both from propane and propylene, but with different reaction mechanisms. The presence of hydrogen will weaken the acidity of the support by converting Brnsted acid sites to Lewis acid sites and thus reduce the coke formation rate. Hydrogen cofeeding affects coke formation and catalyst stability by decreasing the rate of coke formation on the support, while having a weak effect on the rate of coke formation on the metal. The presence of hydrogen weakens the acidity of the support, reducing the formation of hard coke. However, hydrogen does not significantly affect the formation of soft coke on the metal. The reaction mechanisms are influenced by hydrogen, as it can suppress the formation of coke precursors and reduce the molecular weight of polymers during propylene polymerization.

The presence of hydrogen will weaken the acidity of the support by converting Brnsted acid sites to Lewis acid sites and thus reduce the coke formation rate. Hydrogen cofeeding affects coke formation and catalyst stability by decreasing the rate of coke formation on the support, while having a weak effect on the rate of coke formation on the metal. The presence of hydrogen weakens the acidity of the support, reducing the formation of hard coke. However, hydrogen does not significantly affect the formation of soft coke on the metal. The reaction mechanisms are influenced by hydrogen, as it can suppress the formation of coke precursors and reduce the molecular weight of polymers during propylene polymerization.

The literature does not provide specific information on how hydrogen cofeeding affects coke formation, catalyst stability, and reaction mechanisms in the propane dehydrogenation process. However, it does mention that the addition of water vapor can suppress the formation of coke during propane dehydrogenation at high temperatures. This suggests that hydrogen cofeeding, which often accompanies water vapor in steam reforming processes, may also contribute to coke suppression, improve catalyst stability by maintaining a reducing atmosphere that prevents the formation of coke precursors, and play a role in suppressing coke formation. The literature does not discuss the impact of hydrogen cofeeding on energy barriers, coke accumulation patterns, acid site conversions, or graphitization. However, the suppression of coke formation by water vapor implies that hydrogen cofeeding could have similar effects, leading to improved process efficiency and performance by reducing catalyst deactivation and regeneration requirements. The implications of these effects on the overall process efficiency and performance are not explicitly discussed, but it can be inferred that reducing coke formation would improve catalyst stability and prolong the life of the catalyst, leading to better process efficiency and performance.

The literature does not provide specific information on how hydrogen cofeeding affects coke formation, catalyst stability, and reaction mechanisms in propane dehydrogenation. However, it does mention that adding hydrogen to the feed increases the rate of alkene formation due to enhanced hydrogen-assisted dehydrogenation of surface alkyl species. The literature also notes that hydrogen addition to the feed has relatively little effect on alkene selectivity, which remains near 100%. The presence of hydrogen is crucial in reducing the amount of coke formed on the catalysts, via the hydrogenation of coke precursor species. The effects of hydrogen addition on the rate of propene formation are qualitatively similar to those seen for ethene formation, but the maximum in propene formation occurs at a different hydrogen-to-propane ratio than the maximum in ethene formation. The hydrogen-to-propane ratio has a somewhat larger effect on the selectivity to propene than on the selectivity to ethene produced by ethane dehydrogenation, but the propene selectivity still remains above 95.5% even at the highest hydrogen-to-propane ratio. The presence of Ga in the catalyst suppresses coke formation. The literature does not discuss the impact of hydrogen cofeeding on energy barriers, coke accumulation patterns, acid site conversions, graphitization, or the implications of these effects on overall process efficiency and performance. As the concentration of alkene in the product approaches the equilibrium concentration, the rate of alkene formation approaches that expected for equilibrium conversion of the alkane and the rate of alkene formation decreases with increasing H2/alkane ratio. The loss in activity of Pt/Mg(Ga)(Al)O with time on stream is smaller for ethane than propane dehydrogenation. Coke accumulation with time on stream is greater for ethane than propane dehydrogenation, and the moles of carbon deposited on the catalyst are many times higher than the moles of exposed Pt atoms. The lower coke formation during propane dehydrogenation compared to ethane dehydrogenation is attributed to the greater ease of hydrogenation of propyli- dyne compared to ethylidyne.

Hydrogen cofeeding in the propane dehydrogenation (PDH) process has a positive effect on the catalyst performance, comparable to the addition of Sn, which increases both propane conversion and propene selectivity. Hydrogen alters the nature of the coke deposits formed during propane dehydrogenation, leading to the formation of smaller graphite crystallites with fewer defects. This is due to hydrogen's ability to suppress coke formation on Pt-based catalysts by competitive adsorption on the catalyst surface, reducing the surface coverage of adsorbed carbon species. As the concentration of these species is reduced, they are less likely to polymerize and form coke. Hydrogen increases catalyst stability, conversion, and selectivity on the Pt-Sn/Al2O3 catalyst, with a propane concentration of 75% providing the optimal performance. The apparent shift in the position of the D Raman band is not yet understood. The narrowing of the Raman bands indicates a higher ordered carbon structure with fewer defects on the catalyst. The addition of H2 to the feed either increases the amount of defects in the graphitic lattice or decreases the size of the graphitic crystallites. The increase in propane dehydrogenation conversion observed with increasing H2 concentration is related to the decreased deposition of coke, which was detected by operando Raman spectroscopy. Initially, these sites are inhibited by coke, but sintering of the supported Pt nanoparticles may inhibit these sites permanently. The experiments with propane concentrations of 25 and 50% show a strong increase in selectivity for each consecutive cycle. For these specific experiments, less coke of a more graphitic nature is detected by operando Raman spectroscopy, suggesting a link between the presence of relatively disordered coke deposits and side reactions, such as cracking. These effects of hydrogen cofeeding on coke formation, catalyst stability, and reaction mechanisms have implications for the overall process efficiency and performance, as they can lead to improved conversion and selectivity, reduced catalyst deactivation, and potentially longer catalyst lifetimes. Hydrogen cofeeding in the propane dehydrogenation (PDH) process affects coke formation by decreasing the formation of coke deposits and altering the nature of the coke deposits formed during propane dehydrogenation. It increases the catalyst performance and stability, conversion and selectivity on the Pt-Sn/Al2O3 catalyst. The addition of hydrogen leads to smaller, more ordered graphite crystallites, while less coke is formed in the presence of hydrogen. The conversion and selectivity increases when hydrogen is added. Hydrogen assists in keeping the active sites for dehydrogenation free of coke deposits.

The increase in propane dehydrogenation conversion observed with increasing hydrogen concentration is related to the decreased deposition of coke, which was detected by operando Raman spectroscopy.

The co-feeding of hydrogen in the propane dehydrogenation (PDH) process is advantageous as it reduces the rate of coke formation. The presence of an adsorbed hydrogen atom on the cluster facilitates the desorption of alkenes relative to the dehydrogenation of the adsorbed alkene. Hydrogen raises the energy of the third and undesired cleavage step to a greater extent than the first two steps, which could improve the selectivity of the reaction towards the formation of alkenes. This suggests that the addition of small amounts of hydrogen gas could enhance the selectivity of the reaction towards the formation of alkenes, thereby improving the overall process efficiency and performance.

Hydrogen cofeeding in the propane dehydrogenation (PDH) process suppresses the formation of coke, maintaining the activity of the catalyst and preventing deactivation. However, it does not remove coke that has already formed on the catalyst. Hydrogen's role in suppressing coke formation is attributed to its ability to prevent the formation of coke precursors. This effect is crucial for maintaining the catalytic activity during the reaction. Hydrogen can remove reversible coke through hydrogenation, which helps in maintaining the overall process efficiency and performance. The implications of these effects are that hydrogen cofeeding can significantly enhance the stability and efficiency of the PDH process by reducing coke formation and maintaining catalyst activity.

Hydrogen cofeeding in the propane dehydrogenation (PDH) process has a significant impact on coke formation, catalyst stability, and reaction mechanisms. Hydrogen decreases the rate of coke formation and enhances catalyst stability by removing the precursor of coke. Computational simulations have confirmed that hydrogen adsorption on the Pt surface increases the energy barrier for propylene dehydrogenation, preventing deep reactions that lead to coke formation. For a conventional PtSn/Al2O3 catalyst, hydrogen cofeeding reduces coke formation primarily by decreasing coke accumulation on the support, while the amount of coke on the metal remains relatively unchanged. The acidity of the support is weakened in a hydrogen atmosphere, converting Lewis acid sites to Brnsted acid sites, which helps to reduce the rate of coking on the support. However, the graphitization of coke is positively correlated with hydrogen partial pressure, implying that it becomes more difficult to remove coke under hydrogen feeding because the highly ordered graphitic coke requires higher temperatures for combustion. These effects of hydrogen cofeeding have implications for the overall process efficiency and performance, as they can lead to longer catalyst lifetimes and potentially higher propylene yields.

Hydrogen cofeeding in the propane dehydrogenation (PDH) process affects coke formation by decreasing the rate of coke formation on the support, while having a weak effect on the rate of coke formation on the metal. The presence of hydrogen reduces the rate of coke formation on the support by decreasing the propylene and propane pressures. Hydrogen can suppress the formation of coke precursors and reduce the rate of catalyst deactivation. However, hydrogen cannot remove the coke that has already been formed on the catalyst. The addition of hydrogen in the feed greatly suppresses coke formation, and the decrease in the total amount of coke is mainly due to the decrease of the area of Peak II, which corresponds to the coke formed on the support. The shift of Peak II to lower temperature as the partial pressure of hydrogen increases indicates that hydrogen promotes the formation of softer coke on the support. The apparent reaction order of coking on the support is about first order with respect to propylene, 0.7 order with respect to hydrogen, and 1.4 order with respect to propane.

The presence of hydrogen reduces the rate of coke formation on the support by decreasing the propylene and propane pressures. Hydrogen can suppress the formation of coke precursors and reduce the rate of catalyst deactivation. However, hydrogen cannot remove the coke that has already been formed on the catalyst. The addition of hydrogen in the feed greatly suppresses coke formation, and the decrease in the total amount of coke is mainly due to the decrease of the area of Peak II, which corresponds to the coke formed on the support. The shift of Peak II to lower temperature as the partial pressure of hydrogen increases indicates that hydrogen promotes the formation of softer coke on the support. The apparent reaction order of coking on the support is about first order with respect to propylene, 0.7 order with respect to hydrogen, and 1.4 order with respect to propane. This suggests that coke can be formed both from propane and propylene, but with different reaction mechanisms. The presence of hydrogen will weaken the acidity of the support by converting Brnsted acid sites to Lewis acid sites and thus reduce the coke formation rate. Hydrogen cofeeding affects coke formation and catalyst stability by decreasing the rate of coke formation on the support, while having a weak effect on the rate of coke formation on the metal. The presence of hydrogen weakens the acidity of the support, reducing the formation of hard coke. However, hydrogen does not significantly affect the formation of soft coke on the metal. The reaction mechanisms are influenced by hydrogen, as it can suppress the formation of coke precursors and reduce the molecular weight of polymers during propylene polymerization.

The literature does not provide specific information on how hydrogen cofeeding affects coke formation, catalyst stability, and reaction mechanisms in the propane dehydrogenation process. However, it does mention that the addition of water vapor can suppress the formation of coke during propane dehydrogenation at high temperatures. This suggests that hydrogen cofeeding, which often accompanies water vapor in steam reforming processes, may also contribute to coke suppression, improve catalyst stability by maintaining a reducing atmosphere that prevents the formation of coke precursors, and play a role in suppressing coke formation. The literature does not discuss the impact of hydrogen cofeeding on energy barriers, coke accumulation patterns, acid site conversions, or graphitization. However, the suppression of coke formation by water vapor implies that hydrogen cofeeding could have similar effects, leading to improved process efficiency and performance by reducing catalyst deactivation and regeneration requirements. The implications of these effects on the overall process efficiency and performance are not explicitly discussed, but it can be inferred that reducing coke formation would improve catalyst stability and prolong the life of the catalyst, leading to better process efficiency and performance.

The literature does not provide specific information on how hydrogen cofeeding affects coke formation, catalyst stability, and reaction mechanisms in propane dehydrogenation. However, it does mention that adding hydrogen to the feed increases the rate of alkene formation due to enhanced hydrogen-assisted dehydrogenation of surface alkyl species. The literature also notes that hydrogen addition to the feed has relatively little effect on alkene selectivity, which remains near 100%. The presence of hydrogen is crucial in reducing the amount of coke formed on the catalysts, via the hydrogenation of coke precursor species. The effects of hydrogen addition on the rate of propene formation are qualitatively similar to those seen for ethene formation, but the maximum in propene formation occurs at a different hydrogen-to-propane ratio than the maximum in ethene formation. The hydrogen-to-propane ratio has a somewhat larger effect on the selectivity to propene than on the selectivity to ethene produced by ethane dehydrogenation, but the propene selectivity still remains above 95.5% even at the highest hydrogen-to-propane ratio. The presence of Ga in the catalyst suppresses coke formation. The literature does not discuss the impact of hydrogen cofeeding on energy barriers, coke accumulation patterns, acid site conversions, graphitization, or the implications of these effects on overall process efficiency and performance. As the concentration of alkene in the product approaches the equilibrium concentration, the rate of alkene formation approaches that expected for equilibrium conversion of the alkane and the rate of alkene formation decreases with increasing H2/alkane ratio. The loss in activity of Pt/Mg(Ga)(Al)O with time on stream is smaller for ethane than propane dehydrogenation. Coke accumulation with time on stream is greater for ethane than propane dehydrogenation, and the moles of carbon deposited on the catalyst are many times higher than the moles of exposed Pt atoms. The lower coke formation during propane dehydrogenation compared to ethane dehydrogenation is attributed to the greater ease of hydrogenation of propyli- dyne compared to ethylidyne.

Hydrogen cofeeding in the propane dehydrogenation (PDH) process has a positive effect on the catalyst performance, comparable to the addition of Sn, which increases both propane conversion and propene selectivity. Hydrogen alters the nature of the coke deposits formed during propane dehydrogenation, leading to the formation of smaller graphite crystallites with fewer defects. This is due to hydrogen's ability to suppress coke formation on Pt-based catalysts by competitive adsorption on the catalyst surface, reducing the surface coverage of adsorbed carbon species. As the concentration of these species is reduced, they are less likely to polymerize and form coke. Hydrogen increases catalyst stability, conversion, and selectivity on the Pt-Sn/Al2O3 catalyst, with a propane concentration of 75% providing the optimal performance. The apparent shift in the position of the D Raman band is not yet understood. The narrowing of the Raman bands indicates a higher ordered carbon structure with fewer defects on the catalyst. The addition of H2 to the feed either increases the amount of defects in the graphitic lattice or decreases the size of the graphitic crystallites. The increase in propane dehydrogenation conversion observed with increasing H2 concentration is related to the decreased deposition of coke, which was detected by operando Raman spectroscopy. Initially, these sites are inhibited by coke, but sintering of the supported Pt nanoparticles may inhibit these sites permanently. The experiments with propane concentrations of 25 and 50% show a strong increase in selectivity for each consecutive cycle. For these specific experiments, less coke of a more graphitic nature is detected by operando Raman spectroscopy, suggesting a link between the presence of relatively disordered coke deposits and side reactions, such as cracking.

It increases the catalyst performance and stability, conversion and selectivity on the Pt-Sn/Al2O3 catalyst. The addition of hydrogen leads to smaller, more ordered graphite crystallites, while less coke is formed in the presence of hydrogen. The conversion and selectivity increases when hydrogen is added.

The increase in propane dehydrogenation conversion observed with increasing hydrogen concentration is related to the decreased deposition of coke, which was detected by operando Raman spectroscopy.

The co-feeding of hydrogen in the propane dehydrogenation (PDH) process is advantageous as it reduces the rate of coke formation. The presence of an adsorbed hydrogen atom on the cluster facilitates the desorption of alkenes relative to the dehydrogenation of the adsorbed alkene. Hydrogen raises the energy of the third and undesired cleavage step to a greater extent than the first two steps, which could improve the selectivity of the reaction towards the formation of alkenes. This suggests that the addition of small amounts of hydrogen gas could enhance the selectivity of the reaction towards the formation of alkenes, thereby improving the overall process efficiency and performance.

Hydrogen cofeeding in the propane dehydrogenation (PDH) process suppresses the formation of coke, maintaining the activity of the catalyst and preventing deactivation. However, it does not remove coke that has already formed on the catalyst. Hydrogen's role in suppressing coke formation is attributed to its ability to prevent the formation of coke precursors. This effect is crucial for maintaining the catalytic activity during the reaction. Hydrogen can remove reversible coke through hydrogenation, which helps in maintaining the overall process efficiency and performance. The implications of these effects are that hydrogen cofeeding can significantly enhance the stability and efficiency of the PDH process by reducing coke formation and maintaining catalyst activity.

Hydrogen cofeeding in the propane dehydrogenation (PDH) process has a significant impact on coke formation, catalyst stability, and reaction mechanisms. Hydrogen decreases the rate of coke formation and enhances catalyst stability by removing the precursor of coke. Computational simulations have confirmed that hydrogen adsorption on the Pt surface increases the energy barrier for propylene dehydrogenation, preventing deep reactions that lead to coke formation. For a conventional PtSn/Al2O3 catalyst, hydrogen cofeeding reduces coke formation primarily by decreasing coke accumulation on the support, while the amount of coke on the metal remains relatively unchanged. The acidity of the support is weakened in a hydrogen atmosphere, converting Lewis acid sites to Brnsted acid sites, which helps to reduce the rate of coking on the support. However, the graphitization of coke is positively correlated with hydrogen partial pressure, implying that it becomes more difficult to remove coke under hydrogen feeding because the highly ordered graphitic coke requires higher temperatures for combustion. These effects of hydrogen cofeeding have implications for the overall process efficiency and performance, as they can lead to longer catalyst lifetimes and potentially higher propylene yields.

For a conventional PtSn/Al2O3 catalyst, hydrogen cofeeding reduces coke formation primarily by decreasing coke accumulation on the support, while the amount of coke on the metal remains relatively unchanged. The acidity of the support is weakened in a hydrogen atmosphere, converting Lewis acid sites to Brnsted acid sites, which helps to reduce the rate of coking on the support. However, the graphitization of coke is positively correlated with hydrogen partial pressure, implying that it becomes more difficult to remove coke under hydrogen feeding because the highly ordered graphitic coke requires higher temperatures for combustion. These effects of hydrogen cofeeding have implications for the overall process efficiency and performance, as they can lead to longer catalyst lifetimes and potentially higher propylene yields.

Hydrogen cofeeding in the propane dehydrogenation (PDH) process affects coke formation by decreasing the rate of coke formation on the support, while having a weak effect on the rate of coke formation on the metal. The presence of hydrogen reduces the rate of coke formation on the support by decreasing the propylene and propane pressures. Hydrogen can suppress the formation of coke precursors and reduce the rate of catalyst deactivation. However, hydrogen cannot remove the coke that has already been formed on the catalyst. The addition of hydrogen in the feed greatly suppresses coke formation, and the decrease in the total amount of coke is mainly due to the decrease of the area of Peak II, which corresponds to the coke formed on the support. The shift of Peak II to lower temperature as the partial pressure of hydrogen increases indicates that hydrogen promotes the formation of softer coke on the support. The apparent reaction order of coking on the support is about first order with respect to propylene, 0.7 order with respect to hydrogen, and 1.4 order with respect to propane. This suggests that coke can be formed both from propane and propylene, but with different reaction mechanisms. The presence of hydrogen will weaken the acidity of the support by converting Brnsted acid sites to Lewis acid sites and thus reduce the coke formation rate. Hydrogen cofeeding affects coke formation and catalyst stability by decreasing the rate of coke formation on the support, while having a weak effect on the rate of coke formation on the metal. The presence of hydrogen weakens the acidity of the support, reducing the formation of hard coke. However, hydrogen does not significantly affect the formation of soft coke on the metal. The reaction mechanisms are influenced by hydrogen, as it can suppress the formation of coke precursors and reduce the molecular weight of polymers during propylene polymerization.

The literature does not provide specific information on how hydrogen cofeeding affects coke formation, catalyst stability, and reaction mechanisms in the propane dehydrogenation process. However, it does mention that the addition of water vapor can suppress the formation of coke during propane dehydrogenation at high temperatures. This suggests that hydrogen cofeeding, which often accompanies water vapor in steam reforming processes, may also contribute to coke suppression, improve catalyst stability by maintaining a reducing atmosphere that prevents the formation of coke precursors, and play a role in suppressing coke formation. The literature does not discuss the impact of hydrogen cofeeding on energy barriers, coke accumulation patterns, acid site conversions, or graphitization. However, the suppression of coke formation by water vapor implies that hydrogen cofeeding could have similar effects, leading to improved process efficiency and performance by reducing catalyst deactivation and regeneration requirements. The implications of these effects on the overall process efficiency and performance are not explicitly discussed, but it can be inferred that reducing coke formation would improve catalyst stability and prolong the life of the catalyst, leading to better process efficiency and performance.

The literature does not provide specific information on how hydrogen cofeeding affects coke formation, catalyst stability, and reaction mechanisms in propane dehydrogenation. However, it does mention that adding hydrogen to the feed increases the rate of alkene formation due to enhanced hydrogen-assisted dehydrogenation of surface alkyl species. The literature also notes that hydrogen addition to the feed has relatively little effect on alkene selectivity, which remains near 100%. The presence of hydrogen is crucial in reducing the amount of coke formed on the catalysts, via the hydrogenation of coke precursor species. The effects of hydrogen addition on the rate of propene formation are qualitatively similar to those seen for ethene formation, but the maximum in propene formation occurs at a different hydrogen-to-propane ratio than the maximum in ethene formation. The hydrogen-to-propane ratio has a somewhat larger effect on the selectivity to propene than on the selectivity to ethene produced by ethane dehydrogenation, but the propene selectivity still remains above 95.5% even at the highest hydrogen-to-propane ratio. The presence of Ga in the catalyst suppresses coke formation. The literature does not discuss the impact of hydrogen cofeeding on energy barriers, coke accumulation patterns, acid site conversions, graphitization, or the implications of these effects on overall process efficiency and performance. As the concentration of alkene in the product approaches the equilibrium concentration, the rate of alkene formation approaches that expected for equilibrium conversion of the alkane and the rate of alkene formation decreases with increasing H2/alkane ratio. The loss in activity of Pt/Mg(Ga)(Al)O with time on stream is smaller for ethane than propane dehydrogenation. Coke accumulation with time on stream is greater for ethane than propane dehydrogenation, and the moles of carbon deposited on the catalyst are many times higher than the moles of exposed Pt atoms. The lower coke formation during propane dehydrogenation compared to ethane dehydrogenation is attributed to the greater ease of hydrogenation of propyli- dyne compared to ethylidyne.

Hydrogen cofeeding in the propane dehydrogenation (PDH) process has a positive effect on the catalyst performance, comparable to the addition of Sn, which increases both propane conversion and propene selectivity. Hydrogen alters the nature of the coke deposits formed during propane dehydrogenation, leading to the formation of smaller graphite crystallites with fewer defects. This is due to hydrogen's ability to suppress coke formation on Pt-based catalysts by competitive adsorption on the catalyst surface, reducing the surface coverage of adsorbed carbon species. As the concentration of these species is reduced, they are less likely to polymerize and form coke. Hydrogen increases catalyst stability, conversion, and selectivity on the Pt-Sn/Al2O3 catalyst, with a propane concentration of 75% providing the optimal performance. The apparent shift in the position of the D Raman band is not yet understood. The narrowing of the Raman bands indicates a higher ordered carbon structure with fewer defects on the catalyst. The addition of H2 to the feed either increases the amount of defects in the graphitic lattice or decreases the size of the graphitic crystallites. The increase in propane dehydrogenation conversion observed with increasing H2 concentration is related to the decreased deposition of coke, which was detected by operando Raman spectroscopy. Initially, these sites are inhibited by coke, but sintering of the supported Pt nanoparticles may inhibit these sites permanently. The experiments with propane concentrations of 25 and 50% show a strong increase in selectivity for each consecutive cycle. For these specific experiments, less coke of a more graphitic nature is detected by operando Raman spectroscopy, suggesting a link between the presence of relatively disordered coke deposits and side reactions, such as cracking. These effects of hydrogen cofeeding on coke formation, catalyst stability, and reaction mechanisms have implications for the overall process efficiency and performance, as they can lead to improved conversion and selectivity, reduced catalyst deactivation, and potentially longer catalyst lifetimes.

It increases the catalyst performance and stability, conversion and selectivity on the Pt-Sn/Al2O3 catalyst. The addition of hydrogen leads to smaller, more ordered graphite crystallites, while less coke is formed in the presence of hydrogen. The conversion and selectivity increases when hydrogen is added. Hydrogen assists in keeping the active sites for dehydrogenation free of coke deposits.

The increase in propane dehydrogenation conversion observed with increasing hydrogen concentration is related to the decreased deposition of coke, which was detected by operando Raman spectroscopy.

The co-feeding of hydrogen in the propane dehydrogenation (PDH) process is advantageous as it reduces the rate of coke formation. The presence of an adsorbed hydrogen atom on the cluster facilitates the desorption of alkenes relative to the dehydrogenation of the adsorbed alkene. Hydrogen raises the energy of the third and undesired cleavage step to a greater extent than the first two steps, which could improve the selectivity of the reaction towards the formation of alkenes. This suggests that the addition of small amounts of hydrogen gas could enhance the selectivity of the reaction towards the formation of alkenes, thereby improving the overall process efficiency and performance.

Hydrogen cofeeding in the propane dehydrogenation (PDH) process suppresses the formation of coke, maintaining the activity of the catalyst and preventing deactivation. However, it does not remove coke that has already formed on the catalyst. Hydrogen's role in suppressing coke formation is attributed to its ability to prevent the formation of coke precursors. This effect is crucial for maintaining the catalytic activity during the reaction. Hydrogen can remove reversible coke through hydrogenation, which helps in maintaining the overall process efficiency and performance. The implications of these effects are that hydrogen cofeeding can significantly enhance the stability and efficiency of the PDH process by reducing coke formation and maintaining catalyst activity.
