[1] "The positive effect of hydrogen on the catalyst performance is comparable to the addition of Sn, a promoter element which increases both the propane conversion and propene selectivity."
          [2] "Operando Raman spectroscopy showed that hydrogen altered the nature of the coke deposits formed during propane dehydrogenation."
          [3] "By analysing the related intensity, band position and 15 bandwidth of the different Raman features, it was determined that smaller graphite crystallites, which have less defects, are formed when the partial pressure of hydrogen in the feed was increased."
          [4] "The ability of hydrogen to suppress coke formation on Pt-based catalysts is already known and is explained by competitive adsorption on the catalyst surface, effectively reducing the surface coverage of adsorbed carbon species."
          [5] "As the concentration of these species is 70 reduced, they are less likely to polymerize and form coke."
          [6] "The addition of H2 increases catalyst stability,conversion and selectivity on the Pt-Sn/Al2O3 catalyst, with a propane concentration of 75% providing the optimal performance."
          [7] "The reason of the apparent shift in the position of the D Raman band is not understood at this point."
          [8] "The narrowing of these bands indicates a higher ordered carbon structure with fewer defects on the catalyst."
          [9] "The addition of H2 to the feed therefore either increases the amount of defects in the graphitic lattice or decreases the size of the graphitic crystallites."
          [10] "The increase in propane dehydrogenation conversion observed with increasing H2 concentration is related to the decreased deposition 55 of coke, which was detected by operando Raman spectroscopy."
          [11] "Initially these sites are inhibited by coke, but sintering of the supported Pt nanoparticles may inhibit these sites permanently."
          [12] "Finally,the experiments with propane concentrations of 25 and 50% show a strong increase in selectivity for each consecutive cycle."
          [13] "For these specific 65 experiments, less coke of a more graphitic nature is detected by operando Raman spectroscopy, suggesting a link between the presence of relatively disordered coke deposits and side reactions,such as cracking."
          [14] "It was found that the addition of hydrogen to the feed increases the catalyst performance and decreases the formation of coke deposits, as was revealed by 10 thermogravimetrical analysis."
          [15] "The low initial selectivity can be explained by the fact that highly active sites present on the catalyst induce cracking and hydrogenolysis in the presence of H2."
          [16] "We propose that in the presence of high concentrations of H2,more graphitic coke is formed that mainly covers the catalyst support."
          [17] "In the absence of H2, more disordered coke is formed,that is also present on the supported Pt nanoparticles."
          [18] "H2 assists in keeping the surface of the Pt free of these disordered coke 100 species."

[1] "The presence of some hydrogen is known to be advantageous,5 and has been mainly attributed to a reduction in the rate of coke formation."
          [2] "The presence of an adsorbed H atom on the cluster facilitates alkene desorption relative to dehydrogenation of the adsorbed alkene."
          [3] "Interestingly,it raises the energy of the third and undesired cleavage step to far greater extent than it does for the first two steps."
          [4] "A marginal effect on the first two CH cleavages combined with a significant shift of the third suggests that the addition of small amounts of hydrogen gas could improve the selectivity of the reaction towards the formation of alkenes."

Hydrogen, on the other hand, suppresses the formation.
          Hydrogen was very efficient in preventing coke formation and deactivation but could not remove coke already formed on the catalyst.
          The hydrogenoly- sis and cracking mechanisms during the propane dehydrogenation are also discussed.
          Hydrogen has proven to be very efficient in maintaining the activity of the catalyst and also suppressing the coke formation.
          On the other hand, it was not possible to re- move any coke after the reaction stopped.
          The conclusion must be that hydrogen is active in preventing coke forma- tion but does not remove any significant amount of coke already formed.
          During the reaction, on the other hand, the formation of coke pre- cursors is suppressed by hydrogen, and what Biswas et al. called reversible coke, can be removed by hydrogenation (38).
          This explains why hydrogen helps maintain the cata- lytic activity.

[1] "Propane is usually cofed with hydrogen in the industrial PDH process. It is suggested that hydrogen decreases the rate of coke formation and increases the stability of the catalyst by removing the precursor of coke."
          [2] "The computational simulations verified this explanation that the energy barrier of dehydrogenation of propylene is increased when H adsorbs on the Pt surface, which prevents deep reaction."
          [3] "Moreover, for a conventional PtSn/Al2O3 catalyst, the reduced rate of coke formation is mainly ascribed to less coke accumulation on the support in hydrogen atmosphere, as shown in Figure 4a. The coke amount on metal is almost unchanged, but the coke amount on the support is decreased with increasing pressure of hydrogen."
          [4] "In the hydrogen atmosphere, the acidity of the support is weakened by conversion from Lewis acid site to Brnsted acid sites, which is helpful to reduce the rate of coking on the support."
          [5] "Additionally, the graphitization of coke is positively correlated with hydrogen partial pressure. This implied that it is harder to remove coke under hydrogen feeding because the highly ordered graphitic coke is combusted at higher temperature."

[1] "Propane is usually cofed with hydrogen in the industrial PDH process. It is suggested that hydrogen decreases the rate of coke formation and increases the stability of the catalyst by removing the precursor of coke."
          [2] "The computational simulations verified this explanation that the energy barrier of dehydrogenation of propylene is increased when H adsorbs on the Pt surface, which prevents deep reaction."
          [3] "Moreover, for a conventional PtSn/Al2O3 catalyst, the reduced rate of coke formation is mainly ascribed to less coke accumulation on the support in hydrogen atmosphere, as shown in Figure 4a. The coke amount on metal is almost unchanged, but the coke amount on the support is decreased with increasing pressure of hydrogen."
          [4] "In the hydrogen atmosphere, the acidity of the support is weakened by conversion from Lewis acid site to Brnsted acid sites, which is helpful to reduce the rate of coking on the support."
          [5] "Additionally, the graphitization of coke is positively correlated with hydrogen partial pressure. This implied that it is harder to remove coke under hydrogen feeding because the highly ordered graphitic coke is combusted at higher temperature."
          [6] "The coke amount on metal is almost unchanged, but the coke amount on the support is decreased with increasing pressure of hydrogen."
          [7] "In the hydrogen atmosphere, the acidity of the support is weakened by conversion from Lewis acid site to Brnsted acid sites, which is helpful to reduce the rate of coking on the support."
          [8] "Additionally, the graphitization of coke is positively correlated with hydrogen partial pressure."
          [9] "This implied that it is harder to remove coke under hydrogen feeding because the highly ordered graphitic coke is combusted at higher temperature."

[1] "The rate of coke formation on the metal is weakly dependent on the propylene and hydrogen pressures but increasing with the propane pressure, while the rate of coke formation on the support is increasing with the propane and propylene pressures and decreasing with the hydrogen pressure."





[1] "The positive effect of hydrogen on the catalyst performance is comparable to the addition of Sn, a promoter element which increases both the propane conversion and propene selectivity."
          [2] "Operando Raman spectroscopy showed that hydrogen altered the nature of the coke deposits formed during propane dehydrogenation."
          [3] "By analysing the related intensity, band position and 15 bandwidth of the different Raman features, it was determined that smaller graphite crystallites, which have less defects, are formed when the partial pressure of hydrogen in the feed was increased."
          [4] "The ability of hydrogen to suppress coke formation on Pt-based catalysts is already known and is explained by competitive adsorption on the catalyst surface, effectively reducing the surface coverage of adsorbed carbon species."
          [5] "As the concentration of these species is 70 reduced, they are less likely to polymerize and form coke."
          [6] "The addition of H2 increases catalyst stability,conversion and selectivity on the Pt-Sn/Al2O3 catalyst, with a propane concentration of 75% providing the optimal performance."
          [7] "The reason of the apparent shift in the position of the D Raman band is not understood at this point."
          [8] "The narrowing of these bands indicates a higher ordered carbon structure with fewer defects on the catalyst."
          [9] "The addition of H2 to the feed therefore either increases the amount of defects in the graphitic lattice or decreases the size of the graphitic crystallites."
          [10] "The increase in propane dehydrogenation conversion observed with increasing H2 concentration is related to the decreased deposition 55 of coke, which was detected by operando Raman spectroscopy."
          [11] "Initially these sites are inhibited by coke, but sintering of the supported Pt nanoparticles may inhibit these sites permanently."
          [12] "Finally,the experiments with propane concentrations of 25 and 50% show a strong increase in selectivity for each consecutive cycle."
          [13] "For these specific 65 experiments, less coke of a more graphitic nature is detected by operando Raman spectroscopy, suggesting a link between the presence of relatively disordered coke deposits and side reactions,such as cracking."
          [14] "It was found that the addition of hydrogen to the feed increases the catalyst performance and decreases the formation of coke deposits, as was revealed by 10 thermogravimetrical analysis."
          [15] "The low initial selectivity can be explained by the fact that highly active sites present on the catalyst induce cracking and hydrogenolysis in the presence of H2."
          [16] "We propose that in the presence of high concentrations of H2,more graphitic coke is formed that mainly covers the catalyst support."
          [17] "In the absence of H2, more disordered coke is formed,that is also present on the supported Pt nanoparticles."
          [18] "H2 assists in keeping the surface of the Pt free of these disordered coke 100 species."

[1] "The presence of some hydrogen is known to be advantageous,5 and has been mainly attributed to a reduction in the rate of coke formation."
          [2] "The presence of an adsorbed H atom on the cluster facilitates alkene desorption relative to dehydrogenation of the adsorbed alkene."
          [3] "Interestingly,it raises the energy of the third and undesired cleavage step to far greater extent than it does for the first two steps."
          [4] "A marginal effect on the first two CH cleavages combined with a significant shift of the third suggests that the addition of small amounts of hydrogen gas could improve the selectivity of the reaction towards the formation of alkenes."

Hydrogen, on the other hand, suppresses the formation.
          Hydrogen was very efficient in preventing coke formation and deactivation but could not remove coke already formed on the catalyst.
          The hydrogenoly- sis and cracking mechanisms during the propane dehydrogenation are also discussed.
          Hydrogen has proven to be very efficient in maintaining the activity of the catalyst and also suppressing the coke formation.
          On the other hand, it was not possible to re- move any coke after the reaction stopped.
          The conclusion must be that hydrogen is active in preventing coke forma- tion but does not remove any significant amount of coke already formed.

          [15] "The low initial selectivity can be explained by the fact that highly active sites present on the catalyst induce cracking and hydrogenolysis in the presence of H2."
          [16] "We propose that in the presence of high concentrations of H2,more graphitic coke is formed that mainly covers the catalyst support."
          [17] "In the absence of H2, more disordered coke is formed,that is also present on the supported Pt nanoparticles."
          [18] "H2 assists in keeping the surface of the Pt free of these disordered coke 100 species."

[1] "The presence of some hydrogen is known to be advantageous,5 and has been mainly attributed to a reduction in the rate of coke formation."
          [2] "The presence of an adsorbed H atom on the cluster facilitates alkene desorption relative to dehydrogenation of the adsorbed alkene."
          [3] "Interestingly,it raises the energy of the third and undesired cleavage step to far greater extent than it does for the first two steps."
          [4] "A marginal effect on the first two CH cleavages combined with a significant shift of the third suggests that the addition of small amounts of hydrogen gas could improve the selectivity of the reaction towards the formation of alkenes."

Hydrogen, on the other hand, suppresses the formation.
          Hydrogen was very efficient in preventing coke formation and deactivation but could not remove coke already formed on the catalyst.
          The hydrogenoly- sis and cracking mechanisms during the propane dehydrogenation are also discussed.
          Hydrogen has proven to be very efficient in maintaining the activity of the catalyst and also suppressing the coke formation.
          On the other hand, it was not possible to re- move any coke after the reaction stopped.
          The conclusion must be that hydrogen is active in preventing coke forma- tion but does not remove any significant amount of coke already formed.
          During the reaction, on the other hand, the formation of coke pre- cursors is suppressed by hydrogen, and what Biswas et al. called reversible coke, can be removed by hydrogenation (38).
          This explains why hydrogen helps maintain the cata- lytic activity.

[1] "Propane is usually cofed with hydrogen in the industrial PDH process. It is suggested that hydrogen decreases the rate of coke formation and increases the stability of the catalyst by removing the precursor of coke."
          [2] "The computational simulations verified this explanation that the energy barrier of dehydrogenation of propylene is increased when H adsorbs on the Pt surface, which prevents deep reaction."
          [3] "Moreover, for a conventional PtSn/Al2O3 catalyst, the reduced rate of coke formation is mainly ascribed to less coke accumulation on the support in hydrogen atmosphere, as shown in Figure 4a. The coke amount on metal is almost unchanged, but the coke amount on the support is decreased with increasing pressure of hydrogen."
          [4] "In the hydrogen atmosphere, the acidity of the support is weakened by conversion from Lewis acid site to Brnsted acid sites, which is helpful to reduce the rate of coking on the support."
          [5] "Additionally, the graphitization of coke is positively correlated with hydrogen partial pressure. This implied that it is harder to remove coke under hydrogen feeding because the highly ordered graphitic coke is combusted at higher temperature."
          [6] "The coke amount on metal is almost unchanged, but the coke amount on the support is decreased with increasing pressure of hydrogen."
          [7] "In the hydrogen atmosphere, the acidity of the support is weakened by conversion from Lewis acid site to Brnsted acid sites, which is helpful to reduce the rate of coking on the support."
          [8] "Additionally, the graphitization of coke is positively correlated with hydrogen partial pressure."
          [9] "This implied that it is harder to remove coke under hydrogen feeding because the highly ordered graphitic coke is combusted at higher temperature."

[1] "The rate of coke formation on the metal is weakly dependent on the propylene and hydrogen pressures but increasing with the propane pressure, while the rate of coke formation on the support is increasing with the propane and propylene pressures and decreasing with the hydrogen pressure."





[1] "The positive effect of hydrogen on the catalyst performance is comparable to the addition of Sn, a promoter element which increases both the propane conversion and propene selectivity."
          [2] "Operando Raman spectroscopy showed that hydrogen altered the nature of the coke deposits formed during propane dehydrogenation."
          [3] "By analysing the related intensity, band position and 15 bandwidth of the different Raman features, it was determined that smaller graphite crystallites, which have less defects, are formed when the partial pressure of hydrogen in the feed was increased."
          [4] "The ability of hydrogen to suppress coke formation on Pt-based catalysts is already known and is explained by competitive adsorption on the catalyst surface, effectively reducing the surface coverage of adsorbed carbon species."
          [5] "As the concentration of these species is 70 reduced, they are less likely to polymerize and form coke."
          [6] "The addition of H2 increases catalyst stability,conversion and selectivity on the Pt-Sn/Al2O3 catalyst, with a propane concentration of 75% providing the optimal performance."
          [7] "The reason of the apparent shift in the position of the D Raman band is not understood at this point."
          [8] "The narrowing of these bands indicates a higher ordered carbon structure with fewer defects on the catalyst."
          [9] "The addition of H2 to the feed therefore either increases the amount of defects in the graphitic lattice or decreases the size of the graphitic crystallites."
          [10] "The increase in propane dehydrogenation conversion observed with increasing H2 concentration is related to the decreased deposition 55 of coke, which was detected by operando Raman spectroscopy."
          [11] "Initially these sites are inhibited by coke, but sintering of the supported Pt nanoparticles may inhibit these sites permanently."
          [12] "Finally,the experiments with propane concentrations of 25 and 50% show a strong increase in selectivity for each consecutive cycle."
          [13] "For these specific 65 experiments, less coke of a more graphitic nature is detected by operando Raman spectroscopy, suggesting a link between the presence of relatively disordered coke deposits and side reactions,such as cracking."
