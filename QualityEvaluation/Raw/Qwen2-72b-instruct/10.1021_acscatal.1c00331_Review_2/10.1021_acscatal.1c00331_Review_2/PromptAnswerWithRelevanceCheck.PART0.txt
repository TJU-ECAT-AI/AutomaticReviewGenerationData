[1] "Propane is usually cofed with hydrogen in the industrial PDH process. It is suggested that hydrogen decreases the rate of coke formation and increases the stability of the catalyst by removing the precursor of coke."
[2] "The computational simulations verified this explanation that the energy barrier of dehydrogenation of propylene is increased when H adsorbs on the Pt surface, which prevents deep reaction."
[3] "Moreover, for a conventional PtSn/Al2O3 catalyst, the reduced rate of coke formation is mainly ascribed to less coke accumulation on the support in hydrogen atmosphere, as shown in Figure 4a. The coke amount on metal is almost unchanged, but the coke amount on the support is decreased with increasing pressure of hydrogen."
[4] "In the hydrogen atmosphere, the acidity of the support is weakened by conversion from Lewis acid site to Brnsted acid sites, which is helpful to reduce the rate of coking on the support."
[5] "Additionally, the graphitization of coke is positively correlated with hydrogen partial pressure. This implied that it is harder to remove coke under hydrogen feeding because the highly ordered graphitic coke is combusted at higher temperature."

Hydrogen cofeeding in the propane dehydrogenation (PDH) process reduces the rate of coke formation and enhances catalyst stability by removing coke precursors. Computational simulations confirm that hydrogen adsorption on the Pt surface increases the energy barrier for propylene dehydrogenation, preventing deep reactions that lead to coke formation. For a conventional PtSn/Al2O3 catalyst, hydrogen reduces coke accumulation on the support, with the amount of coke on the metal remaining relatively constant. In a hydrogen atmosphere, the acidity of the support is weakened as Lewis acid sites convert to Brnsted acid sites, which helps to decrease the rate of coking on the support. However, the graphitization of coke is positively correlated with hydrogen partial pressure, making it more difficult to remove coke under hydrogen feeding due to the higher combustion temperature required for highly ordered graphitic coke.

在丙烷脱氢(PDH)过程中，氢气共进料通过去除焦炭前体，降低了焦炭形成速率，提高了催化剂稳定性。计算模拟证实，当氢气吸附在Pt表面时，丙烯脱氢的能量屏障增加，防止了深度反应，从而减少了焦炭的形成。对于传统的PtSn/Al2O3催化剂，氢气环境下焦炭形成速率的降低主要归因于支撑物上焦炭积累的减少，而金属上的焦炭量几乎保持不变。在氢气气氛中，支撑物的酸性通过从Lewis酸位点向Brnsted酸位点的转化而减弱，这有助于降低支撑物上的焦化速率。此外，焦炭的石墨化程度与氢气分压呈正相关。这意味着在氢气进料下，由于高度有序的石墨化焦炭需要在更高的温度下燃烧，因此更难去除焦炭。

Hydrogen cofeeding in the propane dehydrogenation (PDH) process reduces the rate of coke formation and enhances catalyst stability by removing coke precursors. Computational simulations have confirmed that hydrogen adsorption on the platinum (Pt) surface increases the energy barrier for propylene dehydrogenation, preventing deep reactions that lead to coke formation. In the case of a conventional PtSn/Al2O3 catalyst, hydrogen cofeeding significantly reduces coke accumulation on the support, with less impact on the metal. The presence of hydrogen weakens the acidity of the support by converting Lewis acid sites to Brnsted acid sites, which helps to decrease the rate of coking on the support. However, the graphitization of coke is positively correlated with hydrogen partial pressure, making it more difficult to remove coke under hydrogen feeding due to the higher temperature required to combust the highly ordered graphitic coke.
