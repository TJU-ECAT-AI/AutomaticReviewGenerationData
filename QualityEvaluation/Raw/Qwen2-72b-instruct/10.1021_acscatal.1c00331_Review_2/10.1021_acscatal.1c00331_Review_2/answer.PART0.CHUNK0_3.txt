[1] "Propane is usually cofed with hydrogen in the industrial PDH process. It is suggested that hydrogen decreases the rate of coke formation and increases the stability of the catalyst by removing the precursor of coke."
[2] "The computational simulations verified this explanation that the energy barrier of dehydrogenation of propylene is increased when H adsorbs on the Pt surface, which prevents deep reaction."
[3] "Moreover, for a conventional PtSn/Al2O3 catalyst, the reduced rate of coke formation is mainly ascribed to less coke accumulation on the support in hydrogen atmosphere, as shown in Figure 4a."
[4] "The coke amount on metal is almost unchanged, but the coke amount on the support is decreased with increasing pressure of hydrogen."
[5] "In the hydrogen atmosphere, the acidity of the support is weakened by conversion from Lewis acid site to Brnsted acid sites, which is helpful to reduce the rate of coking on the support."
[6] "Additionally, the graphitization of coke is positively correlated with hydrogen partial pressure."
[7] "This implied that it is harder to remove coke under hydrogen feeding because the highly ordered graphitic coke is combusted at higher temperature."

Hydrogen cofeeding in the propane dehydrogenation (PDH) process has a significant impact on coke formation, catalyst stability, and reaction mechanisms. Hydrogen decreases the rate of coke formation and enhances catalyst stability by removing the precursor of coke. Computational simulations have confirmed that hydrogen adsorption on the Pt surface increases the energy barrier of propylene dehydrogenation, preventing deep reactions that lead to coke formation. In a conventional PtSn/Al2O3 catalyst, hydrogen reduces coke formation primarily by decreasing coke accumulation on the support, while the amount of coke on the metal remains relatively unchanged. The presence of hydrogen weakens the acidity of the support by converting Lewis acid sites to Brnsted acid sites, which helps to reduce the rate of coking on the support. However, the graphitization of coke is positively correlated with hydrogen partial pressure, implying that it becomes more difficult to remove coke under hydrogen feeding because the highly ordered graphitic coke requires higher temperatures for combustion. These effects of hydrogen cofeeding have implications for the overall process efficiency and performance, as they can lead to improved catalyst stability and reduced coke formation, but may also make coke removal more challenging.

在丙烷脱氢（PDH）过程中，氢气共进料对焦炭形成、催化剂稳定性和反应机制有显著影响。氢气通过去除焦炭前体，降低焦炭形成速率，增强催化剂稳定性。计算模拟证实，氢气吸附在Pt表面时，丙烯脱氢的能量屏障增加，防止了导致焦炭形成的深度反应。在传统的PtSn/Al2O3催化剂中，氢气主要通过减少支撑物上的焦炭积累来降低焦炭形成速率，而金属上的焦炭量几乎保持不变。在氢气气氛下，支撑物的酸性通过从Lewis酸位点转化为Brnsted酸位点而减弱，这有助于降低支撑物上的焦炭形成速率。然而，焦炭的石墨化与氢气分压呈正相关，这意味着在氢气进料下，去除焦炭变得更加困难，因为高度有序的石墨化焦炭需要在更高温度下才能燃烧。氢气共进料的这些效应对整体过程效率和性能有影响，因为它们可以提高催化剂稳定性，减少焦炭形成，但同时也可能使焦炭去除变得更加具有挑战性。
