[1] "Propane is usually cofed with hydrogen in the industrial PDH process. It is suggested that hydrogen decreases the rate of coke formation and increases the stability of the catalyst by removing the precursor of coke."
[2] "The computational simulations verified this explanation that the energy barrier of dehydrogenation of propylene is increased when H adsorbs on the Pt surface, which prevents deep reaction."
[3] "Moreover, for a conventional PtSn/Al2O3 catalyst, the reduced rate of coke formation is mainly ascribed to less coke accumulation on the support in hydrogen atmosphere, as shown in Figure 4a."
[4] "The acidity of the support is weakened by conversion from Lewis acid site to Brnsted acid sites, which is helpful to reduce the rate of coking on the support."
[5] "Additionally, the graphitization of coke is positively correlated with hydrogen partial pressure. This implied that it is harder to remove coke under hydrogen feeding because the highly ordered graphitic coke is combusted at higher temperature."

Hydrogen cofeeding in the propane dehydrogenation (PDH) process reduces the rate of coke formation and enhances catalyst stability by removing coke precursors. Computational simulations have confirmed that hydrogen adsorption on the platinum (Pt) surface increases the energy barrier for propylene dehydrogenation, preventing deep reactions that lead to coke formation. In the case of a conventional PtSn/Al2O3 catalyst, hydrogen cofeeding significantly reduces coke accumulation on the support, with less impact on the metal. The presence of hydrogen weakens the acidity of the support by converting Lewis acid sites to Brnsted acid sites, which helps to decrease the rate of coking on the support. However, the graphitization of coke is positively correlated with hydrogen partial pressure, making it more difficult to remove coke under hydrogen feeding due to the higher temperature required to combust the highly ordered graphitic coke.

在丙烷脱氢（PDH）过程中，氢气共进料通过去除焦炭前体，降低了焦炭形成速率，提高了催化剂稳定性。计算模拟证实，当氢气吸附在铂（Pt）表面时，丙烯脱氢的能量屏障增加，防止了导致焦炭形成的深度反应。对于传统的PtSn/Al2O3催化剂，氢气共进料显著减少了支撑材料上的焦炭积累，对金属的影响较小。氢气的存在通过将路易斯酸位点转化为布伦斯特酸位点，削弱了支撑材料的酸性，有助于降低支撑材料上的焦炭形成速率。然而，焦炭的石墨化与氢气分压呈正相关，这意味着在氢气进料下，由于需要更高的温度来燃烧高度有序的石墨焦炭，因此更难去除焦炭。
