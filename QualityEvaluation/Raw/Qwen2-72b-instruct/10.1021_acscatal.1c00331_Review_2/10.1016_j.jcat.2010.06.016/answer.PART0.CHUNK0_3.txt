1.The literature does not provide specific information on how hydrogen cofeeding affects coke formation, catalyst stability, and reaction mechanisms in propane dehydrogenation. However, it does mention that adding hydrogen to the feed increases the rate of alkene formation due to enhanced hydrogen-assisted dehydrogenation of surface alkyl species. The literature also notes that hydrogen addition to the feed has relatively little effect on alkene selectivity, which remains near 100%. The presence of hydrogen likely contributes to the hydrogenation of coke precursor species, reducing the amount of coke formed on the catalysts. The effects of hydrogen addition on the energy barriers, coke accumulation patterns, acid site conversions, and graphitization are not discussed in the literature.

1.文献没有提供氢气共进料如何影响丙烷脱氢中焦炭形成、催化剂稳定性和反应机制的具体信息。但是，它确实提到向进料中添加氢气会由于表面烷基物种的氢辅助脱氢增强而增加烯烃的形成速率。文献还指出，向进料中添加氢气对烯烃选择性的影响相对较小，烯烃选择性保持在接近100%。氢气的存在可能有助于焦炭前体物种的氢化，从而减少催化剂上形成的焦炭量。文献中没有讨论氢气添加对能垒、焦炭积累模式、酸位点转化和石墨化的影响。
