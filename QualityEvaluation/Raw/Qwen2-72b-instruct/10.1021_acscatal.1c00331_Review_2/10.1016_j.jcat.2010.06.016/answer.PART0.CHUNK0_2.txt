1.The literature does not provide specific information on how hydrogen cofeeding affects coke formation, catalyst stability, and reaction mechanisms in propane dehydrogenation. However, it does mention that adding hydrogen to the feed increases the rate of alkene formation due to enhanced hydrogen-assisted dehydrogenation of surface alkyl species. As the concentration of alkene in the product approaches the equilibrium concentration, the rate of alkene formation approaches that expected for equilibrium conversion of the alkane and the rate of alkene formation decreases with increasing H2/alkane ratio. The loss in activity of Pt/Mg(Ga)(Al)O with time on stream is smaller for ethane than propane dehydrogenation. Coke accumulation with time on stream is greater for ethane than propane dehydrogenation, and the moles of carbon deposited on the catalyst are many times higher than the moles of exposed Pt atoms. The lower coke formation during propane dehydrogenation compared to ethane dehydrogenation is attributed to the greater ease of hydrogenation of propyli- dyne compared to ethylidyne.

1.文献没有提供氢气共进料如何影响丙烷脱氢中焦炭形成、催化剂稳定性和反应机制的具体信息。但是，它确实提到向进料中添加氢气会由于表面烷基物种的氢辅助脱氢增强而增加烯烃的形成速率。当产品中烯烃的浓度接近平衡浓度时，烯烃的形成速率接近于烷烃平衡转化预期的速率，并且随着H2/烷烃比的增加，烯烃的形成速率降低。Pt/Mg(Ga)(Al)O在流时间上的活性损失对于乙烷脱氢比丙烷脱氢小。随时间积累的焦炭对于乙烷脱氢比丙烷脱氢大，沉积在催化剂上的碳摩尔数远高于暴露的Pt原子的摩尔数。丙烷脱氢与乙烷脱氢相比，焦炭形成较低，归因于丙基-啶比乙基-啶更容易氢化。
