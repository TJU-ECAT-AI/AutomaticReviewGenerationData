1.The literature does not provide specific information on how hydrogen cofeeding affects coke formation, catalyst stability, and reaction mechanisms in propane dehydrogenation. However, it does mention that adding hydrogen to the feed increases the rate of alkene formation due to enhanced hydrogen-assisted dehydrogenation of surface alkyl species. The literature also notes that hydrogen addition to the feed has relatively little effect on alkene selectivity, which remains near 100%. The presence of hydrogen is crucial in reducing the amount of coke formed on the catalysts, via the hydrogenation of coke precursor species. The effects of hydrogen addition on the rate of propene formation are qualitatively similar to those seen for ethene formation, but the maximum in propene formation occurs at a different hydrogen-to-propane ratio than the maximum in ethene formation. The hydrogen-to-propane ratio has a somewhat larger effect on the selectivity to propene than on the selectivity to ethene produced by ethane dehydrogenation, but the propene selectivity still remains above 95.5% even at the highest hydrogen-to-propane ratio.

1.文献没有提供氢气共进料如何影响丙烷脱氢中焦炭形成、催化剂稳定性和反应机制的具体信息。但是，它确实提到向进料中添加氢气会由于表面烷基物种的氢辅助脱氢增强而增加烯烃的生成速率。文献还指出，向进料中添加氢气对烯烃选择性的影响相对较小，烯烃选择性仍接近100%。氢气的存在对于通过氢化焦炭前体物种来减少催化剂上形成的焦炭量至关重要。氢气添加对丙烯生成速率的影响在定性上与乙烯形成的影响相似，但丙烯生成的最大值发生在与乙烯生成最大值不同的氢气与丙烷比例。氢气与丙烷的比例对丙烯选择性的影响比对乙烷脱氢产生的乙烯选择性的影响稍大，但在最高的氢气与丙烷比例下，丙烯选择性仍然保持在95.5%以上。

However, it does mention that adding hydrogen to the feed increases the rate of alkene formation due to enhanced hydrogen-assisted dehydrogenation of surface alkyl species. As the concentration of alkene in the product approaches the equilibrium concentration, the rate of alkene formation approaches that expected for equilibrium conversion of the alkane and the rate of alkene formation decreases with increasing H2/alkane ratio. The loss in activity of Pt/Mg(Ga)(Al)O with time on stream is smaller for ethane than propane dehydrogenation. Coke accumulation with time on stream is greater for ethane than propane dehydrogenation, and the moles of carbon deposited on the catalyst are many times higher than the moles of exposed Pt atoms. The lower coke formation during propane dehydrogenation compared to ethane dehydrogenation is attributed to the greater ease of hydrogenation of propyli- dyne compared to ethylidyne.
