Abstract
The effects of Ce addition on the Pt-Sn/g-Al2O3 catalysts for propane dehydrogenation to propylene have been investigated by reaction tests and
some physicochemical characterizations like XRD, BET, NH3-TPD, H2-TPD, H2-TPR, H2-chemisorption, CO-FTIR and TPO. The results show
that the Ce addition could greatly improve the catalytic performance and catalytic stability of the Pt-Sn/g-Al2O3, which is reported as the optimal
catalyst for propane dehydrogenation to propylene. We could keep >38% of propane conversion, >98% propylene selectivity and >37%
propylene yield over 50 h in the reaction of propane dehydrogenation to propylene over Pt-Sn/Ce-Al2O3 catalysts at 576 8C, 3800 h1 and H2/
C3H8/Ar = 1/1/5. The presence of Ce in the Pt-Sn/Ce-Al2O3 catalysts could not only stabilize the active states of Pt, Sn and support, but could also
suppress the coke accumulation on the catalyst during reaction, and further improve the catalytic performance of Pt-Sn/g-Al2O3.

1. Introduction
Recently, the dehydrogenation of light parafﬁn has acquired
importance due to the growing demand for light oleﬁns such as
propylene and isobutene. Nowadays, most of the propylene is
obtained as by-product of gasoline production by both thermal
and catalytic cracking processes, thus, the gasoline market
demands
determine
the
availability
of
oleﬁns.
Propane
dehydrogenation is believed to have a great potential as a
propylene booster in the future [1].
The platinum-tin-alumina-supported catalysts have been
widely used not only in the petroleum industry for naphtha
reforming, but also in parafﬁn dehydrogenation reactions. Over
these platinum-supported catalysts, the stability and selectivity
for parafﬁn dehydrogenation to oleﬁns increases while cracking
process, isomerization reactions and coke formation process are
suppressed [2–6]. Important progresses in the PtSn catalyst have
beenreportedinalargenumberofpapers[7–10].Sergioetal.[10]
reported that, over PtSnGa/ZnAl2O4 catalyst, a high dehydro-
genation performance was obtained. At reaction conditions:
T = 580 8C, H2:C3H8:He = 9:10:81, WGHSV = 0.037 h1, and
reaction time: 80 min, the mean yield of propylene reached 33%.
However, the dehydrogenation performance of PtSn catalysts is
still not satisfactory, especially regarding the stability of the
catalysts. Therefore, it is necessary to improve the stability of
PtSn catalysts during light parafﬁn conversion.
The catalytic properties of the PtSn bimetallic catalysts
strongly depend on the interaction between Pt and Sn, and on
the state of Sn. When Sn exists in a metallic state, it may be a
poison; when it exists in a nonmetallic state, it acts as a
promoter [11,12]. It has been reported by Del Angel et al. [13]
that the addition of lanthanum to PtSn/Al2O3 can strongly
inﬂuence the states of Pt and Sn.
Rare earth elements, such as lanthanum and cerium, have
unique properties which are related to the thermal stabilization
of the alumina support and to strong metal–rare earth oxide
interaction [13,14]. It has been reported that the main role of
CeO2 in CeO2/g-Al2O3 is to improve the thermal stability of the
support, which is attributed to the CeAlO3 formation [15].
Metal–ceria oxide interaction could strongly modify the
structural and electronic properties of the supported noble

metal. Therefore, the promotion effects of cerium on the
catalytic performance of Pt-Sn/Al2O3 catalyst were studied in
this research.
2. Experimental
2.1. Catalyst preparation
A commercial g-Al2O3 (SBET: 250 m2 g1), previously 40–
60 mesh sieved and calcined in air at 550 8C for 4 h, was used as
support. Pt/g-Al2O3 catalyst was prepared by impregnating g-
Al2O3 with excess aqueous solution of the Pt precursor
(H2PtCl6). After impregnation, the catalyst was dried at
110 8C overnight and then calcined at 500 8C in air for 4 h.
For Pt-Sn/g-Al2O3 and Pt/Ce-g-Al2O3 catalysts, Sn or Ce was
ﬁrst deposited by impregnating SnCl2 ethanol solution or
Ce(NO3)3 aqueous solution, then dried and calcined, and ﬁnally
the PtcomponentwasaddedfromaqueousPtsolutioninasimilar
way. In the case of Pt-Sn/Ce-g-Al2O3 catalysts, Sn and Ce were
ﬁrst deposited by co-impregnating SnCl2 and Ce(NO3)3 ethanol
solution, then dried and calcined. Finally, the Pt component was
added as described previously. In all cases, the loadings of Pt and
Sn were 0.3 and 0.9 wt.%, respectively. The catalysts were
labeled as follows: Pt/Al for platinum supported on alumina, Pt-
Sn/Alforplatinum-tinsupportedonaluminaandPt-Sn/Ce-Al for
platinum-tin-cerium supported on alumina. Catalysts were
marked as 0.55Ce, 1.1Ce, 2.2Ce and 3.3Ce, indicating the
wt.% amount of Ce loaded in the catalyst.
2.2. Catalyst characterizations
2.2.1. BET surface area
The surface area was obtained from N2 adsorption/
desorption isotherms determined at liquid nitrogen temperature
on an automatic analyzer (NOVA 4000, Quantachrome, USA).
The samples were outgassed for 1 h under vacuum at 300 8C
prior to adsorption.
2.2.2. X-ray diffraction
The powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were obtained
on a Philips CM-1 (Cu Ka, l = 0.1543 nm) powder X-ray
diffractometer. The X-ray tube was operated at 40 kV and
40 mA. Spectra were scanned at a rate of 58 min1 (in 2u).
2.2.3. NH3-TPD
The acidity of some samples was measured by temperature-
programmed desorption of ammonia (NH3-TPD) on an ASAP
2010C chemisorption analyzer. Samples (0.2 g) were placed
into a quartz U-type reactor between two quartz wool plugs.
The samples were treated by ﬂowing dry argon (99.99%) at
500 8C for 1 h prior to adsorption of ammonia. Then, samples
were saturated by an ammonia pulse at room temperature.
Before the run, the baseline was stabilized in dry argon (30 ml/
min) at the same temperature for 2 h. Subsequently, the
temperature was raised up to 600 8C with a heating rate of
10 8C/min. The NH3 desorption proﬁle was registered with a
thermal conductivity detector.
2.2.4. H2-TPR
Temperature-programmed
reduction
experiments
were
carried out in a conventional setup, consisting of a program-
mable temperature furnace. Samples (0.08 g) were ﬁlled in the
quartz reactor. Prior to TPR analysis, the samples were treated
in situ by ﬂowing dry argon (30 ml/min) at 500 8C for 1 h.
Before the run the baseline was stabilized in the gas ﬂow at
25 8C for 60 min. The reactor was heated in a temperature-
programmed furnace from room temperature to 800 8C (10 8C/
min). A 5% (v/v) H2 in Ar mixture was used as a reducing gas.
The hydrogen consumption as a function of reduction
temperature was continuously monitored with a TCD cell
and recorded. The apparatus was calibrated by the reduction of
pure CuO.
2.2.5. H2-TPD and H2-chemisorption
Temperature-programmed desorption of hydrogen and
hydrogen pulse chemisorption experiments were carried out
in the same setup as TPR. Before pulse chemisorption
experiments, the samples (0.2 g) were reduced under ﬂowing
pure H2 (12.6 ml/min) at 576 8C for 2.5 h, then purged in Ar at
550 8C for 120 min and cooled to 25 8C in ﬂowing Ar. The
pulse size was 0.32 ml 5% (v/v) H2 in Ar mixture and the time
between pulses was 3 min. Before TPD experiments, the
samples (0.2 g) were reduced under ﬂowing pure H2 (12.6 ml/
min) at 576 8C for 2.5 h. After the reduction the catalyst was
cooled to 25 8C in ﬂowing H2. The gas stream was switched to
Ar and subsequently a TPD experiment was performed (10 8C/
min up to 540 8C).
2.2.6. IR CO adsorption
For IR studies, infrared spectra of 4 cm1 resolution were
recorded by a FTIR spectrometer (EQUINOX55) with a Pyrex
glass IR cell equipped with CaF2 windows, using 64 scans for
each spectrum. For the FTIR study, the catalysts were
compressed to disks (Ø = 1 cm, about 15 mg) which were
placed in the sample holder of the IR cell. This IR cell enabled
in situ treatments (0–500 8C) of the solid with a gas ﬂow at
atmospheric pressure. Prior to CO adsorption, the samples were
reduced under a ﬂow of H2 (50 ml/min) for 90 min at 400 8C.
After the sample was cooled to room temperature in the ﬂow of
H2, the IR cell was evacuated to 2  102 Pa for 6 h. Then the
CO was introduced into the cell (CO pressure: 2.7  103 Pa)
and maintained for 1 h at 25 8C. The excess of CO was
evacuated and the CO adsorption spectra were recorded. The
adsorptions by the windows and by the blank powdered sample
were subtracted from all the spectra.
2.2.7. TPO
In temperature-programmed oxidation (TPO) of carbon
experiments, the reacted samples (0.2 g) were purged in a He
ﬂow (40 ml/min) at 500 8C for 30 min and then the temperature
lowered to 25 8C prior to the TPO in a 2 vol.% oxygen/98 vol.%
helium mixture ﬂow of 40 ml/min. The temperature was
ramped up at 10 8C/min while the CO2 generated was
monitored by an on-line mass spectrometer (Omnisorp.
Corporation).

2.2.8. O2-pulse
The amount of carbon formed on catalysts during the
reaction was determined by O2-pulse experiments on a gas
chromatograph ﬂow system. The pulse experiments were
carried out at 800 8C by injecting pulses of pure oxygen (pulse
volume: 0.3 ml STP) to the carbon deposited catalysts (0.03 g),
which was maintained under ﬂowing Ar (30 ml/min) between
two successive pulses. The CO2 generated was continuously
monitored with a TCD cell and recorded. The pulses of pure
oxygen were stopped when the deposited carbon was entirely
converted to CO2.
2.3. Catalytic test
Catalysts were tested in the propane dehydrogenation
reaction in a ﬂow reactor at atmospheric pressure. A sample
(0.3 g), placed in a quartz ﬁxed-bed reactor, was previously
reduced under ﬂowing pure H2 (12.6 ml/min) at 576 8C for
2.5 h. Then the reaction mixture composed of H2, C3H8 and Ar
(H2/C3H8/Ar molar ratio = 1:1:5) was fed to the reactor. The
total GHSV was 3800 h1. Five minutes after the beginning of
the reaction, the gas compositions of reactant and products were
analyzed by an FID chromatographic system (Shimadzu GC14-
C) with a Porapak-Q packed column.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. The performance of the catalysts
The performance of the catalysts in propane dehydrogena-
tion is shown in Fig. 1. The initial conversions of propane
catalyzed by Pt/Al, Pt-Sn/Al, Pt/1.1Ce-Al and Pt-Sn/1.1Ce-Al
catalysts are 34.10, 42.27, 43.26 and 43.78%, respectively; after
150 min, the conversions decrease to 18.65, 32.47, 24.06 and
39.76%, respectively. It can be seen that the Pt/Al catalyst
shows the poorest activity and stability. Addition of Ce to Pt/Al
catalyst results in the increase of propane initial conversion
from 34.10 to 43.26%. However, the propylene selectivity
(initial: 64.10%; ﬁnal: 88.18%) markedly decreases, which
suggests that the rates of hydrogenolysis and coke reactions are
signiﬁcant for the product distribution. The highest dehydro-
genation activity, selectivity and stability are obtained over Pt-
Sn/1.1Ce-Al catalyst. The initial and ﬁnal selectivities for
propylene over Pt-Sn/1.1Ce-Al catalyst are 92.54 and 97.19%,
respectively. The effect of Ce on the Pt/Al catalyst is only the
improvement of the initial activity. However, one notable effect
of Ce on Pt-Sn/Al catalyst is the improvement of overall
dehydrogenation performance, especially with respect to the
stability.
3.2. Effect of cerium concentration
Fig. 2 shows the propane conversion and propylene
selectivity over Pt-Sn/Ce-Al catalysts with various cerium
loadings. When the cerium loading is in the range of 1.1–
3.3 wt.%, the propane conversion and catalytic stability are
greatly improved. However, the higher cerium concentration
(3.3 wt.%) leads to a decline in the activity and selectivity. It
is possible that higher Ce concentration changes the support
structure and properties, and further changes the catalytic
performance.
Over
Pt-Sn/2.2Ce-Al
catalyst
the
propane
conversion reaches its maximum. The initial and ﬁnal
conversions of propane are 47.09 and 44.00%, respectively,
which means the deactivation rate is at the minimum.
3.3. Effect of temperature
Fig. 3 shows the temperature dependence of conversion and
selectivity of the Pt-Sn/2.2Ce-Al catalyst. The initial conver-
sions of propane are 18.59, 32.65, 47.09 and 62.46%, at 516,

546, 576 and 606 8C, respectively, and the ﬁnal conversions
are18.16, 32.18, 43.98 and 52.91%, respectively. The initial
selectivity decreased with the increase of temperature. It can be
seen that the Pt-Sn/2.2Ce-Al catalyst exhibits the highly
efﬁcient dehydrogenation performance above 576 8C. The
mean yield of propylene reaches 53% during 155 min reaction
at 606 8C.
3.4. Regeneration and stability test
To further assess the performance of the Pt-Sn/2.2Ce-Al
catalyst, we made a comparison with the conventional
Pt-Sn/Al catalyst by using a recycle reaction. The results
are shown in Fig. 4. It can be seen that the initial propane
conversions increase after catalyst regeneration. However,
propane
conversion
decreases
with
increasing
reaction
time. It is obvious that the deactivation rate of the Pt-Sn/
Al catalyst is much faster than that of the Pt-Sn/2.2Ce-Al
catalyst with the increase of recycle number. In the fourth
cycle reaction, the initial and ﬁnal conversions over Pt-Sn/Al
catalyst are 58.00, 17.00%, respectively; over Pt-Sn/2.2Ce-
Al catalyst, the initial and ﬁnal conversions are 53.00,
41.00%, respectively. A remarkable stability of dehydro-
genation in recycle reaction is obtained over Pt-Sn/2.2Ce-Al
catalyst.
A stability test of the Pt-Sn/1.1Ce-Al catalyst was also
carried out. The propane conversion and the selectivity to
propylene as a function of the reaction time are shown in Fig. 5.
On one hand, the selectivity increases quickly from 86.00 to
93.00% in the initial period, then a high value (over 94.00%) is
obtained in the overall process. On the other hand, only a small
deactivation rate is displayed in the overall process. The mean
yield of propylene is about 39% during the course of reaction
for 50 h.
3.5. Characterization of the catalysts
3.5.1. Textural property
Table 1 gives the physicochemical properties of the fresh
catalysts after reduction. It is seen that the surface area of the Pt/
Al catalyst is slightly higher than that of the promoted catalysts.
The surface area of Pt-Sn/Al catalyst is much smaller than that
of Pt/Ce-Al catalyst. The surface area of Pt-Sn/Ce-Al catalyst is
slightly higher than that of Pt-Sn/Al catalyst. The variation of
the surface area could be related to the inﬂuence of CeO2 on the

Regeneration conditions: catalyst regeneration was performed by oxidative
treatment using pure air (12.6 ml/min) for 1 h at 580 8C. Then, the catalyst was
reduced in ﬂowing pure hydrogen (12.6 ml/min) for 2 h at 580 8C.

thermal stability of alumina. It has been reported [16,17] that
CeO2 could stabilize g-Al2O3 against surface area loss by
preventing the transformation of g-Al2O3 to a-Al2O3, which
depends on CeO2 loading. Low CeO2 loading is most effective
in promoting the thermal stability of alumina while high CeO2
loading is almost ineffective. Platinum dispersion estimates,
which were calculated from pulse chemisorption at 25 8C using
the assumption H:Pt = 1 [18,19], are listed in Table 1. The
chemisorption results indicate that the addition of Sn or Ce to
Pt/Al increases platinum dispersion, which implies that the
presence of Sn or Ce over Pt/Al catalyst could decrease the size
of platinum particles and further promote the reactivity (as is
indicated by Fig. 1) because previous studies have shown that
the active site for propane dehydrogenation to propylene is the
single platinum atom [20]. Addition of Ce to Pt-Sn/Al does not
result in an obvious change in platinum dispersion, which may
be responsible for the almost identical initial reactivity values
for Pt-Sn/Al and Pt-Sn/Ce-Al catalysts. However, with higher
cerium loading, for the Pt-Sn/3.3Ce-Al catalyst, a decrease in
platinum dispersion is observed. An explanation could be that
ceria species block the platinum particles, and further decrease
the dispersion of platinum and the initial reactivity (Fig. 2).
3.5.2. X-ray diffraction spectra of catalysts
The catalysts after reduction were investigated by X-ray
diffractometer. No catalysts show any diffraction peaks of Pt
and Sn species, due to their small crystallite size or low
concentration of Pt and Sn. Only the spectrum of Pt-Sn/3.3Ce-
Al catalyst is shown in Fig. 6. For comparison, the spectra of
CeO2 and g-Al2O3 are also presented. On one hand, small
characteristic diffraction lines at 2u = 28.58, 33.38, 47.58 and
56.48 of CeO2 ﬂuorite structure [21] are detected in the Pt-Sn/
3.3Ce-Al catalyst. On the other hand, very small diffraction
lines of CeAlO3 at 2u = 23.58, 33.58, 41.48 and 608 [22] are also
observed in this catalyst. Catalysts with cerium loading at
3.3 wt.% do not show any clear diffraction peaks of
crystalline CeO2 and CeAlO3, which is related to the low
concentration of cerium or the small crystallite size below the
XRD detection limit. Using XPS, Bak and Hilaire [23]
reported, on a low cerium content Pt-CeO2/Al2O3 sample after
reduction, that part of the cerium species could exist in the form
of CeAlO3.
The above BET and XRD analyses show that, although the
presence of cerium could not promote the dispersion of
platinum, it leads to a slight increase of surface area of the
catalysts. Cerium could promote the thermal stability of
alumina against surface area loss in the elevated temperature
dehydrogenation conditions,
which
is connected
to
the
formation of Ce3+ as CeAlO3 under reducing atmosphere.
Thus, the surface diffusion of catalyst components for sintering
could be inhibited. According to a model proposed by Humber
et al. [24], the geometrical arrangement between CeAlO3 and
CeO2 favors the formation of microdomains that act as barriers
for surface diffusion. Shyu and Otto [25] have also reported
that, over Pt/Ce-Al2O3 catalyst, the strong interaction between
dispersed Ce and alumina results in the formation of surface
CeAlO3 by Ce3+cations occupying vacant octahedral sites on
alumina surface. This initial occupation of octahedral sites by
cerium cations blocks the transition of Al3+cations from
tetrahedral to octahedral sites during high-temperature treat-
ment, which causes the loss of the surface area of alumina [26].
The high stability values of Pt-Sn/Ce-Al catalyst at elevated
temperature and in regeneration conditions partly proﬁt from
the improvement in the thermal stability of alumina.
3.5.3. NH3-TPD analysis
The dehydrogenation performance of the catalyst is strongly
related to the acidity of the catalyst. The acidity of some
catalysts was examined by NH3-TPD experiments. The proﬁles
of NH3-TPD are shown in Fig. 7. A semi-quantitative
comparison
of
the
adsorption
strength distribution
was
achieved by the deconvolution of the peaks using normal
distribution functions. The semi-quantitative results after the
multi-peak ﬁtting are illustrated in Table 2. On all catalysts, a
broad desorption peak with a maximum at 172–182 8C and a
shoulder at higher temperature (260–290 8C) are clearly
visible. The low temperature peak could be ascribed to weak
and medium strength acid sites, whereas the peak above 260 8C

is typical of strong acidity sites. Although the addition of Sn or
Ce to Pt/Al catalysts could reduce the intensity of the strong
acidity sites, judging from the higher temperature desorption
peak of NH3, the presence of Ce results in an increase in the
strong acidity peak fraction and the total amount of acidity in
Pt/Ce-Al system. The strong acidity sites are needed for the
formation of highly dehydrogenated species through isomer-
ization and coking reactions on the surface of the catalyst [27].
The poor stability and selectivity for Pt/Al and Pt/Ce-Al
catalyst would be related to the comparatively high acidity. The
addition of Ce to Pt-Sn/Al catalyst dose not result in a
substantial change in the total acidity of the system.
3.5.4. H2-TPR analysis
Previous studies have shown that the presence of ceria can
strongly inﬂuence the oxidation and reduction properties of
supported noble metals (Pt, Rh and Pd) [28]. The effects of
ceria on the reduction properties of catalysts were measured by
TPR. The TPR proﬁles of all samples are shown in Fig. 8 (A–
B). All samples exhibit a sharp reduction peak at about 700 8C.
The origin of the 700 8C peak is not clearly known. When Pt is
present, this peak shifts to a low temperature and becomes
broad. The 1.1Ce-Al2O3 sample, Fig. 8(A-b), exhibits a very
small H2 consumption over a large temperature range.
According to literature data [29], the ﬁrst one at about
472 8C could be attributed to the reduction of surface oxygen
over CeO2, and the second one at 598 8C could be either the
result of the formation of a nonstoichiometric oxide CeO2x or
due to the formation of CeAlO3 which becomes thermo-
dynamically possible at this temperature.
Pt/Al catalyst, Fig. 8 (A-c), displays two reduction peaks,
one near 241 8C and the other near 467 8C. Two types of Pt
oxides are generally considered in the literature: one in a weak
interaction with the support and the other in a strong interaction
with the support [30–32]. The former can be reduced at low
temperatures and the latter requires higher temperatures.
Therefore, we could associate the hydrogen consumption at 241
and 467 8C to the reduction of the two types of platinum
species.

Concerning
Pt-Sn/Al
catalyst,
Fig.
8(A-d),
two
low
temperature reduction peaks are present, one at 263 8C, and
the other at 436 8C. The amount of H2 consumed in this process
is much higher than that required for the reduction of Pt oxides,
as reduction of SnO2 occurs concurrently at this low
temperature. The presence of Pt can notably assist the
reduction of SnO2 and can even lead to the formation of PtSn
alloy [33].
The TPR proﬁle for Pt/1.1Ce-Al catalyst, Fig. 8(A-e), is
dramatically different from that of 1.1Ce-Al sample. On one
hand, the presence of Pt effectively promotes the reduction of
surface oxygen and ceria species, judged by the shift of TPR
peaks to lower temperatures. Previous studies [34] show that
deposition of Pt on the surface of ceria causes easier reduction
of the surface of CeO2. This is because the presence of noble
metals can increase the oxygen storage capacity of CeO2 due to
noble metal–CeO2 interaction [35]. On the other hand, due to
the presence of ceria, the second reduction peak of Pt oxides
shifts to lower temperatures, from 467 to 432 8C. It indicates
that Pt may interact preferentially with CeO2 rather than with
Al2O3 [36,37]. The phenomenon that the presence of CeO2 on
Al2O3 promotes the reduction of Pt oxide species is also
reported by others [34].
It can be seen, from the curve of Fig. 8(A-f), that when the
three components of Pt, Sn and Ce coexist, the proﬁle of Pt-Sn/
1.1Ce-Al is different from that of Pt-Sn/Al catalyst. Only one
broad main reduction peak, from 260 to 560 8C, is observed.
The continuous reduction peaks indicate that strong interac-
tions between the three components take place. The overall
hydrogen consumption of Pt-Sn/1.1Ce-Al (about 0.058 mmol
H2/g cat), in the low temperature range (from 190 to 580 8C), is
much lower than that of Pt-Sn/Al (about 0.084 mmol H2/g cat).
These results could mean that the presence of CeO2 inhibits the
reduction of SnO2, which is consistent with former analysis
results that CeO2 can promote the reduction of platinum-oxide
species. According to previous studies that if SnO2 is reduced to
metal Sn and forms PtSn alloy, the activity of Pt will decrease
[11,12]. Therefore, over Pt-Sn/1.1Ce-Al catalyst, the reduction
hindrance of SnO2 may help to maintain the activity of Pt.
The TPR proﬁles of Pt-Sn/Ce-Al catalysts with different
cerium loading are shown in Fig. 8(B-g–i). It is seen that the
position of the TPR peaks depends on the amount of CeO2 and
therefore on the type and strength of the interactions between
supported Pt-oxide species, promoters and support. It becomes
very difﬁcult to resolve the proﬁles of those complicated
systems. With the increase of cerium loadings, the maximum
reduction peak for Pt oxide species shifts to lower temperatures.
The intensity of this peak also increases with the increase of
cerium concentration.
The TPR results show that addition of Ce to Pt-Sn/Al catalysts
results in the strong surface interactions which affect the surface
reducibility. Although, it is very difﬁcult to correctly analyze the
reducibility of each component of the complicated Pt-Sn/Ce-Al
system, the strong surface interactions could increase the ability
of Pt particles to resist agglomeration. Therefore, the high
stability of Pt-Sn/Ce-Al was maintained at elevated temperature
and regeneration conditions.
3.5.5. CO adsorption analysis
The interactions between platinum sites and promoters should
change the electronic environment of the surfaces of Pt atoms.
The electronic state of the surface of platinum atoms was
characterized by CO probe molecules via adsorption. The IR
spectra of CO chemisorbed on the Pt-supported catalysts are
shown in Fig. 9. According to some observations in literature
[38,39], the bands in the frequency region of 2100–1950 cm1
can be related to CO linearly bonded to one surface-exposed
metal Pt atom. The infrared spectra for all Pt-supported catalysts
show a main peak in the range of 2074–2060 cm1. From Fig. 9,
it is clear that addition of Sn results in a shift of +13 cm1
compared to Pt/Al (from 2060 to 2073 cm1). This result is in
agreement with IR results already published [40]. A similar trend
is observed for the Pt/1.1Ce-Al catalyst. That wave numbers
shifted to a higher frequency due to addition of Ce to Pt/Al was
also reported by other authors [41]. The highest frequency of
2074 cm1 is observed for the Pt-Sn/1.1Ce-Al catalyst.
The modiﬁcation of the main band can be caused by the
changes of electronic environment and morphology of the
surface of the platinum particles. There are different factors
which inﬂuence the change in the electron density of platinum
metal. According to the classic model of Blyholder [42] about
the bonding of CO molecules to metal surfaces, in smaller
platinum particles the average number of platinum bonds per
platinum atom is lower than in larger particles. Therefore, a
higher metal electron density is available for back-donation into
the 2p orbital of CO molecules, leading to a decrease in the C–
O bond strength and a lowering of the CO adsorption frequency.
This model was conﬁrmed by other studies on a mono-Pt/Al2O3
sample [43]. Wave numbers shifting to a higher frequency can
be interpreted as a decrease in electronic density of the
platinum atoms. However, according the data of dispersion, the
Pt particles over Pt-Sn/Al and Pt/1.1Ce-Al catalysts are smaller
than those of the Pt/Al catalyst. The IR result is divergent

because the electron density is higher for larger Pt particles (for
Pt/Al) and the electron density is lower for smaller Pt particles
(for Sn-Pt/Al). One reasonable explanation would be that the
electronicenvironment of surface Ptatoms isaffectednotonlyby
the size of Pt particles but also by the interactions between Pt and
the promoters. The interactions between Pt and Ce oxides and/or
Sn oxides lead to Pt atoms in a more unsaturated coordination
state (Ptd+). The lowest electron density of Pt atoms is observed
over Pt-Sn/1.1Ce-Al catalyst, which is probably caused by
electron transfer from Pt atoms to promoters. A change in the
electronic properties of the Pt via electron withdrawal by the
Sn(II) ions leading to the positively charged Pt, was also reported
by other authors [44–46].
3.5.6. Coke analysis
Coke is one of the most important factors for the
dehydrogenation performance of the catalyst. Coke over used
catalysts was characterized by TPO and O2-pulse experiments.
The typical TPO proﬁles for three coked catalysts are shown in
Fig. 10. It can be seen that although three samples show mainly
one peak of CO2, the temperature for each main peak is greatly
different. The lowest temperature of 393 8C is observed over the
Pt-Sn/1.1Ce-Al catalyst, which means that the deposited carbon
isthe most reactive overthe Pt-Sn/1.1Ce-Alcatalyst.Theamount
of coke on each catalyst is shown in Table 3. The highest amount
of coke is observed over the Pt/1.1Ce-Al catalyst. It shows that
addition of Ce to Pt/Al catalyst could not decrease the amount of
coke, but the presence of Sn could suppress the reaction of coke,
which is related to the above conclusions that the amount of
strong acidity sites on Pt/1.1Ce-Al catalyst is higher than that on
Pt-Sn/Al catalyst. The poor stability and selectivity of propylene
over Pt/Al and Pt/1.1Ce-Al catalysts is related to the high amount
of coke over those catalysts. Coke can physically block active
sites, resulting in the loss of activity. The Pt-Sn/3.3Ce-Al catalyst
shows the lowest amount of coke.
The amount of coke also depends on the cerium loading.
Higher cerium loading tends to decrease carbon deposition. A
similar result was reported by Wang and Lu [47]. It was
reported that the high oxygen storage capacity of ceria, caused
by the oxygen vacancies at the metal–oxide interface of reduced
ceria can decrease the coke formation over the catalyst surface
[48]. The high reactivity of coke over the Pt-Sn/3.3Ce-Al
catalyst may be responsible for the low amount of coke. With
the prolongation of reaction time, an increase of coke is
observed. Over Pt-Sn/1.1Ce-Al catalyst, when reaction time
reaches 50 h, the amount of coke increases to 50 mg C/g cat.
The TPO and O2-pulse investigations imply that the presence of
cerium over Pt-Sn/Al catalyst can increase the reactivity of
coke and reduce the accumulation of coke.
3.5.7. H2-TPD analysis
The H2-TPD proﬁles of the fresh and recycled catalysts are
shown in Fig. 11. Usually, low temperature desorption peaks
are assigned to hydrogen on metallic Pt [49]. High temperature
desorption peaks are assigned to spillover hydrogen [50,51],
strong chemisorbed hydrogen [52] and hydrogen in subsurface
layers of the platinum [53]. It can be seen that, over the fresh
samples, addition of Ce to Pt-Sn/Al catalyst can greatly

promote its ability to adsorb hydrogen, especially in the high
temperature range. After the fourth recycle reaction, the ability
of metallic Pt in Pt-Sn/Al catalyst to adsorb hydrogen
drastically decreases. The amounts of hydrogen on metallic
Pt in the recycled Pt-Sn/Al catalyst are 22% of those in the fresh
Pt-Sn/Al catalyst and 20% of those in the recycled Pt-Sn/2.2Ce-
Al catalyst. On the Pt-Sn/2.2Ce-Al catalyst, the amounts of
hydrogen on metallic Pt do not show obvious changes before
and after the recycle reaction. The important reason for the
decrease in amounts of hydrogen on metallic Pt is the sintering
of Pt particles. It is obvious that Pt particles in the Pt-Sn/2.2Ce-
Al catalyst are much more stable than those in the Pt-Sn/Al
catalyst during recycle reactions. This indicates that the
agglomeration of Pt particles on the Pt-Sn/Al catalyst is more
serious than that on the Pt-Sn/2.2Ce-Al catalyst. The reason for
the poor activity of the Pt-Sn/Al catalyst after the third cycle
should be related to the low accessible metal surface area. Pt-
ceria and Ce-alumina interactions could affect the degree of Pt
sintering during calcination and reaction. Previous studies show
that base-metal oxides additives such as CeO2 can increase the
dispersion of a noble metal on Al2O3 and prevent the
agglomeration of dispersed Pt into discrete particles [54]. This
phenomenon has been attributed to a Pt–CeO2 interaction,
which helps to maintain Pt in an oxidized state leading to more
difﬁcult to sinter than metallic Pt [55]. It has been postulated
[34] that an interaction between Pt and cerium results in
withdrawal of electrons from the noble metal similar to Rh on
CeO2 [56], which are consistent with our IR results.
4. Conclusions
Pt-Sn/Ce-Al catalysts, with cerium loadings in the range of
1.1–3.3 wt.%, exhibit a highly efﬁcient performance for
propane dehydrogenation to propylene. Over Pt-Sn/1.1Ce-Al
catalyst, we could keep >38% of propane conversion, >98%
propylene selectivity and >37% propylene yield over 50 h for
the reaction of propane dehydrogenation to propylene at
576 8C.
Furthermore,
Pt-Sn/Ce-Al
catalysts
display
the
remarkable stability in elevated temperature and regeneration
conditions. BET and XRD measurements show that the
presence of cerium could stabilize the texture of the support.
TPR, CO adsorption and H2-TPD measurements further reveal
that surface interactions take place over the Pt-Sn/1.1Ce-Al
catalyst, which could stabilize Pt particles. The low amounts of
coke and high thermal stability of Pt-Sn/Ce-Al catalysts are
mainly responsible for the high stability of dehydrogenation.
