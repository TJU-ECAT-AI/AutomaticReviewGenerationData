The gap between supply and demand of propylene has become more and more evident, because of a large
consumption of the downstream products derived from propylene. Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) con-
stitutes an important alternative for the production of propylene, and thus considerable attention has
been paid to the development of eco-friendly and cost-efﬁcient catalysts for this process. Herein, we dis-
cover that the Sn-Beta zeolite with Lewis acid sites can activate the C-H bond, and exhibits high catalytic
performance in the PDH. XRD, STEM, and XPS characterizations conﬁrm that Sn species are incorporated
into the zeolite framework, and H2-TPR suggests that there is a strong interaction between Sn species and
zeolite framework. It is found that the Lewis acid is the active site for dehydrogenation reaction, and the
Brønsted acid is responsible for cracking reaction. The dehydrogenation rate/cracking rate is positively
proportional to the L/B ratio, and a high L/B ratio is beneﬁcial for the propane dehydrogenation reaction.
The Na-Sn-Beta-30 catalyst possessing the highest amount of Lewis acid but the lowest Brønsted/Lewis
ratio, exhibits the best performance in the PDH, which delivers propane conversion of 40% and propylene
selectivity of 92%. Most importantly, these Sn-Beta zeolites are extremely stable without any detectable
deactivation under the harsh reaction condition for 72 h. Density functional theory calculations reveal
that both Sn and adjacent O atom or OH group cooperatively act as the active sites. The PDH occurs
through the direct reaction mechanism in which hydrogen molecule is produced by the direct coupling
of H atom of primary C3H7 motif with the Brønsted proton in closed sites or the proton of water in open
sites. It seems that open sites are more reactive than the closed ones, and the intrinsic enthalpy barriers
are calculated to be 242 ~ 301 kJ/mol depending on the hydroxylation extents. These efﬁcient Sn-Beta
zeolites could provide a new possibility for the development of a new generation of PDH catalysts with
a high stability for the production of propylene.

1. Introduction
The global propylene market has increased steadily in the last
few decades, and is estimated to still grow in the coming years
due to a large consumption of the downstream products (such as
polypropylene, acrylonitrile, acrylic acid, oxo-alcohols, propylene
oxide, and cumene) derived from propylene [1]. The gap between
supply and demand becomes increasingly wide, which has greatly
promoted the development of new technologies for the production
of propylene [2,3]. So far, the Oleﬁn metathesis, methanol-to-
oleﬁns, and propane dehydrogenation emerge as the typical on-
purpose technologies for the production of propylene [4–7].
Among these technologies, propane dehydrogenation attracts
much attention in the current industrial context, because the
cheap propane is widely available from abundant shale gas [8,9].
Furthermore, high selectivity to propylene can be achieved with
the valuable H2 as the by-product in the propane dehydrogenation
process.
In fact, the catalytic propane dehydrogenation process has been
commercialized with the Catoﬁn (Lummus) and Oleﬂex (UOP)
technologies, which are based on CrO3/Al2O3 and Pt-Sn/Al2O3 cata-
lysts, respectively [3,10]. The main drawback of Pt-based catalyst is
its high cost and a rapid deactivation arising from the sintering of
Pt particles. To re-disperse Pt species, this catalyst always requires

containing compounds [11–13]. The concern about the toxicity of
CrO3/Al2O3 to public health largely limits its practical application.
According to the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administra-
tion, exposure to Cr(VI) may bring about several diseases [14]. In
such a case, much effort has been dedicated to the development
of eco-friendly and cost-efﬁcient catalysts for the production of
propylene from propane dehydrogenation [15–17].
Recently, the propane dehydrogenation over single-site cata-
lysts has received considerable interest, and the well-deﬁned
structure in the single-site catalysts allows to easily elucidate the
reaction pathway [18–29]. Loading metal species onto metal oxide,
such as SiO2 and Al2O3, is a common way for the fabrication of
single-site catalysts, and the obtained isolated metal oxide species
deliver high performance in propane dehydrogenation reaction
[21–25,27]. A high selectivity to propylene above 95% can be
achieved in the silica-supported single-site Zn(II) catalyst for pro-
pane dehydrogenation reaction, and in-situ characterization stud-
ies reveal that single-site Zn(II) ions located in the strained
three-membered siloxane rings on the amorphous silica surface
are the active site for propane dehydrogenation reaction [22,25].
The single-site Co2+ on SiO2 with a tetrahedral coordination also
exhibits high selectivity > 95% at 550 C with stable activity over
24 h for propane dehydrogenation. Calculations with hybrid den-
sity functional theory suggests a non-redox mechanism for activa-
tion of C-H and H-H bonds by Co2+ similar to the pathway of single-
site Zn2+/SiO2 [27]. The mononuclear alumina-supported single-
site Ga sites show much higher activity in propane dehydrogena-
tion than their dinuclear silica-supported counterparts, and the
propane dehydrogenation reaction requires the presence of Al-O-
Ga bonds to promote heterolytic C-H bond activation [23,24].
The incorporation of metal species into zeolite lattice or frame-
work has been conﬁrmed to be another effective strategy for the
construction of single-site catalyst [26,28], and the isolated metal
species in zeolite display enhanced stability due to the strong
anchoring effect of the framework structure. The iron-silicate zeo-
lites show high performance in propane dehydrogenation reaction,
and a redox catalytic cycle occurring over the isolated or single-site
Fe framework sites in Fe-zeolites for the formation of propane rad-
ical cations is suggested to the reaction mechanism in propane
dehydrogenation [28]. The Sn-Beta zeolite, which contains the
single-site Sn atoms isomorphously substituted in the BEA frame-
work and possesses an open pore system consisting of 3-
dimensional 12-membered ring channels, has gained great appli-
cations in catalytic biomass conversion for the C-C bond coupling
and

Meerwein-Ponndorf-
Verley Reduction (MPV) reduction, Diels-Alder cycloaddition and
glucose-fructose isomerization [30,31]. As a matter of fact, the
Sn-Beta zeolite was applied in the propane dehydrogenation reac-
tion in our previous report [32]. Nevertheless, the Sn-Beta shows
negligible activity in the reaction and it only acts as support and
promotor for the Pt component [32–34]. Interestingly, in this study
we discover that Sn-Beta zeolite is able to activate the C-H bond of
propane at a high temperature, and it exhibits high selectivity,
good activity, and excellent stability in propane dehydrogenation.
Theoretical calculations suggest that the propane dehydrogenation
takes place on the Lewis acid sites arising from the single-site Sn in
the zeolitic framework.
2. Experimental
2.1. Catalysts preparation
Sn-Beta zeolites were synthesized via a well-established two-
step post-synthesis procedure, which is composed of the dealumi-
nation of parent H-Beta and then incorporation of Sn species into
the framework of dealuminated Si-Beta through an impregnation
process [35,36]. In a typical synthesis, commercial Beta zeolite
with a nominal nSi/nAl ratio of 13.5 was stirred in a 13 mol L-1 nitric
acid aqueous solution (20 ml g zeolite-1) at 100 C overnight to
obtain a dealuminated Beta (Si-Beta). The powder was ﬁltered,
washed thoroughly with deionized water, and dried at 180 C over-
night. 1.0 g of the solid powder was impregnated with SnCl2 solu-
tion with the nSn/nSi ratios of 1/15, 1/30, and 1/60, respectively. The
solid mixture was transferred into a furnace, and the resulting
sample was heated to 600 C in the ﬂow of air using a heating rate
of 5 C/min and then held at 600 C for 4 h. The obtained products
were labeled as Sn-Beta-15, Sn-Beta-30, and Sn-Beta-60, and the
number in the name indicates the nominal Si/Sn ratios. The Sn-
Beta were converted to Na-Sn-Beta by ion-exchange with 1 M NaCl
solution at room temperature for 48 h. After ion-exchange the
samples were washed with distilled water to remove chloride ions,
dried at 100 C, and calcined in the air at 600 C to obtain Na form
zeolite. For comparison, SnO2/Al-Beta samples (nSn/nSi ratios of
1/15, 1/30, and 1/60) were synthesized by direct impregnation of
Al-Beta with SnCl2 solution.
2.2. Catalyst characterization
X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of samples were recorded on a
Rigaku D/max-2550 PC diffractometer with Cu Ka radiation (k = 1.
5406 Å,40 kV,40 mA) from 5 to 50 with a scan speed of 2h = 8.0/
min.
Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectra of catalyst were
acquired on a Nicolet 6700 FT-IR spectrometer, and the spectra
were collected in a wavenumber range of 400–4000 cm1 at a res-
olution of 4 cm1. The spectra were recorded in dry air against KBr
as background.

measured
at

C
using
a
Micromeritics@ ASAP2420 instrument. Prior to the measurement,
the samples were degassed in a vacuum for 2 h at 300 C The sur-
face area was calculated by the BET method, and the average pore
size was determined by the BJH method.
The chemical compositions of samples were determined by
inductively coupled plasma emission spectrometry (ICP-AES) on
a Thermo IRIS Intrepid II XSP atomic emission spectrometer.
The catalyst samples were dispersed on a Cu mesh with carbon
microgrid for TEM/STEM characterization. TEM and STEM observa-
tions were made by aberration-corrected TEM/STEM (FEI Titan3 G2
60–300). The accelerating voltage used was 300 kV. Elemental
mapping and line scan analyses were conducted in HAADF-STEM
mode with drift correction applied. The noise due to the scanning
electron probe in STEM images is reduced by simply smoothing out
the pixels using the image analysis software Digital Micrograph.
X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements were
done with a PHI Quantum 2000 XPS System with a monochromatic
Al KR source and a charge neutralizer; all the binding energies
were referenced to the C 1 s peak at 284.8 eV of the surface adven-
titious carbon.
The experiments of temperature-programmed reduction by
hydrogen (H2-TPR) were performed using a Quantachrome Chem-
BET 3000 chemisorption analyzer. The sample was treated in He at
400 C for 1 h and cooled down to room temperature in ﬂowing He.
Afterward, the sample was heated in 8% H2/He to 800 C at a rate of
10 C min1.
Py-IR characterization methods were performed using a VER-
TEX 70v FTIR spectrometer. The catalyst samples were pressed into
self-supporting disks. The sample cell was evacuated at 400 C for
2 h; the background spectrum was measured after the sample cell
was cooled down to room temperature. Pyridine vapor was intro-
duced into the sample cell for 0.5 h at room temperature. FTIR

spectra were taken after the sample cell was evacuated at elevated
temperatures. The amounts of the Brønsted and Lewis acid sites
were calculated from the following method: CBrønsted sites = 1.88IA
(B)R2/W; CLewis sites = 1.42IA(L)R2/W. C = concentration (mmol/g
catalyst); IA(B, L) = integrated absorbance of B or L band (cm1);
R = radius of catalyst disk (cm); W = weight of disk (mg) [37].
2.3. Catalytic reaction
The evaluation of the catalytic performance of Sn-Beta for pro-
pane dehydrogenation was conducted at 630 C and atmospheric
pressure. All samples were pelletized, crushed, and sieved to obtain
catalyst particles about 200–400 lm. 1 g of catalyst pellet was
loaded into a quartz tube ﬁxed-bed reactor with the quartz wool
as support. Before the reaction, the sample was pretreated in a ﬂow
of N2 at 630 C for 1 h. A feed mixture of 20 mol % C3H8/80 mol % N2
was introduced into the reactor with a ﬂow rate of 20 ml/minute.
The measurement of activation energy of PDH was carried out
from 600 to 650 C with 0.1 g of Na-Sn-Beta-30 catalyst and a ﬂow
rate of 8 ml/minute (20% propane). The measurement of reaction
order of PDH was performed at 630 C with 0.1 g of Na-Sn-Beta-
30 catalyst and a ﬂow rate of 60 ml/minute, and the propane con-
centration was varied from 2% to 10% to get different levels of reac-
tion rate.
An online GC equipped with a ﬂame ionization detector (FID)
and a thermal conductivity detector (TCD) was used to analyze
the products in the propane dehydrogenation. The by-products
formed in the reaction are CH4, C2H4, and C2H6. The carbon balance
in the reaction was evaluated by comparing the number of moles
of carbon in the outlet stream to the number of moles of carbon
in the feed. The carbon balance in H-Beta is about 90%, and the
low carbon balance in this catalyst is due to the formation of a
large amount of carbon. The carbon balance in the Sn-Beta samples
is above 98%, which is acceptable for the calculation of conversion
and selectivity. The propane conversion and propylene selectivity
were calculated from following equation: propane conversion (%)
=([FC3H8]in-[FC3H8]out)/[FC3H8]in; propyleneselectivity (%) = [FC3H6]out/
([FC3H8]in-[FC3H8]out). The blank test in the absence of catalyst was
also performed, and it was found that the propane conversion is
below 3% and the products mainly come from cracking reaction.
Therefore, the gas phase reaction is negligible in the catalytic reac-
tion system.
2.4. Computational methods and modeling
All periodic density functional theory (DFT) calculations were
carried out using the Vienna Ab initio Simulation Package (VASP
5.3.5) [38]. The Bayesian error estimation functional with vdW cor-
relation (BEEF-vdW) was employed [39]. The electron–ion interac-
tion was described by the projector augmented wave (PAW)
method [40 41]. The plane wave basis set kinetic energy cutoff
was 400 eV. The sampling of Brillouin zone was only with Gamma
point. The dimer method was utilized to locate transition states
[42]. A force threshold of 0.02 eV/Å was used for structure opti-
mization of all intermediates and transition states.
The Sn-Beta was modeled by a periodic 64T cell, and the lattice
constants (a = 12.63 Å, b = 12.63 Å, c = 26.57 Å) were optimized
using 800 eV energy cutoff and 0.01 eV/Å force threshold. One of
the Si atom at the T2 site was substituted by Sn atom to produce
the closed Lewis acid sites for the reaction, and its adjacent Si
atoms were then gradually hydroxylated to model different open
sites and silanol nests (see Fig. 1). It has been previously revealed
that the Sn atoms locate at T2 sites using hydrothermal synthesis,
and the preferred sites of Al in H-Beta are also T2 for Sn substitu-
tion using dealumination post-synthesis [43,44]. All atoms in the
cell were allowed to relax with the lattice constants being ﬁxed.
The harmonic frequency calculations employed a partial Hessian
vibrational analysis (PHVA), including Sn and one adjacent active
O atom in closed sites or adjacent OH groups in open sites, and
organic species part of involved states. Such harmonic frequencies
were used to validate TS structures and zero point energy (ZPE)
calculations.
3. Result and discussion
3.1. Synthesis of Sn-Beta zeolites
The exploitation of Sn-Beta zeolites by the incorporation of Sn
(IV) into the BEA framework structure, has been regarded as a
big progress in the development of environmental-friendly solid
Lewis acid catalysts for sustainable chemistry [45–47]. Neverthe-
less, the application of Sn-Beta zeolite is greatly limited by the dif-
ﬁculties in synthesizing this material, particularly the use of
hydroﬂuoric acid with a long crystallization time [48]. To reduce
the crystallization time, seed-assisted growth method was applied
to the synthesis of Sn-Beta [49], and however the use of seed will
increase the cost of synthesis. In such a case, the indirect synthesis
was developed and proven to be a feasible route for the synthesis
of Sn-Beta zeolite. The indirect synthesis of Sn-Beta involves two
basic steps: (1) removal of Al atoms from the zeolite framework
structure to generate the lattice defects, (2) incorporation of Sn
atoms into the vacancies to form Sn containing zeolite [35,36].
The crystalline Al-Beta zeolite with a nSi/nAl ratio of 13.4 was
used as a precursor for the synthesis of Sn-Beta zeolite (Figure S1
and S2). As evidenced by 27Al NMR characterization, most Al atoms
are incorporated into the zeolite framework and exist as a tetrahe-
dral coordination structure (Figure S3). The efﬁciency of the dealu-
mination greatly affects the subsequent Sn atoms incorporation
process, so an attempt was made by the treatment of Al-Beta with
different concentrations of HNO3 (2.3 M, 7.0 M, and 13.0 M) to
remove Al from its structure. ICP analysis on the samples treated
with 2.3 M and 7.0 M HNO3 shows that the nSi/nAl ratios still keep
at low levels of 16.5 and 40, which indicates that atom in Beta zeo-
lite cannot be effectively removed in the dealumination process.
However, when the Al-Beta is treated with 13.0 M HNO3 acid,
the nSi/nAl ratio decreases to a high level of 450.3. XRD and N2
adsorption characterizations on the Sn-Beta(13.0 M HNO3) sample
indicates that its crystalline structure and pore architecture are
well maintained (Figure S1 and S2). Therefore, the treatment of
Al-Beta with a high concentration of HNO3 is beneﬁcial to the
removal of Al atoms from the zeolite framework, and 13.0 M
HNO3 was used for the dealumination process.
3.2. Characterization of Sn-Beta zeolites
Sn-Beta zeolites with different Sn/Si ratios obtained from two
steps were investigated with XRD characterization, to verify the
possible structural changes in the post-synthesis procedures. As
shown in Fig. 2, all the samples exhibit characteristic peaks located
at 2h of 7.6 and 22.6, which correspond to (101) and (302) reﬂec-
tions of BEA topology, respectively [50,51]. Moreover, the diffrac-
tion peak relevant to SnO2 is not detectable in all Sn-Beta
samples [52], which suggests that no bulk SnO2 phase is formed
after the loading of Sn species into Beta zeolite structure. The fea-
ture structure of these samples can be further investigated by IR
spectra (Figure S4). All the samples display strong peaks at 820–
750 cm1 and 1000–1100 cm1. The adsorption at 820–750 cm1
is assigned to the O-T-O (T = Si or Sn) symmetric stretching vibra-
tion mode, and characteristic vibration at 1000–1100 cm1 is
ascribed to the ﬁve- and six-membered rings of T-O-T in the struc-
ture of zeolite Beta [53,54]. Based on XRD and IR analysis, it can be

concluded that the incorporation of Sn species into Beta zeolite
structure has no evident effect on its structure.
The nitrogen adsorption isotherms of these samples are shown
in Fig. 3, and the calculated surface area and pore volume are sum-
marized in Table 1. Indeed, Sn-Beta, and H-Beta samples exhibit
the typical adsorption behavior of microporous material with a
classic type I isotherm. A sharp increase in nitrogen uptake at a rel-
atively low pressure is observed in these samples, which can be
ascribed to the nitrogen ﬁlling within the micropore. Apart from
the micropore adsorption at the low pressure, a signiﬁcant uptake
is observable at the P/P0 range above 0.7, which is due to the pres-
ence of inter-particle mesopores[55]. Surface area and pore volume
estimated from nitrogen adsorption isotherms (Table 1) show that
Sn-Beta samples possess high microporous volumes (~0.16 cm3/g)
and large surface area (410–490 m2 g1) as that of parent Beta zeo-
lite, which indicates that the textural properties of Beta zeolite are
well preserved in these Sn-Beta samples [36]. An element analysis
on these samples was carried out with the ICP technique. After
incorporation of Sn, the actual nSn/nSi ratio determined by ICP is
close to the desired value, conﬁrming the post-synthesis method
is an efﬁcient strategy for the preparation of Sn(IV)-containing Beta
zeolites.
The microstructure of the Sn-Beta zeolite can be visually
reﬂected from electronic microscopy characterization. The TEM
and STEM characterizations were carried out on a typical Sn-
Beta-30 sample, in order to know the morphology and elemental
distribution in its structure (Figs. 4 and 5). The TEM images in
Fig. 4 show that the shape of Beta zeolite crystal is not well-
deﬁned, and particle size ranges from 200 to 400 nm. The TEM
under the high magniﬁcation indicates that the big particles
observed in the low magniﬁcation are not a single crystal, which
is actually the polycrystal consisting of small nanocrystals around
30–50 nm. The irregular of Beta zeolite in its morphology is
ascribed to the coexistence of three polytypes in its crystalline
structure with different ratios [56]. It should be noted that no evi-
dent particles or clusters relative SnO2 phase is detectable in TEM
of Sn-Beta, which indirectly suggests that the Sn species is incorpo-
rated into Beta zeolite framework. An energy-dispersive X-ray
(EDX) elemental mapping in the STEM analysis conﬁrms that Si,
O, and Sn elements are homogeneously distributed in the Sn-
Beta sample (Fig. 5). Note that there is no evident phase separation
among these three elements. It can be therefore inferred that Sn
species are uniformly dispersed in Beta zeolite structure, and most
probably the Sn species enters into zeolitic framework and exists
as isolated or single-site Sn.
TEM characterization was also carried out on a typical SnO2/Al-
Beta-30 sample, which is obtained via a direct impregnation of Al-
Beta with SnCl2 solution. Figure S5 shows that lots of nano-
particles from 5 to 20 nm are observable at the surface of Al-
Beta. Further EDS analysis on a representative particle conﬁrms
the formation of SnO2 at the surface of Al-Beta (Figure S6). There-
fore, it can be concluded that the Sn species cannot be incorporated
into the zeolite framework if the Al-Beta zeolite is not treated with
acid, and a direct loading of Sn species onto Al-Beta zeolite leads to
the formation of bulk SnO2 particles at the surface of Al-Beta
zeolite.

496.2 eV can be assigned to 3d5/2 and 3d3/2 photoelectrons of
tetrahedrally coordinated framework Sn species [35]. The signals
at these two positions are observed in all samples, which suggests
that the Sn species in these samples were tetrahedrally coordi-
nated into the framework. It is well-known that the presence of
octahedrally coordinated Sn species at extra-framework position
in the zeolites gives two correlated peaks at 486.0 and 494.4 eV,
derived from the 3d5/2 and 3d3/2 photoelectrons of octahedral
Sn species [57,58]. This signal is not observable in these Sn-Beta
zeolites,
which
strongly
suggests
that
there
is
no
extra-
framework Sn species in the Sn-Beta zeolites. Further DRUV mea-
surement was carried out on these Sn-Beta samples, and the sharp
adsorptions around 220 nm strongly indicate that the Sn atoms are
incorporated into the zeolite framework (Figure S7).
The incorporation of Sn(IV) species into Beta zeolite structure
for the formation of single-site Sn can be further veriﬁed from
the H2-TPR analysis (Fig. 7). Evidently, the H2-TPR proﬁle of Sn-
Beta samples exhibits a broad reduction peak from 500 to 800 C
centered at about 650 C. The reduction peak is ascribed to the
reduction of Sn(IV) species into metallic Sn via a two-step
(Sn4+?Sn2+ and Sn2+?Sn) transformation [59]. The H2-TPR mea-
surement was also carried out on the SnO2/Al-Beta samples. The
reduction temperatures of Sn species in SnO2/Al-Beta-60, SnO2/
Al-Beta-30, and SnO2/Al-Beta-15 are 480, 570, and 580 C, respec-
tively (Figure S8), which are much lower than those in the Sn-Beta
samples[60]. Therefore, it can be concluded that Sn species in the
framework of Beta zeolite have a strong interaction with the

zeolite structure, because the Sn species in zeolitic lattice becomes
less reducible.
The incorporation of Sn species into the zeolite framework will
deﬁnitely change the acid property of Beta zeolite and thus create
some Lewis acid sites [61]. The catalytic performance of Sn-Beta is
essentially related to the nature of acidity in its structure, and
therefore pyridine was then employed as a probe molecule to
acquire detailed information on the amount and strength of differ-
ent acid sites in Sn-Beta samples. Pyridine as a base probe mole-
cule, can interact with both Brønsted and Lewis acid sites to give

and the band at around 1540 cm1 is considered as the Pyridine
adsorbed on Brønsted acid sites [62–64]. Fig. 8 shows that both
Brønsted and Lewis acid sites can be observed in all Beta samples,
and a quantitative analysis on the acid site density in Sn-Beta with
different Sn/Si ratios at 200 and 300 C is shown in Table 2. A high
level of both Brønsted and Lewis acidity is found in the H-Beta
sample.
However,
the
Brønsted
acid
largely
decreases
(241.4 lmol.g1 in H-Beta, 36.0 lmol.g1 in Sn-Beta-30) and the
Lewis acid (163.8 in H-Beta, 170.9 lmol.g1 in Sn-Beta-30) is well
kept, when the Sn species is incorporated into Beta zeolite. The
Brønsted acid in Sn-Beta can be further reduced to a low level of

15.8 lmol.g1 in Na-Sn-Beta-30, while the Lewis acid is still main-
tained at a high level of 170.2 lmol.g1 in Na-Sn-Beta-30. There-
fore, a general trend can be observed that the amount of Lewis
acid in H-Beta, Sn-Beta, and Na-Sn-Beta are identical, but the
amount of Brønsted acid follows a sequence of H-Beta > Sn-Beta >
Na-Sn-Beta. The lowest B/L ratio is achieved in the Na-Sn-Beta
samples (0.06 in Na-Sn-Beta-30), which allows them to be a unique
solid Lewis catalyst for catalytic application.
3.3. Propane dehydrogenation over Sn-Beta zeolites
The catalytic behaviors of these Beta catalysts in propane dehy-
drogenation reaction (Fig. 9). The H-Beta zeolite can activate pro-
pane and catalytically convert it into propylene, ethylene, ethane,
and methane. Nevertheless, the cracking products (selectivity of
52%) occupy the majority and less propylene (selectivity of 48%)
is produced. The cracking of propane results in a fast decrease of
conversion from 45% to 30% in 3 h. By contrast, Sn-Beta zeolites
exhibit improved stability in propane dehydrogenation reaction.
The catalytic performances of these Sn-Beta catalysts in the pro-
pane dehydrogenation become stable after a certain period, and
no evident loss of activity is observable in a long time-on-stream
reaction for 72 h. Note that an evident increase of propylene selec-
tivity is observed in Sn-Beta-60 sample, which is due to a decrease
of Bronsted acid for cracking reaction. The Sn/Si ratio in the zeolite
structure has a great effect on the catalytic performance of these
Sn-Beta samples. A small amount of Sn doping (Sn/Si = 1/60)
enables Beta zeolite to be a good catalyst for propane dehydro-
genation. A propane conversion of 27% and propylene selectivity
of 75% can be achieved in the Sn-Beta-60 catalyst. The increase
of the Sn/Si ratio to 1/30 leads to an obvious improvement in both
conversion and selectivity, and the obtained Sn-Beta-30 delivers
the propane conversion of 37% and selectivity of 80%. Further
increase of the Sn/Si ratio to 1/15 leads to a decrease of the conver-
sion to 31%, but the selectivity in the Sn-Beta-15 increases to 92%.
The efﬁciency of these three Sn-Beta catalysts can be demonstrated
from the propylene yield. The highest propylene yield of 30% can
be achieved in the Sn-Beta-30 catalyst, and thus the optimized
Si/Sn ratio in Sn-Beta zeolite for the propane dehydrogenation
should be around 30.
The spent H-Beta and Sn-Beta were studied with Raman and TG
analysis techniques. Two distinct peaks around 1350 cm1 (D
band) and 1580 cm1 (G band) can be observed in the Raman spec-
tra of the deactivated H-Beta (Figure S9 and S10), which are gen-
erally ascribed to the disordered graphitic lattice and ideal
graphitic lattice, respectively. By contrast, weak peaks relevant to
graphitic structure could be detected in the spent Sn-Beta catalyst,
which indicates that a small amount of coke was generated in
these catalysts. The amount of coke deposition in these two cata-
lysts can be quantiﬁed by the thermogravimetric (TG) analysis
(Figure S11). Estimated from the weight loss from 300 to 800 C,
about 25% of coke is generated in the spent H-Beta for propane
dehydrogenation reaction. Meanwile, the coke formation in H-
Beta zeolite leads to a signiﬁcant decrease of acid sites, and its
Lewis acid and Brønsted acid reduce to 7.8 lmol.g1 and
2.6 lmol.g1 at 300 C, and the loss of acid site leads to a fast deac-
tivation in the reaction. However, only about 2% weight loss is
observed above 300 C in the TG of the spent Sn-Beta-30, which
indicates that the coke formation is negligible in this catalyst.
Therefore, it can be concluded that Sn-Beta zeolite is a coking
resistant catalyst, which allows it to be a promising catalyst for
practical applications.

Based on the propane transformation over H-Beta and Sn-Beta
zeolites, it is reasonable to propose that the Lewis acid is the active
site for dehydrogenation reaction, and the Brønsted acid is respon-
sible for cracking reaction [65]. A conversion versus selectivity was
achieved by changing the space velocity on these Sn-Beta samples
(Figure S12-15), and it is found that the propane selectivity almost
keeps unchanged with an increase of propane conversion. There-
fore, the propane dehydrogenation over these Sn-Beta catalyst
takes place via a parallel reaction pathway, which can be depicted
in Scheme 1. On the basis of this assumption, it is reasonable that a
high L/B ratio is beneﬁcial to attaining a high propylene selectivity.
Indeed, the dehydrogenation rate/cracking rate which can be esti-
mated from propylene selectivity (equals to SC3H6/(1- SC3H6)) in
these samples can be correlated with L/B ratios measured from
IR-Py characterization (Fig. 10). The dehydrogenation rate/cracking
rate is positively proportional to the L/B ratio, and a high L/B ratio
is helpful for the propane dehydrogenation reaction.
As revealed in the study above, Sn-Beta-30 possessing the high-
est Lewis acid but the lowest B/L acid ratio exhibits the best perfor-
mance in propane dehydrogenation, and therefore the catalytic
activities of these Sn-Beta zeolites can be correlated to the strong
Lewis acidity arising from single-site Sn in the zeolitic framework.
To further prove this hypothesized structure–activity relationship,
the Na-Sn-Beta which was obtained by a simple Na+ exchange with
Sn-Beta zeolite, was also evaluated in propane dehydrogenation
reaction. In comparison to the parent Sn-Beta zeolite, the amount
of Lewis acid in the Na-Sn-Beta is kept almost unchanged but the
Brønsted acid is signiﬁcantly reduced, which leads to a large
decrease of B/L ratio. It is quite interesting that the Na-Sn-Beta
shows an enhanced catalytic performance in propane dehydro-
genation, especially for Na-Sn-Beta-30 and Na-Sn-Beta-60 samples
(Fig. 11). The propane conversion over these Na-Sn-Beta zeolites
remains
unaltered,
but
the
propylene
selectivity
is
greatly
increased to 93% in Na-Sn-Beta-30 and Na-Sn-Beta-60 samples.
The propylene production rate is positively linked to the amount
of Lewis acid in these Na-Sn-Beta catalysts (Figure S16), and it
can be expressed as: rpropylene (lmol.g1.minute-1) = 1.48*k, k = den-
sity of Lewis acid site (lmol.g1). The studies of Na-Sn-Beta and
Sn-Beta in propane dehydrogenation undoubtedly conﬁrmed that
the Lewis acid rather than Brønsted acid is the active site for pro-
pane dehydrogenation.
Further kinetic studies were performed on the optimized Na-
Sn-Beta-30 catalyst at relatively low propane concentration with
the conversion below 10%. The Arrhenius plot of propane dehydro-
genation reaction from 600 to 650 C is shown in Figure S17, and
the calculated activation energy equals to 221 kJ/mol which is con-
sistent with the following theoretical calculation. The reaction
order in propane is calculated as the slope of lg(propane converting
rate) versus lg(C0) plot as shown in Figure S18, and the measured
propane reaction order is 1.1.
The formation of Lewis acid in Sn-Beta zeolite is mainly attrib-
uted to the incorporation of Sn species into the zeolitic framework
to create single-site Sn, and the isolated Sn atoms are responsible
for propane dehydrogenation reaction. To verify the crucial role
of single-site Sn in propane dehydrogenation, the reference cata-
lysts SnO2/Al-Beta were also studied in propane dehydrogenation.

These SnO2/Al-Beta zeolites were prepared by a simple impregna-
tion of Al-Beta with the Sn precursor solution followed by a calci-
nation. DRUV spectra of these samples exhibit a wide adsorption
from 200 nm to 300 nm with a shoulder peak at around 270 nm
(Figure S19), suggesting the presence of SnO2 domains in these
samples [32,33]. The pyridine IR experiments were carried out on
a typical SnO2/Al-Beta with Si/Sn ratio of 30. Results show that it
has much less Lewis acid site (23.1 lmol.g1 at 200 C and
11.0 lmol.g1 at 300 C) than Sn-Beta, but its Bronsted acid density
(248.9 lmol.g1 at 200 C and 168.2 lmol.g1 at 300 C) is close to
that of H-Beta zeolite. Therefore, it can be inferred that Sn species
are not incorporated into zeolite framework in this sample. These
SnO2/Al-Beta zeolites are active in propane dehydrogenation, and
the initial propane conversion is about 50% for SnO2/Al-Beta-30
and SnO2/Al-Beta-15 samples (Fig. 12). Nevertheless, a signiﬁcant
loss of activity is observed in these catalysts, which results in a
low level of conversion after 72 h. Moreover, these SnO2/Al-Beta
zeolites display a lower selectivity to propylene, in comparison to
Sn-Beta zeolites with the same Sn/Si ratio. The fast deactivation
of SnO2/Al-Beta catalysts in propane dehydrogenation could be
ascribed to the sintering of SnO2 particles at the surface of Beta
zeolite under the high reaction temperature. There is no strong
interaction between SnO2 particles and zeolite framework, because
these SnO2 particles are physically dispersed at the surface of Al-
Beta zeolite which can not resistant to the thermal treatment at
a high temperature of 630 C. On the contrary, the Sn species are
chemically incorporated into the zeolite framework and exist as
single-site Sn in the Sn-Beta catalysts. These tetracoordinated Sn
single atoms are intensively bonded to the zeolite framework,
which enables these Sn atoms to be highly stable under the harsh
reaction condition.
3.4. DFT calculation for propane dehydrogenation over Sn-Beta zeolite
The above experimental results have proved that the isolated Sn
atoms are located in the framework of Beta zeolite. It was previ-
ously proposed that both closed and open sites in zeolites may
act as the active center for the reactions [66]. Herein the periodic
DFT calculations were performed in Sn-Beta to elucidate the
detailed reaction mechanism and catalytic activity for the propane
dehydrogenation. Sn is located at T2 site of Beta structure model.
Both direct and indirect reaction pathways (see Scheme 2) were
ﬁrst addressed in closed active sites. In both pathways, one of
the H atom in propane was ﬁrst abstracted by O atom adjacent
to Lewis Sn Site acting as the Brønsted base, and the remaining
C3H7 motif bonds with Sn site. Then in the direct pathway, the sec-
ond H atom in the C3H7 motif attacks the H atom in the framework
to directly produce propylene and H2 molecule. While in the indi-
rect pathway, the C3H7 motif loses one H to bond with Sn atom
forming Sn-H moiety and propylene; ﬁnally H2 was produced by
the coupling of two H atoms respectively at Sn and O sites.

The calculated enthalpy diagram of both pathways in closed
sites is shown in Fig. 13, and the optimized transition state struc-
tures are depicted in Fig. 14. It should be noted that the preferred
pathways involve the intermediate of the primary C3H7 group,
while those involving the secondary C3H7 group are energetically
less favored (see Figure S20 and Table S1). Propane is ﬁrst adsorbed
at the intersection of two twelve-membered channels (M1) with
the adsorption enthalpy being 48 kJ/mol at 0 K. An enthalpy barrier
of about 251 kJ/mol was calculated for the ﬁrst dehydrogenation
(TS1) to form the primary C3H7 group bonded with the closed
Lewis Sn site. At the TS structure, the breaking C-H and forming
O-H distances are respectively 1.51 and 1.20 Å, and the forming
C-Sn bond distance is 2.46 Å. In the case of the second dehydro-
genation step of the direct pathway to produce propylene and H2
(TS2), the enthalpy barrier is 182 kJ/mol. At the TS structure, the
C-H bond distance in the C3H7 group is elongated from 1.10 to
1.49 Å and the O-H bond distance in the framework is elongated
from 0.98 to 1.53 Å, and the forming H-H distance is 0.84 Å. As
the ﬁrst dehydrogenation step is endothermic by about 118 kJ/mol,
the second dehydrogenation step is rate-determining and the over-
all enthalpy barrier of the direct pathway involving primary C3H7
intermediate is about 300 kJ/mol for propane dehydrogenation at
closed Lewis site in Sn-Beta. It should be noted that the overall
enthalpy barrier of the direct pathway involving the secondary
C3H7 motif is 359 kJ/mol (see Table S1); this is understandable as
the terminal CH2 group at the TS exhibits primary carbenium ion
feature.
In the case of the indirect dehydrogenation pathway in closed
sites, the second dehydrogenation of primary C3H7 group is highly
energy demanding, and the enthalpy barrier is 266 kJ/mol. The TS
(TS3) involves four-membered ring structure, and the breaking C-H
and forming Sn-H distances are respectively 1.74 and 1.91 Å.
Regarding the structure of M3 intermediate, Bader charge analysis
revealed that the H atom bonded with Sn is hydride with 0.98 e.
Finally, the enthalpy barrier for H-H coupling is 116 kJ/mol, and the
forming H-H distance is 1.08 Å with the breaking Sn-H and O-H
distances are respectively 1.97 and 1.21 Å (TS4). In the indirect
pathway involving primary C3H7 moiety, both the ﬁrst and second
dehydrogenation steps are endothermic, and the overall enthalpy
barrier is as high as 384 kJ/mol (~445 kJ/mol in the indirect path-
way involving secondary C3H7 group). Compared the overall
enthalpy barriers in both direct and indirect pathways, we could
conclude that the propane dehydrogenation proceeds via the direct
pathway through primary C3H7 motif bonded with Sn at closed
Lewis Sn-Beta sites.
According to the suggested direct reaction pathway for the pro-
pane dehydrogenation, we now in the position to elucidate the cat-
alytic activity of open Sn-Beta sites. Different structures of open
sites could be formed depending on the hydroxylation extents.
Herein, three open Sn sites with one to three hydroxyl groups,
namely, Sn(OH)1, Sn(OH)2, Sn(OH)3, were compared (see Fig. 1).
As shown in Fig. 13, the adsorption enthalpies of propane in three
open Sn-Beta structures are around 48 kJ/mol, similar to that in
closed structure as a result of the contribution from non-bond
vdW interaction. A monotonous decrease in the ﬁrst dehydrogena-
tion enthalpy barrier was observed from closed (251 kJ/mol) to
open sites (237 > 220 > 217 kJ/mol). Interestingly, the formed
intermediate M2 in open structure is more stable over 40 kJ/mol
than that in closed one; this may be attributed to the ﬂexibility
of open active sites and the hydrogen bond with adjacent silanol
nests. On the contrary, the second dehydrogenation enthalpy bar-
riers in open sites (211 ~ 235 kJ/mol) are higher than that in closed
one (182 kJ/mol). The overall enthalpy barriers in three open sites
are therefore around 242 ~ 296 kJ/mol depending on the hydroxy-
lation extents, and it seems open Sn(OH)2 sites exhibit the highest

activity for propane dehydrogenation in Sn-Beta. As a result, ﬁnely
tuning the local structure of Lewis Sn sites is essential to improve
the dehydrogenation activity.
4. Conclusion
A series of Sn-Beta catalysts with a unique single-site Sn struc-
ture are developed for propane dehydrogenation reaction to pro-
duce propylene. Full characterizations with XRD, STEM, XPS, H2-
TPR, and Py-IR techniques on these catalysts reveal that the Sn spe-
cies are incorporated into zeolite framework and exist as isolated
Sn single atoms. The Lewis acid in Sn-Beta is the active site for
dehydrogenation reaction, and the Brønsted acid is responsible
for cracking reaction. The dehydrogenation rate/cracking rate is
positively proportional to the L/B ratio, and a high L/B ratio is ben-
eﬁcial for the propane dehydrogenation reaction. The Na-Sn-Beta-
30 catalyst that possesses the highest Lewis acid but the lowest B/L
ratio delivers the best performance in propane dehydrogenation,
which gives propane conversion of 40% and propylene selectivity
of 92%. Most importantly, Sn-Beta zeolites are extremely stable
without any detectable deactivation in propane dehydrogenation
under the harsh reaction condition for 72 h. Theoretical calcula-
tions in closed Sn-Beta demonstrated that the direct pathway
rather than the indirect pathway is kinetically more feasible for
the dehydrogenation, and it seems that open sites are more reac-
tive than closed one depending on the hydroxylation extents.
These efﬁcient Na-Sn-Beta zeolites could provide a new possibility
for the development of a new generation of propane dehydrogena-
tion catalysts for the production of propylene.
