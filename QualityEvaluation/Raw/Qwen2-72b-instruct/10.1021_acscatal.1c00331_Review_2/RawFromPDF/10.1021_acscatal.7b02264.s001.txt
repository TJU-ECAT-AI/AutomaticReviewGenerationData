Experimental Procedures 
Materials:  
Mg(NO3)2·6H2O, SnCl4·5H2O, urea, and sodium citrate were all of analytical purity. [Pt(NH3)4](NO3)2 powder in 99.6% 
purity was purchased from Alfa-Aesar. The commercial γ-Al2O3 as support (in 40–60 meshes) was donated by Jiangsu 
Jingjing New Material Co., Ltd (China). 
 
Preparation:  
MgSnAl-LDHs was synthesized on the surface of γ-Al2O3 (denoted as MgSnAl-LDHs@Al2O3) according to the procedure 
described in our previous work,1 but with slight modification. Typically, 0.23 mmol of sodium citrate and 0.23 mmol of 
SnCl4·5H2O were dissolved in 0.50 mL deionized water to form a Sn4+-citrate solution. 10 mmol of Mg(NO3)2·6H2O and 40 
mmol of urea were dissolved in 4.5 mL deionized water to form a Mg2+-urea solution. Sn4+-citrate solution and Mg2+-urea 
solution were mixed well and then moved to a teflon autoclave with 5.0 g of γ-Al2O3. After aging at 120 oC for 12 h or 24h, 
the sample was filtrated, washed with deionized water till to neutrality, and dried at 70 oC overnight, to give MgSnAl-
LDHs@Al2O3 sample. Similar procedure was used to prepare MgAl-LDH@Al2O3 sample in the absence of Sn-citrate 
solution. Sn4+ was loaded on as-prepared MgAl-LDH@Al2O3 by incipient wetness impregnation method. 1.8 mL of 
SnCl4·5H2O acetone solution (the concentration of Sn4+ is 5.9 g L-1) was impregnated onto 2 g of MgAl-LDH@Al2O3 
support, then the sample was oscillated for 2 h at ambient temperature and dried at 120 °C overnight. Pt2+ loading was 
achieved by incipient wetness impregnation method. 0.054 mmol, 0.10 mmol, or 0.20 mmol of [Pt(NH3)4](NO3)2 was 
dissolved in 1.8 mL of deionized water. Each Pt2+ solution (pH of 8) was then poured onto 2 g of as-prepared MgSnAl-
LDHs@Al2O3. The resulting sample was oscillated at ambient temperature for 2 h and dried at 120 oC overnight, affording 
Pt2+/MgSnAl-LDHs@Al2O3 with varied Pt loading. For comparison, Pt2+/MgAl-LDH@Al2O3 or Pt2+/Sn4+/MgAl-
LDH@Al2O3 was produced by loading Pt2+ (the concentration of Pt2+ is 5.2 g L-1 or 5.6 g L-1) on as-prepared MgAl-
LDH@Al2O3 or Sn4+-loaded MgAl-LDH@Al2O3 following the similar procedure to that for Pt2+/MgSnAl-LDHs@Al2O3. 
0.50 wt% Pt/Mg(Sn)(Al)O@Al2O3, 1.0 wt% Pt/Mg(Sn)(Al)O@Al2O3, 2.0 wt% Pt/Mg(Sn)(Al)O@Al2O3, 0.46 wt% 
Pt/Mg(Al)O@Al2O3, or 0.48 wt% Pt/SnOx/Mg(Al)O@Al2O3 was produced from the reduction-followed calcination of 
Pt2+/MgSnAl-LDHs@Al2O3, Pt2+/MgAl-LDH@Al2O3, or Pt2+/Sn4+/MgAl-LDH@Al2O3 (Pt loading was based on ICP-OES). 
The sample was temperature-programmed from ambient temperature to 600 oC with a rate of 2 oC min-1 and retained at 600 
oC for 2.5 h in a flowing air (40 mL min-1), and then a H2 flow (40 mL min-1) was introduced and the temperature was 
maintained at 600 oC for 2.5 h. 0.50 wt% Pt/Mg(Sn)(Al)O (without γ-Al2O3) or 0.50 wt% Pt/SnOx@Al2O3 (without LDHs) 
was produced following the above procedures. 0.50 wt% Pt/Mg(Sn)(Al)O@Al2O3 catalysts were also prepared under the 
reduction temperature of 550 oC and 650 oC.  
 
Characterizations:  
Elemental analysis for Pt, Sn, and Mg was performed using a Shimadzu ICPS-75000 inductively coupled plasma optical 
emission spectrometer (ICP-OES). Before the measurements, 30 mg of sample was put into a teflon autoclave with 5 mL of 
 
 
3 
nitromurlatic acid at 100 oC until completely dissolved. The solution was transferred to a 10-mL volumetric flask, and diluted 
with deionized water to volume.  
The low-temperature N2 adsorption–desorption experiments were carried out on a Quantachrome Autosorb-1 system. The 
specific surface area was estimated according to the five-point Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) method based on the 
adsorption isotherm. Before measurements, the samples were pretreated at 300 oC under high vacuum (104 Torr) for 6 h. 
Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were recorded with a Shimadzu XRD-6000 diffractometer (Cu Kα radiation, λ = 
0.154 nm) in the 2θ ranges of 3–90 o with a scan speed of 5 o min-1.  
The scanning electron microscope (SEM) images were taken on a Zeiss Supra55 (Zeiss Ltd., Germany). Samples were cut 
in half to expose interior surfaces and cross section.   
High-angle annular dark-field scanning (HAADF-STEM) images were taken on a JEM-ARM 200F electron microscope 
capable of sub-angstrom resolution. The samples were dispersed onto a copper grid coated with a thin holey carbon ﬁlm. The 
size distribution of Pt is based on at least 280 single atoms, clusters and particles in total counted in varied regions. The 
elemental analysis (mapping) of Pt and Sn were obtained by using HAADF-STEM of energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) mode. 
Quasi-in-situ 119Sn Mössbauer spectra were recorded in Dalian Institute of Chemical Physics, Chinese Academy of 
Sciences at room temperature in the transmission mode using 119Sn in the BaSnO3 as an emitter. All isomer shifts (IS) were 
given with respect to the BaSnO3 spectrum at room temperature. The effective thickness of all absorbers was in the 0.5-1.0 
mg 119Sn cm-2 range. Around 2 g of 0.50 wt% Pt/Mg(Sn)(Al)O@Al2O3 or 0.48 wt% Pt/SnOx/Mg(Al)O@Al2O3 was placed in 
a Mössbauer spectroscopy cell inside a glove box kept under high-purity Ar. The cell was then sealed by a valve bag in the 
glove box and transfered under vacuum package. All spectra were computer-fitted by Lorentzian curves with a least-squares 
fitting procedure.  
H2-TPR was carried out on a Micrometric ChemiSorb 2750 chemisorption system with a thermal conductivity detector 
(TCD). About 100 mg of sample was loaded in a U type quartz reactor. The TPR was carried out with a heating ramp rate of 
10 oC min-1 in a stream of 10 % H2 in Ar from 50 oC to 850 oC, with a total ﬂow rate of 40 mL min-1. Before TPR 
measurements, 
Pt2+/MgSnAl-LDHs@Al2O3, 
Pt2+/Sn4+/MgAl-LDHs@Al2O3, 
Pt2+/MgAl-LDHs@Al2O3, 
or 
MgAl-
LDHs@Al2O3 was calcined in air at 600 oC. 
Quasi-in-situ PtLIII-edge X-ray absorption (XAS) spectra were determined on the 1W1B beamline of the Beijing 
Synchrotron Radiation Facility (BSRF) operated at 2.2 GeV and 200 mA. A Si (111) double-crystal monochromator was 
used to reduce the harmonic component of the monochrome beam. All the samples were measured in the fluorescence mode. 
Before measurements, the as-prepared Pt catalysts were pretreated carefully to ensure that the reduced catalysts were not 
exposed to air. Specimens were made by directly applying the fine powders to Scotch tape inside a glove box kept under 
vacuum package, sealed by the valve bag. The X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) data were then measured 
immediately. 
X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS) were recorded on a Thermo Fisher Scientific ESCALAB-250 instrument (USA) with an 
excitation source of AlKa radiation. A C1s peak at 284.8 eV was used as a calibration peak. In addition to a binding energy 
scan range from 0 to 1200 eV for the identification of all detectable elements, detailed scans for chemical state identification 
and quantification were recorded. During the transfer, 0.50 wt% Pt/Mg(Sn)(Al)O@Al2O3 and 0.48 wt% 
 
 
4 
Pt/SnOx/Mg(Al)O@Al2O3, as-prepared or after short contact with the reactant gases, were sealed in high-purity N2 (99.99%) 
by the valve bag. 
In situ Fourier-transformed infrared (FT-IR) absorption spectra with propene adsorbed were carried out in a cell equipped 
allowing sample activation and successive measurements in the range of 173–773 K on a Vertex 70 (Bruker) instrument with 
4 cm-1 of resolution and 64 of scan times in Beijing Research Institute of Chemical Industry, Sinopec Group. The as-prepared 
0.5 wt% Pt/Mg(Sn)(Al)O@Al2O3 or 0.48 wt% Pt/SnOx/Mg(Al)O@Al2O3 (20 mg) was pressed into a disk and activated 
online in 10% H2/He at 773 K for 1 h, and then cooled to 233 K under vacuum. Backgrounds were collected at 233 K under 
vacuum. The sample was exposed to 5 % propene in He at 233 K for 30 min, and then the FT-IR spectra was recorded. Then 
evacuation was carried out at 233 K till no visible change in the absorption band intensities, and then the FT-IR spectra was 
recorded. The resulting spectra have deducted the background. 
Operando FT-IR experiments were carried out by exposing 0.50 wt% Pt/Mg(Sn)(Al)O@Al2O3 or 0.48 wt% 
Pt/SnOx/Mg(Al)O@Al2O3 in 1 % propane in Ar stream at 400 oC. The as-prepared 0.50 wt% Pt/Mg(Sn)(Al)O@Al2O3 or 0.48 
wt% Pt/SnOx/Mg(Al)O@Al2O3 (20 mg) was pressed into a disk and activated online in 10% H2/He at 500 oC for 1 h. The FT-
IR spectra were recorded intervals. The resulting spectra have deducted the absorption of gaseous propane and the 
background.  
In situ thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) measurements were performed to quantify the reduction of coke formation 
during an dehydrogenation of propane (DHP) reaction at 550ºC. 0.50 wt% Pt/Mg(Sn)(Al)O@Al2O3 or 0.48 wt% 
Pt/SnOx/Mg(Al)O@Al2O3 was exposed in a flow of 20 % propane in N2 at 550ºC. The sample weight change with time 
during the reaction was recorded. 
 
Catalytic tests:  
Catalytic tests were performed in a ﬁx-bed reactor with 10 mm inner diameter and 38 cm length under atmospheric 
pressure at 550 oC or 600 oC. The as-prepared Pt2+-loaded sample (0.4 g) was activated by air (20 mL min-1) at 600 oC for 2.5 
h online. After the temperature was held at 600 oC in N2 flow (40 mL min-1), a H2 flow (12 mL min-1) was introduced to 
reducing the sample at 600 oC for 2.5 h. Then, a reaction gas mixture with a volume ratio of C3H8:H2:Ar = 1:0.5:2 was passed 
through the catalyst bed. The weight hourly space velocity (WHSV) of propane was 14 h-1. The products were analyzed 
online with a gas chromatography (Shimadzu GC-2014C) equipped with a Rt-Alumina BOND/Na2SO4 capillary column 
and connected to a flame ionization detector (FID). The conversion of propane and the selectivity to particular product were 
determined by

The propane dehydrogenation/catalyst regeneration cycle tests at 600 °C were performed over 0.50 wt% 
Pt/Mg(Sn)(Al)O@Al2O3 and 0.48 wt% Pt/SnOx/Mg(Al)O@Al2O3. After the DHP reaction at 600 °C for 3 h (1st cycle), the 
catalyst was regenerated in a flowing air (20 mL min-1) at 600 °C for 55 min followed by a 5 min N2 purge step (60 mL min-
1), and reduced in H2 (12 mL min-1) at 600 °C for 1 h. Then the next DHP reaction was performed for a total of 10 
dehydrogenation-regeneration cycles.

Figure S1. XRD patterns of (a) γ-Al2O3, (b) MgAl-LDH@Al2O3, and (c) MgSnAl-LDHs@Al2O3. 
 
In each case, the (003), (006), (009), and (110) reflections characteristic of the hydrotalcite structure3 were visibly 
observed in the X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns (Figure S1). No other phases in addition to LDHs and γ-Al2O3 are resolved. 
The lattice parameter a for MgSnAl-LDHs increases by 0.003 nm in comparison to that for MgAl-LDH, indicating that SnIV 
cations are located in the hydrotalcite layers. In MgSnAl-LDHs, the mole rate of Mg/Sn is 12, which is a suitable content3 for 
Sn doping in the layer of MgAl-LHD. In the XRD patterns, no visible diffraction peak was observed at the 2θ range of 70o – 
90o.

Figure S8. Quasi-in-situ Pt LIII-edge XANES spectra of each Pt sample reduced.  
In the quasi-in-situ Pt LIII-edge X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) spectra (Figure S8), the white line (the 
large peak at the absorption edge) intensity increases in the following sequence: 0.50 wt% Pt/Mg(Sn)(Al)O@Al2O3 < 0.48 
wt% Pt/SnOx/Mg(Al)O@Al2O3 < 0.46 wt% Pt/Mg(Al)O@Al2O3. The white line results from the electron transition from 2p 
to 5d, and higher intensity of white line indicates larger electron vacancy in 5d orbital.4,5 So the difference in the intensity of 
white line observed here indicates that Sn component donates electrons to Pt, and the Sn species confined in Mg(Sn)(Al)O 
lattice (0.50 wt% Pt/Mg(Sn)(Al)O@Al2O3) donates electrons more than that in Pt/SnOx/Mg(Al)O@Al2O3.

Figure S10. Propane conversion and propene selectivity for 10 propane dehydrogenation/catalyst regeneration cycles over 
0.50 wt% Pt/Mg(Sn)(Al)O@Al2O3 (blue) and 0.48 wt% Pt/SnOx/Mg(Al)O@Al2O3 (red). Reaction conditions: 600 oC for 3h, 
C3H8/H2/Ar = 1/0.5/2, atmospheric pressure, and WHSV = 14 h-1. After each cycle, the catalysts were regenerated by flowing 
air at 600 °C for 55 min followed by H2 reduction at 600 °C for 1 h.

Figure S11. Sn 3d5/2 XPS spectra for (A) 0.50 wt% Pt/Mg(Sn)(Al)O@Al2O3 and (B) 0.48 wt% Pt/SnOx/Mg(Al)O@Al2O3: 
as-prepared (a), short contact (for 0.5 h) with reactant gases at 550 oC (b) and 600 oC (c).  
The binding energy around 485.4 eV corresponds to the Sn0 state, while the binding energy around 486.7 eV corresponds 
to the oxidized Sn state.6,7 Only SnII/IV states are observed in 0.50 wt% Pt/Mg(Sn)(Al)O@Al2O3 (both as-prepared and after 
short contact with reactant gases at 550 oC or 600 oC for 0.5 h). But for 0.48 wt% Pt/SnOx/Mg(Al)O@Al2O3, Sn0 is observed 
in 9 % or 10 % by area for the as-prepared or after short contact with reactant gases at 550 oC for 0.5 h, and increases to 27 % 
after short contact with reactant gases at 600 oC for 0.5 h.

Pt/Mg(Sn)(Al)O@Al2O3, 1.0 wt% Pt/Mg(Sn)(Al)O@Al2O3, and 2.0 wt% Pt/Mg(Sn)(Al)O@Al2O3. Reaction conditions: 550 
oC, C3H8/H2/Ar = 1/0.5/2, atmospheric pressure, and WHSV = 14 h-1.

Figure S13. In situ TGA measurements of coke formation on 0.50 wt% Pt/Mg(Sn)(Al)O@Al2O3 and 0.48 wt% 
Pt/SnOx/Mg(Al)O@Al2O3 at 550 oC in a flow of 20 % propane in N2. 
Coke formation was quantified by in situ thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) under the reaction conditions at 550°C. The 
sample weight increases by only 4 % due to coke deposition after 90 min on-stream on 0.50 wt% Pt/Mg(Sn)(Al)O@Al2O3 
while by 25 % on 0.48 wt% Pt/SnOx/Mg(Al)O@Al2O3.

Pt/Mg(Sn)(Al)O@Al2O3 reduced at 550 oC (red), 600 oC (yellow), and 650 oC (pink). Reaction conditions: 550 oC, 
C3H8/H2/Ar = 1/0.5/2, atmospheric pressure, and WHSV = 14 h-1. Sn (II)/[Sn (II)+ Sn (IV)]  is based on Sn 3d5/2 XPS resluts.

Figure S15. HAADF-STEM images with EDX element-mapping analysis of 0.48 wt% Pt/SnOx/Mg(Al)O@Al2O3: (a) fresh 
and (b) used in 240 h DHP reaction at 550 oC; (c) STEM image of 0.48 wt% Pt/SnOx/Mg(Al)O@Al2O3 used in 240 h DHP 
reaction at 550 oC. 
 
For the spent 0.48 wt% Pt/SnOx/Mg(Al)O@Al2O3, large Pt particles (> 10 nm) are observed, indicative of severe sintering 
of Pt. According to the lattice of 0.216 nm or 0.131 nm representing Pt1Sn1 (102) or Pt1Sn1 (102), the Sn sites here aggregate 
together with Pt sites by the formation of Pt-Sn alloy, rather than stabilize Pt clusters.
