1.Hydrogen cofeeding in the propane dehydrogenation (PDH) process has a positive effect on the catalyst performance, comparable to the addition of Sn, which increases both propane conversion and propene selectivity. Hydrogen alters the nature of the coke deposits formed during propane dehydrogenation, leading to the formation of smaller graphite crystallites with less defects. The addition of hydrogen to the feed either increases the amount of defects in the graphitic lattice or decreases the size of the graphitic crystallites. The increase in propane dehydrogenation conversion observed with increasing hydrogen concentration is related to the decreased deposition of coke. Initially, active sites are inhibited by coke, but sintering of the supported Pt nanoparticles may permanently inhibit these sites. The experiments with propane concentrations of 25 and 50% show a strong increase in selectivity for each consecutive cycle. For these specific experiments, less coke of a more graphitic nature is detected, suggesting a link between the presence of relatively disordered coke deposits and side reactions, such as cracking. In the presence of high concentrations of hydrogen, more graphitic coke is formed that mainly covers the catalyst support. In the absence of hydrogen, more disordered coke is formed, also present on the supported Pt nanoparticles. Hydrogen assists in keeping the surface of the Pt free of these disordered coke species. These effects of hydrogen on coke formation, catalyst stability, and reaction mechanisms have implications for the overall process efficiency and performance, as they can lead to increased conversion and selectivity, reduced catalyst deactivation, and improved stability.

1.在丙烷脱氢(PDH)过程中，氢气共进料对催化剂性能有积极影响，与添加Sn的效果相当，Sn可以同时提高丙烷转化率和丙烯选择性。氢气改变了丙烷脱氢过程中形成的焦炭沉积物的性质，导致形成缺陷较少的较小石墨结晶体。向进料中添加氢气要么增加石墨晶格中的缺陷数量，要么减小石墨晶格的尺寸。随着氢气浓度的增加，观察到的丙烷脱氢转化率的增加与焦炭沉积的减少有关。最初，活性位点被焦炭抑制，但支撑的Pt纳米颗粒的烧结可能会永久抑制这些位点。丙烷浓度为25%和50%的实验显示，每个连续循环的选择性都有显著提高。对于这些特定的实验，检测到的焦炭较少，性质更石墨化，这表明相对无序的焦炭沉积物的存在与裂解等副反应之间存在联系。在高浓度氢气的存在下，形成了更多的石墨化焦炭，主要覆盖催化剂载体。在没有氢气的情况下，形成了更多的无序焦炭，也存在于支撑的Pt纳米颗粒上。氢气有助于保持Pt表面没有这些无序的焦炭物种。氢气对焦炭形成、催化剂稳定性和反应机制的影响对整体过程效率和性能有影响，因为它们可以导致转化率和选择性的提高，催化剂失活的减少和稳定性的提高。
