1.Hydrogen cofeeding in the propane dehydrogenation (PDH) process has a positive effect on the catalyst performance, comparable to the addition of Sn, which increases both propane conversion and propene selectivity. Hydrogen alters the nature of the coke deposits formed during propane dehydrogenation, leading to the formation of smaller graphite crystallites with fewer defects. This is due to hydrogen's ability to suppress coke formation on Pt-based catalysts by competitive adsorption on the catalyst surface, reducing the surface coverage of adsorbed carbon species. As the concentration of these species is reduced, they are less likely to polymerize and form coke. Hydrogen increases catalyst stability, conversion, and selectivity on the Pt-Sn/Al2O3 catalyst, with a propane concentration of 75% providing the optimal performance. The apparent shift in the position of the D Raman band is not yet understood. The narrowing of the Raman bands indicates a higher ordered carbon structure with fewer defects on the catalyst. The addition of H2 to the feed either increases the amount of defects in the graphitic lattice or decreases the size of the graphitic crystallites. The increase in propane dehydrogenation conversion observed with increasing H2 concentration is related to the decreased deposition of coke, which was detected by operando Raman spectroscopy. Initially, these sites are inhibited by coke, but sintering of the supported Pt nanoparticles may inhibit these sites permanently. The experiments with propane concentrations of 25 and 50% show a strong increase in selectivity for each consecutive cycle. For these specific experiments, less coke of a more graphitic nature is detected by operando Raman spectroscopy, suggesting a link between the presence of relatively disordered coke deposits and side reactions, such as cracking. These effects of hydrogen cofeeding on coke formation, catalyst stability, and reaction mechanisms have implications for the overall process efficiency and performance, as they can lead to improved conversion and selectivity, reduced catalyst deactivation, and potentially longer catalyst lifetimes.

1.氢气在丙烷脱氢(PDH)过程中的共进料对催化剂性能有积极影响，与添加Sn的效果相当，Sn可以增加丙烷转化率和丙烯选择性。氢气改变了丙烷脱氢过程中形成的焦炭沉积物的性质，导致形成具有较少缺陷的较小石墨结晶体。这是由于氢气能够通过在催化剂表面的竞争性吸附来抑制Pt基催化剂上的焦炭形成，从而减少吸附碳物种在催化剂表面的覆盖度。随着这些物种浓度的降低，它们聚合形成焦炭的可能性降低。氢气增加了Pt-Sn/Al2O3催化剂的稳定性、转化率和选择性，丙烷浓度为75%时性能最佳。D Raman带位置的明显变化目前尚不清楚。Raman带的变窄表明催化剂上具有较少缺陷的更高有序碳结构。向进料中添加H2要么增加石墨晶格中的缺陷数量，要么减小石墨晶格的尺寸。随着H2浓度的增加，观察到丙烷脱氢转化率的增加与通过operando Raman光谱检测到的焦炭沉积减少有关。最初，这些位点被焦炭抑制，但支撑的Pt纳米粒子的烧结可能会永久抑制这些位点。丙烷浓度为25%和50%的实验显示，每个连续循环的选择性都有显著提高。对于这些特定实验，通过operando Raman光谱检测到较少的焦炭，具有更石墨化的性质，这表明相对无序的焦炭沉积物与裂解等副反应之间存在联系。氢气共进料对焦炭形成、催化剂稳定性和反应机制的影响对整体过程效率和性能有影响，因为它们可以导致转化率和选择性的提高，催化剂失活减少，可能催化剂寿命更长。
