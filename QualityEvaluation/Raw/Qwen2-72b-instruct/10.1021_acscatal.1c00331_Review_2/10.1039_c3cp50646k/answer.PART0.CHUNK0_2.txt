[1] "It was found that the addition of hydrogen to the feed increases the catalyst performance and decreases the formation of coke deposits, as was revealed by 10 thermogravimetrical analysis."
[2] "Operando Raman spectroscopy showed that hydrogen altered the nature of the coke deposits formed during propane dehydrogenation."
[3] "By analysing the related intensity, band position and 15 bandwidth of the different Raman features, it was determined that smaller graphite crystallites, which have less defects, are formed when the partial pressure of hydrogen in the feed was increased."
[4] "The addition of H2 increases catalyst stability,conversion and selectivity on the Pt-Sn/Al2O3 catalyst, with a propane concentration of 75% providing the optimal performance."
[5] "The increase in propane dehydrogenation conversion observed with increasing H2 concentration is related to the decreased deposition 55 of coke, which was detected by operando Raman spectroscopy."
[6] "The low initial selectivity can be explained by the fact that highly active sites present on the catalyst induce cracking and hydrogenolysis in the presence of H2."
[7] "Initially these sites are inhibited by coke, but sintering of the supported Pt nanoparticles may inhibit these sites permanently."
[8] "Finally,the experiments with propane concentrations of 25 and 50% show a strong increase in selectivity for each consecutive cycle."
[9] "For these specific 65 experiments, less coke of a more graphitic nature is detected by operando Raman spectroscopy, suggesting a link between the presence of relatively disordered coke deposits and side reactions,such as cracking."
[10] "We propose that in the presence of high concentrations of H2,more graphitic coke is formed that mainly covers the catalyst support."
[11] "In the absence of H2, more disordered coke is formed,that is also present on the supported Pt nanoparticles."
[12] "H2 assists in keeping the surface of the Pt free of these disordered coke 100 species."

1.Hydrogen cofeeding in the propane dehydrogenation (PDH) process affects coke formation by decreasing the formation of coke deposits and altering the nature of the coke deposits formed during propane dehydrogenation. It increases the catalyst performance and stability, conversion and selectivity on the Pt-Sn/Al2O3 catalyst. The addition of hydrogen leads to smaller, more ordered graphite crystallites, while less coke is formed in the presence of hydrogen. The conversion and selectivity increases when hydrogen is added. Hydrogen assists in keeping the active sites for dehydrogenation free of coke deposits.

1.在丙烷脱氢(PDH)过程中，氢气共进料通过减少焦炭沉积物的形成和改变丙烷脱氢过程中形成的焦炭沉积物的性质，影响焦炭形成。它提高了催化剂性能和稳定性，提高了Pt-Sn/Al2O3催化剂的转化率和选择性。氢气的加入导致更小、更有序的石墨结晶体的形成，而在氢气存在下形成的焦炭较少。当加入氢气时，转化率和选择性增加。氢气有助于保持脱氢活性位点免受焦炭沉积物的污染。
