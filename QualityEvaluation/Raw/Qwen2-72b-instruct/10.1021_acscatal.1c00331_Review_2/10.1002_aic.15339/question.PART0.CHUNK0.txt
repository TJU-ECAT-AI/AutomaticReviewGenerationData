Effects of Ga Doping on Pt/CeO2-Al2O3 Catalysts for Propane Dehydrogenation Tuo Wang, Feng Jiang, Gang Liu, Liang Zeng, Zhi-jian Zhao, and Jinlong Gong* Key Laboratory for Green Chemical Technology of Ministry of Education, Collaborative Innovation Center of Chemical Science and Engineering, School of Chemical Engineering and Technology, Tianjin University, Tianjin 300072, P.R. China DOI 10.1002/aic.15339 Published online in Wiley Online Library (wileyonlinelibrary.com) This paper describes catalytic consequencesThis paper describes catalytic consequences of Pt/CeO2-Al2O3 catalysts pro- moted with Ga species for propane dehydrogenation. A series of PtGa/CeO2-Al2O3 catalysts were prepared by a sequen- tial impregnation method. The as-prepared catalysts were characterized employing N2 adsorption-desorption, X-ray diffrtaction, temperature programmed reduction, O2 volumetric chemisorption, H2-O2 titration, and transmission elec- tron microscopy. We have shown that Ga31 cations are incorporated into the cubic fluorite structure of CeO2, enhanc- ing both lattice oxygen storage capacity and surface oxygen mobility. The enhanced reducibility of CeO2 is indicative of higher capability to eliminate the coke deposition and thus is beneficial to the improvement of catalytic stability. Density functional theory calculations confirm that the addition of Ga is prone to improve propylene desorption and greatly sup- press deep dehydrogenation and the following coke formation. The catalytic performance shows a strong dependence on the content of Ga addition. The optimal loading content of Ga is 3 wt %, which results in the maximal propylene selec- tivity together with the best catalytic stability against coke accumulation. V C 2016 American Institute of Chemical Engi- neers AIChE J, 00: 000000, 2016 Keywords: propane dehydrogenation, CeO2-Al2O3, PtGa alloy, oxygen storage capacity, oxygen mobility Introduction Propylene is an important feedstock employed in the pro- duction of a vast series of chemicals such as polypropylene and acrylonitrile.13 In recent years, propylene production from conventional paths could not match its increasing demand, thus propane dehydrogenation (PDH) has acquired considerable attention as an alternative propylene production technology.4,5 Pt-based catalysts supported on alumina are widely utilized in the PDH processes.6,7 Despite their high cat- alytic activity, supported Pt catalysts are subjected to severe deactivation primarily due to coke formation.810 Furthermore, Pt-based catalysts suffer from unsatisfactory selectivity toward desired products caused by the generation of lighter hydrocar- bons via the CC bond cleavage.10,11 Thus, it is of great importance to develop effective approaches to solving the problems of fast deactivation and low selectivity of Pt-based catalysts.
Ceria has wide applications in numerous catalytic processes,including CO oxidation,12 NOx reduction,13 and steam reform- ing.14 Owing to its high oxygen storage capacity (OSC), CeO2 tends to suppress coke formation using mobile oxygen released from the lattice to oxidize carbon deposits.13,15 Yu et al. reported that the presence of CeO2 could resist the coke accumulation and improve the performance of PtSn/Al2O3 for the PDH reaction.16 According to previous studies, doping with different types of metal ions could improve the reducibil- ity of CeO2.1719 Collins et al. investigated the synthesis of Ga-Ce oxides and revealed that the Ga31 was incorporated into the ceria lattice and subsequently the redox properties of CeO2 were modified.20 With gallium doping, the amount of lattice oxygen vacancies was increased and the surface oxygen mobility (OM) was improved. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations have also been adopted to verify the higher OSC and OM of gallium-doped ceria and understand the redox mechanism of CeO2.21 Recently, gallium has also been considered to be an efficient promoter in Pt-based catalysts for alkane dehydrogenation to alkenes.2225 In accordance with other metal promoters such as Sn, Cu, Zn, Re, and Ge,2632 the introduction of Ga results in pronounced enhancement of dehydrogenation catalytic sta- bility and selectivity toward desired products. On reduction at high temperatures (e.g., 500 8C), a portion of Ga31 was reduced to Ga atoms, which was catalyzed in the presence of Pt. The generated Ga atoms tended to migrate and incorporate into Pt nanoclusters, forming PtGa alloys with variable com- positions.33 Analogous to PtSn catalysts,34,35 the influence of PtGa alloy on the catalytic performance could be attributed to the combination of geometric and electronic effects. The geo- metric effect contributes to decreasing the size of Pt ensembles or blocking the low-coordinated defect active sites by Ga atoms, thereby attenuating the structure-sensitive side reac- tions,including hydrogenolysis and deep dehydrogena- tion.3638 The electron transfer from Ga atoms to active sites Correspondence concerning this article should be addressed to J.

C 2016 American Institute of Chemical Engineers AIChE Journal 1 2016 Vol. 00, No. 00 hinders the adsorption of alkenes on active sites and conse- quently decreases the likelihood of hydrogenolysis and coking.24,39 In this article, CeO2-Al2O3 binary oxide was employed as the support for Pt nanoparticles on account of its capability to reduce coke formation. On this basis, we proposed a strategy of doping the Pt/CeO2-Al2O3 catalysts with the Ga species to enhance the redox property of CeO2 and modify the properties of Pt nanoparticles simultaneously, and hence to improve the catalytic performance of Pt catalysts in PDH. A series of PtGa/CeO2-Al2O3 catalysts were prepared by the sequential impregnation method. The as-prepared catalysts were charac- terized employing N2 adsorption-desorption, X-ray diffraction (XRD), temperature programmed reduction (TPR), O2 volu- metric chemisorption, H2-O2 titration, and transmission elec- tron microscopy (TEM). The catalytic performance was investigated at atmospheric pressure and 600 8C to understand the role of Ga on catalytic properties of CeO2-Al2O3 supported Pt catalysts, and then the cycling tests were performed to further evaluate the influence of Ga dopant on the catalytic stability of PtGa/CeO2-Al2O3 catalysts. Furthermore, thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was conducted to quantify the carbon deposition.
DFT calculations were applied to investigate the binding strength of intermediates on PtGa surfaces. The optimal loading of Ga was also discussed.
Experimental and Computational Methods Preparation of supported Pt catalysts The PtGa/CeO2-Al2O3 catalysts were prepared by the sequential impregnation method. The Pt/Al2O3, Pt/CeO2- Al2O3, and PtGa/Al2O3 catalysts were also prepared employ- ing the same method. Ce(NO3)36H2O (Sinopharm Chemical Reagent, 99.0%) and Ga(NO3)39H2O (Sinopharm Chemical Reagent, 99.9%) were used as precursors and dissolved in deionized water. A c-Al2O3 support was impregnated in these solutions at room temperature for 12 h, followed by drying at 90 8C overnight and calcination at 600 8C for 3 h. Subse- quently, supported Pt catalysts were prepared by an incipient wetness impregnation method. The precursor used was H2PtCl66H2O (Tianjin Kaiyingte chemical trade, 99.9%) in an aqueous solution. The synthesized solids were impregnated in the H2PtCl6 solution at room temperature for 12 h. On metal deposition, the impregnated solids were dried at 90 8C over- night, and then calcined at 600 8C for 3 h. A series of PtGa/ CeO2-Al2O3 catalysts with different loadings were synthesized and denoted as PtxGa/CeAl, where x is the weight ratio of Ga/ (CeO2-Al2O3). The weight loadings of Pt was held constant at 1 wt %. Furthermore, the effect of CeO2 was studied and was fixed 10 wt % in our investigation as the optimal loading.
Characterization
XRD
measurements were performed with 2h values between 20 and 808 by using a Rigaku C/max-2500 diffrac- tometer employing the graphite filtered Cu Ka radiation (k 5 1.5406 A ).
Textual properties of the supports and catalysts were meas- ured with a Micromeritics Tristar 3000 analyzer by nitrogen adsorption at 2196 8C. The samples were outgassed at 300 8C for 4 h before measurements. We employed the Brunauer EmmettTeller (BET) method to quantify the adsorption of nitrogen at 2196 8C, and the cumulative pore volumes and pore sizes were obtained by the BarrettJoynerHalenda (BJH) method from the desorption branches of the adsorption isotherms.
H2-TPR experiments were carried out to analyze the reduc- tion behavior of the catalysts using a Micromeritics AutoChem 2920 apparatus. Prior to the TPR experiment, 150 mg sample was pretreated at 300 8C for 1 h under Ar stream (20 mL/min).
After cooling to 50 8C, The H2-TPR was performed in 10 vol % H2/Ar (30 mL/min) with a heating rate of 10 8C/min to 800 8C and the profile was recorded with a thermal conductiv- ity detector.
O2 volumetric chemisorption was conducted at 600 8C to evaluate the OSC and OM of PtxGa/CeAl catalysts. Prior to heating to 600 8C, 100 mg sample was reduced with 10 vol % H2/Ar (30 mL/min) at 500 8C for 1 h. Injection pulses of 10 vol % H2/He (0.5082 mL) up to a complete reduction of the sample was followed by injection pulses of 10 vol % O2/Ar (0.5082 mL) until the peaks became stable. O2 uptake was used to calculate the OSC, which represents the total volume of oxygen available in the catalyst.40 Subsequently, the oxy- gen injection pulses process was repeated to characterize the OM on the basis of the O2 reuptake. OM stands for the amount of available surface sites for migration of oxygen in the catalyst.41 Dispersion of platinum was studied employing the hydrogen-oxygen titration method.42 For each test, 100 mg sample was reduced with 10 vol % H2/Ar at 500 8C for 1 h,then cooled to 50 8C, following which oxygen was admitted to the sample by injection pulses of 10 vol % O2/He (0.5082 mL) until the consumption peaks became stable. Subsequently, the H2 chemisorption was carried out at the same temperature by injection pulses of 10 vol % H2/Ar (0.5082 mL). It can be assumed that the adsorption stoichiometry factor of Pt/H2 equals to 2/3.42,43 The metal dispersion is calculated using the following equation: Dispersion %5 VH23SF3MWPt WPt322414 3100 (1) Where VH2 is the volume of adsorbed H2 (mL), SF is the stoi- chiometry factor, MWPt is the atomic weight of Pt (g/mol), and WPt is the weight of supported Pt on the sample (g).
TEM was conducted to characterize the morphology of cat- alysts using a JEM-2100F transmission electron microscope at 200 kV. High angel annular dark field-scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM) images were also obtained for Pt particles. The fresh catalysts were prereduced at 500 8C in a flow rate of 50 mL/min of 20 vol % H2/N2 for 1 h before characterization. The samples were dispersed in ethanol and supported on carbon-film coated copper grids before TEM images were recorded.
TGA (STA449F3 NETZSCH Corp.) was used to investigate the carbon deposition of spent catalysts. The sample was pre- heated at 80 8C for 0.5 h in N2 (50 mL/min). Then the sample was heated to 800 8C at a rate of 10 8C/min in air (100 mL/ min).
Catalytic tests Catalytic tests were carried out at atmospheric pressure and 600 8C in a quartz fixed-bed reactor with 8 mm in inner diame- ter and 24 cm in length. A mixture of 150 mg catalysts and
0.1 mL quartz sand with 2040 mesh-size distribution was
loaded in the quartz tubular reactor. Prior to the test, the cata- lysts were reduced at 500 8C in situ for 1 h in a flow of 10 vol % H2/N2. Afterwards, H2/N2 was replaced by the mixture of 2 DOI 10.1002/aic Published on behalf of the AIChE 2016 Vol. 00, No. 00 AIChE Journal C3H8 (26 vol %) and H2 (26 vol %) in N2 at a total flow rate of 50 mL/min for the PDH reaction. The weight hourly space velocity (WHSV) of propane was 10 h21. The product gas was analyzed by an on-line GC equipped with a flame ionization detector (Chromosorb 102 column) and a thermal conductivity detector (Al2O3 Plot column).
The recycling tests were performed to further estimate the stability of PtxGa/CeAl catalysts. For each catalyst, three reduction-reaction-oxidation cycles were repeated. The reduc- tion and reaction conditions remained the same with the above catalytic tests. The catalysts were regenerated at 500 8C for 2 h in a flow mixture of 5 vol % O2/N2 (20 mL/min) and N2 (30 mL/min).

Computational models and parameters DFT calculations were carried out with the plane-wave based Vienna ab initio simulation package (VASP)4447 at generalized gradient approximation (GGA) level in form of the exchange-correlation functional BEEF-vdW.48 Projector augmented wave (PAW) method was used to describe the interaction between the atomic cores and electrons.45,49 The valence wave functions were expanded in a plane-wave basis with a cutoff energy of 400 eV. The geometry optimization was converged to 0.02 eV/A .
According to the previous studies on Pt-Ga binary system and phase diagram,50,51 we employed three surface models, Pt(111), Pt3Ga (111), and PtGa2(111) to represent synthesized Pt rich and Ga rich catalysts. In the case of Pt(111) and Pt3Ga(111), the surface was cut from FCC type of bulk metal structure. We used a (4 3 4) five-layer slab with top two layers relaxed. A Monkhorst-Pack mesh of 5 3 5 3 1 k points was used to sample the Brillouin zone.52 In the case of PtGa2,we chose a CaF2 type bulk structure with Fm-3m symmetry. A (2 3 2) eight-layer PtGa2(111) slab with Pt termination was used in our calculation. Top three layers of the slab were allowed to relax during optimizations. The Brillouin zone was sampled with a 7 3 7 3 1 Monkhorst-Pack mesh.
Results Characterization of as-prepared catalysts Physical properties of PtxGa/CeAl catalysts are presented in Table 1. The Ga loading of PtxGa/CeAl catalysts to be investi- gated is in the range of 05 wt %. The Pt/Al2O3 catalyst has a surface area of 221 m2/g and a pore volume of 6.8 cm3/g. The introduction of CeO2 leads to a decline in the surface area of the catalyst, which may be attribute to the pore blockage. On the dispersion of 1 wt % of Ga, the surface area decreases to 124 m2/g. However, increasing the loading of Ga (e.g., 3 wt %, 5 wt %) has a slight influence on the surface area as well as the pore volume. The CeO2 crystallite diameters based on CeO2 (111) plane of XRD patterns and the Scherrer equation are exhibited in Table 1. The CeO2 particle sizes of all the samples are in the range of 7.07.5 nm, showing negligible dependence on the Ga content. The metal dispersion deter- mined by the H2-O2 titration method and the average Pt crys- tallite diameters determined by TEM images are also shown in Table 1. The results point out that the addition of CeO2 increases the Pt dispersion and thus decreases the average Pt nanoparticle diameters. However, the presence of Ga reduces the metal dispersion of active sites, which could be caused by the formation of PtGa alloy as well as superfluous Ga2O3 sup- pressing the exposure of Pt atoms (as will be discussed later on).24 TEM images of the reduced catalysts are shown in Figure 1 and the insets are Pt particle-size distribution. To better distin- guish the Pt nanoparticles, HAADF-STEM micrograph of the Pt3Ga/CeAl catalyst was obtained and shown in Figure 1d.
The PtxGa/CeAl catalysts exhibit small Pt particle sizes, indi- cating that Pt is highly dispersed on the supports, which is in accordance with the metal dispersion results presented in Table 1.
Diffraction patterns of as-prepared PtxGa/CeAl catalysts are depicted in Figure 2. The diffraction peaks at 2h 5 27.28,
39.38, 45.88, and 66.88 are assigned to c-Al2O3. For the Pt/
CeAl catalyst, the peaks at 2h 5 28.78, 33.28, 47.78, and 56.58 are attributed to the (111), (200), (220), and (311) facets of the cubic fluorite structure of CeO2, respectively. With the Ga doping, a slight shift to the lower 2h values can be observed for the CeO2 diffraction peaks. The diffraction peaks of CeO2(111) facet are presented in Figure 2b. The peak ascribed to the CeO2 (111) facet shifts to 28.58, 28.48, and 28.38 for the Pt1Ga/CeAl, Pt3Ga/CeAl, and Pt5Ga/CeAl catalysts, respec- tively.
Because of relative low calcination temperature (600 8C), no peaks assigned to CeAlO3 (JCPDS 81-1185) was detected. For all the PtxGa/CeAl catalysts, no diffraction peaks of Ga were observed, revealing that Ga component is highly dispersed or merged into the CeO2 lattice and Pt nano- particles. In addition, no diffraction peaks of Pt were detected Table 1.

TPR profiles of studied catalysts are shown in Figure 3. In general, Pt oxide is reduced at lower temperatures, <500 8C,while CeO2 starts to become reduced at higher temperatures,with Tmax at around 600 8C (Figure 3).39,53 Obviously, the addition of CeO2 leads to the down shift of the first peak of Pt oxides from 233 8C (Pt/Al2O3) to 196 8C (Pt/CeAl), indicating that CeO2 promotes the reduction of Pt oxides species, consist- ent with a previous investigation by Damyanova et al.54 The addition of Ga shifts the reduction peak of CeO2 from 620 8C (Pt/CeAl) to lower temperatures, 596609 8C (PtxGa/CeAl).Moreover, the peak area dramatically increased after addition of Ga, indicating more lattice O can be reduced from CeO2.Quantified analysis will be done in the following OSC and OM analysis. Meanwhile, the intensity of the first reduction peak of Pt oxides increases compared to the Pt/CeAl catalyst,which could be resulted from the partial reduction of Ga2O3 near the Pt nanoparticles.55,56 The results obtained from oxygen volumetric chemisorption experiments are listed in Table 2. It is evident that the Ga- modified catalysts have higher OSC than Ga-free catalysts, Figure 1. TEM images of reduced PtxGa/CeAl catalysts.

It should be noted that the Pt3Ga/Al2O3 catalyst consumes much less oxygen, which manifests that the augment of oxygen uptake on PtxGa/CeAl catalysts is not simply due to the oxygen con- sumption of Ga2O3. The results suggest that the Ga addition increases the volume of oxygen vacancies in CeO2 lattice.Moreover, the experimental results reveal that the mobility of oxygen on PtxGa/CeAl catalysts is continuously intensified as the Ga loading increases.Catalytic performance Results of the catalytic performance of the catalysts are shown in Figure 4. The Pt/Al2O3 and Pt3Ga/Al2O3 catalysts were also tested for comparison. The initial propane conver- sions for Pt/Al2O3, Pt/CeAl, Pt3Ga/Al2O3, and Pt3Ga/CeAl catalysts are 45.5%, 47.1%, 39.4%, and 41.1%; after 15 h of time on stream, the conversions decrease to 19.2%, 22.2%,

AIChE Journal 2016 Vol. 00, No. 00 Published on behalf of the AIChE DOI 10.1002/aic 5 Al2O3 catalyst results in the slight rise of the initial propane conversion, which is attributed to the higher dispersion of Pt nanoparticles on the Pt/CeAl catalyst.16 Due to high surface oxygen mobility of CeO2, the deactivation rate of the Pt/CeAl catalyst is lower than that of the Pt/Al2O3 catalyst. However,the addition of CeO2 has a negligible influence on the selectiv- ity toward propylene. With respect to the Pt3Ga/Al2O3 cata- lyst, an increased propylene selectivity of the catalyst was observed throughout the course of reaction. After 15 h on stream, the propylene selectivity for Pt/Al2O3, Pt/CeAl, Pt3Ga/Al2O3, and Pt3Ga/CeAl catalysts are 81.8%, 86.0%,
99.5%, and 99.6%, respectively. Notably, the selectivities
toward light hydrocarbons (mainly methane and ethane) decline severely with the doping of Ga, which means that the Ga addition suppresses cracking reactions effectively. Addi- tionally, the Pt3Ga/Al2O3 catalyst displays better catalytic sta- bility, which is in accordance with previous studies.22,23 For the Pt3Ga/CeAl catalyst, the best catalytic stability is pre- sented together with the highest propylene selectivity.
The effect of Ga loading on the catalytic performance in PDH is illustrated in Figure 5. The content of Ga addition is in the range of 15 wt %. The initial conversions for Pt1Ga/ CeAl, Pt3Ga/CeAl, and Pt5Ga/CeAl catalysts are 40.9%,
41.1%, and 39.0%; after 15 h of time on stream, the

[Color figure can be viewed in the online issue, which is available at wileyonlinelibrary.com.]. 6 DOI 10.1002/aic Published on behalf of the AIChE 2016 Vol. 00, No. 00 AIChE Journal conversions of propane decrease to 23.5%, 32.2%, and 28.1%,respectively. The Pt3Ga/CeAl catalyst exhibits the lowest deactivation rate. Additionally, the selectivity toward propyl- ene increases with the Ga loading until the Ga content increases to 3 wt %. The Pt3Ga/CeAl and Pt5Ga/CeAl cata- lysts display almost the same propylene selectivity, reaching a value of nearly 99%. Apparently, the optimal loading content of Ga is determined to be 3 wt %, which results in high activ- ity, excellent selectivity and the best catalytic stability.
To further confirm the stability of PtxGa/CeAl catalysts, the recycling tests were performed. For each cycle, the reduction- reaction-oxidation processes were included to regenerate the catalysts. Figure 6 shows the effect of regeneration cycles on the yield and selectivity of propylene during PDH. For all the catalysts studied, the propylene selectivity does not change noticeably through three cycles, which means that the selectiv- ity presents negligible dependence on the regeneration cycles.
In the first cycle, the Pt/Al2O3, Pt/CeAl, and Pt3Ga/CeAl show the decrease in propylene yield from 30.9% to 24.7%, from
31.7% to 25.1%, and from 41.5% to 34.7%, respectively. In
the third cycle, the initial yields for Pt/Al2O3, Pt/CeAl are
27.9% and 31.2%; and the final yields drop to 22.2% and
23.3%, respectively. The loss of activity between the first
cycle and the third cycle is considerable, in particular over the Pt/Al2O3 catalyst. In comparison, the Pt3Ga/CeAl catalyst exhibits almost the same yield between the first and third Figure 8. TGA profiles and coke depositions for the spent catalysts after 15 h of time on stream.

AIChE Journal 2016 Vol. 00, No. 00 Published on behalf of the AIChE DOI 10.1002/aic 7 cycle. The Pt3Ga/CeAl catalyst possesses the highest stability,while the Pt/Al2O3 catalyst suffers from the most severe deactivation.
Characterization of spent catalysts TEM images of spent catalysts are illustrated in Figure 7.
Apparently, the Pt particle sizes undergo negligible change on the catalytic reaction, indicating that metal sintering takes lit- tle responsibility for the loss of the catalytic activity. The sub- stances with nonuniform structure depicted in the images (inside the dotted circles), which show evidently different morphologies from the catalysts, can be ascribed to coke deposits. The disordered structure of the coke deposits is assigned to the amorphous coke. It is safely concluded that coke accumulation is the main reason for catalyst deactivation in PDH. Figure 7 shows that the coke deposits can physically cover the Pt surface, resulting in lower availability of active sites and thus catalyst deactivation.
The amount of coke deposits was quantitatively determined by TGA in an oxidizing environment, and the mass loss pro- files and the amount of coke depositions are presented in Fig- ure 8. It can be seen that the amount of coke deposition (mg/ (gcat.h)) follows the order Pt3Ga/CeAl (0.41) < Pt3Ga/Al2O3 (0.73) < Pt/CeAl (0.98) < Pt/Al2O3 (1.12). The addition of CeO2 and/or Ga contributes to lower amount of coke deposits.The lowest amount of coke deposits was observed over the Pt3Ga/CeAl catalyst. Figure 8 shows that the mass loss over used Pt3Ga/CeAl catalyst is distinctly lower than spent Pt3Ga/ Al2O3 and Pt/CeAl catalysts, which is related to the catalytic stability.DFT simulation results The structures of three PtxGay surface models are shown in Figure 9. According to previous studies on the hydrocarbon decomposition over Pt(111), the precursors for CC bond breaking are highly dehydrogenated intermediates.34,57 Thus,we only consider a scenario including initial dehydrogenation reactions until C3H4 was formed. We also exclude hydrogena- tion shift reactions in our reaction network, since it has been reported with a relatively higher barrier compared to dehydro- genation steps.58 The simulation results show that the existence of Ga in the alloy system significantly weakens the binding strength of sur- face intermediates. For example, the binding energy of pro- pene on Pt(111), Pt3Ga(111), and PtGa2(111) are 21.09,
20.83, and 20.51 eV, respectively. Thus, Ga rich surfaces are
more favorable for the desorption of the desired product pro- pene. More importantly, the dehydrogenation steps become more endothermic along with the increasing of Ga content in the alloy, as shown in Figure 9b and Table 3, due to the less favored adsorption of surface intermediate. On Pt(111), dehy- drogenation of propane to C3H4 is endothermic by 1.13 eV.
This transformation is slightly more endothermic on Pt3Ga(111), at 1.35 eV. However, it requires about 3 eV to dehydrogenate the same amount of H atoms on PtGa2(111),indicating that deep dehydrogenation, as well as the following coke formation, will be highly suppressed on PtGa2(111) com- pared to that on Pt dominated alloys surfaces.
Discussion The effect of Ga doping on ceria Doping metal cations into ceria is considered to be an effec- tive way to regulate the structural and chemical properties of pure ceria. As clearly shown in Figure 2, a slight shift to the lower 2h values can be observed for the CeO2 diffraction peaks with the Ga doping, suggesting that Ga31 cations are incorporated into the host lattice structure of CeO2.20 Doping metal cations into ceria can modify the OSC and OM of the catalysts. The modification arises from the drop- ping of the barrier for oxygen migration and the lowering of the activation energy of ceria reduction.59 Extra oxygen vacancies are formed when metal cations are incorporated into CeO2 lattice.

Additionally,the OSC and OM increase with the Ga content when it is in the range of 15 wt %, which is consistent with the previous studies.21 It is implied that the Ga31 cations incorporated into CeO2 lattice create additional oxygen vacancies and improve the reducibility of CeO2. H2-TPR profiles also show that the Ga addition facilitates the reduction from Ce41 to Ce31.
Higher OSC contributes to remove the coke deposits covered on catalysts. An increased number of lattice oxygen tends to consume more carbon deposition. Therefore, the enhanced OSC is beneficial to attenuate the accumulation of coke forma- tion, and thus afford more effective exposure of active sites which improves the catalytic stability against coke formation.
The catalytic performance of Pt/CeAl and PtGa/Al2O3 cata- lysts are superior to that of the corresponding Pt/Al2O3 cata- lyst. As depicted in Figure 4, the CeO2 component has a negligible influence on the selectivity toward propylene over the Pt/CeAl catalyst. Hence, the effect of CeO2 addition to Pt/ Al2O3 catalyst is only the improvement of initial conversion and elimination of coke formation. Liu et al. proposed that the Ce41 ions on the CeO2 surface can oxidize the coke formed while being reduced to Ce31.60 Laosiripojana et al. suggested that the strengthened redox property of doped CeO2 sup- pressed coke formation by oxidizing the hydrocarbons on metal surface and then contributed to the higher catalytic sta- bility.61 Concerning the increase of initial propane conversion,it is attributed to the higher dispersion of active sites caused by CeO2 addition, which is shown in Table 1.
Compared with the Pt/CeAl and PtGa/Al2O3 catalysts, the catalytic performances of Pt3Ga/CeAl are even more pro- nounced. In addition to the formation of PtGa alloys, the Ga31 ions can be incorporated into CeO2 lattice and thus enhance the OSC and OM of CeO2. Enhanced reducibility of CeO2 is indicative of higher ability to suppress coke accumulation on catalysts. The OSC and OM results reveal that the doping of Ga enhances the redox properties of catalysts via its incorpora- tion into the CeO2 lattice.18 The Pt3Ga/CeAl catalyst exhibits much higher OSC together with OM than Pt/CeAl and PtGa/ Al2O3 catalysts, which coincides with the TGA results that much lower coke deposits are obtained over the used Pt3Ga/ CeAl catalyst. The amount of coke deposits on catalysts is in accordance with the catalytic stability. Note that the addition of CeO2 have negligible influence to the Pt:Ga ratio, 1:1 mol ratio, in the alloy particles as indicated by TEM/EDX experi- ment (Figure 10). It further suggests that enhanced perform- ance is attributed to the lattice oxygen in ceria.
The effect of Ga doping on Pt particles In comparison to the Pt/Al2O3 catalyst, the selectivities toward light hydrocarbons (mainly methane and ethane) decrease severely over the PtGa/Al2O3 catalyst, meaning that the Ga addition suppresses cracking reactions effectively. Fur- thermore, the Ga addition markedly reduces the deactivation rate of catalyst and hence enhances the catalytic stability. The prominent impact of Ga addition is primarily attributed to the formation of PtGa alloys. On reduction at high temperatures (e.g., 500 8C), a small portion of Ga31, e.g., 12% for Pt3Ga/ CeAl estimated according to TEM/EDX (Figure 10), is reduced to form Ga atoms in contact with Pt. The generated Ga atoms tend to migrate and incorporate into Pt nanoclusters,forming PtGa alloy with variable compositions (1:1 in case of Pt3Ga/CeAl, Figure 10), which has been reported in earlier studies on Pt/Ga2O3/Al2O3 and Pt/Ga2O3 catalysts.33,62 It should be noted that the presence of supported Pt particles is indispensable to the reduction of Ga31, since Pt atoms cata- lyze the reduction of Ga31 by greatly decreasing its reduction temperature.55,63 Similar to Pt-Sn catalysts,34,35 the influence of forming PtGa alloy on the catalytic performance could be attributed to a combination of geometric and electronic effects of metal promoter. Regarding the geometric effect of metal promoter,there are two kinds of explanations. Some researchers believe that the formation of alloy causes the decrease in the size of Pt ensemble. For example, Bell et al. found that the PtPt coordi- nation decreased to 5.2 via EXAFS after reducing Ga modified Pt/Mg(Al)O with H2 at 873 K, and the PtPt coordination was changed to 4.4 from 7.7 after Sn addition similarly.10,22 Stud- ies showed that the small Pt ensemble contributes to the sup- pression of structure-sensitive side reactions,including hydrogenolysis and deep dehydrogenation.3436,64 Indeed,deeper dehydrogenated intermediate requires more Pt atoms to bind due to the highly unsaturated nature of its C atoms.58 As illustrated in the DFT study, on PtGa2(111), the lack of three- fold Pt hollow site forced CHCHCH3 binding on top of a sin- gle Pt atom, resulting in a 1.16 eV weaker binding than that on the FCC site of Pt(111). Other authors insist that the hydroge- nolysis and deep dehydrogenation reactions, which are structure-sensitive, are boosted by low-coordinated defect sites (e.g., edges and corners).37,65 The recession of these structure- sensitive side reactions is attributed to the selective blocking of these defect sites by Ga atoms.37,38 Both of these two geo- metric effects caused by the formation of PtGa alloys are able to attenuate the hydrogenolysis and deep dehydrogenation reactions, and consequently reduce the production of lighter hydrocarbons (mainly methane and ethane) and inhibit the accumulation of coke deposits.
By contrast, the electronic effect is quite straightforward.
The electronic effect of the promoter is to lower the desorption barrier of alkene and coke precursors by donating electron to Pt atoms.66,67 As shown in Figure 9, the binding of surface intermediates becomes weaker along with the increase of Ga content in the alloy. The electron transfer from promoters to active sites hinders alkene adsorption on Pt sites and accord- ingly decreases the likelihood of hydrogenolysis and Table 3.

AIChE Journal 2016 Vol. 00, No. 00 Published on behalf of the AIChE DOI 10.1002/aic 9 coking.24,39 The enhanced electron density of Pt particle pro- motes the desorption of C3H6 and thus suppresses the deep dehydrogenation and hydrogenolysis reactions which produce lighter hydrocarbons and trigger a low propylene selectivity.
Furthermore, the electron-rich Pt atoms weaken the interaction between Pt and coke precursors and facilitate the desorption and migration of coke precursors, finally improving the cata- lytic stability against coke deposits dramatically.29,68 The effect of Ga loadings The PtxGa/CeAl catalysts exhibit excellent catalytic stabil- ity against coke accumulation and superior selectivity toward propylene. The catalytic performance of PtxGa/CeAl catalysts can be tuned by varying the amount of Ga loading. As shown in Figure 5, the optimal loading content of Ga is determined to be 3 wt %. The Pt3Ga/CeAl catalyst exhibits the maximal pro- pane conversion and propylene selectivity together with the best catalytic stability. The effect of Ga addition consists of two aspects: decorating Pt nanoparticles via the formation of PtGa alloys and enhancing the redox property of CeO2 via the incorporation of Ga31 into CeO2 lattice. Both types of Ga effects depends on the ratio of Ga to Pt or CeO2.21,23 For the Pt1Ga/CeAl catalyst, the amount of Ga addition is not suffi- cient so that not only the composition of PtGa alloy is not opti- mal but the OSC and OM of Ga-modified CeO2 are not satisfactory. This accounts for the low catalytic stability and poor propylene selectivity over Pt1Ga/CeAl catalyst shown in Figure 5. With respect to the Pt5Ga/CeAl catalyst, excessive Ga loading guarantees the excellent redox properties of Ga- modified CeO2 (highest OSC and OM), although the ratio of Ga to Pt exceeds the ideal value, leading to excessive Ga atoms blocking the Pt active sites.23 Therefore, the decreased initial activity is obtained over the Pt5Ga/CeAl catalyst. Con- cerning the Pt3Ga/CeAl catalyst, the OSC and OM of the cata- lyst are fairly high to suppress coke accumulation.
Conversely, the Ga/Pt ratio reach its optimal value.
A schematic model of the PtxGa/CeAl catalyst and the mechanism of PDH catalytic reaction is proposed (Scheme 1).
As shown in Scheme 1, a portion of the Ga31 is reduced to form Ga atoms after reduction at 500 8C, and then the gener- ated Ga atoms migrate and incorporate into Pt nanoclusters,forming PtGa alloy. The PtGa alloy can improve the catalytic performance owing to a combination of geometric and elec- tronic effects of Ga component, which finally suppress the hydrogenolysis, deep dehydrogenation, and coking reactions.
Simultaneously, the Ga31 cations are incorporated into the lat- tice structure of CeO2, enhancing the redox property of CeO2,including the higher OSC and OM. The CeO2 can oxidize the coke formed, resulting in the enhancement of catalytic stabil- ity. Therefore, the enhanced reducibility of CeO2 with Ga dop- ing is beneficial to eliminate the coke deposition covered on active sites and support area.

Finally, the Ga addition to the Pt/CeAl catalyst enhances the selectivity toward propylene and anticoking capability dramatically.
Conclusions We have presented an investigation into doping the Pt/ CeO2-Al2O3 catalysts with Ga element to simultaneously enhance the redox property of CeO2 and modify the catalytic property of Pt nanoparticles. The addition of Ga improves the catalytic performance of Pt catalysts in PDH, including increasing propylene selectivity and enhancing the catalytic stability. According to XRD results, Ga31 cations are incorpo- rated into the host lattice structure of CeO2. The OSC and OM results reveal that the doping of Ga enhances the redox prop- erty of catalysts. The enhanced reducibility of CeO2 is indica- tive of higher capability to eliminate the coke deposition and thus is beneficial to the improvement of catalytic stability.
Simultaneously, the addition of Ga is prone to decorate Pt nanoparticles via the formation of PtGa alloys. The influence of forming PtGa alloys on the catalytic performance can be attributed to a combination of geometric and electronic effects.
The geometric effect of metal promoter contributes to decreas- ing the size of Pt ensembles or blocking the low-coordinated defect active sites and thereby suppressing the structure- sensitive side reactions, including hydrogenolysis and deep dehydrogenation. The electronic effect of promoter is to lower the desorption barrier of alkenes and coke precursors by donat- ing electron to Pt atoms, hindering alkenes adsorption on metal sites and consequently decreasing the likelihood of hydrogenolysis and coking.
The OSC and OM increase with the Ga content when it is in the range of 15 wt %, while the Ga content imposes different impacts on the catalytic stability. With the addition of 1 wt % Ga, both the composition of PtGa alloy and the reducibility of Ga-modified CeO2 are not satisfactory, which accounts for the low catalytic stability and poor propylene selectivity over the Pt1Ga/CeAl catalyst. With excessive Ga addition (e.g., 5 wt %), the ratio of Ga/Pt exceeds the ideal value, which leads to superfluous Ga atoms blocking the Pt active sites gradually.
Therefore, the decreased activity and considerably low stabil- ity are obtained over the Pt5Ga/CeAl catalyst. The optimal loading content of Ga is around 3 wt %, which results in the maximal propylene selectivity together with the best catalytic stability against coke accumulation.
