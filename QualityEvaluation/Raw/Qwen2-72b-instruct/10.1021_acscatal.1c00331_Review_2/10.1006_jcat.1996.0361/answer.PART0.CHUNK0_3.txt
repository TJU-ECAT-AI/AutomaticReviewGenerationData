[1] "Hydrogen, on the other hand, suppresses the formation."
[2] "Hydrogen was very efficient in preventing coke formation and deactivation but could not remove coke already formed on the catalyst."
[3] "The hydrogenoly- sis and cracking mechanisms during the propane dehydrogenation are also discussed."
[4] "Hydrogen has proven to be very efficient in maintaining the activity of the catalyst and also suppressing the coke formation."
[5] "On the other hand, it was not possible to re- move any coke after the reaction stopped."
[6] "The conclusion must be that hydrogen is active in preventing coke forma- tion but does not remove any significant amount of coke already formed."
[7] "During the reaction, on the other hand, the formation of coke pre- cursors is suppressed by hydrogen, and what Biswas et al. called reversible coke, can be removed by hydrogenation (38)."
[8] "This explains why hydrogen helps maintain the cata- lytic activity."

1.Hydrogen cofeeding in the propane dehydrogenation (PDH) process suppresses the formation of coke, maintaining the activity of the catalyst and preventing deactivation. It does not remove coke already formed on the catalyst. Hydrogen affects the hydrogenolysis and cracking mechanisms during PDH. It is very efficient in maintaining the activity of the catalyst and suppressing coke formation. Hydrogen helps maintain the catalytic activity by suppressing the formation of coke precursors. Hydrogen can remove reversible coke by hydrogenation, which explains its role in maintaining the catalytic activity.

1.在丙烷脱氢(PDH)过程中，氢气共进料抑制了焦炭的形成，维持了催化剂的活性，防止了失活。它不会去除催化剂上已经形成的焦炭。氢气影响PDH过程中的氢解和裂解机制。它在维持催化剂活性和抑制焦炭形成方面非常有效。氢气通过抑制焦炭前体的形成帮助维持催化活性。氢气可以通过氢化去除可逆焦炭，这解释了它在维持催化活性中的作用。
