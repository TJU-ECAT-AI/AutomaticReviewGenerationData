          Hydrogen, on the other hand, suppresses the formation.
          Hydrogen was very efficient in preventing coke formation and deactivation but could not remove coke already formed on the catalyst.
          The hydrogenoly- sis and cracking mechanisms during the propane dehydrogenation are also discussed.
          Hydrogen has proven to be very efficient in maintaining the activity of the catalyst and also suppressing the coke formation.
          On the other hand, it was not possible to re- move any coke after the reaction stopped.
          The conclusion must be that hydrogen is active in preventing coke forma- tion but does not remove any significant amount of coke already formed.
          During the reaction, on the other hand, the formation of coke pre- cursors is suppressed by hydrogen, and what Biswas et al. called reversible coke, can be removed by hydrogenation (38).
          This explains why hydrogen helps maintain the cata- lytic activity.

          Hydrogen cofeeding in the propane dehydrogenation (PDH) process suppresses the formation of coke, maintaining the activity of the catalyst and preventing deactivation. However, it does not remove coke that has already formed on the catalyst. Hydrogen's role in suppressing coke formation is attributed to its ability to prevent the formation of coke precursors. This effect is crucial for maintaining the catalytic activity during the reaction. Hydrogen can remove reversible coke through hydrogenation, which helps in maintaining the overall process efficiency and performance. The implications of these effects are that hydrogen cofeeding can significantly enhance the stability and efficiency of the PDH process by reducing coke formation and maintaining catalyst activity.

          在丙烷脱氢(PDH)过程中，氢气共进料抑制了焦炭的形成，维持了催化剂的活性，防止了失活。然而，它并不能去除已经沉积在催化剂上的焦炭。氢气在抑制焦炭形成中的作用归因于它能够防止焦炭前体的形成。这种效应对于维持反应过程中的催化活性至关重要。氢气可以通过氢化去除可逆焦炭，这有助于维持整体过程的效率和性能。这些效应的含义是，氢气共进料可以通过减少焦炭形成和维持催化剂活性，显著提高PDH过程的稳定性和效率。
