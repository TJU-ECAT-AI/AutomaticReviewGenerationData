[1] "Hydrogen, on the other hand, suppresses the formation."
[2] "The formation of the coke belonging to the first two peaks in the TPO profiles increases with temperature and partial pressure of propene. Hydro- gen, on the other hand, suppresses the formation."
[3] "The hydrogenoly- sis and cracking mechanisms during the propane dehydrogenation are also discussed."
[4] "Hydrogen was very efficient in preventing coke formation and deactivation but could not remove coke already formed on the catalyst."
[5] "The hydrogen to carbon ratio of the coke and the relation of the different peaks in the TPO profiles have also been analyzed, but often with contradicting results (5, 7, 9, 12, 13, 16)."

1.Hydrogen suppresses the formation of coke during propane dehydrogenation, which helps maintain the activity of the catalyst and reduces the deactivation rate. However, hydrogen does not remove any significant amount of coke already formed on the catalyst. The effect of hydrogen on energy barriers, coke accumulation patterns, acid site conversions, and graphitization is not explicitly discussed in the literature. The implications of these effects on the overall process efficiency and performance are that hydrogen can reduce the deactivation rate and formation of the main part of the coke by suppressing coke precursor formation, but it cannot remove the coke already formed on the catalyst.

1.氢气在丙烷脱氢过程中抑制焦炭的形成，有助于保持催化剂的活性并降低失活率。然而，氢气并不能从催化剂上移除大量已经形成的焦炭。文献中没有明确讨论氢气对能垒、焦炭积累模式、酸位点转化和石墨化的影响。这些影响对整体过程效率和性能的含义是，氢气可以通过抑制焦炭前体的形成来降低失活率和主要焦炭的形成，但它不能从催化剂上移除已经形成的焦炭。
