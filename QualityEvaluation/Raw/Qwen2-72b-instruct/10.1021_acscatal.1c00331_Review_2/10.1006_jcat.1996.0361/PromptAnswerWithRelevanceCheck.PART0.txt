[1] "Hydrogen, on the other hand, suppresses the formation."
[2] "The formation of the coke belonging to the first two peaks in the TPO profiles increases with temperature and partial pressure of propene. Hydro- gen, on the other hand, suppresses the formation."
[3] "The hydrogenoly- sis and cracking mechanisms during the propane dehydrogenation are also discussed."
[4] "Hydrogen was very efficient in preventing coke formation and deactivation but could not remove coke already formed on the catalyst."
[5] "The hydrogen to carbon ratio of the coke and the relation of the different peaks in the TPO profiles have also been analyzed, but often with contradicting results (5, 7, 9, 12, 13, 16)."

1.Hydrogen suppresses the formation of coke during propane dehydrogenation, which helps maintain the activity of the catalyst and reduces the deactivation rate. However, hydrogen does not remove any significant amount of coke already formed on the catalyst. The effect of hydrogen on energy barriers, coke accumulation patterns, acid site conversions, and graphitization is not explicitly discussed in the literature. The implications of these effects on the overall process efficiency and performance are that hydrogen can reduce the deactivation rate and formation of the main part of the coke by suppressing coke precursor formation, but it cannot remove the coke already formed on the catalyst.

1.氢气在丙烷脱氢过程中抑制焦炭的形成，有助于保持催化剂的活性并降低失活率。然而，氢气并不能从催化剂上移除大量已经形成的焦炭。文献中没有明确讨论氢气对能垒、焦炭积累模式、酸位点转化和石墨化的影响。这些影响对整体过程效率和性能的含义是，氢气可以通过抑制焦炭前体的形成来降低失活率和主要焦炭的形成，但它不能从催化剂上移除已经形成的焦炭。

1.Hydrogen suppresses the formation of coke during propane dehydrogenation, making it efficient in maintaining catalyst activity and preventing deactivation. However, hydrogen has little effect on removing coke already formed on the catalyst. The hydrogenolysis and cracking mechanisms during propane dehydrogenation are also influenced by hydrogen cofeeding. The implications of these effects on the overall process efficiency and performance are that hydrogen cofeeding can improve catalyst stability and reduce coke accumulation, but it does not remove existing coke. This results in better process efficiency and performance due to maintained catalytic activity.

1.氢气在丙烷脱氢过程中抑制焦炭的形成，使其在维持催化剂活性和防止失活方面效率很高。然而，氢气对催化剂上已经形成的焦炭几乎没有影响。丙烷脱氢过程中的氢解和裂解机制也受到氢气共进料的影响。这些效应对整体过程效率和性能的影响是，氢气共进料可以提高催化剂稳定性，减少焦炭积累，但不会去除现有焦炭。这导致了由于维持了催化活性，过程效率和性能更好。

1.Hydrogen cofeeding in the propane dehydrogenation (PDH) process suppresses the formation of coke, which is beneficial for catalyst stability and reaction mechanisms. Hydrogen is very efficient in preventing coke formation and deactivation, but it cannot remove coke that has already formed on the catalyst. The hydrogenolysis and cracking mechanisms during propane dehydrogenation are also affected by hydrogen cofeeding. Hydrogen has little effect on the coke formed during the experiments, but it can prevent the formation of coke precursors. A part of the coke belonging to peak 1 is responsible for the deactivation of the active sites on the metal and hinders the transport of coke precursors to the support, which increases the coke accumulation on the platinum. The addition of tin to the platinum catalyst reduces the metal-carbon bond, leaving a larger metal surface free and promoting the migration of coke precursors to the carrier. Hydrogen is active in preventing coke formation but does not remove any significant amount of coke already formed. During the reaction, the formation of coke precursors is suppressed by hydrogen, which can remove reversible coke by hydrogenation. This explains why hydrogen helps maintain the catalytic activity.
The implications of these effects on the overall process efficiency and performance are that hydrogen cofeeding can improve the stability and activity of the catalyst, reduce coke formation, and maintain the catalytic activity. However, it cannot remove coke that has already formed on the catalyst, which may limit the long-term stability of the catalyst.

1.在丙烷脱氢(PDH)过程中，氢气共进料抑制了焦炭的形成，这对催化剂的稳定性和反应机制是有益的。氢气在防止焦炭形成和失活方面非常有效，但它不能去除催化剂上已经形成的焦炭。丙烷脱氢过程中的氢解和裂解机制也受到氢气共进料的影响。氢气对实验中形成的焦炭几乎没有影响，但它可以防止焦炭前体的形成。属于第一峰的一部分焦炭对金属活性位点的失活负责，并阻碍了焦炭前体向支撑物的传输，这增加了铂上的焦炭积累。向铂催化剂中添加锡减少了金属-碳键，留下更大的金属表面自由，并促进了焦炭前体向载体的迁移。氢气在防止焦炭形成方面是活跃的，但不会去除任何显著量的已经形成的焦炭。在反应过程中，焦炭前体的形成被氢气抑制，这可以通过氢化去除可逆焦炭。这解释了为什么氢气有助于维持催化活性。
这些影响对整体过程效率和性能的含义是，氢气共进料可以提高催化剂的稳定性和活性，减少焦炭的形成，并维持催化活性。然而，它不能去除催化剂上已经形成的焦炭，这可能限制了催化剂的长期稳定性。

1.Hydrogen cofeeding in the propane dehydrogenation (PDH) process suppresses the formation of coke, maintaining the activity of the catalyst and preventing deactivation. However, it does not remove coke that has already formed on the catalyst. Hydrogen's role in suppressing coke formation is attributed to its ability to prevent the formation of coke precursors. This effect is crucial for maintaining the catalytic activity during the reaction. Hydrogen can remove reversible coke through hydrogenation, which helps in maintaining the overall process efficiency and performance. The implications of these effects are that hydrogen cofeeding can significantly enhance the stability and efficiency of the PDH process by reducing coke formation and maintaining catalyst activity.
