1.Hydrogen cofeeding in the propane dehydrogenation (PDH) process suppresses the formation of coke, which is beneficial for catalyst stability and reaction mechanisms. Hydrogen is very efficient in preventing coke formation and deactivation, but it cannot remove coke that has already formed on the catalyst. The hydrogenolysis and cracking mechanisms during propane dehydrogenation are also affected by hydrogen cofeeding. Hydrogen has little effect on the coke formed during the experiments, but it can prevent the formation of coke precursors. A part of the coke belonging to peak 1 is responsible for the deactivation of the active sites on the metal and hinders the transport of coke precursors to the support, which increases the coke accumulation on the platinum. The addition of tin to the platinum catalyst reduces the metal-carbon bond, leaving a larger metal surface free and promoting the migration of coke precursors to the carrier. Hydrogen is active in preventing coke formation but does not remove any significant amount of coke already formed. During the reaction, the formation of coke precursors is suppressed by hydrogen, which can remove reversible coke by hydrogenation. This explains why hydrogen helps maintain the catalytic activity.
The implications of these effects on the overall process efficiency and performance are that hydrogen cofeeding can improve the stability and activity of the catalyst, reduce coke formation, and maintain the catalytic activity. However, it cannot remove coke that has already formed on the catalyst, which may limit the long-term stability of the catalyst.

1.在丙烷脱氢(PDH)过程中，氢气共进料抑制了焦炭的形成，这对催化剂的稳定性和反应机制是有益的。氢气在防止焦炭形成和失活方面非常有效，但它不能去除催化剂上已经形成的焦炭。丙烷脱氢过程中的氢解和裂解机制也受到氢气共进料的影响。氢气对实验中形成的焦炭几乎没有影响，但它可以防止焦炭前体的形成。属于第一峰的一部分焦炭对金属活性位点的失活负责，并阻碍了焦炭前体向支撑物的传输，这增加了铂上的焦炭积累。向铂催化剂中添加锡减少了金属-碳键，留下更大的金属表面自由，并促进了焦炭前体向载体的迁移。氢气在防止焦炭形成方面是活跃的，但不会去除任何显著量的已经形成的焦炭。在反应过程中，焦炭前体的形成被氢气抑制，这可以通过氢化去除可逆焦炭。这解释了为什么氢气有助于维持催化活性。
这些影响对整体过程效率和性能的含义是，氢气共进料可以提高催化剂的稳定性和活性，减少焦炭的形成，并维持催化活性。然而，它不能去除催化剂上已经形成的焦炭，这可能限制了催化剂的长期稳定性。
