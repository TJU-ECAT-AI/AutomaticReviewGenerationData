[1] "Hydrogen, on the other hand, suppresses the formation."
[2] "The conclusion from the different experiments with hydrogen treatment of coked catalysts must be that hydrogen has little effect on the coke formed during the experiments."
[3] "Hydrogen was very efficient in preventing coke formation and deactivation but could not remove coke already formed on the catalyst."
[4] "The hydrogenoly- sis and cracking mechanisms during the propane dehydrogenation are also discussed."
[5] "Hydrogen has proven to be very efficient in maintaining the activity of the catalyst and also suppressing the coke formation."
[6] "This explains why hydrogen helps maintain the cata- lytic activity."

1.Hydrogen suppresses the formation of coke during propane dehydrogenation, making it efficient in maintaining catalyst activity and preventing deactivation. However, hydrogen has little effect on removing coke already formed on the catalyst. The hydrogenolysis and cracking mechanisms during propane dehydrogenation are also influenced by hydrogen cofeeding. The implications of these effects on the overall process efficiency and performance are that hydrogen cofeeding can improve catalyst stability and reduce coke accumulation, but it does not remove existing coke. This results in better process efficiency and performance due to maintained catalytic activity.

1.氢气在丙烷脱氢过程中抑制焦炭的形成，使其在维持催化剂活性和防止失活方面效率很高。然而，氢气对催化剂上已经形成的焦炭几乎没有影响。丙烷脱氢过程中的氢解和裂解机制也受到氢气共进料的影响。这些效应对整体过程效率和性能的影响是，氢气共进料可以提高催化剂稳定性，减少焦炭积累，但不会去除现有焦炭。这导致了由于维持了催化活性，过程效率和性能更好。
