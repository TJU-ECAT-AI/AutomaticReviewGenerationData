Modeling of Pt-Sn/γ-Al2O3 deactivation in propane dehydrogenation with oxygenated additives Abolfazl Samavati, Moslem Fattahi, and Farhad Khorasheh Department of Chemical and Petroleum Engineering, Sharif University of Technology, Azadi Avenue, P. O. Box 11365-9465, Tehran, Iran (Received 12 November 2011 • accepted 18 June 2012) AbstractA reduction in catalyst activity with time-on-stream and formation of side products are the major problems associated with catalytic propane dehydrogenation. Coke formation on the catalyst surface is the most important cause for catalyst deactivation. Experiments have indicated that the presence of very small amounts of oxygenated additives such as water can reduce the amount of coke accumulated on the catalyst surface and enhance catalyst activity. Addition of water beyond an optimum level, however, would result in a loss of activity due to sintering of catalyst. Propane de- hydrogenation over a Pt-Sn/γ-Al2O3 catalyst in the temperature range of 575 to 620 oC was investigated in the presence of small amounts of water added to the feed. A monolayer-multilayer mechanism was used to model the coke growth kinetics. Coke deposition and catalyst sintering were considered in a catalyst deactivation model to explain the observed optimum level in the amounts of water added to the feed. The model predictions for both propane conversion and coke formation with time-on-stream were in good agreement with experimental data.

INTRODUCTION
The increase in the demand for lower olens during the last decade has initiated the development of new alternative processes in addi- tion to traditional petrochemical or renery processes, where lower olens are obtained as by-products [1]. The dehydrogenation of light alkanes is an important reaction from an industrial point of view,since it is a selective process to produce the corresponding short- chain alkenes via direct catalytic dehydrogenation [2]. Dehydroge- nation reactions of lower alkanes are highly endothermic and are carried out at high temperatures because of thermodynamic con- straints. At these high temperatures carbonaceous deposits, collec- tively termed coke, are rapidly formed causing catalyst deactivation and necessitating catalyst regeneration [3]. Traditionally, the most important processes to obtain propylene have been steam cracking of hydrocarbon feedstocks and renery conversion processes (e.g.,uid catalytic cracking, visbreaking and coking). The increasing de- mand for propylene derivatives, outstripped the availability from these established sources, and processes for the on-purpose pro- duction of propylene by the dehydrogenation of propane have been developed commercially. Moreover, there are other paths to obtain the alkenes from corresponding alkanes including oxidative dehy- drogenation and metathesis [4-7]. Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) has been considered as an alternative route for production of propy- lene, which is an important raw material in the production of polypro- pylene, acrolein, acrylic acid, polygas chemicals and oligomers [8,9].
Dehydrogenation of propane is a highly endothermic and equilib- rium limited reaction that requires relatively high temperatures and low pressures to achieve high yields of propylene [10,11]:
C3H8C3H6+H2
H0
298=124 kJ/mol (1) The reaction is generally carried out at 525-625 oC near atmo- spheric pressures using supported platinum or chromia catalysts.
Pt-Sn/γ-Al2O3 has been used extensively as a catalyst for propane dehydrogenation both at laboratory and industrial scales. This cata- lyst exhibits a high activity and a high selectivity to propylene in propane dehydrogenation [12-14]. The role of platinum modifiers is to selectively weaken the platinum-paraffin interaction. Arsenic,tin or germanium are among the metals reported as being platinum activity modifiers. The formation of short chain hydrocarbons (crack- ing and hydrogenolysis) and coke (coking) are the main undesired reactions associated with propane dehydrogenation. Furthermore,coke is rapidly formed at high temperatures, and as a consequence the catalyst is deactivated [15,16]. The main problem in catalytic PDH is the rapid catalyst deactivation due to coke formation [3,17].
Water and light oxygenates could serve as catalyst modifier when used in low levels in the feed stream. Pt-based catalysts are poi- soned by high levels of oxygenates by various mechanisms. Oxy- genates could also deplete chlorine, essential for re-dispersion of sintered platinum, from the catalyst. When used in appropriate lev- els, however, they could exhibit beneficial effects on catalyst per- formance without the adverse effects [18]. The addition of water as an oxygenated modifier to the feed in optimum amounts could result in a substantial reduction in coke formation as well as an increase in the catalyst activity. Some studies have indicated that addition of small amounts of oxygen can improve pretreatment in catalytic PDH [19]. In this work catalytic PHD was carried out in a fixed-bed quartz reactor in the temperature range of 575 to 620 oC using a Pt-Sn/γ- Al2O3 catalyst with feed containing small amounts of water. We pres- ent a kinetic model for the propane dehydrogenation and coke forma- tion and investigate the effect of small amounts of water added to 56

METHODS AND MATERIALS
A laboratory scale tubular flow reactor was used for the PDH experiments. The inside diameter of the reactor was 12 mm, the length of the reactor was 100 cm, and the catalyst was loaded in the middle section of the reactor in between two layers of quarts particles. The commercial Pt-Sn/γ-Al2O3 catalyst was supplied by a European company. Details of the chemical composition of the cata- lyst, catalyst particle size, and pretreatment conditions are provided elsewhere [20]. The catalyst loading was 1 gram. All experiments were conducted at WHSV=2 h1 and hydrogen to propane ratio, H2/HC, of 0.8 that are typical of industrial conditions. Propane dehy- drogenation was performed at 575, 600, 620 oC near atmospheric pressure (0.8 bar) with different amounts of water in the feed. The product samples were analyzed 3hours after the start of the run when stable conditions were achieved. Product samples were then ana- lyzed hourly up to 7 hours after the start of the run. Experimental propane conversions for different amounts of water in the feed are presented in Tables 1, 2 and 3 for reaction temperatures of 575, 600,and 620 oC, respectively. Details of the experimental procedures and analyses are reported elsewhere [20,21]. The influence of exter- nal and internal mass transfer limitations were examined for pro- Table 1.

Chem. Eng.(Vol. 30, No. 1) a different investigation [14]. Both external and internal mass trans- fer limitations were negligible under the feed flow rates and cata- lyst particle sizes that were employed in the present study.
KINETIC MODEL
1. Propane Dehydrogenation
A widely accepted mechanism for PDH over supported plati- num on γ-Al2O3 has been suggested by Biloen et al. [22] where β H-elimination is considered as the rate-determining step in dehy- drogenation of propane. The addition of small amounts of water can result in the formation of hydroxyl groups that could enhance the β H-elimination step. The proposed kinetic scheme for the pro- pane reactions over Pt-Sn/γ-Al2O3 catalyst in the presence of water is a parallel network of reactions including: Dehydrogenation reaction:
C3H8C3H6+H2
(2) Cracking reaction:
C3H8C2H4+CH4
(3) Ethylene hydrogenation:
C2H4+H2C2H6
(4) Coke formation:
C3H63CH0.5+2.25H2
(5) The following reactions can also occur in propane dehydroge- nation in the presence of water [23]:
C3H6+3H2O3CO+6H2
(6)
C3H6+6H2O3CO2+9H2
(7) When water is present in only small amounts, the rates of reac- tions (6) and (7) are negligible compared with dehydrogenation,cracking and coking reaction rates. The main influence of water is on coke formation and catalyst sintering. According to Lobera et al. [15],the kinetic expression for the main dehydrogenation reaction (2) is:(8) where a is the catalyst activity and KC3H6 is propylene adsorption constant given by:(9) where KC3H6, 0 is propylene adsorption constant at reference tem- perature, T0, and HC3H6 is propylene adsorption enthalpy. This model is based on a Langmuir-Hinshelwood model and assumes that pro- pane adsorption is negligible. The reaction rate constants are described by the Arrhenius equation as follows:(10) where Eai is the activation energy, T0 the reference temperature (taken as 870.65 K), R is the gas constant (8.31451 J·mol1·K1) and k0i the kinetic rate constant at T0. Keq is the equilibrium constant given by:(11) The Gibbs free energy was calculated from data provided by Perry and Green [24] and the calculated values for the equilibrium con- stant at 575, 600, and 620C were 0.2924, 0.3776, and 0.4673, re- spectively. The rate of side reactions for propane cracking and ethyl- ene hydrogenation (as taken from ref. [15]) was expressed by:rcracking=k2·PC3H6 (12) rEthylene hydrogenation=k3·PC2H4·PH2 (13) where ki are the reaction rate constants described by the Arrhe- nius equation.
2. Coke Formation
Formation of coke deposits during propane dehydrogenation orig- inates almost solely from propylene [25]. The model used in this work to describe coke formation is a simple mechanistic model called the monolayer-multilayer coke growth model (MMCGM). This model was first proposed by Nam and Kittrell [26], generalized and used successfully by several authors [27]. In this model, the rate of coke deposition with time is given by the sum of coke formation on the surface of the catalyst (monolayer coke) and the rate of the simultaneous multilayer coke deposition:(14) where Cm is the coke concentration in monolayer and CM is the coke concentration in multilayer. The formation of monolayer coke is proportional to the fraction of sites uncovered on the first layer.
The kinetic order for monolayer coke formation is equal to 2, which would support the fact that the coke formation step involves two sites and also satisfactorily describes the significant initial increase in the coke formation rates versus time [15]. This type of coke quickly covers the catalyst surface and decreases the catalyst activity. The maximum coke concentration in the monolayer is fixed and is shown by Cmax. The concentration of monolayer coke with reaction time,t, is given by:(15) where k1C is a kinetic coefficient. The formation of multilayer coke can start as soon as there is monolayer coke available and is proportional to the fraction of sites covered on the monolayer. The kinetic order for multilayer coke formation is zero and its concen- tration is given by: CM=k2Ct (16) where k2C is a kinetic coefficient. Arrhenius-type parameters are used for both monolayer (i=1) and multilayer (i=2) coke formation:(17) The above equations can predict a sharp increase with time-on- stream during the initial stage of the reaction followed by a moder- ate linear increase during the later stage of the reaction stage.
The presence of steam in the reaction mixture leads to a contin- uous gasification of the deposited coke so that the experimentally measured rate of coke formation is a net rate resulting from both de- position and gasification [28]. Addition of water in optimum amounts would significantly reduce the coke deposition on the catalyst. The experimental results indicate that the spent catalyst coke content rC3H8 = ak1 PC3H8  PC3H6PH2/Keq ( ) ( )

January, 2013 continuously decreases with an increase in the feed water content [29]. To properly describe the kinetics of coke deposition on the catalyst leading to a decrease in the catalyst activity, it is important to include a kinetic expression for coke gasification which occurs in parallel with monolayer-multilayer coke formation. The follow- ing expression was used for the amount of gasified coke [29]:(18) where k2G is the gasification rate constant and is described by the Arrhenius equation, KWG is the equilibrium constant for the first stage of gasification and nG is the dependency of the number of active sites for gasification on the catalyst coke content; its value was found to be close to 1/3. The interaction between coke formation and gas- ification leads to a dynamic equilibrium coke content on the cata- lyst. Total coke content, Cc, in presence of water is given by: Cc=Cm+CMCg (19)
3. Catalyst Deactivation Model
Two important mechanisms are responsible for catalyst deacti- vation: coke formation and sintering. The catalyst activity declined with time-on-stream as coke was accumulated on the catalyst sur- face covering part of the active sites. According to the kinetic scheme,only monolayer coke would promote deactivation. This would imply that after all the monolayer coke was formed, the catalyst would have some remaining activity. The activity reduction due to mono- layer-multilayer coke formation [15] is given by:(20) where γi are parameters of the deactivation model. γ1 is given by an Arrhenius equation, and γ2 and γ3 are constants. Eq. (20) is modi- fied when some coke is gasified in the presence of water. To ac- count for this reduction in the coke content, we assumed that gasifica- tion would first involve the multilayer coke. The multilayer coke CM would be reduced by Cg, and if Cg is greater than CM, the balance would be deducted from Cm.
Presence of small amounts of water in the feed reduces coke de- position on the catalyst, thus reducing catalyst deactivation. Sinter- ing, on the other hand, is enhanced by the presence of water. Sintering is the loss of a catalysts active surface due to crystal growth of either the bulk material or the active phase. Sintering on supported metal catalysts involves complex physical and chemical phenomena. Exper- imental observations have shown that sintering is strongly tempera- ture-dependent, but is also affected by the surrounding gas atmos- phere. The sintering of precious metals becomes significant around 600 oC. The underlying mechanism of sintering of small metal parti- cles is the surface diffusion, or at higher temperatures, the mobility of larger agglomerates. Supported metal catalysts sinter relatively rapidly under an oxidizing atmosphere. Sintering is also generally accelerated in the presence of water vapor. In this study, the following equation based on an empirical model [19] is proposed to account for loss of activity due to sintering:(21) where ksin is given by ksin=k0, sin·exp[(Ea, sin/R)(1/T1/T0)], K0 is a sintering constant and fH2O is molar flow of water. The overall cata- lyst activity is given by:a=1acokeasin (22) The initial catalyst activity is taken as unity. The activity loss due to coking is decreased with increasing water content in the feed and the activity loss due to sintering is increased with increasing water content. These opposing effects of water would explain the observed optimum in the amount of water added to the feed to obtain maxi- mum activity.
4. Estimation of Kinetic Parameters
Molar flow rates of the major species, including propane, propy- lene, ethane, ethylene, and hydrogen, were obtained according to the reaction scheme given by reactions (2) to (5) and their corre- sponding kinetic expressions. The isothermal plug flow assumption for the fixed bed reactor leads to the following set of differential equations for the above species:(23) where Fi is the molar flow rate of species i, w is the catalyst mass,and ri is the net rate of formation of species i. The above equations with appropriate initial conditions corresponding to the feed inlet to the reactor were solved simultaneously using the ODE45 func- tion in MA TLAB programming software to obtain the exit pro- pane conversion. The optimum parameter estimates in the kinetic model for propane dehydrogenation, coke formation and catalyst deactivation were obtained by minimizing the root mean square (RMS) of error as the objective function defined by:(24) where l is the number of experimental points, and Xpredicted and Xexp are model predicted and experimental propane conversions,respectively. The fminsearch toolbox in MA TLAB programming software was used for optimization.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Experimental propane conversions presented in Tables 1 to 3 for the three different reaction temperatures employed in this study indi- cated that addition of water up to a certain optimum level enhanced the propane conversion. For all three temperatures, when more than the optimum amount of water was added, propane conversions fell even below the conversion levels in the absence of water. The opti- mum amount of water was found to increase with increasing tem- perature. The optimum amounts of water for reaction temperatures of 575, 600, and 620 oC, were 0.3, 0.45, and 0.5 ml/h, respectively.
In all cases any further increase in the feed water content beyond the optimum value would result in an abrupt loss in catalyst activity and propane conversion. These observations are consistent with op- posing effects of water on catalyst activity. An increase in the water content of the feed would reduce coke formation through the gasifica- tion mechanism, thus enhancing catalyst activity leading to slightly higher propane conversions compared with experiments with no Cg = k2G Cm + CM ( ) nG × time

The optimum kinetic parameters were obtained with RMS=6% and are reported in Table 4. The overall quality of optimization can be judged from an acceptable agreement between experimental and predicted propane conversions as reported in Tables1 to 3. An exam- ple is illustrated in Fig. 1 where predicted and experimental pro- pane conversions are plotted against time-on-stream for different amounts of water in the feed on for reaction temperature of 620 oC,indicating the ability of the proposed model to predict the optimum amount of water for maximum propane conversion.
The predicted coke contents of the catalyst for different amounts of water added to the feed are presented in Fig. 2 for reaction tem- perature of 620 oC, indicating that the coke content would decrease with increasing amount of water added to the feed due to coke gasifi- cation and would increase with time-on-stream. Experimental data were only available for the end of run (7 hours time-on-stream) for five experimental conditions as reported in Table 5, indicating that Table 4.

January, 2013 the agreement between experimental and predicted coke contents was satisfactory. To summarize, experimental and predicted pro- pane conversions at time-on-stream of 7 hours versus the amounts of water added to the feed are presented in Fig.3 for different reaction temperatures.
CONCLUSIONS
A kinetic model describing propane dehydrogenation, coke for- mation, and catalyst deactivation in presence of small amounts of water added as an oxygenated additive was presented for catalytic PDH over a Pt-Sn/γ-Al2O3 catalyst. Experimental propane conver- sions in the temperature range of 575 to 620 oC for various amounts of water added to the feed were used to obtain the optimized model parameters. The predicted propane conversions were in good agree- ment with experimental values. The model was also capable of pre- dicting an optimum water content that would maximize propane conversion. The occurrence of the optimum water content was due to opposing effects of water. An increase in the water content of the feed would reduce deactivation due to enhanced coke gasifica- tion on the one hand, and on the other hand, it would enhance de- activation due to sintering. Limited experimental data was avail- able for the coke content of the spent catalysts, and the agreement between experimental and predicted coke content was also satisfac- tory. The model predicts that adding water as an oxygenated additive up to the optimum levels would improve propane conversion and reduce coke formation. The optimum amount of water was found to increase with increasing reaction temperature.
