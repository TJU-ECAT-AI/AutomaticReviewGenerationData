1. The comprehensive effects and mechanisms of hydrogen cofeeding on coke formation, catalyst stability, and reaction dynamics in the propane dehydrogenation (PDH) process.

The comprehensive effects and mechanisms of hydrogen cofeeding on coke formation, catalyst stability, and reaction dynamics in the propane dehydrogenation (PDH) process have been elucidated through extensive research \[10.1002/anie.201701115\], \[10.1016/j.jcat.2010.06.016\], \[10.1039/c3cp50646k\], \[10.1039/c3cp53796j\], \[10.1006/jcat.1996.0361\], \[10.1021/acscatal.1c00331_2\], \[10.1007/s11244-011-9708-8\]. Hydrogen cofeeding suppresses coke formation by maintaining a reducing atmosphere that prevents the formation of coke precursors, akin to the effect of water vapor \[10.1002/anie.201701115\]. This mechanism enhances catalyst stability and efficiency by reducing deactivation and regeneration needs, potentially prolonging catalyst life and improving overall process performance. Hydrogen cofeeding also enhances alkene formation by accelerating hydrogen-assisted dehydrogenation of surface alkyl species, with minimal impact on alkene selectivity, which remains near 100% \[10.1016/j.jcat.2010.06.016\]. It significantly reduces coke formation on catalysts by hydrogenating coke precursor species. The presence of Ga in the catalyst further suppresses coke formation. The hydrogen-to-propane ratio impacts propene formation differently than ethene, with propene selectivity remaining above 95.5% even at high ratios. Hydrogen cofeeding transforms coke deposits, fostering smaller, less defective graphite crystallites \[10.1039/c3cp50646k\]. By competitively adsorbing on the catalyst surface, hydrogen curbs coke formation, reducing carbon species' surface coverage, and decreasing polymerization likelihood. This increases stability, conversion, and selectivity on Pt-Sn/Al2O3 catalysts, with optimal performance at 75% propane concentration. Hydrogen cofeeding reduces coke formation and enhances alkene desorption, improving reaction selectivity \[10.1039/c3cp53796j\]. It raises the energy barrier for the third, undesired cleavage step more than the first two, favoring alkene formation. Hydrogen cofeeding suppresses coke formation, maintaining catalyst activity and preventing deactivation \[10.1006/jcat.1996.0361\]. It prevents coke precursor formation, crucial for catalytic activity, and can remove reversible coke through hydrogenation, enhancing process efficiency and performance. Hydrogen cofeeding reduces coke formation and enhances catalyst stability by eliminating coke precursors \[10.1021/acscatal.1c00331_2\]. It raises the energy barrier for propylene dehydrogenation, preventing deep reactions. For PtSn/Al2O3 catalysts, hydrogen decreases coke on the support without affecting metal coke levels. Hydrogen cofeeding reduces coke formation on the support, with a minor effect on the metal \[10.1007/s11244-011-9708-8\]. It suppresses coke precursor formation, decreasing catalyst deactivation. Hydrogen decreases the total coke amount, notably reducing Peak II, associated with support-formed coke, and promotes softer coke formation.

                    Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: The literature on hydrogen cofeeding in PDH reveals a multifaceted impact on coke formation, catalyst stability, and reaction dynamics. The suppression of coke formation by hydrogen cofeeding, akin to water vapor's effect, and its role in maintaining a reducing atmosphere that prevents coke precursor formation, significantly enhances catalyst stability and efficiency. The transformation of coke deposits into smaller, less defective graphite crystallites, the reduction of coke on the support, and the promotion of softer coke formation by hydrogen cofeeding are critical for improving catalyst longevity and process efficiency. The enhancement of alkene formation and selectivity by hydrogen cofeeding, particularly through the acceleration of hydrogen-assisted dehydrogenation and the raising of energy barriers for undesired cleavage steps, suggests that small hydrogen additions can boost process efficiency and performance. Future research endeavors might focus on optimizing the hydrogen-to-propane ratio for maximum propene selectivity and minimizing coke formation. Additionally, the exploration of novel catalyst compositions, such as the inclusion of Ga, could further suppress coke formation and enhance catalyst stability. The investigation of hydrogen cofeeding's effect on energy barriers, coke accumulation patterns, acid site conversions, and graphitization could provide deeper insights into the reaction mechanisms and guide the design of more efficient PDH processes.
