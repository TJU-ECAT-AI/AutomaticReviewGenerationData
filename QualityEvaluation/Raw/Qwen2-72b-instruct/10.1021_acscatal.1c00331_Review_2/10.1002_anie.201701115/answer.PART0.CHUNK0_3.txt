1.The literature does not provide specific information on how hydrogen cofeeding affects coke formation, catalyst stability, and reaction mechanisms in the propane dehydrogenation process. However, it does mention that the addition of water vapor can suppress the formation of coke during propane dehydrogenation at high temperatures. This suggests that hydrogen cofeeding, which often accompanies water vapor in steam reforming processes, may also contribute to coke suppression and improve catalyst stability by maintaining a reducing atmosphere that prevents the formation of coke precursors. The literature does not discuss the impact of hydrogen cofeeding on energy barriers, coke accumulation patterns, acid site conversions, or graphitization. However, the suppression of coke formation by water vapor implies that hydrogen cofeeding could have similar effects, leading to improved process efficiency and performance by reducing catalyst deactivation and regeneration requirements.

1.文献没有提供氢气共馈如何影响丙烷脱氢过程中焦炭形成、催化剂稳定性和反应机制的具体信息。但是，它确实提到添加水蒸气可以在高温下丙烷转化过程中抑制焦炭的形成。这表明，氢气共馈，通常伴随着蒸汽重整过程中的水蒸气，也可能通过维持还原气氛来抑制焦炭前体的形成，从而有助于抑制焦炭的形成和提高催化剂的稳定性。文献没有讨论氢气共馈对能量壁垒、焦炭积累模式、酸位点转化或石墨化的影响。然而，水蒸气抑制焦炭形成的事实意味着氢气共馈可能有类似的效果，通过减少催化剂失活和再生需求，从而提高过程效率和性能。
