1.The literature does not provide specific information on how hydrogen cofeeding affects coke formation, catalyst stability, and reaction mechanisms in the propane dehydrogenation process. However, it does mention that the addition of water vapor can suppress the formation of coke during propane dehydrogenation at high temperatures. This suggests that hydrogen cofeeding, which often accompanies water vapor in steam reforming processes, may also contribute to coke suppression. The literature does not discuss the implications of these effects on the overall process efficiency and performance.

1.文献没有提供氢气共馈如何影响丙烷脱氢过程中焦炭形成、催化剂稳定性和反应机制的具体信息。但是，它确实提到添加水蒸气可以在高温下丙烷转化过程中几乎完全消除焦炭沉积。这表明氢气共馈，通常伴随水蒸气在蒸汽重整过程中，也可能有助于抑制焦炭的形成。文献没有讨论这些影响对整体过程效率和性能的含义。
