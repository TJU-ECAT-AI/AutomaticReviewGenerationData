In addition to hydrocarbon structure and reaction conditions, extent and rate of coke formation are also a function of the acidity and pore structure of the catalyst. Generally, the rate and extent of coke formation increase with increasing acid strength and concentration. Coke yield decreases with decreasing pore size (for a fixed acid strength and concentration); this is especially true in zeolites where shape selectivity plays an important role in coke formation. For example, coke yield in fluid catalytic cracking is only 0.4% for ZSM-5 (pore diameters of 0.54 × 0.56 nm) compared to 2.2% for Y-faujasite (aperture diameter of 0.72 nm) [82]. However, in pores of molecular diameter, a relatively small quantity of coke can cause substantial loss of activity. It should be emphasized that coke yield can vary considerably into the interior pores of a catalyst particle or along a catalyst bed, depending upon the extent to which the main and deactivation reactions are affected by film mass transport and pore diffusional resistance.
The mechanisms by which coke deactivates oxide and sulfide catalysts are, as in the case of supported metals, both chemical and physical. However, some aspects of the chemistry are quite different. The principal chemical loss of activity in oxides and sulfides is due to the strong adsorption of coke molecules on acidic sites. However, as discussed earlier, strong acid sites also play an important role in the formation of coke precursors, which subsequently undergo condensation reactions to produce large polynuclear aromatic molecules that physically coat catalytic surfaces.
Physical loss of activity also occurs as coke accumulates, ultimately partially or completely blocking catalyst pores as in supported metal catalysts. For example, in isomerization of cis-butene on SiO2/Al2O3 [85] catalyst deactivation occurs by rapid, selective poisoning of strong acid sites; coke evolved early in the reaction is soluble in dichloromethane and pyridine and is slightly aromatic.
Apparently, the blocking of active sites does not significantly affect porosity or catalyst surface area,as SiO2/Al2O3 contains relatively large mesopores.
In the case of supported bifunctional metal/metal oxide catalysts, different kinds of coke are formed on the metal and the acidic oxide support, e.g., soft coke (high H/C ratio) on Pt or PtRe metals and hard coke (low H/C ratio) on the alumina support in catalytic reforming [86]. In this case, coke precursors may be formed on the metal via hydrogenolysis, following which they migrate to the support and undergo polymerization and cyclization reactions, after which the larger molecules are dehydrogenated on the metal and finally accumulate on the support, causing loss of isomerization activity. Mild sulfiding of these catalysts (especially PtRe/alumina) substantially reduces the rate of hydrogenolysis and the overall formation of coke on both metal and support; it especially reduces the hard coke, which is mainly responsible for deactivation.
Several recent studies [82,8797] have focused on coke formation during hydrocarbon reactions in zeolites including (1) the detailed chemistry of coke precursors and coke molecules formed in zeolite pores and pore intersections (or supercages) and (2) the relative importance of adsorption on acid sites versus pore blockage. The principal conclusions from these studies can be summarized as follows:(1) the formation of coke and the manner in which it deactivates a zeolite catalyst are shape-selective processes, (2) deactivation is mainly due to the formation and retention of heavy aromatic clusters in pores and pore intersections, and (3) while both acid-site poisoning and pore blockage participate in the deactivation, the former dominates at low coking rates, low coke coverages (e.g., in Y-zeolite below 2 wt%), and high temperatures, while the latter process dominates at high reaction rates, high Catalysts 2015, 5

coke coverages, and low temperatures. Thus, pore size and pore structure are probably more important than acid strength and density under typical commercial process conditions. Indeed, deactivation is typically more rapid in zeolites having small pores or apertures and/or a monodimensional structure [95]. Figure 16 illustrates four possible modes of deactivation of HZSM-5 by carbonaceous deposits with increasing severity of coking [95].
Figure 16. Schematic of the four possible modes of deactivation by carbonaceous deposits in HZSM-5: (1) reversible adsorption on acid sites, (2) irreversible adsorption on sites with partial blocking of pore intersections, (3) partial steric blocking of pores, and (4) extensive steric blocking of pores by exterior deposits. Adapted from [95].
These conclusions (in the previous paragraph) are borne out, for example, in the study by Cerqueira and co-workers [97] of USHY zeolite deactivation during methylcyclohexane transformation at 450 C,showing the following:(1) Coke is probably mainly formed by rapid transformation of toluenic C7 carbenium ions with lesser contributions from reactions of cyclopentadiene, C3C6 olefins, and aromatics.
(2) Soluble coke consists of polynuclear aromatic clusters containing three to seven five- and six-membered rings having a typical compositions of C30H40 to C40H44 and having dimensions of 0.9 × 1.1 nm to 1.1 × 1.5 nm, i.e., sizes that would cause them to be trapped in the supercages of Y-zeolite.
(3) At short contact times, coking is relatively slow and deactivation is mainly due to acid-site poisoning, while at long contact times, coking is much faster because of the high concentrations of coke precursors; under these latter conditions coke is preferentially deposited at the outer pore openings of zeolite crystallites and deactivation is dominated by pore-mouth blockage.
That coke formed at large contact times not only blocks pores and/or pore intersections inside the zeolite, but also migrates to the outside of zeolite crystallites, where it blocks pore entrances, has been observed in several studies [91,93,94,97]. However, the amount, structure, and location of coke in ZSM-5 depends strongly on the coke precursor, e.g., coke formed from mesitylene is deposited on the external zeolite surface, whereas coking with isobutene leads to largely paraffinic deposits inside

pores; coke from toluene, on the other hand, is polyaromatic and is deposited both on external and internal zeolite surfaces [91].
2.3. Thermal Degradation and Sintering
2.3.1. Background
Thermally induced deactivation of catalysts results from (1) loss of catalytic surface area due to crystallite growth of the catalytic phase, (2) loss of support area due to support collapse and of catalytic surface area due to pore collapse on crystallites of the active phase, and/or (3) chemical transformations of catalytic phases to noncatalytic phases. The first two processes are typically referred to as sintering. The third is discussed in the next section under solidsolid reactions. Sintering processes generally take place at high reaction temperatures (e.g., > 500 C) and are generally accelerated by the presence of water vapor.
Most of the previous sintering and redispersion work has focused on supported metals.
Experimental and theoretical studies of sintering and redispersion of supported metals published before 1997 have been reviewed fairly extensively [8,98107]. Three principal mechanisms of metal crystallite growth have been advanced: (1) crystallite migration, (2) atomic migration, and (3) (at very high temperatures) vapor transport. The processes of crystallite and atomic migration are illustrated in Figure 17. Crystallite migration involves the migration of entire crystallites over the support surface,followed by collision and coalescence. Atomic migration involves detachment of metal atoms or molecular metal clusters from crystallites, migration of these atoms over the support surface, and ultimately, capture by larger crystallites. Redispersion, the reverse of crystallite growth in the presence of O2 and/or Cl2, may involve (1) formation of volatile metal oxide or metal chloride complexes that attach to the support and are subsequently decomposed to small crystallites upon reduction and/or (2) formation of oxide particles or films that break into small crystallites during subsequent reduction.

There is controversy in the literature regarding which mechanism of sintering (or redispersion) operates at a given set of conditions. Logically, atomic migration would be favored at lower temperatures than crystallite migration, since the higher diffusivities of atoms or small cluster would facilitate their migration, whereas the thermal energy necessary to induce motion of larger crystallites would only be available at higher temperatures. Moreover, migration of small crystallites might be favorable early in the sintering process but unfavorable as crystallites become larger. However, Catalysts 2015, 5
171
focusing on only one of the three sintering mechanisms (and two dispersion mechanisms) is a simplification that ignores the possibility that all mechanisms may occur simultaneously and may be coupled with each other through complex physicochemical processes, including the following:(1) dissociation and emission of metal atoms or metal-containing molecules from metal crystallites,(2) adsorption and trapping of metal atoms or metal-containing molecules on the support surface,(3) diffusion of metal atoms, metal-containing molecules and/or metal crystallites across support surfaces, (4) metal or metal oxide particle spreading, (5) support surface wetting by metal particles,(6) metal particle nucleation, (7) coalescence of, or bridging between, two metal particles, (8) capture of atoms or molecules by metal particles, (9) liquid formation, (10) metal volatilization through volatile compound formation, (11) splitting of crystallites in O2 atmosphere owing to formation of oxides of a different specific volume, and (12) metal atom vaporization. Depending upon reaction or redispersion conditions, a few or all of these processes may be important; thus, the complexity of sintering/redispersion processes is emphasized.
In general, thermal sintering processes are kinetically slow (at moderate reaction temperatures) and irreversible or difficult to reverse. Thus, sintering is more easily prevented than cured.
2.3.2. Factors Affecting Metal Particle Growth and Redispersion in Supported Metals
Temperature, atmosphere, metal type, metal dispersion, promoters/impurities, and support surface area,texture, and porosity are the principal parameters affecting rates of sintering and redispersion (see Table 8) [8,103107]. Sintering rates increase exponentially with temperature. Metals sinter relatively rapidly in oxygen and relatively slowly in hydrogen, although depending upon the support, metal redispersion can be facilitated by exposure at high temperature (e.g., 500550 C for Pt/Al2O3) to oxygen and chlorine,followed by reduction. Water vapor also increases the sintering rate of supported metals, likely through chemical-assisted sintering effects similar to those described in Section 2.4.3.
Table 8. Effects of Important Reaction and Catalyst Variables on Sintering Rates of Supported Metals Based on General Power-Law Expression (GPLE) Data a.
Variable Effect Temperature Sintering rates are exponentially dependent on T; Eact varies from 30 to 150 kJ/mol. Eact decreases with increasing metal loading; it increases in the following order with atmosphere: NO < O2 < H2 < N2 Atmosphere Sintering rates are much higher for noble metals in O2 than in H2 and higher for noble and base metals in H2 relative to N2. Sintering rate decreases for supported Pt in atmospheres in the following order: NO > O2 > H2 > N2 Metal Observed order of decreasing thermal stability in H2 is Ru > Ir Rh > Pt; thermal stability in O2 is a function of (1) volatility of metal oxide and (2) strength of metal oxidesupport interaction Support Metalsupport interactions are weak (bond strengths of 515 kJ/mol); with a few exceptions, thermal stability for a given metal decreases with support in the following order: Al2O3 > SiO2 > carbon Promoters Some additives decrease atom mobility, e.g., C, O, CaO, BaO, CeO2, GeO2; others increase atom mobility, e.g., Pb, Bi, Cl, F, or S. Oxides of Ba, Ca, or Sr are trapping agents that decrease sintering rate Pore size Sintering rates are lower for porous versus nonporous supports; they decrease as crystallite diameters approach those of the pores a Refs. [8,103107]. For the definition of a GPLE, see Equation 2 later in this section.

Normalized dispersion (percentage of metal exposed at any time divided by the initial percentage exposed) versus time data in Figure 18 show that at temperatures of 650 C or higher, rates of metal surface area loss (measured by hydrogen chemisorption) due to sintering of Ni/silica in hydrogen atmosphere are significant, causing 70% loss of the original metal surface area within 50 h at 750 C.
In reducing atmosphere, metal crystallite stability generally decreases with decreasing metal melting temperature, i.e., in the order Ru > Ir > Rh > Pt > Pd > Ni > Cu > Ag, although this order may be affected by relatively stronger metalsupport interactions, e.g., the observed order of decreasing stability of supported platinum in vacuum is Pt/Al2O3 > Pt/SiO2 > Pt/C. In oxidizing atmospheres,metal crystallite stability depends on the volatility of metal oxides and the strength of the metaloxide support interaction. For noble metals, metal stability in air decreases in the order Rh > Pt > Ir > Ru;formation of volatile RuO4 accounts for the relative instability of ruthenium.

The effect of temperature on sintering of metals and oxides can be understood physically in terms of the driving forces for dissociation and diffusion of surface atoms, which are both proportional to the fractional approach to the absolute melting point temperature (Tmp). Thus, as temperature increases, the mean lattice vibration of surface atoms increases; when the Httig temperature (0.3Tmp) is reached, less strongly bound surface atoms at defect sites (e.g., edges and corner sites) dissociate and diffuse readily over the surface, while at the Tamman temperature (0.5Tmp), atoms in the bulk become mobile.
Accordingly, sintering rates of a metal or metal oxide are significant above the Httig temperature and very high near the Tamman temperature; thus, the relative thermal stability of metals or metal oxides can be correlated in terms of the Httig or Tamman temperatures [109]. This can be illustrated from values of the melting and Tamman temperatures for noble and base metals and their compounds listed in Table 9. For example, sintering of copper catalysts for methanol synthesis is promoted by traces of chlorine in the feed, which react at about 225 C (500 K) with the active metal/metal oxide surface to produce a highly mobile copper chloride phase having a Tamman temperature of only 79174 C (352447 K) relative to 405527 C (678800 K) for copper metal or metal oxides [110].

[109].Promoters or impurities affect sintering and redispersion by either increasing (e.g., chlorine and sulfur) or decreasing (e.g., oxygen, calcium, cesium) metal atom mobility on the support; in the latter case, this is due to their high resistance to dissociation and migration due to high melting points, as well as their hindering dissociation and surface diffusion of other atoms. Similarly, support surface defects or pores impede surface migration of metal particlesespecially micropores and mesopores with pore diameters about the same size as the metal crystallites.

sintering processes because it assumes that surface area or dispersion ultimately reaches zero, given sufficient time, when in fact, for a given temperature and atmosphere, a nonzero or limiting dispersion is observed after long sintering times. Moreover, the use of the SPLE is further questionable because variations in sintering order are observed as a function of time and temperature for a given catalyst in a fixed atmosphere [105107]; thus, data obtained for different samples and different reaction conditions cannot be quantitatively compared. Nevertheless, it has been shown by Fuentes [111,112] and Bartholomew [104106] that the effects of temperature, atmosphere, metal, promoter, and support can be quantitatively determined by fitting sintering kinetic data to the general power-law expression (GPLE)
(2) which adds a term Deq/D0 to account for the observed asymptotic approach of the typical dispersion versus time curve to a limiting dispersion Deq at infinite time; m, the order of sintering, is found to be either 1 or 2. A recently compiled, comprehensive quantitative treatment of previous sintering rate data based on the GPLE with an order m of 2 [104106] quantitatively addresses the effects of catalyst properties and reaction conditions on sintering rate. Some of these data are summarized in Table 10 [108,113115]. These data show, for example, that the rate constant, and hence the rate of sintering, is less for Ni/Al2O3 than for Pt/Al2O3, an unexpected result in view of the lower heat of vaporization for Ni. This result is possibly explained by a greater metal support interaction for Ni with alumina.

Sintering studies of supported metals are generally of two types: (1) studies of commercially relevant supported metal catalysts and (2) studies of model metalsupport systems. The former type provides useful rate data that can be used to predict sintering rates, while the latter type provides insights into the mechanisms of metal particle migration and sintering, although the results cannot be quantitatively extrapolated to predict behavior of commercial catalysts. There is direct evidence from the previous studies of model-supported catalysts [104,107] for the occurrence of crystallite migration (mainly in well-dispersed systems early in the sintering process), atomic migration (mainly at longer Catalysts 2015, 5
175
sintering times), and spreading of metal crystallites (mainly in oxygen atmosphere). There is also evidence that under reaction conditions, the surface is dynamic, i.e., adsorbates and other adatoms rapidly restructure the surface and slowly bring about faceting; moreover, thermal treatments cause gradual changes in the distribution of coordination sites to minimize surface energy. There is a trend in increasing sophistication of spectroscopic tools used to study sintering and redispersion. In the next decade, we might expect additional insights into atomic and molecular processes during reaction at the atomic scale using STM, analytical high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM), and other such powerful surface science tools.
2.3.3. Sintering of Catalyst Carriers
Sintering of carriers (supports) has been reviewed by Baker and co-workers [103] and Trimm [116].
Single-phase oxide carriers sinter by one or more of the following processes: (1) surface diffusion,(2) solid-state diffusion, (3) evaporation/condensation of volatile atoms or molecules, (4) grain boundary diffusion, and (5) phase transformations. In oxidizing atmospheres, γ-alumina and silica are the most thermally stable carriers; in reducing atmospheres, carbons are the most thermally stable carriers. Additives and impurities affect the thermal properties of carriers by occupying defect sites or forming new phases. Alkali metals, for example, accelerate sintering; while calcium, barium, nickel,and lanthanum oxides form thermally stable spinel phases with alumina. Steam accelerates support sintering by forming mobile surface hydroxyl groups that are subsequently volatilized at higher temperatures. Chlorine also promotes sintering and grain growth in magnesia and titania during high temperature calcination. This is illustrated in Figure 19 [117]. By contrast, sulfuric acid treatment of hydrated alumina (gibbsite) followed by two-step calcination, results in a very stable transitional alumina with needle-like particle morphology [116]. Dispersed metals in supported metal catalysts can also accelerate support sintering; for example, dispersed nickel accelerates the loss of Al2O3 surface area in Ni/Al2O3 catalysts.
As an important example of support sintering through phase transformations, Al2O3 has a rich phase behavior as a function of temperature and preparation. A few among the many important phases that are stable or metastable, include boehmite, γ-alumina, and α-alumina [8,118,119]. Other phases are possible and the temperatures at which the phase transitions occur depend on crystal size and moisture content of the starting material, but as an example, as temperature is raised, boehmite, which is a hydrated or hydroxyl form of alumina, transforms to γ-alumina between 300 and 450 C, then to δ-alumina at 850C, θ-alumina at 1000C, and finally α-alumina at 1125 C. The corresponding crystal structures for these five phases are orthorhombic, cubic defective spinel, orthorhombic,deformed monoclinic spinel, and hexagonal close pack (hcp with ABAB stacking) [8,118,119]. The approximate surface areas of these respective phases, as measured by nitrogen physisorption using Brunauer, Emmett, Teller (BET) analysis, are approximately 400, 200, 120, 50, and 1 m2/g [8]. The dramatic drop in surface area during the transition from θ to α is associated with collapse of the microporous structure and formation of the dense hcp phase.

2.3.4. Effects of Sintering on Catalyst Activity
Baker and co-workers [103] have reviewed the effects of sintering on catalytic activity. Specific activity (based on catalytic surface area) can either increase or decrease with increasing metal crystallite size during sintering if the reaction is structure-sensitive, or it can be independent of changes in metal crystallite size if the reaction is structure-insensitive. Thus, for a structure-sensitive reaction, the impact of sintering may be either magnified or moderated; while for a structure insensitive-reaction, sintering has in principle no effect on specific activity (per unit surface area). In the latter case, the decrease in mass-based activity is proportional to the decrease in metal surface area. Ethane hydrogenolysis and ethane steam reforming are examples of structure-sensitive reactions, while CO hydrogenation on supported cobalt, nickel, iron, and ruthenium is largely structure-insensitive in catalysts of moderate loading and dispersion.
2.4. Gas/VaporSolid and Solid-State Reactions
In addition to poisoning, there are a number of chemical routes leading to catalyst deactivation:(1) reactions of the vapor phase with the catalyst surface to produce (a) inactive bulk and surface phases (rather than strongly adsorbed species), (b) volatile compounds that exit the catalyst and reactor in the vapor phase, or (c) sintering due to adsorbate interactions, that we call chemical-assisted sintering to distinguish it from thermal sintering previously discussed; (2) catalytic solid-support or catalytic solid-promoter reactions, and (3) solid-state transformations of the catalytic phases during reaction. Each of these routes is discussed in some detail below.
2.4.1. Gas/VaporSolid Reactions
2.4.1.1. Reactions of Gas/Vapor with Solid to Produce Inactive Phases
Dispersed metals, metal oxides, metal sulfides, and metal carbides are typical catalytic phases, the surfaces of which are similar in composition to the bulk phases. For a given reaction, one of these catalyst types is generally substantially more active than the others, e.g., only Fe and Ru metals are active for ammonia synthesis, while the oxides, sulfides, and carbides are inactive. If, therefore, one of these metal catalysts is oxidized, sulfided, or carbided, it will lose essentially all of its activity. While these chemical modifications are closely related to poisoning, the distinction here is that rather than losing activity owing to the presence of an adsorbed species, the loss of activity is due to the formation of a new phase altogether.
Examples of vapor-induced chemical transformations of catalysts to inactive phases are listed in Table 11 [8,120127]. These include the formation of RhAl2O4 in the three-way PtRh/Al2O3 catalyst during high temperature operation in an auto exhaust; oxidation of Fe by low levels of O2 during ammonia synthesis or by H2O during regeneration; dealumination (migration of Al from the zeolite framework) of Y-zeolite during high temperature catalytic cracking and regeneration in steam; reaction of SO3 with the alumina support to form aluminum sulfate leading to support breakdown and catalyst pore plugging in several processes, including CO oxidation in a gas turbine exhaust, conversion of CO and hydrocarbons in a diesel exhaust converter, and selective catalytic reduction (SCR) of NOx in utility boiler flue gases [8,122124,127]; oxidation of Fe5C2 to Fe3O4 and of Co metal supported on alumina or Catalysts 2015, 5

silica to Co surface aluminates or silicates during FischerTropsch synthesis at high conversions and hence high PH2O; and formation of NiAl2O4 during reaction and steam regeneration of Ni/Al2O3 in a slightly oxidizing atmosphere above about 500 C, especially if more reactive aluminas, e.g., γ, δ, or θ forms, are used as supports. Because reaction of SO3 with γ-Al2O3 to produce Al2(SO4)3 is a serious cause of deactivation of alumina-supported catalysts in several catalytic processes (e.g., diesel exhaust abatement and SCR), TiO2 or SiO2 carriers are used rather than Al2O3 or in the diesel or automotive exhaust the alumina catalyst is stabilized by addition of BaO, SrO, or ZrO2 [8,122127].

2.4.1.2. Reactions of Gas/Vapor with Solid to Produce Volatile Compounds
Metal loss through direct vaporization is generally an insignificant route to catalyst deactivation. By contrast, metal loss through formation of volatile compounds, e.g., metal carbonyls, oxides, sulfides,and halides in CO, O2, H2S, and halogen-containing environments, can be significant over a wide range of conditions, including relatively mild conditions. Classes and examples of volatile compounds are listed in Table 12. Carbonyls are formed at relatively low temperatures but high pressures of CO;halides can be formed at relatively low temperatures and low concentration of the halogens. However,the conditions under which volatile oxides are formed vary considerably with the metal; for example, RuO3 can be formed at room temperature, while PtO2 is formed at measurable rates only at temperatures exceeding about 500 C.

While the chemical properties of volatile metal carbonyls, oxides, and halides are well known, there is surprisingly little information available on their rates of formation during catalytic reactions. There have been no reviews on this subject and relatively few reported studies to define the effects of metal loss on catalytic activity [28,128141]. Most of the previous work has focused on volatilization of Ru in automotive converters [128131]; nickel carbonyl formation in nickel catalysts during methanation of CO [133,139] or during CO chemisorption at 25 C [28,135], and formation of Ru carbonyls during FischerTropsch synthesis [136,137]; volatilization of Pt during ammonia oxidation on PtRh gauze catalysts [140,141]; and volatilization of Cu from methanol synthesis and diesel soot oxidation catalysts,leading to sintering in the former and better catalystsoot contact but also metal loss in the latter case [109].
Results of selected studies are summarized in Table 13. Bartholomew [131] found evidence of significant (50%) Ru loss after testing of a PdRu catalyst in an actual reducing automobile exhaust for 100 h, which he attributed to formation of a volatile ruthenium oxide and which was considered responsible at least in part for a significant loss (20%) of NO reduction activity.

Ni(CO)4 formation, diffusion, and decomposition on the support as large crystallites; under severe conditions (very high PCO and relatively low reaction temperatures) loss of nickel metal occurs. Thus,loss of nickel and crystallite growth could be serious problems at the entrance to methanation reactors where the temperature is low enough and PCO high enough for metal carbonyl formation. Agnelli and co-workers [139] investigated kinetics and modeling of sintering due to formation and migration of nickel carbonyl species. They found that the initially sharp crystallite size distribution evolved during several hours of sintering under low temperature (230 C) reaction conditions to a bimodal system consisting of small spherical crystallites and large faceted crystals favoring (111) planes. The sintering process was modeled in terms of an Ostwald-ripening mechanism coupled with mass transport of mobile subcarbonyl intermediates. Long-term simulations were found to predict reasonably well the ultimate state of the catalyst. On the basis of their work, they proposed two solutions for reducing loss of nickel: (1) increasing reaction temperature and decreasing CO partial pressure in order to lower the rate of carbonyl formation, and (2) changing catalyst composition, e.g., alloying nickel with copper or adding alkali to inhibit carbonyl species migration.
Of note, Kuo and Hwang have shown that the particle morphology itself affects the rate of Ostwald ripening due to different relative chemical potential energies of the surfaces [144]. Using silver nanoparticles, they found that atoms at sharp edges and corners were removed first, resulting in more rounded particles for all starting geometries. Thus, initial particle geometry appears to have an effect in addition to the chemical atmosphere experienced by the particles.
Loss of nickel metal during CO chemisorption on nickel catalysts at temperatures above 0 C is also a serious problem; moreover, this loss is catalyzed by sulfur poisoning [28]. In view of the toxicity of nickel tetracarbonyl, the rapid loss of nickel metal, and the ill-defined adsorption stoichiometries,researchers are advised to avoid using CO chemisorption for measuring nickel surface areas; instead,hydrogen chemisorption, an accepted ASTM method with a well-defined adsorption stoichiometry, is recommended [145]. Figure 20 illustrates a mechanism for the formation of Ni(CO)4 on a crystallite of nickel in CO atmosphere.

Goodwin and co-workers [136,137] studied the influence of reaction atmosphere, support, and metal particle size on the loss of Ru due to carbonyl formation. They found that the loss of Ru during CO hydrogenation (H2/CO = 1, 200250 C, 1 atm) on Ru/NaY zeolite and Ru/Al2O3 for extended periods of time was significant (e.g., up to 40% while flowing CO at 175275 C over Ru/Al2O3 for 24 h). The loss of Ru was significantly less on titania-supported Ru; moreover, the rate of loss was lower for catalysts containing large metal crystallites (3 nm) relative to those containing small metal crystallites (1.3 nm). Metal loss was inhibited in part at higher reaction temperatures as a result of carbon deposition. Thus, while it is clear that loss of ruthenium could be a serious problem in FischerTropsch synthesis, there are measures in terms of catalyst design and choice of reaction conditions that can be taken to minimize loss.
One of the most dramatic examples of vapor phase loss of the catalyst occurs during NH3 oxidation on PtRh gauze, an important reaction in the manufacture of nitric acid [8,140,141]. At the high reaction temperature (900 C), formation of a volatile platinum oxide (PtO2) occurs at a very significant rate; in fact, the rate of loss of 0.050.3 g Pt/ton of HNO3 is high enough to provide a substantial economic incentive for Pt recovery [8]. The most effective recovery process involves placing a woven Pd-rich alloy gauze immediately below the PtRh gauze to capture the Pt through formation of a PdPt alloy. Pt loss is also the most significant cause of catalyst deactivation as the gauze surface becomes enriched in nonvolatile but inactive rhodium oxide [142], requiring shutdown and catalyst replacement every 312 months [8].
Decomposition of volatile platinum oxide species formed during high temperature reaction may (similar to the previously discussed formation of large crystallites of Ni from Ni(CO)4) lead to formation of large Pt crystallites and/or substantial restructuring of the metal surface. For example, Wu and Phillips [146148] observed surface etching, enhanced sintering, and dramatic surface restructuring of Pt thin films to faceted particles during ethylene oxidation over a relatively narrow temperature range (500700 C). The substantially higher rate of sintering and restructuring in O2/C2H4 relative to that in nonreactive atmospheres was attributed to the interaction of free radicals such as HO2, formed homogeneously in the gas phase, with the metal surface to form metastable mobile intermediates. Etching of PtRh gauze in a H2/O2 mixture under the same conditions as Pt surfaces (600 C, N2/O2/H2 = 90/7.5/2.5) has also been reported [143]. A significant weight loss was observed in a laminar flow reactor with little change in surface roughness, while in an impinging jet reactor, there was little weight loss, but substantial restructuring of the surface to particle-like structures, 110 μm in diameter; these particles were found to have the same PtRh composition as the original gauze. The nodular structures of about 10-μm diameter formed in these experiments are strikingly similar to those observed on PtRh gauze after use in production of HCN at 1100 C in 15% NH3, 13% CH4, and 72% air (see Figure 21). Moreover, because of the high space velocities during HCN production, turbulent rather than laminar flow would be expected, as in the impinging jet reactor.
While little Pt is volatilized from the PtRh gauze catalyst during HCN synthesis, the extensive restructuring leads to mechanical weakening of the gauze [8].

Other examples of catalyst deactivation due to volatile compound formation include (1) loss of the phosphorus promoter from the VPO catalyst used in the fluidized-bed production of maleic anhydride, with an attendant loss of catalyst selectivity [8], (2) vapor-phase loss of the potassium promoter from steam-reforming catalysts in the high temperature, steam-containing environment [8], and (3) loss of Mo from a 12-Mo-V-heteropolyacid due to formation of a volatile Mo species during oxydehydrogenation of isobutyric acid to methacrylic acid [138].
While relatively few definitive studies of deactivation by volatile compound formation have been reported, the previous work does provide the basis for enumerating some general principles. A generalized mechanism of deactivation by formation of volatile metal compounds can be postulated (see Figure 22). In addition, the roles of kinetics and thermodynamics can be stated in general terms:(1) At low temperatures and partial pressures of the volatilization agent (VA), the overall rate of the process is limited by the rate of volatile compound formation.
(2) At intermediate temperatures and partial pressures of the VA, the rate of formation of the volatile compound exceeds the rate of decomposition. Thus, the rate of vaporization is high,the vapor is stable, and metal loss is high.
(3) At high temperatures and partial pressures of the VA, the rate of formation equals the rate of decomposition, i.e., equilibrium is achieved. However, the volatile compound may be too unstable to form or may decompose before there is an opportunity to be transported from the system. From the previous work, it is also evident that besides temperature and gas phase composition, catalyst properties (crystallite size and support) can play an important role in determining the rate of metal loss.

2.4.2. Solid-State Reactions
Catalyst deactivation by solid-state diffusion and reaction appears to be an important mechanism for degradation of complex multicomponent catalysts in dehydrogenation, synthesis, partial oxidation, and total oxidation reactions [8,149160]. However, it is difficult in most of these reactions to know the extent to which the solid-state processes, such as diffusion and solid-state reaction, are affected by surface reactions. For example, the rate of diffusion of Al2O3 to the surface to form an aluminate may be enhanced by the presence of gas-phase oxygen or water or the nucleation of a different phase may be induced by either reducing or oxidizing conditions. Recognizing this inherent limitation, the focus here is nevertheless on processes in which formation of a new bulk phase (and presumably the attendant surface phase) leads to substantially lower activity. There is probably some overlap with some of the examples given under Gas/VaporSolid Reactions involving reactions of gas/vapor with solid to produce inactive phases.
Examples from the literature of solid-state transformations leading to catalyst deactivation are summarized in Table 14. They include (1) the formation of KAlO2 during ammonia synthesis at the Fe/K/Al2O3 catalyst surface, (2) decomposition of the active phase PdO to inactive Pd metal during catalytic combustion on PdO/Al2O3 and PdO/ZrO2 catalysts, (3) transformation of active carbides to inactive carbides in FischerTropsch synthesis on Fe/K/Cu catalysts, (4) formation of inactive V(IV) compounds in SO2 oxidation, and (5) reductive transformation of iron molybdate catalysts during partial oxidation of benzene, methanol, propene, and isobutene.

A well-documented example of these principles occurs in the partial oxidation of propene to acrolein on a Fe2(MoO4)3 catalyst [153,156]. This oxidation occurs by the Mars van Krevelen mechanism, i.e., a redox mechanism in which lattice oxygen reacts with the adsorbed hydrocarbon to produce the partially oxygenated product; the reduced catalyst is restored to its oxidized state through reaction with gaseous oxygen. In propene oxidation, two atoms of oxygen from the catalyst are used,one for removing two hydrogen atoms from the olefin and the other one in forming the unsaturated aldehyde. The fresh, calcined catalyst MoO3 consists of corner-sharing MoO6 octahedra (with Mo at the center and six oxygen atoms at the corners); but upon reduction to MoO2, octahedra share edges as shown in Figure 23. However, it has been reported [153,156] that only slightly reduced (relative to MoO3), open structures such as Mo18O52 and Mo8O23 are the most active, selective phases; more complete reduction of either of these structures leads to formation of Mo4O11 (see Figure 24) having substantially lower selectivity. Delmon and co-workers [154,156] have shown that addition of an oxygen donor such as Sb2O4 facilitates spillover of oxygen and thereby prevents overreduction and deactivation of the catalyst.

2.4.3. Reactions of Gas/Vapor with Solid to Restructure the Surface by Chemical Assisted Sintering
The surfaces of metallic catalysts can be greatly roughened by interactions with the reactants and/or products. However, as opposed to forming volatile species that are transported out of the reactor as discussed in the previous section, these interactions lead to a restructuring of the surface that is similar to that which occurs during thermal sintering, but at temperatures which are below the Tamman or Huttig temperatures, respectively defined as 0.5 and 0.3 of the melting point (Tm) of the material, at which thermal sintering might be expected. Therefore, this surface restructuring must be attributed to the interaction of the gas phase with the solid. The following three examples from the literature highlight the chemical-assisted sintering process caused by adsorbate-surface interactions on Ni, Co, and Pd surfaces.
Chemical sintering of Ni/alumina catalysts in methanation due to formation of volatile Ni(CO)4 followed by its decomposition downstream to large Ni crystallites has been well documented [8,105].
Moreover, deactivation of Ni/alumina by Ni aluminate formation is also observed at the exit of methanators where temperature is moderately high (T = 450 C) and steam partial pressure is maximum [105].
Wilson and de Groot [161] reported that under high pressure (4 bar, H2/CO = 2) and moderate temperature (523 K) conditions, single crystal Co (0001) surfaces restructured significantly due to interaction with the CO, which they attributed to an etch-regrowth mechanism. The left hand panel of Figure 25a shows the scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) image of the single crystal surface, while Figure 25b shows the same location after exposure to the H2/CO atmosphere for 1 h The surface restructuring and roughening is profound, with the peaks approximately four atoms high relative to the previously smooth surface that had only well-defined steps interrupting the (0001) planar surface.

More recently, Parkinson et al. [162] have shown that chemical-assisted sintering occurs at room temperature for palladium supported on magnetite under ultra high vacuum conditions with CO partial pressures of only 5 × 1010 mbar. Figure 26 shows four STM images from a movie that demonstrates the surface mobility of the Pd at these low CO partial pressures. Figure 26a is the surface prior to CO exposure, while Figures 26bd show the surface as a function of time up to about an hour of exposure.
The authors note that hydroxyl-Pd groups (OH-Pd), identified by the ×s in the images, serve as anchoring points for the coalescence of larger Pd clusters. The full movie, available with the Catalysts 2015, 5
