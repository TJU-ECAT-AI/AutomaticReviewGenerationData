[1] "The presence of some hydrogen is known to be advantageous,5 and has been mainly attributed to a reduction in the rate of coke formation."
[2] "The presence of an adsorbed H atom on the cluster facilitates alkene desorption relative to dehydrogenation of the adsorbed alkene."
[3] "Interestingly,it raises the energy of the third and undesired cleavage step to far greater extent than it does for the first two steps."
[4] "A marginal effect on the first two CH cleavages combined with a significant shift of the third suggests that the addition of small amounts of hydrogen gas could improve the selectivity of the reaction towards the formation of alkenes."

1.The presence of hydrogen during the propane dehydrogenation (PDH) process is advantageous as it reduces the rate of coke formation. The adsorption of hydrogen atoms on the catalyst cluster facilitates the desorption of alkenes relative to the dehydrogenation of adsorbed alkenes. Hydrogen cofeeding raises the energy barrier for the third and undesired cleavage step to a greater extent than for the first two steps. This suggests that adding small amounts of hydrogen gas can improve the selectivity of the reaction towards the formation of alkenes, thereby reducing coke formation and improving catalyst stability and process efficiency.

1.在丙烷脱氢(PDH)过程中,氢气的存在是有利的,因为它可以降低焦炭的生成速率。氢原子在催化剂簇上的吸附促进了烯烃的解吸,相对于吸附烯烃的脱氢。氢气共给会将第三步和不希望发生的裂解步骤的能量屏障提高到比前两步更大的程度。这表明,添加少量氢气可以提高反应向烯烃生成的选择性,从而减少焦炭的形成,提高催化剂的稳定性和过程效率。
