[1] "The presence of some hydrogen is known to be advantageous,5 and has been mainly attributed to a reduction in the rate of coke formation."
[2] "The presence of an adsorbed H atom on the cluster facilitates alkene desorption relative to dehydrogenation of the adsorbed alkene."
[3] "Interestingly,it raises the energy of the third and undesired cleavage step to far greater extent than it does for the first two steps."
[4] "A marginal effect on the first two CH cleavages combined with a significant shift of the third suggests that the addition of small amounts of hydrogen gas could improve the selectivity of the reaction towards the formation of alkenes."

1.The co-feeding of hydrogen in the propane dehydrogenation (PDH) process is advantageous as it reduces the rate of coke formation. The presence of an adsorbed hydrogen atom on the cluster facilitates the desorption of alkenes relative to the dehydrogenation of the adsorbed alkene. Hydrogen raises the energy of the third and undesired cleavage step to a greater extent than the first two steps, which could improve the selectivity of the reaction towards the formation of alkenes. This suggests that the addition of small amounts of hydrogen gas could enhance the selectivity of the reaction towards the formation of alkenes, thereby improving the overall process efficiency and performance.

1.在丙烷脱氢(PDH)过程中共喂氢是有利的，因为它可以降低焦炭的形成速率。吸附在簇上的氢原子的存在促进了烯烃的解吸，相对于吸附的烯烃的脱氢。氢将第三步和不希望的裂解步骤的能量提高到比前两步更大的程度，这可能提高反应选择性，形成烯烃。这表明，添加少量氢气可以增强反应选择性，形成烯烃，从而提高整体过程效率和性能。
