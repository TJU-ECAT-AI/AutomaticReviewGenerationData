[1] "The presence of some hydrogen is known to be advantageous,5 and has been mainly attributed to a reduction in the rate of coke formation."
[2] "The presence of an adsorbed H atom on the cluster facilitates alkene desorption relative to dehydrogenation of the adsorbed alkene."
[3] "Interestingly,it raises the energy of the third and undesired cleavage step to far greater extent than it does for the first two steps."
[4] "A marginal effect on the first two CH cleavages combined with a significant shift of the third suggests that the addition of small amounts of hydrogen gas could improve the selectivity of the reaction towards the formation of alkenes."

1.The presence of hydrogen during the propane dehydrogenation (PDH) process is advantageous as it reduces the rate of coke formation. The adsorption of hydrogen atoms on the catalyst cluster facilitates the desorption of alkenes relative to the dehydrogenation of adsorbed alkenes. This effect is more pronounced on the third and undesired cleavage step, which raises its energy barrier more than the first two steps. As a result, the addition of small amounts of hydrogen gas can improve the selectivity of the reaction towards the formation of alkenes.

1.在丙烷脱氢(PDH)过程中,氢的存在是有利的,因为它可以降低焦炭的形成速率。氢原子在催化剂簇上的吸附有利于烯烃的解吸,而不是吸附烯烃的脱氢。这种效应在第三和不希望的裂解步骤上更为明显,它比前两个步骤提高了更多的能量障碍。因此,添加少量氢气可以提高反应向烯烃生成的选择性。
