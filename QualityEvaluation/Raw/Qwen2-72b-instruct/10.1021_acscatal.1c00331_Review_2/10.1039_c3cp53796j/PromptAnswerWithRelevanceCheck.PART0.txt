If, upon your assessment, you find that the answers do not contain information that is relevant to the questions asked, stop your review process immediately and respond with a single sentence: "※※※※※※※The provided answers are not relevant to the questions.※※※※※※※". Do not provide any additional explanation or background information, only this sentence should be given as a response in case of irrelevant answers.

If, however, the answers are relevant to the questions asked, proceed to compile answers for each question according to the instructions below. Ensure to aggregate all the relevant answers from the multiple answer results provided in the document, and organize them sequentially by their order number, compiling the corresponding quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question.

If the provided answers' quotes are not differentiated by question, ensure to break them down and assign the quotes to each respective question, outputting them separately within each question's section.

To provide a comprehensive review, differentiate the responses into quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question based on the details given in the 'Answer' XML tags. Structure your review using the XML format showcased below if the answers are relevant to the questions asked:

[1] "The presence of some hydrogen is known to be advantageous,5 and has been mainly attributed to a reduction in the rate of coke formation."
[2] "The presence of an adsorbed H atom on the cluster facilitates alkene desorption relative to dehydrogenation of the adsorbed alkene."
[3] "Interestingly,it raises the energy of the third and undesired cleavage step to far greater extent than it does for the first two steps."
[4] "A marginal effect on the first two CH cleavages combined with a significant shift of the third suggests that the addition of small amounts of hydrogen gas could improve the selectivity of the reaction towards the formation of alkenes."

1.The co-feeding of hydrogen in the propane dehydrogenation (PDH) process is advantageous as it reduces the rate of coke formation. The presence of an adsorbed hydrogen atom on the cluster facilitates the desorption of alkenes relative to the dehydrogenation of the adsorbed alkene. Hydrogen raises the energy of the third and undesired cleavage step to a greater extent than the first two steps, which could improve the selectivity of the reaction towards the formation of alkenes. This suggests that the addition of small amounts of hydrogen gas could enhance the selectivity of the reaction towards the formation of alkenes, thereby improving the overall process efficiency and performance.

1.在丙烷脱氢(PDH)过程中共喂氢是有利的，因为它可以降低焦炭的形成速率。吸附在簇上的氢原子的存在促进了烯烃的解吸，相对于吸附的烯烃的脱氢。氢将第三步和不希望的裂解步骤的能量提高到比前两步更大的程度，这可能提高反应选择性，形成烯烃。这表明，添加少量氢气可以增强反应选择性，形成烯烃，从而提高整体过程效率和性能。

1.The presence of hydrogen during the propane dehydrogenation (PDH) process is advantageous as it reduces the rate of coke formation. The adsorption of hydrogen atoms on the catalyst cluster facilitates the desorption of alkenes relative to the dehydrogenation of adsorbed alkenes. Hydrogen cofeeding raises the energy barrier for the third and undesired cleavage step to a greater extent than for the first two steps. This suggests that adding small amounts of hydrogen gas can improve the selectivity of the reaction towards the formation of alkenes, thereby reducing coke formation and improving catalyst stability and process efficiency.

1.在丙烷脱氢(PDH)过程中,氢气的存在是有利的,因为它可以降低焦炭的生成速率。氢原子在催化剂簇上的吸附促进了烯烃的解吸,相对于吸附烯烃的脱氢。氢气共给会将第三步和不希望发生的裂解步骤的能量屏障提高到比前两步更大的程度。这表明,添加少量氢气可以提高反应向烯烃生成的选择性,从而减少焦炭的形成,提高催化剂的稳定性和过程效率。

1.The presence of hydrogen during the propane dehydrogenation (PDH) process is advantageous as it reduces the rate of coke formation. The adsorption of hydrogen atoms on the catalyst cluster facilitates the desorption of alkenes relative to the dehydrogenation of adsorbed alkenes. This effect is more pronounced on the third and undesired cleavage step, which raises its energy barrier more than the first two steps. As a result, the addition of small amounts of hydrogen gas can improve the selectivity of the reaction towards the formation of alkenes.
