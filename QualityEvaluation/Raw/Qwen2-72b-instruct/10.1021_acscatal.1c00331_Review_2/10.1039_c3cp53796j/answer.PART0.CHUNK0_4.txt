[1] "The presence of some hydrogen is known to be advantageous,5 and has been mainly attributed to a reduction in the rate of coke formation."
[2] "The presence of an adsorbed H atom on the cluster facilitates alkene desorption relative to dehydrogenation of the adsorbed alkene."
[3] "Interestingly,it raises the energy of the third and undesired cleavage step to far greater extent than it does for the first two steps."
[4] "A marginal effect on the first two CH cleavages combined with a significant shift of the third suggests that the addition of small amounts of hydrogen gas could improve the selectivity of the reaction towards the formation of alkenes."

1.The co-feeding of hydrogen in the propane dehydrogenation (PDH) process is advantageous as it reduces the rate of coke formation. The presence of an adsorbed hydrogen atom on the cluster facilitates alkene desorption relative to the dehydrogenation of the adsorbed alkene. Hydrogen has a significant effect on the third and undesired cleavage step, raising its energy to a greater extent than the first two steps. This suggests that the addition of small amounts of hydrogen gas could improve the selectivity of the reaction towards the formation of alkenes, thus enhancing the overall process efficiency and performance.

1.在丙烷脱氢(PDH)过程中，氢气的共进料是有利的，因为它可以降低焦炭的形成速率。吸附在聚集体上的氢原子的存在促进了烯烃的解吸，相对于吸附的烯烃的脱氢。氢对第三和不希望的裂解步骤有显著影响，将其能量提高到比前两个步骤更大的程度。这表明，少量氢气的添加可以提高反应向烯烃生成的选择性，从而提高整体过程的效率和性能。
