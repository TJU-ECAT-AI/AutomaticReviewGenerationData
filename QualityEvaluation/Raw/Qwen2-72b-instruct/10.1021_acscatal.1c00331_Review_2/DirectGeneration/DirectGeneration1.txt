Hydrogen cofeeding in the propane dehydrogenation (PDH) process plays a multifaceted role, significantly impacting coke formation, catalyst stability, and reaction dynamics. By introducing hydrogen into the reaction mixture, the process can mitigate coke formation, a critical issue that leads to catalyst deactivation. Hydrogen acts as a reducing agent, promoting the removal of carbon deposits and maintaining the active sites of the catalyst. This, in turn, enhances catalyst stability, prolonging its operational life and reducing the need for regeneration or replacement. Moreover, hydrogen cofeeding can alter the reaction dynamics by shifting the equilibrium towards the desired products, improving the selectivity and yield of propylene. The presence of hydrogen can also influence the reaction pathway, potentially leading to a higher conversion rate of propane. Overall, the strategic use of hydrogen cofeeding in PDH processes offers a means to optimize performance, increase efficiency, and reduce operational costs.
