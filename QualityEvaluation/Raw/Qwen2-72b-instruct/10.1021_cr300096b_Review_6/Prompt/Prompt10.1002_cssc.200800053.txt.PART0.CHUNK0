Enhancing H2 and CO Production from Glycerol Using Bimetallic Surfaces Graphical Abstract Scratching the surface: The reactions of oxygenates such as glycerol are important for the production of H2. Temperature-programmed desorption experiments have revealed an increased production of H2 on the Ni surface monolayer on Pt(111) (Ni-Pt-Pt(111)). Glycerol reforming activity trends are similar to previous results for ethylene glycol and ethanol, demonstrating that smaller oxygenates can be used as good models for reforming of larger, biomass-derived oxygenates.
The development of alternative energy sources to fossil fuels is attracting considerable interest both for increasing energy supply and for decreasing greenhouse gas emissions. It has been argued that biomass is widely available, carbon-neutral, and renewable, and can therefore make important contributions to energy supply without increasing CO2 emissions. The carbohydrates in plant matter can be broken down to smaller oxygenates, such as glycerol, glucose, sorbitol, ethylene glycol, and others. Through aqueous phase reforming,1 the oxygenates can be further reacted to yield H2 for use in fuel cells. Alternatively, the reforming process can be tuned to produce H2/CO mixtures that can be coupled with FischerTropsch synthesis to yield liquid alkanes compatible with the existing petroleum transportation and storage infrastructure.25 Glycerol has attracted recent attention as a feed molecule for these processes1,46 and is particularly interesting because as a by-product of the transesterification of plant oils and animal fats its availability could potentially increase with the expected increase in biodiesel production.
Fundamental surface science studies of glycerol conversion have not been performed previously, in part because of the difficulty of introducing compounds with low vapor pressures into ultrahigh vacuum (UHV) systems. Instead, smaller oxygenates such as ethanol and ethylene glycol have been used as surrogates for glycerol. Herein we report the first surface science studies of glycerol on Pt(111) and Ni/Pt(111) bimetallic surfaces. The objective of these experiments was to determine whether the chemistry of glycerol is sufficiently similar to that of smaller oxygenates to validate the use of smaller molecules as models in catalysis and surface science studies. We have previously investigated the reactivity of ethylene glycol,7 ethanol,7 and methanol8 on Ni/Pt(111) bimetallic surfaces. These studies demonstrated that surfaces with a Ni monolayer on top of Pt(111), designated as Ni-Pt-Pt(111), display increased reforming activity as compared to either an unmodified Pt(111) surface or a Pt(111) surface containing a subsurface Ni monolayer, designated as Pt-Ni-Pt(111). These results on smaller oxygenate molecules demonstrated the possibility of combining UHV surface science studies with density functional theory (DFT) calculations to understand the reaction mechanisms of reforming reactions. However, it is unclear to what extent these results can be extended to larger and more practically important oxygenates such as glycerol. Results from the current study provide the first confirmation that the same trends in reforming activity are observed between glycerol and smaller oxygenate molecules in fundamental UHV studies, validating the use of smaller molecule models.
Deposition of Ni onto Pt(111) at room temperature leads to the Ni atoms remaining on the surface to produce an overlayer structure, Ni-Pt-Pt(111).912 Increasing the deposition temperature to 600K allows the Ni atoms to diffuse to the subsurface, producing a sandwich structure, Pt-Ni-Pt(111). Both experiments and DFT calculations have shown that the different locations of the Ni atoms lead to very different chemical properties of Ni-Pt-Pt(111) and Pt-Ni-Pt(111) surfaces.12 Adsorbates such as H2, ethylene, cyclohexene, and other unsaturated hydrocarbons and oxygenates tend to interact more weakly with Pt-Ni-Pt(111) than with Pt(111), leading to novel low-temperature hydrogenation activity. In contrast, Ni-Pt-Pt(111) surfaces exhibit stronger interactions with adsorbates as compared to Pt(111), increasing the activity for CH and OH scission reactions of interest in processes such as oxygenate reforming.
Glycerol was found to react selectively on these surfaces in temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) experiments to form H2 and CO; no other gas-phase products were detected. The absence of CO2 as a product indicated that the water gas shift reaction did not take place in these TPD experiments under ultrahigh vacuum. Figure1 displays TPD spectra of H2, CO, and unconverted glycerol following exposure of 0.2L glycerol on Pt(111), Pt-Ni-Pt(111), and Ni-Pt-Pt(111) surfaces. Glycerol desorbed in a single peak centered at 274K from all surfaces, as is evident in the spectra for fragments with atomic mass units (amu) of 31 (major) and 28 (minor; Figure1a and c, respectively). On Pt(111), H2 desorption occurred at 330K, with a small peak at 403K (Figure1b, lower trace). The first peak was desorption-limited as the peak temperature corresponds to that following H2 exposure on Pt(111), while the higher temperature peak was reaction-limited. CO desorption occurred from a desorption-limited peak at 399K.

From Pt-Ni-Pt(111), H2 desorbed from overlapping broad and weak peaks centered at 389K and 477K. Both these peaks were reaction-limited as the desorption temperature of H2 on Pt-Ni-Pt(111) is lower than that on Pt(111).10,11 CO desorption occurred from a desorption-limited peak at 367K. Overall, Pt-Ni-Pt(111) displayed decreased H2 and CO peak areas as compared to Pt(111). In contrast, increased H2 and CO peak areas were observed on Ni-Pt-Pt(111) as compared to Pt(111). H2 desorption occurred from two peaks at 377K and 425K, while CO desorbed from a single peak at 429K. The H2 evolution peak at 425K was reaction-limited, while the other H2 and CO peaks were desorption-limited. There were also several weak peaks and shoulder peaks for the desorption of CO at higher temperatures in Figure1, suggesting multiple pathways for the dissociation of glycerol.The TPD results obtained for glycerol were similar to previous experiments using ethylene glycol7 and ethanol.7 Figure2 shows the H2 and CO TPD spectra for these oxygenates on Ni-Pt-Pt(111), the surface with the highest reforming activity. Comparing the TPD results, it is found that the CO desorption temperatures were similar for all three oxygenates and similar to those obtained after dosing CO on the surface. The desorption temperatures for the three oxygenates appeared to gradually increase with increasing molecular weight. The H2 and CO peak areas both increased in the order ethanol<ethylene glycol<glycerol.Figure 2 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint TPD spectra of a)H2 and b)CO following exposures of glycerol, ethylene glycol,7 ethanol,7 and H2/CO on Ni-Pt-Pt(111).The TPD results were quantified by using a similar procedure to that described previously for other oxygenates.7,8 The peak areas were converted into units of monolayers (ML) by calibration of saturation H2 and CO coverages against literature values for Pt(111)13,14 (0.45ML H2 and 0.68ML CO). Blank experiments were carried out to determine the contributions from H2 and CO adsorbed from the UHV background, and the final product yields were obtained by subtracting the contributions attributed to adsorption of these molecules from the chamber background. The reactions of glycerol on these surfaces can be summarized by Equations(1) and (2). The first equation is the desired reforming reaction to produce H2 and CO. The second reaction represents total decomposition that produces H2 as well as C(ad) and O(ad). The reforming yield is defined as the number of oxygenate molecules that are decomposed by the reforming pathway. ((1)) ((2)) To correlate the reforming activity with the electronic properties of bimetallic surfaces, the reforming yield of glycerol determined from TPD was plotted against the surface dband center (Figure3). The adsorption and reactions of many molecules display linear trends with the dband center.15 The surface dband center was calculated previously using DFT.7 Ni-Pt- Pt(111) displayed an increased reforming yield as compared to Pt(111), while Pt-Ni-Pt(111) exhibited a decreased reforming yield. The reactivity trend of glycerol on Ni/Pt(111) bimetallic surfaces was similar to previous results for ethylene glycol and ethanol,7,8 with increasing reforming yield as the surface dband center shifts closer to the Fermi level. However, a comparison of the reforming yields on each of the surfaces revealed that the trend was glycerol>ethylene glycol>ethanol. Reforming was the primary reaction pathway on all surfaces, with selectivities of 5090%.

In conclusion, we have reported the first surface science studies of glycerol. Glycerol reacts on Pt(111) and Ni/Pt(111) surfaces to form H2 and CO as the gas-phase products. An increased reforming yield was observed on Ni-Pt-Pt(111) as compared to those on Pt(111) and Pt-Ni-Pt(111). The reactivity trend of glycerol on these surfaces is similar to previous results for ethylene glycol and ethanol, with an increasing reforming yield as the dband center shifts closer to the Fermi level. Thus, these smaller and more experimentally tractable oxygenates can serve as good models for the reforming of larger oxygenates on Pt-based surfaces. Furthermore, the trend of reforming activity with surface dband center should provide guidance in identifying other bimetallic catalysts for the reforming of oxygenates.
Experimental Section The UHV chamber used for the TPD experiments has been described previously.7,8 Glycerol (SigmaAldrich, >99.5%) was transferred to a glass tube and purified using freezepumpthaw cycles. Glycerol was introduced into the vacuum chamber through a 1/4 inch stainless steel tube, with the crystal, which was maintained at 200K, facing the dosing tube at a distance of several inches. Because of the low vapor pressure of glycerol, the entire dosing line was heated to about 400K. Exposures are reported in Langmuirs (1L=106Torrs) determined from the background pressure in the vacuum chamber during adsorption. The use of a directed doser, as in this case, typically produces a flux to the surface an order of magnitude greater than that calculated from the chamber pressure. The Ni/Pt(111) bimetallic surfaces were prepared by thermal evaporation of Ni onto Pt(111) as described previously.10,11 The Ni(849eV)/Pt(241eV) Auger ratios were used to determine Ni coverages based on previous calibrations.10,11
