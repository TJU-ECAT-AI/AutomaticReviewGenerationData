1.No relevant quotes were found in the provided literature to answer the question about how experimental techniques such as HREELS and AES verify and quantify the oxygen-induced surface segregation of subsurface 3d atoms (particularly Ni and Co) in Pt-3d-Pt(111) bimetallic systems, and how the measured segregation kinetics and activation barriers compare with DFT predictions for these systems.
