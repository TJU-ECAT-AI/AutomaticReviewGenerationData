[1] "AES and HREELS confirmed the trend predicted by DFT modeling and showed that both the PtNiPt(111) and PtCoPt(111) surface structures were unstable in the presence of adsorbed oxygen."
[2] "The activation barrier of the segregation of surbsurface Ni and Co atoms was determined to be 15  2 and 7  1 kcal/mol, respectively."
[3] "The DFT results in Figure 1 predict that all other Pt3d bimetallic alloys should undergo similar structural transformation, from Pt3dPt to 3dPtPt, leading to a gradual reduction of the ORR activity due to the stronger Ometal bonds on the 3dPtPt surfaces."

1.Experimental techniques such as HREELS and AES have confirmed the trend predicted by DFT modeling, showing that the PtNiPt(111) and PtCoPt(111) surface structures are unstable in the presence of adsorbed oxygen. The activation barriers for the segregation of subsurface Ni and Co atoms were determined to be 15 ± 2 and 7 ± 1 kcal/mol, respectively. These measured segregation kinetics and activation barriers are in line with DFT predictions for these systems, indicating a gradual structural transformation from Pt3dPt to 3dPtPt, which leads to a reduction in ORR activity due to the stronger O-metal bonds on the 3dPtPt surfaces.

1.实验技术如HREELS和AES证实了DFT建模预测的趋势，显示在吸附氧气存在下，PtNiPt(111)和PtCoPt(111)表面结构不稳定。对于从PtNiPt(111)和PtCoPt(111)表面结构中分离出的次表面Ni和Co原子，分离的活化能被确定为15±2和7±1 kcal/mol。这些测量的分离动力学和活化能与这些系统中的DFT预测一致，表明从Pt3dPt到3dPtPt的结构逐渐转变，这导致ORR活性降低，因为3dPtPt表面上的O-金属键更强。
