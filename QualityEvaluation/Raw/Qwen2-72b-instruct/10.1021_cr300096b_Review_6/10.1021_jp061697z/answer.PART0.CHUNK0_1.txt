[1] "AES and HREELS confirmed the trend predicted by DFT modeling and showed that both the PtNiPt(111) and PtCoPt(111) surface structures were unstable in the presence of adsorbed oxygen."
[2] "The activation barrier of the segregation of surbsurface Ni and Co atoms was determined to be 15  2 and 7  1 kcal/mol, respectively."
[3] "The DFT results in Figure 1 predict that all other Pt3d bimetallic alloys should undergo similar structural transformation, from Pt3dPt to 3dPtPt, leading to a gradual reduction of the ORR activity due to the stronger Ometal bonds on the 3dPtPt surfaces."

1.Experimental techniques such as HREELS and AES have been used to verify the oxygen-induced surface segregation of subsurface 3d atoms, particularly Ni and Co, in Pt-3d-Pt(111) bimetallic systems. These techniques confirmed the instability of the PtNiPt(111) and PtCoPt(111) surface structures in the presence of adsorbed oxygen, in line with DFT predictions. The measured activation barriers for the segregation of subsurface Ni and Co atoms were determined to be 15 ± 2 and 7 ± 1 kcal/mol, respectively. These values are consistent with the DFT prediction that all Pt3d bimetallic alloys should undergo a structural transformation from Pt3dPt to 3dPtPt in the presence of oxygen, leading to a gradual reduction of the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activity due to the stronger O-metal bonds on the 3dPtPt surfaces.

1.实验技术如HREELS和AES已被用来验证Pt-3d-Pt(111)双金属系统中，特别是Ni和Co的次表面3d原子在氧气诱导下的表面分层。这些技术证实了在吸附氧气存在下，PtNiPt(111)和PtCoPt(111)表面结构的不稳定性，与DFT预测一致。测量得到的次表面Ni和Co原子分层的活化能分别为15±2和7±1 kcal/mol。这些值与DFT预测一致，即所有Pt3d双金属合金在氧气存在下应经历从Pt3dPt到3dPtPt的结构转变，导致氧还原反应(ORR)活性的逐渐降低，因为3dPtPt表面上的O-金属键更强。
