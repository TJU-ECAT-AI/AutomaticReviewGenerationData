How do experimental techniques such as HREELS and AES verify and quantify the oxygen-induced surface segregation of subsurface 3d atoms (particularly Ni and Co) in Pt-3d-Pt(111) bimetallic systems, and how do the measured segregation kinetics and activation barriers compare with DFT predictions for these systems?

[1] "AES and HREELS confirmed the trend predicted by DFT modeling and showed that both the PtNiPt(111) and PtCoPt(111) surface structures were unstable in the presence of adsorbed oxygen."
[2] "The activation barrier of the segregation of surbsurface Ni and Co atoms was determined to be 15  2 and 7  1 kcal/mol, respectively."
[3] "The DFT results in Figure 1 predict that all other Pt3d bimetallic alloys should undergo similar structural transformation, from Pt3dPt to 3dPtPt, leading to a gradual reduction of the ORR activity due to the stronger Ometal bonds on the 3dPtPt surfaces."

1.Experimental techniques such as HREELS (High-Resolution Electron Energy Loss Spectroscopy) and AES (Auger Electron Spectroscopy) have been used to verify the oxygen-induced surface segregation of subsurface 3d atoms, specifically Ni and Co, in Pt-3d-Pt(111) bimetallic systems. These techniques confirmed the instability of the PtNiPt(111) and PtCoPt(111) surface structures in the presence of adsorbed oxygen, aligning with the predictions made by DFT (Density Functional Theory) modeling. The measured activation barriers for the segregation of subsurface Ni and Co atoms were determined to be 15 ± 2 and 7 ± 1 kcal/mol, respectively. These values are consistent with the DFT predictions that suggest a general trend in the stability and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activity of Pt3d bimetallic cathode electrocatalysts, indicating a gradual reduction of ORR activity due to the stronger oxygen-metal bonds on the 3dPtPt surfaces.

1.实验技术如HREELS（高分辨率电子能量损失光谱）和AES（俄歇电子能谱）已被用来验证在Pt-3d-Pt(111)双金属系统中，由于吸附氧引起的次表面3d原子，特别是Ni和Co的表面分层。这些技术证实了在吸附氧存在下，PtNiPt(111)和PtCoPt(111)表面结构的不稳定性，与DFT（密度泛函理论）建模的预测一致。次表面Ni和Co原子分层的测量激活势垒被确定为15±2和7±1 kcal/mol，分别。这些值与DFT预测一致，表明Pt3d双金属阴极电催化剂稳定性和氧还原反应（ORR）活性的一般趋势，表明由于3dPtPt表面上更强的氧-金属键，ORR活性逐渐降低。
