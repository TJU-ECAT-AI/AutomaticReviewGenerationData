[1] "AES and HREELS confirmed the trend predicted by DFT modeling and showed that both the PtNiPt(111) and PtCoPt(111) surface structures were unstable in the presence of adsorbed oxygen."
[2] "The activation barrier of the segregation of surbsurface Ni and Co atoms was determined to be 15  2 and 7  1 kcal/mol, respectively."
[3] "The DFT results in Figure 1 predict that all other Pt3d bimetallic alloys should undergo similar structural transformation, from Pt3dPt to 3dPtPt, leading to a gradual reduction of the ORR activity due to the stronger Ometal bonds on the 3dPtPt surfaces."

1.Experimental techniques such as HREELS (High-Resolution Electron Energy Loss Spectroscopy) and AES (Auger Electron Spectroscopy) have been used to verify the DFT (Density Functional Theory) predictions regarding the stability of Pt-3d-Pt(111) bimetallic systems in the presence of oxygen. HREELS and AES confirmed that the PtNiPt(111) and PtCoPt(111) surface structures are unstable when oxygen is adsorbed. The measured activation barriers for the segregation of subsurface Ni and Co atoms were determined to be 15 ± 2 and 7 ± 1 kcal/mol, respectively. These experimental findings are in line with DFT predictions that suggest a general trend in the stability and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activity of Pt3d bimetallic cathode electrocatalysts.

1.实验技术如HREELS（高分辨率电子能量损失光谱）和AES（俄歇电子能谱）已被用来验证DFT（密度泛函理论）关于Pt-3d-Pt(111)双金属系统在氧气存在下的稳定性的预测。HREELS和AES证实，当氧气被吸附时，PtNiPt(111)和PtCoPt(111)表面结构是不稳定的。测量到的亚表面Ni和Co原子的分隔的活化能被确定为15±2和7±1 kcal/mol，分别。这些实验发现与DFT预测一致，DFT预测表明了Pt3d双金属阴极电催化剂的稳定性和氧还原反应（ORR）活性的一般趋势。
