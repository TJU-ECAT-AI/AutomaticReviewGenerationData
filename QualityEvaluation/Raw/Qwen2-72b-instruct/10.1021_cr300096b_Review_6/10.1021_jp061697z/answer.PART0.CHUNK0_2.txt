[1] "AES and HREELS confirmed the trend predicted by DFT modeling and showed that both the PtNiPt(111) and PtCoPt(111) surface structures were unstable in the presence of adsorbed oxygen."
[2] "The activation barrier of the segregation of surbsurface Ni and Co atoms was determined to be 15  2 and 7  1 kcal/mol, respectively."
[3] "The DFT results in Figure 1 predict that all other Pt3d bimetallic alloys should undergo similar structural transformation, from Pt3dPt to 3dPtPt, leading to a gradual reduction of the ORR activity due to the stronger Ometal bonds on the 3dPtPt surfaces."

1.Experimental techniques such as HREELS (High-Resolution Electron Energy Loss Spectroscopy) and AES (Auger Electron Spectroscopy) have been used to verify the oxygen-induced surface segregation of subsurface 3d atoms, particularly Ni and Co, in Pt-3d-Pt(111) bimetallic systems. These techniques confirmed the trend predicted by DFT (Density Functional Theory) modeling, showing that the PtNiPt(111) and PtCoPt(111) surface structures are unstable in the presence of adsorbed oxygen. The measured activation barriers for the segregation of subsurface Ni and Co atoms were determined to be 15 ± 2 and 7 ± 1 kcal/mol, respectively. These values are consistent with the DFT predictions that the Pt3dPt subsurface structures are thermodynamically unstable with adsorbed oxygen, leading to a structural transformation to the 3dPtPt surfaces, which have stronger O-metal bonds and may result in a gradual reduction of the ORR (Oxygen Reduction Reaction) activity.

1.实验技术如HREELS（高分辨率电子能量损失光谱）和AES（俄歇电子能谱）已被用来验证在Pt-3d-Pt(111)双金属系统中，特别是Ni和Co的次表面3d原子在氧气诱导下的表面分层。这些技术证实了DFT（密度泛函理论）建模预测的趋势，显示在吸附氧气存在下，PtNiPt(111)和PtCoPt(111)表面结构是不稳定的。次表面Ni和Co原子分层的测得活化能被确定为15±2和7±1 kcal/mol，分别。这些值与DFT预测一致，即Pt3dPt次表面结构在吸附氧气存在下热力学上是不稳定的，导致结构转变为3dPtPt表面，这些表面具有更强的O-金属键，可能导致ORR（氧还原反应）活性的逐渐降低。
