1.High-resolution electron energy loss spectroscopy (HREELS) was used to monitor the segregation of Ni and Co in the Pt3dPt(111) subsurface configurations when exposed to oxygen. The onset of the characteristic vibrational modes of NiO and CoO confirmed the segregation of subsurface Ni and Co at different temperatures. AES measurements were performed to quantify the segregation kinetics, using the intensity ratios of Co/Pt or Ni/Pt to monitor the interchange between the subsurface and surface structures after exposure to oxygen. The activation barrier for the oxygen-induced segregation of Co and Ni was estimated using an Arrhenius equation, with values of 7.1 kcal/mol for Co and 15.2 kcal/mol for Ni. These results follow the trend predicted by DFT, where Ni is predicted to have a smaller driving potential for segregation compared to Co, and thus a higher activation barrier.

1.利用高分辨率电子能量损失光谱（HREELS）监测了在氧气暴露下Pt3dPt(111)亚表面结构中Ni和Co的分层。NiO和CoO的特征振动模式的出现证实了在不同温度下，亚表面Ni和Co的分层。AES测量用于量化分层动力学，通过Co/Pt或Ni/Pt的AES强度比来监测氧气暴露后亚表面和表面结构之间的交换。使用阿伦尼乌斯方程分析数据，如图7b所示，估计Co和Ni的氧气诱导分层的活化能分别为7.1和15.2 kcal/mol。这遵循了DFT（图6）预测的趋势，其中Ni被预测具有比Co更小的分层驱动力，因此应该具有更高的活化能。
