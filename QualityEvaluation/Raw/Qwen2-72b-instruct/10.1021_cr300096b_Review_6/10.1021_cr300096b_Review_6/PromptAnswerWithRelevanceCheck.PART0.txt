How do experimental techniques such as HREELS and AES verify and quantify the oxygen-induced surface segregation of subsurface 3d atoms (particularly Ni and Co) in Pt-3d-Pt(111) bimetallic systems, and how do the measured segregation kinetics and activation barriers compare with DFT predictions for these systems?

[1] "To verify the oxygen-induced segregation, high-resolution electron energy loss spectroscopy (HREELS) has been utilized to monitor the segregation of Ni and Co in the Pt3dPt(111) subsurface configurations when exposed to oxygen."
[2] "The onset of the characteristic ν(NiO) and ν(CoO) vibrational modes confirms the segregation of subsurface Ni and Co after exposing the subsurface Pt3dPt(111) configuration to oxygen at different temperatures."
[3] "In addition, AES measurements were performed to quantify the segregation kinetics."
[4] "The AES intensity ratios of Co/Pt or Ni/Pt were used to monitor the interchange between the subsurface and surface structures after exposure to oxygen."
[5] "Using an Arrhenius equation to analyze the data, such as that shown in Figure 7b, the activation barrier for the oxygen-induced segregation of Co and Ni is estimated to be 7  1 and 15  2 kcal/mol, respectively."
[6] "This follows the trend predicted by DFT (Figure 6), where Ni is predicted to have the smaller driving potential for segregation compared to Co and should correspondingly have a higher activation barrier."

The activation barrier for the oxygen-induced segregation of Co and Ni was estimated using an Arrhenius equation, with values of 7.1 kcal/mol for Co and 15.2 kcal/mol for Ni. These results follow the trend predicted by DFT, where Ni is predicted to have a smaller driving potential for segregation compared to Co, and thus a higher activation barrier.
