1.High-resolution electron energy loss spectroscopy (HREELS) was used to monitor the segregation of Ni and Co in the Pt3dPt(111) subsurface configurations when exposed to oxygen. The onset of the characteristic vibrational modes of NiO and CoO confirmed the segregation of subsurface Ni and Co after exposing the subsurface Pt3dPt(111) configuration to oxygen at different temperatures. AES measurements were performed to quantify the segregation kinetics, using the intensity ratios of Co/Pt or Ni/Pt to monitor the interchange between the subsurface and surface structures after exposure to oxygen. The activation barrier for the oxygen-induced segregation of Co and Ni was estimated to be 7  1 and 15  2 kcal/mol, respectively, which follows the trend predicted by DFT, where Ni is predicted to have the smaller driving potential for segregation compared to Co and should correspondingly have a higher activation barrier.

1.利用高分辨率电子能量损失光谱（HREELS）监测了在氧气暴露下Pt3dPt(111)亚表面结构中Ni和Co的分层。在不同温度下，将亚表面Pt3dPt(111)结构暴露于氧气后，NiO和CoO的特征振动模式的出现证实了亚表面Ni和Co的分层。此外，进行了AES测量以量化分层动力学。使用Co/Pt或Ni/Pt的AES强度比来监测氧气暴露后亚表面和表面结构之间的交换。使用Arrhenius方程分析数据，如图7b所示，估计氧气诱导的Co和Ni分层的活化能分别为7  1和15  2 kcal/mol。这遵循了DFT（图6）预测的趋势，其中Ni预测具有比Co更小的分层驱动力，相应地应具有更高的活化能。
