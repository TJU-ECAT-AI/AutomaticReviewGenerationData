I. INTRODUCTION
The reactions of methanol on various catalytic surfaces are important for processes such as methanol synthesis from syngas, production of formaldehyde from methanol, and for operation of direct methanol fuel cells. The focus of the present work is on the production of hydrogen by selective reforming of oxygenates. A general review on this topic can be found in a recent paper.1 In addition to its possible utilization as a reactant, methanol may also serve as a model compound for reforming reactions of larger oxygenates such as glycerol, sorbitol, and glucose to probe the reactivity of various bimetallic surfaces.
In previous work the reactions of ethylene glycol and ethanol were studied on
Ni
∕
Pt
(
111
)
bimetallic surfaces.2 Results showed that the surface with a monolayer of Ni atoms residing on top of Pt(111), designated as Ni–Pt–Pt(111), displayed increased activity for reforming of ethanol and ethylene glycol relative to the clean Pt surface. Yields of
H
2
from reforming reactions of ethanol and ethylene glycol in temperature-programed desorption (TPD) experiments displayed a near linear correlation with the surface
d
-band center as calculated by density functional theory (DFT), with increasing activity as the
d
-band center moved closer to the Fermi level. Based on the correlation of reforming activity with the
d
-band center, it was predicted that other
3

bimetallic surfaces might be good potential catalysts for reforming of oxygenates.2 Recent studies using supported catalysts have indeed shown that supported NiPt, CoPt, and FePt display increased turnover frequencies for aqueous phase reforming of ethylene glycol compared to

at similar conditions.3 
The
Ni
∕
Pt
(
111
)
bimetallic system has been studied extensively and displays novel catalytic properties.4–6 Two very different surfaces can be prepared based on the deposition temperature of Ni. Deposition of a monolayer coverage of Ni at
600
K
is accompanied by Ni atom diffusion into the subsurface region, producing a sandwich structure designated as Pt–Ni–Pt(111). At room temperature the diffusion process is sufficiently slow that Ni atoms remain on the surface, producing an overlayer structure designated as Ni–Pt–Pt(111).5 Longer deposition times generate surfaces composed of a Ni film of increasing thickness on Pt(111), designated thick
Ni
∕
Pt
(

)
⁠, which approximates the structure and reactivity of Ni(111). The chemical properties of Pt–Ni–Pt(111) and Ni–Pt–Pt(111) surfaces are very different. In general, both experiments4–6 and DFT modeling5,7 have shown that Pt–Ni–Pt(111) is characterized by decreased interactions with adsorbates such as atomic hydrogen,
C

H
4
⁠, cyclohexene, and other unsaturated hydrocarbons and oxygenates, leading to increased activity for reactions such as low temperature hydrogenation. Conversely, increased interactions with adsorbates are observed on the Ni–Pt–Pt(111) bimetallic surface;2,5 these might be expected to enhance bond-scission or decomposition processes, including the reforming of oxygenates.
The decomposition of methanol has been studied previously on clean and oxygen-covered Pt(111),8–11 Pt(110),12 Ni(111),13,14 Ni(110) (Ref. 15) as well as on many other transition metal surfaces. Literature studies have shown that the methanol decomposition activity is low on Pt(111) under ultrahigh vacuum (UHV) conditions.9,10 On the other hand, on oxygen-covered Pt(111),8,9 as well as
(

and
(

×

)
Pt(110),12 methanol decomposition does occur. On Ni(111) methanol decomposes to form
H
2
and CO.13 In general, the decomposition of methanol proceeds through initial O–H bond scission to form a methoxy species. The formation and decomposition of methoxy species have been studied on a variety of transition metal surfaces, and a summary of these results can be found in several papers.16,17 A linear free energy relationship has been observed for the decomposition of methoxy species, with separate trends for group VIII and group IB metals.16 Even with this extensive amount of work, to our knowledge studies of methanol on

In this work we investigate the reactivity of methanol on the surface and subsurface

and
Co

bimetallic surfaces. The results for DFT modeling of methanol and methoxy on

and
Co

bimetallic surfaces are presented first. These are followed by the TPD and high-resolution electron energy loss spectroscopy (HREELS) studies of the adsorption and decomposition of methanol on these bimetallic surfaces.
II. MODELING AND EXPERIMENTAL METHODS
A. DFT calculations
Theoretical calculations were performed with the VASP package,18–20 which uses a plane wave basis set with pseudopotentials to represent core electrons. The PW91 functional was used for self-consistent electronic structure calculations. The surfaces were approximated by a
3
×
3
unit
cell with four layers of metal separated by six equivalent layers of vacuum, repeated periodically. The top two layers along with the adsorbates were relaxed to the lowest energy configuration. A plane wave cutoff of
396
eV
was used for all calculations. The
d
-band density of states was determined by projection of the plane waves onto spherical harmonic orbitals. The
d
-band center values were previously calculated21 as the first moment of the projected
d
-band density of states on the surface atoms relative to the Fermi level. The binding energies of methanol and methoxy were determined as the difference between the energy of the slab with the adsorbate minus the energy of the slab alone and the adsorbate alone.
B. Experimental techniques
Two UHV chambers were used for this work. The UHV chamber used for the
Ni
∕
Pt
(
111
)
TPD experiments has been described previously.2 Briefly, it consists of a two-level stainless steel chamber (base pressure
1
×
10
−
10
Torr
⁠), equipped with Auger electron spectroscopy (AES) and TPD. TPD experiments used a quadrupole mass spectrometer (UTI 100C), which could monitor up to 12 masses simultaneously; samples were heated at a linear rate of
3
K
∕
s
⁠. The HREELS and
Co
∕
Pt
(
111
)
work was carried out in another UHV chamber, described previously.22 It is a three-level stainless steel chamber (base pressure
3
×
10
−
10
Torr
⁠) equipped with AES and TPD in the top two levels and an LK3000 HREELS unit in the bottom level. The HREELS spectra reported here were acquired with a primary beam energy of
6
eV
⁠. Angles of incidence and reflection were 60° with respect to the surface normal in the specular direction. Count rates in the elastic peak were typically between

⁠, and the spectral resolution was between 30 and

full width at half maximum.
The Pt(111) single crystal (Princeton Scientific, 99.99%) was
1
mm
thick, with a
10
mm
diameter, and was oriented to within 0.5°. The crystal was spot welded directly to two tantalum posts that served as electric contacts for resisting heating, as well as thermal contacts for cooling with liquid nitrogen. The temperature of the crystal could be varied between 100 and
1100
K
and was measured by spot welding a chromel-alumel thermocouple to the top edge of the Pt(111) single crystal.
Methanol (Sigma-Aldrich,
99
+
%
⁠) was transferred into a glass sample cylinder and purified using repeated freeze-pump-thaw cycles. All other gases were of research purity and were used without further purification. The purity of all reagents was verified in situ by a mass spectrometer prior to use. Doses are reported in langmuirs

and are uncorrected for ion gauge sensitivity. The gas exposures were carried out at a crystal temperature of

stainless steel directional tube with the crystal facing away from the dosing tube.
The Pt(111) surface was cleaned by repeated cycles of

and annealing at
1100
K
⁠. Following the last sputter cycle,

was used to remove carbon left on the surface, followed by annealing at
1100
K
for

min
⁠. This cleaning procedure was repeated until negligible C or O was detected by AES.
Ni
∕
Pt
(

and
Co
∕

bimetallic surfaces were prepared by thermal evaporation of Ni or Co, as described earlier.5,23 The crystal was held at either 600 or
300
K
during deposition, depending on whether a sandwich structure or an overlayer was being prepared. The metal doser consisted of a tungsten filament with a high purity Ni or Co wire (Alfa Aesar,
99.99

⁠) wrapped around it, mounted within a tantalum enclosure. The

)
∕
Pt
(

)
AES ratios were used to determine Ni coverages, where a
Ni
∕
Pt
AES ratio of 1.0 was taken as the monolayer coverage for Pt–Ni–Pt(111) based on previous calibration.5 For

∕

(

)
surfaces, the
Co
(
777
eV
)
∕
Pt
(
241
eV
)
AES ratios were used to determine Co coverages, with a ratio of 2.0 taken as the monolayer coverage for Pt–Co–Pt(111).23 The Ni(or Co)–Pt–Pt(111) surface was formed by depositing the second metal onto Pt(111) at
300
K
for exactly the same deposition time as for Pt–Ni(or Co)–Pt(111). For thick
Ni
∕
Pt
(

)
and thick
Co
∕
Pt
(

)
surfaces, deposition was carried out at
600
K
until more than 6 ML of Ni or Co atoms were deposited.
III. DFT MODELING
The binding energies of methanol and methoxy were calculated on different bimetallic surfaces, as shown in Fig. 1. Methanol was adsorbed on an atop site through the oxygen with the geometry shown on a Pt(111) surface in Fig. 2. The Pt–O bond distance was
2.59
Å
⁠, with the C–O bond being oriented 54° with respect to the surface normal. The binding energy of methanol on Pt(111) was determined to be
−
4.5
kcal
∕
mol
⁠, which is slightly lower than the value of
−
5.5
kcal
∕
mol
reported in previous computational studies.24 Methoxy was also adsorbed on an atop site, with the Pt–O bond distance and Pt–C–O angle at
2.02
Å
and 54.5°, respectively. On Pt(111) the methoxy binding energy was determined to be
−
31.8
kcal
∕
mol
⁠, compared to
−
35.5
in previous studies.24,25 The lower binding energy obtained here could be attributed to the differences in the number of metal layers, the plane wave cutoff, and allowing for relaxation of the slab layers. The difference could also be due to the slightly different structures obtained; in the calculations presented here one H atom from the methyl group was directed toward the surface while in the cited study the methyl group was rotated so two H atoms from the methyl group were directed downward. The binding energies of methanol and methoxy varied with the surface
d
-band center, consistent with the theory of chemisorption by Hammer and Nørskov.26 The binding energies increased as the surface
d
-band center shifted closer to the Fermi level, with Co–Pt–Pt(111) showing the highest binding energy. Linear correlations with the surface
d
-band center have also been reported for the binding energies of methoxy species on group VIII metals.27 The increase in binding energy may increase the degree of decomposition of methanol and methoxy species. Overall, the DFT results in Fig. 1 suggest that Pt-based bimetallic surfaces with
3
d
metal atoms residing on the surface should have higher activity than Pt for the reforming of oxygenates, such as methanol, ethanol, ethylene glycol, etc.

IV. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS
A. TPD of methanol from Pt(111)
The TPD spectra of methanol from Pt(111) following different initial exposures are shown in Fig. 3. Methanol desorbed from Pt(111) in two peaks. The lower temperature peak at
150
K
was attributed to multilayer desorption, as it increased continuously with increasing exposure. The higher temperature peak at
190
K
saturated by
0.08
L
and was attributed to monolayer desorption.

TPD spectra following the adsorption of methanol on Pt(111) as a function of exposure.
In agreement with previous studies,9,10 methanol adsorbed and desorbed reversibly on Pt(111) without undergoing decomposition. The
H
2
TPD spectra showed negligible
H
2
desorption, while the CO desorption peak at
471
K
was mostly due to background adsorption as shown by comparison with the bottom spectrum that was obtained without dosing any methanol.
B. HREELS of methanol on Pt(111)
HREELS measurements were carried out to identify surface intermediates. Methanol was adsorbed at a surface temperature of
120
K
⁠. Following the initial scan, the surface was flashed to the indicated temperature at
3
K
∕
s
followed by cooling before the HREEL spectrum was recorded. Each HREEL spectrum was normalized using the elastic peak, and then scaled by a multiplication factor as shown in the figures.
HREEL spectra following
2
L
exposure of methanol on clean Pt(111), which corresponded to subsaturation in the HREELS chamber with background dosing, are shown in Fig. 4. The spectrum at
120
K
displayed the following vibrational features which were assigned to the indicated vibrational modes of methanol, as summarized in Table I:

After flashing the surface to
200
K
⁠, most of the vibrational features of methanol disappeared, consistent with the TPD results for desorption of monolayer methanol at
190
K
⁠. The

spectrum showed that the intense vibrational features were due to
ν

and
ν

⁠, which was accumulated from the UHV background during data acquisition. Further heating to 300 and
400
K
again showed only modes at 470 and
2080

−

that were due to linearly bound CO on the surface. Overall, the HREELS results support the conclusion that methanol adsorbs reversibly on Pt(111) without undergoing decomposition.
C. TPD of methanol on
Ni
∕
Pt
(
111
)
The reactivity of methanol was studied on different
Ni
∕
Pt
(

bimetallic surfaces. Figure 5 displays TPD spectra following a saturation exposure of
0.08
L
methanol on various
Ni
∕
Pt
(
111
)
bimetallic surfaces. The lower temperature peak of methanol at
150
K
was due to multilayer desorption. From Pt–Ni–Pt(111), monolayer methanol desorbed at
183
K
⁠, with a shoulder at
208
K
⁠. From Ni–Pt–Pt(111), desorption of methanol occurred at
180
K
⁠, while from thick
Ni
∕
Pt
(
111
)
methanol desorbed at
198
K
⁠.

bimetallic surfaces.
The Pt–Ni–Pt(111) surface showed similar reactivity to Pt(111), with methanol desorbing reversibly with very little decomposition, as indicated by the absence of
H
2
desorption. In contrast, the Ni–Pt–Pt(111) surface showed considerable desorption of both the
H
2
and CO products. Hydrogen desorbed at
372
K
⁠, while CO desorption occurred at
463
K
⁠, with a smaller peak at
517
K
⁠. From the thick
Ni
∕
Pt
(
111
)
surface,
H
2
and CO desorbed at 361 and
426
K
⁠, respectively. For all surfaces studied,
H
2
and CO evolution was desorption limited, with comparable peak temperatures to those obtained after exposing
H
2
and CO on the corresponding surfaces (spectra not shown). Overall, the TPD results for methanol on various
Ni
∕
Pt
(
111
)
bimetallic surfaces showed similar trends to those previously reported for ethanol and ethylene glycol on the same surfaces,2 with increased yields of
H
2
and CO from the Ni–Pt–Pt(111) surface as compared to Pt–Ni–Pt(111), Pt(111), and thick
Ni
∕
Pt
(
111
)
⁠. Furthermore, the TPD results on thick
Ni
∕
Pt
(
111
)
were in agreement with previous studies on Ni(111).13 
As shown in Fig. 5, the desorption temperatures of
H
2
and CO products in general follow the trend of
Pt

(
111
)
<
thick
Ni
(

<

–

–

⁠. This is consistent with the correlation that the binding energies for adsorbates decrease as the surface
d
-band center shifts away from the Fermi level, as shown in Fig. 1 for the binding energies of methanol and methoxy as a function of surface
d
-band center. However, such trend is not observed in the desorption temperature of methanol from these surfaces. As will be shown in the HREELS results later, the decomposition of methanol to produce methoxy occurs by
120
K
⁠, although the degree of decomposition varies between different surfaces. Interaction with coadsorbed methoxy will change the binding energy of methanol, therefore making the desorption temperature of methanol less meaningful in terms of binding energy calculated on the corresponding clean surfaces.

γ

peak was also reduced in intensity relative to that observed on Pt(111). These changes indicated that at least some of the methanol adsorbed dissociatively as a methoxy intermediate. After heating to

(

metal-carbon modes from adsorbed CO. In addition, a weak vibrational mode at approximately

appeared, indicating the adsorption of a small amount of water from the background. The relative intensities between the different methanol modes did not change as compared to the spectrum at
120
K
⁠. Overall, the HREEL spectrum indicated that a fraction of molecularly adsorbed methanol was still present on the surface at
200
K
⁠, consistent with TPD results which indicated that methanol desorbed from Pt–Ni–Pt(111) at 183 and
208
K

associated with bridge CO appeared. Further heating to

produced no significant change in the vibrational spectrum, at which point only CO was detected on the surface.

The vibrational spectra for methanol and its reaction products on Ni–Pt–Pt(111) exhibited much richer variations with temperature. Figure 6(b) displays the HREEL spectra following a
2
L
exposure of methanol on Ni–Pt–Pt(111). The vibrational spectrum at
120
K
was similar to that on Pt–Ni–Pt(111), with vibrational features at 700, 1020, 1150, 1450, 2820, and

was again present only as a small shoulder and the

completely disappeared, (2) the vibrational feature at

increased significantly in intensity, (3) the vibrational mode at

appeared, most likely due to the reaction of water from the UHV background during the scan. Separate experiments not shown here found that the Ni–Pt–Pt(111) surface was very active toward water dissociation. Overall, the vibrational spectrum at
200
K
indicated the presence of a methoxy species. Along with these changes, the relative intensity of the

to the
ν
as
(

increased, suggesting that the C–O bond in the methoxy species was oriented more nearly perpendicular to the surface as compared to the C–O bond in methanol. The increase in the relative intensity for normal modes is explained by the surface dipole selection rule, which results in preferential excitation of vibrational modes that have dynamic dipole moment perpendicular to the surface. Similar changes in the relative HREELS intensity ratios for methoxy species have been observed previously on Ni(111),14 and experiments have shown that the C–O bond in methoxy on Ni(111) is nearly perpendicular to the surface.28 
Upon heating the Ni–Pt–Pt(111) surface to

shifted further down to

were observed, (3) a new vibrational mode appeared at

due to the adsorption of water from the background, (4) a new vibrational mode appeared at

(

and a new mode corresponding to bridging hydroxyls
(
3460

appeared. Overall, the spectrum at
300

indicated that the adsorbed methoxy species decomposed to produce CO and formaldehyde species. The presence of formaldehyde was supported by the following characteristic modes:

decreased in intensity and shifted down to

disappeared, while only those due to CO and surface hydroxyls remained. The HREELS results for methanol on thick
Ni

were consistent with literature studies of methanol on Ni(111),14 which showed methoxy formation at

E. TPD of methanol from
Co
∕
Pt
(
111

From the results of this work with methanol, as well as earlier work using ethanol and ethylene glycol,2 we have obtained a general trend in the reactivity of oxygenates on
Ni
∕
Pt
(
111
)
bimetallic surfaces. Increased reforming activity was observed on the Ni–Pt–Pt(111) surface, as compared to Pt–Ni–Pt(111), Pt(111), and thick
Ni
∕
Pt
(
111
)
surfaces, for the three oxygenates studied. In order to determine whether a similar trend exists on other
3
d
∕
Pt
(
111
)
bimetallic surfaces, we performed studies of methanol reforming on Pt–Co–Pt(111) and Co–Pt–Pt(111). Our group has previously reported similarities of Pt–Co–Pt(111) to Pt–Ni–Pt(111) for the adsorption of hydrogen and the hydrogenation of cyclohexene.23,33
Figure 8 displays TPD spectra following a

K
from all
Co

bimetallic surfaces. Monolayer desorption from the Pt–Co–Pt(111) surface occurred at
186
K
⁠, the same peak temperature as Pt(111), while from Co–Pt–Pt(111) desorption occurred at
161
K
⁠.

The desorption of
H
2
from Pt–Co–Pt(111) occurred at
366
K
⁠, with a smaller peak at
281
K
⁠. The peak at
281
K
was most likely desorption limited, based on TPD results following
H
2
exposure (not shown), as well as literature data.23 On the other hand, the peak at
366
K
was higher than the desorption temperature of
H
2
on Pt–Co–Pt(111) and was therefore reaction limited. CO desorbed from Pt–Co–Pt(111) at
375
K
⁠. From the Co–Pt–Pt(111) surface, increased
H
2
and CO desorption was observed at 356 and
407
K
⁠, respectively, both consistent with desorption-limited processes. Comparing the TPD results to those for methanol on the corresponding
Ni
∕
Pt
(
111
)
surfaces, several similarities and differences were observed. For both systems, increased
H
2
and CO desorption was observed on the

Pt
–
Pt
(

surface as compared to the
Pt
-

Pt

surface. The Ni–Pt–Pt(111) surface was very active for methanol reforming as compared to Pt–Ni–Pt(111), which showed very little activity, similar to Pt(111). In contrast, the Pt–Co–Pt(111) surface did show methanol reforming activity. The Co–Pt–Pt(111) surface still showed greater
H
2
and CO production as compared to Pt–Co–Pt(111), but the differences were not as significant as on the corresponding
Ni
∕
Pt
(

surfaces.

γ
(
O
H
)
mode, although not as intense as on Pt(111), indicated that at least a fraction of methanol did not dissociate upon adsorption at
120
K
⁠. Overall, the results in Fig. 9(a) showed that methanol adsorbed both molecularly and dissociatively on Pt–Co–Pt(111) at
120
K
⁠, similar to Pt–Ni–Pt(111).

When the surface was heated to

several changes were observed. The peak at

disappeared, while the peak at
2020
cm
−

shifted to
2060
cm
−

and increased in intensity. In addition, new features were observed at 380 and
460
cm
−

⁠, which were attributed to metal-carbon vibrations from background CO. The remaining vibrational features were characteristic of a methoxy species, with the absence of
ν

and

)
modes and an increase in the relative intensity of the
ν
(

ν

)
modes. Overall, only methoxy species remained on the surface at
200
K
⁠, confirming earlier TPD results that showed molecular methanol desorbed at
186
K
⁠. This showed that a fraction of molecular methanol decomposed, as opposed to results on Pt(111) and Pt–Ni–Pt(111) where methanol desorbed reversibly. Further heating to
300
K
produced no changes in the vibrational spectrum, as the methoxy species remained on the surface. This was in contrast to results obtained on Pt–Ni–Pt(111), which showed that by
300
K
only CO vibrational features were present in the spectrum. The HREEL spectrum after heating the surface to
400
K
showed that the vibrational features due to the methoxy intermediate disappeared and only the
ν
(
C
O
)
(
2060
cm
−
1
)
and
ν
(
M
–

)
(380 and

⁠) modes remained in the spectrum. These results were consistent with methanol TPD on Pt–Co–Pt(111) that showed a reaction-limited
H
2
peak at
366
K
⁠, suggesting that the methoxy species was stable on this surface up to
366
K
⁠, at which point it decomposed to form
H

that desorbed immediately and CO that remained on the surface.
Figure 9(b) displays HREEL spectra of methanol on the Co–Pt–Pt(111) surface. After adsorption at
120
K
vibrational modes characteristic of a molecular methanol were observed. A feature at
3200

3300
cm
−

indicative of
ν

was not observed. The
γ
(
O
H
)
feature at
720
cm
−
1
was present; however, the intensity of this feature was low compared to that on other surfaces, suggesting that a fraction of the methanol adsorbed dissociatively at
120
K
on Co–Pt–Pt(111). A weak peak at
2040
cm
−

due to background CO adsorption was also observed. Heating the surface to
200
K
led to several changes: (1) the
720
cm

390
cm
−

appeared, (3) the peak due to CO at
2040

shifted to
1930
cm

and increased greatly in intensity, and (4) a weak peak due to surface OH species appeared at
3600
cm
−
1
⁠. Further heating to
300
K
did not change the HREEL spectrum significantly, indicating that the methoxy species was stable on Co–Pt–Pt(111) to
300
K
⁠. With further heating to
400
K
vibrational features due to methoxy species disappeared and only modes due to metal-carbon (390 and
470
cm
−
1
⁠), CO
(
1960
cm
−
1
)
⁠, and OH species
(
3600
cm
−

remained. Overall, HREELS results for methanol on Pt–Co–Pt(111) and Co–Pt–Pt(111) were very similar, which was in contrast to the differences observed between Pt–Ni–Pt(111) and Ni–Pt–Pt(111) surfaces.
V. DISCUSSION
A. Quantification of reaction yields from TPD
TPD calibration experiments were carried out to separately determine the peak area at saturation for
H
2
and CO on Pt(111). This allows the conversion of arbitrary TPD peak area to units of monolayers using literature values for saturation coverage of
H
2
and CO. The saturation coverage of
H
2
on Pt(111) is reported in the literature to be
∼
0.45
ML (or 0.9 ML
H
(
a
)
⁠) (Ref. 34) based on
D
2
adsorption using nuclear microanalysis. The saturation coverage of CO on Pt(111) is reported to be 0.68 ML.35 In the current work, after adsorption and reaction of methanol, the
H
2
and CO product yields were calculated from TPD results and converted to monolayers using the results of the calibration experiments. Blank TPD experiments were also carried out to determine background contribution for each mass, and the final product yields were obtained by subtracting the contribution attributed to the background.
The reaction pathways of methanol can be summarized by the following equations. Reaction (1) is the desired decarbonylation or reforming reaction producing CO and
H
2
⁠. Reaction (2) represents the undesired total decomposition which leads to
H
2
as well as
C
(
ad
)
and
O
(

)
⁠. The reforming activity

and the total decomposition activity

Ni
∕
Pt
(

bimetallic system, the highest reforming yield was observed on the Ni–Pt–Pt(111) surface, similar to previous results for ethanol and ethylene glycol.2 On the other hand, the thick
Ni
∕
Pt
(
111
)
surface displayed differences between methanol and the other oxygenates. The methanol reforming yield on thick
Ni
∕
Pt
(
111

was slightly greater than on Pt–Ni–Pt(111), while for the other two oxygenates the thick
Ni
∕
Pt
(
111

surface was significantly more active than Pt–Ni–Pt(111). The reforming selectivity was very high on Pt–Ni–Pt(111) and Ni–Pt–Pt(111) surfaces, but decreased on thick
Ni
∕
Pt
(
111
)
to where reforming and total decomposition reaction pathways were about equal.

(

surfaces showed that the Pt–Co–Pt(111) and Co–Pt–Pt(111) surfaces displayed similar reforming yields, both higher than that on clean Pt(111). The Co–Pt–Pt(111) surface displayed increased total activity; however, the increase was largely in the total decomposition reaction pathway. The reforming selectivity of methanol was low on both surfaces as total decomposition was the major reaction pathway.
B. Surface intermediates from HREELS
HREELS results indicated that methanol adsorbed molecularly at
120
K
on Pt(111). On the
Ni
∕
Pt
(
111
)
and
Co
∕
Pt
(
111
)
bimetallic surfaces, adsorption was most likely a mixture of molecular and dissociative adsorption, as the
ν
(
O
H
)
mode was not resolved clearly but was present as a small tail on the high frequency side of the
ν
as
(
C
H
3
)
peak. On all bimetallic surfaces evidence of a methoxy species was observed at
200
K
⁠. The presence of methoxy was characterized by the absence of the
ν
(
O
H
)
and
γ
(
O
H
)
modes as well as changes in the relative intensities of the
ν
(
C
O
)
to
ν
as
(
C
H
3
)
modes, characteristic of reorientation of the
C
H
3
O
moiety upon methanol dissociation.
On the Ni–Pt–Pt(111) surface an intermediate was observed at

C. Comparison of Pt–Co–Pt(111) and Co–Pt–Pt(111) surfaces
The TPD and HREELS results for methanol show that the reforming yield is similar on the Pt–Co–Pt(111) and Co–Pt–Pt(111) surfaces, while the decomposition yields are significantly different from the two surfaces (Table III). Based on the corresponding Pt–Ni–Pt(111) and Ni–Pt–Pt(111) surfaces, the Pt–Co–Pt(111) surface should be less active than either Pt(111) or Pt–Ni–Pt(111), which was not observed experimentally. One possible explanation is that both surfaces have similar type of site/structure that is responsible for the reforming pathway of methanol, most likely due to the partial segregation of the subsurface Co atoms. DFT calculations of methanol and methoxy on
Pt
-

d
-

(

)
surfaces with fractional surface Co coverages will be performed to further understand the binding and reaction pathways of methanol on the Co–Pt bimetallic surfaces.
As described in our recent paper,21 the thermodynamic stability of the alloy structure is determined by two terms: the segregation energy and the energy difference between the surface and subsurface structures in the presence of adsorbates. As calculated in Ref. 21, the energy difference with adsorbed oxygen, i.e.,
O
∕
3
d
-
Pt
(
111
)
and
O
∕
Pt
-
3
d
-
Pt
(
111
)
⁠, is larger for the Co–Pt(111)system than the Ni–Pt(111) system. Correspondingly, the thermodynamic driving force for the segregation of subsurface Co is larger than subsurface Ni in the presence of adsorbed oxygen atoms. We have also verified this trend experimentally;21 the activation barriers for the segregation of subsurface Co and Ni in the presence of oxygen were determined to be 7 and
15
kcal
∕
mol
⁠, respectively. These trends are consistent with the segregation of subsurface Co in the present study with adsorbed methanol and methoxy. The lower activation barrier for the segregation of Co compared to Ni might indicate that some of the Co atoms segregated to the surface, leading to increased activity of the Pt–Co–Pt(111) surface.
Further evidence for Co segregation could be found in the vibrational frequencies of CO in the HREELS results. The
ν
(
C
O
)
mode was found to be sensitive to the type of surface metal atoms, as summarized in Fig. 10, which shows the HREEL spectra after the decomposition of methanol on different surfaces at
400
K
⁠. The only adsorbed species on these surfaces were CO from the decomposition of methanol and from the accumulation in the UHV background. On Pt atoms the
ν
(
C
O
)
frequency was approximately
2080
cm
−
1
⁠, while on Ni atoms the frequency shifted to
1820
cm
−
1
as shown in the HREEL spectrum on the thick Ni surface. Comparing the HREEL spectrum of Pt–Ni–Pt(111) at
400
K
⁠, the only
ν
(
C
O
)
mode observed was at
2060
cm
−
1
⁠, suggesting that the surface atoms were Pt and that surface Ni atoms were not present. On the other hand, the HREEL spectrum on thick Co surface showed that the
ν
(
C
O
)
mode on Co atoms occurred at approximately
1970
cm
−
1
⁠. Comparing the
400
K
HREEL spectrum on Pt–Co–Pt(111), an intense peak was observed at
2060
cm
−
1
⁠, with a small shoulder at
1970
cm
−
1
⁠. The detection of the
1970
cm
−
1
mode supported the conclusion that some of the Co atoms segregated to the surface of Pt–Co–Pt(111). The segregation of a fraction of Co atoms could explain why the Pt–Co–Pt(111) and Co–Pt–Pt(111) surfaces showed similar spectra in the HREELS measurements and similar reforming activity in the TPD results. Further work is needed to study the stability of

The reactions of methanol have been studied on

and
Co

bimetallic surfaces, with the

and clean Pt(111) surfaces, with increasing binding energy as the surface

-band center shifts closer to the Fermi level.
The trends predicted by DFT for Pt–Ni–Pt(111) and Ni–Pt–Pt(111) bimetallic surfaces have been verified experimentally by TPD and HREELS. Increased production of
H
2
and CO from methanol is observed on Ni–Pt–Pt(111) as compared to the Pt–Ni–Pt(111) bimetallic surface, similar to previous results of ethanol and ethylene glycol.
The Pt–Co–Pt(111) and Co–Pt–Pt(111) bimetallic surfaces show differences from those predicted by DFT. Both bimetallic surfaces exhibit similar reforming activity to produce
H
2
and CO, although Co–Pt–Pt(111) displays increased total decomposition activity to produce atomic C, O, and additional
H
2
⁠. The activity of the Pt–Co–Pt(111) surface, higher than expected from the DFT prediction, is attributed to partial segregation of subsurface Co atoms to the surface.
HREELS measurements have identified the formation of methoxy surface intermediates on
Ni
∕
Pt
(
111
)
and
Co
∕
Pt
(
111
)
bimetallic surfaces at
200
K
⁠. On Ni–Pt–Pt(111) the methoxy species decomposes to form surface formaldehyde by
300
K
⁠, which further reacts to form CO and
H
2
at higher temperatures. On Pt–Co–Pt(111), the methoxy species is stable up to
∼
350
K
and decomposes to CO and
H
2
with no other observed intermediates.
In general, the results of this paper and earlier work2 show that the trends in the reactivity of various oxygenates, such as methanol, ethanol, and ethylene glycol, are similar on
Ni
∕
Pt
(
111
)
bimetallic surfaces. This suggests that these smaller probe molecules might be useful to help understand the chemistry of larger oxygenates, such as glycerol and glucose, which are important biomass-derived reactants for either
H
2
or biofuel production.
