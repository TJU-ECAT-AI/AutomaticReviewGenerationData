The interchange between the Pt–Ni–Pt and Ni–Pt–Pt bimetallic conﬁgurations in O2 and H2 is conﬁrmed
experimentally at atmospheric pressure using in situ X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS). The subsurface
Pt–3d–Pt structure, a desirable conﬁguration as cathode electrocatalysts for PEM fuel cells, is found to
be preferred in the reducing environment of H2 whereas the surface 3d–Pt–Pt conﬁguration is preferred
in O2. This process has been found to be reversible, providing useful insights into the maintenance and
regeneration of the desirable subsurface structure.

1. Introduction
The subsurface Pt–3d–Pt structures, where 3d represents Ni, Co,
Fe, Mn, Cr, V, and Ti, have been identiﬁed as promising catalysts
for a wide range of applications, from the oxygen reduction reac-
tion (ORR) at the cathode of PEM fuel cells [1] to hydrogenation
reactions in heterogeneous catalysis [2,3]. These bimetallic surfaces
have been shown to span a wide range of chemical and physi-
cal properties beyond a simple combination of the parent metal
properties [4–6]. The unique properties of the subsurface Pt–3d–Pt
bimetallic structures are due to the strain effect from lattice mis-
match between alloy metals and the electronic effect related to
the difference in electronic conﬁguration [7]. However, one of the
challenges in the application of these bimetallic structures is the
tendency of the subsurface 3d atoms to segregate on top of the
surface Pt layer, therefore losing the desirable electrocatalytic and
catalytic properties. The ability to maintain and/or regenerate the
desirable Pt–3d–Pt subsurface structure is of critical importance for
their applications in fuel cells and hydrogenation reactions.
Several recent fundamental surface science and theoretical
studies have been performed to determine the thermodynamic
stability and kinetic transformation of the Pt–3d–Pt subsurface
structures [4]. The surface science experiments have been typically
performed under ultra-high vacuum (UHV) conditions detailing

the stability under a number of reaction environments, such as
in low pressure of hydrogen and oxygen. However, the extension
of these UHV studies to atmospheric conditions, which are more
relevant to the maintenance and regeneration of the subsurface
structures, has yet to be established. This is mainly due to the dif-
ﬁculty in the in situ measurements of spectroscopic changes from
the interchange between the surface and subsurface structures at
higher pressures. The current communication will detail a novel
approach to quantify metal segregation at atmospheric pressure
by monitoring monolayer bimetallic surfaces prepared in UHV and
subsequently exposed to hydrogen and oxygen at atmospheric con-
ditions. The changes in the surface composition, from the diffusion
and segregation of the 3d metals, were monitored using the white
line of the 3d metals with X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS).
Due to the high intensity and energy of the synchrotron radiation,
XAS offers the unique advantage to monitor changes in monolayer
coverages under in situ reaction conditions.
In addition to determining the activation barriers for the diffu-
sion and segregation of 3d metals in Pt–3d–Pt, the current study is
also focused on bridging the pressure gap from UHV to atmospheric
pressure to more closely resemble the conditions in heterogeneous
catalysis and electrocatalysis. Previous studies by this group have
aimed at bridging the materials gap of Pt–3d–Pt bimetallic struc-
tures prepared on single crystal Pt(1 1 1) [8] and on polycrystalline
Pt foils [9] to incorporate both the additional (1 0 0) crystal facet
as well as lower coordinated sites found on supported nanoparti-
cles. Qualitatively, both single crystal and polycrystalline bimetallic
systems displayed similar behaviour in the environments probed.

The subsurface Pt–3d–Pt structure was thermodynamically pre-
ferred in vacuum and the subsurface 3d metals were drawn to the
surface using oxygen to form the surface 3d–Pt–Pt conﬁguration
[8,9]. Using these fundamental understandings from UHV measure-
ments, the current study is focused on bridging the pressure gap
and demonstrating that similar segregation kinetics is present at
more applicable pressures.
2. Methods
2.1. Techniques
The samples were prepared in a UHV system and character-
ized using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) in a chamber
with a base pressure of 4 × 10−9 Torr, as described previously [9].
Ni and Co were deposited using line-of-sight physical vapor depo-
sition (PVD). X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) was performed
on beamline X-18b at the National Synchrotron Light Source (NSLS)
at Brookhaven National Laboratory. The samples were exposed to
5% H2 in He or 10% O2 in He using an in situ reaction cell. The
temperature was monitored using a K-type thermocouple.
2.2. Sample preparation
The Pt foil sample was cut from a larger polycrystalline Pt foil
(99.95%) with a thickness of 0.004 mm. The foil was afﬁxed onto
two tantalum posts by crimping a Ta frame around the edge of the
foil to maintain physical contact. The posts were used as electrical
and thermal contacts for resistive heating, which allowed the tem-
perature of the Pt foil to be varied between 300 K and 1200 K. The
temperature was monitored by a K-type thermocouple welded to
the back of the foil. The surface was cleaned by successive cycles of
sputtering Ar+ followed by annealing in vacuum to 1050 K until the
surface contaminants, such as C and O, were below the detection
limit of XPS.
The Ni/Pt or Co/Pt bimetallic surfaces were prepared by evap-
orating Ni or Co by line-of-sight physical vapor deposition (PVD)
onto the Pt foil using a high-purity Ni (99.994%) or Co (99.999%)
wire wrapped around a tungsten ﬁlament. The Pt foil sample was
at a temperature of 300 K during deposition. The coverage of the
Ni or Co overlayer was estimated using the Ni(2p3/2)/Pt(4f) or
Co(2p3/2)/Pt(4f) XPS ratio as described in our previous studies on
the Co/Pt(1 1 1) surface [10] or estimated by screening calculations
using inelastic mean free paths (IMFP) from [11].
3. DFT predicted segregation energy of Pt–3d–Pt(1 1 1) in
vacuum, H2, and O2
3.1. Method
The ab initio calculations were performed using the Vienna Ab
initio Simulation Package (VASP) version 4.6 [12–14]. The mono-
layer bimetallic systems were modeled using the closed-packed
fcc(1 1 1) surface of the host metal, Pt. The PW91 functional was
used within the generalized gradient approximation with an energy
cutoff on the basis set of 396 eV. The bimetallic systems were mod-
eled using a periodic 2 × 2 unit cell with four metal layers. The slabs
were separated by 6 equivalent layers of vacuum in the epitaxial
direction. The surface 3d–Pt–Pt(1 1 1) conﬁguration was modeled
with the ﬁrst layer composed of the admetal and the remaining
three layers composed of Pt. The subsurface Pt–3d–Pt(1 1 1) conﬁg-
uration had the Pt metal in the ﬁrst, third, and fourth layers while
the second layer was completely substituted with the admetal. The
top two layers were allowed to relax to the lowest energy conﬁg-
uration while the third and fourth layers were frozen at the bulk
host metal distance of 2.83 Å for Pt, as previously determined for
the PW91 exchange/correlation functional [15]. A Monkhorst–Pack
k-point mesh of 3 × 3 × 1 was used, having 5 irreducible k-points
in the ﬁrst Brillouin zone. This has been shown to be sufﬁcient for
the current study as previous studies have shown negligible change
in the results for higher k-point meshes [16]. For the convergence
criteria of the energy minimization, the calculations were iterated
until the total energy change between ionic steps was less than
0.0001 eV. The d-band center of mass was calculated by projecting
the plane waves onto spherical harmonic orbitals. The d-band cen-
ter of mass for this paper is deﬁned as the ﬁrst moment of only the
d-orbital bands that have some degree of electron occupation for
the four surface atoms using a Gaussian smearing method between
k-points and a short cut-off radius of 1.5 Å. The segregation energy
in hydrogen and oxygen was simulated using a coverage of 0.5 ML.
This coverage was modeled by placing two separate H or O atoms
in 3-fold hollow sites per unit cell.
3.2. DFT predictions
The thermodynamically preferred conﬁguration is directly
related to the chemical environment present on the surface. Fig. 1
shows the predicted potential for segregation for a 3d metal atom
to go from the subsurface to the surface and the value is scaled
per Pt–3d metal pair. These values were calculated for the environ-
ments of vacuum, and with 0.5 monolayer (ML) atomic hydrogen
and 0.5 ML atomic oxygen, using procedures described previously
[16]. The thermodynamic potential for segregation is deﬁned as
follows:
Eseg =
EA/3d−Pt−Pt −EA/Pt−3d−Pt
M
(1)
where Eseg is the thermodynamic potential for segregation per
Pt–3d pair, EA/3d−Pt−Pt is the total energy for the surface conﬁg-
uration with adsorbate A, EA/Pt−3d−Pt is the total energy for the
subsurface conﬁguration with adsorbate A, and M is the total num-
ber of Pt–3d pairs per unit cell.
As deﬁned in a previous publication [17], a positive Eseg value
indicates that the subsurface Pt–3d–Pt is more stable. The DFT
results in Fig. 1 predict that for the reducing environment of vac-
uum and 0.5 ML atomic hydrogen, the subsurface conﬁguration is

thermodynamically preferred whereas in 0.5 ML atomic oxygen,
the surface conﬁguration is preferred. There is a nearly linear trend
with the difference in d-band, εd, with Pt–Ni–Pt(1 1 1) having
the smallest potential and Pt–Ti–Pt(1 1 1) the largest for diffu-
sion/segregation of the 3d atoms.
4. Experimental results
As demonstrated previously, Ni or Co can be deposited on the
Pt substrate layer-by-layer in UHV at room temperature, leading
to the formation of the surface 3d–Pt–Pt conﬁguration [3]. Alter-
natively, if the surface is annealed in vacuum to 600–700 K, the
3d metal can be driven inwards to create the subsurface Pt–3d–Pt
conﬁguration [3]. The same procedure was used for preparing the
surface and subsurface structures in the current study, except on
ultra-thin polycrystalline Pt foil (∼4 m thick) to reduce the self-
absorption in XAS measurements. Brieﬂy, monolayer Ni or Co was
deposited using line-of-sight physical vapor deposition in UHV.
Fig. 2 shows the characteristic Ni K edge spectra for the as-prepared
PtNiPt and NiPtPt foil samples prepared in UHV. The surface NiPtPt
sample has a higher white line peak intensity at 8351 eV compared
to the subsurface PtNiPt sample, which is attributed to the removal
of valence electrons from Ni due to oxidation of the surface Ni atoms
[18]. There is an additional Ni K-edge feature for the PtNiPt sam-
ple at 8374 eV, which is not present for the NiPtPt sample. This
peak is in the spectroscopic region assigned to multiple scattering
events from more delocalized states. Due to these complex scatter-
ing events, features in this region are more sensitive to the changes
in the neighbouring shells of atoms surrounding the element of
interest [18–20]. The 8374 eV feature may capture the conﬁgura-
tion interchange since Ni atoms in the subsurface structure have a
complete ﬁrst shell and more complete higher order shells whereas
those in the surface structure do not.
The comparison in Fig. 2 qualitatively conﬁrms that XAS can cap-
ture the difference between surface NiPtPt and subsurface PtNiPt
in the as-prepared samples. These characteristic spectroscopic fea-
tures are then used to determine the diffusion and segregation
kinetics of Ni atoms. The bottom set of spectra in Fig. 3a shows
the comparison of an initially UHV prepared NiPtPt sample before
and after multiple cycles of oxidation in O2 and reduction in H2 at
693 K. The changes between the two spectra in Fig. 3a mimic the dif-
ferences seen between the as-prepared PtNiPt and NiPtPt scans in
Fig. 2, indicating that the interchange between the surface and sub-
surface structures can occur from oxidation and reduction cycles.
The larger differences seen in Fig. 3a is attributed to the fact that

sentative structures for the as-prepared samples shown for the (1 1 1) facet.

the UHV as-prepared PtNiPt sample most likely had some extent
of oxygen-induced segregation since the sample was exposed to
ambient atmosphere at room temperature for approximately one
week during transport to the beamline. Furthermore, Fig. 3a shows
that the NiPtPt and subsurface PtNiPt samples do not completely
resemble the Ni reference foil (top spectrum), conﬁrming that the
Ni monolayer is not agglomerating into bulk-like particles.
As shown in Fig. 3b, CoPtPt samples exposed to H2 and O2
showed similar spectroscopic changes as noted for the NiPtPt sys-
tem. The spectroscopic changes show similar inward diffusion of Co
in H2 and outward segregation in O2. In addition, a higher energy
Co K-edge feature is present at 7752 eV in PtCoPt and absent in
CoPtPt, conﬁrming that this higher energy feature can be poten-
tially used as an indicator of the presence of subsurface 3d atoms
in the Pt–3d–Pt structures.
In order to quantify the apparent activation barrier for the segre-
gation of Ni at atmospheric pressure, the intensity of the white line
peak at 8351 eV was monitored as a function of exposure time and
temperature. The exposure series for O2 is shown in Fig. 4 where the
absorbance intensity is shown as a function of oxygen exposure in
the temperature range of 633–693 K. Beginning with a subsurface

conﬁguration, as the duration to O2 exposure increases, the white
line peak absorbance increases. In addition, the disappearance of
the peak at 8374 eV indicates that subsurface Ni atoms are seg-
regating to the surface. Using an Arrhenius equation, an apparent
activation barrier of 32 kcal/mol is found.
In order to correlate the rate of Ni segregation to a typical PEMFC
operating temperature of 353 K, Table 1 summarizes the time it
would take for the Ni K white line intensity to reach a value of
 = 0.112, which corresponds to the segregation of approximately
half of the subsurface Ni layer to the surface. In the second column
in Table 1, the time values at 633, 653, 673 and 693 K are obtained
from experiments. The time at 353 K is estimated by assuming a
similar activation barrier and preexponential factor in the Arrhe-
nius equation. As discussed in a previous study [17], the segregation
of subsurface Ni atoms from polycrystalline Pt show two distinct
activation barriers. The segregation from the Pt(1 0 0) region has
an activation barrier similar to the one determined in the current
study, while the activation barrier from the Pt(1 1 1) region has a
value of 17 kcal/mol. This value is used to estimate the time for
the segregation of approximately half of the subsurface Ni layer to
the surface, as listed in the third column in Table 1. The values in
Table 1 represent the approximate time scale for the segregation
when thermal energy is provided to overcome the activation barri-
ers. Although the values listed in Table 1 do not include the effects
of applied voltage and the presence of liquid layers as in typical fuel
cell operation conditions, the different trend between the segrega-
tion time from the Pt(1 0 0) and Pt(1 1 1) regions should remain the
same.

gen exposure at atmospheric pressure and (b) Arrhenius analysis for the activation
barrier from NiPtPt to PtNiPt in hydrogen using the time for  to reach 0.109.
A similar procedure was used for monitoring the Ni reduc-
tion and diffusion into the subsurface as shown in Fig. 5.
The white line peak absorbance intensity is shown to decrease
with increasing exposure to hydrogen. In addition, the reap-
pearance of the peak at 8374 eV indicates that surface Ni
atoms are diffusing into the subsurface. Using the same analysis
procedure, an apparent activation barrier of 13 kcal/mol is deter-
mined.
Qualitatively PtCo followed a similar diffusion and segregation
process as seen for PtNi but due to the lower signal to noise ratio for
the Co K edge and the lower activation barriers for PtCo, the same
quantiﬁcation of PtCo could not be performed at the current time.
Further studies are necessary in order to optimize the experimental
set-up to allow for the quantiﬁcation of PtCo and other Pt–3d sys-
tems. Additional information can be obtained by employing other
techniques, such as using XPS to follow the segregation of 3d met-
als [21] and the O K-edge regions in near-edge X-ray absorption
ﬁne structure (NEXAFS) to investigate the formation of 3d-O bonds
[22].
5. Conclusions
The thermodynamically preferred conﬁgurations in O2 and
H2 are predicted from DFT calculations and conﬁrmed exper-
imentally at atmospheric pressures. The subsurface Pt–3d–Pt
conﬁguration is preferred in the reducing environment of H2
whereas the surface 3d–Pt–Pt conﬁguration is preferred in O2.
This process has been found to be reversible, being able to
cycle between the two conﬁgurations. Furthermore, the activa-
tion barrier for the segregation of subsurface Ni in atmospheric
O2 is found to be 32 kcal/mol, similar to that determined under
UHV conditions. The activation barrier for hydrogen-induced
diffusion of surface Ni has been determined to be approxi-
mately 13 kcal/mol. Most importantly, the in situ observation of
the reversible interchange between the Pt–3d–Pt and 3d–Pt–Pt
conﬁgurations at atmospheric pressure should provide useful
insights into the maintenance and regeneration of the desirable
subsurface structure in catalytic and electrocatalytic applica-
tions.
