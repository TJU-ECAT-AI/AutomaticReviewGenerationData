Abstract
Thin pseudomorphic as well as thick “Pt(111)-like” Pt/Ru(0001) bimetallic substrates have been used to study the oxidation of methanol (CD3OH) to CO2. Specifically, molecular (cold deposited) and ordered atomic (annealed) oxygen precovered Ptn/Ru(0001) layers with n = 1–15 ML have been studied. Thereby, the thickness of the Pt films primarily influences the adsorption probability of O2 and much less the energy barriers for methanol reactions. In particular, no indication of a strain effect could be detected, and the reactions of methanol on Ptn/Ru(0001) multilayer films closely follow the known reaction scheme on Pt(111) substrates: On O2/Ptn/Ru(0001), methanol is directly oxidized to formate (DCOO) and eventually desorbs as CO2 (300 K). The formate producing reaction is thereby promoted by dissociating O2 molecules (130 K) and, at higher temperatures (130–200 K), by disordered atomic oxygen. This is in contrast to methanol postadsorbed onto ordered atomic oxygen covered Ptn/Ru(0001) layers, which exhibit formaldehyde formation and decomposition to CO and H. Interestingly, during methanol dissociation at 160–200 K, a remarkable fraction of methanol molecules experiences an H ↔ D exchange of the hydroxyl group hydrogen, leading to the dominant desorption of CD3OD. Our observation that the relative fraction of desorbing CD3OH is exceptionally low implies a bold primary isotope effect, which we attribute to the dissimilar zero point energies associated with OH and OD vibrations of methanol.

Introduction
In this study, methanol (CD3OH) reactions on (molecular and atomic) oxygen precovered Ptn/Ru(0001) layers with n = 1–15 ML (monolayers) have been investigated using infrared absorption spectroscopy (IRAS) and temperature-programmed desorption (TPD). These systems exhibit reactivity toward complete methanol oxidation and thus formation of CO2. In general, catalysts that convert methanol to CO2, as opposed to CO accumulation at the electrodes, are of high interest with respect to the direct methanol fuel cell (DMFC). (1-8) Because of such CO poisoning, catalysts that dehydrogenate methanol without complete oxidation may be unsuitable for practical use.
On Pt(111) no methanol reactions are observed in the absence of preadsorbed oxygen. (9) Referring to IRAS and thermal desorption experiments by Liu et al. (10) and Endo et al., (11) methanol activation can be initiated by coadsorption with atomic or molecular oxygen. Thereby, abstracted hydrogen readily removes all surface oxygen and desorbs as water. For submonolayer methanol coverages on O(2 × 2)/Pt(111) layers, formaldehyde was additionally found as a stable surface intermediate that decomposes to CO and H at elevated T; further oxidation of H2CO to formate merely represents a minority reaction pathway. (10) For saturation methanol coverages on O(2 × 2) layers, no stable intermediates were observed except for CO, which eventually desorbs at ∼500 K. Methanol coadsorbed with chemisorbed molecular oxygen on Pt(111) is reported to undergo oxidation to formate. Interestingly, this reaction occurs at temperatures as low as T ≃ 70 K, that is, well below the dissociation temperature of molecular oxygen on Pt(111). (11, 12)
Reactions of methanol on Ru(0001) have recently been analyzed by us. (13, 14) On the oxygen-free surfaces, methoxy as well as its decomposition product, CO, were identified as the only stable surface intermediates. Ordered O(2 × 2) or O(2 × 1) overlayers on Ru(0001), on the other hand, turned out to be entirely unreactive under the conditions of our experiment. This does not apply to residual oxygen (few percent) on clean Ru(0001), which induces a direct H-transfer from the methanol hydroxyl group to surface oxygen that is then removed from the surface as water.
The growth of Pt on Ru(0001) has been studied extensively with IRAS and STM in the submonolayer and multilayer regime. (15-19) It has been found that Pt grows pseudomorphically at least up to the fourth atomic layer. (17, 19) For higher layers, the strain relaxes and the Pt lattice constant gradually approaches the Pt(111) value. The (short-range) electronic influence of the Ru(0001) substrate dominates for few layer Pt films and vanishes starting with the third Pt layer. This peculiarity allows us to study the effect of laterally compressed “Pt(111)” on the surface reactivity. Experimental evidence for such an influence of strain on adsorption energies has been provided by Gsell, Jakob, and Menzel. (20, 21) DFT calculations explain this phenomenon by means of strain-induced shifts of metal d-bands with respect to the Fermi level. (22) For the system O2/Ptn/Ru(0001), it has been shown that the sticking probability of oxygen is virtually zero for the first Pt layer and increases step by step, approaching the value of Pt(111) for thick layers. (23, 24) It therefore appeared interesting to analyze more complex reactions, involving a variety of different bonds. In the case of methanol reactions, activation barriers now separate two surface species, both of them subject to strain and/or the electronic influence of the Pt/Ru interface, as opposed to the O2 sticking reaction, which involves surface species only on the product side. The fundamental question therefore was whether adsorption energies of transition states and of reaction products and educts scale evenly, or are they more or less decoupled.
In our study, we will first present results on methanol adsorption and reactions for O2 precovered Ptn/Ru(0001) layers with n denoting the number of deposited Pt layers. Subsequently, reactions on O covered Ptn/Ru(0001) substrates will be discussed. To the best of our knowledge, no UHV studies on thermally induced methanol reactions on oxygen precovered or clean Ptn/Ru(0001) multilayers have been published up to now.
Experimental Section
The experiments were performed in a UHV chamber at a base pressure of p = 6 × 10–11 mbar. The sample is a Ru(0001) crystal (5 N purity) with 10 mm in diameter and a thickness of 2 mm. It can be cooled with liquid He or N2 and heated to 1570 K (limited by the type K thermocouple) with linear heating rates of 0.1–10 K/s. The quadrupole mass spectrometer (Balzers QMA112) is equipped with a Feulner cup (25) (glass enclosure) to ensure desorption from the front face of the sample only and to enhance the desorption signals. The Fourier transform infrared spectrometer (FTIRAS) is a Bruker IFS 66v with evacuable optics (p < 1 mbar). Polarized IR radiation is produced by a water cooled blackbody source (Globar) in conjunction with a wire grid polarizer. Within this work, a LN2 cooled MCT (HgCdTe) detector was used, allowing for measurements in the spectral range of 750–4000 cm–1. All infrared absorption (IRAS) spectra were taken at a resolution of 2 cm–1 with 500–2000 scans coadded. For the IRAS measurements, the sample was positioned in a dedicated IR cell, which contained also a titanium sublimation pump. A uniform gas dosage at the IR measurement position is provided by a multicapillary array with individual diameters of ∼10 μm. The sample was cleaned by Ar+ sputtering (1.4 keV, 1 μA) and multiple O2 dosing cycles combined with flashing the sample up to 1570 K.
For Pt deposition, an e–-beam evaporator was used. The typical deposition rate was 0.03 ML min–1 at a growth temperature Tg = 700 K. During the evaporation time, the pressure increases up to 2 × 10–10 mbar. A more detailed description of the experimental setup has been published recently. (13, 14) The prepared Pt/Ru(0001) layers were characterized by monitoring the ν(CO) mode of adsorbed CO with IRAS. (17, 18) The error of the Pt coverage is estimated to 5%. Referring to the notation Ptn/Ru(0001), n denotes the number of deposited Pt monolayers (ML). In the following, a monolayer (ML) refers to the ratio of the number of adsorbates to the number of substrate atoms in the topmost layer.
Methanol was cleaned by repeated freeze-and-thaw cycles. All methanol exposures in this Article are specific to our experimental setup only and are given as the product of the pressure in our gas dosing system and the exposure time; the units used are mTorr s. Ten mTorr s of methanol approximately leads to 10% saturation of the first layer and equals 0.04 ML referring to the above definition as determined by XPS (integral of the O1s peak) and comparing the result to O(2 × 2)/Ru(0001). (26) An oxygen exposure of 1 langmuir (L) equals 30 mtTorr s. For Ptn/Ru(0001) with n ≥ 10 ML, an exposure of 10 L O2 at 80 K leads to an O2 coverage equivalent to a surface oxygen coverage of ΘO = 1 ML. The correlation of ΘO and n for a constant O2 exposure has been published recently. (24)
The isotopic purity of the used gases was 99.8% for CD3OH, 99.8% for CD3OD, 95% for CH318OH, and 98.73% for 18O2.
The data shown in this work primarily comprise the CD3OH isotope, as its vibrational modes exhibit somewhat sharper line shapes as compared to regular methanol. In addition, CD3O (methoxy) on Ru(0001) exhibits a 10 times stronger umbrella mode δs(CD3) (symmetric CD3 stretch) than CH3O, which allows a more accurate quantitative analysis. (13) A similar observation was reported in the literature for methanol on oxidized Ag(111). (27) On Cu(111), the umbrella mode was not at all observed for CH3O but for CD3O only. (28, 29) The reason for such dissimilar oscillator strengths for two methoxy isotopes is that mode coupling with the nearby ν(CO) mode enhances the intensity of δs(CD3).
Results and Discussion
Methanol on O2/Ptn/Ru(0001)
In this section, methanol reactions on Pt3–15ML/Ru(0001) substrates precovered with chemisorbed O2 will be analyzed. We like to state right at the beginning that the methanol reaction intermediates and product yields, as well as reaction and desorption temperatures, are largely independent of the Pt-film thickness for n = 3–15 ML; as Pt films grow pseudomorphically for n < 5 ML and relax for thicker layers, we conclude that strain within the Pt film has a marginal influence on the reaction pathway (discussed later). Because of negligible oxygen uptake and dissociation for Pt mono- and bilayers on Ru(0001), (24) the thermal evolution of methanol on these layers has been analyzed in the absence of coadsorbed oxygen; however, no evidence for methanol activation has been found under the conditions of our experiment.
Oxygen adsorption on Ptn/Ru(0001) proceeds similar to Pt(111); (30, 31) that is, O2 adsorbs molecularly at T < 120 K. (24) Upon annealing, a fraction of the oxygen desorbs molecularly at about 130 K, while another fraction dissociates to atomic oxygen and desorbs recombinatively at around 800 K.
In Figure 1A are displayed IRAS spectra of CD3OH postadsorbed onto 18O2 precovered Pt3ML/Ru(0001) for increasing methanol coverages (b–e) and increasing annealing temperatures (f–h) as indicated in the figure. 60 L 18O2 was dosed at 80 K, leading to a prominent stretch νO–O mode at 835 cm–1. Spectrum (a) depicts the O2/Pt3ML/Ru(0001) layer prior to the methanol exposure. After methanol has been, added all vibrational bands, while being fully compatible to equivalent data of CD3OH on clean Ru(0001), (13) display rather broad lines, which lead us to conclude that the coadsorbates build a heterogeneous layer. The following spectral features are attributed to methanol: ν(CO) at 955 cm–1 and several δ(CD3) bendings at 1060–1112 cm–1. In the region of C–D stretch modes, spectral features at 2193, 2220, and 2246 cm–1 have been identified (not shown), similar to spectra on Ru(0001).
Figure 1
Figure 1. (A) IRAS spectra of CD3OH adsorbed onto Pt3ML/Ru(0001) precovered with 18O2 (exposure: 60 L). Spectrum (a) shows the O2/Ptn/Ru(0001) layer alone. Increasing exposures of CD3OH (up to 40 mTorr s) are displayed in spectra (b)–(e). Spectra (f)–(h) show the sample after annealing to increasingly higher temperatures as denoted in the figure. (B) IRAS spectra of [CD3OH + 18O2], [CD3OH + 16O2], and [CH318OH + 18O2] coadsorbate layers on Pt3ML/Ru(0001); the layers have been annealed to 240–260 K to analyze isotopic shifts of the observed formate vibrational modes. All adsorbates were deposited at Tads = 80 K. The exposures of preadsorbed O2 were 50–60 L.
At 160 K, molecular oxygen (18O2) has partly desorbed (see thermal desorption experiments in Figure 3B) while another fraction dissociates, both of which contribute to the vanishing of the 835 cm–1 vibrational band. In parallel, the δ(CD3) mode of CD3OH at 1094 cm–1 has increased significantly. The observed change of the spectral signature is likely due to the replacement of molecular oxygen by atomic oxygen, which implies an altered chemical environment of adsorbed methanol. Moreover, no desorption of methanol is observed in this temperature range as will be discussed below. Analogous vibrational features of intact methanol have been detected on atomic oxygen precovered Pt12ML/Ru(0001) after heating to 160 K (see below).
A particular interesting set of vibrational bands (located at 752, 1276, and 2192 cm–1) appears after annealing to 240 K; they are assigned to the symmetric O–C–O bend, δs(OCO), symmetric O–C–O stretch, νs(OCO), and the C–D stretching mode, ν(CD), of a formate species (DCOO) with a local C2v symmetry. To corroborate this assignment, additional experiments with various methanol and oxygen isotopes have been performed. In Figure 1B are displayed the spectra of three different formate isotopes. Thereby, all vibrational modes of a C2v-formate expected in the spectral range 700–3000 cm–1 could be identified. Analogous to the methanol oxidation on O/Cu1ML/Ru(0001), (32) the reactively produced formate species consists of one oxygen from methanol and another one due to preadsorbed oxygen; otherwise, no shift in the line positions would be observed for the O–C–O modes if preadsorbed 16O2 is replaced by 18O2. The assignment of the observed formate modes (summarized in Table 1) agrees with literature data regarding formate on Pt(111), (11, 12, 33) Ru(0001), (34) Cu(110), (35) Ag(111), (27) or Ni(110). (36) Moreover, our detection of formate as a prominent intermediate in methanol oxidation is in agreement with electro-chemical experiments over Pt electrodes. (51)

aThe values in parentheses refer to low formate coverages. ν(OCO) frequencies of the HC16O18O and HC16O16O isotopes on Ptn/Ru(0001) are found at 1293 and 1316 cm–1 (low formate coverage values, see Figure 7). All literature data refer to species containing the regular oxygen isotope.
Interestingly, formate containing regular hydrogen exhibits two peaks at 2800–3000 cm–1; one of them is due to the C–H stretch and the other one is a combination mode, νcomb = νas(OCO) + δ(CH), of the forbidden in-plane antisymmetric O–C–O stretching and in-plane C–H bending modes. Group theory confirms that their combined excitation contains the totally symmetric representation and thus is dipole allowed. This combination band, observed on numerous surfaces (see Table 1), was first reported by the group of Bradshaw (35, 37) for the system HCOO/Cu(110).
On Pt(111), Sawada et al. (12) reported that (preadsorbed) O2 and CH3OH react to HCOO even below 80 K. In Figure 1, no indication for formate (DC16O18O) is found at 80 K. However, in the case of the IRAS spectrum of the DC16O16O isotope shown in Figure 2, the ν(OCO) mode at 1294 cm–1 could be clearly observed at 80 K, confirming the finding of Sawada et al. (12) The authors concluded that formate formation is caused by an attractive interaction between O2 and methanol, which leads to the dissociation of O2 even below 80 K. Endo et al., (11) on the other hand, postulated that formate formation is initiated by “hot” oxygen atoms produced in the course of O2 dissociation around 130 K.
Figure 2
Figure 2. IRAS spectra of increasing coverages of CD3OH adsorbed at 80 K on 16O2 (exposure: 50 L) precovered Pt3ML/Ru(0001) (a–c), and after annealing to 120 K (d). In addition to bands due to intact methanol (∼960, 1060, ∼1094, 1112, and 2050–2250 cm–1), the ν(OCO) and ν(CD) modes of DCOO at 1294 and 2192 cm–1 (not shown) are clearly discernible already at 80 K. Upon slight annealing to 120 K, they both gain in intensity.
According to our data, the amount of DCOO produced at low temperatures and even during O2 dissociation is rather small. In fact, this reaction seems to proceed significantly more effective at T ≈ 140–200 K (compare with Figure 3A), that is, at temperatures with atomic oxygen instead of O2 present. This observation strongly suggests that the formation of formate is not primarily promoted by dissociating O2 as proposed by Endo et al., (11) but it is also due to disordered atomic oxygen, especially at T > 130 K. The high reactivity of such disordered oxygen atoms toward methanol activation has been reported recently for the Cu/Ru(0001) monolayer. (32) In accordance with Sawada et al., (12) we believe that low temperature formate observed at 80 K in Figure 2 implies an alternative process and may involve some special sites of O2.
Figure 3
Figure 3. (A) Thermal evolution of methanol (CD3OH) and formate (DCOO) as monitored by the integrated IR intensities of various δ(CD3) modes at 1050–1120 cm–1 and ν(OCO) modes at 1270–1280 cm–1, respectively. The sample was prepared by dosing 50 L of 18O2 and CD3OH (dose: 40 mTorr s) at 80 K onto Pt12ML/Ru(0001). The individual IRAS spectra contributing to these curves were measured while ramping the surface temperature at a rate of 0.2 K/s. (B) Multimass TPD of [CD3OH + 18O2] on Pt12ML/Ru(0001) prepared as described above. The sample was heated with 1 K/s from 80 to 500 K. (*) The 4 u signal was taken from a second TPD experiment with a slightly lower Pt/Ru(0001) film thickness of 9 ML Pt under otherwise identical conditions; for this run, QMS desorption traces of masses 28–36 are virtually identical to those displayed here.
In spectrum (g) in Figure 1A, the formate vibrational band at 1274 cm–1 actually represents a double-peak feature with individual maxima at 1271 and 1276 cm–1 for the DC16O18O isotope. At T ≤ 160 K, the low frequency mode is dominant, and the second peak at 1276 cm–1 only appears as a separate feature upon heating the sample to 180–190 K. In Figure 3A are plotted the combined integrated IRAS intensities of the two modes as well as of the various δ(CD3) modes of CD3OH (1050–1120 cm–1) versus the annealing temperature. It is apparent that the somewhat delayed growth of the 1276 cm–1 peak is the reason for the extra increase of the DCOO intensity at 180–190 K. Furthermore, this process correlates with the vanishing of CD3OH related vibrational bands; this latter observation, however, is, at least partially, caused by methanol desorption proceeding in parallel.
The prominent desorption of CO2 at 300 K is clearly correlated with the decomposition of formate (bullets) at 250–300 K in Figure 3A. The final reaction step is therefore DCOO → D + CO2 with produced CO2 desorbing instantaneously. At variance to quite substantial CO2 evolution in the TPD spectra, no D2 (4 u) desorption is observed in this temperature range. It is suggested that D reacts with residual surface oxygen (18O in our experiment) and desorbs as water (D218O, 22 u) rather than desorbing molecularly as D2. Indeed, the 22 u signal exhibits a distinct peak at 300 K, which explains the missing 4 u desorption signal. The detected mass 12, 18, 28, and 30 u signals at 300 K represent ionization fragments of C16O18O. To avoid confusion, we note that the mass 30 u signal observed at 130 K is due to C18O formed from desorbing 18O2 and C at the filament of our QMS, as it closely follows the 36 u trace of desorbing 18O2; in experiments with preadsorbed 16O2, a corresponding peak appears for mass 28 u (C16O).
The QMS traces of various masses in the 170–190 K range in the TPD in Figure 3B deserve a closer inspection. Surprisingly, the masses 36 u and 34 u exhibit significant desorption signals, which cannot be ascribed to the initially adsorbed CD3OH methanol isotope (35 u) or fragments thereof. Furthermore, the outcome of such an experiment was independent of the isotopic nature of preadsorbed oxygen. Yet, these desorption signals provide clear evidence for significant CD3OD desorption as verified by the comparison of mass 29–36 u QMS signal levels in Figure 4: data from a TPD experiment equivalent to Figure 3B (black bars) are compared to the mass spectra of CD3OH (□) and CD3OD (○), which have been introduced into our UHV system. Evidently, the data from Figure 3B and Figure 4 suggest a substantial prevalence of the CD3OD over the CD3OH isotope, as the distribution of mass intensities closely resembles CD3OD and deviates notably from CD3OH. We suggest that this bold isotope effect (preference of CD3OD) is caused by the lower zero point energy of CD3OD as compared to CD3OH, in conjunction with the low temperatures sufficient for this isotopic exchange reaction to occur.
Figure 4
Figure 4. QMS signal levels associated with different methanol isotopes. The “□” and “○” denote the respective QMS signals as CD3OH or CD3OD is admitted to our chamber. Slight contributions of CD3OH in the dosed CD3OD gas, most likely due to isotopic exchange of the OD hydroxyl group at the walls of the gas dosing system, have been subtracted. The black and white bars correspond to the desorption signals at 188 K for [CD3OH + O2]/Pt9ML/Ru(0001) and at 203 K for [CD3OH + O]/Pt4ML/Ru(0001), respectively (see the Supporting Information). For better comparison, the two thermal desorption data sets have been aligned for mass 30 u. In both cases, the observed QMS signals of desorbing methanol are independent of the isotopic nature of preadsorbed oxygen.
The slight discrepancies in the relative intensities (bars and symbols) in Figure 4 probably are due to different dosing conditions: The thermal desorption spectra have been taken with the sample directly in front of the glass enclosure of the QMS (distance ≈ 2 mm). The mass spectra, on the other hand, were measured by dosing methanol through an MCA doser in our chamber (facing the QMS at a distance of ∼10 cm). Also, we should keep in mind that a notable fraction of introduced CD3OD actually converts to CD3OH at the chamber walls of the gas dosing system; that is, the QMS raw data correspond to a mixture of both isotopic species. The QMS signal levels of CD3OD have therefore been corrected for this CD3OH contribution so that the QMS values displayed in Figure 4 (○) refer to nominally 100% CD3OD.
The mechanism that leads to CD3OD formation and desorption at T ≈ 170–190 K is proposed to be an exchange of the hydrogen from methanol’s OH group by surface deuterium or hydrogen. Note that methanol dehydrogenation and oxidation to formate starts already at 120 K, producing surface hydrogen and deuterium with a ratio of 1:2. As no evidence for surface CD3OD is found, its formation presumably occurs close to the desorption temperature only. Regarding the details of this exchange process, it is worth mentioning that a recombination of a methoxy (CD3O) species with surface D to produce desorbing CD3OD can be ruled out as there is no evidence for the presence of surface methoxy despite a high detection sensitivity of less than 0.01 ML for such a species (see also below). For a related system, methanol coadsorbed with deuterium on Ru(0001), the total lack of H–D exchange reactions of the methanol hydroxyl group has been associated with the irreversible dehydrogenation of methanol to a strongly bound methoxy species. (14) This observation strongly suggests that the formation of a stable methoxy precludes the reversible H ↔ D exchange of the hydroxyl hydrogen with surface H/D.
At variance to the methanol hydroxyl group, the CD3 group of intact methanol is not affected by such an H ↔ D exchange; otherwise the IRAS spectra of formate should exhibit not only C–D but also a C–H stretching mode, in addition to an isotopically shifted ν(OCO) mode of formate (expected at about 1320 cm–1). However, under no circumstances did we observe such bands in the course of our experiments using CD3OH. For unsaturated hydrocarbon species, CH bonds may in fact undergo isotopic exchange with coadsorbed D. Specifically, for benzene coadsorbed with hydrogen on Ru(0001), various combinations of isotopically labeled C6HnD6–n species have been identified after slight annealing, and a prevalence of CD versus CH bonds has been found. (38, 39) In that case, a hydrogenation–dehydrogenation sequence (with a short-living C6H6D intermediate) has been proposed, a process that is not accessible to a saturated hydrocarbon species, or a methyl group.
The overall reaction can be described as follows:
with “(s)” and “(g)” denoting stable surface intermediates and desorbing species, respectively.
An analogous exchange reaction, CD3OH + D → CD3OD + H, has been observed for methanol coadsorbed with atomic oxygen on Ptn/Ru(0001) (white bars in Figure 4). Yet, in this case, H and D atoms are provided by a dehydrogenation reaction of methanol to surface formaldehyde and not to formate (see below). In both cases, remaining abstracted hydrogen atoms (H and D) react with surface 18O to water, which desorbs in parallel to CD3OD at 190–200 K. The 22 u desorption peak can be taken as unambiguous evidence for reactively produced D218O because no methanol cracking product is expected at mass 22 u. The other masses, which exhibit peaks at 180–200 K (2, 12, 28, 30, and partially 18 u), on the other hand, do represent methanol ionization fragments produced in the mass spectrometer.
An estimate of the CD3OD:CD3OH preference K must take into account the vibrational partition functions of both species at T ≈ 160–200 K. (40) As the majority of modes do not shift upon OH ↔ OD exchange and therefore merely give a factor close to unity, the OH (OD) stretch and bending modes will enter the analysis through their different zero-point energies. Because of their much lower vibrational frequencies, the bending modes contribute only little and may be approximately compensated by an inverse factor due to adsorbed surface D (H), so that consideration of the hydroxyl stretching modes at 3500 (2500) cm–1  (14) suffices to obtain an approximate value. Specifically, we obtain K values of the order of 40–100 for T ≈ 160–200 K, explaining the dominance of the CD3OD over the CD3OH isotope in the detected methanol desorption yield.
As the water formation reaction occurs in parallel to the described D ↔ H exchange of methanol and differences in OH (OD) stretch zero-point energies are similar, one may invoke as to why the water formation does not exhibit a similar preference for the heavier hydrogen isotope. The reason is that the applicability of such a thermodynamic argument (different zero point energies) is closely related to the question of whether the H ↔ D exchange process is reversible or not. Apparently, methanol (CD3OD and CD3OH) is able to release its hydroxyl H(D) reversibly. For water and OH, this is not true; as water does not dissociate on Pt(111) and adsorbed OH likewise represents a rather stable compound, produced OD or D2O will not be able to take profit of their even more stable configurations as compared to OH or H2O; that is, adsorbed oxygen accepts whichever isotope, H or D, initiates the reaction, and keeps it permanently. Therefore, the water formation path is not selective in terms of H or D. Actually, the higher zero-point energy of adsorbed surface H would imply a reduced O + H → OH reaction barrier as compared to O + D → OD, in accordance with our observations. Another process that may contribute to the prevalence of H2O in the water formation yield, especially at the low T side of the corresponding desorption peak, is a direct H-transfer of the hydroxyl H to nearby surface oxygen. Such a process has been unambiguously established for [methanol + D] on Ru(0001), (13) and it may well contribute to the observed high fraction of CD3OD in methanol desorption.
The yield of reactively produced formate and of desorbing CO2 is depicted in Figure 5 as a function of the number of Pt layers. Specifically, Figure 5 comprises the integrated intensities of vibrational modes associated with 18O2 (νO–O mode at 835 cm–1) and of DC18O16O (νO–C–O modes at 1270–1280 cm–1), as well as the (integrated) desorption peaks of C18O16O for nominally saturated O2/Ptn/Ru(0001) layers (exposures: 50–60 L for n ≤ 9 ML and 20–30 L for n > 9 ML) and an initial methanol coverage of 40 mTorr s (0.16 ML). Apparently, the quantities of produced formate and CO2 scale with the amount of initially adsorbed molecular oxygen. For thin Pt films of less than 6 ML Pt, this value becomes smaller, as a result of the decreasing sticking probability of O2. (24) For thicker layers (n > 6 ML), the efficiency toward methanol oxidation remains constant and probably equals the value of the Pt(111) surface.

Comparison of 18O2 coverages (integrated IRAS intensities of the ν(18O–18O) mode at 835 cm–1 after 50–60 L exposure at 80 K for n ≤ 9 and 20–30 L for n > 9 ML), the amount of reactively produced formate DC16O18O (integrated IRAS intensities of the ν(OCO) mode at 1275 cm–1 after annealing to 200–220 K), and the amount of desorbing C16O18O (integrated desorption peak of mass 46 u signal at ∼300 K) as a function of Ptn/Ru(0001) film thickness. All layers were exposed to 40 mTorr s CD3OH at 80 K.
In Figure 6 are plotted integrated intensities of methanol and the dominant reaction intermediate (formate) versus the surface annealing temperature for various Pt coverages. Obviously, the formation and decomposition temperatures of the observed species do not vary with n; that is, the activation energies of the individual reaction steps are largely independent of n. Consequently, the thermal evolution proceeds identically on laterally compressed (pseudomorphic (19)) Ptn/Ru(0001) and on relaxed Pt films (>10 ML) with lattice constants close to Pt(111).

Thermal evolution of CD3OH (integrated IR intensities of the δ(CD3) modes at 1050–1120 cm–1) and of DCOO (integrated IR intensities of the ν(OCO) modes at 1270–1280 cm–1) on various O2/Ptn/Ru(0001) layers, with n = 3, 6, 9, 12, and 15 ML. The oxygen exposures at 80 K were 50–60 L for n ≤ 9 and 20–30 L for n ≥ 12 ML. The individual IRAS spectra contributing to these curves have been measured while ramping the surface temperature at a rate of 0.2 K/s.
DFT calculations concerning Cu/Ru(0001) and Pd/Ru(0001), (41) as well as pseudomorphic Ptn/Ru(0001) layers, (19) show that for thin (n = 1–2 ML) films the electronic influence of the substrate is dominant as compared to the effect caused by strain. Thus, it would be interesting to study methanol reactions also on oxygen covered single monolayer Pt films. Yet, such experiments are virtually impossible as the sticking probability of O2 for n = 1–2 ML is negligible. (24)
The integrated CO2 desorption signal for the samples with n > 6 ML equals 0.08(±10%) ML; that is, the fraction of CD3OH molecules that becomes oxidized to formate adds up to about 50% for an initial methanol coverage of 0.16(±10%) ML. A calibration of the absolute values of desorbing CO2 has been achieved by means of TPD, monitoring the signals of masses 28, 32, and 44 u of reactively produced CO2 from coadsorbed CO and O (ΘO ≃ 0.13 ML, measured with XPS; Tads = 80 K) on Pt15 ML/Ru(0001).
Methanol on O/Ptn/Ru(0001)
In this section, methanol adsorption and reactions on ordered atomic oxygen (T → 300 K) precovered Ptn/Ru(0001) layers are described. In each case, O2 has been adsorbed at 80 K and the layers annealed to 300 K to induce at least partial ordering of preadsorbed oxygen. In accordance with findings for preadsorbed O2, the reaction pathways again seem to be independent of the Pt film thickness, and the amount of adsorbed oxygen represents the primary factor affecting the reaction yields on Ptn/Ru(0001) films of different thicknesses. IRAS spectra of CD3OH adsorbed at 80 K on Pt12 ML/Ru(0001) precovered with 0.15 ML 16O and annealed to increasingly higher temperatures are depicted in Figure 7A. At 80 K, intact isolated methanol molecules are visible with the following modes: out-of-phase [δ(OH) + ρinplane(CD3)] oop mode at 872 cm–1, ν(CO) stretching mode at 947 cm–1, in-phase [δ(OH) + ρinplane(CD3)] ip mode at 1280 cm–1, and δ(CD3) stretching modes at 1060–1100 cm–1. The ip and oop modes are characteristic for isolated methanol and therefore provide unambiguous evidence for intact methanol because both the CD3 and the OH groups participate in these vibrations. (14) The bands around 2100 cm–1 are due to a slight CO contamination accumulated during the O2 exposure.
Figure 7
Figure 7. (A) IRAS spectra of ∼0.15 ML CD3OH adsorbed at 80 K onto O/Pt12ML/Ru(0001) with ΘO ≈ 0.15 ML (1 L of 16O2 adsorbed at 80 K and annealed to 300 K). The spectra at 80 and 160 K show intact isolated methanol (872, 947, and 1280 cm–1 bands) and clustered methanol (∼960 and 1094 cm–1 bands), respectively. At 200 K, formaldehyde (D2CO) is observed (∼1087, 1289, and 1601 cm–1). At 220 K, minute amounts of formate (DCOO) are discernible (vibrational bands at 1293 and 2192 cm–1), while the spectrum is dominated by the strong bands at 2075 and 2097 cm–1 due to CO (from formaldehyde decomposition) located at Pt(111) steps and terraces, respectively. The cartoon illustrates the binding geometry of formaldehyde. (B) IRAS spectra obtained after annealing the [methanol + oxygen] coadsorbate layers on Pt12ML/Ru(0001) to produce η1-formaldehyde. Top, [CD3OH + O], T → 200 K; center, [CH3OH + O], T → 190 K; bottom, [CH318OH + O], T → 180 K. All spectra have been recorded after recooling to 80 K. The full circles identify modes belonging to formate.
Upon heating the sample to 160 K, the modes at ∼960, 1060, and 1094 cm–1, assigned to clustered methanol molecules, gain in intensity, while the characteristic ip and oop modes of isolated methanol are weakened substantially. The IRAS spectra of methanol on O/Pt(111) reported in the literature (10) agree with our spectra. However, Liu et al. (10) assigned the various vibrational modes at 160 K to a surface methoxy species. Yet, this assignment adheres to earlier HREELS measurements published by Sexton. (42) In our opinion, the spectral features look significantly different from methoxy on transition metal surfaces, (13, 27, 29, 43, 44) which in all cases exhibits a prominent Fermi resonance signature in the methyl group stretching region. While we cannot exclude that small amounts of methoxy may be present after annealing to 160 K, we attribute the dominant peaks at ∼960, 1060, and 1094 cm–1 to intact methanol as already mentioned above.
After annealing to 200 K, the spectrum changes dramatically. Specifically, the C–O stretching mode at 900–1000 cm–1 has disappeared, and new strong bands appear at 1087, 1289, and 1601 cm–1, respectively. Again, the vibrational spectrum obtained by Liu et al. (10) on Pt(111) looks very similar; they assigned two of these bands, at 1087 and 1601 cm–1, to the ρ(CD2) and ν(CO) modes of η1-formaldehyde, respectively, with the C–O axis tilted as shown in the cartoon in Figure 7A and as proposed by Anton et al. (45) for formaldehyde on Ru(0001). Note that the mirror plane of the molecule containing all atoms is still perpendicular to the surface. Regarding the assignment of the vibrational peak observed at about 1290 cm–1, Liu et al. concluded that this band does probably not belong to D2CO but to a different species that could not be identified. (10) According to our data, these three peaks belong to the same species produced after methanol dehydrogenation for the following reasons:
All three features correlate closely in intensity for all annealing temperatures, and they are observed in a narrow temperature range only (180–200 K) (see the Supporting Information).
The line positions are not affected by the isotopic nature of preadsorbed oxygen (see the Supporting Information). This latter point definitely excludes species such as formate, which contains two oxygen atoms.
On the oxygen precovered Rh(111) surface, heating to 240 K converts methanol to a η1-H2CO species as well, as deduced from HREELS data. (46) According to our data, formaldehyde formation is also found for the Rh/Ru(0001) monolayer (see the Supporting Information).
The interpretation of the observed vibrational bands to a tilted η1-D2CO formaldehyde is in agreement with findings of Anton et al.; (45) an assignment of the vibrational bands observed at 200 K in Figure 7A, along with a comparison to literature data, is given in Table 2. In particular, the observed isotopic shift of the ρ(CD2)/ρ(CH2) mode by +200 cm–1 upon D ↔ H exchange is in agreement with data of formaldehyde on Ru(0001). (45) Note that the ν(CD2) and ν(CH2) stretching vibration of the sp2-hybridized CD2– (CH2−) group of formaldehyde is located at 100–200 cm–1 higher energies than the ν(CD3) and ν(CH3) stretching modes of the sp3-hybridized methyl group of methoxy, (13) providing further support for a η1-formaldehyde with a C–O double bond as the observed surface species. According to Mavrikakis and Barteau, (49) the reduced electron density in the vicinity of surface oxygen should, quite generally, lead to a preferred adsorption of formaldehyde in the η1-configuration as opposed to η2-formaldehyde, in accordance with our conclusions.

To further corroborate the identity of this species, we performed additional experiments with various isotopically labeled methanol molecules as depicted in Figure 7B. The assignment of the 1601 cm–1 peak to a C–O stretching vibration of formaldehyde is thereby assured by the isotope substitution of the methanolic oxygen CH316OH ↔ CH318OH, which causes a frequency shift 1628 ↔ 1602 cm–1.
At 1289 cm–1, the frequency of the suggested δs(CD2) scissor mode is remarkably high. Comparing the data of matrix-isolated formaldehyde (47) and formaldehyde adsorbed on Ru(0001) (45) (see Table 2), the shift of this mode upon adsorption amounts to +86 cm–1 for D2CO, starting at 1104 cm–1. On Ptn/Ru(0001) or Pt(111), the frequency of this band is even higher by another +100 cm–1, reaching 1289 cm–1 for our layers.
The dependency of the δ(CD2) and ρ(CD2) line positions on the frequency of the ν(CO) stretch mode is depicted in Figure 8; the plot comprises data of D2CO on O/Ptn/Ru(0001) (this work), O/Rh1ML/Ru(0001) (this work), O/Ru(0001), (45) and of matrix-isolated D2CO. (47) Obviously, the δ(CD2) and ρ(CD2) line positions exhibit the higher values the lower the frequency of the C–O stretch. This effect seems to be related to the distortion of gas-phase formaldehyde upon adsorption, which appears particularly severe on Ptn/Ru(0001) and on Pt(111) surfaces. (10) H2CO on Rh(111), on the other hand, displays vibrational frequencies (measured with HREELS) that largely match those of matrix-isolated H2CO. (48) Interestingly, the Rh/Ru(0001) monolayer leads to substantially stronger shifts of formaldehyde modes as compared to Rh(111) (see the Supporting Information).

Dependence of the δs(CD2) and ρ(CD2) line positions on the frequency of the respective ν(CO) stretching mode of formaldehyde in different environments: adsorbed on O/Ptn/Ru(0001) (1601 cm–1, this work), O/Rh1ML/Ru(0001) (1615 cm–1, this work), O/Ru(0001) (45) (1650 cm–1), and matrix-isolated D2CO (47) (1694 cm–1).
The spectra for H2CO and H2C18O both exhibit two peaks in the regions of the δ(CH2) and ρ(CH2) modes at about 1450 and 1250–1300 cm–1, respectively. As the isotopic shifts of these modes are very similar (see Table 2), they are both attributed to formaldehyde, however, located in two slightly different local environments.
Much weaker bands located at 1038 and 1182 cm–1 for D2CO and H2CO, respectively, may indicate the presence of some unknown species. An alternative interpretation would be a slight off-plane tilt rendering the ω(CH2) of formaldehyde dipole active.
By further heating to temperatures above 200 K, formaldehyde vanishes suddenly, and the strong band at around 2100 cm–1 associated with reactively produced CO from formaldehyde decomposition grows to its maximum height. Additionally, a tiny peak appears at 1293 cm–1. Analogous experiments with preadsorbed 18O confirm the existence of this latter peak, however, significantly shifted to 1271 cm–1 (compare with Figure 1B and the Supporting Information). Hence, its assignment to the ν(OCO) mode of formate, produced in the course of formaldehyde oxidation, is straightforward. The corresponding ν(CD) stretch at 2192 cm–1 agrees perfectly with corresponding frequencies given in Table 1 and with experiments on Ptn/Ru(0001) with preadsorbed O2.
Figure 9 shows a thermal desorption spectrum of CD3OH on Pt12ML/Ru(0001) precovered with 0.15 ML atomic oxygen. The strong peaks at about 200 K are due to desorbing methanol and water, as well as various cracking products thereof. Note that this temperature range corresponds to the temperature where formaldehyde bands develop in the IRAS spectra. Analogous to the O2 precovered Ptn/Ru(0001) layers, an isotopic exchange CD3OH + D → CD3OD + H during the methanol decomposition and desorption process occurs as well, leading to desorption of CD3OD (compare with Figure 4). Surface H and D are thereby provided by the dehydrogenation reaction of methanol to formaldehyde in the temperature range 180–200 K. Interestingly, the D2CO reaction intermediate is observed in a narrow temperature range only and becomes dehydrogenated already at 200–210 K. In addition, we actually noticed a weak isotope effect, as formaldehyde formation and decomposition occurs at about 10 K lower temperatures for CH3OH than for CD3OH. This finding is in accordance with the higher activation energy for dehydrogenation of the CD3– as compared to the CH3–methyl group, due to a lower zero-point energy for the former. Regarding formaldehyde, it is worth mentioning that our detected mass 32 u signal at 203 K is entirely due to an ionization fragment of desorbing methanol; that is, there is no indication for D2CO desorption.
Figure 9
Figure 9. Multimass TPD of [CD3OH + 16O] on Pt12ML/Ru(0001). One langmuir of O2 was dosed at 80 K and annealed to 300 K to dissociate oxygen leading to ΘO ≈ 0.15 ML in advance of the methanol exposure (30 mTorr s at 80 K). The sample was heated with 1 K/s from 80 to 600 K.
By looking at the mass 18, 19, and 20 u signals of reactively produced and desorbing water (various isotopes) in more detail, we notice that the H-containing species prevails at ∼180 K, that is, during formaldehyde formation, while D2O desorption is observed as a sharp feature during formaldehyde decomposition only. This observation is in accordance with expectation as both hydrogen isotopes are released during D2CO formation, while exclusively deuterium is liberated in the course of its decay.
Actually, the fractions of desorbing HDO and D2O water isotopes at T < 180 K are considerably below expectation, if equal amounts of adsorbed H and D (from methanol to formaldehyde conversion) contribute to the overall water formation. Two explanations appear reasonable: (i) the hydroxyl group efficiently transfers its H atom directly to surface oxygen, similar to our observations on Ru(0001), (13) or (ii) abstracted D atoms are consumed in the exchange reaction CD3OH + D → CD3OD + H as discussed above, effectively replacing D by H as a surface species. While there is clear evidence for the latter process (see discussion related to Figure 4, above), process (i) appears likely, but must remain speculative for now.
CO produced in the course of formaldehyde decomposition at about 200 K partially desorbs instantaneously, or it stays behind as a surface compound and leaves the surface at higher temperatures: at 360 K, a strong mass 44 u peak indicates the reaction of accumulated CO and surface oxygen to CO2; the 28 u signal evolving in parallel represents a CO2 ionization fragment. In contrast, the small 28 u peak around 470 K is due to desorption of remaining CO after all surface oxygen has been consumed.
An analysis of the ionization fragments of desorbing methanol yields yet another surprise. The signal of mass 28 u at 200 K is way beyond expectation as a methanol ionization fragment. Purely thermal CO desorption at temperatures as low as 200 K appears unlikely as well. As the CO evolution correlates with formaldehyde decomposition, a nonequilibrated CO species produced during abstraction of both D-atoms may explain our observation. Note that bonding of formaldehyde is via the oxygen atom, and a flipping of the CO core is required to produce adsorbed CO. While a “one by one” abstraction of the two D leads to a chemical bonding of the C-atom to the substrate, eventually producing (upright) CO, a “two at once” abstraction would leave the CO in an unfavorable, nonbonding upside-down configuration, leading to instantaneous desorption.
It is left to mention that there is no indication for the scission of methanol’s C–O bond. DFT calculations of Greeley and Mavrikakis (8) show that on Pt(111) the energetic barrier for C–O bond breaking is 3 times higher than for C–H or O–H bands. In various experimental studies (10, 12, 13, 44, 50) dealing with methanol on transition metal surfaces, a C–O bond breaking path has been ruled out as well. In contrast to methanol on O/Cu1ML/Ru(0001) (32) and to the hydrogenation of oxygen on Pt(111), (53) no stable surface hydroxyl could be detected in the course of this study.
Conclusions
In this work, the adsorption and reactions of methanol on oxygen covered Ptn/Ru(0001) multilayers have been investigated with IRAS and TPD. Specifically, the reactions of methanol on atomic and molecular oxygen covered Ptn/Ru(0001) layers are found to proceed significantly different. In the latter case, the formation of a formate species prevails with no stable intermediate detected in between. To some extent, this reaction occurs even below the O2 dissociation temperature at T < 100 K, probably at some special sites; much higher rates, however, have been achieved at slightly higher T ≈ 140–200 K, after O2 has dissociated and most likely involves disordered oxygen atoms. Once preadsorbed oxygen layers have been annealed, formate is produced as a minority species only, and formaldehyde (η1-D2CO) is identified as the dominant stable reaction intermediate in the temperature range 180–210 K.
A central finding of this investigation is that the methanol reaction pathway on Ptn/Ru(0001) multilayers looks very similar to Pt(111) and depends only weakly on the thickness of the Ptn/Ru(0001) film. Strain within the Pt overlayers seems to influence the reactivity of methanol on these surfaces only marginally. The only relevant aspect to be considered when analyzing reactions on few layer Ptn/Ru(0001) substrates is the sticking coefficient of oxygen, (24) which depends dramatically on n and consequently affects the methanol reactions indirectly.
In addition to literature findings related to O2 or O precovered Pt(111), (12) isotopic labeling experiments allowed us to develop a more intricate description of the reaction schemes. Specifically, we found that H and D atoms abstracted during methanol decomposition lead to two different reactions, both of them proceeding at relatively low T ≤ 200 K: (i) hydrogenation of surface oxygen to gas phase water, and (ii) H ↔ D exchange between methanol’s OH group and surface H/D leading the preferential desorption of CD3OD instead of the initially adsorbed CD3OH. Our analysis of this latter process revealed a remarkable primary isotope effect, which we attribute to the difference in zero-point energies associated with OH and OD vibrations of methanol.
Referring to the DMFC where hydrogen acts as the energy provider, the easy reaction of hydrogen released during methanol decomposition with surface oxygen to produce gas-phase water (180–200 K) on Pt multilayers constitutes a severe drawback. A possible way out of this dilemma would be to enhance the adsorption energy of oxygen, for example, by employing PtxRu1–x surface alloys, thereby lowering the affinity of oxygen on Pt(111) toward hydrogenation; ideally, this may proceed without impairing its beneficial role in CO oxidation.
We note that application of our findings to realistic catalytic processes is not straightforward, and some caution is advised. For example, the clean Pt(111) surface is nonreactive under UHV conditions (reactions occur on defects only (9)); under steady-state electrochemical conditions, however, this surface exhibits higher current densities upon methanol oxidation than the Pt(110) surface, which is more reactive in UHV. (6) This surprising finding has been attributed to rapid CO poisoning of Pt(110) under continuous methanol flow conditions as a result of the relatively high reactivity of methanol on this surface. (52) Nevertheless, our investigation provides an in-depth view of the individual reaction steps and produced reaction intermediates. Interestingly, strain within the Pt films does only marginally influence the reaction pathways and yields of methanol on an oxygen precovered Pt surface. This is attributed to the fact that strain primarily affects adsorption energies; assuming that the energetic positions of transition states shift accordingly, the activation barrier separating two adsorbed species will stay the same (at least to a first approximation).

Abstract
Figure 1
Figure 1. (A) IRAS spectra of CD3OH adsorbed onto Pt3ML/Ru(0001) precovered with 18O2 (exposure: 60 L). Spectrum (a) shows the O2/Ptn/Ru(0001) layer alone. Increasing exposures of CD3OH (up to 40 mTorr s) are displayed in spectra (b)–(e). Spectra (f)–(h) show the sample after annealing to increasingly higher temperatures as denoted in the figure. (B) IRAS spectra of [CD3OH + 18O2], [CD3OH + 16O2], and [CH318OH + 18O2] coadsorbate layers on Pt3ML/Ru(0001); the layers have been annealed to 240–260 K to analyze isotopic shifts of the observed formate vibrational modes. All adsorbates were deposited at Tads = 80 K. The exposures of preadsorbed O2 were 50–60 L.
Figure 2
Figure 2. IRAS spectra of increasing coverages of CD3OH adsorbed at 80 K on 16O2 (exposure: 50 L) precovered Pt3ML/Ru(0001) (a–c), and after annealing to 120 K (d). In addition to bands due to intact methanol (∼960, 1060, ∼1094, 1112, and 2050–2250 cm–1), the ν(OCO) and ν(CD) modes of DCOO at 1294 and 2192 cm–1 (not shown) are clearly discernible already at 80 K. Upon slight annealing to 120 K, they both gain in intensity.
Figure 3
Figure 3. (A) Thermal evolution of methanol (CD3OH) and formate (DCOO) as monitored by the integrated IR intensities of various δ(CD3) modes at 1050–1120 cm–1 and ν(OCO) modes at 1270–1280 cm–1, respectively. The sample was prepared by dosing 50 L of 18O2 and CD3OH (dose: 40 mTorr s) at 80 K onto Pt12ML/Ru(0001). The individual IRAS spectra contributing to these curves were measured while ramping the surface temperature at a rate of 0.2 K/s. (B) Multimass TPD of [CD3OH + 18O2] on Pt12ML/Ru(0001) prepared as described above. The sample was heated with 1 K/s from 80 to 500 K. (*) The 4 u signal was taken from a second TPD experiment with a slightly lower Pt/Ru(0001) film thickness of 9 ML Pt under otherwise identical conditions; for this run, QMS desorption traces of masses 28–36 are virtually identical to those displayed here.
Figure 4
Figure 4. QMS signal levels associated with different methanol isotopes. The “□” and “○” denote the respective QMS signals as CD3OH or CD3OD is admitted to our chamber. Slight contributions of CD3OH in the dosed CD3OD gas, most likely due to isotopic exchange of the OD hydroxyl group at the walls of the gas dosing system, have been subtracted. The black and white bars correspond to the desorption signals at 188 K for [CD3OH + O2]/Pt9ML/Ru(0001) and at 203 K for [CD3OH + O]/Pt4ML/Ru(0001), respectively (see the Supporting Information). For better comparison, the two thermal desorption data sets have been aligned for mass 30 u. In both cases, the observed QMS signals of desorbing methanol are independent of the isotopic nature of preadsorbed oxygen.
Figure 5
Figure 5. Comparison of 18O2 coverages (integrated IRAS intensities of the ν(18O–18O) mode at 835 cm–1 after 50–60 L exposure at 80 K for n ≤ 9 and 20–30 L for n > 9 ML), the amount of reactively produced formate DC16O18O (integrated IRAS intensities of the ν(OCO) mode at 1275 cm–1 after annealing to 200–220 K), and the amount of desorbing C16O18O (integrated desorption peak of mass 46 u signal at ∼300 K) as a function of Ptn/Ru(0001) film thickness. All layers were exposed to 40 mTorr s CD3OH at 80 K.
Figure 6
Figure 6. Thermal evolution of CD3OH (integrated IR intensities of the δ(CD3) modes at 1050–1120 cm–1) and of DCOO (integrated IR intensities of the ν(OCO) modes at 1270–1280 cm–1) on various O2/Ptn/Ru(0001) layers, with n = 3, 6, 9, 12, and 15 ML. The oxygen exposures at 80 K were 50–60 L for n ≤ 9 and 20–30 L for n ≥ 12 ML. The individual IRAS spectra contributing to these curves have been measured while ramping the surface temperature at a rate of 0.2 K/s.
Figure 7
Figure 7. (A) IRAS spectra of ∼0.15 ML CD3OH adsorbed at 80 K onto O/Pt12ML/Ru(0001) with ΘO ≈ 0.15 ML (1 L of 16O2 adsorbed at 80 K and annealed to 300 K). The spectra at 80 and 160 K show intact isolated methanol (872, 947, and 1280 cm–1 bands) and clustered methanol (∼960 and 1094 cm–1 bands), respectively. At 200 K, formaldehyde (D2CO) is observed (∼1087, 1289, and 1601 cm–1). At 220 K, minute amounts of formate (DCOO) are discernible (vibrational bands at 1293 and 2192 cm–1), while the spectrum is dominated by the strong bands at 2075 and 2097 cm–1 due to CO (from formaldehyde decomposition) located at Pt(111) steps and terraces, respectively. The cartoon illustrates the binding geometry of formaldehyde. (B) IRAS spectra obtained after annealing the [methanol + oxygen] coadsorbate layers on Pt12ML/Ru(0001) to produce η1-formaldehyde. Top, [CD3OH + O], T → 200 K; center, [CH3OH + O], T → 190 K; bottom, [CH318OH + O], T → 180 K. All spectra have been recorded after recooling to 80 K. The full circles identify modes belonging to formate.

Dependence of the δs(CD2) and ρ(CD2) line positions on the frequency of the respective ν(CO) stretching mode of formaldehyde in different environments: adsorbed on O/Ptn/Ru(0001) (1601 cm–1, this work), O/Rh1ML/Ru(0001) (1615 cm–1, this work), O/Ru(0001) (45) (1650 cm–1), and matrix-isolated D2CO (47) (1694 cm–1).
Figure 9
Figure 9. Multimass TPD of [CD3OH + 16O] on Pt12ML/Ru(0001). One langmuir of O2 was dosed at 80 K and annealed to 300 K to dissociate oxygen leading to ΘO ≈ 0.15 ML in advance of the methanol exposure (30 mTorr s at 80 K). The sample was heated with 1 K/s from 80 to 600 K.
