Abstract
The adsorption and reaction of methylacetylene (H3CC¬CH) on Pt(111) and the p(2×2) and (E3×E3)R30°−Sn/Pt(111)
surface alloys were investigated with temperature programmed desorption, Auger electron spectroscopy and low energy electron
diﬀraction. Hydrogenation of methylacetylene to form propylene is the most favored reaction pathway on all three surfaces
accounting for ca 20% of the adsorbed monolayer. Addition of Sn to the Pt(111) surface to form these two ordered surface alloys
suppresses the decomposition of methylacetylene to surface carbon. The alloy surfaces also greatly increase the amount of reversibly
adsorbed methylacetylene, from none on Pt(111) to 60% of the adsorbed layer on the (E3×E3)R30°−Sn/Pt(111) surface alloy.
Methylacetylene reaction also leads to a small amount of desorption of benzene, along with butane, butene, isobutylene and ethylene.
There is some diﬀerence in the yield of these other reaction products depending the Sn concentration, with the (2×2)-Sn/Pt(111)
surface alloy having the highest selectivity for these. Despite previous experiments showing cyclotrimerization of acetylene to form
benzene on the Pt–Sn surface alloys, the analogous reaction of methylacetylene on the alloy surfaces was not observed, that is,
cyclotrimerization of methylacetylene to form trimethylbenzene. It is proposed that this and the high yield of propylene is due to
facile dehydrogenation of methylacetylene because of the relatively weak H–CH2CCH bond compared to acetylene. The desorption
of several C4 hydrocarbon products at low (<170 K) temperature indicates that some minor pathway involving C–C bond breaking
is possible on these surfaces. © 1998 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

Increasing the concentration of Sn in the Pt(111)
surface also changes the H2 desorption temper-

principle peak at 450 K shifts to 505 K and the
series of peaks from 500 to 800 K are transformed
into a less structured feature that now extends to
850 K upon changing from the Pt(111) surface to
the (2×2)-Sn/Pt(111) surface alloy. Increasing the
amount of Sn to form the E3 surface alloy shifts
the peak at 505 K down in temperature to 490 K.

on the two alloys, with no major inﬂuence of the
Sn composition on the desorption temperature.
The alloy composition has an inﬂuence on the
amount of benzene product desorbed, with the
(2×2) alloy showing the largest yield. Using the
benzene TPD areas in Fig. 11 and comparing those
to a calibration measurement of the benzene TPD
area from a saturation coverage (0.1 ML [37]) of
benzene on Pt(111), it is possible to estimate the
amount of benzene formed by the reaction of
methylacetylene to be 0.0056, 0.008 and 0.0025 ML
on the Pt(111), (2×2) and E3 Pt–Sn alloy sur-
faces, respectively.
Determining the relative importance of the vari-
ous reaction pathways on the three surfaces is a
key issue. This involves calibration of the relative
amounts of methylacetylene consumed to yield
each product. Using some reasonable assumptions,
and recalling that the initial coverage in the chemi-
sorbed methylacetylene monolayer on each of the
surfaces is the same at 0.25 ML, the estimates
summarized in Fig. 12 can be made. Earlier, it was
determined that HC=0.60, 0.15 and 0.075 after
