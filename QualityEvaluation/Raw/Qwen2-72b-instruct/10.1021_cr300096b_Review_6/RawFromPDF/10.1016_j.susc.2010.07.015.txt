Effects of bimetallic modification on the decomposition of CH3OH and H2O on Pt/W(110) bimetallic surfaces
Abstract
The decomposition pathways of methanol and water on Pt-modified W(110) bimetallic surfaces have been investigated using density functional theory (DFT), temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) and high-resolution electron energy loss spectroscopy (HREELS). The reaction of methanol on submonolayer and monolayer Pt-modified W(110) surfaces is compared to that on clean Pt(111) and W(110). Similar to clean W(110), the Pt/W(110) bimetallic surfaces remain active toward the dissociation of methanol, although the reaction pathway leading to the production of CH4 is reduced on the bimetallic surfaces. The Pt/W(110) surfaces are also active toward the decomposition of water. These results are compared with previous studies of the reactions of H2 and ethylene on Pt/W(110) bimetallic surfaces to reveal the different Pt-modification effects for the dissociation of oxygen-containing molecules.
1. Introduction
The formation of bimetallic alloys often provides a method of modifying metal catalysts to improve the catalytic selectivity and activity

. In the current paper we compare the decomposition pathways of methanol and water on W(110) and Pt/W(110) to determine the effects of bimetallic modification toward the decomposition of oxygen-containing molecules, in particular the dissociation of the O–H bond. The understanding of the adsorption and decomposition of methanol and water is of particular interest in the development of Pt-based bimetallic catalysts for direct methanol fuel cells (DMFC). One reason for choosing the Pt/W bimetallic surfaces in the current study is that Pt-modified tungsten carbides have shown synergistic effects toward the dissociation and electro-oxidation of methanol
[8]
,
[9]
,
[10]
. The advantage in selecting Pt/W(110) as a model bimetallic surface is that the growth, stability and morphology of Pt on many tungsten surfaces have been examined extensively in the literature
[11]
,
[12]
,
[13]
,
[14]
,
[15]
,
[16]
,
[17]
,
[18]
. The growth of Pt on W(110) has been reported to occur in a layer-by-layer mechanism at room temperature from previous studies using Low Energy Electron Diffraction (LEED)
[13]
.
Another reason for choosing Pt/W(110) as the model bimetallic surface is to correlate the reactivity of oxygen-containing molecules with our previous study of the reactions of H2 and ethylene on Pt/W(110)
[11]
. In that study DFT calculations predicted that the binding energies of atomic H and C2H4 on Pt/W(110) should be weaker than those on either Pt(111) or W(110). Such a reduction in binding energy was correlated to a shift of the surface d-band center away from the Fermi level as a result of bimetallic formation. The DFT prediction of weaker interactions of atomic H and C2H4 on Pt/W(110) were confirmed experimentally using TPD and HREELS
[11]
. A main objective of the current paper is to determine whether the interaction of oxygen-containing molecules, such as methanol and water, would also be reduced on Pt/W(110). Furthermore, previous studies by Madey et al.
[13]
,
[17]
revealed that uniform layer-by-layer growth of Pt on W(110) transformed into Pt particles after exposure to oxygen at elevated temperatures. It is therefore important to understand whether such structural transformation of Pt would also occur with the adsorption of oxygen-containing molecules.
The current study reports DFT, TPD and HREELS to investigate the adsorption and reaction of methanol and water on Pt-modified W(110). First, trends in the binding energies of methanol, methoxy, water and hydroxyl on Pt(111), W(110) and bimetallic Pt/W(110) will be described. The DFT prediction will be compared to experimental results using TPD and HREELS of methanol and water on W(110), 0.5 ML and 1.0 ML Pt/W(110) surfaces, and a thick (~ 3 to 4 ML) Pt layer on W(110). The extent of methanol and water decomposition on Pt/W(110) will be quantified and compared with clean Pt(111) and W(110) surfaces to demonstrate the effects of Pt–W bimetallic formation on the reactions of oxygen-containing molecules.
2. Experimental methods
The ultrahigh-vacuum (UHV) chamber used in the current study has been described in detail previously
[8]
. Briefly, it is a three-level stainless steel chamber equipped with Auger electron spectroscopy (AES), low-energy electron diffraction (LEED), a mass spectrometer for TPD measurements, and an HREEL spectrometer for vibrational analysis. The HREELS spectra reported here were acquired with a primary beam energy of 6 eV. Angles of incidence and reflection were 60° with respect to the surface normal in the specular direction. Count rates in the elastic peak were typically in the range of 5 × 105–2 × 106 counts per second (cps), and the spectral resolution was between 35 and 50 cm− 1 FWHM (full-width at half-maximum).
The tungsten single crystal was (110) oriented and the platinum single crystal was (111) oriented. Both the W(110) and Pt(111) samples were 1.5 mm thick disks (99.999%), 10 mm in diameter; and were purchased from Metal Crystals and Oxides, Ltd., Cambridge, England. The crystals were spot-welded directly to two tantalum posts that served as electrical connections for resistive heating, as well as thermal contacts for cooling with liquid nitrogen. With this mounting scheme, the temperature of the crystal could be varied between 100 and 1200 K. The surfaces were heated with a linear heating rate of 3 K/s in the TPD and HREELS experiments.
The preparations of Pt(111), W(110) and Pt-modified W(110) surfaces have been described in detail previously
[4]
,
[11]
. Briefly, the W(110) and Pt(111) surfaces were cleaned by repeating cycles of Ne+ ion sputtering at 600 K and annealing at 1150 K. Titration with O2 at 900 K and flashing to 1150 K were employed to help remove carbon impurities that were not removed by sputtering alone. The cleanliness of W(110) and Pt(111) was verified by AES before experiments. Pt-modified W(110) surfaces were prepared using physical vapor deposition (PVD) of Pt with the W(110) surface held at 600 K. The evaporative PVD doser consisted of a tungsten filament with a high purity 99.9999+% Pt wire wrapped around it, mounted on a stainless steel enclosure. The Pt coverage was estimated based on the reduction of the W(MNN 182 eV) AES peak before and after Pt deposition, assuming the formation of uniform Pt overlayers. This is a valid assumption because previous studies by Madey et al. have confirmed the layer-by-layer growth of Pt on W(110)
[13]
.
CH3OH (99+%) and CD3OH (99+%) were purchased from Aldrich Chemical Company and Cambridge Isotope Laboratories, respectively. Deionized water was used for H2O exposures. Methanol and water were purified by successive freeze–pump–thaw cycles and the purity of all molecules was verified in-situ by mass spectrometry prior to use. Doses are reported in Ls (1 L = 1 × 10− 6 Torr s) and are uncorrected for ion gauge sensitivity. In all experiments, the gas exposures were made by backfilling the vacuum chamber at a crystal temperature between 100 and 120 K, with the crystal located in front of the leak valve.
3. DFT calculations of methanol and water on Pt(111), W(110), and Pt/W(110)
DFT calculations were performed using the Vienna Ab-initio Simulation Package (VASP) version 4.6
[19]
,
[20]
,
[21]
. The W(110), Pt(111), and ML Pt/W(110) systems were modeled using 3 × 3 unit cells with four layers of metal. The ML Pt/W(110) system was modeled by substituting the first layer of the W(110) surface with a pseudomorphic layer of Pt. For each system, the top two layers were allowed to relax to the lowest energy configuration while the third and fourth layers were frozen at the bulk W–W or Pt–Pt distance of 2.78 Å, or 2.83 Å, respectively, as previously determined for the PW91 exchange/correlation functional
[22]
. The core electrons were represented using the ultrasoft Vanderbilt pseudopotentials (US-PP)
[23]
,
[24]
. The PW91 functional
[25]
was used for the exchange-correlation energy approximation utilized within the generalized gradient approximation (GGA)
[26]
. The basis set consisted of plane waves with an energy cutoff of 396 eV. A 3 × 3 × 1 Monkhorst–Pack k-point mesh
[27]
was used resulting in 5 irreducible k-points in the first Brillouin zone.
The binding energies of methanol, methoxy, water, hydroxyl, and atomic hydrogen were calculated on the W(110), Pt(111), and Pt/W(110) surfaces. The geometries used for the first four adsorbates are shown in
Fig. 1
and the binding energies are tabulated in
Table 1
. For all adsorbates, W(110) is predicted to have the strongest binding energy. Alternatively, Pt(111) is predicted to have the weakest binding energies for methanol, methoxy and hydroxyl. For molecular water, Pt(111) and Pt/W(110) have similar binding energies. The general trend in
Table 1
is that the addition of a pseudomorphic layer of Pt on W(110) decreases the binding energies of the four oxygen-containing adsorbates toward those on Pt(111). This trend is different from that observed previously for the adsorption of atomic H and ethylene, where the Pt/W(110) bimetallic surface was predicted to have binding energies weaker than both W(110) and Pt(111), as demonstrated in
Table 1
for atomic hydrogen
[11]
. In comparison, DFT results in the current study predict that the Pt/W(110) bimetallic surface should bond to the four oxygen-containing adsorbates either similarly to or more strongly than Pt(111). The remainder of this study will be focused on experimental measurements to compare the general trend in the adsorption and decomposition of methanol and water on Pt/W(110), Pt(111) and W(110).

a compares molecular desorption of CH3OH from the clean and Pt-modified W(110) surfaces. On W(110), 0.5 ML Pt/W(110), and 1.0 ML Pt/W(110), molecular desorption peaks of CH3OH are relatively weak, indicating that adsorbed methanol primarily undergoes decomposition instead of reversible molecular desorption. The molecular desorption occurs as a sharp peak centered at 237 K from the thick Pt surface.

Fig. 2
b, c, and d displays the gas-phase reaction products from clean and Pt-modified W(110) surfaces. On W(110), the desorption of H2 occurs as a broad peak centered at ~ 405 K. The evolution of CH4 (
Fig. 2
c) and CO (
Fig. 2
d) is observed at 482 and 405 K, respectively. An additional CO peak is observed at 963 K, which is attributed to the recombinatory desorption of atomic C and O. After the sample is heated to 1150 K, AES measurements confirm that no atomic O is present on the surface. In agreement with previous results
[28]
, no detectable amounts of gas-phase formaldehyde, CO2, or H2O are observed from the W(110) surface (TPD not shown).
Unlike W(110), the 0.5 ML Pt/W(110) surface shows two H2 desorption peaks centered at ~ 195 and ~ 405 K. Molecular CO desorption is detected as a relatively sharp peak at ~ 400 K and the recombinatory CO desorption occurs as a broad peak centered at ~ 963 K. Comparing to W(110), the 0.5 ML Pt/W(110) surface produces only a small amount of CH4. The TPD results of CH3OH on the 1.0 ML Pt/W(110) surface are qualitatively similar to those on 0.5 ML Pt/W(110). The 1.0 ML Pt/W(110) surface also exhibits a molecular CO desorption peak at ~ 400 K, however, the recombinatory CO desorption is detected as a relatively weak feature centered at ~ 963 K. No detectable amount of gas-phase formaldehyde or CH4 is observed.
The TPD results of CH3OH on the thick Pt film differ from those on 0.5 and 1.0 ML Pt/W(110) surfaces. The H2 desorption peaks are much weaker, indicating that the extent of methanol decomposition is significantly reduced. The desorption of CO occurs as a relatively broad peak at 400 K. Again, no formaldehyde or CH4 is detected.
The quantification of the TPD peak areas can be achieved by using the following decomposition pathways of CH3OH on W(110):
(1)
(2)
(3)
The values of x, y and z represent the number of adsorbed methanol molecules in each decomposition pathway. These values have been previously determined on W(110) to be x = 0.275, y = 0.034, and z = 0.098 CH3OH per surface W atom, respectively
[28]
. These values are used in the current study to quantify the reaction pathways of methanol on Pt/W(110) surfaces. For example, to estimate the value of z (methane pathway) on the 0.5 ML Pt/W(110) surface, the following relationship based on the CH4 TPD peak area was used:
(4)
Similar method was used to estimate the value of y (CO pathway) based on the CO peak areas from W(110) and 0.5 ML Pt/W(110). Finally, the value of x (complete decomposition pathway) was determined based on the peak areas of H2 from W(110) and 0.5 ML Pt/W(110), after taking into consideration that H2 was produced in both reactions

[29]
,
[30]
concur that the primary reaction of methanol is reversible adsorption/desorption, with desorption temperatures of the multilayer and monolayer occurring at 140 and 180 K, respectively. Additionally, step edges and defect sites of Pt(111) were attributed to the decomposition of methanol to form gas-phase H2 and CO at temperatures > 300 K. However, the overall activity toward the dissociation of methanol was rather low (1–2 % of the monolayer coverage) due to the low concentrations of defect sites. Furthermore, no proof was found that reactions of methanol on clean Pt(111) proceeded through the methoxy intermediate stage
[31]
.
4.1.2. HREELS results
Fig. 3
shows the HREEL spectra of 2.0 L CH3OH on Pt(111) after heating to higher temperatures. The assignments of the vibrational features are summarized in
Table 3
. The HREEL spectrum at 120 K shows the following vibrational features of methanol: 724 cm− 1, δ(OH); 1021 cm− 1, ν(CO); 1143 cm− 1, γ(CH3); 1454 cm− 1, δ(CH3); 2023 cm− 1, CO contamination; 2828 cm− 1, νs(CH3); 2970 cm− 1, νas(CH3) and 3308 cm− 1, ν(OH). The presence of the δ(OH) and ν(OH) features indicates that methanol does not undergo O–H scission at 120 K. Heating the surface to 200 K results in a significant reduction of methanol vibrational features, indicating that the primary reaction pathway of methanol is reversible adsorption/desorption on the Pt(111) surface. The increase in the ν(Pt–CO) mode at 480 cm− 1 and the ν(CO) mode at 2084 cm− 1 is from the accumulation of CO in the UHV background during data acquisition. The HREEL spectra in
Fig. 3
are consistent with TPD results that adsorbed methanol undergoes reversible molecular desorption on a clean Pt(111) surface

In contrast, methanol undergoes dissociative adsorption on clean W(110), as shown in
Fig. 4
following the adsorption and decomposition of [a] 2.0 L CH3OH/W(110) and [b] 2.0 L CD3OH/W(110). The assignments of the vibrational features are summarized in
Table 3
. The HREEL spectra at 100 K shows the following features (CD3OH features in parenthesis): 974 (988) cm− 1, ν(CO); 1143 (900) cm− 1, γ(CH3); 1434 (1076) cm− 1, δ(CH3); 1934 (1990) cm− 1, CO contamination; (2077) cm− 1, νs(CH3); and 2929 (2226) cm− 1, νas(CH3). Additionally, the CH3OH/W(110) spectrum exhibits a vibrational feature at 3558 cm− 1 due to water accumulation from the UHV background during measurements. The 100 K CD3OH/W(110) spectrum exhibits additional features at 1400 and 2922 cm− 1, which are attributed to CH3 vibrations due to CH3OH impurity in the isotope or in the gas-line. The absence of the δ(OH) at ~ 724 cm− 1 and the near absence of the ν(OH) mode at ~ 3300 cm− 1 are consistent with the formation of surface methoxy (CH3O) at 100 K. Heating the layers to 200 and 300 K results in no major changes, except changes in the relative peak intensities in CD3OH/W(110). Further heating of CH3O/W(110) to 400 K results in a slight decrease in intensity of the methoxy related vibrations.

HREELS measurements were also performed following the adsorption and thermal decomposition of 2.0 L CH3OH and 2.0 L CD3OH on Pt/W(110) surfaces, with Pt coverages being 0.5 ML, 1.0 ML and > 3 ML. The corresponding vibrational frequencies are listed in

show the representative HREEL spectra after the adsorption of 2.0 L CH3OH on 0.5 ML Pt/W(110), 1.0 ML Pt/W(110) and thick Pt/W(110). On the 0.5 ML and 1.0 ML Pt/W(110) surfaces, the HREEL spectra at 100 K and 200 K are similar to those observed on the W(110) surface, with vibrational features being consistent with adsorbed methoxy. One noticeable difference is that the ν(CO) mode is shifted from 974 cm− 1 on W(110) to 1008 cm− 1 on Pt/W(110), indicating that the interaction between the C–O bond of methxoy is different on the two surfaces. The observation of a lower ν(CO) frequency on W(110) suggests that the C–O bond interacts more strongly with W(110) than on 1.0 ML Pt/W(110), which is consistent with the TPD detection of the methane product from clean W(110) resulting from the C–O bond scission of methoxy. In addition, unlike that on W(110), heating the 1.0 ML Pt/W(110) surface to 300 and 400 K leads to a significant reduction in intensity of all vibrational features, indicating that the onset of methoxy decomposition occurs at a lower temperature on ML Pt/W(110) than on W(110), which is consistent with the TPD results in

The HREEL spectra of 2.0 L CH3OH on the thick Pt film (
Fig. 7
) show interesting differences. The detection of δ(OH) at 751 cm− 1 and ν(OH) at 3294 cm− 1 suggests that at least a fraction of methanol adsorbs molecularly on the surface at 100 K. After heating to 200 K, both features nearly disappear, indicating the formation of methoxy on thick Pt/W(110). Comparing to the W(110) and 1.0 ML Pt/W(110) surfaces, the vibrational features undergo much more significant reduction in intensity after heating to 200 and 300 K, consistent with the TPD detection of molecular desorption of methanol from the thick Pt/W(110) surface between 200 and 300 K (
Fig. 2
a). Finally, unlike the reversible molecular desorption from clean Pt(111) (
Fig. 3
), a small amount of methoxy species is produced on thick Pt/W(110). This is consistent with the TPD results (
Table 2
) that thick Pt/W(110) is more active than Pt(111) toward methanol decomposition, which can be attributed to the greater density of surface defects on the thick Pt/W(110) surface.
4.2. Decomposition of water
4.2.1. TPD measurements
The adsorption of water on clean Pt(111) has been investigated in previous studies
[34]
,
[35]
,
[36]
. It is proposed that water tends to form three-dimensional hydrogen-bonded clusters at low temperatures, even at fractional monolayer coverages, because the strength of the attractive interaction between two water molecules is comparable to that of the bonding between H2O and Pt(111)
[36]
. Upon heating water undergoes reversible molecular desorption from clean and defect-free Pt(111)
[36]
.
In contrast, water readily dissociates on clean W(110), as shown in
Fig. 8
of TPD spectra of [a] hydrogen and [b] water after exposing W(110), 0.5ML Pt/W(110), 1.0 ML Pt/W(110) and thick Pt surfaces to 1.0 L of H2O. Two broad hydrogen desorption states, from the decomposition of water, are observed on W(110) at ~ 183 and ~ 360 K, with a single molecular H2O desorption state at ~ 195 K. On the 0.5 ML Pt/W(110) surface, only one hydrogen and one molecular desorption states are detected at ~ 183 and 195 K, respectively. The 1.0 ML Pt/W(110) and the thick Pt surfaces show two hydrogen desorption peaks centered at ~ 170 and ~ 210 K, with a molecular desorption peak at 195 K. Although the desorption of the H2 and H2O occurs from all surfaces in a similar temperature range, close examination reveals that the H2 peaks are characterized by different peak shape as compared to H2O. This eliminates the possibility that the hydrogen desorption peak is solely due to the cracking pattern of the molecularly desorbed H2O.

The extent of H2O dissociation is estimated from the TPD peak area of the H2 product from different surfaces. The dissociation of water on clean W(110) has been estimated to be 0.43 water molecules per surface W atom previously
[28]
. By normalizing the H2 peak areas from Pt/W(110) surfaces to that from W(110) in
Fig. 8
a, the extent of water dissociation is estimated to be 0.13, 0.11, and 0.05 water molecules per surface metal atom for 0.5 ML Pt/W(110), 1.0 ML Pt/W(110) and thick Pt/W(110), respectively.

The HREEL spectrum of H2O at 100 K on W(110) (
Fig. 9
a) displays the following features related to molecularly adsorbed H2O: 744 cm− 1, hindered rotation; 1617 cm− 1, δ(HOH); 3294 cm− 1 and 3490 cm− 1, ν(OH) of H2O, as assigned in
Table 4
. The additional feature at 3660 cm− 1 is characteristic of the ν(OH) mode of surface hydroxyl from the dissociation of water
[37]
. The presence of this vibrational feature indicates that some of the adsorbed molecules begin to dissociate on W(110) even at 100 K. After heating the surface to 200 K, the following changes are observed: (1) a decrease in intensity of modes related to molecular H2O; (2) a shift in frequency of the ν(OH) of H2O to 3294 cm− 1; (3) a shift in frequency of the ν(OH) from hydroxyl to 3585 cm− 1; and (4) the development of features at 399, 602, and 784 cm− 1, which are in the range of ν(W–O) modes. The appearance of CO contamination from background accumulation occurs at ~ 1990 cm− 1.

Similar to the W(110) surface, 1.0 L exposure of H2O to the Pt/W(110) surfaces results in a mixture of molecular water and surface hydroxyl groups at 100 K (
Fig. 7
b–d). Heating the surface to 200 K leads to a decrease in intensity of modes related to molecular H2O. A new feature is detected at ~ 940 cm− 1 on all the Pt/W(110) surfaces, which is in the frequency range of the δ(OH) mode of surface hydroxyl
[37]
. Because this feature is not resolved on clean W(110), it is likely that the orientation of the surface hydroxyl is different on the Pt/W(110) surfaces from its interaction with the Pt atoms. A comparison of the 200 K HREEL spectra in
Fig. 9
shows that the intensity of the ν(OH) mode of surface hydroxyl decreases as the Pt coverage increases, consistent with the TPD results that the extent of water dissociation decreases with increasing Pt coverage on W(110).
5. Discussion
5.1. Comparison with H2 and Ethylene adsorption on Pt/W(110)
In a previous study of the dissociative adsorption of hydrogen and ethylene on Pt/W(110), DFT calculations predicted that the binding energies of atomic hydrogen and ethylene on the ML Pt/W(110) surface would be weaker than those on either Pt(111) or W(110)
[11]
. Parallel TPD experiments confirmed that the extent of hydrogen dissociation was reduced on Pt/W(110), as indicated by a smaller TPD peak area on Pt/W(110) than on either Pt(111) or W(110); the weaker binding energy of atomic H was confirmed by the observation that the desorption temperature of H2 from the ML Pt/W(110) surface was lower than either Pt(111) or W(110)
[11]
. For the adsorption of ethylene, HREELS results revealed that ethylene bonded strongly on both Pt(111) and W(110) through the di-σ bonding configuration, leading to the dissociation to produce atomic carbon and H2. In contrast, ethylene interacted weakly on the ML Pt/W(110) surface through the π-bonded configuration, resulting in a lower activity toward the dissociation of ethylene as compared to either of the parent metal surfaces
[11]
. Overall, both DFT and experimental studies indicate that the activities toward the dissociation of H2 and ethylene follow the trend of ML Pt/W(110) < Pt(111) < W(110). The activity trend is consistent with the position of the average surface d-band center values for the three surfaces, in agreement with the general correlation that surfaces with d-band center further away from the Fermi level, such as in the case for Pt/W(110), should bond to adsorbates more weakly
[7]
,
[11]
.
In comparison, results in the current study indicate that the activities toward the dissociation of methanol and water do not follow the same trend. DFT calculations show that the binding energies of methanol, methoxy, water, and hydroxyl species on Pt/W(110) should be either stronger than or similar to those on Pt(111) (
Table 1
). Experimentally, the activities toward both molecules follow the trend of Pt(111) < ML Pt/W(110) < W(110). One possible explanation is that the metal–O binding energy between oxygen-containing molecules and the bimetallic surface does not always follow the trend predicted from the d-band center. Another possibility is that the Pt/W(110) surface undergoes rearrangement upon the adsorption of oxygen-containing molecules. For example, it has been demonstrated that for the Pt–Ni bimetallic surface, the formation of metal–O bond induces the segregation of Ni atoms on top of Pt due to the thermodynamic driving force to form the Ni–O bond
[39]
,
[40]
; similar adsorbate-induced segregation has been predicted for other bimetallic systems, including Pt–W
[41]
. This hypothesis is also supported by the observation of Madey et al.
[17]
that Pt clusters are formed upon exposure to oxygen at elevated temperatures. In the current study the Pt/W Auger ratio decreases by about ~ 10% after TPD experiments up to 800 K. Although the Pt/W Auger ratio can be affected due to the screening by adsorbed oxygen atoms from the decomposition of methanol or water, the observation of a decrease in the Pt/W ratio suggests that a fraction of the Pt overlayer undergoes clustering upon heating to 800 K. Therefore, unlike the well-established correlations between the surface d-band center values and the binding energies of atomic hydrogen and hydrocarbons on a wide range of monometallic and bimetallic surfaces
[3]
, care must be taken when using the surface d-band center values to predict the binding of oxygen-containing molecules on bimetallic surfaces.
5.2. Effects on O–H, C–H and C–O bond scission of methanol on Pt/W(110)
As summarized in
Table 2
, the presence of Pt modifies both the activity and product selectivity toward the decomposition of methanol on W(110). On W(110)
[28]
, approximately 0.407 methanol molecules per metal site undergo decomposition via three pathways: (1) complete decomposition to produce gas-phase hydrogen, atomic carbon and atomic oxygen with a selectivity of 68%; (2) cleavage of the O–H and C–H bonds to generate gas-phase carbon monoxide and hydrogen with a selectivity of 8%; and (3) dissociation of the C–O bond to produce gas-phase methane and atomic oxygen with a selectivity of 24%.
In comparison, the presence of Pt atoms on W(110) surface reduces the C–O bond scission pathway that is responsible for the production of gas-phase CH4. At submonolayer to monolayer coverages, the presence of Pt does not significantly reduce the activity toward methanol decomposition, as indicated by the similar overall activity from the TPD measurements in
Table 2
, and by the HREELS observation that the O–H bond scission occurs on both W(110) and ML Pt/W(110) at 100 K. The Pt/W(110) surface retains the activity of W(110) toward the O–H scission to produce methoxy; the presence of surface Pt is likely responsible for the facile cleavage of the C–H bond of methoxy, as indicated by the lower decomposition temperature in the HREELS measurements (
Fig. 6
) and by the elimination of gas-phase methane (
Fig. 2
) that is an undesirable product for both reforming and electro-oxidation of methanol. More detailed DFT calculations of the reaction network and activation barriers will be required for a more mechanistic understanding of the bond scission sequence of O–H, C–H and C–O bonds on the Pt/W(110) surfaces.
6. Conclusions
The ML Pt/W(110) bimetallic surface is more active than Pt(111) for the dissociation of methanol and water. This trend is different from previous studies of the dissociative adsorption of hydrogen and ethylene on Pt(111) and Pt/W(110) surfaces, suggesting different modification effects of Pt toward oxygen-containing molecules. Furthermore, the presence of Pt on W(110) leads to a synergistic effect toward the dissociation of methanol: the Pt/W(110) surfaces react with methanol to produce methoxy via the cleavage of the O–H bond, with the presence of Pt also promoting the subsequent decomposition of methoxy via the cleavage of the C–H bonds, reducing the reaction pathway for the undesirable gas-phase CH4. The Pt/W(110) surfaces remain active toward the dissociation of water to produce surface hydroxyl at 100 K, with the extent of dissociation decreasing as the Pt coverage increases. Overall, results from the current study indicate that care must be taken when using the surface d-band center values to predict the binding of oxygen-containing molecules on bimetallic surfaces.
