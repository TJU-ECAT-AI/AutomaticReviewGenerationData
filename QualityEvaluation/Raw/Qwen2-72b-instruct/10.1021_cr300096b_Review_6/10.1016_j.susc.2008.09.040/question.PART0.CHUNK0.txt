Ethanol and ethylene glycol on Ni/Pt(1 1 1) bimetallic surfaces: A DFT and HREELS study Abstract The reactions of ethanol and ethylene glycol have been studied on Ni/Pt(1 1 1) bimetallic surfaces using density functional theory (DFT) and high resolution electron energy loss spectroscopy (HREELS). A linear correlation has been observed between the binding energies of ethanol, ethoxy, and ethylene glycol species and the surface d-band center, with increasing binding energy as the d-band center shifts closer to the Fermi level. HREELS measurements have identified the bond scission sequence of ethanol and ethylene glycol on Ni/Pt(1 1 1) bimetallic surfaces. Two bimetallic surfaces can be formed that possess very different chemical properties: one with a monolayer of Ni atoms on top of Pt(1 1 1) designated NiPtPt(1 1 1), and the other with the Ni atoms diffusing into the subsurface region, designated PtNiPt(1 1 1). At 120 K ethanol adsorbs molecularly with the OH bond intact on Pt(1 1 1) and PtNiPt(1 1 1), while dissociative adsorption is observed on NiPtPt(1 1 1) and Ni(1 1 1) film surfaces. Ethylene glycol adsorbs molecularly with the OH bond intact on all four surfaces at 200 K, and desorbs reversibly from Pt(1 1 1) and PtNiPt(1 1 1). In contrast, ethylene glycol undergoes decomposition on NiPtPt(1 1 1) and Ni(1 1 1) film surfaces through OH bond cleavage, forming an ethylenedioxy (OCH2CH2O) intermediate. This intermediate reacts by further dehydrogenation and CC bond scission to eventually form CO. Overall, the HREELS results are consistent with TPD studies that show the reforming activities of ethanol and ethylene glycol follow the trend NiPtPt(1 1 1) > Ni(1 1 1) film > Pt(1 1 1) > PtNiPt(1 1 1).
1. Introduction
The reactions of oxygenates on transition metal surfaces are important for a variety of industrial processes. The production of hydrogen from oxygenated compounds has been a topic of increasing interest as a way to alleviate the environmental impact of fossil fuel consumption. Ethanol has attracted particular interest because it can be produced from biomass, and the distillation of ethanol from fermentation of corn is already practiced industrially. Along with ethanol, ethylene glycol has been studied as a potential feedstock for hydrogen production and as a model compound for larger polyols that can be derived from biomass such as glycerol, sorbitol, glucose, etc. More detailed discussion on the reforming of oxygenates can be founded in recent reviews [1] ,[2] .
We have performed a series of surface science and DFT studies to investigate the reforming pathways of oxygenates on bimetallic surfaces [3] ,[4] ,[5] . For example, in a previous paper, we reported the reactions of ethanol and ethylene glycol on Ni/Pt(1 1 1) bimetallic surfaces using temperature programmed desorption (TPD). The NiPtPt(1 1 1) bimetallic surface, with a monolayer Ni atoms residing on the Pt(1 1 1) surface, exhibited increased activity for reforming of ethanol and ethylene glycol as compared to either Ni(1 1 1) or Pt(1 1 1) surfaces. The experimental reforming yield of both oxygenates [3] , as well as that of glycerol [4] and methanol [5] , displayed a nearly linear correlation with the surface d-band center as calculated by DFT, with increasing reforming activity as the d-band center moved closer to the Fermi level. It was predicted that other 3d-PtPt(1 1 1) bimetallic surfaces might also be potential catalysts for reforming of oxygenates. Recent studies using supported catalysts showed that NiPt, CoPt, and FePt displayed increased turnover frequencies for aqueous phase reforming of ethylene glycol compared to Pt [6] . The focus of the current paper is on the mechanistic details of the decomposition sequence of ethanol and ethylene glycol on Ni/Pt(1 1 1) bimetallic surfaces.
The reaction of ethanol has been studied previously on a variety of transition metal surfaces, including Pt(1 1 1) [3] ,[7] ,[8] ,[9] ,[10] , Ni(1 1 1) [11] ,[12] , Pd(1 1 1) [13] ,[14] ,[15] , Pd(1 1 0) [15] , and Rh(1 1 1) [16] . Ethanol reacts on Pt(1 1 1) to produce mainly H2 and CO, while on Ni(1 1 1) [11] the evolution of acetaldehyde is also observed. The reaction is believed to proceed through initial OH bond scission, forming an ethoxy species. This species can further dehydrogenate on Pt and Ni surfaces to an acetaldehyde intermediate, which decomposes to produce CO and H2.
Ethylene glycol has been investigated previously on Pt(1 1 1) [3] , Rh(1 1 1) [17] , Ni(1 0 0) [18] , Cu(1 1 0) [19] , Ag(1 1 0) [20] ,[21] and Mo(1 1 0) [22] . Ethylene glycol adsorbs reversibly on clean Ag(1 1 0) [20] , while on most other surfaces the decomposition has been observed to proceed by initial OH bond cleavage, forming an ethylenedioxy intermediate (OCH2CH2O). This intermediate can also be formed by reaction of ethylene glycol with pre-dosed oxygen atoms on Ag(1 1 0) [20] ,[21] and dehydrogenates on this surface to produce glyoxal (CHO)2, as well as reacting through CC bond scission to yield formaldehyde (H2CO) and surface formate (HCOO). The formate species further decomposes to H2 and CO2. On Pt(1 1 1) [3] and Rh(1 1 1) [17] the main products are CO and H2, while on Ni(1 0 0) [18] decomposition to atomic carbon and oxygen is reported to be the main reaction pathway. On Mo(1 1 0) [22] ethylene glycol adsorbs to form monodendate (OCH2CH2OH) and bidendate (OCH2CH2O) species, which react primarily through CO bond cleavage to yield ethylene, H2, and atomic oxygen.
In this work, we first present the results of DFT calculations of the bonding of ethanol, ethoxy and species derived from ethylene glycol on NiPtPt(1 1 1), PtNiPt(1 1 1), Pt(1 1 1) and Ni(1 1 1) surfaces. DFT calculations predict increased binding energies on NiPtPt(1 1 1) as compared to PtNiPt(1 1 1) and clean Pt(1 1 1), with the observed trend consistent with previous results for other molecules [23] . This is followed by HREELS studies of the adsorption and decomposition of ethanol and ethylene glycol on these surfaces. Ethanol adsorbs molecularly at 120 K with the OH bond intact on Pt(1 1 1) and PtNiPt(1 1 1), while dissociative adsorption is observed on NiPtPt(1 1 1) and Ni(1 1 1) film to form ethoxy species, which dehydrogenate further to adsorbed CO. Ethylene glycol adsorbs molecularly on all four surfaces at 200 K. Ethylene glycol undergoes primarily reversible desorption from the Pt(1 1 1) and PtNiPt(1 1 1) surfaces. In contrast, on NiPtPt(1 1 1) and Ni(1 1 1) film the initial decomposition proceeds through OH bond cleavage, forming a (OCH2CH2O) intermediate. This intermediate reacts through further dehydrogenation and CC bond scission to eventually form CO on the surface.
2. Theoretical and experimental methods
2.1. DFTVASP parameters
Theoretical calculations were performed with the VASP package [24] ,[25] ,[26] , which uses a planewave basis set with pseudopotentials to represent core electrons. The PW91 functional was used for self-consistent electronic structure calculations. Each surface was approximated by a 3 × 3 unit cell with four layers of metal separated by six equivalent layers of vacuum, repeated periodically. The top two layers along with the adsorbates were allowed to relax to the lowest energy configuration. A planewave cutoff of 396 eV was used for all calculations. The d-band density of states was determined by projection of the planewaves onto spherical harmonic orbitals. The surface d-band center values were previously calculated [27] as the first moment of the projected d-band density of states on the surface atoms relative to the Fermi level. The binding energies of ethanol, ethoxy and species derived from ethylene glycol were determined as the difference between the energy of the slab with the adsorbate minus the energy of the slab alone and the adsorbate alone. The dissociating hydrogen atom was not included in the binding energy of the alkoxy species. The Ni(1 1 1) film surface was approximated by Ni(1 1 1) in all DFT calculations.
2.2. Techniques
The UHV chamber used for the HREELS experiments has been described previously [28] ,[29] . It is a three-level stainless steel chamber (base pressure 3 × 1010 Torr) equipped with AES and TPD in the top two levels and HREELS in the bottom level. The HREELS spectra reported here were acquired with a primary beam energy of 6 eV. Angles of incidence and reflection were 60 with respect to the surface normal. Count rates in the elastic peak were typically between and counts per second, and the spectral resolution was between 30 and 50 cm1 full width at half maximum (FWHM). Each HREEL spectrum was normalized to unity using the elastic peak intensity and then scaled by a multiplication factor as shown in the figures.
The Pt(1 1 1) single crystal (Princeton Scientific, 99.99%) was 1 mm thick, with a 10 mm diameter, and was oriented to within 0.5. The crystal was spot welded directly to two tantalum posts that served as electronic contacts for resistive heating, as well as thermal contacts for cooling with liquid nitrogen. The sample temperature was measured by spot welding a chromelalumel thermocouple to the top edge of the Pt(1 1 1) single crystal and could be varied between 100 and 1100 K. The Pt(1 1 1) surface was cleaned by repeated cycles of Ne+ sputtering at 600 K and annealing at 1100 K. Following the last sputter cycle, 1 L of O2 at 890 K was used to remove carbon left on the surface, followed by annealing at 1100 K for 5 min. This cleaning procedure was repeated until negligible C or O was detected by AES.
Ni/Pt(1 1 1) bimetallic surfaces were prepared by evaporative deposition of Ni onto Pt(1 1 1), as described earlier [30] . The crystal was held at either 600 or 300 K during deposition, depending on which bimetallic surface was being prepared. The metal doser consisted of a tungsten filament with a high purity Ni wire (Alfa Aesar, 99.99+%) wrapped around it, mounted within a tantalum enclosure. The Ni(849 eV)/Pt(241 eV) AES ratios were used to determine Ni coverages, with a ratio of 1.0 corresponding to a monolayer subsurface PtNiPt(1 1 1) structure [31] . The monolayer NiPtPt(1 1 1) surface was formed by depositing Ni onto Pt(1 1 1) at 300 K for the same deposition time as for PtNiPt(1 1 1). For the Ni(1 1 1) film, deposition was carried out at 600 K until more than 6 ML of Ni were deposited. As reported previously, using the recombinative desorption of D2 as a chemical probe, the as-prepared Ni(1 1 1) film produced a nearly identical TPD spectrum to that from bulk Ni(1 1 1) [32] .
Ethanol (SigmaAldrich, 99.5+%) and ethylene glycol (SigmaAldrich, 99.8%) were transferred into glass sample cylinders and purified using repeated freeze-pump-thaw cycles. All other gases were of research purity and were used without further purification. The purity of all reagents was verified in situ using mass spectrometry prior to use. Doses are reported in Langmuirs (1 L = 1 × 106 Torr s) and are uncorrected for ion gauge sensitivity.
3. Results
3.1. DFT calculations
The binding energies of ethanol, ethoxy, ethylene glycol, OCH2CH2OH, and OCH2CH2O species were calculated on Pt(1 1 1), PtNiPt(1 1 1), NiPtPt(1 1 1) and Ni(1 1 1) film surfaces, as shown in Fig. 1 . Ethanol and ethoxy were adsorbed on an atop site through the oxygen atom as shown in Fig. 2 . On NiPtPt(1 1 1), the ethanol NiO bond distance and NiOC bond angle were 2.02 Å and 57.8 with respect to the surface normal, respectively. After removal of the first hydrogen to produce ethoxy, the NiO bond distance and the NiOC bond angle decreased slightly to 1.80 Å and 54.2. The binding energies of ethanol and ethoxy on Pt(1 1 1) were found to be 6.5 and 35.4 kcal/mol, respectively, in good agreement with values of 6.5 and 32.5 kcal/mol reported in previous studies [33] . Among the four surfaces, ethanol and ethoxy species were bound most strongly on NiPtPt(1 1 1), with the binding energies of 14.0 and 49.7 kcal/mol, respectively.

Ethylene glycol was adsorbed with each oxygen atom bonding on an atop site on adjacent metal atoms. Several other configurations were explored but were found to be less favorable, including binding through both oxygen atoms in fcc 3-fold sites or through one oxygen on an atop site. On NiPtPt(1 1 1), the NiO bond distances were 1.80 and 1.81 Å, with similar CC and CO bond lengths to those of gas phase ethylene glycol. The calculated binding energy of ethylene glycol on Pt(1 1 1) was 4.2 kcal/mol. Similar to ethanol and ethoxy, the NiPtPt(1 1 1) surface displayed the highest binding energy out of the four surfaces, 17.8 kcal/mol.
Removal of the first hydrogen through OH bond cleavage led to the formation of a OCH2CH2OH species. This species was adsorbed through both oxygen atoms bound on atop sites on adjacent metals atoms, as shown in Fig. 3 . Adsorption on Ni(1 1 1) was the exception, where one of the oxygen atoms relaxed toward hcp 3-fold site during energy minimization. As expected, the binding energies of this alkoxide were significantly greater than that of molecular ethylene glycol, with values of 39.3 and 65.1 kcal/mol on Pt(1 1 1) and NiPtPt(1 1 1), respectively.

Removal of the second hydrogen through OH bond cleavage led to the formation of an ethylenedioxy (OCH2CH2O) species. This intermediate has been observed experimentally on Mo(1 1 0) [22] , Ag(1 1 0) [20] , and Rh(1 1 1) [17] . The binding geometry was again through both oxygen atoms bound on atop sites on adjacent metals atoms, as shown in Fig. 3 , with one of the oxygen atoms preferring the 3-fold hcp site on Ni(1 1 1). With removal of the second hydrogen atom, the binding energies further increased by about 30 kcal/mol on each of the surfaces. However, the binding energy trend for the different surfaces remained the same, increasing in the order: PtNiPt(1 1 1) < Pt(1 1 1) < Ni(1 1 1) < NiPtPt(1 1 1). The calculated binding energies on Pt(1 1 1) and NiPtPt(1 1 1) were 61.0 and 93.0 kcal/mol, respectively.The binding energies of all the adsorbates in Fig. 1 displayed a nearly linear correlation with the surface d-band center. The binding energy increased as the d-band center shifted closer to the Fermi level, in agreement with the theory of chemisorption by Hammer and Nrskov [34] . Similar trends have been observed previously for methanol and methoxy on Ni/Pt(1 1 1) bimetallic surfaces [5] . The increased binding energies on NiPtPt(1 1 1), compared to Pt(1 1 1) and PtNiPt(1 1 1), might be expected to lead to an increase in the degree of decomposition of oxygenates, as confirmed experimentally below.
3.2. Brief overview of TPD results
The reactions of ethanol and ethylene glycol on Pt(1 1 1) and Ni/Pt(1 1 1) bimetallic surfaces were studied previously using TPD [3] . A summary of those results is presented in Fig. 4 a, which compares the TPD results for molecular desorption of ethanol and ethylene glycol from the four surfaces. The fragment at 31 amu was the most abundant in the cracking pattern of both molecules. Ethylene glycol multilayer desorption occurred at 227 K on all surfaces. Monolayer desorption occurred at 266 K from Pt(1 1 1), and at 257 K from PtNiPt(1 1 1), NiPtPt(1 1 1) and Ni(1 1 1) film. The peak area for monolayer desorption was greater on Pt(1 1 1) and PtNiPt(1 1 1) than on NiPtPt(1 1 1) and Ni(1 1 1) film, suggesting an increased degree of decomposition on NiPtPt(1 1 1) and Ni(1 1 1) film. Ethanol monolayer desorption occurred at about 230 K with similar peak areas from Pt(1 1 1), PtNiPt(1 1 1), and Ni(1 1 1) film. On NiPtPt(1 1 1), monolayer desorption was not observed, suggesting increased decomposition on this surface.

Fig. 4 b compares desorption of the H2 product from the reactions of ethanol and ethylene glycol. For both oxygenates, a relatively small amount of H2 was produced on clean Pt(1 1 1). Addition of Ni changed the amount of H2 produced, depending on which Ni/Pt(1 1 1) bimetallic structure was formed. Increased H2 production was observed on the surface monolayer NiPtPt(1 1 1) for both ethanol and ethylene glycol, as compared to either Pt(1 1 1) or the Ni(1 1 1) film. On the other hand, the subsurface monolayer PtNiPt(1 1 1) showed decreased H2 production from both oxygenates as compared to either of the monometallic surfaces.
3.3. Ethanol HREELS
HREELS was used to further understand the different reaction pathways and to probe the surface intermediates involved in the chemistry of oxygenates on the four different surfaces. HREEL spectra following different initial exposures of ethanol on Pt(1 1 1) at 120 K are shown in Fig. 5 . The first spectrum was recorded following an exposure of 1 L, which corresponded to a coverage just below the onset of multilayer desorption from TPD (data not shown). The following vibrational features were observed: 660 cm1, γ(OH); 810 cm1, γ(CH2); 880 cm1, νs(CCO); 1050 cm1, νas(CCO); 1370 cm1, δs(CH3); 1460 cm1, δ(CH2); 2980 cm1, νas(CH3); and 3270 cm1, ν(OH). The vibrational assignments are summarized in Table 1 . The HREEL spectrum was indicative of molecularly adsorbed ethanol with the OH bond still intact, as indicated by the presence of the ν(OH) and γ(OH) features at 3230 and 660 cm1, respectively. The other two spectra in Fig. 5 were recorded following higher exposures of ethanol, and exhibited contributions from both monolayer and multilayer states based on TPD experiments (data not shown). No significant changes were observed as compared to that of the 1 L spectrum, except for the broadening of the γ(OH) mode, most likely due to hydrogen bonding between neighboring ethanol molecules. Overall, the similarity of the 1 L spectrum to that after a 10 L dose of ethanol confirmed that ethanol adsorbed molecularly on Pt(1 1 1) and was largely unperturbed compared to the gas phase.

To determine the thermal decomposition pathway of ethanol on Pt(1 1 1), HREEL spectra were taken after heating the surface to the indicated temperatures, as shown in Fig. 6 a. After heating the surface to 200 K, the modes associated with ethanol, the γ(OH) and ν(OH) modes at 660 and 3270 cm1, respectively, decreased in intensity. Meanwhile new vibrational features indicative of adsorbed CO were observed for ν(CO) at 1830 and 2080 cm1 and ν(MC) at 410 and 480 cm1. Upon further heating to 300 K, the modes associated with ethanol disappeared altogether, and only those due to linear and bridge-bonded CO were observed. With further heating to 400 K, no changes in the HREEL spectrum were observed. The presence of the CO species was most likely from the adsorption of CO from the UHV background.

The thermal decomposition of 1 L ethanol on the Ni(1 1 1) film is shown in Fig. 6 b. On this surface ethanol adsorbed dissociatively to form ethoxy species, as shown by the absence of the ν(OH) and γ(OH) vibrational modes and changes in the relative intensity of several other modes. After heating to 200 K, the ethoxy species remained intact on the surface. After heating to 300 K, ethoxy began to decompose to form adsorbed CO, with most of the vibrational modes associated with ethoxy still present but with decreased intensity. With further heating to 400 K, only adsorbed CO was present on the surface. Overall, the results on the Ni(1 1 1) film were consistent with previous studies on Ni(1 1 1) [11] ,[12] .
The reactivity of ethanol was then studied on the two Ni/Pt(1 1 1) bimetallic surfaces to compare with results obtained on the parent metals. HREEL spectra following 1 L ethanol exposure on PtNiPt(1 1 1) are shown in Fig. 7 a. The HREEL spectrum following adsorption at 120 K was similar to that on Pt(1 1 1). The presence of the γ(OH) mode at 680 cm1 indicated that at least some of the ethanol was still present molecularly. However, the weak ν(OH) mode observed on Pt(1 1 1) was not present on PtNiPt(1 1 1), suggestive of dissociative adsorption of the some of the ethanol to produce a surface ethoxy species. After heating the surface to 200 K the γ(OH) mode at 680 cm1 decreased in intensity but was still present, while new modes due to CO (2060 and 490 cm1) were observed. These changes were accompanied by a slight decrease in the intensity of all the ethanol modes. The spectrum at 200 K was indicative of a mixture of mostly ethanol with some ethoxy species on the surface. This is in agreement with the TPD results in Fig. 4 a that showed monolayer ethanol desorption occurred at about 230 K. With further heating, both the 300 and 400 K HREEL spectra exhibited only modes associated with linear and bridge-bonded CO, indicating that the majority of adsorbed ethanol molecules desorbed intact. The ethoxy species that were present in small amounts at 200 K decomposed to produce CO, with no other surface intermediates being detected.

Different results were obtained for ethanol on NiPtPt(1 1 1), as shown in Fig. 7 b. Ethanol adsorbed dissociatively on this surface at 120 K, as supported by the absence of both the ν(OH) and γ(OH) vibrational modes. The ethoxy species remained after heating to 200 K. After heating the surface to 300 K, the ethoxy species began to decompose, producing adsorbed CO on the surface (1820 cm1). However, vibrations associated with ethoxy fragments, or possibly other decomposition intermediates, were still detected. Vibrations associated with adsorbed hydroxyl species were also observed, most likely due to the reaction of water from the UHV background during the scan. The NiPtPt(1 1 1) surface has been shown to be very active toward water dissociation (data not shown). Further heating to 400 K showed only modes attributed to CO and OH groups adsorbed on the surface.
3.4. Ethylene glycol HREELS
HREELS studies were carried out to monitor the thermal decomposition of 1 L ethylene glycol on Pt(1 1 1), as shown in Fig. 8 a. Small amounts of water were found as an impurity in the ethylene glycol. To prevent the adsorption of water on the surface during dosing, ethylene glycol was dosed at 200 K, which was below the desorption temperature of ethylene glycol from the monolayer (266 K) and multilayer (227 K) states [3] . An exposure of ethylene glycol was chosen which corresponded to below the onset of multilayer by TPD (data not shown). The HREEL spectrum at 200 K exhibited the following vibrational modes as summarized in Table 2 : 700 cm1, τ(OH); 865 cm1, ρr(CH2); 1080 cm1, νs(CO); 1250 cm1, ρt(CH2); 1360 cm1, ρw(CH2); 1450 cm1, δ(CH2); 2850 cm1, νs(CH); 2920 cm1, νas(CH); and 3270 cm1, ν(OH). Overall, this indicated that ethylene glycol adsorbed molecularly on Pt(1 1 1) at 200 K with the OH bonds intact. After heating the surface to 225 K, the following changes were observed: (1) the ν(OH) mode at 3270 cm1 decreased in intensity, suggesting the beginning of OH bond cleavage, (2) the relative intensity of the νs(CO) mode at 1080 cm1 decreased compared to the spectrum at 200 K, (3) a new vibrational mode appeared at 1035 cm1 that was convoluted with the peak at 1080 cm1, and (4) the mode at 1760 cm1 shifted to 1785 cm1 and increased in intensity. Further heating the surface to 250 K produced several additional changes: (1) new modes at 410 and 470 cm1 appeared due to bridge and linear metal-CO vibrations, (2) the mode attributed to bridge ν(CO) appeared at 1830 cm1 and the mode attributed to linear ν(CO) shifted to 2080 cm1 with increased intensity, and (3) the modes associated with ethylene glycol decreased in intensity but were still detected. These changes indicated that some of the surface species had decomposed to form CO on the surface, with the remaining species present as molecular ethylene glycol. This is consistent with the TPD results in Fig. 3 a, where desorption of monolayer ethylene glycol occurred at about 266 K. After heating the surface to 300 and 400 K, most of the vibrational modes associated with ethylene glycol disappeared except for the presence of a weak ν(CH) peak. The surface was dominated by linear and bridge bonded CO.

A fraction of ethylene glycol adsorbed molecularly on this surface at 200 K, as indicated by the presence of the ν(OH) peak at 3300 cm1. However, the intensity of this peak was reduced compared to that on Pt(1 1 1), suggesting that some of the ethylene glycol adsorbed dissociatively on the Ni(1 1 1) film. After heating to 225 K, the ν(OH) peak at 3300 cm1 disappeared, indicating complete OH bond cleavage at this temperature. This was consistent with the TPD results in Fig. 4 a, which showed that the monolayer molecular desorption peak was weak compared to that on Pt(1 1 1), indicating that most of the adsorbed species underwent decomposition upon heating on Ni(1 1 1). No changes in the HREEL spectrum were observed with further heating to 250 K. After heating the surface to 300 K, the surface species began to decompose to produce adsorbed CO on the surface. A ν(OH) peak was observed at 3500 cm1, most likely from the reaction of Ni(1 1 1) with H2O in the UHV background. After heating to 400 K, only modes associated with adsorbed CO were present.
The thermal decomposition of ethylene glycol was studied on the two Ni/Pt(1 1 1) bimetallic surfaces for comparison with the results on the parent metals.
Fig. 9 a displays the thermal decomposition of 1 L ethylene glycol on PtNiPt(1 1 1). Ethylene glycol adsorbed molecularly at 200 K, with the OH bonds remaining intact as shown by the strong ν(OH) and τ(OH) peaks at 3270 and 680 cm1, respectively. After heating the surface to 225 K, the ν(OH) and τ(OH) peaks both decreased in intensity, indicating that ethylene glycol began to desorb or to decompose through OH bond cleavage. The other peaks in the HREEL spectrum associated with ethylene glycol did not change in intensity or position. After heating to 250 K, further decomposition was observed with the appearance of adsorbed CO at 2040 cm1. With further heating to 300 K, the surface species continued to decompose, producing linear and bridge-bonded CO. The peaks associated with ethylene glycol were still present, but with lower intensities. After heating the surface to 400 K, mostly CO was observed on the surface.

The thermal decomposition of 1 L ethylene glycol on the NiPtPt(1 1 1) surface is shown in Fig. 9 b. Ethylene glycol adsorbed molecularly at 200 K, similar to results obtained on Pt(1 1 1) and PtNiPt(1 1 1). After heating to 225 K, ethylene glycol reacted through OH bond cleavage, as indicated by the reduction in the ν(OH) peak at 3290 cm1. As shown in Fig. 4 a, monolayer desorption of ethylene glycol occurred at about 257 K from NiPtPt(1 1 1) via a very weak peak, suggesting that most of the adsorbed species underwent decomposition. Similar to HREELS studies of methanol and ethanol, the NiPtPt(1 1 1) surface showed evidence of surface OH groups due to the decomposition of water. With further heating to 250 and 300 K, changes in the relative intensities of the modes associated with ethylene glycol were observed, as well as the appearance of modes attributed to adsorbed CO. After heating the surface to 400 K, the surface was covered by adsorbed CO and OH groups.
4. Discussion
4.1. Reaction of ethanol
Previous TPD studies of ethanol on Ni/Pt(1 1 1) bimetallic surfaces [3] have shown the following trend in terms of reforming activity: NiPtPt(1 1 1) > Ni(1 1 1) film > Pt(1 1 1) > PtNiPt(1 1 1). The reforming activity displays a nearly linear correlation with the surface d-band center of these surfaces. In the current study, the DFT calculations of ethanol and ethoxy binding energies ( Fig. 1 ) were found to follow a similar trend, with the highest binding energies on NiPtPt(1 1 1).
The HREELS results help to determine the decomposition sequence of ethanol on the different surfaces. On Pt(1 1 1) and PtNiPt(1 1 1), HREEL spectra at 120 K show the γ(OH) mode at 660 cm1. The ν(OH) mode at 3270 cm1 is very weak, being slightly stronger on Pt(1 1 1) than on PtNiPt(1 1 1). These observations indicate that at least a fraction of ethanol adsorbs molecularly on these surfaces. In contrast, on NiPtPt(1 1 1) and Ni(1 1 1) film surfaces, ethanol adsorption at 120 K is dissociative, as shown by the lack of the γ(OH) feature, with the ν(OH) mode being only visible as an unresolved shoulder on the ν(CH3) peak.After heating the Pt(1 1 1) and PtNiPt(1 1 1) surfaces to 200 K, the vibrational modes associated with ethanol decrease in intensity. On PtNiPt(1 1 1) the γ(OH) feature remains, but it is very weak. On Pt(1 1 1), due to the low intensity it is not possible to determine if the γ(OH) and ν(OH) peaks are hidden by the background and thus whether ethanol reacts to form an ethoxy species. The center of the TPD peak for monolayer molecular desorption of ethanol occurs at about 226 K on Pt(1 1 1) and at 230 K on PtNiPt(1 1 1) ( Fig. 4 a). This is consistent with the HREELS results in Fig. 6 , Fig. 7 a, which show that heating the surfaces to 300 K leads to the disappearance of the vibrational features related to ethanol. Overall, no stable surface intermediate other than adsorbed CO was observed on Pt(1 1 1) and PtNiPt(1 1 1) during the decomposition of ethanol.
The NiPtPt(1 1 1) and Ni(1 1 1) film surfaces display several differences from Pt(1 1 1) and PtNiPt(1 1 1). By 200 K the HREEL spectra indicate the presence of an ethoxy intermediate on both surfaces, as indicated by the absence of the γ(OH) and ν(OH) peaks and changes in the relative intensities of the 880, 810 and 1050 cm1 peaks. The HREEL spectrum at 300 K on NiPtPt(1 1 1) reveals the presence of adsorbed CO and vibrational modes due to the CxHy decomposition fragments, although these features are poorly resolved from the background and could not be assigned to a specific intermediate. This is in contrast to results on PtNiPt(1 1 1) and Pt(1 1 1), where vibrational modes other than adsorbed CO were not observed. This is consistent with TPD studies that show increased decomposition of ethanol on NiPtPt(1 1 1), as indicated by the higher H2 peak area in Fig. 4 b [3] . The presence of intermediates at 300 K is more clearly observed on Ni(1 1 1) film, with vibrational modes attributed to ethoxy species still present, indicating that this species is stable up to 300 K and completely decomposes to form CO only after heating to higher temperature. Although the detection of modes at 950 and 1120 cm1 indicates the presence of intermediates from the decomposition of ethoxy, it is difficult to conclusively assign these features because ν(CC), ν(CO) and δ(CHx) modes all contribute to this frequency range. In the current study we attribute these features to CxHy fragments from the decomposition of ethoxy. More detailed experimental studies using isotope-labeled ethanol, together with theoretical modeling, would be needed for the more definitive assignment of these features.
4.2. Reaction of ethylene glycol
Similar to results for ethanol, previous TPD studies of ethylene glycol on Ni/Pt(1 1 1) bimetallic surfaces [3] have shown the following trend in terms of reforming activity: NiPtPt(1 1 1) > Ni(1 1 1) film > Pt(1 1 1) > PtNiPt(1 1 1). The reforming activity displays a nearly linear correlation with the surface d-band center of these surfaces. DFT calculations of binding energies ethylene glycol and its decomposition intermediates in Fig. 1 follow a similar trend, with the highest binding energies on NiPtPt(1 1 1).
The HREELS results provide additional understanding of the decomposition sequence of ethylene glycol on the different surfaces. On all four surfaces, ethylene glycol adsorbs molecularly at 200 K, with the OH bond intact as shown by the presence of the ν(OH) mode at 3300 cm1 and τ(OH) at 700 cm1. On Pt(1 1 1) and PtNiPt(1 1 1), ethylene glycol begins to decompose or desorb by 225 K, as indicated by the decrease in the intensity of the ν(OH) and τ(OH) peaks. The vibrational features of ethylene glycol disappear after the surfaces are heated to 300 K. Overall, the HREELS results are consistent with the TPD results in Fig. 4 a, where the desorption peaks of multilayer and monolayer ethylene glycol are centered at about 227 and 257266 K, respectively.
In contrast, on NiPtPt(1 1 1) and Ni(1 1 1) film surfaces OH bond scission is complete by 225 K. On NiPtPt(1 1 1) heating to 225 K leads to the disappearance of the τ(OH) mode at 680 cm1. The analysis of the ν(OH) peak at 3290 cm1 is more complicated due to the presence of hydroxyl groups on the surface which appear at 3600 cm1. The OH groups are formed from water adsorbed from the UHV background. Separate experiments (not shown) show that NiPtPt(1 1 1) is very active for water dissociation. Despite the presence of the OH groups which obscure the ν(OH) mode somewhat, the ν(OH) at 3270 cm1 mode at the very least decreases in intensity. The same behavior can be seen more clearly on the Ni(1 1 1) film. Both the ν(OH) and τ(OH) peaks disappear completely by 225 K, indicating complete OH bond scission. During the initial OH bond scission, the rest of the molecule remains unchanged, as no changes in the vibrational frequencies are observed in the other modes between the 200 and 225 K spectra. These observations suggest that the surface intermediate is most likely an ethylenedioxy intermediate (OCH2CH2O), with the following vibrational assignments as summarized in Table 3 : 845 cm1, ν(CC); 870 cm1, ρr(CH2); 1035 cm1, νs(CO); 1225 cm1, ρt(CH2); 1345 cm1, ρw(CH2); 1450 cm1, δ(CH2); and 2930 cm1, νas(CH). These assignments are in agreement with literature studies of the ethylenedioxy intermediate on Ag(1 1 0) [20] , Mo(1 1 0) [22] , and reference spectra of K2[OCH2CH2O] [35] . Overall, the HREELS results are in agreement with DFT predictions, indicating that NiPtPt(1 1 1) and Ni(1 1 1) film surfaces react more strongly with adsorbed ethylene glycol compared to Pt(1 1 1) and PtNiPt(1 1 1). They are also consistent with TPD results in Fig. 4 a that show decreased monolayer molecular desorption peaks on NiPtPt(1 1 1) and Ni(1 1 1) film compared to Pt(1 1 1) and PtNiPt(1 1 1).

The HREELS results also provide useful information about the subsequent dissociation of the (OCH2CH2O) intermediate on NiPtPt(1 1 1) and Ni(1 1 1) film. On both surfaces the CH bond scission occurs at 250 K, as indicated by the decrease in the relative intensity of the δ(CH2) modes at 1450 cm1, while the relative intensity of the ν(CC) mode at 865 cm1 remains unchanged. However, CH bond cleavage is not complete, with the ν(CH) mode still present at 2920 cm1. With further heating to 300 K, the CC bond remains intact on NiPtPt(1 1 1) and Ni(1 1 1) film. After heating to 400 K the surface intermediate decomposes to form CO on the surface.
Overall, the HREELS results demonstrate that ethylene glycol reacts readily on NiPtPt(1 1 1) and Ni(1 1 1) film through OH bond cleavage. TPD results indicate that the reforming yield decreases as NiPtPt(1 1 1) > Ni(1 1 1) film > Pt(1 1 1) > PtNiPt(1 1 1). Combining these two results suggests that the initial OH bond scission of ethylene glycol is kinetically important and leads to increased overall yields. Furthermore, the increased OH scission activity on NiPtPt(1 1 1) and Ni(1 1 1) film can be correlated with the increased binding energies of adsorbates, such as ethanol, ethoxy, and ethylene glycol, on these surfaces. Previous studies of aqueous-phase reforming of ethylene glycol over supported Pt catalysts have also identified the initial dehydrogenation step as kinetically important, as opposed to the CC bond scission step [36] . This suggests that surfaces that are more active toward the initial OH bond scission should be promising catalysts for oxygenate reforming.
5. Conclusions
The following conclusions can be drawn regarding the reactions of ethanol and ethylene glycol on Pt(1 1 1), Ni(1 1 1) film and Ni/Pt(1 1 1) bimetallic surfaces:(1) DFT calculations have predicted increased binding energies of ethanol, ethoxy and species derived from ethylene glycol on the surface monolayer NiPtPt(1 1 1) as compared to subsurface monolayer PtNiPt(1 1 1) and clean Pt(1 1 1). The observed trend of increasing binding energy as the surface d-band center shifts closer to the Fermi level is consistent with previous results for other adsorbates.
(2) HREELS measurements have identified some of the decomposition sequence of ethanol and ethylene glycol. Ethanol adsorbs molecularly at 120 K with the OH bond intact on Pt(1 1 1) and PtNiPt(1 1 1), while dissociative adsorption is observed on NiPtPt(1 1 1) and Ni(1 1 1) film. On NiPtPt(1 1 1) and Ni(1 1 1) film ethanol reacts through initial OH bond scission to form ethoxy species, which dehydrogenate further to form adsorbed CO.
(3) Ethylene glycol adsorbs molecularly with the OH bond intact on all four surfaces at 200 K. Ethylene glycol undergoes primarily reversible desorption from the Pt(1 1 1) and PtNiPt(1 1 1) surfaces. In contrast, on NiPtPt(1 1 1) and Ni(1 1 1) film surfaces the initial decomposition proceeds through OH bond cleavage, forming a (OCH2CH2O) intermediate. This is followed by further dehydrogenation and CC bond scission to eventually form adsorbed CO.
(4) Combining the results from the DFT, TPD, and HREELS studies, the initial OH bond scission is identified as kinetically important for reforming of oxygenates on Pt-based surfaces. This explains the increased activity of NiPtPt(1 1 1) over Pt(1 1 1). Furthermore, this suggests that surfaces with increased rates of initial OH bond cleavage should be good potential catalysts for oxygenate reforming.
