          The AES ratio is normalized based on AES ratios measured during the formation of the clean Pt-Ni-Pt(111) surface, where 1 corresponds to the AES ratio after initial deposition of Ni at 300 K to form the Ni-Pt-Pt(111) surface, and 0 corresponds to the AES ratio after heating to 600 K to form the Pt-Ni-Pt(111) surface. The Ni/Pt AES ratio increased with oxygen exposure to the Pt-Ni-Pt(111) surface, indicating that subsurface Ni atoms started to segregate to the surface due to the strong interaction of the atomic oxygen adsorbate with surface Ni atoms. This confirms the DFT prediction that the surface Ni-Pt-Pt(111) configuration is thermodynamically preferred with adsorbed oxygen.
          Using the experimental data in Fig. 8 for Ni/Pt(111) and a similar set of data for Co/Pt(111) [39], the activation barrier was estimated experimentally based on the time required for one-half of the subsurface 3d atoms to segregate to the surface. The activation barrier for the segregation of subsurface Ni to the surface in oxygen was 15 kcal/mol, compared to 7 kcal/mol for Co [39].
          The remainder of the 3d/Pt(111) bimetallic systems are expected to follow this trend, and based on the shift in the d-band center the activation barriers for diffusion are expected to further decrease for other 3d/Pt(111) bimetallic surfaces.

          Experimental techniques such as HREELS and AES have been used to verify and quantify the oxygen-induced surface segregation of subsurface 3d atoms, particularly Ni and Co, in Pt-3d-Pt(111) bimetallic systems. The AES ratio, normalized based on ratios measured during the formation of the clean Pt-Ni-Pt(111) surface, showed an increase with oxygen exposure to the Pt-Ni-Pt(111) surface, indicating that subsurface Ni atoms started to segregate to the surface due to the strong interaction of the atomic oxygen adsorbate with surface Ni atoms. This confirms the DFT prediction that the surface Ni-Pt-Pt(111) configuration is thermodynamically preferred with adsorbed oxygen. The measured segregation kinetics and activation barriers for Ni and Co were compared with DFT predictions, showing that the activation barrier for the segregation of subsurface Ni to the surface in oxygen was 15 kcal/mol, compared to 7 kcal/mol for Co. The activation barriers for diffusion are expected to further decrease for other 3d/Pt(111) bimetallic surfaces based on the shift in the d-band center.

          实验技术，如HREELS和AES，已被用来验证和量化Pt-3d-Pt(111)双金属系统中，特别是Ni和Co的次表面3d原子的氧诱导表面分层。基于在清洁Pt-Ni-Pt(111)表面形成过程中测量的比率，AES比率随着Pt-Ni-Pt(111)表面的氧暴露而增加，表明次表面Ni原子开始由于表面Ni原子与原子氧吸附物的强烈相互作用而分层到表面。测量的Ni和Co的分层动力学和活化势垒与DFT预测进行了比较，显示次表面Ni在氧中的表面分层的活化势垒为15 kcal/mol，而Co为7 kcal/mol。根据d带中心的移动，其他3d/Pt(111)双金属表面的扩散活化势垒预计将进一步降低。
