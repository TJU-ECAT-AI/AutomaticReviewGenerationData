The AES ratio is normalized based on AES ratios measured during the formation of the clean Pt-Ni-Pt(111) surface, where 1 corresponds to the AES ratio after initial deposition of Ni at 300 K to form the Ni-Pt-Pt(111) surface, and 0 corresponds to the AES ratio after heating to 600 K to form the Pt-Ni-Pt(111) surface. The Ni/Pt AES ratio increased with oxygen exposure to the Pt-Ni-Pt(111) surface, indicating that subsurface Ni atoms started to segregate to the surface due to the strong interaction of the atomic oxygen adsorbate with surface Ni atoms. This confirms the DFT prediction that the surface Ni-Pt-Pt(111) configuration is thermodynamically preferred with adsorbed oxygen.
          Using the experimental data in Fig. 8 for Ni/Pt(111) and a similar set of data for Co/Pt(111) [39], the activation barrier was estimated experimentally based on the time required for one-half of the subsurface 3d atoms to segregate to the surface. The activation barrier for the segregation of subsurface Ni to the surface in oxygen was 15 kcal/mol, compared to 7 kcal/mol for Co [39].
          The remainder of the 3d/Pt(111) bimetallic systems are expected to follow this trend, and based on the shift in the d-band center the activation barriers for diffusion are expected to further decrease for other 3d/Pt(111) bimetallic surfaces.

AES and HREELS confirmed the trend predicted by DFT modeling and showed that both the PtNiPt(111) and PtCoPt(111) surface structures were unstable in the presence of adsorbed oxygen.
          The activation barrier of the segregation of surbsurface Ni and Co atoms was determined to be 15  2 and 7  1 kcal/mol, respectively.
          The DFT results in Figure 1 predict that all other Pt3d bimetallic alloys should undergo similar structural transformation, from Pt3dPt to 3dPtPt, leading to a gradual reduction of the ORR activity due to the stronger Ometal bonds on the 3dPtPt surfaces.
