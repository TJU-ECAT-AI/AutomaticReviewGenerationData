Experimental techniques such as HREELS and AES have been used to verify and quantify the oxygen-induced surface segregation of subsurface 3d atoms, particularly Ni and Co, in Pt-3d-Pt(111) bimetallic systems. The AES ratio, normalized based on ratios measured during the formation of the clean Pt-Ni-Pt(111) surface, showed an increase with oxygen exposure to the Pt-Ni-Pt(111) surface, indicating that subsurface Ni atoms started to segregate to the surface due to the strong interaction of the atomic oxygen adsorbate with surface Ni atoms. This confirms the DFT prediction that the surface Ni-Pt-Pt(111) configuration is thermodynamically preferred with adsorbed oxygen. The measured segregation kinetics and activation barriers for Ni and Co were compared with DFT predictions, showing that the activation barrier for the segregation of subsurface Ni to the surface in oxygen was 15 kcal/mol, compared to 7 kcal/mol for Co. The activation barriers for diffusion are expected to further decrease for other 3d/Pt(111) bimetallic surfaces based on the shift in the d-band center.

Experimental techniques such as HREELS and AES have been used to verify the oxygen-induced surface segregation of subsurface 3d atoms, particularly Ni and Co, in Pt-3d-Pt(111) bimetallic systems. These techniques confirmed the instability of the PtNiPt(111) and PtCoPt(111) surface structures in the presence of adsorbed oxygen, aligning with the predictions made by DFT modeling. The measured activation barriers for the segregation of subsurface Ni and Co atoms were determined to be 15 ± 2 and 7 ± 1 kcal/mol, respectively. These values are consistent with the DFT predictions that suggest a general trend in the stability and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activity of Pt3d bimetallic cathode electrocatalysts, indicating a gradual reduction of ORR activity due to the stronger oxygen-metal bonds on the 3dPtPt surfaces.

High-resolution electron energy loss spectroscopy (HREELS) has been used to monitor the segregation of Ni and Co in the Pt3dPt(111) subsurface configurations when exposed to oxygen. The onset of the characteristic vibrational modes of NiO and CoO confirms the segregation of subsurface Ni and Co after exposing the subsurface Pt3dPt(111) configuration to oxygen at different temperatures. AES measurements were performed to quantify the segregation kinetics, using the AES intensity ratios of Co/Pt or Ni/Pt to monitor the interchange between the subsurface and surface structures after exposure to oxygen. Using an Arrhenius equation to analyze the data, the activation barrier for the oxygen-induced segregation of Co and Ni is estimated to be 7  1 and 15  2 kcal/mol, respectively. This follows the trend predicted by DFT, where Ni is predicted to have the smaller driving potential for segregation compared to Co and should correspondingly have a higher activation barrier.
