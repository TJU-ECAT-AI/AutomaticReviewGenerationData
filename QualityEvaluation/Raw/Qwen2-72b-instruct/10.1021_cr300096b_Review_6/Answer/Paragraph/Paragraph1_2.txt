                The utilization of high-resolution electron energy loss spectroscopy (HREELS) and Auger electron spectroscopy (AES) has been pivotal in verifying and quantifying the oxygen-induced surface segregation of subsurface 3d atoms, notably Ni and Co, in Pt-3d-Pt(111) bimetallic systems \[10.1007/s11244-008-9119-7\]. The AES ratio, normalized based on ratios measured during the formation of the clean Pt-Ni-Pt(111) surface, showed an increase with oxygen exposure to the Pt-Ni-Pt(111) surface, indicating that subsurface Ni atoms started to segregate to the surface due to the strong interaction of the atomic oxygen adsorbate with surface Ni atoms. This confirms the DFT prediction that the surface Ni-Pt-Pt(111) configuration is thermodynamically preferred with adsorbed oxygen \[10.1007/s11244-008-9119-7\]. The measured segregation kinetics and activation barriers for Ni and Co were compared with DFT predictions, showing that the activation barrier for the segregation of subsurface Ni to the surface in oxygen was 15 kcal/mol, compared to 7 kcal/mol for Co \[10.1007/s11244-008-9119-7\]. The activation barriers for diffusion are expected to further decrease for other 3d/Pt(111) bimetallic surfaces based on the shift in the d-band center \[10.1007/s11244-008-9119-7\]. These experimental findings align with the predictions made by DFT modeling, confirming the instability of the PtNiPt(111) and PtCoPt(111) surface structures in the presence of adsorbed oxygen \[10.1021/jp061697z\]. The measured activation barriers for the segregation of subsurface Ni and Co atoms were determined to be 15 ± 2 and 7 ± 1 kcal/mol, respectively, which are consistent with the DFT predictions suggesting a general trend in the stability and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activity of Pt3d bimetallic cathode electrocatalysts \[10.1021/jp061697z\].

                Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: The advancements in experimental techniques such as HREELS and AES, coupled with DFT predictions, have significantly enhanced our understanding of oxygen-induced surface segregation in Pt-3d-Pt(111) bimetallic systems. These findings not only validate the theoretical predictions but also open up new avenues for the design of more efficient propane dehydrogenation catalysts. Future research efforts might focus on the development of novel bimetallic systems with optimized d-band centers to further reduce the activation barriers for diffusion and enhance the stability and activity of the catalysts. Additionally, the exploration of alternative experimental methods to complement HREELS and AES could provide a more comprehensive understanding of the segregation kinetics and mechanisms. The integration of machine learning algorithms with DFT calculations could also offer a promising approach to predict the behavior of a wider range of bimetallic systems, potentially leading to the discovery of new catalysts with superior performance.

                高分辨率电子能量损失光谱（HREELS）和俄歇电子能谱（AES）的使用对于验证和量化Pt-3d-Pt(111)双金属系统中，特别是Ni和Co的次表面3d原子的氧诱导表面分层至关重要\[10.1007/s11244-008-9119-7\]。AES比率，基于在清洁Pt-Ni-Pt(111)表面形成过程中测量的比率进行标准化，随着Pt-Ni-Pt(111)表面暴露于氧气而增加，表明次表面Ni原子开始向表面分层，这是由于表面Ni原子与吸附氧吸附物之间的强相互作用。这证实了DFT预测，即吸附氧的表面Ni-Pt-Pt(111)配置在热力学上是优选的\[10.1007/s11244-008-9119-7\]。Ni和Co的测量分层动力学和活化势垒与DFT预测进行了比较，显示次表面Ni在氧气中的表面分层的活化势垒为15 kcal/mol，而Co为7 kcal/mol\[10.1007/s11244-008-9119-7\]。根据d带中心的移动，其他3d/Pt(111)双金属表面的扩散活化势垒预计将进一步降低\[10.1007/s11244-008-9119-7\]。这些实验发现与DFT建模的预测一致，确认了在吸附氧存在下PtNiPt(111)和PtCoPt(111)表面结构的不稳定性\[10.1021/jp061697z\]。次表面Ni和Co原子的分层的测量活化势垒分别确定为15 ± 2和7 ± 1 kcal/mol，这与DFT预测一致，表明Pt3d双金属阴极电催化剂的稳定性趋势和氧还原反应（ORR）活性\[10.1021/jp061697z\]。
