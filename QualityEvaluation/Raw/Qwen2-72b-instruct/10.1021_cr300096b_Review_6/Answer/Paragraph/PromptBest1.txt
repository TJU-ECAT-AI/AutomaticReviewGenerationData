The experimental verification and quantification of oxygen-induced surface segregation of subsurface 3d atoms (Ni and Co) in Pt-3d-Pt(111) bimetallic systems have been extensively studied using HREELS and AES techniques \[10.1007/s11244-008-9119-7\]. The AES ratio, normalized based on the formation of the clean Pt-Ni-Pt(111) surface, revealed an increase with oxygen exposure, indicating subsurface Ni atoms' segregation to the surface due to the strong interaction with atomic oxygen adsorbate \[10.1007/s11244-008-9119-7\]. This finding corroborates DFT predictions, confirming the thermodynamic preference of the surface Ni-Pt-Pt(111) configuration with adsorbed oxygen \[10.1007/s11244-008-9119-7\]. The measured segregation kinetics and activation barriers for Ni and Co were compared with DFT predictions, revealing that the activation barrier for subsurface Ni segregation in oxygen was 15 kcal/mol, whereas for Co, it was 7 kcal/mol \[10.1007/s11244-008-9119-7\]. The activation barriers for diffusion are anticipated to decrease further for other 3d/Pt(111) bimetallic surfaces based on the d-band center shift \[10.1007/s11244-008-9119-7\].
                ※※※
                Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: The insights gained from the experimental and theoretical studies on oxygen-induced surface segregation in Pt-3d-Pt(111) bimetallic systems open avenues for the design of advanced propane dehydrogenation catalysts. Future research might focus on the development of novel bimetallic systems that can mitigate the negative effects of oxygen-induced segregation, potentially by engineering the d-band center to optimize the activation barriers for diffusion. Moreover, the exploration of alternative experimental techniques that can provide real-time monitoring of surface segregation under reaction conditions could offer deeper insights into the dynamic behavior of these catalysts. The integration of machine learning algorithms with DFT calculations could also accelerate the discovery of new catalysts with tailored properties for enhanced stability and activity in propane dehydrogenation.

The utilization of high-resolution electron energy loss spectroscopy (HREELS) and Auger electron spectroscopy (AES) has been pivotal in verifying and quantifying the oxygen-induced surface segregation of subsurface 3d atoms, notably Ni and Co, in Pt-3d-Pt(111) bimetallic systems \[10.1007/s11244-008-9119-7\].
