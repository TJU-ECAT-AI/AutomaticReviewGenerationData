The experimental verification and quantification of oxygen-induced surface segregation of subsurface 3d atoms, specifically Ni and Co, in Pt-3d-Pt(111) bimetallic systems, is a complex yet crucial area of study in surface science. This investigation employs a range of advanced methods, including low-energy electron diffraction (LEED), scanning tunneling microscopy (STM), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), to monitor the structural changes and chemical composition of the surface as a function of oxygen exposure. The kinetics of the segregation process are determined by analyzing the time-dependent changes in the surface composition, revealing the activation energies and reaction rates. Comparisons with density functional theory (DFT) predictions provide insights into the underlying mechanisms, allowing for a deeper understanding of the interplay between surface structure, chemical composition, and reactivity in these bimetallic systems. This research not only validates theoretical models but also contributes to the development of more efficient catalysts for various industrial processes.
