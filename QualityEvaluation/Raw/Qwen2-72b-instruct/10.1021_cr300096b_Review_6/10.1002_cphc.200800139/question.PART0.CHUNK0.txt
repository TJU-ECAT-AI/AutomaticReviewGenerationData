Rational Design of Platinum-Based Bimetallic Catalysts with Enhanced Hydrogenation Activity Michael P. Humbert, Luis E. Murillo, and Jingguang G. Chen*[a] Catalytic hydrogenation reactions are among the most com- monly practiced catalytic processes, including common steps in organic synthesis, batch processes in pharmaceutical pro- duction, stabilization of edible oils, and petroleum upgrading processes. One of the key challenges is to identify the struc- tureproperty relationship for the design of catalysts with de- sirable hydrogenation activity and selectivity. Herein, we dem- onstrate the possibility to promote hydrogenation activity by using two probe reactions, namely, low-temperature hydroge- nation of the C=C bond in cyclohexene and hydrogenation of the C=O bond in acrolein (CH2=CHCH=O).
In principle, the hydrogenation activity is related to the binding strength and bonding orientation of the unsaturated bond on the catalyst surface, both of which can be varied by modifying the electronic properties of the catalysts through the formation of bimetallic alloys. It is well known that many bimetallic catalysts possess catalytic properties that are dis- tinctly different from those of their parent metals.[15] In many cases, these unique properties result in activities and/or selec- tivities that exceed those achievable with a monometallic cata- lyst. The unique catalytic properties have led to many funda- mental studies on well-defined single-crystal bimetallic surfa- ces. It is now generally accepted that there are two critical fac- tors that contribute to the modification of the electronic and chemical properties of a metal in a bimetallic surface. First, the formation of the heterometallic bonds changes the electronic environment of the metal surface, thus giving rise to modifica- tions of its electronic structure through the ligand effect.
Second, the metalmetal bond length is typically different from that of the parent metal, which results in a strain effect that is known to modify the electronic structure of the metal through changes in orbital overlap.[6,7] One commonly used pa- rameter to measure changes in the electronic properties is the position of the surface d-band center with respect to the Fermi level. As this parameter has been shown to strongly cor- relate with the ability of the bimetallic surface to bind with ad- sorbates, such as atomic hydrogen and oxygen[6] and small al- kenes,[5] the value of the surface d-band center may enable first-principles predictions of bimetallic surfaces that provide optimal binding strength and orientation to facilitate hydroge- nation reactions.
Recent experimental and density functional theory (DFT) studies of PtNi bimetallic surfaces have provided a direct cor- relation between the value of the surface d-band center and the binding energy of atomic hydrogen and alkenes. The dep- osition of Ni onto PtACHTUNGTRENUNG(111) at room temperature leads to Ni atoms remaining on the surface, thus producing an overlayer structure of the form NiPtPtACHTUNGTRENUNG(111). An increase in the deposi- tion temperature to 600 K allows the Ni atoms to diffuse to the subsurface, thereby producing a sandwich structure, namely, PtNiPtACHTUNGTRENUNG(111). Both experiments and DFT calculations have shown that the location of the Ni atoms leads to very different electronic and chemical properties of NiPtPtACHTUNGTRENUNG(111) and PtNiPtACHTUNGTRENUNG(111) surfaces.[8] The presence of surface Ni atoms moves the surface d-band center closer to the Fermi level rela- tive to either PtACHTUNGTRENUNG(111) or NiACHTUNGTRENUNG(111), which leads to stronger bind- ing energies of atomic hydrogen and alkenes on the NiPtPtACHTUNGTRENUNG(111) surface. In comparison, the presence of subsur- face Ni atoms in the PtNiPtACHTUNGTRENUNG(111) bimetallic structure shifts the d-band center away from the Fermi level, thus resulting in weaker binding energies, which are responsible for a novel low-temperature hydrogenation pathway that is not present on PtACHTUNGTRENUNG(111) or NiACHTUNGTRENUNG(111).
Our main objectives are twofold. First, we compare two other 3d metals, namely Fe and Co, with Ni/PtACHTUNGTRENUNG(111) to deter- mine whether there is a general trend in controlling the bind- ing energies of cyclohexene and acrolein on the surface 3dPtPtACHTUNGTRENUNG(111) and subsurface Pt3dPtACHTUNGTRENUNG(111) structures. Second,we use these bimetallic surfaces as model systems to deter- mine how the hydrogenation activity is related to the value of the surface d-band center on the various bimetallic surfaces.
These questions are answered though combined experimental and theoretical studies.
Figure 1 shows the DFT results of cyclohexene binding on the 3dPtPtACHTUNGTRENUNG(111) and Pt3dPtACHTUNGTRENUNG(111) surfaces in the presence of co-adsorbed atomic hydrogen to mimic the hydrogenation conditions. The trends illustrate that the binding energy de- creases as the surface d-band center moves away from the Fermi level. Two separate linear lines are observed (one for sur- faces terminated by Pt and the other for surfaces terminated by 3d metals), which have been seen for the binding of other adsorbates and attributed to different degrees of coupling of adsorbates with 5d and 3d surface metals.[9] For a given bimet- allic system, the binding energy of cyclohexene always follows the trend of Pt3dPtACHTUNGTRENUNG(111)<PtACHTUNGTRENUNG(111)<3dPtPtACHTUNGTRENUNG(111). A similar trend is observed in the DFT calculations of the binding energy of atomic hydrogen on the bimetallic surfaces. This trend is verified experimentally by means of temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) experiments.[10] The most important conclu- sion from Figure 1 is that the d-band center valuesand therefore the binding energiescan be controlled by the for- mation of subsurface and surface bimetallic structures.

KGaA, Weinheim ChemPhysChem 2008, 9, 1262  1264 Because both cyclohexene and atomic hydrogen are more weakly bonded on PtNiPtACHTUNGTRENUNG(111) than on NiPtPtACHTUNGTRENUNG(111), one might expect that the subsurface structure should be more ef- fective in the hydrogenation of cyclohexene than the surface structure. This is confirmed experimentally in Figure 2, which shows the hydrogenation of cyclohexene with preadsorbed hy- drogen on these two surfaces. The results obtained from PtACHTUNGTRENUNG(111) and a NiACHTUNGTRENUNG(111) film are also included for comparison. The hydrogenation yield, which is based on the peak areas of cy- clohexane (84 amu), is much higher on PtNiPtACHTUNGTRENUNG(111) than on NiPtPtACHTUNGTRENUNG(111), PtACHTUNGTRENUNG(111), or NiACHTUNGTRENUNG(111).The general trend of the DFT calculations (see Figure 1) also shows that the binding energies of cyclohexene on PtCoPtACHTUNGTRENUNG(111) and PtFePtACHTUNGTRENUNG(111) are weaker than that on PtNiPtACHTUNGTRENUNG(111). Although the weaker binding energy of cyclo- hexene might favor hydrogenation, the adsorption of cyclo- hexene needs to be strong enough for this process to occur.One would therefore expect to observe a volcano-type rela- tionship for the hydrogenation activity as the d-band center moves further away from the Fermi level, that is, when the ad- sorption of cyclohexene is too weak for the hydrogenation to occur. This is verified experimentally by comparing the top four TPD spectra in Figure 2. The hydrogenation yield is the highest on PtNiPtACHTUNGTRENUNG(111), but starts to decrease on the PtCoPtACHTUNGTRENUNG(111) and PtFePtACHTUNGTRENUNG(111) surfaces. Another comparison is the absence of hydrogenation activity on the monolayer PtWACHTUNGTRENUNG(110) surface,[11] which has the d-band center even further away from the Fermi level than PtFePtACHTUNGTRENUNG(111). The volcano-type relationship is more clearly illustrated in Figure 3, where the hydrogenation yield is compared (as a function of the d-band center) for various Pt- based bimetallic surfaces. The hydrogenation activity is maxi- mized on the PtNiPtACHTUNGTRENUNG(111) subsurface structure, which indi- cates that the value of the d-band center on this surface corre- sponds to a cyclohexene binding energy that is optimal for hy- drogenation.A similar volcano-type relationship is also observed for the hydrogenation of the C=O bond of acrolein (see Figure 4). Re- cently, Murillo et al. performed DFT and experimental studies of the hydrogenation of acrolein on the subsurface PtNiPtACHTUNGTRENUNG(111) and surface NiPtPtACHTUNGTRENUNG(111) structures.[12] Selective hydrogenation of the C=O bond to produce 2-propenol (CH2=CHCH2OH) occurs on PtNiPtACHTUNGTRENUNG(111) as a result of the comparable binding strengths of the di-s CC and di-s CO bonding configurations, with the latter favoring the C=O hy- drogenation pathway. In contrast, the di-s CC bonding is pre- ferred over di-s CO on NiPtPtACHTUNGTRENUNG(111) and PtACHTUNGTRENUNG(111), which pre- Figure 2.

KGaA, Weinheim www.chemphyschem.org 1263 vents the hydrogenation of the C=O bond on the two surfaces.As the d-band center moves away from the Fermi level, one would expect the di-s CC binding energy to decrease, thus leading to the onset of a C=O hydrogenation pathway such as that ob- served on PtNiPtACHTUNGTRENUNG(111). On the other hand, the shift in the d-band center would also reduce the di-s CO binding energy and would likely make it too weak for hydrogenation to occur when the d-band center is too far away from the Fermi level. A balance between the strengths of these two bonding configu- rations would lead to a volcano-type relationship for the pro- duction of 2-propenol, as confirmed in Figure 4.In conclusion, our results clearly indicate that the value of the d-band center can be varied by means of the formation of bimetallic surfaces, with the 3dPtPtACHTUNGTRENUNG(111) surface structures resulting in a shift closer to the Fermi level and the Pt3dPtACHTUNGTRENUNG(111) subsurface structures shifting in the opposite di- rection. The binding energies of unsaturated bonds, such as C=C and C=O, are related to the d-band center, with the sub- surface Pt3dPtACHTUNGTRENUNG(111) structures showing weaker binding energies that favor hydrogenation. Because the hydrogenation activity re- quires optimal binding energies between the unsaturated bonds and the surfaces, volcano-type relationships are ob- served for the hydrogenation of both the C=C bond in cyclo- hexene and the C=O bond in acrolein. Most importantly, the results demonstrate the possibility to predict bimetallic formu- lations and structures with desirable hydrogenation activity based on the value of the surface d-band center.Experimental and Theoretical Methods TPD studies were performed in a two-level stainless steel ultrahigh vacuum (UHV) chamber with a base pressure of 1H1010 Torr. Bi- metallic surfaces were prepared by depositing 3d metals on a PtACHTUNGTRENUNG(111) single-crystal substrate. Self-consistent periodic slab calcula- tions were performed by means of periodic density functional theory (DFT) using the code VASP (Vienna ab initio Simulation Package). Co-adsorbed acrolein and atomic hydrogen were studied using 3H3 super cells, with nine metal atoms in each layer and two hydrogen atoms and one cyclohexene molecule adsorbed per unit cell. The top two layers were allowed to relax.
