[1] "The AES ratio is normalized based on AES ratios measured during the formation of the clean Pt-Ni-Pt(111) surface, where 1 corresponds to the AES ratio after initial deposition of Ni at 300 K to form the Ni-Pt-Pt(111) surface, and 0 corresponds to the AES ratio after heating to 600 K to form the Pt-Ni-Pt(111) surface. The Ni/Pt AES ratio increased with oxygen exposure to the Pt-Ni-Pt(111) surface, indicating that subsurface Ni atoms started to segregate to the surface due to the strong interaction of the atomic oxygen adsorbate with surface Ni atoms. This confirms the DFT prediction that the surface Ni-Pt-Pt(111) configuration is thermodynamically preferred with adsorbed oxygen."
[2] "Using the experimental data in Fig. 8 for Ni/Pt(111) and a similar set of data for Co/Pt(111) [39], the activation barrier was estimated experimentally based on the time required for one-half of the subsurface 3d atoms to segregate to the surface. The activation barrier for the segregation of subsurface Ni to the surface in oxygen was 15 kcal/mol, compared to 7 kcal/mol for Co [39]."

1.Experimental techniques such as HREELS and AES have been used to verify and quantify the oxygen-induced surface segregation of subsurface 3d atoms, particularly Ni and Co, in Pt-3d-Pt(111) bimetallic systems. The AES ratio, normalized based on the formation of the clean Pt-Ni-Pt(111) surface, showed an increase with oxygen exposure, indicating that subsurface Ni atoms started to segregate to the surface due to the strong interaction of atomic oxygen with surface Ni atoms. This confirms the DFT prediction that the surface Ni-Pt-Pt(111) configuration is thermodynamically preferred with adsorbed oxygen. The measured activation barrier for the segregation of subsurface Ni to the surface in oxygen was 15 kcal/mol, which is higher than the 7 kcal/mol barrier for Co, indicating a higher stability of the Ni-Pt-Pt(111) surface under oxygen exposure.

1.实验技术如HREELS和AES已被用于验证和量化Pt-3d-Pt(111)双金属系统中，特别是Ni和Co的次表面3d原子的氧诱导表面分层。AES比率，基于清洁Pt-Ni-Pt(111)表面的形成进行标准化，显示随着氧气暴露的增加而增加，表明次表面Ni原子开始由于表面Ni原子与原子氧的强烈相互作用而分层到表面。这证实了DFT预测，即在吸附氧的情况下，表面Ni-Pt-Pt(111)配置在热力学上是优选的。在氧气中，次表面Ni向表面分层的测量活化能为15 kcal/mol，这比Co的7 kcal/mol活化能更高，表明在氧气暴露下Ni-Pt-Pt(111)表面的稳定性更高。
