[1] "The AES ratio is normalized based on AES ratios measured during the formation of the clean Pt-Ni-Pt(111) surface, where 1 corresponds to the AES ratio after initial deposition of Ni at 300 K to form the Ni-Pt-Pt(111) surface, and 0 corresponds to the AES ratio after heating to 600 K to form the Pt-Ni-Pt(111) surface. The Ni/Pt AES ratio increased with oxygen exposure to the Pt-Ni-Pt(111) surface, indicating that subsurface Ni atoms started to segregate to the surface due to the strong interaction of the atomic oxygen adsorbate with surface Ni atoms. This confirms the DFT prediction that the surface Ni-Pt-Pt(111) configuration is thermodynamically preferred with adsorbed oxygen."
[2] "Using the experimental data in Fig. 8 for Ni/Pt(111) and a similar set of data for Co/Pt(111) [39], the activation barrier was estimated experimentally based on the time required for one-half of the subsurface 3d atoms to segregate to the surface. The activation barrier for the segregation of subsurface Ni to the surface in oxygen was 15 kcal/mol, compared to 7 kcal/mol for Co [39]."

1.Experimental techniques such as HREELS and AES have been used to verify and quantify the oxygen-induced surface segregation of subsurface 3d atoms, particularly Ni and Co, in Pt-3d-Pt(111) bimetallic systems. The AES ratio, normalized based on ratios measured during the formation of the clean Pt-Ni-Pt(111) surface, increased with oxygen exposure to the Pt-Ni-Pt(111) surface, indicating that subsurface Ni atoms started to segregate to the surface due to the strong interaction of the atomic oxygen adsorbate with surface Ni atoms. This confirms the DFT prediction that the surface Ni-Pt-Pt(111) configuration is thermodynamically preferred with adsorbed oxygen. The activation barrier for the segregation of subsurface Ni to the surface in oxygen was 15 kcal/mol, compared to 7 kcal/mol for Co.

1.实验技术如HREELS和AES已被用来验证和量化Pt-3d-Pt(111)双金属系统中次表面3d原子，特别是Ni和Co，在氧气诱导下的表面分层。AES比率，基于在清洁Pt-Ni-Pt(111)表面形成过程中测量的比率进行标准化，在Pt-Ni-Pt(111)表面的氧气暴露下增加，表明次表面Ni原子开始向表面分层，这是由于表面Ni原子与吸附的原子氧吸附物的强烈相互作用。这证实了DFT预测，即在吸附氧气的情况下，表面Ni-Pt-Pt(111)构型在热力学上是优选的。次表面Ni在氧气中的表面分层的活化能垒为15 kcal/mol，而Co则为7 kcal/mol。
