1.The alkyl mechanism in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions on gallium-based catalysts involves the activation of C-H bonds and the disposal of hydrogen atoms produced in these reactions. The initial rate of propene formation is much higher on Ga/H-ZSM5 and Zn/H-ZSM5 compared to H-ZSM5. Isotopic evidence from C3Hs/C3D 8 mixtures shows that C-H bond activation rate depends weakly on the presence of Ga and Zn. Reactions over Na-ZSM5 confirm that C-H bond activation occurs predominantly on BrOnsted acid sites. Ga and Zn sites increase the rate of propene formation by removing H-atoms from acid sites that activate C-H bonds, allowing acid sites to turnover without the formation of cracking products. Ga and Zn act as 'portholes' and catalyze the recombinative desorption of H-atoms, formed from acid-catalyzed C-H bond cleavage, as all-hydrogen (He). This removal of H-atoms by the recombinative desorption is highly desired in order to minimize unwanted by-products such as methane and ethane and to extract valuable H 2 with a high selectivity from light alkanes.
2.Comparing the alkyl mechanism to the carbenium mechanism, the alkyl mechanism is proposed as the rate-determining step (RDS) because it involves the activation of C-H bonds, which is a slow process. The carbenium mechanism, on the other hand, involves the addition of protons to alkenes to form a carbenium ion, which is a faster process. The alkyl mechanism applies to different Ga species structures, as it is the C-H bond activation step that is rate-determining, regardless of the structure of the Ga species.
3.The CH activation step is proposed as the rate-determining step (RDS) because it involves the activation of C-H bonds, which is a slow process. The activation of C-H bonds is a slow process because it requires the breaking of a strong C-H bond, which is energetically unfavorable. The activation of C-H bonds is also a slow process because it requires the formation of a new bond, which is also energetically unfavorable. The activation of C-H bonds is a slow process because it requires the formation of a new bond, which is also energetically unfavorable.

1.在基于镓的催化剂上的丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应中，烷基机制涉及C-H键的活化和在这些反应中产生的氢原子的处理。Ga/H-ZSM5和Zn/H-ZSM5上的丙烯初始形成速率比H-ZSM5高得多。来自C3Hs/C3D 8混合物的同位素证据表明，C-H键活化速率在很大程度上不依赖于镓和锌的存在。在Na-ZSM5上的反应证实，C-H键活化主要发生在布隆斯特酸位点。镓和锌位点通过从活化C-H键的酸位点去除氢原子来增加丙烯的形成速率，使酸位点在不形成裂解产物的情况下周转。镓和锌充当“港口”，催化由酸催化C-H键断裂形成的氢原子的重组脱附，作为所有氢(He)。通过重组脱附去除氢原子是高度期望的，以便最小化不需要的副产品，如甲烷和乙烷，并从轻烃中以高选择性提取有价值的H 2。
2.将烷基机制与卡宾机制进行比较，烷基机制被提议为速率决定步骤(RDS)，因为它涉及C-H键的活化，这是一个缓慢的过程。另一方面，卡宾机制涉及将质子添加到烯烃中以形成卡宾离子，这是一个更快的过程。无论镓物种的结构如何，烷基机制都适用于不同的镓物种结构，因为C-H键活化步骤是速率决定的，与镓物种的结构无关。
3.CH活化步骤被提议为速率决定步骤(RDS)，因为它涉及C-H键的活化，这是一个缓慢的过程。C-H键的活化是一个缓慢的过程，因为它需要断裂一个强的C-H键，这在能量上是不利的。C-H键的活化也是一个缓慢的过程，因为它需要形成一个新的键，这也是能量上不利的。C-H键的活化是一个缓慢的过程，因为它需要形成一个新的键，这也是能量上不利的。C-H键的活化是一个缓慢的过程，因为它需要形成一个新的键，这也是能量上不利的。
