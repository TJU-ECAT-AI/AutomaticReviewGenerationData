1.The alkyl mechanism in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions on gallium-based catalysts involves the activation of C-H bonds and the disposal of hydrogen atoms produced in these reactions. The initial rate of propene formation is much higher on Ga/H-ZSM5 and Zn/H-ZSM5 compared to H-ZSM5. Isotopic evidence from C3Hs/C3D 8 mixtures shows that C-H bond activation rate depends weakly on the presence of Ga and Zn. Reactions over Na-ZSM5 confirm that C-H bond activation occurs predominantly on BrOnsted acid sites. Ga and Zn sites increase the rate of propene formation by removing H-atoms from acid sites that activate C-H bonds, allowing acid sites to turnover without the formation of cracking products. Ga and Zn act as 'portholes' and catalyze the recombinative desorption of H-atoms, formed from acid-catalyzed C-H bond cleavage, as all-hydrogen (He). This removal of H-atoms by the recombinative desorption is highly desired in order to minimize unwanted by-products such as methane and ethane and to extract valuable H 2 with a high selectivity from light alkanes.
2.Comparing the alkyl mechanism to the carbenium mechanism, the alkyl mechanism is proposed as the rate-determining step (RDS) because it involves the activation of C-H bonds, which is a slow process. The carbenium mechanism, on the other hand, involves the addition of protons to alkenes to form a carbenium ion, which is a faster process. The alkyl mechanism applies to different Ga species structures, as it is the C-H bond activation step that is rate-determining, regardless of the structure of the Ga species.
3.The CH activation step is proposed as the rate-determining step (RDS) because it involves the activation of C-H bonds, which is a slow process. The activation of C-H bonds is a slow process because it requires the breaking of a strong C-H bond, which is energetically unfavorable. The activation of C-H bonds is also a slow process because it requires the formation of a new bond, which is also energetically unfavorable. The activation of C-H bonds is a slow process because it requires the formation of a new bond, which is also energetically unfavorable. The activation of C-H bonds is a slow process because it requires the formation of a new bond, which is also energetically unfavorable.

1.在基于镓的催化剂上的丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应中，烷基机制涉及C-H键的活化和在这些反应中产生的氢原子的处理。Ga/H-ZSM5和Zn/H-ZSM5上的丙烯初始形成速率比H-ZSM5高得多。来自C3Hs/C3D 8混合物的同位素证据表明，C-H键活化速率在很大程度上不依赖于镓和锌的存在。在Na-ZSM5上的反应证实，C-H键活化主要发生在布隆斯特酸位点。镓和锌位点通过从活化C-H键的酸位点去除氢原子来增加丙烯的形成速率，使酸位点在不形成裂解产物的情况下周转。镓和锌充当“港口”，催化由酸催化C-H键断裂形成的氢原子的重组脱附，作为所有氢(He)。通过重组脱附去除氢原子是高度期望的，以便最小化不需要的副产品，如甲烷和乙烷，并从轻烃中以高选择性提取有价值的H 2。
2.将烷基机制与卡宾机制进行比较，烷基机制被提议为速率决定步骤(RDS)，因为它涉及C-H键的活化，这是一个缓慢的过程。另一方面，卡宾机制涉及将质子添加到烯烃中以形成卡宾离子，这是一个更快的过程。无论镓物种的结构如何，烷基机制都适用于不同的镓物种结构，因为C-H键活化步骤是速率决定的，与镓物种的结构无关。
3.CH活化步骤被提议为速率决定步骤(RDS)，因为它涉及C-H键的活化，这是一个缓慢的过程。C-H键的活化是一个缓慢的过程，因为它需要断裂一个强的C-H键，这在能量上是不利的。C-H键的活化也是一个缓慢的过程，因为它需要形成一个新的键，这也是能量上不利的。C-H键的活化是一个缓慢的过程，因为它需要形成一个新的键，这也是能量上不利的。C-H键的活化是一个缓慢的过程，因为它需要形成一个新的键，这也是能量上不利的。

[11] "Hydrogen adsorption-desorption data are consistent with Ga K-edge X-ray absorption data, which show Ga 3 + forms during cooling of reduced samples to room temperature."
[12] "During catalytic reaction of propane at 673-773 K, Ga 3+ reduces to its active form (Ga 1+) in a process that occurs along with a significant increase in the rate of propane dehydrocy- clodimerization reactions."
[13] "The cationic Ga complexes in exchange sites at room temperature must be present with a + 1 charge, regardless of the formal oxidation state of the Ga atoms."
[14] "This is required by the need to balance the net negative charge of a single cation exchange site isolated by significant dis- tances from other exchange sites within zeolite channels."
[15] "This is likely to lead to the formation of species such as [GaO] +, where strongly bound oxygen atoms provide the required charge bal- ance for Ga 3+ ions exchanged during contact with Ga nitrate solution."

1.The alkyl mechanism in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions on gallium-based catalysts involves the activation of C-H bonds by BrOnsted acid sites, followed by the removal of hydrogen atoms by Ga species through recombinative desorption. The initial activation of propane occurs on BrOnsted acid sites, where C-H bonds are cleaved. Ga species, present as monomeric cations at exchange sites within zeolite channels, act as 'portholes' for the removal of hydrogen atoms formed during C-H bond activation. This removal of hydrogen atoms as dihydrogen (H2) is critical for the overall reaction rate and selectivity. The alkyl mechanism applies to different Ga species structures, including monomeric Ga or Ga1 compounds, which are stabilized by interactions with basic oxygens within ZSM5 channels. The carbenium mechanism, involving the activation of propane by hydride abstraction or proton addition to alkenes, is not supported by isotopic evidence. The CH activation step is proposed as the rate-determining step (RDS) because it is fast and quasi-equilibrated during steady-state propane dehydrocyclodimerization on H-ZSM5, Ga/H-ZSM5, and Zn/H-ZSM5. The alkyl mechanism, involving the concerted action of acid sites for C-H bond activation and metal cations for hydrogen desorption, is consistent with experimental observations and applies to different Ga species structures within zeolite channels.

1.在基于镓的催化剂上的丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应中,烷基机制涉及通过Bronsted酸位点激活C-H键,随后通过Ga物种通过重组脱附去除氢原子。初始丙烷的激活发生在Bronsted酸位点,其中C-H键被裂解。Ga物种,作为位于沸石通道内交换位点的单体阳离子存在,作为“端口”去除在C-H键激活过程中形成的氢原子。这种将氢原子作为二氢(H2)去除对于整体反应速率和选择性至关重要。烷基机制适用于不同的Ga物种结构,包括单体Ga或Ga1化合物,这些化合物通过与ZSM5通道内的基本氧原子的相互作用稳定。涉及通过氢化物抽吸或向烯烃添加质子激活丙烷的卡宾机制并未得到同位素证据的支持。CH激活步骤被提议为速率决定步骤(RDS),因为在H-ZSM5、Ga/H-ZSM5和Zn/H-ZSM5上稳态丙烷脱氢环二聚化期间,它快速且准平衡。涉及酸位点C-H键激活和金属阳离子氢脱附的协同作用的烷基机制与实验观察一致,并适用于沸石通道内不同的Ga物种结构。

1.Provide a comprehensive explanation of the alkyl mechanism in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions on gallium-based catalysts, detailing its key steps from initial propane activation to product formation. Compare this mechanism to the carbenium mechanism, discuss why the CH activation step is proposed as the rate-determining step (RDS), and explain how the alkyl mechanism applies to different Ga species structures.

The alkyl mechanism in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions on gallium-based catalysts involves several key steps from initial propane activation to product formation. The mechanism begins with the adsorption of propane on the catalyst surface, followed by the activation of a C-H bond through the formation of a Ga-alkyl intermediate. This intermediate is then dehydrogenated to form a Ga-alkene complex, which can undergo further dehydrogenation to produce a Ga-alkyne species. The final step is the desorption of the alkyne product and regeneration of the active Ga site.

In comparison, the carbenium mechanism involves the initial protonation of propane to form a carbenium ion, which is then deprotonated to produce propene. The carbenium mechanism does not involve the formation of a Ga-alkyl intermediate and is less favored due to the higher energy barrier for proton transfer.

The CH activation step is proposed as the rate-determining step (RDS) in the alkyl mechanism due to the high activation energy required for the cleavage of the C-H bond. This step is crucial for the formation of the Ga-alkyl intermediate, which is necessary for subsequent dehydrogenation reactions.

The alkyl mechanism can apply to different Ga species structures, including monomeric Ga, Ga clusters, and Ga-exchanged zeolites. The structure of the Ga species can significantly influence the reactivity and selectivity of the PDH reaction. For example, monomeric Ga species tend to favor the formation of propene, while Ga clusters and Ga-exchanged zeolites can lead to the production of higher alkenes and aromatics.

1.提供在镓基催化剂上丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中烷基机制的全面解释，详细说明从初始丙烷活化到产物形成的关键步骤。将此机制与卡宾机制进行比较，讨论为什么提出CH活化步骤作为速率决定步骤（RDS），并解释烷基机制如何适用于不同的Ga物种结构。

在镓基催化剂上丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中的烷基机制涉及从初始丙烷活化到产物形成的关键步骤。该机制始于丙烷在催化剂表面的吸附，随后通过形成Ga-烷基中间体激活C-H键。然后，该中间体被脱氢形成Ga-烯烃复合物，该复合物可以进一步脱氢产生Ga-炔物种。最后一步是炔产物的脱附和活性Ga位点的再生。

相比之下，卡宾机制涉及丙烷的初始质子化，形成卡宾离子，然后脱质子化产生丙烯。卡宾机制不涉及Ga-烷基中间体的形成，由于质子转移的高能垒，该机制不太有利。

CH活化步骤被提议为烷基机制中的速率决定步骤（RDS），因为C-H键断裂需要高活化能。此步骤对于Ga-烷基中间体的形成至关重要，这是后续脱氢反应所必需的。

烷基机制可以适用于不同的Ga物种结构，包括单体Ga、Ga簇和Ga交换沸石。Ga物种的结构可以显著影响PDH反应的反应性和选择性。例如，单体Ga物种倾向于形成丙烯，而Ga簇和Ga交换沸石可以导致更高烯烃和芳烃的产生。

1.The alkyl mechanism in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions on gallium-based catalysts involves the activation of propane by hydride abstraction from the reacting alkane by adsorbed carbenium ions (bimolecular) or by addition of protons to alkenes to form a carbenium ion (monomolecular). The initial propene intermediate, formed by dehydrogenation of propane, undergoes acid-catalyzed chain growth reactions within zeolite channels by oligomerization or addition to C 3 + carbocations. As the alkene chain lengthens,13-scission reactions become faster and ulti- mately establish a 'quasi-equilibrated' pool of alkene intermediates with a broad size distribu- tion. These alkene intermediates continue to undergo hydrogenation-dehydrogena- tion reactions, commonly described as hydrogen transfer, in which light alkenes accept hydrogen to form alkanes. C 6 + alkenes tend to dehydro- genate and cyclize to kinetically-stable and ther- modynamically-favored aromatic products. Cracking of larger chains also occurs with the concomitant removal of hydrogen by its addi- tion to light alkene products of cracking reac- tions. The alkyl mechanism applies to different Ga species structures, as the beneficial effect of Ga on alkane aromatization rates and selectivity has been observed whether Ga ions are introduced by impregnation or ion exchange techniques.

2.Compared to the carbenium mechanism, the alkyl mechanism does not involve the direct protonation of a propane molecule to form carbonium ions (C3H-). The alkyl mechanism is more consistent with the observed effects of catalyst composition on reaction rate and selectivity. The CH activation step is proposed as the rate-determining step (RDS) because the addition of metal species to H-ZSM5 channels increases aromatic turnover rates and decreases cracking turnover rates. The addition of metal cations also increases the deuterium content in 'unreacted' propane and the deuterium incorporation turnovers, indicating that metal cations increase the rate of both H-atom recombinative desorption and of H 2 dissociative adsorption during propane dehydrocyclodimerization reactions. However, adsorption-desorption steps remain irreversible and not fully equilibrated even on Ga/H-ZSM5 and Zn/H-ZSM5. This H-atom disposal step remains the rate-determining step for each sequential dehydrogenation reaction required to convert propane to aromatics.

3.The alkyl mechanism applies to different Ga species structures, as the beneficial effect of Ga on alkane aromatization rates and selectivity has been observed whether Ga ions are introduced by impregnation or ion exchange techniques. The presence of Ga species allows gas phase hydrogen to dissociatively adsorb and to effectively compete for surface sites, thus decreasing aromatic selectivity. The addition of alternate H-disposal pathways, whether by using stoichiometric acceptors (CO, CO 2, or 0 2) or metal cations (Ga or Zn), removes the burden of hydrogen removal from other steps that form light alkanes and reduce aromatics selectivity.

1.在基于镓的催化剂上的丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应中，烷基机制涉及通过吸附的碳正离子(双分子)或通过向烯烃添加质子形成碳正离子(单分子)从反应的烷烃中抽离氢化物，以激活丙烷。最初形成的丙烯中间体通过在沸石通道内通过寡聚或添加到C3+碳正离子进行酸催化的链增长反应。随着烯烃链的增长，13-裂解反应变得更快，最终建立了一个具有广泛尺寸分布的“准平衡”烯烃中间体池。这些烯烃中间体继续进行氢化-脱氢反应，通常称为氢转移，其中轻烯烃接受氢以形成烷烃。C6+烯烃倾向于脱氢并环化为动力学稳定和热力学有利的芳香产物。较大的链的裂解也伴随着氢的去除，通过将其添加到裂解反应的轻烯烃产物中。烷基机制适用于不同的Ga物种结构，因为无论Ga离子是通过浸渍还是离子交换技术引入，Ga对烷烃芳构化速率和选择性的有益影响都已被观察到。

2.与碳正离子机制相比，烷基机制不涉及直接质子化丙烷分子以形成碳离子(C3H-)。烷基机制与催化剂组成对反应速率和选择性的影响更一致。CH活化步骤被提议为速率决定步骤(RDS)，因为向H-ZSM5通道添加金属物种会增加芳烃周转率并降低裂解周转率。添加金属阳离子还会增加“未反应”丙烷中的氘含量和氘掺入周转率，表明金属阳离子增加了丙烷脱氢过程中H-原子重组脱附和H2解吸吸附的速率。然而，吸附-脱附步骤即使在Ga/H-ZSM5和Zn/H-ZSM5上也保持不可逆且未完全平衡。这个H-原子处置步骤仍然是将丙烷转化为芳烃所需的每个连续脱氢反应的速率决定步骤。

3.烷基机制适用于不同的Ga物种结构，因为无论Ga离子是通过浸渍还是离子交换技术引入，Ga对烷烃芳构化速率和选择性的有益影响都已被观察到。Ga物种的存在允许气相氢气解离吸附并有效竞争表面位点，从而降低芳烃选择性。添加替代的H-处置途径，无论是通过使用计量受体(CO、CO2或O2)还是金属阳离子(Ga或Zn)，都可以从形成轻烷烃并降低芳烃选择性的其他步骤中去除氢去除的负担。

1.在基于镓的催化剂上，丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应的烷基机制涉及通过吸附的碳正离子从反应的烷烃中抽离氢化物(双分子)或通过向烯烃添加质子形成碳正离子(单分子)来激活丙烷。将Ga离子添加到H-ZSM5通道中通过从激活C-H键的酸位点去除H原子，使酸位点在不形成裂解产物的情况下周转，从而增加了丙烯的形成速率。Ga和Zn充当“端口”，催化由酸催化C-H键断裂形成的H原子的重组解吸，形成所有氢气(H2)。无论Ga离子是通过浸渍还是离子交换技术引入，Ga对烷烃芳构化速率和选择性的有益影响都已被观察到，因此这种机制适用于不同的Ga物种结构。
2.与碳正离子机制相比，烷基机制涉及通过氢化物抽离或质子添加来激活丙烷，而不是直接质子化丙烷形成碳正离子。CH活化步骤被提议为速率决定步骤(RDS)，因为它涉及断裂强C-H键，这在能量上是不利的。在Na-ZSM5上的反应确认C-H键活化主要发生在BrOnsted酸位点，支持烷基机制。
