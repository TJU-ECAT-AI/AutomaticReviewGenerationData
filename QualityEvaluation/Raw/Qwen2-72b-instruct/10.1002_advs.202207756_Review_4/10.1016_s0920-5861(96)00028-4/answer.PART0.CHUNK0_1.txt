[1] "The beneficial effect of Ga on alkane aromatization rates and selectivity has been observed whether Ga ions are introduced by impregnation [16,26,28,29,33,35] or ion exchange techniques [15,18,22,23,32]."
[2] "These data suggest that H-ZSM5 can activate C-H bonds very effectively, but it cannot dis-"
[3] "The presence of Ga and Zn species within zeolite channels leads to much higher propane conversion rates and aromatics selectivity (Ta- ble 2, Fig. 1)."
[4] "The addition of metal cations also increases the deuterium content in 'unreacted' propane (Fig. 18)."
[5] "The addition of Ga and Zn increase the deuterium incorporation turnovers (Fig. 19)."
[6] "Clearly, Ga and Zn species increase the re- versibility of H-atom recombinative desorption steps and act as efficient 'portholes' [67] for the removal of H-atoms produced during C-H bond activation steps."
[7] "The cationic Ga complexes in exchange sites at room temperature must be present with a + 1 charge, regardless of the formal oxidation state of the Ga atoms."
[8] "The reduction of Ga cations residing at in- trazeolitic exchange sites can restore BrCnsted acid sites by the formation of protons during H 2 pretreatment or catalytic reactions of light alka- nes (Eq. (3))."
[9] "The reduction-oxidation of in- trazeolitic Ga species has been confirmed by the X-ray absorption studies described in a previous report [26]."
[10] "The adsorption-desorption process that accompanies this redox cycle has been detected by measurements of the appearance and disappearance of dihydrogen from the gas phase during thermal treatment of a Ga/H- ZSM5 sample previously pre-reduced in H 2 at 773 K for 4 h and cooled to room temperature."
[11] "Hydrogen adsorption-desorption data are consistent with Ga K-edge X-ray absorption data, which show Ga 3 + forms during cooling of reduced samples to room temperature."
[12] "During catalytic reaction of propane at 673-773 K, Ga 3+ reduces to its active form (Ga 1+) in a process that occurs along with a significant increase in the rate of propane dehydrocy- clodimerization reactions."
[13] "The cationic Ga complexes in exchange sites at room temperature must be present with a + 1 charge, regardless of the formal oxidation state of the Ga atoms."
[14] "This is required by the need to balance the net negative charge of a single cation exchange site isolated by significant dis- tances from other exchange sites within zeolite channels."
[15] "This is likely to lead to the formation of species such as [GaO] +, where strongly bound oxygen atoms provide the required charge bal- ance for Ga 3+ ions exchanged during contact with Ga nitrate solution."

1.The alkyl mechanism in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions on gallium-based catalysts involves the activation of C-H bonds by BrOnsted acid sites, followed by the removal of hydrogen atoms by Ga species through recombinative desorption. The initial activation of propane occurs on BrOnsted acid sites, where C-H bonds are cleaved. Ga species, present as monomeric cations at exchange sites within zeolite channels, act as 'portholes' for the removal of hydrogen atoms formed during C-H bond activation. This removal of hydrogen atoms as dihydrogen (H2) is critical for the overall reaction rate and selectivity. The alkyl mechanism applies to different Ga species structures, including monomeric Ga or Ga1 compounds, which are stabilized by interactions with basic oxygens within ZSM5 channels. The carbenium mechanism, involving the activation of propane by hydride abstraction or proton addition to alkenes, is not supported by isotopic evidence. The CH activation step is proposed as the rate-determining step (RDS) because it is fast and quasi-equilibrated during steady-state propane dehydrocyclodimerization on H-ZSM5, Ga/H-ZSM5, and Zn/H-ZSM5. The alkyl mechanism, involving the concerted action of acid sites for C-H bond activation and metal cations for hydrogen desorption, is consistent with experimental observations and applies to different Ga species structures within zeolite channels.

1.在基于镓的催化剂上的丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应中,烷基机制涉及通过Bronsted酸位点激活C-H键,随后通过Ga物种通过重组脱附去除氢原子。初始丙烷的激活发生在Bronsted酸位点,其中C-H键被裂解。Ga物种,作为位于沸石通道内交换位点的单体阳离子存在,作为“端口”去除在C-H键激活过程中形成的氢原子。这种将氢原子作为二氢(H2)去除对于整体反应速率和选择性至关重要。烷基机制适用于不同的Ga物种结构,包括单体Ga或Ga1化合物,这些化合物通过与ZSM5通道内的基本氧原子的相互作用稳定。涉及通过氢化物抽吸或向烯烃添加质子激活丙烷的卡宾机制并未得到同位素证据的支持。CH激活步骤被提议为速率决定步骤(RDS),因为在H-ZSM5、Ga/H-ZSM5和Zn/H-ZSM5上稳态丙烷脱氢环二聚化期间,它快速且准平衡。涉及酸位点C-H键激活和金属阳离子氢脱附的协同作用的烷基机制与实验观察一致,并适用于沸石通道内不同的Ga物种结构。
