1.Provide a comprehensive explanation of the alkyl mechanism in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions on gallium-based catalysts, detailing its key steps from initial propane activation to product formation. Compare this mechanism to the carbenium mechanism, discuss why the CH activation step is proposed as the rate-determining step (RDS), and explain how the alkyl mechanism applies to different Ga species structures.

The alkyl mechanism in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions on gallium-based catalysts involves several key steps from initial propane activation to product formation. The mechanism begins with the adsorption of propane on the catalyst surface, followed by the activation of a C-H bond through the formation of a Ga-alkyl intermediate. This intermediate is then dehydrogenated to form a Ga-alkene complex, which can undergo further dehydrogenation to produce a Ga-alkyne species. The final step is the desorption of the alkyne product and regeneration of the active Ga site.

In comparison, the carbenium mechanism involves the initial protonation of propane to form a carbenium ion, which is then deprotonated to produce propene. The carbenium mechanism does not involve the formation of a Ga-alkyl intermediate and is less favored due to the higher energy barrier for proton transfer.

The CH activation step is proposed as the rate-determining step (RDS) in the alkyl mechanism due to the high activation energy required for the cleavage of the C-H bond. This step is crucial for the formation of the Ga-alkyl intermediate, which is necessary for subsequent dehydrogenation reactions.

The alkyl mechanism can apply to different Ga species structures, including monomeric Ga, Ga clusters, and Ga-exchanged zeolites. The structure of the Ga species can significantly influence the reactivity and selectivity of the PDH reaction. For example, monomeric Ga species tend to favor the formation of propene, while Ga clusters and Ga-exchanged zeolites can lead to the production of higher alkenes and aromatics.

1.提供在镓基催化剂上丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中烷基机制的全面解释，详细说明从初始丙烷活化到产物形成的关键步骤。将此机制与卡宾机制进行比较，讨论为什么提出CH活化步骤作为速率决定步骤（RDS），并解释烷基机制如何适用于不同的Ga物种结构。

在镓基催化剂上丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中的烷基机制涉及从初始丙烷活化到产物形成的关键步骤。该机制始于丙烷在催化剂表面的吸附，随后通过形成Ga-烷基中间体激活C-H键。然后，该中间体被脱氢形成Ga-烯烃复合物，该复合物可以进一步脱氢产生Ga-炔物种。最后一步是炔产物的脱附和活性Ga位点的再生。

相比之下，卡宾机制涉及丙烷的初始质子化，形成卡宾离子，然后脱质子化产生丙烯。卡宾机制不涉及Ga-烷基中间体的形成，由于质子转移的高能垒，该机制不太有利。

CH活化步骤被提议为烷基机制中的速率决定步骤（RDS），因为C-H键断裂需要高活化能。此步骤对于Ga-烷基中间体的形成至关重要，这是后续脱氢反应所必需的。

烷基机制可以适用于不同的Ga物种结构，包括单体Ga、Ga簇和Ga交换沸石。Ga物种的结构可以显著影响PDH反应的反应性和选择性。例如，单体Ga物种倾向于形成丙烯，而Ga簇和Ga交换沸石可以导致更高烯烃和芳烃的产生。
