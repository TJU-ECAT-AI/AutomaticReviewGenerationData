Zelinsky Institute of Organic Chemistry of Russian Academy of Sciences, Leninsky prospect 47, Moscow, 119991, Russia Received 5 December 2005; revised 20 March 2006; accepted 20 March 2006 Abstract The stability of various gallium species (Ga+, GaH2+, and GaH+2) as models for the active sites in reduced Ga/ZSM-5 and the possible reaction paths of alkane dehydrogenation were studied using a density functional theory cluster modeling approach. In general, alkanes are preferentially activated via an alkyl mechanism, in which gallium acts as an acceptor of the alkyl group. A comparison of the computed energetics of the various reaction paths for ethane indicates that the catalytic reaction most likely proceeds over Ga+. The initial step of CH activation is the oxidative addition of an alkane molecule to the Ga+ cation, which proceeds via an indirect heterolytic mechanism involving the basic oxygen atoms of the zeolite lattice. Although the catalytic reaction can also occur over GaH2+ and GaH+2 sites, these paths are not favored.
Decomposition of GaH2+ leading to formation of Ga+ during the catalytic cycle is more favorable than regeneration of these sites. The reactivity of GaH+2 ions is strongly dependent on the distance between the stabilizing aluminum-occupied oxygen tetrahedra. In cases of greater AlAl distances, the stability of the GaH+2 species is very low, and it decomposes to Ga+ and a Brnsted acid site, whereas when Al atoms are located more closely, the charge-compensating GaH+2 ions are the most stable and exhibit the lowest activity for the initial CH bond cleavage reaction. 2006 Elsevier Inc.

1. Introduction
Gallium- and zinc-exchanged H-ZSM-5 zeolites (Ga/ZSM-5 and Zn/ZSM-5) are known to be effective catalysts for promot- ing the selective conversion of light alkanes to aromatics [1].
The reaction mechanism is thought to consist of a complex scheme involving dehydrogenation, oligomerization, and ring- closure steps [216]. The modifying cations play key roles in dehydrogenation of paraffins [25,1416], whereas Brnsted acid protons catalyze the oligomerization of the olefins thus produced and possibly their subsequent aromatization. Numer- ous experimental [216] and theoretical [1722] studies have been devoted to investigating the mechanism of catalytic de- hydrogenation of light alkanes over gallium-exchanged ZSM-5 zeolites. However, the structure of the active intrazeolite Ga * Corresponding author. Fax: +31 40 245 5054.

Extra-framework gallium is introduced into zeolites by ei- ther a conventional ion-exchange technique or solid-state ion exchange. In both cases, gallium is initially deposited on the external surface of the zeolite crystals, because hydrated Ga+3 ions are too bulky to enter the elliptical channels of ZSM-5 [23].
The Ga2O3 species obtained after calcination are reduced dur- ing pretreatment with hydrogen or with the hydrocarbon feed to Ga2O species that migrate into the zeolite channels [11,12].
These mobile species react with the zeolitic Brnsted acid pro- tons, resulting in formation of reduced cationic Ga+, GaH2+,or GaH+2 species bound to zeolite oxygen atoms. The result- ing material may contain several types of reduced Ga species besides gallium oxide particles if the reduction process is not complete. The oxide species may include bulkier aggregates on the external surface or smaller ones in the micropore space of the zeolite. Meitzner et al.

lium is present in reduced Ga+ form, although the oxidation state changes to 3+ on cooling to lower temperatures. Simi- larly, Kazansky et al. [15] found that Ga+ species are the most stable species at high temperatures and that oxidative addition of hydrogen to Ga+ leads to GaH2+ species at lower tempera- tures. It is important to note that these gallium hydride species are relatively stable and decompose only slowly at higher tem- peratures [15].
Recently, a new and completely anhydrous route for the preparation of well-defined cationic Ga species via chemical vapor deposition of trimethylgallium to anhydrous HZSM-5 has been reported [1416,2426]. Careful removal of the methyl ligands by reduction leads to GaH2+ cations, which can then be decomposed at high temperatures to Ga+ cations. When Ga+ cations are predominant in ZSM-5, stable activity in propane dehydrogenation to propylene is observed [16]. Decreased ac- tivity is found when the catalyst contains GaH2+ cations. The higher activity at steady state is attributed to the decomposi- tion of less active GaH2+ cations to Ga+ under the reducing high-temperature reaction conditions.
Most theoretical studies have considered GaH2+ as the ac- tive site for alkane dehydrogenation [17,18,21,22]. Frash and van Santen [17] proposed a three-step mechanism including (i) alkyl (RδHδ+) activation of the CH bond, resulting in the formation of a zeolitic Brnsted acid proton and a rather un- stable neutral H2GaR species; (ii) the subsequent desorption of molecular hydrogen via recombination of the acidic proton and one of the hydride ions bounded to gallium; and (iii) the decomposition of the resulting [HGaR]+ complex to alkene and GaH2+. The decomposition step is rate-limiting, and an ac- tivation energy of 254 kJ/mol is computed for a model reaction of ethane dehydrogenation. Alternatively, a one-step concerted mechanism over GaH2+ was recently considered by Pereira and Nascimento [21]. The activation energy for this process is substantially higher (by 90 kJ/mol) than the mechanism pro- posed by Frash and van Santen [17] and, consequently, this mechanism is less likely. Very recently, Joshi and Thomson [22] proposed the existence of bivalent extra-framework gal- lium species (GaH+2) close to a pair of tetrahedral framework Al species in ZSM-5 zeolite as active sites for alkane dehy- drogenation. The overall activation energy for the carbenium pathway for ethane activation over GaH+2 species, which are stabilized by two aluminum-containing oxygen tetrahedra, lie in the range of 260360 kJ/mol, depending on the cation site at which GaH+2 species were stabilized. Moreover, the choice for a positively charged alkyl group for the initial activation of ethane contrasts with earlier proposals.
The recent experimental results indicating that Ga+ cations are the active sites [1416] led us to reconsider the reaction mechanism of alkane activation over reduced Ga cations stabi- lized in zeolites. Here we present a detailed comparative analy- sis of the reactivity of various cationic species (Ga+, GaH2+,and GaH+2) by density functional theory (DFT) cluster calcula- tions. In addition, we discuss the relative stability of the various cationic Ga species and the dependence of their chemical prop- erties on the aluminum distribution in ZSM-5 zeolite.
2. Experimental
Dehydrogenation of ethane over Ga/ZSM-5 zeolite, as well as stability of different gallium-containing active sites, was studied using GaHAl2Si6O9H14 and GaH3Al2Si6O9H14 clus- ter models, which represent two adjacent five rings from the wall of the straight channel of ZSM-5 zeolite. Ga+, GaH2+, and GaH+2 cations compensated the negative charge of the [AlO2] unit in one ring, whereas for the first two types of cations,the other negative charge in the other ring was stabilized by a proton. Al atoms were placed in T12 and T8 lattice posi- tions [27] to model a cation site (Zd) with distantly separated anionic sites, whereas the next nearest T12 and T6 lattice posi- tions were occupied with aluminum atoms in the cluster Zs. The distance between two aluminum ions was equal to 8.14 Å for the Zd cluster model and 4.84 Å for the Zs cluster model. Note that the T12 site is located at the cross-section of the straight and sinusoidal channels of ZSM-5; accordingly, the cations sta- bilized in the vicinity of this site are considered to have the highest accessibility. Therefore, the charge-compensating gal- lium species were located in the five-ring-containing aluminum at the T12 position. Hydrogen atoms were used to saturate the dangling SiO bonds at the periphery of the cluster. The starting geometry of the clusters corresponded to the real lat- tice of the ZSM-5 zeolite corresponding to X-ray diffraction data [28].
DFT, with the B3LYP [29] hybride exchange-correlation functional, was used to perform all of the calculations. Ear- lier, the hybride B3LYP method was reported to provide ex- cellent descriptions of various reaction profiles and particularly of geometries, heats of reaction, activation energies, and vi- brational properties of various molecules [30]. Geometry op- timization and saddlepoint searches were all performed us- ing the Gaussian 03 program [31]. The 6-31G(d,p) basis set was used for the exchanged gallium cation and the bridg- ing hydroxyl group, whereas the ethane molecule and the ze- olitic oxygen atoms were described by the 6-311G(d,p) ba- sis set. Al and Si atoms of the zeolite framework, as well as the boundary (H) hydrogen atoms, were treated by the D95- Dunning/Huzinaga basis set. It was shown earlier that such a compromise is successful for studies of cation-exchanged zeo- lites [3234].
As described previously [3234], special restrictions on the positions of the boundary Hatoms were imposed during the optimization procedure. In short, the structure of the initial zeolite cluster was first constrained to the X-ray diffraction data [28]. Subsequently, only SiHand AlHbond lengths and the position of the gallium ion were optimized, whereas positions of the other atoms, as well as the directions of the bonds, were fixed according to crystallographic data. The posi- tions of the Hatoms in all subsequent calculations were then fixed, whereas the positions of the remaining atoms of the clus- ter were optimized. All of the energies obtained from the DFT calculations used for estimating the reaction heats and activa- tion barriers were corrected for the zero-point energy.

3. Results
3.1. Structure and properties of active sites
Fig. 1 displays the optimized structures of Ga+, GaH2+, and GaH+2 ions stabilized in the Zd (distantly separated Al ions) and Zs (Al ions in the next-nearest positions). Table 1 lists the corresponding optimized GaO and GaH bond lengths, the atomic charges, and the relative energies. The univalent cations Ga+ and GaH2+ are located in close vicinity to one of alu- minum atoms (T12) and coordinate to two adjacent oxygen atoms (O1 and O2). The structural parameters show that the GaO bonds (GaO1 and GaO2) between Ga and lattice oxy- gens are somewhat shorter for the dihydrido-gallyl ion than for the Ga+ cation. On the other hand, the GaO distances to the other oxygens (GaO3 and GaO4) of the cluster are shorter in the latter case. This is most likely due to the repulsive in- teractions of basic oxygen atoms of the zeolite framework with the negatively charged hydride ions in the bonded GaH2+ com- plex. On the other hand, weak electrostatic interaction of Ga+ ion with remote zeolitic oxygens leads to additional stabiliza- tion of the cation. This is also supported by the fact that the increased basicity of O3 and O4 atoms due to exchange of the Si by Al atom at framework T6 position results in a signifi- cant decrease of the corresponding GaO distances in the Ga Zs cluster. The computed GaO and GaH distances for GaH2+ species stabilized in either Zd or Zs clusters agree very well with those reported for the dihydrido-gallyl ion in the extended cluster model containing 11 T atoms [22], corresponding to the cation site located at the cross-section of the straight and sinu- 76

soidal channels of ZSM-5 zeolite. We infer that the presence of an additional anionic site in our model that is balanced by an acidic proton does not significantly affect the properties of the gallium-containing sites (Ga+ and GaH2+).
The bivalent GaH+2 ion is preferentially located at the Zd site (Fig. 1c) near the Al1 atom and at a rather long distance [r(GaAl2) = 6.857 Å] from the second anionic site of the cluster. Table 1 shows that the GaH+2 ion is coordinated by four oxygen atoms, two of which are bonded at a somewhat shorter distance (0.2 Å) due to the lower basicity of the oxygen atoms of the silicon-occupied oxygen tetrahedra compared with those of the aluminum-occupied tetrahedra. This is in agreement with the fact that the GaH+2 ion sits almost in the center (GaAl1 and GaAl2 distances are equal to 2.995 and 2.957 Å, respec- tively) of the 5T rings containing two anionic sites (GaH Zs structure; Fig. 1f ).
The Lewis acidic properties of the GaH+2 ions should be similar to those of Zn+2, and, accordingly, we would expect similar bonding properties of these charge-compensating ions with the zeolite. Indeed, the ZnO bond lengths (Table 1) re- ported by Zhidomirov et al. [3234] for zinc stabilized at the similar cationic site cohere well with the geometry parameters of the GaH Zd cluster, taking into account the slightly smaller radius of the Ga3+ cation. The geometry of the GaH Zs corre- lates also very well with that reported by Shubin et al. [35] for zinc ions stabilized in the 5T zeolitic ring containing two alu- minum atoms (Table 1). Therefore, one expects the GaH+2 ions to exhibit similar chemical properties to those of exchanged zinc ions.
Desorption of H2 from GaH2+ (1) resulting in formation of Ga+ ions is slightly endothermic (Table 1). However, due to in- crease of entropy at high temperature, the equilibrium of this process is shifted strongly toward Ga+ formation (G
823 K =
75 and 101 kJ/mol, respectively, for Zd and Zs models).
This finding corresponds well to the experimental observa- tion that charge-compensating Ga+ ions are transformed into dihydrido-gallyl ions only at lower temperatures in hydrogen atmosphere [11,15]. Dehydrogenation of these species, result- ing in formation of univalent gallium ions, was found to proceed on high-temperature treatment in inert atmosphere or in vacuum [15],(1) GaH2+ZGa+Z+ H2.
Formation of GaH+2 ions from Ga+ and a Brnsted acid pro- ton (2) is found to be a strongly endothermic process (E = +88 kJ/mol) for the case of a long AlAl distance (Zd mode) and a strongly exothermic process (E = 102 kJ/mol) when two Al atoms are placed at the next-nearest positions of the cation site (Table 1), Ga+Z+ H+ZZ+ GaH+2Z.
(2) Therefore, we predict that for relatively long AlAl distances,the equilibrium of reaction (2) shifts to the side of the univa- lent Ga+ ion and the proton. On the other hand, when located in the vicinity of two anionic sites, the bivalent GaH+2 ion is more stable (by 102 kJ/mol) than the Ga+ Zs site (Table 1),and the equilibrium will shift to the formation of the gallium monohydride.
3.2. Ethane dehydrogenation over Ga+
In agreement with recent experimental DRIFTS investiga- tions [14], molecular adsorption of ethane on Ga Zd does not result in any specific interaction between C2H6 and the ad- sorption site at low temperature. The geometry and charge properties of both the C2H6 moiety and the cluster model in the adsorption complex are similar to those calculated for the individual fragments. Recent experiments [15] indicate that at moderate temperature (523 K), dehydrogenation of ethane over Ga/ZSM-5 zeolite is initiated by dissociative adsorption of C2H6 on charge-compensating reduced Ga+ species, resulting in the formation of gallium-ethyl hydride according to Ga+Z+ C2H6 [HGaC2H5]+Z.
(3) Reaction (3) as written corresponds to an oxidative addition of ethane to Ga+, resulting in oxidation of the univalent gallium to Ga+3. The activation energy of the direct homolytic cleavage of the CH bond of an ethane molecule on the Ga Zd cluster is computed as 374 kJ/mol [Fig. 2, route (a), TS1]. This barrier is too high to explain the experimentally observed formation of [C2H5GaH]+ species (II) at 523 K. Moreover, the value for the activation energy is very close to the CH bond energy in molecular ethane (423 kJ/mol [36]). Thus, it appears that for the case of ethane activation over Ga+-exchanged ZSM-5, sta- bilization of the nonpolar transition state (TS1) is very weak,and most likely the role of the active site is limited to stabi- lize the products of the homolytic dissociation of ethane via chemisorption of C2H5 and H radicals.
Generally, alkanes are activated over transition metal com- plexes [3739] via formation of a σ-C2H6 complex. The bond- ing of a hydrocarbon molecule with the transition metal ion in such complexes is described by a synergetic combination of the ligand-to-metal donation from the σ CH orbitals of the hydro- carbon to the partially occupied s-orbital of the transition metal (TM) and the metal-to-ligand back-donation from the dπ or- bital to the CH σ -orbitals. Such interactions result in a very strong weakening of the CH bond, which in turn, together with formation of new TM...C and TM...H bonds, significantly facilitates homolytic CH bond cleavage. However, the fully occupied 3d-orbitals of univalent gallium are of too-low energy and thus do not contribute to the backdonation. Moreover, be- cause the 4s-orbital is occupied, it will not act effectively as an electron-acceptor orbital. Thus, the formation of the σ CH complex between ethane and Ga+ is unlikely, and, correspond- ingly, the energy cost for the homolytic dissociation of ethane over Ga Zd is very close to that for the gas-phase dissociation.
Alternatively, the interaction with a soft Lewis acidbase pair consisting of Ga+ and the basic oxygen atom of the ze- olite lattice appears to be responsible for the initial CH bond cleavage. This route of heterolytic activation of the CH bond is shown in Fig. 2, route (b). The geometry and charge parameters of the intermediates and transition-state structures are summa- rized in Table 2. In the initial step, heterolytic dissociation of the

a For isolated C2H6 molecule distances and charges were computed at B3LYP DFT level with 6-311G(d,p). For isolated C2H4 molecule Mulliken charges computed at the same level are 0.219 and 0.109 on C and H atoms, respectively.
CH bond results in formation of a neutral GaC2H5 species in the vicinity of a zeolitic Brnsted acid site (I). The calcu- lated activation energy (TS1, 210 kJ/mol) is significantly lower than that obtained for the homolytic path. The corresponding transition state structure (TS1) is characterized by very strong polarization of the reacting CH bond following the alkyl mechanism; that is, both the positive charge on the H atom and the negative charge on carbon strongly increase compared with gas-phase C2H6. At the same time, the positive charge on the gallium decreases, indicating weakening bonds between the cation and zeolitic oxygen. The partial negative charge on the O1 atom also decreases due to bonding with the proton from ethane. Similar effects were also observed for the O3 atom of the Zs cluster model (Table 1) for the Ga Zs and GaH2 Zs clus- ters.
The intermediate (I) resulting from heterolytic activation of ethane over the Ga Zd site is very unstable and readily re- arranges to the stable product (II). This reaction proceeds via oxidation of the GaC2H5 species by the Brnsted acid site with a very low activation barrier (9 kJ/mol, TS2). The ease of formation of complex (II) also explains why only the prod- uct of oxidative addition was observed experimentally [15].
The final step in ethane dehydrogenation over Ga+ was found to be a one-step desorption of H2 and C2H4 molecules via the TS3 structure. This reaction can be described as a destruc- tive reductive elimination, resulting in reduction of the Ga+3 78

ion and regeneration of the initial Ga Zd site. Table 2 shows that the hydrogen atoms of the free methyl group in structure II are positively charged, whereas the H atom bounded to gallium is negatively charged. Hence, the catalytic cycle is closed by the recombination of these atoms to form molecular hydrogen via transition state TS3. The activation barrier of the latter process is computed as 224 kJ/mol. This value is slightly higher than that calculated for the initial CH cleavage (210 kJ/mol). The overall activation energy of the ethane dehydrogenation over the reduced dehydrogenated Ga/ZSM-5 zeolite is 233 kJ/mol.
3.3. Ethane activation over GaH2+
To compare the reactivities of the various charge-compensa- ting gallium species, we investigated the alkyl activation path- way over the GaH2+ site proposed by Frash and van San- ten [17] with the present Zd cluster model. The energetics for this mechanism are presented in Fig. 3, and the geometry and charge parameters of the intermediates and transition-state structures are listed in Table 3.
Similar to the findings for Ga+, molecular adsorption of ethane on the dihydrido-gallyl ion stabilized in the Zd cluster was very weak and did not result in any significant perturbation of either the adsorbed molecule or the adsorption site. Thus, it is assumed that this molecular adsorption does not influence the subsequent chemical activation of C2H6 molecules. The mech- anism of the initial activation of the hydrocarbon molecule on dihydrido-gallyl ion is very similar to that suggested for the het- erolytic dissociation of ethane on Ga Zd. Indeed, a very strong polarization of the reacting CH bond is observed in the TS4 structure, leading to heterolytic CH bond splitting with forma- tion of a neutral (H)2Ga+3C2H5species in the vicinity of a Brnsted acid site (III). The calculated activation energy for this elementary step (193 kJ/mol) is significantly higher than that (158 kJ/mol) reported previously [17] for GaH2+ species stabilized in a fully optimized 3T cluster. On the other hand, the present value is slightly lower than that (203 kJ/mol) reported by Yoshi and Thomson [22] for the dihydrido-gallyl ion stabi- lized at a more extended cluster model containing 11T atoms.
We attribute the higher activation barrier than that reported by Frash and van Santen [17] mainly to greater steric hindrance of the interaction of the CH bond with the Ga...O pair caused by the constrained geometry and the larger size of the clus- ter model. The difference between the present result and that reported in [22] is also attributed to the steric factors and to dif- ferent basic properties of the zeolitic O atom involved in the CH activation resulting from size differences of the cluster model.
The H2GaC2H6 species formed in the initial step are stabi- lized by interaction between a hydride ion (H1) bonded to the gallium and an acidic proton (H1). This interaction results in a strong elongation (by about 0.2 Å) of the O1H1 bond. The GaO2 distance in structure III (Table 3) is significantly less than the corresponding distance in structure I (Table 2) and is indicative of the stronger interaction of the trivalent gallium in the H2GaC2H6 species with the framework zeolitic oxygens.
Due to the latter interaction, the coordination of the Ga+3 ion in structure III is rather close to tetrahedral, which is known to be preferred for Ga+3-containing compounds [40]. Thus,both attractive interactions provide additional stabilization of the reactive species III compared with GaC2H6 species (I).
Moreover, this facilitates subsequent decomposition of III via desorption of H2 and formation of the stable tetrahedral gal- lium in the [HGaC2H5]+ ion (II). The calculated activation barrier (TS5) for this process is equal to 2 kJ/mol.
To close the catalytic cycle via regeneration of the initial dihydrido-gallyl ion, the decomposition of the structure II was proposed by Frash and van Santen to proceed via abstraction of a hydride ion from the β-position of the ethyl group by the positively charged gallium atom and simultaneous desorption of ethylene [Fig. 3, route (a)]. The activation energy for this process was 257 kJ/mol, in an excellent agreement with the previously reported values of 258 kJ/mol [22] and 254 kJ/mol [17]. This close agreement indicates that the chemical proper- ties of the exchanged trivalent gallium species almost do not depend on the surrounding unless the other atoms of the zeo- lite are involved in the reaction. However, Table 3 shows that both the abstracting H atom of the β-methyl group and the gallium ion are positively charged. Thus, regeneration of the GaH2+ active site requires repolarization of the CH bond,a process that appears to be unfavorable. On the other hand,simultaneous desorption of H2 and C2H4 [Fig. 3, route (b)],which results in formation of the univalent gallium ion (Ga Zd), is about 30 kJ/mol more favorable than closure of the cy- cle with regeneration of the dihydrido-gallyl ion. Note that this process is also strongly favored because of the entropy factor.The calculated Gibbs energy changes (G 823) at the conditions of catalytic reaction (823 K, 1 atm.) are equal to +1 for route (a) and 74 kJ/mol for route (b).
3.4. Ethane activation over GaH+2
Recently, Joshi and Thomson [22] proposed that the GaH+2 species stabilized in the vicinity of two framework Al atoms are the active species for hydrocarbon dehydrogenation in Ga/ZSM-5 catalysts. The initial step of alkane activation over these active sites was suggested to be a heterolytic dissociation of the CH bond via a carbenium mechanism, resulting in for- mation of a carbenium ion attached to the basic oxygen of the zeolite and a hydride ion bonded to gallium (GaH Zd + C2H6 V) [Fig. 4, route (a)]. In view of earlier results [17,41], this mechanism seems disputable. Thus, to clarify the mechanism of alkane activation over GaH+2 species and to compare the re- activity with those of the earlier discussed gallium containing sites, the initial activation of ethane over GaH+2 stabilized at the Zd cluster was computed.
The elementary steps and the reaction energy diagrams for the carbenium and alkyl pathways of ethane activation over GaH Zd cluster are shown in Fig. 4, routes (a) and (b), respec- tively. The geometry and charge parameters of the interme- diates and transition state structures involved are summarized in Table 4. According to Joshi and Thomson [22], activated molecular adsorption of ethane on GaH+2 species (structure IV in Fig. 4) precedes CH bond cleavage. In contrast to the

aforementioned molecular adsorption of C2H6 on Ga Zd and GaH2 Zd, this process leads to very significant changes in the geometry and charge parameters of both adsorbed C2H6 and the adsorption site. The GaO coordination opens (Ga O3 and GaO4 bonds are broken), and the GaH+2 ion partially leaves the cation site (5T ring), so that gallium becomes co- ordinated to only two framework oxygens (O1 and O2). The coordinative unsaturation of the GaH+2 species is then partially compensated by interaction with one of the methyl group of ethane. Formation of such an activated adsorption complex is a strongly endothermic process (GaH Zd + C2H6 IV, E = +68 kJ/mol; Fig. 4), because it requires destruction of a sta- ble fourfold coordination of GaH by the lattice oxygen atoms.
On the other hand, coordination of ethane to the cation does not 80

compensate for the energy loss associated with the breaking of two GaO bonds (GaO3 and GaO4). In other words, it is not possible to form a strong adsorption complex of ethane with GaH Zd without decreasing the effective coordination number of the cation to the basic zeolitic oxygens, as was observed for Zn+2 ion stabilized in a similar cluster model [32,33]. The dif- ference with GaH+2 is that the gallium ion in the initial GaH Zd model is shielded by the attached hydride ion, which hin- ders the stabilizing charge donation from ethane to the cation.
The twofold coordination of GaH+2 ion in structure IV removes these hindrances. The effective transfer of electron density from ethane to the adsorption site is 0.283e, which is in agree- ment with the significant decrease in the positive charge of the Fig. 5. Calculated IR frequencies of CH stretching vibrations with their in- tensities and simulated IR spectrum (with all DFT computed vibrational fre- quencies scaled by factor 0.964) for structure IV. The shape of the CH vibration mostly perturbed due to interaction with GaH+2 ion is shown by balls and sticks model. IR spectrum of free C2H6 molecule calculated at B3LYP/6-311G(d,p) level is presented for comparison by the dashed line.
GaH+2 ion (Table 4). This indicates appreciable Lewis acidity of the activated GaH+2 ion in a cationic position with dis- tantly placed aluminum ions. The charge transfer is much larger (by 0.168e) than that for ethane adsorption on zinc ions [32],indicating a much stronger Lewis acidity of low-coordinated GaH+2 species.
Interaction of the hydrocarbon molecule with the exces- sively charged low-coordinated monohydrido-gallyl ion results in very strong polarization of the adsorbed molecule. This is re- flected in a very strong increase in the negative charge on the carbon atom (C1) and, at the same time, of the positive charge on the hydrogen atom (H1) involved in the interaction (Table 4).
In addition, the C1H1 bond length is 0.038 Å longer than that of the corresponding value for gas-phase ethane. These perturbations of the adsorbed molecule affect the vibrational properties of the C2H6 moiety in structure IV (Fig. 5). One can see that the calculated IR spectrum of CH vibrations of IV contains five slightly perturbed bands with frequencies close to those observed in the gas phase, whereas one band is very

+274 strongly red-shifted (by >300 cm1) and exhibits a very high relative intensity compared with those of the other CH stretch- ing bands. This band corresponds mainly to displacement of the hydrogen atom (H1) for the C1H1 bond directly interacting with the GaH+2 ion. Recently we reported that such a strong perturbation of adsorbed molecules leads to their subsequent chemical activation at higher temperatures after the displace- ment of atoms of the adsorbed molecule corresponding to the most intense low-frequency infrared band [42]. Thus, the ini- tially proposed structure for the product of CH activation of ethane on GaH Zd was built by displacement of the H1 atom by 1 Å in structure IV following the aforementioned CH stretch- ing vibration. Geometry optimization of the resulting structure leads to formation of product VI of the alkyl heterolytic CH bond cleavage. The calculated activation energy for this process [IV VI; Fig. 4, route (b)] is equal to 104 kJ/mol. The cor- responding transition state structure TS6 is characterized by an increase in the alkyl C1H1 bond polarization, resulting in formation of a proton (H+) attached to the basic zeolitic O atom and an alkyl (C2H5) grafted to the gallium ion. The resulting product, VI, is destabilized due to localization of likely charged ions (H+ and [HGaC2H5]+) in the immediate vicinity of one another. However, it can be further stabilized by 195 kJ/mol via proton transfer from O4 (structure IV) to the more basic O7 ion bounded to the Al2 (structure II). It was shown previously [34] that the activation energy of this process does not exceed 50 kJ/mol.
It was also found that the product (V) of carbenium acti- vation of C2H6 on GaH Zd is just 14 kJ/mol less stable than structure VI [Fig. 4 routes (a) and (b), respectively]. Unfortu- nately, we could not locate the transition-state structure corre- sponding to the carbenium mechanism of ethane activation on GaH+2 species [IV V; Fig. 4, route (a)] proposed by Joshi and Thomson [22]. However, with regard to the above discus- sion, it is obvious that this process will be less favorable than the alkyl one, because reaction IV V requires very strong repolarization of the electron density of adsorbed ethane to produce a negative charge on H1 and a positive charge on the carbon atom (C1). There do not appear to be any facilitating factors for this process, and hence we surmise that the car- benium pathway will be strongly disfavored in comparison with the alkyl activation of ethane on charge-compensating GaH+2 sites.
Thus, the initial activation of C2H6 on GaH Zd results in formation of the intermediate II, and hence, the catalytic cy- cle follows the reaction pathway described for ethane dehydro- genation over Ga Zd (Section 3.2), and GaH+2 is converted to Ga+.
3.5. Effect of AlAl distance on the reactivity of Ga+ and
GaH+2 sites The stability and reactivity of Ga+ and GaH+2 ions in the Zs cluster model were compared with those for clusters in which aluminum atoms are separated by a relatively long distance (8.138 Å). Here we present the computational results of ethane activation over these ions compensating for the negative charge in cluster models in which the aluminum ions are placed at the next-nearest allowed framework positions [Ga Zs and GaH Zs;r(Al1Al2) = 4.837 Å]. The intermediates and transition-state structures thus calculated are very similar to those obtained for the Zd model and exhibit similar trends in changes of geometry and charge parameters of intermediates due to chemical conver- sions. The calculated energetic parameters for elementary steps of ethane activation on Ga Zs and GaH Zs are summarized in Table 5.
The activation energies and enthalpies for both the ho- molytic and heterolytic CH bond cleavage on Ga+ ion in Zs clusters are very similar to those calculated for the distantly separated Al atoms. Thus, it can be concluded that relative localization of anionic [AlO2]units in the framework of ze- olite does not significantly affect the reactivity of the charge- compensating univalent gallium ions. In contrast, the chemical properties of GaH+2 depend strongly on the AlAl distance in the cluster used. Similar to Joshi and Thomson [22], we could not detect activated molecular adsorption of ethane on GaH Zs corresponding to the earlier-considered structure IV (Fig. 4). This is most likely connected to the fact that GaH+2 ion is much more strongly coordinated with the basic lattice oxygens of Zs than with those of Zd cluster model. Hence, coor- dination of ethane with the low-coordinated gallium ion cannot even partially compensate for the loss of energy due to Ga O bond breaking, which is necessary for the formation of the
C2H6...GaH+2 activated adsorption complex. This agrees well
with a much higher activation barrier for the alkyl CH bond dissociation. As follows from Table 5, the energy cost of the re- 82

action (4) is 42 kJ/mol higher in the GaH Zs site than in the GaH Zd site, ZGaH+2Z+ C2H6 [HGaC2H5]+Z+ H+Z-.
(4) The transition-state structure for the carbenium initial acti- vation of ethane on GaH Zs was not identified. However, the enthalpy of this process is equal to +274 kJ/mol; therefore,the activation energy would be expected to be higher than this value. This then significantly exceeds the value of the activation energy calculated for the alkyl pathway. Taking into account the results of Section 3.4, the latter process seems to be more fa- vorable over GaH+2 ions independent of the distance between charge-compensating [AlO2]anionic sites.
4. Discussion
In the present study, we considered three possible types of charge-compensating gallium species in reduced Ga/ZSM-5: Ga+, GaH2+, and GaH+2. Stability of univalent species (Ga+, GaH2+) is remarkably higher than that of GaH+2 in the case of low Al content in zeolite, that is, distantly separated framework Al atoms. In contrast, when the AlAl distance is rather small (with two aluminums located in the next-nearest positions), the presence of bivalent ions is preferred in the immediate vicin- ity of two anionic sites. The repulsive interaction between two closely situated positively charged univalent species results in strong destabilization of Ga+ and GaH2+ at such cation sites.
The fraction of cation sites containing two aluminum atoms in the next-nearest positions is small; for instance, in a zeolite with an Si:Al ratio of 25, it does not exceed 30% [43]. Thus,with regard to the results presented in Table 1, it can be con- cluded that univalent Ga+ or GaH2+ ions are the predominant charge-compensating species in high-silica gallium-exchanged zeolites, whereas GaH+2 cations can be found in only a rela- tively small portion of zeolitic cation sites, which contain two Al atoms.
It was found that at the initial step of ethane activation, all of the gallium species considered act as Lewis acids promot- ing heterolytic CH cleavage involving the basic oxygen atoms of the zeolite lattice. In Ga+ and GaH2+ active sites, this re- sults in the formation of very unstable neutral GaC2H5 and H2GaC2H5 species, respectively, as well as a Brnsted acid site, which readily either oxidizes GaC2H5 species or recom- bines with one of the hydride ions bounded to H2GaC2H5,leading to desorption of hydrogen. In both cases, at the end of the reaction, very stable [HGaC2H5]+Zspecies (II) are formed.
The catalytic cycle is closed by one-step decomposition of [HGaC2H5]+Z. It was found that simultaneous desorption of H2 and C2H4 from these species [reaction (5)] is the most favorable process. The activation energy for production of Ga+ from [HGaC2H5]+ following reaction (5) is 33 kJ/mol lower than that for regeneration of GaH2+ via desorption of ethyl- ene (6). Moreover, under the conditions of the catalytic process,due to the entropy factor, the G 823 is much lower for reac- tion (5) than for reaction (6) (74 vs. +1 kJ/mol),[HGaC2H5]+ZGa+Z+ C2H4 + H2 (5) and (6) [HGaC2H5]+ZGaH2+Z+ C2H4.
Indeed, in reaction (5), rotation of the ethyl group results in for- mation of some weak attractive interaction between an unlikely charged hydride ion and a H atom from the β-methyl group of the C2H5bound to gallium. In contrast, reaction (6) proceeds via abstraction of a hydride ion by a positively charged gallium from the same β-methyl group. This process requires signifi- cant repolarization of the CH bond involved and thus exhibits a higher activation barrier. Therefore, ethane dehydrogenation over dihydrido-gallyl ions results in their decomposition. The equilibrium concentration of GaH2+ at high temperature is very low, and hence these sites cannot be considered responsible for ethane dehydrogenation. This finding is in agreement with the recent experimental results [16] indicating decomposition of GaH2+ ions in the catalytic process.
According to the results presented above on the reactivity of GaH+2 species, these species do not play a significant role as active sites in the reaction considered. In addition, the mech- anism of ethane activation proposed by Joshi and Thomson [22] is disputable. Those authors suggested that gallium in such species acts as a hydride ion acceptor and that the CH bond polarization follows a carbenium mechanism (Cδ+Hδ);however, the activated molecular adsorption of ethane, which precedes CH cleavage, results in the opposite CδHδ+ po- larization. Note that this finding is in line with the higher elec- tronegativity of carbon with respect to hydrogen (2.5 vs. 2.1 in the Pauling scale [44]). It is obvious that subsequent disso- ciative adsorption of ethane should follow the alkyl mecha- nism leading to formation of the intermediate product [HGa
C2H5]+Z.
It is also noticeable that the GaH+2 species are isolobal to Zn+2 ions. This is reflected in the similarities of both the geom- etry and the charge properties of the zeolitic cation sites con- taining corresponding species (Table 1), as well as their chem- ical properties. Recently, it was shown experimentally [42,45] and theoretically [41] that the alkyl pathway of hydrocarbon dehydrogenation over zinc-exchanged zeolites is much more fa- vorable than the carbenium pathway. The same conclusion follows directly from the calculations presented for GaH+2 ions exchanged in zeolite independently on the distance between charge-compensating [AlO2]framework units. The reactivity of either Ga+ or GaH2+ in hydrocarbon activation exhibits very slight dependence on the distribution of aluminum in zeolite. In contrast, the GaH+2 stabilized in the cation site containing two anionic sites in the same zeolitic ring is much less active than that in the charge-alternating cation site.
Summarizing the foregoing results, we can conclude that univalent Ga+ ions at cation sites of high-silica zeolites are the most probable active species for the hydrocarbon dehy- drogenation reaction. The apparent activation barrier for this process estimated within the model used is equal to 233 kJ/mol.
To the best of our knowledge, no experimental data are avail- able on the activation energies for alkane dehydrogenation over well-defined gallium-exchanged zeolites. However, the appar- ent activation barrier estimated for ethane dehydrogenation over
E.A. Pidko et al. / Journal of Catalysis 240 (2006) 7384
83 Ga2O3/HZSM-5 [46] is significantly lower (163 kJ/mol) than this value. This disagreement is most likely due to the imper- fection of the model used. Indeed, it does not take into account the electrostatic field of the zeolite cage, which can signifi- cantly stabilize polar transition state structures [47] involved in this process. Moreover, physical adsorption of ethane (20 30 kJ/mol) due to dispersive interactions between the hydro- carbon molecule and zeolitic walls, which cannot be correctly estimated by DFT, also decreases apparent activation energy compared with the true one.
5. Conclusion
The reaction mechanism of ethane dehydrogenation was in- vestigated using DFT calculations for various reduced-gallium sites in Ga/ZSM-5. The probable catalytic cycle starts with the heterolytic CH bond cleavage involving exchanged univalent gallium cation and a basic oxygen atom of the zeolite frame- work. The low energy of the d-orbitals of Ga+ and its occupied s-orbital that make them unable to donate or accept electrons,respectively, from the hydrocarbon result in a high barrier for the direct oxidative addition of ethane to the cation. Therefore,heterolytic splitting of the CH bond is much more favorable due to the polarization induced by the interaction of the hy- drocarbon with the Ga...O Lewis acidbase pair. The result- ing product easily rearranges to form [HGaC2H5]+, which decomposes via simultaneous desorption of H2 and C2H4, re- generating the initial Ga+ species. The overall activation bar- rier for C2H6 dehydrogenation over Ga+Zsites is equal to 233 kJ/mol.
Hydrogenated gallium species (GaH2+Zand ZGaH+2Z) are less likely active sites. Decomposition of the dihydrido- gallyl ions, resulting in formation of univalent gallium ions during the catalytic cycle, is significantly favored over regen- eration of GaH2+ sites. In addition, the estimated overall acti- vation barrier for the considered catalytic reaction is higher (by 58 kJ/mol) for GaH2+ sites than for Ga+ sites.
Bivalent GaH+2 species stabilized at the cation site with dis- tantly separated framework Al sites exhibit significantly higher initial activity for ethane activation but much lower stability compared with Ga+ sites. However, initial heterolytic cleav- age of the CH bond results in formation of [HGaC2H5]+ ions that preferentially follow the reaction path, again leading to univalent gallium cations.
On the other hand, GaH+2 ions charge-compensating two proximate framework aluminum ions are the most stable cationic species; however, initial activation of the CH bond over these sites is strongly disfavored both thermodynamically and kinetically. In contrast, the reactivity of univalent gallium species exchanged in zeolite depends only slightly on the rela- tive position of zeolitic anionic sites ([AlO2]units).
