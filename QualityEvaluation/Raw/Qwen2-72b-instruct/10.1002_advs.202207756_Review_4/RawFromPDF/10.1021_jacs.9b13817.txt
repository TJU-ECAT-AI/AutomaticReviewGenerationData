Abstract
We combine experiment and theory to investigate the cooperation or competition between organic and inorganic structure-directing agents (SDAs) for occupancy within microporous voids of chabazite (CHA) zeolites and to rationalize the effects of SDA siting on biasing the framework Al arrangement (Al–O(−Si–O)x–Al, x = 1–3) among CHA zeolites of essentially fixed composition (Si/Al = 15). CHA zeolites crystallized using mixtures of TMAda+ and Na+ contain one TMAda+ occluded per cage and Na+ co-occluded in an amount linearly proportional to the number of 6-MR paired Al sites, quantified by Co2+ titration. In contrast, CHA zeolites crystallized using mixtures of TMAda+ and K+ provide evidence that three K+ cations, on average, displace one TMAda+ from occupying a cage and contain predominantly 6-MR isolated Al sites. Moreover, CHA crystallizes from synthesis media containing more than 10-fold higher inorganic-to-organic ratios with K+ than with Na+ before competing crystalline phases form, providing a route to decrease the amount of organic SDA needed to crystallize high-silica CHA. Density functional theory calculations show that differences in the ionic radii of Na+ and K+ determine their preferences for siting in different CHA rings, which influences their energy to co-occlude with TMAda+ and stabilize different Al configurations. Monte Carlo models confirm that energy differences resulting from Na+ or K+ co-occlusion promote the formation of 6-MR and 8-MR paired Al arrangements, respectively. These results highlight opportunities to exploit using mixtures of organic and inorganic SDAs during zeolite crystallization in order to more efficiently use organic SDAs and influence framework Al arrangements.

1. Introduction
Zeolites provide a convenient platform for tailored materials design because their well-defined crystalline frameworks facilitate connecting data and insights from experimental and theoretical assessments of material structure and function. (1) Monte Carlo simulations of silica polymerization have shown that both the volume occupied by organic structure-directing agents (SDAs) and the attractive forces between the SDA and lattice oxygen atoms are important for stabilizing microporous voids during crystallization from monomeric silica precursors. (2−4) Libraries of potential organic SDA molecules have been generated in silico to identify more efficient synthesis routes to known zeolite frameworks or new synthetic routes to prepare zeolite frameworks that have been predicted to be stable by theory. (5−7) Such theory-guided materials discovery approaches have recently been used to synthesize new organic SDAs for the AEI, (8) SFW, (9) and STW (10) zeolite frameworks, as well as to synthesize the first enantiomerically enriched samples of a chiral zeolite framework (STW). (5,11) Organic SDAs that mimic transition state structures of a specific reaction have also been designed computationally and used to guide synthesis of a zeolite framework that promotes a desired chemical transformation. (12)
The catalytic properties of zeolites are defined both by their framework connectivity and by the arrangement of their framework Al atoms and associated charge-compensating cations. Chabazite (CHA) zeolites are high-symmetry frameworks comprising single symmetry-distinct tetrahedral sites (T-sites) organized into ABC-stacked double six-membered ring (6-MR) secondary building units. Only one type of isolated Al configuration is possible in the CHA framework given its single unique T-site, but proximal Al site ensembles (Al–O(−Si–O)x–Al) are present at finite Si/Al ratios. Paired Al site ensembles (x = 1, 2) in a 6-MR are distinguished by their ability to host divalent Co2+ and Cu2+ cations and thus can be quantified by saturation Co2+ and Cu2+ uptakes. (13−16) Distinct Al site ensembles in CHA have been linked to differences in turnover rates for methanol dehydration to dimethyl ether (per H+, 415 K), (17) time-on-stream stability for methanol-to-olefin catalysis (623 K), (18−20) CO2 adsorption equilibrium constants, (21) and the speciation of extraframework cationic Cu (14,16,22−29) and Fe (30,31) complexes that mediate partial methane oxidation (PMO) to methanol (31,32) and selective catalytic reduction (SCR) of NOx with NH3. (33) Within the context of NOx SCR on Cu-CHA, framework Al arrangements determine not only the speciation of isolated Cu2+ and [CuOH]+ sites, (16) which have been linked to different hydrothermal aging (34,35) and sulfur poisoning (36−39) behavior, but also the spatial density of isolated Cu sites, which has been shown to influence the kinetics of SCR redox cycles. (40−43) Thus, synthetic protocols that purposefully influence the arrangement of heteroatoms substituted in zeolite frameworks, and theoretical models of SDA–framework interactions that can aid in developing such protocols, would open opportunities to prepare zeolites with tailored catalytic and adsorption properties.
Cationic SDA molecules facilitate the substitution of anionic AlO2– tetrahedral units for framework SiO4/2 tetrahedral units during zeolite crystallization (44,45) and have been proposed to influence the siting of Al at specific crystallographically distinct T-site locations based on the proximity between cationic charges in the SDA and anionic lattice AlO2– centers. (45−50) Supercell density functional theory (DFT) calculations show that the energies of occluded organic cations (e.g., N,N,N-trimethyl-1-adamantylammonium, TMAda+), (19,51,52) inorganic cations (e.g., Cu2+ or Na+), (15,52−54) or protons (53,55) show a strong dependence on the proximity of Al sites in the CHA framework and that these energetic interactions have a predominant electrostatic component. (15,51) The effects of mixtures of organic and inorganic SDA cations on the energetics of framework Al arrangements, however, are not as well understood. Organic SDA cations are used in crystallization of high-silica (Si/Al > 7) zeolites to provide electrostatic balance for anionic lattice charges while stabilizing siliceous portions of the zeolite lattice via dispersive interactions (2,56−58) to help guide crystallization toward the desired crystal phase. (7) The formation of denser crystal phases tends to be inhibited by organic SDAs because they adsorb at growing crystallite surfaces, minimizing the surface area available for Ostwald ripening toward structures of higher framework density, a function that is often not fulfilled by inorganic cations alone, especially at high Si/Al ratios. (56,58) Incorporation of alkali cations during zeolite crystallization has been used to influence the crystal morphology of MFI, (59) to spatially bias Al incorporation in FAU (60) and CHA, (19) and to influence the arrangement of Al sites in MFI zeolites among voids of different size (straight and sinusoidal channels and their intersections) (50,61−63) and between isolated and paired Al site configurations. (13,64)
Previously, we have reported that CHA zeolites (Si/Al = 15) crystallized from synthesis media containing only low charge-density organic cations (TMAda+) as the SDA contain predominantly 6-MR isolated Al sites, (14) a consequence of adamantyl groups (∼0.7 nm diameter) that impose steric constraints that limit the occupation of each CHA cage (∼0.7 nm diameter) to only one TMAda+. (65) Supercell DFT calculations show that each CHA cage can host one TMAda+, which is rotationally mobile about its vertical axis and imposes only weak energetic preference for Al location among different T-sites within the cage when solvents (e.g., water) are present. (51) Recent supercell DFT calculations reveal that Na+ adopts a site within a double 6-MR of CHA when co-occluded with TMAda+ and is located near two AlO2– within the same 6-MR. (19,52) Partial replacement of TMAda+ with Na+ in synthesis media (0 < Na+/TMAda+ < 2), while holding other synthesis variables constant (OH–/Si = 0.5, (Na+ + TMAda+)/Si = 0.5, H2O/Si = 44, Si/Al = 15), crystallizes CHA zeolites (Si/Al = 15) that contain one TMAda+ occluded per cage, as measured by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), but varying amounts of occluded Na+ that correlate linearly with the number of 6-MR paired Al sites, as measured by saturation Co2+ exchange. (14,17) Increasing the Na+/TMAda+ ratio above 2, under these synthesis conditions, resulted in a phase transformation to MOR, likely reflecting a preference to form a higher density framework to satisfy electrostatic constraints imposed by the average charge density of the synthesis medium. (14,58,66−68) These prior experiments in which CHA zeolites are crystallized with Na+ and TMAda+ as co-SDAs provide strong evidence for the dominant influence of local charge density among occluded cationic SDAs on the ensembles of anionic framework Al centers that are formed as long as amorphous Al sources are used, as recent studies have reported that Al site arrangements preassembled in structured Al sources (e.g., FAU-type zeolites) can be preserved during interzeolite conversion (69,70) and provide routes to synthesize CHA zeolites using higher Na+/TMAda+ ratios. (65)
Here, we investigate the influence of alkali cation size on the arrangement of framework Al sites in CHA, by comparing the effects of using Na+ and K+ cations as the alkali source. The use of K+ in synthesis media containing TMAda+ is found to crystallize CHA zeolites from solutions containing alkali-to-organic ratios >10× greater than is possible with Na+ before phase transitions to competing zeolite phases are observed. (14) The incorporation of K+ within crystalline CHA products preferentially forms 6-MR isolated Al sites, in sharp contrast to the incorporation of Na+ that preferentially forms 6-MR paired Al sites. (14) Moreover, the total amount of TMAda+ occluded within the crystalline CHA products decreases with increasing K+ incorporation, in contrast to the co-occlusion of Na+ and TMAda+ within a given CHA cage unit, providing evidence that alkali cations of different size can either cooperate or compete with organic SDAs for occupation of void spaces, with attendant consequences for the framework Al arrangement. Supercell DFT models show that co-occlusion of Na+ with TMAda+ in a single CHA cage is energetically favorable, while co-occlusion of K+ with TMAda+ is energetically unfavorable. These models further show that, when co-occluded with TMAda+, Na+ and K+ influence differently the energies of distinct framework Al–Al ensembles. In particular, Na+ co-occlusion favors and K+ disfavors the second and third nearest neighbor (2NN, 3NN) 6-MR paired Al sites, which are the preferred exchange sites for bare Co2+ and Cu2+ ions. This combined experimental and theoretical approach rationalizes the cooperative and competitive interactions between organic and inorganic SDAs used in the crystallization of CHA zeolites and the consequences of these interactions on promoting the formation of particular framework Al arrangements.
2. Results and Discussion
2.1. Crystallization of CHA Zeolites Using Na+ or K+ as Alkali Co-SDAs with TMAda+
Quantitative descriptions of the number of Al sites located in different framework Al–Al site ensembles require access to validated characterization methods that are sensitive to such Al–Al arrangements. Framework Al sites that generate a proton were detected by chemical titration by NH3 to form NH4+ and subsequently quantified upon evolution of NH3 during temperature-programmed desorption (TPD). (71) The number of 6-MR paired Al sites in CHA zeolites were quantified by Co2+ and Cu2+ titration, as both bare Cu2+ and Co2+ cations exchange with comparable relative energies and with a strong preference for paired Al site ensembles (2NN, 3NN) within the same 6-MR (i.e., 2 Al per 6-MR), as shown in our prior work (additional details in Section S.1, Supporting Information). (14−17) The fraction of Al located within 6-MR paired Al site ensembles was taken as twice the saturation Co2+ uptake (2 × Co/Al). The difference between the total number of framework Al sites and those present within 6-MR Al–Al pair ensembles was taken as the number of 6-MR isolated Al sites (i.e., 1 Al per 6-MR).
As a point of reference, we developed a statistical model to estimate the fraction of Al in 6-MR pairs expected as a function of Si/Al ratio, assuming that Al are distributed randomly among T-sites in the CHA lattice but never in first-nearest-neighbor configurations (Löwenstein’s rule (72)). (22) We chose this criterion because Löwenstein’s rule has been empirically observed to hold for laboratory-synthesized zeolites (especially for zeolites with Si/Al > 1) and because it rationalized the fraction of Al in 6-MR pairs measured by divalent cation (Co2+, Cu2+) titration in our (14) and other prior work (18) for CHA samples crystallized with varying Si/Al using equimolar ratios of Na+ and TMAda+ (triangles, Figure 1a).

Fraction of Al in 6-MR pairs, as measured by Co2+ titration, in H–CHA samples of similar composition (Si/Al = 14–17) plotted against (a) the number of Al in 6-MR pairs predicted for a random Al distribution subject to Löwenstein’s rule at the Si/Al ratio for each sample (22) and (b) the amount of Na+ occluded on the crystalline CHA products. Samples were synthesized with Al(OH)3 and Na+/TMAda+ = 0–2 in OH– media (solid squares) and Na+/TMAda+ = 0 in F– media (open circle) or with Al(O-i-Pr)3 with Na+/TMAda+ = 1 (open squares) and Na+/TMAda+ = 0 (open diamond). Samples synthesized with Na+/TMAda+ = 0 or 1 are indicated in (a), along with samples synthesized with Na+/TMAda+ = 1 at different Si/Al ratios previously by Di Iorio et al. (gray triangles) (14) and Deimund et al. (open triangles). (18) Dashed lines denote parity lines of slope (a) 1 and (b) 2, while the dotted line in (b) is a linear regression to the data (slope of 1.45).
As shown in Figure 1a, CHA zeolites can be crystallized at essentially fixed framework composition (e.g., Si/Al = 14–17), but with varying 6-MR paired Al content, by varying the Na+/TMAda+ ratio used during crystallization while holding all other synthesis variables constant. (14) We recently reported that the choice of Al precursor used during CHA crystallization is an additional parameter that influences the formation of 6-MR paired Al sites. (17) Here, two additional CHA zeolites were synthesized using aluminum isopropoxide (Al(O-i-Pr)3) and equimolar amounts of Na+ and TMAda+. These samples corroborate the finding that using Al(O-i-Pr)3 as the Al precursor results in CHA zeolites that contain nearly 40% of their Al atoms in 6-MR Al–Al pair arrangements (open squares, Figure 1a, details in Section S.2, Supporting Information), nearly twice the number that would be expected for a statistically random Al distribution obeying Löwenstein’s rule (18% of Al located within 6-MR pairs) in CHA zeolites of this composition (Si/Al = 15). (16,73) CHA zeolites crystallized in synthesis media containing only TMAda+ as the SDA, but in the presence of Al(O-i-Pr)3, do not contain detectable quantities of 6-MR paired Al sites (open diamond, Figure 1a, details in Section S.2, Supporting Information), consistent with previous observations of CHA synthesized using only TMAda+ and aluminum hydroxide (Al(OH)3) as the Al source (Co/Al < 0.01 when Na+/TMAda+ = 0 for Al(OH)3 or Al(O-i-Pr)3). (14)
Thus, the presence of Na+ in CHA synthesis media leads to the formation of 6-MR paired Al sites, irrespective of the amorphous Al precursor or mineralizing agent (OH–, F–) used, (17) indicating that the SDA cations used to crystallize CHA are dominant factors that determine Al siting. The number of framework Al sites located in 6-MR paired configurations increases linearly with the total amount of Na+ occluded within the crystalline CHA products (Figure 1b). Importantly, not every occluded Na+ cation leads to the formation of a 6-MR paired Al site, as indicated by the deviation of the linear regression (dotted line, slope = 1.45; Figure 1b) from the expectation of parity (dashed line, slope = 2; Figure 1b). Taken together, these results suggest that cooperative interactions between organic TMAda+ cations and certain inorganic alkali cations (e.g., Na+) bias toward the formation of 6-MR paired Al sites during CHA crystallization.
We further investigated this hypothesis by using K+ instead of Na+ as the alkali SDA, together with TMAda+ as the organic SDA, to guide the crystallization of CHA zeolites. K+ is known to suppress the formation of certain crystal phases (e.g., BEA, (74) MFI (75)) and to promote the formation of CHA over competing phases (e.g., PHI, OFF). (76) K+ is also known to facilitate the crystallization of low-silica CHA (Si/Al < 5) from FAU precursors in the absence of organic SDAs, (77−80) an interzeolite transformation that is accessible with Na+ only when using high concentrations of seed CHA crystals (∼10 wt % seed on an SiO2 basis). (81) These observations suggest that K+ should be able to guide crystallization toward CHA, but perhaps with different consequences than Na+ for the resulting framework Al arrangements that are formed.
The synthesis of high-silica CHA (Si/Al = 15) zeolites with K+ in the presence of TMAda+ was performed by adapting procedures to do so using different Na+/TMAda+ ratios, (14) but substituting KOH for NaOH in synthesis media (OH–/Si = 0.5, (K+ + TMAda+)/Si = 0.5, H2O/Si = 44, Si/Al = 15; additional details in Section S.2, Supporting Information). Synthesis media containing K+/TMAda+ ≤ 20 crystallized CHA without detectable phase impurities based on X-ray diffraction (XRD) data (Figure 2, left). Increasing the K+/TMAda+ ratio beyond 20 resulted in the formation of MFI (K+/TMAda+ up to ∞; Section S.3, Supporting Information), which can be synthesized solely in the presence of alkali cations. (82) This composition dependence reflects the role of TMAda+ in directing crystallization toward CHA, as K+ alone is unable to crystallize high-silica CHA under the synthesis conditions reported here. The replacement of Na+ with K+, however, enables CHA to crystallize from solutions that contain more than an order of magnitude higher alkali/TMAda+ ratios (MOR is observed at Na/TMAda > 2; (14) Section S.3, Supporting Information). These results highlight the different capacities of different alkali cations to act as co-SDAs with TMAda+  (58) and reflect the tendency of K+ to suppress the formation of undesired phases, as previously suggested for the synthesis of IFR zeolites from mixtures of K+ and benzyl mono- and diazabicyclo complexes.

SEM micrographs of CHA zeolites (Figure 2, right) synthesized at K+/TMAda+ < 10 are composed of cubic crystals ranging in size from 4 to 8 μm and are of similar composition (Table 1). CHA samples synthesized with K+/TMAda+ > 10, however, are composed of a mixture of two distinct crystalline CHA phases that differ markedly in size and composition (Table 1), indicating that a low-silica K-rich CHA phase (Si/Al < 8, K+/Al > 1.5) begins to form in parallel to the high-silica CHA phase that is the dominant crystal product formed from synthesis solutions containing K+/TMAda+ < 10 (Si/Al > 10, K+/Al < 0.70). Three replicate syntheses performed at K+/TMAda+ = 15 resulted in crystallization of products with XRD patterns containing broad diffraction features around 25.5–26° (details in Section S.3, Supporting Information), suggesting the onset of a parallel CHA crystallization process that forms crystallites of distinct morphology. This observation is consistent with refinement of XRD data indicating that CHA synthesized with K+/TMAda+ < 10 are nearly phase-pure high-silica CHA, but that only 66% of the material synthesized from solutions containing a K+/TMAda+ = 20 is composed of a high-silica CHA phase (details in Section S.3, Supporting Information). Elemental analyses of these two distinct CHA phases by energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) show that the high-silica CHA phase (Section S.4, Supporting Information) has an elemental composition similar to other CHA samples synthesized with K+/TMAda+ < 10 (Table 1).

Nearly all CHA zeolites synthesized using K+ contain visible defects (Figure 2, additional details in Section S.4, Supporting Information) that appear to be mesopores, which are not observed in CHA synthesized without alkali (TMAda+ only) or from Na+ and TMAda+ mixtures (Section S.4, Supporting Information). (17) Ar adsorption–desorption isotherms (87 K) reveal that CHA synthesized from K+/TMAda+ = 2 has a micropore volume similar to CHA synthesized from various mixtures of TMAda+ and Na+ (0.19 cm3 g–1) (14,18) and undetectable mesoporosity, evident in the absence of desorption hysteresis (isotherms and tabulated micropore volumes in Section S.5, Supporting Information). (83,84) In contrast, CHA synthesized with K+/TMAda+ = 15 has significantly lower micropore volume than expected for CHA (0.06 cm3 g–1) and displays type-H4 desorption hysteresis (step-down at P/P0 ≈ 0.4; isotherm in Section S.5, Supporting Information), which is consistent with the micropore volume of CHA zeolites prepared via FAU-to-CHA interzeolite conversion routes from alkali-only synthesis media (0.094 cm3 g–1). (81) These results indicate the presence of disordered mesopores (83−85) possibly formed by defects introduced from an excessive cationic charge density ((TMAda+ + K+)/Al > 1; Table 2) or from adsorption within the secondary phase.

2.2. Competitive and Cooperative Occlusion of Alkali and Organic Co-SDAs within CHA
CHA zeolites crystallized from mixtures of Na+ and TMAda+ contained one TMAda+ occluded per cage (∼20–22 wt % organic measured by TGA), (14,18,65) independent of the amount of residual Na+ that was also co-occluded within crystalline products, in compositions ranging from 0 to 0.3 occluded Na+ cations per cage (Figure 3, closed squares). (14,17) In sharp contrast, among CHA zeolites crystallized from mixtures of K+ and TMAda+, the occupancy of TMAda+ systematically decreased from 1 to 0.5 per cage as the amount of K+ retained within crystalline products increased from 0 to 1.2 per cage (Figure 3, Table 2). The negative correlation observed between the occluded TMAda+ and K+ content within crystalline CHA products (slope = −0.37, Figure 3) suggests that three K+ cations on average displace one TMAda+ from a CHA cage and that the occlusion of K+ assists in stabilizing the CHA framework down to a limit of 0.5 TMAda+ per cage (Figure 3). While the total Al content increases systematically with increasing K+ content (Si/Al = 16 to 10; Table 2), the presence of excess cationic charges relative to the anionic charges introduced by framework Al (e.g., (K++TMAda+)/Al > 1, Table 2) suggests that additional anionic lattice defects are present in as-made zeolites (estimated defects per unit cell; Table 2), (86) although the available data do not allow determining the fate of these defects on zeolites after high-temperature oxidative treatments or ion-exchange procedures. Titration of protons by aqueous NH4+ ion exchange show that CHA zeolites synthesized with K+/TMAda+ < 10 contain nearly all of their Al in framework positions (27Al and 29Si MAS NMR data in Section S.9, Supporting Information), but that further increasing the K+/TMAda+ ratio leads to higher fractions of Al that are unable to stabilize NH4+ cations, possibly reflecting the formation of extraframework Al and other defect sites (Table 2).

Dotted (slope = −0.37) and dashed (slope = 0) lines are regressions to K+ (circles) and Na+ (squares) data sets, respectively.
We next turn to DFT calculations (computational details described in Section S.10, Supporting Information) to contrast the ability of Na+ and K+ to become co-occluded (“co-caged”) with TMAda+ within voids of CHA, following the scheme shown in Figure 4. When charge balancing is provided by framework AlO2–, the energy of co-caging is potentially a function of Al proximity. For each of the five symmetry-distinct proximal Al ensembles (excluding −O–Al–O–Al–O– ensembles, which would violate Löwenstein’s rule) that are present in a 12 T-site supercell (shown in Figure S.24a, Section S.10, Supporting Information), the formation energy of a co-caged alkali and TMAda+ cation was calculated by referencing lowest energy structures to the energies of TMAda+ and either Na+ or K+ hosted in isolation in their respective lowest energy configurations in supercells of the same size. In isolation, TMAda+ preferentially orients along the long axis of the CHA cage, (51,52) Na+ sites with equal energy in 6-MR and 8-MR locations, while K+ preferentially sites within larger 8-MR locations. For each paired Al ensemble and alkali cation, energies were computed considering two TMAda+ orientations and alkali present in either 6-MR or 8-MR locations and near AlO2– sites. The lowest energy configurations are shown in Figure 4 (full results are reported in Table S.7, Section S.10, Supporting Information, and CONTCARs of all structures included in SI.zip). Na+-TMAda+ co-caging energies (ΔENa-co-caging) are negative for all Al pair ensembles except for one (Figure 4). Given that AlO2– sites are electrostatically repulsive in the absence of charge-balancing cations, (15) these results reflect the ability of Na+ and TMAda+ together to screen such repulsion. Energies are sensitive to Al configuration, and the lowest energy ensemble corresponds to two AlO2– in the same 6-MR, consistent with observed bias toward 6-MR paired Al sites in CHA zeolites that contain co-occluded Na+ and TMAda+. (14,17) In contrast, K+-TMAda+ co-caging energies (ΔEK-co-caging) are approximately 0.2 eV greater than Na+-TMAda+ co-caging energies and are positive for all but one Al–Al ensemble (Figure 4). These results, in part, reflect the different siting preferences of Na+ and K+. Na+ (ionic radius: 1.16 Å) occupies the more confining 6-MR site (1.3 Å radius) in all but the highest energy configurations, as illustrated at the bottom left of Figure 4, retaining the same 4-fold coordination to framework oxygens. In contrast, larger K+ cations (ionic radius: 1.52 Å) always prefer to occupy an 8-MR site (1.9 Å radius) and otherwise are forced into a double 6-MR (d6r) unit and suffer from strong energetic penalties when placed at a 6-MR site. Co-caging energies were recalculated to test the contribution of steric factors to the energy differences by replacing Al with Si, N with C, and Na+ or K+ with Ne or Ar, respectively, and then relaxing the supercell. The energy for co-caging Ne (atomic radius: 1.55 Å) is 0.2 eV less than that for Ar (atomic radius: 1.88 Å), which is close to the energy offset in Figure 4, indicating that the difference in ionic size between Na+ and K+ is the predominant factor in determining their respective preferences for siting within 6-MR or 8-MR locations and, in turn, their ability to become co-caged with TMAda+. These results are consistent with the experimental observation that Na+ co-occludes with, but K+ competes with, TMAda+ for occlusion of void space within the CHA framework (Figure 3).

2.3. Influence of Alkali and Organic Co-SDA Siting on Framework Al Arrangement
We previously observed that the number of 6-MR paired Al sites in CHA synthesized with Na+ increased as the total amount of Na+ retained on the crystalline product increased (Figure 1b). (14,17) In sharp contrast, the total amount of K+ retained on crystalline CHA zeolites does not correlate with the number of 6-MR Al pairs (Table 2, Figure 3). At low K+/TMAda+ ratios in the synthesis medium (K+/TMAda+ < 2; K+/cage < 0.4), the occlusion of K+ resulted in the formation of a small fraction of 6-MR paired Al sites, but in lower amounts (Co/Al = 0.05) than for CHA synthesized with mixtures of Na+ and TMAda+ (Co/Al = 0.10). (14,17) As the K+/TMAda+ ratio in the synthesis solution increased (K+/TMAda+ > 2) and the occluded K+ content in the crystalline CHA product increased concomitantly (K+/cage > 0.4), only 6-MR isolated Al sites were formed. This behavior is markedly different from that of Na+, which we previously proposed to reflect occlusion of Na+ within 6-MR voids that are not occupied by TMAda+, so as to result in the stabilization of two proximal anionic charges in a 6-MR paired Al configuration. (14)
Supercell DFT calculations were again used to differentiate the effects of Na+ and K+ to bias toward different paired Al configurations. The results in Figure 4 betray differences between Na+ and K+ that are consistent with a tendency for Na+ to promote the formation of 6-MR Al pairs, but the small supercell sizes, high Al content, and multiple concurrent Al ensembles across the periodic images preclude drawing firm conclusions about individual ensembles. To avoid these complications, a complementary set of calculations were performed in which co-cations and Al ensembles are isolated within a larger 96 T-site supercell (supercell model shown in Figure S.24b, Section S.10, Supporting Information) that is constructed of 9 CHA cages, only one of which contains the two Al sites of interest. A single TMAda+ cation was placed in the Al-containing cage, and 31 symmetry-distinct Al–Al configurations, in which both Al are in positions belonging to that same cage, were considered in order to reduce the configurational space (a scheme providing further details is available in Figure S.25, Section S.10, Supporting Information). These configurations can be distinguished by whether the Al atoms share a common 4-MR, 6-MR, or 8-MR or exist in different 6-MRs of the same d6r prism. Alkali cations were placed at locations in the 6-MR or 8-MR near framework oxygens connected to Al atoms, and then the full supercell was relaxed.
Figure 5 reports DFT-computed total energies of relaxed TMAda+/Na+ co-occluded supercells, consistent in local composition with that inferred for CHA crystallized in the presence of both organic and inorganic SDAs. Energies are reported as a function of Al–Al configuration, with Na+ in its lowest energy site and referenced to the global energy minimum for Na+. Also reported in Figure 5 are the results of an identical analysis for co-occluded TMAda+/K+. The full set of structures and energies is shown in Section S.10 of the Supporting Information (Table S.8, Figures S.26, S.27), and all CONTCARs are included in SI.zip. Na+ co-caging energies for the third nearest neighbor (3NN) 6-MR ensemble are consistent between the 12 and 96 T-site supercell results, so that TMAda+/Na+ co-caging is energetically favorable relative to cations isolated in separate cages. In contrast, TMAda+/K+ co-caging energies in the 3NN 6-MR ensemble are even less favorable in the larger supercell model (+0.11 eV vs −0.05 eV in the 96 and 12 T-site models, respectively). The TMAda+/K+ co-caging results thus represent the potential biasing influences of likely only a minority of co-caged cations within laboratory-synthesized samples.

Figure 5. PBE+D3-computed energy of 96 T-site supercells with one cage occluded by TMAda+ and either Na+ or K+, referenced to the lowest energy arrangement, sorted and colored by connectivity distance of an Al–Al arrangement. Structures and optimized alkali location are shown for lowest energy Al–Al arrangements (TMAda+ hidden for better visualization). The structural units containing two Al ensembles are coded as 4, 4-MR; 6, 6-MR; 8, 8-MR; D, d6r unit, and each structure is presented in greater detail in Section S.10 of the Supporting Information. Atom color codes: yellow: Si, green: Al, red: O, black: Na, purple: K.
A number of observations can be extracted from Figure 5. Energies span 1.4 eV across both Na+/TMAda+ and K+/TMAda+ configurations, reflecting a strong sensitivity of the lattice energy to the arrangement of each Al–Al ensemble. Moreover, Na+ and K+ exhibit different site preferences and relative energies within those ensembles. Na+ prefers to locate within a 6-MR or d6r site in ensembles that contain two Al within these structural units, including the lowest energy Na+/TMAda+ configuration shown in Figure 5, consistent with observations from the 12 T-site supercell model (Figure 4). In the case of an isolated Al atom within an 8-MR, a configuration that is not uniquely distinguishable within the 12 T-site model, Na+ prefers to remain in the 8-MR. In contrast, K+ prefers occlusion within the 8-MR for nearly all distinct Al ensembles, except those in which two Al atoms are located in opposite 6-MRs across the same d6r.
The relative energies of the TMAda+/Na+ and TMAda+/K+ co-occluded lattices generally decrease with increasing connectivity distance (xNN), which we define as one less than the number of intervening Al–O or Si–O bonds along the shortest path between two Al sites. The uniformly large energies for first nearest-neighbor ensembles (1NN; Al–O–Al) are consistent with the observation of Löwenstein’s rule that 1NN Al pairs are not present in laboratory-synthesized zeolites, suggesting that ineffective charge screening during the crystallization process may underlie this rule. Second nearest-neighbor (2NN) ensembles are also greater in energy than the energy minimum, especially when two Al atoms share a 4-MR, consistent with 29Si NMR evidence that Q4(2Al) sites (−101 ppm; Si(OAl)2(OSi)2) are not observed. (14) The energies of 1NN, 2NN 6-MR, and 3NN 6-MR configurations are directionally consistent with recently reported DFT results computed in smaller 36 T-site supercells. (52) The differences between Na+ and K+ as co-occluding cations are most pronounced among the 3NN and fourth nearest-neighbor (4NN) ensembles. All 3NN Na+-containing ensembles are relatively low in energy, except d6r combinations, and the 3NN 6-MR ensemble is one of the two minimum energy configurations, along with one particular 3NN 8-MR ensemble. 3NN Al atoms in the same 6-MR minimize the energy of Na+/TMAda+ combinations in both the 12 and 96 T-site supercells, are nearly isostructural in the presence of both alkali cations, and have similarly large and negative co-caging energies relative to isolated, energy-minimizing cations in the same sized supercell (−0.35 and −0.30 eV in the 12 and 96 T-site models, respectively). The 3NN 8-MR ensembles cannot be represented within the 12 T-site model, but several are found in the 96 T-site supercell to be similar in energy to the 3NN 6-MR ensemble. 4NN 8-MR and d6r Na+/TMAda+ ensembles are somewhat higher in energy than the 3NN 6-MR configuration. All of these observations are qualitatively consistent with the role of Na+ to promote the formation of 3NN Al pair ensembles, and 6-MR ensembles in general, when co-occluded with TMAda+.
The 96 T-site supercell model yields a positive ΔEK-co-caging value of about 0.1 eV for the 3NN 6-MR ensemble. Several configurations in which K+ is sited within 3NN or 4NN 8-MR ensembles are 0.5 eV lower in energy than in the 3NN 6-MR ensemble. The lone low-energy 4NN K+/TMAda+ configuration in Figure 5 contains two Al in an 8-MR (structure shown in Figure 5). Several 3NN 6-MR and d6r ensembles are strongly disfavored in the presence of K+, including notably the 3NN in 6-MR, which is 0.47 eV above the minimum energy ensemble, in stark contrast to the Na+ case. K+/TMAda+, on the other hand, shows equal preference for 3NN and 4NN 8-MR ensembles. These observations are qualitatively consistent with a tendency of K+ to bias against 6-MR Al pair ensembles and to potentially bias toward 8-MR Al pair ensembles, which have favorable co-caging energies within the 96 T-site model.
While these observations do not directly describe the incorporation of Al during crystallization, which is often kinetically limited (57) and sensitive to solvent effects (87) and significant long-range electrostatic interactions between extraframework cations residing in adjacent cages, they do support the experimental observations that occlusion of alkali cations of different size will alter the distribution of different Al–Al arrangements in CHA zeolites. Co-occlusion of K+, to the extent it occurs, would tend to favor formation of Al–Al sites with greater separation between adjacent Al atoms, while Na+ co-occlusion tends to favor 6-MR configurations with 2 Al atoms. To illustrate the potential impacts of the biases noted in Figure 5 on global Al distribution, we use Monte Carlo simulations to distribute Al on a CHA lattice at a fixed Si/Al ratio (Si/Al = 15) and under biases derived from those shown in Figure 5. Specifically, we contrast three different scenarios: (i) a bias in which Al atoms interact purely repulsively and decay inversely with distance, as suggested by results on an uncompensated lattice, (16) and biases extracted from the 96 T-site (ii) Na+ and (iii) K+ co-caging energies relative to RT at 433 K, chosen arbitrarily to correspond with typical zeolite synthesis conditions (simulation details are provided in Section S.11, Supporting Information). Figure 6 reports simulated Al–Al pair site probabilities relative to the purely repulsive case at Si/Al = 15. The most notable difference is for 3NN 6-MR configurations, which are strongly promoted by Na+ and predicted to be absent in the presence of K+. K+ has a greater effect on biasing toward 8-MR configurations, in particular the 4NN configurations that are absent in the presence of Na+. The increase in 2NN sites simply reflects the very low probability of such sites in the purely repulsive case.

Figure 6. Ratio of probability of different paired Al configurations under energy biases consistent with Na+ (top) and K+ (bottom) co-caging energies, relative to a bias considering purely repulsive Al–Al interactions, in a CHA lattice of Si/Al = 15. Green dots represent the position of framework Al atoms. Inset: Numerical titration of 6-MR pairs (gray bars) followed by 8-MR-3NN pairs (black bars) at Si/Al = 15 under the three considered biases. “d”, “Na+”, and “K+” represent the distance bias only (no Na+ or K+), Na+/TMAda+ energy bias, and K+/TMAda+ energy bias, respectively.
The probability to form 6-MR paired Al sites under synthetic conditions manifests in experimental samples as differences in the capacity to accommodate exchanged Co2+ (or Cu2+). To probe the corresponding influences of the theoretical energy biases shown in Figure 5 on the number of Co2+-titratable paired Al sites in experiment, we numerically titrate 6-MR Al pairs on CHA lattices equilibrated to Si/Al = 15 and subject them to the three different Al distribution biases (details in Section S.11, Supporting Information). The results are reported in the inset of Figure 6. The 6-MR columns report the fraction of Al titrated by Co2+, assuming the probabilities of Figure 5 apply to all Al sites and that Co2+ only titrates 6-MR paired sites. Such a model predicts Co2+ uptakes to be essentially zero under the distance bias, which approximates the influence of TMAda+ alone. The low density of titratable pairs under this bias is consistent with the experimental results in Figure 1. Under the Na+ bias, which approximates the influence of co-occlusion of Na+ and TMAda+, the fraction of Al in 6-MR pairs increases to 0.15. This fraction is close to that predicted from a random plus Löwenstein’s rule bias, due to compensating differences in the predicted numbers of 2NN and 3NN 6-MR pairs. Under the K+ bias, the fraction of titratable 6-MR pairs is essentially zero. To the extent that K+ does co-occlude with TMAda+, such co-occlusion is not expected to form 6-MR paired Al sites. For completeness, the 8-MR column reports the additional 3NN 8-MR pairs that would be titratable by a divalent cation after all available 6-MR pairs are titrated. The large bars for the Na+ and K+ biases reflect the corresponding prevalence of 3NN 8-MR Al pair sites under these biases. These models reinforce how SDA–framework interactions influence Al distributions and their manifestation in experimental Co2+ titrations.
3. Conclusions
Cationic structure-directing agents present during zeolite crystallization determine the incorporation of anionic AlO2– tetrahedra in SiO2 lattices and, in turn, influence the siting and distribution of framework Al atoms in crystalline zeolite products. These effects were explored here in the context of the high-symmetry chabazite framework containing a single crystallographically unique tetrahedral site, which reduces the complexity in identifying and enumerating distinct Al–Al site pairs by experiment and theory. An organic SDA (TMAda+) was used alone and together with inorganic SDA cations of different ionic radius (Na+, K+), to vary the average charge density of SDA cations that were occluded within crystalline CHA products. Using TMAda+ alone led to occlusion of 1 TMAda+ per CHA cage and the formation of only 6-MR isolated Al sites. Using Na+ together with TMAda+ as co-SDAs also led to occlusion of 1 TMAda+ per CHA cage and co-occlusion of Na+ in void spaces (e.g., 6-MR) that did not compete with TMAda+ siting, leading to the formation of 6-MR paired Al sites in amounts that increased linearly with co-occluded Na+ content. Using K+ together with TMAda+ as co-SDAs, in sharp contrast, led to occlusion of K+ cations within void spaces (e.g., 8-MR windows) that interfered with TMAda+ occlusion, resulting in competition for void spaces and with the consequence that only 6-MR isolated Al sites were formed. The use of K+ together with TMAda+ also allowed crystallizing CHA zeolites (Si/Al = 10–16) from synthesis media containing >10× higher inorganic/organic cation ratios (K+/TMAda+ < 20) than possible when using Na+ (Na+/TMAda+ < 2) before impurity phases are formed. This reflects, in part, the structure-directing ability of K+ alone toward the CHA framework and provides a strategy to decrease the amount of organic SDA needed to crystallize high-silica CHA zeolites containing predominantly 6-MR isolated Al sites.
DFT calculations revealed that Na+ will co-occlude with TMAda+ in a given CHA cage unit, with minimum energy structures corresponding to occupation of Na+ within both 6-MR and 8-MR. In contrast, K+ prefers to site within 8-MR windows of CHA, reflecting its larger ionic radius compared to Na+, and results in energetically unfavorable co-occlusion with TMAda+ in the same CHA cage unit. The co-occlusion of Na+ with TMAda+ preferentially stabilizes both 6-MR and 8-MR paired Al sites, consistent with experimental findings. The occlusion of K+ with TMAda+, to the extent it occurs in synthetic materials, disfavors Al–Al ensembles separated by 1 or 2 Si atoms in a 6-MR (2NN and 3NN separation, respectively), but preferentially stabilizes Al–Al ensembles separated by 3 Si atoms in an 8-MR (4NN separation). These findings suggest that CHA zeolites synthesized in the presence of K+ and TMAda+ may contain framework Al distributions that are enriched in 8-MR paired Al sites compared to that predicted for random Al substitution patterns, which motivate the development of quantitative titration and characterization methods that are sensitive to such Al arrangements and of applications that would benefit from the presence of such Al–Al ensembles. Monte Carlo simulations parametrized against these DFT results provide a means to rationalize experimentally observable quantities, such as Co2+ titration results that serve as a reporter of the distribution of 6-MR paired Al sites in CHA zeolites. While the model results qualitatively align with observation, quantitative comparisons would require models parametrized to capture the broader range of ionic interactions that prevail under synthetic conditions.
These findings highlight how computational approaches that model SDA–framework interactions can be used to rationalize experimentally observed heterogeneities at the atomic scale that reflect different framework Al arrangements in zeolites, as a result of the cationic SDAs used to guide their crystallization. Using mixtures of low-charge-density organic SDAs with different inorganic cations of higher cationic charge density is found to have different consequences for competitive or cooperative occlusion of SDAs within void spaces of zeolites and, in turn, for their resulting framework Al distributions, consistent with prior recognition that cationic SDAs serve different roles in stabilizing zeolite frameworks that especially contain high anionic charge densities. (68,88) These conclusions appear to hold generally, independent of the amorphous Al source or mineralizing agent used (OH−, F–), providing further evidence for the dominant role of the structure of SDA cations on the distribution of anionic lattice sites formed by Al substitution. The theoretical approaches used herein can aid in the design of experimental synthesis approaches that emphasize the formation of certain framework Al arrangements in materials whose atomic structures can be tailored for applications in catalysis, adsorption, and separation.

Abstract
Figure 1
Figure 1. Fraction of Al in 6-MR pairs, as measured by Co2+ titration, in H–CHA samples of similar composition (Si/Al = 14–17) plotted against (a) the number of Al in 6-MR pairs predicted for a random Al distribution subject to Löwenstein’s rule at the Si/Al ratio for each sample (22) and (b) the amount of Na+ occluded on the crystalline CHA products. Samples were synthesized with Al(OH)3 and Na+/TMAda+ = 0–2 in OH– media (solid squares) and Na+/TMAda+ = 0 in F– media (open circle) or with Al(O-i-Pr)3 with Na+/TMAda+ = 1 (open squares) and Na+/TMAda+ = 0 (open diamond). Samples synthesized with Na+/TMAda+ = 0 or 1 are indicated in (a), along with samples synthesized with Na+/TMAda+ = 1 at different Si/Al ratios previously by Di Iorio et al. (gray triangles) (14) and Deimund et al. (open triangles). (18) Dashed lines denote parity lines of slope (a) 1 and (b) 2, while the dotted line in (b) is a linear regression to the data (slope of 1.45).
Figure 2
Figure 2. X-ray diffraction patterns (left) and SEM micrographs (right) taken at 1300× magnification of CHA synthesized with K+/TMAda+ ratios of (a) 1, (b) 2, (c) 3, (d) 4, (e) 5, (f) 10, (g) 15, and (h) 20. Scale bar in SEM images in 50 μm.
Figure 3
Figure 3. Number of TMAda+ per CHA cage (closed) and the fraction of Al in 6-MR pairs (open) as a function of the amount of Na+ (squares) or K+ (circles) retained on the crystalline CHA product. Dotted (slope = −0.37) and dashed (slope = 0) lines are regressions to K+ (circles) and Na+ (squares) data sets, respectively.
Figure 4
Figure 4. Top left: Schematic representation of CHA lattices used for ΔEalkali-co-caging calculations. Al (green), alkali (gray) atoms, and TMAda+ are shown explicitly. Right: PBE+D3-computed ΔEK-co-caging vs ΔENa-co-caging with five non-first nearest-neighbor (non-1NN) symmetry-distinct Al–Al arrangements based on 12 T-site CHA supercell models. The solid line is the linear regression to the data set, with the equation and R2 shown. Atom color: yellow: Si, green: Al, red: O. Bottom left: Structures and ΔEco-caging of Na and K located at 6- or 8-MR locations for the most preferred Al–Al ensemble. Atom color codes: yellow: Si, green: Al, red: O, black: Na, purple: K.
Figure 5
Figure 5. PBE+D3-computed energy of 96 T-site supercells with one cage occluded by TMAda+ and either Na+ or K+, referenced to the lowest energy arrangement, sorted and colored by connectivity distance of an Al–Al arrangement. Structures and optimized alkali location are shown for lowest energy Al–Al arrangements (TMAda+ hidden for better visualization). The structural units containing two Al ensembles are coded as 4, 4-MR; 6, 6-MR; 8, 8-MR; D, d6r unit, and each structure is presented in greater detail in Section S.10 of the Supporting Information. Atom color codes: yellow: Si, green: Al, red: O, black: Na, purple: K.
Figure 6
Figure 6. Ratio of probability of different paired Al configurations under energy biases consistent with Na+ (top) and K+ (bottom) co-caging energies, relative to a bias considering purely repulsive Al–Al interactions, in a CHA lattice of Si/Al = 15. Green dots represent the position of framework Al atoms. Inset: Numerical titration of 6-MR pairs (gray bars) followed by 8-MR-3NN pairs (black bars) at Si/Al = 15 under the three considered biases. “d”, “Na+”, and “K+” represent the distance bias only (no Na+ or K+), Na+/TMAda+ energy bias, and K+/TMAda+ energy bias, respectively.
