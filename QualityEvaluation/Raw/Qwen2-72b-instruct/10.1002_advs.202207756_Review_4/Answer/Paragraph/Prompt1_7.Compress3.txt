The CH activation step is proposed as the rate-determining step (RDS) due to the strong C-H bond breakage. Among Ga species, Ga+ is most favorable, followed by GaH2+ and GaH+2, with the reactivity of GaH+2 ions dependent on the distance between stabilizing aluminum-occupied oxygen tetrahedra.

The CH activation step is the rate-determining step (RDS) due to the energetic cost of breaking strong C-H bonds (Quote 8). This mechanism applies to various Ga species structures, as Ga's beneficial effect on alkane aromatization rates and selectivity is observed with different introduction techniques (Quote 1).", "Doi": "10.1016/s0920-5861(96)00028-4"},
{"DOC": "In propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions on gallium-based catalysts, the alkyl mechanism involves CH bond polarization where carbon develops a negative charge and hydrogen a positive charge, leading to the formation of a metal-alkyl and a Brnsted acid as intermediates. The activated intermediate D undergoes alkyl activation, resulting in a Gaalkyl species and a Brnsted acid site. Alkyl activation is followed by ethene desorption from the Gaalkyl intermediate, leaving behind gallium dihydride. This mechanism contrasts with the carbenium mechanism, where CH bond polarization leads to the formation of alkoxide and metal hydride intermediates. The CH activation step is proposed as the rate-determining step (RDS) due to the energy required to break the strong C-H bond. Alkene desorption is a rate-limiting step for the alkyl activation cycle, regardless of the catalytic site's activity. For the 4-membered ring cluster Z4a, the overall free energy of alkyl activation is lower than carbenium activation. A novel one-step H2 and C2H4 desorption pathway from gallium alkyl intermediate has been reported, involving a cyclic transition state with an activation barrier of 53.5 kcal/mol, setting a lower limit of about 55 kcal/mol for the apparent activation barrier.", "Doi": "10.1016/j.jcat.2006.11.032"},
{"DOC": "In PDH reactions on gallium catalysts, the alkyl mechanism involves CH activation by [HGaH]+, forming a tetrahedral intermediate that rotates and desorbs, with the initial CH activation step as the RDS due to a high activation barrier. This barrier leads to a low intrinsic reaction rate. The carbenium mechanism, with a lower CH activation barrier, contrasts this, suggesting the single-site model may not fully represent the true mechanism.", "Doi": "10.1016/j.cattod.2005.04.017"}
