A novel one-step H2 and C2H4 desorption pathway from gallium alkyl intermediate has been reported, with an activation barrier of 53.5 kcal/mol, setting a lower limit for the apparent activation barrier.", "Doi": "10.1016/j.jcat.2006.11.032"},
{"DOC": "In PDH reactions on gallium-based catalysts, the alkyl mechanism involves CH activation by [HGaH]+, forming [H2GaC2H5], followed by H2 removal and alkyl desorption. The initial CH activation is the RDS, with a high activation barrier (48.66 kcal/mol), leading to a low intrinsic reaction rate. This contrasts with the carbenium mechanism, which has a lower barrier for CH activation (85.72 kcal/mol) and hydrogen removal. The high barrier for CH activation in the alkyl mechanism is directly related to the endothermicity of this step (51.40 kcal/mol).", "Doi": "10.1016/j.cattod.2005.04.017"}
