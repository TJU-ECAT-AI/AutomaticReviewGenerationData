{"DOC": "In propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions on gallium-based catalysts, the alkyl mechanism involves gallium acting as an acceptor of the alkyl group. The initial step is the oxidative addition of an alkane molecule to the Ga+ cation via an indirect heterolytic mechanism. This mechanism is preferred over the carbenium mechanism, which involves the formation of a carbenium ion and a hydride ion. The activation energy for the alkyl mechanism is 193 kJ/mol, higher than the 158 kJ/mol for the GaH2+ species, but the overall activation barrier for the alkyl mechanism is lower at 233 kJ/mol. The CH activation step is proposed as the rate-determining step (RDS) due to the strong C-H bond breaking. The alkyl mechanism applies to different Ga species, with Ga+ being the most favorable, followed by GaH2+ and GaH+2.

These intermediates decompose to produce alkene molecules and regenerate the active site. Theoretical studies by Frash and van Santen proposed dihydridogallium ions as active sites for ethane activation, but our results suggest an alternative pathway through reactions (17) and (18). The mechanism applies to different Ga species structures, influenced by hydrogen, which suppresses aromatization and promotes methane and ethane formation, indicating competition for active sites. The formation of isolated Ga(I) species from binuclear oxidic gallium clusters and their stabilization by alkyl groups bonded to gallium are crucial steps. Dihydridogallium ions, observed after hydrogen reduction, decompose slowly, showing they cannot intermediate hydrogen desorption during aromatization. However, under propane flow, these ions are rapidly replaced by alkylgallium ions, indicating they cannot be the active site for alkane activation. The role of hydrogen in the reaction and the competition for active sites are significant factors in the PDH mechanism.", "Doi": "10.1016/j.apcata.2012.05.036"},
{"DOC": "In propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions on gallium-based catalysts, the alkyl mechanism involves propane activation through hydride abstraction or proton addition, facilitated by Ga and Zn ions. These ions act as 'portholes', catalyzing H-atom recombinative desorption as H2, enhancing propene formation rates without producing cracking products (quotes [5] and [6]). The mechanism applies to various Ga species structures, as Ga's beneficial effect on alkane aromatization rates and selectivity is consistent across different introduction techniques (quote [1]). Compared to the carbenium mechanism, which involves direct protonation of propane, the alkyl mechanism's rate-determining step is the C-H bond activation, due to the energetic unfavorability of breaking strong C-H bonds (quote [8]).

The CH activation step is considered the rate-determining step (RDS) due to the energy required to break the strong C-H bond. Alkyl activation applies to various Ga species structures, with lower overall free energy for the 4-membered ring cluster Z4a compared to carbenium activation. Alkene desorption is a rate-limiting step for the alkyl activation cycle, regardless of the catalytic site's activity.

Hydrogen's presence suppresses aromatization reactions and promotes methane and ethane formation, competing with propane for active sites. Different Ga species, including isolated Ga(I) and dihydridogallium ions, participate in the mechanism based on reaction conditions. Theoretical analysis by Frash and van Santen suggests dihydridogallium ions as active sites, but our results indicate the alkylhydrido intermediate decomposes via reactions (17) and (18) instead.", "Doi": "10.1016/j.apcata.2012.05.036"},
{"DOC": "In PDH reactions on gallium-based catalysts, the alkyl mechanism involves propane activation through hydride abstraction or proton addition, unlike the carbenium mechanism which directly protonates propane. Ga and Zn ions enhance propene formation by removing H-atoms from acid sites, preventing cracking products and catalyzing H-atom recombinative desorption as H2. This H-atom disposal step is the rate-determining step for sequential dehydrogenation reactions, as it involves the energetically unfavorable breaking of a strong C-H bond. The mechanism applies to various Ga species structures, with Ga ions introduced by impregnation or ion exchange techniques showing improved alkane aromatization rates and selectivity.", "Doi": "10.1016/s0920-5861(96)00028-4"},
{"DOC": "In propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions on gallium-based catalysts, the alkyl mechanism involves CH bond polarization where carbon develops a negative charge and hydrogen a positive charge, leading to the formation of a metal-alkyl and a Brnsted acid as intermediates. This contrasts with the carbenium mechanism, where the carbon assumes a positive partial charge and hydrogen a negative charge, forming alkoxide and metal hydride intermediates. The CH activation step is proposed as the rate-determining step (RDS) due to the energy required to break the strong C-H bond. Alkyl activation, following the formation of intermediate D, results in a Gaalkyl species and a Brnsted acid site, with subsequent ethene desorption leaving behind gallium dihydride. Alkene desorption is a rate-limiting step for the overall alkyl activation catalytic cycle, regardless of the catalytic site's activity. A novel one-step H2 and C2H4 desorption pathway from gallium alkyl intermediate has been reported, involving a cyclic transition state with an activation barrier of 53.5 kcal/mol, setting a lower limit of about 55 kcal/mol for the apparent activation barrier.", "Doi": "10.1016/j.jcat.2006.11.032"},
{"DOC": "In propane dehydrogenation (PDH) on gallium catalysts, the alkyl mechanism involves CH bond activation by [HGaH]+, forming [H2GaC2H5], which rotates and releases H2, with alkyl desorption as the final step. The initial CH activation is the rate-determining step (RDS), with a high activation barrier of 48.66 kcal/mol, leading to a slow intrinsic reaction rate. This contrasts with the carbenium mechanism, which has a lower activation barrier for CH activation. The high barrier in the alkyl mechanism is directly related to the endothermicity of the CH activation step. The single-site [HGaH]+ model is insufficient to represent the true mechanism, indicating the complexity of Ga-assisted dehydrogenation.", "Doi": "10.1016/j.cattod.2005.04.017"}
