{"DOC": "In propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions on gallium-based catalysts, the alkyl mechanism involves CH bond polarization, where the carbon develops a negative charge and hydrogen a positive charge, leading to the formation of a metal-alkyl and a Brnsted acid as intermediates. This contrasts with the carbenium mechanism, where the carbon assumes a positive partial charge and hydrogen a negative charge, forming alkoxide and metal hydride intermediates. The CH activation step is proposed as the rate-determining step (RDS) due to the energy required to break the strong C-H bond. Alkyl activation applies to different Ga species structures, with lower overall free energy for the 4-membered ring cluster Z4a compared to carbenium activation. However, alkene desorption is a rate-limiting step for the alkyl activation catalytic cycle, regardless of the catalytic site's activity. A novel one-step H2 and C2H4 desorption pathway from gallium alkyl intermediate has been reported, involving a cyclic transition state with an activation barrier of 53.5 kcal/mol, setting a lower limit of about 55 kcal/mol for the apparent activation barrier.", "Doi": "10.1016/j.jcat.2006.11.032"},
{"DOC": "In propane dehydrogenation (PDH) on gallium catalysts, the alkyl mechanism involves CH activation by [HGaH]+, forming [H2GaC2H5], which rotates and releases H2, followed by alkyl desorption. The initial CH activation step, with a high activation barrier, is the rate-determining step (RDS), significantly slowing the reaction. In contrast, the carbenium mechanism has a lower barrier for CH activation and hydrogen removal, making it faster. [2] This high barrier for the initial step in the alkyl mechanism aligns with experimental values, confirming its role as the RDS. [6] The carbenium mechanism's lower barriers indicate a more favorable pathway for PDH reactions. [8]", "Doi": "10.1016/j.cattod.2005.04.017"}
