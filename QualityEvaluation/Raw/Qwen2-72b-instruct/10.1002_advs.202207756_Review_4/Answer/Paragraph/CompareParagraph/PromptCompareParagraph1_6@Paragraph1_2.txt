The alkyl mechanism in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions on gallium-based catalysts is a complex process involving the activation of propane by a metal cation to form an alkyl gallium intermediate, followed by β-elimination and desorption of propylene and hydrogen \[10.1002/advs.202207756\_4\]. This mechanism applies to various Ga species structures, including Ga+, [GaH]+, and Ga2O22+, with the CH activation step and alkyl metal intermediate formation being the rate-determining steps (RDS) \[10.1002/advs.202207756\_4\]. Unlike the carbenium mechanism, where Ga species facilitate hydrogen recombination, the alkyl mechanism activates the CH bond in propane \[10.1002/advs.202207756\_4\]. The CH activation step is proposed as the RDS due to the strong C-H bond breakage \[10.1016/j.jcat.2006.03.011\]. Among Ga species, Ga+ is the most favorable, followed by GaH2+ and GaH+2, with the reactivity of GaH+2 ions strongly dependent on the distance between stabilizing aluminum-occupied oxygen tetrahedra \[10.1016/j.jcat.2006.03.011\]. When Al atoms are closely located, GaH+2 ions are stable but less active for initial CH bond cleavage, while greater AlAl distances result in low stability and decomposition to Ga+ and a Brnsted acid site \[10.1016/j.jcat.2006.03.011\].
                    
                    Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: The alkyl mechanism in PDH reactions on gallium-based catalysts presents a rich field for further exploration. Considering the pivotal role of the CH activation step as the RDS, future research might focus on developing catalysts that can lower this barrier, potentially through the design of novel Ga species structures or by modifying the distance between stabilizing aluminum-occupied oxygen tetrahedra to optimize the reactivity of GaH+2 ions. Additionally, the comparison with the carbenium mechanism highlights the need for a deeper understanding of the factors that influence the selectivity of these pathways. This could lead to the development of catalysts that favor the alkyl mechanism, enhancing the efficiency of PDH reactions. Moreover, the role of hydrogen addition in suppressing aromatization and promoting methane and ethane formation suggests that controlling the hydrogen environment around the catalyst could offer a new avenue for tuning product selectivity. The exploration of these directions could significantly advance the field of PDH catalysis, potentially leading to more efficient and selective processes for the production of propylene.

The alkyl mechanism in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions on gallium-based catalysts is a complex process involving multiple steps from propane activation to product formation \[10.1002/advs.202207756\_4\]. This mechanism is characterized by the initial activation of propane by a metal cation, leading to the formation of an alkyl gallium intermediate. Subsequently, β-elimination and desorption of propylene and hydrogen occur, completing the reaction cycle \[10.1002/advs.202207756\_4\]. The alkyl mechanism applies to various Ga species structures, including Ga+, [GaH]+, and Ga2O22+, with the CH activation step and alkyl metal intermediate formation proposed as the rate-determining step (RDS) \[10.1002/advs.202207756\_4\]. Unlike the carbenium mechanism, where Ga species facilitate hydrogen recombination, the alkyl mechanism activates the CH bond in propane \[10.1002/advs.202207756\_4\].

Gallium acts as an acceptor of the alkyl group in the alkyl mechanism, starting with the oxidative addition of an alkane molecule to the Ga+ cation via an indirect heterolytic mechanism \[10.1016/j.jcat.2006.03.011\]. This mechanism is preferred over the carbenium mechanism due to a higher activation energy for the alkyl mechanism versus the carbenium mechanism with GaH2+ species \[10.1016/j.jcat.2006.03.011\]. The overall activation barrier for the alkyl mechanism is lower than that for the carbenium mechanism, with the CH activation step proposed as the RDS due to the strong C-H bond breakage \[10.1016/j.jcat.2006.03.011\]. Ga+ is the most favorable species, followed by GaH2+ and GaH+2, whose reactivity is strongly influenced by the distance between stabilizing aluminum-occupied oxygen tetrahedra \[10.1016/j.jcat.2006.03.011\].

The alkyl mechanism contrasts with the carbenium mechanism in the activation of propane, involving hydride abstraction or proton addition, differing from the carbenium mechanism's direct protonation \[10.1016/s0920-5861(96)00028-4\]. Ga and Zn ions enhance propene formation by facilitating H-atom removal from acid sites, preventing cracking products and catalyzing H-atom desorption as H2, a critical step in sequential dehydrogenation reactions \[10.1016/s0920-5861(96)00028-4\]. The C-H bond activation, occurring predominantly on BrOnsted acid sites, is proposed as the RDS due to the energetic cost of breaking strong C-H bonds \[10.1016/s0920-5861(96)00028-4\].

In the alkyl mechanism, CH bond polarization leads to the formation of a metal-alkyl and a Brnsted acid as intermediates, contrasting with the carbenium mechanism's formation of alkoxide and metal hydride intermediates \[10.1016/j.jcat.2006.11.032\]. The CH activation step is the RDS due to the energy required to break the strong C-H bond. Alkene desorption is a rate-limiting step for the alkyl activation cycle, regardless of the catalytic site's activity \[10.1016/j.jcat.2006.11.032\]. A novel one-step H2 and C2H4 desorption pathway from gallium alkyl intermediate has been reported, involving a cyclic transition state with an activation barrier of 53.5 kcal/mol, setting a lower limit of about 55 kcal/mol for the apparent activation barrier \[10.1016/j.jcat.2006.11.032\].

In PDH reactions on gallium-based catalysts, the alkyl mechanism involves CH activation by [HGaH]+, forming [H2GaC2H5], followed by H2 removal and alkyl desorption \[10.1016/j.cattod.2005.04.017\]. The initial CH activation is the RDS, with a high activation barrier leading to a low intrinsic reaction rate. This contrasts with the carbenium mechanism, which has a lower activation barrier for CH activation and hydrogen removal \[10.1016/j.cattod.2005.04.017\]. The high barrier for CH activation in the alkyl mechanism is directly related to the endothermicity of this step \[10.1016/j.cattod.2005.04.017\].


Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: The alkyl mechanism in PDH reactions on gallium-based catalysts presents a rich field for further exploration and innovation. The detailed understanding of the mechanism's key steps, from propane activation to product formation, provides a solid foundation for the development of more efficient and selective catalysts. Future research might focus on the optimization of Ga species structures to enhance the reactivity and stability of the catalysts, particularly by manipulating the distance between stabilizing aluminum-occupied oxygen tetrahedra. Additionally, the exploration of novel pathways for H2 and C2H4 desorption could lead to the discovery of more efficient catalytic cycles. The comparison with the carbenium mechanism highlights the importance of understanding the role of different metal species in the activation of hydrocarbons, suggesting that the study of other metal-based catalysts could yield valuable insights. Moreover, the investigation of the influence of reaction conditions on the selectivity and activity of the alkyl mechanism could guide the design of processes for the production of propylene and other valuable hydrocarbons.
