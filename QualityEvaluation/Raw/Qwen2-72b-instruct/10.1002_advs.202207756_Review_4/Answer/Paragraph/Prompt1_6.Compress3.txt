The mechanism applies to various Ga species structures, as Ga's beneficial effect on alkane aromatization is observed with different introduction techniques. [3] Proves C-H activation rate is weakly dependent on Ga and Zn presence, while [5] and [6] highlight their role in H-atom removal and desorption. [8] confirms the H-atom disposal as the rate-determining step.", "Doi": "10.1016/s0920-5861(96)00028-4"},
{"DOC": "In propane dehydrogenation (PDH) on gallium-based catalysts, the alkyl mechanism involves CH bond polarization, where carbon develops a negative charge and hydrogen a positive charge, leading to metal-alkyl and Brnsted acid intermediates. This contrasts with the carbenium mechanism, where carbon assumes a positive charge and hydrogen a negative charge, forming alkoxide and metal hydride intermediates. The CH activation step is the rate-determining step (RDS) due to the energy required to break the strong C-H bond. Alkyl activation is more facile than carbenium activation but faces a high activation barrier for ethene removal from the Gaalkyl intermediate, making it a rate-limiting step. A novel one-step H2 and C2H4 desorption pathway from gallium alkyl intermediate has been reported, involving a cyclic transition state with an activation barrier of 53.5 kcal/mol, setting a lower limit of about 55 kcal/mol for the apparent activation barrier.", "Doi": "10.1016/j.jcat.2006.11.032"},
{"DOC": "In propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions on gallium-based catalysts, the alkyl mechanism involves initial CH bond activation by [HGaH]+ species, forming a tetrahedral intermediate that undergoes rotation and hydrogen removal. The CH activation step is the rate-determining step (RDS), characterized by a high activation barrier, leading to a low intrinsic reaction rate. This barrier is directly related to the endothermicity of the CH activation step. In contrast, the carbenium mechanism, featuring CH bond activation and alkoxide intermediate formation, has a lower activation barrier for CH activation and hydrogen removal, making it more favorable.", "Doi": "10.1016/j.cattod.2005.04.017"}
