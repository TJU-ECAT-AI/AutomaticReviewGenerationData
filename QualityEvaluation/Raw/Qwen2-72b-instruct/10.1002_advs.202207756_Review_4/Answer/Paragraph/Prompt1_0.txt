The CH activation step is proposed as the rate-determining step (RDS) because it involves the breaking of a strong C-H bond. Among different Ga species structures, Ga+ is the most favorable, followed by GaH2+ and GaH+2, with the reactivity of GaH+2 ions strongly dependent on the distance between stabilizing aluminum-occupied oxygen tetrahedra. When Al atoms are closely located, GaH+2 ions are stable but exhibit lower activity for initial CH bond cleavage, while greater AlAl distances result in low stability and decomposition to Ga+ and a Brnsted acid site.", "Doi": "10.1016/j.jcat.2006.03.011"},

Dihydridogallium ions are not the active site for alkane activation, as their slow decomposition under inert gas shows they don't intermediate hydrogen desorption. Instead, alkylgallium ions rapidly replace dihydridogallium ions under propane flow, indicating the active species for alkane activation.", "Doi": "10.1016/j.apcata.2012.05.036"},
{"DOC": "In PDH reactions on gallium-based catalysts, the alkyl mechanism involves propane activation through hydride abstraction or proton addition, differing from the carbenium mechanism which forms carbonium ions directly. Ga and Zn enhance propene formation by facilitating H-atom removal from acid sites, preventing cracking and allowing turnover. These metals act as 'portholes', catalyzing H-atom desorption as H2, a step proposed as the rate-determining step due to the energetic cost of C-H bond breaking. This mechanism applies to various Ga species structures, as evidenced by the beneficial effect of Ga on alkane aromatization rates and selectivity, observed with different introduction techniques.", "Doi": "10.1016/s0920-5861(96)00028-4"},
{"DOC": "In propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions on gallium-based catalysts, the alkyl mechanism involves CH polarization, where the carbon develops a negative charge and hydrogen a positive charge, leading to the formation of a metal-alkyl and a Brnsted acid as intermediates. This mechanism results in the desorption of an alkene (ethene) from the Gaalkyl intermediate, leaving behind the gallium dihydride species. Alkene desorption is a rate-limiting step for the overall alkyl activation catalytic cycle, regardless of the catalytic site's activity. In contrast, the carbenium mechanism involves CH bond polarization, leading to the formation of alkoxide and metal hydride intermediates. The CH activation step is proposed as the rate-determining step (RDS) due to the energy required to break the strong C-H bond. For the 4-membered ring cluster Z4a, the overall free energy of alkyl activation is lower than that of carbenium activation.", "Doi": "10.1016/j.jcat.2006.11.032"},
{"DOC": "In propane dehydrogenation (PDH) on gallium catalysts, the alkyl mechanism involves CH bond activation by [HGaH]+, forming [H2GaC2H5], followed by H2 removal and alkyl desorption. The initial CH activation step, with a high activation barrier, is the rate-determining step (RDS), leading to a low intrinsic reaction rate. This contrasts with the carbenium mechanism, which has a lower activation barrier for CH activation and hydrogen removal. The high barrier for CH activation in the alkyl mechanism is directly related to its endothermicity. The single-site [HGaH]+ model is insufficient to represent the true Ga-assisted dehydrogenation mechanism.", "Doi": "10.1016/j.cattod.2005.04.017"}
