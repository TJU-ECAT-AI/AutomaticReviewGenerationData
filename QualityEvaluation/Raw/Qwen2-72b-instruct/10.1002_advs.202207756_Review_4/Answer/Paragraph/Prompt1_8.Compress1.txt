C-H bond activation predominantly occurs on BrOnsted acid sites, supporting the alkyl mechanism.", "Doi": "10.1016/s0920-5861(96)00028-4"},
{"DOC": "In propane dehydrogenation (PDH) on gallium-based catalysts, the alkyl mechanism involves CH bond polarization, leading to a negatively charged carbon and a positively charged hydrogen, forming a metal-alkyl and a Brnsted acid as intermediates. This contrasts with the carbenium mechanism, where the carbon assumes a positive charge and hydrogen a negative charge, forming alkoxide and metal hydride intermediates. The CH activation step is the rate-determining step (RDS) due to the energy required to break the strong C-H bond. Alkyl activation applies to various Ga species structures, with lower activation energy for the 4-membered ring cluster Z4a compared to carbenium activation. Alkene desorption is a rate-limiting step for the alkyl activation cycle. A novel one-step H2 and C2H4 desorption pathway from gallium alkyl intermediate has been reported, involving a cyclic transition state with an activation barrier of 53.5 kcal/mol, setting a lower limit of about 55 kcal/mol for the apparent activation barrier.", "Doi": "10.1016/j.jcat.2006.11.032"},
{"DOC": "In PDH reactions on gallium catalysts, the alkyl mechanism involves CH bond activation by [HGaH]+, forming [H2GaC2H5], which rotates and desorbs alkyl species. The CH activation step, with a barrier of 48.66 kcal/mol, is the RDS, leading to a low reaction rate. This contrasts with the carbenium mechanism, which has a lower CH activation barrier (85.72 kcal/mol) and easier hydrogen removal. The high endothermicity of CH activation in the alkyl mechanism (51.40 kcal/mol) contributes to its higher barrier. The single-site [HGaH]+ model is insufficient, indicating the need for a more complex understanding of Ga-assisted dehydrogenation.", "Doi": "10.1016/j.cattod.2005.04.017"}
