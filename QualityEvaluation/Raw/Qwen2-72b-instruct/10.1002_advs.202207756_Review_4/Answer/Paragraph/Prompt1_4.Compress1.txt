This contrasts with the carbenium mechanism, where the CH bond polarizes differently, forming alkoxide and metal hydride intermediates. The CH activation step is proposed as the rate-determining step (RDS) due to the energy required to break the strong C-H bond. The alkyl mechanism applies to various Ga species structures, with lower overall free energy for the 4-membered ring cluster Z4a compared to carbenium activation. Alkene desorption is a rate-limiting step for the alkyl activation cycle. A novel one-step H2 and C2H4 desorption pathway from gallium alkyl intermediate has been reported, involving a cyclic transition state with an activation barrier of 53.5 kcal/mol, setting a lower limit of about 55 kcal/mol for the apparent activation barrier.", "Doi": "10.1016/j.jcat.2006.11.032"},
{"DOC": "In propane dehydrogenation (PDH) on gallium-based catalysts, the alkyl mechanism involves CH activation by [HGaH]+, forming [H2GaC2H5], followed by H2 removal and alkyl desorption. The initial CH activation is the rate-determining step (RDS), with a high activation barrier, leading to a low intrinsic reaction rate. This contrasts with the carbenium mechanism, which has a lower barrier for CH activation and hydrogen removal. The high barrier for CH activation in the alkyl mechanism is directly related to its endothermicity. The single-site [HGaH]+ model is insufficient to represent the true Ga-assisted dehydrogenation mechanism.", "Doi": "10.1016/j.cattod.2005.04.017"}
