          The alkyl mechanism in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions on gallium-based catalysts involves gallium acting as an acceptor of the alkyl group. The initial step of CH activation is the oxidative addition of an alkane molecule to the Ga+ cation, which proceeds via an indirect heterolytic mechanism involving the basic oxygen atoms of the zeolite lattice. The reaction mechanism is thought to consist of a complex scheme involving dehydrogenation, oligomerization, and ring closure steps. The modifying cations play key roles in dehydrogenation of paraffins, while Brnsted acid protons catalyze the oligomerization of the olefins produced and possibly their subsequent aromatization. The activation energy for this process is computed as 224 kJ/mol. The overall activation energy of the ethane dehydrogenation over the reduced dehydrogenated Ga/ZSM-5 zeolite is 233 kJ/mol. The mechanism of the initial activation of the hydrocarbon molecule on dihydrido-gallyl ion is very similar to that suggested for the heterolytic dissociation of ethane on Ga Zd. The calculated activation energy for this elementary step (193 kJ/mol) is significantly higher than that (158 kJ/mol) reported previously for GaH2+ species stabilized in a fully optimized 3T cluster. The activation energy for this process was 257 kJ/mol, in an excellent agreement with the previously reported values of 258 kJ/mol and 254 kJ/mol. The activation energy for this process [IV VI; Fig. 4, route (b)] is equal to 104 kJ/mol. The activation energies and enthalpies for both the ho- molytic and heterolytic CH bond cleavage on Ga+ ion in Zs clusters are very similar to those calculated for the distantly separated Al atoms. The fraction of cation sites containing two aluminum atoms in the next-nearest positions is small; for instance, in a zeolite with an Si:Al ratio of 25, it does not exceed 30%. The reactivity of either Ga+ or GaH2+ in hydrocarbon activation exhibits very slight dependence on the distribution of aluminum in zeolite. The apparent activation barrier for this process estimated within the model used is equal to 233 kJ/mol.

The reaction mechanism of ethane dehydrogenation was investigated using DFT calculations for various reduced-gallium sites in Ga/ZSM-5. The probable catalytic cycle starts with the heterolytic CH bond cleavage involving exchanged univalent gallium cation and a basic oxygen atom of the zeolite framework. The low energy of the d-orbitals of Ga+ and its occupied s-orbital that make them unable to donate or accept electrons,respectively, from the hydrocarbon result in a high barrier for the direct oxidative addition of ethane to the cation. Therefore,heterolytic splitting of the CH bond is much more favorable due to the polarization induced by the interaction of the hydrocarbon with the Ga...O Lewis acidbase pair. The resulting product easily rearranges to form [HGaC2H5]+, which decomposes via simultaneous desorption of H2 and C2H4, regenerating the initial Ga+ species.

In addition, the estimated overall activation barrier for the considered catalytic reaction is higher (by 58 kJ/mol) for GaH2+ sites than for Ga+ sites. Bivalent GaH+2 species stabilized at the cation site with distantly separated framework Al sites exhibit significantly higher initial activity for ethane activation but much lower stability compared with Ga+ sites.

On the other hand, GaH+2 ions charge-compensating two proximate framework aluminum ions are the most stable cationic species; however, initial activation of the CH bond over these sites is strongly disfavored both thermodynamically and kinetically. In contrast, the reactivity of univalent gallium species exchanged in zeolite depends only slightly on the relative position of zeolitic anionic sites ([AlO2]units). The alkyl mechanism is more favorable than the carbenium mechanism, which involves the formation of a carbenium ion attached to the basic oxygen of the zeolite and a hydride ion bonded to gallium. The activation energy for the alkyl mechanism is 193 kJ/mol, which is significantly higher than the 158 kJ/mol reported for the GaH2+ species stabilized in a fully optimized 3T cluster. However, the overall activation barrier for the alkyl mechanism is 233 kJ/mol, which is lower than the activation energy for the carbenium mechanism. The CH activation step is proposed as the rate-determining step (RDS) because it involves the breaking of a strong C-H bond. The alkyl mechanism applies to different Ga species structures, with Ga+ being the most favorable, followed by GaH2+ and GaH+2. The reactivity of GaH+2 ions is strongly dependent on the distance between the stabilizing aluminum-occupied oxygen tetrahedra. In cases of greater AlAl distances, the stability of the GaH+2 species is very low, and it decomposes to Ga+ and a Brnsted acid site, whereas when Al atoms are located more closely, the charge-compensating GaH+2 ions are the most stable and exhibit the lowest activity for the initial CH bond cleavage reaction.

          丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应在镓基催化剂上的烷基机制涉及镓作为烷基基团的受体。CH激活的初始步骤是烷烃分子向Ga+阳离子的氧化加成，这通过涉及沸石晶格的基本氧原子的间接异裂机制进行。反应机制被认为由一个复杂的方案组成，涉及脱氢、寡聚化和环闭合步骤。修饰阳离子在石蜡脱氢中起关键作用，而布伦斯特酸质子催化由此产生的烯烃的寡聚，以及可能的后续芳构化。该过程的活化能计算为224 kJ/mol。在还原脱氢的Ga/ZSM-5沸石上，乙烷脱氢的总活化能为233 kJ/mol。在二氢化镓离子上的烃分子初始激活机制与在Ga Zd上乙烷异裂机制的建议非常相似。该基本步骤的活化能(193 kJ/mol)显著高于先前为稳定在完全优化的3T簇中的GaH2+物种报告的值(158 kJ/mol)。该过程的活化能为257 kJ/mol，与先前报告的值258 kJ/mol和254 kJ/mol非常一致。该过程[IV VI; Fig. 4, route (b)]的活化能等于104 kJ/mol。在Zs簇中Ga+离子的同裂和异裂CH键裂解的活化能和焓与为远距离分离的Al原子计算的那些非常相似。含有在最近邻位置的两个铝原子的阳离子位点的分数很小;例如，在Si:Al比为25的沸石中，它不超过30%。在烃激活中，无论是Ga+还是GaH2+的反应性对沸石中铝的分布的依赖性都非常小。在所用模型中估计的该过程的表观活化能等于233 kJ/mol。在Ga2O3/HZSM-5上估计的乙烷脱氢的表观活化能显著低于(163 kJ/mol)这个值。尽管催化反应也可以在GaH2+和GaH+2位点上发生，但这些路径不受欢迎。GaH+2离子的反应性强烈依赖于稳定铝占据氧四面体之间的距离。在更大的AlAl距离情况下，GaH+2物种的稳定性非常低，它分解为Ga+和Brnsted酸位点，而当Al原子更靠近时，补偿电荷的GaH+2离子是最稳定的，并且对初始CH键裂解反应表现出最低的活性。使用DFT计算研究了Ga/ZSM-5中各种还原镓位点的乙烷脱氢的反应机制。可能的催化循环从涉及交换的单价镓阳离子和沸石框架的基本氧原子的异裂CH键裂解开始。Ga+的d轨道的低能量和其占据的s轨道使它们无法从烃中捐赠或接受电子，分别地，导致乙烷直接氧化加到阳离子上的高势垒。因此，由于烃与Ga...O Lewis酸碱对的相互作用引起的极化，CH键的异裂更有利于。生成的产品容易重排形成[HGaC2H5]+，通过H2和C2H4的同时解吸分解，再生初始Ga+物种。C2H6在Ga+Z位点上的脱氢的总活化势垒等于233 kJ/mol。氢化镓物种(GaH2+Z和ZGaH+2Z)不太可能是活性位点。二氢化镓离子的分解，导致催化循环中单价镓离子的形成，与GaH2+位点的再生相比，显著有利。此外，对于所考虑的催化反应，估计的总活化势垒对于GaH2+位点比Ga+位点高(58 kJ/mol)。在与框架Al位点相距较远的阳离子位点上稳定的二价GaH+2物种在乙烷活化方面表现出显著的初始活性，但与Ga+物种相比，稳定性要低得多。然而，CH键的初始异裂导致形成[HGaC2H5]+离子，这些离子优先遵循反应路径，再次导致单价镓阳离子。另一方面，补偿两个相邻框架铝离子的GaH+2离子是最稳定的阳离子物种;然而，这些位点上CH键的初始活化在热力学和动力学上都强烈不利。相比之下，沸石中交换的单价镓物种的反应性仅轻微依赖于沸石阴离子位点([AlO2]单元)的相对位置。烷基机制比卡宾机制更有利，卡宾机制涉及形成连接到沸石基本氧的卡宾离子和连接到镓的氢化物离子。对于烷基机制，活化能为193 kJ/mol，显著高于为稳定在完全优化的3T簇中的GaH2+物种报告的158 kJ/mol。然而，烷基机制的总活化势垒为233 kJ/mol，低于卡宾机制的活化能。CH激活步骤被提议为速率决定步骤(RDS)，因为它涉及强C-H键的断裂。烷基机制适用于不同的Ga物种结构，Ga+是最有利的，其次是GaH2+和GaH+2。GaH+2离子的反应性强烈依赖于稳定铝占据氧四面体之间的距离。在更大的AlAl距离情况下，GaH+2物种的稳定性非常低，它分解为Ga+和Brnsted酸位点，而当Al原子更靠近时，补偿电荷的GaH+2离子是最稳定的，并且对初始CH键裂解反应表现出最低的活性。
