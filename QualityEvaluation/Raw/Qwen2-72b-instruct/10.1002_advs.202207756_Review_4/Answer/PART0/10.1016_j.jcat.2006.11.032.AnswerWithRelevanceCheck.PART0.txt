          [1] "The two basic mechanisms of CH activationcarbenium activation and alkyl activationare shown in Schemes 2 and 3,respectively."
          [2] "The carbenium activation involves CH bond po- larization in such a way that the carbon atom assumes a positive partial charge (δ+) and hydrogen assumes a negative partial charge (δ). Carbenium activation leads to the formation of alkoxide and metal hydride (MH) as an intermediate."
          [3] "In contrast, alkyl activation (Scheme 3) involves CH polarization in such a way that the carbon develops a negative (δ) charge and the hydrogen develops a positive (δ+) charge. Alkyl activation leads to the formation of a metal-alkyl (MCnH2n+1) and the Brnsted acid as intermediates."
          [4] "We investigated both mecha- nisms for all of the clusters discussed so far, and we discuss the results next."
          [5] "The first step involves the opening of the GaO coordination (A + C2H6 [B] D in Scheme 2) to form the activated intermediate D."
          [6] "The intermediate D further undergoes carbenium activation,as shown in Scheme 2 (D [E] F)."
          [7] "Carbenium activation is followed by the desorption of an alkene (ethene) from the alkoxide intermediate (F [I] J K + C2H4), leaving behind the Brnsted acid site."
          [8] "The intermediate D further undergoes alkyl activation as shown in Scheme 3 (D [E] F)."
          [9] "Alkyl activation is followed by desorption of an alkene (ethene) from the Gaalkyl intermediate (F [I] J K + C2H4), leaving behind the gallium dihydride species ([GaH2]+Z m)."
          [10] "The overall carbenium activation barrier (CEa) decreases rapidly with decreasing (more exothermic) heat of reduction (H 0 red)."
          [11] "A linear Polanyi relation [47] between the overall alkyl activa- tion barrier (AEa) and the heat of reduction (H 0 red) is seen."
          [12] "Although alkyl activation is much more facile than the carbenium activation, ethene removal from [HGaC2H5]+Z m intermediate faces a very high activation bar- rier of 60 kcal/mol."
          [13] "Thus, we conclude that this intermediate will be a spectator species while dominating the surface inter- mediates."
          [14] "This conclusion agrees well with recent experimental observations [26]."
          [15] "For the 4-membered ring cluster Z4a, the overall free energy of alkyl activation (AG0 a) is lower than the carbenium acti- vation: 47.6 and 42.7 kcal/mol (Table 3) for alkyl activation,compared with 61.1 and 58.4 kcal/mol (Table 2) for carbenium activation."
          [16] "Thus, alkene desorption is a rate-limiting step for the overall alkyl activation catalytic cycle irrespec- tive of the activity of the particular catalytic site."
          [17] "Recently, Pidko et al. [42] reported a novel one-step H2 and C2H4 de- sorption pathway from gallium alkyl intermediate."
          [18] "This path- way involves a cyclic transition state with an activation bar- rier of 53.5 kcal/mol."
          [19] "We also calculated an activation bar- rier of 54.6 kcal/mol using a single-framework substitution model of the active site as described previously [33]."
          [20] "Thus, this mechanism of decomposition should set a lower limit of about 55 kcal/mol for the apparent activation barrier."
          [21] "The free energies of carbenium activation (A + C2H6 E, CG0 a) for four differ- ent reaction paths are 85.4, 81.4, 92.3, and 81.7 kcal/mol."
          [22] "The free energies of carbenium activation (CG0 a) for the two mechanistic paths (A + C2H6 E in Scheme 2) are 96.4 and 99.2 kcal/mol."
          [23] "The free energies of carbenium activation (CG0 a) for the two pathways are 61.1 and 58.4 kcal/mol."
          [24] "The free energy activation barriers (66.4, 61.9, 66.6, and 54.7 kcal/mol) are lower than those for carbenium activation."
          [25] "The free energy barriers (AG0 a) of 69.6 and 73.8 kcal/mol, with ethene removal barriers of 60.5 and 54.7 kcal/mol."
          [26] "The free energy barriers (AG0 a) are 64.7, 67.9, 69.3, and 70.2 kcal/mol, with ethene removal barriers of ca. 62 kcal/mol."
          [27] "The free energy activation barriers to be 42.5 and 37.7 kcal/mol."
          [28] "The alkyl activation barriers (AG0 a) are 29.0 and 27.0 kcal/mol."
          [29] "The barriers for the forma- tion of the undercoordinated GaH species are relatively higher."
          [30] "The ethene desorption barriers are 65.5 and 66.8 kcal/mol for this particular site."
          [31] "The stability of the bicationic gallium monohydride species in the S5a ring makes alkyl activation more difficult compared with that for Z4a."
          [32] "As expected, the free energy activation bar- riers (66.4, 61.9, 66.6, and 54.7 kcal/mol) are lower than those for carbenium activation."
          [33] "The structure-insensitive ethene re- moval step faces typical free energy barriers of 56.5, 57.8, 48.8,and 63.9 kcal/mol."
          [34] "The S6a structure has large free energy barriers (AG0 a) of 69.6 and 73.8 kcal/mol, with ethene removal barriers of ca."
          [35] "60.5 and 54.7 kcal/mol."
          [36] "The four alkyl activation pathways for the S6b site have free energy barriers (AG0 a) of 64.7, 67.9, 69.3, and 70.2 kcal/mol, with ethene removal barriers of ca."
          [37] "62 kcal/mol."
          [38] "The Z8a ring structure provides a less stable coordina- tion for the [GaH]2+ species, with lower resulting activation barriers for CH dissociation by the alkyl activation mecha- nism."
          [39] "We calculated the free energy activation barriers to be 42.5 and 37.7 kcal/mol."
          [40] "Ethene removal barriers of 63.3 and 64.1 kcal/mol would make this the rate-limiting step."
          [41] "For the least stable site, Z8b, the alkyl activation barriers (AG0 a) are 29.0 and 27.0 kcal/mol."
          [42] "The barriers for the forma- tion of the undercoordinated GaH species are relatively higher."
          [43] "The ethene desorption barriers are 65.5 and 66.8 kcal/mol for this particular site."
          [44] "Thus, alkene desorption is a rate-limiting step for the overall alkyl activation catalytic cycle irrespec- tive of the activity of the particular catalytic site."
          [45] "The first step involves the opening of the GaO coordination (A + C2H6 [B] D in Scheme 2) to form the activated intermediate D."
          [46] "Depending on the site geom- etry, the undercoordinated GaH (intermediate D), representing the activated catalytic site, may or may not be stable."
          [47] "The ethane molecule is adsorbed on to the electron-deficient, coor- dinately unsaturated GaH species."
          [48] "As was pointed out earlier,the CH bonds of the methyl group are strongly polarized and elongated."
          [49] "In general, we have observed that for carbenium activation, the methyl group adsorbs in an end-on fashion (in- termediate D in Scheme 2)."
          [50] "In contrast to end-on adsorbed complex for carbenium activation, for alkyl activation, we observed that the methyl group adsorbs in a sidewise fashion (intermediate D in Scheme 3)."
          [51] "In this activated intermediate, only two hydro- gen atoms and the carbon of the methyl group are closer to the undercoordinated Ga."
          [52] "On the opposite side of the Ga, the third hydrogen of the methyl group is closer to the framework oxy- gen."
          [53] "This CH bond of the methyl group is strongly polarized and elongated."
          [54] "Thus, the geometry of the intermediate D for alkyl activation is conducive for the formation of the Gaalkyl species and Brnsted acid site."
          [55] "Thus, to compare different carbenium activation paths, we define an activation energy term called the overall carbenium activation barrier (CEa)."
          [56] "This activation barrier represents the upper limit of the apparent activation barrier; the actual apparent ac- tivation barrier will depend on the surface coverage and hence on the reaction conditions, which can be determined via rig- orous kinetic simulation [29]."
          [57] "We calculated the free energy change for A + C2H6 E activation (CG0 a), which allowed us to compare the reaction rate along a certain reaction path and determine the rate-controlling step."
          [58] "For all active site struc- tures, energy parameters related to carbenium activation are listed in Table 2."
          [59] "Carbenium activation is followed by the desorption of an alkene (ethene) from the alkoxide intermediate (F [I] J K + C2H4), leaving behind the Brnsted acid site."
          [60] "However, a proton jump from one bridging oxygen to other is much more facile [62] compared with the other mecha- nistic steps."
          [61] "In the discussions on the hydrogen desorption step that fol- lows, we start with the Brnsted acid site on the same bridging oxygen (intermediate K) bearing the alkoxide intermediate, to be consistent with the reduction path of the [GaH]2+Z2 d site."
          [62] "The related energy parameters (ECEa, ECG0 a, ECEr, and ECG0 r ) for ethene desorption are listed in Table 2."
          [63] "As ex- pected, the activation barrier (ECEa) is fairly constant, vary- ing around 2535 kcal/mol."
          [64] "This mechanistic step is known as a structure-insensitive reaction in the sense that the activation barrier does not depend on the distance between the pair of the framework Al."
          [65] "In any case, starting from the alkoxide interme- diate, the free energy of activation for alkene desorption is well"
          [66] "below of that for carbenium activation and thus will be incon- sequential in determining the resulting apparent free energy of activation for the dehydrogenation reaction."
          [67] "For the Z4a ring, the undercoordinated Ga species [GaH]2+ lies in the plane with OAlO, in contrast to the more tetra- hedral coordination of the Ga for the other cluster structures."
          [68] "At the same time, the 4-member ring presents an exception to the end-on adsorbed complex observed for alkyl activa- tion."
          [69] "The steric repulsion of the walls surrounding the smaller ring could be a reason for the preferred sidewise adsorption of the ethane molecule."
          [70] "The overall free energies of carbe- nium activation (CG0 a) for the two paths for Z4a site are 61.1 and 58.5 kcal/mol."
          [71] "As discussed previously, for the carbenium activation mechanism, desorption of an alkene from alkoxide intermediate is much more facile with a ECG0 a of 24.7 and 26.8 kcal/mol."
          [72] "For each of the four reduction pathways for S5a, there is a distinct carbenium activation pathway."
          [73] "The stability of the active site in the monohydride form transpires into the higher activation energy for carbenium activation."
          [74] "The free energies of carbenium activation (A + C2H6 E, CG0 a) for four differ- ent reaction paths are 85.4, 81.4, 92.3, and 81.7 kcal/mol."
          [75] "The corresponding free energy barriers for ethene removal (F I in Scheme 2) are 20.0, 34.0, 21.6, and 29.6 kcal/mol."
          [76] "Again,note that ethene removal from alkoxide is very facile compared with the carbenium activation mechanism."
          [77] "The six-membered ring S6a provides the most stable coor- dination for the [GaH]2+ species."
          [78] "Correspondingly, the highest activation barrier for the carbenium activation is observed."
          [79] "As noted previously [33], due to the higher stability of the cat- alytic site S6a in the monohydride form, the undercoordinated [GaH]2+ species (B and D) are absent along the reaction path."
          [80] "The free energies of carbenium activation (CG0 a) for the two mechanistic paths (A + C2H6 E in Scheme 2) are 96.4 and 99.2 kcal/mol, with corresponding free energies of activation for ethene removal of (ECG0 a) of 27.1 and 22.6 kcal/mol."
          [81] "For the other six-membered ring structure S6b, we studied four distinct carbenium activation paths."
          [82] "The energetics of all four reaction pathways are very similar due to symmetry of the site S6b."
          [83] "Because site S6b is less stable (H 0 red less en- dothermic in Table 1) than S6a, the activation barriers for carbe- nium activation are lower."
          [84] "Free energies of carbenium activation (CG0 a) are 87.0, 89.1, 88.2, and 94.1 kcal/mol."
          [85] "As reported in Table 2, the free energies of activation for ethene desorption are about 28 kcal/mol for all four reaction paths."
          [86] "For the 8-membered ring Z8a, 3.6 kcal/mol heat of re- duction indicates the formation of the [GaH2]+Z m is slightly exothermic."
          [87] "The lower stability of the site Z8a leads to lower free energies of the carbenium activation (62.6 and 62.0 kcal/ mol for two pathways)."
          [88] "For the other 8-membered ring Z8b, the reduction is much more exothermic with H 0 red of 19.6 and 18.6 kcal/mol."
          [89] "The least stable site shows the lowest free en- ergy of carbenium activation (CG0 a), 47.7 and 49.2 kcal/mol."
          [90] "258 Y.V. Joshi, K.T. Thomson / Journal of Catalysis 246 (2007) 249265"
          [91] "Fig. 5. Geometries of reaction intermediates for: (a) carbenium activation; (b) H2 removal; (c) alkyl activation for Z4a site pathway 1."
          [92] "The ECG0 a for ethene desorption is about 22 kcal/mol, much lower than that for carbenium activation."
          [93] "Scheme 3 shows a generalized catalytic cycle for dehydro- genation starting with alkyl activation, including all possible intermediates along any alkyl activation path."
          [94] "Not all of these intermediates may be present for a particular catalytic site, how- ever."
          [95] "In our previous publication on the role of frameworkAl pair sites, we specifically focused on the carbenium activation mechanism, expecting a very high activation barrier [33,41] for alkene desorption from Gaalkyl species."
          [96] "Frash and van Santen [41] showed that for the active site involving single- frameworkAl, alkyl activation has a lower activation barrier than carbenium activation."
          [97] "A similar trend is expected for the frameworkAl pair sites."
          [98] "Similar to the carbenium activation,here the first step involves opening of the GaO coordination (A + C2H6 [B] D in Scheme 3) to form the activated intermediate D."
          [99] "In contrast to end-on adsorbed complex for carbenium activation, for alkyl activation, we observed that the methyl group adsorbs in a sidewise fashion (intermediate D in Scheme 3)."
          [100] "In this activated intermediate, only two hydro- gen atoms and the carbon of the methyl group are closer to the undercoordinated Ga."
          [101] "On the opposite side of the Ga, the third hydrogen of the methyl group is closer to the framework oxy- gen."
          [102] "This CH bond of the methyl group is strongly polarized and elongated."
          [103] "Thus, the geometry of the intermediate D for alkyl activation is conducive for the formation of the Gaalkyl species and Brnsted acid site."
          [104] "Thus, to compare different alkyl activation paths,we have defined an activation energy term called the overall alkyl activation barrier (AEa), representing the energy differ- ence between E and A + C2H6."
          [105] "This activation barrier is the approximate apparent activation barrier, because we have ne- glected the possible presence of the intermediates B and D for our analysis."
          [106] "We calculated the corresponding free energy change (AG0 a) for A + C2H6 E transformation and in Ta- ble 3 report the energy terms for all of the alkyl activation paths:alkyl activation energy (AEa), standard free energies of acti- vation (AG0 a at 25 C and 1 atm), reaction energy (AEr),and free energy change for alkyl activation (AG0 r )."
          [107] "Alkyl activation is followed by desorption of an alkene (ethene) from the Gaalkyl intermediate (F [I] J K + C2H4), leaving behind the gallium dihydride species ([GaH2]+Z m)."
          [108] "Relaxation of the transition state I toward prod- uct leads to the formation of the intermediate J with ethene adsorbed (π-bonded) on the [GaH2]+Z m."
          [109] "Intermediate J indi- cates that the tetrahedral Ga species is coordinated with only one framework oxygen (monodentate)."
          [110] "After the desorption of ethene, the [GaH2]+ species should relax to the more stable bidentate coordination (species K), as shown in Scheme 3."
          [111] "Various energy terms for ethene desorption (EAEa, EAG0 a, EAEr and EAG0 r ) are reported in Table 3."
          [112] "Desorption of ethene from Gaalkyl species has been well studied [33,41], and a very high activation barrier of about 60 kcal/mol has been reported."
          [113] "Because desorption is associated with the Ga species adjacent to a single-framework Al, the activation barrier is expected to be independent (structure insensitive) of the dis- tance between the framework Alpair."
          [114] "In the reminder of this section, we discuss the details of the alkyl activation mecha- nism for each catalytic site."
          [115] "For the 4-membered ring cluster Z4a, the overall free energy of alkyl activation (AG0 a) is lower than the carbenium acti- vation: 47.6 and 42.7 kcal/mol (Table 3) for alkyl activation,compared with 61.1 and 58.4 kcal/mol (Table 2) for carbenium activation."
          [116] "The free energies of activation for ethene removal are 62.0 and 64.4 kcal/mol, respectively."
          [117] "The stability of the bicationic gallium monohydride species in the S5a ring makes alkyl activation more difficult compared with that for Z4a."
          [118] "As expected, the free energy activation bar- riers (66.4, 61.9, 66.6, and 54.7 kcal/mol) are lower than those for carbenium activation."
          [119] "The structure-insensitive ethene re- moval step faces typical free energy barriers of 56.5, 57.8, 48.8,and 63.9 kcal/mol."

          [121] "60.5 and 54.7 kcal/mol."
          [122] "The four alkyl activation pathways for the S6b site have free energy barriers (AG0 a) of 64.7, 67.9, 69.3, and 70.2 kcal/mol, with ethene removal barriers of ca."

          The alkyl mechanism in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions on gallium-based catalysts involves the initial activation of propane, where the carbon atom develops a negative charge and the hydrogen develops a positive charge. This leads to the formation of a metal-alkyl (MCnH2n+1) and a Brnsted acid as intermediates. The activated intermediate D undergoes alkyl activation, resulting in the formation of a Gaalkyl species and a Brnsted acid site. Alkyl activation is followed by the desorption of an alkene (ethene) from the Gaalkyl intermediate, leaving behind the gallium dihydride species ([GaH2]+Z m). The carbenium mechanism, on the other hand, involves the polarization of the CH bond in such a way that the carbon atom assumes a positive partial charge and hydrogen assumes a negative partial charge. This leads to the formation of alkoxide and metal hydride (MH) as intermediates. The CH activation step is proposed as the rate-determining step (RDS) because it involves the breaking of a strong C-H bond, which requires a significant amount of energy. The alkyl mechanism applies to different Ga species structures, with the overall free energy of alkyl activation being lower than that of carbenium activation for the 4-membered ring cluster Z4a. However, alkene desorption is a rate-limiting step for the overall alkyl activation catalytic cycle, regardless of the activity of the particular catalytic site. A novel one-step H2 and C2H4 desorption pathway from gallium alkyl intermediate has been reported, involving a cyclic transition state with an activation barrier of 53.5 kcal/mol. This mechanism of decomposition sets a lower limit of about 55 kcal/mol for the apparent activation barrier.

          在基于镓的催化剂上的丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应中，烷基机制涉及丙烷的初始活化，其中碳原子产生负电荷，氢产生正电荷。这导致形成金属烷基(MCnH2n+1)和布龙斯特酸作为中间体。活化中间体D经历烷基活化，形成Ga烷基物种和布龙斯特酸位点。烷基活化后，从Ga烷基中间体中脱除烯烃(乙烯)，留下镓二氢物种([GaH2]+Z m)。相比之下，卡宾机制涉及CH键的极化，使碳原子具有正偏电荷，氢具有负偏电荷。这导致形成醇盐和金属氢化物(MH)作为中间体。CH活化步骤被提议为速率决定步骤(RDS)，因为它涉及强C-H键的断裂，这需要大量的能量。烷基机制适用于不同的Ga物种结构，对于4-元环簇Z4a，烷基活化的总自由能低于卡宾活化。然而，无论特定催化位点的活性如何，烯烃脱除都是整个烷基活化催化循环的速率限制步骤。最近，报道了一种从镓烷基中间体中一步脱除H2和C2H4的新途径。该途径涉及一个环过渡态，活化能垒为53.5 kcal/mol。这种分解机制为表观活化能垒设定了约55 kcal/mol的下限。
