[1] "Similar to the carbenium mechanism, the alkyl mechanism could be at play regardless of the specific structure of active Ga species, on which propane is initially activated by the metal cation to form the alkyl gallium intermediate, followed by the Î²-elimination and the desorption of propylene and H2."

[1] "The reaction mechanism is thought to consist of a complex scheme involving dehydrogenation, oligomerization, and ring- closure steps [216]."
          [2] "The modifying cations play key roles in dehydrogenation of paraffins [25,1416], whereas Brnsted acid protons catalyze the oligomerization of the olefins thus produced and possibly their subsequent aromatization."
          [3] "The initial step of CH activation is the oxidative addition of an alkane molecule to the Ga+ cation, which proceeds via an indirect heterolytic mechanism involving the basic oxygen atoms of the zeolite lattice."

          [5] "The overall activation energy of the ethane dehydrogenation over the reduced dehydrogenated Ga/ZSM-5 zeolite is 233 kJ/mol."
          [6] "The mechanism of the initial activation of the hydrocarbon molecule on dihydrido-gallyl ion is very similar to that suggested for the heterolytic dissociation of ethane on Ga Zd."
          [7] "The calculated activation energy for this elementary step (193 kJ/mol) is significantly higher than that (158 kJ/mol) reported previously [17] for GaH2+ species stabilized in a fully optimized 3T cluster."
          [8] "The activation energy for this process was 257 kJ/mol, in an excellent agreement with the previously reported values of 258 kJ/mol [22] and 254 kJ/mol [17]."
          [9] "The activation energy for this process [IV VI; Fig. 4, route (b)] is equal to 104 kJ/mol."
          [10] "The activation energies and enthalpies for both the ho- molytic and heterolytic CH bond cleavage on Ga+ ion in Zs clusters are very similar to those calculated for the distantly separated Al atoms."
          [11] "The fraction of cation sites containing two aluminum atoms in the next-nearest positions is small; for instance, in a zeolite with an Si:Al ratio of 25, it does not exceed 30% [43]."

          [10] "The probable catalytic cycle starts with the heterolytic CH bond cleavage involving exchanged univalent gallium cation and a basic oxygen atom of the zeolite framework."
          [11] "The low energy of the d-orbitals of Ga+ and its occupied s-orbital that make them unable to donate or accept electrons,respectively, from the hydrocarbon result in a high barrier for the direct oxidative addition of ethane to the cation."
          [12] "Therefore,heterolytic splitting of the CH bond is much more favorable due to the polarization induced by the interaction of the hydrocarbon with the Ga...O Lewis acidbase pair."

          [17] "In addition, the estimated overall activation barrier for the considered catalytic reaction is higher (by 58 kJ/mol) for GaH2+ sites than for Ga+ sites."
          [18] "Bivalent GaH+2 species stabilized at the cation site with distantly separated framework Al sites exhibit significantly higher initial activity for ethane activation but much lower stability compared with Ga+ sites."

[1] "The results in the present paper complement our previous ones on the genesis of the reduced gallium species in Ga/HZSM5 catalysts."
          [2] "The formation of isolated Ga(I) species from binuclear oxidic gallium clusters involves the production of Lewis from Brnsted acid sites in a 1:1 basis."
          [3] "This process is accompanied by some de-alumination of the zeolite framework to produce extraframework alumina, which also helps to explain the decrease in Brnsted acidity and increase in Lewis acidity."
          [4] "When hydrogen is the reducing agent, the decomposition of the binuclear oxidic species is partially reversed when hydrogen flow is replaced by inert gas, but when the reducing agent is propane the formation of isolated Ga(I) species is irreversible, probably because it is stabilized by alkyl groups bonded to gallium, that were seen to be formed and to be stable when propane flow is replaced by inert gas."
          [5] "Dihydridogallium ions were observed after reduction in hydrogen, but were slowly decomposed when hydrogen flow was replaced by inert gas."
          [6] "This slow decomposition of the dihydridogallium ions shows that it cannot intermediate hydrogen desorption during the aromatization reaction."
          [7] "However, when hydrogen is replaced by propane, the dihydrido species appear to be rapidly replaced by alkylgallium ions."
          [8] "Under propane flow, dihydridogallium cations were never detected."
          [9] "These facts show that it cannot be the active site for alkane activation, as proposed by some investigators."
          [10] "It was also shown that gas phase hydrogen added at the beginning of the reaction has a strong influence on catalysts activity and selectivity."
          [11] "Our results demonstrate that, while dehydrogenation reactions are inhibited by increasing hydrogen partial pressure, hydrogenolysis activities go through a maximum."
          [12] "This maximum shows that, while hydrogen takes part in hydrogenolysis reactions, it competes with propane for the active sites."

          [3] "The initial rate of propene formation is much higher on Ga/H-ZSM5 and Zn/H-ZSM5 compared to H-ZSM5, but isotopic evidence from C3Hs/C3D 8 mixtures show that C-H bond activation rate depends weakly on the presence of Ga and Zn."
          [4] "Reactions over Na-ZSM5 confirm that C-H bond activation occurs predominantly on BrOnsted acid sites."
          [5] "Ga and Zn sites increase the rate of propene formation by removing H-atoms from acid sites that activate C-H bonds, allowing acid sites to turnover without the formation of cracking products."

[1] "The two basic mechanisms of CH activationcarbenium activation and alkyl activationare shown in Schemes 2 and 3,respectively."
          [2] "The carbenium activation involves CH bond po- larization in such a way that the carbon atom assumes a positive partial charge (Î´+) and hydrogen assumes a negative partial charge (Î´). Carbenium activation leads to the formation of alkoxide and metal hydride (MH) as an intermediate."
          [3] "In contrast, alkyl activation (Scheme 3) involves CH polarization in such a way that the carbon develops a negative (Î´) charge and the hydrogen develops a positive (Î´+) charge. Alkyl activation leads to the formation of a metal-alkyl (MCnH2n+1) and the Brnsted acid as intermediates."
          [4] "We investigated both mecha- nisms for all of the clusters discussed so far, and we discuss the results next."
          [5] "The first step involves the opening of the GaO coordination (A + C2H6 [B] D in Scheme 2) to form the activated intermediate D."
          [6] "The intermediate D further undergoes carbenium activation,as shown in Scheme 2 (D [E] F)."
          [7] "Carbenium activation is followed by the desorption of an alkene (ethene) from the alkoxide intermediate (F [I] J K + C2H4), leaving behind the Brnsted acid site."

          [12] "Although alkyl activation is much more facile than the carbenium activation, ethene removal from [HGaC2H5]+Z m intermediate faces a very high activation bar- rier of 60 kcal/mol."
          [13] "Thus, we conclude that this intermediate will be a spectator species while dominating the surface inter- mediates."
          [14] "This conclusion agrees well with recent experimental observations [26]."
          [15] "For the 4-membered ring cluster Z4a, the overall free energy of alkyl activation (AG0 a) is lower than the carbenium acti- vation: 47.6 and 42.7 kcal/mol (Table 3) for alkyl activation,compared with 61.1 and 58.4 kcal/mol (Table 2) for carbenium activation."
          [16] "Thus, alkene desorption is a rate-limiting step for the overall alkyl activation catalytic cycle irrespec- tive of the activity of the particular catalytic site."

          [42] "The barriers for the forma- tion of the undercoordinated GaH species are relatively higher."
          [43] "The ethene desorption barriers are 65.5 and 66.8 kcal/mol for this particular site."

          [48] "As was pointed out earlier,the CH bonds of the methyl group are strongly polarized and elongated."
          [49] "In general, we have observed that for carbenium activation, the methyl group adsorbs in an end-on fashion (in- termediate D in Scheme 2)."
          [50] "In contrast to end-on adsorbed complex for carbenium activation, for alkyl activation, we observed that the methyl group adsorbs in a sidewise fashion (intermediate D in Scheme 3)."

          [52] "On the opposite side of the Ga, the third hydrogen of the methyl group is closer to the framework oxy- gen."
          [53] "This CH bond of the methyl group is strongly polarized and elongated."
          [54] "Thus, the geometry of the intermediate D for alkyl activation is conducive for the formation of the Gaalkyl species and Brnsted acid site."
          [55] "Thus, to compare different carbenium activation paths, we define an activation energy term called the overall carbenium activation barrier (CEa)."
          [56] "This activation barrier represents the upper limit of the apparent activation barrier; the actual apparent ac- tivation barrier will depend on the surface coverage and hence on the reaction conditions, which can be determined via rig- orous kinetic simulation [29]."
          [57] "We calculated the free energy change for A + C2H6 E activation (CG0 a), which allowed us to compare the reaction rate along a certain reaction path and determine the rate-controlling step."

          [71] "As discussed previously, for the carbenium activation mechanism, desorption of an alkene from alkoxide intermediate is much more facile with a ECG0 a of 24.7 and 26.8 kcal/mol."
          [72] "For each of the four reduction pathways for S5a, there is a distinct carbenium activation pathway."
          [73] "The stability of the active site in the monohydride form transpires into the higher activation energy for carbenium activation."
          [74] "The free energies of carbenium activation (A + C2H6 E, CG0 a) for four differ- ent reaction paths are 85.4, 81.4, 92.3, and 81.7 kcal/mol."
          [75] "The corresponding free energy barriers for ethene removal (F I in Scheme 2) are 20.0, 34.0, 21.6, and 29.6 kcal/mol."
          [76] "Again,note that ethene removal from alkoxide is very facile compared with the carbenium activation mechanism."
          [77] "The six-membered ring S6a provides the most stable coor- dination for the [GaH]2+ species."
          [78] "Correspondingly, the highest activation barrier for the carbenium activation is observed."
          [79] "As noted previously [33], due to the higher stability of the cat- alytic site S6a in the monohydride form, the undercoordinated [GaH]2+ species (B and D) are absent along the reaction path."
          [80] "The free energies of carbenium activation (CG0 a) for the two mechanistic paths (A + C2H6 E in Scheme 2) are 96.4 and 99.2 kcal/mol, with corresponding free energies of activation for ethene removal of (ECG0 a) of 27.1 and 22.6 kcal/mol."
          [81] "For the other six-membered ring structure S6b, we studied four distinct carbenium activation paths."
          [82] "The energetics of all four reaction pathways are very similar due to symmetry of the site S6b."
          [83] "Because site S6b is less stable (H 0 red less en- dothermic in Table 1) than S6a, the activation barriers for carbe- nium activation are lower."
          [84] "Free energies of carbenium activation (CG0 a) are 87.0, 89.1, 88.2, and 94.1 kcal/mol."
          [85] "As reported in Table 2, the free energies of activation for ethene desorption are about 28 kcal/mol for all four reaction paths."
          [86] "For the 8-membered ring Z8a, 3.6 kcal/mol heat of re- duction indicates the formation of the [GaH2]+Z m is slightly exothermic."
          [87] "The lower stability of the site Z8a leads to lower free energies of the carbenium activation (62.6 and 62.0 kcal/ mol for two pathways)."

          [95] "In our previous publication on the role of frameworkAl pair sites, we specifically focused on the carbenium activation mechanism, expecting a very high activation barrier [33,41] for alkene desorption from Gaalkyl species."
          [96] "Frash and van Santen [41] showed that for the active site involving single- frameworkAl, alkyl activation has a lower activation barrier than carbenium activation."
          [97] "A similar trend is expected for the frameworkAl pair sites."
          [98] "Similar to the carbenium activation,here the first step involves opening of the GaO coordination (A + C2H6 [B] D in Scheme 3) to form the activated intermediate D."
          [99] "In contrast to end-on adsorbed complex for carbenium activation, for alkyl activation, we observed that the methyl group adsorbs in a sidewise fashion (intermediate D in Scheme 3)."
          [100] "In this activated intermediate, only two hydro- gen atoms and the carbon of the methyl group are closer to the undercoordinated Ga."
          [101] "On the opposite side of the Ga, the third hydrogen of the methyl group is closer to the framework oxy- gen."
          [102] "This CH bond of the methyl group is strongly polarized and elongated."
          [103] "Thus, the geometry of the intermediate D for alkyl activation is conducive for the formation of the Gaalkyl species and Brnsted acid site."
          [104] "Thus, to compare different alkyl activation paths,we have defined an activation energy term called the overall alkyl activation barrier (AEa), representing the energy differ- ence between E and A + C2H6."
          [105] "This activation barrier is the approximate apparent activation barrier, because we have ne- glected the possible presence of the intermediates B and D for our analysis."
          [106] "We calculated the corresponding free energy change (AG0 a) for A + C2H6 E transformation and in Ta- ble 3 report the energy terms for all of the alkyl activation paths:alkyl activation energy (AEa), standard free energies of acti- vation (AG0 a at 25 C and 1 atm), reaction energy (AEr),and free energy change for alkyl activation (AG0 r )."
          [107] "Alkyl activation is followed by desorption of an alkene (ethene) from the Gaalkyl intermediate (F [I] J K + C2H4), leaving behind the gallium dihydride species ([GaH2]+Z m)."
          [108] "Relaxation of the transition state I toward prod- uct leads to the formation of the intermediate J with ethene adsorbed (Ï-bonded) on the [GaH2]+Z m."
          [109] "Intermediate J indi- cates that the tetrahedral Ga species is coordinated with only one framework oxygen (monodentate)."
          [110] "After the desorption of ethene, the [GaH2]+ species should relax to the more stable bidentate coordination (species K), as shown in Scheme 3."
          [111] "Various energy terms for ethene desorption (EAEa, EAG0 a, EAEr and EAG0 r ) are reported in Table 3."
          [112] "Desorption of ethene from Gaalkyl species has been well studied [33,41], and a very high activation barrier of about 60 kcal/mol has been reported."
          [113] "Because desorption is associated with the Ga species adjacent to a single-framework Al, the activation barrier is expected to be independent (structure insensitive) of the dis- tance between the framework Alpair."
          [114] "In the reminder of this section, we discuss the details of the alkyl activation mecha- nism for each catalytic site."
          [115] "For the 4-membered ring cluster Z4a, the overall free energy of alkyl activation (AG0 a) is lower than the carbenium acti- vation: 47.6 and 42.7 kcal/mol (Table 3) for alkyl activation,compared with 61.1 and 58.4 kcal/mol (Table 2) for carbenium activation."
          [116] "The free energies of activation for ethene removal are 62.0 and 64.4 kcal/mol, respectively."
          [117] "The stability of the bicationic gallium monohydride species in the S5a ring makes alkyl activation more difficult compared with that for Z4a."
          [118] "As expected, the free energy activation bar- riers (66.4, 61.9, 66.6, and 54.7 kcal/mol) are lower than those for carbenium activation."
          [119] "The structure-insensitive ethene re- moval step faces typical free energy barriers of 56.5, 57.8, 48.8,and 63.9 kcal/mol."

          [124] "The Z8a ring structure provides a less stable coordina- tion for the [GaH]2+ species, with lower resulting activation barriers for CH dissociation by the alkyl activation mecha- nism."
          [125] "We calculated the free energy activation barriers to be 42.5 and 37.7 kcal/mol."
          [126] "Ethene removal barriers of 63.3 and 64.1 kcal/mol would make this the rate-limiting step."
          [127] "For the least stable site, Z8b, the alkyl activation barriers (AG0 a) are 29.0 and 27.0 kcal/mol."
          [128] "The barriers for the forma- tion of the undercoordinated GaH species are relatively higher."
          [129] "The ethene desorption barriers are 65.5 and 66.8 kcal/mol for this particular site."
          [130] "Thus, alkene desorption is a rate-limiting step for the overall alkyl activation catalytic cycle irrespec- tive of the activity of the particular catalytic site."

          [134] "We also calculated an activation bar- rier of 54.6 kcal/mol using a single-framework substitution model of the active site as described previously [33]."
          [135] "Thus, this mechanism of decomposition should set a lower limit of about 55 kcal/mol for the apparent activation barrier."
          [136] "We repeated the calculation of this cyclic transition state for all the pair site models; the resulting activation energies (EDEa) are reported in Table 3."
          [137] "The constant values of EDEa suggest that this decomposition mechanism is a structure- insensitive reaction."

[1] "The authors concluded that the alkyl activation path for [HGaH]+ species is the actual path for dehydrogenation."
          [2] "However, this conclusion was based on the observation that at higher temperatures, the initial CH activation step becomes the rate-determining step, and the calculated activation barrier (3940 kcal/mol) for this first step is in close agreement with the experimentally estimated value of 39 kcal/mol [20]."
          [3] "We find that the activation energy for initial CH activation is substantially higher (48.66 kcal/mol) compared to their previously calculated [37] value of 37.9 kcal/mol."

          [7] "We conclude from the previous literature, and from our extension here, that the single site, [HGaH]+, model does not represent the true mechanism for Ga-assisted dehydrogenation."
          [8] "We find the energy barrier for CH activation is 85.72 kcal/mol, corresponding to the initial alkane adsorption and hydrogen removal."
          [9] "The activation barrier for this step (process V + C2H6 ! TS11 in Fig. 7) is very high considering the other reaction paths we have presented so far."
          [10] "The activation barrier for hydrogen removal is substantially smaller than that for CH activation."

[1] "Similar to the carbenium mechanism, the alkyl mechanism could be at play regardless of the specific structure of active Ga species, on which propane is initially activated by the metal cation to form the alkyl gallium intermediate, followed by the Î²-elimination and the desorption of propylene and H2."

          [2] "The modifying cations play key roles in dehydrogenation of paraffins [25,1416], whereas Brnsted acid protons catalyze the oligomerization of the olefins thus produced and possibly their subsequent aromatization."

          [11] "The low energy of the d-orbitals of Ga+ and its occupied s-orbital that make them unable to donate or accept electrons,respectively, from the hydrocarbon result in a high barrier for the direct oxidative addition of ethane to the cation."
          [12] "Therefore,heterolytic splitting of the CH bond is much more favorable due to the polarization induced by the interaction of the hydrocarbon with the Ga...O Lewis acidbase pair."

          [4] "When hydrogen is the reducing agent, the decomposition of the binuclear oxidic species is partially reversed when hydrogen flow is replaced by inert gas, but when the reducing agent is propane the formation of isolated Ga(I) species is irreversible, probably because it is stabilized by alkyl groups bonded to gallium, that were seen to be formed and to be stable when propane flow is replaced by inert gas."

          [3] "The initial rate of propene formation is much higher on Ga/H-ZSM5 and Zn/H-ZSM5 compared to H-ZSM5, but isotopic evidence from C3Hs/C3D 8 mixtures show that C-H bond activation rate depends weakly on the presence of Ga and Zn."
          [4] "Reactions over Na-ZSM5 confirm that C-H bond activation occurs predominantly on BrOnsted acid sites."
          [5] "Ga and Zn sites increase the rate of propene formation by removing H-atoms from acid sites that activate C-H bonds, allowing acid sites to turnover without the formation of cracking products."
          [6] "Ga and Zn act as 'portholes' and catalyze the recombinative desorption of H-atoms, formed from acid-catalyzed C-H bond cleavage, as all-hydrogen (He)."
          [7] "Adsorption-desorption steps,however, remain irreversible and not fully equi- librated even on Ga/H-ZSM5 and Zn/H- ZSM5."
          [8] "This H-atom disposal step remains the rate-determining step for each sequential dehy- drogenation reaction required to convert propane to aromatics."
          [9] "The presence of Ga species allows gas phase hydrogen to dissocia- tively adsorb and to effectively compete for surface sites, thus decreasing aromatic selectiv- ity."
          [10] "The addition of 13CO2 also increases the aromatics selectivity on H-ZSM5 (Fig. 24)."
          [11] "The introduction of alternate H-disposal path- ways, whether by using stoichiometric acceptors (CO, CO 2, or 0 2) or metal cations (Ga or Zn),removes the burden of hydrogen removal from other steps that form light alkanes and reduce aromatics selectivity."
          [12] "The addition of metal cations also increases the deuterium content in 'unreacted' propane (Fig. 18)."
          [13] "The addition of Ga and Zn increase the deuterium incorporation turnovers (Fig. 19)."
          [14] "Ga and Zn species increase the rate of both H-atom recombinative desorption and of H 2 dissociative adsorption during propane dehydrocyclodimerization reactions [22,28,29,42]."

[1] "The two basic mechanisms of CH activationcarbenium activation and alkyl activationare shown in Schemes 2 and 3,respectively."
          [2] "The carbenium activation involves CH bond po- larization in such a way that the carbon atom assumes a positive partial charge (Î´+) and hydrogen assumes a negative partial charge (Î´). Carbenium activation leads to the formation of alkoxide and metal hydride (MH) as an intermediate."
          [3] "In contrast, alkyl activation (Scheme 3) involves CH polarization in such a way that the carbon develops a negative (Î´) charge and the hydrogen develops a positive (Î´+) charge. Alkyl activation leads to the formation of a metal-alkyl (MCnH2n+1) and the Brnsted acid as intermediates."
          [4] "We investigated both mecha- nisms for all of the clusters discussed so far, and we discuss the results next."
          [5] "The first step involves the opening of the GaO coordination (A + C2H6 [B] D in Scheme 2) to form the activated intermediate D."
          [6] "The intermediate D further undergoes carbenium activation,as shown in Scheme 2 (D [E] F)."
          [7] "Carbenium activation is followed by the desorption of an alkene (ethene) from the alkoxide intermediate (F [I] J K + C2H4), leaving behind the Brnsted acid site."
          [8] "The intermediate D further undergoes alkyl activation as shown in Scheme 3 (D [E] F)."
          [9] "Alkyl activation is followed by desorption of an alkene (ethene) from the Gaalkyl intermediate (F [I] J K + C2H4), leaving behind the gallium dihydride species ([GaH2]+Z m)."
          [10] "The overall carbenium activation barrier (CEa) decreases rapidly with decreasing (more exothermic) heat of reduction (H 0 red)."
          [11] "A linear Polanyi relation [47] between the overall alkyl activa- tion barrier (AEa) and the heat of reduction (H 0 red) is seen."
          [12] "Although alkyl activation is much more facile than the carbenium activation, ethene removal from [HGaC2H5]+Z m intermediate faces a very high activation bar- rier of 60 kcal/mol."
          [13] "Thus, we conclude that this intermediate will be a spectator species while dominating the surface inter- mediates."
          [14] "This conclusion agrees well with recent experimental observations [26]."
          [15] "For the 4-membered ring cluster Z4a, the overall free energy of alkyl activation (AG0 a) is lower than the carbenium acti- vation: 47.6 and 42.7 kcal/mol (Table 3) for alkyl activation,compared with 61.1 and 58.4 kcal/mol (Table 2) for carbenium activation."
          [16] "Thus, alkene desorption is a rate-limiting step for the overall alkyl activation catalytic cycle irrespec- tive of the activity of the particular catalytic site."
          [17] "Recently, Pidko et al. [42] reported a novel one-step H2 and C2H4 de- sorption pathway from gallium alkyl intermediate."
          [18] "This path- way involves a cyclic transition state with an activation bar- rier of 53.5 kcal/mol."
          [19] "We also calculated an activation bar- rier of 54.6 kcal/mol using a single-framework substitution model of the active site as described previously [33]."
          [20] "Thus, this mechanism of decomposition should set a lower limit of about 55 kcal/mol for the apparent activation barrier."
          [21] "The free energies of carbenium activation (A + C2H6 E, CG0 a) for four differ- ent reaction paths are 85.4, 81.4, 92.3, and 81.7 kcal/mol."

          [45] "The first step involves the opening of the GaO coordination (A + C2H6 [B] D in Scheme 2) to form the activated intermediate D."
          [46] "Depending on the site geom- etry, the undercoordinated GaH (intermediate D), representing the activated catalytic site, may or may not be stable."
          [47] "The ethane molecule is adsorbed on to the electron-deficient, coor- dinately unsaturated GaH species."
          [48] "As was pointed out earlier,the CH bonds of the methyl group are strongly polarized and elongated."
          [49] "In general, we have observed that for carbenium activation, the methyl group adsorbs in an end-on fashion (in- termediate D in Scheme 2)."
          [50] "In contrast to end-on adsorbed complex for carbenium activation, for alkyl activation, we observed that the methyl group adsorbs in a sidewise fashion (intermediate D in Scheme 3)."
          [51] "In this activated intermediate, only two hydro- gen atoms and the carbon of the methyl group are closer to the undercoordinated Ga."
          [52] "On the opposite side of the Ga, the third hydrogen of the methyl group is closer to the framework oxy- gen."
          [53] "This CH bond of the methyl group is strongly polarized and elongated."
          [54] "Thus, the geometry of the intermediate D for alkyl activation is conducive for the formation of the Gaalkyl species and Brnsted acid site."
          [55] "Thus, to compare different carbenium activation paths, we define an activation energy term called the overall carbenium activation barrier (CEa)."
          [56] "This activation barrier represents the upper limit of the apparent activation barrier; the actual apparent ac- tivation barrier will depend on the surface coverage and hence on the reaction conditions, which can be determined via rig- orous kinetic simulation [29]."
          [57] "We calculated the free energy change for A + C2H6 E activation (CG0 a), which allowed us to compare the reaction rate along a certain reaction path and determine the rate-controlling step."
          [58] "For all active site struc- tures, energy parameters related to carbenium activation are listed in Table 2."
          [59] "Carbenium activation is followed by the desorption of an alkene (ethene) from the alkoxide intermediate (F [I] J K + C2H4), leaving behind the Brnsted acid site."
          [60] "However, a proton jump from one bridging oxygen to other is much more facile [62] compared with the other mecha- nistic steps."
          [61] "In the discussions on the hydrogen desorption step that fol- lows, we start with the Brnsted acid site on the same bridging oxygen (intermediate K) bearing the alkoxide intermediate, to be consistent with the reduction path of the [GaH]2+Z2 d site."
          [62] "The related energy parameters (ECEa, ECG0 a, ECEr, and ECG0 r ) for ethene desorption are listed in Table 2."
          [63] "As ex- pected, the activation barrier (ECEa) is fairly constant, vary- ing around 2535 kcal/mol."
          [64] "This mechanistic step is known as a structure-insensitive reaction in the sense that the activation barrier does not depend on the distance between the pair of the framework Al."
          [65] "In any case, starting from the alkoxide interme- diate, the free energy of activation for alkene desorption is well"
          [66] "below of that for carbenium activation and thus will be incon- sequential in determining the resulting apparent free energy of activation for the dehydrogenation reaction."
          [67] "For the Z4a ring, the undercoordinated Ga species [GaH]2+ lies in the plane with OAlO, in contrast to the more tetra- hedral coordination of the Ga for the other cluster structures."
          [68] "At the same time, the 4-member ring presents an exception to the end-on adsorbed complex observed for alkyl activa- tion."
          [69] "The steric repulsion of the walls surrounding the smaller ring could be a reason for the preferred sidewise adsorption of the ethane molecule."
          [70] "The overall free energies of carbe- nium activation (CG0 a) for the two paths for Z4a site are 61.1 and 58.5 kcal/mol."
          [71] "As discussed previously, for the carbenium activation mechanism, desorption of an alkene from alkoxide intermediate is much more facile with a ECG0 a of 24.7 and 26.8 kcal/mol."
          [72] "For each of the four reduction pathways for S5a, there is a distinct carbenium activation pathway."
          [73] "The stability of the active site in the monohydride form transpires into the higher activation energy for carbenium activation."
          [74] "The free energies of carbenium activation (A + C2H6 E, CG0 a) for four differ- ent reaction paths are 85.4, 81.4, 92.3, and 81.7 kcal/mol."
          [75] "The corresponding free energy barriers for ethene removal (F I in Scheme 2) are 20.0, 34.0, 21.6, and 29.6 kcal/mol."
          [76] "Again,note that ethene removal from alkoxide is very facile compared with the carbenium activation mechanism."
          [77] "The six-membered ring S6a provides the most stable coor- dination for the [GaH]2+ species."
          [78] "Correspondingly, the highest activation barrier for the carbenium activation is observed."
          [79] "As noted previously [33], due to the higher stability of the cat- alytic site S6a in the monohydride form, the undercoordinated [GaH]2+ species (B and D) are absent along the reaction path."
          [80] "The free energies of carbenium activation (CG0 a) for the two mechanistic paths (A + C2H6 E in Scheme 2) are 96.4 and 99.2 kcal/mol, with corresponding free energies of activation for ethene removal of (ECG0 a) of 27.1 and 22.6 kcal/mol."
          [81] "For the other six-membered ring structure S6b, we studied four distinct carbenium activation paths."
          [82] "The energetics of all four reaction pathways are very similar due to symmetry of the site S6b."
          [83] "Because site S6b is less stable (H 0 red less en- dothermic in Table 1) than S6a, the activation barriers for carbe- nium activation are lower."
          [84] "Free energies of carbenium activation (CG0 a) are 87.0, 89.1, 88.2, and 94.1 kcal/mol."
          [85] "As reported in Table 2, the free energies of activation for ethene desorption are about 28 kcal/mol for all four reaction paths."
          [86] "For the 8-membered ring Z8a, 3.6 kcal/mol heat of re- duction indicates the formation of the [GaH2]+Z m is slightly exothermic."

[1] "The authors concluded that the alkyl activation path for [HGaH]+ species is the actual path for dehydrogenation."

          [11] "The activation barrier for CH activation is directly related to the large endothermicity of the CH activation step (DE = 51.40 kcal/mol)."

[1] "Similar to the carbenium mechanism, the alkyl mechanism could be at play regardless of the specific structure of active Ga species, on which propane is initially activated by the metal cation to form the alkyl gallium intermediate, followed by the Î²-elimination and the desorption of propylene and H2."

          [2] "The modifying cations play key roles in dehydrogenation of paraffins [25,1416], whereas Brnsted acid protons catalyze the oligomerization of the olefins thus produced and possibly their subsequent aromatization."
          [3] "The initial step of CH activation is the oxidative addition of an alkane molecule to the Ga+ cation, which proceeds via an indirect heterolytic mechanism involving the basic oxygen atoms of the zeolite lattice."

          [5] "The overall activation energy of the ethane dehydrogenation over the reduced dehydrogenated Ga/ZSM-5 zeolite is 233 kJ/mol."
          [6] "The mechanism of the initial activation of the hydrocarbon molecule on dihydrido-gallyl ion is very similar to that suggested for the heterolytic dissociation of ethane on Ga Zd."
          [7] "The calculated activation energy for this elementary step (193 kJ/mol) is significantly higher than that (158 kJ/mol) reported previously [17] for GaH2+ species stabilized in a fully optimized 3T cluster."
          [8] "The activation energy for this process was 257 kJ/mol, in an excellent agreement with the previously reported values of 258 kJ/mol [22] and 254 kJ/mol [17]."
          [9] "The activation energy for this process [IV VI; Fig. 4, route (b)] is equal to 104 kJ/mol."
          [10] "The activation energies and enthalpies for both the ho- molytic and heterolytic CH bond cleavage on Ga+ ion in Zs clusters are very similar to those calculated for the distantly separated Al atoms."

          [2] "A comparison of the computed energetics of the various reaction paths for ethane indicates that the catalytic reaction most likely proceeds over Ga+."
          [3] "The initial step of CH activation is the oxidative addition of an alkane molecule to the Ga+ cation, which proceeds via an indirect heterolytic mechanism involving the basic oxygen atoms of the zeolite lattice."

          [11] "The low energy of the d-orbitals of Ga+ and its occupied s-orbital that make them unable to donate or accept electrons,respectively, from the hydrocarbon result in a high barrier for the direct oxidative addition of ethane to the cation."
          [12] "Therefore,heterolytic splitting of the CH bond is much more favorable due to the polarization induced by the interaction of the hydrocarbon with the Ga...O Lewis acidbase pair."

          [17] "In addition, the estimated overall activation barrier for the considered catalytic reaction is higher (by 58 kJ/mol) for GaH2+ sites than for Ga+ sites."
          [18] "Bivalent GaH+2 species stabilized at the cation site with distantly separated framework Al sites exhibit significantly higher initial activity for ethane activation but much lower stability compared with Ga+ sites."

[1] "The results in the present paper complement our previous ones on the genesis of the reduced gallium species in Ga/HZSM5 catalysts."
          [2] "The formation of isolated Ga(I) species from binuclear oxidic gallium clusters involves the production of Lewis from Brnsted acid sites in a 1:1 basis."
          [3] "This process is accompanied by some de-alumination of the zeolite framework to produce extraframework alumina, which also helps to explain the decrease in Brnsted acidity and increase in Lewis acidity."
          [4] "When hydrogen is the reducing agent, the decomposition of the binuclear oxidic species is partially reversed when hydrogen flow is replaced by inert gas, but when the reducing agent is propane the formation of isolated Ga(I) species is irreversible, probably because it is stabilized by alkyl groups bonded to gallium, that were seen to be formed and to be stable when propane flow is replaced by inert gas."
          [5] "Dihydridogallium ions were observed after reduction in hydrogen, but were slowly decomposed when hydrogen flow was replaced by inert gas."
          [6] "This slow decomposition of the dihydridogallium ions shows that it cannot intermediate hydrogen desorption during the aromatization reaction."
          [7] "However, when hydrogen is replaced by propane, the dihydrido species appear to be rapidly replaced by alkylgallium ions."
          [8] "Under propane flow, dihydridogallium cations were never detected."
          [9] "These facts show that it cannot be the active site for alkane activation, as proposed by some investigators."
          [10] "It was also shown that gas phase hydrogen added at the beginning of the reaction has a strong influence on catalysts activity and selectivity."
          [11] "Our results demonstrate that, while dehydrogenation reactions are inhibited by increasing hydrogen partial pressure, hydrogenolysis activities go through a maximum."
          [12] "This maximum shows that, while hydrogen takes part in hydrogenolysis reactions, it competes with propane for the active sites."

          [3] "The initial rate of propene formation is much higher on Ga/H-ZSM5 and Zn/H-ZSM5 compared to H-ZSM5, but isotopic evidence from C3Hs/C3D 8 mixtures show that C-H bond activation rate depends weakly on the presence of Ga and Zn."
          [4] "Reactions over Na-ZSM5 confirm that C-H bond activation occurs predominantly on BrOnsted acid sites."
          [5] "Ga and Zn sites increase the rate of propene formation by removing H-atoms from acid sites that activate C-H bonds, allowing acid sites to turnover without the formation of cracking products."
          [6] "Ga and Zn act as 'portholes' and catalyze the recombinative desorption of H-atoms, formed from acid-catalyzed C-H bond cleavage, as all-hydrogen (He)."
          [7] "Adsorption-desorption steps,however, remain irreversible and not fully equi- librated even on Ga/H-ZSM5 and Zn/H- ZSM5."
          [8] "This H-atom disposal step remains the rate-determining step for each sequential dehy- drogenation reaction required to convert propane to aromatics."

[1] "The two basic mechanisms of CH activationcarbenium activation and alkyl activationare shown in Schemes 2 and 3,respectively."
          [2] "The carbenium activation involves CH bond po- larization in such a way that the carbon atom assumes a positive partial charge (Î´+) and hydrogen assumes a negative partial charge (Î´). Carbenium activation leads to the formation of alkoxide and metal hydride (MH) as an intermediate."
          [3] "In contrast, alkyl activation (Scheme 3) involves CH polarization in such a way that the carbon develops a negative (Î´) charge and the hydrogen develops a positive (Î´+) charge. Alkyl activation leads to the formation of a metal-alkyl (MCnH2n+1) and the Brnsted acid as intermediates."
          [4] "We investigated both mecha- nisms for all of the clusters discussed so far, and we discuss the results next."
          [5] "The first step involves the opening of the GaO coordination (A + C2H6 [B] D in Scheme 2) to form the activated intermediate D."
          [6] "The intermediate D further undergoes carbenium activation,as shown in Scheme 2 (D [E] F)."
          [7] "Carbenium activation is followed by the desorption of an alkene (ethene) from the alkoxide intermediate (F [I] J K + C2H4), leaving behind the Brnsted acid site."

          [12] "Although alkyl activation is much more facile than the carbenium activation, ethene removal from [HGaC2H5]+Z m intermediate faces a very high activation bar- rier of 60 kcal/mol."
          [13] "Thus, we conclude that this intermediate will be a spectator species while dominating the surface inter- mediates."
          [14] "This conclusion agrees well with recent experimental observations [26]."
          [15] "For the 4-membered ring cluster Z4a, the overall free energy of alkyl activation (AG0 a) is lower than the carbenium acti- vation: 47.6 and 42.7 kcal/mol (Table 3) for alkyl activation,compared with 61.1 and 58.4 kcal/mol (Table 2) for carbenium activation."
          [16] "Thus, alkene desorption is a rate-limiting step for the overall alkyl activation catalytic cycle irrespec- tive of the activity of the particular catalytic site."
          [17] "Recently, Pidko et al. [42] reported a novel one-step H2 and C2H4 de- sorption pathway from gallium alkyl intermediate."

          [40] "Ethene removal barriers of 63.3 and 64.1 kcal/mol would make this the rate-limiting step."
          [41] "For the least stable site, Z8b, the alkyl activation barriers (AG0 a) are 29.0 and 27.0 kcal/mol."
          [42] "The barriers for the forma- tion of the undercoordinated GaH species are relatively higher."
          [43] "The ethene desorption barriers are 65.5 and 66.8 kcal/mol for this particular site."

          [45] "The first step involves the opening of the GaO coordination (A + C2H6 [B] D in Scheme 2) to form the activated intermediate D."
          [46] "Depending on the site geom- etry, the undercoordinated GaH (intermediate D), representing the activated catalytic site, may or may not be stable."

          [48] "As was pointed out earlier,the CH bonds of the methyl group are strongly polarized and elongated."
          [49] "In general, we have observed that for carbenium activation, the methyl group adsorbs in an end-on fashion (in- termediate D in Scheme 2)."
          [50] "In contrast to end-on adsorbed complex for carbenium activation, for alkyl activation, we observed that the methyl group adsorbs in a sidewise fashion (intermediate D in Scheme 3)."
          [51] "In this activated intermediate, only two hydro- gen atoms and the carbon of the methyl group are closer to the undercoordinated Ga."
          [52] "On the opposite side of the Ga, the third hydrogen of the methyl group is closer to the framework oxy- gen."
          [53] "This CH bond of the methyl group is strongly polarized and elongated."
          [54] "Thus, the geometry of the intermediate D for alkyl activation is conducive for the formation of the Gaalkyl species and Brnsted acid site."
          [55] "Thus, to compare different carbenium activation paths, we define an activation energy term called the overall carbenium activation barrier (CEa)."
          [56] "This activation barrier represents the upper limit of the apparent activation barrier; the actual apparent ac- tivation barrier will depend on the surface coverage and hence on the reaction conditions, which can be determined via rig- orous kinetic simulation [29]."
          [57] "We calculated the free energy change for A + C2H6 E activation (CG0 a), which allowed us to compare the reaction rate along a certain reaction path and determine the rate-controlling step."

          [63] "As ex- pected, the activation barrier (ECEa) is fairly constant, vary- ing around 2535 kcal/mol."
          [64] "This mechanistic step is known as a structure-insensitive reaction in the sense that the activation barrier does not depend on the distance between the pair of the framework Al."
          [65] "In any case, starting from the alkoxide interme- diate, the free energy of activation for alkene desorption is well"

          [67] "For the Z4a ring, the undercoordinated Ga species [GaH]2+ lies in the plane with OAlO, in contrast to the more tetra- hedral coordination of the Ga for the other cluster structures."
          [68] "At the same time, the 4-member ring presents an exception to the end-on adsorbed complex observed for alkyl activa- tion."
          [69] "The steric repulsion of the walls surrounding the smaller ring could be a reason for the preferred sidewise adsorption of the ethane molecule."
          [70] "The overall free energies of carbe- nium activation (CG0 a) for the two paths for Z4a site are 61.1 and 58.5 kcal/mol."
          [71] "As discussed previously, for the carbenium activation mechanism, desorption of an alkene from alkoxide intermediate is much more facile with a ECG0 a of 24.7 and 26.8 kcal/mol."
          [72] "For each of the four reduction pathways for S5a, there is a distinct carbenium activation pathway."
          [73] "The stability of the active site in the monohydride form transpires into the higher activation energy for carbenium activation."
          [74] "The free energies of carbenium activation (A + C2H6 E, CG0 a) for four differ- ent reaction paths are 85.4, 81.4, 92.3, and 81.7 kcal/mol."
          [75] "The corresponding free energy barriers for ethene removal (F I in Scheme 2) are 20.0, 34.0, 21.6, and 29.6 kcal/mol."
          [76] "Again,note that ethene removal from alkoxide is very facile compared with the carbenium activation mechanism."
          [77] "The six-membered ring S6a provides the most stable coor- dination for the [GaH]2+ species."
          [78] "Correspondingly, the highest activation barrier for the carbenium activation is observed."
          [79] "As noted previously [33], due to the higher stability of the cat- alytic site S6a in the monohydride form, the undercoordinated [GaH]2+ species (B and D) are absent along the reaction path."
          [80] "The free energies of carbenium activation (CG0 a) for the two mechanistic paths (A + C2H6 E in Scheme 2) are 96.4 and 99.2 kcal/mol, with corresponding free energies of activation for ethene removal of (ECG0 a) of 27.1 and 22.6 kcal/mol."
          [81] "For the other six-membered ring structure S6b, we studied four distinct carbenium activation paths."
          [82] "The energetics of all four reaction pathways are very similar due to symmetry of the site S6b."
          [83] "Because site S6b is less stable (H 0 red less en- dothermic in Table 1) than S6a, the activation barriers for carbe- nium activation are lower."
          [84] "Free energies of carbenium activation (CG0 a) are 87.0, 89.1, 88.2, and 94.1 kcal/mol."
          [85] "As reported in Table 2, the free energies of activation for ethene desorption are about 28 kcal/mol for all four reaction paths."
          [86] "For the 8-membered ring Z8a, 3.6 kcal/mol heat of re- duction indicates the formation of the [GaH2]+Z m is slightly exothermic."
          [87] "The lower stability of the site Z8a leads to lower free energies of the carbenium activation (62.6 and 62.0 kcal/ mol for two pathways)."
          [88] "For the other 8-membered ring Z8b, the reduction is much more exothermic with H 0 red of 19.6 and 18.6 kcal/mol."

          [95] "In our previous publication on the role of frameworkAl pair sites, we specifically focused on the carbenium activation mechanism, expecting a very high activation barrier [33,41] for alkene desorption from Gaalkyl species."
          [96] "Frash and van Santen [41] showed that for the active site involving single- frameworkAl, alkyl activation has a lower activation barrier than carbenium activation."
          [97] "A similar trend is expected for the frameworkAl pair sites."
          [98] "Similar to the carbenium activation,here the first step involves opening of the GaO coordination (A + C2H6 [B] D in Scheme 3) to form the activated intermediate D."
          [99] "In contrast to end-on adsorbed complex for carbenium activation, for alkyl activation, we observed that the methyl group adsorbs in a sidewise fashion (intermediate D in Scheme 3)."
          [100] "In this activated intermediate, only two hydro- gen atoms and the carbon of the methyl group are closer to the undercoordinated Ga."
          [101] "On the opposite side of the Ga, the third hydrogen of the methyl group is closer to the framework oxy- gen."
          [102] "This CH bond of the methyl group is strongly polarized and elongated."
          [103] "Thus, the geometry of the intermediate D for alkyl activation is conducive for the formation of the Gaalkyl species and Brnsted acid site."
          [104] "Thus, to compare different alkyl activation paths,we have defined an activation energy term called the overall alkyl activation barrier (AEa), representing the energy differ- ence between E and A + C2H6."
          [105] "This activation barrier is the approximate apparent activation barrier, because we have ne- glected the possible presence of the intermediates B and D for our analysis."
          [106] "We calculated the corresponding free energy change (AG0 a) for A + C2H6 E transformation and in Ta- ble 3 report the energy terms for all of the alkyl activation paths:alkyl activation energy (AEa), standard free energies of acti- vation (AG0 a at 25 C and 1 atm), reaction energy (AEr),and free energy change for alkyl activation (AG0 r )."
          [107] "Alkyl activation is followed by desorption of an alkene (ethene) from the Gaalkyl intermediate (F [I] J K + C2H4), leaving behind the gallium dihydride species ([GaH2]+Z m)."
          [108] "Relaxation of the transition state I toward prod- uct leads to the formation of the intermediate J with ethene adsorbed (Ï-bonded) on the [GaH2]+Z m."
          [109] "Intermediate J indi- cates that the tetrahedral Ga species is coordinated with only one framework oxygen (monodentate)."
          [110] "After the desorption of ethene, the [GaH2]+ species should relax to the more stable bidentate coordination (species K), as shown in Scheme 3."
          [111] "Various energy terms for ethene desorption (EAEa, EAG0 a, EAEr and EAG0 r ) are reported in Table 3."
          [112] "Desorption of ethene from Gaalkyl species has been well studied [33,41], and a very high activation barrier of about 60 kcal/mol has been reported."
          [113] "Because desorption is associated with the Ga species adjacent to a single-framework Al, the activation barrier is expected to be independent (structure insensitive) of the dis- tance between the framework Alpair."
          [114] "In the reminder of this section, we discuss the details of the alkyl activation mecha- nism for each catalytic site."
          [115] "For the 4-membered ring cluster Z4a, the overall free energy of alkyl activation (AG0 a) is lower than the carbenium acti- vation: 47.6 and 42.7 kcal/mol (Table 3) for alkyl activation,compared with 61.1 and 58.4 kcal/mol (Table 2) for carbenium activation."
          [116] "The free energies of activation for ethene removal are 62.0 and 64.4 kcal/mol, respectively."
          [117] "The stability of the bicationic gallium monohydride species in the S5a ring makes alkyl activation more difficult compared with that for Z4a."
          [118] "As expected, the free energy activation bar- riers (66.4, 61.9, 66.6, and 54.7 kcal/mol) are lower than those for carbenium activation."
          [119] "The structure-insensitive ethene re- moval step faces typical free energy barriers of 56.5, 57.8, 48.8,and 63.9 kcal/mol."

          [122] "The four alkyl activation pathways for the S6b site have free energy barriers (AG0 a) of 64.7, 67.9, 69.3, and 70.2 kcal/mol, with ethene removal barriers of ca."

          [124] "The Z8a ring structure provides a less stable coordina- tion for the [GaH]2+ species, with lower resulting activation barriers for CH dissociation by the alkyl activation mecha- nism."
          [125] "We calculated the free energy activation barriers to be 42.5 and 37.7 kcal/mol."
          [126] "Ethene removal barriers of 63.3 and 64.1 kcal/mol would make this the rate-limiting step."
          [127] "For the least stable site, Z8b, the alkyl activation barriers (AG0 a) are 29.0 and 27.0 kcal/mol."
          [128] "The barriers for the forma- tion of the undercoordinated GaH species are relatively higher."
          [129] "The ethene desorption barriers are 65.5 and 66.8 kcal/mol for this particular site."
          [130] "Thus, alkene desorption is a rate-limiting step for the overall alkyl activation catalytic cycle irrespec- tive of the activity of the particular catalytic site."

          [134] "We also calculated an activation bar- rier of 54.6 kcal/mol using a single-framework substitution model of the active site as described previously [33]."
          [135] "Thus, this mechanism of decomposition should set a lower limit of about 55 kcal/mol for the apparent activation barrier."
          [136] "We repeated the calculation of this cyclic transition state for all the pair site models; the resulting activation energies (EDEa) are reported in Table 3."
          [137] "The constant values of EDEa suggest that this decomposition mechanism is a structure- insensitive reaction."

[1] "The authors concluded that the alkyl activation path for [HGaH]+ species is the actual path for dehydrogenation."
          [2] "However, this conclusion was based on the observation that at higher temperatures, the initial CH activation step becomes the rate-determining step, and the calculated activation barrier (3940 kcal/mol) for this first step is in close agreement with the experimentally estimated value of 39 kcal/mol [20]."
          [3] "We find that the activation energy for initial CH activation is substantially higher (48.66 kcal/mol) compared to their previously calculated [37] value of 37.9 kcal/mol."

          [5] "The activation barrier for the alkyl desorption (process X ! TS4 in Fig. 3) was 61.67 kcal/mol, which is in close agreement with the previously reported [37] value of 60.7 kcal/mol."
          [6] "This high activationbarrierfor thealkylremovalstepshouldleadtovery low intrinsic reaction rate for the alkyl activation mechanism."
          [7] "We conclude from the previous literature, and from our extension here, that the single site, [HGaH]+, model does not represent the true mechanism for Ga-assisted dehydrogenation."
          [8] "We find the energy barrier for CH activation is 85.72 kcal/mol, corresponding to the initial alkane adsorption and hydrogen removal."
          [9] "The activation barrier for this step (process V + C2H6 ! TS11 in Fig. 7) is very high considering the other reaction paths we have presented so far."
          [10] "The activation barrier for hydrogen removal is substantially smaller than that for CH activation."
          [11] "The activation barrier for CH activation is directly related to the large endothermicity of the CH activation step (DE = 51.40 kcal/mol)."

[1] "Similar to the carbenium mechanism, the alkyl mechanism could be at play regardless of the specific structure of active Ga species, on which propane is initially activated by the metal cation to form the alkyl gallium intermediate, followed by the Î²-elimination and the desorption of propylene and H2."

          [2] "The modifying cations play key roles in dehydrogenation of paraffins [25,1416], whereas Brnsted acid protons catalyze the oligomerization of the olefins thus produced and possibly their subsequent aromatization."
          [3] "The initial step of CH activation is the oxidative addition of an alkane molecule to the Ga+ cation, which proceeds via an indirect heterolytic mechanism involving the basic oxygen atoms of the zeolite lattice."

          [6] "The mechanism of the initial activation of the hydrocarbon molecule on dihydrido-gallyl ion is very similar to that suggested for the heterolytic dissociation of ethane on Ga Zd."
          [7] "The calculated activation energy for this elementary step (193 kJ/mol) is significantly higher than that (158 kJ/mol) reported previously [17] for GaH2+ species stabilized in a fully optimized 3T cluster."
          [8] "The activation energy for this process was 257 kJ/mol, in an excellent agreement with the previously reported values of 258 kJ/mol [22] and 254 kJ/mol [17]."

          [11] "The low energy of the d-orbitals of Ga+ and its occupied s-orbital that make them unable to donate or accept electrons,respectively, from the hydrocarbon result in a high barrier for the direct oxidative addition of ethane to the cation."
          [12] "Therefore,heterolytic splitting of the CH bond is much more favorable due to the polarization induced by the interaction of the hydrocarbon with the Ga...O Lewis acidbase pair."
          [13] "The resulting product easily rearranges to form [HGaC2H5]+, which decomposes via simultaneous desorption of H2 and C2H4, regenerating the initial Ga+ species."

          [20] "On the other hand, GaH+2 ions charge-compensating two proximate framework aluminum ions are the most stable cationic species; however, initial activation of the CH bond over these sites is strongly disfavored both thermodynamically and kinetically."

          [3] "This process is accompanied by some de-alumination of the zeolite framework to produce extraframework alumina, which also helps to explain the decrease in Brnsted acidity and increase in Lewis acidity."
          [4] "When hydrogen is the reducing agent, the decomposition of the binuclear oxidic species is partially reversed when hydrogen flow is replaced by inert gas, but when the reducing agent is propane the formation of isolated Ga(I) species is irreversible, probably because it is stabilized by alkyl groups bonded to gallium, that were seen to be formed and to be stable when propane flow is replaced by inert gas."

[1] "The beneficial effect of Ga on alkane aromatization rates and selectivity has been observed whether Ga ions are introduced by impregnation [16,26,28,29,33,35] or ion exchange techniques [15,18,22,23,32]."
          [2] "The addition of metal species to H-ZSM5 channels increase aromatic turnover rates and actually decrease cracking turnover rates (Fig. 3)."
          [3] "The initial rate of propene formation is much higher on Ga/H-ZSM5 and Zn/H-ZSM5 compared to H-ZSM5, but isotopic evidence from C3Hs/C3D 8 mixtures show that C-H bond activation rate depends weakly on the presence of Ga and Zn."
          [4] "Reactions over Na-ZSM5 confirm that C-H bond activation occurs predominantly on BrOnsted acid sites."
          [5] "Ga and Zn sites increase the rate of propene formation by removing H-atoms from acid sites that activate C-H bonds, allowing acid sites to turnover without the formation of cracking products."
          [6] "Ga and Zn act as 'portholes' and catalyze the recombinative desorption of H-atoms, formed from acid-catalyzed C-H bond cleavage, as all-hydrogen (He)."
          [7] "Adsorption-desorption steps,however, remain irreversible and not fully equi- librated even on Ga/H-ZSM5 and Zn/H- ZSM5."
          [8] "This H-atom disposal step remains the rate-determining step for each sequential dehy- drogenation reaction required to convert propane to aromatics."
          [9] "The presence of Ga species allows gas phase hydrogen to dissocia- tively adsorb and to effectively compete for surface sites, thus decreasing aromatic selectiv- ity."
          [10] "The addition of 13CO2 also increases the aromatics selectivity on H-ZSM5 (Fig. 24)."
          [11] "The introduction of alternate H-disposal path- ways, whether by using stoichiometric acceptors (CO, CO 2, or 0 2) or metal cations (Ga or Zn),removes the burden of hydrogen removal from other steps that form light alkanes and reduce aromatics selectivity."
          [12] "The addition of metal cations also increases the deuterium content in 'unreacted' propane (Fig. 18)."
          [13] "The addition of Ga and Zn increase the deuterium incorporation turnovers (Fig. 19)."
          [14] "Ga and Zn species increase the rate of both H-atom recombinative desorption and of H 2 dissociative adsorption during propane dehydrocyclodimerization reactions [22,28,29,42]."

[1] "The two basic mechanisms of CH activationcarbenium activation and alkyl activationare shown in Schemes 2 and 3,respectively."
          [2] "The carbenium activation involves CH bond po- larization in such a way that the carbon atom assumes a positive partial charge (Î´+) and hydrogen assumes a negative partial charge (Î´). Carbenium activation leads to the formation of alkoxide and metal hydride (MH) as an intermediate."
          [3] "In contrast, alkyl activation (Scheme 3) involves CH polarization in such a way that the carbon develops a negative (Î´) charge and the hydrogen develops a positive (Î´+) charge. Alkyl activation leads to the formation of a metal-alkyl (MCnH2n+1) and the Brnsted acid as intermediates."
          [4] "We investigated both mecha- nisms for all of the clusters discussed so far, and we discuss the results next."
          [5] "The first step involves the opening of the GaO coordination (A + C2H6 [B] D in Scheme 2) to form the activated intermediate D."
          [6] "The intermediate D further undergoes carbenium activation,as shown in Scheme 2 (D [E] F)."
          [7] "Carbenium activation is followed by the desorption of an alkene (ethene) from the alkoxide intermediate (F [I] J K + C2H4), leaving behind the Brnsted acid site."
          [8] "The intermediate D further undergoes alkyl activation as shown in Scheme 3 (D [E] F)."
          [9] "Alkyl activation is followed by desorption of an alkene (ethene) from the Gaalkyl intermediate (F [I] J K + C2H4), leaving behind the gallium dihydride species ([GaH2]+Z m)."
          [10] "The overall carbenium activation barrier (CEa) decreases rapidly with decreasing (more exothermic) heat of reduction (H 0 red)."
          [11] "A linear Polanyi relation [47] between the overall alkyl activa- tion barrier (AEa) and the heat of reduction (H 0 red) is seen."
          [12] "Although alkyl activation is much more facile than the carbenium activation, ethene removal from [HGaC2H5]+Z m intermediate faces a very high activation bar- rier of 60 kcal/mol."
          [13] "Thus, we conclude that this intermediate will be a spectator species while dominating the surface inter- mediates."
          [14] "This conclusion agrees well with recent experimental observations [26]."
          [15] "For the 4-membered ring cluster Z4a, the overall free energy of alkyl activation (AG0 a) is lower than the carbenium acti- vation: 47.6 and 42.7 kcal/mol (Table 3) for alkyl activation,compared with 61.1 and 58.4 kcal/mol (Table 2) for carbenium activation."
          [16] "Thus, alkene desorption is a rate-limiting step for the overall alkyl activation catalytic cycle irrespec- tive of the activity of the particular catalytic site."
          [17] "Recently, Pidko et al. [42] reported a novel one-step H2 and C2H4 de- sorption pathway from gallium alkyl intermediate."
          [18] "This path- way involves a cyclic transition state with an activation bar- rier of 53.5 kcal/mol."
          [19] "We also calculated an activation bar- rier of 54.6 kcal/mol using a single-framework substitution model of the active site as described previously [33]."
          [20] "Thus, this mechanism of decomposition should set a lower limit of about 55 kcal/mol for the apparent activation barrier."
          [21] "The free energies of carbenium activation (A + C2H6 E, CG0 a) for four differ- ent reaction paths are 85.4, 81.4, 92.3, and 81.7 kcal/mol."

          [45] "The first step involves the opening of the GaO coordination (A + C2H6 [B] D in Scheme 2) to form the activated intermediate D."
          [46] "Depending on the site geom- etry, the undercoordinated GaH (intermediate D), representing the activated catalytic site, may or may not be stable."
          [47] "The ethane molecule is adsorbed on to the electron-deficient, coor- dinately unsaturated GaH species."
          [48] "As was pointed out earlier,the CH bonds of the methyl group are strongly polarized and elongated."
          [49] "In general, we have observed that for carbenium activation, the methyl group adsorbs in an end-on fashion (in- termediate D in Scheme 2)."
          [50] "In contrast to end-on adsorbed complex for carbenium activation, for alkyl activation, we observed that the methyl group adsorbs in a sidewise fashion (intermediate D in Scheme 3)."
          [51] "In this activated intermediate, only two hydro- gen atoms and the carbon of the methyl group are closer to the undercoordinated Ga."
          [52] "On the opposite side of the Ga, the third hydrogen of the methyl group is closer to the framework oxy- gen."
          [53] "This CH bond of the methyl group is strongly polarized and elongated."
          [54] "Thus, the geometry of the intermediate D for alkyl activation is conducive for the formation of the Gaalkyl species and Brnsted acid site."
          [55] "Thus, to compare different carbenium activation paths, we define an activation energy term called the overall carbenium activation barrier (CEa)."
          [56] "This activation barrier represents the upper limit of the apparent activation barrier; the actual apparent ac- tivation barrier will depend on the surface coverage and hence on the reaction conditions, which can be determined via rig- orous kinetic simulation [29]."
          [57] "We calculated the free energy change for A + C2H6 E activation (CG0 a), which allowed us to compare the reaction rate along a certain reaction path and determine the rate-controlling step."

          [59] "Carbenium activation is followed by the desorption of an alkene (ethene) from the alkoxide intermediate (F [I] J K + C2H4), leaving behind the Brnsted acid site."
          [60] "However, a proton jump from one bridging oxygen to other is much more facile [62] compared with the other mecha- nistic steps."
          [61] "In the discussions on the hydrogen desorption step that fol- lows, we start with the Brnsted acid site on the same bridging oxygen (intermediate K) bearing the alkoxide intermediate, to be consistent with the reduction path of the [GaH]2+Z2 d site."
          [62] "The related energy parameters (ECEa, ECG0 a, ECEr, and ECG0 r ) for ethene desorption are listed in Table 2."
          [63] "As ex- pected, the activation barrier (ECEa) is fairly constant, vary- ing around 2535 kcal/mol."
          [64] "This mechanistic step is known as a structure-insensitive reaction in the sense that the activation barrier does not depend on the distance between the pair of the framework Al."
          [65] "In any case, starting from the alkoxide interme- diate, the free energy of activation for alkene desorption is well"
          [66] "below of that for carbenium activation and thus will be incon- sequential in determining the resulting apparent free energy of activation for the dehydrogenation reaction."
          [67] "For the Z4a ring, the undercoordinated Ga species [GaH]2+ lies in the plane with OAlO, in contrast to the more tetra- hedral coordination of the Ga for the other cluster structures."
          [68] "At the same time, the 4-member ring presents an exception to the end-on adsorbed complex observed for alkyl activa- tion."
          [69] "The steric repulsion of the walls surrounding the smaller ring could be a reason for the preferred sidewise adsorption of the ethane molecule."
          [70] "The overall free energies of carbe- nium activation (CG0 a) for the two paths for Z4a site are 61.1 and 58.5 kcal/mol."
          [71] "As discussed previously, for the carbenium activation mechanism, desorption of an alkene from alkoxide intermediate is much more facile with a ECG0 a of 24.7 and 26.8 kcal/mol."
          [72] "For each of the four reduction pathways for S5a, there is a distinct carbenium activation pathway."
          [73] "The stability of the active site in the monohydride form transpires into the higher activation energy for carbenium activation."
          [74] "The free energies of carbenium activation (A + C2H6 E, CG0 a) for four differ- ent reaction paths are 85.4, 81.4, 92.3, and 81.7 kcal/mol."
          [75] "The corresponding free energy barriers for ethene removal (F I in Scheme 2) are 20.0, 34.0, 21.6, and 29.6 kcal/mol."
          [76] "Again,note that ethene removal from alkoxide is very facile compared with the carbenium activation mechanism."
          [77] "The six-membered ring S6a provides the most stable coor- dination for the [GaH]2+ species."
          [78] "Correspondingly, the highest activation barrier for the carbenium activation is observed."
          [79] "As noted previously [33], due to the higher stability of the cat- alytic site S6a in the monohydride form, the undercoordinated [GaH]2+ species (B and D) are absent along the reaction path."
          [80] "The free energies of carbenium activation (CG0 a) for the two mechanistic paths (A + C2H6 E in Scheme 2) are 96.4 and 99.2 kcal/mol, with corresponding free energies of activation for ethene removal of (ECG0 a) of 27.1 and 22.6 kcal/mol."
          [81] "For the other six-membered ring structure S6b, we studied four distinct carbenium activation paths."
          [82] "The energetics of all four reaction pathways are very similar due to symmetry of the site S6b."
          [83] "Because site S6b is less stable (H 0 red less en- dothermic in Table 1) than S6a, the activation barriers for carbe- nium activation are lower."
          [84] "Free energies of carbenium activation (CG0 a) are 87.0, 89.1, 88.2, and 94.1 kcal/mol."
          [85] "As reported in Table 2, the free energies of activation for ethene desorption are about 28 kcal/mol for all four reaction paths."
          [86] "For the 8-membered ring Z8a, 3.6 kcal/mol heat of re- duction indicates the formation of the [GaH2]+Z m is slightly exothermic."

          [95] "In our previous publication on the role of frameworkAl pair sites, we specifically focused on the carbenium activation mechanism, expecting a very high activation barrier [33,41] for alkene desorption from Gaalkyl species."
          [96] "Frash and van Santen [41] showed that for the active site involving single- frameworkAl, alkyl activation has a lower activation barrier than carbenium activation."

          [9] "The activation barrier for this step (process V + C2H6 ! TS11 in Fig. 7) is very high considering the other reaction paths we have presented so far."

          [11] "The activation barrier for CH activation is directly related to the large endothermicity of the CH activation step (DE = 51.40 kcal/mol)."

[1] "Similar to the carbenium mechanism, the alkyl mechanism could be at play regardless of the specific structure of active Ga species, on which propane is initially activated by the metal cation to form the alkyl gallium intermediate, followed by the Î²-elimination and the desorption of propylene and H2."

          [2] "The modifying cations play key roles in dehydrogenation of paraffins [25,1416], whereas Brnsted acid protons catalyze the oligomerization of the olefins thus produced and possibly their subsequent aromatization."

          [11] "The low energy of the d-orbitals of Ga+ and its occupied s-orbital that make them unable to donate or accept electrons,respectively, from the hydrocarbon result in a high barrier for the direct oxidative addition of ethane to the cation."

          [3] "This process is accompanied by some de-alumination of the zeolite framework to produce extraframework alumina, which also helps to explain the decrease in Brnsted acidity and increase in Lewis acidity."
          [4] "When hydrogen is the reducing agent, the decomposition of the binuclear oxidic species is partially reversed when hydrogen flow is replaced by inert gas, but when the reducing agent is propane the formation of isolated Ga(I) species is irreversible, probably because it is stabilized by alkyl groups bonded to gallium, that were seen to be formed and to be stable when propane flow is replaced by inert gas."
          [5] "Dihydridogallium ions were observed after reduction in hydrogen, but were slowly decomposed when hydrogen flow was replaced by inert gas."
          [6] "This slow decomposition of the dihydridogallium ions shows that it cannot intermediate hydrogen desorption during the aromatization reaction."

          [8] "Under propane flow, dihydridogallium cations were never detected."

          [3] "The initial rate of propene formation is much higher on Ga/H-ZSM5 and Zn/H-ZSM5 compared to H-ZSM5, but isotopic evidence from C3Hs/C3D 8 mixtures show that C-H bond activation rate depends weakly on the presence of Ga and Zn."
          [4] "Reactions over Na-ZSM5 confirm that C-H bond activation occurs predominantly on BrOnsted acid sites."
          [5] "Ga and Zn sites increase the rate of propene formation by removing H-atoms from acid sites that activate C-H bonds, allowing acid sites to turnover without the formation of cracking products."
          [6] "Ga and Zn act as 'portholes' and catalyze the recombinative desorption of H-atoms, formed from acid-catalyzed C-H bond cleavage, as all-hydrogen (He)."
          [7] "Adsorption-desorption steps,however, remain irreversible and not fully equi- librated even on Ga/H-ZSM5 and Zn/H- ZSM5."

[1] "The two basic mechanisms of CH activationcarbenium activation and alkyl activationare shown in Schemes 2 and 3,respectively."
          [2] "The carbenium activation involves CH bond po- larization in such a way that the carbon atom assumes a positive partial charge (Î´+) and hydrogen assumes a negative partial charge (Î´). Carbenium activation leads to the formation of alkoxide and metal hydride (MH) as an intermediate."
          [3] "In contrast, alkyl activation (Scheme 3) involves CH polarization in such a way that the carbon develops a negative (Î´) charge and the hydrogen develops a positive (Î´+) charge. Alkyl activation leads to the formation of a metal-alkyl (MCnH2n+1) and the Brnsted acid as intermediates."
          [4] "We investigated both mecha- nisms for all of the clusters discussed so far, and we discuss the results next."
          [5] "The first step involves the opening of the GaO coordination (A + C2H6 [B] D in Scheme 2) to form the activated intermediate D."
          [6] "The intermediate D further undergoes carbenium activation,as shown in Scheme 2 (D [E] F)."
          [7] "Carbenium activation is followed by the desorption of an alkene (ethene) from the alkoxide intermediate (F [I] J K + C2H4), leaving behind the Brnsted acid site."

          [12] "Although alkyl activation is much more facile than the carbenium activation, ethene removal from [HGaC2H5]+Z m intermediate faces a very high activation bar- rier of 60 kcal/mol."
          [13] "Thus, we conclude that this intermediate will be a spectator species while dominating the surface inter- mediates."
          [14] "This conclusion agrees well with recent experimental observations [26]."
          [15] "For the 4-membered ring cluster Z4a, the overall free energy of alkyl activation (AG0 a) is lower than the carbenium acti- vation: 47.6 and 42.7 kcal/mol (Table 3) for alkyl activation,compared with 61.1 and 58.4 kcal/mol (Table 2) for carbenium activation."
          [16] "Thus, alkene desorption is a rate-limiting step for the overall alkyl activation catalytic cycle irrespec- tive of the activity of the particular catalytic site."

          [40] "Ethene removal barriers of 63.3 and 64.1 kcal/mol would make this the rate-limiting step."
          [41] "For the least stable site, Z8b, the alkyl activation barriers (AG0 a) are 29.0 and 27.0 kcal/mol."
          [42] "The barriers for the forma- tion of the undercoordinated GaH species are relatively higher."
          [43] "The ethene desorption barriers are 65.5 and 66.8 kcal/mol for this particular site."

          [48] "As was pointed out earlier,the CH bonds of the methyl group are strongly polarized and elongated."
          [49] "In general, we have observed that for carbenium activation, the methyl group adsorbs in an end-on fashion (in- termediate D in Scheme 2)."
          [50] "In contrast to end-on adsorbed complex for carbenium activation, for alkyl activation, we observed that the methyl group adsorbs in a sidewise fashion (intermediate D in Scheme 3)."

          [53] "This CH bond of the methyl group is strongly polarized and elongated."
          [54] "Thus, the geometry of the intermediate D for alkyl activation is conducive for the formation of the Gaalkyl species and Brnsted acid site."
          [55] "Thus, to compare different carbenium activation paths, we define an activation energy term called the overall carbenium activation barrier (CEa)."
          [56] "This activation barrier represents the upper limit of the apparent activation barrier; the actual apparent ac- tivation barrier will depend on the surface coverage and hence on the reaction conditions, which can be determined via rig- orous kinetic simulation [29]."
          [57] "We calculated the free energy change for A + C2H6 E activation (CG0 a), which allowed us to compare the reaction rate along a certain reaction path and determine the rate-controlling step."

          [66] "below of that for carbenium activation and thus will be incon- sequential in determining the resulting apparent free energy of activation for the dehydrogenation reaction."
          [67] "For the Z4a ring, the undercoordinated Ga species [GaH]2+ lies in the plane with OAlO, in contrast to the more tetra- hedral coordination of the Ga for the other cluster structures."
          [68] "At the same time, the 4-member ring presents an exception to the end-on adsorbed complex observed for alkyl activa- tion."
          [69] "The steric repulsion of the walls surrounding the smaller ring could be a reason for the preferred sidewise adsorption of the ethane molecule."
          [70] "The overall free energies of carbe- nium activation (CG0 a) for the two paths for Z4a site are 61.1 and 58.5 kcal/mol."
          [71] "As discussed previously, for the carbenium activation mechanism, desorption of an alkene from alkoxide intermediate is much more facile with a ECG0 a of 24.7 and 26.8 kcal/mol."
          [72] "For each of the four reduction pathways for S5a, there is a distinct carbenium activation pathway."
          [73] "The stability of the active site in the monohydride form transpires into the higher activation energy for carbenium activation."
          [74] "The free energies of carbenium activation (A + C2H6 E, CG0 a) for four differ- ent reaction paths are 85.4, 81.4, 92.3, and 81.7 kcal/mol."
          [75] "The corresponding free energy barriers for ethene removal (F I in Scheme 2) are 20.0, 34.0, 21.6, and 29.6 kcal/mol."
          [76] "Again,note that ethene removal from alkoxide is very facile compared with the carbenium activation mechanism."
          [77] "The six-membered ring S6a provides the most stable coor- dination for the [GaH]2+ species."
          [78] "Correspondingly, the highest activation barrier for the carbenium activation is observed."
          [79] "As noted previously [33], due to the higher stability of the cat- alytic site S6a in the monohydride form, the undercoordinated [GaH]2+ species (B and D) are absent along the reaction path."
          [80] "The free energies of carbenium activation (CG0 a) for the two mechanistic paths (A + C2H6 E in Scheme 2) are 96.4 and 99.2 kcal/mol, with corresponding free energies of activation for ethene removal of (ECG0 a) of 27.1 and 22.6 kcal/mol."
          [81] "For the other six-membered ring structure S6b, we studied four distinct carbenium activation paths."
          [82] "The energetics of all four reaction pathways are very similar due to symmetry of the site S6b."
          [83] "Because site S6b is less stable (H 0 red less en- dothermic in Table 1) than S6a, the activation barriers for carbe- nium activation are lower."
          [84] "Free energies of carbenium activation (CG0 a) are 87.0, 89.1, 88.2, and 94.1 kcal/mol."
          [85] "As reported in Table 2, the free energies of activation for ethene desorption are about 28 kcal/mol for all four reaction paths."
          [86] "For the 8-membered ring Z8a, 3.6 kcal/mol heat of re- duction indicates the formation of the [GaH2]+Z m is slightly exothermic."
          [87] "The lower stability of the site Z8a leads to lower free energies of the carbenium activation (62.6 and 62.0 kcal/ mol for two pathways)."
          [88] "For the other 8-membered ring Z8b, the reduction is much more exothermic with H 0 red of 19.6 and 18.6 kcal/mol."

          [95] "In our previous publication on the role of frameworkAl pair sites, we specifically focused on the carbenium activation mechanism, expecting a very high activation barrier [33,41] for alkene desorption from Gaalkyl species."
          [96] "Frash and van Santen [41] showed that for the active site involving single- frameworkAl, alkyl activation has a lower activation barrier than carbenium activation."
          [97] "A similar trend is expected for the frameworkAl pair sites."
          [98] "Similar to the carbenium activation,here the first step involves opening of the GaO coordination (A + C2H6 [B] D in Scheme 3) to form the activated intermediate D."
          [99] "In contrast to end-on adsorbed complex for carbenium activation, for alkyl activation, we observed that the methyl group adsorbs in a sidewise fashion (intermediate D in Scheme 3)."
          [100] "In this activated intermediate, only two hydro- gen atoms and the carbon of the methyl group are closer to the undercoordinated Ga."
          [101] "On the opposite side of the Ga, the third hydrogen of the methyl group is closer to the framework oxy- gen."
          [102] "This CH bond of the methyl group is strongly polarized and elongated."
          [103] "Thus, the geometry of the intermediate D for alkyl activation is conducive for the formation of the Gaalkyl species and Brnsted acid site."
          [104] "Thus, to compare different alkyl activation paths,we have defined an activation energy term called the overall alkyl activation barrier (AEa), representing the energy differ- ence between E and A + C2H6."
          [105] "This activation barrier is the approximate apparent activation barrier, because we have ne- glected the possible presence of the intermediates B and D for our analysis."
          [106] "We calculated the corresponding free energy change (AG0 a) for A + C2H6 E transformation and in Ta- ble 3 report the energy terms for all of the alkyl activation paths:alkyl activation energy (AEa), standard free energies of acti- vation (AG0 a at 25 C and 1 atm), reaction energy (AEr),and free energy change for alkyl activation (AG0 r )."
          [107] "Alkyl activation is followed by desorption of an alkene (ethene) from the Gaalkyl intermediate (F [I] J K + C2H4), leaving behind the gallium dihydride species ([GaH2]+Z m)."
          [108] "Relaxation of the transition state I toward prod- uct leads to the formation of the intermediate J with ethene adsorbed (Ï-bonded) on the [GaH2]+Z m."
          [109] "Intermediate J indi- cates that the tetrahedral Ga species is coordinated with only one framework oxygen (monodentate)."
          [110] "After the desorption of ethene, the [GaH2]+ species should relax to the more stable bidentate coordination (species K), as shown in Scheme 3."
          [111] "Various energy terms for ethene desorption (EAEa, EAG0 a, EAEr and EAG0 r ) are reported in Table 3."
          [112] "Desorption of ethene from Gaalkyl species has been well studied [33,41], and a very high activation barrier of about 60 kcal/mol has been reported."
          [113] "Because desorption is associated with the Ga species adjacent to a single-framework Al, the activation barrier is expected to be independent (structure insensitive) of the dis- tance between the framework Alpair."
          [114] "In the reminder of this section, we discuss the details of the alkyl activation mecha- nism for each catalytic site."
          [115] "For the 4-membered ring cluster Z4a, the overall free energy of alkyl activation (AG0 a) is lower than the carbenium acti- vation: 47.6 and 42.7 kcal/mol (Table 3) for alkyl activation,compared with 61.1 and 58.4 kcal/mol (Table 2) for carbenium activation."
          [116] "The free energies of activation for ethene removal are 62.0 and 64.4 kcal/mol, respectively."
          [117] "The stability of the bicationic gallium monohydride species in the S5a ring makes alkyl activation more difficult compared with that for Z4a."
          [118] "As expected, the free energy activation bar- riers (66.4, 61.9, 66.6, and 54.7 kcal/mol) are lower than those for carbenium activation."
          [119] "The structure-insensitive ethene re- moval step faces typical free energy barriers of 56.5, 57.8, 48.8,and 63.9 kcal/mol."

          [124] "The Z8a ring structure provides a less stable coordina- tion for the [GaH]2+ species, with lower resulting activation barriers for CH dissociation by the alkyl activation mecha- nism."
          [125] "We calculated the free energy activation barriers to be 42.5 and 37.7 kcal/mol."
          [126] "Ethene removal barriers of 63.3 and 64.1 kcal/mol would make this the rate-limiting step."
          [127] "For the least stable site, Z8b, the alkyl activation barriers (AG0 a) are 29.0 and 27.0 kcal/mol."
          [128] "The barriers for the forma- tion of the undercoordinated GaH species are relatively higher."
          [129] "The ethene desorption barriers are 65.5 and 66.8 kcal/mol for this particular site."
          [130] "Thus, alkene desorption is a rate-limiting step for the overall alkyl activation catalytic cycle irrespec- tive of the activity of the particular catalytic site."

          [135] "Thus, this mechanism of decomposition should set a lower limit of about 55 kcal/mol for the apparent activation barrier."
          [136] "We repeated the calculation of this cyclic transition state for all the pair site models; the resulting activation energies (EDEa) are reported in Table 3."
          [137] "The constant values of EDEa suggest that this decomposition mechanism is a structure- insensitive reaction."

[1] "The authors concluded that the alkyl activation path for [HGaH]+ species is the actual path for dehydrogenation."
          [2] "However, this conclusion was based on the observation that at higher temperatures, the initial CH activation step becomes the rate-determining step, and the calculated activation barrier (3940 kcal/mol) for this first step is in close agreement with the experimentally estimated value of 39 kcal/mol [20]."
          [3] "We find that the activation energy for initial CH activation is substantially higher (48.66 kcal/mol) compared to their previously calculated [37] value of 37.9 kcal/mol."

          [7] "We conclude from the previous literature, and from our extension here, that the single site, [HGaH]+, model does not represent the true mechanism for Ga-assisted dehydrogenation."
          [8] "We find the energy barrier for CH activation is 85.72 kcal/mol, corresponding to the initial alkane adsorption and hydrogen removal."
          [9] "The activation barrier for this step (process V + C2H6 ! TS11 in Fig. 7) is very high considering the other reaction paths we have presented so far."
          [10] "The activation barrier for hydrogen removal is substantially smaller than that for CH activation."

[1] "Similar to the carbenium mechanism, the alkyl mechanism could be at play regardless of the specific structure of active Ga species, on which propane is initially activated by the metal cation to form the alkyl gallium intermediate, followed by the Î²-elimination and the desorption of propylene and H2."

          [2] "The modifying cations play key roles in dehydrogenation of paraffins [25,1416], whereas Brnsted acid protons catalyze the oligomerization of the olefins thus produced and possibly their subsequent aromatization."

          [11] "The low energy of the d-orbitals of Ga+ and its occupied s-orbital that make them unable to donate or accept electrons,respectively, from the hydrocarbon result in a high barrier for the direct oxidative addition of ethane to the cation."
          [12] "Therefore,heterolytic splitting of the CH bond is much more favorable due to the polarization induced by the interaction of the hydrocarbon with the Ga...O Lewis acidbase pair."

          [4] "When hydrogen is the reducing agent, the decomposition of the binuclear oxidic species is partially reversed when hydrogen flow is replaced by inert gas, but when the reducing agent is propane the formation of isolated Ga(I) species is irreversible, probably because it is stabilized by alkyl groups bonded to gallium, that were seen to be formed and to be stable when propane flow is replaced by inert gas."

          [29] "In their scheme,the alkyl- hydridogallium species in reaction (19) decomposes to produce an alkene molecule and regenerate the dihydrido active site."
          [30] "Our results suggest that the decomposition of the alkylhydrido inter- mediate occurs by reactions (17) and (18) instead."

[1] "The beneficial effect of Ga on alkane aromatization rates and selectivity has been observed whether Ga ions are introduced by impregnation [16,26,28,29,33,35] or ion exchange techniques [15,18,22,23,32]."
          [2] "The addition of metal species to H-ZSM5 channels increase aromatic turnover rates and actually decrease cracking turnover rates (Fig. 3)."
          [3] "The initial rate of propene formation is much higher on Ga/H-ZSM5 and Zn/H-ZSM5 compared to H-ZSM5, but isotopic evidence from C3Hs/C3D 8 mixtures show that C-H bond activation rate depends weakly on the presence of Ga and Zn."
          [4] "Reactions over Na-ZSM5 confirm that C-H bond activation occurs predominantly on BrOnsted acid sites."
          [5] "Ga and Zn sites increase the rate of propene formation by removing H-atoms from acid sites that activate C-H bonds, allowing acid sites to turnover without the formation of cracking products."
          [6] "Ga and Zn act as 'portholes' and catalyze the recombinative desorption of H-atoms, formed from acid-catalyzed C-H bond cleavage, as all-hydrogen (He)."
          [7] "Adsorption-desorption steps,however, remain irreversible and not fully equi- librated even on Ga/H-ZSM5 and Zn/H- ZSM5."
          [8] "This H-atom disposal step remains the rate-determining step for each sequential dehy- drogenation reaction required to convert propane to aromatics."
          [9] "The presence of Ga species allows gas phase hydrogen to dissocia- tively adsorb and to effectively compete for surface sites, thus decreasing aromatic selectiv- ity."
          [10] "The addition of 13CO2 also increases the aromatics selectivity on H-ZSM5 (Fig. 24)."
          [11] "The introduction of alternate H-disposal path- ways, whether by using stoichiometric acceptors (CO, CO 2, or 0 2) or metal cations (Ga or Zn),removes the burden of hydrogen removal from other steps that form light alkanes and reduce aromatics selectivity."
          [12] "The addition of metal cations also increases the deuterium content in 'unreacted' propane (Fig. 18)."
          [13] "The addition of Ga and Zn increase the deuterium incorporation turnovers (Fig. 19)."
          [14] "Ga and Zn species increase the rate of both H-atom recombinative desorption and of H 2 dissociative adsorption during propane dehydrocyclodimerization reactions [22,28,29,42]."

[1] "The two basic mechanisms of CH activationcarbenium activation and alkyl activationare shown in Schemes 2 and 3,respectively."
          [2] "The carbenium activation involves CH bond po- larization in such a way that the carbon atom assumes a positive partial charge (Î´+) and hydrogen assumes a negative partial charge (Î´). Carbenium activation leads to the formation of alkoxide and metal hydride (MH) as an intermediate."
          [3] "In contrast, alkyl activation (Scheme 3) involves CH polarization in such a way that the carbon develops a negative (Î´) charge and the hydrogen develops a positive (Î´+) charge. Alkyl activation leads to the formation of a metal-alkyl (MCnH2n+1) and the Brnsted acid as intermediates."
          [4] "We investigated both mecha- nisms for all of the clusters discussed so far, and we discuss the results next."
          [5] "The first step involves the opening of the GaO coordination (A + C2H6 [B] D in Scheme 2) to form the activated intermediate D."
          [6] "The intermediate D further undergoes carbenium activation,as shown in Scheme 2 (D [E] F)."
          [7] "Carbenium activation is followed by the desorption of an alkene (ethene) from the alkoxide intermediate (F [I] J K + C2H4), leaving behind the Brnsted acid site."
          [8] "The intermediate D further undergoes alkyl activation as shown in Scheme 3 (D [E] F)."
          [9] "Alkyl activation is followed by desorption of an alkene (ethene) from the Gaalkyl intermediate (F [I] J K + C2H4), leaving behind the gallium dihydride species ([GaH2]+Z m)."
          [10] "The overall carbenium activation barrier (CEa) decreases rapidly with decreasing (more exothermic) heat of reduction (H 0 red)."
          [11] "A linear Polanyi relation [47] between the overall alkyl activa- tion barrier (AEa) and the heat of reduction (H 0 red) is seen."
          [12] "Although alkyl activation is much more facile than the carbenium activation, ethene removal from [HGaC2H5]+Z m intermediate faces a very high activation bar- rier of 60 kcal/mol."
          [13] "Thus, we conclude that this intermediate will be a spectator species while dominating the surface inter- mediates."
          [14] "This conclusion agrees well with recent experimental observations [26]."
          [15] "For the 4-membered ring cluster Z4a, the overall free energy of alkyl activation (AG0 a) is lower than the carbenium acti- vation: 47.6 and 42.7 kcal/mol (Table 3) for alkyl activation,compared with 61.1 and 58.4 kcal/mol (Table 2) for carbenium activation."
          [16] "Thus, alkene desorption is a rate-limiting step for the overall alkyl activation catalytic cycle irrespec- tive of the activity of the particular catalytic site."
          [17] "Recently, Pidko et al. [42] reported a novel one-step H2 and C2H4 de- sorption pathway from gallium alkyl intermediate."
          [18] "This path- way involves a cyclic transition state with an activation bar- rier of 53.5 kcal/mol."
          [19] "We also calculated an activation bar- rier of 54.6 kcal/mol using a single-framework substitution model of the active site as described previously [33]."
          [20] "Thus, this mechanism of decomposition should set a lower limit of about 55 kcal/mol for the apparent activation barrier."
          [21] "The free energies of carbenium activation (A + C2H6 E, CG0 a) for four differ- ent reaction paths are 85.4, 81.4, 92.3, and 81.7 kcal/mol."
          [22] "The free energies of carbenium activation (CG0 a) for the two mechanistic paths (A + C2H6 E in Scheme 2) are 96.4 and 99.2 kcal/mol."

          [30] "The ethene desorption barriers are 65.5 and 66.8 kcal/mol for this particular site."
          [31] "The stability of the bicationic gallium monohydride species in the S5a ring makes alkyl activation more difficult compared with that for Z4a."
          [32] "As expected, the free energy activation bar- riers (66.4, 61.9, 66.6, and 54.7 kcal/mol) are lower than those for carbenium activation."
          [33] "The structure-insensitive ethene re- moval step faces typical free energy barriers of 56.5, 57.8, 48.8,and 63.9 kcal/mol."

          [36] "The four alkyl activation pathways for the S6b site have free energy barriers (AG0 a) of 64.7, 67.9, 69.3, and 70.2 kcal/mol, with ethene removal barriers of ca."
          [37] "62 kcal/mol."
          [38] "The Z8a ring structure provides a less stable coordina- tion for the [GaH]2+ species, with lower resulting activation barriers for CH dissociation by the alkyl activation mecha- nism."
          [39] "We calculated the free energy activation barriers to be 42.5 and 37.7 kcal/mol."
          [40] "Ethene removal barriers of 63.3 and 64.1 kcal/mol would make this the rate-limiting step."
          [41] "For the least stable site, Z8b, the alkyl activation barriers (AG0 a) are 29.0 and 27.0 kcal/mol."
          [42] "The barriers for the forma- tion of the undercoordinated GaH species are relatively higher."
          [43] "The ethene desorption barriers are 65.5 and 66.8 kcal/mol for this particular site."
          [44] "Thus, alkene desorption is a rate-limiting step for the overall alkyl activation catalytic cycle irrespec- tive of the activity of the particular catalytic site."
          [45] "The first step involves the opening of the GaO coordination (A + C2H6 [B] D in Scheme 2) to form the activated intermediate D."
          [46] "Depending on the site geom- etry, the undercoordinated GaH (intermediate D), representing the activated catalytic site, may or may not be stable."
          [47] "The ethane molecule is adsorbed on to the electron-deficient, coor- dinately unsaturated GaH species."
          [48] "As was pointed out earlier,the CH bonds of the methyl group are strongly polarized and elongated."
          [49] "In general, we have observed that for carbenium activation, the methyl group adsorbs in an end-on fashion (in- termediate D in Scheme 2)."
          [50] "In contrast to end-on adsorbed complex for carbenium activation, for alkyl activation, we observed that the methyl group adsorbs in a sidewise fashion (intermediate D in Scheme 3)."
          [51] "In this activated intermediate, only two hydro- gen atoms and the carbon of the methyl group are closer to the undercoordinated Ga."
          [52] "On the opposite side of the Ga, the third hydrogen of the methyl group is closer to the framework oxy- gen."
          [53] "This CH bond of the methyl group is strongly polarized and elongated."
          [54] "Thus, the geometry of the intermediate D for alkyl activation is conducive for the formation of the Gaalkyl species and Brnsted acid site."
          [55] "Thus, to compare different carbenium activation paths, we define an activation energy term called the overall carbenium activation barrier (CEa)."
          [56] "This activation barrier represents the upper limit of the apparent activation barrier; the actual apparent ac- tivation barrier will depend on the surface coverage and hence on the reaction conditions, which can be determined via rig- orous kinetic simulation [29]."
          [57] "We calculated the free energy change for A + C2H6 E activation (CG0 a), which allowed us to compare the reaction rate along a certain reaction path and determine the rate-controlling step."
          [58] "For all active site struc- tures, energy parameters related to carbenium activation are listed in Table 2."
          [59] "Carbenium activation is followed by the desorption of an alkene (ethene) from the alkoxide intermediate (F [I] J K + C2H4), leaving behind the Brnsted acid site."
          [60] "However, a proton jump from one bridging oxygen to other is much more facile [62] compared with the other mecha- nistic steps."
          [61] "In the discussions on the hydrogen desorption step that fol- lows, we start with the Brnsted acid site on the same bridging oxygen (intermediate K) bearing the alkoxide intermediate, to be consistent with the reduction path of the [GaH]2+Z2 d site."
          [62] "The related energy parameters (ECEa, ECG0 a, ECEr, and ECG0 r ) for ethene desorption are listed in Table 2."
          [63] "As ex- pected, the activation barrier (ECEa) is fairly constant, vary- ing around 2535 kcal/mol."
          [64] "This mechanistic step is known as a structure-insensitive reaction in the sense that the activation barrier does not depend on the distance between the pair of the framework Al."
          [65] "In any case, starting from the alkoxide interme- diate, the free energy of activation for alkene desorption is well"
          [66] "below of that for carbenium activation and thus will be incon- sequential in determining the resulting apparent free energy of activation for the dehydrogenation reaction."
          [67] "For the Z4a ring, the undercoordinated Ga species [GaH]2+ lies in the plane with OAlO, in contrast to the more tetra- hedral coordination of the Ga for the other cluster structures."
          [68] "At the same time, the 4-member ring presents an exception to the end-on adsorbed complex observed for alkyl activa- tion."
          [69] "The steric repulsion of the walls surrounding the smaller ring could be a reason for the preferred sidewise adsorption of the ethane molecule."
          [70] "The overall free energies of carbe- nium activation (CG0 a) for the two paths for Z4a site are 61.1 and 58.5 kcal/mol."
          [71] "As discussed previously, for the carbenium activation mechanism, desorption of an alkene from alkoxide intermediate is much more facile with a ECG0 a of 24.7 and 26.8 kcal/mol."
          [72] "For each of the four reduction pathways for S5a, there is a distinct carbenium activation pathway."
          [73] "The stability of the active site in the monohydride form transpires into the higher activation energy for carbenium activation."
          [74] "The free energies of carbenium activation (A + C2H6 E, CG0 a) for four differ- ent reaction paths are 85.4, 81.4, 92.3, and 81.7 kcal/mol."
          [75] "The corresponding free energy barriers for ethene removal (F I in Scheme 2) are 20.0, 34.0, 21.6, and 29.6 kcal/mol."
          [76] "Again,note that ethene removal from alkoxide is very facile compared with the carbenium activation mechanism."
          [77] "The six-membered ring S6a provides the most stable coor- dination for the [GaH]2+ species."
          [78] "Correspondingly, the highest activation barrier for the carbenium activation is observed."
          [79] "As noted previously [33], due to the higher stability of the cat- alytic site S6a in the monohydride form, the undercoordinated [GaH]2+ species (B and D) are absent along the reaction path."
          [80] "The free energies of carbenium activation (CG0 a) for the two mechanistic paths (A + C2H6 E in Scheme 2) are 96.4 and 99.2 kcal/mol, with corresponding free energies of activation for ethene removal of (ECG0 a) of 27.1 and 22.6 kcal/mol."
          [81] "For the other six-membered ring structure S6b, we studied four distinct carbenium activation paths."
          [82] "The energetics of all four reaction pathways are very similar due to symmetry of the site S6b."
          [83] "Because site S6b is less stable (H 0 red less en- dothermic in Table 1) than S6a, the activation barriers for carbe- nium activation are lower."
          [84] "Free energies of carbenium activation (CG0 a) are 87.0, 89.1, 88.2, and 94.1 kcal/mol."
          [85] "As reported in Table 2, the free energies of activation for ethene desorption are about 28 kcal/mol for all four reaction paths."
          [86] "For the 8-membered ring Z8a, 3.6 kcal/mol heat of re- duction indicates the formation of the [GaH2]+Z m is slightly exothermic."
          [87] "The lower stability of the site Z8a leads to lower free energies of the carbenium activation (62.6 and 62.0 kcal/ mol for two pathways)."
          [88] "For the other 8-membered ring Z8b, the reduction is much more exothermic with H 0 red of 19.6 and 18.6 kcal/mol."

          [95] "In our previous publication on the role of frameworkAl pair sites, we specifically focused on the carbenium activation mechanism, expecting a very high activation barrier [33,41] for alkene desorption from Gaalkyl species."
          [96] "Frash and van Santen [41] showed that for the active site involving single- frameworkAl, alkyl activation has a lower activation barrier than carbenium activation."
          [97] "A similar trend is expected for the frameworkAl pair sites."
          [98] "Similar to the carbenium activation,here the first step involves opening of the GaO coordination (A + C2H6 [B] D in Scheme 3) to form the activated intermediate D."

[1] "The authors concluded that the alkyl activation path for [HGaH]+ species is the actual path for dehydrogenation."

          [11] "The activation barrier for CH activation is directly related to the large endothermicity of the CH activation step (DE = 51.40 kcal/mol)."

[1] "Similar to the carbenium mechanism, the alkyl mechanism could be at play regardless of the specific structure of active Ga species, on which propane is initially activated by the metal cation to form the alkyl gallium intermediate, followed by the Î²-elimination and the desorption of propylene and H2."

          [2] "The modifying cations play key roles in dehydrogenation of paraffins [25,1416], whereas Brnsted acid protons catalyze the oligomerization of the olefins thus produced and possibly their subsequent aromatization."

          [10] "The probable catalytic cycle starts with the heterolytic CH bond cleavage involving exchanged univalent gallium cation and a basic oxygen atom of the zeolite framework."
          [11] "The low energy of the d-orbitals of Ga+ and its occupied s-orbital that make them unable to donate or accept electrons,respectively, from the hydrocarbon result in a high barrier for the direct oxidative addition of ethane to the cation."
          [12] "Therefore,heterolytic splitting of the CH bond is much more favorable due to the polarization induced by the interaction of the hydrocarbon with the Ga...O Lewis acidbase pair."

[1] "The results in the present paper complement our previous ones on the genesis of the reduced gallium species in Ga/HZSM5 catalysts."
          [2] "The formation of isolated Ga(I) species from binuclear oxidic gallium clusters involves the production of Lewis from Brnsted acid sites in a 1:1 basis."
          [3] "This process is accompanied by some de-alumination of the zeolite framework to produce extraframework alumina, which also helps to explain the decrease in Brnsted acidity and increase in Lewis acidity."
          [4] "When hydrogen is the reducing agent, the decomposition of the binuclear oxidic species is partially reversed when hydrogen flow is replaced by inert gas, but when the reducing agent is propane the formation of isolated Ga(I) species is irreversible, probably because it is stabilized by alkyl groups bonded to gallium, that were seen to be formed and to be stable when propane flow is replaced by inert gas."
          [5] "Dihydridogallium ions were observed after reduction in hydrogen, but were slowly decomposed when hydrogen flow was replaced by inert gas."
          [6] "This slow decomposition of the dihydridogallium ions shows that it cannot intermediate hydrogen desorption during the aromatization reaction."
          [7] "However, when hydrogen is replaced by propane, the dihydrido species appear to be rapidly replaced by alkylgallium ions."
          [8] "Under propane flow, dihydridogallium cations were never detected."

          [11] "Our results demonstrate that, while dehydrogenation reactions are inhibited by increasing hydrogen partial pressure, hydrogenolysis activities go through a maximum."

          [3] "The initial rate of propene formation is much higher on Ga/H-ZSM5 and Zn/H-ZSM5 compared to H-ZSM5, but isotopic evidence from C3Hs/C3D 8 mixtures show that C-H bond activation rate depends weakly on the presence of Ga and Zn."
          [4] "Reactions over Na-ZSM5 confirm that C-H bond activation occurs predominantly on BrOnsted acid sites."
          [5] "Ga and Zn sites increase the rate of propene formation by removing H-atoms from acid sites that activate C-H bonds, allowing acid sites to turnover without the formation of cracking products."

[1] "The two basic mechanisms of CH activationcarbenium activation and alkyl activationare shown in Schemes 2 and 3,respectively."
          [2] "The carbenium activation involves CH bond po- larization in such a way that the carbon atom assumes a positive partial charge (Î´+) and hydrogen assumes a negative partial charge (Î´). Carbenium activation leads to the formation of alkoxide and metal hydride (MH) as an intermediate."
          [3] "In contrast, alkyl activation (Scheme 3) involves CH polarization in such a way that the carbon develops a negative (Î´) charge and the hydrogen develops a positive (Î´+) charge. Alkyl activation leads to the formation of a metal-alkyl (MCnH2n+1) and the Brnsted acid as intermediates."
          [4] "We investigated both mecha- nisms for all of the clusters discussed so far, and we discuss the results next."
          [5] "The first step involves the opening of the GaO coordination (A + C2H6 [B] D in Scheme 2) to form the activated intermediate D."
          [6] "The intermediate D further undergoes carbenium activation,as shown in Scheme 2 (D [E] F)."
          [7] "Carbenium activation is followed by the desorption of an alkene (ethene) from the alkoxide intermediate (F [I] J K + C2H4), leaving behind the Brnsted acid site."

          [12] "Although alkyl activation is much more facile than the carbenium activation, ethene removal from [HGaC2H5]+Z m intermediate faces a very high activation bar- rier of 60 kcal/mol."
          [13] "Thus, we conclude that this intermediate will be a spectator species while dominating the surface inter- mediates."
          [14] "This conclusion agrees well with recent experimental observations [26]."
          [15] "For the 4-membered ring cluster Z4a, the overall free energy of alkyl activation (AG0 a) is lower than the carbenium acti- vation: 47.6 and 42.7 kcal/mol (Table 3) for alkyl activation,compared with 61.1 and 58.4 kcal/mol (Table 2) for carbenium activation."
          [16] "Thus, alkene desorption is a rate-limiting step for the overall alkyl activation catalytic cycle irrespec- tive of the activity of the particular catalytic site."

          [42] "The barriers for the forma- tion of the undercoordinated GaH species are relatively higher."
          [43] "The ethene desorption barriers are 65.5 and 66.8 kcal/mol for this particular site."

          [48] "As was pointed out earlier,the CH bonds of the methyl group are strongly polarized and elongated."
          [49] "In general, we have observed that for carbenium activation, the methyl group adsorbs in an end-on fashion (in- termediate D in Scheme 2)."
          [50] "In contrast to end-on adsorbed complex for carbenium activation, for alkyl activation, we observed that the methyl group adsorbs in a sidewise fashion (intermediate D in Scheme 3)."

          [53] "This CH bond of the methyl group is strongly polarized and elongated."
          [54] "Thus, the geometry of the intermediate D for alkyl activation is conducive for the formation of the Gaalkyl species and Brnsted acid site."
          [55] "Thus, to compare different carbenium activation paths, we define an activation energy term called the overall carbenium activation barrier (CEa)."
          [56] "This activation barrier represents the upper limit of the apparent activation barrier; the actual apparent ac- tivation barrier will depend on the surface coverage and hence on the reaction conditions, which can be determined via rig- orous kinetic simulation [29]."
          [57] "We calculated the free energy change for A + C2H6 E activation (CG0 a), which allowed us to compare the reaction rate along a certain reaction path and determine the rate-controlling step."

          [64] "This mechanistic step is known as a structure-insensitive reaction in the sense that the activation barrier does not depend on the distance between the pair of the framework Al."
          [65] "In any case, starting from the alkoxide interme- diate, the free energy of activation for alkene desorption is well"
          [66] "below of that for carbenium activation and thus will be incon- sequential in determining the resulting apparent free energy of activation for the dehydrogenation reaction."
          [67] "For the Z4a ring, the undercoordinated Ga species [GaH]2+ lies in the plane with OAlO, in contrast to the more tetra- hedral coordination of the Ga for the other cluster structures."
          [68] "At the same time, the 4-member ring presents an exception to the end-on adsorbed complex observed for alkyl activa- tion."
          [69] "The steric repulsion of the walls surrounding the smaller ring could be a reason for the preferred sidewise adsorption of the ethane molecule."
          [70] "The overall free energies of carbe- nium activation (CG0 a) for the two paths for Z4a site are 61.1 and 58.5 kcal/mol."
          [71] "As discussed previously, for the carbenium activation mechanism, desorption of an alkene from alkoxide intermediate is much more facile with a ECG0 a of 24.7 and 26.8 kcal/mol."
          [72] "For each of the four reduction pathways for S5a, there is a distinct carbenium activation pathway."
          [73] "The stability of the active site in the monohydride form transpires into the higher activation energy for carbenium activation."
          [74] "The free energies of carbenium activation (A + C2H6 E, CG0 a) for four differ- ent reaction paths are 85.4, 81.4, 92.3, and 81.7 kcal/mol."
          [75] "The corresponding free energy barriers for ethene removal (F I in Scheme 2) are 20.0, 34.0, 21.6, and 29.6 kcal/mol."
          [76] "Again,note that ethene removal from alkoxide is very facile compared with the carbenium activation mechanism."
          [77] "The six-membered ring S6a provides the most stable coor- dination for the [GaH]2+ species."
          [78] "Correspondingly, the highest activation barrier for the carbenium activation is observed."
          [79] "As noted previously [33], due to the higher stability of the cat- alytic site S6a in the monohydride form, the undercoordinated [GaH]2+ species (B and D) are absent along the reaction path."
          [80] "The free energies of carbenium activation (CG0 a) for the two mechanistic paths (A + C2H6 E in Scheme 2) are 96.4 and 99.2 kcal/mol, with corresponding free energies of activation for ethene removal of (ECG0 a) of 27.1 and 22.6 kcal/mol."
          [81] "For the other six-membered ring structure S6b, we studied four distinct carbenium activation paths."
          [82] "The energetics of all four reaction pathways are very similar due to symmetry of the site S6b."
          [83] "Because site S6b is less stable (H 0 red less en- dothermic in Table 1) than S6a, the activation barriers for carbe- nium activation are lower."
          [84] "Free energies of carbenium activation (CG0 a) are 87.0, 89.1, 88.2, and 94.1 kcal/mol."
          [85] "As reported in Table 2, the free energies of activation for ethene desorption are about 28 kcal/mol for all four reaction paths."
          [86] "For the 8-membered ring Z8a, 3.6 kcal/mol heat of re- duction indicates the formation of the [GaH2]+Z m is slightly exothermic."
          [87] "The lower stability of the site Z8a leads to lower free energies of the carbenium activation (62.6 and 62.0 kcal/ mol for two pathways)."
          [88] "For the other 8-membered ring Z8b, the reduction is much more exothermic with H 0 red of 19.6 and 18.6 kcal/mol."

          [95] "In our previous publication on the role of frameworkAl pair sites, we specifically focused on the carbenium activation mechanism, expecting a very high activation barrier [33,41] for alkene desorption from Gaalkyl species."
          [96] "Frash and van Santen [41] showed that for the active site involving single- frameworkAl, alkyl activation has a lower activation barrier than carbenium activation."
          [97] "A similar trend is expected for the frameworkAl pair sites."
          [98] "Similar to the carbenium activation,here the first step involves opening of the GaO coordination (A + C2H6 [B] D in Scheme 3) to form the activated intermediate D."
          [99] "In contrast to end-on adsorbed complex for carbenium activation, for alkyl activation, we observed that the methyl group adsorbs in a sidewise fashion (intermediate D in Scheme 3)."
          [100] "In this activated intermediate, only two hydro- gen atoms and the carbon of the methyl group are closer to the undercoordinated Ga."
          [101] "On the opposite side of the Ga, the third hydrogen of the methyl group is closer to the framework oxy- gen."
          [102] "This CH bond of the methyl group is strongly polarized and elongated."
          [103] "Thus, the geometry of the intermediate D for alkyl activation is conducive for the formation of the Gaalkyl species and Brnsted acid site."
          [104] "Thus, to compare different alkyl activation paths,we have defined an activation energy term called the overall alkyl activation barrier (AEa), representing the energy differ- ence between E and A + C2H6."
          [105] "This activation barrier is the approximate apparent activation barrier, because we have ne- glected the possible presence of the intermediates B and D for our analysis."
          [106] "We calculated the corresponding free energy change (AG0 a) for A + C2H6 E transformation and in Ta- ble 3 report the energy terms for all of the alkyl activation paths:alkyl activation energy (AEa), standard free energies of acti- vation (AG0 a at 25 C and 1 atm), reaction energy (AEr),and free energy change for alkyl activation (AG0 r )."
          [107] "Alkyl activation is followed by desorption of an alkene (ethene) from the Gaalkyl intermediate (F [I] J K + C2H4), leaving behind the gallium dihydride species ([GaH2]+Z m)."
          [108] "Relaxation of the transition state I toward prod- uct leads to the formation of the intermediate J with ethene adsorbed (Ï-bonded) on the [GaH2]+Z m."
          [109] "Intermediate J indi- cates that the tetrahedral Ga species is coordinated with only one framework oxygen (monodentate)."
          [110] "After the desorption of ethene, the [GaH2]+ species should relax to the more stable bidentate coordination (species K), as shown in Scheme 3."
          [111] "Various energy terms for ethene desorption (EAEa, EAG0 a, EAEr and EAG0 r ) are reported in Table 3."
          [112] "Desorption of ethene from Gaalkyl species has been well studied [33,41], and a very high activation barrier of about 60 kcal/mol has been reported."
          [113] "Because desorption is associated with the Ga species adjacent to a single-framework Al, the activation barrier is expected to be independent (structure insensitive) of the dis- tance between the framework Alpair."
          [114] "In the reminder of this section, we discuss the details of the alkyl activation mecha- nism for each catalytic site."
          [115] "For the 4-membered ring cluster Z4a, the overall free energy of alkyl activation (AG0 a) is lower than the carbenium acti- vation: 47.6 and 42.7 kcal/mol (Table 3) for alkyl activation,compared with 61.1 and 58.4 kcal/mol (Table 2) for carbenium activation."
          [116] "The free energies of activation for ethene removal are 62.0 and 64.4 kcal/mol, respectively."
          [117] "The stability of the bicationic gallium monohydride species in the S5a ring makes alkyl activation more difficult compared with that for Z4a."
          [118] "As expected, the free energy activation bar- riers (66.4, 61.9, 66.6, and 54.7 kcal/mol) are lower than those for carbenium activation."
          [119] "The structure-insensitive ethene re- moval step faces typical free energy barriers of 56.5, 57.8, 48.8,and 63.9 kcal/mol."
          [120] "The S6a structure has large free energy barriers (AG0 a) of 69.6 and 73.8 kcal/mol, with ethene removal barriers of ca."

          [122] "The four alkyl activation pathways for the S6b site have free energy barriers (AG0 a) of 64.7, 67.9, 69.3, and 70.2 kcal/mol, with ethene removal barriers of ca."

          [124] "The Z8a ring structure provides a less stable coordina- tion for the [GaH]2+ species, with lower resulting activation barriers for CH dissociation by the alkyl activation mecha- nism."
          [125] "We calculated the free energy activation barriers to be 42.5 and 37.7 kcal/mol."
          [126] "Ethene removal barriers of 63.3 and 64.1 kcal/mol would make this the rate-limiting step."
          [127] "For the least stable site, Z8b, the alkyl activation barriers (AG0 a) are 29.0 and 27.0 kcal/mol."
          [128] "The barriers for the forma- tion of the undercoordinated GaH species are relatively higher."
          [129] "The ethene desorption barriers are 65.5 and 66.8 kcal/mol for this particular site."
          [130] "Thus, alkene desorption is a rate-limiting step for the overall alkyl activation catalytic cycle irrespec- tive of the activity of the particular catalytic site."

          [134] "We also calculated an activation bar- rier of 54.6 kcal/mol using a single-framework substitution model of the active site as described previously [33]."
          [135] "Thus, this mechanism of decomposition should set a lower limit of about 55 kcal/mol for the apparent activation barrier."
          [136] "We repeated the calculation of this cyclic transition state for all the pair site models; the resulting activation energies (EDEa) are reported in Table 3."
          [137] "The constant values of EDEa suggest that this decomposition mechanism is a structure- insensitive reaction."

[1] "The authors concluded that the alkyl activation path for [HGaH]+ species is the actual path for dehydrogenation."
          [2] "However, this conclusion was based on the observation that at higher temperatures, the initial CH activation step becomes the rate-determining step, and the calculated activation barrier (3940 kcal/mol) for this first step is in close agreement with the experimentally estimated value of 39 kcal/mol [20]."
          [3] "We find that the activation energy for initial CH activation is substantially higher (48.66 kcal/mol) compared to their previously calculated [37] value of 37.9 kcal/mol."

          [5] "The activation barrier for the alkyl desorption (process X ! TS4 in Fig. 3) was 61.67 kcal/mol, which is in close agreement with the previously reported [37] value of 60.7 kcal/mol."
          [6] "This high activationbarrierfor thealkylremovalstepshouldleadtovery low intrinsic reaction rate for the alkyl activation mechanism."
          [7] "We conclude from the previous literature, and from our extension here, that the single site, [HGaH]+, model does not represent the true mechanism for Ga-assisted dehydrogenation."
          [8] "We find the energy barrier for CH activation is 85.72 kcal/mol, corresponding to the initial alkane adsorption and hydrogen removal."
          [9] "The activation barrier for this step (process V + C2H6 ! TS11 in Fig. 7) is very high considering the other reaction paths we have presented so far."
          [10] "The activation barrier for hydrogen removal is substantially smaller than that for CH activation."
          [11] "The activation barrier for CH activation is directly related to the large endothermicity of the CH activation step (DE = 51.40 kcal/mol)."

[1] "Similar to the carbenium mechanism, the alkyl mechanism could be at play regardless of the specific structure of active Ga species, on which propane is initially activated by the metal cation to form the alkyl gallium intermediate, followed by the Î²-elimination and the desorption of propylene and H2."

          [2] "The modifying cations play key roles in dehydrogenation of paraffins [25,1416], whereas Brnsted acid protons catalyze the oligomerization of the olefins thus produced and possibly their subsequent aromatization."
          [3] "The initial step of CH activation is the oxidative addition of an alkane molecule to the Ga+ cation, which proceeds via an indirect heterolytic mechanism involving the basic oxygen atoms of the zeolite lattice."

          [6] "The mechanism of the initial activation of the hydrocarbon molecule on dihydrido-gallyl ion is very similar to that suggested for the heterolytic dissociation of ethane on Ga Zd."
          [7] "The calculated activation energy for this elementary step (193 kJ/mol) is significantly higher than that (158 kJ/mol) reported previously [17] for GaH2+ species stabilized in a fully optimized 3T cluster."
          [8] "The activation energy for this process was 257 kJ/mol, in an excellent agreement with the previously reported values of 258 kJ/mol [22] and 254 kJ/mol [17]."

          [11] "The low energy of the d-orbitals of Ga+ and its occupied s-orbital that make them unable to donate or accept electrons,respectively, from the hydrocarbon result in a high barrier for the direct oxidative addition of ethane to the cation."
          [12] "Therefore,heterolytic splitting of the CH bond is much more favorable due to the polarization induced by the interaction of the hydrocarbon with the Ga...O Lewis acidbase pair."
          [13] "The resulting product easily rearranges to form [HGaC2H5]+, which decomposes via simultaneous desorption of H2 and C2H4, regenerating the initial Ga+ species."

          [18] "Bivalent GaH+2 species stabilized at the cation site with distantly separated framework Al sites exhibit significantly higher initial activity for ethane activation but much lower stability compared with Ga+ sites."

          [20] "On the other hand, GaH+2 ions charge-compensating two proximate framework aluminum ions are the most stable cationic species; however, initial activation of the CH bond over these sites is strongly disfavored both thermodynamically and kinetically."

[1] "The results in the present paper complement our previous ones on the genesis of the reduced gallium species in Ga/HZSM5 catalysts."
          [2] "The formation of isolated Ga(I) species from binuclear oxidic gallium clusters involves the production of Lewis from Brnsted acid sites in a 1:1 basis."
          [3] "This process is accompanied by some de-alumination of the zeolite framework to produce extraframework alumina, which also helps to explain the decrease in Brnsted acidity and increase in Lewis acidity."
          [4] "When hydrogen is the reducing agent, the decomposition of the binuclear oxidic species is partially reversed when hydrogen flow is replaced by inert gas, but when the reducing agent is propane the formation of isolated Ga(I) species is irreversible, probably because it is stabilized by alkyl groups bonded to gallium, that were seen to be formed and to be stable when propane flow is replaced by inert gas."

          [8] "Under propane flow, dihydridogallium cations were never detected."

          [28] "A sequence of steps that corresponds essentially to reaction (19) has been analyzed by Frash and van Santen [24] in their theoreti- cal study of ethane activation on gallium-exchanged zeolites,with dihydridogallium ions as the active sites."
          [29] "In their scheme,the alkyl- hydridogallium species in reaction (19) decomposes to produce an alkene molecule and regenerate the dihydrido active site."
          [30] "Our results suggest that the decomposition of the alkylhydrido inter- mediate occurs by reactions (17) and (18) instead."

[1] "The beneficial effect of Ga on alkane aromatization rates and selectivity has been observed whether Ga ions are introduced by impregnation [16,26,28,29,33,35] or ion exchange techniques [15,18,22,23,32]."
          [2] "The addition of metal species to H-ZSM5 channels increase aromatic turnover rates and actually decrease cracking turnover rates (Fig. 3)."
          [3] "The initial rate of propene formation is much higher on Ga/H-ZSM5 and Zn/H-ZSM5 compared to H-ZSM5, but isotopic evidence from C3Hs/C3D 8 mixtures show that C-H bond activation rate depends weakly on the presence of Ga and Zn."
          [4] "Reactions over Na-ZSM5 confirm that C-H bond activation occurs predominantly on BrOnsted acid sites."
          [5] "Ga and Zn sites increase the rate of propene formation by removing H-atoms from acid sites that activate C-H bonds, allowing acid sites to turnover without the formation of cracking products."
          [6] "Ga and Zn act as 'portholes' and catalyze the recombinative desorption of H-atoms, formed from acid-catalyzed C-H bond cleavage, as all-hydrogen (He)."
          [7] "Adsorption-desorption steps,however, remain irreversible and not fully equi- librated even on Ga/H-ZSM5 and Zn/H- ZSM5."
          [8] "This H-atom disposal step remains the rate-determining step for each sequential dehy- drogenation reaction required to convert propane to aromatics."
          [9] "The presence of Ga species allows gas phase hydrogen to dissocia- tively adsorb and to effectively compete for surface sites, thus decreasing aromatic selectiv- ity."
          [10] "The addition of 13CO2 also increases the aromatics selectivity on H-ZSM5 (Fig. 24)."
          [11] "The introduction of alternate H-disposal path- ways, whether by using stoichiometric acceptors (CO, CO 2, or 0 2) or metal cations (Ga or Zn),removes the burden of hydrogen removal from other steps that form light alkanes and reduce aromatics selectivity."
          [12] "The addition of metal cations also increases the deuterium content in 'unreacted' propane (Fig. 18)."
          [13] "The addition of Ga and Zn increase the deuterium incorporation turnovers (Fig. 19)."
          [14] "Ga and Zn species increase the rate of both H-atom recombinative desorption and of H 2 dissociative adsorption during propane dehydrocyclodimerization reactions [22,28,29,42]."

[1] "The two basic mechanisms of CH activationcarbenium activation and alkyl activationare shown in Schemes 2 and 3,respectively."
          [2] "The carbenium activation involves CH bond po- larization in such a way that the carbon atom assumes a positive partial charge (Î´+) and hydrogen assumes a negative partial charge (Î´). Carbenium activation leads to the formation of alkoxide and metal hydride (MH) as an intermediate."
          [3] "In contrast, alkyl activation (Scheme 3) involves CH polarization in such a way that the carbon develops a negative (Î´) charge and the hydrogen develops a positive (Î´+) charge. Alkyl activation leads to the formation of a metal-alkyl (MCnH2n+1) and the Brnsted acid as intermediates."
          [4] "We investigated both mecha- nisms for all of the clusters discussed so far, and we discuss the results next."
          [5] "The first step involves the opening of the GaO coordination (A + C2H6 [B] D in Scheme 2) to form the activated intermediate D."
          [6] "The intermediate D further undergoes carbenium activation,as shown in Scheme 2 (D [E] F)."
          [7] "Carbenium activation is followed by the desorption of an alkene (ethene) from the alkoxide intermediate (F [I] J K + C2H4), leaving behind the Brnsted acid site."
          [8] "The intermediate D further undergoes alkyl activation as shown in Scheme 3 (D [E] F)."
          [9] "Alkyl activation is followed by desorption of an alkene (ethene) from the Gaalkyl intermediate (F [I] J K + C2H4), leaving behind the gallium dihydride species ([GaH2]+Z m)."
          [10] "The overall carbenium activation barrier (CEa) decreases rapidly with decreasing (more exothermic) heat of reduction (H 0 red)."
          [11] "A linear Polanyi relation [47] between the overall alkyl activa- tion barrier (AEa) and the heat of reduction (H 0 red) is seen."
          [12] "Although alkyl activation is much more facile than the carbenium activation, ethene removal from [HGaC2H5]+Z m intermediate faces a very high activation bar- rier of 60 kcal/mol."
          [13] "Thus, we conclude that this intermediate will be a spectator species while dominating the surface inter- mediates."
          [14] "This conclusion agrees well with recent experimental observations [26]."
          [15] "For the 4-membered ring cluster Z4a, the overall free energy of alkyl activation (AG0 a) is lower than the carbenium acti- vation: 47.6 and 42.7 kcal/mol (Table 3) for alkyl activation,compared with 61.1 and 58.4 kcal/mol (Table 2) for carbenium activation."
          [16] "Thus, alkene desorption is a rate-limiting step for the overall alkyl activation catalytic cycle irrespec- tive of the activity of the particular catalytic site."
          [17] "Recently, Pidko et al. [42] reported a novel one-step H2 and C2H4 de- sorption pathway from gallium alkyl intermediate."
          [18] "This path- way involves a cyclic transition state with an activation bar- rier of 53.5 kcal/mol."
          [19] "We also calculated an activation bar- rier of 54.6 kcal/mol using a single-framework substitution model of the active site as described previously [33]."
          [20] "Thus, this mechanism of decomposition should set a lower limit of about 55 kcal/mol for the apparent activation barrier."
          [21] "The free energies of carbenium activation (A + C2H6 E, CG0 a) for four differ- ent reaction paths are 85.4, 81.4, 92.3, and 81.7 kcal/mol."
          [22] "The free energies of carbenium activation (CG0 a) for the two mechanistic paths (A + C2H6 E in Scheme 2) are 96.4 and 99.2 kcal/mol."
          [23] "The free energies of carbenium activation (CG0 a) for the two pathways are 61.1 and 58.4 kcal/mol."
          [24] "The free energy activation barriers (66.4, 61.9, 66.6, and 54.7 kcal/mol) are lower than those for carbenium activation."
          [25] "The free energy barriers (AG0 a) of 69.6 and 73.8 kcal/mol, with ethene removal barriers of 60.5 and 54.7 kcal/mol."
          [26] "The free energy barriers (AG0 a) are 64.7, 67.9, 69.3, and 70.2 kcal/mol, with ethene removal barriers of ca. 62 kcal/mol."

          [28] "The alkyl activation barriers (AG0 a) are 29.0 and 27.0 kcal/mol."
          [29] "The barriers for the forma- tion of the undercoordinated GaH species are relatively higher."
          [30] "The ethene desorption barriers are 65.5 and 66.8 kcal/mol for this particular site."
          [31] "The stability of the bicationic gallium monohydride species in the S5a ring makes alkyl activation more difficult compared with that for Z4a."
          [32] "As expected, the free energy activation bar- riers (66.4, 61.9, 66.6, and 54.7 kcal/mol) are lower than those for carbenium activation."
          [33] "The structure-insensitive ethene re- moval step faces typical free energy barriers of 56.5, 57.8, 48.8,and 63.9 kcal/mol."
          [34] "The S6a structure has large free energy barriers (AG0 a) of 69.6 and 73.8 kcal/mol, with ethene removal barriers of ca."
          [35] "60.5 and 54.7 kcal/mol."
          [36] "The four alkyl activation pathways for the S6b site have free energy barriers (AG0 a) of 64.7, 67.9, 69.3, and 70.2 kcal/mol, with ethene removal barriers of ca."
          [37] "62 kcal/mol."
          [38] "The Z8a ring structure provides a less stable coordina- tion for the [GaH]2+ species, with lower resulting activation barriers for CH dissociation by the alkyl activation mecha- nism."
          [39] "We calculated the free energy activation barriers to be 42.5 and 37.7 kcal/mol."
          [40] "Ethene removal barriers of 63.3 and 64.1 kcal/mol would make this the rate-limiting step."
          [41] "For the least stable site, Z8b, the alkyl activation barriers (AG0 a) are 29.0 and 27.0 kcal/mol."
          [42] "The barriers for the forma- tion of the undercoordinated GaH species are relatively higher."
          [43] "The ethene desorption barriers are 65.5 and 66.8 kcal/mol for this particular site."
          [44] "Thus, alkene desorption is a rate-limiting step for the overall alkyl activation catalytic cycle irrespec- tive of the activity of the particular catalytic site."
          [45] "The first step involves the opening of the GaO coordination (A + C2H6 [B] D in Scheme 2) to form the activated intermediate D."
          [46] "Depending on the site geom- etry, the undercoordinated GaH (intermediate D), representing the activated catalytic site, may or may not be stable."
          [47] "The ethane molecule is adsorbed on to the electron-deficient, coor- dinately unsaturated GaH species."
          [48] "As was pointed out earlier,the CH bonds of the methyl group are strongly polarized and elongated."
          [49] "In general, we have observed that for carbenium activation, the methyl group adsorbs in an end-on fashion (in- termediate D in Scheme 2)."
          [50] "In contrast to end-on adsorbed complex for carbenium activation, for alkyl activation, we observed that the methyl group adsorbs in a sidewise fashion (intermediate D in Scheme 3)."
          [51] "In this activated intermediate, only two hydro- gen atoms and the carbon of the methyl group are closer to the undercoordinated Ga."
          [52] "On the opposite side of the Ga, the third hydrogen of the methyl group is closer to the framework oxy- gen."
          [53] "This CH bond of the methyl group is strongly polarized and elongated."
          [54] "Thus, the geometry of the intermediate D for alkyl activation is conducive for the formation of the Gaalkyl species and Brnsted acid site."
          [55] "Thus, to compare different carbenium activation paths, we define an activation energy term called the overall carbenium activation barrier (CEa)."
          [56] "This activation barrier represents the upper limit of the apparent activation barrier; the actual apparent ac- tivation barrier will depend on the surface coverage and hence on the reaction conditions, which can be determined via rig- orous kinetic simulation [29]."
          [57] "We calculated the free energy change for A + C2H6 E activation (CG0 a), which allowed us to compare the reaction rate along a certain reaction path and determine the rate-controlling step."
          [58] "For all active site struc- tures, energy parameters related to carbenium activation are listed in Table 2."
          [59] "Carbenium activation is followed by the desorption of an alkene (ethene) from the alkoxide intermediate (F [I] J K + C2H4), leaving behind the Brnsted acid site."
          [60] "However, a proton jump from one bridging oxygen to other is much more facile [62] compared with the other mecha- nistic steps."
          [61] "In the discussions on the hydrogen desorption step that fol- lows, we start with the Brnsted acid site on the same bridging oxygen (intermediate K) bearing the alkoxide intermediate, to be consistent with the reduction path of the [GaH]2+Z2 d site."
          [62] "The related energy parameters (ECEa, ECG0 a, ECEr, and ECG0 r ) for ethene desorption are listed in Table 2."
          [63] "As ex- pected, the activation barrier (ECEa) is fairly constant, vary- ing around 2535 kcal/mol."
          [64] "This mechanistic step is known as a structure-insensitive reaction in the sense that the activation barrier does not depend on the distance between the pair of the framework Al."
          [65] "In any case, starting from the alkoxide interme- diate, the free energy of activation for alkene desorption is well"
          [66] "below of that for carbenium activation and thus will be incon- sequential in determining the resulting apparent free energy of activation for the dehydrogenation reaction."
          [67] "For the Z4a ring, the undercoordinated Ga species [GaH]2+ lies in the plane with OAlO, in contrast to the more tetra- hedral coordination of the Ga for the other cluster structures."
          [68] "At the same time, the 4-member ring presents an exception to the end-on adsorbed complex observed for alkyl activa- tion."
          [69] "The steric repulsion of the walls surrounding the smaller ring could be a reason for the preferred sidewise adsorption of the ethane molecule."
          [70] "The overall free energies of carbe- nium activation (CG0 a) for the two paths for Z4a site are 61.1 and 58.5 kcal/mol."
          [71] "As discussed previously, for the carbenium activation mechanism, desorption of an alkene from alkoxide intermediate is much more facile with a ECG0 a of 24.7 and 26.8 kcal/mol."
          [72] "For each of the four reduction pathways for S5a, there is a distinct carbenium activation pathway."
          [73] "The stability of the active site in the monohydride form transpires into the higher activation energy for carbenium activation."
          [74] "The free energies of carbenium activation (A + C2H6 E, CG0 a) for four differ- ent reaction paths are 85.4, 81.4, 92.3, and 81.7 kcal/mol."
          [75] "The corresponding free energy barriers for ethene removal (F I in Scheme 2) are 20.0, 34.0, 21.6, and 29.6 kcal/mol."
          [76] "Again,note that ethene removal from alkoxide is very facile compared with the carbenium activation mechanism."
          [77] "The six-membered ring S6a provides the most stable coor- dination for the [GaH]2+ species."
          [78] "Correspondingly, the highest activation barrier for the carbenium activation is observed."
          [79] "As noted previously [33], due to the higher stability of the cat- alytic site S6a in the monohydride form, the undercoordinated [GaH]2+ species (B and D) are absent along the reaction path."
          [80] "The free energies of carbenium activation (CG0 a) for the two mechanistic paths (A + C2H6 E in Scheme 2) are 96.4 and 99.2 kcal/mol, with corresponding free energies of activation for ethene removal of (ECG0 a) of 27.1 and 22.6 kcal/mol."
          [81] "For the other six-membered ring structure S6b, we studied four distinct carbenium activation paths."
          [82] "The energetics of all four reaction pathways are very similar due to symmetry of the site S6b."
          [83] "Because site S6b is less stable (H 0 red less en- dothermic in Table 1) than S6a, the activation barriers for carbe- nium activation are lower."
          [84] "Free energies of carbenium activation (CG0 a) are 87.0, 89.1, 88.2, and 94.1 kcal/mol."
          [85] "As reported in Table 2, the free energies of activation for ethene desorption are about 28 kcal/mol for all four reaction paths."
          [86] "For the 8-membered ring Z8a, 3.6 kcal/mol heat of re- duction indicates the formation of the [GaH2]+Z m is slightly exothermic."
          [87] "The lower stability of the site Z8a leads to lower free energies of the carbenium activation (62.6 and 62.0 kcal/ mol for two pathways)."
          [88] "For the other 8-membered ring Z8b, the reduction is much more exothermic with H 0 red of 19.6 and 18.6 kcal/mol."
          [89] "The least stable site shows the lowest free en- ergy of carbenium activation (CG0 a), 47.7 and 49.2 kcal/mol."

          [93] "Scheme 3 shows a generalized catalytic cycle for dehydro- genation starting with alkyl activation, including all possible intermediates along any alkyl activation path."
          [94] "Not all of these intermediates may be present for a particular catalytic site, how- ever."
          [95] "In our previous publication on the role of frameworkAl pair sites, we specifically focused on the carbenium activation mechanism, expecting a very high activation barrier [33,41] for alkene desorption from Gaalkyl species."
          [96] "Frash and van Santen [41] showed that for the active site involving single- frameworkAl, alkyl activation has a lower activation barrier than carbenium activation."
          [97] "A similar trend is expected for the frameworkAl pair sites."
          [98] "Similar to the carbenium activation,here the first step involves opening of the GaO coordination (A + C2H6 [B] D in Scheme 3) to form the activated intermediate D."
          [99] "In contrast to end-on adsorbed complex for carbenium activation, for alkyl activation, we observed that the methyl group adsorbs in a sidewise fashion (intermediate D in Scheme 3)."

          [104] "Thus, to compare different alkyl activation paths,we have defined an activation energy term called the overall alkyl activation barrier (AEa), representing the energy differ- ence between E and A + C2H6."
          [105] "This activation barrier is the approximate apparent activation barrier, because we have ne- glected the possible presence of the intermediates B and D for our analysis."
          [106] "We calculated the corresponding free energy change (AG0 a) for A + C2H6 E transformation and in Ta- ble 3 report the energy terms for all of the alkyl activation paths:alkyl activation energy (AEa), standard free energies of acti- vation (AG0 a at 25 C and 1 atm), reaction energy (AEr),and free energy change for alkyl activation (AG0 r )."
          [107] "Alkyl activation is followed by desorption of an alkene (ethene) from the Gaalkyl intermediate (F [I] J K + C2H4), leaving behind the gallium dihydride species ([GaH2]+Z m)."

          [109] "Intermediate J indi- cates that the tetrahedral Ga species is coordinated with only one framework oxygen (monodentate)."
          [110] "After the desorption of ethene, the [GaH2]+ species should relax to the more stable bidentate coordination (species K), as shown in Scheme 3."
          [111] "Various energy terms for ethene desorption (EAEa, EAG0 a, EAEr and EAG0 r ) are reported in Table 3."
          [112] "Desorption of ethene from Gaalkyl species has been well studied [33,41], and a very high activation barrier of about 60 kcal/mol has been reported."
          [113] "Because desorption is associated with the Ga species adjacent to a single-framework Al, the activation barrier is expected to be independent (structure insensitive) of the dis- tance between the framework Alpair."

          [137] "The constant values of EDEa suggest that this decomposition mechanism is a structure- insensitive reaction."

[1] "The authors concluded that the alkyl activation path for [HGaH]+ species is the actual path for dehydrogenation."
          [2] "However, this conclusion was based on the observation that at higher temperatures, the initial CH activation step becomes the rate-determining step, and the calculated activation barrier (3940 kcal/mol) for this first step is in close agreement with the experimentally estimated value of 39 kcal/mol [20]."
          [3] "We find that the activation energy for initial CH activation is substantially higher (48.66 kcal/mol) compared to their previously calculated [37] value of 37.9 kcal/mol."

          [2] "The modifying cations play key roles in dehydrogenation of paraffins [25,1416], whereas Brnsted acid protons catalyze the oligomerization of the olefins thus produced and possibly their subsequent aromatization."

          [11] "The low energy of the d-orbitals of Ga+ and its occupied s-orbital that make them unable to donate or accept electrons,respectively, from the hydrocarbon result in a high barrier for the direct oxidative addition of ethane to the cation."

          [3] "This process is accompanied by some de-alumination of the zeolite framework to produce extraframework alumina, which also helps to explain the decrease in Brnsted acidity and increase in Lewis acidity."
          [4] "When hydrogen is the reducing agent, the decomposition of the binuclear oxidic species is partially reversed when hydrogen flow is replaced by inert gas, but when the reducing agent is propane the formation of isolated Ga(I) species is irreversible, probably because it is stabilized by alkyl groups bonded to gallium, that were seen to be formed and to be stable when propane flow is replaced by inert gas."
          [5] "Dihydridogallium ions were observed after reduction in hydrogen, but were slowly decomposed when hydrogen flow was replaced by inert gas."
          [6] "This slow decomposition of the dihydridogallium ions shows that it cannot intermediate hydrogen desorption during the aromatization reaction."

          [8] "Under propane flow, dihydridogallium cations were never detected."

          [3] "The initial rate of propene formation is much higher on Ga/H-ZSM5 and Zn/H-ZSM5 compared to H-ZSM5, but isotopic evidence from C3Hs/C3D 8 mixtures show that C-H bond activation rate depends weakly on the presence of Ga and Zn."
          [4] "Reactions over Na-ZSM5 confirm that C-H bond activation occurs predominantly on BrOnsted acid sites."

[1] "The two basic mechanisms of CH activationcarbenium activation and alkyl activationare shown in Schemes 2 and 3,respectively."
          [2] "The carbenium activation involves CH bond po- larization in such a way that the carbon atom assumes a positive partial charge (Î´+) and hydrogen assumes a negative partial charge (Î´). Carbenium activation leads to the formation of alkoxide and metal hydride (MH) as an intermediate."
          [3] "In contrast, alkyl activation (Scheme 3) involves CH polarization in such a way that the carbon develops a negative (Î´) charge and the hydrogen develops a positive (Î´+) charge. Alkyl activation leads to the formation of a metal-alkyl (MCnH2n+1) and the Brnsted acid as intermediates."
          [4] "We investigated both mecha- nisms for all of the clusters discussed so far, and we discuss the results next."
          [5] "The first step involves the opening of the GaO coordination (A + C2H6 [B] D in Scheme 2) to form the activated intermediate D."
          [6] "The intermediate D further undergoes carbenium activation,as shown in Scheme 2 (D [E] F)."
          [7] "Carbenium activation is followed by the desorption of an alkene (ethene) from the alkoxide intermediate (F [I] J K + C2H4), leaving behind the Brnsted acid site."

          [12] "Although alkyl activation is much more facile than the carbenium activation, ethene removal from [HGaC2H5]+Z m intermediate faces a very high activation bar- rier of 60 kcal/mol."
          [13] "Thus, we conclude that this intermediate will be a spectator species while dominating the surface inter- mediates."
          [14] "This conclusion agrees well with recent experimental observations [26]."
          [15] "For the 4-membered ring cluster Z4a, the overall free energy of alkyl activation (AG0 a) is lower than the carbenium acti- vation: 47.6 and 42.7 kcal/mol (Table 3) for alkyl activation,compared with 61.1 and 58.4 kcal/mol (Table 2) for carbenium activation."
          [16] "Thus, alkene desorption is a rate-limiting step for the overall alkyl activation catalytic cycle irrespec- tive of the activity of the particular catalytic site."

          [43] "The ethene desorption barriers are 65.5 and 66.8 kcal/mol for this particular site."

          [53] "This CH bond of the methyl group is strongly polarized and elongated."
          [54] "Thus, the geometry of the intermediate D for alkyl activation is conducive for the formation of the Gaalkyl species and Brnsted acid site."
          [55] "Thus, to compare different carbenium activation paths, we define an activation energy term called the overall carbenium activation barrier (CEa)."
          [56] "This activation barrier represents the upper limit of the apparent activation barrier; the actual apparent ac- tivation barrier will depend on the surface coverage and hence on the reaction conditions, which can be determined via rig- orous kinetic simulation [29]."

          [63] "As ex- pected, the activation barrier (ECEa) is fairly constant, vary- ing around 2535 kcal/mol."
          [64] "This mechanistic step is known as a structure-insensitive reaction in the sense that the activation barrier does not depend on the distance between the pair of the framework Al."
          [65] "In any case, starting from the alkoxide interme- diate, the free energy of activation for alkene desorption is well"
          [66] "below of that for carbenium activation and thus will be incon- sequential in determining the resulting apparent free energy of activation for the dehydrogenation reaction."
          [67] "For the Z4a ring, the undercoordinated Ga species [GaH]2+ lies in the plane with OAlO, in contrast to the more tetra- hedral coordination of the Ga for the other cluster structures."
          [68] "At the same time, the 4-member ring presents an exception to the end-on adsorbed complex observed for alkyl activa- tion."
          [69] "The steric repulsion of the walls surrounding the smaller ring could be a reason for the preferred sidewise adsorption of the ethane molecule."
          [70] "The overall free energies of carbe- nium activation (CG0 a) for the two paths for Z4a site are 61.1 and 58.5 kcal/mol."
          [71] "As discussed previously, for the carbenium activation mechanism, desorption of an alkene from alkoxide intermediate is much more facile with a ECG0 a of 24.7 and 26.8 kcal/mol."
          [72] "For each of the four reduction pathways for S5a, there is a distinct carbenium activation pathway."
          [73] "The stability of the active site in the monohydride form transpires into the higher activation energy for carbenium activation."
          [74] "The free energies of carbenium activation (A + C2H6 E, CG0 a) for four differ- ent reaction paths are 85.4, 81.4, 92.3, and 81.7 kcal/mol."
          [75] "The corresponding free energy barriers for ethene removal (F I in Scheme 2) are 20.0, 34.0, 21.6, and 29.6 kcal/mol."
          [76] "Again,note that ethene removal from alkoxide is very facile compared with the carbenium activation mechanism."
          [77] "The six-membered ring S6a provides the most stable coor- dination for the [GaH]2+ species."
          [78] "Correspondingly, the highest activation barrier for the carbenium activation is observed."
          [79] "As noted previously [33], due to the higher stability of the cat- alytic site S6a in the monohydride form, the undercoordinated [GaH]2+ species (B and D) are absent along the reaction path."
          [80] "The free energies of carbenium activation (CG0 a) for the two mechanistic paths (A + C2H6 E in Scheme 2) are 96.4 and 99.2 kcal/mol, with corresponding free energies of activation for ethene removal of (ECG0 a) of 27.1 and 22.6 kcal/mol."
          [81] "For the other six-membered ring structure S6b, we studied four distinct carbenium activation paths."
          [82] "The energetics of all four reaction pathways are very similar due to symmetry of the site S6b."
          [83] "Because site S6b is less stable (H 0 red less en- dothermic in Table 1) than S6a, the activation barriers for carbe- nium activation are lower."
          [84] "Free energies of carbenium activation (CG0 a) are 87.0, 89.1, 88.2, and 94.1 kcal/mol."
          [85] "As reported in Table 2, the free energies of activation for ethene desorption are about 28 kcal/mol for all four reaction paths."
          [86] "For the 8-membered ring Z8a, 3.6 kcal/mol heat of re- duction indicates the formation of the [GaH2]+Z m is slightly exothermic."
          [87] "The lower stability of the site Z8a leads to lower free energies of the carbenium activation (62.6 and 62.0 kcal/ mol for two pathways)."
          [88] "For the other 8-membered ring Z8b, the reduction is much more exothermic with H 0 red of 19.6 and 18.6 kcal/mol."

          [95] "In our previous publication on the role of frameworkAl pair sites, we specifically focused on the carbenium activation mechanism, expecting a very high activation barrier [33,41] for alkene desorption from Gaalkyl species."
          [96] "Frash and van Santen [41] showed that for the active site involving single- frameworkAl, alkyl activation has a lower activation barrier than carbenium activation."
          [97] "A similar trend is expected for the frameworkAl pair sites."
          [98] "Similar to the carbenium activation,here the first step involves opening of the GaO coordination (A + C2H6 [B] D in Scheme 3) to form the activated intermediate D."
          [99] "In contrast to end-on adsorbed complex for carbenium activation, for alkyl activation, we observed that the methyl group adsorbs in a sidewise fashion (intermediate D in Scheme 3)."
          [100] "In this activated intermediate, only two hydro- gen atoms and the carbon of the methyl group are closer to the undercoordinated Ga."
          [101] "On the opposite side of the Ga, the third hydrogen of the methyl group is closer to the framework oxy- gen."
          [102] "This CH bond of the methyl group is strongly polarized and elongated."
          [103] "Thus, the geometry of the intermediate D for alkyl activation is conducive for the formation of the Gaalkyl species and Brnsted acid site."
          [104] "Thus, to compare different alkyl activation paths,we have defined an activation energy term called the overall alkyl activation barrier (AEa), representing the energy differ- ence between E and A + C2H6."
          [105] "This activation barrier is the approximate apparent activation barrier, because we have ne- glected the possible presence of the intermediates B and D for our analysis."
          [106] "We calculated the corresponding free energy change (AG0 a) for A + C2H6 E transformation and in Ta- ble 3 report the energy terms for all of the alkyl activation paths:alkyl activation energy (AEa), standard free energies of acti- vation (AG0 a at 25 C and 1 atm), reaction energy (AEr),and free energy change for alkyl activation (AG0 r )."
          [107] "Alkyl activation is followed by desorption of an alkene (ethene) from the Gaalkyl intermediate (F [I] J K + C2H4), leaving behind the gallium dihydride species ([GaH2]+Z m)."
          [108] "Relaxation of the transition state I toward prod- uct leads to the formation of the intermediate J with ethene adsorbed (Ï-bonded) on the [GaH2]+Z m."
          [109] "Intermediate J indi- cates that the tetrahedral Ga species is coordinated with only one framework oxygen (monodentate)."
          [110] "After the desorption of ethene, the [GaH2]+ species should relax to the more stable bidentate coordination (species K), as shown in Scheme 3."
          [111] "Various energy terms for ethene desorption (EAEa, EAG0 a, EAEr and EAG0 r ) are reported in Table 3."
          [112] "Desorption of ethene from Gaalkyl species has been well studied [33,41], and a very high activation barrier of about 60 kcal/mol has been reported."
          [113] "Because desorption is associated with the Ga species adjacent to a single-framework Al, the activation barrier is expected to be independent (structure insensitive) of the dis- tance between the framework Alpair."
          [114] "In the reminder of this section, we discuss the details of the alkyl activation mecha- nism for each catalytic site."
          [115] "For the 4-membered ring cluster Z4a, the overall free energy of alkyl activation (AG0 a) is lower than the carbenium acti- vation: 47.6 and 42.7 kcal/mol (Table 3) for alkyl activation,compared with 61.1 and 58.4 kcal/mol (Table 2) for carbenium activation."
          [116] "The free energies of activation for ethene removal are 62.0 and 64.4 kcal/mol, respectively."
          [117] "The stability of the bicationic gallium monohydride species in the S5a ring makes alkyl activation more difficult compared with that for Z4a."
          [118] "As expected, the free energy activation bar- riers (66.4, 61.9, 66.6, and 54.7 kcal/mol) are lower than those for carbenium activation."
          [119] "The structure-insensitive ethene re- moval step faces typical free energy barriers of 56.5, 57.8, 48.8,and 63.9 kcal/mol."

          [124] "The Z8a ring structure provides a less stable coordina- tion for the [GaH]2+ species, with lower resulting activation barriers for CH dissociation by the alkyl activation mecha- nism."

          [126] "Ethene removal barriers of 63.3 and 64.1 kcal/mol would make this the rate-limiting step."
          [127] "For the least stable site, Z8b, the alkyl activation barriers (AG0 a) are 29.0 and 27.0 kcal/mol."
          [128] "The barriers for the forma- tion of the undercoordinated GaH species are relatively higher."
          [129] "The ethene desorption barriers are 65.5 and 66.8 kcal/mol for this particular site."
          [130] "Thus, alkene desorption is a rate-limiting step for the overall alkyl activation catalytic cycle irrespec- tive of the activity of the particular catalytic site."

          [135] "Thus, this mechanism of decomposition should set a lower limit of about 55 kcal/mol for the apparent activation barrier."
          [136] "We repeated the calculation of this cyclic transition state for all the pair site models; the resulting activation energies (EDEa) are reported in Table 3."
          [137] "The constant values of EDEa suggest that this decomposition mechanism is a structure- insensitive reaction."

[1] "The authors concluded that the alkyl activation path for [HGaH]+ species is the actual path for dehydrogenation."
          [2] "However, this conclusion was based on the observation that at higher temperatures, the initial CH activation step becomes the rate-determining step, and the calculated activation barrier (3940 kcal/mol) for this first step is in close agreement with the experimentally estimated value of 39 kcal/mol [20]."
          [3] "We find that the activation energy for initial CH activation is substantially higher (48.66 kcal/mol) compared to their previously calculated [37] value of 37.9 kcal/mol."

          [7] "We conclude from the previous literature, and from our extension here, that the single site, [HGaH]+, model does not represent the true mechanism for Ga-assisted dehydrogenation."
          [8] "We find the energy barrier for CH activation is 85.72 kcal/mol, corresponding to the initial alkane adsorption and hydrogen removal."
          [9] "The activation barrier for this step (process V + C2H6 ! TS11 in Fig. 7) is very high considering the other reaction paths we have presented so far."
          [10] "The activation barrier for hydrogen removal is substantially smaller than that for CH activation."
          [11] "The activation barrier for CH activation is directly related to the large endothermicity of the CH activation step (DE = 51.40 kcal/mol)."

[1] "Similar to the carbenium mechanism, the alkyl mechanism could be at play regardless of the specific structure of active Ga species, on which propane is initially activated by the metal cation to form the alkyl gallium intermediate, followed by the Î²-elimination and the desorption of propylene and H2."

          [2] "The modifying cations play key roles in dehydrogenation of paraffins [25,1416], whereas Brnsted acid protons catalyze the oligomerization of the olefins thus produced and possibly their subsequent aromatization."

          [11] "The low energy of the d-orbitals of Ga+ and its occupied s-orbital that make them unable to donate or accept electrons,respectively, from the hydrocarbon result in a high barrier for the direct oxidative addition of ethane to the cation."
          [12] "Therefore,heterolytic splitting of the CH bond is much more favorable due to the polarization induced by the interaction of the hydrocarbon with the Ga...O Lewis acidbase pair."

          [4] "When hydrogen is the reducing agent, the decomposition of the binuclear oxidic species is partially reversed when hydrogen flow is replaced by inert gas, but when the reducing agent is propane the formation of isolated Ga(I) species is irreversible, probably because it is stabilized by alkyl groups bonded to gallium, that were seen to be formed and to be stable when propane flow is replaced by inert gas."

          [28] "A sequence of steps that corresponds essentially to reaction (19) has been analyzed by Frash and van Santen [24] in their theoreti- cal study of ethane activation on gallium-exchanged zeolites,with dihydridogallium ions as the active sites."
          [29] "In their scheme,the alkyl- hydridogallium species in reaction (19) decomposes to produce an alkene molecule and regenerate the dihydrido active site."
          [30] "Our results suggest that the decomposition of the alkylhydrido inter- mediate occurs by reactions (17) and (18) instead."

[1] "The beneficial effect of Ga on alkane aromatization rates and selectivity has been observed whether Ga ions are introduced by impregnation [16,26,28,29,33,35] or ion exchange techniques [15,18,22,23,32]."
          [2] "The addition of metal species to H-ZSM5 channels increase aromatic turnover rates and actually decrease cracking turnover rates (Fig. 3)."
          [3] "The initial rate of propene formation is much higher on Ga/H-ZSM5 and Zn/H-ZSM5 compared to H-ZSM5, but isotopic evidence from C3Hs/C3D 8 mixtures show that C-H bond activation rate depends weakly on the presence of Ga and Zn."
          [4] "Reactions over Na-ZSM5 confirm that C-H bond activation occurs predominantly on BrOnsted acid sites."
          [5] "Ga and Zn sites increase the rate of propene formation by removing H-atoms from acid sites that activate C-H bonds, allowing acid sites to turnover without the formation of cracking products."
          [6] "Ga and Zn act as 'portholes' and catalyze the recombinative desorption of H-atoms, formed from acid-catalyzed C-H bond cleavage, as all-hydrogen (He)."
          [7] "Adsorption-desorption steps,however, remain irreversible and not fully equi- librated even on Ga/H-ZSM5 and Zn/H- ZSM5."
          [8] "This H-atom disposal step remains the rate-determining step for each sequential dehy- drogenation reaction required to convert propane to aromatics."
          [9] "The presence of Ga species allows gas phase hydrogen to dissocia- tively adsorb and to effectively compete for surface sites, thus decreasing aromatic selectiv- ity."
          [10] "The addition of 13CO2 also increases the aromatics selectivity on H-ZSM5 (Fig. 24)."
          [11] "The introduction of alternate H-disposal path- ways, whether by using stoichiometric acceptors (CO, CO 2, or 0 2) or metal cations (Ga or Zn),removes the burden of hydrogen removal from other steps that form light alkanes and reduce aromatics selectivity."
          [12] "The addition of metal cations also increases the deuterium content in 'unreacted' propane (Fig. 18)."
          [13] "The addition of Ga and Zn increase the deuterium incorporation turnovers (Fig. 19)."
          [14] "Ga and Zn species increase the rate of both H-atom recombinative desorption and of H 2 dissociative adsorption during propane dehydrocyclodimerization reactions [22,28,29,42]."

[1] "The two basic mechanisms of CH activationcarbenium activation and alkyl activationare shown in Schemes 2 and 3,respectively."
          [2] "The carbenium activation involves CH bond po- larization in such a way that the carbon atom assumes a positive partial charge (Î´+) and hydrogen assumes a negative partial charge (Î´). Carbenium activation leads to the formation of alkoxide and metal hydride (MH) as an intermediate."
          [3] "In contrast, alkyl activation (Scheme 3) involves CH polarization in such a way that the carbon develops a negative (Î´) charge and the hydrogen develops a positive (Î´+) charge. Alkyl activation leads to the formation of a metal-alkyl (MCnH2n+1) and the Brnsted acid as intermediates."
          [4] "We investigated both mecha- nisms for all of the clusters discussed so far, and we discuss the results next."
          [5] "The first step involves the opening of the GaO coordination (A + C2H6 [B] D in Scheme 2) to form the activated intermediate D."
          [6] "The intermediate D further undergoes carbenium activation,as shown in Scheme 2 (D [E] F)."
          [7] "Carbenium activation is followed by the desorption of an alkene (ethene) from the alkoxide intermediate (F [I] J K + C2H4), leaving behind the Brnsted acid site."
          [8] "The intermediate D further undergoes alkyl activation as shown in Scheme 3 (D [E] F)."
          [9] "Alkyl activation is followed by desorption of an alkene (ethene) from the Gaalkyl intermediate (F [I] J K + C2H4), leaving behind the gallium dihydride species ([GaH2]+Z m)."
          [10] "The overall carbenium activation barrier (CEa) decreases rapidly with decreasing (more exothermic) heat of reduction (H 0 red)."
          [11] "A linear Polanyi relation [47] between the overall alkyl activa- tion barrier (AEa) and the heat of reduction (H 0 red) is seen."
          [12] "Although alkyl activation is much more facile than the carbenium activation, ethene removal from [HGaC2H5]+Z m intermediate faces a very high activation bar- rier of 60 kcal/mol."
          [13] "Thus, we conclude that this intermediate will be a spectator species while dominating the surface inter- mediates."
          [14] "This conclusion agrees well with recent experimental observations [26]."
          [15] "For the 4-membered ring cluster Z4a, the overall free energy of alkyl activation (AG0 a) is lower than the carbenium acti- vation: 47.6 and 42.7 kcal/mol (Table 3) for alkyl activation,compared with 61.1 and 58.4 kcal/mol (Table 2) for carbenium activation."
          [16] "Thus, alkene desorption is a rate-limiting step for the overall alkyl activation catalytic cycle irrespec- tive of the activity of the particular catalytic site."
          [17] "Recently, Pidko et al. [42] reported a novel one-step H2 and C2H4 de- sorption pathway from gallium alkyl intermediate."
          [18] "This path- way involves a cyclic transition state with an activation bar- rier of 53.5 kcal/mol."
          [19] "We also calculated an activation bar- rier of 54.6 kcal/mol using a single-framework substitution model of the active site as described previously [33]."
          [20] "Thus, this mechanism of decomposition should set a lower limit of about 55 kcal/mol for the apparent activation barrier."
          [21] "The free energies of carbenium activation (A + C2H6 E, CG0 a) for four differ- ent reaction paths are 85.4, 81.4, 92.3, and 81.7 kcal/mol."

          [31] "The stability of the bicationic gallium monohydride species in the S5a ring makes alkyl activation more difficult compared with that for Z4a."

          [42] "The barriers for the forma- tion of the undercoordinated GaH species are relatively higher."
          [43] "The ethene desorption barriers are 65.5 and 66.8 kcal/mol for this particular site."
          [44] "Thus, alkene desorption is a rate-limiting step for the overall alkyl activation catalytic cycle irrespec- tive of the activity of the particular catalytic site."
          [45] "The first step involves the opening of the GaO coordination (A + C2H6 [B] D in Scheme 2) to form the activated intermediate D."
          [46] "Depending on the site geom- etry, the undercoordinated GaH (intermediate D), representing the activated catalytic site, may or may not be stable."
          [47] "The ethane molecule is adsorbed on to the electron-deficient, coor- dinately unsaturated GaH species."
          [48] "As was pointed out earlier,the CH bonds of the methyl group are strongly polarized and elongated."
          [49] "In general, we have observed that for carbenium activation, the methyl group adsorbs in an end-on fashion (in- termediate D in Scheme 2)."
          [50] "In contrast to end-on adsorbed complex for carbenium activation, for alkyl activation, we observed that the methyl group adsorbs in a sidewise fashion (intermediate D in Scheme 3)."
          [51] "In this activated intermediate, only two hydro- gen atoms and the carbon of the methyl group are closer to the undercoordinated Ga."
          [52] "On the opposite side of the Ga, the third hydrogen of the methyl group is closer to the framework oxy- gen."
          [53] "This CH bond of the methyl group is strongly polarized and elongated."
          [54] "Thus, the geometry of the intermediate D for alkyl activation is conducive for the formation of the Gaalkyl species and Brnsted acid site."
          [55] "Thus, to compare different carbenium activation paths, we define an activation energy term called the overall carbenium activation barrier (CEa)."
          [56] "This activation barrier represents the upper limit of the apparent activation barrier; the actual apparent ac- tivation barrier will depend on the surface coverage and hence on the reaction conditions, which can be determined via rig- orous kinetic simulation [29]."
          [57] "We calculated the free energy change for A + C2H6 E activation (CG0 a), which allowed us to compare the reaction rate along a certain reaction path and determine the rate-controlling step."
          [58] "For all active site struc- tures, energy parameters related to carbenium activation are listed in Table 2."
          [59] "Carbenium activation is followed by the desorption of an alkene (ethene) from the alkoxide intermediate (F [I] J K + C2H4), leaving behind the Brnsted acid site."
          [60] "However, a proton jump from one bridging oxygen to other is much more facile [62] compared with the other mecha- nistic steps."
          [61] "In the discussions on the hydrogen desorption step that fol- lows, we start with the Brnsted acid site on the same bridging oxygen (intermediate K) bearing the alkoxide intermediate, to be consistent with the reduction path of the [GaH]2+Z2 d site."
          [62] "The related energy parameters (ECEa, ECG0 a, ECEr, and ECG0 r ) for ethene desorption are listed in Table 2."
          [63] "As ex- pected, the activation barrier (ECEa) is fairly constant, vary- ing around 2535 kcal/mol."
          [64] "This mechanistic step is known as a structure-insensitive reaction in the sense that the activation barrier does not depend on the distance between the pair of the framework Al."
          [65] "In any case, starting from the alkoxide interme- diate, the free energy of activation for alkene desorption is well"
          [66] "below of that for carbenium activation and thus will be incon- sequential in determining the resulting apparent free energy of activation for the dehydrogenation reaction."
          [67] "For the Z4a ring, the undercoordinated Ga species [GaH]2+ lies in the plane with OAlO, in contrast to the more tetra- hedral coordination of the Ga for the other cluster structures."
          [68] "At the same time, the 4-member ring presents an exception to the end-on adsorbed complex observed for alkyl activa- tion."
          [69] "The steric repulsion of the walls surrounding the smaller ring could be a reason for the preferred sidewise adsorption of the ethane molecule."
          [70] "The overall free energies of carbe- nium activation (CG0 a) for the two paths for Z4a site are 61.1 and 58.5 kcal/mol."
          [71] "As discussed previously, for the carbenium activation mechanism, desorption of an alkene from alkoxide intermediate is much more facile with a ECG0 a of 24.7 and 26.8 kcal/mol."
          [72] "For each of the four reduction pathways for S5a, there is a distinct carbenium activation pathway."
          [73] "The stability of the active site in the monohydride form transpires into the higher activation energy for carbenium activation."
          [74] "The free energies of carbenium activation (A + C2H6 E, CG0 a) for four differ- ent reaction paths are 85.4, 81.4, 92.3, and 81.7 kcal/mol."
          [75] "The corresponding free energy barriers for ethene removal (F I in Scheme 2) are 20.0, 34.0, 21.6, and 29.6 kcal/mol."
          [76] "Again,note that ethene removal from alkoxide is very facile compared with the carbenium activation mechanism."
          [77] "The six-membered ring S6a provides the most stable coor- dination for the [GaH]2+ species."
          [78] "Correspondingly, the highest activation barrier for the carbenium activation is observed."
          [79] "As noted previously [33], due to the higher stability of the cat- alytic site S6a in the monohydride form, the undercoordinated [GaH]2+ species (B and D) are absent along the reaction path."
          [80] "The free energies of carbenium activation (CG0 a) for the two mechanistic paths (A + C2H6 E in Scheme 2) are 96.4 and 99.2 kcal/mol, with corresponding free energies of activation for ethene removal of (ECG0 a) of 27.1 and 22.6 kcal/mol."
          [81] "For the other six-membered ring structure S6b, we studied four distinct carbenium activation paths."
          [82] "The energetics of all four reaction pathways are very similar due to symmetry of the site S6b."
          [83] "Because site S6b is less stable (H 0 red less en- dothermic in Table 1) than S6a, the activation barriers for carbe- nium activation are lower."
          [84] "Free energies of carbenium activation (CG0 a) are 87.0, 89.1, 88.2, and 94.1 kcal/mol."
          [85] "As reported in Table 2, the free energies of activation for ethene desorption are about 28 kcal/mol for all four reaction paths."
          [86] "For the 8-membered ring Z8a, 3.6 kcal/mol heat of re- duction indicates the formation of the [GaH2]+Z m is slightly exothermic."

          [95] "In our previous publication on the role of frameworkAl pair sites, we specifically focused on the carbenium activation mechanism, expecting a very high activation barrier [33,41] for alkene desorption from Gaalkyl species."
          [96] "Frash and van Santen [41] showed that for the active site involving single- frameworkAl, alkyl activation has a lower activation barrier than carbenium activation."

[1] "Similar to the carbenium mechanism, the alkyl mechanism could be at play regardless of the specific structure of active Ga species, on which propane is initially activated by the metal cation to form the alkyl gallium intermediate, followed by the Î²-elimination and the desorption of propylene and H2."

          [3] "This process is accompanied by some de-alumination of the zeolite framework to produce extraframework alumina, which also helps to explain the decrease in Brnsted acidity and increase in Lewis acidity."
          [4] "When hydrogen is the reducing agent, the decomposition of the binuclear oxidic species is partially reversed when hydrogen flow is replaced by inert gas, but when the reducing agent is propane the formation of isolated Ga(I) species is irreversible, probably because it is stabilized by alkyl groups bonded to gallium, that were seen to be formed and to be stable when propane flow is replaced by inert gas."
          [5] "Dihydridogallium ions were observed after reduction in hydrogen, but were slowly decomposed when hydrogen flow was replaced by inert gas."
          [6] "This slow decomposition of the dihydridogallium ions shows that it cannot intermediate hydrogen desorption during the aromatization reaction."

          [8] "Under propane flow, dihydridogallium cations were never detected."

          [3] "The initial rate of propene formation is much higher on Ga/H-ZSM5 and Zn/H-ZSM5 compared to H-ZSM5, but isotopic evidence from C3Hs/C3D 8 mixtures show that C-H bond activation rate depends weakly on the presence of Ga and Zn."
          [4] "Reactions over Na-ZSM5 confirm that C-H bond activation occurs predominantly on BrOnsted acid sites."

[1] "The two basic mechanisms of CH activationcarbenium activation and alkyl activationare shown in Schemes 2 and 3,respectively."
          [2] "The carbenium activation involves CH bond po- larization in such a way that the carbon atom assumes a positive partial charge (Î´+) and hydrogen assumes a negative partial charge (Î´). Carbenium activation leads to the formation of alkoxide and metal hydride (MH) as an intermediate."
          [3] "In contrast, alkyl activation (Scheme 3) involves CH polarization in such a way that the carbon develops a negative (Î´) charge and the hydrogen develops a positive (Î´+) charge. Alkyl activation leads to the formation of a metal-alkyl (MCnH2n+1) and the Brnsted acid as intermediates."
          [4] "We investigated both mecha- nisms for all of the clusters discussed so far, and we discuss the results next."
          [5] "The first step involves the opening of the GaO coordination (A + C2H6 [B] D in Scheme 2) to form the activated intermediate D."
          [6] "The intermediate D further undergoes carbenium activation,as shown in Scheme 2 (D [E] F)."
          [7] "Carbenium activation is followed by the desorption of an alkene (ethene) from the alkoxide intermediate (F [I] J K + C2H4), leaving behind the Brnsted acid site."

          [12] "Although alkyl activation is much more facile than the carbenium activation, ethene removal from [HGaC2H5]+Z m intermediate faces a very high activation bar- rier of 60 kcal/mol."
          [13] "Thus, we conclude that this intermediate will be a spectator species while dominating the surface inter- mediates."
          [14] "This conclusion agrees well with recent experimental observations [26]."
          [15] "For the 4-membered ring cluster Z4a, the overall free energy of alkyl activation (AG0 a) is lower than the carbenium acti- vation: 47.6 and 42.7 kcal/mol (Table 3) for alkyl activation,compared with 61.1 and 58.4 kcal/mol (Table 2) for carbenium activation."
          [16] "Thus, alkene desorption is a rate-limiting step for the overall alkyl activation catalytic cycle irrespec- tive of the activity of the particular catalytic site."

          [43] "The ethene desorption barriers are 65.5 and 66.8 kcal/mol for this particular site."
          [44] "Thus, alkene desorption is a rate-limiting step for the overall alkyl activation catalytic cycle irrespec- tive of the activity of the particular catalytic site."
          [45] "The first step involves the opening of the GaO coordination (A + C2H6 [B] D in Scheme 2) to form the activated intermediate D."
          [46] "Depending on the site geom- etry, the undercoordinated GaH (intermediate D), representing the activated catalytic site, may or may not be stable."

          [48] "As was pointed out earlier,the CH bonds of the methyl group are strongly polarized and elongated."
          [49] "In general, we have observed that for carbenium activation, the methyl group adsorbs in an end-on fashion (in- termediate D in Scheme 2)."
          [50] "In contrast to end-on adsorbed complex for carbenium activation, for alkyl activation, we observed that the methyl group adsorbs in a sidewise fashion (intermediate D in Scheme 3)."

          [53] "This CH bond of the methyl group is strongly polarized and elongated."
          [54] "Thus, the geometry of the intermediate D for alkyl activation is conducive for the formation of the Gaalkyl species and Brnsted acid site."
          [55] "Thus, to compare different carbenium activation paths, we define an activation energy term called the overall carbenium activation barrier (CEa)."
          [56] "This activation barrier represents the upper limit of the apparent activation barrier; the actual apparent ac- tivation barrier will depend on the surface coverage and hence on the reaction conditions, which can be determined via rig- orous kinetic simulation [29]."
          [57] "We calculated the free energy change for A + C2H6 E activation (CG0 a), which allowed us to compare the reaction rate along a certain reaction path and determine the rate-controlling step."

          [61] "In the discussions on the hydrogen desorption step that fol- lows, we start with the Brnsted acid site on the same bridging oxygen (intermediate K) bearing the alkoxide intermediate, to be consistent with the reduction path of the [GaH]2+Z2 d site."
          [62] "The related energy parameters (ECEa, ECG0 a, ECEr, and ECG0 r ) for ethene desorption are listed in Table 2."
          [63] "As ex- pected, the activation barrier (ECEa) is fairly constant, vary- ing around 2535 kcal/mol."
          [64] "This mechanistic step is known as a structure-insensitive reaction in the sense that the activation barrier does not depend on the distance between the pair of the framework Al."
          [65] "In any case, starting from the alkoxide interme- diate, the free energy of activation for alkene desorption is well"
          [66] "below of that for carbenium activation and thus will be incon- sequential in determining the resulting apparent free energy of activation for the dehydrogenation reaction."
          [67] "For the Z4a ring, the undercoordinated Ga species [GaH]2+ lies in the plane with OAlO, in contrast to the more tetra- hedral coordination of the Ga for the other cluster structures."
          [68] "At the same time, the 4-member ring presents an exception to the end-on adsorbed complex observed for alkyl activa- tion."
          [69] "The steric repulsion of the walls surrounding the smaller ring could be a reason for the preferred sidewise adsorption of the ethane molecule."
          [70] "The overall free energies of carbe- nium activation (CG0 a) for the two paths for Z4a site are 61.1 and 58.5 kcal/mol."
          [71] "As discussed previously, for the carbenium activation mechanism, desorption of an alkene from alkoxide intermediate is much more facile with a ECG0 a of 24.7 and 26.8 kcal/mol."
          [72] "For each of the four reduction pathways for S5a, there is a distinct carbenium activation pathway."
          [73] "The stability of the active site in the monohydride form transpires into the higher activation energy for carbenium activation."
          [74] "The free energies of carbenium activation (A + C2H6 E, CG0 a) for four differ- ent reaction paths are 85.4, 81.4, 92.3, and 81.7 kcal/mol."
          [75] "The corresponding free energy barriers for ethene removal (F I in Scheme 2) are 20.0, 34.0, 21.6, and 29.6 kcal/mol."
          [76] "Again,note that ethene removal from alkoxide is very facile compared with the carbenium activation mechanism."
          [77] "The six-membered ring S6a provides the most stable coor- dination for the [GaH]2+ species."
          [78] "Correspondingly, the highest activation barrier for the carbenium activation is observed."
          [79] "As noted previously [33], due to the higher stability of the cat- alytic site S6a in the monohydride form, the undercoordinated [GaH]2+ species (B and D) are absent along the reaction path."
          [80] "The free energies of carbenium activation (CG0 a) for the two mechanistic paths (A + C2H6 E in Scheme 2) are 96.4 and 99.2 kcal/mol, with corresponding free energies of activation for ethene removal of (ECG0 a) of 27.1 and 22.6 kcal/mol."
          [81] "For the other six-membered ring structure S6b, we studied four distinct carbenium activation paths."
          [82] "The energetics of all four reaction pathways are very similar due to symmetry of the site S6b."
          [83] "Because site S6b is less stable (H 0 red less en- dothermic in Table 1) than S6a, the activation barriers for carbe- nium activation are lower."
          [84] "Free energies of carbenium activation (CG0 a) are 87.0, 89.1, 88.2, and 94.1 kcal/mol."
          [85] "As reported in Table 2, the free energies of activation for ethene desorption are about 28 kcal/mol for all four reaction paths."
          [86] "For the 8-membered ring Z8a, 3.6 kcal/mol heat of re- duction indicates the formation of the [GaH2]+Z m is slightly exothermic."
          [87] "The lower stability of the site Z8a leads to lower free energies of the carbenium activation (62.6 and 62.0 kcal/ mol for two pathways)."
          [88] "For the other 8-membered ring Z8b, the reduction is much more exothermic with H 0 red of 19.6 and 18.6 kcal/mol."

          [95] "In our previous publication on the role of frameworkAl pair sites, we specifically focused on the carbenium activation mechanism, expecting a very high activation barrier [33,41] for alkene desorption from Gaalkyl species."
          [96] "Frash and van Santen [41] showed that for the active site involving single- frameworkAl, alkyl activation has a lower activation barrier than carbenium activation."
          [97] "A similar trend is expected for the frameworkAl pair sites."
          [98] "Similar to the carbenium activation,here the first step involves opening of the GaO coordination (A + C2H6 [B] D in Scheme 3) to form the activated intermediate D."
          [99] "In contrast to end-on adsorbed complex for carbenium activation, for alkyl activation, we observed that the methyl group adsorbs in a sidewise fashion (intermediate D in Scheme 3)."
          [100] "In this activated intermediate, only two hydro- gen atoms and the carbon of the methyl group are closer to the undercoordinated Ga."
          [101] "On the opposite side of the Ga, the third hydrogen of the methyl group is closer to the framework oxy- gen."
          [102] "This CH bond of the methyl group is strongly polarized and elongated."
          [103] "Thus, the geometry of the intermediate D for alkyl activation is conducive for the formation of the Gaalkyl species and Brnsted acid site."
          [104] "Thus, to compare different alkyl activation paths,we have defined an activation energy term called the overall alkyl activation barrier (AEa), representing the energy differ- ence between E and A + C2H6."
          [105] "This activation barrier is the approximate apparent activation barrier, because we have ne- glected the possible presence of the intermediates B and D for our analysis."
          [106] "We calculated the corresponding free energy change (AG0 a) for A + C2H6 E transformation and in Ta- ble 3 report the energy terms for all of the alkyl activation paths:alkyl activation energy (AEa), standard free energies of acti- vation (AG0 a at 25 C and 1 atm), reaction energy (AEr),and free energy change for alkyl activation (AG0 r )."
          [107] "Alkyl activation is followed by desorption of an alkene (ethene) from the Gaalkyl intermediate (F [I] J K + C2H4), leaving behind the gallium dihydride species ([GaH2]+Z m)."
          [108] "Relaxation of the transition state I toward prod- uct leads to the formation of the intermediate J with ethene adsorbed (Ï-bonded) on the [GaH2]+Z m."
          [109] "Intermediate J indi- cates that the tetrahedral Ga species is coordinated with only one framework oxygen (monodentate)."
          [110] "After the desorption of ethene, the [GaH2]+ species should relax to the more stable bidentate coordination (species K), as shown in Scheme 3."
          [111] "Various energy terms for ethene desorption (EAEa, EAG0 a, EAEr and EAG0 r ) are reported in Table 3."
          [112] "Desorption of ethene from Gaalkyl species has been well studied [33,41], and a very high activation barrier of about 60 kcal/mol has been reported."
          [113] "Because desorption is associated with the Ga species adjacent to a single-framework Al, the activation barrier is expected to be independent (structure insensitive) of the dis- tance between the framework Alpair."
          [114] "In the reminder of this section, we discuss the details of the alkyl activation mecha- nism for each catalytic site."
          [115] "For the 4-membered ring cluster Z4a, the overall free energy of alkyl activation (AG0 a) is lower than the carbenium acti- vation: 47.6 and 42.7 kcal/mol (Table 3) for alkyl activation,compared with 61.1 and 58.4 kcal/mol (Table 2) for carbenium activation."
          [116] "The free energies of activation for ethene removal are 62.0 and 64.4 kcal/mol, respectively."
          [117] "The stability of the bicationic gallium monohydride species in the S5a ring makes alkyl activation more difficult compared with that for Z4a."
          [118] "As expected, the free energy activation bar- riers (66.4, 61.9, 66.6, and 54.7 kcal/mol) are lower than those for carbenium activation."
          [119] "The structure-insensitive ethene re- moval step faces typical free energy barriers of 56.5, 57.8, 48.8,and 63.9 kcal/mol."
          [120] "The S6a structure has large free energy barriers (AG0 a) of 69.6 and 73.8 kcal/mol, with ethene removal barriers of ca."

          [124] "The Z8a ring structure provides a less stable coordina- tion for the [GaH]2+ species, with lower resulting activation barriers for CH dissociation by the alkyl activation mecha- nism."
          [125] "We calculated the free energy activation barriers to be 42.5 and 37.7 kcal/mol."
          [126] "Ethene removal barriers of 63.3 and 64.1 kcal/mol would make this the rate-limiting step."
          [127] "For the least stable site, Z8b, the alkyl activation barriers (AG0 a) are 29.0 and 27.0 kcal/mol."
          [128] "The barriers for the forma- tion of the undercoordinated GaH species are relatively higher."
          [129] "The ethene desorption barriers are 65.5 and 66.8 kcal/mol for this particular site."
          [130] "Thus, alkene desorption is a rate-limiting step for the overall alkyl activation catalytic cycle irrespec- tive of the activity of the particular catalytic site."

          [134] "We also calculated an activation bar- rier of 54.6 kcal/mol using a single-framework substitution model of the active site as described previously [33]."
          [135] "Thus, this mechanism of decomposition should set a lower limit of about 55 kcal/mol for the apparent activation barrier."
          [136] "We repeated the calculation of this cyclic transition state for all the pair site models; the resulting activation energies (EDEa) are reported in Table 3."
          [137] "The constant values of EDEa suggest that this decomposition mechanism is a structure- insensitive reaction."

[1] "The authors concluded that the alkyl activation path for [HGaH]+ species is the actual path for dehydrogenation."
          [2] "However, this conclusion was based on the observation that at higher temperatures, the initial CH activation step becomes the rate-determining step, and the calculated activation barrier (3940 kcal/mol) for this first step is in close agreement with the experimentally estimated value of 39 kcal/mol [20]."
          [3] "We find that the activation energy for initial CH activation is substantially higher (48.66 kcal/mol) compared to their previously calculated [37] value of 37.9 kcal/mol."

          [5] "The activation barrier for the alkyl desorption (process X ! TS4 in Fig. 3) was 61.67 kcal/mol, which is in close agreement with the previously reported [37] value of 60.7 kcal/mol."
          [6] "This high activationbarrierfor thealkylremovalstepshouldleadtovery low intrinsic reaction rate for the alkyl activation mechanism."
          [7] "We conclude from the previous literature, and from our extension here, that the single site, [HGaH]+, model does not represent the true mechanism for Ga-assisted dehydrogenation."
          [8] "We find the energy barrier for CH activation is 85.72 kcal/mol, corresponding to the initial alkane adsorption and hydrogen removal."
          [9] "The activation barrier for this step (process V + C2H6 ! TS11 in Fig. 7) is very high considering the other reaction paths we have presented so far."
          [10] "The activation barrier for hydrogen removal is substantially smaller than that for CH activation."
          [11] "The activation barrier for CH activation is directly related to the large endothermicity of the CH activation step (DE = 51.40 kcal/mol)."

[1] "Similar to the carbenium mechanism, the alkyl mechanism could be at play regardless of the specific structure of active Ga species, on which propane is initially activated by the metal cation to form the alkyl gallium intermediate, followed by the Î²-elimination and the desorption of propylene and H2."

          [2] "The modifying cations play key roles in dehydrogenation of paraffins [25,1416], whereas Brnsted acid protons catalyze the oligomerization of the olefins thus produced and possibly their subsequent aromatization."
          [3] "The initial step of CH activation is the oxidative addition of an alkane molecule to the Ga+ cation, which proceeds via an indirect heterolytic mechanism involving the basic oxygen atoms of the zeolite lattice."

          [6] "The mechanism of the initial activation of the hydrocarbon molecule on dihydrido-gallyl ion is very similar to that suggested for the heterolytic dissociation of ethane on Ga Zd."
          [7] "The calculated activation energy for this elementary step (193 kJ/mol) is significantly higher than that (158 kJ/mol) reported previously [17] for GaH2+ species stabilized in a fully optimized 3T cluster."
          [8] "The activation energy for this process was 257 kJ/mol, in an excellent agreement with the previously reported values of 258 kJ/mol [22] and 254 kJ/mol [17]."

          [11] "The low energy of the d-orbitals of Ga+ and its occupied s-orbital that make them unable to donate or accept electrons,respectively, from the hydrocarbon result in a high barrier for the direct oxidative addition of ethane to the cation."
          [12] "Therefore,heterolytic splitting of the CH bond is much more favorable due to the polarization induced by the interaction of the hydrocarbon with the Ga...O Lewis acidbase pair."
          [13] "The resulting product easily rearranges to form [HGaC2H5]+, which decomposes via simultaneous desorption of H2 and C2H4, regenerating the initial Ga+ species."

          [18] "Bivalent GaH+2 species stabilized at the cation site with distantly separated framework Al sites exhibit significantly higher initial activity for ethane activation but much lower stability compared with Ga+ sites."

          [3] "This process is accompanied by some de-alumination of the zeolite framework to produce extraframework alumina, which also helps to explain the decrease in Brnsted acidity and increase in Lewis acidity."
          [4] "When hydrogen is the reducing agent, the decomposition of the binuclear oxidic species is partially reversed when hydrogen flow is replaced by inert gas, but when the reducing agent is propane the formation of isolated Ga(I) species is irreversible, probably because it is stabilized by alkyl groups bonded to gallium, that were seen to be formed and to be stable when propane flow is replaced by inert gas."

          [28] "A sequence of steps that corresponds essentially to reaction (19) has been analyzed by Frash and van Santen [24] in their theoreti- cal study of ethane activation on gallium-exchanged zeolites,with dihydridogallium ions as the active sites."
          [29] "In their scheme,the alkyl- hydridogallium species in reaction (19) decomposes to produce an alkene molecule and regenerate the dihydrido active site."
          [30] "Our results suggest that the decomposition of the alkylhydrido inter- mediate occurs by reactions (17) and (18) instead."

[1] "The beneficial effect of Ga on alkane aromatization rates and selectivity has been observed whether Ga ions are introduced by impregnation [16,26,28,29,33,35] or ion exchange techniques [15,18,22,23,32]."
          [2] "The addition of metal species to H-ZSM5 channels increase aromatic turnover rates and actually decrease cracking turnover rates (Fig. 3)."
          [3] "The initial rate of propene formation is much higher on Ga/H-ZSM5 and Zn/H-ZSM5 compared to H-ZSM5, but isotopic evidence from C3Hs/C3D 8 mixtures show that C-H bond activation rate depends weakly on the presence of Ga and Zn."
          [4] "Reactions over Na-ZSM5 confirm that C-H bond activation occurs predominantly on BrOnsted acid sites."
          [5] "Ga and Zn sites increase the rate of propene formation by removing H-atoms from acid sites that activate C-H bonds, allowing acid sites to turnover without the formation of cracking products."
          [6] "Ga and Zn act as 'portholes' and catalyze the recombinative desorption of H-atoms, formed from acid-catalyzed C-H bond cleavage, as all-hydrogen (He)."
          [7] "Adsorption-desorption steps,however, remain irreversible and not fully equi- librated even on Ga/H-ZSM5 and Zn/H- ZSM5."
          [8] "This H-atom disposal step remains the rate-determining step for each sequential dehy- drogenation reaction required to convert propane to aromatics."
          [9] "The presence of Ga species allows gas phase hydrogen to dissocia- tively adsorb and to effectively compete for surface sites, thus decreasing aromatic selectiv- ity."
          [10] "The addition of 13CO2 also increases the aromatics selectivity on H-ZSM5 (Fig. 24)."
          [11] "The introduction of alternate H-disposal path- ways, whether by using stoichiometric acceptors (CO, CO 2, or 0 2) or metal cations (Ga or Zn),removes the burden of hydrogen removal from other steps that form light alkanes and reduce aromatics selectivity."
          [12] "The addition of metal cations also increases the deuterium content in 'unreacted' propane (Fig. 18)."
          [13] "The addition of Ga and Zn increase the deuterium incorporation turnovers (Fig. 19)."
          [14] "Ga and Zn species increase the rate of both H-atom recombinative desorption and of H 2 dissociative adsorption during propane dehydrocyclodimerization reactions [22,28,29,42]."

[1] "The two basic mechanisms of CH activationcarbenium activation and alkyl activationare shown in Schemes 2 and 3,respectively."
          [2] "The carbenium activation involves CH bond po- larization in such a way that the carbon atom assumes a positive partial charge (Î´+) and hydrogen assumes a negative partial charge (Î´). Carbenium activation leads to the formation of alkoxide and metal hydride (MH) as an intermediate."
          [3] "In contrast, alkyl activation (Scheme 3) involves CH polarization in such a way that the carbon develops a negative (Î´) charge and the hydrogen develops a positive (Î´+) charge. Alkyl activation leads to the formation of a metal-alkyl (MCnH2n+1) and the Brnsted acid as intermediates."
          [4] "We investigated both mecha- nisms for all of the clusters discussed so far, and we discuss the results next."
          [5] "The first step involves the opening of the GaO coordination (A + C2H6 [B] D in Scheme 2) to form the activated intermediate D."
          [6] "The intermediate D further undergoes carbenium activation,as shown in Scheme 2 (D [E] F)."
          [7] "Carbenium activation is followed by the desorption of an alkene (ethene) from the alkoxide intermediate (F [I] J K + C2H4), leaving behind the Brnsted acid site."
          [8] "The intermediate D further undergoes alkyl activation as shown in Scheme 3 (D [E] F)."
          [9] "Alkyl activation is followed by desorption of an alkene (ethene) from the Gaalkyl intermediate (F [I] J K + C2H4), leaving behind the gallium dihydride species ([GaH2]+Z m)."
          [10] "The overall carbenium activation barrier (CEa) decreases rapidly with decreasing (more exothermic) heat of reduction (H 0 red)."
          [11] "A linear Polanyi relation [47] between the overall alkyl activa- tion barrier (AEa) and the heat of reduction (H 0 red) is seen."
          [12] "Although alkyl activation is much more facile than the carbenium activation, ethene removal from [HGaC2H5]+Z m intermediate faces a very high activation bar- rier of 60 kcal/mol."
          [13] "Thus, we conclude that this intermediate will be a spectator species while dominating the surface inter- mediates."
          [14] "This conclusion agrees well with recent experimental observations [26]."
          [15] "For the 4-membered ring cluster Z4a, the overall free energy of alkyl activation (AG0 a) is lower than the carbenium acti- vation: 47.6 and 42.7 kcal/mol (Table 3) for alkyl activation,compared with 61.1 and 58.4 kcal/mol (Table 2) for carbenium activation."
          [16] "Thus, alkene desorption is a rate-limiting step for the overall alkyl activation catalytic cycle irrespec- tive of the activity of the particular catalytic site."
          [17] "Recently, Pidko et al. [42] reported a novel one-step H2 and C2H4 de- sorption pathway from gallium alkyl intermediate."
          [18] "This path- way involves a cyclic transition state with an activation bar- rier of 53.5 kcal/mol."
          [19] "We also calculated an activation bar- rier of 54.6 kcal/mol using a single-framework substitution model of the active site as described previously [33]."
          [20] "Thus, this mechanism of decomposition should set a lower limit of about 55 kcal/mol for the apparent activation barrier."
          [21] "The free energies of carbenium activation (A + C2H6 E, CG0 a) for four differ- ent reaction paths are 85.4, 81.4, 92.3, and 81.7 kcal/mol."

          [30] "The ethene desorption barriers are 65.5 and 66.8 kcal/mol for this particular site."
          [31] "The stability of the bicationic gallium monohydride species in the S5a ring makes alkyl activation more difficult compared with that for Z4a."
          [32] "As expected, the free energy activation bar- riers (66.4, 61.9, 66.6, and 54.7 kcal/mol) are lower than those for carbenium activation."

          [37] "62 kcal/mol."
          [38] "The Z8a ring structure provides a less stable coordina- tion for the [GaH]2+ species, with lower resulting activation barriers for CH dissociation by the alkyl activation mecha- nism."
          [39] "We calculated the free energy activation barriers to be 42.5 and 37.7 kcal/mol."
          [40] "Ethene removal barriers of 63.3 and 64.1 kcal/mol would make this the rate-limiting step."
          [41] "For the least stable site, Z8b, the alkyl activation barriers (AG0 a) are 29.0 and 27.0 kcal/mol."
          [42] "The barriers for the forma- tion of the undercoordinated GaH species are relatively higher."
          [43] "The ethene desorption barriers are 65.5 and 66.8 kcal/mol for this particular site."
          [44] "Thus, alkene desorption is a rate-limiting step for the overall alkyl activation catalytic cycle irrespec- tive of the activity of the particular catalytic site."
          [45] "The first step involves the opening of the GaO coordination (A + C2H6 [B] D in Scheme 2) to form the activated intermediate D."
          [46] "Depending on the site geom- etry, the undercoordinated GaH (intermediate D), representing the activated catalytic site, may or may not be stable."
          [47] "The ethane molecule is adsorbed on to the electron-deficient, coor- dinately unsaturated GaH species."
          [48] "As was pointed out earlier,the CH bonds of the methyl group are strongly polarized and elongated."
          [49] "In general, we have observed that for carbenium activation, the methyl group adsorbs in an end-on fashion (in- termediate D in Scheme 2)."
          [50] "In contrast to end-on adsorbed complex for carbenium activation, for alkyl activation, we observed that the methyl group adsorbs in a sidewise fashion (intermediate D in Scheme 3)."
          [51] "In this activated intermediate, only two hydro- gen atoms and the carbon of the methyl group are closer to the undercoordinated Ga."
          [52] "On the opposite side of the Ga, the third hydrogen of the methyl group is closer to the framework oxy- gen."
          [53] "This CH bond of the methyl group is strongly polarized and elongated."
          [54] "Thus, the geometry of the intermediate D for alkyl activation is conducive for the formation of the Gaalkyl species and Brnsted acid site."
          [55] "Thus, to compare different carbenium activation paths, we define an activation energy term called the overall carbenium activation barrier (CEa)."
          [56] "This activation barrier represents the upper limit of the apparent activation barrier; the actual apparent ac- tivation barrier will depend on the surface coverage and hence on the reaction conditions, which can be determined via rig- orous kinetic simulation [29]."
          [57] "We calculated the free energy change for A + C2H6 E activation (CG0 a), which allowed us to compare the reaction rate along a certain reaction path and determine the rate-controlling step."
          [58] "For all active site struc- tures, energy parameters related to carbenium activation are listed in Table 2."
          [59] "Carbenium activation is followed by the desorption of an alkene (ethene) from the alkoxide intermediate (F [I] J K + C2H4), leaving behind the Brnsted acid site."
          [60] "However, a proton jump from one bridging oxygen to other is much more facile [62] compared with the other mecha- nistic steps."
          [61] "In the discussions on the hydrogen desorption step that fol- lows, we start with the Brnsted acid site on the same bridging oxygen (intermediate K) bearing the alkoxide intermediate, to be consistent with the reduction path of the [GaH]2+Z2 d site."
          [62] "The related energy parameters (ECEa, ECG0 a, ECEr, and ECG0 r ) for ethene desorption are listed in Table 2."
          [63] "As ex- pected, the activation barrier (ECEa) is fairly constant, vary- ing around 2535 kcal/mol."
          [64] "This mechanistic step is known as a structure-insensitive reaction in the sense that the activation barrier does not depend on the distance between the pair of the framework Al."
          [65] "In any case, starting from the alkoxide interme- diate, the free energy of activation for alkene desorption is well"
          [66] "below of that for carbenium activation and thus will be incon- sequential in determining the resulting apparent free energy of activation for the dehydrogenation reaction."
          [67] "For the Z4a ring, the undercoordinated Ga species [GaH]2+ lies in the plane with OAlO, in contrast to the more tetra- hedral coordination of the Ga for the other cluster structures."
          [68] "At the same time, the 4-member ring presents an exception to the end-on adsorbed complex observed for alkyl activa- tion."
          [69] "The steric repulsion of the walls surrounding the smaller ring could be a reason for the preferred sidewise adsorption of the ethane molecule."
          [70] "The overall free energies of carbe- nium activation (CG0 a) for the two paths for Z4a site are 61.1 and 58.5 kcal/mol."
          [71] "As discussed previously, for the carbenium activation mechanism, desorption of an alkene from alkoxide intermediate is much more facile with a ECG0 a of 24.7 and 26.8 kcal/mol."
          [72] "For each of the four reduction pathways for S5a, there is a distinct carbenium activation pathway."
          [73] "The stability of the active site in the monohydride form transpires into the higher activation energy for carbenium activation."
          [74] "The free energies of carbenium activation (A + C2H6 E, CG0 a) for four differ- ent reaction paths are 85.4, 81.4, 92.3, and 81.7 kcal/mol."
          [75] "The corresponding free energy barriers for ethene removal (F I in Scheme 2) are 20.0, 34.0, 21.6, and 29.6 kcal/mol."
          [76] "Again,note that ethene removal from alkoxide is very facile compared with the carbenium activation mechanism."
          [77] "The six-membered ring S6a provides the most stable coor- dination for the [GaH]2+ species."
          [78] "Correspondingly, the highest activation barrier for the carbenium activation is observed."
          [79] "As noted previously [33], due to the higher stability of the cat- alytic site S6a in the monohydride form, the undercoordinated [GaH]2+ species (B and D) are absent along the reaction path."
          [80] "The free energies of carbenium activation (CG0 a) for the two mechanistic paths (A + C2H6 E in Scheme 2) are 96.4 and 99.2 kcal/mol, with corresponding free energies of activation for ethene removal of (ECG0 a) of 27.1 and 22.6 kcal/mol."
          [81] "For the other six-membered ring structure S6b, we studied four distinct carbenium activation paths."
          [82] "The energetics of all four reaction pathways are very similar due to symmetry of the site S6b."
          [83] "Because site S6b is less stable (H 0 red less en- dothermic in Table 1) than S6a, the activation barriers for carbe- nium activation are lower."
          [84] "Free energies of carbenium activation (CG0 a) are 87.0, 89.1, 88.2, and 94.1 kcal/mol."
          [85] "As reported in Table 2, the free energies of activation for ethene desorption are about 28 kcal/mol for all four reaction paths."
          [86] "For the 8-membered ring Z8a, 3.6 kcal/mol heat of re- duction indicates the formation of the [GaH2]+Z m is slightly exothermic."
          [87] "The lower stability of the site Z8a leads to lower free energies of the carbenium activation (62.6 and 62.0 kcal/ mol for two pathways)."
          [88] "For the other 8-membered ring Z8b, the reduction is much more exothermic with H 0 red of 19.6 and 18.6 kcal/mol."

          [95] "In our previous publication on the role of frameworkAl pair sites, we specifically focused on the carbenium activation mechanism, expecting a very high activation barrier [33,41] for alkene desorption from Gaalkyl species."
          [96] "Frash and van Santen [41] showed that for the active site involving single- frameworkAl, alkyl activation has a lower activation barrier than carbenium activation."
          [97] "A similar trend is expected for the frameworkAl pair sites."

          [4] "We have also located an additional transition state (TS2) for the rotation of the tetrahedral [H2GaC2H5] species."
          [5] "The activation barrier for the alkyl desorption (process X ! TS4 in Fig. 3) was 61.67 kcal/mol, which is in close agreement with the previously reported [37] value of 60.7 kcal/mol."
          [6] "This high activationbarrierfor thealkylremovalstepshouldleadtovery low intrinsic reaction rate for the alkyl activation mechanism."
          [7] "We conclude from the previous literature, and from our extension here, that the single site, [HGaH]+, model does not represent the true mechanism for Ga-assisted dehydrogenation."
          [8] "We find the energy barrier for CH activation is 85.72 kcal/mol, corresponding to the initial alkane adsorption and hydrogen removal."
          [9] "The activation barrier for this step (process V + C2H6 ! TS11 in Fig. 7) is very high considering the other reaction paths we have presented so far."
          [10] "The activation barrier for hydrogen removal is substantially smaller than that for CH activation."
          [11] "The activation barrier for CH activation is directly related to the large endothermicity of the CH activation step (DE = 51.40 kcal/mol)."
