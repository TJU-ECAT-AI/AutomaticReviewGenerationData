In the alkyl mechanism of propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions on gallium-based catalysts, propane is initially activated by the metal cation to form an alkyl gallium intermediate. This is followed by Î²-elimination and the desorption of propylene and hydrogen. The mechanism is applicable to different structures of active Ga species, including Ga+, [GaH]+, and Ga2O22+. The CH activation step and the formation of an alkyl metal intermediate are proposed as the rate-determining step (RDS). In contrast to the carbenium mechanism, where Ga species facilitate the recombination of hydrogen adatoms to release hydrogen, the alkyl mechanism involves the activation of the CH bond in propane.

The alkyl mechanism in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions on gallium-based catalysts involves gallium acting as an acceptor of the alkyl group. The initial step of CH activation is the oxidative addition of an alkane molecule to the Ga+ cation, which proceeds via an indirect heterolytic mechanism involving the basic oxygen atoms of the zeolite lattice. The reaction mechanism is thought to consist of a complex scheme involving dehydrogenation, oligomerization, and ring closure steps. The modifying cations play key roles in dehydrogenation of paraffins, while Brnsted acid protons catalyze the oligomerization of the olefins produced and possibly their subsequent aromatization. The activation energy for this process is computed as 224 kJ/mol. The overall activation energy of the ethane dehydrogenation over the reduced dehydrogenated Ga/ZSM-5 zeolite is 233 kJ/mol. The mechanism of the initial activation of the hydrocarbon molecule on dihydrido-gallyl ion is very similar to that suggested for the heterolytic dissociation of ethane on Ga Zd. The calculated activation energy for this elementary step (193 kJ/mol) is significantly higher than that (158 kJ/mol) reported previously for GaH2+ species stabilized in a fully optimized 3T cluster. The activation energy for this process was 257 kJ/mol, in an excellent agreement with the previously reported values of 258 kJ/mol and 254 kJ/mol. The activation energy for this process [IV VI; Fig. 4, route (b)] is equal to 104 kJ/mol. The activation energies and enthalpies for both the ho- molytic and heterolytic CH bond cleavage on Ga+ ion in Zs clusters are very similar to those calculated for the distantly separated Al atoms. The fraction of cation sites containing two aluminum atoms in the next-nearest positions is small; for instance, in a zeolite with an Si:Al ratio of 25, it does not exceed 30%. The reactivity of either Ga+ or GaH2+ in hydrocarbon activation exhibits very slight dependence on the distribution of aluminum in zeolite. The apparent activation barrier for this process estimated within the model used is equal to 233 kJ/mol. The apparent activation barrier estimated for ethane dehydrogenation over Ga2O3/HZSM-5 is significantly lower (163 kJ/mol) than this value. Although the catalytic reaction can also occur over GaH2+ and GaH+2 sites, these paths are not favored. The reactivity of GaH+2 ions is strongly dependent on the distance between the stabilizing aluminum-occupied oxygen tetrahedra. In cases of greater AlAl distances, the stability of the GaH+2 species is very low, and it decomposes to Ga+ and a Brnsted acid site, whereas when Al atoms are located more closely, the charge-compensating GaH+2 ions are the most stable and exhibit the lowest activity for the initial CH bond cleavage reaction. The reaction mechanism of ethane dehydrogenation was investigated using DFT calculations for various reduced-gallium sites in Ga/ZSM-5. The probable catalytic cycle starts with the heterolytic CH bond cleavage involving exchanged univalent gallium cation and a basic oxygen atom of the zeolite framework. The low energy of the d-orbitals of Ga+ and its occupied s-orbital that make them unable to donate or accept electrons,respectively, from the hydrocarbon result in a high barrier for the direct oxidative addition of ethane to the cation. Therefore,heterolytic splitting of the CH bond is much more favorable due to the polarization induced by the interaction of the hydrocarbon with the Ga...O Lewis acidbase pair. The resulting product easily rearranges to form [HGaC2H5]+, which decomposes via simultaneous desorption of H2 and C2H4, regenerating the initial Ga+ species. The overall activation barrier for C2H6 dehydrogenation over Ga+Zsites is equal to 233 kJ/mol. Hydrogenated gallium species (GaH2+Zand ZGaH+2Z) are less likely active sites. Decomposition of the dihydrido-gallyl ions, resulting in formation of univalent gallium ions during the catalytic cycle, is significantly favored over regeneration of GaH2+ sites. In addition, the estimated overall activation barrier for the considered catalytic reaction is higher (by 58 kJ/mol) for GaH2+ sites than for Ga+ sites. Bivalent GaH+2 species stabilized at the cation site with distantly separated framework Al sites exhibit significantly higher initial activity for ethane activation but much lower stability compared with Ga+ sites. However, initial heterolytic cleavage of the CH bond results in formation of [HGaC2H5]+ ions that preferentially follow the reaction path, again leading to univalent gallium cations. On the other hand, GaH+2 ions charge-compensating two proximate framework aluminum ions are the most stable cationic species; however, initial activation of the CH bond over these sites is strongly disfavored both thermodynamically and kinetically. In contrast, the reactivity of univalent gallium species exchanged in zeolite depends only slightly on the relative position of zeolitic anionic sites ([AlO2]units). The alkyl mechanism is more favorable than the carbenium mechanism, which involves the formation of a carbenium ion attached to the basic oxygen of the zeolite and a hydride ion bonded to gallium. The activation energy for the alkyl mechanism is 193 kJ/mol, which is significantly higher than the 158 kJ/mol reported for the GaH2+ species stabilized in a fully optimized 3T cluster. However, the overall activation barrier for the alkyl mechanism is 233 kJ/mol, which is lower than the activation energy for the carbenium mechanism. The CH activation step is proposed as the rate-determining step (RDS) because it involves the breaking of a strong C-H bond. The alkyl mechanism applies to different Ga species structures, with Ga+ being the most favorable, followed by GaH2+ and GaH+2. The reactivity of GaH+2 ions is strongly dependent on the distance between the stabilizing aluminum-occupied oxygen tetrahedra. In cases of greater AlAl distances, the stability of the GaH+2 species is very low, and it decomposes to Ga+ and a Brnsted acid site, whereas when Al atoms are located more closely, the charge-compensating GaH+2 ions are the most stable and exhibit the lowest activity for the initial CH bond cleavage reaction.

The alkyl mechanism in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions on gallium-based catalysts involves a sequence of steps starting with the activation of propane by a gallium species. The initial step is the formation of an alkyl-gallium intermediate, which then decomposes to produce an alkene molecule and regenerate the active site. This mechanism has been analyzed theoretically by Frash and van Santen for ethane activation on gallium-exchanged zeolites, with dihydridogallium ions as the active sites. However, our results suggest that the decomposition of the alkylhydrido intermediate occurs by reactions (17) and (18) instead of the proposed regeneration of the dihydrido active site. The alkyl mechanism applies to different Ga species structures, including isolated Ga(I) species and dihydridogallium ions, depending on the reaction conditions. Addition of hydrogen to the reaction medium suppresses the aromatization reaction, possibly by reversing reactions such as (17) and other dehydrogenation steps involved in aromatization. On the other hand, it strongly promotes the formation of methane and ethane. However, there is competition between hydrogen and the hydrocarbon for the active sites. A Langmuir-Hinshelwood type of mechanism, such as represented by reaction (20), is a likely possibility for the hydrogenolysis reactions. It should be reminded that the isolated gallium species are formed from binuclear gallium oxidic species during reduction, so pairs of reduced species are likely to be in close proximity in the reduced form of the catalyst. The reactions proposed in this article refer to the activation of the catalysts at the beginning of the reaction and to propane activation. In subsequent steps, the zeolite Brnsted acid sites are responsible for oligomerization, cyclization, and hydride transfer reactions involved in the aromatization process, while reduced gallium species are responsible for dehydrogenation reactions.

The alkyl mechanism in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions on gallium-based catalysts involves the activation of propane by hydride abstraction from the reacting alkane by adsorbed carbenium ions (bimolecular) or by addition of protons to alkenes to form a carbenium ion (monomolecular). The addition of Ga ions to H-ZSM5 channels increases the rate of propene formation by removing H-atoms from acid sites that activate C-H bonds, allowing acid sites to turnover without the formation of cracking products. Ga and Zn act as 'portholes' and catalyze the recombinative desorption of H-atoms, formed from acid-catalyzed C-H bond cleavage, as all-hydrogen (H2). This mechanism applies to different Ga species structures, as the beneficial effect of Ga on alkane aromatization rates and selectivity has been observed whether Ga ions are introduced by impregnation or ion exchange techniques. Compared to the carbenium mechanism, the alkyl mechanism involves the activation of propane by hydride abstraction or proton addition, rather than the direct protonation of propane to form carbonium ions. The CH activation step is proposed as the rate-determining step (RDS) because it involves the breaking of a strong C-H bond, which is energetically unfavorable. Reactions over Na-ZSM5 confirm that C-H bond activation occurs predominantly on BrOnsted acid sites, supporting the alkyl mechanism.

The alkyl mechanism in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions on gallium-based catalysts involves the initial activation of propane, where the carbon atom develops a negative charge and the hydrogen develops a positive charge. This leads to the formation of a metal-alkyl (MCnH2n+1) and a Brnsted acid as intermediates. The activated intermediate D undergoes alkyl activation, resulting in the formation of a Gaalkyl species and a Brnsted acid site. Alkyl activation is followed by the desorption of an alkene (ethene) from the Gaalkyl intermediate, leaving behind the gallium dihydride species ([GaH2]+Z m). The carbenium mechanism, on the other hand, involves the polarization of the CH bond in such a way that the carbon atom assumes a positive partial charge and hydrogen assumes a negative partial charge. This leads to the formation of alkoxide and metal hydride (MH) as intermediates. The CH activation step is proposed as the rate-determining step (RDS) because it involves the breaking of a strong C-H bond, which requires a significant amount of energy. The alkyl mechanism applies to different Ga species structures, with the overall free energy of alkyl activation being lower than that of carbenium activation for the 4-membered ring cluster Z4a. However, alkene desorption is a rate-limiting step for the overall alkyl activation catalytic cycle, regardless of the activity of the particular catalytic site. A novel one-step H2 and C2H4 desorption pathway from gallium alkyl intermediate has been reported, involving a cyclic transition state with an activation barrier of 53.5 kcal/mol. This mechanism of decomposition sets a lower limit of about 55 kcal/mol for the apparent activation barrier.

The alkyl mechanism in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions on gallium-based catalysts involves the initial activation of the CH bond by the [HGaH]+ species, forming a tetrahedral [H2GaC2H5] intermediate. This intermediate then undergoes rotation around the GaO20 coordination, followed by the removal of a hydrogen molecule (H2) and the desorption of the alkyl species. The activation barrier for the initial CH activation step is proposed as the rate-determining step (RDS) because at higher temperatures, this step becomes the slowest part of the reaction, with a calculated activation barrier of 3940 kcal/mol, which closely matches the experimental value of 39 kcal/mol. However, further calculations have shown that the activation barrier for CH activation is actually higher, at 48.66 kcal/mol, and the barrier for alkyl desorption is also quite high, at 61.67 kcal/mol, leading to a very low intrinsic reaction rate for the alkyl activation mechanism. This has led to the conclusion that the single-site [HGaH]+ model does not accurately represent the true mechanism for Ga-assisted dehydrogenation. In contrast, the carbenium mechanism, which involves the activation of the CH bond and the formation of an alkoxide intermediate, followed by alkene desorption and hydrogen removal, has been found to have a lower activation barrier for CH activation (85.72 kcal/mol) and a much lower barrier for hydrogen removal (15.49 kcal/mol). The higher activation barrier for CH activation in the carbenium mechanism is directly related to the endothermicity of the CH activation step, which is 51.40 kcal/mol.

The alkyl mechanism applies to different Ga species structures, including isolated Ga(I) species and dihydridogallium ions, depending on the reaction conditions. Addition of hydrogen to the reaction medium suppresses the aromatization reaction, possibly by reversing reactions such as (17) and other dehydrogenation steps involved in aromatization. On the other hand, it strongly promotes the formation of methane and ethane. However, there is competition between hydrogen and the hydrocarbon for the active sites. A Langmuir-Hinshelwood type of mechanism, such as represented by reaction (20), is a likely possibility for the hydrogenolysis reactions. It should be reminded that the isolated gallium species are formed from binuclear gallium oxidic species during reduction, so pairs of reduced species are likely to be in close proximity in the reduced form of the catalyst. The reactions proposed in this article refer to the activation of the catalysts at the beginning of the reaction and to propane activation. In subsequent steps, the zeolite Brnsted acid sites are responsible for oligomerization, cyclization, and hydride transfer reactions involved in the aromatization process, while reduced gallium species are responsible for dehydrogenation reactions.

The alkyl mechanism in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions on gallium-based catalysts involves the activation of propane by hydride abstraction from the reacting alkane by adsorbed carbenium ions (bimolecular) or by addition of protons to alkenes to form a carbenium ion (monomolecular). The addition of Ga ions to H-ZSM5 channels increases the rate of propene formation by removing H-atoms from acid sites that activate C-H bonds, allowing acid sites to turnover without the formation of cracking products. Ga and Zn act as 'portholes' and catalyze the recombinative desorption of H-atoms, formed from acid-catalyzed C-H bond cleavage, as all-hydrogen (H2). This mechanism applies to different Ga species structures, as the beneficial effect of Ga on alkane aromatization rates and selectivity has been observed whether Ga ions are introduced by impregnation or ion exchange techniques. Compared to the carbenium mechanism, the alkyl mechanism involves the activation of propane by hydride abstraction or proton addition, rather than the direct protonation of propane to form carbonium ions. The CH activation step is proposed as the rate-determining step (RDS) because it involves the breaking of a strong C-H bond, which is energetically unfavorable. Reactions over Na-ZSM5 confirm that C-H bond activation occurs predominantly on BrOnsted acid sites, supporting the alkyl mechanism.

The alkyl mechanism in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions on gallium-based catalysts involves the initial activation of propane, where the carbon atom develops a negative charge and the hydrogen develops a positive charge. This leads to the formation of a metal-alkyl (MCnH2n+1) and a Brnsted acid as intermediates. The activated intermediate D undergoes alkyl activation, resulting in the formation of a Gaalkyl species and a Brnsted acid site. Alkyl activation is followed by the desorption of an alkene (ethene) from the Gaalkyl intermediate, leaving behind the gallium dihydride species ([GaH2]+Z m). The carbenium mechanism, on the other hand, involves the polarization of the CH bond in such a way that the carbon atom assumes a positive partial charge and hydrogen assumes a negative partial charge. This leads to the formation of alkoxide and metal hydride (MH) as intermediates. The CH activation step is proposed as the rate-determining step (RDS) because it involves the breaking of a strong C-H bond, which requires a significant amount of energy. The alkyl mechanism applies to different Ga species structures, with the overall free energy of alkyl activation being lower than that of carbenium activation for the 4-membered ring cluster Z4a. However, alkene desorption is a rate-limiting step for the overall alkyl activation catalytic cycle, regardless of the activity of the particular catalytic site. A novel one-step H2 and C2H4 desorption pathway from gallium alkyl intermediate has been reported, involving a cyclic transition state with an activation barrier of 53.5 kcal/mol. This mechanism of decomposition sets a lower limit of about 55 kcal/mol for the apparent activation barrier.

The alkyl mechanism in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions on gallium-based catalysts involves the initial activation of the CH bond by the [HGaH]+ species, forming a tetrahedral [H2GaC2H5] intermediate. This intermediate then undergoes rotation around the GaO20 coordination, followed by the removal of a hydrogen molecule (H2) and the desorption of the alkyl species. The activation barrier for the initial CH activation step is proposed as the rate-determining step (RDS) because at higher temperatures, this step becomes the slowest part of the reaction, with a calculated activation barrier of 3940 kcal/mol, which closely matches the experimental value of 39 kcal/mol. However, further calculations have shown that the activation barrier for CH activation is actually higher, at 48.66 kcal/mol, and the barrier for alkyl desorption is also quite high, at 61.67 kcal/mol, leading to a very low intrinsic reaction rate for the alkyl activation mechanism. This has led to the conclusion that the single-site [HGaH]+ model does not accurately represent the true mechanism for Ga-assisted dehydrogenation. In contrast, the carbenium mechanism, which involves the activation of the CH bond and the formation of an alkoxide intermediate, followed by alkene desorption and hydrogen removal, has been found to have a lower activation barrier for CH activation (85.72 kcal/mol) and a much lower barrier for hydrogen removal (15.49 kcal/mol). The higher activation barrier for CH activation in the carbenium mechanism is directly related to the endothermicity of the CH activation step, which is 51.40 kcal/mol.

In the alkyl mechanism of propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions on gallium-based catalysts, propane is initially activated by the metal cation to form an alkyl gallium intermediate. This is followed by Î²-elimination and the desorption of propylene and hydrogen. The mechanism is applicable to different structures of active Ga species, including Ga+, [GaH]+, and Ga2O22+. The CH activation step and the formation of an alkyl metal intermediate are proposed as the rate-determining step (RDS). In contrast to the carbenium mechanism, where Ga species facilitate the recombination of hydrogen adatoms to release hydrogen, the alkyl mechanism involves the activation of the CH bond in propane.

The alkyl mechanism in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions on gallium-based catalysts involves gallium acting as an acceptor of the alkyl group. The initial step of CH activation is the oxidative addition of an alkane molecule to the Ga+ cation, which proceeds via an indirect heterolytic mechanism involving the basic oxygen atoms of the zeolite lattice. The reaction mechanism is thought to consist of a complex scheme involving dehydrogenation, oligomerization, and ring closure steps. The modifying cations play key roles in dehydrogenation of paraffins, while Brnsted acid protons catalyze the oligomerization of the olefins produced and possibly their subsequent aromatization. The activation energy for this process is computed as 224 kJ/mol. The overall activation energy of the ethane dehydrogenation over the reduced dehydrogenated Ga/ZSM-5 zeolite is 233 kJ/mol. The mechanism of the initial activation of the hydrocarbon molecule on dihydrido-gallyl ion is very similar to that suggested for the heterolytic dissociation of ethane on Ga Zd. The calculated activation energy for this elementary step (193 kJ/mol) is significantly higher than that (158 kJ/mol) reported previously for GaH2+ species stabilized in a fully optimized 3T cluster. The activation energy for this process was 257 kJ/mol, in an excellent agreement with the previously reported values of 258 kJ/mol and 254 kJ/mol. The activation energy for this process [IV VI; Fig. 4, route (b)] is equal to 104 kJ/mol. The activation energies and enthalpies for both the ho- molytic and heterolytic CH bond cleavage on Ga+ ion in Zs clusters are very similar to those calculated for the distantly separated Al atoms. The fraction of cation sites containing two aluminum atoms in the next-nearest positions is small; for instance, in a zeolite with an Si:Al ratio of 25, it does not exceed 30%. The reactivity of either Ga+ or GaH2+ in hydrocarbon activation exhibits very slight dependence on the distribution of aluminum in zeolite. The apparent activation barrier for this process estimated within the model used is equal to 233 kJ/mol. The apparent activation barrier estimated for ethane dehydrogenation over Ga2O3/HZSM-5 is significantly lower (163 kJ/mol) than this value. Although the catalytic reaction can also occur over GaH2+ and GaH+2 sites, these paths are not favored. The reactivity of GaH+2 ions is strongly dependent on the distance between the stabilizing aluminum-occupied oxygen tetrahedra. In cases of greater AlAl distances, the stability of the GaH+2 species is very low, and it decomposes to Ga+ and a Brnsted acid site, whereas when Al atoms are located more closely, the charge-compensating GaH+2 ions are the most stable and exhibit the lowest activity for the initial CH bond cleavage reaction. The reaction mechanism of ethane dehydrogenation was investigated using DFT calculations for various reduced-gallium sites in Ga/ZSM-5. The probable catalytic cycle starts with the heterolytic CH bond cleavage involving exchanged univalent gallium cation and a basic oxygen atom of the zeolite framework. The low energy of the d-orbitals of Ga+ and its occupied s-orbital that make them unable to donate or accept electrons,respectively, from the hydrocarbon result in a high barrier for the direct oxidative addition of ethane to the cation. Therefore,heterolytic splitting of the CH bond is much more favorable due to the polarization induced by the interaction of the hydrocarbon with the Ga...O Lewis acidbase pair. The resulting product easily rearranges to form [HGaC2H5]+, which decomposes via simultaneous desorption of H2 and C2H4, regenerating the initial Ga+ species. The overall activation barrier for C2H6 dehydrogenation over Ga+Zsites is equal to 233 kJ/mol. Hydrogenated gallium species (GaH2+Zand ZGaH+2Z) are less likely active sites. Decomposition of the dihydrido-gallyl ions, resulting in formation of univalent gallium ions during the catalytic cycle, is significantly favored over regeneration of GaH2+ sites. In addition, the estimated overall activation barrier for the considered catalytic reaction is higher (by 58 kJ/mol) for GaH2+ sites than for Ga+ sites. Bivalent GaH+2 species stabilized at the cation site with distantly separated framework Al sites exhibit significantly higher initial activity for ethane activation but much lower stability compared with Ga+ sites. However, initial heterolytic cleavage of the CH bond results in formation of [HGaC2H5]+ ions that preferentially follow the reaction path, again leading to univalent gallium cations. On the other hand, GaH+2 ions charge-compensating two proximate framework aluminum ions are the most stable cationic species; however, initial activation of the CH bond over these sites is strongly disfavored both thermodynamically and kinetically. In contrast, the reactivity of univalent gallium species exchanged in zeolite depends only slightly on the relative position of zeolitic anionic sites ([AlO2]units). The alkyl mechanism is more favorable than the carbenium mechanism, which involves the formation of a carbenium ion attached to the basic oxygen of the zeolite and a hydride ion bonded to gallium. The activation energy for the alkyl mechanism is 193 kJ/mol, which is significantly higher than the 158 kJ/mol reported for the GaH2+ species stabilized in a fully optimized 3T cluster. However, the overall activation barrier for the alkyl mechanism is 233 kJ/mol, which is lower than the activation energy for the carbenium mechanism. The CH activation step is proposed as the rate-determining step (RDS) because it involves the breaking of a strong C-H bond.

The alkyl mechanism in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions on gallium-based catalysts involves a sequence of steps starting with the activation of propane by a gallium species. The initial step is the formation of an alkyl-gallium intermediate, which then decomposes to produce an alkene molecule and regenerate the active site. This mechanism has been analyzed theoretically by Frash and van Santen for ethane activation on gallium-exchanged zeolites, with dihydridogallium ions as the active sites.

The reaction mechanism is thought to consist of a complex scheme involving dehydrogenation, oligomerization, and ring closure steps. The modifying cations play key roles in dehydrogenation of paraffins, while Brnsted acid protons catalyze the oligomerization of the olefins produced and possibly their subsequent aromatization. The activation energy for this process is computed as 224 kJ/mol. The overall activation energy of the ethane dehydrogenation over the reduced dehydrogenated Ga/ZSM-5 zeolite is 233 kJ/mol. The mechanism of the initial activation of the hydrocarbon molecule on dihydrido-gallyl ion is very similar to that suggested for the heterolytic dissociation of ethane on Ga Zd. The calculated activation energy for this elementary step (193 kJ/mol) is significantly higher than that (158 kJ/mol) reported previously for GaH2+ species stabilized in a fully optimized 3T cluster. The activation energy for this process was 257 kJ/mol, in an excellent agreement with the previously reported values of 258 kJ/mol and 254 kJ/mol. The activation energy for this process [IV VI; Fig. 4, route (b)] is equal to 104 kJ/mol. The activation energies and enthalpies for both the ho- molytic and heterolytic CH bond cleavage on Ga+ ion in Zs clusters are very similar to those calculated for the distantly separated Al atoms. The fraction of cation sites containing two aluminum atoms in the next-nearest positions is small; for instance, in a zeolite with an Si:Al ratio of 25, it does not exceed 30%. The reactivity of either Ga+ or GaH2+ in hydrocarbon activation exhibits very slight dependence on the distribution of aluminum in zeolite. The apparent activation barrier for this process estimated within the model used is equal to 233 kJ/mol. The apparent activation barrier estimated for ethane dehydrogenation over Ga2O3/HZSM-5 is significantly lower (163 kJ/mol) than this value. Although the catalytic reaction can also occur over GaH2+ and GaH+2 sites, these paths are not favored. The reactivity of GaH+2 ions is strongly dependent on the distance between the stabilizing aluminum-occupied oxygen tetrahedra. In cases of greater AlAl distances, the stability of the GaH+2 species is very low, and it decomposes to Ga+ and a Brnsted acid site, whereas when Al atoms are located more closely, the charge-compensating GaH+2 ions are the most stable and exhibit the lowest activity for the initial CH bond cleavage reaction. The reaction mechanism of ethane dehydrogenation was investigated using DFT calculations for various reduced-gallium sites in Ga/ZSM-5. The probable catalytic cycle starts with the heterolytic CH bond cleavage involving exchanged univalent gallium cation and a basic oxygen atom of the zeolite framework. The low energy of the d-orbitals of Ga+ and its occupied s-orbital that make them unable to donate or accept electrons,respectively, from the hydrocarbon result in a high barrier for the direct oxidative addition of ethane to the cation. Therefore,heterolytic splitting of the CH bond is much more favorable due to the polarization induced by the interaction of the hydrocarbon with the Ga...O Lewis acidbase pair. The resulting product easily rearranges to form [HGaC2H5]+, which decomposes via simultaneous desorption of H2 and C2H4, regenerating the initial Ga+ species. The overall activation barrier for C2H6 dehydrogenation over Ga+Zsites is equal to 233 kJ/mol. Hydrogenated gallium species (GaH2+Zand ZGaH+2Z) are less likely active sites. Decomposition of the dihydrido-gallyl ions, resulting in formation of univalent gallium ions during the catalytic cycle, is significantly favored over regeneration of GaH2+ sites. In addition, the estimated overall activation barrier for the considered catalytic reaction is higher (by 58 kJ/mol) for GaH2+ sites than for Ga+ sites. Bivalent GaH+2 species stabilized at the cation site with distantly separated framework Al sites exhibit significantly higher initial activity for ethane activation but much lower stability compared with Ga+ sites. However, initial heterolytic cleavage of the CH bond results in formation of [HGaC2H5]+ ions that preferentially follow the reaction path, again leading to univalent gallium cations. On the other hand, GaH+2 ions charge-compensating two proximate framework aluminum ions are the most stable cationic species; however, initial activation of the CH bond over these sites is strongly disfavored both thermodynamically and kinetically. In contrast, the reactivity of univalent gallium species exchanged in zeolite depends only slightly on the relative position of zeolitic anionic sites ([AlO2]units). The alkyl mechanism is more favorable than the carbenium mechanism, which involves the formation of a carbenium ion attached to the basic oxygen of the zeolite and a hydride ion bonded to gallium. The activation energy for the alkyl mechanism is 193 kJ/mol, which is significantly higher than the 158 kJ/mol reported for the GaH2+ species stabilized in a fully optimized 3T cluster. However, the overall activation barrier for the alkyl mechanism is 233 kJ/mol, which is lower than the activation energy for the carbenium mechanism. The CH activation step is proposed as the rate-determining step (RDS) because it involves the breaking of a strong C-H bond. The alkyl mechanism applies to different Ga species structures, with Ga+ being the most favorable, followed by GaH2+ and GaH+2. The reactivity of GaH+2 ions is strongly dependent on the distance between the stabilizing aluminum-occupied oxygen tetrahedra. In cases of greater AlAl distances, the stability of the GaH+2 species is very low, and it decomposes to Ga+ and a Brnsted acid site, whereas when Al atoms are located more closely, the charge-compensating GaH+2 ions are the most stable and exhibit the lowest activity for the initial CH bond cleavage reaction.

The alkyl mechanism in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions on gallium-based catalysts involves a sequence of steps starting with the activation of propane by a gallium species. The initial step is the formation of an alkyl-gallium intermediate, which then decomposes to produce an alkene molecule and regenerate the active site. This mechanism has been analyzed theoretically by Frash and van Santen for ethane activation on gallium-exchanged zeolites, with dihydridogallium ions as the active sites. However, our results suggest that the decomposition of the alkylhydrido intermediate occurs by reactions (17) and (18) instead of the proposed regeneration of the dihydrido active site. The alkyl mechanism applies to different Ga species structures, including isolated Ga(I) species and dihydridogallium ions, depending on the reaction conditions. Addition of hydrogen to the reaction medium suppresses the aromatization reaction, possibly by reversing reactions such as (17) and other dehydrogenation steps involved in aromatization. On the other hand, it strongly promotes the formation of methane and ethane. However, there is competition between hydrogen and the hydrocarbon for the active sites. A Langmuir-Hinshelwood type of mechanism, such as represented by reaction (20), is a likely possibility for the hydrogenolysis reactions. It should be reminded that the isolated gallium species are formed from binuclear gallium oxidic species during reduction, so pairs of reduced species are likely to be in close proximity in the reduced form of the catalyst. The reactions proposed in this article refer to the activation of the catalysts at the beginning of the reaction and to propane activation. In subsequent steps, the zeolite Brnsted acid sites are responsible for oligomerization, cyclization, and hydride transfer reactions involved in the aromatization process, while reduced gallium species are responsible for dehydrogenation reactions.

The alkyl mechanism in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions on gallium-based catalysts involves the activation of propane by hydride abstraction from the reacting alkane by adsorbed carbenium ions (bimolecular) or by addition of protons to alkenes to form a carbenium ion (monomolecular). The addition of Ga ions to H-ZSM5 channels increases the rate of propene formation by removing H-atoms from acid sites that activate C-H bonds, allowing acid sites to turnover without the formation of cracking products. Ga and Zn act as 'portholes' and catalyze the recombinative desorption of H-atoms, formed from acid-catalyzed C-H bond cleavage, as all-hydrogen (H2). This mechanism applies to different Ga species structures, as the beneficial effect of Ga on alkane aromatization rates and selectivity has been observed whether Ga ions are introduced by impregnation or ion exchange techniques. Compared to the carbenium mechanism, the alkyl mechanism involves the activation of propane by hydride abstraction or proton addition, rather than the direct protonation of propane to form carbonium ions. The CH activation step is proposed as the rate-determining step (RDS) because it involves the breaking of a strong C-H bond, which is energetically unfavorable. Reactions over Na-ZSM5 confirm that C-H bond activation occurs predominantly on BrOnsted acid sites, supporting the alkyl mechanism.

The alkyl mechanism in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions on gallium-based catalysts involves the initial activation of propane, where the carbon atom develops a negative charge and the hydrogen develops a positive charge. This leads to the formation of a metal-alkyl (MCnH2n+1) and a Brnsted acid as intermediates. The activated intermediate D undergoes alkyl activation, resulting in the formation of a Gaalkyl species and a Brnsted acid site. Alkyl activation is followed by the desorption of an alkene (ethene) from the Gaalkyl intermediate, leaving behind the gallium dihydride species ([GaH2]+Z m). The carbenium mechanism, on the other hand, involves the polarization of the CH bond in such a way that the carbon atom assumes a positive partial charge and hydrogen assumes a negative partial charge. This leads to the formation of alkoxide and metal hydride (MH) as intermediates. The CH activation step is proposed as the rate-determining step (RDS) because it involves the breaking of a strong C-H bond, which requires a significant amount of energy. The alkyl mechanism applies to different Ga species structures, with the overall free energy of alkyl activation being lower than that of carbenium activation for the 4-membered ring cluster Z4a. However, alkene desorption is a rate-limiting step for the overall alkyl activation catalytic cycle, regardless of the activity of the particular catalytic site. A novel one-step H2 and C2H4 desorption pathway from gallium alkyl intermediate has been reported, involving a cyclic transition state with an activation barrier of 53.5 kcal/mol. This mechanism of decomposition sets a lower limit of about 55 kcal/mol for the apparent activation barrier.

The alkyl mechanism in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions on gallium-based catalysts involves the initial activation of the CH bond by the [HGaH]+ species, forming a tetrahedral [H2GaC2H5] intermediate. This intermediate then undergoes rotation around the GaO20 coordination, followed by the removal of a hydrogen molecule (H2) and the desorption of the alkyl species. The activation barrier for the initial CH activation step is proposed as the rate-determining step (RDS) because at higher temperatures, this step becomes the slowest part of the reaction, with a calculated activation barrier of 3940 kcal/mol, which closely matches the experimental value of 39 kcal/mol. However, further calculations have shown that the activation barrier for CH activation is actually higher, at 48.66 kcal/mol, and the barrier for alkyl desorption is also quite high, at 61.67 kcal/mol, leading to a very low intrinsic reaction rate for the alkyl activation mechanism. This has led to the conclusion that the single-site [HGaH]+ model does not accurately represent the true mechanism for Ga-assisted dehydrogenation. In contrast, the carbenium mechanism, which involves the activation of the CH bond and the formation of an alkoxide intermediate, followed by alkene desorption and hydrogen removal, has been found to have a lower activation barrier for CH activation (85.72 kcal/mol) and a much lower barrier for hydrogen removal (15.49 kcal/mol). The higher activation barrier for CH activation in the carbenium mechanism is directly related to the endothermicity of the CH activation step, which is 51.40 kcal/mol.

In the alkyl mechanism of propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions on gallium-based catalysts, propane is initially activated by the metal cation to form an alkyl gallium intermediate. This is followed by Î²-elimination and the desorption of propylene and hydrogen. The mechanism is applicable to different structures of active Ga species, including Ga+, [GaH]+, and Ga2O22+. The CH activation step and the formation of an alkyl metal intermediate are proposed as the rate-determining step (RDS). In contrast to the carbenium mechanism, where Ga species facilitate the recombination of hydrogen adatoms to release hydrogen, the alkyl mechanism involves the activation of the CH bond in propane.

It should be reminded that the isolated gallium species are formed from binuclear gallium oxidic species during reduction, so pairs of reduced species are likely to be in close proximity in the reduced form of the catalyst. The reactions proposed in this article refer to the activation of the catalysts at the beginning of the reaction and to propane activation. In subsequent steps, the zeolite Brnsted acid sites are responsible for oligomerization, cyclization, and hydride transfer reactions involved in the aromatization process, while reduced gallium species are responsible for dehydrogenation reactions.

The alkyl mechanism in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions on gallium-based catalysts involves the activation of propane by hydride abstraction from the reacting alkane by adsorbed carbenium ions (bimolecular) or by addition of protons to alkenes to form a carbenium ion (monomolecular). The addition of Ga ions to H-ZSM5 channels increases the rate of propene formation by removing H-atoms from acid sites that activate C-H bonds, allowing acid sites to turnover without the formation of cracking products. Ga and Zn act as 'portholes' and catalyze the recombinative desorption of H-atoms, formed from acid-catalyzed C-H bond cleavage, as all-hydrogen (H2). This mechanism applies to different Ga species structures, as the beneficial effect of Ga on alkane aromatization rates and selectivity has been observed whether Ga ions are introduced by impregnation or ion exchange techniques. Compared to the carbenium mechanism, the alkyl mechanism involves the activation of propane by hydride abstraction or proton addition, rather than the direct protonation of propane to form carbonium ions. The CH activation step is proposed as the rate-determining step (RDS) because it involves the breaking of a strong C-H bond, which is energetically unfavorable. Reactions over Na-ZSM5 confirm that C-H bond activation occurs predominantly on BrOnsted acid sites, supporting the alkyl mechanism.

The alkyl mechanism in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions on gallium-based catalysts involves the initial activation of propane, where the carbon atom develops a negative charge and the hydrogen develops a positive charge. This leads to the formation of a metal-alkyl (MCnH2n+1) and a Brnsted acid as intermediates. The activated intermediate D undergoes alkyl activation, resulting in the formation of a Gaalkyl species and a Brnsted acid site. Alkyl activation is followed by the desorption of an alkene (ethene) from the Gaalkyl intermediate, leaving behind the gallium dihydride species ([GaH2]+Z m). The carbenium mechanism, on the other hand, involves the polarization of the CH bond in such a way that the carbon atom assumes a positive partial charge and hydrogen assumes a negative partial charge. This leads to the formation of alkoxide and metal hydride (MH) as intermediates. The CH activation step is proposed as the rate-determining step (RDS) because it involves the breaking of a strong C-H bond, which requires a significant amount of energy. The alkyl mechanism applies to different Ga species structures, with the overall free energy of alkyl activation being lower than that of carbenium activation for the 4-membered ring cluster Z4a. However, alkene desorption is a rate-limiting step for the overall alkyl activation catalytic cycle, regardless of the activity of the particular catalytic site. A novel one-step H2 and C2H4 desorption pathway from gallium alkyl intermediate has been reported, involving a cyclic transition state with an activation barrier of 53.5 kcal/mol. This mechanism of decomposition sets a lower limit of about 55 kcal/mol for the apparent activation barrier.

The alkyl mechanism in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions on gallium-based catalysts involves the initial activation of the CH bond by the [HGaH]+ species, forming a tetrahedral [H2GaC2H5] intermediate. This intermediate then undergoes rotation around the GaO20 coordination, followed by the removal of a hydrogen molecule (H2) and the desorption of the alkyl species. The activation barrier for the initial CH activation step is proposed as the rate-determining step (RDS) because at higher temperatures, this step becomes the slowest part of the reaction, with a calculated activation barrier of 3940 kcal/mol, which closely matches the experimental value of 39 kcal/mol. However, further calculations have shown that the activation barrier for CH activation is actually higher, at 48.66 kcal/mol, and the barrier for alkyl desorption is also quite high, at 61.67 kcal/mol, leading to a very low intrinsic reaction rate for the alkyl activation mechanism. This has led to the conclusion that the single-site [HGaH]+ model does not accurately represent the true mechanism for Ga-assisted dehydrogenation. In contrast, the carbenium mechanism, which involves the activation of the CH bond and the formation of an alkoxide intermediate, followed by alkene desorption and hydrogen removal, has been found to have a lower activation barrier for CH activation (85.72 kcal/mol) and a much lower barrier for hydrogen removal (15.49 kcal/mol). The higher activation barrier for CH activation in the carbenium mechanism is directly related to the endothermicity of the CH activation step, which is 51.40 kcal/mol.

In the alkyl mechanism of propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions on gallium-based catalysts, propane is initially activated by the metal cation to form an alkyl gallium intermediate. This is followed by Î²-elimination and the desorption of propylene and hydrogen. The mechanism is applicable to different structures of active Ga species, including Ga+, [GaH]+, and Ga2O22+. The CH activation step and the formation of an alkyl metal intermediate are proposed as the rate-determining step (RDS). In contrast to the carbenium mechanism, where Ga species facilitate the recombination of hydrogen adatoms to release hydrogen, the alkyl mechanism involves the activation of the CH bond in propane.

The alkyl mechanism in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions on gallium-based catalysts involves gallium acting as an acceptor of the alkyl group. The initial step of CH activation is the oxidative addition of an alkane molecule to the Ga+ cation, which proceeds via an indirect heterolytic mechanism involving the basic oxygen atoms of the zeolite lattice. The reaction mechanism is thought to consist of a complex scheme involving dehydrogenation, oligomerization, and ring closure steps. The modifying cations play key roles in dehydrogenation of paraffins, while Brnsted acid protons catalyze the oligomerization of the olefins produced and possibly their subsequent aromatization. The activation energy for this process is computed as 224 kJ/mol. The overall activation energy of the ethane dehydrogenation over the reduced dehydrogenated Ga/ZSM-5 zeolite is 233 kJ/mol. The mechanism of the initial activation of the hydrocarbon molecule on dihydrido-gallyl ion is very similar to that suggested for the heterolytic dissociation of ethane on Ga Zd. The calculated activation energy for this elementary step (193 kJ/mol) is significantly higher than that (158 kJ/mol) reported previously for GaH2+ species stabilized in a fully optimized 3T cluster. The activation energy for this process was 257 kJ/mol, in an excellent agreement with the previously reported values of 258 kJ/mol and 254 kJ/mol. The activation energy for this process [IV VI; Fig. 4, route (b)] is equal to 104 kJ/mol. The activation energies and enthalpies for both the ho- molytic and heterolytic CH bond cleavage on Ga+ ion in Zs clusters are very similar to those calculated for the distantly separated Al atoms. The fraction of cation sites containing two aluminum atoms in the next-nearest positions is small; for instance, in a zeolite with an Si:Al ratio of 25, it does not exceed 30%. The reactivity of either Ga+ or GaH2+ in hydrocarbon activation exhibits very slight dependence on the distribution of aluminum in zeolite. The apparent activation barrier for this process estimated within the model used is equal to 233 kJ/mol. The apparent activation barrier estimated for ethane dehydrogenation over Ga2O3/HZSM-5 is significantly lower (163 kJ/mol) than this value. Although the catalytic reaction can also occur over GaH2+ and GaH+2 sites, these paths are not favored. The reactivity of GaH+2 ions is strongly dependent on the distance between the stabilizing aluminum-occupied oxygen tetrahedra. In cases of greater AlAl distances, the stability of the GaH+2 species is very low, and it decomposes to Ga+ and a Brnsted acid site, whereas when Al atoms are located more closely, the charge-compensating GaH+2 ions are the most stable and exhibit the lowest activity for the initial CH bond cleavage reaction. The reaction mechanism of ethane dehydrogenation was investigated using DFT calculations for various reduced-gallium sites in Ga/ZSM-5. The probable catalytic cycle starts with the heterolytic CH bond cleavage involving exchanged univalent gallium cation and a basic oxygen atom of the zeolite framework. The low energy of the d-orbitals of Ga+ and its occupied s-orbital that make them unable to donate or accept electrons,respectively, from the hydrocarbon result in a high barrier for the direct oxidative addition of ethane to the cation. Therefore,heterolytic splitting of the CH bond is much more favorable due to the polarization induced by the interaction of the hydrocarbon with the Ga...O Lewis acidbase pair. The resulting product easily rearranges to form [HGaC2H5]+, which decomposes via simultaneous desorption of H2 and C2H4, regenerating the initial Ga+ species. The overall activation barrier for C2H6 dehydrogenation over Ga+Zsites is equal to 233 kJ/mol. Hydrogenated gallium species (GaH2+Zand ZGaH+2Z) are less likely active sites. Decomposition of the dihydrido-gallyl ions, resulting in formation of univalent gallium ions during the catalytic cycle, is significantly favored over regeneration of GaH2+ sites. In addition, the estimated overall activation barrier for the considered catalytic reaction is higher (by 58 kJ/mol) for GaH2+ sites than for Ga+ sites. Bivalent GaH+2 species stabilized at the cation site with distantly separated framework Al sites exhibit significantly higher initial activity for ethane activation but much lower stability compared with Ga+ sites. However, initial heterolytic cleavage of the CH bond results in formation of [HGaC2H5]+ ions that preferentially follow the reaction path, again leading to univalent gallium cations. On the other hand, GaH+2 ions charge-compensating two proximate framework aluminum ions are the most stable cationic species; however, initial activation of the CH bond over these sites is strongly disfavored both thermodynamically and kinetically. In contrast, the reactivity of univalent gallium species exchanged in zeolite depends only slightly on the relative position of zeolitic anionic sites ([AlO2]units). The alkyl mechanism is more favorable than the carbenium mechanism, which involves the formation of a carbenium ion attached to the basic oxygen of the zeolite and a hydride ion bonded to gallium. The activation energy for the alkyl mechanism is 193 kJ/mol, which is significantly higher than the 158 kJ/mol reported for the GaH2+ species stabilized in a fully optimized 3T cluster. However, the overall activation barrier for the alkyl mechanism is 233 kJ/mol, which is lower than the activation energy for the carbenium mechanism. The CH activation step is proposed as the rate-determining step (RDS) because it involves the breaking of a strong C-H bond. The alkyl mechanism applies to different Ga species structures, with Ga+ being the most favorable, followed by GaH2+ and GaH+2.

The alkyl mechanism in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions on gallium-based catalysts involves a sequence of steps starting with the activation of propane by a gallium species. The initial step is the formation of an alkyl-gallium intermediate, which then decomposes to produce an alkene molecule and regenerate the active site. This mechanism has been analyzed theoretically by Frash and van Santen for ethane activation on gallium-exchanged zeolites, with dihydridogallium ions as the active sites. However, our results suggest that the decomposition of the alkylhydrido intermediate occurs by reactions (17) and (18) instead of the proposed regeneration of the dihydrido active site. The alkyl mechanism applies to different Ga species structures, including isolated Ga(I) species and dihydridogallium ions, depending on the reaction conditions. Addition of hydrogen to the reaction medium suppresses the aromatization reaction, possibly by reversing reactions such as (17) and other dehydrogenation steps involved in aromatization. On the other hand, it strongly promotes the formation of methane and ethane. However, there is competition between hydrogen and the hydrocarbon for the active sites. A Langmuir-Hinshelwood type of mechanism, such as represented by reaction (20), is a likely possibility for the hydrogenolysis reactions.

The calculated activation energy for this elementary step (193 kJ/mol) is significantly higher than that (158 kJ/mol) reported previously for GaH2+ species stabilized in a fully optimized 3T cluster. The activation energy for this process was 257 kJ/mol, in an excellent agreement with the previously reported values of 258 kJ/mol and 254 kJ/mol. The activation energy for this process [IV VI; Fig. 4, route (b)] is equal to 104 kJ/mol. The activation energies and enthalpies for both the ho- molytic and heterolytic CH bond cleavage on Ga+ ion in Zs clusters are very similar to those calculated for the distantly separated Al atoms. The fraction of cation sites containing two aluminum atoms in the next-nearest positions is small; for instance, in a zeolite with an Si:Al ratio of 25, it does not exceed 30%. The reactivity of either Ga+ or GaH2+ in hydrocarbon activation exhibits very slight dependence on the distribution of aluminum in zeolite. The apparent activation barrier for this process estimated within the model used is equal to 233 kJ/mol. The apparent activation barrier estimated for ethane dehydrogenation over Ga2O3/HZSM-5 is significantly lower (163 kJ/mol) than this value. Although the catalytic reaction can also occur over GaH2+ and GaH+2 sites, these paths are not favored. The reactivity of GaH+2 ions is strongly dependent on the distance between the stabilizing aluminum-occupied oxygen tetrahedra. In cases of greater AlAl distances, the stability of the GaH+2 species is very low, and it decomposes to Ga+ and a Brnsted acid site, whereas when Al atoms are located more closely, the charge-compensating GaH+2 ions are the most stable and exhibit the lowest activity for the initial CH bond cleavage reaction. The reaction mechanism of ethane dehydrogenation was investigated using DFT calculations for various reduced-gallium sites in Ga/ZSM-5. The probable catalytic cycle starts with the heterolytic CH bond cleavage involving exchanged univalent gallium cation and a basic oxygen atom of the zeolite framework. The low energy of the d-orbitals of Ga+ and its occupied s-orbital that make them unable to donate or accept electrons,respectively, from the hydrocarbon result in a high barrier for the direct oxidative addition of ethane to the cation. Therefore,heterolytic splitting of the CH bond is much more favorable due to the polarization induced by the interaction of the hydrocarbon with the Ga...O Lewis acidbase pair. The resulting product easily rearranges to form [HGaC2H5]+, which decomposes via simultaneous desorption of H2 and C2H4, regenerating the initial Ga+ species. The overall activation barrier for C2H6 dehydrogenation over Ga+Zsites is equal to 233 kJ/mol. Hydrogenated gallium species (GaH2+Zand ZGaH+2Z) are less likely active sites. Decomposition of the dihydrido-gallyl ions, resulting in formation of univalent gallium ions during the catalytic cycle, is significantly favored over regeneration of GaH2+ sites. In addition, the estimated overall activation barrier for the considered catalytic reaction is higher (by 58 kJ/mol) for GaH2+ sites than for Ga+ sites. Bivalent GaH+2 species stabilized at the cation site with distantly separated framework Al sites exhibit significantly higher initial activity for ethane activation but much lower stability compared with Ga+ sites. However, initial heterolytic cleavage of the CH bond results in formation of [HGaC2H5]+ ions that preferentially follow the reaction path, again leading to univalent gallium cations. On the other hand, GaH+2 ions charge-compensating two proximate framework aluminum ions are the most stable cationic species; however, initial activation of the CH bond over these sites is strongly disfavored both thermodynamically and kinetically. In contrast, the reactivity of univalent gallium species exchanged in zeolite depends only slightly on the relative position of zeolitic anionic sites ([AlO2]units). The alkyl mechanism is more favorable than the carbenium mechanism, which involves the formation of a carbenium ion attached to the basic oxygen of the zeolite and a hydride ion bonded to gallium. The activation energy for the alkyl mechanism is 193 kJ/mol, which is significantly higher than the 158 kJ/mol reported for the GaH2+ species stabilized in a fully optimized 3T cluster. However, the overall activation barrier for the alkyl mechanism is 233 kJ/mol, which is lower than the activation energy for the carbenium mechanism. The CH activation step is proposed as the rate-determining step (RDS) because it involves the breaking of a strong C-H bond. The alkyl mechanism applies to different Ga species structures, with Ga+ being the most favorable, followed by GaH2+ and GaH+2. The reactivity of GaH+2 ions is strongly dependent on the distance between the stabilizing aluminum-occupied oxygen tetrahedra. In cases of greater AlAl distances, the stability of the GaH+2 species is very low, and it decomposes to Ga+ and a Brnsted acid site, whereas when Al atoms are located more closely, the charge-compensating GaH+2 ions are the most stable and exhibit the lowest activity for the initial CH bond cleavage reaction.

The alkyl mechanism in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions on gallium-based catalysts involves a sequence of steps starting with the activation of propane by a gallium species. The initial step is the formation of an alkyl-gallium intermediate, which then decomposes to produce an alkene molecule and regenerate the active site. This mechanism has been analyzed theoretically by Frash and van Santen for ethane activation on gallium-exchanged zeolites, with dihydridogallium ions as the active sites. However, our results suggest that the decomposition of the alkylhydrido intermediate occurs by reactions (17) and (18) instead of the proposed regeneration of the dihydrido active site. The alkyl mechanism applies to different Ga species structures, including isolated Ga(I) species and dihydridogallium ions, depending on the reaction conditions. Addition of hydrogen to the reaction medium suppresses the aromatization reaction, possibly by reversing reactions such as (17) and other dehydrogenation steps involved in aromatization. On the other hand, it strongly promotes the formation of methane and ethane. However, there is competition between hydrogen and the hydrocarbon for the active sites. A Langmuir-Hinshelwood type of mechanism, such as represented by reaction (20), is a likely possibility for the hydrogenolysis reactions. It should be reminded that the isolated gallium species are formed from binuclear gallium oxidic species during reduction, so pairs of reduced species are likely to be in close proximity in the reduced form of the catalyst. The reactions proposed in this article refer to the activation of the catalysts at the beginning of the reaction and to propane activation. In subsequent steps, the zeolite Brnsted acid sites are responsible for oligomerization, cyclization, and hydride transfer reactions involved in the aromatization process, while reduced gallium species are responsible for dehydrogenation reactions.

The alkyl mechanism in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions on gallium-based catalysts involves the activation of propane by hydride abstraction from the reacting alkane by adsorbed carbenium ions (bimolecular) or by addition of protons to alkenes to form a carbenium ion (monomolecular). The addition of Ga ions to H-ZSM5 channels increases the rate of propene formation by removing H-atoms from acid sites that activate C-H bonds, allowing acid sites to turnover without the formation of cracking products. Ga and Zn act as 'portholes' and catalyze the recombinative desorption of H-atoms, formed from acid-catalyzed C-H bond cleavage, as all-hydrogen (H2). This mechanism applies to different Ga species structures, as the beneficial effect of Ga on alkane aromatization rates and selectivity has been observed whether Ga ions are introduced by impregnation or ion exchange techniques. Compared to the carbenium mechanism, the alkyl mechanism involves the activation of propane by hydride abstraction or proton addition, rather than the direct protonation of propane to form carbonium ions. The CH activation step is proposed as the rate-determining step (RDS) because it involves the breaking of a strong C-H bond, which is energetically unfavorable. Reactions over Na-ZSM5 confirm that C-H bond activation occurs predominantly on BrOnsted acid sites, supporting the alkyl mechanism.

The alkyl mechanism in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions on gallium-based catalysts involves the initial activation of propane, where the carbon atom develops a negative charge and the hydrogen develops a positive charge. This leads to the formation of a metal-alkyl (MCnH2n+1) and a Brnsted acid as intermediates. The activated intermediate D undergoes alkyl activation, resulting in the formation of a Gaalkyl species and a Brnsted acid site. Alkyl activation is followed by the desorption of an alkene (ethene) from the Gaalkyl intermediate, leaving behind the gallium dihydride species ([GaH2]+Z m). The carbenium mechanism, on the other hand, involves the polarization of the CH bond in such a way that the carbon atom assumes a positive partial charge and hydrogen assumes a negative partial charge. This leads to the formation of alkoxide and metal hydride (MH) as intermediates. The CH activation step is proposed as the rate-determining step (RDS) because it involves the breaking of a strong C-H bond, which requires a significant amount of energy. The alkyl mechanism applies to different Ga species structures, with the overall free energy of alkyl activation being lower than that of carbenium activation for the 4-membered ring cluster Z4a. However, alkene desorption is a rate-limiting step for the overall alkyl activation catalytic cycle, regardless of the activity of the particular catalytic site. A novel one-step H2 and C2H4 desorption pathway from gallium alkyl intermediate has been reported, involving a cyclic transition state with an activation barrier of 53.5 kcal/mol. This mechanism of decomposition sets a lower limit of about 55 kcal/mol for the apparent activation barrier.

The alkyl mechanism in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions on gallium-based catalysts involves the initial activation of the CH bond by the [HGaH]+ species, forming a tetrahedral [H2GaC2H5] intermediate. This intermediate then undergoes rotation around the GaO20 coordination, followed by the removal of a hydrogen molecule (H2) and the desorption of the alkyl species. The activation barrier for the initial CH activation step is proposed as the rate-determining step (RDS) because at higher temperatures, this step becomes the slowest part of the reaction, with a calculated activation barrier of 3940 kcal/mol, which closely matches the experimental value of 39 kcal/mol. However, further calculations have shown that the activation barrier for CH activation is actually higher, at 48.66 kcal/mol, and the barrier for alkyl desorption is also quite high, at 61.67 kcal/mol, leading to a very low intrinsic reaction rate for the alkyl activation mechanism. This has led to the conclusion that the single-site [HGaH]+ model does not accurately represent the true mechanism for Ga-assisted dehydrogenation. In contrast, the carbenium mechanism, which involves the activation of the CH bond and the formation of an alkoxide intermediate, followed by alkene desorption and hydrogen removal, has been found to have a lower activation barrier for CH activation (85.72 kcal/mol) and a much lower barrier for hydrogen removal (15.49 kcal/mol). The higher activation barrier for CH activation in the carbenium mechanism is directly related to the endothermicity of the CH activation step, which is 51.40 kcal/mol.

In the alkyl mechanism of propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions on gallium-based catalysts, propane is initially activated by the metal cation to form an alkyl gallium intermediate. This is followed by Î²-elimination and the desorption of propylene and hydrogen. The mechanism is applicable to different structures of active Ga species, including Ga+, [GaH]+, and Ga2O22+. The CH activation step and the formation of an alkyl metal intermediate are proposed as the rate-determining step (RDS). In contrast to the carbenium mechanism, where Ga species facilitate the recombination of hydrogen adatoms to release hydrogen, the alkyl mechanism involves the activation of the CH bond in propane.

The alkyl mechanism in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions on gallium-based catalysts involves gallium acting as an acceptor of the alkyl group. The initial step of CH activation is the oxidative addition of an alkane molecule to the Ga+ cation, which proceeds via an indirect heterolytic mechanism involving the basic oxygen atoms of the zeolite lattice. The reaction mechanism is thought to consist of a complex scheme involving dehydrogenation, oligomerization, and ring closure steps. The modifying cations play key roles in dehydrogenation of paraffins, while Brnsted acid protons catalyze the oligomerization of the olefins produced and possibly their subsequent aromatization. The activation energy for this process is computed as 224 kJ/mol. The overall activation energy of the ethane dehydrogenation over the reduced dehydrogenated Ga/ZSM-5 zeolite is 233 kJ/mol.
