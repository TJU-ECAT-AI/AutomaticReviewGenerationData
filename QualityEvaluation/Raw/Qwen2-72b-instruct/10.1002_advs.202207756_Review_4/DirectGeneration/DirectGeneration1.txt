In the context of propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions over gallium-based catalysts, the alkyl mechanism plays a pivotal role in the conversion of propane to propene. This mechanism involves a series of steps, starting with the adsorption of propane on the catalyst surface. The key step in this mechanism is the abstraction of a hydrogen atom from propane, facilitated by the active gallium sites, leading to the formation of a propyl radical. This radical then undergoes further dehydrogenation to form propene and a hydrogen atom. The rate-determining step is often associated with the initial hydrogen abstraction, which requires a significant activation energy. Comparatively, the carbenium mechanism, which is less favored in gallium-based catalysts, involves the formation of a carbenium ion intermediate. This pathway is generally slower due to the higher energy barrier associated with the formation of the carbenium ion. The alkyl mechanism's dominance in gallium-based PDH catalysts is attributed to the metal's ability to stabilize the radical intermediates, making it a more efficient route for propane dehydrogenation.
