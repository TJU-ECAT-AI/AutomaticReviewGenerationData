1.No relevant quotes were found in the literature to answer the question about the alkyl mechanism in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions on gallium-based catalysts, detailing its key steps from initial propane activation to product formation. No information was provided to compare this mechanism to the carbenium mechanism, discuss why the CH activation step is proposed as the rate-determining step (RDS), or explain how the alkyl mechanism applies to different Ga species structures.

1.在文献中没有找到与丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应中镓基催化剂上的烷基机制相关的关键引文，该机制详细描述了从初始丙烷活化到产品形成的各个关键步骤。没有提供信息来比较这种机制与碳烯机制，讨论为什么提出CH活化步骤作为速率决定步骤(RDS)，或解释烷基机制如何适用于不同的Ga物种结构。
