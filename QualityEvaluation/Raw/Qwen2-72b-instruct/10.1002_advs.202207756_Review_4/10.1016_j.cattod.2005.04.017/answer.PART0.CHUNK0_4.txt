[1] "The authors concluded that the alkyl activation path for [HGaH]+ species is the actual path for dehydrogenation."
[2] "However, this conclusion was based on the observation that at higher temperatures, the initial CH activation step becomes the rate-determining step, and the calculated activation barrier (3940 kcal/mol) for this first step is in close agreement with the experimentally estimated value of 39 kcal/mol [20]."
[3] "We find that the activation energy for initial CH activation is substantially higher (48.66 kcal/mol) compared to their previously calculated [37] value of 37.9 kcal/mol."
[4] "We have also located an additional transition state (TS2) for the rotation of the tetrahedral [H2GaC2H5] species."
[5] "The activation barrier for the alkyl desorption (process X ! TS4 in Fig. 3) was 61.67 kcal/mol, which is in close agreement with the previously reported [37] value of 60.7 kcal/mol."
[6] "This high activationbarrierfor thealkylremovalstepshouldleadtovery low intrinsic reaction rate for the alkyl activation mechanism."
[7] "We conclude from the previous literature, and from our extension here, that the single site, [HGaH]+, model does not represent the true mechanism for Ga-assisted dehydrogenation."
[8] "We find the energy barrier for CH activation is 85.72 kcal/mol, corresponding to the initial alkane adsorption and hydrogen removal."
[9] "The activation barrier for this step (process V + C2H6 ! TS11 in Fig. 7) is very high considering the other reaction paths we have presented so far."
[10] "The activation barrier for hydrogen removal is substantially smaller than that for CH activation."
[11] "The activation barrier for CH activation is directly related to the large endothermicity of the CH activation step (DE = 51.40 kcal/mol)."

1.The alkyl mechanism in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions on gallium-based catalysts involves the initial activation of the CH bond by the [HGaH]+ species, forming a tetrahedral [H2GaC2H5] intermediate. This intermediate then undergoes rotation around the GaO20 coordination, followed by the removal of a hydrogen molecule (H2) and the desorption of the alkyl species. The activation barrier for the initial CH activation step is proposed as the rate-determining step (RDS) because at higher temperatures, this step becomes the slowest part of the reaction, with a calculated activation barrier of 3940 kcal/mol, which closely matches the experimental value of 39 kcal/mol. However, further calculations have shown that the activation barrier for CH activation is actually higher, at 48.66 kcal/mol, and the barrier for alkyl desorption is also quite high, at 61.67 kcal/mol, leading to a very low intrinsic reaction rate for the alkyl activation mechanism. This has led to the conclusion that the single-site [HGaH]+ model does not accurately represent the true mechanism for Ga-assisted dehydrogenation. In contrast, the carbenium mechanism, which involves the activation of the CH bond and the formation of an alkoxide intermediate, followed by alkene desorption and hydrogen removal, has been found to have a lower activation barrier for CH activation (85.72 kcal/mol) and a much lower barrier for hydrogen removal (15.49 kcal/mol). The higher activation barrier for CH activation in the carbenium mechanism is directly related to the endothermicity of the CH activation step, which is 51.40 kcal/mol.

1.在基于镓的催化剂上的丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应中,烷基机制涉及CH键的初始激活,由[HGaH]+物种形成,形成四面体[H2GaC2H5]中间体。这个中间体然后围绕GaO20配位旋转,随后去除氢分子(H2)和烷基物种的解吸。CH激活步骤的初始激活势垒被提议为速率决定步骤(RDS),因为在较高温度下,这一步骤成为反应中最慢的部分,计算的激活势垒为3940 kcal/mol,这与实验值39 kcal/mol非常接近。然而,进一步的计算表明,CH激活的激活势垒实际上更高,为48.66 kcal/mol,烷基解吸的势垒也相当高,为61.67 kcal/mol,导致烷基激活机制的内在反应速率非常低。这导致了单站点[HGaH]+模型不能准确表示Ga辅助脱氢的真实机制的结论。相比之下,卡宾机制涉及CH键的激活和醇氧化物中间体的形成,随后是烯烃解吸和氢去除,被发现具有较低的CH激活势垒(85.72 kcal/mol)和氢去除的势垒要低得多(15.49 kcal/mol)。卡宾机制中CH激活的较高激活势垒直接与CH激活步骤的吸热性相关,为51.40 kcal/mol。
