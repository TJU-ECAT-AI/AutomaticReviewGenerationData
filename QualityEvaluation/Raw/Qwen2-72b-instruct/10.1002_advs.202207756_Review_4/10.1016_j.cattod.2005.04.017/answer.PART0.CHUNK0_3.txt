[1] "For the mono-Al site, we report a new, direct one-step dehydrogenation mechanism; however, we conclude in general that mono-Al sites in ZSM- 5 are not likely responsible for alkane dehydrogentation, as calculated activation energies are too high compared to experimental values (60 kcal/mol versus 39 kcal/mol)."
[2] "We find that as AlAl distance increases, the activation barrier for CH activation decreases (ranging from 85.72 to 38.38 to 19.69 kcal/mol), while the barrier for H2 removal increases (ranging from 15.49 to 36.71 to 47.38 kcal/mol)resulting in an optimal AlAl separation distance of 4.53 A arising from these competing trends."
[3] "We conclude from the previous literature, and from our extension here, that the single site, [HGaH]+, model does not represent the true mechanism for Ga-assisted dehydrogenation."
[4] "We subsequently investigated the possibility of alkane activation mechanisms by gallium species [GaH]2+ in proximity to two aluminum T sites."
[5] "The activation barrier for this step (process V + C2H6 ! TS11 in Fig. 7) is very high considering the other reaction paths we have presented so far."
[6] "The activation barrier for CH activation is directly related to the large endothermicity of the CH activation step (DE = 51.40 kcal/mol)."
[7] "Thus, the activation barriers for the second step of CH activation are similar for the sites VI and VII, and hence the activation barrier for the initial insertion of the methyl group in GaO coordination can be easily correlated to the stability of the site."
[8] "On the other hand, if the catalyst site is very active, like in model VII for the eight- membered ring, then the CH activation barrier is very low."
[9] "However, the regeneration of the same active catalyst site by H2 removal faces a higher activation barrier."
[10] "In this particular case, we relate the activity directly to the catalyst site geometry."
[11] "A simple correlation between the Al Al distance and the activity for dehydrogenation can then be formulated."
[12] "For the thermo-neutral heat of reaction (model VI), we observe the optimum activity of the catalyst site."

1.The alkyl mechanism in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions on gallium-based catalysts involves the activation of the CH bond and the formation of an alkoxide-like intermediate, followed by the removal of the primary alkoxide by desorption of an alkene. This mechanism is proposed to be applicable to different Ga species structures, including mono-Al sites and di-Al sites. However, the mono-Al sites in ZSM-5 are not likely responsible for alkane dehydrogenation due to the high calculated activation energies compared to experimental values. The di-Al sites, represented by [GaH]2+ species near pairs of tetrahedral Al, have higher activity for dehydrogenation. The activation barrier for CH activation decreases with the increase in AlAl distance, while the barrier for H2 removal increases, resulting in an optimal AlAl separation distance of 4.53 A. The CH activation step is proposed as the rate-determining step (RDS) due to its high activation barrier, which is directly related to the endothermicity of the CH activation step. The alkyl mechanism applies to different Ga species structures, but the single site, [HGaH]+, model does not represent the true mechanism for Ga-assisted dehydrogenation. The alkyl mechanism is more applicable to the [GaH]2+ species near pairs of tetrahedral Al, which have higher activity for dehydrogenation.

1.在基于镓的催化剂上的丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应中，烷基机制涉及CH键的活化和类似醇酸的中间体的形成，随后通过脱烷基的脱附去除初级醇酸。该机制被提议适用于不同的Ga物种结构，包括单Al位点和双Al位点。然而，ZSM-5中的单Al位点不太可能对烷烃脱氢负责，因为与实验值相比，计算的活化能过高。双Al位点，由靠近四面体Al对的[GaH]2+物种表示，对脱氢具有更高的活性。随着AlAl距离的增加，CH活化势垒降低，而H2去除势垒增加，导致4.53 A的最优AlAl分离距离。由于其高活化势垒，CH活化步骤被提议为速率决定步骤(RDS)，这直接与CH活化步骤的吸热性有关。烷基机制适用于不同的Ga物种结构，但单一位点，[HGaH]+，模型并不代表镓辅助脱氢的真实机制。烷基机制更适用于靠近四面体Al对的[GaH]2+物种，它们对脱氢具有更高的活性。
