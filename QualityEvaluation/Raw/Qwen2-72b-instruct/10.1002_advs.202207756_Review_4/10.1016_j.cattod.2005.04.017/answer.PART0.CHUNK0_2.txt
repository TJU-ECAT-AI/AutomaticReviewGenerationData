[1] "For the mono-Al site, we report a new, direct one-step dehydrogenation mechanism; however, we conclude in general that mono-Al sites in ZSM- 5 are not likely responsible for alkane dehydrogentation, as calculated activation energies are too high compared to experimental values (60 kcal/mol versus 39 kcal/mol)."
[2] "We find that as AlAl distance increases, the activation barrier for CH activation decreases (ranging from 85.72 to 38.38 to 19.69 kcal/mol), while the barrier for H2 removal increases (ranging from 15.49 to 36.71 to 47.38 kcal/mol)resulting in an optimal AlAl separation distance of 4.53 A arising from these competing trends."
[3] "We conclude that out of several possible catalytic sites in Ga-HZSM-5, extra- framework gallium species near pairs of tetrahedral Al have higher activity, and the activity of these sites can be correlated to AlAl distance."
[4] "The activation barrier for n-butane is about 4 kcal/mol lower compared to that of the ethane. This trend agrees with the experimental finding [26] that dehydrogenation of the higher alkanes (C4) is easier than that of lower alkanes (C2)."
[5] "The activation barrier for initial CH activation is substantially higher (48.66 kcal/mol) compared to their previously calculated [37] value of 37.9 kcal/mol."
[6] "We conclude from the previous literature, and from our extension here, that the single site, [HGaH]+, model does not represent the true mechanism for Ga-assisted dehydrogenation."

1.The alkyl mechanism in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions on gallium-based catalysts involves several key steps from initial propane activation to product formation. The mechanism starts with the adsorption of propane on the gallium site, followed by the activation of a C-H bond to form a carbocation intermediate. This intermediate then undergoes a series of reactions, including hydrogen transfer and alkene desorption, to produce propene and regenerate the catalyst. The carbenium mechanism, on the other hand, involves the initial formation of a carbenium ion intermediate, which is then deprotonated to form an alkene. The CH activation step is proposed as the rate-determining step (RDS) due to the high activation energy required for C-H bond cleavage. The alkyl mechanism applies to different Ga species structures, with the activation barrier being influenced by factors such as the Ga-H bond strength and the presence of polar environments around the gallium site. The activation barrier for the one-step dehydrogenation path is comparable to the maximum activation barrier for previously proposed alkyl mechanisms, indicating that the one-step mechanism is a viable alternative for alkane dehydrogenation.

1.在基于镓的催化剂上的丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应中，烷基机制涉及从初始丙烷活化到产物形成的关键步骤。该机制从丙烷在镓位点上的吸附开始，随后是C-H键的活化，形成碳正离子中间体。该中间体随后经历一系列反应，包括氢转移和烯烃脱附，以产生丙烯并再生催化剂。另一方面，卡宾机制涉及最初形成卡宾离子中间体，然后被脱质子化形成烯烃。由于C-H键断裂所需的高活化能，CH活化步骤被提议为速率决定步骤(RDS)。烷基机制适用于不同的Ga物种结构，活化能受镓-氢键强度和镓位点周围极性环境等因素的影响。一步脱氢路径的活化能与先前提出的烷基机制的最大活化能相当，表明一步机制是烷烃脱氢的可行替代方案。
