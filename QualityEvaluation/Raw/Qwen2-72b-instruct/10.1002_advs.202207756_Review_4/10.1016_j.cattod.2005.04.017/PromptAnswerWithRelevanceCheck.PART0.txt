1.The alkyl mechanism in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions on gallium-based catalysts involves the initial adsorption of propane on the [HGaH]+ species, followed by the activation of the CH bond, which becomes the rate-determining step (RDS) at higher temperatures. The calculated activation barrier for this first step is in close agreement with the experimentally estimated value. However, the activation energy for initial CH activation is substantially higher than previously calculated, and an additional transition state for the rotation of the tetrahedral [H2GaC2H5] species has been located. The activation barrier for the alkyl desorption step is also very high, leading to a very low intrinsic reaction rate for the alkyl activation mechanism. The single site, [HGaH]+, model does not represent the true mechanism for Ga-assisted dehydrogenation.
2.Compared to the carbenium mechanism, the alkyl mechanism has a higher activation barrier for the initial CH activation step, which becomes the rate-determining step at higher temperatures. The calculated activation barrier for this first step is in close agreement with the experimentally estimated value. However, the activation energy for initial CH activation is substantially higher than previously calculated, and an additional transition state for the rotation of the tetrahedral [H2GaC2H5] species has been located. The activation barrier for the alkyl desorption step is also very high, leading to a very low intrinsic reaction rate for the alkyl activation mechanism.
3.The CH activation step is proposed as the rate-determining step (RDS) because the activation barrier for this step is very high, and it becomes the rate-determining step at higher temperatures. The calculated activation barrier for this first step is in close agreement with the experimentally estimated value. However, the activation energy for initial CH activation is substantially higher than previously calculated, and an additional transition state for the rotation of the tetrahedral [H2GaC2H5] species has been located.

1.在基于镓的催化剂上的丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应中，烷基机制涉及丙烷在[HGaH]+物种上的初始吸附，随后是CH键的活化，这在较高温度下成为速率决定步骤(RDS)。对于这第一步的计算活化能与实验估计值非常接近。然而，初始CH活化的活化能远高于以前的计算值，并且已经定位了四面体[H2GaC2H5]物种旋转的额外过渡态。烷基解吸步骤的活化能也非常高，导致烷基活化机制的内在反应速率非常低。单点[HGaH]+模型并不代表Ga辅助脱氢的真实机制。

[1] "For the mono-Al site, we report a new, direct one-step dehydrogenation mechanism; however, we conclude in general that mono-Al sites in ZSM- 5 are not likely responsible for alkane dehydrogentation, as calculated activation energies are too high compared to experimental values (60 kcal/mol versus 39 kcal/mol)."
[2] "We find that as AlAl distance increases, the activation barrier for CH activation decreases (ranging from 85.72 to 38.38 to 19.69 kcal/mol), while the barrier for H2 removal increases (ranging from 15.49 to 36.71 to 47.38 kcal/mol)resulting in an optimal AlAl separation distance of 4.53 A arising from these competing trends."

[8] "We conclude that both direct activation on the reduced ([HGaH]+) single site as well as alternatively ligated single [HGaX]+ sites, are not correct representations of the true CH activation pathway."
[9] "We find the gallium species in the six-membered ring represent the most stable site (highest DHred)."
[10] "The trends in reactivity show that higher site stability, and consequently smaller AlAl distances, resulted in larger activation barriers for CH activation (85.72 kcal/mol) and lower barriers for H2 desorption and site regeneration (15.49 kcal/mol)."
[11] "Thus,we found an optimal AlAl distance (4.53 A ) corresponding to a minimum overall barrier (38.38 kcal/mol for CH activation and 36.71 kcal/mol H2 removal) for dehydrogena- tion reaction as a result of the competition between these two trends."

1.The alkyl mechanism in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions on gallium-based catalysts involves the initial adsorption of propane on the gallium site, followed by the removal of hydrogen to form a gallium dihydride species and an alkoxide intermediate. The alkoxide then desorbs as an alkene, leaving behind a Brnsted acid site. This mechanism applies to different gallium species structures, such as [HGaH]+ and [HGaX]+, where X can be CH3, OH, or Cl. However, the activation barrier for the alkyl removal step is very high, leading to a low intrinsic reaction rate for the alkyl activation mechanism. The carbenium mechanism, on the other hand, involves the activation of the CH bond and the formation of an alkoxide-like intermediate, followed by the removal of the primary alkoxide by desorption of an alkene and the desorption of molecular hydrogen to complete the catalytic cycle. The CH activation step is proposed as the rate-determining step (RDS) because it faces a very high activation energy, especially for the [HGaH]+ site. The alkyl mechanism does not apply to the [HGaH]+ site because the activation barrier is too high compared to experimental values.

1.The alkyl mechanism in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions on gallium-based catalysts involves several key steps from initial propane activation to product formation. The mechanism starts with the adsorption of propane on the gallium site, followed by the activation of a C-H bond to form a carbocation intermediate. This intermediate then undergoes a series of reactions, including hydrogen transfer and alkene desorption, to produce propene and regenerate the catalyst. The carbenium mechanism, on the other hand, involves the initial formation of a carbenium ion intermediate, which is then deprotonated to form an alkene. The CH activation step is proposed as the rate-determining step (RDS) due to the high activation energy required for C-H bond cleavage. The alkyl mechanism applies to different Ga species structures, with the activation barrier being influenced by factors such as the Ga-H bond strength and the presence of polar environments around the gallium site. The activation barrier for the one-step dehydrogenation path is comparable to the maximum activation barrier for previously proposed alkyl mechanisms, indicating that the one-step mechanism is a viable alternative for alkane dehydrogenation.

1.The alkyl mechanism in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions on gallium-based catalysts involves the activation of the CH bond and the formation of an alkoxide-like intermediate, followed by the removal of the primary alkoxide by desorption of an alkene. This mechanism is proposed to be applicable to different Ga species structures, including mono-Al sites and di-Al sites. However, the mono-Al sites in ZSM-5 are not likely responsible for alkane dehydrogenation due to the high calculated activation energies compared to experimental values. The di-Al sites, represented by [GaH]2+ species near pairs of tetrahedral Al, have higher activity for dehydrogenation. The activation barrier for CH activation decreases with the increase in AlAl distance, while the barrier for H2 removal increases, resulting in an optimal AlAl separation distance of 4.53 A. The CH activation step is proposed as the rate-determining step (RDS) due to its high activation barrier, which is directly related to the endothermicity of the CH activation step. The alkyl mechanism applies to different Ga species structures, but the single site, [HGaH]+, model does not represent the true mechanism for Ga-assisted dehydrogenation. The alkyl mechanism is more applicable to the [GaH]2+ species near pairs of tetrahedral Al, which have higher activity for dehydrogenation.

1.在基于镓的催化剂上的丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应中，烷基机制涉及CH键的活化和类似醇酸的中间体的形成，随后通过脱烷基的脱附去除初级醇酸。该机制被提议适用于不同的Ga物种结构，包括单Al位点和双Al位点。然而，ZSM-5中的单Al位点不太可能对烷烃脱氢负责，因为与实验值相比，计算的活化能过高。双Al位点，由靠近四面体Al对的[GaH]2+物种表示，对脱氢具有更高的活性。随着AlAl距离的增加，CH活化势垒降低，而H2去除势垒增加，导致4.53 A的最优AlAl分离距离。由于其高活化势垒，CH活化步骤被提议为速率决定步骤(RDS)，这直接与CH活化步骤的吸热性有关。烷基机制适用于不同的Ga物种结构，但单一位点，[HGaH]+，模型并不代表镓辅助脱氢的真实机制。烷基机制更适用于靠近四面体Al对的[GaH]2+物种，它们对脱氢具有更高的活性。

[1] "The authors concluded that the alkyl activation path for [HGaH]+ species is the actual path for dehydrogenation."
[2] "However, this conclusion was based on the observation that at higher temperatures, the initial CH activation step becomes the rate-determining step, and the calculated activation barrier (3940 kcal/mol) for this first step is in close agreement with the experimentally estimated value of 39 kcal/mol [20]."
[3] "We find that the activation energy for initial CH activation is substantially higher (48.66 kcal/mol) compared to their previously calculated [37] value of 37.9 kcal/mol."
[4] "We have also located an additional transition state (TS2) for the rotation of the tetrahedral [H2GaC2H5] species."
[5] "The activation barrier for the alkyl desorption (process X ! TS4 in Fig. 3) was 61.67 kcal/mol, which is in close agreement with the previously reported [37] value of 60.7 kcal/mol."
[6] "This high activationbarrierfor thealkylremovalstepshouldleadtovery low intrinsic reaction rate for the alkyl activation mechanism."
[7] "We conclude from the previous literature, and from our extension here, that the single site, [HGaH]+, model does not represent the true mechanism for Ga-assisted dehydrogenation."
[8] "We find the energy barrier for CH activation is 85.72 kcal/mol, corresponding to the initial alkane adsorption and hydrogen removal."
[9] "The activation barrier for this step (process V + C2H6 ! TS11 in Fig. 7) is very high considering the other reaction paths we have presented so far."
[10] "The activation barrier for hydrogen removal is substantially smaller than that for CH activation."
[11] "The activation barrier for CH activation is directly related to the large endothermicity of the CH activation step (DE = 51.40 kcal/mol)."

1.The alkyl mechanism in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions on gallium-based catalysts involves the initial activation of the CH bond by the [HGaH]+ species, forming a tetrahedral [H2GaC2H5] intermediate. This intermediate then undergoes rotation around the GaO20 coordination, followed by the removal of a hydrogen molecule (H2) and the desorption of the alkyl species. The activation barrier for the initial CH activation step is proposed as the rate-determining step (RDS) because at higher temperatures, this step becomes the slowest part of the reaction, with a calculated activation barrier of 3940 kcal/mol, which closely matches the experimental value of 39 kcal/mol. However, further calculations have shown that the activation barrier for CH activation is actually higher, at 48.66 kcal/mol, and the barrier for alkyl desorption is also quite high, at 61.67 kcal/mol, leading to a very low intrinsic reaction rate for the alkyl activation mechanism. This has led to the conclusion that the single-site [HGaH]+ model does not accurately represent the true mechanism for Ga-assisted dehydrogenation. In contrast, the carbenium mechanism, which involves the activation of the CH bond and the formation of an alkoxide intermediate, followed by alkene desorption and hydrogen removal, has been found to have a lower activation barrier for CH activation (85.72 kcal/mol) and a much lower barrier for hydrogen removal (15.49 kcal/mol). The higher activation barrier for CH activation in the carbenium mechanism is directly related to the endothermicity of the CH activation step, which is 51.40 kcal/mol.

1.在基于镓的催化剂上的丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应中,烷基机制涉及CH键的初始激活,由[HGaH]+物种形成,形成四面体[H2GaC2H5]中间体。这个中间体然后围绕GaO20配位旋转,随后去除氢分子(H2)和烷基物种的解吸。CH激活步骤的初始激活势垒被提议为速率决定步骤(RDS),因为在较高温度下,这一步骤成为反应中最慢的部分,计算的激活势垒为3940 kcal/mol,这与实验值39 kcal/mol非常接近。然而,进一步的计算表明,CH激活的激活势垒实际上更高,为48.66 kcal/mol,烷基解吸的势垒也相当高,为61.67 kcal/mol,导致烷基激活机制的内在反应速率非常低。这导致了单站点[HGaH]+模型不能准确表示Ga辅助脱氢的真实机制的结论。相比之下,卡宾机制涉及CH键的激活和醇氧化物中间体的形成,随后是烯烃解吸和氢去除,被发现具有较低的CH激活势垒(85.72 kcal/mol)和氢去除的势垒要低得多(15.49 kcal/mol)。卡宾机制中CH激活的较高激活势垒直接与CH激活步骤的吸热性相关,为51.40 kcal/mol。
