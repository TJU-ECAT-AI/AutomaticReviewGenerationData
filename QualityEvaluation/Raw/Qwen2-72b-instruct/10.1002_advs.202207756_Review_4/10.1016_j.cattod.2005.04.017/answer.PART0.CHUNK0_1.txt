[1] "For the mono-Al site, we report a new, direct one-step dehydrogenation mechanism; however, we conclude in general that mono-Al sites in ZSM- 5 are not likely responsible for alkane dehydrogentation, as calculated activation energies are too high compared to experimental values (60 kcal/mol versus 39 kcal/mol)."
[2] "We find that as AlAl distance increases, the activation barrier for CH activation decreases (ranging from 85.72 to 38.38 to 19.69 kcal/mol), while the barrier for H2 removal increases (ranging from 15.49 to 36.71 to 47.38 kcal/mol)resulting in an optimal AlAl separation distance of 4.53 A arising from these competing trends."
[3] "We conclude from the previous literature, and from our extension here, that the single site, [HGaH]+, model does not represent the true mechanism for Ga-assisted dehydrogenation."
[4] "We subsequently investigated the possibility of alkane activation mechanisms by gallium species [GaH]2+ in proximity to two aluminum T sites."
[5] "We find the energy barrier for CH activation is 85.72 kcal/mol, corresponding to the initial alkane adsorption and hydrogen removal."
[6] "The activation barrier for this step (process V + C2H6 ! TS11 in Fig. 7) is very high considering the other reaction paths we have presented so far."
[7] "The activation barrier for the alkyl removal step shouldleadtovery low intrinsic reaction rate for the alkyl activation mechanism."
[8] "We conclude that both direct activation on the reduced ([HGaH]+) single site as well as alternatively ligated single [HGaX]+ sites, are not correct representations of the true CH activation pathway."
[9] "We find the gallium species in the six-membered ring represent the most stable site (highest DHred)."
[10] "The trends in reactivity show that higher site stability, and consequently smaller AlAl distances, resulted in larger activation barriers for CH activation (85.72 kcal/mol) and lower barriers for H2 desorption and site regeneration (15.49 kcal/mol)."
[11] "Thus,we found an optimal AlAl distance (4.53 A ) corresponding to a minimum overall barrier (38.38 kcal/mol for CH activation and 36.71 kcal/mol H2 removal) for dehydrogena- tion reaction as a result of the competition between these two trends."

1.The alkyl mechanism in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions on gallium-based catalysts involves the initial adsorption of propane on the gallium site, followed by the removal of hydrogen to form a gallium dihydride species and an alkoxide intermediate. The alkoxide then desorbs as an alkene, leaving behind a Brnsted acid site. This mechanism applies to different gallium species structures, such as [HGaH]+ and [HGaX]+, where X can be CH3, OH, or Cl. However, the activation barrier for the alkyl removal step is very high, leading to a low intrinsic reaction rate for the alkyl activation mechanism. The carbenium mechanism, on the other hand, involves the activation of the CH bond and the formation of an alkoxide-like intermediate, followed by the removal of the primary alkoxide by desorption of an alkene and the desorption of molecular hydrogen to complete the catalytic cycle. The CH activation step is proposed as the rate-determining step (RDS) because it faces a very high activation energy, especially for the [HGaH]+ site. The alkyl mechanism does not apply to the [HGaH]+ site because the activation barrier is too high compared to experimental values.

1.在基于镓的催化剂上，丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应的烷基机制涉及丙烷在镓位点上的初始吸附，随后氢的去除形成镓二氢化物物种和烷氧基中间体。烷氧基然后脱附为烯烃，留下一个布隆斯特酸位点。这种机制适用于不同的镓物种结构，如[HGaH]+和[HGaX]+，其中X可以是CH3、OH或Cl。然而，烷基去除步骤的活化能非常高，导致烷基激活机制的内在反应速率很低。另一方面，卡宾机制涉及CH键的激活和类似烷氧基的中间体的形成，随后通过脱附烯烃去除初级烷氧基，以及通过脱附分子氢完成催化循环。CH激活步骤被提议为速率决定步骤(RDS)，因为它面临着非常高的活化能，特别是对于[HGaH]+位点。烷基机制不适用于[HGaH]+位点，因为活化能与实验值相比过高。
