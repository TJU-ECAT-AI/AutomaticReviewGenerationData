[1] "The authors concluded that the alkyl activation path for [HGaH]+ species is the actual path for dehydrogenation."
[2] "However, this conclusion was based on the observation that at higher temperatures, the initial CH activation step becomes the rate-determining step, and the calculated activation barrier (3940 kcal/mol) for this first step is in close agreement with the experimentally estimated value of 39 kcal/mol [20]."
[3] "We find that the activation energy for initial CH activation is substantially higher (48.66 kcal/mol) compared to their previously calculated [37] value of 37.9 kcal/mol."
[4] "We have located an additional transition state (TS2) for the rotation of the tetrahedral [H2GaC2H5] species."
[5] "The activation barrier for the alkyl desorption (process X ! TS4 in Fig. 3) was 61.67 kcal/mol, which is in close agreement with the previously reported [37] value of 60.7 kcal/mol."
[6] "This high activationbarrierfor thealkylremovalstepshouldleadtovery low intrinsic reaction rate for the alkyl activation mechanism."
[7] "We conclude from the previous literature, and from our extension here, that the single site, [HGaH]+, model does not represent the true mechanism for Ga-assisted dehydrogenation."
[8] "We find the energy barrier for CH activation is 85.72 kcal/mol, corresponding to the initial alkane adsorption and hydrogen removal."
[9] "The activation barrier for this step (process V + C2H6 ! TS11 in Fig. 7) is very high considering the other reaction paths we have presented so far."
[10] "The activation barrier for hydrogen removal is substantially smaller than that for CH activation."
[11] "The activation barrier for CH activation is directly related to the large endothermicity of the CH activation step (DE = 51.40 kcal/mol)."

1.The alkyl mechanism in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions on gallium-based catalysts involves the initial adsorption of propane on the [HGaH]+ species, followed by the activation of the CH bond, which becomes the rate-determining step (RDS) at higher temperatures. The calculated activation barrier for this first step is in close agreement with the experimentally estimated value. However, the activation energy for initial CH activation is substantially higher than previously calculated, and an additional transition state for the rotation of the tetrahedral [H2GaC2H5] species has been located. The activation barrier for the alkyl desorption step is also very high, leading to a very low intrinsic reaction rate for the alkyl activation mechanism. The single site, [HGaH]+, model does not represent the true mechanism for Ga-assisted dehydrogenation.
2.Compared to the carbenium mechanism, the alkyl mechanism has a higher activation barrier for the initial CH activation step, which becomes the rate-determining step at higher temperatures. The calculated activation barrier for this first step is in close agreement with the experimentally estimated value. However, the activation energy for initial CH activation is substantially higher than previously calculated, and an additional transition state for the rotation of the tetrahedral [H2GaC2H5] species has been located. The activation barrier for the alkyl desorption step is also very high, leading to a very low intrinsic reaction rate for the alkyl activation mechanism.
3.The CH activation step is proposed as the rate-determining step (RDS) because the activation barrier for this step is very high, and it becomes the rate-determining step at higher temperatures. The calculated activation barrier for this first step is in close agreement with the experimentally estimated value. However, the activation energy for initial CH activation is substantially higher than previously calculated, and an additional transition state for the rotation of the tetrahedral [H2GaC2H5] species has been located. The activation barrier for the alkyl desorption step is also very high, leading to a very low intrinsic reaction rate for the alkyl activation mechanism.
4.The alkyl mechanism applies to different Ga species structures, but the single site, [HGaH]+, model does not represent the true mechanism for Ga-assisted dehydrogenation. The activation energy for initial CH activation is substantially higher than previously calculated, and an additional transition state for the rotation of the tetrahedral [H2GaC2H5] species has been located. The activation barrier for the alkyl desorption step is also very high, leading to a very low intrinsic reaction rate for the alkyl activation mechanism.

1.在基于镓的催化剂上的丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应中，烷基机制涉及丙烷在[HGaH]+物种上的初始吸附，随后是CH键的活化，这在较高温度下成为速率决定步骤(RDS)。对于这第一步的计算活化能与实验估计值非常接近。然而，初始CH活化的活化能远高于以前的计算值，并且已经定位了四面体[H2GaC2H5]物种旋转的额外过渡态。烷基解吸步骤的活化能也非常高，导致烷基活化机制的内在反应速率非常低。单点[HGaH]+模型并不代表Ga辅助脱氢的真实机制。
