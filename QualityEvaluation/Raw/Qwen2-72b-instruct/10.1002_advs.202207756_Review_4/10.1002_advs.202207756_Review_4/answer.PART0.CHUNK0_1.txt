[1] "Similar to the carbenium mechanism, the alkyl mechanism could be at play regardless of the specific structure of active Ga species, on which propane is initially activated by the metal cation to form the alkyl gallium intermediate, followed by the β-elimination and the desorption of propylene and H2."
[2] "The CH activation step and the formation of an alkyl metal intermediate were proposed as the RDS, as shown in Scheme 2."
[3] "Schematic of proposed alkyl mechanisms for the PDH on a) Ga+, b) [GaH]+, and c) Ga2O22+."

The alkyl mechanism in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions on gallium-based catalysts involves the initial activation of propane by the metal cation, leading to the formation of an alkyl gallium intermediate. This intermediate then undergoes β-elimination, resulting in the desorption of propylene and hydrogen. The mechanism is applicable to various structures of active Ga species, including Ga+, [GaH]+, and Ga2O22+. The CH activation step, where propane is activated to form the alkyl metal intermediate, is proposed as the rate-determining step (RDS) in this mechanism. This step is crucial for the subsequent formation of propylene and hydrogen as products.

丙烷脱氢反应在镓基催化剂上的烷基机制涉及丙烷最初被金属阳离子激活，形成烷基镓中间体。该中间体随后经历β-消除，导致丙烯和氢的解吸。该机制适用于不同结构的活性Ga物种，包括Ga+、[GaH]+和Ga2O22+。CH活化步骤，即丙烷被激活形成烷基金属中间体的步骤，被提议为决定速率的步骤（RDS）在这一机制中。这个步骤对于随后形成丙烯和氢作为产物至关重要。
