[1] "Similar to the carbenium mechanism, the alkyl mechanism could be at play regardless of the specific structure of active Ga species, on which propane is initially activated by the metal cation to form the alkyl gallium intermediate, followed by the β-elimination and the desorption of propylene and H2."
[2] "The CH activation step and the formation of an alkyl metal intermediate were proposed as the RDS, as shown in Scheme 2."
[3] "Schematic of proposed alkyl mechanisms for the PDH on a) Ga+, b) [GaH]+, and c) Ga2O22+."
[4] "The key difference between the two mechanisms is the role of Ga species in PDH: facilitate the recombination of H adatoms to release H2 versus activate the CH bond in propane."

1.In the alkyl mechanism of propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions on gallium-based catalysts, propane is initially activated by the metal cation to form an alkyl gallium intermediate. This is followed by β-elimination and the desorption of propylene and hydrogen. The CH activation step and the formation of an alkyl metal intermediate are proposed as the rate-determining steps (RDS). The alkyl mechanism applies to different Ga species structures, including Ga+, [GaH]+, and Ga2O22+. In contrast to the carbenium mechanism, where Ga species facilitate the recombination of hydrogen adatoms to release hydrogen, the alkyl mechanism involves the activation of the CH bond in propane.

1.在基于镓的催化剂上丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应的烷基机制中，丙烷最初由金属阳离子激活，形成烷基镓中间体。随后是β-消除和丙烯和氢的解吸。CH活化步骤和烷基金属中间体的形成被提议为决定速率的步骤(RDS)。烷基机制适用于不同的Ga物种结构，包括Ga+、[GaH]+和Ga2O22+。与卡宾机制不同，其中Ga物种促进氢吸附原子的重组以释放氢气，烷基机制涉及丙烷中CH键的激活。
