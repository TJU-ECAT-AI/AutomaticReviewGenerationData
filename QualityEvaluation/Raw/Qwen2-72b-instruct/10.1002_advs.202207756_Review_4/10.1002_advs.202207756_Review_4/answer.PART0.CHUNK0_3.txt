[1] "Similar to the carbenium mechanism, the alkyl mechanism could be at play regardless of the specific structure of active Ga species, on which propane is initially activated by the metal cation to form the alkyl gallium intermediate, followed by the β-elimination and the desorption of propylene and H2. The CH activation step and the formation of an alkyl metal intermediate were proposed as the RDS, as shown in Scheme 2."
[2] "The key difference between the two mechanisms is the role of Ga species in PDH: facilitate the recombination of H adatoms to release H2 versus activate the CH bond in propane."
[3] "Scheme 2 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint Schematic of proposed alkyl mechanisms for the PDH on a) Ga+, b) [GaH]+, and c) Ga2O22+."

1.The alkyl mechanism in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions on gallium-based catalysts involves the initial activation of propane by the metal cation, forming an alkyl gallium intermediate. This is followed by β-elimination and the desorption of propylene and hydrogen. The CH activation step and the formation of an alkyl metal intermediate are considered the rate-determining steps (RDS). This mechanism applies to different Ga species structures, including Ga+, [GaH]+, and Ga2O22+. In contrast, the carbenium mechanism involves the role of Ga species in facilitating the recombination of hydrogen adatoms to release hydrogen, rather than activating the CH bond in propane.

1.在基于镓的催化剂上，丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应的烷基机制涉及金属阳离子最初活化丙烷，形成烷基镓中间体。随后是β-消除和丙烯和氢的解吸。CH活化步骤和烷基金属中间体的形成被认为是决定速率的步骤(RDS)。这种机制适用于不同的Ga物种结构，包括Ga+、[GaH]+和Ga2O22+。相比之下，卡宾机制涉及Ga物种在促进氢吸附原子的重组以释放氢气中的作用，而不是活化丙烷中的CH键。
