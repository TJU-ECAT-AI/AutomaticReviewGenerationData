Read the questions and answers provided below. First, critically assess the overall relevance of the answers provided to the set of questions asked.

If, upon your assessment, you find that the answers do not contain information that is relevant to the questions asked, stop your review process immediately and respond with a single sentence: "※※※※※※※The provided answers are not relevant to the questions.※※※※※※※". Do not provide any additional explanation or background information, only this sentence should be given as a response in case of irrelevant answers.

If, however, the answers are relevant to the questions asked, proceed to compile answers for each question according to the instructions below. Ensure to aggregate all the relevant answers from the multiple answer results provided in the document, and organize them sequentially by their order number, compiling the corresponding quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question.

If the provided answers' quotes are not differentiated by question, ensure to break them down and assign the quotes to each respective question, outputting them separately within each question's section.

To provide a comprehensive review, differentiate the responses into quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question based on the details given in the 'Answer' XML tags. Structure your review using the XML format showcased below if the answers are relevant to the questions asked:

Provide a comprehensive explanation of the alkyl mechanism in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions on gallium-based catalysts, detailing its key steps from initial propane activation to product formation. Compare this mechanism to the carbenium mechanism, discuss why the CH activation step is proposed as the rate-determining step (RDS), and explain how the alkyl mechanism applies to different Ga species structures.

1.Providing a comprehensive explanation of the alkyl mechanism in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions on gallium-based catalysts, detailing its key steps from initial propane activation to product formation, is not possible due to the absence of relevant quotes in the provided literature. Comparing this mechanism to the carbenium mechanism, discussing why the CH activation step is proposed as the rate-determining step (RDS), and explaining how the alkyl mechanism applies to different Ga species structures cannot be addressed as well due to the lack of pertinent information in the given document.

1.由于提供的文献中缺乏相关引述，无法全面解释基于镓催化剂的丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应中的烷基机制，从最初的丙烷活化到产物形成的关键步骤。同样，由于缺乏相关信息，无法将该机制与碳正离子机制进行比较，讨论为什么CH活化步骤被提议为速率决定步骤(RDS)，也无法解释烷基机制如何适用于不同的Ga物种结构。

1.Providing a comprehensive explanation of the alkyl mechanism in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions on gallium-based catalysts, detailing its key steps from initial propane activation to product formation, cannot be done as there are no relevant quotes from the literature provided. Comparing this mechanism to the carbenium mechanism, discussing why the CH activation step is proposed as the rate-determining step (RDS), and explaining how the alkyl mechanism applies to different Ga species structures also cannot be addressed due to the lack of relevant quotes.
