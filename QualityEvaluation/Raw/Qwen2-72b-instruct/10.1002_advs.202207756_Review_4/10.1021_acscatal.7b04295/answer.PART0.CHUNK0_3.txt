1.Providing a comprehensive explanation of the alkyl mechanism in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions on gallium-based catalysts, detailing its key steps from initial propane activation to product formation, cannot be done as there are no relevant quotes from the literature provided. Comparing this mechanism to the carbenium mechanism, discussing why the CH activation step is proposed as the rate-determining step (RDS), and explaining how the alkyl mechanism applies to different Ga species structures also cannot be addressed due to the lack of relevant quotes.

1.由于没有提供相关的文献引用，无法全面解释在基于镓的催化剂上丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应中的烷基机制，详细说明从初始丙烷活化到产物形成的关键步骤。同样，由于缺乏相关引用，无法将该机制与碳正离子机制进行比较，讨论为什么提出CH活化步骤作为速率决定步骤(RDS)，以及解释烷基机制如何适用于不同的Ga物种结构。
