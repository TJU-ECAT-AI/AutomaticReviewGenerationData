1.Providing a comprehensive explanation of the alkyl mechanism in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions on gallium-based catalysts, detailing its key steps from initial propane activation to product formation, is not possible due to the absence of relevant quotes in the provided literature. Comparing this mechanism to the carbenium mechanism, discussing why the CH activation step is proposed as the rate-determining step (RDS), and explaining how the alkyl mechanism applies to different Ga species structures cannot be addressed as well due to the lack of pertinent information in the given document.

1.由于提供的文献中缺乏相关引述，无法全面解释基于镓催化剂的丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应中的烷基机制，从最初的丙烷活化到产物形成的关键步骤。同样，由于缺乏相关信息，无法将该机制与碳正离子机制进行比较，讨论为什么CH活化步骤被提议为速率决定步骤(RDS)，也无法解释烷基机制如何适用于不同的Ga物种结构。
