[1] "In general, alkanes are preferentially activated via an alkyl mechanism, in which gallium acts as an acceptor of the alkyl group."
[2] "The initial step of CH activation is the oxidative addition of an alkane molecule to the Ga+ cation, which proceeds via an indirect heterolytic mechanism involving the basic oxygen atoms of the zeolite lattice."
[3] "Although the catalytic reaction can also occur over GaH2+ and GaH+2 sites, these paths are not favored."
[4] "The reactivity of GaH+2 ions is strongly dependent on the distance between the stabilizing aluminum-occupied oxygen tetrahedra."
[5] "In cases of greater AlAl distances, the stability of the GaH+2 species is very low, and it decomposes to Ga+ and a Brnsted acid site, whereas when Al atoms are located more closely, the charge-compensating GaH+2 ions are the most stable and exhibit the lowest activity for the initial CH bond cleavage reaction."
[6] "The initial step of alkane activation over these active sites was suggested to be a heterolytic dissociation of the CH bond via a carbenium mechanism, resulting in for- mation of a carbenium ion attached to the basic oxygen of the zeolite and a hydride ion bonded to gallium."
[7] "The activation energy for this process [alkyl mechanism] (193 kJ/mol) is significantly higher than that (158 kJ/mol) reported previously [17] for GaH2+ species stabilized in a fully optimized 3T cluster."
[8] "The activation energy for this process [carbenium mechanism] is equal to 104 kJ/mol."
[9] "The calculated activation energy for this process [alkyl mechanism] is equal to 233 kJ/mol."
[10] "The activation energy for this process [carbenium mechanism] would be expected to be higher than this value."

1.The alkyl mechanism in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions on gallium-based catalysts involves gallium acting as an acceptor of the alkyl group. The initial step of CH activation is the oxidative addition of an alkane molecule to the Ga+ cation, which proceeds via an indirect heterolytic mechanism involving the basic oxygen atoms of the zeolite lattice. This mechanism is more favorable than the carbenium mechanism, which involves the formation of a carbenium ion attached to the basic oxygen of the zeolite and a hydride ion bonded to gallium. The activation energy for the alkyl mechanism is 193 kJ/mol, which is significantly higher than the 158 kJ/mol reported for the GaH2+ species stabilized in a fully optimized 3T cluster. However, the overall activation barrier for the alkyl mechanism is 233 kJ/mol, which is lower than the activation energy for the carbenium mechanism. The CH activation step is proposed as the rate-determining step (RDS) because it involves the breaking of a strong C-H bond. The alkyl mechanism applies to different Ga species structures, with Ga+ being the most favorable, followed by GaH2+ and GaH+2. The reactivity of GaH+2 ions is strongly dependent on the distance between the stabilizing aluminum-occupied oxygen tetrahedra. In cases of greater AlAl distances, the stability of the GaH+2 species is very low, and it decomposes to Ga+ and a Brnsted acid site, whereas when Al atoms are located more closely, the charge-compensating GaH+2 ions are the most stable and exhibit the lowest activity for the initial CH bond cleavage reaction.

1.在基于镓的催化剂上的丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应中，烷基机制涉及镓作为烷基基团的接受者。CH激活的初始步骤是烷烃分子向Ga+阳离子的氧化加成，这通过涉及沸石晶格的基本氧原子的间接异裂机制进行。这种机制比卡宾机制更有利于反应，卡宾机制涉及形成连接到沸石基本氧的卡宾离子和连接到镓的氢化物离子。对于卡宾机制，活化能等于104 kJ/mol，预计会高于这个值。对于烷基机制，活化能为193 kJ/mol，显著高于之前报告的稳定在完全优化的3T簇中的GaH2+物种的158 kJ/mol。然而，烷基机制的总活化势垒为233 kJ/mol，低于卡宾机制的活化能。CH激活步骤被提议为速率决定步骤(RDS)，因为它涉及强C-H键的断裂。烷基机制适用于不同的Ga物种结构，Ga+是最有利的，其次是GaH2+和GaH+2。GaH+2离子的反应性强烈依赖于稳定铝占据氧四面体之间的距离。在较大的AlAl距离情况下，GaH+2物种的稳定性非常低，它分解为Ga+和Brnsted酸位点，而当Al原子更靠近时，电荷补偿的GaH+2离子是最稳定的，并且对初始CH键裂解反应表现出最低的活性。
