1.The alkyl mechanism in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions on gallium-based catalysts involves a complex scheme consisting of dehydrogenation, oligomerization, and ring closure steps. The initial step of CH activation is the oxidative addition of an alkane molecule to the Ga+ cation, which proceeds via an indirect heterolytic mechanism involving the basic oxygen atoms of the zeolite lattice. The activation energy for this process is computed as 224 kJ/mol. The overall activation energy of the ethane dehydrogenation over the reduced dehydrogenated Ga/ZSM-5 zeolite is 233 kJ/mol. The mechanism of the initial activation of the hydrocarbon molecule on dihydrido-gallyl ion is very similar to that suggested for the heterolytic dissociation of ethane on Ga Zd. The activation energy for this elementary step (193 kJ/mol) is significantly higher than that (158 kJ/mol) reported previously for GaH2+ species stabilized in a fully optimized 3T cluster. The activation energy for the process of simultaneous desorption of H2 and C2H4 from [HGaC2H5]+Z is 33 kJ/mol lower than that for regeneration of GaH2+ via desorption of ethylene. The activation energy for the process of initial activation of ethane on GaH+2 stabilized at the Zd cluster is equal to 104 kJ/mol. The activation energies and enthalpies for both the homolytic and heterolytic CH bond cleavage on Ga+ ion in Zs clusters are very similar to those calculated for the distantly separated Al atoms. The fraction of cation sites containing two aluminum atoms in the next-nearest positions is small, not exceeding 30% in a zeolite with an Si:Al ratio of 25. The reactivity of either Ga+ or GaH2+ in hydrocarbon activation exhibits very slight dependence on the distribution of aluminum in zeolite. The apparent activation barrier for this process estimated within the model used is equal to 233 kJ/mol. The apparent activation barrier estimated for ethane dehydrogenation over Ga2O3/HZSM-5 is significantly lower (163 kJ/mol) than this value.
2.The carbenium mechanism is a different pathway for hydrocarbon activation, involving the formation of a carbenium ion attached to the basic oxygen of the zeolite and a hydride ion bonded to gallium. The activation energy for this process is significantly higher than that for the alkyl mechanism, making the alkyl mechanism more favorable. The CH activation step is proposed as the rate-determining step (RDS) because it involves the initial cleavage of the C-H bond, which is the most energy-demanding step in the reaction. The alkyl mechanism applies to different Ga species structures, including Ga+, GaH2+, and GaH+2, with Ga+ being the most probable active species for hydrocarbon dehydrogenation.

1.丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应在镓基催化剂上的烷基机制涉及一个复杂的方案，包括脱氢、寡聚化和环闭合步骤。CH激活的初始步骤是烷烃分子向Ga+阳离子的氧化加成，这通过涉及沸石晶格的基本氧原子的间接异裂机制进行。该过程的活化能计算为224 kJ/mol。在还原脱氢的Ga/ZSM-5沸石上，乙烷脱氢的总活化能为233 kJ/mol。在二氢化镓离子上的烃分子初始激活机制与在Ga Zd上乙烷异裂机制的建议非常相似。该基本步骤的活化能(193 kJ/mol)显著高于先前为稳定在完全优化的3T簇中的GaH2+物种报告的值(158 kJ/mol)。同时从[HGaC2H5]+Z中脱除H2和C2H4的过程的活化能比通过脱除乙烯再生GaH2+的活化能低33 kJ/mol。在稳定在Zd簇上的GaH+2上乙烷初始激活的过程的活化能等于104 kJ/mol。在Zs簇中Ga+离子的同裂和异裂CH键裂解的活化能和焓与为远距离分离的Al原子计算的那些非常相似。含有在最近邻位置的两个铝原子的阳离子位点的分数很小，在Si:Al比为25的沸石中不超过30%。在烃激活中，无论是Ga+还是GaH2+的反应性对沸石中铝的分布的依赖性都非常小。在所用模型中估计的该过程的表观活化能等于233 kJ/mol。在Ga2O3/HZSM-5上估计的乙烷脱氢的表观活化能显著低于(163 kJ/mol)这个值。
2.卡宾机制是烃激活的不同途径，涉及形成连接到沸石的基本氧的卡宾离子和连接到镓的氢化离子。该过程的活化能显著高于烷基机制，使烷基机制更有利于反应。CH激活步骤被提议为速率决定步骤(RDS)，因为它涉及C-H键的初始裂解，这是反应中最耗能的步骤。烷基机制适用于不同的Ga物种结构，包括Ga+、GaH2+和GaH+2，其中Ga+是最可能的烃脱氢活性物种。
