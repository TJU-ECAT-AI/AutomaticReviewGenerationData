[1] "In general, alkanes are preferentially activated via an alkyl mechanism, in which gallium acts as an acceptor of the alkyl group."
[2] "A comparison of the computed energetics of the various reaction paths for ethane indicates that the catalytic reaction most likely proceeds over Ga+. The initial step of CH activation is the oxidative addition of an alkane molecule to the Ga+ cation, which proceeds via an indirect heterolytic mechanism involving the basic oxygen atoms of the zeolite lattice."
[3] "The recent experimental results indicating that Ga+ cations are the active sites [1416] led us to reconsider the reaction mechanism of alkane activation over reduced Ga cations stabi- lized in zeolites."
[4] "The mechanism of the initial activation of the hydrocarbon molecule on dihydrido-gallyl ion is very similar to that suggested for the het- erolytic dissociation of ethane on Ga Zd."
[5] "The H2GaC2H6 species formed in the initial step are stabi- lized by interaction between a hydride ion (H1) bonded to the gallium and an acidic proton (H1). This interaction results in a strong elongation (by about 0.2 Å) of the O1H1 bond."
[6] "The calculated activation barrier (TS5) for this process is equal to 2 kJ/mol."
[7] "The activation energy for this process was 257 kJ/mol, in an excellent agreement with the previously reported values of 258 kJ/mol [22] and 254 kJ/mol [17]."
[8] "However, Table 3 shows that both the abstracting H atom of the β-methyl group and the gallium ion are positively charged. Thus, regeneration of the GaH2+ active site requires repolarization of the CH bond,a process that appears to be unfavorable."
[9] "The elementary steps and the reaction energy diagrams for the carbenium and alkyl pathways of ethane activation over GaH Zd cluster are shown in Fig. 4, routes (a) and (b), respec- tively."
[10] "The calculated activation energy for this process [IV VI; Fig. 4, route (b)] is equal to 104 kJ/mol."
[11] "It was also found that the product (V) of carbenium acti- vation of C2H6 on GaH Zd is just 14 kJ/mol less stable than structure VI [Fig. 4 routes (a) and (b), respectively]."
[12] "The activation energies and enthalpies for both the ho- molytic and heterolytic CH bond cleavage on Ga+ ion in Zs clusters are very similar to those calculated for the distantly separated Al atoms."
[13] "The fraction of cation sites containing two aluminum atoms in the next-nearest positions is small; for instance, in a zeolite with an Si:Al ratio of 25, it does not exceed 30% [43]."
[14] "The reactivity of either Ga+ or GaH2+ in hydrocarbon activation exhibits very slight dependence on the distribution of aluminum in zeolite."
[15] "The apparent activation barrier for this process estimated within the model used is equal to 233 kJ/mol."

1.The alkyl mechanism in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions on gallium-based catalysts involves gallium acting as an acceptor of the alkyl group. The initial step of CH activation is the oxidative addition of an alkane molecule to the Ga+ cation, which proceeds via an indirect heterolytic mechanism involving the basic oxygen atoms of the zeolite lattice. The H2GaC2H6 species formed in the initial step are stabilized by interaction between a hydride ion (H1) bonded to the gallium and an acidic proton (H1). The calculated activation barrier (TS5) for this process is equal to 2 kJ/mol. The activation energy for regeneration of the GaH2+ active site is 257 kJ/mol, which is unfavorable due to the need for repolarization of the CH bond. The carbenium pathway is less stable than the alkyl pathway by 14 kJ/mol. The reactivity of Ga+ or GaH2+ in hydrocarbon activation exhibits very slight dependence on the distribution of aluminum in zeolite. The apparent activation barrier for this process estimated within the model used is equal to 233 kJ/mol.
2.Comparing the alkyl mechanism to the carbenium mechanism, the alkyl mechanism is more favorable due to the lower activation barrier and the stability of the H2GaC2H6 species. The CH activation step is proposed as the rate-determining step (RDS) because it involves the oxidative addition of an alkane molecule to the Ga+ cation, which proceeds via an indirect heterolytic mechanism involving the basic oxygen atoms of the zeolite lattice. The alkyl mechanism applies to different Ga species structures, including Ga+, GaH2+, and GaH+2, with Ga+ being the most favorable due to its lower activation barrier and higher stability.

1.在基于镓的催化剂上的丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应中，烷基机制涉及镓作为烷基基团的受体。CH激活的初始步骤是烷烃分子向Ga+阳离子的氧化加成，这通过涉及沸石晶格的基本氧原子的间接异裂机制进行。在初始步骤中形成的H2GaC2H6物种通过与镓结合的氢化物离子(H1)和酸性质子(H1)之间的相互作用稳定。该过程的计算活化能(TS5)等于2 kJ/mol。再生GaH2+活性位点的活化能为257 kJ/mol，由于需要CH键的再极化，这是不利的。卡宾路径比烷基路径不稳定14 kJ/mol。在沸石中铝分布的Ga+或GaH2+在烃类活化中的反应性表现出非常轻微的依赖性。在所使用的模型中估计的该过程的表观活化能等于233 kJ/mol。
2.将烷基机制与卡宾机制进行比较，烷基机制由于较低的活化能和H2GaC2H6物种的稳定性而更有利。由于涉及烷烃分子向Ga+阳离子的氧化加成，这通过涉及沸石晶格的基本氧原子的间接异裂机制进行，CH激活步骤被提议为速率决定步骤(RDS)。烷基机制适用于不同的Ga物种结构，包括Ga+、GaH2+和GaH+2，其中Ga+由于其较低的活化能和较高的稳定性而最有利。
3.烷基机制适用于不同的Ga物种结构，包括Ga+、GaH2+和GaH+2，其中Ga+由于其较低的活化能和较高的稳定性而最有利。含有两个最近邻位置的铝原子的阳离子位点的分数很小，Ga+或GaH2+在烃类活化中的反应性对沸石中铝分布的依赖性非常小。在所使用的模型中估计的该过程的表观活化能等于233 kJ/mol。
