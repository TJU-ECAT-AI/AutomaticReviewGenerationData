1.The alkyl mechanism in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions on gallium-based catalysts involves gallium acting as an acceptor of the alkyl group. The catalytic reaction most likely proceeds over Ga+. The initial step of CH activation is the oxidative addition of an alkane molecule to the Ga+ cation, which proceeds via an indirect heterolytic mechanism involving the basic oxygen atoms of the zeolite lattice. The reaction mechanism is thought to consist of a complex scheme involving dehydrogenation, oligomerization, and ring-closure steps. The modifying cations play key roles in dehydrogenation of paraffins.
2.Although the catalytic reaction can also occur over GaH2+ and GaH+2 sites, these paths are not favored. The reactivity of GaH+2 ions is strongly dependent on the distance between the stabilizing aluminum-occupied oxygen tetrahedra. In cases of greater AlAl distances, the stability of the GaH+2 species is very low, and it decomposes to Ga+ and a Brnsted acid site, whereas when Al atoms are located more closely, the charge-compensating GaH+2 ions are the most stable and exhibit the lowest activity for the initial CH bond cleavage reaction.
3.The probable catalytic cycle starts with the heterolytic CH bond cleavage involving exchanged univalent gallium cation and a basic oxygen atom of the zeolite framework. The low energy of the d-orbitals of Ga+ and its occupied s-orbital that make them unable to donate or accept electrons,respectively, from the hydrocarbon result in a high barrier for the direct oxidative addition of ethane to the cation. Therefore,heterolytic splitting of the CH bond is much more favorable due to the polarization induced by the interaction of the hydrocarbon with the Ga...O Lewis acidbase pair.
4.The resulting product easily rearranges to form [HGaC2H5]+, which decomposes via simultaneous desorption of H2 and C2H4, regenerating the initial Ga+ species. The overall activation barrier for C2H6 dehydrogenation over Ga+Zsites is equal to 233 kJ/mol.
5.Hydrogenated gallium species (GaH2+Zand ZGaH+2Z) are less likely active sites. Decomposition of the dihydrido-gallyl ions, resulting in formation of univalent gallium ions during the catalytic cycle, is significantly favored over regeneration of GaH2+ sites. In addition, the estimated overall activation barrier for the considered catalytic reaction is higher (by 58 kJ/mol) for GaH2+ sites than for Ga+ sites.
6.Bivalent GaH+2 species stabilized at the cation site with distantly separated framework Al sites exhibit significantly higher initial activity for ethane activation but much lower stability compared with Ga+ sites. However, initial heterolytic cleavage of the CH bond results in formation of [HGaC2H5]+ ions that preferentially follow the reaction path, again leading to univalent gallium cations.
7.On the other hand, GaH+2 ions charge-compensating two proximate framework aluminum ions are the most stable cationic species; however, initial activation of the CH bond over these sites is strongly disfavored both thermodynamically and kinetically. In contrast, the reactivity of univalent gallium species exchanged in zeolite depends only slightly on the relative position of zeolitic anionic sites ([AlO2]units).

1.丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应中,在镓基催化剂上,烷基机制涉及镓作为烷基基团的受体。催化反应最有可能通过Ga+进行。CH活化的初始步骤是烷烃分子氧化加到Ga+阳离子上,通过涉及沸石晶格的基本氧原子的间接异裂机制进行。反应机制被认为由一个复杂的方案组成,涉及脱氢、寡聚化和环闭合步骤。修饰阳离子在石蜡脱氢中起关键作用。
2.尽管催化反应也可以在GaH2+和GaH+2位点上发生,但这些路径不受欢迎。GaH+2离子的反应性强烈依赖于稳定铝占据氧四面体之间的距离。在更大的AlAl距离情况下,GaH+2物种的稳定性非常低,并分解为Ga+和Brnsted酸位点,而当Al原子更靠近时,补偿电荷的GaH+2离子是最稳定的,并且对初始CH键裂解反应表现出最低的活性。
3.可能的催化循环从涉及交换的单价镓阳离子和沸石框架的基本氧原子的异裂CH键裂解开始。Ga+的d轨道的低能量和其占据的s轨道使它们无法从烃中捐赠或接受电子,分别地,导致乙烷直接氧化加到阳离子上的高势垒。因此,由于烃与Ga...O Lewis酸碱对的相互作用引起的极化,CH键的异裂更有利于。
4.生成的产品容易重排形成[HGaC2H5]+,通过H2和C2H4的同时解吸分解,再生初始Ga+物种。C2H6在Ga+Z位点上的脱氢的总活化势垒等于233 kJ/mol。
5.氢化镓物种(GaH2+Z和ZGaH+2Z)不太可能是活性位点。在催化循环中,二氢化镓离子的分解,导致单价镓离子的形成,与GaH2+位点的再生相比,显著有利。此外,对于GaH2+位点,所考虑的催化反应的总活化势垒比Ga+位点高(58 kJ/mol)。
6.在与框架Al位点相距较远的阳离子位点上稳定的二价GaH+2物种在乙烷活化方面表现出显著的初始活性,但与Ga+物种相比,稳定性要低得多。然而,CH键的初始异裂导致形成[HGaC2H5]+离子,这些离子优先遵循反应路径,再次导致单价镓阳离子。
7.另一方面,补偿两个相邻框架铝离子的GaH+2离子是最稳定的阳离子物种;然而,在这些位点上CH键的初始活化在热力学和动力学上都强烈不利。相比之下,在沸石中交换的单价镓物种的反应性仅轻微依赖于沸石阴离子位点([AlO2]单元)的相对位置。
