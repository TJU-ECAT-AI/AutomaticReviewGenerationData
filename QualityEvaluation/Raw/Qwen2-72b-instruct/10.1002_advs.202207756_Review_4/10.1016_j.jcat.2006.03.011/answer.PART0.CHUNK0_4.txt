[1] "The reaction mechanism is thought to consist of a complex scheme involving dehydrogenation, oligomerization, and ring- closure steps [216]."
[2] "The modifying cations play key roles in dehydrogenation of paraffins [25,1416], whereas Brnsted acid protons catalyze the oligomerization of the olefins thus produced and possibly their subsequent aromatization."
[3] "The initial step of CH activation is the oxidative addition of an alkane molecule to the Ga+ cation, which proceeds via an indirect heterolytic mechanism involving the basic oxygen atoms of the zeolite lattice."
[4] "The activation energy for this process was 257 kJ/mol, in an excellent agreement with the previously reported values of 258 kJ/mol [22] and 254 kJ/mol [17]."
[5] "The initial step of alkane activation over these active sites was suggested to be a heterolytic dissociation of the CH bond via a carbenium mechanism, resulting in for- mation of a carbenium ion attached to the basic oxygen of the zeolite and a hydride ion bonded to gallium (GaH Zd + C2H6 V) [Fig. 4, route (a)]."
[6] "The calculated activation energy for this process [IV VI; Fig. 4, route (b)] is equal to 104 kJ/mol."
[7] "The activation energy for the carbenium initial acti- vation of ethane on GaH Zs was not identified. However, the enthalpy of this process is equal to +274 kJ/mol; therefore,the activation energy would be expected to be higher than this value."
[8] "The activation energy for production of Ga+ from [HGaC2H5]+ following reaction (5) is 33 kJ/mol lower than that for regeneration of GaH2+ via desorption of ethyl- ene (6)."
[9] "The overall activation barrier for C2H6 dehydrogenation over Ga+Zsites is equal to 233 kJ/mol."
[10] "The estimated overall acti- vation barrier for the considered catalytic reaction is higher (by 58 kJ/mol) for GaH2+ sites than for Ga+ sites."

1.The alkyl mechanism in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions on gallium-based catalysts involves a complex scheme consisting of dehydrogenation, oligomerization, and ring closure steps. The modifying cations play a key role in the dehydrogenation of paraffins, while Brnsted acid protons catalyze the oligomerization of the olefins produced and possibly their subsequent aromatization. The initial step of CH activation is the oxidative addition of an alkane molecule to the Ga+ cation, which proceeds via an indirect heterolytic mechanism involving the basic oxygen atoms of the zeolite lattice. The activation energy for this process is relatively high, making it the rate-determining step (RDS). The alkyl mechanism applies to different Ga species structures, including Ga+, GaH2+, and GaH+2. The activation energy for the alkyl mechanism is lower than that for the carbenium mechanism, making it the preferred pathway for propane dehydrogenation on gallium-based catalysts.
2.Compared to the carbenium mechanism, the alkyl mechanism has a lower activation energy, making it the preferred pathway for propane dehydrogenation on gallium-based catalysts. The carbenium mechanism involves the heterolytic dissociation of the CH bond via a carbenium mechanism, resulting in the formation of a carbenium ion attached to the basic oxygen of the zeolite and a hydride ion bonded to gallium. However, the activation energy for this process is higher than that for the alkyl mechanism, making it less favorable. The alkyl mechanism applies to different Ga species structures, including Ga+, GaH2+, and GaH+2, with the activation energy for the alkyl mechanism being lower for Ga+ sites than for GaH2+ sites.
3.The CH activation step is proposed as the rate-determining step (RDS) because it involves the oxidative addition of an alkane molecule to the Ga+ cation, which proceeds via an indirect heterolytic mechanism involving the basic oxygen atoms of the zeolite lattice. The activation energy for this process is relatively high, making it the rate-determining step. The alkyl mechanism applies to different Ga species structures, including Ga+, GaH2+, and GaH+2, with the activation energy for the alkyl mechanism being lower for Ga+ sites than for GaH2+ sites.
4.The alkyl mechanism applies to different Ga species structures, including Ga+, GaH2+, and GaH+2. The activation energy for the alkyl mechanism is lower for Ga+ sites than for GaH2+ sites, making it the preferred pathway for propane dehydrogenation on gallium-based catalysts. The activation energy for the alkyl mechanism is also lower than that for the carbenium mechanism, making it the preferred pathway for propane dehydrogenation on gallium-based catalysts.
