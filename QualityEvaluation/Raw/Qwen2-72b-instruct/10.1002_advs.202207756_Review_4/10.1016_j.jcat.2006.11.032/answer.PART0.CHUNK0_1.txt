[1] "The two basic mechanisms of CH activationcarbenium activation and alkyl activationare shown in Schemes 2 and 3,respectively."
[2] "The carbenium activation involves CH bond po- larization in such a way that the carbon atom assumes a positive partial charge (δ+) and hydrogen assumes a negative partial charge (δ). Carbenium activation leads to the formation of alkoxide and metal hydride (MH) as an intermediate."
[3] "In contrast, alkyl activation (Scheme 3) involves CH polarization in such a way that the carbon develops a negative (δ) charge and the hydrogen develops a positive (δ+) charge. Alkyl activation leads to the formation of a metal-alkyl (MCnH2n+1) and the Brnsted acid as intermediates."
[4] "We investigated both mecha- nisms for all of the clusters discussed so far, and we discuss the results next."
[5] "The first step involves the opening of the GaO coordination (A + C2H6 [B] D in Scheme 2) to form the activated intermediate D."
[6] "The intermediate D further undergoes carbenium activation,as shown in Scheme 2 (D [E] F)."
[7] "Carbenium activation is followed by the desorption of an alkene (ethene) from the alkoxide intermediate (F [I] J K + C2H4), leaving behind the Brnsted acid site."
[8] "The intermediate D further undergoes alkyl activation as shown in Scheme 3 (D [E] F)."
[9] "Alkyl activation is followed by desorption of an alkene (ethene) from the Gaalkyl intermediate (F [I] J K + C2H4), leaving behind the gallium dihydride species ([GaH2]+Z m)."
[10] "The overall carbenium activation barrier (CEa) decreases rapidly with decreasing (more exothermic) heat of reduction (H 0 red)."
[11] "A linear Polanyi relation [47] between the overall alkyl activa- tion barrier (AEa) and the heat of reduction (H 0 red) is seen."
[12] "Although alkyl activation is much more facile than the carbenium activation, ethene removal from [HGaC2H5]+Z m intermediate faces a very high activation bar- rier of 60 kcal/mol."
[13] "Thus, we conclude that this intermediate will be a spectator species while dominating the surface inter- mediates."
[14] "This conclusion agrees well with recent experimental observations [26]."

1.Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions on gallium-based catalysts involve two basic mechanisms of CH activation: carbenium activation and alkyl activation. Carbenium activation polarizes the CH bond so that carbon assumes a positive partial charge and hydrogen assumes a negative partial charge. This leads to the formation of alkoxide and metal hydride (MH) as intermediates. Alkyl activation, in contrast, polarizes the CH bond so that carbon develops a negative charge and hydrogen develops a positive charge. This leads to the formation of a metal-alkyl (MCnH2n+1) and a Brnsted acid as intermediates. Both mechanisms were investigated for all clusters discussed in the literature. The first step of both mechanisms involves the opening of the GaO coordination to form an activated intermediate D. Carbenium activation then proceeds with the formation of an alkoxide intermediate, followed by the desorption of an alkene (ethene) leaving behind a Brnsted acid site. Alkyl activation leads to the formation of a Gaalkyl intermediate, followed by the desorption of an alkene leaving behind a gallium dihydride species. The overall carbenium activation barrier decreases rapidly with decreasing heat of reduction, while a linear Polanyi relation is seen between the overall alkyl activation barrier and the heat of reduction. Although alkyl activation is more facile than carbenium activation, ethene removal from the [HGaC2H5]+Z m intermediate faces a very high activation barrier of 60 kcal/mol, making this intermediate a spectator species while dominating the surface intermediates. This conclusion is supported by recent experimental observations.

2.Comparing the carbenium and alkyl mechanisms, alkyl activation is much more facile than carbenium activation. However, ethene removal from the [HGaC2H5]+Z m intermediate faces a very high activation barrier of 60 kcal/mol, making this step the rate-determining step (RDS) for the alkyl mechanism. The CH activation step is not proposed as the RDS for the alkyl mechanism, as it is more facile than the carbenium activation step.

3.The alkyl mechanism applies to different Ga species structures, as it was investigated for all clusters discussed in the literature. The overall alkyl activation barrier is linearly correlated with the heat of reduction, indicating that the activity of the Ga species is strongly correlated with its stability. The less stable Ga species show lower activation barriers for alkyl activation.

1.在基于镓的催化剂上的丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应涉及两种基本的CH活化机制:卡宾活化和烷基活化。卡宾活化使CH键极化,使碳原子具有正的部分电荷,而氢原子具有负的部分电荷。这导致形成醇酸盐和金属氢化物(MH)作为中间体。相比之下,烷基活化使CH键极化,使碳具有负电荷,而氢具有正电荷。这导致形成金属烷基(MCnH2n+1)和布伦斯特酸作为中间体。两种机制都针对文献中讨论的所有簇进行了研究。两种机制的第一步都涉及GaO配位的开放,形成活化中间体D。卡宾活化随后形成醇酸盐中间体,然后是烯烃(乙烯)的解吸,留下布伦斯特酸位点。烷基活化导致形成Gaalkyl中间体,然后是烯烃的解吸,留下镓二氢化物物种。总体卡宾活化势垒随着还原热的降低而迅速降低,而总体烷基活化势垒与还原热之间存在线性波拉尼关系。尽管烷基活化比卡宾活化更容易,但乙烯从[HGaC2H5]+Z m中间体的去除面临着60 kcal/mol的非常高的活化势垒,使该中间体成为表面中间体的主导,但却是旁观者物种。这一结论与最近的实验观察结果一致。

2.比较卡宾和烷基机制,烷基活化比卡宾活化容易得多。然而,乙烯从[HGaC2H5]+Z m中间体的去除面临着60 kcal/mol的非常高的活化势垒,使这一步成为烷基机制的速率决定步骤(RDS)。CH活化步骤没有被提议为烷基机制的RDS,因为它比卡宾活化步骤更容易。

3.烷基机制适用于不同的Ga物种结构,因为它针对文献中讨论的所有簇进行了研究。总体烷基活化势垒与还原热线性相关,表明Ga物种的活性与其稳定性密切相关。较不稳定的Ga物种显示出较低的烷基活化势垒。
