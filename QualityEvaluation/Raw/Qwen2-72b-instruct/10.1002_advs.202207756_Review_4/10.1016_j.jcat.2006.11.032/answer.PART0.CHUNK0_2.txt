[1] "The two basic mechanisms of CH activationcarbenium activation and alkyl activationare shown in Schemes 2 and 3,respectively."
[2] "The carbenium activation involves CH bond po- larization in such a way that the carbon atom assumes a positive partial charge (δ+) and hydrogen assumes a negative partial charge (δ). Carbenium activation leads to the formation of alkoxide and metal hydride (MH) as an intermediate."
[3] "In contrast, alkyl activation (Scheme 3) involves CH polarization in such a way that the carbon develops a negative (δ) charge and the hydrogen develops a positive (δ+) charge. Alkyl activation leads to the formation of a metal-alkyl (MCnH2n+1) and the Brnsted acid as intermediates."
[4] "We investigated both mecha- nisms for all of the clusters discussed so far, and we discuss the results next."
[5] "The first step involves the opening of the GaO coordination (A + C2H6 [B] D in Scheme 2) to form the activated intermediate D."
[6] "The intermediate D further undergoes carbenium activation,as shown in Scheme 2 (D [E] F)."
[7] "Carbenium activation is followed by the desorption of an alkene (ethene) from the alkoxide intermediate (F [I] J K + C2H4), leaving behind the Brnsted acid site."
[8] "The intermediate D further undergoes alkyl activation as shown in Scheme 3 (D [E] F)."
[9] "Alkyl activation is followed by desorption of an alkene (ethene) from the Gaalkyl intermediate (F [I] J K + C2H4), leaving behind the gallium dihydride species ([GaH2]+Z m)."
[10] "The free energies of carbenium activation (A + C2H6 E, CG0 a) for four differ- ent reaction paths are 85.4, 81.4, 92.3, and 81.7 kcal/mol."
[11] "The free energies of carbenium activation (CG0 a) for the two mechanistic paths (A + C2H6 E in Scheme 2) are 96.4 and 99.2 kcal/mol."
[12] "The free energies of carbenium activation (CG0 a) for the two pathways are 61.1 and 58.4 kcal/mol."
[13] "The free energy activation barriers (66.4, 61.9, 66.6, and 54.7 kcal/mol) are lower than those for carbenium activation."
[14] "The free energy barriers (AG0 a) of 69.6 and 73.8 kcal/mol, with ethene removal barriers of 60.5 and 54.7 kcal/mol."
[15] "The free energy barriers (AG0 a) are 64.7, 67.9, 69.3, and 70.2 kcal/mol, with ethene removal barriers of ca. 62 kcal/mol."
[16] "The free energy activation barriers to be 42.5 and 37.7 kcal/mol."
[17] "The alkyl activation barriers (AG0 a) are 29.0 and 27.0 kcal/mol."
[18] "The barriers for the forma- tion of the undercoordinated GaH species are relatively higher."
[19] "The ethene desorption barriers are 65.5 and 66.8 kcal/mol for this particular site."
[20] "Thus, alkene desorption is a rate-limiting step for the overall alkyl activation catalytic cycle irrespec- tive of the activity of the particular catalytic site."
[21] "Recently, Pidko et al. [42] reported a novel one-step H2 and C2H4 de- sorption pathway from gallium alkyl intermediate."
[22] "This path- way involves a cyclic transition state with an activation bar- rier of 53.5 kcal/mol."
[23] "We also calculated an activation bar- rier of 54.6 kcal/mol using a single-framework substitution model of the active site as described previously [33]."
[24] "Thus, this mechanism of decomposition should set a lower limit of about 55 kcal/mol for the apparent activation barrier."

1.The alkyl mechanism in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions on gallium-based catalysts involves the initial activation of propane through CH bond polarization, where the carbon develops a negative charge and the hydrogen develops a positive charge. This leads to the formation of a metal-alkyl (MCnH2n+1) and a Brnsted acid as intermediates. The activated intermediate D undergoes alkyl activation, resulting in the formation of a Gaalkyl species and a Brnsted acid site. Subsequently, an alkene (ethene) is desorbed from the Gaalkyl intermediate, leaving behind a gallium dihydride species ([GaH2]+Z m). The carbenium mechanism, in contrast, involves CH bond polarization where the carbon assumes a positive charge and hydrogen assumes a negative charge, leading to the formation of alkoxide and metal hydride (MH) intermediates. The CH activation step is proposed as the rate-determining step (RDS) because it involves the breaking of the strong C-H bond. The alkyl mechanism applies to different Ga species structures, with the activation barriers varying depending on the stability of the Ga species. For instance, the free energy barriers for alkyl activation are lower than those for carbenium activation, indicating that the alkyl mechanism is more facile. However, the ethene desorption step from the Gaalkyl species faces a very high activation barrier of about 60 kcal/mol, making it the rate-limiting step for the overall alkyl activation catalytic cycle. A novel one-step H2 and C2H4 desorption pathway from the gallium alkyl intermediate has been reported, involving a cyclic transition state with an activation barrier of 53.5 kcal/mol. This mechanism of decomposition sets a lower limit of about 55 kcal/mol for the apparent activation barrier.

1.在基于镓的催化剂上的丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应中，烷基机制涉及通过CH键极化对丙烷进行初始激活，其中碳发展出负电荷，氢发展出正电荷。这导致形成金属-烷基(MCnH2n+1)和布伦斯特酸作为中间体。激活的中间体D经历烷基激活，形成Ga烷基物种和布伦斯特酸位点。随后，从Ga烷基中间体中脱附出一个烯烃(乙烯)，留下一个镓二氢物种([GaH2]+Z m)。相比之下，卡宾机制涉及CH键极化，其中碳承担正电荷，氢承担负电荷，导致形成醇酸盐和金属氢化物(MH)中间体。CH激活步骤被提议为速率决定步骤(RDS)，因为它涉及断裂强的C-H键。烷基机制适用于不同的Ga物种结构，激活势垒根据Ga物种的稳定性而变化。例如，烷基激活的自由能势垒低于卡宾激活，表明烷基机制更易进行。然而，从Ga烷基物种中脱附乙烯的步骤面临着约60 kcal/mol的极高激活势垒，使其成为整体烷基激活催化循环的速率限制步骤。最近报道了一种从镓烷基中间体中一步脱附H2和C2H4的新途径，涉及一个环状过渡态，具有53.5 kcal/mol的激活势垒。这种分解机制为表观活化势垒设定了约55 kcal/mol的下限。
