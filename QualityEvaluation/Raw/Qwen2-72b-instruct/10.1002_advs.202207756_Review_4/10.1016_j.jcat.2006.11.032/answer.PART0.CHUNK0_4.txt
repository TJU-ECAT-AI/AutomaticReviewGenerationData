[1] "The two basic mechanisms of CH activationcarbenium activation and alkyl activationare shown in Schemes 2 and 3,respectively."
[2] "The carbenium activation involves CH bond po- larization in such a way that the carbon atom assumes a positive partial charge (δ+) and hydrogen assumes a negative partial charge (δ). Carbenium activation leads to the formation of alkoxide and metal hydride (MH) as an intermediate."
[3] "In contrast, alkyl activation (Scheme 3) involves CH polarization in such a way that the carbon develops a negative (δ) charge and the hydrogen develops a positive (δ+) charge. Alkyl activation leads to the formation of a metal-alkyl (MCnH2n+1) and the Brnsted acid as intermediates."
[4] "We investigated both mecha- nisms for all of the clusters discussed so far, and we discuss the results next."
[5] "The first step involves the opening of the GaO coordination (A + C2H6 [B] D in Scheme 2) to form the activated intermediate D."
[6] "The intermediate D further undergoes carbenium activation,as shown in Scheme 2 (D [E] F)."
[7] "Carbenium activation is followed by the desorption of an alkene (ethene) from the alkoxide intermediate (F [I] J K + C2H4), leaving behind the Brnsted acid site."
[8] "The intermediate D further undergoes alkyl activation as shown in Scheme 3 (D [E] F)."
[9] "Alkyl activation is followed by desorption of an alkene (ethene) from the Gaalkyl intermediate (F [I] J K + C2H4), leaving behind the gallium dihydride species ([GaH2]+Z m)."
[10] "The overall carbenium activation barrier (CEa) decreases rapidly with decreasing (more exothermic) heat of reduction (H 0 red). The less stable sites (Z4a, Z8a, and Z8b) show lower activation bar- riers."
[11] "A linear Polanyi relation [47] between the overall alkyl activa- tion barrier (AEa) and the heat of reduction (H 0 red) is seen."
[12] "Despite the lower activation barrier for dissociation of the CH bond, the rate-limiting step of alkene removal has an activation barrier of about 60 kcal/mol."
[13] "The comparison clearly indicates that the carbenium activation mechanism is more facile dehydro- genation mechanism near the optimum region indicated by the cross-section of the two Polanyi relations."

1.The two basic mechanisms of CH activation are carbenium activation and alkyl activation. Carbenium activation involves CH bond polarization where the carbon atom assumes a positive partial charge and hydrogen assumes a negative partial charge. This leads to the formation of alkoxide and metal hydride as intermediates. Alkyl activation, on the other hand, involves CH polarization where the carbon develops a negative charge and the hydrogen develops a positive charge. This leads to the formation of a metal-alkyl and the Brnsted acid as intermediates. Both mechanisms have been investigated for all the clusters discussed in the literature.
2.The carbenium activation mechanism begins with the opening of the GaO coordination to form the activated intermediate D. This intermediate then undergoes carbenium activation, leading to the formation of alkoxide and metal hydride intermediates. Carbenium activation is followed by the desorption of an alkene (ethene) from the alkoxide intermediate, leaving behind the Brnsted acid site.
3.The alkyl activation mechanism also begins with the opening of the GaO coordination to form the activated intermediate D. This intermediate then undergoes alkyl activation, leading to the formation of a metal-alkyl and the Brnsted acid as intermediates. Alkyl activation is followed by the desorption of an alkene (ethene) from the Gaalkyl intermediate, leaving behind the gallium dihydride species.
4.The overall carbenium activation barrier decreases rapidly with decreasing heat of reduction. The less stable sites (Z4a, Z8a, and Z8b) show lower activation barriers. A linear Polanyi relation is seen between the overall alkyl activation barrier and the heat of reduction. Despite the lower activation barrier for dissociation of the CH bond, the rate-limiting step of alkene removal has an activation barrier of about 60 kcal/mol.
5.The comparison between the carbenium and alkyl activation mechanisms indicates that the carbenium activation mechanism is more facile near the optimum region indicated by the cross-section of the two Polanyi relations.

1.CH活化的两种基本机制是卡宾活化和烷基活化。卡宾活化涉及CH键的极化，其中碳原子具有正的部分电荷，氢具有负的部分电荷。这导致形成醇酸盐和金属氢化物作为中间体。另一方面，烷基活化涉及CH的极化，其中碳具有负电荷，氢具有正电荷。这导致形成金属-烷基和布伦斯特酸作为中间体。两种机制都已针对文献中讨论的所有簇进行了研究。
2.卡宾活化机制从GaO配位的打开开始，形成活化的中间体D。然后，该中间体经历卡宾活化，导致形成醇酸盐和金属氢化物中间体。卡宾活化后，从醇酸盐中间体中解吸出烯烃（乙烯），留下布伦斯特酸位点。
3.烷基活化机制也从GaO配位的打开开始，形成活化的中间体D。然后，该中间体经历烷基活化，导致形成金属-烷基和布伦斯特酸作为中间体。烷基活化后，从Gaalkyl中间体中解吸出烯烃（乙烯），留下镓二氢化物物种。
4.总体卡宾活化势垒随着还原热的降低而迅速降低。较不稳定的位点（Z4a，Z8a和Z8b）显示出较低的活化势垒。在总体烷基活化势垒和还原热之间看到线性波拉尼关系。尽管CH键解离的活化势垒较低，但烷烃去除的速率决定步骤具有约60 kcal/mol的活化势垒。
5.卡宾活化和烷基活化机制之间的比较表明，卡宾活化机制在由两个波拉尼关系的交叉点指示的最优区域附近更易于进行。
