[1] "The two basic mechanisms of CH activationcarbenium activation and alkyl activationare shown in Schemes 2 and 3,respectively."
[2] "The carbenium activation involves CH bond po- larization in such a way that the carbon atom assumes a positive partial charge (δ+) and hydrogen assumes a negative partial charge (δ). Carbenium activation leads to the formation of alkoxide and metal hydride (MH) as an intermediate."
[3] "In contrast, alkyl activation (Scheme 3) involves CH polarization in such a way that the carbon develops a negative (δ) charge and the hydrogen develops a positive (δ+) charge. Alkyl activation leads to the formation of a metal-alkyl (MCnH2n+1) and the Brnsted acid as intermediates."
[4] "We investigated both mecha- nisms for all of the clusters discussed so far, and we discuss the results next."
[5] "The first step involves the opening of the GaO coordination (A + C2H6 [B] D in Scheme 2) to form the activated intermediate D."
[6] "The intermediate D further undergoes carbenium activation,as shown in Scheme 2 (D [E] F)."
[7] "Carbenium activation is followed by the desorption of an alkene (ethene) from the alkoxide intermediate (F [I] J K + C2H4), leaving behind the Brnsted acid site."
[8] "The intermediate D further undergoes alkyl activation as shown in Scheme 3 (D [E] F)."
[9] "Alkyl activation is followed by desorption of an alkene (ethene) from the Gaalkyl intermediate (F [I] J K + C2H4), leaving behind the gallium dihydride species ([GaH2]+Z m)."
[10] "For the 4-membered ring cluster Z4a, the overall free energy of alkyl activation (AG0 a) is lower than the carbenium acti- vation: 47.6 and 42.7 kcal/mol (Table 3) for alkyl activation,compared with 61.1 and 58.4 kcal/mol (Table 2) for carbenium activation."
[11] "Thus, alkene desorption is a rate-limiting step for the overall alkyl activation catalytic cycle irrespec- tive of the activity of the particular catalytic site."
[12] "Recently, Pidko et al. [42] reported a novel one-step H2 and C2H4 de- sorption pathway from gallium alkyl intermediate. This path- way involves a cyclic transition state with an activation bar- rier of 53.5 kcal/mol."
[13] "We also calculated an activation bar- rier of 54.6 kcal/mol using a single-framework substitution model of the active site as described previously [33]. Thus, this mechanism of decomposition should set a lower limit of about 55 kcal/mol for the apparent activation barrier."

1.The alkyl mechanism in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions on gallium-based catalysts involves the initial activation of propane, where the carbon atom develops a negative charge and the hydrogen develops a positive charge. This leads to the formation of a metal-alkyl (MCnH2n+1) and a Brnsted acid as intermediates. The activated intermediate D undergoes alkyl activation, resulting in the formation of a Gaalkyl species and a Brnsted acid site. Alkyl activation is followed by the desorption of an alkene (ethene) from the Gaalkyl intermediate, leaving behind the gallium dihydride species ([GaH2]+Z m). The carbenium mechanism, on the other hand, involves the polarization of the CH bond in such a way that the carbon atom assumes a positive partial charge and hydrogen assumes a negative partial charge. This leads to the formation of alkoxide and metal hydride (MH) as intermediates. The CH activation step is proposed as the rate-determining step (RDS) because it involves the breaking of a strong C-H bond, which requires a significant amount of energy. The alkyl mechanism applies to different Ga species structures, with the overall free energy of alkyl activation being lower than that of carbenium activation for the 4-membered ring cluster Z4a. However, alkene desorption is a rate-limiting step for the overall alkyl activation catalytic cycle, regardless of the activity of the particular catalytic site. A novel one-step H2 and C2H4 desorption pathway from gallium alkyl intermediate has been reported, involving a cyclic transition state with an activation barrier of 53.5 kcal/mol. This mechanism of decomposition sets a lower limit of about 55 kcal/mol for the apparent activation barrier.

1.在基于镓的催化剂上的丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应中，烷基机制涉及丙烷的初始活化，其中碳原子产生负电荷，氢产生正电荷。这导致形成金属烷基(MCnH2n+1)和布龙斯特酸作为中间体。活化中间体D经历烷基活化，形成Ga烷基物种和布龙斯特酸位点。烷基活化后，从Ga烷基中间体中脱除烯烃(乙烯)，留下镓二氢物种([GaH2]+Z m)。相比之下，卡宾机制涉及CH键的极化，使碳原子具有正偏电荷，氢具有负偏电荷。这导致形成醇盐和金属氢化物(MH)作为中间体。CH活化步骤被提议为速率决定步骤(RDS)，因为它涉及强C-H键的断裂，这需要大量的能量。烷基机制适用于不同的Ga物种结构，对于4-元环簇Z4a，烷基活化的总自由能低于卡宾活化。然而，无论特定催化位点的活性如何，烯烃脱除都是整个烷基活化催化循环的速率限制步骤。最近，报道了一种从镓烷基中间体中一步脱除H2和C2H4的新途径。该途径涉及一个环过渡态，活化能垒为53.5 kcal/mol。这种分解机制为表观活化能垒设定了约55 kcal/mol的下限。
