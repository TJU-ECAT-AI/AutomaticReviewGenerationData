[1] "The two basic mechanisms of CH activationcarbenium activation and alkyl activationare shown in Schemes 2 and 3,respectively."
[2] "The carbenium activation involves CH bond po- larization in such a way that the carbon atom assumes a positive partial charge (δ+) and hydrogen assumes a negative partial charge (δ). Carbenium activation leads to the formation of alkoxide and metal hydride (MH) as an intermediate."
[3] "In contrast, alkyl activation (Scheme 3) involves CH polarization in such a way that the carbon develops a negative (δ) charge and the hydrogen develops a positive (δ+) charge. Alkyl activation leads to the formation of a metal-alkyl (MCnH2n+1) and the Brnsted acid as intermediates."
[4] "We investigated both mecha- nisms for all of the clusters discussed so far, and we discuss the results next."
[5] "The first step involves the opening of the GaO coordination (A + C2H6 [B] D in Scheme 2) to form the activated intermediate D."
[6] "Depending on the site geom- etry, the undercoordinated GaH (intermediate D), representing the activated catalytic site, may or may not be stable."
[7] "The ethane molecule is adsorbed on to the electron-deficient, coor- dinatively unsaturated GaH species."
[8] "As was pointed out earlier,the CH bonds of the methyl group are strongly polarized and elongated."
[9] "In general, we have observed that for carbenium activation, the methyl group adsorbs in an end-on fashion (in- termediate D in Scheme 2)."
[10] "In contrast to end-on adsorbed complex for carbenium activation, for alkyl activation, we observed that the methyl group adsorbs in a sidewise fashion (intermediate D in Scheme 3)."
[11] "In this activated intermediate, only two hydro- gen atoms and the carbon of the methyl group are closer to the undercoordinated Ga."
[12] "On the opposite side of the Ga, the third hydrogen of the methyl group is closer to the framework oxy- gen."
[13] "This CH bond of the methyl group is strongly polarized and elongated."
[14] "Thus, the geometry of the intermediate D for alkyl activation is conducive for the formation of the Gaalkyl species and Brnsted acid site."
[15] "Thus, to compare different carbenium activation paths, we define an activation energy term called the overall carbenium activation barrier (CEa)."
[16] "This activation barrier represents the upper limit of the apparent activation barrier; the actual apparent ac- tivation barrier will depend on the surface coverage and hence on the reaction conditions, which can be determined via rig- orous kinetic simulation [29]."
[17] "We calculated the free energy change for A + C2H6 E activation (CG0 a), which allowed us to compare the reaction rate along a certain reaction path and determine the rate-controlling step."
[18] "For all active site struc- tures, energy parameters related to carbenium activation are listed in Table 2."
[19] "Carbenium activation is followed by the desorption of an alkene (ethene) from the alkoxide intermediate (F [I] J K + C2H4), leaving behind the Brnsted acid site."
[20] "However, a proton jump from one bridging oxygen to other is much more facile [62] compared with the other mecha- nistic steps."
[21] "In the discussions on the hydrogen desorption step that fol- lows, we start with the Brnsted acid site on the same bridging oxygen (intermediate K) bearing the alkoxide intermediate, to be consistent with the reduction path of the [GaH]2+Z2 d site."
[22] "The related energy parameters (ECEa, ECG0 a, ECEr, and ECG0 r ) for ethene desorption are listed in Table 2."
[23] "As ex- pected, the activation barrier (ECEa) is fairly constant, vary- ing around 2535 kcal/mol."
[24] "This mechanistic step is known as a structure-insensitive reaction in the sense that the activation barrier does not depend on the distance between the pair of the framework Al."
[25] "In any case, starting from the alkoxide interme- diate, the free energy of activation for alkene desorption is well"
[26] "below of that for carbenium activation and thus will be incon- sequential in determining the resulting apparent free energy of activation for the dehydrogenation reaction."
[27] "For the Z4a ring, the undercoordinated Ga species [GaH]2+ lies in the plane with OAlO, in contrast to the more tetra- hedral coordination of the Ga for the other cluster structures."
[28] "At the same time, the 4-member ring presents an exception to the end-on adsorbed complex observed for alkyl activa- tion."
[29] "The steric repulsion of the walls surrounding the smaller ring could be a reason for the preferred sidewise adsorption of the ethane molecule."
[30] "The overall free energies of carbe- nium activation (CG0 a) for the two paths for Z4a site are 61.1 and 58.5 kcal/mol."
[31] "As discussed previously, for the carbenium activation mechanism, desorption of an alkene from alkoxide intermediate is much more facile with a ECG0 a of 24.7 and 26.8 kcal/mol."
[32] "For each of the four reduction pathways for S5a, there is a distinct carbenium activation pathway."
[33] "The stability of the active site in the monohydride form transpires into the higher activation energy for carbenium activation."
[34] "The free energies of carbenium activation (A + C2H6 E, CG0 a) for four differ- ent reaction paths are 85.4, 81.4, 92.3, and 81.7 kcal/mol."
[35] "The corresponding free energy barriers for ethene removal (F I in Scheme 2) are 20.0, 34.0, 21.6, and 29.6 kcal/mol."
[36] "Again,note that ethene removal from alkoxide is very facile compared with the carbenium activation mechanism."
[37] "The six-membered ring S6a provides the most stable coor- dination for the [GaH]2+ species."
[38] "Correspondingly, the highest activation barrier for the carbenium activation is observed."
[39] "As noted previously [33], due to the higher stability of the cat- alytic site S6a in the monohydride form, the undercoordinated [GaH]2+ species (B and D) are absent along the reaction path."
[40] "The free energies of carbenium activation (CG0 a) for the two mechanistic paths (A + C2H6 E in Scheme 2) are 96.4 and 99.2 kcal/mol, with corresponding free energies of activation for ethene removal of (ECG0 a) of 27.1 and 22.6 kcal/mol."
[41] "For the other six-membered ring structure S6b, we studied four distinct carbenium activation paths."
[42] "The energetics of all four reaction pathways are very similar due to symmetry of the site S6b."
[43] "Because site S6b is less stable (H 0 red less en- dothermic in Table 1) than S6a, the activation barriers for carbe- nium activation are lower."
[44] "Free energies of carbenium activation (CG0 a) are 87.0, 89.1, 88.2, and 94.1 kcal/mol."
[45] "As reported in Table 2, the free energies of activation for ethene desorption are about 28 kcal/mol for all four reaction paths."
[46] "For the 8-membered ring Z8a, 3.6 kcal/mol heat of re- duction indicates the formation of the [GaH2]+Z m is slightly exothermic."
[47] "The lower stability of the site Z8a leads to lower free energies of the carbenium activation (62.6 and 62.0 kcal/ mol for two pathways)."
[48] "For the other 8-membered ring Z8b, the reduction is much more exothermic with H 0 red of 19.6 and 18.6 kcal/mol."
[49] "The least stable site shows the lowest free en- ergy of carbenium activation (CG0 a), 47.7 and 49.2 kcal/mol."
[50] "258 Y.V. Joshi, K.T. Thomson / Journal of Catalysis 246 (2007) 249265"
[51] "Fig. 5. Geometries of reaction intermediates for: (a) carbenium activation; (b) H2 removal; (c) alkyl activation for Z4a site pathway 1."
[52] "The ECG0 a for ethene desorption is about 22 kcal/mol, much lower than that for carbenium activation."
[53] "Scheme 3 shows a generalized catalytic cycle for dehydro- genation starting with alkyl activation, including all possible intermediates along any alkyl activation path."
[54] "Not all of these intermediates may be present for a particular catalytic site, how- ever."
[55] "In our previous publication on the role of frameworkAl pair sites, we specifically focused on the carbenium activation mechanism, expecting a very high activation barrier [33,41] for alkene desorption from Gaalkyl species."
[56] "Frash and van Santen [41] showed that for the active site involving single- frameworkAl, alkyl activation has a lower activation barrier than carbenium activation."
[57] "A similar trend is expected for the frameworkAl pair sites."
[58] "Similar to the carbenium activation,here the first step involves opening of the GaO coordination (A + C2H6 [B] D in Scheme 3) to form the activated intermediate D."
[59] "In contrast to end-on adsorbed complex for carbenium activation, for alkyl activation, we observed that the methyl group adsorbs in a sidewise fashion (intermediate D in Scheme 3)."
[60] "In this activated intermediate, only two hydro- gen atoms and the carbon of the methyl group are closer to the undercoordinated Ga."
[61] "On the opposite side of the Ga, the third hydrogen of the methyl group is closer to the framework oxy- gen."
[62] "This CH bond of the methyl group is strongly polarized and elongated."
[63] "Thus, the geometry of the intermediate D for alkyl activation is conducive for the formation of the Gaalkyl species and Brnsted acid site."
[64] "Thus, to compare different alkyl activation paths,we have defined an activation energy term called the overall alkyl activation barrier (AEa), representing the energy differ- ence between E and A + C2H6."
[65] "This activation barrier is the approximate apparent activation barrier, because we have ne- glected the possible presence of the intermediates B and D for our analysis."
[66] "We calculated the corresponding free energy change (AG0 a) for A + C2H6 E transformation and in Ta- ble 3 report the energy terms for all of the alkyl activation paths:alkyl activation energy (AEa), standard free energies of acti- vation (AG0 a at 25 C and 1 atm), reaction energy (AEr),and free energy change for alkyl activation (AG0 r )."
[67] "Alkyl activation is followed by desorption of an alkene (ethene) from the Gaalkyl intermediate (F [I] J K + C2H4), leaving behind the gallium dihydride species ([GaH2]+Z m)."
[68] "Relaxation of the transition state I toward prod- uct leads to the formation of the intermediate J with ethene adsorbed (π-bonded) on the [GaH2]+Z m."
[69] "Intermediate J indi- cates that the tetrahedral Ga species is coordinated with only one framework oxygen (monodentate)."
[70] "After the desorption of ethene, the [GaH2]+ species should relax to the more stable bidentate coordination (species K), as shown in Scheme 3."
[71] "Various energy terms for ethene desorption (EAEa, EAG0 a, EAEr and EAG0 r ) are reported in Table 3."
[72] "Desorption of ethene from Gaalkyl species has been well studied [33,41], and a very high activation barrier of about 60 kcal/mol has been reported."
[73] "Because desorption is associated with the Ga species adjacent to a single-framework Al, the activation barrier is expected to be independent (structure insensitive) of the dis- tance between the framework Alpair."
[74] "In the reminder of this section, we discuss the details of the alkyl activation mecha- nism for each catalytic site."
[75] "For the 4-membered ring cluster Z4a, the overall free energy of alkyl activation (AG0 a) is lower than the carbenium acti- vation: 47.6 and 42.7 kcal/mol (Table 3) for alkyl activation,compared with 61.1 and 58.4 kcal/mol (Table 2) for carbenium activation."
[76] "The free energies of activation for ethene removal are 62.0 and 64.4 kcal/mol, respectively."
[77] "The stability of the bicationic gallium monohydride species in the S5a ring makes alkyl activation more difficult compared with that for Z4a."
[78] "As expected, the free energy activation bar- riers (66.4, 61.9, 66.6, and 54.7 kcal/mol) are lower than those for carbenium activation."
[79] "The structure-insensitive ethene re- moval step faces typical free energy barriers of 56.5, 57.8, 48.8,and 63.9 kcal/mol."
[80] "The S6a structure has large free energy barriers (AG0 a) of 69.6 and 73.8 kcal/mol, with ethene removal barriers of ca."
[81] "60.5 and 54.7 kcal/mol."
[82] "The four alkyl activation pathways for the S6b site have free energy barriers (AG0 a) of 64.7, 67.9, 69.3, and 70.2 kcal/mol, with ethene removal barriers of ca."
[83] "62 kcal/mol."
[84] "The Z8a ring structure provides a less stable coordina- tion for the [GaH]2+ species, with lower resulting activation barriers for CH dissociation by the alkyl activation mecha- nism."
[85] "We calculated the free energy activation barriers to be 42.5 and 37.7 kcal/mol."
[86] "Ethene removal barriers of 63.3 and 64.1 kcal/mol would make this the rate-limiting step."
[87] "For the least stable site, Z8b, the alkyl activation barriers (AG0 a) are 29.0 and 27.0 kcal/mol."
[88] "The barriers for the forma- tion of the undercoordinated GaH species are relatively higher."
[89] "The ethene desorption barriers are 65.5 and 66.8 kcal/mol for this particular site."
[90] "Thus, alkene desorption is a rate-limiting step for the overall alkyl activation catalytic cycle irrespec- tive of the activity of the particular catalytic site."
[91] "Recently, Pidko et al. [42] reported a novel one-step H2 and C2H4 de- sorption pathway from gallium alkyl intermediate."
[92] "This path- 260 Y.V. Joshi, K.T. Thomson / Journal of Catalysis 246 (2007) 249265"
[93] "way involves a cyclic transition state with an activation bar- rier of 53.5 kcal/mol."
[94] "We also calculated an activation bar- rier of 54.6 kcal/mol using a single-framework substitution model of the active site as described previously [33]."
[95] "Thus, this mechanism of decomposition should set a lower limit of about 55 kcal/mol for the apparent activation barrier."
[96] "We repeated the calculation of this cyclic transition state for all the pair site models; the resulting activation energies (EDEa) are reported in Table 3."
[97] "The constant values of EDEa suggest that this decomposition mechanism is a structure- insensitive reaction."

1. The alkyl mechanism in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions on gallium-based catalysts involves the initial activation of propane through the polarization of the C-H bond, resulting in a negative charge on the carbon atom and a positive charge on the hydrogen atom. This leads to the formation of a metal-alkyl species (GaCnH2n+1) and a Brnsted acid site as intermediates. The first step is the opening of the GaO coordination to form an activated intermediate D, where the propane molecule is adsorbed onto the electron-deficient, coordinatively unsaturated GaH species. In contrast to the end-on adsorption observed in carbenium activation, the methyl group adsorbs in a sidewise fashion for alkyl activation. In this intermediate, two hydrogen atoms and the carbon of the methyl group are closer to the undercoordinated Ga, while the third hydrogen is closer to the framework oxygen. This geometry is conducive for the formation of the Gaalkyl species and Brnsted acid site. The overall alkyl activation barrier (AEa) is defined as the energy difference between the transition state E and the initial state A + C2H6. This activation barrier represents the approximate apparent activation barrier for the alkyl activation mechanism. Alkyl activation is followed by the desorption of an alkene (ethene) from the Gaalkyl intermediate, leaving behind the gallium dihydride species ([GaH2]+Zm). The desorption of ethene from the Gaalkyl species faces a very high activation barrier of about 60 kcal/mol, making it the rate-determining step for the overall alkyl activation catalytic cycle.
2. The carbenium mechanism involves the polarization of the C-H bond in such a way that the carbon atom assumes a positive partial charge and hydrogen assumes a negative partial charge. This leads to the formation of an alkoxide and metal hydride (MH) as intermediates. The carbenium activation mechanism is characterized by the end-on adsorption of the methyl group onto the undercoordinated GaH species. The overall carbenium activation barrier (CEa) is defined as the energy difference between the transition state E and the initial state A + C2H6. This activation barrier represents the upper limit of the apparent activation barrier for the carbenium activation mechanism. Carbenium activation is followed by the desorption of an alkene (ethene) from the alkoxide intermediate, leaving behind the Brnsted acid site. The desorption of ethene from the alkoxide intermediate is much more facile compared to the carbenium activation mechanism.
3. The CH activation step is proposed as the rate-determining step (RDS) because it involves the breaking of the strong C-H bond, which requires a significant amount of energy. The high activation barrier for this step limits the overall reaction rate. The alkyl mechanism applies to different Ga species structures, with the activation barrier varying depending on the stability of the active site. For example, the stability of the bicationic gallium monohydride species in the S5a ring makes alkyl activation more difficult compared to that for the Z4a ring. The activation barrier for alkyl activation decreases with decreasing stability of the active site.
4. The alkyl mechanism is more facile than the carbenium mechanism in terms of the CH activation step, but the desorption of ethene from the Gaalkyl species faces a very high activation barrier of about 60 kcal/mol, making it the rate-determining step for the overall alkyl activation catalytic cycle. This high barrier limits the intrinsic rate of dehydrogenation and suggests that the Gaalkyl species could be the most abundant surface intermediate (MASI). However, a high ethene removal barrier would indicate that it will be a spectator species. A recent DRIFTS study revealed the presence of the [HGaC2H5]+ species after the catalyst was heated in the presence of ethane.

1. 在基于镓的催化剂上的丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应中，烷基机制涉及通过C-H键的极化来激活丙烷，导致碳原子带负电荷，氢原子带正电荷。这导致形成金属烷基物种(GaCnH2n+1)和Brnsted酸位作为中间体。第一步是打开GaO配位以形成活化中间体D，其中丙烷分子吸附在电子不足的、配位不足的GaH物种上。与在卡宾机制中观察到的端向吸附相反，对于烷基机制，甲基以侧向方式吸附。在这种中间体中，甲基的两个氢原子和碳原子更靠近未配位的Ga，而第三个氢原子更靠近框架氧。这种几何形状有利于形成Gaalkyl物种和Brnsted酸位。总体烷基活化势垒(AEa)被定义为过渡态E和初始状态A + C2H6之间的能量差。这个活化势垒代表了烷基活化机制的近似表观活化势垒。烷基活化后，从Gaalkyl中间体中脱除烯烃(乙烯)，留下镓二氢物种([GaH2]+Zm)。从Gaalkyl物种中脱除乙烯的活化势垒约为60 kcal/mol，这使得它成为整个烷基活化催化循环的速率决定步骤。
2. 卡宾机制涉及以碳原子带正部分电荷，氢原子带负部分电荷的方式极化C-H键。这导致形成醇酸盐和金属氢化物(MH)作为中间体。卡宾活化机制的特点是甲基以端向方式吸附在未配位的GaH物种上。总体卡宾活化势垒(CEa)被定义为过渡态E和初始状态A + C2H6之间的能量差。这个活化势垒代表了卡宾活化机制的表观活化势垒的上限。卡宾活化后，从醇酸盐中间体中脱除烯烃(乙烯)，留下Brnsted酸位。从醇酸盐中间体中脱除乙烯比卡宾活化机制容易得多。
3. CH活化步骤被提议为速率决定步骤(RDS)，因为它涉及断裂强C-H键，这需要大量的能量。这个步骤的高活化势垒限制了整体反应速率。烷基机制适用于不同的Ga物种结构，活化势垒根据活性位的稳定性而变化。例如，S5a环中二价镓单氢物种的稳定性使烷基活化比Z4a环更困难。活性位的稳定性越低，烷基活化势垒越低。
4. 烷基机制在CH活化步骤方面比卡宾机制更容易，但从Gaalkyl物种中脱除乙烯的活化势垒约为60 kcal/mol，这使得它成为整个烷基活化催化循环的速率决定步骤。这个高势垒限制了脱氢的内在速率，并表明Gaalkyl物种可能是最丰富的表面中间体(MASI)。然而，高乙烯去除势垒将表明它将是一个旁观者物种。最近的一项DRIFTS研究在催化剂在乙烷存在下加热后揭示了[HGaC2H5]+物种的存在。
