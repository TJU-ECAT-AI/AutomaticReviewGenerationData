[1] "A sequence of steps that corresponds essentially to reaction (19) has been analyzed by Frash and van Santen [24] in their theoreti- cal study of ethane activation on gallium-exchanged zeolites,with dihydridogallium ions as the active sites."
[2] "In their scheme,the alkyl- hydridogallium species in reaction (19) decomposes to produce an alkene molecule and regenerate the dihydrido active site."
[3] "Our results suggest that the decomposition of the alkylhydrido inter- mediate occurs by reactions (17) and (18) instead."
[4] "Dihydridogallium ions were observed after reduction in hydro- gen,but were slowly decomposed when hydrogen flow was replaced by inert gas."
[5] "This slow decomposition of the dihydridogal- lium ions shows that it cannot intermediate hydrogen desorption during the aromatization reaction."
[6] "However,when hydrogen is replaced by propane,the dihydrido species appear to be rapidly replaced by alkylgallium ions."
[7] "Under propane flow,dihydridogal- lium cations were never detected."
[8] "These facts show that it cannot be the active site for alkane activation,as proposed by some inves- tigators."

1.The alkyl mechanism in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions on gallium-based catalysts involves a sequence of steps starting with the activation of propane by a dihydridogallium ion. This activation step is proposed as the rate-determining step (RDS) because it involves the initial interaction between the alkane and the active site, which can be slow due to the stability of the C-H bond in alkanes. In the alkyl mechanism, the dihydridogallium ion reacts with propane to form an alkylhydridogallium intermediate. This intermediate then decomposes to produce an alkene molecule and regenerate the dihydrido active site. However, the study suggests that the decomposition of the alkylhydrido intermediate occurs by reactions (17) and (18) instead, where the alkyl group is transferred to another site, leading to the formation of an alkylgallium ion and the release of hydrogen. This mechanism applies to different Ga species structures, including isolated Ga(I) species formed from binuclear oxidic gallium clusters during reduction.
2.Comparing the alkyl mechanism to the carbenium mechanism, the carbenium mechanism involves the formation of a carbenium ion intermediate, which is a positively charged species with a carbon atom bearing a positive charge. In contrast, the alkyl mechanism involves the formation of an alkylhydridogallium intermediate, which is a neutral species with a carbon atom bonded to a gallium atom. The carbenium mechanism is typically associated with acid-catalyzed reactions, while the alkyl mechanism is associated with metal-catalyzed reactions.
3.The CH activation step is proposed as the RDS because it involves the breaking of a strong C-H bond in the alkane, which requires a significant amount of energy. This step is also influenced by the nature of the active site and the strength of the interaction between the alkane and the active site. The stability of the intermediate formed during this step can also affect the overall reaction rate.
4.Under propane flow, dihydridogallium cations were never detected, indicating that they cannot be the active site for alkane activation. Instead, alkylgallium ions, probably methylethylgallium ions, were observed to be formed under propane aromatization conditions. These observations are consistent with the alkyl mechanism, where the alkyl group is transferred to another site, leading to the formation of an alkylgallium ion and the release of hydrogen.

1.在基于镓的催化剂上，丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应的烷基机制涉及一系列步骤，从二氢镓离子激活丙烷开始。这一步骤被提议为速率决定步骤(RDS)，因为它涉及烷烃与活性位点之间的初始相互作用，由于烷烃中C-H键的稳定性，这一步骤可能较慢。在烷基机制中，二氢镓离子与丙烷反应形成烷基氢镓中间体。然后，该中间体分解，产生一个烯烃分子并再生二氢活性位点。然而，研究表明，烷基氢镓中间体的分解是通过反应(17)和(18)进行的，其中烷基基团转移到另一个位点，导致形成烷基镓离子并释放氢气。这种机制适用于不同的Ga物种结构，包括在还原过程中从二核氧化镓簇形成的孤立Ga(I)物种。
2.将烷基机制与卡宾机制进行比较，卡宾机制涉及形成卡宾离子中间体，这是一种带有正电荷的碳原子的正电荷物种。相比之下，烷基机制涉及形成烷基氢镓中间体，这是一种带有与镓原子结合的碳原子的中性物种。卡宾机制通常与酸催化反应相关，而烷基机制与金属催化反应相关。
3.CH活化步骤被提议为RDS，因为它涉及在烷烃中断裂强C-H键，这需要大量的能量。这一步骤也受到活性位点的性质和烷烃与活性位点之间相互作用强度的影响。这一步骤中形成的中间体的稳定性也会影响整体反应速率。
4.在丙烷流下，从未检测到二氢镓阳离子，表明它们不能作为烷烃活化的活性位点。相反，在丙烷芳构化条件下观察到形成了烷基镓离子，可能是甲基乙基镓离子。这些观察结果与烷基机制一致，其中烷基基团转移到另一个位点，导致形成烷基镓离子并释放氢气。
