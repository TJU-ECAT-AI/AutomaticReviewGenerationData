1.The alkyl mechanism in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions on gallium-based catalysts involves several key steps. Initially, propane is activated by a gallium ion (Ga+) to form a gallium-propane complex (Ga+H(C3H7)). This complex can then undergo dehydrogenation to produce propene and regenerate the gallium ion, or it can rearrange to form an alkylgallium species (Ga+(CH3)(C2H5)). When hydrogen is present, it can react with the dihydridogallium ion (GaH2+) to form a gallium-propane complex, which then decomposes to produce propene and hydrogen. The formation of isolated Ga(I) species from binuclear oxidic gallium clusters involves the production of Lewis from Brnsted acid sites in a 1:1 basis. This process is accompanied by some de-alumination of the zeolite framework to produce extraframework alumina, which also helps to explain the decrease in Brnsted acidity and increase in Lewis acidity. When hydrogen is the reducing agent, the decomposition of the binuclear oxidic species is partially reversed when hydrogen flow is replaced by inert gas, but when the reducing agent is propane, the formation of isolated Ga(I) species is irreversible, probably because it is stabilized by alkyl groups bonded to gallium, that were seen to be formed and to be stable when propane flow is replaced by inert gas. The carbenium mechanism involves the formation of a carbenium ion intermediate, which then undergoes dehydrogenation to produce propene and a proton. The CH activation step is proposed as the rate-determining step (RDS) because it involves the breaking of a strong C-H bond. The alkyl mechanism applies to different Ga species structures, including isolated Ga(I) ions, dihydridogallium ions, and alkylgallium species.

1.在基于镓的催化剂上，丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应的烷基机制涉及几个关键步骤。最初，丙烷被镓离子(Ga+)激活，形成镓-丙烷复合物(Ga+H(C3H7))。该复合物随后可以脱氢生成丙烯并再生镓离子，或者它可以通过重排形成烷基镓物种(Ga+(CH3)(C2H5))。当存在氢气时，它可以与二氢镓离子(GaH2+)反应，形成镓-丙烷复合物，然后分解生成丙烯和氢气。从二核氧化镓簇形成孤立Ga(I)物种的过程涉及从Brnsted酸位点以1:1的比例产生Lewis酸位点。这一过程伴随着一些沸石框架的脱铝，产生外框架氧化铝，这也有助于解释Brnsted酸度的降低和Lewis酸度的增加。当氢气是还原剂时，二核氧化物物种的分解在氢气流被惰性气体取代时部分可逆，但当还原剂是丙烷时，孤立Ga(I)物种的形成是不可逆的，可能是因为它被与镓键合的烷基基团稳定，这些烷基基团在丙烷流被惰性气体取代时被观察到形成并保持稳定。卡宾机制涉及形成卡宾离子中间体，然后脱氢生成丙烯和质子。CH活化步骤被提议为速率决定步骤(RDS)，因为它涉及断裂一个强C-H键。烷基机制适用于不同的Ga物种结构，包括孤立的Ga(I)离子、二氢镓离子和烷基镓物种。
