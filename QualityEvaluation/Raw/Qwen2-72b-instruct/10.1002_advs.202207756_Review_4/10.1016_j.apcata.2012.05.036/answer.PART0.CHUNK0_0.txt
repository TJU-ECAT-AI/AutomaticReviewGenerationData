1.In the alkyl mechanism of propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions on gallium-based catalysts, the initial step involves the activation of propane by the reduced gallium species, specifically the isolated Ga(I) ions. These Ga(I) ions are formed from binuclear oxidic gallium clusters through a process that involves the production of Lewis acid sites from Brnsted acid sites in a 1:1 basis. This process is accompanied by some de-alumination of the zeolite framework, which helps explain the decrease in Brnsted acidity and increase in Lewis acidity. When hydrogen is the reducing agent, the decomposition of the binuclear oxidic species is partially reversed when hydrogen flow is replaced by inert gas. However, when the reducing agent is propane, the formation of isolated Ga(I) species is irreversible, probably because it is stabilized by alkyl groups bonded to gallium, which were seen to be formed and to be stable when propane flow is replaced by inert gas. Dihydridogallium ions were observed after reduction in hydrogen, but were slowly decomposed when hydrogen flow was replaced by inert gas. This slow decomposition of the dihydridogallium ions shows that it cannot intermediate hydrogen desorption during the aromatization reaction. However, when hydrogen is replaced by propane, the dihydrido species appear to be rapidly replaced by alkylgallium ions. Under propane flow, dihydridogallium cations were never detected. These facts show that it cannot be the active site for alkane activation, as proposed by some investigators. Gas phase hydrogen added at the beginning of the reaction has a strong influence on catalysts activity and selectivity. Our results demonstrate that, while dehydrogenation reactions are inhibited by increasing hydrogen partial pressure, hydrogenolysis activities go through a maximum. This maximum shows that, while hydrogen takes part in hydrogenolysis reactions, it competes with propane for the active sites. This pattern of behavior confirms that dihydridogallium species cannot be the active species in this system. In comparison to the carbenium mechanism, the alkyl mechanism involves the direct activation of propane by the reduced gallium species, whereas the carbenium mechanism involves the formation of carbenium ions as intermediates. The CH activation step is proposed as the rate-determining step (RDS) because it involves the breaking of the strong C-H bond in propane, which is energetically unfavorable. The alkyl mechanism applies to different Ga species structures, but the isolated Ga(I) ions are the most active for propane activation.

1.在基于镓的催化剂上的丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应的烷基机制中，初始步骤涉及通过还原的镓物种，特别是孤立的Ga(I)离子，激活丙烷。这些Ga(I)离子是从二核氧化镓簇通过涉及从布朗斯特酸位点产生路易斯酸位点的1:1过程形成的。这一过程伴随着沸石框架的一些脱铝化，这有助于解释布朗斯特酸度的降低和路易斯酸度的增加。当氢气是还原剂时，当氢气流被惰性气体取代时，二核氧化物种的分解部分可逆。然而，当还原剂是丙烷时，孤立的Ga(I)物种的形成是不可逆的，可能是因为它被与镓键合的烷基基团稳定，当丙烷流被惰性气体取代时，这些烷基基团被观察到形成并保持稳定。在氢气还原后观察到二氢化镓离子，但当氢气流被惰性气体取代时，它们缓慢分解。二氢化镓离子的缓慢分解表明它不能在芳构化反应中作为氢解吸的中间体。然而，当氢气被丙烷取代时，二氢化物种似乎迅速被烷基镓离子取代。在丙烷流下，从未检测到二氢化镓阳离子。这些事实表明，它不能作为一些研究者所提出的烷烃活化的活性位点。在反应开始时添加的气相氢对催化剂的活性和选择性有很强的影响。我们的结果表明，虽然脱氢反应受到氢分压增加的抑制，但氢解离活性经历一个最大值。这个最大值表明，虽然氢参与氢解离反应，但它与丙烷竞争活性位点。这种行为模式证实了二氢化镓物种不能是该系统中的活性物种。与卡宾机制相比，烷基机制涉及通过还原的镓物种直接激活丙烷，而卡宾机制涉及形成卡宾离子作为中间体。CH活化步骤被提议为速率决定步骤(RDS)，因为它涉及在丙烷中断裂强C-H键，这在能量上是不利的。烷基机制适用于不同的Ga物种结构，但孤立的Ga(I)离子对于丙烷活化是最活跃的。
