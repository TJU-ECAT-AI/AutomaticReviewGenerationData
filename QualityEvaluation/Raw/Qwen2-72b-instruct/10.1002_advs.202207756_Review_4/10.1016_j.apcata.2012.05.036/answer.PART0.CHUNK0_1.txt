1.The alkyl mechanism in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions on gallium-based catalysts involves a sequence of steps starting with the activation of propane by a gallium species. The initial step is the formation of an alkyl-gallium intermediate, which then decomposes to produce an alkene molecule and regenerate the active site. This mechanism has been analyzed theoretically by Frash and van Santen for ethane activation on gallium-exchanged zeolites, with dihydridogallium ions as the active sites. However, our results suggest that the decomposition of the alkylhydrido intermediate occurs by reactions (17) and (18) instead of the proposed regeneration of the dihydrido active site.
2.Compared to the carbenium mechanism, the alkyl mechanism involves the formation of an alkyl-gallium intermediate rather than a carbenium ion. The CH activation step is proposed as the rate-determining step (RDS) because it involves the breaking of a strong C-H bond, which is energetically unfavorable. The alkyl mechanism applies to different Ga species structures, including isolated Ga(I) species and dihydridogallium ions, depending on the reaction conditions.
3.Addition of hydrogen to the reaction medium suppresses the aromatization reaction, possibly by reversing reactions such as (17) and other dehydrogenation steps involved in aromatization. On the other hand, it strongly promotes the formation of methane and ethane. However, there is competition between hydrogen and the hydrocarbon for the active sites. A Langmuir-Hinshelwood type of mechanism, such as represented by reaction (20), is a likely possibility for the hydrogenolysis reactions.
4.It should be reminded that the isolated gallium species are formed from binuclear gallium oxidic species during reduction, so pairs of reduced species are likely to be in close proximity in the reduced form of the catalyst. The reactions proposed in this article refer to the activation of the catalysts at the beginning of the reaction and to propane activation. In subsequent steps, the zeolite Brnsted acid sites are responsible for oligomerization, cyclization, and hydride transfer reactions involved in the aromatization process, while reduced gallium species are responsible for dehydrogenation reactions.

1.在基于镓的催化剂上，丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应的烷基机制涉及一系列步骤，从丙烷通过镓物种的活化开始。初始步骤是形成烷基-镓中间体，然后分解产生烯烃分子并再生活性位点。Frash和van Santen在理论上分析了这种机制，用于在镓交换沸石上对乙烷进行活化，其中二氢化镓离子作为活性位点。然而，我们的结果表明，烷基氢化物中间体的分解是通过反应(17)和(18)而不是通过再生二氢化活性位点来发生的。
2.与卡宾机制相比，烷基机制涉及形成烷基-镓中间体，而不是卡宾离子。CH活化步骤被提议为速率决定步骤(RDS)，因为它涉及断裂强C-H键，这在能量上是不利的。烷基机制适用于不同的Ga物种结构，包括孤立的Ga(I)物种和二氢化镓离子，这取决于反应条件。
3.向反应介质中添加氢气会抑制芳构化反应，可能是通过逆转反应(17)和其他涉及芳构化的脱氢步骤。另一方面，它强烈促进甲烷和乙烷的形成。然而，氢气和烃类之间存在对活性位点的竞争。Langmuir-Hinshelwood类型的机制，如反应(20)所示，是氢解反应的可能机制。
4.应该提醒的是，孤立的镓物种是在还原过程中从二核镓氧化物物种形成的，因此在还原催化剂的形式中，成对的还原物种可能在空间上很接近。本文中提出的反应指的是反应开始时催化剂的活化和丙烷的活化。在后续步骤中，沸石的Bronsted酸位点负责涉及芳构化过程的聚合作用、环化和氢转移反应，而还原的镓物种负责脱氢反应。
