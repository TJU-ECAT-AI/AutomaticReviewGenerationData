1.In the alkyl mechanism of propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions on gallium-based catalysts, the initial step involves the activation of propane by the reduced gallium species, specifically the isolated Ga(I) ions. These Ga(I) ions are formed from binuclear oxidic gallium clusters through a process that involves the production of Lewis acid sites from Brnsted acid sites in a 1:1 basis. This process is accompanied by some de-alumination of the zeolite framework, which helps explain the decrease in Brnsted acidity and increase in Lewis acidity. When hydrogen is the reducing agent, the decomposition of the binuclear oxidic species is partially reversed when hydrogen flow is replaced by inert gas. However, when the reducing agent is propane, the formation of isolated Ga(I) species is irreversible, probably because it is stabilized by alkyl groups bonded to gallium, which were seen to be formed and to be stable when propane flow is replaced by inert gas. Dihydridogallium ions were observed after reduction in hydrogen, but were slowly decomposed when hydrogen flow was replaced by inert gas. This slow decomposition of the dihydridogallium ions shows that it cannot intermediate hydrogen desorption during the aromatization reaction. However, when hydrogen is replaced by propane, the dihydrido species appear to be rapidly replaced by alkylgallium ions. Under propane flow, dihydridogallium cations were never detected. These facts show that it cannot be the active site for alkane activation, as proposed by some investigators. Gas phase hydrogen added at the beginning of the reaction has a strong influence on catalysts activity and selectivity. Our results demonstrate that, while dehydrogenation reactions are inhibited by increasing hydrogen partial pressure, hydrogenolysis activities go through a maximum. This maximum shows that, while hydrogen takes part in hydrogenolysis reactions, it competes with propane for the active sites. This pattern of behavior confirms that dihydridogallium species cannot be the active species in this system. In comparison to the carbenium mechanism, the alkyl mechanism involves the direct activation of propane by the reduced gallium species, whereas the carbenium mechanism involves the formation of carbenium ions as intermediates. The CH activation step is proposed as the rate-determining step (RDS) because it involves the breaking of the strong C-H bond in propane, which is energetically unfavorable. The alkyl mechanism applies to different Ga species structures, but the isolated Ga(I) ions are the most active for propane activation.

1.在基于镓的催化剂上的丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应的烷基机制中，初始步骤涉及通过还原的镓物种，特别是孤立的Ga(I)离子，激活丙烷。这些Ga(I)离子是从二核氧化镓簇通过涉及从布朗斯特酸位点产生路易斯酸位点的1:1过程形成的。这一过程伴随着沸石框架的一些脱铝化，这有助于解释布朗斯特酸度的降低和路易斯酸度的增加。当氢气是还原剂时，当氢气流被惰性气体取代时，二核氧化物种的分解部分可逆。然而，当还原剂是丙烷时，孤立的Ga(I)物种的形成是不可逆的，可能是因为它被与镓键合的烷基基团稳定，当丙烷流被惰性气体取代时，这些烷基基团被观察到形成并保持稳定。在氢气还原后观察到二氢化镓离子，但当氢气流被惰性气体取代时，它们缓慢分解。二氢化镓离子的缓慢分解表明它不能在芳构化反应中作为氢解吸的中间体。然而，当氢气被丙烷取代时，二氢化物种似乎迅速被烷基镓离子取代。在丙烷流下，从未检测到二氢化镓阳离子。这些事实表明，它不能作为一些研究者所提出的烷烃活化的活性位点。在反应开始时添加的气相氢对催化剂的活性和选择性有很强的影响。我们的结果表明，虽然脱氢反应受到氢分压增加的抑制，但氢解离活性经历一个最大值。这个最大值表明，虽然氢参与氢解离反应，但它与丙烷竞争活性位点。这种行为模式证实了二氢化镓物种不能是该系统中的活性物种。与卡宾机制相比，烷基机制涉及通过还原的镓物种直接激活丙烷，而卡宾机制涉及形成卡宾离子作为中间体。CH活化步骤被提议为速率决定步骤(RDS)，因为它涉及在丙烷中断裂强C-H键，这在能量上是不利的。烷基机制适用于不同的Ga物种结构，但孤立的Ga(I)离子对于丙烷活化是最活跃的。

1.The alkyl mechanism in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions on gallium-based catalysts involves a sequence of steps starting with the activation of propane by a gallium species. The initial step is the formation of an alkyl-gallium intermediate, which then decomposes to produce an alkene molecule and regenerate the active site. This mechanism has been analyzed theoretically by Frash and van Santen for ethane activation on gallium-exchanged zeolites, with dihydridogallium ions as the active sites. However, our results suggest that the decomposition of the alkylhydrido intermediate occurs by reactions (17) and (18) instead of the proposed regeneration of the dihydrido active site.
2.Compared to the carbenium mechanism, the alkyl mechanism involves the formation of an alkyl-gallium intermediate rather than a carbenium ion. The CH activation step is proposed as the rate-determining step (RDS) because it involves the breaking of a strong C-H bond, which is energetically unfavorable. The alkyl mechanism applies to different Ga species structures, including isolated Ga(I) species and dihydridogallium ions, depending on the reaction conditions.
3.Addition of hydrogen to the reaction medium suppresses the aromatization reaction, possibly by reversing reactions such as (17) and other dehydrogenation steps involved in aromatization. On the other hand, it strongly promotes the formation of methane and ethane. However, there is competition between hydrogen and the hydrocarbon for the active sites. A Langmuir-Hinshelwood type of mechanism, such as represented by reaction (20), is a likely possibility for the hydrogenolysis reactions.
4.It should be reminded that the isolated gallium species are formed from binuclear gallium oxidic species during reduction, so pairs of reduced species are likely to be in close proximity in the reduced form of the catalyst. The reactions proposed in this article refer to the activation of the catalysts at the beginning of the reaction and to propane activation. In subsequent steps, the zeolite Brnsted acid sites are responsible for oligomerization, cyclization, and hydride transfer reactions involved in the aromatization process, while reduced gallium species are responsible for dehydrogenation reactions.

1.在基于镓的催化剂上，丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应的烷基机制涉及一系列步骤，从丙烷通过镓物种的活化开始。初始步骤是形成烷基-镓中间体，然后分解产生烯烃分子并再生活性位点。Frash和van Santen在理论上分析了这种机制，用于在镓交换沸石上对乙烷进行活化，其中二氢化镓离子作为活性位点。然而，我们的结果表明，烷基氢化物中间体的分解是通过反应(17)和(18)而不是通过再生二氢化活性位点来发生的。
2.与卡宾机制相比，烷基机制涉及形成烷基-镓中间体，而不是卡宾离子。CH活化步骤被提议为速率决定步骤(RDS)，因为它涉及断裂强C-H键，这在能量上是不利的。烷基机制适用于不同的Ga物种结构，包括孤立的Ga(I)物种和二氢化镓离子，这取决于反应条件。
3.向反应介质中添加氢气会抑制芳构化反应，可能是通过逆转反应(17)和其他涉及芳构化的脱氢步骤。另一方面，它强烈促进甲烷和乙烷的形成。然而，氢气和烃类之间存在对活性位点的竞争。Langmuir-Hinshelwood类型的机制，如反应(20)所示，是氢解反应的可能机制。
4.应该提醒的是，孤立的镓物种是在还原过程中从二核镓氧化物物种形成的，因此在还原催化剂的形式中，成对的还原物种可能在空间上很接近。本文中提出的反应指的是反应开始时催化剂的活化和丙烷的活化。在后续步骤中，沸石的Bronsted酸位点负责涉及芳构化过程的聚合作用、环化和氢转移反应，而还原的镓物种负责脱氢反应。

1.The alkyl mechanism in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions on gallium-based catalysts involves a sequence of steps starting with the activation of propane by a dihydridogallium ion. This activation step is proposed as the rate-determining step (RDS) because it involves the initial interaction between the alkane and the active site, which can be slow due to the stability of the C-H bond in alkanes. In the alkyl mechanism, the dihydridogallium ion reacts with propane to form an alkylhydridogallium intermediate. This intermediate then decomposes to produce an alkene molecule and regenerate the dihydrido active site. However, the study suggests that the decomposition of the alkylhydrido intermediate occurs by reactions (17) and (18) instead, where the alkyl group is transferred to another site, leading to the formation of an alkylgallium ion and the release of hydrogen. This mechanism applies to different Ga species structures, including isolated Ga(I) species formed from binuclear oxidic gallium clusters during reduction.
2.Comparing the alkyl mechanism to the carbenium mechanism, the carbenium mechanism involves the formation of a carbenium ion intermediate, which is a positively charged species with a carbon atom bearing a positive charge. In contrast, the alkyl mechanism involves the formation of an alkylhydridogallium intermediate, which is a neutral species with a carbon atom bonded to a gallium atom. The carbenium mechanism is typically associated with acid-catalyzed reactions, while the alkyl mechanism is associated with metal-catalyzed reactions.
3.The CH activation step is proposed as the RDS because it involves the breaking of a strong C-H bond in the alkane, which requires a significant amount of energy. This step is also influenced by the nature of the active site and the strength of the interaction between the alkane and the active site. The stability of the intermediate formed during this step can also affect the overall reaction rate.
4.Under propane flow, dihydridogallium cations were never detected, indicating that they cannot be the active site for alkane activation. Instead, alkylgallium ions, probably methylethylgallium ions, were observed to be formed under propane aromatization conditions. These observations are consistent with the alkyl mechanism, where the alkyl group is transferred to another site, leading to the formation of an alkylgallium ion and the release of hydrogen.

1.在基于镓的催化剂上，丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应的烷基机制涉及一系列步骤，从二氢镓离子激活丙烷开始。这一步骤被提议为速率决定步骤(RDS)，因为它涉及烷烃与活性位点之间的初始相互作用，由于烷烃中C-H键的稳定性，这一步骤可能较慢。在烷基机制中，二氢镓离子与丙烷反应形成烷基氢镓中间体。然后，该中间体分解，产生一个烯烃分子并再生二氢活性位点。然而，研究表明，烷基氢镓中间体的分解是通过反应(17)和(18)进行的，其中烷基基团转移到另一个位点，导致形成烷基镓离子并释放氢气。这种机制适用于不同的Ga物种结构，包括在还原过程中从二核氧化镓簇形成的孤立Ga(I)物种。
2.将烷基机制与卡宾机制进行比较，卡宾机制涉及形成卡宾离子中间体，这是一种带有正电荷的碳原子的正电荷物种。相比之下，烷基机制涉及形成烷基氢镓中间体，这是一种带有与镓原子结合的碳原子的中性物种。卡宾机制通常与酸催化反应相关，而烷基机制与金属催化反应相关。
3.CH活化步骤被提议为RDS，因为它涉及在烷烃中断裂强C-H键，这需要大量的能量。这一步骤也受到活性位点的性质和烷烃与活性位点之间相互作用强度的影响。这一步骤中形成的中间体的稳定性也会影响整体反应速率。
4.在丙烷流下，从未检测到二氢镓阳离子，表明它们不能作为烷烃活化的活性位点。相反，在丙烷芳构化条件下观察到形成了烷基镓离子，可能是甲基乙基镓离子。这些观察结果与烷基机制一致，其中烷基基团转移到另一个位点，导致形成烷基镓离子并释放氢气。

1.The alkyl mechanism in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions on gallium-based catalysts involves several key steps. Initially, propane is activated by a gallium ion (Ga+) to form a gallium-propane complex (Ga+H(C3H7)). This complex can then undergo dehydrogenation to produce propene and regenerate the gallium ion, or it can rearrange to form an alkylgallium species (Ga+(CH3)(C2H5)). When hydrogen is present, it can react with the dihydridogallium ion (GaH2+) to form a gallium-propane complex, which then decomposes to produce propene and hydrogen. The formation of isolated Ga(I) species from binuclear oxidic gallium clusters involves the production of Lewis from Brnsted acid sites in a 1:1 basis. This process is accompanied by some de-alumination of the zeolite framework to produce extraframework alumina, which also helps to explain the decrease in Brnsted acidity and increase in Lewis acidity. When hydrogen is the reducing agent, the decomposition of the binuclear oxidic species is partially reversed when hydrogen flow is replaced by inert gas, but when the reducing agent is propane, the formation of isolated Ga(I) species is irreversible, probably because it is stabilized by alkyl groups bonded to gallium, that were seen to be formed and to be stable when propane flow is replaced by inert gas. The carbenium mechanism involves the formation of a carbenium ion intermediate, which then undergoes dehydrogenation to produce propene and a proton. The CH activation step is proposed as the rate-determining step (RDS) because it involves the breaking of a strong C-H bond. The alkyl mechanism applies to different Ga species structures, including isolated Ga(I) ions, dihydridogallium ions, and alkylgallium species.

3.当氢气是还原剂时,二核氧化物种的分解在氢气流被惰性气体取代时部分可逆。然而,当还原剂是丙烷时,孤立Ga(I)物种的形成是不可逆的,可能是因为它被与镓键合的烷基基团稳定。在氢气还原后观察到二氢化镓离子,但在氢气流被惰性气体取代时缓慢分解。这种缓慢分解表明二氢化镓离子在芳构化反应中不能介导氢气的解吸。然而,当氢气被丙烷取代时,二氢化物种似乎迅速被烷基镓离子取代。在丙烷流下,从未检测到二氢化镓阳离子。这些事实表明,二氢化镓离子不能作为烷烃活化的活性位点。
