[1] "McGregor et al. have reported that a VOx/Al2O3 catalyst completely encapsulated by coke deposits (see Figure 26) is active in butane dehydrogenation."
          [2] "The highest activity was observed at 700 C, a temperature at which the carbon deposits display a very ordered structure."
          [3] "It was concluded that radicals formed on the surface of coke facilitate the dehydrogenation reaction, albeit at elevated temperatures the noncatalytic conversion of propane is also relatively high."
          [4] "Furthermore, hybrid nanocarbon, comprising a diamond core and a graphitic shell, displayed activity for the dehydrogenation of propane, which was attributed to the presence of either ketone groups or structural defects in the graphitic material."
          [5] "Liu et al. prepared carbon-based ordered mesoporous systems that showed activity in the dehydrogenation of propane in the absence of steam or oxidants."
          [6] "The active sites were proposed to be oxygen-containing groups (CO), which are formed during a pretreatment step involving nitric acid."
          [7] "The fact that catalytic activity remained the same despite complete coke encapsulation is remarkable, as this extent of coking usually results in a drastic decrease in activity."
          [8] "The authors hypothesized that the carbon species formed on the catalyst surface were in fact catalyzing the reaction."

          [14] "The deposited coke (Fig. 10) can be characterised as curved graphene-like sheets."
          [15] "As a consequence of the apparent structural similarity between high-temperature coke deposits and CNFs, it was decided to study the activity of CNFs towards n-butane DH."
          [16] "After the initial induction period, during which coke is deposited on the surface of VOx/Al2O3 both catalytic systems show very similar behaviour."

          [6] "The quantity of hydrocarbonaceous material increases as a function of reaction temperature, confirming the results of the XPS study."
          [7] "The deposited carbon can therefore be considered conducting in nature and as such highly ordered, in agreement with THz-TDS studies."
          [8] "The nature of the carbonaceous material deposited on VOx/Al2O3 during n-butane dehydrogenation shows a strong dependence on reaction temperature."
          [9] "At high reaction temperatures, e.g. 973 K, much more extensive and highly ordered coke is deposited."
          [10] "The initial carbon deposits are most likely formed through the catalytic action of VOx units breaking down butane molecules."
          [11] "As such, any VOx sites will be rendered inaccessible to n-butane molecules."
          [12] "Despite this, the catalyst remains highly active, even after 180 min on stream."
          [13] "Indeed the yield of C4 hydrocarbons reaches its greatest value (40%) at this time."
          [14] "The deposited coke (Fig. 10) can be characterised as curved graphene-like sheets."
          [15] "As a consequence of the apparent structural similarity between high-temperature coke deposits and CNFs, it was decided to study the activity of CNFs towards n-butane DH."
          [16] "After the initial induction period, during which coke is deposited on the surface of VOx/Al2O3 both catalytic systems show very similar behaviour."
          [17] "Neither the CNFs nor the coked VOx/Al2O3 exhibit deactivation as a function of increasing exposure to n-butane."
          [18] "The above-mentioned data clearly show that the dehydrogenation of n-butane can be added to the list of reactions in which carbonaceous materials can provide high activity and selectivity."

[1] "Bulk nitrogen doping can efficiently improve the catalytic performance of carbon nanotubes (CNT) in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODH). The graphitic nitrogen plays a determining role in enhancing their activity by speeding up the activation of oxygen and decreasing the overall activation energy of the reaction."
          [2] "The doped CNT catalysts with suitable content of graphitic nitrogen are quite stable and more active for the ODH of propane."
          [3] "We believe that the graphitic nitrogen may play a determining role in enhancing the catalytic activity by decreasing the overall activation energy and speeding up the activation of oxygen."
          [4] "Apparently,the graphitic N played a vital role in reducing the overall activation energy (Fig. 3b) and consequently increasing the reaction rate."
          [5] "The improved surface coverage of blank active sites (y0) for propane conversion is therefore believed to be the reason for the enhanced ODH activity."
          [6] "The doped N atoms may facilitate propene to desorb from the surface due to the repulsion between the electron-rich graphitic surface and unsaturated C=C bonds of propene."

          [8] "A linear relationship between activation energy and the atomic abundance of graphitic N (N3, atom%) can be fitted by the empirical equation Ea = 117.232.7  N3 to quantitatively describe the role of graphitic N in decreasing the activation energy of ODH."
          [9] "Such a concept can be used for other reactions such as selective oxidation, electrochemical oxygen reduction, peroxidation, etc."

[1] "Metal-free ordered mesoporous carbons were demonstrated to be robust catalysts for direct dehydrogenation of propane to propylene, in the absence of any auxiliary steam, exhibiting high activity and selectivity, as well as long catalytic stability, in comparison with nanostructured carbons."
          [2] "The presence of surface carbonyl groups is responsible for the dehydrogenation activity."
          [3] "The large and well-ordered porosity of mesoporous carbon catalysts should also be beneficial for mass transport in catalytic reaction, exhibiting long time stability."
          [4] "The stable propylene yield higher than 38%, together with the steady propylene selectivity of approximately 88% during reaction of 100 h reported here, is a promising indication for industrial applications, taking into account the absence of auxiliary steam and the subsequent energy savings."

[1] "McGregor et al. have reported that a VOx/Al2O3 catalyst completely encapsulated by coke deposits (see Figure 26) is active in butane dehydrogenation."
          [2] "The highest activity was observed at 700 C, a temperature at which the carbon deposits display a very ordered structure."
          [3] "It was concluded that radicals formed on the surface of coke facilitate the dehydrogenation reaction, albeit at elevated temperatures the noncatalytic conversion of propane is also relatively high."
          [4] "Furthermore, hybrid nanocarbon, comprising a diamond core and a graphitic shell, displayed activity for the dehydrogenation of propane, which was attributed to the presence of either ketone groups or structural defects in the graphitic material."
          [5] "Liu et al. prepared carbon-based ordered mesoporous systems that showed activity in the dehydrogenation of propane in the absence of steam or oxidants."
          [6] "The active sites were proposed to be oxygen-containing groups (CO), which are formed during a pretreatment step involving nitric acid."
          [7] "The fact that catalytic activity remained the same despite complete coke encapsulation is remarkable, as this extent of coking usually results in a drastic decrease in activity."
          [8] "The authors hypothesized that the carbon species formed on the catalyst surface were in fact catalyzing the reaction."
          [9] "In view of this, the authors decided to test their hypothesis by using carbon nanofibers (CNFs) as a catalyst under similar conditions."
          [10] "Tellingly, CNFs proved to be catalytically active."
