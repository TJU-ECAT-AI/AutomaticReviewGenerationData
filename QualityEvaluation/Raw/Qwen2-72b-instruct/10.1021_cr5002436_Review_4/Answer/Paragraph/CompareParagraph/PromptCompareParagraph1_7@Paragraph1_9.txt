The unexpected catalytic activity of carbon-based materials, including coke deposits, carbon nanofibers (CNFs), and hybrid nanocarbons, in alkane dehydrogenation reactions has been extensively studied \[10.1021/cr5002436\_4\]. The VOx/Al2O3 catalyst, when completely encapsulated by coke deposits, remains active in butane dehydrogenation, suggesting that the carbon species on the catalyst surface may be catalyzing the reaction \[10.1021/cr5002436\_4\]. The highest activity is observed at 700 degrees Celsius, where the carbon deposits have a very ordered structure \[10.1021/cr5002436\_4\]. CNFs, tested under similar conditions, also prove to be catalytically active \[10.1021/cr5002436\_4\]. Radicals formed on the surface of coke are believed to facilitate the dehydrogenation reaction, although at high temperatures, noncatalytic conversion of propane is also relatively high \[10.1021/cr5002436\_4\]. Hybrid nanocarbons, with a diamond core and a graphitic shell, show activity in propane dehydrogenation, attributed to the presence of ketone groups or structural defects in the graphitic material \[10.1021/cr5002436\_4\]. These findings suggest that carbon-based materials can be developed as novel and efficient catalysts for alkane dehydrogenation reactions \[10.1021/cr5002436\_4\].
                
                Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: The discovery of the catalytic potential of carbon-based materials in alkane dehydrogenation reactions opens up new avenues for the development of efficient and sustainable catalysts. The role of surface chemistry, particularly the presence of radicals and structural defects, in facilitating the dehydrogenation reaction highlights the importance of understanding the fundamental mechanisms of catalysis in carbon-based materials. Future research efforts might focus on the synthesis of carbon-based materials with tailored surface properties, such as controlled defect density and surface functionalization, to enhance catalytic activity and selectivity. The exploration of novel carbon-based materials, such as graphene and carbon nanotubes, and their potential for catalyzing other reactions, such as selective oxidation and electrochemical oxygen reduction, could also be a promising direction. The development of efficient and sustainable carbon-based catalysts could have significant implications for the petrochemical industry, leading to reduced energy consumption and environmental impact.

4.6 Carbon-Based Catalysts
Carbon materials have been tested as the support in catalysts employed for various reactions, mostly because of their high surface area and the fact that these materials are both inexpensive and environmentally friendly. Moreover, discrete functionalities of activated carbon can catalyze an array of reactions, including alkane dehydrogenation. (250) McGregor et al. have reported that a VOx/Al2O3 catalyst completely encapsulated by coke deposits (see Figure 26) is active in butane dehydrogenation. (215) The fact that catalytic activity remained the same despite complete coke encapsulation is remarkable, as this extent of coking usually results in a drastic decrease in activity. The authors hypothesized that the carbon species formed on the catalyst surface were in fact catalyzing the reaction. The highest activity was observed at 700 °C, a temperature at which the carbon deposits display a very ordered structure. In view of this, the authors decided to test their hypothesis by using carbon nanofibers (CNFs) as a catalyst under similar conditions. Tellingly, CNFs proved to be catalytically active. It was concluded that radicals formed on the surface of coke facilitate the dehydrogenation reaction, albeit at elevated temperatures the noncatalytic conversion of propane is also relatively high. However, elevated temperatures also lead to a drop in selectivity, as cracking becomes the dominant reaction. Interestingly, the latter was not the case in the work of McGregor et al., who reported a selectivity toward butenes of ∼80%. Furthermore, hybrid nanocarbon, comprising a diamond core and a graphitic shell, displayed activity for the dehydrogenation of propane, which was attributed to the presence of either ketone groups or structural defects in the graphitic material. (251)
In previous work, CNFs had been shown to be active in the oxidative dehydrogenation of n-butane, although in this case surface oxygen groups were believed to be the active sites. (252) Furthermore, nitrogen doped carbon nanotubes (CNTs) showed some activity in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane, although conversion and selectivity were relatively low. (253)
Liu et al. prepared carbon-based ordered mesoporous systems that showed activity in the dehydrogenation of propane in the absence of steam or oxidants. (254) The active sites were proposed to be oxygen-containing groups (C═O), which are formed during a pretreatment step involving nitric acid. The catalyst shows remarkable long-term stability, displaying conversion and selectivity values of 45% and 85%, respectively, after 100 h of time on stream at 600 °C. Experiments in which carbon nanotubes were tested under similar conditions resulted in low activity.
Neylon et al. studied the activity of supported early transition metal (groups 5 and 6) nitrides and carbides in butane dehydrogenation, (255, 256) as the catalytic properties of these materials are believed to be similar to those of platinum. Interestingly, Mo, V, and W carbides and nitrides showed activity in both dehydrogenation and hydrogenolysis, displaying specific activities similar to those of a commercial Pt&ndash;Sn/Al2O3 catalyst. Niobium carbide and nitride did not show any activity. The group 6 compounds tested were found to be more active, albeit they primarily catalyzed hydrogenolysis. In Table 8 are shown the catalytic data of the carbon-based dehydrogenation catalysts as reported by McGregor et al. and Liu et al.
In addition, silica supported metal sulfides, such as ZnS, FeS, CuS, CoS, MnS, NiS, and MoS, were tested for the dehydrogenation of isobutane, and were found to perform significantly better than their respective oxides. The materials show higher initial yields than commercial CrOx and Pt&ndash;Sn catalyst, but they deactivate over a few hours due to sulfur leaching. (257)

4.7 Other Formulations
Indium is known to share many of the catalytic properties of gallium, a prominent example being the activity that both metals display in NOx reduction. (258) These similarities are relatively unsurprising, particularly taking into account the adjacency of Ga and In within the same group of the periodic table. Interestingly, Halasz et al. have tested the reactivity of propane on Ga- and In-loaded ZSM-5 and found both catalysts to be active in PDH and display similar activity and selectivity values. (259) However, both Ga/ZSM-5 and In/ZSM-5 did not exclusively yield propylene, but also larger aromatic molecules. Whereas dehydrogenation and aromatization activity were found to be associated with Lewis acidity, cracking and coke formation were related to Brønsted acidity.
Chen et al. mixed In2O3 with other metal oxides in an effort to obtain an active PDH catalyst. (260) A mixed oxide consisting of 20% In2O3 and 80% Al2O3 showed the highest propylene yield, as shown in Figure 27. Small In2O3 clusters on the surface of the catalyst were reduced under reaction conditions to form small metallic In particles. Because no correlation between surface acidity and reactivity was observed, these metallic particles were believed to be the species active in dehydrogenation. The reduction of these particles is a slow process during reaction, and thus a considerable amount of time is required to attain the optimal yields. By prereducing the catalyst with hydrogen, high conversions were immediately obtained. Similar conclusions were reached in a study involving a series of oxide-supported In2O3-based catalysts prepared by incipient wetness impregnation. (261) Al2O3 and ZrO2 were more suitable supports than SiO2, as the interaction of the indium oxide was stronger with the former carriers, resulting in a better distribution of small nanoparticles.
CO2 was reported by the same authors to have a beneficial effect, which was ascribed to the occurrence of the reverse water&ndash;gas shift reaction (RWGS). Furthermore, sufficiently high CO2:hydrocarbon ratios proved capable of retarding catalyst deactivation.
Albeit supported iron oxides have been known to be active in ethylbenzene dehydrogenation since 1946, (264) it was not until the 1990s that Geus and co-workers investigated the activity of supported iron oxide in the dehydrogenation of 1-butene to 1&ndash;3 butadiene. (265-268) The authors determined that Fe3+ is the catalytically active species. The catalysts deactivate rapidly due to coke deposition and reduction of Fe2O3 to Fe3O4. However, catalyst stability is significantly enhanced by the addition of potassium. On the one hand, K stabilizes the active phase by forming KFeO2, which donates electrons to the active iron species and prevents their reduction. On the other hand, the acidic groups responsible for coke formation are poisoned by potassium ions. Optimal stability was obtained with a FeOx monolayer, regardless of the type of support employed. An interesting sulfate-promoted FeOx/Al2O3 catalytic system was reported by Sun et al., which showed excellent activity in propane dehydrogenation, accompanied by relatively high stability. (269) The sulfate groups were found to withdraw electrons from Fe, enhancing the acidity of Fe sites and improving activity. Unfortunately, the sulfate groups were not completely stable, and the loss of sulfate groups as SO2 resulted in the irreversible deactivation of the catalyst by carburization and sintering.
In a recent publication by Yun et al., an active propane dehydrogenation catalyst was obtained by incorporating Fe ions in the framework of ZSM-5 zeolites. The catalytic activity was explained by the redox properties of these sites (Fe2+ and Fe3+ redox cycle) that resulted in the formation of radical intermediates. (270) Shimada et al. investigated the use of activated carbon, promoted by Fe, as a catalyst for the dehydrogenation of isobutane. (250) In the absence of iron, activated carbon was only able to afford an isobutene yield of ∼10%, albeit this value increased to 40% upon the addition of 3.5 wt % Fe3O4 in the presence of CO2. In addition to dehydrogenation, the iron oxide also catalyzes the RWGS reaction. Indeed, XRD results show that the iron oxide is reduced by the hydrocarbon feed, and subsequently reoxidized by the CO2 in the feed.
The conversion of light alkanes to aromatics on Zn supported on H-ZSM-5 zeolites has received considerable attention. (100, 271-275) Isolated Zn2+ species with a tetrahedral orientation were deemed to be the active sites, with a reaction mechanism similar to that reported on GaOx-based dehydrogenation catalysts. (276-280) These species resided in the cation exchange sites of the zeolite, effectively providing the counter-charge for two Al species. The proximity of Al species was found to be important, as calculations show basic Al-bound oxygen is required to perform the C&ndash;H cleavage and form an Al&ndash;OH group. This is important, as, similar to Ga, Zn&ndash;H and Zn&ndash;OH groups are difficult to regenerate. Furthermore, these species were found to be highly stable, which is important as volatile Zn species may be formed at dehydrogenation reaction conditions.
The activity of zinc titanate in the dehydrogenation of light olefins has also been studied, the catalysts being prepared either as hydrogels or as mixed oxides. Chen et al. investigated mixed oxides with different zinc to titanium ratios and found that a Zn:Ti ratio of 2 resulted in the most active catalyst. Cubic Zn2TiO3 was deemed to be the active species in dehydrogenation, although the overall activity of these catalysts was found to be limited. (281-283) More recently, isolated Zn2+ species deposited on a silica support were found to be active in propane dehydrogenation. (284) The active sites were determined to be coordinatively unsaturated Zn2+ Lewis acids sites located on a tri-membered siloxane ring on the silica support. During the catalytic reaction, the Zn is transformed to tricoordinated species due to the temperature increase. DFT calculations suggested a reaction mechanism akin to that observed over CrOx and GaOx catalysts.
In Table 9 are shown the catalytic activity data of the indium- and iron-based dehydrogenation catalysts discussed.
