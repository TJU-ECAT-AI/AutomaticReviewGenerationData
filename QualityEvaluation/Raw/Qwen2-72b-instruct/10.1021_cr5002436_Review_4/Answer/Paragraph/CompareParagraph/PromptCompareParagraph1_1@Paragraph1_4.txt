The unexpected catalytic activity of carbon-based materials, including coke deposits, carbon nanofibers (CNFs), and hybrid nanocarbons, in alkane dehydrogenation reactions has been a subject of significant interest and investigation \[10.1021/cr5002436\_4\]. The VOx/Al2O3 catalyst, when completely encapsulated by coke deposits, remains active in butane dehydrogenation, suggesting that the carbon species on the catalyst surface may be catalyzing the reaction \[10.1021/cr5002436\_4\]. The highest activity is observed at 700 degrees Celsius, where the carbon deposits have a very ordered structure \[10.1021/cr5002436\_4\]. CNFs, tested under similar conditions, also prove to be catalytically active \[10.1021/cr5002436\_4\]. Radicals formed on the surface of coke are believed to facilitate the dehydrogenation reaction, although at high temperatures, noncatalytic conversion of propane is also relatively high \[10.1021/cr5002436\_4\]. Hybrid nanocarbons, with a diamond core and a graphitic shell, show activity in propane dehydrogenation, attributed to the presence of ketone groups or structural defects in the graphitic material \[10.1021/cr5002436\_4\]. These findings suggest that carbon-based materials can be developed as novel and efficient catalysts for alkane dehydrogenation reactions \[10.1021/cr5002436\_4\].
                
                Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: The discovery of the unexpected catalytic activity of carbon-based materials in alkane dehydrogenation reactions opens up new avenues for the development of efficient and sustainable catalysts. The role of surface chemistry, particularly the presence of radicals and structural defects, in facilitating the dehydrogenation reaction is a promising area for further investigation. The influence of temperature on the catalytic activity and the stability of carbon-based materials is also a critical factor to consider in the design of novel catalysts. Future research efforts might focus on the optimization of carbon-based catalysts for specific alkane dehydrogenation reactions, the exploration of new carbon-based materials with enhanced catalytic properties, and the development of strategies to mitigate the noncatalytic conversion of propane at high temperatures. The potential of carbon-based materials to provide high activity and selectivity in alkane dehydrogenation reactions, without the need for auxiliary steam or oxidants, is a significant advantage for industrial applications, considering the energy savings and environmental benefits.

                Carbonaceous materials, including coke deposits and carbon nanofibers, exhibit unexpected catalytic activity in alkane dehydrogenation reactions \[10.1016/j.jcat.2009.11.016\]. This phenomenon is confirmed through a comparison of the activity of coked VOx/Al2O3 and carbon nanofibres \[10.1016/j.jcat.2009.11.016\]. The nature of the carbonaceous material deposited on VOx/Al2O3 during n-butane dehydrogenation shows a strong dependence on reaction temperature \[10.1016/j.jcat.2009.11.016\]. At high reaction temperatures, much more extensive and highly ordered coke is deposited \[10.1016/j.jcat.2009.11.016\]. The deposited carbon can be considered conducting in nature and as such highly ordered \[10.1016/j.jcat.2009.11.016\]. The initial carbon deposits are most likely formed through the catalytic action of VOx units breaking down butane molecules \[10.1016/j.jcat.2009.11.016\]. Despite the VOx sites being rendered inaccessible to n-butane molecules, the catalyst remains highly active, even after 180 min on stream \[10.1016/j.jcat.2009.11.016\]. The yield of C4 hydrocarbons reaches its greatest value at this time \[10.1016/j.jcat.2009.11.016\]. The deposited coke can be characterised as curved graphene-like sheets \[10.1016/j.jcat.2009.11.016\]. The activity of CNFs towards n-butane DH is similar to that of coked VOx/Al2O3 \[10.1016/j.jcat.2009.11.016\]. Neither the CNFs nor the coked VOx/Al2O3 exhibit deactivation as a function of increasing exposure to n-butane \[10.1016/j.jcat.2009.11.016\]. The dehydrogenation of n-butane can be added to the list of reactions in which carbonaceous materials can provide high activity and selectivity \[10.1016/j.jcat.2009.11.016\].

                Nitrogen-doped carbon nanotubes (CNTs) exhibit enhanced catalytic activity in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODH) \[10.1039/c3cc41500g\]. The graphitic nitrogen in the CNTs plays a key role in this enhancement by speeding up the activation of oxygen and decreasing the overall activation energy of the reaction \[10.1039/c3cc41500g\]. The doped CNT catalysts with suitable content of graphitic nitrogen are stable and more active for the ODH of propane \[10.1039/c3cc41500g\]. The graphitic nitrogen reduces the overall activation energy and increases the reaction rate \[10.1039/c3cc41500g\]. The improved surface coverage of active sites for propane conversion is believed to be the reason for the enhanced ODH activity \[10.1039/c3cc41500g\]. The doped nitrogen atoms may also facilitate propene to desorb from the surface due to the repulsion between the electron-rich graphitic surface and unsaturated C=C bonds of propene \[10.1039/c3cc41500g\]. A linear relationship between activation energy and the atomic abundance of graphitic N can be fitted to quantitatively describe the role of graphitic N in decreasing the activation energy of ODH \[10.1039/c3cc41500g\]. This concept can be applied to other reactions such as selective oxidation, electrochemical oxygen reduction, peroxidation, etc. \[10.1039/c3cc41500g\].

                Ordered mesoporous carbons, without any metal, have been shown to be robust catalysts for the direct dehydrogenation of propane to propylene, without the need for auxiliary steam \[10.1039/c1cc12806j\]. They exhibit high activity, selectivity, and long-term stability, outperforming nanostructured carbons \[10.1039/c1cc12806j\]. The presence of surface carbonyl groups is crucial for the dehydrogenation activity \[10.1039/c1cc12806j\]. The large and well-ordered porosity of mesoporous carbon catalysts is beneficial for mass transport in catalytic reactions, leading to long-term stability \[10.1039/c1cc12806j\]. The stable propylene yield of over 38% and the steady propylene selectivity of about 88% over 100 hours of reaction are promising for industrial applications, especially considering the absence of auxiliary steam and the resulting energy savings \[10.1039/c1cc12806j\].
                
                Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: The unexpected catalytic activity of carbon-based materials in alkane dehydrogenation reactions, as highlighted by the studies discussed, opens up new avenues for the development of efficient and novel catalysts. The findings suggest that the surface chemistry and structure of carbon-based materials, such as the presence of radicals, ketone groups, structural defects, and graphitic nitrogen, play a crucial role in facilitating dehydrogenation reactions. The temperature dependence of catalytic activity and the stability of these materials under prolonged exposure to reactants are also significant factors to consider in catalyst design. Future research efforts could focus on the optimization of carbon-based materials for specific dehydrogenation reactions, the exploration of new carbon-based materials with tailored surface properties, and the integration of these materials with traditional metal-based catalysts to enhance overall catalytic performance. Additionally, the development of methods to control the deposition and structure of carbon deposits could lead to the creation of more efficient and stable catalysts. The potential of carbon-based materials to reduce energy consumption and increase selectivity in dehydrogenation reactions could have significant implications for industrial processes, particularly in the production of propylene and other valuable hydrocarbons.
