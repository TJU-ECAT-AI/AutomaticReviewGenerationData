        Carbon-based materials, including coke deposits, carbon nanofibers (CNFs), and hybrid nanocarbons, exhibit unexpected catalytic activity in alkane dehydrogenation reactions \[10.1021/cr5002436_4\]. The VOx/Al2O3 catalyst, when completely encapsulated by coke deposits, remains active in butane dehydrogenation, suggesting that the carbon species on the catalyst surface may be catalyzing the reaction \[10.1021/cr5002436_4\]. The highest activity is observed at 700 degrees Celsius, where the carbon deposits have a very ordered structure \[10.1021/cr5002436_4\]. CNFs, tested under similar conditions, also prove to be catalytically active \[10.1021/cr5002436_4\]. Radicals formed on the surface of coke are believed to facilitate the dehydrogenation reaction, although at high temperatures, noncatalytic conversion of propane is also relatively high \[10.1021/cr5002436_4\]. Hybrid nanocarbons, with a diamond core and a graphitic shell, show activity in propane dehydrogenation, attributed to the presence of ketone groups or structural defects in the graphitic material \[10.1021/cr5002436_4\]. These findings suggest that carbon-based materials can be developed as novel and efficient catalysts for alkane dehydrogenation reactions \[10.1021/cr5002436_4\].
        Carbonaceous materials, including coke deposits and carbon nanofibers, exhibit unexpected catalytic activity in alkane dehydrogenation reactions \[10.1016/j.jcat.2009.11.016\]. This phenomenon is confirmed through a comparison of the activity of coked VOx/Al2O3 and carbon nanofibres \[10.1016/j.jcat.2009.11.016\]. The nature of the carbonaceous material deposited on VOx/Al2O3 during n-butane dehydrogenation shows a strong dependence on reaction temperature \[10.1016/j.jcat.2009.11.016\]. At high reaction temperatures, much more extensive and highly ordered coke is deposited \[10.1016/j.jcat.2009.11.016\]. The deposited carbon can be considered conducting in nature and as such highly ordered \[10.1016/j.jcat.2009.11.016\]. The initial carbon deposits are most likely formed through the catalytic action of VOx units breaking down butane molecules \[10.1016/j.jcat.2009.11.016\]. Despite the VOx sites being rendered inaccessible to n-butane molecules, the catalyst remains highly active, even after 180 min on stream \[10.1016/j.jcat.2009.11.016\]. The yield of C4 hydrocarbons reaches its greatest value at this time \[10.1016/j.jcat.2009.11.016\]. The deposited coke can be characterised as curved graphene-like sheets \[10.1016/j.jcat.2009.11.016\]. The activity of CNFs towards n-butane DH is similar to that of coked VOx/Al2O3 \[10.1016/j.jcat.2009.11.016\]. Neither the CNFs nor the coked VOx/Al2O3 exhibit deactivation as a function of increasing exposure to n-butane \[10.1016/j.jcat.2009.11.016\]. The dehydrogenation of n-butane can be added to the list of reactions in which carbonaceous materials can provide high activity and selectivity \[10.1016/j.jcat.2009.11.016\].
        Nitrogen-doped carbon nanotubes (CNTs) exhibit enhanced catalytic activity in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODH) \[10.1039/c3cc41500g\]. The graphitic nitrogen in the CNTs plays a key role in this enhancement by speeding up the activation of oxygen and decreasing the overall activation energy of the reaction \[10.1039/c3cc41500g\]. The doped CNT catalysts with suitable content of graphitic nitrogen are stable and more active for the ODH of propane \[10.1039/c3cc41500g\]. The graphitic nitrogen reduces the overall activation energy and increases the reaction rate \[10.1039/c3cc41500g\]. The improved surface coverage of active sites for propane conversion is believed to be the reason for the enhanced ODH activity \[10.1039/c3cc41500g\]. The doped nitrogen atoms may also facilitate propene to desorb from the surface due to the repulsion between the electron-rich graphitic surface and unsaturated C=C bonds of propene \[10.1039/c3cc41500g\]. A linear relationship between activation energy and the atomic abundance of graphitic N can be fitted to quantitatively describe the role of graphitic N in decreasing the activation energy of ODH \[10.1039/c3cc41500g\]. This concept can be applied to other reactions such as selective oxidation, electrochemical oxygen reduction, peroxidation, etc. \[10.1039/c3cc41500g\].
        Ordered mesoporous carbons, without any metal, have been shown to be robust catalysts for the direct dehydrogenation of propane to propylene, without the need for auxiliary steam \[10.1039/c1cc12806j\]. They exhibit high activity, selectivity, and long-term stability, outperforming nanostructured carbons \[10.1039/c1cc12806j\]. The presence of surface carbonyl groups is crucial for the dehydrogenation activity \[10.1039/c1cc12806j\]. The large and well-ordered porosity of mesoporous carbon catalysts is beneficial for mass transport in catalytic reactions, leading to long-term stability \[10.1039/c1cc12806j\]. The stable propylene yield of over 38% and the steady propylene selectivity of about 88% over 100 hours of reaction are promising for industrial applications, especially considering the absence of auxiliary steam and the resulting energy savings \[10.1039/c1cc12806j\].
        ※※※
        Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: The unexpected catalytic activity of carbon-based materials in alkane dehydrogenation reactions, as revealed by the studies summarized above, opens up new avenues for the development of novel and efficient carbon-based catalysts. The findings suggest that the surface chemistry and structure of carbon-based materials, such as the presence of radicals, graphitic nitrogen, and surface carbonyl groups, play a crucial role in facilitating dehydrogenation reactions. The temperature dependence of catalytic activity and the role of highly ordered carbon deposits in maintaining activity even under conditions that would typically lead to deactivation are also noteworthy. Future research efforts might focus on the detailed mechanisms of these reactions, the optimization of carbon-based catalysts for specific applications, and the exploration of new carbon-based materials with tailored surface properties. The potential for energy savings and improved selectivity in industrial processes, as demonstrated by the use of ordered mesoporous carbons in propane dehydrogenation, highlights the importance of further investigating the catalytic potential of carbon-based materials. The concept of nitrogen doping in CNTs to enhance catalytic activity could be extended to other reactions and materials, potentially leading to the development of a new class of efficient catalysts for various chemical processes.
