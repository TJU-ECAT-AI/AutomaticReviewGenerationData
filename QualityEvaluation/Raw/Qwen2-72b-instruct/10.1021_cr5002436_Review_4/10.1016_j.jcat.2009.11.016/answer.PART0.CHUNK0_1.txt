[1] "In this work, we show for the first time that carbonaceous material, coke, deposited during reaction over VOx/Al2O3 can act as an active catalyst in the non-oxidative dehydrogenation of n-butane."
[2] "Carbon-based catalysts represent an important new class of potential catalysts for DH and ODH reactions."
[3] "The role of carbonaceous deposits in DH and ODH reactions has been the subject of extensive research."
[4] "In contrast to many other reaction systems however, in DH reactions polyaromatic coke deposits are not always directly implicated in catalyst deactivation."
[5] "Notably, significant deactivation was not observed over a period of 100 h."
[6] "A wide range of experimental techniques have been applied to the study of coke and carbonaceous materials in the literature."
[7] "One reason for this is that no single technique can provide the wealth of information required to understand the nature of such complex structures."
[8] "For this reason, in this work we have applied a number of complementary techniques to the study of coke formed over VOx/Al2O3 during butane dehydrogenation."
[9] "One such method is THz-TDS, and this work represents the first application of this spectroscopy in the study of coke."
[10] "The nature of the coke deposited during reaction has been probed in detail by THz-TDS and TEM, while XAS, NMR, EPR and Raman spectroscopies provide additional insights."
[11] "These techniques show that as the reaction temperature increases more ordered carbon deposits are formed."
[12] "Further, we propose that these structures may have a distinct catalytic function."
[13] "The chemical nature of carbonaceous material deposited on VOx/Al2O3 during n-butane dehydrogenation reactions at temperatures of 873 K and below has been the subject of previous investigations."
[14] "The mechanism of the formation of such coke has been postulated to proceed via a polystyrene like intermediate."
[15] "It is likely that the precise role that these deposits play is heavily influenced by reaction conditions."
[16] "In the present study the quantity of coke formed is probed by XPS, elemental microanalysis and 13C CP-MAS NMR spectroscopy."
[17] "NMR and TEM alongside THz-TDS, XAS, Raman and EPR spectroscopies provide additional insights into the nature of the deposited material."
[18] "These techniques show that as the reaction temperature increases more ordered carbon deposits are formed."
[19] "Further, we propose that these structures may have a distinct catalytic function."
[20] "The nature of the carbonaceous material deposited on VOx/Al2O3 during n-butane dehydrogenation shows a strong dependence on reaction temperature."
[21] "At high reaction temperatures highly ordered, conducting networks of polyaromatic hydrocarbons encapsulate the catalyst particle."
[22] "At low reaction temperatures the coke is much less ordered in nature, consisting of discrete molecular units with substantial areas of the catalyst surface left exposed and available for reaction."
[23] "Spectroscopic and microscopic techniques have identified two distinct categories of coke deposit over VOx/Al2O3, as described above."
[24] "At low reaction temperatures, e.g. 823 K, the coke is poorly ordered and not present as an extended, graphene-like network."
[25] "At high reaction temperatures, e.g. 973 K, much more extensive and highly ordered coke is deposited."
[26] "Relating the catalyst activity shown in Fig. 2, to the nature of the coke, clear trends are apparent."
[27] "In the low-temperature regime, where the coke consists of discrete molecular units and more amorphous carbon, the catalyst deactivates with time-on-stream with both yield and conversion decreasing."
[28] "Selectivity towards 1-butene and 1,3-butadiene remains fairly constant throughout."
[29] "This suggests that the reaction mechanism is relatively unaffected by coke deposition, and therefore the bulk of catalytic activity is at all times provided by sites present at the start of the reaction, namely VOx units on the alumina surface."
[30] "In the high-temperature regime, where the coke consists of more extended and ordered carbon networks, very different catalytic behaviour is observed."
[31] "The calculated yield increases as a function of time-on-stream indicating activation of the catalyst as coke is deposited."
[32] "Furthermore, after a short induction period, conversion reaches a constant value."
[33] "Both these factors demonstrate that the VOx/Al2O3 catalyst does not suffer from deactivation at high reaction temperatures, despite a greater quantity of coke being present as compared to low reaction temperatures."
[34] "Selectivity to the dehydrogenation products shows a more marked dependence on time-on-stream than at low temperatures."
[35] "For example, selectivity to 1-butene increases from an initial value of 32% to a steady-state value of 48%."
[36] "This steady-state value is achieved around the same time as conversion reaches steady-state at 50%."
[37] "A notable decrease in selectivity towards carbon deposition from 66% to 20% occurs over the same period."
[38] "These changes are perhaps indicative of a change in the reaction mechanism and in the nature of the catalytically active site."
[39] "That a change in the catalytically active site has occurred is confirmed by TEM data, which show that the VOx/Al2O3 catalyst particles are encapsulated in carbon after reaction at 973 K."
[40] "As such, any VOx sites will be rendered inaccessible to n-butane molecules."
[41] "Despite this, the catalyst remains highly active, even after 180 min on stream."
[42] "Indeed the yield of C4 hydrocarbons reaches its greatest value (40%) at this time."
[43] "The initial carbon deposits are most likely formed through the catalytic action of VOx units breaking down butane molecules."
[44] "However, after 180 min on stream the carbonaceous material has a thickness of multiple layers, despite the inaccessible nature of the original catalyst."
[45] "Further carbon formation therefore appears to have taken place upon the deposits."
[46] "These data therefore suggest the possibility that catalytic activity is provided by the carbonaceous deposits themselves."
[47] "TEM data presented in Section 3.4.2 revealed significant structural similarities between carbonaceous material deposited at high temperature over VOx/Al2O3 and nanostructured carbons, such as CNFs."
[48] "Notably, the deposited coke (Fig. 10) can be characterised as curved graphene-like sheets."
[49] "CNFs can be considered as graphene sheets formed into conical sections."
[50] "As a consequence of the apparent structural similarity between high-temperature coke deposits and CNFs, it was decided to study the activity of CNFs towards n-butane DH."
[51] "Table 2 compares the selectivity and conversion of VOx/ Al2O3 and the CNFs at a reaction temperature of 973 K."
[52] "After the initial induction period, during which coke is deposited on the surface of VOx/Al2O3 both catalytic systems show very similar behaviour."
[53] "After 180 min on stream VOx/Al2O3 shows a conversion of 50%, a yield of C4 DH products of 40%, a selectivity to 1-butene of 48% and to 1,3-butadiene of 32%."
[54] "The corresponding values for the CNF are 41%, 32%, 46% and 34%, respectively."
[55] "This similarity in catalytic behaviour between coked VOx/Al2O3 and the CNF supports the hypothesis that carbonaceous deposits on the surface of the supported metal-oxide catalyst are indeed active for n-butane dehydrogenation."
[56] "Neither the CNFs nor the coked VOx/Al2O3 exhibit deactivation as a function of increasing exposure to n-butane."
[57] "It is also worth noting that very slight increases in the 1-butene selectivity are observed towards the end of the reaction period at low temperatures over VOx/Al2O3."
[58] "These changes may also be due to the build-up of small amounts of active coke deposits."
[59] "While their role in the direct dehydrogenation of n-butane has not previously received attention, coked VOx/Al2O3 catalysts have previously been shown to exhibit slightly higher selectivity in the dehydrogenation of alkanes than as-prepared catalysts."
[60] "However, in that study the possible catalytic action of the coke was not considered."
[61] "Increasing the selectivity of zeolite catalysts through carbon deposition is a strategy employed industrially in xylene isomerisation."
[62] "Furthermore, the activity of CNTs in the oxidative dehydrogenation of n-butane has recently been demonstrated."
[63] "As with the present work little or no deactivation was observed in the reaction on a carbon-based catalyst over the timescale investigated."
[64] "Considering other reactant molecules, the activity of coke deposits and other carbonaceous materials in the ODH of ethylbenzene is well established with the activity of these known since at least the 1970s."
[65] "This area has been reviewed by Lisovskii and Aharoni and Cavani and Trifiro."
[66] "Similarly to the results reported herein, Lisovskii and Aharoni report that the activity of a metal-oxide catalyst reaches a steady-state after an induction period in which the entire catalyst surface is covered by carbonaceous material."
[67] "While the reaction mechanism may be different between ODH and direct DH reactions (the active sites for n-butane and ethylbenzene ODH over carbonaceous materials are believed to be carboxyl functionalities formed through oxidation of the carbon surface) there are a number of similarities between the nature of the active carbon."
[68] "In both cases, highly ordered materials represent excellent catalysts."
[69] "Additionally, it has been noted by a number of authors that the activity of coke deposits in ethylbenzene ODH correlates with their degree of paramagnetism, with a greater concentration of unpaired electrons resulting in higher activity."
[70] "Such sites could also provide the active centres in the studies reported in the present work, since paramagnetic organic radicals were observed by EPR spectroscopy."
[71] "The unpaired electrons present in such radicals may be capable of extracting hydrogen atoms from the n-butane feed, resulting in dehydrogenation."
[72] "Both the deposition of new carbonaceous material (with associated paramagnetic centres) during reaction and the recombination of the extracted H atoms could then occur in such a way as to replenish the source of unpaired electrons."
[73] "The phenomenon of carbonaceous deposits providing, or enhancing, catalytic activity is not restricted to DH or ODH reactions."
[74] "Intriguingly, carbonaceous overlayers formed on mineral surfaces during FisherTropsch-type reactions have also been proposed as the active phase for catalytic reduction reactions in protostellar nebulae."
[75] "Organic radicals present in such overlayers have been suggested as contributing to their catalytic activity."
[76] "Elsewhere, the hydrogenation of carboncarbon double bonds over supported metal catalysts has been shown to be strongly dependent upon the nature of any deposited carbonaceous material."
[77] "Such reactions have been suggested to proceed, at least in part, through the transfer of hydrogen from an adsorbed hydrocarbonaceous overlayer onto which the reactant is adsorbed."
[78] "Furthermore, carbon deposited during the reaction plays a key role in the hydrogenation of alkynes over Pd catalysts, forming a catalytically active Pd-Cx surface phase."
[79] "Carbonaceous deposits and related materials therefore show activity in a wide number of reactions."
[80] "The above-mentioned data clearly show that the dehydrogenation of n-butane can be added to the list of reactions in which carbonaceous materials can provide high activity and selectivity."

1.Various carbon-based materials, including coke deposits, carbon nanofibers, and hybrid nanocarbons, exhibit unexpected catalytic activity in alkane dehydrogenation reactions. This phenomenon is attributed to the structural and electronic properties of these materials, which can provide active sites for the dehydrogenation process. The activity of carbonaceous materials is influenced by factors such as temperature and surface chemistry. At higher temperatures, more ordered carbon deposits are formed, which can have distinct catalytic functions. The role of carbonaceous deposits in dehydrogenation reactions has been extensively researched, and it has been found that polyaromatic coke deposits do not always lead to catalyst deactivation. In fact, carbon-based catalysts can remain active over extended periods without significant deactivation. This unexpected catalytic activity of carbon-based materials has implications for the development of novel and efficient carbon-based catalysts for alkane dehydrogenation reactions.
