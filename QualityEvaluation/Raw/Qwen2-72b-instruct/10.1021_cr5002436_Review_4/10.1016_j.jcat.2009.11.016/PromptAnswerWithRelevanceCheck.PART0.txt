1.碳基材料，包括焦炭沉积物和碳纳米纤维，在烷烃脱氢反应中表现出意外的催化活性。这一现象通过比较coked VOx/Al2O3和碳纳米纤维的活性得到证实。在n-丁烷脱氢过程中，沉积在VOx/Al2O3上的碳基材料的性质强烈依赖于反应温度。在高温下，沉积了更多且高度有序的焦炭。沉积的碳可以被认为是导电性质的，因此是高度有序的。最初的碳沉积物很可能通过VOx单元分解丁烷分子的催化作用形成。尽管VOx位点对n-丁烷分子变得不可接近，但催化剂即使在180分钟后仍保持高度活性。C4烃的产量在这一点上达到最大值。沉积的焦炭可以被描述为弯曲的石墨烯状片。CNFs对n-丁烷DH的活性与coked VOx/Al2O3相似。无论是CNFs还是coked VOx/Al2O3，随着n-丁烷暴露量的增加，都不会出现失活。n-丁烷的脱氢可以添加到碳基材料可以提供高活性和选择性的反应列表中。

[1] "In this work, we show for the first time that carbonaceous material, coke, deposited during reaction over VOx/Al2O3 can act as an active catalyst in the non-oxidative dehydrogenation of n-butane."
[2] "Carbon-based catalysts represent an important new class of potential catalysts for DH and ODH reactions."
[3] "The role of carbonaceous deposits in DH and ODH reactions has been the subject of extensive research."
[4] "In contrast to many other reaction systems however, in DH reactions polyaromatic coke deposits are not always directly implicated in catalyst deactivation."
[5] "Notably, significant deactivation was not observed over a period of 100 h."
[6] "A wide range of experimental techniques have been applied to the study of coke and carbonaceous materials in the literature."
[7] "One reason for this is that no single technique can provide the wealth of information required to understand the nature of such complex structures."
[8] "For this reason, in this work we have applied a number of complementary techniques to the study of coke formed over VOx/Al2O3 during butane dehydrogenation."
[9] "One such method is THz-TDS, and this work represents the first application of this spectroscopy in the study of coke."
[10] "The nature of the coke deposited during reaction has been probed in detail by THz-TDS and TEM, while XAS, NMR, EPR and Raman spectroscopies provide additional insights."
[11] "These techniques show that as the reaction temperature increases more ordered carbon deposits are formed."
[12] "Further, we propose that these structures may have a distinct catalytic function."
[13] "The chemical nature of carbonaceous material deposited on VOx/Al2O3 during n-butane dehydrogenation reactions at temperatures of 873 K and below has been the subject of previous investigations."
[14] "The mechanism of the formation of such coke has been postulated to proceed via a polystyrene like intermediate."
[15] "It is likely that the precise role that these deposits play is heavily influenced by reaction conditions."
[16] "In the present study the quantity of coke formed is probed by XPS, elemental microanalysis and 13C CP-MAS NMR spectroscopy."
[17] "NMR and TEM alongside THz-TDS, XAS, Raman and EPR spectroscopies provide additional insights into the nature of the deposited material."
[18] "These techniques show that as the reaction temperature increases more ordered carbon deposits are formed."
[19] "Further, we propose that these structures may have a distinct catalytic function."
[20] "The nature of the carbonaceous material deposited on VOx/Al2O3 during n-butane dehydrogenation shows a strong dependence on reaction temperature."
[21] "At high reaction temperatures highly ordered, conducting networks of polyaromatic hydrocarbons encapsulate the catalyst particle."
[22] "At low reaction temperatures the coke is much less ordered in nature, consisting of discrete molecular units with substantial areas of the catalyst surface left exposed and available for reaction."
[23] "Spectroscopic and microscopic techniques have identified two distinct categories of coke deposit over VOx/Al2O3, as described above."
[24] "At low reaction temperatures, e.g. 823 K, the coke is poorly ordered and not present as an extended, graphene-like network."
[25] "At high reaction temperatures, e.g. 973 K, much more extensive and highly ordered coke is deposited."
[26] "Relating the catalyst activity shown in Fig. 2, to the nature of the coke, clear trends are apparent."
[27] "In the low-temperature regime, where the coke consists of discrete molecular units and more amorphous carbon, the catalyst deactivates with time-on-stream with both yield and conversion decreasing."
[28] "Selectivity towards 1-butene and 1,3-butadiene remains fairly constant throughout."
[29] "This suggests that the reaction mechanism is relatively unaffected by coke deposition, and therefore the bulk of catalytic activity is at all times provided by sites present at the start of the reaction, namely VOx units on the alumina surface."
[30] "In the high-temperature regime, where the coke consists of more extended and ordered carbon networks, very different catalytic behaviour is observed."
[31] "The calculated yield increases as a function of time-on-stream indicating activation of the catalyst as coke is deposited."
[32] "Furthermore, after a short induction period, conversion reaches a constant value."
[33] "Both these factors demonstrate that the VOx/Al2O3 catalyst does not suffer from deactivation at high reaction temperatures, despite a greater quantity of coke being present as compared to low reaction temperatures."
[34] "Selectivity to the dehydrogenation products shows a more marked dependence on time-on-stream than at low temperatures."
[35] "For example, selectivity to 1-butene increases from an initial value of 32% to a steady-state value of 48%."
[36] "This steady-state value is achieved around the same time as conversion reaches steady-state at 50%."
[37] "A notable decrease in selectivity towards carbon deposition from 66% to 20% occurs over the same period."
[38] "These changes are perhaps indicative of a change in the reaction mechanism and in the nature of the catalytically active site."
[39] "That a change in the catalytically active site has occurred is confirmed by TEM data, which show that the VOx/Al2O3 catalyst particles are encapsulated in carbon after reaction at 973 K."
[40] "As such, any VOx sites will be rendered inaccessible to n-butane molecules."
[41] "Despite this, the catalyst remains highly active, even after 180 min on stream."
[42] "Indeed the yield of C4 hydrocarbons reaches its greatest value (40%) at this time."
[43] "The initial carbon deposits are most likely formed through the catalytic action of VOx units breaking down butane molecules."
[44] "However, after 180 min on stream the carbonaceous material has a thickness of multiple layers, despite the inaccessible nature of the original catalyst."
[45] "Further carbon formation therefore appears to have taken place upon the deposits."
[46] "These data therefore suggest the possibility that catalytic activity is provided by the carbonaceous deposits themselves."
[47] "TEM data presented in Section 3.4.2 revealed significant structural similarities between carbonaceous material deposited at high temperature over VOx/Al2O3 and nanostructured carbons, such as CNFs."
[48] "Notably, the deposited coke (Fig. 10) can be characterised as curved graphene-like sheets."
[49] "CNFs can be considered as graphene sheets formed into conical sections."
[50] "As a consequence of the apparent structural similarity between high-temperature coke deposits and CNFs, it was decided to study the activity of CNFs towards n-butane DH."
[51] "Table 2 compares the selectivity and conversion of VOx/ Al2O3 and the CNFs at a reaction temperature of 973 K."
[52] "After the initial induction period, during which coke is deposited on the surface of VOx/Al2O3 both catalytic systems show very similar behaviour."
[53] "After 180 min on stream VOx/Al2O3 shows a conversion of 50%, a yield of C4 DH products of 40%, a selectivity to 1-butene of 48% and to 1,3-butadiene of 32%."
[54] "The corresponding values for the CNF are 41%, 32%, 46% and 34%, respectively."
[55] "This similarity in catalytic behaviour between coked VOx/Al2O3 and the CNF supports the hypothesis that carbonaceous deposits on the surface of the supported metal-oxide catalyst are indeed active for n-butane dehydrogenation."
[56] "Neither the CNFs nor the coked VOx/Al2O3 exhibit deactivation as a function of increasing exposure to n-butane."
[57] "It is also worth noting that very slight increases in the 1-butene selectivity are observed towards the end of the reaction period at low temperatures over VOx/Al2O3."
[58] "These changes may also be due to the build-up of small amounts of active coke deposits."
[59] "While their role in the direct dehydrogenation of n-butane has not previously received attention, coked VOx/Al2O3 catalysts have previously been shown to exhibit slightly higher selectivity in the dehydrogenation of alkanes than as-prepared catalysts."
[60] "However, in that study the possible catalytic action of the coke was not considered."
[61] "Increasing the selectivity of zeolite catalysts through carbon deposition is a strategy employed industrially in xylene isomerisation."
[62] "Furthermore, the activity of CNTs in the oxidative dehydrogenation of n-butane has recently been demonstrated."
[63] "As with the present work little or no deactivation was observed in the reaction on a carbon-based catalyst over the timescale investigated."
[64] "Considering other reactant molecules, the activity of coke deposits and other carbonaceous materials in the ODH of ethylbenzene is well established with the activity of these known since at least the 1970s."
[65] "This area has been reviewed by Lisovskii and Aharoni and Cavani and Trifiro."
[66] "Similarly to the results reported herein, Lisovskii and Aharoni report that the activity of a metal-oxide catalyst reaches a steady-state after an induction period in which the entire catalyst surface is covered by carbonaceous material."
[67] "While the reaction mechanism may be different between ODH and direct DH reactions (the active sites for n-butane and ethylbenzene ODH over carbonaceous materials are believed to be carboxyl functionalities formed through oxidation of the carbon surface) there are a number of similarities between the nature of the active carbon."
[68] "In both cases, highly ordered materials represent excellent catalysts."
[69] "Additionally, it has been noted by a number of authors that the activity of coke deposits in ethylbenzene ODH correlates with their degree of paramagnetism, with a greater concentration of unpaired electrons resulting in higher activity."
[70] "Such sites could also provide the active centres in the studies reported in the present work, since paramagnetic organic radicals were observed by EPR spectroscopy."
[71] "The unpaired electrons present in such radicals may be capable of extracting hydrogen atoms from the n-butane feed, resulting in dehydrogenation."
[72] "Both the deposition of new carbonaceous material (with associated paramagnetic centres) during reaction and the recombination of the extracted H atoms could then occur in such a way as to replenish the source of unpaired electrons."
[73] "The phenomenon of carbonaceous deposits providing, or enhancing, catalytic activity is not restricted to DH or ODH reactions."
[74] "Intriguingly, carbonaceous overlayers formed on mineral surfaces during FisherTropsch-type reactions have also been proposed as the active phase for catalytic reduction reactions in protostellar nebulae."
[75] "Organic radicals present in such overlayers have been suggested as contributing to their catalytic activity."
[76] "Elsewhere, the hydrogenation of carboncarbon double bonds over supported metal catalysts has been shown to be strongly dependent upon the nature of any deposited carbonaceous material."
[77] "Such reactions have been suggested to proceed, at least in part, through the transfer of hydrogen from an adsorbed hydrocarbonaceous overlayer onto which the reactant is adsorbed."
[78] "Furthermore, carbon deposited during the reaction plays a key role in the hydrogenation of alkynes over Pd catalysts, forming a catalytically active Pd-Cx surface phase."
[79] "Carbonaceous deposits and related materials therefore show activity in a wide number of reactions."
[80] "The above-mentioned data clearly show that the dehydrogenation of n-butane can be added to the list of reactions in which carbonaceous materials can provide high activity and selectivity."

1.Various carbon-based materials, including coke deposits, carbon nanofibers, and hybrid nanocarbons, exhibit unexpected catalytic activity in alkane dehydrogenation reactions. This phenomenon is attributed to the structural and electronic properties of these materials, which can provide active sites for the dehydrogenation process. The activity of carbonaceous materials is influenced by factors such as temperature and surface chemistry. At higher temperatures, more ordered carbon deposits are formed, which can have distinct catalytic functions. The role of carbonaceous deposits in dehydrogenation reactions has been extensively researched, and it has been found that polyaromatic coke deposits do not always lead to catalyst deactivation. In fact, carbon-based catalysts can remain active over extended periods without significant deactivation. This unexpected catalytic activity of carbon-based materials has implications for the development of novel and efficient carbon-based catalysts for alkane dehydrogenation reactions.

1.Carbonaceous materials, including coke deposits, have been shown to exhibit unexpected catalytic activity in alkane dehydrogenation reactions. This activity is attributed to the action of the carbonaceous material itself, as demonstrated by the similar catalytic behavior of carbon nanofibers (CNFs) and coked VOx/Al2O3 catalysts. The nature of the deposited coke changes with temperature, with highly ordered, conducting networks of polyaromatic hydrocarbons encapsulating the catalyst particle at high temperatures. At low temperatures, the coke is poorly ordered and not present as an extended, graphene-like network. The initial carbon deposits are likely formed through the catalytic action of VOx units breaking down butane molecules, but further carbon formation appears to have taken place upon the deposits. The catalytic activity of the carbonaceous deposits is suggested by the observation that the catalyst remains highly active even after the VOx sites are rendered inaccessible to n-butane molecules.

This activity is attributed to the formation of more active dehydrogenation sites in situ as vanadia species undergo reduction through interaction with n-butane and coke builds up on the surface. The increase in butadiene production is not concomitant with a decrease in 1-butene selectivity, suggesting that the two products are formed from n-butane at different catalytic sites.

The role of carbonaceous deposits in DH and ODH reactions has been the subject of extensive research. In contrast to many other reaction systems, in DH reactions polyaromatic coke deposits are not always directly implicated in catalyst deactivation.
3.The chemical nature of carbonaceous material deposited on VOx/Al2O3 during n-butane dehydrogenation reactions at temperatures of 873 K and below has been the subject of previous investigations. The nature of the deposited coke changes above this temperature, becoming highly ordered and conducting in nature. The increase in the degree of graphitisation is further supported by TEM data. At high reaction temperatures, highly ordered, conducting networks of polyaromatic hydrocarbons encapsulate the catalyst particle.
4.In the high-temperature regime, where the coke consists of more extended and ordered carbon networks, very different catalytic behaviour is observed. The initial carbon deposits are most likely formed through the catalytic action of VOx units breaking down butane molecules.

The above-mentioned data clearly show that the dehydrogenation of n-butane can be added to the list of reactions in which carbonaceous materials can provide high activity and selectivity.

1.碳质材料，包括焦炭沉积物，首次被证明在烷烃脱氢反应中表现出意外的催化活性。这种活性归因于在原位形成更活跃的脱氢位点，因为钒物种通过与n-丁烷的相互作用还原，焦炭在表面上积累。丁二烯的增加产量并不伴随1-丁烯选择性的降低，这表明这两种产物是从n-丁烷在不同的催化位点形成的。
2.基于碳的催化剂代表了一类重要的新型潜在DH和ODH反应催化剂。碳质沉积物在DH和ODH反应中的作用一直是广泛研究的主题。与其他许多反应系统不同，在DH反应中，多芳烃焦炭沉积物并不总是直接导致催化剂失活。
3.在873 K及以下温度下，VOx/Al2O3上沉积的碳质材料的化学性质一直是以前研究的主题。沉积焦炭的性质在超过这个温度时发生变化，成为高度有序和导电性质。TEM数据进一步支持了石墨化程度的增加。在高温下，高度有序、导电的多芳烃网络包裹催化剂颗粒。
4.在高温条件下，焦炭由更扩展和有序的碳网络组成，观察到非常不同的催化行为。最初的碳沉积物很可能通过VOx单元分解丁烷分子的催化作用形成。因此，似乎在沉积物上发生了进一步的碳形成。这些数据表明，催化活性可能由碳质沉积物本身提供。
5.由于高温焦炭沉积物与CNFs之间明显的结构相似性，决定研究CNFs对n-丁烷DH的活性。在最初的诱导期后，当焦炭沉积在VOx/Al2O3表面时，两个催化系统表现出非常相似的行为。无论是CNFs还是焦化的VOx/Al2O3，随着n-丁烷暴露的增加，都不会出现失活。
6.虽然焦化VOx/Al2O3催化剂在直接脱氢n-丁烷中的作用以前没有受到关注，但以前已经证明，焦化VOx/Al2O3催化剂在烷烃脱氢中的选择性略高于制备催化剂。通过碳沉积提高沸石催化剂的选择性是工业上在二甲苯异构化中采用的策略。最近已经证明了CNTs在n-丁烷氧化脱氢中的活性。自20世纪70年代以来，焦炭沉积物和其他碳质材料在乙苯ODH中的活性已经被认识。在两种情况下，高度有序的材料都是优秀的催化剂。
7.碳质沉积物提供或增强催化活性的现象不仅限于DH或ODH反应。因此，碳质沉积物和相关材料在广泛的反应中表现出活性。上述数据清楚地表明，n-丁烷的脱氢可以添加到碳质材料可以提供高活性和选择性的反应列表中。

[1] "Carbon-based catalysts represent an important new class of potential catalysts for DH and ODH reactions."
[2] "In this work, we show for the first time that carbonaceous material, coke, deposited during reaction over VOx/Al2O3 can act as an active catalyst in the non-oxidative dehydrogenation of n-butane."
[3] "This conclusion is confirmed through a comparison of the activity of coked VOx/Al2O3 and carbon nanofibres."
[4] "That these types of vanadate species are present on alumina-supported vanadia catalysts is well-established."

[6] "The chemical nature of carbonaceous material deposited on VOx/Al2O3 during n-butane dehydrogenation reactions at temperatures of 873 K and below has been the subject of previous investigations."
[7] "The nature of the deposited coke changes above this temperature."
[8] "The deposited carbon can therefore be considered conducting in nature and as such highly ordered, in agreement with THz-TDS studies."
[9] "The increase in absorption with increasing reaction temperature observed in the present work for carbon deposits on VOx/Al2O3 is therefore a reflection of the increasing graphitic order of the coke, and the larger network size of such deposits."
[10] "At high reaction temperatures, e.g. 973 K, much more extensive and highly ordered coke is deposited."
[11] "That a change in the catalytically active site has occurred is confirmed by TEM data, which show that the VOx/Al2O3 catalyst particles are encapsulated in carbon after reaction at 973 K."
[12] "As such, any VOx sites will be rendered inaccessible to n-butane molecules."
[13] "Despite this, the catalyst remains highly active, even after 180 min on stream."
[14] "Indeed the yield of C4 hydrocarbons reaches its greatest value (40%) at this time."
[15] "The initial carbon deposits are most likely formed through the catalytic action of VOx units breaking down butane molecules."
[16] "However, after 180 min on stream the carbonaceous material has a thickness of multiple layers, despite the inaccessible nature of the original catalyst."
[17] "Further carbon formation therefore appears to have taken place upon the deposits."
[18] "These data therefore suggest the possibility that catalytic activity is provided by the carbonaceous deposits themselves."
[19] "As a consequence of the apparent structural similarity between high-temperature coke deposits and CNFs, it was decided to study the activity of CNFs towards n-butane DH."
[20] "After the initial induction period, during which coke is deposited on the surface of VOx/Al2O3 both catalytic systems show very similar behaviour."
[21] "After 180 min on stream VOx/Al2O3 shows a conversion of 50%, a yield of C4 DH products of 40%, a selectivity to 1-butene of 48% and to 1,3-butadiene of 32%."
[22] "The corresponding values for the CNF are 41%, 32%, 46% and 34%, respectively."
[23] "This similarity in catalytic behaviour between coked VOx/Al2O3 and the CNF supports the hypothesis that carbonaceous deposits on the surface of the supported metal-oxide catalyst are indeed active for n-butane dehydrogenation."
[24] "Neither the CNFs nor the coked VOx/Al2O3 exhibit deactivation as a function of increasing exposure to n-butane."
[25] "The activity of coke deposits and other carbonaceous materials in the ODH of ethylbenzene is well established with the activity of these known since at least the 1970s."
[26] "In both cases, highly ordered materials represent excellent catalysts."
[27] "Additionally, it has been noted by a number of authors that the activity of coke deposits in ethylbenzene ODH correlates with their degree of paramagnetism, with a greater concentration of unpaired electrons resulting in higher activity."
[28] "Such sites could also provide the active centres in the studies reported in the present work, since paramagnetic organic radicals were observed by EPR spectroscopy."
[29] "The unpaired electrons present in such radicals may be capable of extracting hydrogen atoms from the n-butane feed, resulting in dehydrogenation."
[30] "Both the deposition of new carbonaceous material (with associated paramagnetic centres) during reaction and the recombination of the extracted H atoms could then occur in such a way as to replenish the source of unpaired electrons."
[31] "Carbonaceous deposits and related materials therefore show activity in a wide number of reactions."
[32] "The above-mentioned data clearly show that the dehydrogenation of n-butane can be added to the list of reactions in which carbonaceous materials can provide high activity and selectivity."

1.Carbon-based catalysts, including coke deposits and carbon nanofibers, have been shown to exhibit unexpected catalytic activity in alkane dehydrogenation reactions. This phenomenon was first observed in the non-oxidative dehydrogenation of n-butane over VOx/Al2O3 catalysts, where carbonaceous material deposited during the reaction acted as an active catalyst. The activity of coked VOx/Al2O3 was confirmed through a comparison with carbon nanofibres, which showed similar catalytic behavior. The presence of vanadate species on alumina-supported vanadia catalysts is well-established, and the nature of the deposited coke changes at higher reaction temperatures, becoming more graphitic and highly ordered. At high temperatures, such as 973 K, extensive and highly ordered coke is deposited, encapsulating the catalyst particles and rendering VOx sites inaccessible to n-butane molecules. Despite this, the catalyst remains highly active, with the yield of C4 hydrocarbons reaching its greatest value after 180 minutes on stream. The initial carbon deposits are likely formed through the catalytic action of VOx units breaking down butane molecules, but further carbon formation appears to occur upon the deposits, suggesting that catalytic activity is provided by the carbonaceous deposits themselves. The structural similarity between high-temperature coke deposits and carbon nanofibers supports the hypothesis that carbonaceous deposits on the surface of supported metal-oxide catalysts are active for n-butane dehydrogenation. Neither carbon nanofibers nor coked VOx/Al2O3 exhibit deactivation as a function of increasing exposure to n-butane. The activity of coke deposits and other carbonaceous materials in the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene is well-established, with highly ordered materials representing excellent catalysts. The activity of coke deposits in ethylbenzene oxidative dehydrogenation correlates with their degree of paramagnetism, with a greater concentration of unpaired electrons resulting in higher activity. Paramagnetic organic radicals observed by EPR spectroscopy in the present work could also provide active centers for n-butane dehydrogenation. The unpaired electrons present in such radicals may be capable of extracting hydrogen atoms from the n-butane feed, resulting in dehydrogenation. The deposition of new carbonaceous material during the reaction and the recombination of extracted hydrogen atoms could replenish the source of unpaired electrons. Carbonaceous deposits and related materials show activity in a wide range of reactions, and the dehydrogenation of n-butane can be added to the list of reactions in which carbonaceous materials can provide high activity and selectivity.

1.基于碳的催化剂，包括焦炭沉积物和碳纳米纤维，在烷烃脱氢反应中表现出意外的催化活性。这种现象首先在VOx/Al2O3催化剂上观察到，在非氧化脱氢反应中，反应过程中沉积的碳质材料充当了活性催化剂。通过与碳纳米纤维的比较，验证了coked VOx/Al2O3的活性。在氧化铝支撑的钒氧化物催化剂上存在钒酸盐物种是众所周知的，而沉积的焦炭的性质在873 K及以下的反应温度下是先前研究的主题。在较高的反应温度下，沉积的焦炭的性质发生变化，成为更石墨化和高度有序的。在较高的温度下，例如973 K，会沉积出广泛且高度有序的焦炭，将催化剂颗粒封装起来，使VOx位点对n-丁烷分子不可接近。尽管如此，催化剂在180分钟后仍保持高度活性，C4烃的产量达到最大值。最初的碳沉积物很可能通过VOx单元分解丁烷分子的催化作用形成，但似乎在沉积物上发生了进一步的碳形成，表明催化活性是由碳质沉积物本身提供的。高温焦炭沉积物与碳纳米纤维之间的结构相似性支持了碳质沉积物在支撑金属氧化物催化剂表面是n-丁烷脱氢活性的假设。无论是碳纳米纤维还是coked VOx/Al2O3，在增加n-丁烷暴露的情况下都不会出现失活。在乙苯氧化脱氢中，焦炭沉积物和其他碳质材料的活性是众所周知的，高度有序的材料代表了优秀的催化剂。焦炭沉积物在乙苯氧化脱氢中的活性与其顺磁性程度相关，具有较高浓度的未配对电子导致更高的活性。在本研究中通过EPR光谱观察到的顺磁性有机自由基也可能为n-丁烷脱氢提供活性中心。这些自由基中存在的未配对电子可能能够从n-丁烷原料中提取氢原子，导致脱氢。在反应过程中沉积新的碳质材料（具有相关的顺磁性中心）和提取的氢原子的重组可以以一种方式发生，以补充未配对电子的来源。碳质沉积物和相关材料在广泛的反应中表现出活性，n-丁烷的脱氢可以添加到碳质材料可以提供高活性和选择性的反应列表中。
