[1] "Carbon-based catalysts represent an important new class of potential catalysts for DH and ODH reactions."
[2] "In this work, we show for the first time that carbonaceous material, coke, deposited during reaction over VOx/Al2O3 can act as an active catalyst in the non-oxidative dehydrogenation of n-butane."
[3] "This conclusion is confirmed through a comparison of the activity of coked VOx/Al2O3 and carbon nanofibres."
[4] "That these types of vanadate species are present on alumina-supported vanadia catalysts is well-established."
[5] "The nature of the carbonaceous material deposited on VOx/Al2O3 during n-butane dehydrogenation reactions at temperatures of 873 K and below has been the subject of previous investigations."
[6] "The chemical nature of carbonaceous material deposited on VOx/Al2O3 during n-butane dehydrogenation reactions at temperatures of 873 K and below has been the subject of previous investigations."
[7] "The nature of the deposited coke changes above this temperature."
[8] "The deposited carbon can therefore be considered conducting in nature and as such highly ordered, in agreement with THz-TDS studies."
[9] "The increase in absorption with increasing reaction temperature observed in the present work for carbon deposits on VOx/Al2O3 is therefore a reflection of the increasing graphitic order of the coke, and the larger network size of such deposits."
[10] "At high reaction temperatures, e.g. 973 K, much more extensive and highly ordered coke is deposited."
[11] "That a change in the catalytically active site has occurred is confirmed by TEM data, which show that the VOx/Al2O3 catalyst particles are encapsulated in carbon after reaction at 973 K."
[12] "As such, any VOx sites will be rendered inaccessible to n-butane molecules."
[13] "Despite this, the catalyst remains highly active, even after 180 min on stream."
[14] "Indeed the yield of C4 hydrocarbons reaches its greatest value (40%) at this time."
[15] "The initial carbon deposits are most likely formed through the catalytic action of VOx units breaking down butane molecules."
[16] "However, after 180 min on stream the carbonaceous material has a thickness of multiple layers, despite the inaccessible nature of the original catalyst."
[17] "Further carbon formation therefore appears to have taken place upon the deposits."
[18] "These data therefore suggest the possibility that catalytic activity is provided by the carbonaceous deposits themselves."
[19] "As a consequence of the apparent structural similarity between high-temperature coke deposits and CNFs, it was decided to study the activity of CNFs towards n-butane DH."
[20] "After the initial induction period, during which coke is deposited on the surface of VOx/Al2O3 both catalytic systems show very similar behaviour."
[21] "After 180 min on stream VOx/Al2O3 shows a conversion of 50%, a yield of C4 DH products of 40%, a selectivity to 1-butene of 48% and to 1,3-butadiene of 32%."
[22] "The corresponding values for the CNF are 41%, 32%, 46% and 34%, respectively."
[23] "This similarity in catalytic behaviour between coked VOx/Al2O3 and the CNF supports the hypothesis that carbonaceous deposits on the surface of the supported metal-oxide catalyst are indeed active for n-butane dehydrogenation."
[24] "Neither the CNFs nor the coked VOx/Al2O3 exhibit deactivation as a function of increasing exposure to n-butane."
[25] "The activity of coke deposits and other carbonaceous materials in the ODH of ethylbenzene is well established with the activity of these known since at least the 1970s."
[26] "In both cases, highly ordered materials represent excellent catalysts."
[27] "Additionally, it has been noted by a number of authors that the activity of coke deposits in ethylbenzene ODH correlates with their degree of paramagnetism, with a greater concentration of unpaired electrons resulting in higher activity."
[28] "Such sites could also provide the active centres in the studies reported in the present work, since paramagnetic organic radicals were observed by EPR spectroscopy."
[29] "The unpaired electrons present in such radicals may be capable of extracting hydrogen atoms from the n-butane feed, resulting in dehydrogenation."
[30] "Both the deposition of new carbonaceous material (with associated paramagnetic centres) during reaction and the recombination of the extracted H atoms could then occur in such a way as to replenish the source of unpaired electrons."
[31] "Carbonaceous deposits and related materials therefore show activity in a wide number of reactions."
[32] "The above-mentioned data clearly show that the dehydrogenation of n-butane can be added to the list of reactions in which carbonaceous materials can provide high activity and selectivity."

1.Carbon-based catalysts, including coke deposits and carbon nanofibers, have been shown to exhibit unexpected catalytic activity in alkane dehydrogenation reactions. This phenomenon was first observed in the non-oxidative dehydrogenation of n-butane over VOx/Al2O3 catalysts, where carbonaceous material deposited during the reaction acted as an active catalyst. The activity of coked VOx/Al2O3 was confirmed through a comparison with carbon nanofibres, which showed similar catalytic behavior. The presence of vanadate species on alumina-supported vanadia catalysts is well-established, and the nature of the deposited coke changes at higher reaction temperatures, becoming more graphitic and highly ordered. At high temperatures, such as 973 K, extensive and highly ordered coke is deposited, encapsulating the catalyst particles and rendering VOx sites inaccessible to n-butane molecules. Despite this, the catalyst remains highly active, with the yield of C4 hydrocarbons reaching its greatest value after 180 minutes on stream. The initial carbon deposits are likely formed through the catalytic action of VOx units breaking down butane molecules, but further carbon formation appears to occur upon the deposits, suggesting that catalytic activity is provided by the carbonaceous deposits themselves. The structural similarity between high-temperature coke deposits and carbon nanofibers supports the hypothesis that carbonaceous deposits on the surface of supported metal-oxide catalysts are active for n-butane dehydrogenation. Neither carbon nanofibers nor coked VOx/Al2O3 exhibit deactivation as a function of increasing exposure to n-butane. The activity of coke deposits and other carbonaceous materials in the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene is well-established, with highly ordered materials representing excellent catalysts. The activity of coke deposits in ethylbenzene oxidative dehydrogenation correlates with their degree of paramagnetism, with a greater concentration of unpaired electrons resulting in higher activity. Paramagnetic organic radicals observed by EPR spectroscopy in the present work could also provide active centers for n-butane dehydrogenation. The unpaired electrons present in such radicals may be capable of extracting hydrogen atoms from the n-butane feed, resulting in dehydrogenation. The deposition of new carbonaceous material during the reaction and the recombination of extracted hydrogen atoms could replenish the source of unpaired electrons. Carbonaceous deposits and related materials show activity in a wide range of reactions, and the dehydrogenation of n-butane can be added to the list of reactions in which carbonaceous materials can provide high activity and selectivity.

1.基于碳的催化剂，包括焦炭沉积物和碳纳米纤维，在烷烃脱氢反应中表现出意外的催化活性。这种现象首先在VOx/Al2O3催化剂上观察到，在非氧化脱氢反应中，反应过程中沉积的碳质材料充当了活性催化剂。通过与碳纳米纤维的比较，验证了coked VOx/Al2O3的活性。在氧化铝支撑的钒氧化物催化剂上存在钒酸盐物种是众所周知的，而沉积的焦炭的性质在873 K及以下的反应温度下是先前研究的主题。在较高的反应温度下，沉积的焦炭的性质发生变化，成为更石墨化和高度有序的。在较高的温度下，例如973 K，会沉积出广泛且高度有序的焦炭，将催化剂颗粒封装起来，使VOx位点对n-丁烷分子不可接近。尽管如此，催化剂在180分钟后仍保持高度活性，C4烃的产量达到最大值。最初的碳沉积物很可能通过VOx单元分解丁烷分子的催化作用形成，但似乎在沉积物上发生了进一步的碳形成，表明催化活性是由碳质沉积物本身提供的。高温焦炭沉积物与碳纳米纤维之间的结构相似性支持了碳质沉积物在支撑金属氧化物催化剂表面是n-丁烷脱氢活性的假设。无论是碳纳米纤维还是coked VOx/Al2O3，在增加n-丁烷暴露的情况下都不会出现失活。在乙苯氧化脱氢中，焦炭沉积物和其他碳质材料的活性是众所周知的，高度有序的材料代表了优秀的催化剂。焦炭沉积物在乙苯氧化脱氢中的活性与其顺磁性程度相关，具有较高浓度的未配对电子导致更高的活性。在本研究中通过EPR光谱观察到的顺磁性有机自由基也可能为n-丁烷脱氢提供活性中心。这些自由基中存在的未配对电子可能能够从n-丁烷原料中提取氢原子，导致脱氢。在反应过程中沉积新的碳质材料（具有相关的顺磁性中心）和提取的氢原子的重组可以以一种方式发生，以补充未配对电子的来源。碳质沉积物和相关材料在广泛的反应中表现出活性，n-丁烷的脱氢可以添加到碳质材料可以提供高活性和选择性的反应列表中。
