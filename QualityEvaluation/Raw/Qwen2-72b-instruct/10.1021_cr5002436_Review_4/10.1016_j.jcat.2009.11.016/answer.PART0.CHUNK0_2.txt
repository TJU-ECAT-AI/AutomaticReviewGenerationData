1.Carbonaceous materials, including coke deposits, have been shown to exhibit unexpected catalytic activity in alkane dehydrogenation reactions. This activity is attributed to the action of the carbonaceous material itself, as demonstrated by the similar catalytic behavior of carbon nanofibers (CNFs) and coked VOx/Al2O3 catalysts. The nature of the deposited coke changes with temperature, with highly ordered, conducting networks of polyaromatic hydrocarbons encapsulating the catalyst particle at high temperatures. At low temperatures, the coke is poorly ordered and not present as an extended, graphene-like network. The initial carbon deposits are likely formed through the catalytic action of VOx units breaking down butane molecules, but further carbon formation appears to have taken place upon the deposits. The catalytic activity of the carbonaceous deposits is suggested by the observation that the catalyst remains highly active even after the VOx sites are rendered inaccessible to n-butane molecules. The activity of coke deposits and other carbonaceous materials in oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) reactions is well established, with highly ordered materials representing excellent catalysts. The phenomenon of carbonaceous deposits providing or enhancing catalytic activity is not restricted to DH or ODH reactions, as demonstrated by the activity of carbonaceous deposits in a wide number of reactions. The implications of this phenomenon for the development of novel and efficient carbon-based catalysts are significant, as carbon-based catalysts represent an important new class of potential catalysts for DH and ODH reactions.

1.碳基材料，包括焦炭沉积物，在烷烃脱氢反应中表现出意外的催化活性。这种活性归因于碳基材料本身的作用，如通过碳纳米纤维（CNFs）和焦化VOx/Al2O3催化剂的类似催化行为所证明的。沉积焦炭的性质随温度变化，在高温下，高度有序的、导电的多芳烃网络包裹催化剂颗粒。在低温下，焦炭无序，不以扩展的石墨状网络形式存在。初始碳沉积物可能通过VOx单元分解丁烷分子的催化作用形成，但似乎在沉积物上发生了进一步的碳形成。即使VOx位点对n-丁烷分子变得不可接近，催化剂仍保持高度活性，这表明碳沉积物的催化活性。焦炭沉积物和其他碳基材料在氧化脱氢（ODH）反应中的活性是众所周知的，高度有序的材料代表了优秀的催化剂。碳沉积物提供或增强催化活性的现象不仅限于DH或ODH反应，如碳沉积物在大量反应中的活性所示。这种现象对新型和高效碳基催化剂的开发具有重要意义，因为碳基催化剂代表了一类重要的潜在DH和ODH反应催化剂。
