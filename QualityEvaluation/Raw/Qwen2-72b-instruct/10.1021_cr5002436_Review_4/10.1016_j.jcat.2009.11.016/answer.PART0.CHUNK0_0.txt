[1] "In this work, we show for the first time that carbonaceous material, coke, deposited during reaction over VOx/Al2O3 can act as an active catalyst in the non-oxidative dehydrogenation of n-butane."

[4] "The nature of the carbonaceous material deposited on VOx/Al2O3 during n-butane dehydrogenation reactions at temperatures of 873 K and below has been the subject of previous investigations."
[5] "The chemical nature of carbonaceous material deposited on VOx/Al2O3 during n-butane dehydrogenation reactions at temperatures of 873 K and below has been the subject of previous investigations."
[6] "The quantity of hydrocarbonaceous material increases as a function of reaction temperature, confirming the results of the XPS study."
[7] "The deposited carbon can therefore be considered conducting in nature and as such highly ordered, in agreement with THz-TDS studies."
[8] "The nature of the carbonaceous material deposited on VOx/Al2O3 during n-butane dehydrogenation shows a strong dependence on reaction temperature."
[9] "At high reaction temperatures, e.g. 973 K, much more extensive and highly ordered coke is deposited."
[10] "The initial carbon deposits are most likely formed through the catalytic action of VOx units breaking down butane molecules."
[11] "As such, any VOx sites will be rendered inaccessible to n-butane molecules."
[12] "Despite this, the catalyst remains highly active, even after 180 min on stream."
[13] "Indeed the yield of C4 hydrocarbons reaches its greatest value (40%) at this time."
[14] "The deposited coke (Fig. 10) can be characterised as curved graphene-like sheets."
[15] "As a consequence of the apparent structural similarity between high-temperature coke deposits and CNFs, it was decided to study the activity of CNFs towards n-butane DH."
[16] "After the initial induction period, during which coke is deposited on the surface of VOx/Al2O3 both catalytic systems show very similar behaviour."
[17] "Neither the CNFs nor the coked VOx/Al2O3 exhibit deactivation as a function of increasing exposure to n-butane."
[18] "The above-mentioned data clearly show that the dehydrogenation of n-butane can be added to the list of reactions in which carbonaceous materials can provide high activity and selectivity."

1.Carbonaceous materials, including coke deposits and carbon nanofibres, exhibit unexpected catalytic activity in alkane dehydrogenation reactions. This phenomenon is confirmed through a comparison of the activity of coked VOx/Al2O3 and carbon nanofibres. The nature of the carbonaceous material deposited on VOx/Al2O3 during n-butane dehydrogenation shows a strong dependence on reaction temperature. At high reaction temperatures, much more extensive and highly ordered coke is deposited. The deposited carbon can be considered conducting in nature and as such highly ordered. The initial carbon deposits are most likely formed through the catalytic action of VOx units breaking down butane molecules. Despite the VOx sites being rendered inaccessible to n-butane molecules, the catalyst remains highly active, even after 180 min on stream. The yield of C4 hydrocarbons reaches its greatest value at this time. The deposited coke can be characterised as curved graphene-like sheets. The activity of CNFs towards n-butane DH is similar to that of coked VOx/Al2O3. Neither the CNFs nor the coked VOx/Al2O3 exhibit deactivation as a function of increasing exposure to n-butane. The dehydrogenation of n-butane can be added to the list of reactions in which carbonaceous materials can provide high activity and selectivity.

1.碳基材料，包括焦炭沉积物和碳纳米纤维，在烷烃脱氢反应中表现出意外的催化活性。这一现象通过比较coked VOx/Al2O3和碳纳米纤维的活性得到证实。在n-丁烷脱氢过程中，沉积在VOx/Al2O3上的碳基材料的性质强烈依赖于反应温度。在高温下，沉积了更多且高度有序的焦炭。沉积的碳可以被认为是导电性质的，因此是高度有序的。最初的碳沉积物很可能通过VOx单元分解丁烷分子的催化作用形成。尽管VOx位点对n-丁烷分子变得不可接近，但催化剂即使在180分钟后仍保持高度活性。C4烃的产量在这一点上达到最大值。沉积的焦炭可以被描述为弯曲的石墨烯状片。CNFs对n-丁烷DH的活性与coked VOx/Al2O3相似。无论是CNFs还是coked VOx/Al2O3，随着n-丁烷暴露量的增加，都不会出现失活。n-丁烷的脱氢可以添加到碳基材料可以提供高活性和选择性的反应列表中。
