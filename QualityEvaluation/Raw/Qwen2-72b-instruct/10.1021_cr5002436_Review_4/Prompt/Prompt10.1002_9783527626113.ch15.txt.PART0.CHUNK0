Introduction
The dehydrogenation of light alkanes over chromia systems has been known as a catalytic process since the early 1930s [1] . A comprehensive review of the pre - 1954 literature can be found in Emmett
s book on catalysis [2] . The dehy- drogenation of light alkanes is highly endothermic (for example, propane to propene, C 3

K. Commercial processes based on chromia cata-
lysts have been operational for over 60 years. During the Second World War chromia/alumina catalysts were used for the dehydrogenation of butane to give butenes, which were then dimerized and hydrogenated to produce high - octane aviation fuel. As was so often the case in the early years of the twentieth century, the dehydrogenation process using a chromia/alumina catalyst was fi rst developed and commercialized in Germany at Leuna. There was also inde- pendent development by UOP (then Universal Oil Products ) in the United States, together with
ICI (
Imperial Chemical Industries ) in the UK. The fi rst
UOP
- designed plant came on stream in Billingham, in the North - East of England, in 1940 [3] . Houdry made a signifi cant process development by using a less than atmospheric pressure system, a highly innovative move in an indus- try where high pressure is the norm. In this way it was possible to achieve a higher per - pass conversion and, indeed, typical operating conditions for current commercial reactors are 0.3
0.5
atm and 823

[4] . A very good review con- cerning the process chemistry is that of Bhasin [5] . In this chapter we will examine both chromia and vanadia, which although not used commercially,has been thoroughly examined for these reactions. The oxide surfaces have been subject to analysis by a wide range of techniques pre - , during and post - reaction.

Commercial LPG Dehydrogenation Process
The deactivation of chromia catalysts during the dehydrogenation of light alkanes,due to the deposition of carbonaceous species onto the catalyst surface, is well known. Regeneration of the catalyst is periodic and by oxidation. The designs of commercial reactors for this process take different approaches both to managing the deactivation and to the regeneration. Of specifi c interest in the present context is the following system that uses a chromium oxide catalyst.

Lummus/Houdry CATOFIN Process [6]
The CATOFIN process technology is currently owned by S
d - Chemie and is offered for license by ABB Lummus. The CATOFIN process converts propane to propene over a fi xed - bed chromia
alumina catalyst [7] . The process takes place in a series of fi xed - bed reactors that operate on a cyclic basis. In one complete cycle,hydrocarbon is dehydrogenated and the reactor is purged with steam then sub- jected to air to reheat the catalyst and burn off coke, which is deposited during the reaction cycle. These steps are followed by an evacuation and reduction and then another cycle is begun. The cycle time is typically 15
25 minutes. In the classic process, the regenerating (heating) gas is fed in the same direction as the process gas, which leads initially to a higher temperature at the feed than the exit. With time on stream, a temperature front will move through the bed as the front of the bed is cooled by the endothermic reaction. Operation is generally at 823
873 K and
0.3
atm. CATOFIN is also used commercially for isobutane to isobutene. The reaction conditions are usually 923
K and 0.5 atm. The overall operation is similar to that described for propane to propene, with conversion in region of
50% per pass and selectivity for isobutane to isobutene of greater than 90%; the selectivity of propane to propene is > 86% [8] . A catalyst formulation taken from a recent patent [9] has the following make - up,
20% Cr,
1% Zr as ZrO 2 ,
0.75% Mg as
MgO, supported on alumina with an alkali metal oxide promoter such as Na 2 O at
0.75%.

Chromia
A wide range of techniques has been used on both fresh and used catalysts to characterize the nature of the oxide surface, for example
X

(
XRD
) [10

, UV
- Visible diffuse refl ectance spectroscopy (
UV

X

XPS
) [11,12, 18] ,electron paramagnetic resonance (
EPR
) [12, 19] , infrared spectroscopy [10,20] and temperature programmed reduction (
TPR
) [16, 21] . Given the number of
15.4 Chromia  597
publications we will not review them all but will summarize the main conclusions from this body of work.
Chromium can exist in the (II), (III), (V) and (VI) oxidation states; however, in an as - prepared catalyst the (III) and (VI) oxidation states are the predominant species. At low loadings the +6 state is favored on alumina. On zirconia however Cr(V) was found to be
50% of the chromium present [22] . As loading increases the surface species change from monochromate to polychromate to α - Cr 2
O
3 . Typi- cally catalysts are prepared by impregnation of alumina, although zirconia is also used, from a variety of chromium - containing solutions such as ammonium dichromate, chromic acid and chromium nitrate. After calcination in air at 823
K,
UV
- visible analysis of a 6% w/w chrome oxide/ γ - alumina revealed the presence of Cr(III) with bands at 280
nm ( 4

. XRD
analysis revealed that the only detectable chromium species was Cr 2
O
3 . Usually no XRD detectable phase is present until the loading is greater than monolayer coverage, typically
7 wt% for alumina supported catalysts. Raman spectroscopic analysis [13] , however, reveals the complexity of the chromia species on the surface (Figure
15.1
). Analysis of the spectra gave approximate values for the various components as 14% monomer/dimer, 50% polymer, 7% crystalline, with the balance found in mixed bands.
To obtain the active catalyst the chromia can be reduced with hydrogen, alkane or carbon monoxide [12, 24, 25] ; as reported above the commercial process uses a hydrogen reduction. TPR analyses reveal that reduction starts at 543
553
K (

K (

K (
T
fi n ) [9, 26] . Burwell and coworkers [27] studied the exchange reaction between alkanes and deuterium over chromia and found that no activity was present if the catalyst had not been activated above 573
K, and maximum activity was observed with samples that had been activated at 743
K, confi rming the need for reduction to activate chromia samples.
The active species was initially suggested to be Cr(II) by Sachtler and coworkers
[28] . In more recent studies, Cr(III) as the active species has gained prominence
[12, 24, 25, 29] . However, it has not been possible to defi nitively state that Cr(III) is the active site. Other groups have suggested a Cr(II)/Cr(III) pair [18] . In general spectroscopic analyses favor Cr(III), but quantifi cation of the reduction and re -
adsorption/absorption of oxygen suggests that hydrogen reduction reduces Cr 2
O
3 to CrO [26] .
The presence of residual hydrogen retained by a chromia catalyst after reduction was shown by pulsing aliquots of deutero - propane (C 3
D
8 or [ 2

H
8 ) over a hydrogen - reduced catalyst and aliquots of propane over a deuterium - reduced ( 2
H
2 or D 2 ) catalyst. In both cases isotope exchange occurred such that deuterium incorporation was observed in the propane for a deuterium - reduced catalyst and hydrogen incorporation was observed in the deutero - propane for a hydrogen -
reduced catalyst [30] .
The rate determining step for propane dehydrogenation over chromia was found to be the loss of the second hydrogen:

At 823 K and 16,800
GHSV (
gas hourly space velocity ) a chromia/alumina cata- lyst gives the following product distribution for propane dehydrogenation; 1% methane, 1% ethane, 1% ethene, 39% propene and 54% unreacted propane (S.D.
Jackson, unpublished results), showing nearly equilibrium conversion and high selectivity. For butane dehydrogenation at 873
K and 14,500 GHSV the product distribution is 70% unreacted butane, 5% trans - 2 - butene, 6% 1 - butene, 4% cis - 2 - butene, 1.5% butadiene and
1% C

C
3 . For butane dehydrogenation, 1 - butene is the primary product [31] .
Both systems deposit carbon, and when run for extended cycles under propane dehydrogenation polynuclear aromatics form. A Raman spectrum from a 1% chromia/alumina coked catalyst is shown in Figure
15.2
. The main peak appears at 1592 cm
1 with a shoulder at 1550
cm
1 , also broad features are observable at 1170 cm
1 and 1380 cm
1 . With the exception of the shoulder at 1550
cm
1 the Raman spectrum is characteristic of polynuclear, aromatic carbon. Espinat and coworkers [32] characterized a wide variety of carbon compounds including coke on a series of mono - and bi - metallic catalysts and assigned the Raman bands found from 1300 to 1700 cm
1 . The D (1350 cm
1 ) and G (1600
cm
1 ) bands can be used to identify the type of coke deposited on the catalyst. For the spectrum shown in Figure
15.2
, the D band is half the intensity of the G band. This ratio indicates pre - graphitic coke, which is composed of graphite with crystal defects
15.4 Chromia  599
or pre - graphitic paracrystals [32] The shoulder at 1550
cm
1 is characteristic of conjugated olefi ns or polyenes.
Confi rmation of this interpretation of the Raman spectrum came from analysis of yellow oil produced during extended use of a catalyst. The analysis revealed the presence of pyrene (C 16
H
10 ), fl uoranthene (C 16
H
10 ), benzanthracene (C 18
H
12 ) and perylene (C 20
H
12 ) among other compounds. The alumina support principally pro- duced perylene in the absence of chromia but with chromia a wider range of polynuclear aromatics were detected [26] .
Studies using isotopically labeled propane [30] have shown that the route to the coke deposits during propane dehydrogenation goes through a C 1 species,probably CH(a). However, before these species convert to coke there is a period when they are labile and can be hydrogenated off the surface as methane [26, 30] .
This was shown using isotopically labeled propane [26] and by using a mixed continuous/pulse reaction system where a chromia/alumina catalyst was reduced and subjected to a continuous fl ow of propane for 10
min at 873 K followed by two pulses of propane in helium [20] . With both pulses the H
: C ratio was
3.3 much
higher than the inlet 2.7; also the mass balance was > 100%. However the propene
:propane ratio was what would have been expected from a continuous fl ow experi- ment after 10
min. Clearly carbonaceous material retained by the catalyst was being desorbed into the pulse as methane. Therefore under continuous fl ow condi- tions there is a reservoir of C 1 fragments on the surface of the catalyst that is con- tinually in fl ux between removal as methane and consolidation on the surface to generate higher molecular weight species. A study by Krause and coworkers [33] showed that if the chromia is not pre - reduced the reduction of chromates by propane may proceed through the formation of isopropoxide species, which react

600  15 Alkane Dehydrogenation over Vanadium and Chromium Oxides further fi rst to adsorbed acetone and then to formates and acetates. They also found that dehydrogenation of propane resulted in sequential formation of ali- phatic, unsaturated/aromatic and graphite - like hydrocarbon deposits, which deac- tivated the catalyst.
The situation with butane is similar but with signifi cant differences. The forma- tion of coke on the surface is very similar to that found with propane; however, Edussuriya and coworkers (unpublished results) found that although the majority of the catalyst deactivation was due to polynuclear aromatics or other forms of coke strongly adsorbed reaction intermediates were also detected. These species can be desorbed at room temperature by treating with a low concentration O 2 in Ar mix. Figure
15.3 shows the desorption of butane. The catalyst had been catalyz-
ing the dehydrogenation reaction for 2
h at 873 K when the gas stream was switched from butane to argon. Online mass spectrometry indicated that all hydrocarbon components were rapidly swept out of the reactor at 873
K and no other gases apart from the argon carrier were detected during the cool - down period. However, when
2% O
2 /Ar was passed over the sample at room temperature, butane, butenes and butadiene were evolved. This desorption process can be viewed as an oxidative displacement, resulting in recombination of reaction intermediates (hydrogen and alkyl, alkenyl and alkadienyl) from the surface of reduced CrO
x species. Removal of these species did not regenerate the catalyst. The polynuclear aromatics were only removed when the catalyst was subjected to a full regeneration involving high - temperature oxidation. Only after this treatment did the catalyst regain its activity.

Vanadia
Although vanadia catalysts have not been used commercially there is a signifi cant literature concerning the dehydrogenation reaction over supported vanadia systems. The structure of supported vanadia catalysts under redox reaction condi- tions is directly related to the catalytic performance. Vanadia catalysts are usually reduced to some extent during redox reactions, and the reduced vanadia species have been proposed as the active sites [20, 34, 35] . Therefore, information on the valence state and molecular structure of the reduced vanadia catalysts is of great interest. A number of techniques have been applied to investigate the reduction of supported vanadia catalysts, such as TPR [36
38]
, X
- ray photoelectron spectros- copy (XPS) [35] ,electron spin resonance (
ESR
) [39]
, UV
- Vis DRS [40
45] ,
X
- ray absorption fi ne structure spectroscopy (
XAFS
) [46] and Raman spectroscopy [37,47
50] . Most of these techniques give information only on the oxidation state of vanadia species. Although Raman spectroscopy is a powerful tool for character- ization of the molecular structure of supported vanadia [34, 42, 51] , it has been very diffi cult to detect reduced supported vanadia species with conventional (visible) Raman measurements [37, 47
52] . A widely accepted explanation for this phenomenon is that the Raman cross - section of reduced vanadium oxide species is very small or near zero [53] . Thus, it remains challenging to use Raman spec- troscopy for obtaining information on the molecular state of reduced vanadia species.
It is notable that most Raman studies of supported VO
x catalysts were carried out using a single excitation wavelength in the visible region (488, 514 or 532
nm)
[34, 46, 47, 54] . However, several recent investigations on supported transition metal oxides [55
58] , including vanadium oxides [55, 56] under ambient condi- tions, using both UV and visible wavelength Raman excitations suggest that more complete and sometimes new structural information of supported metal oxides can be achieved by using multiple excitation wavelengths. The reason lies in the strong electronic absorptions in the UV and visible wavelength regions exhibited by most transition metal oxides, which make it possible to measure resonance -
enhanced Raman spectra. Under circumstances where supported VO
x species are present in a distribution of cluster sizes or coordination geometries, it is likely that these species also possess a corresponding distribution of electronic absorption wavelengths. Excitation of Raman spectra within the absorption region will produce resonance - enhanced spectra from the subset of VO
x species with absorptions at the excitation wavelength. By measuring the Raman spectra at several wavelengths,more information can be obtained about the various VO
x species in the distribu- tion. Moreover, when UV excitation is employed, even Raman spectra from sup- ported VO
x at low loadings ( < 1 wt%) on oxides having strong fl uorescence are possible because of the avoidance of fl uorescence and enhanced sensitivity [59,60] . In addition, the decreased self - absorption effects in the UV region indicated by in situ UV - Vis DRS studies of reduced VO
x and CrO
x
[40
44, 61, 62] suggests
15.5 Vanadia  601

Studies on alumina supported catalysts with a range of vanadia weight loadings revealed [63, 64] that isolated VO
x species dominated at surface densities below 1 V/nm 2 ; polyvanadates coexisted with monovanadates at surface densities between
1.2

V/nm 2 ; and V 2
O
5 formed at a surface density higher than 4.4 V/nm 2 . The vanadia densities of the catalysts were 1.1
V/nm 2 for the sample with the 1% loading, 3.7 V/nm 2 for the 3.5% loading and 10.4
V/nm 2 for the 8% loading. Only the XRD pattern for the catalyst with the 8% loading exhibited additional charac- teristic peaks of crystalline V 2
O
5 at 2 θ values 26.3 and 34.6 [65, 66] . However,analysis by 51 V NMR revealed V 2
O
5 on the 3.5% vanadium as well as on the 8% (Gladden and McGregor, unpublished results).
Figure

a shows simple pulse - acquire 51 V MAS NMR spectra for catalysts with vanadium loadings of 1, 3.5 and 8 wt%. This simple 1 - D spectroscopy identi- fi es a 51 V resonance only in the 3.5 and 8
wt% catalysts. The spectra are dominated by spinning sidebands, with the isotropic chemical shift (denoted by * ) at
612 ppm being indicative of V 5+ in a V 2
O
5 environment. The broad background upon which these peaks are superimposed in the case of the 8
wt% sample is characteristic of
V
5+ in more amorphous environments. The spectra clearly suggest that the popula- tion of V 2
O
5 - like species in the 8 wt% catalyst is larger than in the 3.5 wt% catalyst,consistent with the Raman data. Alongside characterizing the 51 V environment, NMR spectroscopy of the 27 Al species is also of interest. Figure

70 ppm. Interpretation of the broader

although the NMR technique itself is more challenging
by using multiple quantum NMR spectroscopy. A triple - quantum spectrum from the 8
wt% catalyst is shown in Figure
15.5
b. The projection of such spectra in the F1 dimension yields the isotropic peaks, while the anisotropic line- shapes (corresponding to a standard MAS spectrum) are displayed by the projec- tion in the F2 dimension. The resolution of the isotropic resonance provided by the triple - quantum MAS experiment unambiguously confi rms the presence of three distinct 27 Al environments, assigned to 4 - , 5 - and 6 - coordinate Al.
Studies reveal that reduction takes place over a broad range of temperatures and the onset of reduction follows the weight loading with 8%
<
3.5%
< 1% but reduc- tion is complete for each sample by
873
K. This difference in onset of reduction
may be attributed to different reducibilities of vanadia species, monovanadates,polyvanadates and V 2
O
5 coexisting on the catalyst
s surface. The weight loss at the reduction step increases with vanadia loading: when these weights are translated into oxygen loss we see that there is a 1
:1 relationship between vanadium atoms and oxygen atom loss (Table
15.1
). The same trend in mass loss is observed during

604  15 Alkane Dehydrogenation over Vanadium and Chromium Oxides
Tapered Element Oscillating Microbalance (
TEOM
) studies of catalyst reduction (Gladden and McGregor, unpublished results). These studies also yield an average 1 :1 relationship between vanadium atoms and oxygen atom loss.
This would suggest a change of 2 in the vanadium oxidation state, so if the vanadium were in a +5 oxidation state before reduction it would be converted to +3 after reduction. This was confi rmed by in situ UV - Vis DRS. Before reduction the catalysts were in a V 5+ oxidation state with typical charge transfer bands at 267 nm for a 1% loading, 290
nm for a 3.5% loading and 357
nm for an 8% loading.
This change in position of the charge transfer band is indicative of the increasing polymeric nature of the vanadia [67] . Over the course of the reduction the spectrum changes to give spectra typical for a V 3+ state with d
d transitions around 575
nm and 625 nm for 3.5 %V and 8 %V. However, the spectrum of the 1% sample is more indicative of V 4+ , with a single band at 585
nm [31] . 51 V NMR spectroscopy revealed a total loss in signal after reduction, indicating the presence of V(III) or V(IV) species (Gladden and McGregor, unpublished results).
Using oxygen chemisorption at 293
K and 873 K the average oxidation state of the 1% VO
x
/alumina was calculated as 3.8, whereas the average oxidation state for the 3.5% VO
x
/alumina was calculated as 2.6 [31] . Both of these fi gures are in excel- lent agreement with the conclusions from the UV - Vis DRS.
Bulk re - oxidation data in conjunction with thermogravimetric analysis (
TGA
) and TEOM results indicated that the ease of replacing oxygen that had been removed during reduction was 8%
>
3.5%
> 1% [31] , (Gladden and McGregor,unpublished results). This difference was also seen in the UV - Vis DRS and in TEOM data. TEOM data provide information on the quantity of oxygen taken up by the catalysts and on their rate of re - oxidation. The rate of catalyst re - oxidation was seen to be greater for the 8
wt% catalyst than for materials of lower vanadium loading (Gladden and McGregor, unpublished results). Once reduced, the 3.5
%V
sample did not regain its original state even after high temperature oxidation;however, the reduced 8
%V sample did convert to a species that was similar to the original oxidation state.
Supported VO
x catalysts show good catalytic performance in both oxidation and reduction reactions; for example, they are among the most active and selective simple metal oxides for dehydrogenation and oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes. The possibility of using oxide systems other than chromia is being Table 15.1 Extent of oxygen removal during reduction of vanadia/alumina catalysts.

alkene conversion process more selec- tive and stable. Supported VO
x catalysts have been extensively studied for the oxi- dative dehydrogenation of light alkanes [40, 54, 68
72] . They have also been explored in the dehydrogenation of light alkanes including propane and butane
[35, 39, 73, 74] and have shown promise to be both active and selective for the dehydrogenation reactions. However deactivation of VO
x catalysts by coke species is also observed with time - on - stream in butane dehydrogenation reactions. Owing to the limited number of studies of supported VO
x for alkane dehydrogenation,the mechanism of deactivation/coke deposition and also the structure of sup- ported VO
x species under dehydrogenation conditions are unclear. Conventional visible Raman spectroscopy usually cannot provide meaningful spectra for a cata- lytic system that produces carbonaceous deposits because of strong fl uorescence interference. These two issues were addressed in an investigation of butane dehy- drogenation reaction on V/ θ - Al 2

x density from 0.03 to 14.2
V/nm 2 were tested for butane dehydrogenation under low partial pressures of butane at 873 K, and the activity and selectivity data on these different catalysts were compared [75] . In essence, the initial dehydrogenation activity increases as a function of surface VO
x
density. However, the activity decreases signifi cantly with prolonged reaction time for samples with VO
x density higher than 1.2
V/nm 2 , apparently due to the forma- tion of surface coke deposits and blocking of surface sites during the reaction.
Interestingly, the dehydrogenation activity remains nearly unchanged on the cata- lysts with surface VO
x density no higher than 1.2
V/nm 2 . However, at higher butane pressures, although the behavior of the 1.2
V/nm 2 sample is unchanged,catalysts with higher V/nm 2 densities show enhanced activity (Table

606  15 Alkane Dehydrogenation over Vanadium and Chromium Oxides
At temperatures below 673
K, a weak Raman band at 1620
cm
1 , assigned to C =
C
stretching in polyalkenes, is observed together with the two bands at 1021 and 915 cm
1 due to the V = O and V
O
Al modes of surface VO
x species, respectively.
After butane dehydrogenation at 673 and 773 K, an intense band at 1601
cm
1 due to polyaromatic hydrocarbons develops. Simultaneously, bands at 1500, 1438,1183, 1004 and 845
cm
1 are also observed. Meanwhile, Raman bands at 1021 and 915 cm
1 from surface VO
x species are no longer observable, owing to a combina- tion of the reduction of VO
x species [43, 45, 47, 65, 71] and strong optical absorp- tion by surface coke species. The band at 1500
cm
1 is usually assigned to conjugated polyalkenes or cyclopentadienyl species [76, 77] . The band at 1438
cm
1 is due to the bending mode of CH 3
/CH
2 or C
H in aromatic rings. C
H bending in aro- matics usually appears near 1180
cm
1 . The two sharp bands at 1004 and 845
cm
1 are rarely reported for coke species, and thus one might ascribe them to surface
VO
x species. However, the absence of an isotope shift on an 18
O
- exchanged V/ θ -
Al 2
O
3 sample confi rms that these bands are due to surface coke deposits. As the dehydrogenation temperature is increased to 873
K, the intensity of the Raman bands below 1500
cm
1 decreases signifi cantly. Raman spectra obtained after the reaction of butane with pre - reduced 1.2
%V (not shown) are very similar to those on pre - oxidized 1.2 %V. This suggests that the initial valence state of surface VO
x
does not affect the nature of coke species and most likely the VO
x species is at least partially reduced under butane dehydrogenation conditions. This conclusion can also be inferred from the similar activity/selectivity results from butane dehy- drogenation tests on either oxidized or pre - reduced 1.2
%V and also the similar

The set of Raman bands near 850, 1002, 1183, 1437, 1501 and 1603
cm
1 is also observed to grow simultaneously on all other V/ θ - Al 2
O
3 samples when treated in butane at high temperatures. To aid the assignment of these bands, the adsorption and reaction of different C 4 olefi ns were studied on the V/ θ - Al 2
O
3 samples via Raman spectroscopy. It turned out that they all form similar coke species, indicat- ing that they are precursors to coke species in butane dehydrogenation on V/ θ -
Al 2
O
3 catalysts. It is interesting to fi nd out that 1,3 - butadiene adsorption at room temperature results in similar spectra to that from butane dehydrogenation on
1.2
V at 673
K. Considering the low temperature (298
K), a possible chemical change for 1,3 - butadiene is its cyclization to form styrene on the surface. A com- parison of the spectrum from styrene with that after butane dehydrogenation at 673 K on 1.2 %V (Figure
15.7
) reveals a very similar set of bands. Also included is the spectrum from a mixture of 1.2 %V with styrene heated at 393
K (Figure
15.7
c).
Styrene is known to polymerize easily upon heating. Comparison of spectrum c to that reported for polystyrene [78] confi rms the identity of spectrum c: the set of Raman bands near 850, 1002, 1183, 1437, 1501 and 1603
cm
1 is due to polysty- rene. Thus, it appears that polystyrene is a key intermediate in the coke formation process during butane dehydrogenation on the 1.2
V catalyst. Further Raman spectroscopy study of styrene on V/ θ - Al 2
O
3 samples heated to 873
K showed that the characteristic Raman bands of polystyrene disappear, owing to its decomposi- tion. This is consistent with catalytic studies of polystyrene degradation over solid acid catalysts [79] . An interesting new observation is that although the Raman

15.5 Vanadia  607
608  15 Alkane Dehydrogenation over Vanadium and Chromium Oxides spectrum seems to indicate that the catalyst surface is free of coke species after polystyrene decomposition, the follow - up TPO (Temperature Programmed Oxida- tion) shows the evolution of a considerable amount of CO 2 . This suggests that the absence of typical Raman bands (1000
1650 cm
1 range) due to coke species does not necessarily mean the catalyst is coke free. Investigation of the catalytic surface with multi - wavelength Raman spectroscopy should be helpful in determining the chemical nature of this surface carbon. Microanalysis of a used 1.2
V catalyst for carbon and hydrogen gave a C
: H value of 0.9 as per polystyrene monomer in agreement with the Raman spectra [31] .
One important general characteristic of coke is its topology, which can be assessed by the intensity ratio of the band at around 1600
cm
1 (G band) to the band at around 1400
cm
1 (D band) [76, 80] . UV Raman spectra from a series of polyaromatic compounds [76, 81] show that the intensity in the spectral range 1600
1650 cm
1 is signifi cantly higher than that in the region 1300 to 1450
cm
1 for coke species with a 2 - D, sheet - like topology. By contrast, the intensity is more nearly equal in these two spectral regions for coke species with chain - like topolo- gies. The topology of coke species formed from butane dehydrogenation on the various V/ θ - Al 2
O
3 catalysts at 873 K is compared by plotting the intensity ratio of
I
G to
I
D as a function of surface VO
x density. It is shown that the coke species are more 2 - D, sheet - like from butane dehydrogenation on V/ θ - Al 2
O
3 with high surface
VO
x density ( >
1.2
V/nm 2 ) while more 1 -
D
- like on V/ θ - Al 2
O
3 with lower surface
VO
x density (
1.2
V/nm 2 ). The 2 - D coke species can, presumably, reorganize into pre - graphitic entities that have been thought to be the kind of coke that causes the deactivation of dehydrogenation catalysts [33, 82, 83] . A study of coke deposited on a 1 wt% V/Al 2
O
3 catalyst, in which the deactivation was studied as a function of time - on - stream (
TOS
) using 13
C
CP MAS (
cross - polarization magic angle spin- ning ) NMR reveals a signifi cant increase in the aromatic peak at 130 ppm up to 3 h, then a gradual decrease in this peak [84] . The initial increase in the peak intensity was explained by an initial coke build - up, whereas the decrease in inten- sity was due to formation of very slowly relaxing, NMR
invisible
, highly polyaro- matic coke, which formed under prolonged exposure to the reaction conditions.
This interpretation is consistent with the constant decrease in
T
2 of adsorbed pentane observed, which also suggests an increasing aromaticity of coke with increasing TOS. Further, a monotonic decrease in pentane self - diffusion coeffi - cient as a function of TOS was observed; these data are consistent with restriction in molecular motion resulting from pore blockage due to coke deposition as deac- tivation proceeds. However, in another study it was found that the majority of the catalyst deactivation in the early stages of reaction was not due to polynuclear aromatics or other forms of coke but to strongly adsorbed reaction intermediates
[31] . These species can be desorbed at room temperature by treating with a low concentration O 2 in Ar mix. Figure
15.8 shows desorption of butane from a series
of VO
x
/alumina catalysts.
The catalyst had been running under butane for 2
h at 873 K when the gas stream was switched from butane to argon. Online mass spectrometry indicated that all hydrocarbon components were rapidly swept out of the reactor at 873
K and no other gases apart from the argon carrier were detected during the cool - down period. However when 2% O 2 /Ar was passed over the sample at room temperature butane, butenes and butadiene were evolved. This desorption process can be viewed as an oxidative displacement, resulting in recombination of reaction inter- mediates (hydrogen and alkyl, alkenyl and alkadienyl) from the surface of reduced
VO
x  species. The polynuclear aromatics were only removed when the catalyst was subjected to a full regeneration involving high temperature oxidation [31] .
The regeneration of samples of V/ θ - Al 2
O
3 coked from low partial pressure butane dehydrogenation via oxidation was also followed by UV Raman spectros- copy as well as gas chromatography (
GC
). The Raman spectroscopy indicates that the structure of the VO
x species can be restored by oxidation of the coke deposits up to 873
K. UV
- Vis DRS, however, suggests that only high loaded samples are fully restored. 51 V MAS NMR confi rms the re - oxidation of reduced vanadium species and, as such, spectra of the regenerated catalyst can be acquired (Gladden and McGregor, unpublished results). Figure
15.4
b shows the spectrum of the 8 wt% catalyst after reaction at 973
K and regeneration at 873
K (note the peaks to negative intensity correspond to Al atoms in the support). By comparison with Figure
15.4
a it can be seen that the spectrum of the regenerated catalysts indi- cates the presence of a greater quantity of ordered V 2
O
5 - like species than were present in the as - prepared catalyst. However, one must take care as each tech- nique has its
blind spots and it is possible that it is the inability of each of the techniques to
see all of the vanadia species that leads to apparent differ- ences. At low butane partial pressure, TPO quantifi cation results showed that the amount of coke formed in butane dehydrogenation follows the sequence: poly- meric VO

> monomeric VO

After regeneration the surface area of an 8%V catalyst was reduced by 50%, a

A similar effect was observed after propane dehydrogenation over a vanadia/alumina catalyst [73] ,where a conversion of the γ - alumina support to α - alumina was confi rmed by
XRD.
27 Al triple - quantum (
3Q
) MAS NMR studies have also demonstrated that the nature of the support undergoes a transformation. Figure

c shows the
27 Al 3Q MAS NMR spectrum of 8V after reaction and regeneration. Comparison with Figure

b shows the loss of an isotropic resonance; this resonance was assigned to 5 - coordinate Al and the loss of this species suggests a transformation towards a more crystalline state in agreement with the reduced surface area.

Conclusions
In this chapter we have reviewed the use of chromia and vanadia in alkane dehy- drogenation. In both systems there is a rich and complex chemistry that is still not yet fully understood, although considerable advances have been made over the last few years. Both patent and academic literature are active and it can be expected to be so for many years to come.
