Catalysis Today 31 (1996) 293 - 304 Indium and gallium containing ZSM-5 zeolites: acidity and catalytic activity in propane transformation Jfinos Halfisz *, Zoltfin K6nya, Agnes Fudala, Attila Brres, Imre Kiricsi Applied Chemistry Department, Jrzsef Attila University, Rerrich tr 1, H-6720 Szeged, Hungary Abstract Surface acidity and propane transformation on In- and Ga-containing ZSM-5 type zeolites were investigated to find relation between the acidic character of catalysts prepared by conventional or solid state ion-exchange and the catalytic activity in alkane aromatization. On the basis of the concentration of BrSnsted and Lewis acid sites measured by IR spectroscopy the In and Ga containing samples may be ordered into three main groups. The presence of BriJnsted acid sites results in cracking of the hydrocarbon molecules, whereas the aromatization activity is attributed to Lewis acidity associated with the intimate contact of the oxide/zeolite assemblies.
1. Introduction
The direct conversion of light paraffins (primarily propane and butane) to aromatic compounds is of expanding importance for pro- duction of gasoline additives. The UOP/BP Cyclar process using a Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalyst has been scaled up for industrial operation [1].
As no metallic component is present in Ga/H- ZSM-5 zeolite the oxide component and the acid sites should operate as catalytically active sites [2]. The chemical state, the concentration and the dispersion of gallium oxide and the BrSnsted or Lewis acid sites have frequently been the subjects of research papers [3-5].
Beside gallium, indium and, less, thallium containing zeolites were also investigated. The general aim was to improve the activity and * Corresponding author.
BTX selectivity of the catalysts in light alkane reactions [6,7].
Three different procedures have usually been applied for preparation of metal containing cata- lysts of MFI structure.
(i) Synthesis of isomorphously substituted metal silicates with an appropriate metal content in the framework [8,9]. It has been demonstrated that the concentration of the M 3 + ions incorpo- rated into the framework decreases with increas- ing ion radius. As a result, preparation of sili- cates with identical and high M 3+ (A1, In or T1) concentration was generally unsuccessful [10].
However, Giannetto et al. confirmed relatively high Ga incorporation due to the presence of stable monomer gallate ions in the alkaline syn- thesis media [11-13].
(ii) In connection with the conventional (liquid phase) ion-exchange it is necessary to mention that the solutions of A13+, Ga 3, In 3+ and T13 ions are stable in acidic media. This 0920-5861/96/$32.00  1996 Elsevier Science

fact limits the applicability of the conventional ion-exchange procedure apart from the use of siliceous zeolites such as H-ZSM-5 resistant under acidic circumstances [14].
(iii) The solid state ion-exchange method is the most promising procedure for introducing metal ions into zeolites [15]. In general, an intimate mixture of the respective metal oxide and H-ZSM-5 zeolite is prepared and heat treated by a certain temperature program in oxidative or reductive atmosphere [16].
Metal halides are very rarely used for the preparation of gallium or indium containing cat- alysts [17] although H-ZSM-5 zeolite is resistant to HC1 generated [14]. The most probable expla- nation is the difficult preparation and low stabil- ity of these halides.
The acidic character of these catalysts and the effect of acidity on their activity and/or selectivity have been the topic of quite a large number of papers ([3,18-22], and the references therein). Although this property is of crucial importance in the LPG (low paraffins to gaso- line) process, clear-cut correlations have not been found yet.
The aim of the present communication is to disclose data for establishing a relation between the acidic character of Ga and In containing zeolites prepared by various methods and their catalytic activity in the dehydrocyclooligomer- ization of propane.
2. Experimental
Na-ZSM-5 zeolite was synthesized in our laboratory according to the recipe in [23] using tetrapropyl ammonium bromide as template. The Si/A1 ratio in the reacting gel was 40. After burning the template off, the ammonium form of the zeolite was prepared by conventional ion exchange in 0.1 molar ammonium chloride solu- tion. Deammonization of this sample yielded the required H-form.
For the conventional ion-exchange, 0.1 molar Ga(NO3) 3 or In(NO3) 3 solutions were applied.
The liquid phase ion-exchange was performed at 353 K with the exchange suspension stirred overnight followed by centrifugation. The pro- cedure was repeated three times using the wet cake and fresh solutions. The solid material was subsequently washed nitrate free with double distilled water and dried in a desiccator at ambi- ent temperature. The samples produced by this method are denoted as Ga(1)-ZSM-5 and In(1)- ZSM-5. The degree of (liquid phase) ion-ex- change of In was determined by UV-VIS spec- troscopic analysis of the solutions measuring the absorbance of the complex of In 3 with 8-hy- droxyquinoline at 396 nm.
For the solid state ion-exchange Ga203, InzO 3 or InC13 was carefully mixed with H- ZSM-5 zeolite in an agate ball-mill. These me- chanical mixtures were heated to 800 K in a nitrogen atmosphere and baked at this tempera- ture for 12 h. After cooling to room temperature the samples were rehydrated in an adhumator.
The samples prepared are denoted as Ga203/ZSM-5, In203/ZSM-5 and In(s)-ZSM-
5.
For checking the crystallinity of the prepared catalyst precursors X-ray diffraction and IR spectroscopy in the framework vibration region were used. XRD patterns were collected from well-powdered samples applying a DRON3 diffractometer. For IR analysis KBr pellets with
0.25% zeolite content were pressed and ana-
lyzed by a Mattson Genesis FTIR spectrometer.
BET measurements were used for monitoring the effect of ion-exchange and pretreatments.
Adsorption isotherms of nitrogen were mea- sured in a wide equilibrium pressure range at 77
K. The BET surface area was selected as a
measure of the adsorption capacity of the cata- lyst precursors. Preceding the measurements the samples were pretreated at 723 K for 3 h in vacuum.
Acidity of the samples was determined by pyridine adsorption monitored by IR spec- troscopy. For this purpose self-supported wafers with a thickness of 10 mg/cm 2 were pressed and placed into the sample holder of the IR cell.

295 The wafers were degassed at 723 K for 3 h in vacuum (the final vacuum was less than 10 -4 Pa). After cooling to room temperature the background spectrum was registered followed by adsorption of 10 Torr (1333 Pa) of pyridine.
Samples were treated in the presence of pyri- dine vapour for 1 h at 473 K followed by evacuation at the same temperature. Spectra of adsorbed pyridine were registered at room tem- perature.
The conversion of propane as test reaction was studied in a fixed-bed flow reactor in the presence or absence of oxygen. Catalyst sam- ples (0.5 g) in a quartz tubular reactor were pretreated in nitrogen flow at 773 K for 2 h to standardize the catalyst surface. In some cases reductive pretreatment with a flow of 1:1 =
N: :H 2 was utilized under identical conditions.
In the catalytic measurements the total gas flow rate in the reactor was 120 cm 3 s -1,ensuring a contact time was of 0.5 s. The inlet gas composition were 20% C3H 8 + 80% N 2 or 20% C3H 8 + 20% 0 2 + 60% N 2 at atmospheric pressure.
Product analysis was performed by an on-line GC (CHROM-5 equipment) using a Porapack-Q column for the analysis of gaseous products,and a Shimadzu GC-16A chromatograph with a 30 m long SPB-1 capillary column for the anal- ysis of the liquid phase products collected dur- ing the 2 h runs. The normalized amounts of products were calculated on carbon basis, with carbon mass balances being accurate within 5- 8%. This deficiency may be attributed to coke formation.

pied 40% of ion-exchange positions of the par- ent zeolites.
The BET data listed in the third column of Table 1 show that no significant change in the zeolite structure occurred upon treatments used to prepare catalyst precursors (the small de- crease for the In(s)-ZSM-5 sample is insignifi- cant). In contrast with the finding of Parvulescu et al. [24] no change in the shape of nitrogen isotherms was observed. This shows that ion- exchange did not result in the formation of secondary pore systems.
Powder X-ray diffraction measurements re- vealed no structural change, i.e. no loss of crystallinity was observed.
In the fourth column the ratio of the inte- grated areas of the absorption bands at 550 and 450 cm -1 are to be seen. These bands are regarded as structure sensitive vibrations. Their ratio, consequently, can be used for the charac- terization of the ZSM-5 structure [25,26]. The data presented show only small deviations around the average figure that is 0.89.
In Fig. 1 the spectra of Ga and In modified ZSM-5 zeolites exhibiting some remarkable fea- tures are shown. The first is the absence of the respective oxide phases in the solid state ex- changed materials; it might be due to the very little size of the oxide phases. This finding is in accordance with the X-ray results. Second, the band generally appearing around 920-970 cm-i assumed to be the indication of successful iso- morphous substitution [27] is present only in the Ga203/ZSM-5 sample. It should be stressed 296
J. Hal6sz et al. / Catalysis Today 31 (1996) 293-304
already here, however, that according to a dif- ferent assignment, the band at around 930 cm-1 is due to framework vacancies [28].
Fig. 2 shows the spectra in the range of OH vibrations of catalysts pretreated at 723 K in vacuum for 3 h. In Fig. 2A spectra of materials prepared by conventional ion-exchange are de- picted. It is clearly seen that considerable changes took place for both the In 3 + and Ga 3 + forms upon ion-exchange since very intense bands appeared at 3608 cm -1 characteristic of Si-(OH)-A1 bridged OH groups [29]. The in- tensity of this band is much stronger for these samples than for the parent H-ZSM-5 zeolite (spectrum c). A small shift from 3745 to 3730 cm-  in the position of the Si-OH band due to terminal silanol groups can also be observed. In addition, new intense absorption developed at 3666 cm -1 for Ga(1)-ZSM-5. Bands in this spectral region are assigned to vibrations of OH groups linked to extraframework species.
The sample prepared by solid state ion-ex- change gives very similar spectra taken after treatment in oxygen at 723 K for 3 h (Fig. 2B).
Here, the band due to the Si-(OH)-A1 bridged OH groups is very intense for H-ZSM-5, less intense for In203/ZSM-5, even smaller for In(s)-ZSM-5 and the weakest for the Ga203/ZSM-5 sample. For each zeolite, an indication is seen for the presence of OH groups attached to extraframework species. The Si-OH band is centered at 3745 cm - for H-ZSM-5 whereas it appears at 3730 cm - for In203/ZSM-5. Spectra registered after hydro- gen treatment (723 K, 3 h) show fundamental dissimilarities (Fig. 2C). The spectra of H-ZSM- 5 and Ga203/ZSM-5 taken after treatment ei- ther in reductive or oxidative atmosphere are quite similar. However, this is not the case for the indium containing materials.
For In203/ZSM-5, after reductive treatment both the bridged OH band at 3608 cm-1 and the OH absorption due to extraframework species are intense. It is also obvious that two Si-OH bands can be distinguished in the spectrum at 3745 and 3730 cm -. The spectrum of the In(s)- ZSM-5 sample does not show the absorption of bridged OH groups and only a small band ap- pears at the position of OH groups attributed to extraframework species. On the basis of spectral features of the OH groups substantial differ- ences should be expected for the acidity of the samples prepared and pretreated in different ways.
It is well-known that the bands centered at 1450 and 1540 cm -1 can be used to calculate BriSnsted and Lewis acidity. Figs. 3 and 4 show

297 the spectra of pyridine adsorbed on gallium and indium containing samples pretreated in oxygen or hydrogen. For comparison the spectrum of pyridine adsorbed on the parent H-ZSM-5 is also inserted. Conspicuous, the high concentra- tion of Lewis acid sites of Ga203/ZSM-5 pre- treated in hydrogen (Fig. 3, spectrum a). For the Ga(1)-ZSM-5 sample, the ratio of the two differ- ent acidities is roughly equivalent while on H-ZSM-5 more Lewis than BrSnsted acid sites are present as can be concluded from the areas of the bands centered at 1450 and 1540 cm -1.
The spectra of indium containing zeolites taken after treatment in oxygen (at 723 K for 3 h) are displayed in Fig. 4. An interesting trend,the increase in Lewis acidity is seen going from the conventionally ion-exchanged In(1)-ZSM-5,to the solid phase ion-exchanged InEO3/ZSM-5 and In(s)-ZSM-5 specimens shown by the inte- grated peak areas at 1450 cm-1.
Acidity data calculated from the integral ab- sorption of pyridine spectrum taken after either oxidative or reductive pretreatment of the zeo- lite samples are collected in Table 2. For these calculations, absorption coefficients for pyridine bonded to Br5nsted and Lewis sites were taken from the work of Take et al. [30]. The data show that both preparation and pretreatment conditions have fundamental influence on the acidic character of the modified zeolites. The concentration of Brnsted acid sites proved to be the highest for In(1)-ZSM-5 and the lowest for Ga203/ZSM-5 both pretreated in hydrogen.
As Lewis acidity is concerned, the highest value was found for Ga203/ZSM-5 pretreated in hy- drogen, while the lowest concentration was ex- hibited by Ga(1)-ZSM-5 pretreated in oxygen.

Below 673 K the conversion of propane can- not be detected at all. In contrast, comparable rates could be determined at 773 K on all the catalysts tested. In the absence of 0 2 , propane conversion was lower in each case than in the presence of oxygen, and relatively fast catalyst deactivation was observed. In contrast, the pres- ence of 0 2 results in a considerably increase in catalyst lifetime. This is due to the removal of the surface coke layer in the form oxygen con- taining compounds (mainly carbon oxides).

Over H-ZSM-5 the main products are methane, ethane and ethene, and aromatization takes place only to a relatively small extent. An almost uniform aromatic distribution in the C 6- C 9 range is detected. The deficiency of the mass balance can be explained by strong coke formation.

This effect is the most characteristic of the Ga203/ZSM-5 sample,where the aromatic selectivity is close to 30% with considerable C 9 formation. The product distribution over Ga(1)-ZSM-5 is similar to that observed over the original H-ZSM-5 with ap- proximately the same conversion.

The distribution of aromatic products are shown in Figs. 7 and 8. Over the pure oxides benzene forms almost exclusively, while the zeolite catalysts promote the formation of alkyl- benzenes up to C15. Approximately 50% C9+ selectivity (within the aromatic fraction) is char- acteristic of Ga203/ZSM-5 and In(s)-ZSM-5 samples. High BTX selectivity can be observed over the catalysts prepared by conventional ion-exchange and on IneO3/ZSM-5.
The reductive pretreatment did not change the properties of the Ga(1)- and In(1)-ZSM-5 catalysts at all. In contrast, higher activity and higher aromatic selectivity could be found in the initial period of the runs (first 10 to 20 min) over catalysts prepared by the solid state ion-ex- change methods. However, after this initial dif- ference, the behaviour of the In-containing cata- lysts were the same as the ones pretreated by the usual method due to the oxidative reaction conditions. The effect of this pretreatment dur- ing the entire reaction is characteristic only of the Ga203/ZSM-5 sample.
4. Discussion
The catalytic aromatization of light paraffins over zeolites is usually related to the acidic properties and the shape selectivity effects of the catalysts. The acidic properties of ZSM-5 zeolite has been extensively studied. However,the effect of acidity modification on catalytic activity is still not clear. Consequently, any attempt to find correlations should be an impor- tant contribution in this field.
For interpretation of the IR spectra the first step is to account for the origin of the band at 963 cm -, which is not an easy task. This band is clearly visible in the spectrum of Ga203/ZSM-5, but only some indications are to be seen in the spectra of the other zeolites.
The appearance and the intensity of the band at 930-960 cm-1 are regarded, respectively, as the indication and extent of modification of structural units in zeolites. This band is gener- ally appears in metal silicates irrespective to whether they are prepared by direct synthesis or postsynthesis treatment. Several authors re- cently assigned the band at 930-960 cm-1 as an indication of the successful isomorphous substitution of framework aluminum occurring upon solid state ion-exchange [9,35-37]. More than a decade ago, the band at 960 cm-1 was attributed to framework vacancies generated upon dealumination of mordenite type zeolites.
It was also demonstrated that the intensity of this band increases with the concentration of aluminum removed from the framework. Oxi- halides, non-metal and even metal chlorides were utilized as dealuminating reactants [28,38].
Recently, Namba et al. reported the "atom- planting procedure" in which metal chloride vapours were passed through a zeolite bed at elevated temperature [39], resulting in isomor- phous incorporation. It is remarkable that others used the same procedure for dealumination of zeolites leading to the removal of the aluminum from the framework of zeolites [28]. Karge in his plenary lecture in Leipzig did not mention the appearance of a band in this region as a consequence of solid state ion-exchange per- formed for numerous metal ions [15]. These results clearly reveal that the precise assignment of the band at 930-960 cm-1 is ambiguous as concluded Vedrine [40]. It is also our opinion that a single band cannot be used as a rigorous experimental proof to indicate isomorphous sub- stitution nor measure its extent.
The problem of band intensity at 550 cm- or the ratio of the optical density of bands at 600-550 and 480-450 cm -1 should also be discussed. A method to compare the intensity of bands at 550 and 450 cm - in the spectra of ZSM-5 zeolites was first suggested by Coudurier et al., in order to obtain a measure for the crystallinity of zeolites [25]. They suggested to use 0.72 as a limiting ratio. Samples character- ized by higher value are regarded as well-crys- tallized, whereas lower values are considered to 302
J. Haldsz et aL/ Catalysis Today 31 (1996) 293-304
characterise poor crystallinity. In our practice this fast and simple qualification of zeolites proved to be successful. Our experience shows,however, that this intensity ratio cannot be di- rectly used for indication or measure for iso- morphous substitution or effective incorporation of various elements in the framework position of zeolites as suggested by several authors [41,42]. In our opinion, the high values of this ratio are characteristic of the completely or well-crystallized zeolites, which also requires the realization of perfect incorporation of the entering atoms.
Corresponding to literature the data of Table 2 clearly prove that Ga and In differ extensively in their response to reductive treatment.
Kanazirev et al. [41] showed that Ga203 reduc- tion required at least 450C, and the product was Ga + which was able to migrate into the zeolite and replaced the proton. In203, how- ever, requires only 300C or so for onset of reduction [43]. If reduction temperature of 450C (or above) is applied, In may form which cannot replace protons as Ga + does (see BrSnsted/Lewis acidity ratio of Table 2).
Both spectroscopic methods give useful val- ues for comparing the characteristics of zeolites,however, the use for drawing structural conclu- sion may lead to misunderstandings.
On the basis of the measured concentration of Brtinsted and Lewis acid sites on the zeolites,the samples may be ordered into the following main groups.
(i) Highly Brtinsted acidic samples, in which BriSnsted acid sites predominate over Lewis ones. These are the specimens prepared by con- ventional ion-exchange procedure [Ga(1)-ZSM- 5, In(1)-ZSM-5].
(ii) The H-ZSM-5 sample, which possesses somewhat higher Lewis than BriSnsted acidity.
It is noteworthy, that the overall acidity does not change after oxidative or reductive treat- ment.
(iii) In the solid state ion-exchanged materi- als, the relative amounts of Lewis acidity is higher than Brtinsted acidity. Pretreatment con- ditions were shown to affect the acidity of these samples. The behaviour of Ga203/ZSM-5 and that of In2Oa/ZSM-5 and In(s)-ZSM-5 was different. For the former the reductive treatment resulted in gradual increase of Lewis acidity,whereas for the indium containing samples only a slight increase was detected.
The aromatization of propane and butane takes place via general mechanism suggested in the literature [3-5,44]. According to this mecha- nism alkane molecules are first dehydrogenated to olefins which are then dimerized or oligomer- ized to form higher hydrocarbons followed by cyclization and aromatization.
The activation of olefins is characteristic of pure oxides and the mixed oxide catalysts used for selective oxidation processes [45]. The olefin dehydrogenation and dimerization steps, accord- ingly take place over the Ga 3+ or In 3+ centers of the catalysts. The centers are assigned to surface gallium or indium species, therefore they should play considerably role only in the further reaction of propene. Rapid paraffin dehydro- genation could be observed only on the samples prepared by solid state reactions with predomi- nating Lewis acid character. Consequently, the first step of alkane activation should involve Lewis acid sites appearing via the formation of carbonium ions. IR measurements prove the presence of these centers are characteristic of Ga203 or In203 containing samples and these samples possess the highest aromatic selectivity.
Dehydrogenation and the coupling of the in- termediates formed by dehydrogenation could be accounted for by isolated Ga203 or In203 assemblies with Lewis acidic character in the zeolite structure [43,46,47], whereas further steps resulting in the formation of benzene and alkylaromatics take place over the zeolite.
Brinsted acid sites result in cracking the hydro- carbon molecules and the probable alkylation of the aromatic ring. Synergism, namely intimate contact between the oxide "particles" and the acidic sites of the ZSM-5 structure can be as- sumed as active sites for the dehydrogenation and aromatization of alkanes.

303 The increasing activity and aromatic selectiv- ity caused by reductive pretreatment is really effective in the case of Ga203. It can be ex- plained by the migration of the Ga x+ ions to the ion-exchange positions in the zeolite structure and their interaction with Brtinsted acid sites.
This interaction causes the decrease in B65nsted acidity with simultaneous increase in Lewis acidity. Since the mobility of the larger In ions is limited, the dispersion of In203 is much smaller and the indium oxide/zeolite assem- blies can only be found on the outer surface of the zeolite particles.
5. Conclusions
(i) In-containing ZSM-5 zeolites prepared by different ion-exchange methods are active cata- lysts in the transformation of propane. Activities are comparable with those of similar Ga-con- taining samples.
(ii) The acidic character of the samples may be controlled by the ion-exchange procedure and the pretreatment methods.
(iii) High cracking activity is characteristic of the catalysts with high surface BrtJnsted acidity,while the catalysts having Lewis acidity are effective in the dehydrogenation and aromatiza- tion reactions.
