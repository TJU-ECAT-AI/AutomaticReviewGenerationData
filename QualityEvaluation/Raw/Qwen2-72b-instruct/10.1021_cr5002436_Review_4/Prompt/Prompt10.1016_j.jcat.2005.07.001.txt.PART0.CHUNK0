Surface properties, such as the surface area; surface In content, measured by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS); and acidity and basicity, measured both by adsorption microcalorimetry using ammonia and sulfur dioxide as probe molecules and by infrared spectroscopy of pyridine adsorption, were determined. Bulk properties, namely the crystallographic structure as determined by powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis and the redox character of the In2O3-dispersed phase as determined by redox cycles performed both in a flow apparatus and in a thermobalance coupled with a differential scanning microcalorimeter (TG-DSC), were studied. The results obtained were interpreted in terms of In2O3 surface dispersion or aggregation. The catalysts tested in the reduction of NOx by ethene in an oxygen-rich atmosphere showed an interesting ability to selectively reduce NOx to N2, independently of the In loading. The weakness of the oxidative properties of the In2O3 phases limited the ethene combustion and made the catalysts able to reduce NOx even at high temperature (up to 550 C). The rates of nitrogen formation depended strongly on the In2O3 aggregation state; the In centers were very active even at low amounts. 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

1. Introduction
Catalysts containing group III elements (B, Al, Ga, and In) have received much attention in recent years [113].
Besides their use as supports for active metal centers, par- ticularly in Al2O3-containing materials, these elements play an important role in novel catalytic materials such as pro- moters, supported metal oxides and mixed oxides, supported bimetallic catalysts, and modified zeolites [1424]. These catalysts have been tested in various catalytic reactions of petrochemical (e.g., aromatization of light alkanes and de- hydrogenation of long-chain alkanes) and environmental in- terest. In this direction, the search for viable catalysts that * Corresponding author. Fax: +33-472445399.

Since the first reports of the high selective catalytic reduction and decomposition activity toward NOx of copper- [25,26] and other cations (Fe, Co, Ga, and In) [24,2730]-exchanged zeolites, a large variety of nonzeolitic, practically usable,catalysts have been tested for the NO abatement of emis- sions from both motor vehicles and stationary sources under net oxidizing conditions.
Gallium or indium supported on zeolites have been found to be more suitable for the de-NOx reactions (i.e., selective catalytic reduction of NOx by using hydrocarbons, HC-SCR process) than copper or iron, which favor the undesired di- rect complete oxidation of the used hydrocarbon species to carbon dioxide rather than the hydrocarbon oxidation by the NOx species [24,27,31].

demonstrated that Ga2O3 and In2O3 oxides supported on acidic supports, such as γ -Al2O3, TiO2, and SiO2Al2O3,present a remarkable de-NOx catalytic activity [13,3236].
Low-loading In2O3 catalysts supported on alumina have been reported to show not only high-activity NOx reduction,but also high resistance to water and SO2 poisoning [12,37],which makes them innovative and promising catalytic mate- rials for de-NOx applications.
Although promising catalytic results have been obtained and in-depth characterization studies on In2O3 on alumina- based catalysts have been performed in the last few years [5,32,37,38], the detailed properties of such materials in rela- tion to the presence of surface acidic and/or basic species and indium redox character merit further attention due to their high implication in the reactivity. In this paper, a series of In2O3-oxide based catalysts with different loadings (3 30 wt%) supported on a commercial γ -Al2O3 were prepared and studied in terms of their surface and bulk properties and catalytic activity. The acidic character of these catalysts and the effect of acidity on their activity and selectivity have been studied. The combined use of Fourier transform in- frared (FTIR) spectroscopy and adsorption microcalorimetry made it possible to characterize the acidbase properties of the samples. FTIR spectroscopy of adsorbed pyridine gave information on the types of acidic sites present, whereas ad- sorption microcalorimetry of NH3 and SO2 probe molecules gave the number and strength of the acidic and basic sites,respectively. The understanding of the surface chemistry of such systems also requires deeper insight into the redox character of the active sites. The information derived from the characterization techniques has been correlated with the NOx reduction activity in catalytic tests carried out under lean conditions and high space velocity. We conclude that the In aggregation state at the surface and the relative redox properties play a decisive role in the de-NOx reaction.
2. Experimental
2.1. Sample preparation
Samples with different amounts of indium oxide sup- ported on γ -Al2O3 (oxide C from Degussa) have been pre- pared by incipient wetness impregnation using appropriate amounts of In(NO3)3·5H2O from Aldrich (99.9%). After impregnation, the samples were dried at 120 C overnight and calcined at 500 C in oxygen flow for 12 h. The amount of indium oxide varied from 3 to 24 wt%. Bulk In2O3 was prepared in the same way, by calcination of indium nitrate at 500 C after drying at 120 C overnight.
2.2. Sample characterization
The concentrations of the supported indium oxide were determined by AES-ICP in a Spectroflame-ICP instrument.
Surface areas were determined by the BET method from the adsorption of nitrogen at 196 C. The crystallographic structure was examined by XRD in a Bruker (Siemens) D5005 apparatus (Cu-Kα radiation, 0.154 nm). The oxida- tion state of indium was determined by XPS at room temper- ature using an SSI 301 spectrometer.
The acidity and basicity of the supported indium sam- ples and of the bare support were determined by adsorption microcalorimetry, using NH3 and SO2 as probe molecules.
The measurements were carried out isothermically at 80 C in a heat flow calorimeter (Setaram C80) coupled with a standard volumetric apparatus [3942]. The samples were pretreated at 400 C in vacuum overnight before the mea- surements were made. Successive doses of gas were sent to the sample until a final pressure of 0.5 Torr was obtained.
The sample was then evacuated for 30 min at the same tem- perature to remove the amount physically adsorbed, and a second adsorption was performed. The quantity adsorbed at
0.2 Torr in the first adsorption is called VT (total adsorbed
amount). The difference between the amounts adsorbed in the first and second adsorptions at 0.2 Torr is the irreversibly chemisorbed amount (Virr).
FTIR measurements were carried out in self-supported pellets in a Bruker Vector 22 spectrometer. Before these measurements, the samples were pretreated in oxygen flow at 400 C overnight and pumped out for 1 h at the same tem- perature. For each sample, one spectrum was recorded on the clean sample, and a second spectrum was recorded after pyridine adsorption at room temperature and evacuation at 150 C for 30 min.
The redox properties of the supported indium samples have been studied by TPRTPO. The sample was held in a U-shaped quartz reactor, allowing the reductant or oxidizing gas stream to pass through the sample. In TPR experiments,the temperature was increased by 5 C min1 from room temperature up to 840 C, under a reducing atmosphere of 5% H2/Ar (flux 20 cm3 min1). The temperature was kept at 840 C for 1 h, then the sample was cooled under ar- gon atmosphere. After TPR, a TPO experiment was carried out using the same experimental conditions but increasing the temperature only up to 800 C, because volatilization of In2O3 occurs at 850 C [43]. The oxidizing atmosphere was 1% O2/He. The hydrogen or oxygen consumption was de- termined by means of a TCD (Delsi Instruments DN11).
Before TPR experiments, the samples were reoxidized un- der oxygen at 400 C for 3 h and cooled down under argon atmosphere.
The redox properties were also studied using a differen- tial scanning calorimeter (DSC) coupled to a microbalance (TG-DSC 111 from Setaram). This equipment makes it pos- sible not only to calculate the reduced or oxidized amount from the weight loss or gain of the sample, but also to si- multaneously measure the evolved heat associated with the reduction or oxidation process. Unlike in the TPRTPO ex- periments, the samples were held in a quartz crucible so the reactant gas could not pass through the sample. As in TPRTPO, successive experiments of reduction and oxi-

423 dation were carried out. The temperature was increased at 5 C min1 up to 650 C, then kept constant for 30 min be- fore the samples were cooled under helium atmosphere. The reduction experiments were carried out using a total flux of 30 cm3 min1 with a mixture of 68% of hydrogen in helium.
For oxidation experiments, the flux was 15 cm3 min1, with a composition of 46% O2/He.
2.3. Catalytic activity experiments
The catalytic tests were carried out with powder samples of mass around 0.1 g. The powders were introduced in a quartz tubular microreactor (5 mm i.d.) between plugs of quartz wool and pretreated in a flow containing 20% v/v of O2/He while increasing the temperature in stages up to 350 C and maintaining it for 4 h. The reactant stream was obtained using a set of mass flow controllers (Bronkhorst, Hi-Tec) supplying about 3000 ppm of NO and of C2H4,and 40,000 ppm of O2 in helium at a total flow rate of 85 cm3 min1, with the reactor at near-atmospheric pres- sure. The simultaneous presence in the feed mixture of NO with large amounts of O2 gave rise to homogeneous oxi- dation of NO, leading to the presence of NO2 in the feed (namely, NOx) as well. The amount of NO2 was typically about 16% of the NO total feed. Contact time was main- tained constant at 1.6 g s mmol1 (GHSV = 50,000 h1).
The temperature was increased from 250 to 550 C with a heating rate of 10 C/min, and eight reaction temperatures were investigated in this interval. Each temperature plateau was maintained for 70 min. The attainment of steady-state conditions was controlled by recording the concentration of the different species as a function of time on stream (TOS).
As a general trend, 30 min was a sufficient time to obtain stable concentrations of the different species.
The exit gas stream of the reactor flowed through a gas cell (multiple reflection gas cell, path length 2.4 m) in the beam of an FTIR spectrometer (Bio-Rad with a DTGS detector). The spectrometer made it possible to individu- ate and measure the concentrations of NO, N2O, and NO2 for N-containing species and of C2H4, CO, and CO2 for C-containing species. The measurements were carried out with a resolution of 0.50 cm1, with an accumulation of 19 scans per spectrum. The gas cell presented an accuracy of 10 ppm for NO and 4 ppm for N2O and for NO2 us- ing lines at 1876, 2225, and 1619 cm1, respectively. The cumulative absorbance of all the IR active species flowing from the reactor was monitored every 120 s. The absorbance profile of each species detected as a function of time or temperature of reaction was determined on the basis of the chosen wavelength of absorption of the species, decompos- ing the cumulative absorbance curve.
De-NOx activity in terms of NOx conversion was de- termined by subtracting the total NO + NO2 concentration flowing out from the reactor from the total NO + NO2 con- centration fed into the reactor. The amount of NOx converted corresponded to N2 formed. From this determination, spe- cific rates per unit mass of catalyst and per mol of In were calculated. Selectivity to N2 was evaluated in terms of the so-called competitiveness factor (SSCR, %), defined as the ratio between the amount of C2H4 consumed to reduce NOx to N2 and the total amount of C2H4 consumed [44,45].
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Characterization analysis
The indium oxide loading determined by chemical analy- sis and the surface area are summarized in Table 1. A re- markable decrease in the surface area occurred on increasing the amount of indium oxide deposited. The variation of the surface area of the different samples with the deposited in- dium oxide amount is represented in Fig. 1. The data fit very well with a straight line, indicating that the decrease in the surface area can be due to the coverage of the sup- port by a phase of much lower surface area, rather than to a change of morphology or other modification of the sup- port, due to blockage of its pores. Fig. 2 presents the XRD spectra of all the samples. Whereas the chosen alumina was an amorphous support, the bulk indium oxide presents very well-developed crystalline phases. The peak intensities and their 2θ angles were identified as characteristic of the cubic structure of In2O3. In the supported samples, the crystalline Table 1 Physico-chemical properties of the samples Sample Surface area (m2 g1) Loading (wt%)

Fig. 2. XRD of the samples loaded with different amounts of indium oxide. indium oxide phase was observed starting from 10% load- ing. The position of the line and the relative intensities of the signal were the same as for the bulk indium oxide, indi- cating that the support did not influence the crystallization of indium oxide. For the least-loaded samples (InAl-3 and InAl-6), no signal was observed due to the small crystal size or to the presence of amorphous indium oxide. In addi- tion, sample InAl-17 displayed better dispersion than sample InAl-13.
XPS experiments make it possible to determine not only the oxidation state, but also the surface In/Al ratio. These results are summarized in Table 1. In all cases, only one ox- idation state was found, with binding energy for In 3d5/2 between 444.5 and 444.8 eV. These values are characteristic of In2O3 [46]. Considering that XPS is a surface technique,the In/Al ratio gives an idea of the dispersion of the de- posited oxide. The higher the ratio, the higher the amount of exposed indium oxide compared with the total amount of de- posited indium oxide. Because the theoretical monolayer is around 23 wt% of InO3 [8], increasing the In loading should have given rise to an increasing or at least constant In/Al ra- tio for a similar dispersion, but this was not the case. There was no direct relationship between the amount of deposited indium oxide and the In/Al ratio, because the maximum ra- tio was reached for the InAl-10 sample. Above 10 wt% of In2O3, the In/Al molar ratio decreased significantly without a clear trend with In loading. This may be because the high heterogeneity of the surfaces have more or less large zones of uncovered support. Moreover, it is likely that only a lim- ited amount of alumina centers can act as anchoring points for bonding with indium oxide. Above 10 wt%, these cen- ters appear to behave as nucleation or aggregation centers.
Similar results have been found by other authors [37].
Fig. 3 shows the FTIR spectra of the supported indium samples and the bare alumina in the region of hydroxyl groups after pretreatment in oxygen flow at 400 C and fur- ther outgassing at the same temperature. The typical OH vibrations at 3672, 3723, and 3788 cm1 found for γ -Al2O3 [47] were not altered by the indium oxide deposition. A new signal not found in bare alumina appeared at 3766 cm1 and Fig. 3.

The differential heats of ammonia adsorption versus cov- erage at 80 C are represented in Fig. 4. To compare the ammonia-adsorbed amounts between the different samples,these amounts are represented per square meter of surface area. All the supported indium oxide samples present the same profile as bare alumina. Only a slight difference can be observed in the initial part of the curve, where the supported indium oxide samples present higher adsorption heats than the pure alumina, probably due to a charge imbalance along

The total and irreversibly adsorbed amounts of ammonia are summarized in Table 2. Bulk indium oxide has the low- est irreversibly adsorbed amount, whereas the amounts for the other samples are very similar. Because the surface area decreases with increasing loading, a slight decrease in acid- ity would be observed if these numbers were calculated in mol g1 cat [8]. These results suggest that the amphoteric in- dium oxide can be considered more basic than acidic, and that the acidity of the supported samples is due mainly to alumina.
A similar trend is observed in the FTIR spectra of ad- sorbed pyridine (Fig. 5). Only bands characteristic of pyri- dine adsorbed on Lewis acid sites (16201600 cm1 ν8a,1450 cm1 ν19b) are observed. The position and multiplicity of the ν8a band of adsorbed pyridine is related to the strength and number of the different types of Lewis acid sites [6]. Al- though a slight shift toward lower wave numbers is observed after indium oxide deposition, no great differences in the position of this band can be observed among the catalysts,meaning that the strength of the Lewis acid sites is almost always the same. Bulk indium oxide presents the smallest band and the lowest wave number for pyridine adsorption, Fig. 6. Differential heats of sulfur dioxide adsorption versus coverage on indium oxide samples supported on alumina. indicating the low acidity of this oxide. The doubled signal of the ν8a band indicates the presence of two different types of acidic centers on the alumina support. The supported in- dium samples present the same behavior, but the relative area of the second band becomes lower as the indium oxide con- tent increases, suggesting that these centers could be blocked by the indium oxide.
Fig. 6 represents the adsorption heats of SO2 on all the samples. In contrast to ammonia adsorption, marked differ- ences are observed among the different samples. Bulk in- dium oxide presents the highest adsorption heats of all the samples, again suggesting the main basic character of this oxide. A clearer idea can be obtained by observing the ir- reversibly adsorbed amounts of SO2 (Table 2). No evident relation can be established between Virr and the total indium oxide loading, but the samples with the highest In/Al ratios determined by XPS (Table 1)namely InAl-10, InAl-6, and InAl-27are those with the highest irreversibly adsorbed amounts, indicating a strong relation between surface in- dium oxide content and adsorbed amount.
The redox properties of the indium oxide materials sup- ported on alumina were studied by TPR/TPO. The hydrogen consumptions and temperatures of the maximum of the re- duction peaks are given in Table 3. The reduction profile of bulk indium oxide is represented in Fig. 7. A single and broad peak centered at 755 C, incompletely finished, is ob- tained. The total reduction of In2O3 to In0 requires 3 mol of hydrogen per mol of indium oxide. In the TPR exper- iment, the hydrogen consumption was 2.8 molH2 mol1 In2O3,indicating that almost all of the indium oxide has been re- duced. The XRD spectra (not shown) recorded after TPR ex- 426

Fig. 7. TPR profiles of indium oxide samples supported on alumina. periments show only the signal corresponding to a metallic indium phase. The supported indium samples with the high- est indium oxide loadings (InAl-27, InAl-17, and InAl-13) present the same trend (Fig. 7), but in these cases low hydro- gen consumption starting around 200 C is observed until the main consumption begins, with this reduction amount at lower temperature becoming larger as the indium oxide con- tent decreases. For sample InAl-10, the TPR profile presents the same trend, but the relative amount reduced at low tem- perature is more important, presenting a well-marked peak centered at 244 C. For InAl-6, as in the case of InAl-10, the relative amount reduced at low temperature is more impor- tant than the amount reduced at high temperature. Because the reduction peak at low temperature does not appear in the TPR profile of bulk indium oxide, this peak can hardly be attributed to a different oxidation step in the reduction from In3+ to In0. The reduction of bulk indium oxide to metallic indium seems to occur in one step [49], and the behavior ob- served for the supported oxides is generally attributed to the reduction of indium oxide particles of different sizes [37],with the smallest particles being reduced at low tempera- ture. This conclusion fits well with the dispersion suggested by the XPS data. The reduced amount at low temperature is more important for the samples with the highest In/Al ratio (InAl-10 and InAl-6) than for the samples with poorer dis- persion. In all cases, the reduced amount is nearly 100% of the indium content.
Fig. 8. TPO profiles of indium oxide samples supported on alumina.
TPO experiments were carried out on the reduced bulk indium oxide, InAl-27, InAl-17, and InAl-10. Bulk indium oxide did not show any oxygen consumption. Fig. 8 presents the TPO profiles for the three other samples. The three sam- ples present the same profile, a double peak with an onset around 110 C and the maximum around 320 C (Table 3).
The oxidation temperature is clearly lower than the reduction temperature. The amount of oxygen consumed per mol of in- dium oxide is given in Table 3. Assuming that the complete oxidation of In0 to In2O3 requires 1.5 mol of oxygen per mol of indium, we can conclude that only part of the indium has been oxidized. Nevertheless, the only detected phase after TPO is indium oxide. One experiment of TPO on InAl-17 was stopped at 220 C (before the main oxidation peaks) to see whether the first oxidation peak was due to intermediate oxidation states. The only phases found were In0 and In2O3,suggesting that, as in the case of reduction, the presence of different peaks is related to the size of the reduced particle and not to oxidation in successive steps. The similitude of InAl-27 and InAl-17 is probably due to the phenomenon of sintering of the indium in the previous TPR experiment. The oxidation peak on InAl-10 occurs at a lower temperature.
To complement the TPR/TPO experiments, the redox properties of the supported indium oxide samples with the highest loadings, as well as bulk indium oxide, were studied by TG-DSC. Because of the different experimental condi- tions (composition of reactive gases, total flow or flow path),it is not possible to compare the two techniques quantita- tively, but from a qualitative standpoint the results are simi- lar. In reduction experiments (Fig. 9), only one endothermic peak is observed, at a reduction temperature that increases with increasing indium oxide loading. The experimental and theoretical mass losses are compared in Table 4. Values close to 100% are obtained, indicating that almost all of the indium oxide has been reduced. Values slightly exceeding 100% can be assigned to the presence of a small fraction of water or hydroxide. The measured reduction heats are also summa- rized in Table 4. Because these values are given per mol of indium oxide, a constant value could be expected a pri- ori. As can be seen, the higher the indium oxide loading,the higher the measured heat, with the highest value for

A good linear relationship is obtained, suggesting that this variation of the measured heat with the loading is due to the influence of the support. At low loadings, strong interactions with the support lower the reduction heats. As in the TPR TPO experiments, no reoxidation of bulk metallic indium is observed. Parallel to the TPR reoxidation experiments,a double exothermic peak is observed in the reoxidation ex- periments performed by DSC (Fig. 11). The maximum and onset of the reoxidation peaks for the three samples are more similar than they were in the reduction process, probably due to the sintering of indium in the reduction process, leading to a more similar dispersion of the three samples. The mass gain (Table 4) suggests that the metallic indium is reversibly reoxidized. The XRD spectra after oxidation do not show any metallic phase lines.
An endothermic peak around 157 C is observed for the three samples, corresponding to the melting point of metallic indium. The peak is not well developed, because the oxida- tion occurs before it is finished. This can explain the two peaks observed in the oxidation process. The oxidation peak at low temperature is due to the oxidation of the melted in- dium. The newly generated indium oxide at this temperature is a solid that creates a layer over the rest of the metallic Fig. 10. Evolved heat in DSC reduction experiments versus indium oxide loading.

3.2. De-NOx catalytic activity
The In-based catalysts prepared on amorphous alumina were evaluated in the reduction of NOx by C2H4 in oxygen- rich atmosphere at fixed contact time and variable temper- ature in the 250550 C interval. The catalyst activity was measured in terms of NOx (NO + NO2) conversion and se- lectivity. Selectivity was expressed in terms of the compet- itiveness factor, taking into account the catalysts ability to selectively use the hydrocarbon to reduce the NOx species rather than to be oxidized by O2. The experimental results,in terms of reaction profiles of the main species involved in the de-NOx reaction, are shown in Figs. 12a12f for all of the catalysts as a function of reaction temperature. The ad- dition of a very low amount of In is sufficient to impart new catalytic activity to the alumina support. Indeed, alumina is completely unable to reduce any NOx under the same condi- tions used for studying the catalysts in the present work, and yields only a small amount of CO (about 10%) from ethene 428

N2O was not detected among the reaction products. This finding was expected, be- cause it is known that the production of large amounts of N2O in addition to N2 is a specific distinctive feature of the reduction of NOx on noble metal phases [50]. As a gen- eral trend, the onset temperature for the selective reduction of NOx was around 400 C. With the ability to detect the NO2 species separately from NO, it was possible to observe in every case a significant NO2 conversion at low tempera- tures that could be due to nitrite/nitrate accumulation over the surfaces. The subsequent decomposition of these pri- mary formed species at higher temperatures could give rise to N2 formation in some amount. The plots of the NOx con- version versus temperature did not lead to volcano-shaped curves, as are usually observed for most de-NOx catalysts.
This behavior is due to the presence of ethene even at the highest reaction temperature tested. The incomplete ethene conversion at 500 C and above can be associated with the weak oxidation properties of the In2O3 phase. This behavior can be quantified by computing the competitiveness factor,which represents the SCR selectivity (SSCR, %). During the SCR reaction, the two oxidizing species, O2 and NOx, com- pete for the small amount of ethene present; at the highest reaction temperatures, O2 prevails over NOx, and SSCR de- creases abruptly. The good selectivity of the In2O3 phases is revealed by the SSCR values, which attained 810% at the

In terms of carbon selectiv- ity, ethene was converted to CO2 for the most part, whereas only a very limited amount of CO was detected for tem- peratures around 450500 C (maximum yield, 34%). The carbon balance was very satisfactory in any case.
It is possible to compare the NOx conversions over the various In2O3-based catalysts by considering their activities at a same reaction temperature. Fig. 13 shows the percentage of NOx to N2 conversion obtained from each catalyst eval- uated at 500 C; the same trend was observed if different temperatures were taken into account. The NOx conversion increased with In2O3 loading up to 13%; from this point on,further In addition caused a decrease in conversion. The con- version of the InAl-27 sample was lower than that of the InAl-17 and InAl-13 samples.
The observed behavior suggests a key influence of the In surface aggregation on activity. Indeed, the sample with the lowest In concentration (InAl-3) is very active, and further addition of In resulted in a limited increase of the number of active In sites on the alumina support, thus generating no important variation in the de-NOx activity.
On the basis of the experimental data obtained, specific integral reaction rates (molN2 g1 cat s1) were calculated at each temperature. Moreover, from these values it is possible to express the rates in mmolN2 mol1 In s1, once the amount of In per unit mass of catalyst is known. Fig. 14 shows the trend followed by these calculated rates as a function of In loading. It is more interesting to observe the values of the rates expressed per mol of In, which show a regularly de- creasing exponential trend. This corroborates our suggestion concerning the role of In surface aggregation in de-NOx activity. The addition of a very small amount of In2O3 to alumina is sufficient to impart good activity to the sample,whereas further In2O3 addition leads to samples with lower activity. This means that only a limited amount of the indium loaded over the alumina support can play the role of active site in NOx reduction. This smaller amount could be asso- ciated with the fraction present at the surface of the In2O3 aggregates, which became larger as the In loading increased (see the XRD diffraction measurement results).
4. Conclusions
The deposition of indium oxide slightly decreases the acidic properties of alumina, but the amounts of ammonia adsorbed per m2 of catalyst surface area do not vary signif- icantly. Indium oxide deposition has a greater influence on the adsorption of acidic molecules; the adsorbed amount of SO2 is related to the indium oxide surface content, not to the total deposited amount. The irreversible amount of SO2 adsorbed is superior to the irreversible amount of NH3 ad- sorbed, suggesting the presence of stronger basic sites on the indium-loaded samples. These findings suggest that indium oxide can be considered more basic than acidic.
Indium oxide is easily reduced, at a reduction tempera- ture related to particle size. For smaller particles, the reduc- tion begins around 200 C. The reoxidation process starts at lower temperatures than the reduction process.
Balanced acidic and redox properties are indispensable for an efficient conversion of NOx, that is, high activity and selectivity (over a broad temperature window). This evidence is in agreement with the conclusions drawn by Park et al. [37] claiming a bifunctional mechanism of the In2O3/Al2O3 systems to explain their high activity for NOx reduction by propene. In this mechanism, the well-dispersed In sites activate the hydrocarbons into partially oxygenated compounds, and the acidic alumina sites readily use the oxy- genated hydrocarbons to reduce NOx.
In2O3 catalysts demonstrate good NOx reduction per- formance at high temperatures compared with other active phases, such as CuO or SnO2 [44,5153], and in this sense they resemble Ga2O3-based catalysts [9,54]. With respect to alumina-based catalysts, the hydrocarbon oxidation and NO reduction activity have a strong mutual correlation, and,moreover, the interaction between In2O3 and alumina is nec- essary. The crystalline structure of the In2O3 phase observed on the high-In-loading catalysts is not associated with high de-NOx activity, whereas small In2O3 aggregates well dis- persed over the alumina support are active and selective in NOx reduction. A balanced presence of indium and alumina sites indeed seems to be very important for achieving opti- 430
