The catalytic behaviour of iron oxide catalysts supported on magnesium oxide in the non-oxidative dehydroge- 
nation of but-1-ene to buta-l,3-diene has been studied. Under dehydrogenation conditions the magnesium ferrite 
phase of the fresh catalyst was found to be reduced to FeO in the bulk of the ferrite particles, where FeO is 
strongly stabilized by the formation of a solid solution with MgO. At the surface of the particles magnesium 
ferrite is reduced to F

O
,
.
 
In the reduced state a catalyst containing ca. 3 wt.% Fe shows a but-1-ene conver- 
sion of 26% combined with a buta-1,3-diene selectivity of 65% at 873 K. The activation energy for dehydroge- 
nation was found to be 47 kcal mol-'. 
The (unpromoted) catalyst gradually deactivates owing to carbon deposition. Under dehydrogenation condi- 
tions the catalyst surface is completely covered by a layer of amorphous carbon within 20 h. 
Industrially, ethylbenzene is catalytically dehydrogenated 
over an unsupported alkali-metal-promoted iron oxide cata- 
lyst in the presence of steam.' But-1-ene can be dehydroge- 
nated to buta-1,3-diene using the same ~ a t a l y s t . ~ . ~  
Lee has 
published a review on the research performed in the field of 
ethylbenzene dehydrogenation with particular reference to 
unsupported alkali-metal-promoted iron oxide.4 
Major problems arising with this type of catalyst are 
caused by potassium migration due to temperature gradients, 
and reduction of the iron oxide phase under process condi- 
tions.'-' Owing to the endothermic character of the dehydro- 
genation process, temperature gradients are present in the 
catalyst bed, both in radial direction within the individual 
catalyst bodies and lengthwise in the catalyst bed. Potassium 
migrates to the colder centre within the catalyst pellets and to 
the colder end of the catalyst bed. This leads to a local pot- 
assium depletion, causing an increase in porosity coupled 
with a decrease in mechanical strength and a less effective 
suppression of catalyst coking. Reduction of the iron oxide 
phase to Fe304 
causes a lattice transformation from a corun- 
dum structure to a spinel structure. Since iron oxide is the 
bulk material, this transformation leads to a degradation of 
mechanical strength and, eventually, to disintegration of the 
catalyst bodies. The disintegration causes a large pressure 
drop over the reactor, which may be unfavourable for high 
styrene selectivity and yield. These problems are expected to 
be obviated by the use of finely divided iron oxide on a 
support, ensuring the retention of mechanical strength during 
operation. 
To meet with the problems of the present bulk iron oxide 
dehydrogenation catalyst, an (alkali-metal-promoted) iron 
oxide catalyst supported on magnesium oxide has been devel- 
oped. The preparation and characterization of iron oxide 
supported on magnesium oxide have been reported else- 
where.'-' ' 
The catalyst is prepared by incipient-wetness 
impregnation of preshaped magnesium oxide support bodies 
with organometallic complexes. Upon decomposition of the 
iron precursors, highly dispersed magnesium ferrite particles 
supported on magnesium oxide are formed. In order to deter- 
mine the effect of the potassium promoter on the supported

unpromoted supported iron oxide catalysts in the dehydroge- 
nation is dealt with in this paper. Kearby13*14 
has reported 
on catalysts supported on powder magnesium oxide earlier. 
However, these catalysts were not autoregenerative in the 
presence of steam and were strongly deactivated within the 
first few hours of operation, in spite of the presence of the 
potassium promoter. 
Dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene and but- 
1-ene are com- 
parable 
Based on this comparability and on the 
experimentally less complicated procedure involved with the 
analysis of the reaction products, dehydrogenation of but- 1- 
ene to buta-1,3-diene is preferred as a test reaction. First, the 
activity and selectivity of the catalysts as a function of the 
time on stream were measured. Phase changes within the 
catalysts, which are expected to occur during dehydroge- 
n a t i ~ n , ~ . ~  
have been examined using magnetic measurements 
and X-ray diffraction. Several authors have reported the 
growth of carbon on unpromoted iron oxides in butene 
atmospheres.' ',l 
After being used in the dehydrogenation, 
the catalysts were therefore investigated for carbon deposi- 
tion using temperature-programmed oxidation (TPO). Ther- 
modynamic calculations were made predicting growth or 
gasification of carbon as a function of the pressure, the tem- 
perature, and the composition of the gas phase. Subsequently, 
the activation energy and the pre-exponential factors of fresh 
and deactivated catalysts were established. 
Experimental 
Catalyst Preparation 
Unpromoted iron oxide catalysts supported on magnesium 
oxide were prepared by incipient-wetness impregnation of 
preshaped magnesium oxide support bodies (Engelhard, 
Mg-0601 T 1/8") using poorly crystallizing complexes.' Pure 
ammonium iron(r1r) citrate (Bakergrade) and ammonium 
iron(m) EDTA (Merck, Fotopur) were used. After impregna- 
tion the catalysts were dried in air first at room temperature 
and next at 393 K, at both temperatures for 16-24 h. Finally, 
the catalysts were calcined in air at 973 K for 24 h to decom- 
pose the organometallic precursors. The actual iron loading

of a catalyst, as determined by titration, is expressed as the 
calculated weight percentage metallic iron on the magnesium 
oxide support. For various tests the catalyst bodies were frag- 
mented into particles of sizes between 0.50 and 0.85 mm. 
But-1-ene Dehydrogenation Activity Testing 
The activity of the catalysts for the dehydrogenation of but-l- 
ene was determined with an automated flow apparatus, 
which is shown schematically in Fig. 1. The catalyst (ca. 1 g) 
was packed into a quartz fixed-bed flow reactor with an 
internal diameter of ca. 8 mm. The apparatus was equipped 
with facilities to provide but- 1-ene, nitrogen, hydrogen and 
oxygen. The gases were used without further purification. 
But-1-ene (99.9% pure) was obtained from Phillips Pet- 
roleum, while other gases were provided by Hoekloos. For 
the dehydrogenation experiments a mixture of 5 vol.% but-l- 
ene and 30 vol.% water vapour in 65 vol.% nitrogen at atmo- 
spheric pressure was used, which is equivalent to a so-called 
steam : 
oil ratio of 6.0 (mol/mol). Water vapour was intro- 
duced using a saturator containing distilled water, which was 
held at 343 K using a thermostat. To prevent condensation o
f
 
water vapour, the tubing was heated at 413 K. Table 1 shows 
the typical test conditions. The feed was led upstream 
through the catalyst bed. The reactor temperature was con- 
trolled using an Eurotherm 820 temperature controller. The 
actual temperature was measured in the centre just below the 
catalyst bed. 
The reactor feed and emuent were analysed on-line by two 
gas chromatographs. For this purpose samples were taken 
regularly using three heated sample valves. As well as buta- 
1,3-diene, methane, ethane, ethene, propene and carbon 
dioxide were formed. No carbon monoxide was detected. 
Furthermore, but-1-ene was rapidly isomerized to (E)- and 
(Z)-but-2-ene. Carbon dioxide was separated from the hydro-

carbons on a Porapack Q column (1/8”, 2.5 m) at 433 K 
using helium as the carrier gas (Hewlett-Packard 5710 gas 
chromatograph). CO, was detected using a thermal conduc- 
tivity detector (TCD). Other products and but-1-ene were 
separated using a capillary A1,03/KC1 plot column at 353 K 
using nitrogen as a carrier gas (Packard 427 gas 
chromatograph). For detection a flame-ionization detector 
(FID) was used. Since the capillary column used is not resist- 
ant to water vapour, samples were dried using a Perma Pure 
minidryer. Gas chromatograms were integrated using two 
computing integrators (CI-lOB, Milton Roy) and data were 
collected on a 20 MB hard disk. Temperature control, sam- 
pling and data processing were performed using an IBM-AT 
compatible computer. 
Since but-1-ene rapidly isomerized to (E)- and (Z)-but-2- 
ene, and since the dehydrogenations of but-1-ene and but-2- 
enes are ~omparable,’~ 
(E)- and (Z)-but-2-ene are not con- 
sidered as products, but as reactants together with but-1-ene. 
For the calculations, the three components are therefore 
added and referred to as ‘butenes’. Owing to the pressure 
drop over the reactor varying with the temperature and a 
slightly unstable water-vapour concentration inherent to the 
use of a saturator, the analysis of the feed could not be used 
for calculations of conversion, selectivity and yield. The fol- 
lowing definitions for the conversion, the selectivity to 
product (i), and the yield of product (i) have therefore been 
used :

amount 
of

butene in the feed expressed in mol dmP3. 
In these calcu- 
lations carbon deposited on the catalyst is not considered. 
Unless specified otherwise, kinetic data are always expressed 
per gram of catalyst.

ther Characterization 
Techniques 
X-Ray diffraction measurements were performed in a Philips 
powder diffractometer mounted on a Philips PW 1140 X-ray 
generator with Fe-Ka,,, radiation (A 
= 1.937 
35 A). 
High-field magnetic measurements were performed using a 
modification of the Weiss extraction technique, as described 
by Selwood.'7 The apparatus has been described elsewhere.I8 
A reactor was constructed which allowed for the pretreat- 
ment of a catalyst in the but-1-ene dehydrogenation appar- 
atus, prior to the magnetization measurements in the 
modified Weiss extraction apparatus, without intermediate 
exposure to air. After pretreatment in the but-1-ene-steam 
feed the reactor was purged with nitrogen at 673 K. Thermo- 
magnetic analyses (TMA) were performed at a field strength 
of 0.39 MA m-l in helium. Before use, the helium was puri- 
fied over activated carbon at liquid-nitrogen temperature. 
The amount of carbon deposited on a catalyst was deter- 
mined using TPO. Carbon was oxidized in a flow of 10% 
oxygen in helium. The oxygen consumption was determined 
as a function of the temperature using a thermal-conductivity 
detector. Ca. 500 mg of catalyst were oxidized. The tem- 
perature was raised linearly at a rate of 0.11 K s-'. CO, 
formed during the oxidation was frozen out using a cold trap 
(pentanedpentane, , 
143 K). 
Catalysts were also characterized using transmission elec- 
tron microscopy (Philips EM420).

Results and Discussion 
Activity and Selectivity of the Catalysts 
Non-oxidative dehydrogenation catalysts are commonly 
operated at temperatures between 850 and 900 K. To deter- 
mine the catalytic behaviour of the supported iron oxide 
catalyst as a function of time, the catalysts were exposed to 
dehydrogenation conditions isothermally at 873 K. The 
butene dehydrogenation activity of an unpromoted 1.0 wt.% 
Fe/MgO catalyst (ex citrate) at this temperature during the 
first 20 h is shown in Fig. 2. As can be seen, the yield and 
especially the selectivity of buta-1,3-diene strongly increase 
during the first hour, whereas the conversion remains con- 
stant. At the same time the colour of the catalyst changes 
from beige to grey. An optimum in the catalyst performance 
is reached after 2 h. Beyond this period, the conversion and 
the selectivity slowly decrease. In Fig. 3 the product distribu- 
tion is shown as percentage yield. Initially, a considerable 
amount of CO, is produced as well as buta-1,3-diene, other 
products being methane, ethene and propene. Ethane is pro-

duced only in extremely small amounts. The initially high 
CO, yield of 9% strongly diminishes with time. After ca. 12 h 
CO, is no longer detected. The formation of such large 
amounts of CO, points to a reduction of the catalyst by 
hydrocarbons during the first few hours of operation. This is 
consistent with the change in colour. 
For catalysts with higher iron loadings the dehydroge- 
nation activity shows identical behaviour. However, a cata- 
lyst containing more iron requires a longer period of time to 
become active and selective. This agrees with what is 
expected if the initial increase in selectivity and yield is 
caused by reduction of the catalysts. Fig. 4 shows the buta-1, 
3-diene yields at 873 K for catalysts with different iron load- 
ings ranging from 1-3 wt.% Fe. Remarkably, after the initial 
increase of the yield, all catalysts reach an equal maximum 
yield of buta-1,3-diene of ca. 17%, in spite of the difference in 
free surface area of the magnesium ferrite." As dehydroge- 
nation proceeds, the catalyst with only 1.0 wt.% Fe is deacti- 
vated more rapidly than the catalyst with 3.1 wt.% Fe. 
The results of Fig. 4 show that the buta-1,3-diene yield of 
the catalysts does not depend significantly on the iron

loading of the magnesium oxide. Since the free surface area of 
the active component may also not vary significantly with the 
loading it is important to establish the free surface area of the 
active component. The free surface area of the magnesium 
ferrite phase was calculated from the amount of oxygen taken 
up with surface oxidation of the previously reduced cata- 
lysts." A reliable assessment of the free surface area of the 
magnesium ferrite calls for a complete reduction of the mag- 
nesium ferrite to iron(@. Earlier, the iron-containing phase 
of 
the 
thus 
reduced 
catalyst 
was 
described 
as 
(FeOj, . (MgO),-,. The thus obtained free surface area of 
the magnesium ferrite phase of the catalyst containing 1.0 
wt.% Fe is 1.12 m2 per gram of catalyst, while that for the 
catalyst containing 3.1 wt.% Fe is 3.22 m2 
g-'. lo 
Apparently, the activity of the catalyst does not depend 
simply on the free surface area o
f
 the magnesium ferrite. It 
seems logical that intraparticle transport of reactants could 
account for the lack of a relation between catalyst activity 
and the free surface area of the magnesium ferrite. However, 
the effectiveness factor q, as calculated using the Thiele 
modulus 4, is practically 
The activity is therefore 
not influenced by internal diffusion phenomena. The lack of a 
relation between catalyst activity and the free surface area of 
the magnesium ferrite could, however, be explained by the 
fact that the catalyst is in a reduced state, which was con- 
cluded from the initially high CO, production rate. In that 
case, the surface area of the active phase in the reduced cata- 
lyst should not be corresponding with the free surface area of 
the magnesium ferrite. Accordingly, the extent of reduction of 
the catalyst under dehydrogenation conditions should be dif- 
ferent from the above mentioned (FeO), - (MgO), -, 
phase. 
This is conceivable, as in earlier experiments the FeO has 
appeared to disproportionate to Fe,O, and metallic iron 
upon severe thermal treatment.' The nature of the active 
phase of the catalyst after dehydrogenation of but- 1-ene will 
be investigated using X-ray diffraction and thermomagnetic 
analysis. 
Reduction of the Catalyst during Debydrogenation 
X R D  
To establish the nature of the reduced state of the catalyst 
under dehydrogenation conditions, a 4.4 wt.% Fe/MgO cata- 
lyst (ex citratej was studied with X-ray diffraction both before 
and after use in the dehydrogenation of but-1-ene. The dif- 
fractograms are shown in Fig. 5. As can be seen in Fig. 5(a) 
the iron oxide in the fresh calcined supported catalyst is 
present as magnesium ferrite. After use in the dehydroge-

nation, the magnesium ferrite diffractions disappeared, con- 
firming the assumption that the catalyst has been reduced. 
Since no other iron diffractions appeared in the diffractogram 
of Fig. 5(bj, it is assumed that the magnesium ferrite is 
reduced to FeO, which is stabilized by the MgO support. The 
diffractions of FeO coincide with those of MgO owing to the 
similarity of the cell parameters. 
The lack of observable FeO diffractions prohibits a final 
assessment of the reduced state. Fe or Fe,O, may also result 
upon reduction. If Fe or Fe,O, is present as small or non- 
crystalline particles, it will not show up in the X-ray diffrac- 
tion pattern. Using magnetic measurements, however, the 
presence of different iron species can be more accurately 
established. 
T M A  
A 5.6 wt.% Fe/MgO catalyst was studied with high-field 
magnetic measurements using a modified Weiss extraction 
technique before and after use under dehydrogenation condi- 
tions. For this purpose ca. 1 g of catalyst was treated in a 
flow of 5 vol.% but-1-ene and 30 vol.% water in nitrogen at 
873 K for 4 h. Subsequently, the catalyst was cooled to 673 K 
and purged with nitrogen for 1 h to remove the feed. Next, 
the catalyst was cooled to room temperature in nitrogen. The 
reactor was transferred to the Weiss extraction apparatus 
without intermediate exposure to air, after which a TMA was 
performed in helium. The TMA diagram of the fresh catalyst 
is shown in Fig. qa).

 the catalyst is plotted against the temperature. The 
profile has been recorded first at a linearly increasing tem- 
perature and subsequently at a linearly decreasing tem- 
perature. In the figures also the TMA profile of the empty 
reactor is shown, indicated by the solid line. The fresh cata- 
lyst in Fig. 6(a) 
shows a magnetization of 4050 a.u. at 298 K 
relative to the empty reactor. The magnetization decreases 
strongly with increasing temperature. The profile shows a 
Curie temperature, T,, of 595 K, which is characteristic of 
MgFe204. From the fact that the profiles measured under 
increasing and decreasing temperature conditions are identi- 
cal, it can be concluded that the fresh catalyst is thermostable 
at least up to 900 K. Identical magnetic behaviour has been 
observed earlier.8y9 
After use of the catalyst in the dehydrogenation, the TMA 
profile of the catalyst changes, as can be seen from Fig. qb). 
At 298 K the magnetization is only 2050 a.u. relative to the 
empty reactor and, furthermore, the catalyst has T, = 790 K. 
This Curie temperature can be attributed to the presence of 
Fe304. Pure Fe30, has T, = 848 K. However, the Curie 
temperature of the species within the used catalyst is lowered 
by the presence of some Mg2 
+ ions substitutionally dissolved 
in the Fe304 lattice.' The profile measured at decreasing 
temperature runs slightly below that measured at increasing 
temperature. The lower magnetization can be attributed to 
the fact that at high temperatures some water is released from 
the magnesium oxide support, which causes slight reoxida- 
tion of the Fe304 
to antiferromagnetic a-Fe203 
. Comparing 
the saturation magnetizations of bulk MgFe,04 and Fe304 
at room temperature, 110 and 480 G, respectively,' it 
becomes evident that the MgFe,O, in the catalyst was not 
reduced to Fe,O, entirely. From the magnetizations mea- 
sured at room temperature before and after use in the dehy- 
drogenation, it can be calculated that only 17 wt.% of the 
MgFe20, is reduced to Fe30, under hydrogenation condi- 
tions at 873 K. Evidently, the remaining 83 wt.% of the mag- 
nesium ferrite was reduced to antiferromagnetic FeO 
dissolved in the magnesium oxide support. This is in agree- 
ment with earlier  observation^.^ 
To determine whether the reduction of the magnesium 
ferrite is indeed responsible for the initial increase of selec- 
tivity and yield of buta-1,3-diene, the 1.0 wt.% Fe/MgO cata- 
lyst was subjected to a reduction pretreatment after which the 
dehydrogenation activity was measured. The catalyst was 
pre-reduced in a nitrogen gas flow containing 60 vol.% H, 
and 30 vol.% H 2 0  
at 873 K for 4 h. In Fig. 7 the catalyst 
activity is shown after the reduction pretreatment. Now, the

values without showing any signs of increasing yield and 
selectivity. As was concluded from the initially high CO, 
yield during the dehydrogenation of a 5 vol.% but-1-ene and 
30 vol.% water in nitrogen flow, the catalyst is reduced not 
only by the hydrogen formed in the dehydrogenation, but 
also by the hydrocarbons present in the gas phase. If the 
reduction were brought about by hydrogen alone, then the 
reduction has to proceed already in a 5 vol.% H, and 30 
vol.% H 2 0  
in N, gas flow at 873 K. However, such a treat- 
ment does not affect the 1.0 wt.% Fe/MgO catalyst at all. It 
can therefore be concluded that the initial stabilization period 
can be ascribed to the reduction of the magnesium ferrite 
phase in the MgO-supported catalyst to Fe304 and FeO by 
the hydrocarbons in the feed. Evidently, the reduced state is 
more active and selective to buta-1,3-diene than the oxidized 
state of the catalyst. 
Carbon Deposition within the Catalysts 
After the reduction pretreatment a gradual deactivation of 
the catalyst is observed. When in Fig. 8 the activity of a 0.9 
wt.% Fe/MgO catalyst (ex EDTA) is considered on a longer 
timescale than has been done thus far, it can be seen that the 
deactivation is practically complete within the first 20 h. After 
this period, the conversion and yield of buta-1,3-diene remain 
constant at ca. 8 and 4%, respectively. The buta-1,3-diene 
selectivity decreases further slowly from ca. 60% to 54%. At 
this stage the performance of the catalyst is comparable with 
that of the bare magnesium oxide support. Several authors 
have reported the formation of carbon on unpromoted iron 
oxide in butene atmospheres.' 5 * 1  Therefore, the deactivation 
is expected to be caused by carbon deposition. Carbon depo- 
sition or coking can lead to both pore blocking and covering 
of sites that are active for the dehydrogenation.20 
Fig. 9 shows transmission electron micrographs of the 0.9 
wt.% Fe/MgO catalyst after 200 h of dehydrogenation at 873 
K. As expected, both the magnesium oxide support and the 
reduced magnesium ferrite particles have been encapsulated 
by a layer of carbon after dehydrogenation for 200 h. In the 
micrograph on the left-hand side the small encapsulated 
ferrite particles are clearly visible. In the micrograph on the 
right-hand side the carbon layer on the magnesium oxide 
support is shown. According to these micrographs, the 
average thickness of the carbon layer on both the support 
and the ferrite particles is ca. 100 A. 
To determine the amount of carbon deposited under dehy- 
drogenation conditions at 873 K for 20 h, the catalysts were

Fig. 9 Transmission electron micrographs of a 0.9 wt.% Fe/MgO catalyst (ex EDTA) after 200 h of dehydrogenation at 873 K. The arrows 
indicate the carbon layers 
analysed afterwards using TPO. For this purpose the coked 
catalysts were treated in a flow of 10% 0, in He, while the 
temperature was raised linearly. Oxidation of the coke to 
CO, occurred at ca. 673 K. It has been determined that the 
amount of oxygen required for reoxidation of the catalyst 
during TPO was negligible compared with the amount 
required for the oxidation of the deposited carbon. The 
amount of carbon formed during 20 h of dehydrogenation is 
plotted against the catalyst loading in Fig. 10. As can be seen, 
the bare magnesium oxide support after 20 h showed ca. 1 
wt.% of carbon, which is indicated at an iron loading of 0 
wt.% in Fig. 10. When the support was loaded with iron, ca. 
1.5-2 wt.% carbon was found after 20 h of dehydrogenation.

expressed as molar water : 
but-1-ene ratios, are indicated as: A, 6; B, 
8.2; C, 10 
The amount of carbon deposited seems to be more or less 
independent of the catalyst loading. The rather low values of 
the carbon content found for the catalysts containing ca. 3 
wt.% Fe cannot be readily accounted for. For the catalyst 
containing 0.9 wt.% Fe (ex EDTA), the deactivation of which 
is shown in Fig. 8, a carbon content of no less than 15 wt.% 
is found after 200 h of dehydrogenation. From the carbon 
content and the B.E.T. surface area of this catalyst of ca. 9 m2 
g- 
it is calculated that the average carbon layer thickness 
must have been 83 A after 200 h of dehydrogenation. This 
value is in good agreement with the value of 100 A derived 
from the electron micrographs shown in Fig. 9. 
Evidently, ca. 2 wt.% carbon is sufficient to deactivate a 
catalyst containing 1.0 wt.% Fe almost completely. In Fig. 4 
it was already shown that after an initial increase of the yield 
a catalyst containing only 1.0 wt.% Fe shows the same activ- 
ity as a catalyst containing 2.1 or 3.1 wt.% Fe, but is deacti- 
vated more rapidly. This can be understood by the fact that 
the 2.1 and 3.1 wt.% Fe/MgO catalysts may contain larger 
active surface areas and therefore do not show signs of deac- 
tivation due to coking as fast as a catalyst containing only 1.0 
wt.% Fe. The low carbon content of the 3.1 wt.% Fe/MgO 
catalyst in Fig. 10 is an additional reason for the lower rate of 
deactivation compared with the catalysts with 1.0 and 2.1 
wt.% Fe (ex citrate) in Fig. 4. 
Thermodynamic Carbondeposition 
Boundaries 
Several authors working in the field of catalyst research have 
reported 
on the deposition and the gasification of 
carbon.15*'6*21*22 
Whether carbon deposition or gasification 
occurred, it was always determined empirically, and not pre- 
dicted thermodynamically. Cairns et al.23924 
and Broers and 
Treijtel,,' 
however, both working in the field of fuel-cell 
research, published a simplified model to calculate thermody- 
namic equilibria in the ternary carbon-hydrogen-oxygen 
system. With this model so-called carbon-deposition bound- 
aries (c.d.b.) can be calculated, which indicate the boundary 
in the C-H-0 system between carbon deposition and gasifi- 
cation. According to this model, the only stable species to be 
considered in the temperature range between 400 and 1500 K 
and pressures of the order of 1 atm are at equilibrium: C 
(graphite), H,, CO,, H,O, CO and CH,. Since it is a ther- 
modynamic model, kinetic effects are not taken into account. 
In principle, the c.d.b. follows from the fact that the two- 
phase system is fixed uniquely when, at given T and total 
pressure P, the remaining degree of freedom is specified. For 
this purpose Cairns et

From these values a c.d.b. can be constructed in a triangular 
C-H-0 diagram for any given temperature and pressure. In 
Fig. 11 the c.d.b.s for a set of temperatures in the range 70CL 
10oO K calculated for a total pressure of carbon, hydrogen or 
oxygen containing gases, PCHO, 
of 0.35 atm are shown. Above 
a c.d.b., graphite will be formed, whereas below a c.d.b. 
graphite will be gasified. In Fig. 11 the but-1-ene dehydroge- 
nation conditions as applied here (molar water : 
but-1-ene 
ratio = 6) are indicated by the point A, situated below the 
c.d.b. at 900 and above the one at 873 K. From this triangu- 
lar diagram it can therefore be deduced that carbon deposi- 
tion is indeed thermodynamically expected at 873 K at the 
water : 
but-1-ene molar ratio of 6 applied here. 
Kinetic Parameters of the Catalysts 
Thus, far, the unpromoted iron oxide catalysts supported on 
magnesium oxide have been studied under dehydrogenation 
conditions isothermally at 873 K. It also is very important to 
establish kinetic parameters of the unpromoted catalysts, 
such as the activation energy for dehydrogenation. The influ- 
ence of an alkali-metal promoter on the supported catalyst 
can be established more quantitatively later if the kinetic 
parameters of the unpromoted catalysts are known. However, 
a reliable determination of the activation energy requires that 
the catalyst is not deactivated during the measurements. This 
implies that carbon deposition should not occur, in contrast 
to what we have seen thus far. In Fig. 11 it can be seen that 
when the water : 
but-1-ene molar ratio is raised (shifting from 
point A to C), the dehydrogenation conditions shift well 
below the carbon deposition boundary at 873 K and even 
below that at 700 K. Consequently, at higher water vapour 
pressures no carbon deposition is expected to occur. To 
check the effect of water vapour on the deposition of carbon, 
the dehydrogenation activity of a 1.0 wt.% Fe/MgO catalyst 
was determined as a function of time for feeds with different 
molar water : 
but-1-ene ratios. The results are represented in 
Fig. 12. The logarithm of the reaction rate is plotted against 
the time on stream. The reaction rate R is defined as 
YPbut-l-ene 
z-', where Y is the buta-1,3-diene yield, Pbut-l-ene 
is the partial pressure of but-1-ene in the feed and z is the 
residence time in the catalyst bed. As was shown above, the 
catalysts are rapidly deactivated in 5 vol.% but-1-en-30 
vol.% water (molar ratio = 
6). Lowering the but-1-ene con- 
centration to 3.64 vol.% (molar ratio = 8.2) results in a 
slower deactivation. The effect is even more evident for 3 
vol.% but-1-ene (molar ratio = 10). Additionally, the amount 
of carbon deposited after 20 h of dehydrogenation was deter- 
mined using TPO. The carbon content is plotted against the 
but-1-ene concentration in the feed for the 1.0 wt.% Fe/MgO 
catalyst in Fig. 13. Agreeing with the lower rate of deactiva- 
tion, a higher water : 
but-1-ene ratio clearly leads to lower 
carbon deposition rates. Lowering the but-1-ene concentra- 
tion even further should lead to total cessation of carbon 
deposition. However, using too high water : 
but-1-ene ratios 
may cause the catalyst not to become reduced. Below the cal- 
culated c.d.b. some carbon is still found. This is attributed to 
the fact that in the calculations graphite is considered, and no 
other types of (more amorphous) carbon of a different ther-

. 
Because of the lower deactivation rate, a mixture of 3.64 
vol.% but-1-ene and 30 vol.% water in nitrogen has been 
used for the determination of the activation energy. To estab- 
lish the activation energy the buta-1,3-diene yield was deter- 
mined, while the reactor temperature was varied. To avoid 
the initial stabilization period, the catalyst was pre-reduced in 
a flow of 60 vol.% hydrogen and 30 vol.% water in nitrogen 
at 873 K. To establish whether catalyst deactivation 
occurred, the activity at each temperature has been measured 
twice. Fig. 14 shows a typical Arrhenius plot of a catalyst 
containing 1.0 wt.% Fe (ex citrate). No systematic deactiva- 
tion is observed between two measurements at the same tem- 
perature. The activation energy was calculated from the 
differential part of the plot, i.e. at yields <5%. The activation 
energy thus found is ca. 47 kcal mo1-'. Table 2 gives the 
activation energies and the pre-exponential factors for a few 
catalysts as well as the free magnesium ferrite surface areas as 
determined using selective oxygen chemisorption. 
lo The acti- 
vation energy is essentially the same for catalysts containing 
1.0 wt.% Fe and 3.1 wt.% Fe. The activation energy is also 
independent of the type of precursor used in the preparation 
of the catalysts. The usual slight scattering of the activation 
energies is reflected in the values calculated for the pre- 
exponential factor. Therefore, it is preferable that the pre- 
exponential factors of different catalysts are calculated using

The pre-exponential factors of 
the supported catalysts listed in Table 2 were therefore calcu- 
lated using 46.5 kcal mol- ' 
as the average activation energy. 
The value for the pre-exponential factor of 25.4, thus found 
for the catalyst containing 1.0 wt.% Fe, is slightly lower than 
that found for the 3.1 wt.% Fe/MgO catalyst, which is quan- 
titatively in accordance with the lower value of the free 
surface area of the magnesium ferrite in the 1 wt.% Fe/MgO 
catalyst. However, a larger difference in In k,, viz. ca. 1, 
would be expected based on the difference in the magnesium 
ferrite free surface areas. The discrepancy can be explained by 
the fact that the active state does not comprise the magne- 
sium ferrite itself, but its reduced state with a different free 
surface area, as explained above. Both catalysts containing 
cu. 3 wt.% Fe show identical pre-exponential factors. The 
bare MgO support exhibits a considerably higher activation 
energy of 64.6 kcal mol-'. The support shows much lower 
dehydrogenation activity and selectivity to buta- 
1,3-diene 
than the supported iron oxide catalysts. The high value of 
In k,, determined using E, = 
64.6 kcal mol-', 
can be 
explained by the different activation energy for the MgO 
support and should therefore not be compared with the value 
of in k, for the iron oxide catalysts. 
As discussed above, the unpromoted catalysts are strongly 
deactivated by carbon deposition during the first 20 h in a 
feed with a water : 
but-1-ene molar ratio of 6. The activation 
energy and pre-exponential factor of the catalysts were deter- 
mined both after 20 h and after 200 h of use in the dehydro- 
genation at 873 K. These kinetic parameters have been 
obtained at a steam : 
oil ratio of 8.2 to allow for comparison 
with the fresh catalysts. Table 3 shows the kinetic data for the 
fresh and deactivated catalyst containing 1.0 wt.% Fe. After 
20 h the activation energy decreased from 46.5 to 40.9 kcal 
mol- '; 
In k, also strongly decreased to only 21.1. After 200 h 
the activation energy decreased only slightly further to 39.3

of the 1.0 wt.% Fe/MgO catalyst after 200 h is shown in Fig. 
14. As has been mentioned above, the catalytic performance 
of the 1.0 wt.% Fe/MgO catalyst after 200 h of dehydrage- 
nation is about equal to that of the coked magnesium oxide 
support. To determine whether the value of CQ. 40 kcal mol- 
is characteristic for dehydration over a coked surface, the 
activation energy of the coked MgO support was also deter- 
mined. After 3 h as well as after 20 h of coking of the support, 
an activation energy of ca. 51 kcal mol-' was found. The 
difference suggests that the nature of the carbon deposited on 
magnesium oxide is different from that deposited onto the 
supported iron oxide particles. 
Conclusions 
Iron oxide catalysts supported on magnesium oxide showed 
activity in the dehydrogenation of but-1-ene to buta-1,3- 
diene. At 873 K a maximum butadiene yield of ca. 17 vol.% is 
reached at a buta-1,3-diene selectivity of cu. 65%. Under 
dehydrogenation conditions the catalysts are reduced, which 
causes a colour change from beige to grey. The iron oxide 
present as magnesium ferrite in a fresh catalyst is reduced 
mainly to FeO. However, a considerable part of the iron is 
present as Fe,O, after dehydrogenation. 
MgO can have a stabilizing effect on FeO.' Accordingly, it 
has been demonstrated earlier that in a 10% HJAr flow at 
633 K magnesium ferrite in a magnesia-supported iron oxide 
catalyst is reduced to a solid solution of FeO in MgO of the 
type (FeO), . (MgO),-,.' 
During a TMA on the reduced 
catalyst in helium, it has nevertheless been found that a small 
part of the FeO, likely located at the surface of the 
(FeO), * (MgO),-, particles, is less stabilized by MgO. This 
results in the partial disproportionation of the less stabilized 
FeO to Fe,O, and metallic iron above 720 K. In the experi- 
ments described in this paper, which have been performed in 
a but-1-ene : 
steam flow at 873 K, the magnesium ferrite will 
also be reduced to FeO that is dissolved in magnesium oxide. 
However, the FeO at the surface of the particles, that is less 
stabilized by MgO, will immediately disproportionate to 
Fe,O, and Fe under the experimental conditions, i.e. at 873 
K. The metallic iron then formed is reoxidized to Fe304 
at 
the same time owing to the presence of butene, hydrogen and 
large amounts of steam. As FeO reacts to form Fe30, on the 
surface of the particles, the Fe,O, phase thus formed, evi- 
dently, is responsible for the higher activity towards buta-1,3- 
diene compared to the oxidized state of the catalyst, as con- 
firmed by Lee.4 Assigning Fe,O, as the active phase also 
explains the lack of a relation between the catalyst activity 
and the initial free surface area of the magnesium ferrite. 
Reduction of the iron species in the catalyst is not only 
driven by hydrogen produced in the dehydrogenation reac- 
tion, as is generally con~idered,~,~.~ 
but is also caused by the 
presence of hydrocarbons in the feed. 
The catalyst that has not been promoted with alkali metal, 
shows deactivation due to carbon deposition. During the first

20 h of dehydrogenation, the catalyst surface is covered by a 
thin layer of carbon, leading to complete deactivation. At 
that stage the catalyst contains ca. 2 wt.% of carbon. Beyond 
this period of time the carbon layer grows and reaches a 
thickness of ca. 100 8, after 200 h of dehydrogenation. From 
the deposition of carbon on the bare support and from the 
linear rate of deactivation during the first 20 h, it can be con- 
cluded that carbon is not present as filamentary carbon. Fila- 
mentary carbon should have to be formed via the so-called 
carbide cycle mechanism, i.e. via a metastable iron carbide 
phase.l6V2l 
Then the bare support would hardly contain any 
deposited carbon and the amount of carbon would be 
expected to increase strongly with the iron content of the 
catalyst. More importantly, reduction of the magnesium 
ferrite to metallic iron would be required for the formation of 
a metastable iron carbide. According to the results of the 
magnetic measurements, metastable iron carbides have not 
been formed. The catalyst is reduced only to Fe,O, and a 
solid solution of FeO in MgO. Under the dehydrogenation 
conditions used here, poorly crystallized carbon deposits are 
formed covering the catalyst surface, as reported by 
Buyanov.” The electron micrographs and the observed deac- 
tivation confirm this. The facts that the amount of coke 
deposited seems not to be dependent on the catalyst loading 
and the magnesium oxide also contains considerable 
amounts of carbon suggest that the coke deposition observed 
here is not a catalytic but a thermal process. 
Under conditions where deactivation is minimized, an acti- 
vation energy for dehydrogenation to buta-1,3-diene of ca. 47 
kcal mol- was found. After prolonged deactivation the acti- 
vation energy decreased to ca. 40 kcal mol-’. The MgO 
support material initially shows a high activation energy of 
65 kcal mol- ’. After coking the activation energy decreased 
to ca. 51 kcal mol-’. The difference between the value for 
coked MgO and the value for the coked iron oxide catalyst 
suggests that that the carbon deposited on both materials is 
of a different nature.
