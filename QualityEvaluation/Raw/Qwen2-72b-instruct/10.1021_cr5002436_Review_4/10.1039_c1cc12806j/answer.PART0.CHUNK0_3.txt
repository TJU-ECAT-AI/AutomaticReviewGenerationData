[1] "Metal-free ordered mesoporous carbons were demonstrated to be robust catalysts for direct dehydrogenation of propane to propylene, in the absence of any auxiliary steam, exhibiting high activity and selectivity, as well as long catalytic stability, in comparison with nanostructured carbons."
[2] "The presence of surface carbonyl groups is responsible for the dehydrogenation activity."
[3] "The large and well-ordered porosity of mesoporous carbon catalysts should also be beneficial for mass transport in catalytic reaction, exhibiting long time stability."
[4] "The stable propylene yield higher than 38%, together with the steady propylene selectivity of approximately 88% during reaction of 100 h reported here, is a promising indication for industrial applications, taking into account the absence of auxiliary steam and the subsequent energy savings."

1.Ordered mesoporous carbons, without any metal, have been shown to be robust catalysts for the direct dehydrogenation of propane to propylene, without the need for auxiliary steam. They exhibit high activity, selectivity, and long-term stability, outperforming nanostructured carbons. The presence of surface carbonyl groups is crucial for the dehydrogenation activity. The large and well-ordered porosity of mesoporous carbon catalysts is beneficial for mass transport in catalytic reactions, leading to long-term stability. The stable propylene yield of over 38% and the steady propylene selectivity of about 88% over 100 hours of reaction are promising for industrial applications, especially considering the absence of auxiliary steam and the resulting energy savings.

1.有序介孔碳材料，不含任何金属，已被证明是丙烷直接脱氢制丙烯的坚固催化剂，无需辅助蒸汽。它们表现出高活性、选择性和长期稳定性，优于纳米结构碳。表面羰基的存在对脱氢活性至关重要。有序介孔碳催化剂的大孔隙和良好的孔隙有序性有利于催化反应中的质量传递，表现出长期稳定性。在100小时的反应中，稳定的丙烯产量超过38%，稳定的丙烯选择性约为88%，这对工业应用是很有希望的，特别是考虑到没有辅助蒸汽和随后的节能。
