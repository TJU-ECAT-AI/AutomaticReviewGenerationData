Read the questions and answers provided below. First, critically assess the overall relevance of the answers provided to the set of questions asked.

If, upon your assessment, you find that the answers do not contain information that is relevant to the questions asked, stop your review process immediately and respond with a single sentence: "※※※※※※※The provided answers are not relevant to the questions.※※※※※※※". Do not provide any additional explanation or background information, only this sentence should be given as a response in case of irrelevant answers.

If, however, the answers are relevant to the questions asked, proceed to compile answers for each question according to the instructions below. Ensure to aggregate all the relevant answers from the multiple answer results provided in the document, and organize them sequentially by their order number, compiling the corresponding quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question.

If the provided answers' quotes are not differentiated by question, ensure to break them down and assign the quotes to each respective question, outputting them separately within each question's section.

To provide a comprehensive review, differentiate the responses into quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question based on the details given in the 'Answer' XML tags. Structure your review using the XML format showcased below if the answers are relevant to the questions asked:

How do various carbon-based materials, including coke deposits, carbon nanofibers, and hybrid nanocarbons, exhibit unexpected catalytic activity in alkane dehydrogenation reactions, and what are the proposed mechanisms, influencing factors (such as temperature and surface chemistry), and implications of this phenomenon for the development of novel and efficient carbon-based catalysts?

[1] "Metal-free ordered mesoporous carbons were demonstrated to be robust catalysts for direct dehydrogenation of propane to propylene, in the absence of any auxiliary steam, exhibiting high activity and selectivity, as well as long catalytic stability, in comparison with nanostructured carbons."
[2] "The presence of surface carbonyl groups is responsible for the dehydrogenation activity."
[3] "The large and well-ordered porosity of mesoporous carbon catalysts should also be beneficial for mass transport in catalytic reaction, exhibiting long time stability."
[4] "The stable propylene yield higher than 38%, together with the steady propylene selectivity of approximately 88% during reaction of 100 h reported here, is a promising indication for industrial applications, taking into account the absence of auxiliary steam and the subsequent energy savings."

1.Ordered mesoporous carbons, without any metal, have been shown to be robust catalysts for the direct dehydrogenation of propane to propylene, without the need for auxiliary steam. They exhibit high activity, selectivity, and long-term stability, outperforming nanostructured carbons. The presence of surface carbonyl groups is crucial for the dehydrogenation activity. The large and well-ordered porosity of mesoporous carbon catalysts is beneficial for mass transport in catalytic reactions, leading to long-term stability. The stable propylene yield of over 38% and the steady propylene selectivity of around 88% over 100 hours of reaction are promising for industrial applications, especially considering the absence of auxiliary steam and the resulting energy savings.

1.有序介孔碳材料，不含任何金属，已被证明是丙烷直接脱氢制丙烯的坚固催化剂，无需辅助蒸汽。它们表现出高活性、选择性和长期稳定性，优于纳米结构碳。表面羰基的存在对脱氢活性至关重要。有序介孔碳催化剂的大孔隙和良好的有序性有利于催化反应中的质量传递，表现出长期稳定性。100小时反应中超过38%的稳定丙烯产量和约88%的稳定丙烯选择性，对于工业应用来说是很有希望的，特别是考虑到没有辅助蒸汽和随之而来的能源节约。
