[1] "McGregor et al. have reported that a VOx/Al2O3 catalyst completely encapsulated by coke deposits (see Figure 26) is active in butane dehydrogenation."
[2] "The fact that catalytic activity remained the same despite complete coke encapsulation is remarkable, as this extent of coking usually results in a drastic decrease in activity."
[3] "The authors hypothesized that the carbon species formed on the catalyst surface were in fact catalyzing the reaction."
[4] "The highest activity was observed at 700 C, a temperature at which the carbon deposits display a very ordered structure."
[5] "In view of this, the authors decided to test their hypothesis by using carbon nanofibers (CNFs) as a catalyst under similar conditions."
[6] "Tellingly, CNFs proved to be catalytically active."
[7] "It was concluded that radicals formed on the surface of coke facilitate the dehydrogenation reaction, albeit at elevated temperatures the noncatalytic conversion of propane is also relatively high."
[8] "Furthermore, hybrid nanocarbon, comprising a diamond core and a graphitic shell, displayed activity for the dehydrogenation of propane, which was attributed to the presence of either ketone groups or structural defects in the graphitic material."

1.Carbon-based materials, including coke deposits, carbon nanofibers (CNFs), and hybrid nanocarbons, exhibit unexpected catalytic activity in alkane dehydrogenation reactions. The VOx/Al2O3 catalyst, when completely encapsulated by coke deposits, remains active in butane dehydrogenation, suggesting that the carbon species on the catalyst surface may be catalyzing the reaction. The highest activity is observed at 700 degrees Celsius, where the carbon deposits have a very ordered structure. CNFs, tested under similar conditions, also prove to be catalytically active. Radicals formed on the surface of coke are believed to facilitate the dehydrogenation reaction, although at high temperatures, noncatalytic conversion of propane is also relatively high. Hybrid nanocarbons, with a diamond core and a graphitic shell, show activity in propane dehydrogenation, attributed to the presence of ketone groups or structural defects in the graphitic material. These findings suggest that carbon-based materials can be developed as novel and efficient catalysts for alkane dehydrogenation reactions.

1.包括焦炭沉积物、碳纳米纤维(CNFs)和混合纳米碳在内的碳基材料，在烷烃脱氢反应中表现出意外的催化活性。当VOx/Al2O3催化剂被焦炭沉积物完全包裹时，它仍然在丁烷脱氢中保持活性，这表明催化剂表面的碳物种可能在催化反应中发挥作用。在700摄氏度时观察到最高的活性，此时碳沉积物具有非常有序的结构。在类似条件下测试的CNFs也被证明具有催化活性。认为在焦炭表面形成的自由基促进了脱氢反应，尽管在高温下，丙烷的非催化转化率也相对较高。由金刚石核心和石墨壳组成的混合纳米碳在丙烷脱氢中显示出活性，这归因于石墨材料中酮基团或结构缺陷的存在。这些发现表明，碳基材料可以被开发为烷烃脱氢反应中新型和高效的催化剂。
