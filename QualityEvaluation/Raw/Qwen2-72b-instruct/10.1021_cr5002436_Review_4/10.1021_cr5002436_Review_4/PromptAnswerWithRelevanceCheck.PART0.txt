How do various carbon-based materials, including coke deposits, carbon nanofibers, and hybrid nanocarbons, exhibit unexpected catalytic activity in alkane dehydrogenation reactions, and what are the proposed mechanisms, influencing factors (such as temperature and surface chemistry), and implications of this phenomenon for the development of novel and efficient carbon-based catalysts?

[1] "McGregor et al. have reported that a VOx/Al2O3 catalyst completely encapsulated by coke deposits (see Figure 26) is active in butane dehydrogenation."
[2] "The highest activity was observed at 700 C, a temperature at which the carbon deposits display a very ordered structure."
[3] "It was concluded that radicals formed on the surface of coke facilitate the dehydrogenation reaction, albeit at elevated temperatures the noncatalytic conversion of propane is also relatively high."
[4] "Furthermore, hybrid nanocarbon, comprising a diamond core and a graphitic shell, displayed activity for the dehydrogenation of propane, which was attributed to the presence of either ketone groups or structural defects in the graphitic material."
[5] "Liu et al. prepared carbon-based ordered mesoporous systems that showed activity in the dehydrogenation of propane in the absence of steam or oxidants."
[6] "The active sites were proposed to be oxygen-containing groups (CO), which are formed during a pretreatment step involving nitric acid."

1.Carbon-based materials, including coke deposits, carbon nanofibers, and hybrid nanocarbons, exhibit unexpected catalytic activity in alkane dehydrogenation reactions. The VOx/Al2O3 catalyst, when completely encapsulated by coke deposits, remains active in butane dehydrogenation, with the highest activity observed at 700 degrees Celsius, a temperature at which the carbon deposits display a very ordered structure. The catalytic activity is attributed to radicals formed on the surface of coke, which facilitate the dehydrogenation reaction. Hybrid nanocarbons, consisting of a diamond core and a graphitic shell, display activity for the dehydrogenation of propane, attributed to the presence of ketone groups or structural defects in the graphitic material. Carbon-based ordered mesoporous systems, prepared by Liu et al., show activity in the dehydrogenation of propane in the absence of steam or oxidants, with the active sites proposed to be oxygen-containing groups formed during a pretreatment step involving nitric acid. These findings have implications for the development of novel and efficient carbon-based catalysts for alkane dehydrogenation reactions.

1.包括焦炭沉积物、碳纳米纤维和混合纳米碳在内的碳基材料，在烷烃脱氢反应中表现出意外的催化活性。当VOx/Al2O3催化剂被焦炭沉积物完全包裹时，它在丁烷脱氢中仍然保持活性，最高活性在700摄氏度时观察到，这是碳沉积物显示出非常有序结构的温度。催化活性归因于焦炭表面形成的自由基，这些自由基促进了脱氢反应。由金刚石核心和石墨壳组成的混合纳米碳，在丙烷脱氢中显示出活性，归因于石墨材料中酮基团或结构缺陷的存在。刘等人制备的碳基有序介孔系统，在没有蒸汽或氧化剂的情况下，在丙烷脱氢中显示出活性，活性位点被提议为在涉及硝酸的预处理步骤中形成的含氧基团。这些发现对开发新型和高效的碳基催化剂用于烷烃脱氢反应具有重要意义。

[2] "The fact that catalytic activity remained the same despite complete coke encapsulation is remarkable, as this extent of coking usually results in a drastic decrease in activity."

The VOx/Al2O3 catalyst, when completely encapsulated by coke deposits, remains active in butane dehydrogenation, which is remarkable because such a degree of coking typically leads to a significant decrease in activity.

The highest activity is observed at 700 degrees Celsius, a temperature at which the carbon deposits have a very ordered structure. CNFs, tested under similar conditions, are also catalytically active.
