[1] "Bulk nitrogen doping can efficiently improve the catalytic performance of carbon nanotubes (CNT) in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODH). The graphitic nitrogen plays a determining role in enhancing their activity by speeding up the activation of oxygen and decreasing the overall activation energy of the reaction."

[2] "The doped CNT catalysts with suitable content of graphitic nitrogen are quite stable and more active for the ODH of propane. We believe that the graphitic nitrogen may play a determining role in enhancing the catalytic activity by decreasing the overall activation energy and speeding up the activation of oxygen."

[3] "Graphitic N atoms donate electrons to the graphitic sheet25 and improve the electron mobility from the basal plane to the intermediate O2 , promoting the final dissociation of gas-phase O2 to nucleophilic O2 species. For the ODH process, the doped N atoms reduce the dependence of the reaction rate on oxygen partial pressure and finally decrease the reaction order of oxygen (Fig. 3b)."

[4] "The improved surface coverage of blank active sites (y0) for propane conversion is therefore believed to be the reason for the enhanced ODH activity."

[5] "The graphitic N played a vital role in reducing the overall activation energy (Fig. 3b) and consequently increasing the reaction rate."

[6] "A linear relationship between activation energy and the atomic abundance of graphitic N (N3, atom%) can be fitted by the empirical equation Ea = 117.232.7  N3 to quantitatively describe the role of graphitic N in decreasing the activation energy of ODH."

1.氮掺杂碳纳米管（CNTs）在丙烷氧化脱氢（ODH）反应中表现出增强的催化活性。石墨氮在加速氧气活化和降低反应的总活化能方面起着关键作用。具有适宜石墨氮含量的掺杂CNT催化剂在丙烷ODH反应中既稳定又活性更高。石墨氮通过降低总活化能和加速氧气活化来增强催化活性。掺杂的N原子降低了反应速率对氧气分压的依赖性，并降低了氧气的反应级数。改善的空白活性位点表面覆盖率被认为是增强ODH活性的原因。石墨氮在降低总活化能和增加反应速率方面起着至关重要的作用。活化能与石墨N的原子丰度之间存在线性关系，可以拟合以定量描述石墨N在降低ODH活化能中的作用。
