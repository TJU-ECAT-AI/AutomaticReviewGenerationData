1.Nitrogen-doped carbon nanotubes (CNTs) exhibit enhanced catalytic activity in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODH). The graphitic nitrogen in the CNTs plays a key role in this enhancement by speeding up the activation of oxygen and decreasing the overall activation energy of the reaction. The doped CNT catalysts with suitable content of graphitic nitrogen are stable and more active for the ODH of propane. The graphitic nitrogen reduces the overall activation energy and increases the reaction rate. The improved surface coverage of active sites for propane conversion is believed to be the reason for the enhanced ODH activity. The doped nitrogen atoms may also facilitate propene to desorb from the surface due to the repulsion between the electron-rich graphitic surface and unsaturated C=C bonds of propene. A linear relationship between activation energy and the atomic abundance of graphitic N can be fitted to quantitatively describe the role of graphitic N in decreasing the activation energy of ODH. This concept can be applied to other reactions such as selective oxidation, electrochemical oxygen reduction, peroxidation, etc.

1.氮掺杂碳纳米管（CNTs）在丙烷氧化脱氢（ODH）反应中表现出增强的催化活性。CNTs中的石墨氮在增强催化活性中起着关键作用，通过加速氧气的活化和降低反应的总活化能。具有适当石墨氮含量的掺杂CNT催化剂稳定且对丙烷ODH更活跃。石墨氮降低了总活化能并增加了反应速率。丙烷转化的活性位点表面覆盖率的提高被认为是增强ODH活性的原因。掺杂的氮原子也可能由于石墨表面的电子丰富性和丙烯的不饱和C=C键之间的排斥作用，促进丙烯从表面脱附。石墨N的原子丰度和活化能之间可以拟合线性关系，以定量描述石墨N在降低ODH活化能中的作用。这一概念可以应用于其他反应，如选择性氧化、电化学氧还原、过氧化等。
