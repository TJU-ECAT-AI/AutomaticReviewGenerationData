The Mars-van Krevelen (MvK) mechanism is a pivotal concept in the realm of oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions, elucidating the dynamic process by which metal oxides catalyze the oxidation of various substrates. Central to this mechanism is the role of oxygen vacancies, which form on the catalyst surface under reaction conditions. These vacancies act as active sites for the adsorption of oxygen from the gas phase, facilitating the transfer of oxygen to the reactant molecules. The formation energy of oxygen vacancies (ΔEv) is a critical parameter that significantly influences the catalytic activity and surface oxidizing ability of the catalyst. A lower ΔEv facilitates the formation of more oxygen vacancies, enhancing the catalyst's ability to oxidize substrates efficiently. This interplay between ΔEv, oxygen vacancy formation, and catalytic activity underscores the importance of understanding and tailoring the properties of oxide catalysts for optimized performance in oxidation reactions.
