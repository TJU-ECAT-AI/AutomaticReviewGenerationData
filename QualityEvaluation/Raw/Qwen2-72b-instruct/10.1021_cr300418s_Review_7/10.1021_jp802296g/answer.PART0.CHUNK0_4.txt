[1] "The energy of CO reaction with an oxygen atom from the surface layer decays linearly with the energy of vacancy formation ΔEv, whereas the energy of adsorption of O2 at a vacancy is a linear function of ΔEv."

[3] "Because they both depend on the energy of oxygen vacancy formation, the latter quantity is a good descriptor of catalytic activity."
[4] "In deciding which intermediate reactions are most likely from an energetic point of view, we impose a spin conservation rule: a reaction that requires flipping a spin is too slow for catalysis."

1.The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions by utilizing the oxygen atoms from the oxide surface to oxidize the reactant, leaving behind an oxygen vacancy. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) is significant in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. The energy of CO reaction with an oxygen atom from the surface layer decays linearly with ΔEv, and the energy of adsorption of O2 at a vacancy is a linear function of ΔEv. These two reactions are the only ones in the mechanism whose energy varies from one doped oxide to another. Since both reactions depend on the energy of oxygen vacancy formation, ΔEv is a good descriptor of catalytic activity. The spin conservation rule is also applied, where reactions that require flipping a spin are considered too slow for catalysis, and only reactions that conserve spin are considered. All the dopants studied lower the energy of vacancy formation, making the doped oxides better oxidants than the undoped ones.

1. Mars-van Krevelen机制通过利用氧化物表面的氧原子来氧化反应物，留下一个氧空位，在氧化物催化的氧化反应中运作。形成氧空位所需的能量(ΔEv)在确定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力方面具有重要意义。CO与表面层中的氧原子反应的能量随ΔEv线性衰减，而O2在空位处的吸附能量是ΔEv的线性函数。这两种反应是机制中仅有的两种能量随不同掺杂氧化物而变化的反应。由于这两种反应都依赖于氧空位形成能量，因此ΔEv是催化活性的良好描述符。还应用了自旋守恒规则，其中需要翻转自旋的反应被认为是催化作用太慢的，只考虑自旋守恒的反应。研究的所有掺杂剂都降低了空位形成能，使掺杂氧化物比未掺杂的氧化物更好的氧化剂。
