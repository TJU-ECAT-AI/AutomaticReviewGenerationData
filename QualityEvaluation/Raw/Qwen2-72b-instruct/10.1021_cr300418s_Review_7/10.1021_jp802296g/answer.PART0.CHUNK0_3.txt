[1] "The energy of CO reaction with an oxygen atom from the surface layer decays linearly with the energy of vacancy formation ΔEv, whereas the energy of adsorption of O2 at a vacancy is a linear function of ΔEv."
[2] "These are the only two reactions in the mechanism whose energy varies from one doped oxide to another."
[3] "Because they both depend on the energy of oxygen vacancy formation, the latter quantity is a good descriptor of catalytic activity."
[4] "In deciding which intermediate reactions are most likely from an energetic point of view, we impose a spin conservation rule: a reaction that requires flipping a spin is too slow for catalysis."
[5] "Because of this, we only consider reactions that conserve spin."
[6] "We find that all the dopants studied here lower the energy of vacancy formation; therefore, the doped oxides are better oxidants than the undoped ones."

1.The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions involves the reaction of a reactant with an oxygen atom from the surface layer of the oxide, which leaves behind an oxygen vacancy. The energy of this reaction decays linearly with the energy of vacancy formation (ΔEv). The adsorption of O2 at the vacancy site is also a linear function of ΔEv. These two reactions are the only ones in the mechanism whose energy varies from one doped oxide to another. Since both reactions depend on the energy of oxygen vacancy formation, ΔEv is a good descriptor of catalytic activity. The spin conservation rule is also applied, where reactions that require flipping a spin are considered too slow for catalysis. The doped oxides studied lower the energy of vacancy formation, making them better oxidants than the undoped ones.

1.在氧化物催化的氧化反应中，Mars-van Krevelen机制涉及反应物与氧化物表面层的氧原子反应，留下一个氧空位。这种反应的能量与氧空位形成能（ΔEv）呈线性衰减。在空位处吸附O2也是ΔEv的线性函数。这两种反应是机制中唯一能量随不同掺杂氧化物变化的反应。由于两种反应都依赖于氧空位形成能，因此ΔEv是催化活性的良好描述符。还应用了自旋守恒规则，其中需要翻转自旋的反应被认为是催化作用太慢。研究的掺杂氧化物降低了空位形成能，使它们成为比未掺杂氧化物更好的氧化剂。
