[1] "The energy of CO reaction with an oxygen atom from the surface layer decays linearly with the energy of vacancy formation ΔEv, whereas the energy of adsorption of O2 at a vacancy is a linear function of ΔEv."
[2] "These are the only two reactions in the mechanism whose energy varies from one doped oxide to another."
[3] "Because they both depend on the energy of oxygen vacancy formation, the latter quantity is a good descriptor of catalytic activity."
[4] "In deciding which intermediate reactions are most likely from an energetic point of view, we impose a spin conservation rule: a reaction that requires flipping a spin is too slow for catalysis."
[5] "Because of this, we only consider reactions that conserve spin."
[6] "We find that all the dopants studied here lower the energy of vacancy formation; therefore, the doped oxides are better oxidants than the undoped ones."

1.The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions by utilizing the oxygen atoms from the surface layer of the oxide. The energy required for the reaction of CO with an oxygen atom from the surface layer decreases linearly with the energy of vacancy formation (ΔEv). Similarly, the energy of adsorption of O2 at a vacancy is also a linear function of ΔEv. These two reactions are the only ones in the mechanism whose energy varies from one doped oxide to another. Since both reactions depend on the energy of oxygen vacancy formation, ΔEv is a good descriptor of catalytic activity. The spin conservation rule is applied to determine which intermediate reactions are most likely from an energetic point of view, considering only reactions that conserve spin. All the dopants studied lower the energy of vacancy formation, making the doped oxides better oxidants than the undoped ones.

1. Mars-van Krevelen机制通过利用氧化物表面层的氧原子在氧化物催化的氧化反应中起作用。CO与表面层氧原子反应所需的能量随空位形成能(ΔEv)的降低而线性降低。同样，O2在空位处的吸附能也是ΔEv的线性函数。这两种反应是机制中唯一能量随不同掺杂氧化物而变化的反应。由于这两种反应都依赖于氧空位形成能，因此ΔEv是催化活性的良好描述符。为了从能量观点确定哪些中间反应最有可能，我们应用了自旋守恒规则：需要翻转自旋的反应对于催化来说太慢。因此，我们只考虑自旋守恒的反应。我们发现，这里研究的所有掺杂剂都降低了空位形成能，因此，掺杂氧化物比未掺杂的氧化物具有更好的氧化性。
