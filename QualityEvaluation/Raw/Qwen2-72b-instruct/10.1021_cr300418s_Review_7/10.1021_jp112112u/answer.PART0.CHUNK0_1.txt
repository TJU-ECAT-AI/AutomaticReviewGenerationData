[1] "This reaction follows the Mars van Krevelen mechanism, (16) in which CO removes oxygen from the oxide. This oxygen is then replenished in some way, regenerating the catalyst. It is now understood that, in order to enhance the formation of CO2 from CO, the key quantity is the formation energy of an oxygen vacancy in the oxide; by making the oxygen vacancy formation energy more favorable, the oxidation of CO can be enhanced."

1.The Mars van Krevelen mechanism involves the removal of oxygen from the oxide by CO, which is then replenished, regenerating the catalyst. To enhance CO oxidation, the key factor is the formation energy of an oxygen vacancy in the oxide. By making the formation of oxygen vacancies more favorable, the oxidation of CO can be improved.
