[1] "A large number of chemical reactions have been studied with ceria as the catalyst, key among these being CO oxidation to CO2. (6-15) This reaction follows the Mars van Krevelen mechanism, (16) in which CO removes oxygen from the oxide. This oxygen is then replenished in some way, regenerating the catalyst. It is now understood that, in order to enhance the formation of CO2 from CO, the key quantity is the formation energy of an oxygen vacancy in the oxide; by making the oxygen vacancy formation energy more favorable, the oxidation of CO can be enhanced."

1.The Mars van Krevelen mechanism involves the removal of oxygen from the oxide by CO, which is then replenished to regenerate the catalyst. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) is crucial, as making it more favorable enhances the oxidation of CO to CO2.

1.火星-范克里芬机制涉及CO从氧化物中移除氧气，然后以某种方式补充氧气，以再生催化剂。氧空位形成所需能量(ΔEv)是关键，因为使其更有利可以增强CO氧化为CO2。
