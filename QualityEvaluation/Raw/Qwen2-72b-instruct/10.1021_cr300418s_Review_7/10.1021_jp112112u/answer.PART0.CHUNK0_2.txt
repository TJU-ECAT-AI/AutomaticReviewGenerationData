[1] "A large number of chemical reactions have been studied with ceria as the catalyst, key among these being CO oxidation to CO2. (6-15) This reaction follows the Mars van Krevelen mechanism, (16) in which CO removes oxygen from the oxide. This oxygen is then replenished in some way, regenerating the catalyst. It is now understood that, in order to enhance the formation of CO2 from CO, the key quantity is the formation energy of an oxygen vacancy in the oxide; by making the oxygen vacancy formation energy more favorable, the oxidation of CO can be enhanced."

1.The Mars van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions by CO removing oxygen from the oxide, which is then replenished to regenerate the catalyst. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) is significant in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface, as making the oxygen vacancy formation energy more favorable enhances the oxidation of CO.

1.火星-范克里芬机制在氧化物催化氧化反应中通过CO从氧化物中去除氧气，然后以某种方式补充氧气，从而再生催化剂。形成氧空位所需的能量(ΔEv)对于确定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力至关重要，因为使氧空位形成能量更有利可以增强CO的氧化。
