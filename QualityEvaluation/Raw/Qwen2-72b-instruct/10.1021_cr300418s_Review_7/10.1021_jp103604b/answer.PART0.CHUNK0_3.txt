[1] "Some (Cu, Fe) are capable of having two different valence states, whereas some (Zn, Mg, Al) have only one. All of them lower substantially the energy of vacancy formation on the two faces."
[2] "The oxygen atoms that are easier to remove are more reactive, and the lowering of the energy of oxygen-vacancy formation is a good descriptor of the extent to which doping makes the oxide a better oxidant."
[3] "Dopants having a higher valence than the cation they replace in the oxide (e.g., Zn oxide doped with Ti) tend to adsorb O2 from the gas phase and activate it to make it a better oxidant."
[4] "In some cases, doping facilitates the dissociative adsorption of molecules. This happens either because one of the fragments binds to the dopant and the other to an oxygen atom nearby or because both fragments bind to the surface oxygen atoms activated by the presence of the dopant."
[5] "The energy of oxygen-vacancy formation can be used as a crude predictor of the ability of the oxygen atoms at the surface of the oxide to engage in chemical reactions."

1.The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions by utilizing oxygen atoms from the surface of the oxide to oxidize reactants. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) is significant because it determines the reactivity of the oxygen atoms and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. Lowering the energy of oxygen-vacancy formation makes the oxide a better oxidant, as the oxygen atoms become more reactive and easier to remove. This is beneficial for catalytic activity, as it facilitates the oxidation of reactants. However, if the oxygen is too easy to remove, it may be difficult to re-oxidize the surface, which can lead to a reduction in catalytic activity. Doping the oxide with certain elements can lower the energy of oxygen-vacancy formation, making the oxide a better oxidant and potentially improving catalytic activity.

1.火星-范克雷维尔机制在氧化物催化的氧化反应中通过利用氧化物表面的氧原子来氧化反应物。形成氧空位所需的能量(ΔEv)是重要的，因为它决定了氧原子的反应性和氧化物表面的氧化能力。降低氧空位形成能使得氧化物成为更好的氧化剂，因为氧原子变得更加反应性和容易去除。这对催化活性有益，因为它促进了反应物的氧化。然而，如果氧太容易去除，可能很难重新氧化表面，这可能导致催化活性的降低。通过用某些元素掺杂氧化物可以降低氧空位形成能，使氧化物成为更好的氧化剂，从而可能提高催化活性。
