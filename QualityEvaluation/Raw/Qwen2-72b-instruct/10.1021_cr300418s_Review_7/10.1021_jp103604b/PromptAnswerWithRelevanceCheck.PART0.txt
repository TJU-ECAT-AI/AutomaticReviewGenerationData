[1] "Some (Cu, Fe) are capable of having two different valence states, whereas some (Zn, Mg, Al) have only one. All of them lower substantially the energy of vacancy formation on the two faces."
[2] "The oxygen atoms that are easier to remove are more reactive, and the lowering of the energy of oxygen-vacancy formation is a good descriptor of the extent to which doping makes the oxide a better oxidant."
[3] "For example, (2, 3, 5) for several doped oxides, CO reacts more readily with an oxygen atom near the dopant than it would in the absence of the dopant: doping facilitates the Marsvan Krevelen mechanism (6, 7) for oxidation."
[4] "Dopants having a higher valence than the cation they replace in the oxide (e.g., Zn oxide doped with Ti) tend to adsorb O2 from the gas phase and activate it to make it a better oxidant."
[5] "The oxygen atoms engaged in the oxidation reaction come from the gas phase not from the surface."
[6] "Doping facilitates the dissociative adsorption of molecules. This happens either because one of the fragments binds to the dopant and the other to an oxygen atom nearby or because both fragments bind to the surface oxygen atoms activated by the presence of the dopant."
[7] "The energy of oxygen-vacancy formation can be used as a crude predictor of the ability of the oxygen atoms at the surface of the oxide to engage in chemical reactions."

1.The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions by utilizing oxygen atoms from the oxide surface to oxidize reactants. Doping the oxide with certain elements can make the oxygen atoms more reactive and easier to remove, which in turn lowers the energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv). This reduction in ΔEv is a good indicator of how doping enhances the oxide's oxidizing ability. For instance, in doped oxides, carbon monoxide (CO) reacts more readily with an oxygen atom near the dopant than it would without the dopant, facilitating the Mars-van Krevelen mechanism for oxidation. Additionally, dopants with a higher valence than the cation they replace can adsorb oxygen from the gas phase, activating it to become a better oxidant. In some cases, doping also facilitates the dissociative adsorption of molecules, where fragments bind to the dopant or nearby oxygen atoms. The energy of oxygen-vacancy formation serves as a rough predictor of the surface oxygen atoms' ability to participate in chemical reactions.

1.马斯-范克雷维尔机制通过利用氧化物表面的氧原子来氧化反应物，在氧化物催化的氧化反应中起作用。通过用某些元素掺杂氧化物，可以使氧原子更具反应性，更容易去除，从而降低形成氧空位所需的能量（ΔEv）。这种ΔEv的降低是掺杂增强氧化物氧化能力的良好指标。例如，在掺杂的氧化物中，一氧化碳（CO）与靠近掺杂剂的氧原子反应比没有掺杂剂时更强烈，促进了马斯-范克雷维尔机制的氧化。此外，比它们所取代的阳离子具有更高价态的掺杂剂可以从气相中吸附氧气，使其活化，成为更好的氧化剂。在某些情况下，掺杂还促进了分子的解离吸附，其中片段与掺杂剂或附近的氧原子结合。氧空位形成能量作为表面氧原子参与化学反应能力的粗略预测。

1.The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions by utilizing oxygen atoms from the oxide surface to oxidize reactants. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) is significant because it determines the reactivity of the oxygen atoms and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. Lowering the energy of oxygen-vacancy formation makes the oxide a better oxidant, as the oxygen atoms become easier to remove and more reactive. This can enhance the efficiency of the Mars-van Krevelen mechanism and improve catalytic activity. However, if the oxygen is too easy to remove, it may be difficult to reoxidize the surface, potentially reducing the catalyst's effectiveness for oxidation reactions.
