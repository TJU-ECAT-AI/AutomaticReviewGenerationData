[1] "Some (Cu, Fe) are capable of having two different valence states, whereas some (Zn, Mg, Al) have only one. All of them lower substantially the energy of vacancy formation on the two faces."
[2] "The oxygen atoms that are easier to remove are more reactive, and the lowering of the energy of oxygen-vacancy formation is a good descriptor of the extent to which doping makes the oxide a better oxidant."
[3] "Dopants having a higher valence than the cation they replace in the oxide (e.g., Zn oxide doped with Ti) tend to adsorb O2 from the gas phase and activate it to make it a better oxidant."
[4] "In some cases, doping facilitates the dissociative adsorption of molecules. This happens either because one of the fragments binds to the dopant and the other to an oxygen atom nearby or because both fragments bind to the surface oxygen atoms activated by the presence of the dopant."
[5] "The energy of oxygen-vacancy formation can be used as a crude predictor of the ability of the oxygen atoms at the surface of the oxide to engage in chemical reactions."

1.The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions by utilizing oxygen atoms from the oxide surface to oxidize reactants. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) is significant because it determines the reactivity of the oxygen atoms and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. Lowering the energy of oxygen-vacancy formation makes the oxide a better oxidant, as the oxygen atoms become easier to remove and more reactive. This can enhance the efficiency of the Mars-van Krevelen mechanism and improve catalytic activity. However, if the oxygen is too easy to remove, it may be difficult to reoxidize the surface, potentially reducing the catalyst's effectiveness for oxidation reactions.

1.马斯-范克雷维尔机制通过利用氧化物表面的氧原子来氧化反应物，在氧化物催化的氧化反应中起作用。形成氧空位所需的能量（ΔEv）很重要，因为它决定了氧原子的反应性和氧化物表面的氧化能力。降低氧空位形成能使得氧化物成为更好的氧化剂，因为氧原子更容易去除，反应性更强。这可以增强马斯-范克雷维尔机制的效率，提高催化活性。然而，如果氧太容易去除，可能很难重新氧化表面，可能降低催化剂对氧化反应的有效性。
