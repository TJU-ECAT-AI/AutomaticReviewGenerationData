[1] "In the Marsvan Krevelen mechanism, the reductant is oxidized by the oxygen atoms from the oxides surface layer (not by adsorbed oxygen or by gas-phase oxygen). When the oxidation products desorb, they leave behind oxygen vacancies."
[2] "The assumption is that the smaller is ΔEv, the better oxidant is the surface."
[3] "To complete the catalytic cycle, the gaseous oxidant (oxygen, CO2, N2O) must be able to reoxidize the surface."
[4] "Therefore, in designing an oxidation catalyst, we must follow a moderation principle: we should modify the surface to make ΔEv small, but not too small."

1.The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism involves the oxidation of a reductant by surface oxygen atoms of an oxide catalyst, leading to the formation of oxygen vacancies when the oxidation products desorb. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) is crucial as a smaller ΔEv indicates a better oxidant surface. However, the surface must also be reoxidizable by a gaseous oxidant to complete the catalytic cycle. In catalyst design, it's important to balance the reduction of ΔEv to enhance oxidizing ability without making it too small, which could hinder the reoxidation of the surface.

1.在Mars-van Krevelen机制中，还原剂被氧化物催化剂表面的氧原子氧化，当氧化产物脱附时，会留下氧空位。氧空位形成所需的能量(ΔEv)至关重要，因为较小的ΔEv表明表面具有更好的氧化能力。然而，为了完成催化循环，表面必须能够被气相氧化剂(氧气、二氧化碳、一氧化二氮)重新氧化。在催化剂设计中，重要的是要平衡降低ΔEv以增强氧化能力，同时避免使其过小，这可能会阻碍表面的再氧化。
