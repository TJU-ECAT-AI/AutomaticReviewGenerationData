[1] "In the Marsvan Krevelen mechanism, the reductant is oxidized by the oxygen atoms from the oxides surface layer (not by adsorbed oxygen or by gas-phase oxygen). When the oxidation products desorb, they leave behind oxygen vacancies. The role of the gas-phase oxidant, introduced with the feed, is to annihilate the oxygen vacancies (to reoxidize the surface)."
[2] "We assume that there is a connection between the ability of surface oxygen to act as an oxidizing agent and the energy ΔEv required for forming an oxygen vacancy. To be precise, ΔEv is the energy of the reaction where Ox is the oxide (doped or not) and Oxv is the oxide with an oxygen vacancy on the surface. The assumption is that the smaller is ΔEv, the better oxidant is the surface."
[3] "However, one must keep in mind that a very small ΔEv means that the surface is a good oxidant, but it is not necessarily a good oxidation catalyst. To complete the catalytic cycle, the gaseous oxidant (oxygen, CO2, N2O) must be able to reoxidize the surface. If oxygen is too easy to remove from the surface layer, it will be difficult to put back."

1.The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism involves the oxidation of a reductant by surface oxygen atoms of an oxide catalyst, not by adsorbed or gas-phase oxygen. The reductant is oxidized, and upon desorption, oxygen vacancies are left on the surface. The gas-phase oxidant, such as oxygen, then reoxidizes the surface by filling these vacancies. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) is crucial as it correlates with the surface's oxidizing ability. A lower ΔEv indicates a better oxidant surface. However, a surface with too low ΔEv might not be an efficient oxidation catalyst because the reoxidation step might become difficult if oxygen is too easily removed from the surface.

1.火星-范克雷维尔机制涉及还原剂被氧化物催化剂表面的氧原子氧化，而不是被吸附或气相氧氧化。还原剂被氧化，脱附后，表面留下氧空位。气相氧化剂，如氧气，然后通过填充这些空位重新氧化表面。形成氧空位所需的能量（ΔEv）至关重要，因为它与表面的氧化能力相关。较低的ΔEv表明表面是一个更好的氧化剂。然而，ΔEv过低的表面可能不是一个有效的氧化催化剂，因为如果氧太容易从表面去除，重新氧化步骤可能变得困难。
