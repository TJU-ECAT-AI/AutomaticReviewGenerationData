[1] "In such reactions, the gases introduced in the reactor contain a reductant (e.g., an alkane, CO, H2) and an oxidant (e.g., O2, CO2, N2O). In the Marsvan Krevelen mechanism, the reductant is oxidized by the oxygen atoms from the oxides surface layer (not by adsorbed oxygen or by gas-phase oxygen). When the oxidation products desorb, they leave behind oxygen vacancies. The role of the gas-phase oxidant, introduced with the feed, is to annihilate the oxygen vacancies (to reoxidize the surface)."
[2] "The assumption is that the smaller is ΔEv, the better oxidant is the surface. Once we accept this idea, we can calculate ΔEv for a quick screening of the oxidative power of various oxides (doped or undoped). Moreover, if we want to make an oxide a better oxidant, we should look for modifications that make ΔEv smaller."
[3] "However, one must keep in mind that a very small ΔEv means that the surface is a good oxidant, but it is not necessarily a good oxidation catalyst. To complete the catalytic cycle, the gaseous oxidant (oxygen, CO2, N2O) must be able to reoxidize the surface. If oxygen is too easy to remove from the surface layer, it will be difficult to put back."

1.The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism involves the oxidation of a reductant by the oxygen atoms from the surface layer of an oxide catalyst, not by adsorbed or gas-phase oxygen. The reductant is oxidized, and upon desorption of the oxidation products, oxygen vacancies are left behind. The gas-phase oxidant, such as oxygen, CO2, or N2O, serves to reoxidize the surface by annihilating these oxygen vacancies. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) is a measure of the surface's oxidizing ability. A smaller ΔEv indicates a better oxidant surface, but it does not necessarily mean a better oxidation catalyst. For a complete catalytic cycle, the surface must be reoxidizable by the gaseous oxidant. If ΔEv is too small, the surface may be too reactive, making it difficult for the oxidant to reoxidize the surface effectively.

1.火星-范克雷维尔机制涉及还原剂被氧化物催化剂表面层的氧原子氧化，而不是被吸附或气相氧氧化。还原剂被氧化，氧化产物脱附后，留下氧空位。气相氧化剂，如氧气、CO2或N2O，通过消除这些氧空位来重新氧化表面。形成氧空位所需的能量(ΔEv)是表面氧化能力的量度。较小的ΔEv表明表面是一个更好的氧化剂，但这并不一定意味着是一个更好的氧化催化剂。为了完成催化循环，表面必须能够被气相氧化剂重新氧化。如果ΔEv太小，表面可能过于反应性，使得氧化剂难以有效地重新氧化表面。

1.The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism involves the oxidation of a reductant by surface oxygen atoms of an oxide catalyst, leading to the formation of oxygen vacancies when the oxidation products desorb. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) is crucial as a smaller ΔEv indicates a better oxidant surface. However, the surface must also be reoxidizable by a gaseous oxidant to complete the catalytic cycle. In catalyst design, it's important to balance the reduction of ΔEv to enhance oxidizing ability without making it too small, which could hinder the reoxidation of the surface.

1.在Mars-van Krevelen机制中，还原剂被氧化物催化剂表面的氧原子氧化，当氧化产物脱附时，会留下氧空位。氧空位形成所需的能量(ΔEv)至关重要，因为较小的ΔEv表明表面具有更好的氧化能力。然而，为了完成催化循环，表面必须能够被气相氧化剂(氧气、二氧化碳、一氧化二氮)重新氧化。在催化剂设计中，重要的是要平衡降低ΔEv以增强氧化能力，同时避免使其过小，这可能会阻碍表面的再氧化。

The reductant is oxidized, and upon desorption, oxygen vacancies are left on the surface. The gas-phase oxidant, such as oxygen, then reoxidizes the surface by filling these vacancies. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) is crucial as it correlates with the surface's oxidizing ability. A lower ΔEv indicates a better oxidant surface. However, a surface with too low ΔEv might not be an efficient oxidation catalyst because the reoxidation step might become difficult if oxygen is too easily removed from the surface.
