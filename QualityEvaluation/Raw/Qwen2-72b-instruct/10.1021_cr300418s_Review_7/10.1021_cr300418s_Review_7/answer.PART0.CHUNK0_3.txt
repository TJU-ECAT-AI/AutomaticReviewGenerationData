[1] "In such reactions, the gases introduced in the reactor contain a reductant (e.g., an alkane, CO, H2) and an oxidant (e.g., O2, CO2, N2O). In the Marsvan Krevelen mechanism, the reductant is oxidized by the oxygen atoms from the oxides surface layer (not by adsorbed oxygen or by gas-phase oxygen). When the oxidation products desorb, they leave behind oxygen vacancies."
[2] "The role of the gas-phase oxidant, introduced with the feed, is to annihilate the oxygen vacancies (to reoxidize the surface)."
[3] "We assume that there is a connection between the ability of surface oxygen to act as an oxidizing agent and the energy ΔEv required for forming an oxygen vacancy."
[4] "The assumption is that the smaller is ΔEv, the better oxidant is the surface."
[5] "However, one must keep in mind that a very small ΔEv means that the surface is a good oxidant, but it is not necessarily a good oxidation catalyst."
[6] "To complete the catalytic cycle, the gaseous oxidant (oxygen, CO2, N2O) must be able to reoxidize the surface."

1.The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism involves the oxidation of a reductant by the oxygen atoms from the surface layer of an oxide catalyst, not by adsorbed or gas-phase oxygen. The reductant is oxidized, and upon desorption of the oxidation products, oxygen vacancies are left behind. The gas-phase oxidant then reoxidizes the surface, filling the oxygen vacancies. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) is assumed to be connected to the surface oxygen's ability to act as an oxidizing agent. A smaller ΔEv indicates a better oxidant surface, but it does not necessarily mean a better oxidation catalyst. For a complete catalytic cycle, the gaseous oxidant must be able to reoxidize the surface.

1.火星-范克雷维尔机制涉及还原剂被氧化物催化剂表面层的氧原子氧化，而不是被吸附或气相氧氧化。还原剂被氧化，氧化产物脱附后，留下氧空位。气相氧化剂随后重新氧化表面，填补氧空位。氧空位形成所需能量（ΔEv）被假设与表面氧作为氧化剂的能力有关。较小的ΔEv表明表面是一个更好的氧化剂，但这并不一定意味着是一个更好的氧化催化剂。为了完成催化循环，气相氧化剂必须能够重新氧化表面。
