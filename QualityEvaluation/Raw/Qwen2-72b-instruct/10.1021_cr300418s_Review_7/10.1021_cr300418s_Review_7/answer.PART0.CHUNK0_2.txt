[1] "In such reactions, the gases introduced in the reactor contain a reductant (e.g., an alkane, CO, H2) and an oxidant (e.g., O2, CO2, N2O). In the Marsvan Krevelen mechanism, the reductant is oxidized by the oxygen atoms from the oxides surface layer (not by adsorbed oxygen or by gas-phase oxygen). When the oxidation products desorb, they leave behind oxygen vacancies. The role of the gas-phase oxidant, introduced with the feed, is to annihilate the oxygen vacancies (to reoxidize the surface)."
[2] "We assume that there is a connection between the ability of surface oxygen to act as an oxidizing agent and the energy ΔEv required for forming an oxygen vacancy."
[3] "The assumption is that the smaller is ΔEv, the better oxidant is the surface."
[4] "However, one must keep in mind that a very small ΔEv means that the surface is a good oxidant, but it is not necessarily a good oxidation catalyst."
[5] "Therefore, in designing an oxidation catalyst, we must follow a moderation principle: we should modify the surface to make ΔEv small, but not too small."

1.The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism involves the oxidation of a reductant by the oxygen atoms from the surface layer of an oxide catalyst, not by adsorbed or gas-phase oxygen. The reductant is oxidized, and the resulting oxidation products desorb, leaving oxygen vacancies. The gas-phase oxidant then reoxidizes the surface by annihilating these vacancies. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) is assumed to be connected to the surface oxygen's ability to act as an oxidizing agent. A smaller ΔEv indicates a better oxidant surface. However, a very small ΔEv does not necessarily mean the surface is a good oxidation catalyst. In designing an oxidation catalyst, it is important to follow a moderation principle, making ΔEv small but not too small, to ensure the surface can be reoxidized by the gaseous oxidant.

1.火星-范克雷维尔机制涉及还原剂被氧化物催化剂表面层的氧原子氧化，而不是被吸附或气相氧氧化。还原剂被氧化，随后氧化产物脱附，留下氧空位。气相氧化剂通过消除这些空位重新氧化表面。氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）被认为与表面氧作为氧化剂的能力有关。较小的ΔEv表明表面是一个更好的氧化剂。然而，非常小的ΔEv并不一定意味着表面是一个良好的氧化催化剂。在设计氧化催化剂时，重要的是遵循适度原则，使ΔEv变小，但不要过小，以确保表面能够被气态氧化剂重新氧化。
