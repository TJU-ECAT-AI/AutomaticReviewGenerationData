Oxygen nonstoichiometry of nanosized ceria powder Sangtae Kim *, Rotraut Merkle, Joachim Maier Department of Chemistry, Max-Planck-Institut f ur Festk orperforschung, Heisenbergstrae 1, 70569 Stuttgart, Germany Received 2 September 2003; accepted for publication 2 December 2003 Abstract Oxygen nonstoichiometry of nanocrystalline ceria powder with a particle size of about 12 nm was measured by thermogravimetric techniques as a function of temperature, oxygen partial pressure and synthetic route. The measured oxygen release/uptake from the samples under isothermal or isobaric conditions applied in this study are found to be predominantly due to variations in the surface nonstoichiometry. Its oxygen partial pressure dependence indicates the presence of surface oxygen vacancies in different ionization states in addition to segregated impurities. 2003 Published by Elsevier B.V.

1. Introduction
The investigation of oxygen storage in nano- crystalline ceria (n-CeO2d) is of double interest.
Firstly, since ceria is a model mixed conductor with a simple structure and a simple bulk defect chemistry, it should provide a more detailed in- sight into the defect chemistry of oxide surfaces in general. In particular, in the surface science com- munity, not very much attention is paid to defect chemistry which does not only govern bulk and sub-surface properties but also the surface prop- erties such as catalytic activity [1]. Secondly, the results may serve to test the space charge model for n-CeO2d recently proposed on the basis of con- ductivity experiments [1,2]. It was noticed that nominally pure nanocrystalline ceria (n-CeO2d) ceramics showed a significantly enhanced n-type overall conductivity even under conditions under which the bulk is expected to be ionically con- ducting [25]. The following core-space charge picture [6] explains this: The grain boundary core in n-CeO2d ceramics is positively charged (this is also proposed for coarse-grained ceria [7]) result- ing in accumulating electrons (e0) and depleting oxygen vacancies (V O) simultaneously in the vicin- ity of the interface (viz. space charge zones). As a result, the space charge zones become extremely conductive for e0, while highly resistive for V
O.
This leads to enhanced electronic and depressed ionic conductivities as confirmed in detail in Ref.
[2].
Unclear is the source of the positive excess charge in the grain boundary core. One possi- bility is the segregation of dopants. As long as the electron accumulation is not severe in absolute carrier numbers (even though severe in terms of conductivity) we do not have to worry about the source of the accumulated conduction * Corresponding author.

The surface charge may even exclusively stem from native effects, viz. from oxygen vacancies [7]: It is intelligible and known from computa- tion that the formation energy for V O and e0 is reduced at the surface [8]. Owing to the rela- tively low measurement temperatures of 350500 C, we do not only expect an increased vacancy concentration there but we also expect the mean charge to be depressed as a consequence of association (that the effective charge of oxygen ions at the surface is closer to )1 than to )2 is simply effected by the reduced cation coordina- tion). Porat et al. reported the oxygen partial pressure (PO2) dependence of d in n-CeO2d (10 nm) measured (at 405455 C and PO2  0:110 Pa) by coulometric titration to obey a )1/2 power law (which may be compared with the )1/6 power found for the conductivity [4]) that they attributed to either neutral adsorption of oxygen molecules or atomic incorporation into neutral oxygen vacancies, formed by association at the surface layer [9]. Knauth and Tuller, on the other hand, observed d / P 1=3
O2
for Pr-doped n-CeO2d (35 nm) at 470 C and d / P 1=6
O2
at 540 and 640 C [10]. They also considered the exponent of )1/3 measured at lower temperature to largely stem from defect association of e0 and
V
O. Their quantitative interpretation
assumed electroneutrality in the surface layer which does not seem to be fulfilled according to the detailed electrical measurements mentioned above [2].
In this contribution we present studies on oxy- gen nonstoichiometry in n-CeO2d powder as a function of PO2, temperature and synthesis condi- tions by using thermogravimetric (TG) analysis combined with mass spectroscopy (MS). We will semi-quantitatively discuss the measured
PO2
dependence of nonstoichiometry within the core- space charge model.
2. Experimental
n-CeO2d powder was synthesized in two dif- ferent ways for comparison: On one hand it was precipitated from aqueous Ce(NO3)3  6H2O (Al- drich, 99.99%) solution by dilute ammonia at room temperature (n-CeO2d [A]); on the other hand it was directly produced by thermally decomposing Ce(NO3)3  6H2O at 350
C
(n- CeO2d [B]). The particle size of the as-synthe- sized powders was about 8 nm (for details, see Ref. [2]). Before TG experiments, the sample powder was pre-annealed at 600 C for 2 h to remove any volatile species in the sample (leading to a BET surface of approximately 80 m2/g corresponding to a grain size of about 12 nm).
TG
measurements were performed with a NETZSCH STA 449 thermobalance coupled by a heated glass capillary to a BALZERS Prisma mass spectrometer. The typical sample weight was 34 g, and the purge gas flow (O2/N2 mix- tures) 30 ml/min. In isothermal runs, the weight change after stepwise increase of PO2 was re- corded. After about 10 min the gas exchange around the sample was completed and the weight stabilized at its new value. Under such circumstances, weight differences of typically 10 20 lg can still be measured reliably. The errors in measurements are expected to increase with increasing PO2, since weight changes in the sam- ple decrease while the buoyancy effects, that have to be corrected for, increase. In order to minimize weight effects due to fluctuations of the water partial pressure in the purge gas [11], a constant water partial pressure of 200 ppm was established.
Buoyancy corrections were done with inert, coarse grained SiO2 reference mate- rial. The conversion of the weight differences measured by TG to absolute d is not indepen- dent from the assumed defect model and is dis- cussed in more detail below. The maximum possible measurement temperature (no particle growth within 4 h) was found to be about
500 C.
The amount of released/taken-up oxygen upon isobaric stepwise temperature changes was, on the other hand, calculated from a quantitative analysis of the MS oxygen signal, since the total weight changes of the sample in these conditions were dominated rather by the water desorption/ adsorption [11].

3. Results and discussion
For the sake of clarity we distinguish, in the following, between two different processes of oxy- gen release/uptake of n-CeO2d, namely: (i) molec- ular oxygen adsorption/desorption, (ii) atomic oxygen incorporation/excorporation into bulk or surface layer, and only (ii) is considered to be responsible for d.
In order to investigate how far the molecular oxygen adsorption/desorption contributes to the observed oxygen uptake/release of n-CeO2d in the temperature range of interest, a sample of n- CeO2d [B] is heated dynamically up to 500 C (see Fig. 1). The oxygen release is found to start at about 300 C (while the water release begins al- ready at about 200 C, indicating that the trans- port of released species to the MS is sufficiently fast so that the observed oxygen release tempera- ture of 300 C is determined by the sample prop- erties and not by transport limitations in the experimental setup). This strongly indicates the observed oxygen release/uptake not to be caused by the molecular oxygen adsorption/desorption: In the case of thermodesorption measurements on alumina-supported ceria, oxygen release was ob- served to start at about 400 C [12], or 300 C [13],and from isotope exchange experiments it was concluded that this oxygen was evolved from the lattice. On the other hand, after O2 adsorption on reduced TiO2(1 1 0) surfaces, a thermal desorption peak at the much lower temperature of 410 K was interpreted as removal of adsorbed molecular oxygen species, presumably O 2 [14]. We can, thus,reasonably ignore molecular adsorption effects in dDd of n-CeO2d under the conditions indicated.
From a quantitative analysis of the m  32 MS data, the total amount of released oxygen is esti- mated to correspond to a fraction of 2 Â· 104 (relative to all oxygen atoms in the sample).
Fig. 2 shows the MS signals of O2 released from two differently prepared samples (n-CeO2d [A,B]) during fast (10 K/min) stepwise temperature changes at PO2  15 Pa in the purge gas. For both samples, the oxygen release upon temperature in- crease is reversible as demonstrated by the oxygen uptake during cooling. The oxygen release from a similar amount of microcrystalline CeO2d (99.999%, Aldrich, BET surface 10 m2/g, particle size 100 nm), on the other hand, amounts to less than one tenth of that of n-CeO2d, indicating that,indeed, the surface is predominantly responsible for a measured d in n-CeO2d, which is consistent with theoretical calculations [6]. This is also con- firmed by the fact that isothermal PO2 changes of the microcrystalline sample yield weight changes that come close to the detection limit (including the buoyancy corrections). -2 -1 0 1 2 temperature /C 100 200 300 400 500 ion current  / 10

Let us now consider the PO2 dependence of d for the nanocrystalline samples. For both n-CeO2d [A] and n-CeO2d [B] we measured the d evolution upon isothermal PO2 changes as shown in Figs. 3 and 4a. Fig. 3 shows the data measured for n- CeO2d [A]. The vertical distance of the individual isotherms was calculated from the quantitative analysis of the experiments shown in Fig. 2. In order to calibrate the measurements with respect to absolute stoichiometries, the whole set of curves was shifted vertically to achieve d  0 for the lowest temperature. The so-obtained data can be fitted by a straight line in the loglog plot (Fig. 3b), corresponding to a power-law dependence of d on PO2 (d / P n O2 ) with the measured average exponent (n) of PO2 dependence being )0.28  0.02 (skipping the less reliable data at 350 C), which is not far from the value of )1/3 previously reported by Porat et al. [9].
The data for n-CeO2d [B] are shown in Fig. 4a.
Again the vertical distances were calculated from the oxygen uptake/release experiments in Fig. 2.
Interestingly this sample shows a significantly higher d than observed for n-CeO2d [A]. More- over, the PO2 dependence exhibits an unexpected linear dependence in the semi-log plot (Fig. 4a) with the consequence of systematic deviations from a straight line in the loglog plot. The linear behaviour in the semi-log plot makes it difficult to determine the absolute position of the set of indi- vidual isotherms on the ordinate, because there is no flattening at high PO2 which could indicate the position of a common zero point. As a result,the set of curves was tentatively shifted such that the intersection point of the various linear regression lines in Fig. 4a comes close to d  0 (which is at 107 Pa) This is justified in more detail in Appendix A which takes account of the fact that the surface generally exhibits a net charge. If linear regression lines are drawn in the loglog plot de- spite the systematic deviations of the data points,an average exponent of the PO2 dependence of )0.11 is found. Of course this value varies when the set of curves is positioned differently along the ordinate, reaching e.g. a value of )0.13 when d  0 is fulfilled for the lowest temperature at PO2  105 Pa. Regardless of this uncertainty, the PO2 depen- dence is significantly less pronounced in this sam- ple compared to the n-CeO2d [A] sample with similar particle size. This may indicate that not only particle size but also preparation conditions (e.g. surface morphology and maybe also the amount and type of impurities segregated onto the surface) play a decisive role in the surface state of pO2  / Pa 10 100 1000 10000 100000 Î´  / 10 -4

199 n-CeO2d prepared at relatively moderate temper- atures. In fact, for ceria, the stabilization energies of V O at the surface were calculated to vary from
0.4 to 2.5 eV depending upon the surface orien-
tation [8]. It is obvious that the exponents of the measured
PO2
dependence are more strongly influenced by the synthetic and ambient conditions than the typical values expected for bulk defect chemistry.
In order to understand such measured PO2 de- pendences, we first take the following into con- sideration: As demonstrated in Ref. [2] for grain boundaries, the surface of the particles is consid- ered to be positively charged. Note that, in view of the conductivity studies of n-CeO2d [2], we can expect the surface charge to be much greater than the Dd therein (Rs=zF  Dd, R, z and F denote the surface charge density, the charge number and Faraday constant, respectively). As a source, we assume segregated impurities of charge z  a (Aa s ,the subscript s indicates the surface) together with oxygen vacancies that, according to the above considerations, should exhibit an effective charge z  e distinctively smaller than )2. The mean va- lence e of oxygen vacancies may be constituted by the simultaneous occurrence of V
O, V
O and V x
O (V
O
and V x O are singly- and uncharged oxygen vacancies,respectively). For simplicity and as an approxima- tion, we lump them together by assuming a mean representative species V e Os. We now distinguish two extreme cases in which Rs is predominantly deter- mined by either V e Os or Aa s . Then we have to con- sider the following two cases: Case 1: The surface charge is established by oxygen vacancies, i.e. V e Os  Aa s . Since now Dd  V e Os  R=eF , it simply follows that the rel- ative variation of d is negligible:olnd=olnPO2  0:1 Case 2: The surface charge is established by the impurities for which we roughly assume a fixed valence: Aa s   R=aF , i.e. V e Os  Aa s .
In this case we proceed as follows: The defect equilibrium for a situation of charge separation can be approximately described by 1=2 O2  V e Os  ee0 1  Ox

charge potential including the potential drop from surface to the bulk space charge layer. Ks1 is the purely chemical constant of the reaction (2).
As D/s1 is essentially determined by the invari- ant impurity segregation, it can be considered to be PO2 independent. Consequently, we now obtain from Eq. (3) that olnV e Os=olnPO2  1=2  e=4 4 since olne0 1=olnPO2  1=4, as obtained from the electrical measurements [2]. Obviously Eq. (4) predicts the slope to be zero if only V O is present,and to be )1/2 if all the vacancies were neutral. (In this case the result is more rigorous since the electrical field factor in Eq. (3) disappears.) Let us now interpret olnd=olnPO2 measured for n-CeO2d [A] and n-CeO2d [B] found to be )0.28 and )0.11, respectively. First of all, the non-zero dependencies suggest that the R is essentially determined by Aa s , i.e. we refer to case 2. The measured value of )0.28 for n-CeO2d [A] corre- sponds to e  0:9 which indicate that the majority defect in the sample is V Os with some minor frac- tion of V x O (the same is true then for the slope of )1/3 measured by Knauth and Tuller [10]), while the value of )0.11 for n-CeO2d [B] corresponding to e  1:5 suggesting the majority defects to be V Os and V Os. The slope of )1/2 measured by Porat et al.
[9], on the other hand, obviously corresponds to e  0, indicating the majority defect to be V x
O. As
already pointed out the scatter is not unexpected and may be even further interpreted in terms of experimental conditions.
In Fig. 4b the temperature dependence of d is shown (at PO2  15 Pa, positioning on the ordinate as in Figs. 3 and 4a). For both n-CeO2d, linear dependences of logd over 1=T are observed and their slopes correspond to 0.4 and 0.2 eV. A fur- ther evaluation is however not feasible in a straightforward way since the temperature depen- dence of Ks1 is unknown.
4. Conclusions
(1) Oxygen uptake/release from nanocrystalline ceria measured by thermogravimetric techniques under the conditions of interest for this study is found to be mainly due to surface nonstoichiom- etry rather than to bulk nonstoichiometry or molecular oxygen adsorption/desorption on the surface.
(2) The measured oxygen partial pressure dependencies of nonstoichiometry, varying from 0 to )1/2, for differently prepared nanocrystalline ceria powders can be explained by the presence of differently charged oxygen vacancies in addi- tion to charged impurities segregated onto the surface.
Appendix A If the PO2 dependence of the oxygen vacancy concentration follows a power law (V e O  / P n
O2 ,
regardless of the degree of ionization of the oxygen vacancy, see the text for the notation) and as long as we neglect oxygen excess, d becomes zero at infinitely large PO2 since V e O  becomes zero, i.e. all the isotherms asymptotically join at d  0 at infi- nitely large PO2. Owing to the electroneutrality equation, power laws typically result in the case of bulk materials, provided Boltzmann and Brouwer conditions (one ionization degree of the oxygen vacancy dominant) are fulfilled. As Eq. (4) shows,such a power law may also be valid for the vacancy concentration in a charged surface: Eq. (4) results in a power law if e remains constant over the PO2 range under consideration. As the results show,this is fulfilled for n-CeO2d [A]. Even if e is not constant, qualitatively the same behaviour should be observed as long as the overall vacancy con- centration falls monotonically with PO2 as sug- gested by the experimental data.
