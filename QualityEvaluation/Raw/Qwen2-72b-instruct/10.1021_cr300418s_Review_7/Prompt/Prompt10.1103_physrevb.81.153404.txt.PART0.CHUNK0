PACS numbers: 61.05.jh, 61.05.cp, 68.35.B, 68.47.Gh TiO211011 has emerged as the prototypical metal- oxide surface for fundamental studies in ultrahigh vacuum.1,2 A key element of the prominence of this substrate is a reli- able quantitative description of its stoichiometric geometric structure. Such knowledge has been derived in four contem- porary experimental studies,36 each using a different diffrac- tion technique, i.e., quantitative low-energy electron diffrac- tion
LEED-IV,3
medium energy ion scattering,4 photoelectron diffraction,5 and surface x-ray diffraction
SXRD.6 The four independently optimized structures re-
sulting from this body of work exhibit a high degree of agreement, demonstrating experimental consensus. Ab initio calculations, however, suggest that the atomic displacements determined from LEED-IV Ref. 3 may result from the lim- ited number of adjustable atomic layers employed during structure optimization.7,8 Here, we demonstrate otherwise,confirming the essential validity of both the previous LEED-IV Ref. 3 and SXRD Ref. 6 structure determina- tions.
Thompson and Lewis have employed density-functional theory DFT with the generalized gradient approximation GGA to calculate the surface energy and geometry of TiO211011.7,8 Calculations were performed using a se- ries of suitably oriented two-dimensional TiO2 slabs of in- creasing thickness to examine the impact of this parameter on both energetic and geometric convergence. Figure 1a displays a ball-and-stick model of one of these slabs, which is referred to as a five-trilayer slab in Refs. 7 and 8; the trilayer units are indicated in the figure. It should be noted that all of the slabs considered were centrosymmetric, result- ing in their upper and lower halves being equivalent, as in- dicated by the mirror plane in Fig. 1a. In accord with pre- vious work,9 it was concluded7,8 that a slab consisting of 13 trilayers is required to achieve a fully converged surface en- ergy, i.e., there is no significant variation in surface energy at greater slab thicknesses.
A
geometrically converged slab was attained by Thompson and Lewis at nine trilayers. Notably, this relaxed ab initio DFT-GGA geometry is not consistent with experi- mental work.36 There is, however, good coincidence be- tween the optimized geometry of a thinner, five-trilayer slab Fig. 1a and the optimized LEED-IV structure;3 the atoms adjusted in Ref. 3 during structure optimization are indicated in Fig. 1b. It is concluded that this agreement is a result of virtually the same atoms being optimized in both the five- trilayer slab total energy minimization and the LEED-IV structure determination, as can be discerned from Figs. 1a and 1b, remembering that a mirror plane is imposed in Fig. 1a. On this basis, Thompson and Lewis implicitly suggest that increasing the depth of the optimized selvedge may sig- nificantly alter the LEED-IV solution. In this Brief Report,this possibility is addressed by explicitly reanalyzing LEED-IV data collected from TiO211011 Ref. 3 as a function of depth into the selvedge. The SXRD data pre- sented in Ref. 6 are similarly re-examined. In both cases, the earlier optimized structures are validated, removing any am- biguity suggested in Refs. 7 and 8.
For this study, the LEED-IV and SXRD experimental data sets were identical to those analyzed previously.3,6 Surface- structure determination involved generating simulated dif- fraction data for a potential structure, and then iteratively optimizing the geometry to achieve the best fit between ex- perimental and simulated data. The same software packages that were used in Refs. 3 and 6 were employed for this pur-

1098-0121/2010/8115/1534044 2010 The American Physical Society 153404-1 pose, i.e., the Barberi-Van Hove Automated Tensor LEED code10 and the DL_LEED package11 for LEED-IV, and the ROD software12 for SXRD. Furthermore, the self-consistent phase shifts applied in Ref. 3 were again adopted for generating simulated LEED-IV data. Goodness of fit between experi- mental and simulated data was quantitatively assessed for LEED-IV and SXRD by the Pendry reliability factor Rp Ref. 13 and 2,14 respectively. For both the LEED-IV and SXRD analyses, all nonstructural parameters were con- strained to be the same as those used for generating the origi- nal best-fit simulated data,3,6 except for one LEED-IV pa- rameter, the inner potential, which was allowed to vary freely. As a check on the integrity of the analysis procedures,it was confirmed that the best fits were essentially identical to those obtained previously if the same parameters were employed LEED-IV: Rp=0.29 Ref. 3 and SXRD: 2=1.5 Ref. 6.
To investigate how the depth of the optimized selvedge impacts upon the LEED-IV/SXRD solutions, structure deter- minations have been performed as a function of the number of adjustable layers. The layers employed are depicted in Fig. 1c. As illustrated, the first layer consists simply of the so-called bridging oxygen atoms, whereas each of the deeper layers are composed of an upper Ti-O plane above an O bilayer. This layering scheme was chosen to allow direct comparison with the ab initio DFT-GGA slab calculations,7,8 as virtually the same atoms are optimized in n+1/2 LEED- IV/SXRD adjustable layers as in a calculated n-trilayer slab
N.B. Displacements of atoms lying on the mirror plane in-
dicated in Fig. 1a are symmetry forbidden during optimi- zation, expect for in-plane shifts of O8 and O8.. Fur- thermore, layers 1, 2, and 3 in Fig. 1c correspond to the atoms optimized in the original LEED-IV structure determi- nation Fig. 1b.3 Best fit Rps LEED-IV and 2s SXRD as a function of the number of adjustable layers are plotted in Fig. 2a. As evidenced by the decrease in Rp/2, it is clear that initially the fits improve considerably as the number of layers optimized increases. Beyond six optimized layers equivalent to an 11-trilayer calculated slab there is no fur- ther significant improvement in either Rp or 2, i.e., the fits become converged as regards this parameter.
Concerning the LEED-IV analysis, it is striking that the lowest Rp i.e., 0.23 is appreciably smaller than the value i.e., 0.29 obtained following optimization of only the atoms considered in the original structure determination.3 Table I lists the atomic displacements away from bulk termination for Rp=0.23 six-layer optimization, along with those pre- sented in Ref. 3 three-layer optimization. Differences LEED-IV between corresponding atomic displacements are also given. Not all LEED-IVs are 0, which is expected from the observed decrease in Rp. However, there are no signifi- cant discrepancies between the two optimum structures as all LEED-IVs are within experimental error. The least insignifi- cant LEED-IVs are for the vertical and lateral displacements of O2, namely, 0.080.11 and 0.070.20 Å, respec- tively. We have explored the possibility that these relatively large LEED-IVs are a result of correlation between these two parameters but have found no evidence to support this idea.
Also listed in Table I are the atomic displacements asso- ciated with the converged six-layer SXRD optimization.

153404-2 should be pointed out that these displacements are identical to those presented in the original
SXRD
structure determination,6 as the same atoms were optimized in both cases, although the displacements of deeper atoms were not explicitly stated in Ref. 6. As already discussed in Refs. 2 and 6, the agreement between the optimum LEED-IV and SXRD structures is impressive, especially as many of the atomic displacements have been determined rather precisely.
As regards precision, one further point to glean from Table I is that the LEED-IV error bars increase much more rapidly with depth than those associated with the SXRD measure- ments. This phenomenon is to be expected given the greater surface sensitivity of LEED.
On the basis of the above results, it is clear that the origi- nal optimum atomic displacements determined for TiO211011 from LEED-IV data3 are not erroneous due to the limited depth of the optimized surface selvedge. It is not disputed that adjusting too few atoms can influence the outcome of such a structure determination. However, this is not the case in Ref. 3. These two points are demonstrated graphically in Fig. 2b, which displays the displacement of two surface atoms, O1 bridging oxygen and Ti2 five- fold titanium, as a function of the number of optimized lay- ers. There are three plots for each atom, showing the dis- placements obtained from LEED-IV solid circle markers, SXRD solid square markers, and ab initio DFT-GGA cal- culations crosses7,8 N.B. To plot the theoretically derived displacements on the same x axis the near equivalence, in terms of adjustable atoms, of n+1/2 LEED-IV/SXRD lay- ers and an ab initio calculated n trilayer slab was employed.

Atomic displacements away from bulk-terminated TiO211011 obtained from analysis of LEED-IV data optimizing three layers Ref. 3 reanalysis of the same LEED-IV data optimizing six layers current work, and analysis of SXRD data again optimizing six layers Ref. 6 current work. Also listed are differences LEED-IV between corresponding atomic displacements for the two LEED-IV determinations. Figure 1c shows both the layering scheme and the identity of the atoms. A negative value indicates that the atom moves toward the bulk for a displacement perpendicular to the surface plane, and in the 11 0 direction for a lateral displacement. N.B. In Ref. 6,the SXRD derived displacement of O7 is erroneously given as 0.010.04 Å. The value of this parameter should be 0.000.04 Å, as stated here.

PHYSICAL REVIEW B 81, 153404 2010
153404-3 For clarity, an upper x axis showing the corresponding num- ber of trilayers is included in the figure. Focusing on the experimentally derived data, it can be seen that for both O1 and Ti2 displacement becomes almost constant for three- layer optimization and beyond. For one- and two-layer opti- mizations, the displacement of O1 obtained from LEED-IV,in particular, varies significantly.
Figure 2b also shows that the converged ab initio DFT- GGA displacements of both O1 and Ti2 Refs. 7 and 8 are not consistent with experiment. Moreover, it is almost certain that the reported7,8 coincidence of the five-trilayer ab initio DFT geometry and the original LEED-IV solution three-layer optimization shown in Fig. 2b is simply for- tuitous. We note that other ab initio DFT calculations of the geometric structure of TiO211011, employing slightly different approximations, more closely match the experimen- tal structural solution.15,16 The extreme sensitivity of the computed structure to adopted approximations has previ- ously been analyzed in terms of soft vibrational modes both in the bulk17 and at the 110 surface.18 Finally, Thompson and Lewis propose that optimized sur- face geometries, either computed or experimental, should be reported in terms of bond lengths and bond angles rather than atomic displacements.8 They argue that this approach would present the structure in terms of more physically rel- evant quantities. While it is clear one can simply translate atomic displacements into bond lengths and angles, we do agree that for some purposes explicit listing of these latter parameters would give more immediate insight. Thus, a list of bond lengths and bond angles between selected atoms are given in Table II.
In summary, LEED-IV and SXRD data acquired from TiO211011 have been reanalysed to confirm the reli- ability of the original structure determinations.3,6 More spe- cifically, prompted by ab initio DFT-GGA calculations7,8 structural optimization has been performed as a function of depth into the selvedge. This present study validates the pre- vious structural solutions.3,6 This work was funded by grants from the EPSRC U.K., MCINN Spain under Projects No. CSD2007-00041 and No. MAT2009-09308, and the EU COST 41 Programme. *Corresponding author.
