Strong interactions between palladium and the ceria support stabilize oxidized Pdd+ species, which may contrib- ute to the significant activity of Pd/ceria for methane oxidation. We present a density functional theory (DFT + U) investigation into methane oxidation over Pd/ceria and quantify the activity of the PdxCe1xO2(1 1 1) mixed oxide surface in comparison with the PdO(1 0 0) and Pd(1 1 1) surfaces.

Subsequent reaction steps in complete oxidation, including product desorption and vacancy refilling, are considered to substantiate that meth- ane activation remains the rate-limiting step despite the low barrier over PdxCe1xO2(1 1 1). The low bar- rier over the PdxCe1xO2(1 1 1) surface demonstrates that mixed ceria-noble metal oxides offer the potential for improved hydrocarbon oxidation performance with respect to dispersed noble metal parti- cles on ceria. 2010 Elsevier Inc.

1. Introduction
Ceria offers unique properties as a heterogeneous catalyst sup- port or active component, of which the redox properties [14] and methane oxidation activity [5,6] can be altered by the addition of low levels of noble metals such as palladium. The oxidation state and morphology of Pd species on Pd/ceria are a function of preparation method [5,712] and catalytic operating conditions [7,1214]. Palladium can be supported on ceria as metal particles [12,15] or PdOx species [8,11,16], and strong interactions between Pd and the ceria support may stabilize a surface mixed oxide phase (PdxCe1xOy) [5,13,17]. Each of the chemically distinct Pd species on Pd/ceria likely provides unique catalytic activity; however,which sites contribute to the significant activity for methane oxi- dation are unclear. Computational methods have been used to probe the relative stability of Pd species on ceria [5,13] and to eval- uate elementary reaction energies for methane oxidation over pure CeO2 [18]; however, the catalytic activity of ceria-supported Pd species has not been investigated. We present a computational investigation, utilizing density functional theory, into methane complete oxidation over the CeO2(1 1 1), PdxCe1xO2(1 1 1), and PdO(1 0 0) surfaces, in comparison with CH activation on Pd me- tal surfaces. The reaction barrier for methane oxidation is lowest over the PdxCe1xO2(1 1 1) surface, suggesting that this Pd/ceria surface mixed oxide provides unusually high catalytic activity.
Our results detail the rate-determining steps and stable intermedi- ates for methane oxidation over each surface.
The oxidation state of palladium and the morphology of the pal- ladium surface are strongly a function of catalytic operating condi- tions, which complicates characterization efforts to elucidate the nature of the active site for methane oxidation. Ex situ character- ization can be used to determine the Pd oxidation state before and after reaction; however, these efforts illustrate further the complexity in determining the structure and functionality of the active phase. Hoflund et al. report ELS and XPS spectroscopy results which show that PdO forms during methane combustion on palla- dium powder [19]. The bulk transition for PdO decomposition to Pd occurs at approximately 1070 K in 1 atm O2 [20]; however, oxida- tion of small Pd particles may occur at lower temperatures. Ribeiro et al. show that PdO decomposes to Pd at 907 K in 1.5 torr O2, and that this transition results in an order of magnitude drop in the methane combustion turnover rate [21]. Thus, depending upon the temperature and oxygen pressure, Pd or PdO species may be stable, with dramatic effects on catalytic activity. For Pd on ceria,the dependence of the stable surface structure and oxidation state on reaction conditions is even more complex, as Pd, PdO, or PdxCe1xOy may be stable during reaction.
The morphology and oxidation state of Pd on ceria are both strong functions of synthesis and pretreatment methods, and strong interactions between Pd and ceria stabilize oxidized Pd 0021-9517/$ - see front matter  2010 Elsevier Inc.

X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) showed that Pd/ ceria prepared by depositionprecipitation had a higher concentra- tion of cationic Pdd+ sites than Pd/ceria prepared by wet impregna- tion [8]. Preparation of Pd/ceria by solution-combustion synthesis methods can facilitate mixing of Pd atoms into the CeO2 lattice framework [5,17]. A combination of XPS, X-ray diffraction (XRD),and extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) results was used to determine that Pd/ceria prepared by solution-combustion synthesis contains Pd2+ cations incorporated into cubic fluorite CeO2 as a solid solution, whereas wet impregnation results in sam- ples containing primarily metallic Pd [17]. Colussi et al. also re- cently reported that surface solid solutions of Pd2+/CeOx with distinct short and long range order can be prepared by solution- combustion synthesis [5]. High-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) and DFT calculations confirm that their Pd2+/CeOx samples consist of a reconstructed CeO2(1 1 0) surface with Pd2+ ions substituted for Ce4+ [5].
Palladium is an active catalyst for methane oxidation [19,21],and the interaction between Pd and a ceria support facilitates un- ique oxidation activity [5]. The oxidation rate on Pd/ceria exceeds the rate over pure ceria, with particularly high catalytic activity displayed by Pd/ceria catalysts containing oxidized Pdd+ species or PdOCe linkages. For the direct oxidation of methane in a solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC), the addition of 1 wt.% Pd to a pure ceria an- ode increased the maximum power density by a factor of 10 [6].
The rate of methane combustion on Pd2+/CeOx mixed surface oxi- des of 1 and 1.71 wt.% Pd was nearly twice that of Pd/ceria samples of equivalent composition prepared by incipient wetness [5]. De- spite numerous studies illustrating the catalytic activity of Pd/ceria for methane oxidation, characterization of active sites is chal- lenged by the heterogeneity of the metal/metal oxide structure and structural changes which may occur during reaction. The com- putational chemistry methods utilized herein probe the catalytic activity of CeO2, PdxCe1xO2, PdO, and Pd to isolate the contribu- tions of each to the overall oxidation performance of Pd/ceria catalysts.
Computational chemistry methods can directly evaluate the rel- ative energies of elementary reaction steps and activation barriers on heterogeneous supported catalysts; however, applying these methods to study catalytic reactions on ceria has been limited to the consideration of simple redox reaction mechanisms. Previous computational studies of hydrocarbon chemistry on ceria have fo- cused on evaluating elementary reaction energies for CO oxidation [18,22,23] and H2/H2O cycling [24,25] on pure CeO2, as well as CO oxidation on CeO2 doped with single transition metal atoms such as Au, Ag, Cu [26], and Zr [27]. The structural changes that result from doping as well as the effects of doping on reducibility have also been investigated using DFT methods for noble metal atoms such as Pd [28] and Pt [29]. Knapp et al. evaluated the reaction en- ergy diagram for methane combustion to
CO2
over pure CeO2(1 1 1) [18], though the reaction energetics in the presence of added transition or noble metals was not considered. Herein,we report the reaction energetics for the oxidation of CH4 to CO2 over Pd/ceria to establish a complete methane oxidation cycle and quantify changes in catalytic activity upon formation of PdxCe1xO2. We compare the reaction energetics over CeO2(1 1 1) and PdxCe1xO2(1 1 1) to those over PdO(1 0 0) and Pd to distin- guish the catalytic activity of the Pd/ceria mixed oxide from that of other Pd species.
Our previous study used ab initio thermodynamics to evaluate the stability of different Pd species on CeO2(1 1 1), (1 1 0), and (1 0 0) surfaces.
Under varying operating conditions,the PdxCe1xO2(1 1 1) surface is stable with respect to other single atom states of Pd on the CeO2(1 1 1) surface [13]. The oxygen va- cancy formation energy on PdxCe1xO2(1 1 1) is less endothermic than on CeO2(1 1 1), and the methane activation barrier is lower over PdxCe1xO2(1 1 1) than over CeO2(1 1 1). This work utilizes density functional theory to calculate the reaction free energies of elementary steps in methane oxidation over CeO2(1 1 1), PdxCe1xO2(1 1 1), and PdO(1 0 0) in comparison with CH activa- tion on Pd metal sites. These models represent the surface facets of a pure ceria (CeO2(1 1 1)),palladium/ceria mixed oxide (PdxCe1xO2(1 1 1)),or palladium oxide (PdO(1 0 0)) particle,respectively. Evaluation of the oxidation mechanism over each of these surfaces facilitates comparison between the catalytic activity of Pd/ceria mixed oxides, PdO, and Pd metal. Regardless of the ini- tial oxidation state, the oxidation state of Pd cycles between either Pd0/Pd2+ or Pd2+/Pd4+ during the full reaction turnover of methane oxidation. We report the activation barriers, rate-determining steps, and stable intermediates for methane oxidation over each surface, with discussion of adsorption sites and adsorbate geome- tries. We use ab initio thermodynamics to evaluate the dependence of rate-determining steps and the overall reaction mechanism on catalytic operating conditions including temperature and partial pressure of reactants and products. We specifically consider oper- ating regimes corresponding to catalytic combustion experiments and SOFC operation.
2. Methods
2.1. Electronic structure method
Calculations were made using the Vienna ab initio simulation program (VASP), an ab initio total-energy and molecular dynamics program developed at the Institute for Material Physics at the Uni- versity of Vienna [3032]. The projector augmented wave method [33] was used to represent the core region, with valence electron wavefunctions expanded in a tractable plane wave basis set. The energy cutoffs of the plane wave basis sets used herein were 400 eV, 450 eV, and 500 eV for Pd metal, CeO2, and PdO, respec- tively (chosen to ensure convergence of total energy with respect to energy cutoff). Valence configurations were 5s25p66s24f15d1 for cerium, 2s22p4 for oxygen, 4d10 for Pd, 2s22p2 for C, and 1s1 for H. Structural optimizations were performed by minimizing the forces on all atoms to below 0.05 eV Å1, and all calculations for CeO2 and PdO were spin-polarized.
The PerdewWang (PW91) version of the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) was used to incorporate exchange and correlation energies [34].
Due to well-established difficulties within DFT to accurately represent the nature of 4f states in ceria [3537], we implemented the DFT + U approach. The DFT + U method introduces the Hubbard U term as an on-site Coulombic interaction in the f states of ceria,which properly localizes electrons in these states for reduced ceria structures (CeO2x, or more generally Ce3 x Ce4 1xOy). We do not di- rectly consider ceria surfaces reduced by oxygen vacancies herein;however, our previous study illustrated that the adsorption of H atoms and CH3 groups on pure CeO2 reduces surface Ce4+ cations to Ce3+ [38]. We used a value of U = 5 eV, which is consistent with recommended values within the DFT + U method used in previous studies of ceria [18,28,3942]. Our previous study included evalu- ation of the dependence of methane activation and oxygen vacancy formation on the value of the Hubbard U term on CeO2 and PdxCe1xO2. For pure CeO2, the vacancy formation energy and methane adsorption energy increase in exothermicity linearly with increasing U value (DEvac and DEads are proportional to 0.4DU (eV)) [38]. Given the dependence of vacancy formation energy and adsorption energy on the U value for pure ceria, the quantitative values we calculate are inherently dependent on our specific choice of U value. For PdxCe1xO2, the vacancy formation energy and methane adsorption energy become less exothermic with increasing U value, however, with much less dependence on U

17 value than for pure ceria as Pd4+ is reduced rather than Ce4+ (DEvac and DEads are proportional to 0.05DU (eV)) [38]. We use a U value of 5 eV to accurately describe the electronic structure of reduced ceria, and the qualitative comparisons of reaction energies we re- port over PdxCe1xO2 and Pd or PdO are not sensitive to the Ce 4f U value.
2.2. Surface models
Fig. 1 displays the slab models used for the CeO2(1 1 1), PdxCe1xO2 (1 1 1), and PdO(1 0 0). The mirrored slab model in- cludes symmetrical adsorbates on both sides of the slab. The ceria surface is modeled as a 12-layer (Ce16O32) mirrored slab of the (1 1 1) termination of cubic fluorite CeO2 separated by 15 Å of vac- uum in the direction perpendicular to the surface. The surface en- ergy of CeO2(1 1 1) is lowest among single crystal terminations of ceria [3840], indicating that this surface termination will repre- sent a large portion of a polycrystalline CeO2 surface. The mirrored slab model of the ceria surface was used specifically to minimize slab-to-slab interactions that may result from a large net surface dipole moment upon the interaction of the surface with adsorbates and the reduction in surface metal ions. The Brillouin zone was sampled using a (2  2  1) MP grid for the (1 1 1) surface, with the third vector perpendicular to the surface. We use a p(2  2) expansion of the surface unit cell, which results in a termination of four surface oxygen atoms on each side of the slab and four Ce atoms in the atomic layer below.
The PdO(1 0 0) surface was modeled as a slab of tetragonal pal- ladium (II) oxide (PdO), respectively, also separated by 15 Å of vac- uum in the direction perpendicular to the surface. The lattice parameters of bulk PdO were optimized within 2% of the corre- sponding experimentally determined value [43,44]. We used a 9- layer mirrored slab with a (2  1) expansion to model the PdO(1 0 0) surface, with all layers allowed to relax during struc- tural optimizations. Scheffler et al. used DFT and ab initio thermo- dynamics to show that the surface formation energy of the (1 0 0) termination of PdO is less endergonic than all other single crystal terminations of PdO at O2 pressures above 1030 atm at 300 K [45], motivating its use in this study.
Methane activation barriers are also reported over Pd(1 1 1) and Pd/CeO2 model systems to provide comparison to the Pd0 oxida- tion state. Description of these models is included in the Supple- mentary material.
2.3. Reaction free energies
Reaction intermediates for methane oxidation over each surface were optimized by placing one adsorbate of the formula C1HxOy (with 0 6 x 6 2 and 0 6 y 6 2), or an isolated H atom adsorbate,in each surface unit cell. For each C1HxOy adsorbate, the O in C1HxOy corresponds to oxygen bound to the carbon atom which is not lattice oxygen of the stoichiometric surface. Each adsorbate was placed at all high symmetry adsorption sites and configura- tions on each surface, and the lowest energy adsorption configura- tion for each adsorbatesurface pair was used to calculate the relative energies of elementary reaction steps. Using one adsorbate per unit cell results in a relatively low coverage of reaction inter- mediates. For example, H on CeO2(1 1 1) consists of an H atom ad- sorbed atop one of the four surface oxygen atoms in the unit cell,corresponding to an effective H coverage of 25%. Therefore, reac- tion energies and analysis reported herein approximate the low coverage limit for methane oxidation. Harmonic vibrational modes were calculated to determine zero-point vibrational energy (ZPVE) corrections to the total energy of isolated molecules and adsorbed species. Optimizations of isolated gas-phase molecules were per- formed with one free molecule within a 15  15  15 Å unit cell.
The free energies of gas-phase molecules and surface adsorbates were calculated as the sum of the electronic energy (EDFT), ZPVE correction, entropy (ST), and a pressure volume term (PV) as follows: Ggas  EDFT  ZPVE  Svib  Strans  Srot  SelecT  PV 1 For surface adsorbates, translational and rotational entropy terms are zero, and the electronic term is included only for gas-phase oxy- gen. Constrained vibrational calculations were done for adsorbed species, where the Hessian matrix is populated solely with the sec- ond derivatives of energy with respect to position of the adsorbate atoms. Configurational entropies of adsorbed species were ne- glected as they are less than 0.02 eV in all cases. Free energy differ- ences for elementary reaction steps were calculated by subtracting the sum of free energies of the initial state from the sum of free energies of the product state, as follows for the example of CH3 dis- sociation to adsorbed CH2 and H fragments (CH

where GCH 2; GH, and GCH 3 represent the free energies of adsorbed CH2, H, and CH3 species, respectively, and Gbare is the DFT energy of the bare surface. The denominator of two is included in Eq. (2) for energies calculated over the CeO2(1 1 1), PdO(1 0 0), Pd/ CeO2(1 1 1), and PdxCe1xO2(1 1 1) surfaces to account for the fact that mirrored slab models are used with one adsorbate on each side of the mirrored slab. Partial oxidation as well as total combustion pathways involving CH breaking, OH forming, and CO forming steps were considered over the various surface models.
To evaluate the minimum energy path for methane oxidation CH4  2O2 ! CO2  2H2O over each surface, we also considered the formation energy of CO2(g) and H2O(g) from reaction interme- diates. Water is formed by adsorption of H atoms on surface oxy- gen atoms followed by desorption of H2O(g) to leave a surface oxygen vacancy. The formation energy of H2O(g) from H was cal- culated on the CeO2(1 1 1), PdxCe1xO2(1 1 1), and PdO(1 0 0) sur- faces, as: DGH2O formation  2  GH2O  Gvacant  Gbare  2  GH 2 3 where GH is the free energy of adsorbed H (Eq. (1)), GH2O is the free energy of H2O(g) (Eq. (1)), and Gvacant is the DFT energy of the sur- face containing an oxygen vacancy on each side of the mirrored slab. Water formation steps are included in the reaction energy dia- grams reported herein as elementary steps immediately following CH breaking steps which result in H formation. For example, we consider the following three elementary steps for the dissociation of CH3 to CH2 CH 3  1 4 O2g ! CH 2  1 2 H2Og

The consideration of product formation and vacancy filling sequentially throughout the mechanism can be contrasted with the approach of Knapp et al. [18]. Knapp et al. included all water formation energies at the final step and neglected vacancy filling in their analysis of the reaction energy diagram for methane oxida- tion over pure CeO2(1 1 1). The authors report that the final step in the catalytic cycle for total methane oxidation over CeO2(1 1 1) is 4H ! 2H2Og  2V O with DE  4:6 eV [18]. Their analysis of methane oxidation does not consider the complete catalytic cycle by neglecting oxygen vacancy filling and implies that the rate- determining step for methane oxidation over ceria is water forma- tion with an apparent barrier of nearly 450 kJ/mol (+4.6 eV). Our method of incorporating elementary steps for water formation into the reaction energy diagram for methane oxidation represents con- tinuous water formation from H during the overall reaction.
2.4. Methane activation barriers
The majority of our analysis compares elementary reaction energies between surfaces. Activation barriers were computed for only CH bond activation of methane. We do not calculate energy barriers for any reaction step following methane activation, as Knapp et al. show that the energy barrier for each CH breaking step subsequent to methane activation is lower than the barrier for methane activation over the clean CeO2(1 1 1) surface [18].
We use a 3  3 unit cell to calculate the methane activation barrier on Pd(1 1 1) to accommodate both CH3 and H within the unit cell.
The climbing image nudged elastic band method (CI-NEB) [4648] was used to isolate transition states and calculate reaction energy barriers for methane activation CH4g ! CH 3  H. Within the CI-NEB method, a sequence of images along the reaction path are optimized with the highest energy image required to climb up in energy along the elastic band to estimate the saddle point along the minimum energy path [47]. Four equally spaced images be- tween reactant and product states were used in each search (six images total), and transition states were identified as the maxi- mum energy image with an absolute tangential force of less than
0.04 eV Å1.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Reaction free energy diagrams for methane oxidation
The reaction free energy of each elementary step in methane oxidation over each surface is calculated at 0 K as well as at cata- lytic combustion conditions. Each reaction free energy diagram presented herein is calculated at T = 298 K and PCH4 = 0.01 atm, PO2 = 0.04 atm, PH2O = PCO2 = 106 atm, to represent typical experi- mental catalytic combustion conditions at 0% conversion [8,49].
Reaction free energies are calculated at T = 298 K as this tempera- ture corresponds to the low conversion (low T) region of the meth- ane oxidation light-off curve over CeO2 [49,50]. The methane activation barriers displayed in each reaction free energy diagram are calculated as the Gibbs free energy of activation (DzG) at these catalytic combustion conditions, relative to the free energy of CH4(g): DzG  GTSGCH4g  G 4 In each reaction energy diagram presented herein, intermediate energies are referenced to the free energy of CH4(g) + 2O2(g). Table 1 displays the barriers at 0 K (Eact) and the standard Gibbs free en- ergy of activation DzG0 (at 273 K and PCH4 = 1.0 atm) for methane activation on each surface. Table 2 displays the reaction free ener- gies for each step in methane oxidation at 0 K. Adsorption geome- tries for all adsorbates on each surface are provided in the
