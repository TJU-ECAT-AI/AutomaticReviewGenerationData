I'm going to give you a scientific literature. Then I'm going to ask you some questions about it. I'd like you to first write down exact quotes of parts of the document word by word that would help answer the question, and then I'd like you to answer the question using facts from the quoted content. Do not omit any relevant information from the text, and avoid introducing any falsehoods or assumptions that aren't directly supported by the literature. Here is the literature, in <literature></literature> XML tags:

nature materials  VOL 9  MARCH 2010  www.nature.com/naturematerials 185 news & views increasing length and time scales7,8, leading to the so-called critical slowing down of the magnetic response.
From the model, it emerges that ferromagnets can be divided into type I and type II for high and low values of TC/μat,respectively. When a laser pulse hits the sample of a type I material it creates an excitation, increasing the temperature of the electron system. Strong spin scattering ensures fast equilibration of the spin and electron system. This behaviour is found for Ni, Fe and Co where the demagnetization follows the electron temperature.
In type II materials, with a low ratio of TC/μat,  and therefore weaker magnetic coupling  after the laser pulse hits the sample, a very fast demagnetization in the first picosecond is followed by a slower demagnetization (Fig. 1). This two-step process is a consequence of the different temperature of the electron system in the first picosecond and thereafter. It is found for the cases of Gd and FeTb that the width of the first step is in the order of picoseconds. The two-step demagnetization occurs regardless of the precise value of asf, although a smaller value makes it more apparent. An interesting observation is that by increasing the laser fluence or increasing the ambient temperature, in an intermediate range even type I materials show a double- step behaviour and can be converted to type II materials.
As well as explaining this different demagnetization dynamics, Koopmans and coauthors tried to understand the origin of the elementary femtosecond spin-scattering mechanism, following a previous proposal by some of the same authors9. As the electron moves through the positively charged atom cores, its spin experiences the action of a magnetic field in its coordinate frame along its orbit, known as the spinorbit interaction. One of the consequences of spinorbit coupling in the solid-state material is that in some points of the Fermi surface the spin is not well defined and consists of a mixture of the dominant spin direction and a small part of the opposite one10. If an electron is scattered into such points by a phonon for example,there is a probability that the spin flips (Fig. 2a). This process is called ElliottYafet scattering11. Assuming this mechanism, Koopmans and coauthors estimated the values of asf for Ni and Co by ab initio calculations, and found that these values agreed very well with those used to describe the demagnetization curves.
The progress towards a quantitative understanding of demagnetization will make femtosecond magnetization dynamics a valuable tool for materials characterization without the need for electrical contacts.
Mller et al.5 already showed that it is possible to relate the spin polarization P to the spin-flip scattering asf, which is suppressed in highly spin-polarized half-metals. The full description given by Koopmans and coauthors allows for the prediction of the quantitative response of a ferromagnetic material characterized by asf and TC/μat. Future studies will focus also on the exchange spin-flip processes (Fig. 2b) that may be dominant at the first stages after excitation. Furthermore, they may explain how the elementary excitation of a ferromagnet, that is a spin-flipped electron,surrounded by electrons of opposite spin direction (known as Stoner excitation) decays into spin-waves8.

First, you need to sequentially extract any quotes in the literature that are most relevant to each question, and print them in numbered order, separated by newlines. Quotes should be relatively brief. Do not attempt to summarize or answer questions at this stage, but simply repeat exactly what the corresponding part of the literature says.

Please enclose the full list of quotes in <quotes></quotes> XML tags. If there are no relevant quotes, write "No relevant quotes" instead.

Then, answer the question, starting with "Answer:".  Do not include or reference quoted content verbatim in the answer. Don't say "According to Quote [1]" when answering. Do not write reference number of quotes after answer. Put your answer to the user inside <EnglishVersionAnswer></EnglishVersionAnswer> XML tags. Output formatted text, with line breaks for each question.Separate quotes and answers with a blank line. Provide the answers to all questions in English. After completing the English answers, translate all those answers into Chinese and provide the Chinese version inside <ChineseVersionAnswer></ChineseVersionAnswer> XML tags.

Thus, the format of your overall response should look like what's shown between the <example></example> tags.  Make sure to follow the formatting and spacing exactly.
