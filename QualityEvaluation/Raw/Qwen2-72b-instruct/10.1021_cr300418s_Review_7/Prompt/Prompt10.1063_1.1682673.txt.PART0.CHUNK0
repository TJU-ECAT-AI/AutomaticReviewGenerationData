Van de Wallea) Palo Alto Research Center, 3333 Coyote Hill Road, Palo Alto, California 94304 Jo rg Neugebauer Universita t Paderborn, Fakulta t fu r Naturwissenschaften, Warburger Str. 100, D-33095 Paderborn, Germany Received 14 July 2003; accepted 26 January 2004!
First-principles calculations have evolved from mere aids in explaining and supporting experiments to powerful tools for predicting new materials and their properties. In the first part of this review we describe the state-of-the-art computational methodology for calculating the structure and energetics of point defects and impurities in semiconductors. We will pay particular attention to computational aspects which are unique to defects or impurities, such as how to deal with charge states and how to describe and interpret transition levels. In the second part of the review we will illustrate these capabilities with examples for defects and impurities in nitride semiconductors. Point defects have traditionally been considered to play a major role in wide-band-gap semiconductors, and first-principles calculations have been particularly helpful in elucidating the issues. Specifically,calculations have shown that the unintentional n-type conductivity that has often been observed in as-grown GaN cannot be attributed to nitrogen vacancies, but is due to unintentional incorporation of donor impurities. Native point defects may play a role in compensation and in phenomena such as the yellow luminescence, which can be attributed to gallium vacancies. In the section on impurities, specific attention will be focused on dopants. Oxygen, which is commonly present as a contaminant, is a shallow donor in GaN but becomes a deep level in AlGaN due to a DX transition.
Magnesium is almost universally used as the p-type dopant, but hole concentrations are still limited.
Reasons for this behavior are discussed, and alternative acceptors are examined. Hydrogen plays an important role in p-type GaN, and the mechanisms that underlie its behavior are explained.
Incorporating hydrogen along with acceptors is an example of codoping; a critical discussion of codoping is presented. Most of the information available to date for defects and impurities in nitrides has been generated for GaN, but we will also discuss AlN and InN where appropriate. We conclude by summarizing the main points and looking towards the future.  2004 American Institute of Physics. @DOI: 10.1063/1.1682673#

I. INTRODUCTION
A. Goals
The properties of materials are often controlled by de- fects and impurities. This is particularly true in the case of semiconductors, where the incorporation of impurities in small concentrations determines the electrical conductivity.
The fabrication of p-type and n-type doped layers underlies the design of virtually all electronic and optoelectronic de- vices. To achieve such control, comprehensive knowledge of the fundamental processes that control doping is required. In recent years, first-principles calculations have made impor- tant contributions to this knowledge.
Thanks to algorithmic developments as well as increases in computer power, first-principles calculations are now reaching unprecedented levels of accuracy in treating in- creasingly larger systems at the microscopic level. State-of- the-art calculations for solids are based on density-functional theory and produce detailed information about atomic struc- ture including relaxations!, wave functions, charge densi- ties, potentials, and energies. All of these data can be used to elucidate the properties of impurities and point defects, as will be illustrated with many examples in this review. The aspect that we will focus on most closely, and that has proved crucial in relation to studying doping, is the forma- tion energy of point defects. We will describe a formalism that allows calculation of defect and impurity concentrations based on first-principles formation energies; this formalism also addresses the energetics of charge states, and hence the thermodynamic transition levels associated with deep and shallow impurities and defects.
The formalism is entirely general in nature and could be applied to any semiconductor or insulator. The goal of the first part of the article Sec. II! is to provide an overview of the state-of-the-art methodology for performing first- principles calculations for defects and impurities. The aim is not to address the fundamentals of density-functional or pseudopotential theory, or to provide a guide on how to run first-principles computer codesvarious excellent reviews are available for that purpose.13 Rather, we intend Sec. II to be useful for a computational theorist getting started in de- fect calculations, as well as for more experienced practitio- ners looking for a reference to some of the details that are important in practical calculations. In addition, this section is intended to be accessible to experimentalists who are curious about the background of the computational work or have questions about some of the underlying assumptions.
The methodology described in Sec. II will be illustrated with specific examples in the latter half of the review. We will focus on one specific material system, namely, the IIIV nitrides. Two Applied Physics Reviews have recently ap- peared that cover this set of materials. One, by Vurgaftman and Meyer,4 presents a comprehensive compilation of band parameters for all of the nitrogen-containing IIIV semicon- ductors that have been investigated to date. The second, by Bhuiyan et al.,5 reviews the growth, characterization, and properties of InN and contains a brief discussion of defects.
In the present article we focus on the properties of defects and impurities in III-nitrides. Section III contains results for native defects, while Sec. IV describes impurities. A review of computational studies on GaN by Estreicher and Boucher6 covered developments through 1995, but much has happened since then.
In the remainder of this Introduction we provide some additional motivation for defect studies in nitrides, an impor- tant issue being the realization of adequate doping. We there- fore also provide a discussion of doping limitations in semi- conductors in general.
B. Doping problems in nitrides
Within the past decade the nitride semiconductors have emerged as a very important materials system because they are uniquely suited to light emission in the green, blue, and UV regions of the spectrumwavelength regions that were previously not accessible with solid-state light emitters. 3852

Reuse of AIP content is subject to the terms at: http://jap.aip.org/about/rights_and_permissions n-type doping of nitrides has never been a problem; in fact,as-grown material has often exhibited unintentional n-type conductivity, the cause of which was widely debated. n-type doping with electron concentrations exceeding 1019 cm23 can routinely be achieved. p-type doping, however, has tra- ditionally been very difficult. p-type doping was first achieved by Amano et al. in 1989,7 who observed that Mg- doped GaN grown by MOCVD metal-organic chemical va- por deposition! was highly resistive after growth, but could be activated by low-energy electron beam irradiation. Naka- mura et al.8 subsquently showed that the Mg activation can also be achieved by thermal annealing at 700 C under N2 ambient. Nakamura et al. further observed that the process was reversible, with p-type GaN reverting to semi-insulating when annealed in a NH3 ambient, revealing the crucial role played by hydrogen. Since then, hole concentrations on the order of 1018 cm23 have been achieved and used in devices.
Still, the limited conductivity of p-type doped layers consti- tutes an impediment for progress in device applications.
C. Fundamental causes of doping limitations
When discussing doping of semiconductors, and its in- herent limitations and difficulties, a number of factors need to be considered. Here we enumerate them and illustrate them with the example of p-type doping of GaN.
1. Solubility
To achieve a high free-carrier concentration, one obvi- ously needs to achieve a high concentration of the dopant impurity. The solubility corresponds to the maximum con- centration that the impurity can attain in the semiconductor,under conditions of thermodynamic equilibrium. This con- centration depends on temperature, and on the abundance of the impurity as well as the host constituents in the growth environment. Increasing the abundance of the impurity or its chemical potential, see Sec. II E! does not necessarily in- crease the concentration of impurities incorporated in the solid, because it may become more favorable for the impu- rity to form a different phase. For instance, we will see that the solubility of Mg in GaN is limited by formation of Mg3N2 see Sec. II E!. In previous work on wide-band-gap semiconductors, it was found that the hole concentration in ZnSe and ZnTe is limited by the solubility of the acceptor impurities Na, Li, and N!.9
2. Ionization energy
The ionization energy of a dopant determines the frac- tion of dopants that will contribute free carriers at a given temperature. A high ionization energy limits the doping effi- ciency: for instance, the ionization energy of Mg in GaN around 200 meV! is so large that at room temperature only about 1% of Mg atoms are ionized. This means that a Mg concentration of 1020 cm23 only leads to a hole concentra- tion of about 1018 cm23. Ionization energies are largely de- termined by intrinsic properties of the semiconductor, such as effective masses, dielectric constant, etc. Switching to a different acceptor has therefore no dramatic effect on the ionization energy.
3. Incorporation of impurities in other configurations
In order for Mg in GaN to act as an acceptor, it needs to be incorporated on the gallium site. There has been concern about Mg incorporating in other positions in the lattice, such as an interstitial position, or substituting for a nitrogen atom essentially an antisite configuration!. For GaN:Mg GaN doped with Mg!, we have shown that these other configura- tions are always much higher in energy, and hence will not form.10 In other cases, however, such competition may be a serious issue: for instance, while Li on the Ga site in GaN forms an acceptor, Li on an interstitial site is a donor, and because of its small size it is energetically very favorable.11 This can obviously lead to serious self-compensation.
Another instance of impurities incorporating in undesir- able configurations consists of the so-called DX centers. The prototype DX center is Si in AlGaAs for a review, see Ref. 12!. In GaAs and in AlGaAs with low Al content, Si behaves as a shallow donor. But when the Al content exceeds a criti- cal value, Si behaves as a deep level. This has been ex- plained in terms of Si moving off the substitutional site, to- wards an interstitial position.13 It has been found that oxygen forms a DX center in AlGaN, when the Al content exceeds about 30%.14 This prediction has been confirmed experimentally.15
4. Compensation by native point defects
Native defects are point defects intrinsic to the semicon- ductor, such as vacancies missing atoms!, self-interstitials additional atoms incorporated on sites other than substitu- tional sites!, and antisites in a compound semiconductor, a cation sitting on a nominal anion site, or vice versa!. Native defects have frequently been invoked to explain doping problems in semiconductors. For instance, the problem of achieving p-type ZnSe was long attributed to self- compensation by native defects: it was hypothesized that ev- ery attempt to incorporate acceptors would be accompanied by the spontaneous generation of large numbers of native defects, acting as donors. In the case of ZnSe, it was shown that compensation by native defects is not an insurmountable problem.16 Some degree of compensation is often unavoid- able, but this problem is not necessarily more severe in wide- band-gap semiconductors than in, say, GaAs. For GaN, we have found that compensation by vacancies can limit the doping level in some cases: gallium vacancies (VGa) are ac- ceptors and compensate n-type GaN; nitrogen vacancies (VN) are single donors and compensate p-type GaN.
Native defects have sometimes been invoked to play a role that goes beyond compensation, namely, to act as a source of doping. For instance, the frequently observed n-type conductivity of as-grown GaN was long attributed to nitrogen vacancies. Nitrogen vacancies indeed act as shallow donors, but their incorporation in n-type GaN costs too much energy for them to be present in the large concentrations necessary to explain the observed n-type conductivity.17
5. Compensation by foreign impurities
This source of compensation may seem rather obvious,but we mention it for completeness, and it often plays a 3853

Reuse of AIP content is subject to the terms at: http://jap.aip.org/about/rights_and_permissions crucial role: for instance, when doping with acceptors such as magnesium! in order to obtain p-type conductivity, impu- rities that act as donors such as oxygen! should be carefully controlled. Such control may be more difficult than is obvi- ous at first sight. For instance, for reasons that will be ex- plained in Sec. IV B 3, the presence in the growth system of a contaminating impurity with donor character may lead to a much larger incorporation of this impurity in p-type material than in n-type material.
Each and every one of the factors listed here can be explicitly examined using a computational approach, and Secs. III and IV will contain explicit examples of results.
II. METHODOLOGY
Modern first-principles calculations have had a major impact on the understanding of defects and impurities in semiconductors. With the capability to calculate total ener- gies, it became possible to investigate the atomic structure of the defect; i.e., the stable position in the host lattice, the relaxation of the surrounding atoms, as well as the energy along a migration path.1820 More recently, formalisms have been developed to use the total energy of the defect to cal- culate its concentration, under the assumption of thermody- namic equilibrium.21,22 The same formalism can also be ap- plied to the calculation of impurity solubilities.9,23 In the following sections we describe this formalism in detail.
A. Concentrations of defects
In thermodynamic equilibrium the concentration c of an impurity, defect, or complex is given by the expression c5NsitesNconfig exp2E f/kT! . 1!
Here, E f is the formation energy see Sec. II B 4!, Nsites is the number of sites in the lattice per unit volume! where the defect can be incorporated, k is Boltzmanns constant, and T is the temperature. Nconfig is the number of equivalent con- figurations in which the defect can be incorporated. For va- cancies, antisites, and subsitutional defects Nconfig51 if no symmetry breaking occurs. If symmetry breaking occurs or if complexes are formed it is the number of inequivalent con- figurations in which the defect can be incorporated on the same site.
1. Justification for the thermodynamic equilibrium
approach The expression for concentration as a function of forma- tion energy @Eq. 1!# is, strictly speaking, only valid in ther- modynamic equilibrium. Growth of semiconductors is obvi- ously a nonequilibrium process. How then do we justify using Eq. 1! and attaching relevance to formation energies?
The justification is based on the argument that many growth situations are close enough to equilibrium to warrant the use of the equilibrium approach. An important consideration here is that not all aspects of the process need to be in equilibrium in order to justify the use of equilibrium expressions for defects and impurities. What is required is a sufficiently high mobility of the relevant impurities and point defects to allow them to equilibrate at the temperatures of interest.
2. Molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) versus MOCVD
growth MOCVD growth of GaN is carried out at high tempera- tures usually between 1000 and 1100 C). The mobility of various point defects,24 both on the Ga and on the N sublat- tice, should be sufficiently high to allow equilibration of the defects and impurities that are being incorporated in the bulk. Under these circumstances, point defects will incorpo- rate in concentrations determined by their formation ener- gies, which, as discussed below, depend on the relative abun- dance of the various species in the growth environment.
MBE growth, on the other hand, is carried out at lower tem- peratures (;800 C), and the assumption of thermodynamic equilibrium is less likely to be satisfied. MBE-grown mate- rial may thus in principle exhibit point-defect concentrations that deviate from their equilibrium values.
We do want to make the point that, even if the equilib- rium conditions are not met that would justify use of Eq. 1! to derive concentrations, the formation energies defined in Sec. II B 4 are still physically meaningful. Nonequilibrium implies that once certain high-energy defects form, kinetic barriers may preserve them, even if their concentration ex- ceeds the nominal equilibrium value. It should be clear, how- ever, that defects with a high formation energy will always be unlikely to form, since a lot of energy needs to be ex- pended in their creation, and the driving force to lowering the energy is large.
3. Surface effects
An exception of the above argument is the creation of defects at the surface: There the defect formation energy may be significantly different from the bulk formation energy, due to structural as well as electronic effects. The structural ef- fects can be due, for instance, to local strains underneath specific features of reconstructed surfaces, as discussed by Tersoff in the case of C incorporation in Si.25 The electronic effects are related to the band bending that is usually present near semiconductor surfaces. As discussed in Sec. II B, the formation energies of charged defects and impurities depend sensitively on the Fermi level, and near the surface the posi- tion of the Fermi level with respect to the band edges can be strongly shifted due to the presence of space-charge layers.
Typically, defect formation energies at the surface are lower, resulting in high defect concentrations at the surface.
In cases where complete equilibration within the bulk of the growing material is not accomplished, it may still be possible for limited equilibration to occur within the first few atomic layers beneath the growing surface, where diffusion over short length scales may still be possible. Since the defect formation energy quickly converges to its bulk value when moving the defect from the surface to bulk see, e.g., Ref. 26! even limited equilibration within the first few atomic layers is sufficient to achieve bulk defect concentrations.
A comprehensive examination of the effects of surfaces on the incorporation of defects and impurities is beyond the scope of the present review. In the nitrides, we are aware of the following studies: Bungaro et al.27 investigated Mg in- corporation at GaN0001! surfaces; Zywietz et al. calculated 3854

B. Formation energies
1. Techniques for estimating or calculating formation
energies HartreeFock based models commonly employ quantum-chemistry approaches that have been successfully applied to atoms and molecules. The main problems with the technique are the neglect of correlation effects and the com- putational demands: ab initio HartreeFock methods can only be applied to systems with small numbers of atoms. The reason is that these methods require the evaluation of a large number of multicenter integrals. Simpler semiempirical methods have been developed that either neglect or approxi- mate some of these integrals. The accuracy and reliability of these methods is hard to assess.
Information about point defects and impurities can in principle also be obtained from tight-binding calculations.
Tight-binding methods use the fact that within a local basis set the Hamilton matrix elements rapidly decrease with in- creasing distance between the orbitals. Thus, instead of hav- ing to diagonalize the full Hamiltonian matrix most of the matrix elements vanish and only a sparse matrix has to be diagonalized. Depending on how the remaining Hamilton matrix elements are determined one can distinguish two main approaches: i! empirical tight-binding methods and ii! first-principles tight-binding methods.
An important problem for the empirical tight-binding ap- proach is the choice of parameters, for which there is no consistent prescription. The shortcomings of tight-binding theory were highlighted in early work on point defects in GaN, where the a1 state of the nitrogen vacancy was found to lie close to the bottom of the conduction band.32,33 In reality, this state lies near the top of the valence band.17 The location of this state is determined by the strong interaction between Ga dangling bonds surrounding the nitrogen va- cancy; the tight-binding calculations of Refs. 32 and 33,which only took nearest-neighbor interactions into account,failed to include this interaction, resulting in an incorrect positioning of the defect levels. The origin of the failing of a first nearest-neighbor tight-binding method is the extremely ionic character and the correspondingly! small lattice con- stant of the group-III nitrides.17 Second nearest-neighbor in- teractions therefore play an important role.
First-principles tight-binding methods use local orbitals to explicitly calculate the Hamilton matrix elements. The choice of orbitals is critical: instead of the standard local orbitals e.g., atomic orbitals!, specifically designed and ex- tremely localized orbitals are used. Approximations are made in neglecting some of the multi-center integrals and charge self-consistency. For group-III nitrides which are highly ionic, this approximation is not well satisfied. Significant im- provement has been found by using a point-charge model to take charge transfer and polarizability into account.34
2. Density-functional theory
Density-functional theory DFT! calculations based on pseudopotentials, a plane-wave basis set, and a supercell ge- ometry are now regarded as a standard for performing first- principles studies of defects in semiconductors. DFT in the local density approximation LDA!35 allows a description of the many-body electronic ground state in terms of single- particle equations and an effective potential. The effective potential consists of the ionic potential due to the atomic cores, the Hartree potential describing the electrostatic electron-electron interaction, and the exchange-correlation potential that takes into account the many-body effects. This approach has proven to describe with high accuracy such quantities as atomic geometries, charge densities, formation energies, etc. Most of the results described in Secs. III and IV are based on an implementation of pseudopotential- density-functional theory described in Ref. 3.
An analysis of GaN defect and bulk calculations showed that the Ga 3d electrons are not chemically inert but play an important role for the chemical bonding.3638 Thus, in gen- eral the Ga 3d electrons cannot be simply treated as core electrons which would be computationally less expensive! but have to be explicitly treated as valence electrons.38 The localized nature of the Ga 3d states significantly increases the computational demand, requiring an energy cutoff of at least 60 Ry in the plane-wave expansions. An attractive al- ternative is to use the so-called nonlinear core correction (nlcc),39 in combination with soft TroullierMartins pseudopotentials40 for which an energy cutoff of 40 Ry suf- fices.
The explicit inclusion of Ga 3d states as valence states yields demonstrable improvements in the structural proper- ties as well as in the enthalpy of formation. In large part,these improvements can also be achieved by using the nlcc.41 For the electronic structure, however, the benefit of explicitly including Ga 3d states is unclear. DFT-LDA places these d states too high in the band structure, causing them to be closer to the valence-band maximum VBM!; pd repul- sion then causes the VBM to be pushed up, leading to a decrease in the band gap. This effect has actually been found to persist in GW calculations.42 The inclusion of 3d states in calculations of band-structure-related properties such as alloy band gaps or deformation potentials may therefore not nec- essarily be an improvement compared to the use of the nlcc,where the effects of d states are only approximated and the anomalous repulsion between d states and the VBM is ab- sent.
Defect and impurity calculations should be carried out at the theoretical lattice constant, in order to avoid a spurious elastic interaction with defects or impurities in neighboring supercells. Since our purpose is to investigate properties for a single, isolated defect or impurity in an infinite solid, the lattice constant of the supercell should correspond to that of the unperturbed host. It has sometimes been suggested that,in the process of relaxing the host atoms around the defect,the volume of the supercell should be relaxed as well. Such a volume relaxation would actually correspond to finding the lattice constant of a bulk system containing an ordered array of impurities at very high concentration. This could result in 3855

Well-converged calculations with good-quality pseudo- potentials should produce lattice parameters within a few percent of the experimental value. When the Ga 3d electrons are explicitly included, with an 80 Ry energy cutoff,43 we find ath53.193 Å compared with aexp53.19 Å). The calcu- lated c/a ratio is 1.634 experiment: 1.627!, very close to the ideal c/a ratio of A8/351.633. For zinc-blende GaN, we find ath54.518 Å, which is to within 0.002 Å! & larger than the wurtzite lattice constant. Using the nlcc and a 40 Ry energy cutoff, the values are ath53.089 Å and c/a
51.633; and for zinc-blende GaN: ath54.370 Å, again to
within 0.001 Å! & larger than the wurtzite lattice constant.
For calculations of defects and impurities in semicon- ductors within the density-functional approach, use of the local density approximation seems to be well justified. The generalized gradient approximation GGA! apparently does not offer any advantages, neither for bulk properties43 nor for formation energies of point defects.44 The quantitative differ- ences that exist for the latter can be explained in terms of differences in the lattice constant which gives rise to differ- ences in the band gap! and in calculated formation enthalpies between LDA and GGA.44,41
3. Beyond density-functional theory
One shortcoming of the DFT approach is its failure to produce accurate excited-states propertiesthe band gap is commonly underestimated.45,46 Research is currently under way to overcome this limitation of density-functional theory.
No method is currently available that goes beyond DFT and provides total-energy capability for the large supercell calcu- lations required to investigate defects. Even methods aimed solely at calculating the band structure, such as the GW approach,4749 are currently prohibitively expensive for large cells.
A promising approach that yields bulk band structures in good agreement with experiment was recently introduced,based on self-interaction and relaxation-corrected SIRC! pseudopotentials.50 This approach was used in Ref. 51 to perform calculations of the electronic structure of bulk InN and of various native point defects. Defects can introduce levels in the band gap, and when occupied with electrons these levels contribute to the total energy of the system; it is therefore important to consider the effect of the band-gap error on the calculated properties of defects.
The study of Ref. 51 indicated that the character of the defect-induced states is very similar in SIRC calculations compared to LDA, but conduction-band related states are shifted to higher energies. The SIRC approach currently does not simply allow evaluation of total energies, and therefore the effects of the calculated changes in the band structure on the total energy of the defect were only estimated, without inclusion of selfconsistency. Still, it could be concluded that while total energies may be affected in some instances, at least for InN the shifts do not alter the conclusions based on the DFT calculations.
The SIRC potentials used in Ref. 51 produced a band gap of wurtzite InN of 1.55 eV, which was considered in reasonable agreement with the commonly accepted band-gap value of 1.9 eV. Very recently,52,53 it has become clear that the band gap of InN is actually only ;0.8 eV. This does not affect the conclusions reported in Ref. 51: indeed, if the qualitative conclusions of the LDA conclusions remain valid even when the band gap is increased to 1.55 eV, then they should certainly still apply when the band gap is only ;0.8 eV.
Other approaches have recently emerged that go beyond density-functional theory and look promising for addressing properties of defects and impurities. The fixed-node diffusion quantum Monte Carlo method was applied to the study of silicon self-interstitials in Ref. 54. The formation energy of the split-110& interstitial defect was found to be significantly higher by 1.6 eV! in the quantum Monte Carlo approach than in LDA. While this is a large number, it can probably be almost completely attributed to the upward shift of defect- induced levels in the band gap. Indeed, a shift of 0.7 eV needs to be applied to the LDA conduction band to bring it into agreement with experiment and, presumably, the quan- tum Monte Carlo result!. Assuming that the self-interstitial- induced t2 level undergoes a similar shift, its occupation with two electrons would raise the energy by 1.4 eV. In spite of the lack of selfconsistency, this estimate is close to the cal- culated difference between LDA and quantum Monte Carlo.
Finally, we mention another promising approach that may overcome the limitations of DFT-LDA, namely, the use of an Exact exchange KohnSham formalism. It has been demonstrated that this approach can produce high-quality band structures for semiconductors,55 and in principle it lends itself to a self-consistent evaluation of total energies.
Unfortunately, the computational requirements are currently prohibitive, and creative approaches to improve the compu- tational efficiency will be essential in order to apply the method to supercell calculations.
4. Definition of formation energy
The formation energy of a defect or impurity X in charge state q is defined as E f@Xq#5Etot@Xq#2Etot@GaN,bulk# 2( i nimi1q@EF1Ev1DV#. 2!Etot@X# is the total energy derived from a supercell calcula- tion with one impurity or defect X in the cell, and Etot@GaN,bulk# is the total energy for the equivalent super- cell containing only bulk GaN. ni indicates the number of atoms of type i host atoms or impurity atoms! that have been added to (ni.0) or removed from (ni,0) the super- cell when the defect or impurity is created, and the mi are the corresponding chemical potentials of these species. Chemical potentials are discussed in detail in Sec. II E; for now, it suffices to know that these chemical potentials represent the energy of the reservoirs with which atoms are being ex- changed.EF is the Fermi level, referenced to the valence-band maximum in the bulk. Due to the choice of this reference, we need to explicitly put in the energy of the bulk valence-band 3856

II C, we also need to add a correction term DV, to align the reference potential in our defect supercell with that in the bulk.
To illustrate these concepts, let us provide a specific ex- ample. For this we choose a Mg acceptor in GaN, because it will allow us to address a number of relevant issues.

The correction term Ecorr that appears in the formation en- ergy of MgGa 0 is specific to shallow centers, and is discussed in Sec. II D 3.
In principle, the free energy should be used in Eq. 1!.
Use of the zero-temperature! formation energy as defined in Eq. 2! implies that contributions from vibrational entropy are neglected. Explicit calculations of such entropies are very demanding, and currently not feasible for the large number of defects to be addressed. These entropy contributions can- cel to some extent, e.g., when solubilities are calculated; in general, they are small enough not to affect qualitative con- clusions. Experimental and theoretical results for entropies of point defects show that the entropy is typically in the range between 0 and 10 k, where k is the Boltzmann con- stant. A simple estimate based on an Einstein model for the phonon frequencies gives values between 3 and 5k for the native defects in GaN.
Entropy effects can play an important role under certain circumstances; for instance, they have been suggested to be responsible for the stabilization of a specific configuration of the MgH complex, where the free energy is lowered due to the large entropy associated with a low-energy excitation.79 In general, however, the inclusion of entropy does not cause any qualitative change in the results.
5. Supercells
The most common approach for performing calculations for impurties and defects is in a supercell geometry. The defect is surrounded by a finite number of semiconductor atoms, and that whole structure is periodically repeated.5659 This geometry allows the use of various techniques which require translational periodicity of the system. Provided the impurities are sufficiently well separated, properties of a single isolated impurity can be derived.
A major advantage of the supercell method is that the band structure of the host crystal is well described. Indeed, it should be clear that performing a calculation for a supercell that is simply filled with the host crystal, in the absence of any defect, simply produces the band structure of the host.
This contrasts with cluster approaches, where the host is modeled by a finite number of semiconductor atoms termi- nated at a surface which is typically hydrogenated, in order to eliminate surface states!. Even fairly large clusters typi- cally still produce sizeable quantum confinement effects which significantly affect the band structure, and interactions between defect wave functions and the cluster surface are hard to avoid.
An alternative approach that provides a good description of the band structure of the host crystal is based on the Greens function determined for the perfect crystal. This function is then used to calculate changes induced by the presence of the defect.60 The Greens function approach seems to be more cumbersome and less physically transpar- ent than the supercell technique. Still, it is occasionally used,for instance in the linear muffin-tin orbital calculations of Gorczyca et al. for GaN, AlN, and BN.61,62 However, their implementation of the method only allowed treatment of ideal substitutional defects, without inclusion of relaxations.
In order to study the atomic and electronic structure of an impurity in the GaN crystal, we construct an artificial unit cell supercell! composed of several primitive GaN unit cells and containing one impurity. The larger the supercell size,the closer our results will be to the case of a single, isolated impurity, because interactions between impurities in neigh- boring supercells are suppressed. Convergence as a function of supercell size should always be checked. Typical super- cells for the wurtzite structure contain 32, 72, or 96 atoms.
The 32-atom supercell is composed of eight wurtzite GaN primitive unit cells each containing four atoms!, such that each translation vector of the supercell is doubled from that of the basic unit cell see Fig. 1!. For the 72-atom supercell,the primitive unit cell is repeated three times in each of the basal-plane directions. Both 32- and 72-atom supercells suf- fer from the problem that the separation between impurities in neighboring supercells is quite different when measured along different directions. The 96-atom supercell avoids this problem by having translation vectors that are mutually per- pendicular, leading to a cell with orthorombic symmetry.
For the zinc-blende ZB! structure, typical supercells contain 32 or 64 atoms. The 32-atom supercell has bcc sym- metry, while the 64-atom cell is cubic, consisting of the con- ventional eight-atom cubic unit cell of the zinc-blende struc- ture doubled in each direction.
Within the supercell, relaxation of several shells of host atoms around the impurity or defect is always included. In a 96-atom supercell, relaxing all atoms within a sphere of ra- dius 4.8 Å around a substitutional impurity corresponds to relaxing 46 atoms seven shells of atoms!. In the zinc-blende 64-atom cell, the same relaxation radius leads to at least 44 atoms being relaxed five shells!. These relaxation radii are

For wurtz- ite, the absolute values of formation energies are not yet converged in a 32-atom cell. The 96-atom cell results are expected to be converged; for substitional impurities, these results for neutral and singly charged states! are very close to the ZB 64-atom cells.64
6. Special k-points
Brillouin-zone integrations are carried out using the MonkhorstPack scheme65 with a regularly spaced mesh of n3n3n points in the reciprocal unit cell shifted from the origin to avoid picking up the G point as one of the sam- pling points!. Symmetry reduces this set to a set of points in the irreducible part of the Brillouin zone.
When we describe a defect in a supercell approach,defectdefect interactions between defects in neighboring supercells lead to dispersion of the defect-induced levels in the band gap. A truly isolated defect corresponding to the limit of an infinitely large supercell! would lead to a flat,dispersionless level. The use of special points actually pro- vides a way of averaging over the defect band that leads to a result that should be very close to the level of the isolated defect. Note that this implies that the G point, which is some- times used for Brillouin-zone integrations due to the result- ing numerical simplicity, provides a very poor description since there the defect-defect interaction reaches its maxi- mum.
These arguments show that for a fully occupied defect level the use of special points will lead to a contribution to the total energy that is a good approximation to the value expected for an isolated defect. Care should be taken, how- ever, in cases where the defect level is only partially occu- pied. Most computational schemes assume a metallic oc- cupation of electronic levels, meaning that eigenvalues are filled with electrons up to a Fermi level that is calculated to yield the correct total number of electrons in the same. If the partially occupied defect level is the highest occupied elec- tronic level, then this metallic occupation potentially with some smearing representing a finite temperature! results in a larger fraction of electrons being placed at k points where the eigenvalues of the defect level are lower. This unequal occupation of the defect level then produces a poor approxi- mation to the total energy. Indeed, since averaging over the dispersion of the defect level produces the best approxima- tion to the position of the defect level of the isolated defect,one should make sure that states at different k points corre- sponding to the same defect level are equally occupied. Do- ing so has been found to yield measurable improvements in convergence as a function of supercell size.66 Convergence tests indicate that for zinc blende, the 23232 sampling yields total energies that are converged to better than 0.1 eV in both 32-atom and 64-atom supercells.
For the 32-atom wurtzite supercell, a 23232 set does not yield fully converged results. In the 96-atom wurtzite cell,finally, the 23232 k point mesh produces converged re- sults, i.e., increasing the k point sampling changes the energy only by ;0.01 eV.24
7. Self-consistent calculation of defect concentrations
In Sec. II A we discussed how concentrations of defects and impurities depend on formation energies, and in Sec.
II B 4 we showed how these formation energies are defined.
We found that the formation energies depend on atomic and electronic chemical potentials. The atomic chemical poten- tials reflect the experimental conditions that exist during growth or impurity incorporation, and as such are explicitly variable. However, the electronic chemical potential i.e., the Fermi level!, is not a free parameter. It is of course a quantity that we experimentally want to influence, specifically by doping of the semiconductorand within our framework we do that by including dopant impurities. But the Fermi level EF cannot be directly varied; ultimately, it is determined by the condition of charge neutrality. In principle equations such as Eq. 2! can be formulated for every point defect and im- purity in the material; the complete problem including free- carrier concentrations in valence and conduction bands! can then be solved self-consistently, imposing charge neutrality.
The solution of this problem amounts to finding the root of a polynomial with x5exp(2EF/kT) as the variable.16 The notion of calculating point defect concentrations as a function of environmental conditions is, of course, not new.
Kro ger developed an elaborate formalism and applied it to many solids.67 The formalism described here differs from Kro gers approach in three major ways: 1! Instead of work- ing with mass-action relations, which always relate to spe- cific defect reactions and thus involve pairs of defects, we write down equations for formation energies @Eq. 2!# for each defect individually. This greatly simplifies the formal- ism, makes it more transparent, and still allows for obtaining a self-consistent solution for all the coupled equations, as described above. 2! Instead of working with partial pres- sures, we prefer to work with chemical potentials, as de- scribed in Sec. II E 1. Again, this renders the formalism more transparent and also allows us to clearly identify the effect of an abundance of certain species in the environment, even if equilibration with a gas outside the material cannot be as- sumed. As discussed in Ref. 31, the use of chemical poten- tials as variables also results in a reduction of the number of free parameters required to represent a phase diagram. 3!
Last but not least, the availability of first-principles calcula- tions to evaluate the key parameters provides us with an enormous advantage over Kro ger, who had to infer the value of crucial parameters from limited experimental information.
This process often involved serious assumptions, which in turn could affect the results in uncontrolled ways. The unbi- ased, systematic results for all potential defects provided by state-of-the-art calculations allow us to approach defect problems truly from first principles.
Rather than just showing results for defect concentra- tions, it is often very instructive to plot formation energies as a function of EF in order to examine the behavior of defects and impurities when the doping level changes. For clarity of 3858

Reuse of AIP content is subject to the terms at: http://jap.aip.org/about/rights_and_permissions presentation the atomic chemical potentials may be set equal to fixed values; a general case can always be addressed by referring back to Eq. 2!. We will see that the dependence of formation energies on Fermi level provides immediate in- sight into the electrical activity donor or acceptor character! of a defect or impurity, the position of its charge transfer level, and the potential behavior of certain defects as com- pensating centers.
C. Charge states
Most point defects and impurities can occur in multiple charge states. As shown in Eq. 2!, the formation energy depends on the charge state. Formation energies have to be calculated for each relevant charge state. The stable charge state is then the one which has the lowest formation energy for a given Fermi level.
Equation 2! shows that the formation energy of charged impurities takes into account that electrons are exchanged with the Fermi level. The Fermi level EF is referenced with respect to the valence-band maximum in the bulk, i.e., EF 50 at the top of the valence band (Ev) in bulk GaN. A problem when calculating Ev is that in a supercell approach the defect or impurity strongly affects the band structure. We therefore cannot simply use Ev as calculated in the defect supercell. To solve this problem a two-step procedure is used: i! The top of the valence band Ev is calculated in bulk GaN by performing a band-structure calculation at the G point and ii! an alignment procedure is used in order to align the electrostatic potentials between the defect supercell and the bulk.
The fact that Ev found for the bulk e.g., in a defect-free supercell! cannot be directly applied to the supercell with defect can be attributed to the long-range nature of the Cou- lomb potential and the periodic boundary conditions inherent in the supercell approach. The creation of the defect gives rise to a constant shift in the potential, and this shift cannot be evaluated from supercell calculations alone since no ab- solute reference exists for the electrostatic potential in peri- odic structures. The problem is similar to that of calculating heterojunction band offsets,68 and similar techniques can be used to address these issues.16 Our preferred method is to align the electrostatic potentials by inspecting the potential in the supercell far from the impurity and aligning it with the electrostatic potential in bulk GaN. This leads to a shift in the
