Structure and dynamics of liquid water on rutile TiO2(110) Li-Min Liu, Changjun Zhang, Geoff Thornton, and Angelos Michaelides London Centre for Nanotechnology and Department of Chemistry, University College London, London WC1E 6BT, United Kingdom Received 28 September 2010; published 21 October 2010 Water on TiO2110 is the most widely studied water-oxide interface, yet questions about water dissociation and hydrogen bonding are controversial. Here we report density-functional theory simulations which show that water does not dissociate at the coverages examined. The aqueous film is layered, with slow moving molecules in the contact layer and fast moving molecules in a second layer, revealing strongly inhomogeneous dynamics of the interfacial water. Hydrogen bonding between the first and second layers is observed as is the exchange of water molecules. These results help to resolve a number of controversies pertaining to the molecular scale behavior of water on TiO2 and provide insight in to the structure and dynamics of water-solid interfaces by,e.g., demonstrating that water dynamics can vary on the Angstrm length scale and that the presence of second layer water molecules can cause those in the first layer to reorient.

Of all the many water-solid inter- faces, there are few if any of more contemporary scientific and technological importance than those between water and titanium dioxide TiO2. Water-TiO2 interfaces are relevant to photocatalysis, gas sensors, and biocompatible devices not to mention the varied applications of TiO2 in pigments and coatings. Motivated by the desire to better understand and ultimately control processes at wet TiO2 surfaces as well as to answer fundamental questions of wetting and the proper- ties of interfacial water, these systems have been intensively investigated. The rutile TiO2110-water interface is the most widely studied model system and to it almost every surface- sensitive probe has been employed in pursuit of a clear molecular-level description e.g., Refs. 118.
Despite the enormous body of work on water-TiO2110 interfaces, a number of crucial issues remain controversial.
First, there is the long-standing debate on which adsorption state the water molecules are in at the interface: dissociated or molecular? Many experimental studies have indicated that oxygen defect sites are required for dissociation.3,4,6,7 How- ever, density-functional theory DFT studies predict either molecular or dissociative adsorption on the perfect defect- free surface with results being sensitive to slab thickness,coverage, and exchange-correlation xc functional.914,1618 Second, there is the question of the hydrogen bond HB network at the interface at coverages in excess of 1 mono- layer ML, where 1 ML is defined as one water per fivefold coordinated Ti site. Specifically, the seemingly simple ques- tion of whether there are HBs between the first and second interfacial water layers is under debate. Campbell and co-workers3 interpreted work-function measurements as an indication of interlayer HBs, a view supported by recent electron-stimulated desorption ESD measurements.19 How- ever, spectroscopic measurements high-resolution electron- energy-loss spectroscopy HREELS Ref. 4 did not show any redshift in the O-H stretching region upon going from 1 ML to multilayer adsorption, an observation that was inter- preted as evidence against interlayer HBs. Answering these particular questions is not only essential for understanding water on TiO2 but it also has potential to reveal general insight into the behavior of interfacial water through detailed examination of a well-defined model system. These are ques- tions that can ideally be tackled with ab initio molecular dynamics AIMD. In AIMD the interatomic interactions are determined from the electronic-structure generally DFT,and real-time dynamics and thermal fluctuations at finite temperature can be explored. However, AIMD simulations of liquid water-solid interfaces are computationally very demanding1214,16,20 and only in the last few years have meaningful simulations of liquid water-solid interfaces been possible.
Here, we report on extensive DFT simulations aimed at clarifying several fundamental yet unresolved aspects of the structure and dynamics of water on the perfect defect-free TiO2110 surface. Our calculations with various semilocal and hybrid xc functionals indicate that water does not disso- ciate in the coverage regime examined

ML to multilayer. The molecules within the liquid film adsorb in at least two distinct layers: those in the first layer diffuse slowly and bond strongly to fivefold coordinated Ti sites; those in the second layer interact weakly with the substrate and dif- fuse rapidly. This reveals that the dynamics of interfacial water can be strongly inhomogeneous, varying on the Ang- strm length scale. Hydrogen bonding between the first and second layers is observed as is the exchange of molecules between the layers. The presence of second layer water mol- ecules causes those in the first layer to reorient, indicating that the monolayer is a model of at best limited applicability to understanding the aqueous water-TiO2 interface. These findings help to resolve a number of longstanding debates in the literature and underscore the complex nature of the struc- ture and dynamics of aqueous water films on flat hydrophillic surfaces.
The calculations reported here have been performed with two codes. The plane-wave basis set code VASP Refs. 21 and 22 has been used to explore the sensitivity of the results to xc functional and slab thickness. The mixed Gaussian and plane-wave basis set code CP2K/QUICKSTEP Ref. 23 has been used mostly for the AIMD simulations. In the AIMD simulations the canonical ensemble was employed with a target temperature of 360 K, maintained with a Nose-Hoover chain thermostat. Further computational details are given in the supplementary information24 and the good agreement be-

To begin, we examine how slab thickness and xc func- tional affect the picture that emerges for a water monolayer at 0 K. At this stage the focus is on three common general- ized gradient approximation functionals PBE,25 RPBE,26 and BLYP Refs. 27 and 28. At 1 ML the two states of interest are a pure molecular INTACT state in which water molecules adsorb at fivefold coordinated Ti sites Ti5c and a partially dissociated PDIS state in which every second wa- ter molecule at the Ti5c sites has dissociated. In Figs. 1a1c, the relative energies of these states is plotted as a function of slab thickness. Clearly the relative energies of the two states oscillate strongly, as discussed before e.g., Refs. 9 and 17. However the key point, which has hitherto been a matter of debate,912,14,1618,20,29 is that for the thickest slabs all three functionals give essentially the same result, namely,that the INTACT state is more stable than the PDIS state by about 0.05 eV/water to 0.1 eV/water. The conclusion that the INTACT state is more stable than the PDIS state is not altered if hybrid xc functionals such as PBE0,30 HSE06,31 and B3LYP Refs. 28 and 32 are used Table I or if van der Waals forces are accounted for.33 Finally, we note that at a lower coverage of 0.5 ML, the intact water state is again preferred over the dissociated DIS state when a suf- ficiently thick slab is used Fig. 1d and Table I.
To establish if finite-temperature or kinetic29 effects are relevant to the question of water dissociation, AIMD simu- lations were carried out for water films on TiO2 at 360 K with PBE. AIMD simulations were performed at 1 ML and for a multilayer film Fig. 2a on three, four, and six-layer TiO2 slabs. The picture that emerges from AIMD is consis- tent with the total-energy calculations: on the four- and six- layer slabs water does not dissociate but on the three-layer slab some water molecules do half the molecules in the first layer. Since the previous AIMD studies of this system were performed on a three-layer slab,12,16 we suggest that the dis-

161415-2 sociation observed in these studies is a consequence of the surface model employed. Overall, the fact that a consistent picture emerges from the range of simulations reported here at both 0 K and finite temperature with functionals that have quite different treatments of exchange and correlation and yield, e.g., different TiO2 band gaps, covalent, and hydrogen bond strengths provides strong evidence against dissocia- tion.
Having established that water does not dissociate on TiO2110 and that this is adequately reflected with a four- layer slab, we now examine certain properties of the water film. An overview is provided by the planar-averaged density along the surface normal Fig. 2b. This is characterized by a large peak in the density of 3 g/cm3 at 2.1 Å from the surface. The high-density maximum indicates that molecules in this layer are adsorbed at well-defined surface sites; as we show below these are the molecules at the Ti5c sites referred to as H2OTi molecules. Beyond the first layer are two other, less-well-defined layers. The second layer is centered at a height of 3.8 Å and corresponds to water at the Obr sites H2Obr molecules. The weak third layer is just about discernible and is associated with molecules that act as HB bridges between adjacent H2Obr molecules. Outside the third layer, from 6 Å, the oscillations are less pronounced and the bulk density of 1 g/cm3 is obtained. While the layer- ing and density oscillations observed here are a general fea- ture of solid-liquid interfaces, the detailed nature of the os- cillations are specific to water on TiO2110. Indeed it is encouraging that the first hydration peak appears to be in excellent agreement with the peak in the oxygen density pro- file observed at 2.120.02 Å with x-ray diffraction.5 Let us focus on the molecules in the contact layer. Figure 3a displays spatial probability distribution functions pro- jected on to the TiO2 surface for the O and H atoms within the contact layer. Consistent with the high peak in the density profile there is indeed a high degree of order within the first layer, wherein the molecules are adsorbed above Ti5c sites.
Most Ti5c sites are occupied during the course of the AIMD simulation with the effect that the time-averaged coverage in this layer is close to 1 ML 0.84 ML. The H2OTi molecules are generally adsorbed with their dipoles inclined slightly away from the surface. This is shown by the snapshot in Fig. 2a and quantified by the orientational order parameter, ,reported in Fig. 2c.  is defined as the average of the cosine of the angle between the water dipole and the surface nor- mal. The large positive value of 0.6 implies an aniso- tropic water distribution with the dipole moments inclined by about 35 from the surface. The H2OTi molecules form sev- eral distinct types of HBs. Specifically, they can donate and accept HBs to water molecules at adjacent Ti5c sites Fig. 3c, they can donate HBs to the O bridge sites Figs. 3c and 3d, and they can donate and accept HBs to and from water molecules in the second layer Figs. 3d and 3e.
Using a geometric definition of hydrogen bonding,34 the av- erage number of HBs each H2OTi is involved in is 2.2.
Although our simulations reveal HBs between the first and second layers, the existence of interlayer HBs is under debate. This debate originates in HREELS experiments which did not show a redshift in the O-H stretching region upon going from monolayer to multilayer.4 To address this we used AIMD to calculate vibrational frequency spectra for the monolayer and multilayer films Fig. S2. The key find- ing is that for the monolayer the molecules rearrange and compensate for the missing HBs to the second layer by tightening up the HBs in the plane parallel to the surface.
This can be seen by comparing the spatial probability distri- butions for the monolayer simulation Fig. 3b with the results from the first layer beneath the water film Fig. 3a.
Indeed the average number of HBs per H2OTi in the case of a monolayer remains at 2.2, identical to the value obtained for the first wetting layer in the multilayer. Likewise the relevant HB peak in the O-H O-D stretching region is un- changed upon going from the monolayer to the multilayer Fig. S2a. The rearrangement of the HBs at water film coverages and the resultant similar number of HBs in the first layer for the monolayer and the multilayer helps to ex- plain the longstanding puzzle on the existence of interlayer HBs.3,4,19 Note that an equivalent set of simulations on a three-layer slab upon which water dissociates does not yield spectra that can explain the HREELS experiments Fig.
S2b, thus providing further evidence against dissociation.
Not only do the 1 ML simulations allow the issue of inter- layer HBs to be addressed but they show that the structure of the first layer is perturbed by the presence of the water film cf. Figs. 3a and 3b. A general implication of this is that the monolayer is a model of at best limited applicability to understanding the liquid water-TiO2 interface.
Finally, we discuss the diffusive properties of the mol- ecules within the first two layers. From a force-field study35 it was concluded that the molecules in the first layer were immobile. Here, we find that while these molecules are slug- gish with a diffusion coefficient of 0.02 Å2/ps, they are mobile and the exchange of molecules between the first and second layers is observed; such exchange is consistent with (a) Obr Ti6c (b)

161415-3 recent ESD measurements.19 Immediately beyond the first layer, the H2Obr molecules exhibit a diffusion coefficient of
0.07 Å2/ps, which is characteristic of PBE bulk water.36
Thus our calculations predict a large discontinuity in diffu- sion coefficients upon moving away from the surface rather than the gradual change predicted previously.35 To under- stand why the water dynamics can vary on the Angstrm length scale, HB lifetimes were computed.34 Whereas the calculated HB lifetime for PBE bulk water is about 7 ps, the lifetime for the interlayer HBs is only 0.9 ps, and for the HBs between the H2Obr molecules and the Obr sites it is also short at 3.8 ps. Thus, although H2Obr molecules form HBs to both the H2OTi molecules and the Obr bridge sites, these HBs are short lived and it is this that enables relatively rapid diffusion of the molecules in the second layer. This establishes for this system a clear connection between local bonding and dy- namics.
In conclusion, an extensive series of first-principles simu- lations for water on TiO2110 have been performed. By carefully evaluating the sensitivity of the results to slab thickness and xc functional including the first periodic hy- brid functional calculations for water on TiO2 we have ar- rived at a consistent picture with regard to water dissocia- tion: water does not dissociate in the entire coverage regime examined. This clear understanding has then allowed us to address other long-standing questions of general importance relating to the structure and dynamics of the wet TiO2 inter- face. We find that molecules within the liquid film adsorb in at least two distinct layers: those in the first layer are slug- gish and bond strongly to fivefold coordinated Ti sites; those in the second layer interact weakly with the substrate and diffuse rapidly. This reveals strongly inhomogeneous dynam- ics of the interfacial water and shows that in the immediate vicinity of the interface the dynamical properties of the water can vary on the Angstrm length scale. Hydrogen bonding between the first and second layers is observed as well as the exchange of molecules. In addition, the presence of second layer molecules causes those in the first layer to reorient,indicating that the monolayer is a model of at best limited applicability to understanding the aqueous water-TiO2 inter- face. Not only does this study help to resolve a number of important debates relating to the molecular level details of water on TiO2 but it also demonstrates the complex nature of wetting at a seemingly simple defect-free hydrophilic sur- face.
