I'm going to give you a scientific literature. Then I'm going to ask you some questions about it. I'd like you to first write down exact quotes of parts of the document word by word that would help answer the question, and then I'd like you to answer the question using facts from the quoted content. Do not omit any relevant information from the text, and avoid introducing any falsehoods or assumptions that aren't directly supported by the literature.

CO Disproportionation at Mild Temperatures over Partially Reduced Cerium Oxide Can Li, Y. Sakata, T. Arai, K. Domen, K. Maruya and T. Onishi" Research Laboratory of Resources Utilization, Tokyo Institute of Technolog y, 4259 Nagatsuta, Midori-ku, Yokohama 227, Japan Direct dissociation and disproportionation of carbon monoxide over partially reduced cerium oxide are demonstrated, even at room temperature, by Fourier-transform IR spectroscopy.
CO hydrogenation over metal catlysts has been extensively studied in the last decades, and CO disproportionation has been commonly found for most of the group VIII metal catalysts, especially at high temperatures. However, studies of CO hydrogenation over pure metal oxide catalysts are relatively limited. In general, CO is not activated as readily on oxides as it is on metal catalysts; accordingly, CO dispropor- tionation on oxides at mild temperatures has been considered to be impossible. We have found that the CO hydrogenation over cerium oxide produces hydrocarbons rather than oxygen- containing compounds as over other oxides.1.2 Here we report on the direct dissociation of CO over partially reduced cerium oxide studied by FTIR spectroscopy. Partially reduced cerium oxide exhibits high activity for cleavage of CO even at room temperature, and the activity is proportional to the extent of reduction of the cerium oxide.3 A similar result for rare earth oxides has not been reported.
Cerium oxide was obtained by the thermal decomposition of cerium hydroxide gel at 773 K in air for 3 h. The cerium hydroxide was prepared through precipitation from an aqueous solution of cerium(rI1) nitrate with NH40H. H2 was purified via a Deoxo arrangement and then through a liquid-nitrogen trap in a circulating system. C02 was prepared from the decomposition of NaHC03. IR spectra were recorded on a JEOL JIR-100 FTIR spectrometer. The sample was pressed into a self-supporting disc. The disc was placed in an IR cell with a furnace capable of heating the disc i n situ up to 1000 K.
Surface contaminants including carbonate-like species were removed by treating the cerium oxide disc in 0 2 at 873 K and outgassing at 1000 K [referred to as Ce02 (1000 K)]. The sample was reduced in H2 at 673 K for 1-4 h then dehydroxylated by evacuation at 1000 K for 30 min, to give CeO2 (673-H). After the sample was cooled to room temperature it was exposed to CO (30 Torr) and IR spectra were recorded immediately. Fig. 1 shows the IR spectra followed after admission of CO at room temperature. A number of bands were clearly observed in the 1700-800 cm-1 region while no bands were observed in the 2000-3500 cm-1 region. These bands grew slowly with time as shown in Fig. 1.
From their growth in intensities, these bands can be roughly grouped into three kinds o f surface species: (I) sharp bands at 1691 and 1078 cm-1, (11) a sharp band at 1597 and a broad band at around 1315 cm-1, and (111) broad and weak bands at 1489 and 1390 cm-1. When isotopicaIly labelled W O was introduced onto the partially reduced cerium oxide, all these bands shifted to the lower frequency region but the outline of the spectrum remained unchanged. The isotope results indicated that these bands observed after CO adsorption on the partially reduced cerium oxide at room temperature were derived from CO. In a separate experiment, when CO;, was adsorbed on the partially reduced cerium oxide, an almost identical spectrum of the species (11) and (111) as shown in Fig. +l

41 1 1 was obtained while the bands at 1691 and 1078 cm-1 of species (I) were absent. Accordingly, the bands in Fig. 1 were due to the adsorbed species formed from C02 adsorption. In detail, the species (I), (11) and (111) can be respectively assigned a bridged carbonate, bidentate carbonate and inorganic carboxylate according to our previous work.4 The above results demonstrated that the C02 was produced even at room temperature when CO reacts with the partially reduced cerium oxide. Because the surface was reduced at 673 K in H2 prior to the CO adsorption, the possibility of CO oxidation by the surface oxygen was ruled out; therefore, the surface species of adsorbed C02 was formed from the CO disproportionation reaction (2CO --+ C + C02). The IR spectra of adsorbed CO on Ce02 (100-1000 K) are different from those over Ce02 (673-H).3 The intensities of these IR bands grew markedly when the CO adsorption temperature was elevated. It was also found that the band intensities increased with the reduction time of cerium oxide. This proved that the partially reduced cerium oxide can activate the CO dissocation even at mild temperatures, and accordingly the partially reduced surface underwent a redox cycle [see eqns. (1)-(3)].Ce02 + (2 - x)HZ ---+ CeO, (x < 2) + (2 - x)H20 (1) nCeO, + CO ---+ nCeO, (n > 1,x < y < 2) + C(ad) (2) nCeOy + CO --+ nCeO, + C02(,,,(3) Received, 7th November 1990; Corn. 0105014H

First, you need to sequentially extract any quotes in the literature that are most relevant to each question, and print them in numbered order, separated by newlines. Quotes should be relatively brief. Do not attempt to summarize or answer questions at this stage, but simply repeat exactly what the corresponding part of the literature says.

Please enclose the full list of quotes in <quotes></quotes> XML tags. If there are no relevant quotes, write "No relevant quotes" instead.

Then, answer the question, starting with "Answer:".  Do not include or reference quoted content verbatim in the answer. Don't say "According to Quote [1]" when answering. Do not write reference number of quotes after answer. Put your answer to the user inside <EnglishVersionAnswer></EnglishVersionAnswer> XML tags. Output formatted text, with line breaks for each question.Separate quotes and answers with a blank line. Provide the answers to all questions in English. After completing the English answers, translate all those answers into Chinese and provide the Chinese version inside <ChineseVersionAnswer></ChineseVersionAnswer> XML tags.

Thus, the format of your overall response should look like what's shown between the <example></example> tags.  Make sure to follow the formatting and spacing exactly.
