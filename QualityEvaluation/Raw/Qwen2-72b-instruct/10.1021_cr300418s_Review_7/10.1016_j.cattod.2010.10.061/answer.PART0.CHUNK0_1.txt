Au/CeO2, then CO2 is formed when CO takes a oxygen atom from the oxide surface creating a oxygen vacancy defect, and therefore the oxidation activity of a catalyst should be inversely related to the oxygen vacancy energy formation."

1. According to the Mars-van Krevelen mechanism, in the oxidation reaction catalyzed by the oxide, when CO takes an oxygen atom from the oxide surface to form CO2, an oxygen vacancy defect is created. Therefore, the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface are inversely proportional to the energy required for oxygen vacancy formation.

1. 根据Mars-van Krevelen机制，在氧化物催化的氧化反应中，当CO从氧化物表面取一个氧原子形成CO2时，会形成氧空位缺陷。因此，催化剂的催化活性和氧化物表面的氧化能力与形成氧空位所需的能量成反比。
