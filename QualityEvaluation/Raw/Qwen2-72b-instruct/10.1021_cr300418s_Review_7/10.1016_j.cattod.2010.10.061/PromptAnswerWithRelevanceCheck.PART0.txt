Read the questions and answers provided below. First, critically assess the overall relevance of the answers provided to the set of questions asked.

If, upon your assessment, you find that the answers do not contain information that is relevant to the questions asked, stop your review process immediately and respond with a single sentence: "※※※※※※※The provided answers are not relevant to the questions.※※※※※※※". Do not provide any additional explanation or background information, only this sentence should be given as a response in case of irrelevant answers.

If, however, the answers are relevant to the questions asked, proceed to compile answers for each question according to the instructions below. Ensure to aggregate all the relevant answers from the multiple answer results provided in the document, and organize them sequentially by their order number, compiling the corresponding quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question.

If the provided answers' quotes are not differentiated by question, ensure to break them down and assign the quotes to each respective question, outputting them separately within each question's section.

To provide a comprehensive review, differentiate the responses into quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question based on the details given in the 'Answer' XML tags. Structure your review using the XML format showcased below if the answers are relevant to the questions asked:

[1] "If a Mars-van Krevelen mechanism is accepted for CO oxidation on Corresponding author.E-mail addresses: boronat@itq.upv.es (M. Boronat), acorma@itq.upv.es (A. Corma). Au/CeO2, then CO2 is formed when CO takes a oxygen atom from the oxide surface creating a oxygen vacancy defect, and therefore the oxidation activity of a catalyst should be inversely related to the oxygen vacancy energy formation."

</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>

1. According to the Mars-van Krevelen mechanism, in the oxidation of CO on the surface of Au/CeO2, CO2 is formed when CO takes an oxygen atom from the oxide surface, creating an oxygen vacancy defect. Therefore, the oxidation activity of a catalyst is inversely proportional to the energy required for oxygen vacancy formation.

1. According to the Mars-van Krevelen mechanism, in the oxidation reaction catalyzed by the oxide, when CO takes an oxygen atom from the oxide surface to form CO2, an oxygen vacancy defect is created. Therefore, the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface are inversely proportional to the energy required for oxygen vacancy formation.
