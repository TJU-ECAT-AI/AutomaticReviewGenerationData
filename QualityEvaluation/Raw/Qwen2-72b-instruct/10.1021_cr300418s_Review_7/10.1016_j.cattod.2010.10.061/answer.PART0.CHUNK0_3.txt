1. According to the Mars-van Krevelen mechanism, in the oxidation of CO on the surface of Au/CeO2, CO2 is formed when CO takes an oxygen atom from the oxide surface, creating an oxygen vacancy defect. Therefore, the oxidation activity of a catalyst is inversely related to the energy required for oxygen vacancy formation.

1. 根据Mars-van Krevelen机制，在Au/CeO2表面的CO氧化过程中，当CO从氧化物表面取走一个氧原子，形成氧空位缺陷时，会形成CO2。因此，催化剂的氧化活性与其形成氧空位所需的能量成反比。
