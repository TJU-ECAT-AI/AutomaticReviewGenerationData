[1] "The energy (Evf) required for removing one of the oxygen atoms to form a vacancy in the surface layer and half an oxygen molecule in the gas phase."

[2] "On the other hand, CO oxidation by using any one of the four oxygen atoms of the AuxTi1xO2 surface is exothermic; on this surface CO oxidation is thermodynamically favored."

[3] "After adsorption, the oxygen molecule reacts with gas-phase CO to form a carbonate (figure 1e), with a very substantial release of energy (about 4 eV). This complex decomposes to release CO2 and leaves behind an oxygen atom that fills the vacancy. This restores the surface to its initial state, which means that this set of reactions is catalytic."

1.The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions by the removal of an oxygen atom from the surface layer to form a vacancy, which is then replenished by an oxygen molecule from the gas phase. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) is significant as it determines the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. A lower ΔEv indicates a more reactive surface, which is crucial for catalytic activity. In the case of AuxTi1xO2, CO oxidation using any of the four oxygen atoms is exothermic, making the reaction thermodynamically favored. The oxygen molecule adsorbed on the surface reacts with gas-phase CO to form a carbonate, releasing a substantial amount of energy. This complex then decomposes to release CO2 and leaves an oxygen atom to fill the vacancy, restoring the surface to its initial state and ensuring the catalytic nature of the reaction.

1.火星-范克雷维尔机制在氧化物催化氧化反应中通过从表面层移除一个氧原子形成空位，然后由气相中的氧分子补充。形成氧空位所需的能量(ΔEv)是重要的，因为它决定了氧化物表面的氧化能力。较低的ΔEv表明表面更具有反应性，这对于催化活性至关重要。在AuxTi1xO2的情况下，使用任何四个氧原子之一的CO氧化是放热的，使反应在热力学上是有利的。吸附在表面的氧分子与气相中的CO反应形成碳酸盐，释放出大量的能量。然后，该复合物分解，释放CO2，并留下一个氧原子来填充空位，使表面恢复到初始状态，确保反应的催化性质。
