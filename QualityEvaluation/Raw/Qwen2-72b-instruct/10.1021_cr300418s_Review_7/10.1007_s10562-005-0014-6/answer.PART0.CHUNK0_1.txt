[1] "The energy (Evf) required for removing one of the oxygen atoms to form a vacancy in the surface layer and half an oxygen molecule in the gas phase."
[2] "On the other hand, CO oxidation by using any one of the four oxygen atoms of the AuxTi1xO2 surface is exothermic; on this surface CO oxidation is thermodynamically favored."
[3] "After adsorption, the oxygen molecule reacts with gas-phase CO to form a carbonate (figure 1e), with a very substantial release of energy (about 4 eV). This complex decomposes to release CO2 and leaves behind an oxygen atom that fills the vacancy. This restores the surface to its initial state, which means that this set of reactions is catalytic."

1.The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions by the removal of an oxygen atom from the oxide surface to form a vacancy, which then reacts with a gas-phase reactant, such as CO, to form a product and leave behind an oxygen vacancy. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) is significant in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. A lower ΔEv indicates a more reactive surface and a better catalyst. In the case of AuxTi1xO2, CO oxidation using any of the four oxygen atoms on the surface is exothermic, making CO oxidation thermodynamically favored. After adsorption, the oxygen molecule reacts with gas-phase CO to form a carbonate, releasing a substantial amount of energy. This complex then decomposes to release CO2 and leaves behind an oxygen atom that fills the vacancy, restoring the surface to its initial state and making the set of reactions catalytic.

1.火星-范克雷维尔机制在氧化物催化的氧化反应中通过从氧化物表面移除一个氧原子形成空位，然后与气相反应物（如CO）反应形成产物并留下氧空位来运作。形成氧空位所需的能量（ΔEv）在确定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力方面具有重要意义。较低的ΔEv表明表面更具有反应性，是一个更好的催化剂。在AuxTi1xO2的情况下，使用表面的任何四个氧原子之一的CO氧化是放热的，使CO氧化在热力学上是有利的。吸附后，氧分子与气相CO反应形成碳酸盐，释放大量能量。然后，该复合物分解，释放CO2，并留下一个氧原子填充空位，使表面恢复到初始状态，使这一系列反应成为催化反应。
