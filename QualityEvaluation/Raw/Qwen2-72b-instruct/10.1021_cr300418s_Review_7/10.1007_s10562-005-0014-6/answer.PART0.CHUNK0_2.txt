[1] "The essential elements of the oxidation mechanism proposed here involve the weakening, by the dopant, of the bond between the oxygen atoms in the top surface layer and the oxide, and the reactivity of the oxygen vacancy and of the molecules adsorbed at an oxygen vacancy site."

[2] "The stability of the doped oxide depends on the method of preparation and the composition of the reacting gases."

[3] "A good oxidation catalyst in this class of compounds requires a fine balance between the rate of oxide reduction and oxidation."

[4] "The error is caused by the electron self- interaction in DFT, which favors the delocalization of the electron in the d- or f-bands where the electron should be localized on individual atoms."

[5] "A good catalyst in this class must strike a balance between the ability to donate an oxygen atom during oxidation, and that of taking oxy- gen from the gas phase to heal the oxygen vacancy formed by the oxidation reaction."

1.The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions involves the weakening of the bond between surface oxygen atoms and the oxide by the dopant, making the oxygen vacancy more reactive. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) is crucial in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. A good catalyst needs to balance the rate of oxide reduction and oxidation, ensuring that the oxygen vacancy is quickly replenished after an oxidation reaction.
