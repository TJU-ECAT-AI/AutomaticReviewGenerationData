[1] "The oxidation takes place by a Mars-van Krevelen mechanism;"

[2] "To determine to what extent the oxide becomes a better oxidant when doped with Au, we have calcu- lated the energy (Evf) required for removing one of the oxygen atoms to form a vacancy in the surface layer and half an oxygen molecule in the gas phase."

[3] "Doping weakens dramatically the bond of surface oxygen to the oxide, even when a Ti atom is substituted by Au in the slab sub layer (not shown)."

[4] "On the other hand, CO oxidation by using any one of the four oxygen atoms of theAuxTi1xO2 surface is exothermic; on this surface CO oxidation is thermodynamically favored."

[5] "After adsorption, the oxygen molecule reacts with gas-phase CO to form a carbonate (figure 1e), with a very substantial release of energy (about 4 eV). This complex decomposes to release CO2 and leaves behind an oxygen atom that fills the vacancy. This restores the surface to its initial state, which means that this set of reactions is catalytic."

1.The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions by involving the formation and recombination of oxygen vacancies on the oxide surface. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) is significant in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. When an oxide is doped, such as with Au, the bond of surface oxygen to the oxide is weakened, making it easier to form oxygen vacancies. This results in a more reactive surface that can oxidize CO more efficiently. The lower the ΔEv, the more reactive the surface is, and the better the catalytic activity. The mechanism is catalytic because the oxygen vacancy is refilled by the reaction of the oxygen molecule with gas-phase CO, which releases CO2 and leaves behind an oxygen atom that fills the vacancy, restoring the surface to its initial state.

1.火星-范克雷维尔机制在氧化物催化的氧化反应中通过涉及氧化物表面上氧空位的形成和重组来运作。形成氧空位所需的能量(ΔEv)在确定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力方面具有重要意义。当氧化物被掺杂，如用Au，表面氧与氧化物的键被削弱，使形成氧空位变得更容易。这导致一个更具反应性的表面，可以更有效地氧化CO。ΔEv越低，表面的反应性越强，催化活性越好。该机制是催化性的，因为氧分子与气相CO的反应填补了氧空位，释放CO2，并留下一个氧原子填充空位，使表面恢复到初始状态。
