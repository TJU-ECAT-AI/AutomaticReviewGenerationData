[1] "The energy (Evf) required for removing one of the oxygen atoms to form a vacancy in the surface layer and half an oxygen molecule in the gas phase."

[2] "On the other hand, CO oxidation by using any one of the four oxygen atoms of the AuxTi1xO2 surface is exothermic; on this surface CO oxidation is thermodynamically favored."

[3] "After adsorption, the oxygen molecule reacts with gas-phase CO to form a carbonate (figure 1e), with a very substantial release of energy (about 4 eV). This complex decomposes to release CO2 and leaves behind an oxygen atom that fills the vacancy. This restores the surface to its initial state, which means that this set of reactions is catalytic."

1.The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions by the removal of an oxygen atom from the surface layer to form a vacancy, which is then replenished by an oxygen molecule from the gas phase. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) is significant as it determines the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. A lower ΔEv indicates a more reactive surface, which is crucial for catalytic activity. In the case of AuxTi1xO2, CO oxidation using any of the four oxygen atoms is exothermic, making the reaction thermodynamically favored. The oxygen molecule adsorbed on the surface reacts with gas-phase CO to form a carbonate, releasing a substantial amount of energy. This complex then decomposes to release CO2 and leaves an oxygen atom to fill the vacancy, restoring the surface to its initial state and ensuring the catalytic nature of the reaction.

1.火星-范克雷维尔机制在氧化物催化氧化反应中通过从表面层移除一个氧原子形成空位，然后由气相中的氧分子补充。形成氧空位所需的能量(ΔEv)是重要的，因为它决定了氧化物表面的氧化能力。较低的ΔEv表明表面更具有反应性，这对于催化活性至关重要。在AuxTi1xO2的情况下，使用任何四个氧原子之一的CO氧化是放热的，使反应在热力学上是有利的。吸附在表面的氧分子与气相中的CO反应形成碳酸盐，释放出大量的能量。然后，该复合物分解，释放CO2，并留下一个氧原子来填充空位，使表面恢复到初始状态，确保反应的催化性质。

[1] "The essential elements of the oxidation mechanism proposed here involve the weakening, by the dopant, of the bond between the oxygen atoms in the top surface layer and the oxide, and the reactivity of the oxygen vacancy and of the molecules adsorbed at an oxygen vacancy site."

[2] "The stability of the doped oxide depends on the method of preparation and the composition of the reacting gases."

[3] "A good oxidation catalyst in this class of compounds requires a fine balance between the rate of oxide reduction and oxidation."

[4] "The error is caused by the electron self- interaction in DFT, which favors the delocalization of the electron in the d- or f-bands where the electron should be localized on individual atoms."

[5] "A good catalyst in this class must strike a balance between the ability to donate an oxygen atom during oxidation, and that of taking oxy- gen from the gas phase to heal the oxygen vacancy formed by the oxidation reaction."

1.The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions involves the weakening of the bond between surface oxygen atoms and the oxide by the dopant, making the oxygen vacancy more reactive. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) is crucial in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. A good catalyst needs to balance the rate of oxide reduction and oxidation, ensuring that the oxygen vacancy is quickly replenished after an oxidation reaction.

[1] "The oxidation takes place by a Mars-van Krevelen mechanism;"

[2] "To determine to what extent the oxide becomes a better oxidant when doped with Au, we have calcu- lated the energy (Evf) required for removing one of the oxygen atoms to form a vacancy in the surface layer and half an oxygen molecule in the gas phase."

[3] "Doping weakens dramatically the bond of surface oxygen to the oxide, even when a Ti atom is substituted by Au in the slab sub layer (not shown)."

[4] "On the other hand, CO oxidation by using any one of the four oxygen atoms of theAuxTi1xO2 surface is exothermic; on this surface CO oxidation is thermodynamically favored."

[5] "However, O2 binds more weakly on an bridging-oxygen vacancy on the Au-doped (DeO2  0:68 eV) than on a pure TiO2(110) surface (DeO2  2:80 eV)."

[6] "After adsorption, the oxygen molecule reacts with gas-phase CO to form a carbonate (figure 1e), with a very substantial release of energy (about 4 eV). This complex decomposes to release CO2 and leaves behind an oxygen atom that fills the vacancy. This restores the surface to its initial state, which means that this set of reactions is catalytic."

1.The oxidation process occurs through the Mars-van Krevelen mechanism, which involves the transfer of oxygen from the oxide surface to the reactant, in this case, CO. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) is crucial as it determines the ease with which oxygen can be transferred from the oxide surface, thereby affecting the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide. Doping with Au significantly weakens the bond of surface oxygen to the oxide, making it easier to form oxygen vacancies and thus enhancing the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. This results in a more favorable thermodynamic condition for CO oxidation on the doped oxide surface compared to the undoped one.

1.氧化过程通过Mars-van Krevelen机制进行，该机制涉及从氧化物表面向反应物（在这种情况下为CO）转移氧。形成氧空位所需的能量（ΔEv）至关重要，因为它决定了氧从氧化物表面转移的难易程度，从而影响了氧化物的催化活性和氧化能力。用Au掺杂会显著削弱表面氧与氧化物的结合，使形成氧空位变得更容易，从而增强了氧化物表面的氧化能力。这导致与未掺杂的氧化物表面相比，在掺杂氧化物表面上CO氧化的热力学条件更为有利。

1.The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions by involving the formation and recombination of oxygen vacancies on the oxide surface. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) is significant in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. When an oxide is doped, such as with Au, the bond of surface oxygen to the oxide is weakened, making it easier to form oxygen vacancies. This results in a more reactive surface that can oxidize CO more efficiently. The lower the ΔEv, the more reactive the surface is, and the better the catalytic activity. The mechanism is catalytic because the oxygen vacancy is refilled by the reaction of the oxygen molecule with gas-phase CO, which releases CO2 and leaves behind an oxygen atom that fills the vacancy, restoring the surface to its initial state.

1.火星-范克雷维尔机制在氧化物催化的氧化反应中通过涉及氧化物表面上氧空位的形成和重组来运作。形成氧空位所需的能量(ΔEv)在确定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力方面具有重要意义。当氧化物被掺杂，如用Au，表面氧与氧化物的键被削弱，使形成氧空位变得更容易。这导致一个更具反应性的表面，可以更有效地氧化CO。ΔEv越低，表面的反应性越强，催化活性越好。该机制是催化性的，因为氧分子与气相CO的反应填补了氧空位，释放CO2，并留下一个氧原子填充空位，使表面恢复到初始状态。
