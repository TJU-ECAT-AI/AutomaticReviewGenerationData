[1] "The oxidation takes place by a Mars-van Krevelen mechanism;"

[2] "To determine to what extent the oxide becomes a better oxidant when doped with Au, we have calcu- lated the energy (Evf) required for removing one of the oxygen atoms to form a vacancy in the surface layer and half an oxygen molecule in the gas phase."

[3] "Doping weakens dramatically the bond of surface oxygen to the oxide, even when a Ti atom is substituted by Au in the slab sub layer (not shown)."

[4] "On the other hand, CO oxidation by using any one of the four oxygen atoms of theAuxTi1xO2 surface is exothermic; on this surface CO oxidation is thermodynamically favored."

[5] "However, O2 binds more weakly on an bridging-oxygen vacancy on the Au-doped (DeO2  0:68 eV) than on a pure TiO2(110) surface (DeO2  2:80 eV)."

[6] "After adsorption, the oxygen molecule reacts with gas-phase CO to form a carbonate (figure 1e), with a very substantial release of energy (about 4 eV). This complex decomposes to release CO2 and leaves behind an oxygen atom that fills the vacancy. This restores the surface to its initial state, which means that this set of reactions is catalytic."

1.The oxidation process occurs through the Mars-van Krevelen mechanism, which involves the transfer of oxygen from the oxide surface to the reactant, in this case, CO. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) is crucial as it determines the ease with which oxygen can be transferred from the oxide surface, thereby affecting the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide. Doping with Au significantly weakens the bond of surface oxygen to the oxide, making it easier to form oxygen vacancies and thus enhancing the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. This results in a more favorable thermodynamic condition for CO oxidation on the doped oxide surface compared to the undoped one.

1.氧化过程通过Mars-van Krevelen机制进行，该机制涉及从氧化物表面向反应物（在这种情况下为CO）转移氧。形成氧空位所需的能量（ΔEv）至关重要，因为它决定了氧从氧化物表面转移的难易程度，从而影响了氧化物的催化活性和氧化能力。用Au掺杂会显著削弱表面氧与氧化物的结合，使形成氧空位变得更容易，从而增强了氧化物表面的氧化能力。这导致与未掺杂的氧化物表面相比，在掺杂氧化物表面上CO氧化的热力学条件更为有利。
