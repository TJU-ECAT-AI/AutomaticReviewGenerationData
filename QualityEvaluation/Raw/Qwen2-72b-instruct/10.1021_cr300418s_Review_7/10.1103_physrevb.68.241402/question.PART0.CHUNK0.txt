Using first-principles density-functional calculations we have studied the interactions of molecular oxygen with a partially reduced rutile TiO2 110! surface. In agreement with experiments, a number of different O2 adsorption states, both molecular and dissociated, have been found. The kinetic barriers for conversion between these states have also been calculated. Based on these results, we analyze the mechanism of oxygen vacancy diffusion, recently observed by Scanning Tunneling Microscopy STM!, and suggest a pathway which does not imply the high oxygen adatom reactivity assumed in the original model.

PACS numbers!: 68.43.Bc, 73.20.2r, 82.65.1r The surface properties of titanium dioxide have been in- tensively studied for many years due to the widespread use of this material in heterogeneous catalysis, photocatalysis,and for gas sensors.14 The rutile TiO2 110! surface, in par- ticular, is considered as a prototype system in surface science studies of metal oxides and oxide supported catalysts. It is widely accepted that the reactivity of TiO2(110), as that of many other oxide surfaces, is dominated by defect sites, par- ticularly surface oxygen vacancies. The importance of these defects in a variety of surface reactions has been stressed by several experimental and theoretical studies. For instance, it has been shown that H2O dissociation on TiO2(110) only occurs at bridging oxygen vacancy sites.5,6 The chemistry of oxygen on TiO2(110) surfaces is a rela- tively old problem on which renewed interest has been recently focused. Molecular oxygen is typically used to re- store the stoichiometry of ion-sputtered or vacuum-reduced TiO2 surfaces, and has a strong influence on the electronic properties, the geometric structure, and the chemical reactiv- ity of these surfaces. It has been known for a while that O2 does not adsorb on TiO2(110) unless oxygen vacancies are present.1,3,7 More recent experimental studies have shown the existence of three main chemisorption states for O2 on a defective TiO2(110) surface. Yates and co-workers8 reported two molecular species, one dominant around 105 K, and the other above 250 K, the latter dissociating around 400 K. In a subsequent temperature programmed desorption
TPD!
study, Henderson et al.7 also found two molecularly and one dissociatively adsorbed species and proposed that while one molecular species undergoes simple first-order desorption at 410 K the other dissociates giving rise to oxygen adatoms.
Dissociative adsorption was found to be the dominant chan- nel for adsorption temperatures above 150 K,7 with oxygen adatoms being stable up to about 600 K.9 More recently, a STM study by Schaub et al.10 also referred to as STM03!,while confirming the existence of three different oxygen ad- sorbed species, also provided evidence of a new and rather unexpected oxygen-mediated O vacancy diffusion process:oxygen molecules initially asorbed at five-fold coordinated Ti sites (Ti5c) move to the O vacancy where they dissociate;one of the resulting O atoms fills heals! the original va- cancy, while the other is ejected onto a nearby Ti5c site;finally, it was proposed that the latter O adatom is able to capture an adjacent bridging oxygen BO!, thus creating a new surface O vacancy as well as an adsorbed O2 molecule at Ti5c , whereby the process can restart leading to a an ef- fective O vacancy diffusion. Such a high reactivity of the oxygen adatoms calls for a reinterpretation of the O chem- istry of O vacancies on the TiO2(110) surface, according to the authors of STM03.
To provide a framework for a more detailed and quantita- tive understanding of these experimental findings, we have carried out extensive density-functional calculations for the defect-free stoichiometric! and defected partially reduced! 110! surface of TiO2-rutile and its interactions with molecu- lar oxygen. Unlike previous first-principles cluster11 and pe- riodic Hartree-Fock12 calculations of O2 on TiO2(110), we do not restrict our study to equilibrium local minimum! con- figurations but also consider kinetic barriers. We find that no O2 adsorption takes place on the stoichiometric surface,whereas on the defective surface two preferential molecular and one dissociated adsorbed configurations are identified.
We analyze the mechanism of O vacancy diffusion in the presence of adsorbed O2, and provide support for a modified pathway with respect to that originally proposed in STM03.
The computations have been done within the Car- Parrinello approach,13,14 including spin polarization, and us- ing Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof Ref. 15! gradient corrections,ultrasoft pseudopotentials,16 and a kinetic-energy cutoff of 25 200!

Tests using more k-points indicated that this was an adequate approximation, even for the small- est supercell used in this work. The surface was modeled by periodically repeated slabs separated by a 15-Å thick vacuum gap. Four Ti layers were found necessary to obtain converged results. A number of different supercells were used to test size effects, namely, a 132 supercell containing 48 47! atoms in the case of the stoichiometric defective!

0163-1829/2003/6824!/2414024!/$20.00 2003 The American Physical Society 68 241402-1 surface, and two larger 134 and 232 supercells, each con- taining 96 95! atoms. In addition, an even larger 233 su- percell containing 144 143! atoms was used to check the vacancy formation and O2 adsorption energies. Theoretically optimized bulk lattice parameters17 were used. All atoms in the upper three layers of the slab were relaxed using a damped second-order dynamics until the residual forces were less than 0.025 eV/Å, whereas the atoms in the lowest layer were kept fixed in their bulk positions. Constrained minimi- zations along a chosen reaction coordinate have been used to determine the relevant reaction pathways and barriers.
The first step of our study has been an accurate determi- nation of the energy Evf to form a surface BO vacancy, Evf5Etot(def)11/2Etot(O2)2Etot(perf), where Etot(def), Etot(perf) are total energies for the defective and stoichio- metric surfaces, respectively, and Etot(O2) is the energy of an O2 molecule in the gas phase.18 We examined supercells of increasing size, in which an oxygen vacancy was gener- ated by removing a BO of the stoichiometric surface, and then relaxing the resulting system. Since a neutral O atom is removed, formally two electrons are left at the vacancy site.
In contrast to the stoichiometric surface, for which the ground state is a singlet, for the defective surface a triplet state was found to be slightly more stable. In this state the two electrons occupy nonbonding, 3d- like levels which are localized primarily on the Ti atoms near to the removed oxy- gen, and have energies close to the bottom of the conduction band. As shown in Table I, Evf does not depend much on supercell size, except for the smallest 132 supercell. In par- ticular, we notice the similarity of the values obtained with the largest 233 and the 134 and 232 supercells, indicat- ing that the latter provide reasonably converged results for our calculations. The value Evf;3.5 eV that we estimate for the surface BO vacancy agrees fairly well with recent line Density Functional Theory
DFT!
embedded cluster calculations.19 We also compared our surface Evf with the oxygen vacancy formation energy (Evf,bulk) in bulk rutile. Using a bulk supercell of 96 95! atoms ob- tained eliminating the vacuum in the 232 supercell de- scribed above!, we obtained Evf,bulk;5.6 eV, a value close to those found for other oxides.20 Thus Evf;2/3Evf,bulk ,consistent with simple coordination number arguments.
Turning next to the study of O2 adsorption, whereas on the defect-free surface we always found O2 to be energeti- cally less stable than in the gas phase, on the defective sur- face the adsorption is strongly exothermic, indicating that reduced cation sites are required to bind O2. In this case, two main molecular (M1 and M2) and one dissociated D1! ad- sorbed configurations are found see Fig. 1 and Table I!. In all these configurations the ground state of the system de- fective surface 1 adsorbed molecule! is a singlet.
The most stable molecular configuration is M1, in which the adsorbed O2 sits at the vacancy site with its axis parallel to the surface and perpendicular to the bridging oxygen rows, and forms bonds with the two nearest Ti atoms. Pos- sibilities for this species of forming a superoxo like O2 2 or peroxolike
O2
22 species have been discussed in the literature.1 We find that the OuO bond distance is stretched from the calculated gas-phase value of 1.24 Å to 1.45 Å. In contrast to previous suggestions, see, e.g., Ref. 7, such a value of the bond length seems to indicate a peroxolike O2 22 complex.21 At the vacancy site, besides M1, we also found a triplet molecular configuration where the adsorbed O2 is per- pendicular to the surface, but this is about 1 eV less stable than M1. In the molecular M2 configuration, O2 is at a Ti5c site with its axis parallel to the surface, and its binding en- ergy BE! is ;2 eV smaller than for M1. Finally, in the D1 configuration, one oxygen atom fills the vacancy site, thus restoring a perfectly stoichiometric surface, and the other is adsorbed as an adatom above the fivefold Ti somewhat dis- placed towards the nearby surface oxygen!. Interestingly, the M1 and D1 adsorption energies are very close, with energy differences within the typical uncertainty, 0.10.2 eV, of TABLE I. Surface oxygen vacancy formation energy (Evf), O2 adsorption energies (Ea) for the molecu- lar (M1,M2) and dissociated (D1) states, and energy barriers (E#) for M2M1 diffusion and M1(M2) D1 dissociations on defective TiO2 110!.

PHYSICAL REVIEW B 68, 241402R! 2003!
241402-2 DFT calculations the difference is slightly larger, ;0.3 eV,only for the 232 supercell; see Table I!.
To make a closer contact with the available experimental information, a few kinetic barriers have also been calculated see Table I!. A very small value 0.14 eV is found for the M2M1 diffusion barrier. Assuming that O2 is initially ad- sorbed at the Ti5c sites which are much more numerous than the vacancy sites!, diffusion from the M2 to M1 state should be very rapid, as observed in STM03. Once in M1, the O2 molecule may either dissociate or desorb. The computed ac- tivation energy for the M1D1 dissociation is of the order of 1 eV, i.e., much smaller than the M1 adsorption energy.
Thus, with increasing temperature the adsorbed molecule should rather dissociate than desorb, as suggested by TPD measurements.7,8 Moreover, since D1 is entropically much more favorable than M1, such a dissociation may occur even at relatively low, e.g., room, temperature, consistent with
STM03.
In the D1 state, the binding energy of the oxygen adatom
OA!,
referred to the defect-free surface,is
EOA
5Etot(perf)1Etot(O)2Etot(D1);2.2 eV,where Etot(D1) and Etot(O) are total energies of the D1 configu- ration, and the oxygen atom in the 3P state, respectively.
Thus, the recombination of two adatoms to form a gas-phase O2 molecule is thermodynamically favored.18 The rate limit- ing step for the recombination reaction is likely to be the OA diffusion. For this a barrier of a few tenths of an electron volt may be assumed, which is consistent with the observation of oxygen adatoms up to a temperature of ;600 K.9 STM measurements at T;250 K), however, seem to in- dicate that at low adatom densities, instead of recombining and desorb, an oxygen adatom is able to capture a BO, so that an O2 at Ti5c and a new O vacancy are formed.10 In our calculations, the process of BO capture by an OA corre- sponds to a D1M2 transition for which a lower bound estimate of the barrier is the difference in energy between the initial
(D1)
and final
(M2)
states, D1,25Ea(D1) 2Ea(M2)51.58 eV. However, when we tried to directly calculate the barrier using the distance dOO between the OA and the BO as the reaction coordinate, we found that it was rather the adatom to be captured by the BO than vice versa,which is consistent with the fact that the binding energy,;2.2 eV, for the OA is much lower than that, ;7.0 eV, for an oxygen atom at the BO site see Table II!.22 Notwithstand- ing, we were able to determine the barrier for the reverse process of M2D1 dissociation, for which we found E#(M2D1);1.8 eV. From this we can evaluate the bar- rier of BO capture by an OA as E#(D1M2)5E#(M2 D1)1D1,2;3.4 eV. This value appears to be too high to explain the findings in STM03.
A noticeable feature of STM03 is that the density of ad- sorbed O2 molecules is much lower than the density of sur- face vacancy sites. While such a regime is difficult to inves- tigate with our approach, because extremely large surface supercells would be required to realistically model the sys- tem, we tried to obtain some qualitative understanding of the influence of the O vacancy concentration on the O2 adsorp- tion by considering a toy system with two BO vacancies and one adsorbed O2 molecule in a 232 supercell. As shown in Table II, the increase in the number nV of BO vacancies leads to a relatively modest BE increase for the M1 state, a rather large one for M2, and an even larger increase for D1.23 In other words, the dissociated state is very much stabilized when the density of BO vacancies is much! higher than that of adsorbed O2 molecules. This can be attributed to an electronic charge transfer from the excess vacancies which have electronic states near the conduction band! to the oxygen adatom which has electronic states near the valence band!. A consequence of this D1 stabilization is that the difference in binding energy between the BO at the vacancy site and the OA at Ti5c is substantially reduced in our calculations it changes from ;4.8 eV for nV51 to ;3 eV for nV52; see Table II!. As the relative stability of the OA increases, it may seem plausible that its ability to capture a BO should also increase. According to our calcu- lations, however, for nV52 also the difference in energy D1,2 of the D1 vs M2 state increases. Thus the barrier for BO capture by an OA also increases, making the latter process even more unlikely than in the case nV51.
Although the above results may be partly related to our use of a rather unrealistic model, altogether it seems safe to conclude that our calculations do not actually provide sup- port for the mechanism of BO capture by an oxygen adatom,which was hypothesized in STM03. It is, however, possible to reconcile the STM observations with our first-principles results by considering an oxygen vacancy diffusion pathway in which the direct D1M2 conversion actually consists of a two step process involving an M1 intermediate, D1
M1M2. In other words, instead of capturing a BO so
as to form an M2 state, the oxygen adatom in the D1 state first moves towards a BO to form a M1 state, which next transforms into M2. As it can be inferred from Table I, the barrier for the first, D1M1, process is of the order of 1 eV or less, whereas that for the M1M2 diffusion is ;2 eV.
Although rather large, the latter is definitely more accessible than that for the direct D1M2 process. In addition, the M1M2 should become easier at higher vacancy con- centrations, since M2 is in this case stabilized with respect to
M1. This may be actually the main reason why the oxygen
mediated O vacancy diffusion is seen at high vacancy con- centration.

OXYGEN VACANCY MEDIATED ADSORPTION AND . . .
PHYSICAL REVIEW B 68, 241402R! 2003!
241402-3 configurations for adsorbed O2 have been identified, which are in overall good agreement with a variety of experimental observations. In addition, energy barriers between the oxy- gen adsorption states have been calculated. Based on all these results, we analyze the mechanism of a recently ob- served oxygen-mediated O vacancy diffusion process on TiO2(110). Our results, while supporting these observations,suggest a revised pathway where the oxygen adatoms still play a central role, as found in STM03, but are not as highly reactive as originally proposed. Oxygen-assisted O vacancy diffusion thus results from transformations among the sev- eral different O2 adsorption states, of comparable energies and separated by not too large barriers, which are available especially when the O vacancy concentration is larger than that of adsorbed O2.
