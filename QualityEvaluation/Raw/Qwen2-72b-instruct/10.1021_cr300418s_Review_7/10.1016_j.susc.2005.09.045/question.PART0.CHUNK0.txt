Electronic structure of the CeO2(110) surface oxygen vacancy Bjo rn Herschend, Micael Baudin, Kersti Hermansson * Department of Materials Chemistry, The A ngstro m Laboratory, Uppsala University, Box 538, S-751 21 Uppsala, Sweden Received 8 June 2005; accepted for publication 30 September 2005 Available online 2 November 2005 Abstract The oxygen vacancy formation on the CeO2(110) surface has been studied by ab initio electronic structure calcula- tions. Embedded-cluster calculations with explicit treatment of the electron correlation from MllerPlesset perturba- tion theory (MP2) provide an alternative description of the surface O vacancy compared to previously reported periodic density functional theory (DFT) calculations. The electronic structure at the MP2 level shows a complete localization of the excess electrons on the two surface Ce ions neighboring the vacancy, contrary to the delocalized description seen in the periodic DFT calculations for the CeO2(110) surface (but more in line with DFT+U results recently reported for the partially reduced CeO2 bulk and (001)-surface). Our calculations predict a vacancy formation energy (3.1
3.3 eV at the MP2 level including basis set superposition error (BSSE) correction) and a geometric structure in quali-
tative agreement with the periodic DFT results, where the surface O ion next to the vacancy assumes a bridging position between the reduced Ce ions. 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

1. Introduction
The oxygen storage capacity (OSC) is one of the properties of ceria (CeO2) that makes it an impor- tant material for use in automotive three-way cat- alysts [1]. By releasing and storing oxygen during fuel-rich and lean conditions, an optimal oxygen pressure for the catalytic removal of harmful exhaust gases can be maintained. This is achieved by partial reduction/oxidation of the CeO2 and is related to the chemistry of oxygen vacancies in the material. Therefore, an atomic-level, structural and electronic, understanding of the effects of oxy- gen vacancy formation is crucial for a complete description of the mechanisms involved in the par- tial reduction/oxidation connected with the OSC 0039-6028/$ - see front matter  2005 Elsevier B.V.

SO2
by CeO2 oxygen vacancies in the reaction 2CO + SO2 ! 2CO2 + S [2], showing that ceria itself takes an active part in the removal of harmful exhaust gases and that the catalytic importance of the redox behavior of ceria extends further than the OSC.
Ceria surfaces have been studied theoretically by both force-field (FF) based methods [38] and electronic structure calculations [811]. Although the absolute surface energies obtained by the dif- ferent methods differ, the sequence of stability for the low-index surfaces is the same in all of these studies, with (111) being the most stable and (001) the least stable. The (110) surface has been found to be metastable: although higher in energy than the (111) surface, molecular dynamics (MD) sim- ulations indicate that the (110) surface is relatively stable compared to the (001) surface, which recon- structs at 300 K [6]. The metastable (110) surface is especially interesting for catalytic purposes since it can be expected to be more active than the (111) surface. This is supported by both force-field based [3,4] and electronic structure calculations [10],which have shown that surface oxygen vacancies are more stable on the (110) surface compared to the (111) surface.
The formation and behavior of O vacancies in CeO2 bulk and surface have been modeled using periodic plane-wave density functional theory (DFT) [1015] and static [3,4] and dynamic [7] force-field methods. The force-field calculations suggest that the O vacancy is more stable at the surface than in the bulk [3,4]. This is partly sup- ported by the periodic DFT calculations [10],where, as mentioned above, surface vacancies were found to be more stable at the more open (110) surface than at the denser (111) surface, but Ref.
[10] also indicates that, for the (111) surface, O vacancies in the sub-surface layer are the most sta- ble. Recent DFT calculations, supported by scan- ning tunneling microscopy results [15], indicate that the formation energies for the surface and sub-surface O vacancy at the CeO2(111) surface are virtually the same. The relaxed geometry around the (110) surface O vacancy found in Ref. [10] is an arrangement where the O ion next to the vacancy has moved outwards from the sur- face and away from its original position to form a bridge between two Ce ions closest to the vacancy (cf. Fig. 6a which also shows this structural effect).
The theoretically observed surface relaxation induced by the O vacancy thus involves the O ion nearby moving closer to the vacancy, which sug- gests that the electrons are not trapped in the vacancy, as in the case of the MgO(001) surface [16]. This is further supported by periodic DFT results for partial reduction of bulk ceria [12],where the vacancy formation energy was found to be lowered by confining the electrons to the f-core levels of two Ce ions close to the vacancy. This is also in agreement with force-field calculations [3],which showed an energy penalty when separating the Ce3+ ions from the O vacancy on the (111) sur- face. However, for the O vacancy at the (110) sur- face, the force-field calculations in Ref. [3] showed the opposite result, namely that the separation of the Ce3+ ions from the vacancy site should be ener- getically favorable. The periodic DFT calculations for the O vacancy formation at the CeO2(110) and (111) surfaces in Ref. [10] showed no localization of the electrons on the Ce ions but rather a delocal- ization over f-levels of all the Ce ions in the top three layers of the surface. Furthermore, these cal- culations indicated only a minor effect of spin polarization, where a parallel ordering of small magnetic moments (0.2 lB on each Ce ion) was found to be slightly preferred energetically.
In a paper by Nolan et al. [11] periodic DFT+U calculations have been presented for O vacancies at the relaxed CeO2(100) surface using U = 5 eV.
The authors investigated different values of the U parameter ranging from 2 to 7 eV. Below 5 eV, sig- nificant delocalization was still found, but for 5 eV and above, the result converged to a localized description. The U = 5 eV was chosen to match experimental UPS/XPS measurement for partially reduced CeO2(111) [18,20] which makes this approach somewhat empirical.
In this context, a comparison with a recent report on oxygen vacancy formation in bulk ceria from periodic DFT calculations [13] is interesting.
In Ref. [13], localization of the electrons at the Ce ions closest to the vacancy was found even when the Ce f-levels were treated as valence states. The 174
B. Herschend et al. / Surface Science 599 (2005) 173186
authors showed that the delocalized state is a local minimum of the electronic structure, and that there exists a localized state at a lower energy.
However, this result has now been explained as an artefact of the pseudopotentials used in Ref.
[13], since this localized state could not be repro- duced in all-electron DFT calculations [14]. How- ever, both the pseudopotential calculations and the all-electron calculations agree in that a local- ized state can be reached by using a DFT+U approach. The Hubbard-U term used in Ref.
[13], was defined in terms of maximally localized Wannier functions with a calculated U value between 1.5 and 2 eV. Furthermore, an initial separation of the excess electrons still resulted in a final electronic structure where two Ce ions neighboring the vacancy were reduced, indicating that, for bulk ceria, separation of the vacancy and the Ce3+ ions is unfavorable. These trends were obtained both using the generalized gradient approximation
(GGA)
and the local density approximation (LDA), but the vacancy formation energy given by LDA+U was in better agreement with experiment compared to GGA+U.
Experimentally, ultraviolet- (UPS) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) results [1720] have shown that localized states in the band gap become occupied when the surface is partially reduced and that the top of the valence band spec- trum for the partially reduced ceria can be described as a combination of spectra for fully reduced Ce3+ and fully oxidized Ce4+, suggesting a localization of electrons on the reduced Ce ions.
These occupied gap-states appear
1.21.5 eV
above the O 2p-band and have been identified as localized Ce 4f-states. This picture also supports the interpretation of the electronic conductivity in partially reduced ceria as originating from a polaron hopping mechanism [21].
We conclude that the chemistry of oxygen vacancies in ceria is gradually becoming more well understood, clearly favoring a localized descrip- tion of the f-electrons for partially reduced ceria.
However, the electronic structure calculations,summarized above, have been unable to give con- sistent results concerning this localization.
In the present paper we present ab initio embed- ded-cluster calculations for O vacancy formation on the CeO2(110) surface. By using a cluster approach rather than a periodic approach we can apply wavefunction-based methods with explicit treatment of correlation effects, which will give important complementary results to the previous periodic DFT results for bulk and surface ceria.
The main goal of the paper is to investigate whether or not wavefunction-based methods (Har- treeFock (HF) and beyond) will give rise to a localized excess electron density for the reduced ceria (110) surface. As summarized above, for ceria, this type of localization has so far only been obtained using DFT modified with a Hubbard (U) term in different ways [11,13,14].
From our brief survey of DFT results given above it is clear that the resulting electronic fea- tures of the oxygen vacancy is very sensitive to the methodological details. In the present embed- ded-cluster study we have made an effort to evaluate the sensitivity of our results to the quan- tum-mechanical (QM) level chosen, the effect of dif- ferent cluster sizes, the difference between different spin states, the difference between an unrestricted and a restricted open-shell approach and the effect of the basis set superposition error (BSSE) (see Section 3.1). We present the vacancy formation energy and spin density for reduced CeO2 clusters with and without accounting for relaxation occur- ring as a consequence of the formation of the O vacancy. For the relaxed reduced surface, the clus- ter electronic density of states (DOS) is also analyzed.
This paper is arranged as follows: First we briefly describe the cluster approach used in this paper, and the force-field simulation and ab initio methods involved (Section 2). We then proceed to test the methodology used by presenting vacancy formation energies, spin densities and DOSs for the unrelaxed, reduced CeO2 surface using both unrestricted (U) and restricted open-shell (RO) HartreeFock (HF) methods as well as the Ml- lerPlesset many-body perturbation theory to the second order (MP2) (Section 3.2). Spin densities calculated at the ROHF level for two clusters of different sizes are compared to justify our choice of cluster size. Furthermore, the effect of including or excluding O basis functions in the vacancy is discussed in the context of the BSSE for the O

175 vacancy formation energy. We then discuss the effects of relaxation in the reduced cluster, again analyzing the results in terms of vacancy forma- tion energy, spin density and DOS (Section 3.3).
In Section 4 the conclusions of this work are summarized.
2. Method
2.1. The CeO2(110) surface system
The CeO2 crystal adopts the fluorite structure.
The (110) surface consists of rows of Ce and O ions parallel to the 1 10 direction (Fig. 1) and the planes parallel to the surface maintain a CeO2 stoichiometry.
In this work, the geometry of the defect-free CeO2(110) surface was obtained from a force-field based molecular dynamics (MD) simulation at low temperature and thus includes the effects of surface structure relaxation. This should constitute a more realistic surface structure than an unrelaxed bulk- terminated surface and it provides a suitable start- ing point for our embedded-cluster calculations.
The MD simulation was performed using a recently developed interatomic shell-model poten- tial for CeO2 [7]. The MD code used here treats the slab systems as explicitly 2D, where long-range Coulomb interactions are treated using a 2D Ewald summation technique.
Further details about the MD code can be found elsewhere [7,23]. The MD slab simulation box was 16 layers thick, contained 288 ions and had initial dimen- sions 10.820 A
· 11.476 A
· 28.691 A
along the [001], 1 10 and [110] directions, respectively,which corresponds to the optimized bulk structure for this force-field. To obtain a relaxed structure for the (110) surface, a NVT simulation was run for 1.0 ps (after 1.0 ps of equilibration) at 10 K, using a time-step of 0.1 fs, and the average ionic positions from this simulation gave the relaxed surface structure used for the defect-free CeO(110) slab in this study. Incidentally, it was previously shown that the relaxed slab geometry determined in this way, with the force-field used here, agrees well with periodic DFT results [8].
Subsequently, an oxygen vacancy was created on the defect-free CeO2(110) surface and studied with ab initio embedded cluster calculations,as described in the following sections.
2.2. The embedded cluster
The embedded-cluster scheme used in this study has previously been described in detail [22]. From the periodic slab, simulated by classical force-field methods at 10 K as described in Section 2.1, quan- tum mechanical (QM) clusters were selected from one side of the slab, inside a spherical region of [001] [110] (b) (a) Ce (full basis) Ce (red. basis)

radius 15 A , centered between two surface Ce ions along the 1 10 direction (Fig. 1). The Ce ions closest to the QM cluster were replaced by effective core potentials (ECPs) and the remaining ions residing inside the 15 A radius, but outside the QM cluster, were treated as point charges (PCs),using the charges of the shell-model ions (both core and shell charges) used in the MD simulation (see Section 2.1).
To account for the long-range Coulombic inter- actions in the slab, a set of 4434 PCs on the surface of a sphere (of radius 15 A ) surrounding the cluster were fitted to mimic the Madelung potential within the whole region of the cluster. The Madelung potential was calculated from the infinite surround- ing slab using the two-dimensional (2D) Ewald sum- mation technique. The fitted PCs reproduce the Madelung potential with a standard deviation of
0.004 meV
within the whole cluster region.
Embedding the clusters in this manner has been shown to give an electron density in the cluster and an electrostatic potential inside and above the clus- ter in close agreement with equivalent periodic calcu- lations [22], i.e., preformed with the same atomic basis sets and at the same computational level.
2.3. Ab initio calculations
A Ce10O20 cluster (Fig. 1) has been used in all embedded-cluster calculations in this paper, except where otherwise stated. This cluster was made three layers thick, and consisted of Ce2O8 in the first layer, Ce6O8 in the second and Ce2O4 in the third. The two most central Ce ions in both the surface layer and the first sub-surface layer were described using the full Ce basis set (see below),while the remaining 6 Ce ions were described with a reduced version of the full basis set, without f- functions and the most diffuse sp-shell. These Ce ions were assumed to be close to Ce4+ and to remain unchanged when the cluster was reduced and could therefore be described without f-func- tions. This reduced basis set has previously been used in periodic HF calculations [9].
To test the adequacy of the Ce10O20 cluster, a larger Ce14O28 (Fig. 2) cluster was also used. This cluster was also three layers thick but consisted of Ce8O14 in the top layer, Ce6O12 in the second and Ce0O2 in the third layer. Here, all 8 surface Ce ions were treated with the full basis set and the remain- ing 6 Ce ions (in the second layer) were described with the reduced basis set. Using higher-quality basis sets for the inner region of a cluster com- pared to the outer region does introduce a basis- set inconsistency in the system. However, such an approach has successfully been used in the past,for example in cluster calculations of MgO [24].
Calculations were also performed for reduced clusters containing an oxygen vacancy formed by removing one of the central surface O atoms (a comparison of Figs. 1 and 6 shows which atom is removed). We will denote the reduced clusters Ce10O19h and Ce14O27h in the following.
The QM calculations were performed at the UHF, ROHF, UMP2 and ROMP2 levels of the- ory using the Gaussian98 [25] and Gaussian03 (b) (a) Fig. 2. Structure of the unoptimized Ce14O28 cluster. (a) Top view and (b) side view. The atomic coloring, size scheme and orientation is the same as in Fig. 1.

177 [26] programs. The full basis set for Ce was the SBKJC VDZ ECP basis set with a 46-electron [Kr]4d10 effective core potential (ECP) [27]. The reduced basis set used for the Ce4+ ions was a reoptimized version of the full basis set without the f-functions and the most diffuse sp-shell, as constructed and previously used by Gennard et al. [9]. The basis set used for the O ions was a 8-51G split-valence basis set [28], previously used for several oxides, including ceria [9]. For the ECPs surrounding the cluster (cf. Section 2.2),the CRENBL 54-electron ECPs were used [29].
The relaxation effect for the reduced Ce10O19h cluster turned out to be substantial and was taken into account by relaxing the two Ce ions and the O ion in the surface layer closest to the vacancy.
Calculations not allowing relaxation effects during the reduction process are discussed in Section 3.2,calculations including relaxation are discussed in Section 3.3.
To have access to a comparable reference sys- tem for the discussion of the relaxation effects,an equivalent optimization by ab initio methods was performed for the unreduced (force-field relaxed) Ce10O20 cluster, where the position of the O ion later to be removed was optimized as well. The optimizations were carried out at both the UHF and ROHF levels and correlation effects were estimated using UMP2 and ROMP2, respec- tively, for these optimized geometries. It was found that optimization of the position of the central sur- face ions in the unreduced slab leads to small structural modifications compared to the 10 K FF geometry. The changes in the CeCe, OO and CeO distances are only 0.010.03 A and the O ions relax outwards from the surface compared to the force-field structure by 0.08 A and the Ce ions relax 0.04 A inwards. For oxygen this reverses the slight interplanar contraction between the first and second surface layers obtained with the force- field, whereas for Ce, the interplanar distance decreases, reinforcing the relaxation found with the force-field. In other words, the rumpling of the surface increases slightly, but the interplanar relaxation is somewhat reversed. These changes must be expected since the optimal lattice para- meter from the force-field calculations (which coincides with the experimental value of 5.41 A ) differs from the optimal lattice parameter at the HF level, which is slightly larger (5.546 A ) [9].
However, these changes in geometry are smaller than the geometric changes caused by the vacancy formation and only lowers the total energy by
0.14 eV, which is small compared to the vacancy
formation energy. Thus the force field we have used in the present study seems to provide an ade- quate relaxed surface structure on which to base our embedded-cluster approach for studying the electronic structure of an oxygen vacancy in CeO2.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Properties analyzed
The cluster calculations were analyzed with respect to three main properties: the vacancy for- mation energy, the spin density and the DOS.
3.1.1. Vacancy formation energies
The vacancy formation energy was calculated as Evac  ECeO2red  1 2EO2  ECeO2;1 where E(CeO2) is the total energy of the unreduced embedded-cluster, E(CeO2(red)) is the total energy for the same cluster with one O vacancy, and E(O2) is the total energy of a O2 molecule. This is the standard definition of the vacancy formation energy in which the released oxygen atom is as- sumed to form oxygen gas. However, this defini- tion does not allow counterpoise correction of the BSSE to be carried out directly, since the O2 molecule is not present in the total system. If in- stead we calculate the energy of removing an oxy- gen atom, Ered, Ered  ECeO2red  EO  ECeO2;2 the basis set superposition correction (BSSC) can be calculated using the standard counterpoise method. Evac differs from Ered by half the binding energy of an O2 molecule. Thus, by calculating the binding energy of the O2 molecule with the same method as used in the cluster calculations, sub- tracting half of that value from Ered, a vacancy for- mation energy (Evac) corrected for the BSSE can 178
B. Herschend et al. / Surface Science 599 (2005) 173186
be obtained using the counterpoise method. We have chosen to present both Evac and Ered. The Evac is most easily compared to other published vacancy formation energies. However, errors in the O2 binding energy might obscure the Evac re- sults and therefore Ered itself is also reported (see Section 3.3). The O2 binding energy (BSSE-cor- rected) was calculated at the ROHF and UHF lev- els (1.23 eV and 1.47 eV, respectively) as well as at the ROMP2 and UMP2 levels (5.86 eV and
5.41 eV, respectively, using the optimized ROHF
and UHF geometries, to match the approach used in the optimized cluster calculations). These bind- ing energies have also been used for the unrelaxed clusters although the choice of O2 binding energy in these cases is arbitrary since no geometry opti- mization is performed.
3.1.2. Spin densities
The spin density qab = qa  qb was calculated for the reduced clusters in the triplet state. We have analyzed the complete 3D spin density for all the reduced clusters, but for the sake of clarity we have chosen to display only those 2D cross-sec- tions which give the most representative picture of the qab distribution. For the unrelaxed cluster, a horizontal cross-section in the plane of the surface Ce ions was selected (Fig. 1b). This section has been used for the relaxed clusters as well (Fig. 6b). Due to the surface relaxation some ionic positions deviates slightly (0.04 A ) from the plane of the cross-section, but the qab maps still give a representative picture of the spin density for these ions. In order to see the qab distribution for the O bridge ion, a vertical cross-section trough the O bridge and its nearest Ce neighbors has also been used (Fig. 6a). Finally, a vertical cross-sec- tion through only one of the Ce ions next to the vacancy has been used to give a better view of the shape of the spin density distribution in the relaxed cluster (Fig. 6a).
3.1.3. Electronic density of states
Because the clusters are fairly large, conven- tional energy level-diagrams become impractical in the analysis of the one-electron eigenvalues from the cluster calculations. Instead, the density of states (DOS) was calculated by constructing a histogram from the one-electron eigenvalues of the cluster calculation. The DOS is a property mostly discussed in connection with periodic cal- culations, where it is calculated by integrating the one-electron eigenvalues over the Brilluoin Zone,thereby including all possible eigenvalues of the infinite crystal. However, integrating the eigen- values for a large enough cluster should result in a DOS similar to that of the infinite crystal, which motivates a qualitative comparison with results from periodic electronic structure calculations. It has been shown previously that the DOS calcu- lated for clusters similar to those used here compare well with the DOS from periodic calcula- tions [30].
3.2. Reduction without geometry optimization
The first step in this study was to perform calcu- lations for the reduction at the CeO2(110) surface without taking into account relaxation effects due to the vacancy formation. For this purpose we per- formed ROMP2 and UMP2 calculations for the reduction of the (force-field relaxed) Ce10O20 clus- ter, where the ionic positions were thus the opti- mized positions from a FF calculation of the stoichiometric CeO2(110) surface, as described in Section 2.1. Since the relaxation upon reduction was neglected, the basis functions of the removed O atom could be kept in the vacancy, which allowed us to estimate the BSSE to the vacancy formation energy (see below).
3.2.1. Spin states, spin density and electron
localization In all calculations for the unrelaxed reduced cluster the spin state was set to a triplet. Calcula- tions for a reduced cluster in the singlet state were performed at the HF level, but this state is higher in energy (by 0.20 eV and 3.63 eV at the ROHF and UHF levels, respectively) compared to the triplet. Spin contamination in the unrestricted cal- culations was found to be small. The difference electron density between the triplet and the singlet states (from ROHF) of the Ce10O19h cluster in the surface plane shows that the triplet favors an increased density at the Ce ions close to the vacancy, whereas the singlet state favors an
B. Herschend et al. / Surface Science 599 (2005) 173186
179 increased density in the vacancy (Fig. 3). This result can be expected since the two excess elec- trons are allowed to share the same space orbital in the singlet state, but not in the triplet state.
Spin density maps in the plane of the surface calculated for the reduced Ce10O19h cluster with and without oxygen basis functions in the vacancy using the UHF, ROHF and the generalized UMP2 electron densities are shown in Fig. 4. From a comparison of Fig. 4a and b we can conclude that the unrestricted and the restricted open-shell approaches give significantly different results. Both methods give most of the spin density localized on the two surface Ce ions closest to the vacancy.
However, with ROHF, a significant part of the spin density is localized in the vacancy itself,whereas for UHF, the spin density is almost exclu- sively localized on the two surface Ce ions. The UMP2 result (Fig. 4c) is similar to the UHF den- sity except that the spin density is somewhat more extended towards the vacancy in the case of
UMP2. From an analysis of the ROHF spin den-
sity over the volume of the entire cluster (not shown in this paper), some spin density was also found on the Ce ion in the second layer closest to the vacancy; however, significantly less than for the surface Ce ions. No spin density was seen for any of the other sub-surface Ce ions. A com- parison of Fig. 4ac with Fig. 4df shows that for
ROHF
the spin density in the vacancy decreases when the oxygen basis functions are removed, while for UHF and UMP2 the effect is less obvious. This is also clearly seen from the Mulliken analysis,where 0.20e (ROHF) and ρ(Triplet Singlet)

occupy the oxygen basis functions in the vacancy.
However, the BSSC to Evac and Ered is only slightly smaller for the unrestricted methods com- pared to the restricted open-shell results (Table 1).
3.2.2. The effect of cluster size
Our embedded Ce10O20 cluster is sufficiently large to describe the CeO2(110) surface with good accuracy in terms of electrostatic properties and electronic structure. However, the introduction of an O vacancy is seen to drastically change the elec- tronic structure of the system and recent periodic DFT calculations [10] even suggest that the two electrons remaining when a neutral oxygen is removed, will be delocalized. Our present cluster results (without allowing for relaxation upon reduction) show that the predominant part of the spin density is localized to a small region in the sur- face layer. However, only two Ce ions in the surface layer and two ions the second layer have the full basis set, which may artificially prevent the electrons from delocalizing. Therefore we have also performed calculations using a Ce14O28 clus- ter where 8 surface Ce ions were treated with the full basis set. Fig. 5a and b show the ROHF spin density maps in the surface plane of the reduced Ce10O19h and Ce14O27h clusters, respectively.
The two maps are almost indistinguishable and there seems to be no tendency for the electrons to delocalize in any of the clusters nor for the Ce3+ ions to separate from the vacancy (which was previously found in some force-field based cal- culations [3]). We therefore conclude that the elec- tron localization seen for the Ce10O19h cluster is not an artefact of the limited cluster size and the use of the smaller cluster in the subsequent calcu- lations appears to be justified.
3.2.3. Vacancy formation energies
The vacancy formation energies resulting with the various methods are listed in Table 1. The Ered energies are seen to differ significantly between the unrestricted and restricted open-shell approaches,expecially for the HF methods but also at the MP2 level. The HF methods give lower Ered ener- gies than their respective MP2 values, which can be expected since the HF method generally under- estimates binding energies. For the Evac values, the difference between HF and MP2 is smaller (and for RO reversed) due to the large difference in the esti- mated binding energy of O2 between the methods.
The reason for the differences between the UHF and ROHF results (Ered,Evac and qab) can be Table 1 Vacancy formation energies Evac and Ered (as defined in Section 3) (in eV) from HF and MP2 calculations for the unrelaxed Ce10O19h cluster Method Ered Evac

181 found by performing an UHF calculation using the ROHF solution as an initial wavefunction.
The UHF calculation then converges to a state which displays a spin density almost identical to the ROHF solution. This state is 3.6 eV higher in energy than the previous UHF calculation and is clearly not the ground state, which explains the significant differences seen between the restricted open-shell and unrestricted methods. However,even when using the UHF wavefunction as a start- ing point, the ROHF solution has not been able to converge to a lower energy.
3.3. Reduction with geometry optimization
When the central ions in the cluster were allowed to relax, the UHF and ROHF cluster opti- mizations led to the same minimum structure, in spite of having initially very different electronic structures. The relaxation is significantly larger than the relaxation effects seen for the unreduced cluster (Section 2.3) and therefore the effects of the difference in equilibrium structure for the stoi- chiometric surface between the force field and the ab initio methods (discussed in Section 2.3) should be limited. Upon vacancy formation, the O ion next to the vacancy moves to a position in between the two Ce ions and relaxes out from the surface to form a 2-coordinated bridge between the Ce ions,which in turn are pushed away from each other slightly (Fig. 6). In this relaxed structure the Ce O distance is shorter and the CeCe distance longer than for the unreduced cluster (Table 2).
This is in agreement with previous periodic DFT calculations [10] and previous force-field simula- tions [7], where the O ion closest to the vacancy also assumed a bridging position. In Ref. [10],the surface Ce ions were found to move away from the vacancy center (CeCe distance increases with
0.3 A
) and the CeO distance was shortened (decreases with 0.17 A ).
3.3.1. Vacancy formation energies
The vacancy formation energies including relax- ation effects are listed in Table 3. The optimization lowers the Ered (and Evac) values for both the HF and MP2 calculations, although the MP2 values (Evac = 3.073.26 eV) are less affected. A notable difference compared to the unrelaxed cluster is that the unrestricted and restricted open-shell methods predict similar vacancy formation energies. The MP2 values, which should be considered to be the (a) (b) Fig. 6. Structure of the optimized Ce10O19h cluster. (a) Top view and (b) side view.

most reliable here, show overall agreement with the periodic DFT results (Evac = 3.17 eV) [10] for a 2 · 1 surface unit cell. However, for a 2 · 2 unit cell,the periodic DFT calculations predict a vacancy formation energy of 2.48 eV. Compared to experi- mental values for bulk ceria ranging from 4.6 eV to 5.0 eV [31], our result (Evac = 3.13.3 eV) seems reasonable since the oxygen vacancy is assumed to be more stable at the (110) surface than in the bulk.
However, to the best of our knowledge there exists no directly comparable experimental data. Further- more, to make a quantitative comparison, the geometry optimization performed in our cluster cal- culations should be extended to allow a larger part of the surface to relax.
3.3.2. Spin density
Fig. 7ac show the spin density in the same hor- izontal cross-section as used for the unrelaxed clusters, for ROHF, UHF and UMP2, respec- tively. Spin density maps for a vertical cross-sec- tion including the CeOCe bridge have also been calculated for ROHF, UHF and UMP2 (Fig. 8ac). All three methods are conclusive in that the excess a-electrons completely localize on the two Ce ions in the CeOCe bridge, which is yet another indication that the restricted open- shell and unrestricted approaches now reach simi- lar ground states for the reduced cluster. This localization is confirmed by an analysis of the spin density in the entire volume of the cluster. More- over, from a map of the spin density in a vertical cross-section (perpendicular to both the surface and the plane of the CeOCe bridge) through one of the Ce ions, one can clearly see the shape of an f-orbital (Fig. 9). The f-shaped spin density is thus aligned perpendicular to the CeO bond in the CeOCe bridge, which is also the case for the unrelaxed Ce10O19h cluster. The ROHF, UHF and UMP2 differ only slightly in the shape of the spin density on the Ce ions.
3.3.3. Density of states
The vacancy formation also causes significant changes in the electronic DOS. Fig. 10 shows the DOS for the unreduced cluster (Fig. 10c) as well as the DOS from UHF and ROHF results (Fig. 10a and b, respectively) for the reduced clus- ter. For both UHF and ROHF, new occupied states appear in the band gap when the cluster is reduced, similar to the effect one would expect from introducing an electron-rich dopant, which is in some sense the case when the oxide is partially reduced. A population analysis shows that these states are occupied by the excess a-electrons. How- ever, the two methods differ with respect to the position of these states. For ROHF, the new states Table 3 Vacancy formation energies Evac and Ered (as defined in Section 3) (in eV) from HF and MP2 calculations for the relaxed Ce10O19h cluster Method Ered Evac

183 appear close to the bottom of the conduction band (similar to a n-type semiconductor) whereas for UHF, the states appear at the upper edge of the valence O 2p-band. The UHF result is in some- what better agreement with the experimental XPS and UPS results [1720]. However, the exper- imental valence band spectra have only been reported for the (111) surface and, moreover, the peak position in the DOS plots cannot be directly comparable to XPS and UPS results, since the HF method is known to exaggerate the separation of the bands. From a methodological point of view,it is interesting to note that the DOS plots are very sensitive to the method chosen: the spin contami- nation in UHF was found to be small and the spin density and vacancy formation energy for ROHF and UHF were found to be similar for the relaxed reduced surface, yet there still exists a significant qualitative difference between UHF and ROHF in the description of the electronic structure.

mentations of DFT often wrongly predict metallic ground states, a problem well established in the lit- erature [32] and which originates from errors caused by the self-interaction. It is therefore likely that, for strongly localized f-electrons in partially reduced ceria, LDA/GGA would produce similar artefacts.
This shortcoming would explain the discrepancy between the periodic DFT results of Yang et al.
[10] and our cluster results since, for the wave func- tion based methods used in the present paper, this problem does not appear, thanks to the exact treat- ment of exchange. The inclusion of exact exchange is also the reason for the successful applications of hybrid DFT in studies of strongly correlated mate- rials [33,34]. Incidentally, test calculations of ours using B3LYP for the UHF-optimized reduced clus- ter also indicate localization of the excess electrons to the Ce ions closest to the vacancy.
The agreement in vacancy formation energy between our results and those in Ref. [10] may well be fortuitous. The results for such small periodic cells are not directly comparable to the isolated defect described in the cluster model, and therefore results from larger supercell calculations would be valuable. The cluster model, on the other hand,should be extended to allow more surface ions to relax in order to be more directly comparable to the periodic calculations. The structural agreement between our relaxed vacancy and that of Ref. [10] can hardly be ascribed to fortuity, however. As mentioned in Section 3.3, force-field calculations (see Fig. 3 in Ref. [7]) have also yielded similar relaxed structures around the oxygen vacancy for partially reduced CeO2(110). Moreover, similar structures have been reported for oxygen vacancies in Ca doped ceria [2] where 12.5% of the Ce ions were replaced by Ca2+ ions. These results all sug- gest that the structural relaxation around the oxy- gen vacancy is quite insensitive to the details of the electronic structure at the vacancy, and is rather governed by fundamental rules of electrostatics and/or by coordination effects where the ions move so as to compensate for the missing nega- tively charged O ion. The bridging oxygen struc- ture, where the O ion next to the vacancy moves to a position half way towards the vacancy,between the neighboring surface Ce ions, can be explained by simple symmetry arguments.
4. Conclusions
Using embedded-cluster calculations we have studied the oxygen vacancy formation on the CeO2(110) surface. Our resulting vacancy forma- tion energy (3.13.3 eV from the MP2 calculations for the relaxed reduced cluster) and relaxed geometry around the oxygen vacancy show qual- itative agreement with periodic DFT results [10].
However, we find that, for wavefunction-based methods (HF and MP2), the spin-polarized den- sity of the relaxed vacancy is completely domi- nated by the features at the two Ce ions next to the vacancy. From a population analysis, it is also clear that the excess a-electron density is described almost exclusively by the f-functions of these two reduced Ce ions. This is clearly dif- ferent from the delocalized picture described in Ref. [10] and consistent with a localization of the excess a-electrons.Increasing the size of the cluster (which was tested for the unrelaxed reduced cluster) did not show any significant effect on our embedded clus- ter result, which indicates that the localization is not an artefact of the limited cluster size. Our results are supported by DFT+U results for partially reduced bulk ceria [13] and CeO2(001) [11]. We conclude that it is reasonable to assume that the delocalized electronic structure reported by Yang et al. [10] is caused by self-interaction errors.
In this paper we have also studied the electronic DOS from our cluster calculations. Both the restricted open-shell and the unrestricted approach show two new states appearing in the band gap when the O vacancy is formed. The positions of these states differ significantly between UHF and ROHF, where the former shows slightly better agreement with XPS and UPS measurements.
