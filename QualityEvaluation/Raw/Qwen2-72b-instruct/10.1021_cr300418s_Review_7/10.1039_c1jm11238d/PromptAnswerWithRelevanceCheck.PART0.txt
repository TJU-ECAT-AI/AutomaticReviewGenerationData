1.The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions by involving the redox properties of the oxide surface. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) is significant in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. Lower ΔEv values facilitate the formation of oxygen vacancies, which enhances the oxidative power of the oxide, making it more effective in catalyzing oxidation reactions.

1.The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions by involving the lattice oxygen of the oxide surface in the reaction, where the oxygen is transferred to the reactant, forming an oxygen vacancy on the surface. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) is significant in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. A lower ΔEv indicates a higher rate of oxygen vacancy formation, which enhances the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface.

1.The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions by utilizing the oxygen vacancies on the oxide surface to facilitate the transfer of oxygen to the reactant molecules. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) is significant in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. A lower ΔEv indicates a higher density of oxygen vacancies, which enhances the reactivity of the surface and its ability to oxidize reactants. This is particularly relevant for ceria-based materials, where the presence of oxygen vacancies is crucial for their catalytic performance in reactions such as CO oxidation and NOx reduction.
