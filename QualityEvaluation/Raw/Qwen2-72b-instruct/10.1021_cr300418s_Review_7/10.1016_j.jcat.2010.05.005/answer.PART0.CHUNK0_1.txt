[1] "It is suspected that the density functional theory (DFT) with the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) may not describe accurately the behavior of the electrons in the f-orbitals of the Ce atoms in CeO2. In GGA, the electrons in the f-bands are delocalized over the Ce atoms while it is believed (with good reason) that in reality each electron is localized on a Ce atom. It is hoped, but by no means proven, that this flaw can be cured by introducing in the Hamiltonian a repulsive energy U that tends to localize the f-electrons on the Ce atoms. U is chosen to fit the measured value of some property that is deemed important to the particular application of the theory. In our case, we are interested in getting good values for the total energy and we are using U = 5.5 eV since this reproduces the energy of the reaction Ce2O3 + 1/2O2 ? 2CeO2 and gives accurate values for the lattice parameters of both oxides [33,34]. The LDA + U results are closer to experiments than those obtained with PW91 + U, and the LDA calculations are more efficient. For this reason, we use LDA + U in the present calculations."

[2] "The energy of oxygen-vacancy formation has been measured but the results are at variance due to differences in the method of preparation. It is therefore not possible to compare reliably the values calculated here with experiments. Measurements of the equilibrium between gaseous O2 and ceria have been used to determine the enthalpy of oxygen-vacancy formation, and the results have been reviewed by Mongensen et al. [46]. It was found that when x in CeO2x is 105 the enthalpy of vacancy formation (to generate O2) is 2.6 eV. This is substantially smaller than the value of 3.36 eV obtained by DFT calculations. However, this enthalpy depends strongly on vacancy concentration [46]: for example, it is 4.9 eV when x = 103. However, more recent results have created a great deal of confusion. The energy to form vacan- cies depends on the temperature of calcination: calcining at high temperature leads to a form of ceria that binds oxygen very strongly [47]. It appears that nano-structured ceria releases oxygen more readily than bulk ceria [4851]. A possible, simple explana- tion may be that in systems with very high surface area one detects the formation of surface oxygen vacancies; their formation re- quires lower energy than forming bulk vacancies. Some measure- ments have correlated the uptake or release of oxygen with the area [48]. Nano-rods of ceria displaying the (0 0 1) and (1 1 0) faces are more active in oxidizing CO than nano-particles of ceria [52] which suggests a dependence of the energy to form oxygen vacan- cies on the crystal face, which is supported by computations [53]."

[3] "The state having the lowest energy, for the doped slab, has zero spin polarization. Replacing a Ce atom in the surface layer with a Pt atom causes a change in the atomic positions in the top layer: the oxygen atoms neighboring the Pt dopant are closer to it than they were to the Ce atom that has been substituted: the PtO distance is 2.12 Å while the CeO distance in the pure ceria is 2.33 Å. The 2.12 Å PtO distance in doped ceria is longer than the PtO distance in PtO2 (the measured PtO distance is 1.99 Å and the calculated one is 2.00 Å). As the oxygen atoms get closer to the Pt dopant, their distance to the Ce atoms increases from 2.33 Å to 2.43 Å. This increase in the CeO distance suggests that the strength of this bond is diminished. Furthermore, an increased PtO bond, when compared to that of PtO2, suggests that the PtO bond in doped ceria is not as strong as the PtO bond in PtO2."

[4] "The weakening of the bond between the oxygen atoms neigh- boring the Pt atom is reflected in the change in the energy required for making an oxygen vacancy. To remove an O atom from the top layer of the pure oxide, to form a O2 molecule in the gas phase,costs 3.00 eV. The lowest energy state of a pure ceria slab with an oxygen vacancy in it has Ns = 2 (two unpaired spins). The forma- tion energy for pure ceria is consistent with that calculated by Ganduglia-Pirovano et al. [41]. For the Pt-doped ceria, the forma- tion of an oxygen vacancy, in the top layer, near the dopant, costs 2.15 eV. The lowest energy state of the slab with a vacancy in it has Ns = 0."

1. The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions by involving the redox properties of the oxide surface. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) plays a significant role in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. A lower ΔEv indicates that the oxide can more easily release oxygen, making it a more active oxidant. This is because the oxygen atoms that are easier to remove from the surface are more reactive when exposed to a reductant, such as methane, facilitating the activation of the reductant and the subsequent oxidation reaction.
