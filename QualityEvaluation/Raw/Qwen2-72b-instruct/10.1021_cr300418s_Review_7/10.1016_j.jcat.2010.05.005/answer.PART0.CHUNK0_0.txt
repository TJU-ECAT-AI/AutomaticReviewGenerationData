[1] "It is suspected that the density functional theory (DFT) with the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) may not describe accu- rately the behavior of the electrons in the f-orbitals of the Ce atoms in CeO2. In GGA, the electrons in the f-bands are delocalized over the Ce atoms while it is believed (with good reason) that in reality each electron is localized on a Ce atom. It is hoped, but by no means proven, that this flaw can be cured by introducing in the Hamiltonian a repulsive energy U that tends to localize the f-elec- trons on the Ce atoms. U is chosen to fit the measured value of some property that is deemed important to the particular applica- tion of the theory. In our case, we are interested in getting good values for the total energy and we are using U = 5.5 eV since this reproduces the energy of the reaction Ce2O3 + 1/2O2 ? 2CeO2 and gives accurate values for the lattice parameters of both oxides [33,34]. The LDA + U results are closer to experiments than those obtained with PW91 + U, and the LDA calculations are more effi- cient. For this reason, we use LDA + U in the present calculations."

[2] "The energy of oxygen-vacancy formation has been measured but the results are at variance due to differences in the method of preparation. It is therefore not possible to compare reliably the values calculated here with experiments. Measurements of the equilibrium between gaseous O2 and ceria have been used to determine the enthalpy of oxygen-vacancy formation, and the re- sults have been reviewed by Mongensen et al. [46]. It was found that when x in CeO2x is 105 the enthalpy of vacancy formation (to generate O2) is 2.6 eV. This is substantially smaller than the value of 3.36 eV obtained by DFT calculations. However, this enthalpy depends strongly on vacancy concentration [46]: for example, it is 4.9 eV when x = 103. However, more recent results have created a great deal of confusion. The energy to form vacan- cies depends on the temperature of calcination: calcining at high temperature leads to a form of ceria that binds oxygen very strongly [47]. It appears that nano-structured ceria releases oxygen more readily than bulk ceria [4851]. A possible, simple explana- tion may be that in systems with very high surface area one detects the formation of surface oxygen vacancies; their formation re- quires lower energy than forming bulk vacancies. Some measure- ments have correlated the uptake or release of oxygen with the area [48]. Nano-rods of ceria displaying the (0 0 1) and (1 1 0) faces are more active in oxidizing CO than nano-particles of ceria [52] which suggests a dependence of the energy to form oxygen vacan- cies on the crystal face, which is supported by computations [53]."

1. The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions by involving the redox properties of the oxide surface. In this mechanism, the oxide surface acts as an oxygen reservoir, where oxygen atoms can be removed or added to the surface during the reaction. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) is a critical factor in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. A lower ΔEv indicates that the oxide surface can more easily release oxygen atoms, making it more reactive and a stronger oxidant. This is because the oxygen atoms that are easier to remove from the surface are more active when exposed to a reductant, facilitating the oxidation reaction.

1. Mars-van Krevelen机制在氧化物催化氧化反应中通过涉及氧化物表面的红ox性质起作用。在这种机制中，氧化物表面充当氧库，氧原子可以在反应过程中从表面移除或添加到表面。氧空位形成所需的能量(ΔEv)是确定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力的关键因素。较低的ΔEv表明氧化物表面可以更容易地释放氧原子，使其更具反应性和更强的氧化剂。这是因为从表面更容易移除的氧原子在暴露于还原剂时更活跃，促进了氧化反应。
