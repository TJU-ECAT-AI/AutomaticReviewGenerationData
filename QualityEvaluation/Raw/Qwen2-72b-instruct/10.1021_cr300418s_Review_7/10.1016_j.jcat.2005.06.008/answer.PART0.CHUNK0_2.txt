1. The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism involves alternate reduction and oxidation of the ceria surface with the formation of surface oxygen vacancies as the key step, followed by their replenishment by gas-phase oxygen. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) is related to the stability of different surfaces, with less energy required to form an oxygen vacancy on {110} and {100} surfaces, making them more reactive towards CO. This mechanism is significant in determining the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface, as it influences the rate of CO oxidation.

1. Mars-van Krevelen机制涉及铈表面的交替还原和氧化，表面氧空位的形成是关键步骤，随后由气相氧补充。形成氧空位所需的能量(ΔEv)与不同表面的稳定性有关，{110}和{100}表面上形成氧空位所需的能量较少，使它们对CO更具反应性。这一机制对于确定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力具有重要意义，因为它影响CO氧化的速率。
