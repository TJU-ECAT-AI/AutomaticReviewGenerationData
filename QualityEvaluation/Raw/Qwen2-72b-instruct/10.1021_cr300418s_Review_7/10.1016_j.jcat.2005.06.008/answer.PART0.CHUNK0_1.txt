1. The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism involves alternate reduction and oxidation of the ceria surface with the formation of surface oxygen vacancies as the key step, followed by their replenishment by gas-phase oxygen. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) is related to the stability of different surfaces, with less energy required for less stable surfaces like {110} and {100}, making it easier to accommodate reaction with CO.

1. Mars-van Krevelen机制涉及铈氧化物表面的交替还原和氧化，表面氧空位的形成是关键步骤，随后由气相氧补充。氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）与不同表面的稳定性有关，对于{110}和{100}等不太稳定的表面，所需能量较少，这使得与CO的反应更容易发生。
