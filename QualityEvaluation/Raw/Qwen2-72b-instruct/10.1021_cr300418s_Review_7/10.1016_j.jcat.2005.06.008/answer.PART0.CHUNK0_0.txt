1. The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism involves alternate reduction and oxidation of the ceria surface with the formation of surface oxygen vacancies as the key step, followed by their replenishment by gas-phase oxygen. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) determines the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface, as less energy is required to form an oxygen vacancy on {110} and {100} surfaces, making it easier to accommodate reaction with CO.

1. Mars-van Krevelen机制涉及铈氧化物表面的交替还原和氧化，表面氧空位的形成是关键步骤，随后由气相氧补充。形成氧空位所需的能量(ΔEv)决定了氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力，因为在{110}和{100}表面上形成氧空位所需的能量较少，使得与CO反应更容易进行。
