Read the questions and answers provided below. First, critically assess the overall relevance of the answers provided to the set of questions asked.

If, upon your assessment, you find that the answers do not contain information that is relevant to the questions asked, stop your review process immediately and respond with a single sentence: "※※※※※※※The provided answers are not relevant to the questions.※※※※※※※". Do not provide any additional explanation or background information, only this sentence should be given as a response in case of irrelevant answers.

If, however, the answers are relevant to the questions asked, proceed to compile answers for each question according to the instructions below. Ensure to aggregate all the relevant answers from the multiple answer results provided in the document, and organize them sequentially by their order number, compiling the corresponding quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question.

If the provided answers' quotes are not differentiated by question, ensure to break them down and assign the quotes to each respective question, outputting them separately within each question's section.

To provide a comprehensive review, differentiate the responses into quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question based on the details given in the 'Answer' XML tags. Structure your review using the XML format showcased below if the answers are relevant to the questions asked:

1.The literature does not provide specific information on the Mars-van Krevelen mechanism or the significance of the energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) in determining catalytic activity and oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. However, it does discuss the effect of gold doping on oxygen vacancy formation and CO adsorption on ceria surfaces, indicating that the presence of Au dopants lowers the energy for oxygen vacancy formation, which could enhance the oxidative power of ceria surfaces. The energy required to form a second oxygen vacancy is smaller on the (110) surface than on the (100) surface, suggesting that doping makes the (110) surface a better oxidant.

1.文献没有提供关于Mars-van Krevelen机制或形成氧空位所需能量(ΔEv)在确定氧化物表面催化活性和氧化能力方面的重要性具体信息。但是，它确实讨论了金掺杂对氧空位形成和CO在氧化铈表面吸附的影响，表明Au掺杂剂的存在降低了氧空位形成的能量，这可能增强氧化铈表面的氧化能力。形成第二个氧空位所需的能量在(110)表面上比在(100)表面上小，表明掺杂使(110)表面成为更好的氧化剂。
