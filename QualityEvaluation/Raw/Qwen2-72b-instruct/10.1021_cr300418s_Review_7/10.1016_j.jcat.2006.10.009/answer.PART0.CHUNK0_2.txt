[1] "An essential step in the Marsvan Krevelen oxidation mechanism is the reaction of a surface oxygen atom with a gas-phase reducing agent, to form an oxidation product and an oxygen vacancy on the surface. The high energy required for forming an oxygen vacancy is one reason why oxides perform oxidation reactions at high temperature."

[2] "We expect that the dopant lowers the oxidation temperature by weakening the bond between the oxygen and the oxide. Thus, we can measure the oxidizing capacity of an oxide by calculating the energy needed to form a vacancy. However, it is important to keep in mind that this is not a measure of catalytic activity, because a second important step is the ability to heal the vacancy formed by the oxidation process by adsorbing and activating oxygen from the gas phase."

1. In the Mars-van Krevelen mechanism, a surface oxygen atom reacts with a gas-phase reducing agent to form an oxidation product and an oxygen vacancy on the surface. The energy required for forming an oxygen vacancy, ΔEv, is high, which is why oxides typically perform oxidation reactions at high temperatures. The dopant lowers the oxidation temperature by weakening the bond between the oxygen and the oxide, which can be measured by calculating the energy needed to form a vacancy. However, this is not a direct measure of catalytic activity, as the ability to heal the vacancy by adsorbing and activating oxygen from the gas phase is also crucial.

1. 在Mars-van Krevelen机制中，表面氧原子与气相还原剂反应，形成氧化产物和表面的氧空位。形成氧空位所需的能量ΔEv很高，这就是氧化物通常在高温下进行氧化反应的原因。掺杂剂通过削弱氧与氧化物之间的键来降低氧化温度，这可以通过计算形成空位所需的能量来衡量。然而，这并不是催化活性的直接衡量标准，因为通过从气相吸附和活化氧来修复空位的能力同样重要。
