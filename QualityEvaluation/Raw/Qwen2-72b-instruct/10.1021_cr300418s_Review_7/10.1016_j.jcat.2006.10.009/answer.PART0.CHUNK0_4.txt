[1] "An essential step in the Marsvan Krevelen oxidation mechanism is the reaction of a surface oxygen atom with a gas-phase reducing agent, to form an oxidation product and an oxygen vacancy on the surface. The high energy required for forming an oxygen vacancy is one reason why oxides perform oxidation reactions at high temperature."

[2] "We expect that the dopant lowers the oxidation temperature by weakening the bond between the oxygen and the oxide. Thus, we can measure the oxidizing capacity of an oxide by calculating the energy needed to form a vacancy."

[3] "However, it is important to keep in mind that this is not a measure of catalytic activity, because a second important step is the ability to heal the vacancy formed by the oxidation process by adsorbing and activating oxygen from the gas phase."

1.The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions involves the reaction of a surface oxygen atom with a gas-phase reducing agent, forming an oxidation product and an oxygen vacancy on the surface. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) is significant because it determines the temperature at which oxides can perform oxidation reactions. A high ΔEv leads to high-temperature reactions. Doping weakens the bond between oxygen and the oxide, lowering the oxidation temperature. However, ΔEv is not a direct measure of catalytic activity because the ability to heal the vacancy by adsorbing and activating oxygen from the gas phase is also crucial.

1.在氧化物催化的氧化反应中，Mars-van Krevelen机制涉及表面氧原子与气相还原剂反应，形成氧化产物和表面的氧空位。形成氧空位所需的能量(ΔEv)很重要，因为它决定了氧化物可以进行氧化反应的温度。高ΔEv会导致高温反应。掺杂会削弱氧与氧化物之间的键，从而降低氧化温度。然而，ΔEv并不是催化活性的直接衡量标准，因为通过从气相中吸附和活化氧来修复空位的能力同样重要。
