[1] "An essential step in the Marsvan Krevelen oxidation mechanism is the reaction of a surface oxygen atom with a gas-phase reducing agent, to form an oxidation product and an oxygen vacancy on the surface. The high energy required for forming an oxygen vacancy is one reason why oxides perform oxidation reactions at high temperature."

[2] "We expect that the dopant lowers the oxidation temperature by weakening the bond between the oxygen and the oxide. Thus, we can measure the oxidizing capacity of an oxide by calculating the energy needed to form a vacancy."

[3] "However, it is important to keep in mind that this is not a measure of catalytic activity, because a second important step is the ability to heal the vacancy formed by the oxidation process by adsorbing and activating oxygen from the gas phase."

1.The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions involves the reaction of a surface oxygen atom with a gas-phase reducing agent, forming an oxidation product and an oxygen vacancy on the surface. The energy required for forming an oxygen vacancy (ΔEv) is significant because it determines the temperature at which oxides perform oxidation reactions, typically at high temperatures due to the high energy required for vacancy formation. Doping can lower the oxidation temperature by weakening the bond between the oxygen and the oxide, which can be measured by calculating the energy needed to form a vacancy. However, this does not directly measure catalytic activity, as the ability to heal the vacancy by adsorbing and activating oxygen from the gas phase is also a critical step.

1.在氧化物催化的氧化反应中，Mars-van Krevelen机制涉及表面氧原子与气相还原剂反应，形成氧化产物和表面的氧空位。形成氧空位所需的能量(ΔEv)是重要的，因为它决定了氧化物执行氧化反应的温度，通常由于形成空位所需的高能量，反应在高温下进行。掺杂可以通过削弱氧和氧化物之间的键来降低氧化温度，这可以通过计算形成空位所需的能量来衡量。然而，这并不直接衡量催化活性，因为通过从气相吸附和活化氧来愈合空位的能力也是关键的一步。
