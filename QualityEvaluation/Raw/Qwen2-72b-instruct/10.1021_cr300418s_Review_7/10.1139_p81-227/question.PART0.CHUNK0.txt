I. Introduction
Aluminum, which substitutes for silicon in crys- talline quartz, is contained in various radiation- induced trapped-hole species. This field has been recently reviewed (1, 2). The most prominent center, [AlO,I0, was first studied by Griffiths et al. (3,4) using electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) and interpreted by O'Brien and Pryce (5) and by O'Brien (6). It is formed during irradiation by gamma-rays, X-rays, electrons, or neutrons (4) and can also be created electrolytically (7, 8). 'Now at Argonne National Laboratory, Argonne, IL 60439,
U.S.A.
ZTo whom correspondence should be addressed.The X-band EPR spectra of [AlO,I0 exhibit complex hyperfine structure from Z7Al
(I = 512,
100% abundance). Simulated stick spectra calcu- lated by Griffiths et al. using their reported spin- Hamiltonian gave relatively satisfactory agreement with their experimental spectra (4). Based on the "unique" principal direction of g along a Si-Si direction, the aluminum nuclear quadrupole direc- tion along a Si-0 direction, and on the smallness of the hyperfine interaction, they postulated that an electron hole is trapped in a nonbonding p-orbital of an oxygen anion linking two silicon sites, with one of the silicon cations replaced by aluminum.

1697 noted that the oxygen ions of a SiO, group are equivalent in pairs and that only oxygens of one of these pairs trap the hole. Taylor and Farnell (9) showed that the hole associated with a given aluminum impurity moves back and forth between the two oxygens.
Schnadt and Schneider (10) suggested that the trapped hole in [A104]0 may be thought of as a bound small polaron. Based on the polaron model, Schirmer ( I  I )  considered the optical absorption associated with [AIO4l0 as a light-induced hole transfer from one oxygen to an equivalent one. acting against the self-induced trapping potential,whereas previous attempts (6, 10, 12) to explain the optical bands had used transitions between orbitals of a single oxygen anion. Nassau and Prescott (13) have now shown that only one optical band is directly related to [AlO4I0. Measurements by Barker (14, 15) using electron nuclear double resonance (ENDOR) provided somewhat more accurate values for some of the spin-Hamiltonian parameters.The spin-Hamiltonian parameters have now been redetermined and extended to include "0 and ?'Si hyperfine matrices. One goal is to provide accurate spin-Hamiltonian data to enable under- standing of the local distortions at the [A104]0 complex. Low temperature structural data for quartz have recently become available (16, 17) for comparison with the EPR data. Another goal is to remove discrepancies and confusions existing in the literature. as well as to provide reliable data for comparison between [A104]0,and the closely re- lated centers [AIO,/M+]+ (18, 19) and [AlO,]+ (20-22).We intend the description herein of sample characterization (handedness, coordinate system usage) to be sufficiently detailed that future publi- cations dealing with a-quartz will avoid the inade- quacies of the past. 1 1 .Symmetry and Crystal Structure of a-Quartz Alpha-quartz exists in two enantiomorphic forms (left- and right-quartz) having structures which belong to trigonal space groups. This situa- tion has given rise to considerable confusion (and often error!) in the literature through the choice by various researchers of different conventions for the description of quartz properties, often presented without adequate documentation. This problem has been discussed by several authors (23-26). The space groups of the left- and right-quartz lattices are P3,21 and P3,21, respectively,when using a right-handed coordinate system. A hexagonal unit cell is used, the reference coordinate system being formed by two axes, a, and a,, at an angle of 120" and a third axis c 1 1  a, x a, to give a right-handed system. The atomic coordinates are given as frac- tions of the unit cell dimensions by Wyckoff s (27) atomic positions: Si: (u,, 0, 0) (-uo,1/31

for the coordinate system defined above) for quartz down to 94 K have been mea- sured by LePage et al. (16) and cell dimensions for 94 K (a, = 4.9079 A and co = 5.3991 A) have been interpolated from data reported by Danielsson et al. (17). Extrapolation to 35 K of the position parameters and cell dimensions suggests that our use of 94 K data will not appreciably hamper the interpretation of our results.
Quartz is piezoelectric, the positive end of an a-axis as defined above developing a negative charge during compression of the crystal along that axis (28).
An important feature of the alpha-quartz struc- ture is the structure of the SiO, groups, as shown in Fig. 1. These groups are only approximately tetrahedral, the local symmetry at the silicon being C,. The Si-0 bonds thus are of two types, differing in bond length. The equilibrium distances are
1.6145A (e.g., Si(0)-O(3)) and 1.6101 A (e.g.,
Si(0)-O(2)) at 94 K, giving rise to the terms "long-bonded" and "short-bonded" oxygens, re- spectively, when considering the environment of a specific silicon. Of course, each oxygen is bonded to two silicons and has one long and one short bond.
The EPR results herein are expressed for right- quartz, in a right-handed Cartesian coordinate system defined by x and z, where x is taken to be parallel to a two-fold axis with the same sense (as determined by piezoelectric response) and z is Can.

Use will be made of polar angles 8 and 4 defined in this system. The two possible coordinate systems resulting from the arbitrary choice of z-axis sense are related by C2 about x. Without loss of generality, the correlation x E a , ,z - c will be used.
The proper point group of alpha-quartz, which governs the symmetry-related magnetic proper- ties, is D,. At general orientations of an externally generated magnetic field B there occur six sym- metry-related EPR spectra for a species not exhib- iting symmetry about a two-fold crystallographic axis. These spectra collapse to three when B is perpendicular to one of the two-fold axes a of D,and to one when B is parallel to c. The set of 3 x 3 matrices P in the spin-Hamiltonian (see Sect. IV and Table 1) is one (i = - 1) - of six symmetry-related sets of matrices Ri.
Y.Ri-I. Here Ri are the
six rotation matrices describing the symmetry operations of D, expressed in the experimental coordinate system; R, is the 3 x 3 identity matrix. 1 1 1 .
Experimental The primary quartz samples employed have the form of a rectangular block (typically 1 x 1 x
0.2cm), two of whose faces are respectively nor-
mal to c and one a-axis, as determined by X-ray crystallography. Certain other samples were cylin- drical in shape with the cylinder axis parallel to one a-axis. Our assignment of handedness has been based on experiments using the optical rotation of plane polarized white light by the sample, as described by several authors (29-3 1). In each description, the convention is used that clockwise rotations are defined by an observer who is looking through the analyzer toward the light source. Each also adopts the nomenclature that right-quartz is dextrorotatory. Using these conventions, the fol- lowing observations indicate a right-quartz sample:(1) clockwise rotation of the analyzer from its position for extinction of yellow (winy violet appearance) initially gives reddish colors;(2) clockwise rotation of the analyzer causes the color sequence: night blue, winy violet,reddish orange. orange;(3) clockwise rotation of the analyzer causes observed interference rings to move out- ward ;(4) a polarimeter indicates dextrorotatory be- havior.
The validity of our assignments was confirmed by determining the handedness of a specimen whose structure had been measured using X-ray crystal- lography (kindly provided by Dr. Y. LePage). To determine the sense of a for the samples used herein, the sign of the voltage developed on squeez- ing the crystal along that axis was measured. Our assignment was confirmed for one sample by Dr.
LePage.
Paramagnetic species are created in quartz by exposure to ionizing radiation and can be thermally bleached. Before a typical experiment, the sample was heated to 650-750 K, over a period of 1-2 h, to restore defects to their diamagnetic state, removing the effects of previous experiments, of X-rays used in orienting, etc. On several occasions, subsequent absence of EPR signals was confirmed.
The crystal was X-irradiated, generally for 1 h,using a Picker X-ray unit equipped with a Machlett AEG-50s tungsten target tube (1.0 mm Be window) operating at 50mA and 50kV. The dosage is estimated as ca. 1 Jlmin (39 kradlmin) for a cube sample with 1 cm edges. The sample was turned to provide half of the irradiation to each side.
The crystal was mounted on the cold end of a Displex CS-202 cryogenic refrigerator used in con- junction with an EPR cavity designed and custom- built (32) to operate in the TE,,, mode at X-band frequencies. The magnetic component B, of the microwave excitation is parallel to the axis of the cylindrical cavity. The crystal temperature could be maintained at ca. 35 K. Accurate temperature measurements were not crucial for the work pre- sented herein since no strong dependence on temperature of the unsaturated EPR line widths and transition fields was observed in this region.

1699 V4500- 10 instrument with a Fieldial regulator Mark 11, using lOOkHz field modulation. A Hewlett Packard 5245L frequency counter was used with an HP 5257A transfer oscillator and a NUMAR M-2 precision NMR Gaussmeter to measure the micro- wave frequency and the magnetic field at the positions of each of several calibration markers on each spectrum.
Microwave power levels used were low enough to avoid saturation of the signals. Very narrow lines are observed, providing the opportunity for precise crystal alignment (discussed later) and transition field measurement. Most of the peak positions used as data for obtaining spin-Hamiltonians were as accurately determined as the field marker positions on the spectra. The marker and peak positions were digitized using a SAC GrafIPen model GP2- BCD sonic digitizer (Megatronix Ltd., Weston, Ont.). Linear regressions of the field values and digitized positions of the markers, done for each spectrum, demonstrated the positions of the markers to be linear in field and measured it to ca.
0.005 mT during 2.5 mTl5 min scans. Microwave
frequencies were measured to 0.01 MHz. Since changes in frequency were slow, but not neces- sarily linear, the frequency corresponding to an observed peak was obtained by interpolation between only the two calibration markers closest to it. Due to these frequency variations, fields measured at different times during an experi- ment are not directly comparable, but compari- son of "effective g-values" hvl(PJ3) indi- cates reproducibility to within ca. 0.005 mT when the crystal orientation had not been disturbed.
The natural constants used in magnetic field and g calculations were either from Cohen (33) or from Taylor et al. (34), which can be considered equiva- lent for our purposes.
The magnetic field at the position of the NMR Gaussmeter probe was not, in general, equal to that at the sample position. A correction of about 0.037 f
0.015 mT was required. The uncertainty in this
value represents the largest error in our experi- ments. However, within the approximation of a constant correction over the field range studied, it will affect only the magnitudes of the g-values. It has been shown by fitting the spin-Hamiltonian for [AIO4l0 to two sets of data (see Sect. 1V.A for fitting method) differing in each field position by 0.037 mT that there is no significant effect on the g principal directions or on the other spin-Hamiltonian param- eter matrices.The EPR cavity system used provides for rota- tion of the crystal about an axis parallel to the cavity cylinder axis. The cavity axis is adjusted to be perpendicular to the magnetic field (B) direction using equivalence of the EPR spectra for 180" rotation about an axis perpendicular to the field. In quartz, the spectra due to different symmetry- related sites provide sufficient information to de- termine the spin-Hamiltonian from rotation about a , ,  i.e., using the single plane B I a, (35). The crystal axis a, was accurately adjustable to be parallel to the cavity cylinder axis, since coinci- dence of some of the spectra from these symmetry- related sites provides an accurate means of ensur- ing that this condition holds. With a general orien- tation of B, if there are six symmetry-related spectra for a species, these will collapse to three spectra when B I a , .
The sample holder used (32) has a ball and socket joint which allows adjustment of the vertical crystal axis, relative to the cavity axis, from outside the cavity system, while observ- ing EPR at low temperature.
Rotation angles, measured with a mechanical goniometer dial readable to 0.05", correspond to counterclockwise rotation of the crystal, as deter- mined while looking down on the cavity. For a right-quartz sample, if the end developing a nega- tive charge on compression is facing the top of the cavity, the rotation angle corresponds to 8. with 4 = 90.0", in the coordinate system used herein.
Spectra were recorded at about 10" intervals.
IV. Results and Analysis
A. Experitnental Observations  l n d
Data The EPR spectrum of [A104]0 has been observed in every sample studied in our laboratory at low temperature (ca. 35 K, herein) after X-irradiation at room temperature, or at 77K with subsequent warming to room temperature before observation.
The center is stable for years at room temperature.
In most samples studied, irradiation at 77 K and observation at low temperature without allowing the crystal to warm up significantly yielded a spectrum with signals due to one or more of the "compensated" aluminum hole centers,
[AI041M+]+,
where M+ is a cation such as H+, Li+,or Na+. (.These centers yield [A104]0 on warm-up to room temperature.) There were some exceptions however. In one H-diffused plate of germanium- doped synthetic quartz (J. A. Weil, 1971, Argonne National Laboratory, Argonne, IL) some [AIO4l0 was detected in addition to the predominant
[AI04/H+]+
and in another synthetic sample (cour- tesy of A. Regreny, Centre National d'Etudes des Telecommunications, Lannion, France) an intense [A104]0 signal was present, but none due to [AI041M+]+. In a third sample (Clevite Corp., Cleveland, OH), [AlO4I0 was the predominant Can. J. Phys. Downloaded from www.nrcresearchpress.com by DUKE UNIV BOX 90187 on 05/05/12 For personal use only. 1700

species with a small amount of [A104/Li+]+ also present. It is unlikely that the crystals warmed up sufficiently during these experiments that the com- pensating ion could have diffused away forming [A104]0, since other species which decay in the same temperature range as [A104/M+]+ (e.g., the double hole species [A104]+ (20)) were simultan- eously observed. Other workers (36-38) have also observed that the "compensated" centers do not form during low temperature irradiation of some types of a-quartz.
An experimental spectrum of [A104]0,taken with the magnetic field parallel to the c-axis, is included in Fig. 2. The observed peak-to-peak linewidth of each first derivative line is 0.017 mT at ca. 35 K.
The linewidth was found to be independent of transition and orientation. Some weak lines, most easily noticeable outside the main multiplet, were found to be 2% as intense as the main lines, in agreement with Schnadt and Schneider's (10) as- signment of these lines as arising from hyperfine interaction with ?'Si nuclei neighboring the hole- bearing oxygens.At ca. 35 K, the EPR spectra of the excited state

a, to measure the positions of the main lines and ?'Si hyperfine lines. These spectra agree with those measured for [AIO4l0 in many other synthetic and natural quartz crystals. No splittings or distor- tions due to crystal misalignment were observable;calculations using the spin-Hamiltonian indicate that deviations of about 0.05" from the plane B 1 a,would have caused detectable splittings. For most spectra, a 2.5 mT sweep was recorded in 5 min.
The I7O hyperfine multiplets were recorded in a separate experiment. These hyperfine lines were found to be only 0.007% as intense as the main lines (0.0062% expected for I7O in natural abundance).
The crystal (Sawyer, synthetic) was rotated with
B I
a,, recording I7O hyperfine lines by using
5.0 mT sweeps in 25 minutes. At each orientation,
only some of the expected six hyperfine multiplets for each of the three symmetry-related spectra were observable because any interference from signals of other species (or the main lines of [A104]0) made the very weak signals undetecta- ble. Two such multiplets observed with B 1 1  c are shown in Fig. 1 of ref. 39.

The index i denotes any ofthe six symmetry-related sites and is dropped herein for i = 1. The first term represents the electronic Zeeman interaction. The terms in the summation represent the hyperfine, nuclear Zee- man, and nuclear quadrupole interactions with nucleus j ,  where j includes the 27AI nucleus and possibly the lYSi and/or the I7O nuclei depending upon the transitions being considered.The electron spin quantum number S equals 112.The matrices g, A,,, and QA1 were fitted to the field positions and microwave frequencies of the pri- mary spectrum corresponding to Isi = 0 and I ,  = 0 using a computer program (40) which employs exact diagonalization of the spin-Hamiltonian op- erator matrix.

assumed to be coaxial, as had been done in previous studies. Allowing anisotropy in the nu- clear Zeeman matrix was found not to give any significant improvement in fit, so that g,, was taken as equal to 1.455411 (41). Here is the 3 x 3 unit matrix. For the final computer runs, 469 EPR lines were used. These were distributed over the orien- tations and sites and each was due to a single,nonoverlapped transition. The results in Table I ,which are for site i = 1 as defined below, produce fits to these data with a root-mean-square deviation of 0.003 mT in the line positions.
An error analysis of the parameter matrices Y attained by the fitting procedure has been carried out in each case, by using the N x N variance1 covariance matrix estimated during the least- squares adjustment. Here N is the total number of independent matrix elements varied. The esti- mated root-mean-square errors for each Y were calculated using the procedure given by Nelson (42), and are included in Table 1.
The matrix A,,, included in Table 1, was calcu- lated by the same computer program, fitting 146 transitions of [AIO4l0 centers in which the silicon neighboring the oxygen on which the hole is trapped is 29Si. The root-mean-square deviation found was 0.0035 mT. In this fitting, the matrices g , A*!, and Q,,were used unchanged from the primary (28,30Si) fit, and gsi was set equal to -
1.109540 (41).
As a confirmation that the correct spin-Hamil- tonian parameter matrices had been obtained,another computer program employing exact matrix diagonalization was used to calculate transition fields and relative transition probabilities (assumed proportional to I(m lSzln ) l 2  when excitation field B, 1 1  a,). When plotted with incorporation of a Lorentzian lineshape, these values yielded simu- lated spectra in excellent agreement with experi- ment. The simulated c-axis spectrum is included in Fig. 2. For this case, separate spectra were calcu- lated for [A104]0 with and without 29Si.
These two spectra were weighted to account for the natural abundance of 29Si,added, and plotted to give the final simulation.
The importance of the small aluminum nuclear Zeeman and quadrupole interactions is made evident in Fig. 3, which shows spectra calculated with the corresponding parameter matrices set to zero.
Fitting of the matrix A, to the I7O hyperfine line positions was carried out as described above for the other spin-Hamiltonian parameter matrices. Qo is expected to be very small due to the small quad- rupole moment of "0, and was assumed to be zero.

The signs which remain to be considered are those for A,,, Q,,, A,,, and A,. Spectra were calculated using each of the sixteen possible sign combinations of principal values of A,, and Q,,consistent with Q,, being traceless. Only the sign combination in Table 1 and the one related to it by changing the signs of all six principal values are consistent with the experimental data.
In order to compare the dipolar contributions, to be calculated, to the observed anisotropic compo- nents of the aluminum and silicon hyperfine mat- rices, the signs of these matrices3 must be considered. If, as expected, the dipole-dipole interaction is a major portion of the anisotropic component, then the signs must be as given in Table 1. Schirmer and co-workers (43-45) have stated that, due to core polarization, the parameter a = (Tr A)/(3ge(3,) is negative for nuclei with positive gj in several cases (including [A104]0 in quartz) in which holes trapped in an oxygen p - orbital interact with a second nucleus located in the nodal plane of the orbital. These signs have the 'We attach a sign to a matrix, in the sense that we may multiply all of its elements by - 1 to change its sign. parameter a negative and b = [(A3/gePe) - u]/2 positive for aluminum. This choice proves to be consistent with the sign of the aluminum hyperfine matrix for the double-hole center [AlO,]+ (22),which must have negative principal values in order for the electronic quadrupole matrix to agree with electron dipole-dipole theory.The ratios of the principal values of Asi are assumed to be positive, by analogy with A,,,because similar interactions are expected between the unpaired electron on oxygen and these two neighboring nuclei. The signs of the principal values will be o   o s i t e for the two matrices since . .A, is proportional to gj.Since the observed anisotropy of the ''0 hyper- fine splitting is fairly well explained by the model of an unpaired electron in an oxygen p-orbital, it is assumed that this model is basically correct. Thus,the signs for the principal values ofA, predicted by this model have been chosen. Essentially the same fit of the experimental data is obtained when any of the eight possible combinations of sign choices for these principal values is used.
C. Cotnparison with Previously Available Spin-
Hatniltonian Parameters As discussed earlier, several EPR studies of
[A104]0
have already been reported. Table 2 com- pares the principal values given in the literature to those from this work. The present work, besides determining 2, and Asi for the first time, finds that A,, and uAl are not uniaxial. It is possible that the signs of the principal values of A,, and Q,,have been misprinted in the paper by Zil'bershtein et al. (46), since they state that they are in agreement with Griffiths et ul. (4).Principal directions published in several early reports (4, 8, 46, 47) are less accurate than more recent values and will not be considered herein since insufficient coordinate system information was included. Directions published by Mackey el al. (18) correlate with the quartz lattice in the same way as those reported herein. However, this may be fortuitous. Their Fig. 1 asserts that they used the structural hand of quartz, rather than the conven- tional hand (see ref. 30). This in itself would cause no difficulty except that they assign the handedness of their sample of crystal Sawyer X-21 as right (laevorotatory, using this different nomenclature),whereas we have found a piece of the same crystal to be right-quartz (dextrorotatory). It appears that they also misassigned the sense of theirx-axis, with the result that their reported experimental direc- tions correspond correctly to their Fig. 1.

He found A,, and QA,to be coaxial and uniaxial and found their "unique" principal direction experimentally by reducing the relative intensity of the "quasi-forbidden" transi- tions. His results, transformed into the coordinate system used herein, are listed in Table 4. Although his matrices appear close to ours, the improvement contained in our results is clearly seen in spectral simulations using the respective sets of matrices.
V. Discussion
It will herein be considered as proved that the EPR signals studied arise from a center in which an aluminum ion has substituted for a silicon cation in the lattice, and in which an electron hole has been trapped, primarily located at a neighboring oxygen anion. There is abundant evidence in the literature (see Sect. I) for this interpretation, corroborated by our findings. Recent molecular orbital calculations (48) demonstrate that there is an increase in the nonbonded electron density (but the total charge density remains essentially constant) on the neigh- boring bridging oxygen ions when aluminum is substituted for silicon, predicting that electron- hole trapping at the lone pair orbitals is enhanced.
We turn to the question of the relationship of the principal magnetic directions as measured by EPR to the structural directions found by X-ray diffrac- tion in cr-quartz. Because of the lack of symmetry elements (e.g., not even C 2 occurs), no principal axes need necessarily agree with atom-atom direc- tions or other st]-uctural features. In addition,distortions at the defect centers could cause devia- tions from directions defined by the atom positions in the perfect structure. However, we do find that various principal directions can be correlated with structural features. For the matrix set in Table I ,this correlation, quantified in Table 5, is attained if we assume the hole to be localized at one oxygen site, labelled O(3) in our scheme (Fig. 1 ,  with A 1
substituted at Si(0)). Other conceivable site as- signments do not allow such correlations. Hole jumping, between equivalent oxygen anions O(3) and 0(4),proceeds at a rate slower than gp,B/h - 1Ol0 s-I.
We consider the I7O data first, since these represent the most fundamental information about the ground state. For almost uniaxial matrices,such as A,, the accuracy in determining the "per- pendicular'' principal directions deteriorates as the corresponding two principal values approach each other. In the case of A,, all three principal values appear to be significant (Table I). Note also that A,is found to be almost coaxial with g ,  with the respective "unique" principal values correspond- ing to different directions for the two. The "non- unique" principal directions of g have been dis- cussed by Schnadt and Schneider (10).
We assume that the unique axis (Ao),gives a good estimate of the direction of the oxygen p-orbital component of the unpaired electron wave- function $. The axis is seen (Table 5) to be close (ca. 5") to being perpendicular to the plane Si(0)-O(3)-Si(3),consistent with the earlier models, as already discussed.

The remaining small amount of spin density could be located on the other oxygen neighbors of the adjacent aluminum and silicon ions. No small ''0 hyperfine splittings from such a situation were observed; interference from the various EPR lines in the central spectrum could easily have prevented detection of such lines, if present. Another possi- bility is that some delocalization to an oxygen across a c-axis channel (3.6A distance) occurs, as was suggested for a trapped-hole species in NaA1Si30, (56).In summary. the coefficients in Table 6 must be considered as giving only an approximate descrip- tion of the oxygen component of the unpaired electron wavefunction. The g-matrix for [AI0,l0 has already been explained (lo),quite successfully,in terms of an unpaired electron in an oxygen p-orbital in the crystal field of the neighboring aluminum and silicon ions.Having concluded from the oxygen hyperfine structure that the hole wavefunction primarily consists of an oxygen p-orbital with orientation close to the perpendicular to the AI-0-Si plane,this model can then be used to attempt interpreta- tion of the aluminum and silicon hyperfine mat- rices, since the respective magnetic dipole-dipole interactions between the hole and 27Al and 29Si are expected to contribute significantly.The previous analyses of the unpaired electron wavefunction depended on indirect arguments to establish that the electron is primarily in a p - orbital of oxygen, and did not include any oxygen s-orbital component. To explain the aluminum hyperfine matrix, two basically different ap- proaches were taken. Schirmer (I 1) assumed that the unpaired electron is in an oxygen 2p orbital perpendicular to the AI-0-Si plane, with no admixture of any other orbital. He used an electron-dipole nuclear-dipole approach, including an approximation for the spatial extent of the p-orbital, to calculate the AI-0 distance necessary to give the observed anisotropic aluminum hyper- fine splittings and suggested that the oxygen re- laxes to this distance. An extension of the A1-0 distance from 1.614 to at least 2.3A (depending upon the assumed expectation value of the square of the electron-nucleus distance for the p-orbital) was found to be necessary. The dipole-dipole interaction of the unpaired electron with the 29Si nucleus is exactly analogous to that for 27AI.An extension of the Si-0 distance to at least 2.5A would be required to explain the uniaxial compo- nent of Asi observed herein. On the other hand, Barker (15) assumed that no distortion occurs even when the hole is trapped. Using a point-dipolar model, he included admixtures of IAl, 3s) and IAl,3p) orbitals to the 10,2p) orbital in an attempt to derive the portion of the aluminum hyperfine interaction not explained by oxygen spin density alone. (He also showed that small distortions of the aluminum position were not inconsistent with his conclusions.) An interpretation involving both distortion and admixture of other orbitals can now be attempted,making use of the additional spin-Hamiltonian parameter matrices now available.One approach to determining the oxygen posi- tion is to consider the principal directions of the aluminum and silicon hyperfine matrices. The unique principal direction of each of these matrices is seen to be close to that of the corresponding bond to normal oxygen in quartz (Table 5). Two lines,parallel to the appropriate principal directions, can be defined, one through each cation. Although these lines do not quite intersect, the midpoint of the shortest line (0.079A) between them is only
0.27A from the usual oxygen position. The rela-
tively small magnitude of this distance shows that. in a dipole-dipole approach to the aluminum and silicon hyperfine interactions, the principal direc- tions are consistent with a reasonable oxygen posi- tion. However, for reasonable spin densities on oxygen, the A1-0 and Si-0 distances must be extended to lengths unreasonable and inconsistent with the above i i order to explain the magnitudes of the anisotropic hyperfine components. Since the point electron dipole model as well as the extended dipole approach (see below) lead to these inconsis- tent conclusions, the above "intersection" cannot be regarded as a reliable measure of the oxygen position. The other two principal directions, not yet discussed, for the aluminum hyperfine matrix also contradict the simple dipole-dipole model,since one of the   air should be arallel to the nominal p-orbital direction, a condition not ob- served (see Table 5). Note that the agreement ofthe ASi principal axes with the expected directions is far better than those of A,,.
Although the distortions required by the above dipole-dipole model are too large, some elongation of the AI-0 bond relative to Si-0 seems likelv. A survey of a variety of oxides containing aluminum and silicon shows that Si-0 bonds are consistently about 1.60 +
0.01 A whereas AI-0 bonds are about
1.78 + 0.01 A (57). If one scales the quartz Si-0
bond lengths by the ratio of these two distances,one obtains 1.796 and 1.791 A as estimates of the Al-0 long and short bonds in quartz, respectively.

Such translation of the four oxygen anions along their respective AI-0 distances was considered. A calculation based on the resulting atomic positions is included (Table 7) as an estimate of the effects of distortion.
In an attempt to estimate the magnetic dipole- dipole contributions to AAl and As,, a computer program ADMAT was written, which approxi- mates the electron orbital as a grid of points (typically ca. 2000) with associated probabilities determined from screened hydrogenic wavefunc- tions (58). The form of the wavefunction used is \

2s) and 10,2p), respectively,were obtained from the program ACRF (49-51).
ADMAT sums the weighted interactions of the point dipoles of the grid with the external point nuclear moment for ?'AI. The form ofthe hyperfine matrix used in the calculation is well known (59). In our calculations, g was taken as the free electron value. The hyperfine matrices calculated using c, = 0 and c, = 1 are consistent with calculations using Schirmer's approach (1 1). The effects of adding to the p-orbital an s contribution with positive or negative coefficient c,, of specifying various p- orbital positions and axes, and of using different positions of nuclei were studied. Table 7 includes typical hyperfine matrices calculated for 27Al and 29Si.Their unique principal directions agree well with the observed ones, but their principal values are considerably larger (ca. x 3) in magnitude, as already discussed. The effects of choosing the p-orbital direction along the perpendicular to the AI-0-Si plane as compared to the unique principal axis ofA,, of choosing oxygen charges between 0.5 and - 1 .O. and of including c, with either sign were all found to be small. In Table 7b, and A1-0 elongation to 1.796A was assumed, and is seen to give better agreement with regard to principal values. When the calculated dipolar contributions to A,, and Asi are subtracted from the experimen- tally observed anisotropic components of these matrices, the residual matrices are found to be fairly close to uniaxial, and have the wrong signs to be due to electron spin density in unpolarized aluminum or silicon p-orbitals, respectively. In addition to core polarization effects, it is likely that there are several contributions to these residual matrices, including cation p-orbitals as suggested above, unpaired electron density in orbitals of atoms other than the three considered so far, and of course inaccuracy in the calculated oxygen p- orbital dipolar contributions.The principal directions of QAl agree very closely with several features of the local environment of aluminum as is evident from Table 5. The "unique" axis (L)& deviates even less from the direction Si(0)-O(3) than the corresponding hyper- fine principal direction does. In addition, the "non- unique" directions agree almost perfectly with directions defined by the other oxygens bonded to aluminum; (L)AI)I is along the direction between the oxygens with short bonds to the aluminum ion.
Since contributions to the electric field gradient from the bulk of the crystal do not have this Can. J. Phys. Downloaded from www.nrcresearchpress.com by DUKE UNIV BOX 90187 on 05/05/12 For personal use only.

1707 symmetry, the principal directions confirm that the local environment of aluminum is the main source of the electric field gradient. Consistent with this conclusion, Thong and Schwarzenbach (60) found that in AIPO,, which has a structure isotypic with that of quartz, the contribution of the central atom aluminum electron density alone is about 60% of the total field gradient. Further, the agreement between the observed quadrupole directions and the undistorted quartz structure shows that the small difference determined herein between the "nonunique" principal values of QAl is meaningful and implies that any static distortions must either be small or must maintain the O(2)-O(1) direction (e.g., elongation of all four AI-0 bonds can con- form to this constraint). O'Brien and Barker have discussed $ 0 ,in terms of the electric field gradient at the aluminum nucleus along the Al(0)-O(3) direction. Assuming tetrahedral sp' hybrid orbitals about aluminum, both authors showed that the electric field gradient component estimated from
Q3
is consistent with slightly less electron density being contributed to the bonding by the oxygen with the trapped hole than by each of the other three oxygens. This model predicts that Q3 is positive and, via the experimentally determined relative QAl and ifAl signs, that the principal values of A,, must be negative. To give a similar discus- sion for the other principal values of QA, would require that the differences in the four bonds to aluminum be included in the hybrid orbital expres- sions. The quadrupole interaction is sensitive to small changes in the electron distribution near the nucleus and its seems unlikely that a crude model using perturbed sp' hybrid orbitals on aluminum would successfully account for the small observed nonuniaxiality. Thus, such calculations will not be attempted here.

First, you need to sequentially extract any quotes in the literature that are most relevant to each question, and print them in numbered order, separated by newlines. Quotes should be relatively brief. Do not attempt to summarize or answer questions at this stage, but simply repeat exactly what the corresponding part of the literature says.

Please enclose the full list of quotes in <quotes></quotes> XML tags. If there are no relevant quotes, write "No relevant quotes" instead.

Then, answer the question, starting with "Answer:".  Do not include or reference quoted content verbatim in the answer. Don't say "According to Quote [1]" when answering. Do not write reference number of quotes after answer. Put your answer to the user inside <EnglishVersionAnswer></EnglishVersionAnswer> XML tags. Output formatted text, with line breaks for each question.Separate quotes and answers with a blank line. Provide the answers to all questions in English. After completing the English answers, translate all those answers into Chinese and provide the Chinese version inside <ChineseVersionAnswer></ChineseVersionAnswer> XML tags.

Thus, the format of your overall response should look like what's shown between the <example></example> tags.  Make sure to follow the formatting and spacing exactly.
