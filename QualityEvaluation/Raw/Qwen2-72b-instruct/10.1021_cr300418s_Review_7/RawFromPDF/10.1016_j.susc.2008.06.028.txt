We study the effect of gold doping on oxygen vacancy formation and CO adsorption on the (110) and
(100) surfaces of ceria by using density functional theory, corrected for on-site Coulomb interactions
(DFT + U). The Au dopant substitutes a Ce atom in the surface layer, leading to strong structural distor-
tions. The formation of one oxygen vacancy near a dopant atom is energetically ‘‘downhill” while the for-
mation of a second vacancy around the same dopant requires energy. When the surface is in equilibrium
with gaseous oxygen at 1 atm and room temperature there is a 0.4 probability that no oxygen atom left
the neighborhood of a dopant. This means that the sites where the dopant has not lost oxygen are very
active in oxidation reactions. Above 400 K almost all dopants have an oxygen vacancy next to them and
an oxidation reaction in such a system takes place by creating a second vacancy. The energy required to
form a second vacancy is smaller on (110) than on (100). On the (110) surface, it is much easier to form a
second vacancy on the doped surface than the ﬁrst vacancy on the undoped surface. The energy required
to form a second oxygen vacancy on (100) is comparable to that of forming the ﬁrst vacancy on the
undoped surface. Thus doping makes the (110) surface a better oxidant but it has a small effect on
the oxidative power of the (100) surface. On the (110) surface CO adsorption results in formation of a
carbonate-like structure, similar to the undoped surface, while on the (100) surface direct formation
of CO2 is observed, in contrast to the undoped surface. The Au dopant weakens the bond of the surround-
ing oxygen atoms to the oxide making it a better oxidant, facilitating CO oxidation.

1. Introduction
Cerium oxide is used in oxidation and dehydrogenation cataly-
sis [1,2]. In most cases the molecule to be oxidized takes oxygen
from the surface creating oxygen vacancies on it. The oxygen mol-
ecule from the gas phase annihilates the vacancies closing thus the
catalytic cycle. Ceria surfaces have a relatively small oxygen va-
cancy formation energy, which arises from the ability of ceria to
change oxidation state from (formally) +4 to (formally) +3.
Doping of ceria with other metallic elements, such as Zr, has
been shown to enhance thermal stability [3,4] and to promote cat-
alytic activity [1–11]. It is believed that doping facilitates the
reduction of ceria [4–12] by weakening Ce–O bonds around the
dopant. A number of computational studies have demonstrated
that the oxygen vacancy formation energy is lower when the sur-
face is doped with Zr [3,4,11].
Recent calculations [12] have shown that replacing a Ce atom
on the CeO2(111) surface enhances CO oxidation. The Ce–O and
dopant–O bonds are weakened upon formation of the doped mate-
rial, reducing the oxygen vacancy formation energy and enhancing
the reactivity of the surface.
In this paper, we use density functional theory corrected for on-
site Coulomb interactions (DFT + U) to study the effect of doping
the (110) and (100) surfaces with Au on oxygen vacancy forma-
tion and on CO adsorption. Comparison is made with previous
studies of CO adsorption on the undoped surfaces [13–15]. We
are interested in the (110) and (100) surfaces, because they are
exposed on nanorods [16,17] and nanoparticles [15–17] and show
enhanced activity compared to the (111) surface [13–17] and
computational work from Liu et al. shows that gold on the (111)
surface enhances CO oxidation [18].
2. Methods
We use a slab to describe ceria surface and a plane wave basis
set to describe the wave functions of the valence electrons [19].
The projector augmented wave (PAW) approach of Blöchl [20] de-
scribes the interaction between the core and the valence electrons.
The Ce core is [Xe], [He] on O and C and [Xe] on Au and for Ce, we
use the PAW potential with 12 valence electrons, treating the 4f
electrons are valence. The plane wave cut-off energy is 396 eV;
compared to a 500 eV cut-off, there is little change in properties

such as vacancy formation energies and in refs. [21,22] conver-
gence tests for the technical parameters discussed below were per-
formed.
The
Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof
(PBE)
functional
[23]
accounts for exchange and correlation. In common with earlier
studies [13,14,21,22,24–26], we use density functional theory
(DFT) corrected for on-site Coulomb interactions (DFT + U), where
U = 5 eV and is applied to the Ce 4f states. The details of this ap-
proach and the choice of U are discussed extensively in [21,22].
Brieﬂy, due to the fact that the self interaction of an electron is
not correctly cancelled in DFT, there is an artiﬁcial barrier to elec-
tronic localisation, since the self interaction is biased towards delo-
calising electronic states. The introduction of the on-site Coulomb
interaction, U, helps to remove some of the self-interaction error,
reducing the artiﬁcial barrier to localisation, forming localised elec-
tronic states, in agreement with experiment and contrary to the
GGA result. The actual value of U is usually chosen to recover the
correct value of an experimentally measured parameter, e.g. the
magnetic moment or the band gap. For the present system, this
is difﬁcult, since we are dealing with a defect state. In the present
work, we choose a value of U that leads to localisation of two elec-
trons in the Ce 4f states for each oxygen vacancy and an electronic
structure corresponding to that observed in experimental UPS
spectra [21,22]. While we have taken an empirical route to deter-
mine U, there has been recent work, attempting to compute U from
ﬁrst principles [27,28]. While this can remove the empiricism in
DFT + U computations, U is still generally ﬁtted to reproduce the
property of interest [21,22,27,28]. k-Point sampling is performed
using the Monkhorst–Pack scheme, with a (2  2  1) grid and
Fermi level smearing is performed using the Methfessel–Paxton
scheme [29].
The (110) surface is a type II surface with neutral stoichiome-
tric planes so that no dipole moment is present upon cleaving.
The (100) surface is a type III surface [22,30] with a non-zero di-
pole moment. For the (110) and (100) surface calculations a thick-
ness of 11.5 Å (seven atomic layers) and 10.94 Å (nine layers) was
required. Moving half of the oxygen atoms from one face of the
slab to the other removes the dipole [22,31]. The vacuum layer is
15 Å on both surfaces. The vacancy is formed by removing one oxy-
gen atom from the surface. In common with the vast majority of
publications on the topic of oxygen vacancies in ceria, we study
neutral oxygen vacancies. This allows for comparison with these
previous studies. Oxygen vacancy defects can result in F-centres
(trapped electrons at the site of the oxygen vacancy) or reduced
metal cations. In ceria, there is no evidence of F-centres are and in-
stead, the metal cation is reduced. While there have been recent
studies which have examined different charge states of oxygen
vacancies in ceria [32], in catalysis, the oxide is not in contact with
an electron reservoir (which enables charge transfer to the oxide)
and the question of the charge state of the vacancy does not arise.
On both surfaces, we use a surface supercell with eight surface
oxygen atoms so that formation of one oxygen vacancy gives a va-
cancy concentration of 12.5% at the surface and an overall vacancy
concentration of between 1.6% and 3.3%, depending on surface and
number of vacancies (see Section 3). These supercells are signiﬁ-
cantly larger than in previous calculations on ceria surfaces
[21,22,25] reducing defect–defect interactions and allowing better
treatment of an adsorbed molecule. Upon introduction of the dop-
ant and the vacancy, we relax all layers except the bottom two. For
the ionic relaxation in a ﬁxed lattice, the forces are relaxed until
they are less than 0.02 eV/Å.
CO was adsorbed at these surfaces in a number of conﬁgura-
tions to probe the dependence of adsorption energy on the adsorp-
tion site. To investigate further the nature of adsorbed species, we
use a mass weighted diagonalization of the second derivative ma-
trix in a ﬁxed lattice to compute the vibrational frequencies of ad-
sorbed CO, which we compare to the available experimental data.
3. Results
3.1. The structure of the stoichiometric, doped surfaces
We show the relaxed surfaces for the Au-doped (110) and
(100) surfaces in Fig. 1a and b; the dopant is the grey sphere
in the outermost layer in each surface (we did not consider dop-
ing in subsurface layers of the surfaces [12]). In the (110) surface,
neutral layers of CeO2 stoichiometry are present. The Ce atoms in
the surface layer are coordinated to two pairs of surface oxygen
atoms and a pair of subsurface oxygen atoms. Each subsurface
oxygen atom is coordinated with a subsurface Ce atom. Upon
doping, the Au atom moves outward from its initial lattice site
(Fig. 1a), the oxygen atoms in the ﬁrst subsurface layer move to-
wards the bulk, away from the dopant, resulting in dopant-to-
oxygen distances of 2.81 Å, compared to Ce–O distances of
2.21 Å in the undoped surface. The oxygen atoms neighboring
the dopant in the surface layer move outwards, resulting in elon-
gated Ce–O distances between Ce in the ﬁrst subsurface layer and
oxygen in the surface layer; these are 2.46 Å, compared to 2.33 Å
for the undoped surface. The oxygen atoms in the subsurface
layer that are nearest to the dopant are pulled towards the dop-
ant, resulting in Au–O distances of 2.09 Å, compared to a Ce–O
distance of 2.32 Å in the undoped surface. This displacement of
oxygen atoms elongates one pair of Ce–O distances involving
the surface Ce atom neighboring the dopant to 2.74 Å and short-
ens the other pair to 2.26 Å.
The undoped (100) surface shows a zigzag structure of –Ce–
O–Ce–O–, with 2-coordinated oxygen atoms in the surface layer.
These Ce–O distances are 2.19 Å and the distance to subsurface
oxygen from Ce is 2.50 Å. Upon doping with Au, we ﬁnd some
distortions to the atomic structure around the dopant site. Sim-
ilar to the (110) surface, the dopant moves outwards and pulls
an oxygen atom from the next sublayer with it. This dopant dis-
placement is more pronounced on (110) than on (100). The dis-
tance from the dopant to the surface oxygen atoms is 1.94 Å,
substantially shorter than the Ce–O distance in the undoped sur-
face (which is 2.19 Å). Looking down on the surface, we see that
the subsurface oxygen atoms are repelled away from the dopant.
These oxygen atoms have a shortened distance to surface Ce of
2.33 Å. The oxygen atoms in the surface layer nearest the dopant
are pulled towards the dopant, so that distances to the nearest
Ce ions are elongated to 2.24 Å. Such displacement indicates a
weakening of the Ce–O bonds involving these oxygen atoms,
which should increase the reactivity of the doped surface. Upon
doping into both surfaces and upon vacancy formation, the Au
atom is oxidised, resulting in the formation of Aud+; Au charges
are +0.45 electrons and +0.1 electrons in the doped (110) and
(100) surfaces. The presence of this species is independent of
using DFT or DFT + U.
3.2. Oxygen vacancy formation in the doped surfaces
For both surfaces doped with Au, we consider formation of one
oxygen vacancy, both ‘‘near” the dopant (a distance of 2.08 Å (110)
and 1.96 Å (100) from the dopant) and ‘‘away” from the dopant (a
distance of 7.10 Å (110) and 7.00 Å (100) from the dopant). For
two oxygen vacancies, we consider a number of vacancy patterns,
(i) both vacancies near the dopant, (ii) one vacancy near the dopant
and one vacancy far away from the dopant or (iii) both vacancies
far away from the dopant. For this scenario, we discuss the most
stable patterns in Section 3.3.
The formation energy of the ﬁrst oxygen vacancy (giving a va-
cancy concentration in the slab model of 1.8% in (110) and 1.6%
in (100)) is given by

The subscript on the oxygen indicates the stoichiometry in the en-
tire surface slab upon removal of one or two oxygen atoms. If the
resulting energy is negative (exothermic) an oxygen vacancy is
thermodynamically stable, whereas a positive energy signiﬁes an
energy cost to form the vacancy.
We consider ﬁrst the formation of one oxygen vacancy from the
doped surface. In the (110) surface the vacancy site near the dop-
ant involves removing one of the surface oxygen atoms closest to
the dopant. In Fig. 2a and b we show the structure of the surface
after removing an oxygen atom next to the dopant. The structure
of the surface when we make an oxygen vacancy away from the
dopant is shown in Fig. 2c and d. In both cases the dopant remains
at its lattice site after the vacancy is formed. For the (100) surface,
we show the structure of the surface with a vacancy in Fig. 3a–d.
The vacancy formation energy for the ﬁrst oxygen vacancy on
the (110) surface is 0.08 eV, when the vacancy is near the dopant
and it is +0.15 eV when the vacancy is away from the dopant. In
both cases the formation energies are substantially smaller than
on the undoped surface (for which the energy of forming one va-
cancy is 2.07 eV [22]). For the (100) surface, the vacancy formation
energies are 0.82 eV and +0.28 eV for a vacancy near the dopant
and away from the dopant, respectively. Again, these energies are
substantially smaller than in the undoped surface (which is 2.22 eV
[21,22]).
The key ﬁnding is that upon doping of the (110) and (100) sur-
faces with Au, the oxygen vacancy formation energy is negative,
indicating that if the system is in equilibrium, oxygen vacancies
will be thermodynamically favourable. By lengthening of the Ce–
O distances around the dopant site, doping makes removal of a
neighboring oxygen atom rather facile. It is interesting to note that
the vacancy formation energy in the (111) surface calculated with
DFT is 0.36 eV for a vacancy neighboring the dopant and +0.56 eV
for a vacancy outside the ﬁrst coordination shell of the dopant.
Thus, assuming the energetics of vacancy formation are reasonably
described with DFT (we have computed a lowering of the forma-
tion energy by 0.41 eV with DFT + U on the undoped (100) surface,
compared to DFT [21]), then gold doping of ceria surfaces will
make oxygen vacancies thermodynamically favourable. Based on
these energies alone one would be inclined to think that it is the
formation of the second energy vacancy that controls the oxidation
activity of the oxide surface. However, a thermodynamic analysis
(the details of which are presented in the appendix) of the equilib-
rium concentration of the vacancies in the presence of oxygen in
the gas phase indicates that at room temperature and oxygen pres-
sure of 1 atm there are oxygen atoms near the dopant and these
will be very reactive. At higher temperatures all oxygen next to
the dopant is gone and the formation of the second vacancy will
control the oxidation activity of the doped oxide surface. This is a
model in which the dopants are isolated, and we do not consider
dopant clustering. While the latter can form in doped oxides, the
most active sites are at the interface between the dopant and oxy-
gen of the host. This interface is satisfactorily modeled by the setup
in this paper and previous studies [3,4,11,12,18]. In addition, if the
vacancies do not interact there will be one vacancy per dopant.
However, one expects that unless the concentration of vacancies
is very low there will be some interaction and the presence of
vacancies around some dopants will make it harder to make vacan-
cies around other dopants. We have not considered this interaction
here.
We now discuss brieﬂy the atomic structure of the defective
doped surfaces. In the (110) surface, when a vacancy forms near
the dopant, the other oxygen atom (of the pair of oxygen atoms
near the dopant) moves off its lattice site in order to bridge the
dopant and the nearest surface Ce atom, with a Ce–O distance of
2.20 Å (Fig. 2a). Au–O distances are 2.07 and 2.22 Å. When the va-
cancy is further away from the dopant (see Fig. 2b), an oxygen
atom is displaced out of the surface layer to bridge the two surface
Ce atoms, with Ce–O distances of 2.19 Å. At the dopant site, the
Au–O distances are 2.08 and 2.12 Å, with a small change compared
to the defect free doped surface. This oxygen atom also moves out
of the surface layer indicating that formation of another oxygen va-
cancy, involving this atom, could be rather facile. Other distortions
of the surface caused by vacancy formation are rather small.
On the (100) surface, with a vacancy near the dopant, the dop-
ant moves further into the surface, presumably to increase its coor-

dination. The surface oxygen atom coordinated to the dopant also
moves into the surface, with an Au–O distance of 2.01 Å. There are
no further distortions due to vacancy formation. When the vacancy
is away from the dopant, there is little change to the structure
around the dopant site. The Ce–O distances neighbouring the va-
cancy site are 2.05 and 2.11 Å, compared to 2.19 Å in the surface
with no vacancies. The Au–O distances are 2.02 and 2.03 Å, which
are a little longer than in the defect free undoped surface. There are
no further notable distortions to the structure in this case.
Finally, after vacancy formation, the charge state of the gold
dopant is hardly affected, indicating that the dopant is not involved
directly in the vacancy formation process. Finally, both DFT and
DFT + U give qualitatively similar descriptions of the vacancy for-
mation energetics in each surface, e.g. formation of the ﬁrst oxygen
vacancy gives an energy change of 0.56 eV and 0.82 eV in the
Au-doped (100) surface with DFT and DFT + U, respectively.
3.3. The formation of a second oxygen vacancy
Since at sufﬁciently high temperature and an oxygen pressure
of 1 atm almost all dopants have an oxygen vacancy next to them,
it is the formation of a second oxygen vacancy that determines the
oxidation activity of the doped surface. We use Eq. (2) to compute
the formation energy of a second oxygen vacancy, where the start-

side present a top view of the surface.

ing point is the defective, doped surface discussed in Section 3.2.
The locations of the two vacancies in the most stable vacancy dis-
tribution are shown in Fig. 4. In these structures, both oxygen
vacancies are near the dopant, with dopant-vacancy distances gi-
ven in Section 3.2. In Fig. 4a, the two vacancies lie on the same line
so that only one ‘‘V” is visible.
Beginning with a doped surface that has one oxygen vacancy
present, the formation energy of a second vacancy on the (110)
surface having already a vacancy near the dopant is +0.68 eV and
the structure is shown in Fig. 4a and b. It takes +2.65 eV to form
a second vacancy away from the dopant. On (100), the correspond-
ing energies are 2.57 eV for the two vacancies near the dopant (Fig.
4c and d and 2.26 eV where the second vacancy is away from the
dopant. Compared with the undoped surface, we see that forma-
tion of the second vacancy on (110) is rather easy, but only if
the both vacancies are near the dopant. On (100) the presence of
the dopant has little impact on the formation of the second oxygen
vacancy, irrespective of the position of the second vacancy site. The
range of oxygen vacancy formation energies on these surfaces is
quite broad, going from 0.08 eV (one vacancy on Au-doped
(110) surface) to 2.61 eV (two vacancies, one near, on away from
the dopant on Au-doped (110) surface) and we see that increasing
the vacancy concentration causes an increase in the formation en-
ergy of the vacancy. This suggests that for the (110) surface a va-
cancy concentration of 3.6% is possible, but that a similar
concentration for the (100) surface is not favourable. Further va-
cancy formation will be expected to have an even larger energy
cost. Taken with the results of Ref. [12], these energies suggest a
strong inﬂuence of the dopant on the catalytic activity of ceria sur-
faces, with a notable surface dependence present.
On (110), there are two surface oxygen atoms neighboring the
dopant, and the dopant–O distances are 2.02 Å, which are short-
ened over the vacancy structure detailed in Section 3.2. These sur-
face atoms have moved out of the surface plane, with Ce–O
distances of 2.05 and 2.08 Å. The reduced coordination of the Ce
atom results in a shortening of the Ce–O distances. This also indi-
cates that formation of a third oxygen vacancy near the dopant will
be less favorable. This means that there is a temperature window
in which the doped oxide provides an oxidation reaction with only
one oxygen atom per dopant.
On the (100) surface, the outermost oxygen atoms near the
dopant are displaced towards the dopant, with an accompanying
distortion of the outermost Ce atoms and third layer oxygen atoms.
Ce–O distances involving the outermost oxygen atoms are between
2.09 and 2.26 Å, with the shortest Ce–O distances for those oxygen
atoms nearest the dopant.
3.4. The equilibrium concentration of various types of vacancies
The vacancy formation energies can be used in a simple statis-
tical model to calculate the equilibrium concentration of various
surface oxygen vacancies when the system is in contact with gas-
eous oxygen. These concentrations depend on surface temperature
and oxygen pressure. Our model assumes that we can replace the
solid with a lattice in which each dopant is a lattice site. Near each
dopant we can have one of the following species: a vacancy next to
the dopant (denoted A), a vacancy away from the dopant (denoted
B) and two vacancies near the dopant (denoted C). We further as-
sume that the dopant surface concentration is low and these
vacancies do not interact with each other. Finally, we neglect the
changes in the chemical potential caused by changes in vibrational
frequencies of the solid when one of these vacancies is present. In
this model the equilibrium concentrations of these species are af-
fected only by the energy of forming them, by the conﬁgurational
entropy and by the chemical potential of gaseous oxygen. The lat-
ter is as important as the formation energies. The surface concen-
trations provided by this analysis will be present in the system
only if it is carefully equilibrated by exposing the material for as
long a time as necessary, to gas phase oxygen and ﬁxed partial
pressure and temperature. The details are elementary and are gi-
ven in the Appendix.
The dependence on temperature of the equilibrium concentra-
tions resulting from this calculation is given in Fig. 5, for a pressure
of 1 atm. On the (110) surface at 250 K, 20% of the dopants have a
vacancy next to them and no other type of vacancy is present. This
means that at equilibrium, 80% of dopants still have all the oxygen
Fig. 4. Structure of two oxygen vacancies in (a) and (b) the (110) and (c) and (d) the (100) surfaces, where the vacancies are near the dopant. The vacancy sites are indicated
with a ‘‘V” in the image. The coloring of the ions is the same as Fig. 1.
2738

atoms nearby. Since removal of the atoms adjacent to the dopant is
exothermic it is likely that they will easily engage in oxidation
reactions with molecules adsorbed on the surface. At about 400 K
the surface lost one oxygen atom next to each dopant and very
few vacancies away from the dopant or double vacancies are pres-
ent. Because the energy to make the second vacancy is less on the
doped surface than on the undoped one, the doped surface with
one oxygen vacancy near each dopant is still a better oxidant than
the undoped one.
3.5. CO adsorption on the (110) and (100) Surfaces
In this section, we investigate CO adsorption on the doped
(110) and (100) surfaces. Unlike Ref. [12], we make no attempt
to study the catalytic cycle for the formation of CO2 and the healing
of the vacancy. Instead, we wish to compare CO adsorption on the
doped and the undoped surfaces. The energy change upon CO
adsorption is
Eads ¼ ½EðCeO2  COÞ þ EðCeO2Þ  EðCOÞ:
ð3Þ
Eads is negative when the surface with adsorbed CO is more stable
than the surface separated from the CO.
The structure of CO on the (110) surface is shown in Fig. 6a.
Similar to the undoped surface, CO adsorbs to form a carbonate-
like structure in which two oxygen atoms are abstracted from
the surface to bond to the carbon of the carbonyl group. The car-
bonyl bond length is 1.26 Å and the bond between the carbon
and each of the two surface oxygen atoms is 1.32 Å. For the un-
doped surface these distances are 1.23 Å and 1.37 Å, respectively.
The adsorption energy on the doped surface is 4.70 eV, compared
to 1.95 eV on the undoped surface; the dopant greatly stabilizes
the carbonate. The calculated stretching frequency of the carbonyl
on the doped (110) surface is 1647 cm1, while on the undoped
(110) surface it is 1710 cm1 [17]. The latter value is fairly close
to the measured [33,34] frequency of 1728 cm1 for the C@O
stretch. For reference, gas phase CO has a stretching frequency of
2103 cm1. The substantial shift of C@O stretching frequency for
the doped surface can be used to identify the presence of a dopant
in the surface layer. This is important since it is in general difﬁcult
to prove experimentally that a doped surface has been prepared.
The doped (110) surface is distorted by CO adsorption: the dopant
and the Ce atom in the same row as the dopant move out of the
surface plane and the dopant itself moves away from the Ce atom
and from the carbonate.
On the (100) surface, CO reacts with the doped surface to form
CO2, as shown in Fig. 6b, with an energy gain of 3.90 eV. The CO2
molecule is 1 Å above the outermost surface layer The presence of
CO2 is indicated by C–O distances of 1.16 Å and 1.19 Å, consistent
with the C–O distance of 1.16 Å for gas phase CO2. The large ener-
getic stabilization of the adsorption structures indicates that the
surface oxygen atoms are very reactive, which is consistent with
the results of Section 3.2. On the (100) surface, the dopant moves
outwards to be in line with the surface oxygen atoms.

The atom and angular momentum decomposed Ce partial elec-
tronic density of states (PEDOS) is displayed in Fig. 7 for both sur-
faces. The valence band is peak I in Fig. 7 and the unoccupied Ce 4f
states are indicated by the narrow peak III. Peak II in the PEDOS
arises from the formation of reduced (formally) Ce3+ ions, in which
the Ce 4f states are occupied. This PEDOS feature is a signature of
reduced Ce, as has been shown in many studies [21,22,25,35–37].
The presence of the reduced Ce ions upon interaction with CO is
consistent with the results for the interaction of CO with the un-
doped surfaces in Refs. [16,17].
3.6. Discussion
Similar to the ﬁndings for the (111) surface in Ref. [12], the
presence of an Au dopant lowers dramatically the energy for oxy-
gen vacancy formation on the (110) and (100) surfaces. In fact, the
energy of vacancy formation is negative on all three CeO2 surfaces.
Thus cation doping in principle enhances the oxidative power of
ceria, irrespective of the surface present. However, the negative va-
cancy formation energy and our thermodynamics analysis indicate
that at temperatures applicable to catalysis, the dopant will have
an oxygen vacancy next to it. Therefore oxidation reactions will
be facilitated by forming a second oxygen vacancy. The vacancy
formation energies show that the dopant facilitates the formation
of a second oxygen vacancy on (110) but not on (100), revealing
a notable surface dependence that could be exploited in the design
of nanostructured ceria catalysts.
At 0 K, in the absence of oxygen in the gas phase, each dopant
will have a vacancy next to it. The exposure of the surface to
1 atm of O2 changes this situation. Below room temperature most
of the dopants will have no oxygen vacancy around them. Because
one oxygen atom next to each dopant is very weakly bound, the
surface will be a good low temperature oxidant. This does not
mean that it will be a good oxidation catalyst. The oxygen vacancy
created when the surface oxidizes a molecule must be healed by
adsorption of oxygen from the gas phase. Unless this reoxidation
of the surface is facile the oxidation reaction will reduce the sur-
face and at some point the oxidation process stops. A good oxidant
needs to give away oxygen easily. A good oxidation catalyst must
strike a balance [12]: if it gives oxygen too easily it will not be
effective in taking oxygen from the gas phase.
Another possible advantage of a doped oxide comes from the
fact that there is a temperature window in which the surface will
provide only one oxygen atom per dopant. This means that the
probability that doped oxides are selective oxidation catalysts is
high.
It is interesting to note that DFT [12] and DFT + U (this work)
provide the same general trend: vacancy formation in ceria sur-
faces is enhanced by Au doping, so that the qualitative results pro-
vided by DFT appear to be sound. It appears that for studies where,
e.g. energetics and structure are of interest, DFT and DFT + U gen-
erally provide qualitatively similar results. Other recent examples
where DFT was used rather than DFT + U include formaldehyde
on CeO2 [38], methanol on CeO2 [39] and butanediol on CeO2
(111) [40]. In addition, some studies of doped CeO2 have been pre-
sented, e.g. Ni–CeO2 [41] and rare earth doping [42]. It appears that
in describing many features of these systems, the description of the
electronic structure is not critical and DFT is adequate, although it
will be worth examining this assumption (for example CO adsorp-
tion is impacted by choice of DFT or DFT + U [13,43]) and we do ex-
pect DFT to be problematical where the electronic structure plays a
key role. This suggests that one strategy could be to use DFT for ini-
tial screening of e.g. dopants or adsorption structure and DFT + U to
provide the detailed analysis of the few potentially interesting sys-
tems. However, it is important to note that previous results [21]
show that the magnitude of the oxygen vacancy formation energy
is affected by the choice of approach, which is a reﬂection of the
different electronic structure produced by DFT and DFT + U.
With the example of CO adsorption, an intermediate step in CO
oxidation, we ﬁnd that doping is a favourable approach to enhanc-
ing the oxidation process. Similar to the undoped surface, the prod-
uct formed by adsorption depends on the crystal face. On the (110)
surface CO forms a carbonate while on the (100) surface CO ad-
sorbs on top of the oxygen atom near the dopant and forms a struc-
ture that is very close to a CO2 molecule. We trace this to the
surface structure, where the O–O distance on the (100) surface,
which is similar to (111), makes it hard for two oxygen atoms to
be pulled off their lattice sites and interact with CO to form CO3.
4. Conclusions
We have presented computations of oxygen vacancy formation
in and CO adsorption on gold-doped ceria (110) and (100) sur-
faces, using periodic plane wave density functional theory with
an on-site Coulomb correction (DFT + U). Similar to the ﬁndings
for the (111) surface in Ref. [12], the presence of the dopant lowers
dramatically the energy for oxygen vacancy formation on these
surfaces. In fact, the energy for vacancy formation is negative on
all three surfaces. Thus cation doping in principle will enhance
the oxidative power of ceria, irrespective of the surface. However,
the negative vacancy formation energy and our thermodynamic
analysis indicate that at temperatures applicable to catalysis, the
dopant will have an oxygen vacancy next to it. Therefore an oxida-
tion reaction will be facilitated by forming a second oxygen va-
cancy. The dopant facilitates the formation of a second vacancy
on (110) but not on (100), revealing a surface dependence,
which could be exploited in future catalytic systems based on
Fig. 7. Spin polarised Ce PEDOS for CO on (a) the Au-doped (110) surface and (b)
the Au-doped (100) surface. The zero of energy is the top of the valence band.

nanostructured ceria, which are known to expose faces other than
(111). Doping results in a temperature window in which the sur-
face provides a single oxygen atom per dopant, so that there is a
good probability that a doped oxide will be a good selective oxida-
tion catalyst. For CO adsorption, doping enhances the interaction of
the molecule with the surface, making carbonate formation on
(110) more favourable and facilitating direct formation of CO2 at
the (100) surface.
Finally, we point out that although doping enhances surface
reduction, it will be important to analyse how healing of the oxy-
gen vacancy, either by oxygen or a molecule such as NOX, is im-
pacted by doping.

Appendix
We use a lattice model to calculate the equilibrium concentra-
tion of vacancies on the surface, as a function of the oxygen pres-
sure and the surface temperature. The model considers three
possible surface species: a vacancy near the dopant (denoted A),
a vacancy away from the dopant (denoted B) and two vacancies
(denoted C). The model assumes that the only role of the solid is
to provide lattice sites for these species and that the species do
not interact. This means that the partition function of the whole
system is the partition function of the lattice multiplied with the
partition functions of each species. In addition, it is assumed that
we can neglect the change in the partition function of the lattice
due to the presence of the vacancies even though the phonon spec-
trum is affected. Due to these assumptions the chemical potential
of the lattice cancels out when the equilibrium conditions are writ-
ten. The free energy of the system is therefore

Here M is the number of dopants on the surface, NX is the number of
species X (i.e. NA is the number of vacancies of type A), qX is the par-
tition function of an isolated vacancy of type X and cX is the number
of equivalent sites for a vacancy of type X around a dopant site.

Here S represents the surface without vacancies. The ﬁrst equilib-
rium is the formation of a vacancy of type A by desorbing oxygen,
the second is the equilibrium between A and B achieved by the dif-
fusion of the vacancy from A to B and the third is the formation of C
by desorbing oxygen from a surface that already has a vacancy A
near the dopant. The equilibrium conditions are [44]

with the chemical potential lO2 for diatomic oxygen given by stan-
dard formulae [45].
The partition functions for various types of vacancies are
qX ¼ exp½eX=kBT, with eX the energy of formation of a vacancy
of type X.
The equilibrium conditions provide three equations which we
solve (with Mathematica) to obtain hA, hB and hC as functions of T
and p (the partial pressure of oxygen). The energies eX are those
calculated in the present article, the data for O2 was taken from
Ref. [45] and the symmetry constants are cA = 4, cB = 8 and cC = 2.
