Abstract
An analysis of the ‘‘mechanism’’ and the assumptions incorporated into the derivation of the Mars–van Krevelen rate expression for
heterogeneously catalyzed oxidation reactions reveals a number of inconsistencies. The expression as derived is properly applicable only for a
reaction involving molecular oxygen adsorbed on a single site; however, the model assumes that lattice O ions (or atoms) react with the substrate
being oxidized. Furthermore, the steps describing the model are not elementary steps and, in addition, the competitive adsorption of intermediates
and products is not considered. Consequently, the original derivation is incorrect and this rate expression must be viewed only as a mathematical
data-ﬁtting function. Alternative Langmuir–Hinshelwood, Hougen–Watson-type catalytic sequences can typically provide similar, and sometimes
identical, rate equations which can ﬁt rate data better than, or at least as well as, the Mars–van Krevelen expression. These latter models also
provide rate parameters that can be evaluated for thermodynamic consistency.

Researchers in catalysis, or in any other ﬁeld for that matter,
should be thorough in their awareness, review, and citation of
previous relevant work, not only to avoid ‘‘rediscovering the
wheel’’, but also to assess the validity and completeness of
these earlier studies. For instance, during the learning process,
it is important to understand the rationale and any assumptions
that are incorporated into the derivation of a particular rate
expression. An appropriate example of this is the Mars–van
Krevelen rate expression, which invokes a surface redox
mechanism and has been used to describe rates of oxidation
reactions on heterogeneous oxide catalysts for over 50 years
[1]. Although their rate expression has been frequently cited
and utilized, I cannot ﬁnd any paper that has analyzed and
assessed the kinetic steps comprising their ‘‘mechanism’’ for
this general reaction and has evaluated the assumptions
resulting in the ﬁnal rate equation. This paper, therefore,
constitutes such an effort. It will show that the derivation is
erroneous and that the rate expression reported in their paper
(the subscript R refers to the reactant being oxidized):
rR ¼
1
1=k1PR þ b=k2Pn
O2
¼
k1k2PRPn
O2
k1PR þ k2Pn
O2
(1)
is inapplicable for any value of n other than unity, and even then
the equation is inconsistent with the assumptions made in the
model.
In their study utilizing vanadium oxide catalysts, Mars and
van Krevelen investigated the oxidation of benzene to
benzoquinone, maleic anhydride, CO2, CO and H2O, toluene
to benzaldehyde and benzoic acid, naphthalene to naphtho-
quinone and phthalic anhydride, and anthracene to anthraqui-
none and phthalic anhydride. They also applied their rate
equation to data reported in the literature for SO2 oxidation to
SO3 over various vanadium oxide-based catalysts (1). Their
reaction ‘‘mechanism’’ was written as follows:
I. aromatic compound þ oxidized catalyst
!
k1 oxidation
products þ reduced catalyst
II. reduced catalyst þ oxygen
!
k2 oxidized catalyst
The following assumptions were then made:
(1) the reaction in step I is ﬁrst order with respect to the reactant
and the fraction of sites covered by oxygen, u;
(2) certain lattice O ions at the surface are involved in the
oxidation reaction in step I;
(3) only O ions (atoms) are assumed to exist on these sites (no
reactant or products);

(4) the rate of surface reoxidation (step II), i.e., O2 adsorption,
is proportional to Pn
O2 and to the concentration of active
sites not covered by oxygen, i.e., 1  u.
Based on these assumptions, these two steps above can be
more correctly represented by the following two equations:
R þ x O  S
!
k1 Products þ x S
(2)
 x
2

½2S þ O2
!
k2 2O  S
(3)
where S represents an active site (a lattice surface vacancy).
Their derivation is as follows [1]. From step I:
rR ¼ k1PRu
(4)
and from step II:
rO2 ¼ k2Pn
O2ð1  uÞ
(5)
If the oxidation of one aromatic molecule requires b molecules
of O2, then
rR ¼ rO2
b
(6)
and at steady state:
bk1PRu ¼ k2Pn
O2ð1  uÞ
(7)
Consequently,
u ¼
k2Pn
O2
bk1PR þ k2Pn
O2
(8)
and from Eqs. (4) and (8) the ﬁnal rate expression is that given
by Eq. (1).
Let us now examine the problems associated with this
particular model:
(A) First and foremost, from the kinetic theory of gases, the rate
of adsorption of a molecule onvacant sites is always directly
proportional to its pressure [2]; therefore, step II is valid only
when n = 1. Furthermore, Eq. (5) represents only single-site
adsorption because if two sites were required, (1  u)2
would be used, thus molecular O2 adsorption on a single site
is indicated. However, the oxidation of the reactant is
assumed to involve O lattice ions, which necessitates O2
dissociation into atomsor ions prior to reaction.This omitted
step constitutes a major inconsistency in the model.
(B) Step I is clearly not an elementary step and the probability
of a single multi-body interaction between an aromatic
molecule and surface oxygen atoms to produce all the
products is clearly essentially zero. Thus a sequence of
elementary steps constituting the surface oxidation process
is a much more correct way to represent the chemistry
associated with step I. Note that the simplest reaction
studied, toluene oxidation to benzaldehyde:
C6H5CH3 þ O2 ! C6H5CHO þ H2O
(9)
requires two O atoms if it occurs with 100% selectivity,
which is highly unlikely, and if this occurs as a single
elementary step it still requires, as a minimum, the break-
ing of three bonds and the formation of three bonds
simultaneously, which is highly improbable. An even more
extreme case is the oxidation of naphthalene to phthalic
anhydride, which requires a minimum of nine O atoms:
C10H8 þ 9
2O2 ! C6H4ðCOÞ2O þ 2CO2 þ 2H2O
(10)
The obvious requirement of multiple bond breaking and
bond making clearly eliminates the possibility of the
Rideal–Eley reaction represented by step I.
(C) Finally,
an
additional
limitation
exists
because
no
intermediate species or ﬁnal products (or reactant other
than oxygen) are included in the site balance—only O ions
(atoms) are considered even though only nondissociative
O2 adsorption is represented by step 2, as written.
As a result of this analysis, one concludes that, although a
surface redox mechanism may properly describe the oxidation
process, the rate expression derived by Mars and van Krevelen
is inconsistent and incorrect, and it must be viewed only as a
mathematical data-ﬁtting function with no physical relevance.
Having said this, it is fair to ask if other surface redox rate
expressions, based on valid kinetic steps, can be derived which
provide rate equations identical or similar to Eq. (1). First, in a
catalytic
sequence
of
irreversible
steps,
if
the
surface
intermediate involved in the last step is the most abundant
reactive intermediate (mari), then the only two kinetically
signiﬁcant steps are the ﬁrst one and the last one [3].
Consequently, steps I and II can be more properly represented
as a series of irreversible elementary steps, if desired, without
complicating the kinetic rate expression signiﬁcantly because
oxidation reactions are quite irreversible in nature and adsorbed
oxygen in some form is very possibly the mari. Second, the
possibility of an activated O2 molecule adsorbed on a lattice
vacancy (an active site) can be considered. Now, if the very
simplest oxidation reactions are examined, i.e., the addition of
either an O2 molecule or an O atom to the reactant with no by-
products, they can be respectively represented as
R þ O2  S
!
k1 RO2  S
(11)
RO2  S
!
k2 RO2 þ S
(12)
O2 þ S
!
k3 O2  S
(13)
R þ O2 ! RO2
(14)
and
R þ O2  S
!
k1 RO þ O  S
(15)
R þ O  S
!
k2 RO þ S
(16)
O2 þ S
!
k3 O2  S
(17)
2R þ O2 ! 2RO
(18)

even though whether all steps can be considered to be elemen-
tary is questionable. Regardless, one sees in either case that
r1 = r2 = r3 at steady state, and rR = 2r1 in the latter sequence. If
the adsorbed oxygen is molecular and O2–S is the mari, then a
site balance gives:
uO2 ¼
k3PO2
k1PR þ k3PO2
(19)
and the ﬁnal rate equation is identical to the Mars–van Krevelen
expression with n = 1:
rR ¼
k1k3PRPO2
k1PR þ k3PO2
(20)
or, in the latter sequence:
rR ¼ 2k1k3PRPO2
k1PR þ k3PO2
(21)
Alternatively, if one considers a Hougen–Watson (H–W) model
assuming desorption of the product, either RO2 or RO, is the
rate determining step (rds) with all previous elementary steps
quasi-equilibrated, for example:
(22)
(23)
(24)
RO2  S
!
k4 RO2 þ S
(25)
and then assumes that the active sites are nearly saturated with
adsorbed R and adsorbed oxygen so that the vacant site con-
centration is extremely low [4], then the H–W rate expression
involving nondissociative O2 adsorption is
rR ¼
kO2PRPO2
KRPR þ KO2PO2
(26)
and for a similar sequence involving dissociative O2 adsorption
it is
rR ¼
kOPRP1=2
O2
KRPR þ K1=2
O2 P1=2
O2
(27)
These two equations are identical to the Mars–van Krevelen
rate expression for n = 1 and 1/2, respectively; however, it can
be readily argued that product desorption in an oxidation
reaction is unlikely to be a rds. Regardless, the KR and KO2
parameters represent adsorption equilibrium constants which
can be evaluated for their validity [3,4].
If the Mars–van Krevelen assumption that lattice O ions are
involved in the reaction is enforced, then, from steps 4 and 5,
the simplest reaction sequence is
O2 þ 2S
!
k1 2O  S
(28)
2½R þ O  S
!
k2 RO þ S
(29)
2R þ O2 ! 2RO
(30)
The rate is rR = k2PRuO and at steady state:
d½O  S
dt
¼ 2k1PO2u2
v  k2PRuO ¼ 0
(31)
where uv is the fraction of empty sites and the overall site
density, L, is incorporated into k1 and k2. If only O atoms (ions)
are included in the site balance, then
1 ¼ uO þ uv
(32)
and
uO ¼ 2k1PO2ð1  uOÞ2
k2PR
(33)
thus the rate contains a quadratic solution for the surface
coverage of oxygen ions and a Mars–van Krevelen expression
is not obtained. If a much less likely, but possible, sequence
involving a three-body interaction resulting in the simulta-
neous addition of two O atoms is considered, steps 4 and 5
give:
O2 þ 2S
!
k1 2O  S
(34)
R þ 2O  S
!
k2 RO2  2S
(35)
R þ O2 ! RO2
(36)
The rate is now rR ¼ k2PRu2
O and at steady state:
d½O  S
dt
¼ 2k1PO2u2
v  2k2PRu2
O ¼ 0
(37)
If only O atoms are included in the site balance, the ﬁnal
rate is
rR ¼
k1k2PRPO2
ðk1=2
2 P1=2
R
þ k1=2
1 P1=2
O2 Þ
2
(38)
which again does not conform to the Mars–van Krevelen rate
expression given by Eq. (1).
It is now worthwhile to consider some Langmuir–
Hinshelwood (L–H) rate expressions that could easily
represent more realistic reaction models, i.e., the rds is an
elementary step occurring on the surface and all other steps
are quasi-equilibrated. One reaction model that results in an
equation similar to Eq. (1) is a bimolecular surface reaction
between R adsorbed on one type of site (S1) and oxygen
adsorbed on another, such as a lattice vacancy (S2).
Considering the different size and chemistry of the R
molecule, this may well be a very reasonable assumption.
If an irreversible reaction with an adsorbed activated O2
species to form RO2 is chosen, then, if only adsorbed R
and
O2
are
the
dominant

species,
the
rate

expression is [4]:
rR ¼
k0PRPO2
ð1 þ KRPRÞð1 þ KO2PO2Þ
(39)
which has similarities to Eq. (1) with n = 1 if the pressure terms
are large relative to unity, but KR and KO2 again represent
adsorption equilibrium constants, which can be evaluated to
determine if the model is physically and thermodynamically
consistent [3,4]. Alternatively, if only a single O atom is added
to produce RO, then the rate expression is [4]:
rR ¼
k0PRP1=2
O2
ð1 þ KRPRÞð1 þ K1=2
O2 P1=2
O2 Þ
(40)
which has similarities to Eq. (1) with n = 1/2. Over a limited
range of pressures, these latter two expressions will have the
capability to ﬁt data as well as, or better than, Eq. (1), because
of an additional ﬁtting parameter.
If adsorption of R and oxygen on the same type of site
(lattice vacancies) is assumed, then the denominator in the rate
expression, which reﬂects the site balance, will be squared and,
if addition of the ﬁrst O atom is the rds, it has for an irreversible
reaction the form [4]:
rR ¼
k0PRP1=2
O2
ð1 þ KRPR þ K1=2
O2 P1=2
O2 Þ
2
(41)
if only adsorbed R and oxygen are included in the site balance.
If the rds involves an O2 molecule to form RO2 as a product and
again the site balance includes only adsorbed R and oxygen, the
rate expression is
rR ¼
k0PRPO2
ð1 þ KRPR þ KO2PO2Þ2
(42)
Alternatively, if addition of two O ions (atoms) occurs sequen-
tially to form RO2 as a product, with addition of the second O
atom being the rds, all other steps quasi-equilibrated, and only
R and O atoms included in the site balance, the ﬁnal rate
expression is
rR ¼
k0PRPO2
ð1 þ KRPR þ K1=2
O2 P1=2
O2 Þ
2
(43)
It is again highly likely that, with three ﬁtting parameters,
these latter two expressions can provide ﬁts to kinetic data
better than Eq. (1). Finally, it is very likely that sequences of
irreversible elementary steps, more complicated than those
shown in Eqs. (11)–(18) and possibly involving only lattice
O ions, can be proposed which result in rate expressions
similar to Eq. (1) which can ﬁt rate data equally well after
reasonable, appropriate and consistent assumptions are made
to eliminate the contradictions contained in the Mars–van
Krevelen model.
Finally, as a test of their model, the above authors applied
it to rate data available for SO2 oxidation to SO3 over
vanadia-based catalysts [1], the sequence of which was
represented as
SO2 þ Cat  O
!
k1 SO3 þ Cat
(44)
Cat þ O2
!
k2 CatO
(45)
where Cat–O and Cat correspond to the oxidized and reduced
catalyst, respectively. Note that this does not represent a
balanced sequence. Regardless, they cited reports that SO3
strongly reduced the rate of SO2 formation and assumed that
a third reaction:
SO3 þ Cat
!
k3 SO2 þ CatO
(46)
was equilibrated and controlled the concentration of vacant
sites (oxygen was not included). As a consequence, the derived
rate expression had the form:
rSO2 ¼
kPSO2Pn
SO2
KPSO2 þ PSO3
(47)
which they stated provided satisfactory ﬁts to data from several
studies, with n = 1/2 in one particular case. Now, one recog-
nizes that a bimolecular reaction between SO2 and O atoms in a
rds assuming that two types of sites exist gives the following
expression for a reversible reaction [4]:
rSO2 ¼
k1PSO2P1=2
O2  k2PSO3
ð1 þ KSO2PSO2 þ KSO3PSO3Þð1 þ K1=2
O2 P1=2
O2 Þ
(48)
which allows for a negative effect of SO3 on the rate. However,
even for an irreversible reaction, if uSO3, uSO2  uv on S1 sites
and uO  uv on S2 sites, the rate becomes:
rSO2 ¼
kPSO2P1=2
O2
KSO2PSO2 þ KSO3PSO3
(49)
which is identical to Eq. (47) with n = 1/2. Furthermore, if uO is
not assumed to be very small, then n can vary between 0 and 1/
2. A similar sequence involving adsorbed O2 molecules can
give [4]:
k PSO2PO2
ðKSO2PSO2 þ KSO3PSO3Þð1 þ PO2Þ
(50)
which is similar to Eq. (47) with n = l and now allows values of
n from zero to unity.
In summary, the Mars–van Krevelen kinetic model for
redox oxidation reactions on solid catalysts, as originally
stated, is inconsistent and incorrect. Consequently, the rate
expression derived from this model is inapplicable except for
one particular situation involving the adsorption of O2
molecules on a single site; however, in this instance the
model is still inconsistent because O ions (or atoms) are
proposed as the reactive oxygen species rather than adsorbed
O2 molecules. As a result, the form of the rate expression in
Eq. (1) has no physical relevance and must be viewed only as

not identical, rate equations which can ﬁt rate data better

expression.
