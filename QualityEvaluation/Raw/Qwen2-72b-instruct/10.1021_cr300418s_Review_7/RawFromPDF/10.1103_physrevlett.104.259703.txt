Comment on ‘‘Oxygen Vacancy Origin of the Surface
Band-Gap State of TiO2ð110Þ’’
Recently, increasing research efforts have been dedi-
cated to unravel the nature of the band-gap state of reduced
titania (TiO2) [1–4]. In a recent Letter, Yim et al. [5]
address this seminally important question and claim to
present direct evidence that the band-gap state measured
on
bulk-reduced
rutile
TiO2ð110Þ-ð1  1Þ
originates
mainly from oxygen vacancies (Ob vac) rather than from
Ti interstitials, as we proposed in Ref. [1]. In this
Comment, we reveal that the data analysis by Yim et al.
[5] is based on an erroneous assumption and that their
conclusions are consequently incorrect.
Yim et al. [5] started with four differently prepared
samples: i.e., (i) a mildly reduced TiO2ð110Þ sample [red
dot in Fig. 4(a) of [5]], (ii) a more reduced sample [dark
blue dot in Fig. 4(a) of [5]], (iii) a hydroxylated sample
[ﬁlled square in Fig. 4(b) of [5]], and (iv) an oxidized
sample [ﬁlled circle in Fig. 4(b) of [5]]. To disentangle
surface and near-surface contributions to the gap state,
Yim et al. irradiated two of the samples [(i) and (iv)]
with low-energy electrons (75 eV, 1 mA, current density
0:2 mA=cm2) for total durations of up to 20 s to reduce
the samples while monitoring the intensity of the gap state.
From a linear extrapolation of the gap-state intensity into
the region of low surface defect [Ob vac or hydroxyl
(OHb)] density, Yim et al. concluded that the gap state
stems mainly from Ob vac. The basis of this conclusion is
the assumption that electron (e) irradiation leads to an
increase in the Ob vac density only, while the near-surface
region is anticipated to be unaffected.
However, this crucial assumption made by Yim et al. is
incorrect as documented by the authors’ very own experi-
mental data. In Figs. 1(a) and 1(b) we replotted the evolu-
tion of the gap-state intensity and the Ob vac density,
respectively, with e-irradiation time for the experiment
performed by Yim et al. on the mildly reduced sample (i)
[see Fig. 4(a) of [5]]. While the gap-state area is found to
increase linearly in time, the Ob vac density shows a highly
nonlinear dependence. Note, in particular, the results by
Yim et al. obtained after 10 and 20 s of e irradiation: the
Ob vac density decreases, whereas the gap-state intensity
increases. This shows clearly that the measured gap-state
intensity is not a single-valued function of the measured Ob
vac density. Thus, indisputably, near-surface defects other
than Ob vac are introduced to the sample by e irradiation.
Apparently, these additional defects are not surface defects
since the only new species observed by Yim et al. are
‘‘pitlike structures’’ that were found to be in very minute
abundance even after 20 s irradiation. Hence, the additional
defects are near-surface defects that are not directly visible
in the STM images. The occurrence of unintended addi-
tional changes to the near-surface region implies that Yim
et al. cannot disentangle the contributions from the various
defect species to the gap state.
The situation is even more complicated in the experi-
ment by Yim et al. on the oxidized sample (iv) [see
Fig. 4(b) of [5]]. Here, three parameters were changed
simultaneously upon e irradiation: removal of adsorbates
such as O adatoms, creation of Ob vac, and the creation of
defects in the near-surface region (see above), all of which
inﬂuence the gap state. It is not possible to disentangle the
various contributions to the gap state from this complex
experiment.
On the contrary, in our own experiment [1], the surface
defect concentration was varied in a much gentler manner.
Our starting point was a hydroxylated TiO2ð110Þ; i.e., all
the Ob vac on a sputter-annealed TiO2ð110Þ sample were
replaced by OHb. Subsequently, we successively removed
the OHb through a reaction with O2 while monitoring the
gap-state intensity. Since the gap state retained 70% of its
original intensity when the surface was nearly defect-free,
we concluded that the gap state originates mainly from
defects in the near-surface region, e.g., Ti interstitials [1].
This experiment allowed us to clearly identify the contri-
bution of Ob vac to the gap state to be of minor importance.
