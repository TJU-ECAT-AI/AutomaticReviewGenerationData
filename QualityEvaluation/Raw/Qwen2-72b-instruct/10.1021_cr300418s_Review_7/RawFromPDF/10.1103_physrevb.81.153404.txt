Low-energy electron-diffraction and surface x-ray diffraction data acquired from TiO211011 are re-
analyzed to conﬁrm the integrity of the previously reported optimized geometries. This work is performed in
response to ab initio density-functional theory calculations that suggest that the atomic displacements deter-
mined from low-energy electron-diffraction measurements may be compromised by the limited number of
optimized atom positions. Performing structural optimizations as a function of depth into the selvedge, this
present study validates the previous experimental structure determinations.

TiO211011 has emerged as the prototypical metal-
oxide surface for fundamental studies in ultrahigh vacuum.1,2
A key element of the prominence of this substrate is a reli-
able quantitative description of its stoichiometric geometric
structure. Such knowledge has been derived in four contem-
porary experimental studies,3–6 each using a different diffrac-
tion technique, i.e., quantitative low-energy electron diffrac-

SXRD.6 The four independently optimized structures re-
sulting from this body of work exhibit a high degree of
agreement, demonstrating experimental consensus. Ab initio
calculations, however, suggest that the atomic displacements
determined from LEED-IV Ref. 3 may result from the lim-
ited number of adjustable atomic layers employed during
structure optimization.7,8 Here, we demonstrate otherwise,
conﬁrming the essential validity of both the previous
LEED-IV Ref. 3 and SXRD Ref. 6 structure determina-
tions.
Thompson and Lewis have employed density-functional
theory DFT with the generalized gradient approximation
GGA to calculate the surface energy and geometry of
TiO211011.7,8 Calculations were performed using a se-
ries of suitably oriented two-dimensional TiO2 slabs of in-
creasing thickness to examine the impact of this parameter
on both energetic and geometric convergence. Figure 1a
displays a ball-and-stick model of one of these slabs, which
is referred to as a ﬁve-trilayer slab in Refs. 7 and 8; the
trilayer units are indicated in the ﬁgure. It should be noted
that all of the slabs considered were centrosymmetric, result-
ing in their upper and lower halves being equivalent, as in-
dicated by the mirror plane in Fig. 1a. In accord with pre-
vious work,9 it was concluded7,8 that a slab consisting of 13
trilayers is required to achieve a fully converged surface en-
ergy, i.e., there is no signiﬁcant variation in surface energy at
greater slab thicknesses.
A
geometrically
converged
slab
was
attained
by
Thompson and Lewis at nine trilayers. Notably, this relaxed
ab initio DFT-GGA geometry is not consistent with experi-
mental work.3–6 There is, however, good coincidence be-
tween the optimized geometry of a thinner, ﬁve-trilayer slab
Fig. 1a and the optimized LEED-IV structure;3 the atoms
adjusted in Ref. 3 during structure optimization are indicated
in Fig. 1b. It is concluded that this agreement is a result of
virtually the same atoms being optimized in both the ﬁve-
trilayer slab total energy minimization and the LEED-IV
structure determination, as can be discerned from Figs. 1a
and 1b, remembering that a mirror plane is imposed in Fig.
1a. On this basis, Thompson and Lewis implicitly suggest
that increasing the depth of the optimized selvedge may sig-
niﬁcantly alter the LEED-IV solution. In this Brief Report,
this
possibility
is
addressed
by
explicitly
reanalyzing
LEED-IV data collected from TiO211011 Ref. 3 as a
function of depth into the selvedge. The SXRD data pre-
sented in Ref. 6 are similarly re-examined. In both cases, the
earlier optimized structures are validated, removing any am-
biguity suggested in Refs. 7 and 8.
For this study, the LEED-IV and SXRD experimental data
sets were identical to those analyzed previously.3,6 Surface-
structure determination involved generating simulated dif-
fraction data for a potential structure, and then iteratively
optimizing the geometry to achieve the best ﬁt between ex-
perimental and simulated data. The same software packages
that were used in Refs. 3 and 6 were employed for this pur-

pose, i.e., the Barberi-Van Hove Automated Tensor LEED
code10 and the DL_LEED package11 for LEED-IV, and the ROD
software12 for SXRD. Furthermore, the self-consistent phase
shifts applied in Ref. 3 were again adopted for generating
simulated LEED-IV data. Goodness of ﬁt between experi-
mental and simulated data was quantitatively assessed for
LEED-IV and SXRD by the Pendry reliability factor Rp
Ref. 13 and 2,14 respectively. For both the LEED-IV and
SXRD analyses, all nonstructural parameters were con-
strained to be the same as those used for generating the origi-
nal best-ﬁt simulated data,3,6 except for one LEED-IV pa-
rameter, the inner potential, which was allowed to vary
freely. As a check on the integrity of the analysis procedures,
it was conﬁrmed that the best ﬁts were essentially identical
to those obtained previously if the same parameters were
employed LEED-IV: Rp=0.29 Ref. 3 and SXRD: 2=1.5
Ref. 6.
To investigate how the depth of the optimized selvedge
impacts upon the LEED-IV/SXRD solutions, structure deter-
minations have been performed as a function of the number
of adjustable layers. The layers employed are depicted in
Fig. 1c. As illustrated, the ﬁrst layer consists simply of the
so-called bridging oxygen atoms, whereas each of the deeper
layers are composed of an upper Ti-O plane above an O
bilayer. This layering scheme was chosen to allow direct
comparison with the ab initio DFT-GGA slab calculations,7,8
as virtually the same atoms are optimized in n+1/2 LEED-
IV/SXRD adjustable layers as in a calculated n-trilayer slab
N.B. Displacements of atoms lying on the mirror plane in-
dicated in Fig. 1a are symmetry forbidden during optimi-
zation, expect for in-plane shifts of O8 and O8.. Fur-
thermore, layers 1, 2, and 3 in Fig. 1c correspond to the
atoms optimized in the original LEED-IV structure determi-
nation Fig. 1b.3 Best ﬁt Rp’s LEED-IV and 2’s SXRD
as a function of the number of adjustable layers are plotted in
Fig. 2a. As evidenced by the decrease in Rp/2, it is clear
that initially the ﬁts improve considerably as the number of
layers optimized increases. Beyond six optimized layers
equivalent to an 11-trilayer calculated slab there is no fur-
ther signiﬁcant improvement in either Rp or 2, i.e., the ﬁts
become converged as regards this parameter.
Concerning the LEED-IV analysis, it is striking that the
lowest Rp i.e., 0.23 is appreciably smaller than the value
i.e., 0.29 obtained following optimization of only the atoms
considered in the original structure determination.3 Table I
lists the atomic displacements away from bulk termination
for Rp=0.23 six-layer optimization, along with those pre-
sented in Ref. 3 three-layer optimization. Differences
LEED-IV between corresponding atomic displacements are
also given. Not all LEED-IV’s are 0, which is expected from
the observed decrease in Rp. However, there are no signiﬁ-
cant discrepancies between the two optimum structures as all
LEED-IV’s are within experimental error. The least insigniﬁ-
cant LEED-IV’s are for the vertical and lateral displacements
of O2, namely, 0.080.11 and 0.070.20 Å, respec-
tively. We have explored the possibility that these relatively
large LEED-IV’s are a result of correlation between these two
parameters but have found no evidence to support this idea.
Also listed in Table I are the atomic displacements asso-
ciated with the converged six-layer SXRD optimization. It

should be pointed out that these displacements are identical
to
those
presented
in
the
original
SXRD
structure
determination,6 as the same atoms were optimized in both
cases, although the displacements of deeper atoms were not
explicitly stated in Ref. 6. As already discussed in Refs. 2
and 6, the agreement between the optimum LEED-IV and
SXRD structures is impressive, especially as many of the
atomic displacements have been determined rather precisely.
As regards precision, one further point to glean from Table I
is that the LEED-IV error bars increase much more rapidly
with depth than those associated with the SXRD measure-
ments. This phenomenon is to be expected given the greater
surface sensitivity of LEED.
On the basis of the above results, it is clear that the origi-
nal
optimum
atomic
displacements
determined
for
TiO211011 from LEED-IV data3 are not erroneous due
to the limited depth of the optimized surface selvedge. It is
not disputed that adjusting too few atoms can inﬂuence the
outcome of such a structure determination. However, this is
not the case in Ref. 3. These two points are demonstrated
graphically in Fig. 2b, which displays the displacement of
two surface atoms, O1 bridging oxygen and Ti2 ﬁve-
fold titanium, as a function of the number of optimized lay-
ers. There are three plots for each atom, showing the dis-
placements obtained from LEED-IV solid circle markers,
SXRD solid square markers, and ab initio DFT-GGA cal-
culations crosses7,8 N.B. To plot the theoretically derived
displacements on the same x axis the near equivalence, in
terms of adjustable atoms, of n+1/2 LEED-IV/SXRD lay-
ers and an ab initio calculated n trilayer slab was employed.

determinations. Figure 1c shows both the layering scheme and the identity of the atoms. A negative value indicates that the atom moves
toward the bulk for a displacement perpendicular to the surface plane, and in the 11

PHYSICAL REVIEW B 81, 153404 2010
153404-3
For clarity, an upper x axis showing the corresponding num-
ber of trilayers is included in the ﬁgure. Focusing on the
experimentally derived data, it can be seen that for both O1
and Ti2 displacement becomes almost constant for three-
layer optimization and beyond. For one- and two-layer opti-
mizations, the displacement of O1 obtained from LEED-IV,
in particular, varies signiﬁcantly.
Figure 2b also shows that the converged ab initio DFT-
GGA displacements of both O1 and Ti2 Refs. 7 and 8
are not consistent with experiment. Moreover, it is almost
certain that the reported7,8 coincidence of the ﬁve-trilayer ab
initio DFT geometry and the original LEED-IV solution
three-layer optimization shown in Fig. 2b is simply for-
tuitous. We note that other ab initio DFT calculations of the
geometric structure of TiO211011, employing slightly
different approximations, more closely match the experimen-
tal structural solution.15,16 The extreme sensitivity of the
computed structure to adopted approximations has previ-
ously been analyzed in terms of soft vibrational modes both
in the bulk17 and at the 110 surface.18
Finally, Thompson and Lewis propose that optimized sur-
face geometries, either computed or experimental, should be
reported in terms of bond lengths and bond angles rather
than atomic displacements.8 They argue that this approach
would present the structure “in terms of more physically rel-
evant quantities.” While it is clear one can simply translate
atomic displacements into bond lengths and angles, we do
agree that for some purposes explicit listing of these latter
parameters would give more immediate insight. Thus, a list
of bond lengths and bond angles between selected atoms are
given in Table II.
In summary, LEED-IV and SXRD data acquired from
TiO211011 have been reanalysed to conﬁrm the reli-
ability of the original structure determinations.3,6 More spe-
ciﬁcally, prompted by ab initio DFT-GGA calculations7,8
structural optimization has been performed as a function of
depth into the selvedge. This present study validates the pre-
vious structural solutions.3,6
