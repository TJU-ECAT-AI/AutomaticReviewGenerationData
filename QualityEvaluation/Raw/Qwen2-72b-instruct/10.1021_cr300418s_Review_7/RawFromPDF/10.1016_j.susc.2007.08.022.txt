Abstract
We use density functional theory (DFT) with the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) and the revised Perdew–Burke–Ernzer-
hoﬀ(rPBE) functional, to study the surface composition of the (111) and (100) dilute Pd/Au alloy. We ﬁnd that the energy of Pd atoms
is lower when they substitute an Au atom in the bulk than when they substitute an Au atom in the surface layer, or when they are
adsorbed on the surface. Whether they are in the surface layer or in the bulk, the Pd atoms interact very weakly with each other. CO
adsorbs on the Pd atom in the surface layer and the energy of this complex is lower than that of CO in gas and Pd atom in the bulk.
The interaction between the PdCO complexes formed when CO adsorbs on a Pd atom imbedded in the surface layer, is also negligible.
We use these energies, equilibrium thermodynamics, and a simple lattice–gas model to examine the equilibrium composition of the sur-
face layer, as a function of temperature, CO pressure and the Pd/Au ratio. We ﬁnd that the surface Pd concentration for a nanoparticle
of an Au/Pd alloy diﬀers from that in a bulk sample. The diﬀerence is due mainly to the fact that in a nanoparticle the migration of Pd
atoms to the surface depletes the bulk concentration while in a large sample; the bulk provides an inﬁnite source of Pd atoms to populate
the surface sites. This system is of interest because Pd/Au alloys are selective catalysts for vinyl acetate synthesis when the Pd concen-
tration on the surface is very low.

1. Introduction
The surface composition of Au/Pd alloys has been stud-
ied by a variety of techniques which indicate that the sur-
face concentration of Au is greater than its concentration
in the bulk. Auger electron spectroscopy (AES) determined
(from the ratios of the Pd (330 eV) to Au (71 eV) peaks)
that the surface of polycrystalline alloy foils [1] and of va-
por-deposited thin ﬁlms [2] has a higher concentration of
Au than the bulk. Au enrichment in the surface of poly-
crystalline Au/Pd alloys was also found by ion scattering
spectroscopy (ISS) [3]. LEED and ISS measurements [4,5]
on Au3Pd(110) single crystal surfaces found that the upper
layer was pure Au, a result conﬁrmed by scanning tunnel-
ing microscopy (STM) studies [6]. Moreover, after heating
to 875 K, the surface of the Au3Pd(100) becomes pure,
unreconstructed Au(100). AES, LEISS, X-ray photoelec-
tron spectroscopy (XPS), and LEED measurements [7] of
ultra-thin ﬁlms of Pd on Au(111), found that a Pd/Au al-
loy is formed if the substrate temperature is above 300 K.
Goodman et al. [8] prepared Au/Pd alloy ﬁlms on a
Mo(110) substrate, by using vapor deposition. The Pd sur-
face concentration was determined using ISS, XPS, infra-
red (IR) spectroscopy and thermal desorption (TPD) of
adsorbed CO. They too found that the surface is rich in
Au.
Pd catalyzes the formation of vinyl acetate from acetic
acid, ethylene and oxygen and alloying with Au increases
selectivity. Goodman’s group studied this process exten-
sively [9–12] and found that selectivity is highest when
the amount of Pd in the alloy is small. They proposed that
the reaction center for the formation of the vinyl acetate
consists of two non-contiguous Pd atoms. They explained

the increased selectivity by assuming that the competing,
unwanted reactions require more than two Pd atoms and
are suppressed when such Pd clusters are absent on the sur-
face (which happens when the Pd/Au ratio is small).
Stimulated by Goodman’s proposal we have performed
density functional calculations to answer several questions.
First, we would like to know how the distribution of Pd
atoms between surface and bulk depends on temperature,
total Pd concentration and the presence of CO in the gas
phase. We have chosen to look at the eﬀect of CO because
the shift in its vibrational frequency was used to determine
whether the Pd forms monomers or dimers. The CO mole-
cule forming a ‘‘bridge’’ bond to a dimer has a diﬀerent CO
vibrational frequency than a CO molecule bound to a
monomer. Second, one wonders why the Pd atoms in the
surface layer are dispersed instead of forming large Pd is-
lands imbedded in the surface layer. Third, why would
Pd embed itself in the surface layer rather than form islands
on top of the alloy?
These questions can be answered by performing energy
calculations with DFT and by using thermodynamics to-
gether with a simple model based on statistical mechanics.
The calculations reported here ﬁnd that, if the alloy is in
contact with vacuum, a Pd atom has the lowest energy
when it is located in the bulk. If CO is present in the gas-
phase it will bind to a Pd atom in the surface layer and this
increases the probability that Pd atoms segregate at the sur-
face. The Pd concentration in the surface layer depends
strongly on temperature and the partial pressure of CO. Fi-
nally, we ﬁnd that, within the errors of rPBE–GGA–DFT,
two Pd atoms in the surface layer or in the bulk do not
interact with each other. This explains the why Pd atoms
in the surface layer or in the bulk do not aggregate.
These results are relevant to Goodman’s experiments in
which the vibrational frequency of adsorbed CO was used
to infer the composition of the surface and the distribution
of Pd monomers and dimers on the surface. Our results are
consistent with the model he proposed. One may speculate
that under the inﬂuence of the acetic acid, ethylene and
oxygen the composition of the surface of the Pd/Au alloy
is similar to that found in the presence of CO.
2. Methodology
We have performed periodic Kohn–Sham calculations
[13–15] using the Vienna ab-initio simulation package
(VASP) [16–19] with the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof [20]
functional revised by Hammer, Hansen and Nørskov [21]
projector augmented-wave (PAW) [22,23] potentials opti-
mized for the PBE functional were used to represent the
eﬀective potential due to the ionic cores. The energy cutoﬀ
for the plane wave expansion was set to 400.0 eV. We used
the Methfessel–Paxton [24] method of order one with a
smearing of 0.2 eV to allow for partial occupancy near
the Fermi level. Dipole and quadrupole corrections to the
total energy were computed using a modiﬁed version of a
method due to Makov and Payne [25].
For the Au(111) slab we used a rectangular super-cell of
size 2

results in two unique k-points.
The atoms in the bottom layer of the slab were ﬁxed to
the bulk position and all other atoms were allowed to relax
to minimize the total energy. The minimization was per-
formed with a conjugate gradient algorithm. The bulk

3. Results
3.1. Isolated Pd atoms in the surface layer or in the bulk
We study slabs of Au having unreconstructed Au(111)
or Au(100) surfaces, in which we replace one or two Au
atoms with Pd atoms. To see if Pd prefers to be located
at the surface of the slab or in the bulk we calculated the
energy of a nine layer slab of Au in which one Au atom
was replaced by a Pd atom in the surface layer, or in an
interior layer. In Fig. 1 we show the total energy of the slab

with the Pd atom in the nth layer minus the total energy of
the slab when the Pd atom was in the ﬁfth layer below the
surface, as a function of n. The energy is highest when the
Pd atom is in the surface layer; as far as energy is con-
cerned, the Pd atoms prefer to be located in the bulk. En-
tropy will enhance this tendency since our ability to guess
the position of the Pd atom when it is in the bulk is lower
than when it is on the surface; thus there is less information
about the location of Pd when it is in the bulk, hence more
‘‘disorder’’, higher entropy, lower free energy [28].
Besides replacing an Au atom in the surface layer or in
the bulk, the Pd atom may also sit on top of the Au surface.
The energy required for removing the Pd atom from the
surface layer onto the surface and leaving a gold vacancy
behind is 1.33 eV for the (111) surface. Within the errors
of rPBE–GGA–DFT this energy is independent of the dis-
tance between the Pd atom on top of the surface and the
Au vacancy. The probability that Pd will leave a substitu-
tional site in the surface layer to move onto the surface is
very low.
3.2. Pd–Pd interaction
To ﬁnd whether the Pd atoms in the alloy have a ten-
dency to form Pd clusters we have calculated the energy
of two Pd atoms, each replacing a gold atom at diﬀerent
lattice sites. These sites can be in the top surface layer or
in the layer immediately beneath. The position of the Pd
atoms in the slab and the energies of the slabs are shown
in Fig. 2 (for the (111) surface) and Fig. 3 (for the (100)
surface). The zero of energy is the energy of the slab with
the two Pd atoms in the bulk, separated by a large distance
(Fig. 2k, for the (111) slab, and Fig. 3m, for the (100)
slab). It is diﬃcult to estimate the errors of rPBE–GGA–
DFT but they are certainly larger than the interaction
energies shown in Fig. 2. Therefore, within the errors of
rPBE–GGA–DFT, there is no interaction between the
two Pd atoms. For example, Fig. 2a–d show that the en-
ergy of two Pd atoms in the surface layer is independent
of the distance between them. The same story is told by
Fig. 2e–g in which one atom is in the surface layer and
the other in the layer underneath. The interaction energy
is negligible for all pairings of two Pd atoms.
The lack of interaction between the Pd atoms explains
why they do not form large Pd clusters, except perhaps
by accident. This result supports Goodman’s conjecture
that the system he was working had with monomers or
non-contiguous dimers (formed accidentally) and give cre-
dence to the assumption that this may be responsible for
the increased selectivity of the alloys having a low Pd
concentration.
3.3. The eﬀect of CO on Pd location
We have calculated the adsorption energy of CO on a
variety of Pd/Au alloy slabs (see Figs. 4–7). In Fig. 4 we

show the preferred binding sites (lowest energy) of CO to
an Au(111) slab with one Pd atom in the surface layer.
The adsorption energies given in the ﬁgure are deﬁned as
the energy of the slab with CO, minus the energy of the slab
without CO, minus the energy of a gas-phase CO molecule.
Clearly the CO molecule prefers to bind to the Pd atom in
the surface layer (binding energy = 1.28 eV). It also binds
to a surface Au atom when a Pd atom is in the sub-surface
layer (binding energy = 0.85 eV). The binding energy of
CO on all other sites is much smaller and the role of these
sites is ignored in what follows.
A similar situation is found for the binding of CO to the
(100) face of the alloy. When the Pd is in the surface layer
CO binds to it and the binding energy is 1.43 eV. A Pd
atom in the sub-surface layer induces Au to bind CO and
the binding energy is 1.02 eV. Obviously, when CO is

present in the gas-phase it will induce an accumulation of
Pd atoms in the surface layer. CO can also adsorb in a
bridge conﬁguration between two neighboring Pd atoms.
This conﬁguration has an adsorption energy of 1.34 eV.
Figs. 5 and 7 show that the energy of two Pd atoms,
each having a CO molecule adsorbed on it, is independent
of the Pd–Pd distance. This lack of interaction means that
the Pd atoms with CO on them are randomly distributed
on the surface lattice sites. CO adsorption will induce an
enrichment of Pd in the surface layer but it will not cause
the Pd atoms to form clusters.
We have also calculated the energy of CO adsorbed on a
Pd atom located on the top of an Au slab which has a gold
vacancy on the surface, and found it to be 0.97 eV higher
than the energy of CO adsorbed on a Pd atom imbedded
in the surface layer. We conclude that the presence of CO
in the gas-phase will not induce the Pd atoms to leave their
position in the surface layer and move to the surface.
4. A lattice–gas model for the distribution of the Pd atoms
between the surface layer and the interior of the slab
One often deﬁnes the probability that the Pd atom is at
the surface or in the bulk by using a Boltzmann factor. This
is correct at zero temperature and might be a useful quali-
tative criterion at higher temperature. However, this
approximation does not take into account the eﬀect of con-
ﬁgurational entropy and the eﬀect of the partial pressure of
CO in the gas. Obviously the latter is an important factor,
if there is no CO in the gas Pd prefers to be in the bulk,
while in the presence of the gas it will tend to accumulate
in the surface layer.
Given the fact that we can neglect Pd–Pd interactions it
is easy to use thermodynamics and statistical mechanics to
calculate the concentration of Pd in the surface layer and in
the bulk and its dependence on temperature and CO pres-
sure, for a system in thermal equilibrium.
To do this we consider three competing equilibria:
PdB $ PdS
ð1Þ
PdS þ COg $ PdCOS
ð2Þ
2PdS þ COg $ Pd2CO
ð3Þ
Here PdB is a Pd atom in the bulk and PdS is a Pd atom in
the surface layer. PdCOS is CO adsorbed on a Pd atom in
the surface layer, and Pd2CO is CO adsorbed in the bridge
conﬁguration on two Pd atoms. Pd2CO is not the ensemble
proposed by Goodman as the active site for the vinyl ace-
tate synthesis. Pd2CO involves two nearest-neighbors Pd
atoms whereas in the ensemble proposed by Goodman
the two Pd atoms are next-nearest-neighbors. The equilib-
rium PdCOs + COg M Pd2CO is not independent of the
ones considered above, because of material and lattice site
conservation conditions.
The equilibrium conditions are [29]
lB ¼ lS
ð4Þ
lCO þ lS ¼ lPdCO
ð5Þ
lCO þ 2lS ¼ lPd2CO
ð6Þ
Here lS, lCO, lB, lPdCO and lPd2CO are the chemical poten-
tials of the species PdS, gaseous CO, PdB, PdCOS and
Pd2CO, respectively. We use the following notation:

Eqs. (4)–(7) connect T, p, r, h, d, q, q0, and s. Of these, s is
determined when the shape and the size of the Pd/Au par-
ticle are speciﬁed, and q0 is determined when the alloy is
made. If we ﬁx T and p we can calculate r, h, d, and q from
Eqs. (4)–(6). We do this calculation for two diﬀerent sys-
tems. In one, we assume that the system is so large that
the migration of Pd to the surface hardly changes the bulk
composition. This means that we can take q = q0 and
ignore the conservation condition. Eqs. (4)–(6) can then
be used to calculate h, r, and d. A diﬀerent calculation is
performed for a nanoparticle whose surface per volume ra-
tio is such that when Pd migrates to the surface it depletes
signiﬁcantly the bulk concentration. In this case we ﬁx s
(we assume it to be equal to the ratio of the volume of a
thin shell around the surface to the volume of a sphere,
so that the only geometric parameter left is the radius of
the sphere) and calculate q, r, h and d from Eqs. (4)–(7),
to obtain the surface and bulk concentrations as a function
of temperature and CO pressure.
Assuming that an alloy nanoparticle is a sphere is a
crude approximation for a number of reasons. (1) Metallic
particles tend to facet and their shape depends on the gas
composition, alloy composition, pressure and temperature.
(2) The energy of a Pd atom in the surface layer changes
from facet to facet, diﬀerent facets are likely to have diﬀer-
ent Pd compositions. (3) The shape ﬂuctuates due to ther-
mal
motion
and
the
faceted
shape
predicted
by
thermodynamics (i.e. by the Wulf construction) is an aver-
age shape. (4) The shape of very small clusters can be very
diﬀerent from the compact structures observed in large par-
ticles. Therefore, the results obtained with this model for
the nanoparticle should be considered a semi-quantitative
illustration of a concept and a ﬁrst step towards realistic
description of nanoparticle surface composition. A better
description, which takes into account all the factors enu-
merated above, is possible but it would require an enor-
mous computation.
To implement this scheme we need to know the chemical
potentials. We use an ideal lattice–gas model [30] to calcu-
latelS, lB, lPdCO and lPd2CO. This is justiﬁed by the fact
that Pd atoms do not interact when the Pd concentration
is low. For lCO we use ideal gas theory [28]. The formulae
used in the calculation are given in the appendix. The cal-
culations can be easily performed by using Mathematica
(TM). For illustration we give a few results in Fig. 8.
In the absence of CO the energy is lower when the Pd
atom is inside the particle. Because of this, most of the
Pd atoms will avoid the surface, even at high temperature;
the Pd concentration in the surface layer or on the surface
will be extremely low. When CO is present the energy of a
Pd atom in the surface layer with a CO molecule on it, is
much smaller than that of a CO molecule in the gas-phase
and a Pd atom in the bulk. The presence of CO helps Pd
accumulate in the surface layer. This is true at the lower
end of the temperature range. As the temperature is in-
creased CO desorbs from Pd, and the Pd atoms move into
the bulk. Because of CO desorption, the amount of Pd at
the surface decreases with temperature, when the tempera-
ture exceeds 400 K. Even though a CO molecule adsorbed
in a bridge position between two neighboring Pd atoms has
lower adsorption energy than a CO molecule adsorbed on
top of a single Pd atom, the fraction of Pd2CO is very small
compared to the fraction of PdCO. The reason for this
behavior is that the system can lower its energy through
the ‘‘reaction’’
Pd2CO þ COg $ 2PdCOS
The behavior of the Pd surface concentration when the
size of the particle changes is more interesting. As we can
see in Fig. 8, at suﬃciently low temperature the PdCOS sur-
face concentration approaches one as the particle size in-
creases.

because at low overall Pd concentration there are not en-

There is no such limitation for a large particle. The size
where this depletion of the bulk occurs depends on the total
Pd concentration in the system. The lower this concentra-
tion, the larger the size for which deviations from the bulk
behavior are observed. Roughly, the radius where the tran-

of Pd atoms in the system is equal to the number of lattice
sites on the surface.
5. Summary and discussion
In the absence of gases Pd atoms have a strong tendency
to substitute Au atoms in the bulk. The presence of CO in
the gas-phase favors the presence of Pd in the top surface
layer. The interaction between the Pd atoms, with or with-
out CO on them, is very weak and they will not aggregate
to form Pd islands within the surface layer, nor will they
form Pd domains in the bulk. The lack of interaction be-
tween the Pd atoms makes it easy to provide simple equa-
tions that give the equilibrium composition at the surface
of a spherical nanoparticle, as a function of particle size,
net alloy composition, temperature, and CO pressure. Cal-
culations with these equations suggest that the ability of the
Pd/Au alloy to work as a selective catalyst is controlled by
the binding energy of the reactants to the Pd surface atom.
If these are too low to overcome the natural tendency of
the Pd atoms to move into the bulk, then there is hardly
any Pd on the surface and there is little Pd derived catalytic
activity. According to Goodman’s model the best selectiv-
ity is achieved when the surface has many clusters contain-
ing two next-nearest-neighbor Pd atoms and very few
larger clusters. Our model suggests that such clusters are
made at random, since the Pd–Pd interaction is too small
to overcome the tendency of the entropy to create a ran-
dom distribution. The reaction temperature also plays an
important role, if it is too high and the reactants desorb
from the Pd atom, the latter will have a tendency to go in-
side the bulk under reaction conditions. In this case the cat-
alyst will fail since Au does not catalyze vinyl acetate
formation.

In this calculation we made sure that all energies entering
in the partition functions were calculated with the same en-

tions of the slabs cancel in the equilibrium conditions.
For example, in the equilibrium PdS + COgas M PdCO it
is assumed that the vibrational contribution to the parti-
tion function of the PdS slab cancels the vibrational contri-
bution from the PdCO slab. However, the vibrational
contribution from the bending motion of PdCO is included
explicitly. For the conﬁgurational contribution to the par-
tition function of Pd2CO we use the Bethe approximation
discussed in references [31–33].

The function q0
PdCO is the vibrational partition function of
PdCO when we have the lattice ﬁxed. The function q0
CO is
the rotational and vibrational contribution of gas-phase
CO. The function q0
Pd2CO is the vibrational partition func-
tion of Pd2CO with the surface ﬁxed.
In addition to the equilibrium conditions, it is necessary
to conserve the number of Pd atoms as they distribute be-
tween the bulk and surface layer. This condition is given by
Eq. (7). Numerical solution of these four equations give us
the coverages and bulk Pd concentration in terms of the
CO pressure, temperature, molar fraction of Pd and parti-
cle size.
