Abstract
In this paper we use density functional theory corrected for on-site Coulomb interactions
(DFT + U) to study the defects formed in the ceria (111) and (110) surfaces doped with La. To
describe consistently the defect formed with substitutional La3+ doping at a Ce4+ site we use
DFT and DFT + U, with U = 5 eV for Ce 4f states and U = 7 eV for O 2p states. When La3+
substitutes on a Ce3+ site, an La′
Ce + O·
O defect state, with an oxygen hole, is formed at both
surfaces, but only with the DFT + U approach. The formation energy of an oxygen vacancy in
a structure with two La dopants in their most stable distribution is reduced over the undoped
surfaces but remains positive. Formation of an oxygen vacancy results in the appearance of a
reduced Ce3+ cation and a compensated oxygen hole, instead of compensation of both oxygen
holes, which is typical of metal oxides doped with lower valence cations. We tentatively suggest
that the key role in the formation of this unusual defect is played by cerium and arises from the
ease with which cerium can be reduced, as compared to other metal oxides. Experimental
conﬁrmation of these results is suggested.

1. Introduction
Cerium oxide (ceria) is of importance in a number of
ﬁelds, such as oxidation–reduction (redox) catalysis [1, 2],
intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells [3] and gas
sensing [4].
In each of these areas, the formation (and
migration) of oxygen vacancies plays a key role. Ceria already
has a relatively small oxygen vacancy formation energy, which
has its origin in the ease with which cerium can change
oxidation state from (formally) +4 to (formally) +3.
This
property of ceria makes it an active material in catalytic
reactions such as oxidation of CO to CO2 and reduction of
NOX to N2.
Nanostructures of ceria such as nanorods [5] and
nanoparticles [6] have been well studied in recent years and
there is some modelling work on nanoparticles of ceria. In
brief, the evidence is that the reactivity of a nanostructure
appears to depend on its shape—for the example of CO
oxidation, nanorods are more reactive than nanoparticles [7].
The origin for this lies in the crystal faces that are exposed on
these structures. Nanoparticles expose primarily (111) faces,
while nanorods expose primarily (110) faces. First principles
computations of CO adsorption at the (111) and (110) surfaces
(which are reasonable models of the exposed crystal faces in
the nanostructures) show that there is no interaction of CO with
the (111) surface and a strong interaction of CO at the (110)
surface [8–10]. The origin of the different relativities to CO
was attributed to the structure of the surface and the relative
oxygen vacancy formation energy [9].
Given that the (111) surface is the most stable surface
of bulk ceria [11] and is predominant in nanoparticles, it is
worth investigating how the reactivity of this surface can be
enhanced.
To brieﬂy recall, the oxygen vacancy formation
energies of the low index surfaces of ceria increase in the
order (110) < (100) < (111) [12] and thus lowering the
oxygen vacancy formation energy of ceria should be a means of
enhancing the reactivity. In fact, it is now clear that doping of
ceria with other metal cations is one potentially fruitful means
of achieving this enhancement [13–18]. Recent experimental
work has shown that many metal dopants enhance the oxygen
vacancy formation energy and reactivity of ceria. In parallel,
there have been a number of modelling studies of metal

doping of ceria bulk and surfaces, which also show a reduced
oxygen vacancy formation energy [19–25].
In [19, 25] the
authors provided explanations for the reduction in the vacancy
formation energy of ceria upon doping.
While trivalent rare earths such as Eu3+ have recently been
shown to enhance the oxidation of CO to CO2 [17], there has
been relatively little work on La doping of ceria [17, 26]. In
this paper, we apply ﬁrst principles density functional theory,
corrected for on-site Coulomb interactions (DFT+U) [27, 28],
to study La doping of ceria.
In the modelling, we study
La doping of the (111) and (110) ceria surfaces. The (111)
surface is by far the most well studied surface of ceria and
is predominantly present in nanoparticles [6], while (110) is
the more reactive surface [12] and is present on structures
such as nanorods [5].
The DFT + U approach has been
shown to provide a consistent treatment of reduced Ce ions
in ceria, e.g. [11, 12, 29, 30]. In this approach, the value of
U must be somehow chosen; our earlier work arrived at U =
5 eV, based on comparison of the photoemission spectrum of
reduced ceria [31] and the computed density of states [10]
and we choose it for this work. We show that localized hole
formation in La-doped ceria needs to be described by DFT+U,
with U on O 2p states (to be elaborated upon in the following
sections) and that oxygen vacancy formation does not lead to
hole compensation, but instead to formation of reduced Ce3+
simultaneously present with an oxygen hole in the surface.
2. Computational methods
We use a slab model of the ceria (111) and (110) surfaces
and a plane wave basis set to describe the valence electronic
wave functions with the VASP code [32].
The cut-off
for the kinetic energy is 396 eV. For the core–valence
interaction we apply Bl¨
ochl’s projector augmented wave
(PAW) approach [33]. For Ce, we use 12 valence electrons,
for La 11 valence electrons and for O a [He] core.
We
use the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE) approximation for the
exchange–correlation functional [34]. In common with earlier
studies [10, 11, 29, 30], we use density functional theory
(DFT) corrected for on-site Coulomb interactions (DFT + U),
where U Ce4f = 5 eV and is applied to the Ce 4f states. The
details of this approach and our choice of U are discussed
extensively in [10, 11]. k-point sampling is performed using
the Monkhorst–Pack scheme, with a (2×2×1) sampling grid.
The (111) surface is type II (in the Tasker classiﬁcation)
with neutral, stoichiometric O–Ce–O units along the slab and
no dipole moment is present upon cleaving [35], while the
(110) surface is of type I, with neutral CeO2 planes along
the slab. For the (111) surface, we use a (4 × 4) expansion
of the surface supercell in which one dopant gives an overall
doping level of 1.6% with a 3.2% doping concentration for
two La dopants. For the (110) surface, a (4 × 2) expansion
of the surface cell is used, in which one dopant gives an overall
doping level of 1.8% for one La dopant and 3.6% for two La
dopants. Formation of one oxygen vacancy gives an overall
oxygen vacancy concentration of 0.8% in the (111) surface
and 0.9% in the (110) surface. The slab models are 4 O–Ce–
O layers (11.5 ˚
A) thick for (111) and 7CeO2 layers (11.5 ˚
A)
thick for (110), with a 15 ˚
A vacuum gap and the bottom two
layers were ﬁxed during the relaxations. All calculations are
spin polarized with no restrictions on the overall spin.
It is well known that substituting an Mn+ cation in a metal
oxide with a lower valence M(n−1)+ cation results in formation
of a localized electronic hole on an oxygen atom neighbouring
the dopant [36–43]. This electronic hole gives rise to issues
with the description of the resulting electronic structure using
DFT, which we, for example, have discussed in detail for Li-
doped MgO and Si-doped Al2O3 [44, 45]; see also [46, 47] for
detailed treatments of the latter system and discussions of this
problem.
In the present example, substitution of Ce4+ with La3+
results in formation of an La/
Ce + O·
O defect centre, with an
oxygen hole, formed by occupation of one O 2p orbital with
one electron (rather than two electrons) or formation of two
La/
Ce +O·
O centres compensated by an oxygen vacancy. For the
example of Li-doped MgO [44] and Al-doped SiO2 [45], we
previously demonstrated that the description of these defects
using DFT+U, with U applied to the O 2p states, is consistent
with experiment.
The choice of U O 2p is 7 eV, which can
also be arrived at from experiment [48].
In addition, with
U = 7 eV on O 2p states in MgO, we have found that oxygen
vacancies compensate the electronic holes [49], giving further
conﬁdence in using this approach for these doped systems. For
comparison, we also present some calculations with no U on
oxygen.
To see the impact of using DFT + U on oxygen 2p states,
we discuss brieﬂy how thermodynamics are inﬂuenced. Firstly,
we consider the binding energy of the O2 molecule, which
is notoriously difﬁcult to describe accurately with DFT [50].
Indeed we ﬁnd that with no U on O 2p, the O2 binding energy
is overestimated by 1.4 eV. With U = 7 eV on O 2p, the
computed binding energy of 4.91 eV is rather close to the
experimental data, which show a range of 5.08–5.16 eV [50].
Thus, the use of U on O 2p states can be expected to be
suitable for thermodynamics.
For the oxides, we compute
the formation energy of CeO2 to be −11.84 eV, which is in
reasonable agreement with experimental data [1, 51].
The
formation energy of one oxygen vacancy in the (110) surface
used in this paper is computed to be 1.18 eV, which compares
with 1.58 eV for no U on oxygen. As we have discussed in [11]
and [45], we ﬁnd that DFT + U tends to give energies, such as
oxygen vacancy formation energies, that are around 0.3–0.4 eV
lower than DFT and our result here is quite consistent with this.
The formation energy of an oxygen vacancy in doped ceria
is given by (for the example of the (111) surface)
Evac = [E(La0.016Ce1.984O1.992) + E(1/2O2)]
−E(La0.016Ce1.984O2)
(1)
E2vac = [E(La0.016Ce1.984O1.984) + E(1/2O2)]
−E(La0.016Ce1.984O1.992)
(2)
with the dopant and vacancy concentrations calculated from
the subscripts on La and O in (1) and (2); the latter equation
is for formation of two oxygen vacancies. The energy of O2
is computed using U O 2p = 7 eV for those calculations in
which U O 2p is used on the oxide. Throughout this paper, a
negative energy signiﬁes that formation of an oxygen vacancy
is favourable.

3. Results and discussion
3.1. The atomic structure of La-doped ceria surfaces
We
begin
by
describing
the
atomic
structure
of
the
ceria (111) and (110) surfaces with the introduction of
one La dopant.
The supplemental information (available
at stacks.iop.org/JPhysCM/22/135004/mmedia) provides the
atomic coordinates of various doped structures presented in
this paper.
In the undoped (111) surface, the surface Ce–
O distances are equivalent (2.36 ˚
A), and subsurface Ce–O
distances are similar to bulk. This surface is the most stable
ceria surface and undergoes little relaxation; the stability of
the (111) surface is the origin of its relative lack of reactivity
compared to other ceria surfaces, such as (110), e.g. for CO
adsorption [8].
The (110) surface has stoichiometric CeO2
plane along the slab and the in surface layer, Ce–O distances
are 2.34 and 2.32 ˚
A to the ﬁrst subsurface layer.
The geometry of the La-doped CeO2(111) surface is
shown for a region around the dopant in ﬁgure 1(a) for a
calculation with no U on oxygen and in ﬁgure 1(b) for a
calculation with U O 2p on oxygen. The La–O distances are
given in each ﬁgure. There is an immediate difference between
the two computational approaches in terms of the geometry.
With no U on oxygen, there are two sets of La–O distances,
three at 2.36 ˚
A and another three at 2.37 ˚
A; the former La–
O distances involve terminating surface oxygen atoms and the
latter distances involve subsurface oxygen atoms and both are
rather similar to the Ce–O distances in the surface. Thus, the
La–O distances are quite uniform. However, with U O 2p, there
is a notable distortion present. The La–O distances to terminal
oxygen atoms elongate to 2.52 ˚
A, while to subsurface oxygen
atoms, the La–O distances are 2.46 ˚
A. These La–O distances
are substantially elongated compared to the Ce–O distances
in the undoped surface, with the stronger elongation to the
terminal oxygen atoms.
In the La-doped (110) surface, similar differences between
the DFT approaches are found. With no U on oxygen, there
are 4 La–O distances of 2.48 ˚
A involving surface O and two of
2.34/2.35 ˚
A. The presence of the large La ion forces longer
cation–O distances in the vicinity of the dopant.
With U

on oxygen, there is a strong distortion—there is one strongly
elongated surface La–O distance of 2.61 ˚
A and another at
2.51 ˚
A; the remaining two surface La–O distances are reduced
to 2.38/2.39 ˚
A, consistent with the La cation moving away
from one pair of surface oxygen atoms, thus shortening the
distance to the other pair of surface oxygen atoms.
3.2. Electronic structure of La-doped CeO2 surfaces
To investigate the destination of the oxygen hole, we plot the
excess spin density (difference between up and down spin
electron density) in both La-doped surfaces in ﬁgure 2. Upon
comparing the spin density for either surface with no U on
oxygen and with U on oxygen, there is an immediate difference
between the two descriptions. With no U on oxygen, the hole
is delocalized over terminal and subsurface oxygen atoms of
the surface, with computed spin magnetizations of 0.01–0.05
electrons on oxygen, with the largest spin magnetization on
oxygen nearest the dopant. With U O 2p, the spin density is
strongly localized on one surface terminating oxygen near the
dopant, with computed spin magnetizations of 0.93 electrons
on the (111) surface and 0.95 electrons on the (110) surface,
with a very small spin density on some neighbouring oxygen
atoms. On both surfaces, the hole is localized on an oxygen
atom with the longest surface La–O distance, 2.52 ˚
A on (111)
and 2.61 ˚
A on (110). The predominant localization of the hole
on one oxygen atom near the dopant is consistent with the
behaviour for other similar systems [36–47].
The partial electronic density of states (PEDOS) projected
on O 2p states for the oxygen atom that carries the electronic
hole for the example of La-doped CeO2(111) with U on O 2p is
shown in ﬁgure 3. In the PEDOS we see ﬁrstly that there are no
Ce 4f derived gap states in the band gap, conﬁrming no reduced
Ce3+ ions are present. Secondly, the PEDOS shows two peaks
of signiﬁcance. The ﬁrst is 4.5 eV below the Fermi level, in
the valence band region, and the second is at 1.3 eV above the
Fermi level (set at 0 eV). This is consistent with the formation
of a localized O−species; a delocalized O−species shows a
very different PEDOS structure. Based on previous work on
Li-doped MgO [52], it could be possible to use electron energy
loss spectroscopy to establish the position of the oxygen hole
in the electronic structure. Throughout the remainder of this
paper we will work with the DFT + U approach with U on
oxygen.

is the classical defect compensation mechanism, is more

stable than the uncompensated defect, we investigate two 2La
dopants incorporated into the ceria surfaces and the formation
of an oxygen vacancy.
For two La dopants at each surface, there are a number
of possible distributions.
For the (111) surface, the La–La
distribution shown in ﬁgure 4(a), in which the dopants are
separated by 6.70 ˚
A, is the most stable. For the (110) surface,
the La–La distribution in ﬁgure 4(b), in which the dopants are
separated by 5.47 ˚
A, is the most stable. The geometry around
the dopants on each surface is similar to the case for a single
La dopant. At the (111) surface, this gives La–O distances
of 2.52 ˚
A to terminal oxygen atoms and 2.46 ˚
A to subsurface
oxygen atoms. On the (110) surface, this results in two surface
La–O distances of 2.60 ˚
A and 2.50 A to one pair of surface
oxygen atoms (very similar to one La dopant in the surface)
and two surface La–O distances of 2.41 ˚
A.
The spin density plots in ﬁgure 5, computed with U on
oxygen, show prominent localization of the two oxygen holes
at two oxygen atoms, each coordinated to one dopant. The
computed spin magnetizations are 0.93 electrons per oxygen
on (111) and 0.94 electrons per oxygen on (110). Again, these
are the surface oxygen atoms with the longest La–O distances.
In essence, these dopant distributions provide two isolated La
dopants and oxygen holes.
Next, we remove an oxygen atom from these dopant
structures
and
compute
the
oxygen
vacancy
formation
energy—if this quantity is negative, then the vacancy forms
to compensate the dopants, otherwise, the stable defect is the
La′
Ce + O·
O hole. The main oxygen sites that are considered for
the vacancy in the (111) surface are shown in ﬁgure 6, along
with their computed oxygen vacancy formation energies. All
oxygen vacancies show an energy cost, while that of dopant–
vacancy distribution I is the lowest, at 0.90 eV. These energies
do indicate that an oxygen vacancy will not necessarily form
to compensate for the formation of the electronic hole state. At
the same time, a formation energy of 0.90 eV is much reduced
over the undoped surface (computed to be 2.60 eV [12])
and suggests that formation of this oxygen vacancy will be
enhanced over the undoped surface.
Figure 7(a) shows the geometry around the vacancy site
for the most stable oxygen vacancy on the (111) surface, with
the vacancy indicated by a black ‘V’. Similar to the undoped
(111) surface, formation of a surface oxygen vacancy results
in a breaking of the hexagonal symmetry of the terminating
oxygen and the hexagon (with two surface Ce and one La
dopant) is now distorted. The Ce–O distances in the hexagon
are 2.31 ˚
A to surface oxygen and 2.29 ˚
A to subsurface oxygen.
There is a shortening of the La–O distances to 2.46 ˚
A to surface
oxygen and no change in the La–O distances to subsurface
oxygen.
On the (110) surface, the most stable oxygen vacancy
site is shown in ﬁgure 7(c); the missing oxygen atom was
coordinated to La and there is an energy cost of 0.64 eV
to form this vacancy, which is strongly reduced over the
undoped surfaces. In this structure, the surface oxygen atoms
neighbouring the vacancy site move towards the vacancy,
distorting the structure around the vacancy site and shortening
the surface La–O distances to 2.33–2.32 ˚
A.
Surface Ce–O
distances around the vacancy site are now similar to those in
the undoped surface, suggesting that vacancy formation has
released some of the distortions present in the surface after La
doping.
Figures 7(b) and (d) show the resulting spin density for the
oxygen vacancy structures. The most stable spin magnetization
is with an excess of two up spin electrons, and the spin density
plot reﬂects this. The spin density on both surfaces shows one
electronic hole on a surface oxygen atom near one La dopant
and, unexpectedly, a reduced subsurface Ce3+ ion near the

Ce3+ ion on the (110) surface. This reduced Ce3+ species has
an elongated Ce–O distance of 2.44 ˚
A to the nearest subsurface
oxygen and a small elongation of other Ce–O distances to
2.38 ˚
A on the (111) surface. The presence of the Ce3+ ion
in the subsurface layer on the (111) surface is consistent with
recent results on oxygen vacancy formation on the undoped
surface [53].

I Yeriskin and M Nolan
The ﬁnding that oxygen vacancy formation on ceria
surfaces doped with La results in formation of Ce3+ and an
oxygen hole seems at ﬁrst surprising, since it is generally
accepted that the formation of an oxygen vacancy defect
compensates an aliovalent dopant with a lower oxidation state;
for example, in Li-doped MgO (even with U = 7 eV on O
2p states), oxygen vacancy formation always compensates the
two electronic holes [49]. For TiO2 Islam et al showed that
an Al dopant is compensated with an oxygen vacancy [54]. A
UV–visible spectroscopy study of TiO2 substitutionally doped
with Al found that oxygen vacancies compensate the oxygen
hole [55]. On the basis of the limited experimental information
and the results in [54], it was concluded that Al-doped TiO2
will be found with oxygen vacancies. A further experimental
example is trivalent doped zirconia in [41] and [42], where
oxygen vacancies are found to compensate the oxygen hole
introduced by the dopant. In these examples, we see that hole
compensation is favoured over cation reduction, even though
TiO2 is considered a reducible oxide. We suggest that new
experiments are needed to study this area is more detail.
With no experimental information available to compare
with our ﬁndings, we tentatively suggest that our results can be
best understood when we consider the nature of the host oxide.
In MgO, Mg is not reducible upon formation of an oxygen
vacancy and forms instead F-centres, which are localized at the
vacancy site. Upon doping with Li, the formation of an oxygen
vacancy will not reduce Mg and results in hole compensation.
Similarly, Zr in zirconia is not easily reducible and oxygen
vacancy formation is trivalent doped zirconia will not reduce
the Zr cation. The few experimental data for Al-doped TiO2
suggest that Ti reduction is less favourable than compensation
of the oxygen hole.
Cerium however is more easily reduced compared to the
oxides listed above, and formation of an oxygen vacancy (with
an appropriate value of U on Ce, as in the present paper) results
in formation of reduced Ce3+. In the absence of experimental
information on this aspect of La-doped ceria, we tentatively
propose that the energetics of cerium reduction mean that upon
oxygen vacancy formation, it is favourable to reduce one Ce4+
ion to Ce3+ and compensate one oxygen hole, rather than
compensate both electronic holes as in other oxides. Thus we
propose that the key role in determining the defects formed
upon La doping of ceria is played by the cerium cation. The
remaining vacancy distributions that we considered show the
same behaviour. Experimental work to elucidate the nature of
the oxidation states of Ce and O in La-doped CeO2 would be
valuable to test these ﬁndings.
4. Conclusions
When the (111) and (110) ceria surfaces are doped with La,
the most stable defect is La′
Ce + O·
O with an oxygen hole. The
formation of an oxygen hole is conﬁrmed from structural and
electronic data. We compute that the energy required to form
an oxygen vacancy in this structure is at least 0.90 eV on (111)
and 0.64 eV on (110), which is small enough that vacancy
formation will be enhanced over the undoped surface and under
favourable temperature and conditions, reduced Ce3+ ions can
be present. Perhaps the most interesting ﬁnding is that oxygen
vacancy formation does not compensate the electronic holes,
but instead compensates one hole and produces one Ce3+ ion,
so that both electronic holes and Ce3+ ions can be present in
La-doped ceria.
