First-principles calculations based on cluster models have been performed to investigate the ground state and the optically excited states of the

hole in
α
-quartz and in the siliceous zeolite ZSM-5. The structure and spectroscopic properties of this defect have been studied using the recently developed Becke88–Becke95 one-parameter model for kinetics (BB1K) functional of Zhao et al, [J. Phys. Chem. A 108, 2715 (2004)]. Our results show that the BB1K method is significantly more reliable and more accurate than the standard density-functional theory (DFT) functionals at reproducing the localized spin density on one oxygen atom and the hyperfine coupling constants associated with the hole. Furthermore, we find that the BB1K results are in close agreement with experiments, and with the self-interaction-free unrestricted Hartree–Fock (UHF) and unrestricted second-order Møller–Plesset perturbation theory (UMP2) calculations. For the first time, we present results of the ground-state paramagnetic properties of the Al defect in ZSM-5. Similar to the theoretical work for defective
α
-quartz, we find that the BB1K, UHF, UHF∕Lee–Yang–Parr, and UMP2 calculations show a localized hole on one oxygen neighboring the Al, while even the best to date thermochemically derived hybrid generalized gradient approximation density-functional, B97-2, predicts a different model where the hole is distributed over two oxygen. We have further considered the optical transitions of the

center in
α
-quartz and ZSM-5. In both systems, our BB1K time-dependent density-functional theory (TDDFT) and configuration interaction singles (CIS) calculations predict that the most likely transition involves electron transfer from the hole-bearing oxygen to other neighboring oxygen ions. This reinforces the experimental conclusions obtained for defective
α
-quartz. Notably, the two lowest, most dominant excitation energies calculated by BB1K-TDDFT (1.99 and 3.03 eV) show excellent agreement with experiment (1.96 and 2.85 eV [B. K. Meyer, J.M. Spaeth, and J.A. Weil, J. Phys. C: Solid State Phys. 17, L31 (1987)]) clearly outperforming the CIS method and other DFT calculations available in the literature.

I. INTRODUCTION
Structural defects in microporous aluminosilicates (zeolites) have been the subject of many experimental studies, and are generally considered as the key source of their catalytic activity.1 One of the most important defects in natural and synthetic zeolites is the substitution of
Al
3
+
for
Si
4
+
⁠. The resulting charge imbalance can be compensated for either by extra-framework cations (e.g.,
Li
+
⁠,
Na
+
⁠, or
K
+
⁠) or by a proton, which bonds to an oxygen adjacent to the aluminum center, giving rise to Brønsted acid sites. Upon hydrothermal synthesis, steaming and calcination of zeolites in an oxidizing atmosphere, and maybe assisted by
γ
-irradiation, these Brønsted sites can undergo a series of transformations, yielding a rich variety of defect species.
It has been accepted that the proton transfer of Brønsted sites is primarily responsible for the catalytic role of zeolites in commercial processes such as cracking, isomerization, and alkylation of hydrocarbons.1,2 Owing to their relevance in many industrial processes, the formation, structure, and acidity of Brønsted sites have been the subject of many studies.3 As a result, the Brønsted sites are well characterized. However, their transformation into other defect species has been studied to a lesser extent, and their existence is still a matter of debate. In particular, there has been no unambiguous experimental evidence of trigonal Al sites, which are thought to be strong electron acceptors (i.e., Lewis acid sites) resulting from the dehydroxylation of Brønsted sites. In contrast, complementary neutral
[

0
defect centers have been identified by their electron paramagnetic-resonance (EPR) signature.4,5 The EPR signal has been attributed to a hole trapped in a nonbonding orbital of an O next to the Al center. These defects are considered to form from Brønsted centers, in which the H atom is removed by irradiation or by radical guest molecules in catalysis. Thus similar to other silica materials, Al in zeolites is responsible for the large variety of both diamagnetic and paramagnetic defects and their complexes.6–8 In natural minerals, cationic species can play an important role of charge compensators to the
[

−
defect (see Ref. 9, and references therein). For example, the analysis of the relationship between cations and
[
AlO
4
]
defects in
α
-quartz, the main dense silica polymorph under ambient conditions, has allowed Itoh et al.10 to put forward a convincing theory of blue luminescence (see also Ref. 11).
Several studies have tried to characterize the structure and properties of the
[
AlO
4
]
0
defect by computational means,12,13 but the results using conventional approaches have failed to reproduce the EPR experiments. Here, we readdress the problem paying particular attention to methodological issues. The main challenge is the localization of the hole states which, according to EPR, should reside on one oxygen adjacent to the Al, whereas previous calculations distribute it over all four neighboring oxygen.12 The analogous defect in
α
-quartz has been recently scrutinized by Pacchioni et al.,14 who also reported the failure of the commonly employed density-functional theory (DFT) techniques. Very recently, Solans-Monfort et al.15 reached a similar conclusion for the same defect in the zeolite ZSM-5. The authors investigated two density functionals, namely, the conventional B3LYP (Becke’s three-parameter hybrid functional using the Lee–Yang–Parr correlation functional) (known to perform well for problems of thermochemistry) and BH&HLYP (Becke's half-and–half hybrid functional using the Lee–Yang–Parr correlation functional) (known to produce good optical excitation energies for small molecules). Only the latter functional compared favorably with more accurate ab initio calculations and experiment in the reproduction of the experimentally observed localized hole structure.
Drawing on our previous experiences and the work of Pacchioni et al., we have performed a new investigation of the
[
AlO
4
]
0
defect using a number of theoretical methods, with special focus on a new hybrid exchange-correlation functional BB1K (Becke88–Becke95 one-parameter model for kinetics).16 In addition to the ground state, we have performed time-dependent density-functional-theory (TDDFT) and configuration interaction singles (CIS) calculations to investigate the excited-state properties of the defect in
α
-quartz and in ZSM-5, a zeolite used in many industrially important catalytic processes.2 
The remainder of this paper is structured as follows: in Sec. II, we give a brief review of the experimental work that has been performed on the
[
AlO
4
]
0
center in silica materials. In Sec. III, we introduce structural models and theoretical methods used in this work. In Sec. IV, the results are reported in two parts. First, a validation of the BB1K functional is performed on the extensively studied Al-doped
α
-quartz system. In particular, we report the spin-density distribution and the hyperfine interactions of the paramagnetic defects associated with the Al center, and identify the optical absorption bands due to the defect. Next, we proceed to study this defect in ZSM-5, since the best EPR evidence for zeolites has so far been obtained for this system. Furthermore, we have compared the structure and properties of the
[
AlO

]
0
defect in the two silica systems, which has allowed us to not only validate the theoretical approaches but also to make predictions of the defect properties in zeolites.
II. EXPERIMENTAL BACKGROUND
Defect centers in zeolites are often paramagnetic, and therefore have been detected by EPR spectroscopy, in combination with other techniques. In the early 1960s, Stamires and Turkevich4,5 investigated the effect of
γ
-irradiation of synthetic zeolites with charge-compensating
Na
+
ions and protons at room temperature. Two types of EPR signals were obtained. For Na–
X
and Na–
Y
zeolites, a single line was recorded with a 0.0177 shift of the spectroscopic factor
g
from the free spin value of 2.0023. The rather large positive shift and the absence of a hyperfine structure suggest that the paramagnetic center is a hole, positioned presumably next to naturally abundant
O
16
and
Si
28
atoms, since neither has any nuclear magnetic moments. In the case of irradiated H–
Y
zeolite, a more thermally stable six-line EPR signal with a corresponding
g
factor of 2.0017 was observed. The appearance of the hyperfine splitting has been attributed to the interaction of a trapped electron hole with
Al
27
⁠, having a nuclear moment of
5
∕
2
⁠. The authors further postulated that at high temperatures dehydration of two adjacent Brønsted sites occurs, and as a result two complementary paramagnetic defects are formed: (i) an
[
AlO
4
]
0
center, with an electron hole localized on oxygen at the dehydrogenated Brønsted site and, (ii) an oxygen vacancy next to a trigonal Al, with an electron trapped on a Si site, giving rise to an
E
′
center4 (see Fig. 1). In a similar study, Abou-Kais et al.17 examined the EPR spectrum of the irradiated H–
Y
zeolite, but at a lower temperature of 77 K. In addition to the presence of a doublet due to H atoms trapped in zeolite pores, the spectrum also displayed a broad signal with a partially resolved six-line hyperfine structure. The authors demonstrated that the broad signal is composed of two separate contributions, which are due to different defect centers,
V
1
and
V
2
⁠. Both
V
centers were attributed to holes in the nonbonding
p
orbital of an O atom bonded either to an Al and a Si atom
(
V
1
)
or to two Si atoms
(
V
2
)
⁠, as shown in Fig. 2. However, since Si atoms have no nuclear spin, the authors proposed that only
V
1
centers, which are the
[
AlO
4
]
0
defects mentioned above, are responsible for the hyperfine pattern. It was concluded that the
V
centers are formed by the ejection of one electron from the
p
z
orbital of an O atom. Consequently, the ejected electrons can bind to the proton from the Brønsted site giving rise to H atoms, as observed by their EPR signatures. These H atoms can either be trapped in the zeolite cavities or recombine with the
V
1
centers. Shih18 investigated the EPR spectrum for another zeolite,
γ
-irradiated H–ZSM-5, and proposed that only
V
1
centers are present. Vedrine and Naccache19 found that the
V
1
and
V
2
signals disappeared immediately after irradiated H–
Y
and H–
Z
zeolites were exposed to molecular
O
16
under vacuum, and new EPR signals were observed instead. It has been suggested that the
V
centers are passivated by molecular oxygen, giving rise to a dioxygen species bound to an
[
AlO
4
]
0
defect. In the same study, the experiments were also conducted with
O
17
-enriched oxygen with nuclear spin
1
2
⁠, which gave a more complex spectrum than experiments performed with
O
16
having no nuclear spin. The hyperfine pattern in the spectrum consisted of two sets of six hyperfine lines, which were attributed to the unequal coupling of the unpaired electron of a
V
center with each of the two unpaired electrons of molecular
O
17
⁠. Furthermore, no isomorphous exchange between
O
17
and the lattice O was observed. More recently, Wichterlová et al.20 reported another defect in
γ
-irradiated H–ZSM-5 and H–
Y
zeolites, where the hole is localized at an O atom bonded between two Al atoms, one located in the zeolite framework, and the other in an extra-framework position. It was concluded that O holes predominately form between Al atoms at 298 K, while O holes located between an Al and a Si form at a lower temperature of 77 K. So far, these authors have produced the most reliable EPR data on hole centers in zeolites. In this present work, we compare their experimental data with our corresponding theoretical results.

It should be noted, however, that the experimental analysis of paramagnetic centers associated with trapped holes in zeolites is still incomplete. In particular, the unresolved and weak EPR signals observed by many of these studies have created much uncertainty when attempting to elucidate the anisotropic parameters in the hyperfine matrices. The poor resolution of these spectra has been attributed to two factors: (i) the use of polycrystalline zeolites, which are commonly formed in the hydrothermal synthesis of these materials, and (ii) the inherent disorder due to the openness of zeolites to guest species (e.g., water, extra-framework cation, etc.). To improve the resolution of the spectra, single-crystal zeolites with high silica content can be used; however, these crystals are much more difficult to synthesize.
In general, zeolites with compositions approaching that of pure silica are mainly built of a network of corner sharing
SiO
4
tetrahedra, which is commonly found in many silicate materials. Interestingly, localized hole centers in materials such as amorphous and impurity-doped crystalline
SiO
2
were discovered before zeolites, and have since been well documented. For example, in amorphous
SiO
2
⁠, Griscom21 found two types of localized hole centers. One of these centers has a hole localized at one O site, while the other has a hole localized on two neighboring O atoms.
Although trapping of holes in pure crystalline
SiO
2
such as
α
-quartz has not been observed, there is abundant evidence of this occurring in metal-doped
α
-quartz, particularly with Al. In 1954, Griffiths et al.22 first observed that irradiated samples of natural and synthetic quartz crystals have a dark coloration (“smoky quartz”) at 77 K, which disappears when heated to around 623 K. The EPR spectrum found in smoky quartz shows a complex hyperfine structure from
Al
27
⁠. According to O’Brien,23 the main features of the spectrum are attributed to a hole center which has become trapped at an O next to the Al site. Later work has suggested that the unpaired hole can be trapped at two different types of oxygen around Al. This was explained by analyzing the local symmetry around the Si site in silica
α
-quartz, which can be described as a slightly distorted tetrahedron of
C
2
symmetry. As a consequence, oxygen can bind to the tetrahedral site with an impurity at two different bond distances. The two Si–O bond distances vary only slightly, with equilibrium distances of 1.6145 and 1.6101 Å. For convenience, these oxygen atoms, which are long bonded and short bonded to the Si atom, are referred to as O1 and O2, respectively. Schnadt and Schneider24 reported that if the hole is trapped at one of the oxygen long bonded to Al, then the hole is in its ground state. The same authors determined, through EPR measurements, that a relatively small energy of 0.030 eV can thermally excite the hole to one of the short-bonded oxygen. In a later EPR study, a remeasurement of the excited-state energy yielded 0.042 eV.25 Consequently, in addition to the signals observed for the ground-state center, another six signals corresponding to the excited state were detected by EPR. Measurements taken from cross-relaxation and dielectric loss experiments26 have provided evidence that in its ground state, the hole can hop back and forth between two oxygen sites. At elevated temperatures, the hole can rapidly hop between all four adjacent oxygen, and behave like a small bound polaron.
The exposure to irradiation, such as
γ
-rays, of crystalline quartz gives rise to a number of optical absorption bands. In the past, there has been considerable debate over which optical absorption bands are associated with the
[
AlO

]
0
center. Early investigations proposed that three peaks observed at 1.85 eV
(
A
1
)
⁠, 2.55 eV
(
A
2
)
⁠, and 2.85 eV
(
A
3
)
are attributed to the smoky coloration in quartz due to the substitutional Al center. At that time the absorption bands were assigned to transitions of the hole from its ground
p
state to excited
p
states at the same paramagnetic
O
−
ion. However, it was later shown that the smoky color of quartz is associated with the
A
3
band and not with the
A
1
and
A
2
bands, as initially stated. This is based on the observations that the
A
1
and
A
2
bands are present without any smoky coloration being evident, and also on further irradiation the smoky color correlates with the intensity of the
A
3
band only. Schirmer27 also argued that the
A
3
band is attributed to a light-induced hole transfer from one O to an equivalent one. More recently, optically detected magnetic-resonance measurements identified a second peak originating from this paramagnetic center, positioned at 1.98 eV.28 This weaker and narrower peak was interpreted as due to a charge-transfer transition of the hole from the ion
O
−
adjacent to
Al
3
+
to an
O
2
−
in the next shell.
Early EPR spectra of
[

center in
α
-quartz only allowed
Al
27
hyperfine matrices to be determined, hence providing indirect evidence that the trapped hole in
[

is primarily located on O. More recently, Nuttall and Weil29,30 have measured the interaction of the unpaired electron with the
O
17
and
Si
29
nuclei, in addition to
Al
27
⁠, which confirmed the
[

model. Furthermore, the EPR spectrum was fitted to the spin Hamiltonian, which yielded

0.87

contributions to the spin orbital from O
2
s
and

orbitals, respectively. It has been concluded that the electron hole is trapped in an oxygen nonbonding
p
orbital almost perpendicular to the Al–O–Si plane, with no admixture of any other orbitals.
III. COMPUTATIONAL METHOD
Previous studies have shown that the experimental model of an Al impurity center in
α
-quartz can be correctly reproduced by electronic structure methods, provided that a proper treatment of electron exchange is performed.14,31,32 In particular, molecular cluster calculations14 have demonstrated that methods based on the unrestricted Hartree–Fock (UHF) approach which includes exact exchange but no correlation effects, and unrestricted second-order Møller–Plesset perturbation theory (UMP2) which takes into account the correlation effects explicitly, are in good agreement with the experimental observation of the hole being localized on one of the oxygen furthest from Al. On the other hand, standard DFT methods, which approximate the electron exchange and correlation effects through the exchange-correlation density functional, fail to describe the localized behavior of the single hole electron in the defect.14,31–34 Pure DFT and even hybrid DFT methods, where a mixture of HF exchange and DF exchange correlation is present, predict that the hole is delocalized over four or two O atoms, respectively. This incorrect picture of the delocalized hole has been attributed to the nonexact treatment of the electron exchange, which results in the incomplete self-interaction cancellation. In spite of this, the DFT approximation offers a considerable improvement in accuracy over the HF approximation for such properties as the energetic of reactions and the bond dissociations, while at the same time being more computationally efficient than the post-HF methods such as MP2. In this section, we begin by reviewing the recent developments of the functionals in DFT, and our choice of density functionals used in this work. This is followed by a description of the molecular cluster models that we have used to study hole localization in silicate systems. We then focus on the calculation of spectroscopic features, with special attention to the hyperfine coupling constants (HCCs) and the optical transitions associated with the hole defect.
A. Choice of density functionals
In DFT, the total energy is a nonlocal functional of the charge density
ρ
and the spin density
σ
⁠. As the exact form of the functional is unknown, a number of useful approximations have been developed, which has led to the wide utilization of DFT in molecular and solid-state theory. In particular, an unknown part of the functional, the exchange and correlation energy can be approximated by local or semilocal functionals, i.e., using the corresponding energy density expressed
in terms of
ρ
and
σ
only, the local density approximation (LDA);
with an addition of first derivatives, or gradients, of
ρ
and
σ
⁠, which yields the generalized gradient approximation (GGA);
and by including new, orbital-dependent variables and higher derivatives of
ρ
and
σ
⁠, with the first significant improvement upon GGA coming from the use of the density of the kinetic energy of the occupied Kohn–Sham orbitals
τ
and potentially Laplacians of
ρ
and
σ
⁠, which defines a meta-GGA level of theory.
Since exchange dominates over correlation in its contribution to the total energy, special care should be taken to treat it accurately. In the limit of noncorrelated electrons, an exact expression for the exchange energy is given by the Hartree–Fock theory. An overall improvement for the total energy of real, correlated systems has been achieved by mixing the nonlocal HF exchange with local and semilocal terms, giving rise to hybrid functionals.
The extent of mixing, however, is the subject of controversy. In the original derivation, Becke35 obtained the best fit to thermochemical data based on GGA B88 exchange36 and PW91 correlation37 functionals with 16% HF exchange. A significant improvement upon this fit has been achieved in three-parameter schemes, which additionally varied the weights of the respective GGA terms, increasing the HF contributions typically to ca. 20%, as, for example, in B3LYP. With the development of GGA functionals, further hybrids have also been proposed with the percentage of HF exchange varying between 20% and 25%, with the second-generation B97-1 (Ref. 38) and B97-2 (Ref. 39) functionals being most successful. The majority of hybrid functionals that are used for molecular and solid-state calculations were fitted to the total energy of atoms, ionization potentials, electron affinities, atomization energies, and structure of small molecules built by atoms from the first and second row of the Periodic Table (⁠
G
1
⁠,
G
2
⁠, etc). Even though the standard hybrid functionals proved to be quite reliable for these properties, they still routinely, significantly, underestimate barriers of reactions, especially those involving radicals. To remedy this situation, Truhlar and co-workers and Lynch et al. developed a kinetics database including 20 reactions and refitted the HF contribution in a one-parameter hybrid functional MPW1PW91 (one-parameter hybrid functional with modified Perdew–Wang exchange and correlation),40 to give a new hybrid functional, MPW1K (modified Perdew–Wang one-parameter model for kinetics).41 Notably, upon fitting the percentage of HF exchange increased from the original 25% to 42.8%.
In this study we are interested in the description of hole localization in an
[
AlO
4
]
0
center, where previous calculations have shown that standard GGA approaches fail to localize the hole on one center. The problem has been attributed to an incomplete cancellation of self-interaction in the DFT.14,42 In this situation an increase in the HF exchange weight can be expected to lead to improvement. Indeed, an HF-LYP functional (100% HF exchange) in Pacchioni’s calculations has produced the desired localization. Similar results have been obtained by Ackermann et al.43 for a hole localized on the Li-doped MgO system. The problem with such an approach, however, is that using 100% HF exchange leads to a significant deterioration in thermochemical data, including such important parameters as dissociation energies. Within the same context, some attempts have recently been made, and work is still in progress on fitting the percentage of the HF exchange based on selected solid-state properties (including band gaps, magnetic ordering, and correct electron∕hole localization), typically yielding ca. 50%.44 But we note that even when using the MPW1K functional with less than half of the HF exchange only reaction barriers are reproduced at a satisfactory level. Until recently, the situation could be summarized as hybrid functionals based on the GGA terms fail to provide a consistently high level of reproduction of both thermochemical and kinetics data, and solid-state properties.
In the last year, a new generation of meta-GGA functionals have started to appear, and first reports indicate that the inclusion of the kinetic-energy density dependence allows the use of exchange coefficients optimal both for the atomization energies and reaction barriers. In this work we investigate the performance of the first of such functional from Zhao et al. BB1K.45 This functional is based on an older hybrid B1B95 functional of Becke,46 and includes 42% (cf. original 28%) HF exchange mixed with a GGA B88 exchange and meta-GGA B95 correlation term. Importantly to us, the B95 correlation functional has been specifically developed with the requirement of being “perfectly self-interaction-free” (i.e., exactly zero correlation energy in any one-electron system).46 Therefore, an additional benefit should be expected for our localized hole system, which is effectively of one-electron character. More recently, Zhao and Truhlar have proposed two more hybrid functionals, fitted to reproduce reaction kinetics, using the same B95 correlation but differing GGA exchange terms.47 These functionals employ 43% and 44% of the HF exchange, remarkably close to the weights used in MPW1K and BB1K. Moreover, Boese and Martin have reported a new semiempirical hybrid functional, BMK (Boese–Martin model for kinetics), including
τ
dependence both in exchange and correlation terms.48 Surprisingly, the BMK functional also includes 42% of the HF exchange, which is in contrast to another successful hybrid meta-GGA functional, TPSSh (Tao–Perdew–Staroverov–Scuseria hybrid),49,50 where the authors proposed just 10% of the HF exchange. As these new functionals are not available yet in commonly available codes, it remains to be seen how they will perform in hole localization problems, but based on our results using BB1K much should be expected.
B. Structural model
The
[

0
defects in the silica systems were modeled using the molecular cluster approach. Clusters of various sizes were cut from the siliceous ZSM-5 (Ref. 51) structure (also referred to in the literature as silicalite-1 or MFI) and from
α
-quartz. ZSM-5 can have either the monoclinic structure with 24 crystallographically distinct cationic framework sites (T sites) at room temperature, or have the orthorhombic structure with 12 T sites at higher temperatures. In this present study, the clusters were cut from the orthorhombic form of ZSM-5 with the T8 site located at the center, which has been reported as the preferred T site for heteroatom substitution from neutron-diffraction studies.52 For
α
-quartz, the clusters were also cut around a T site (only one distinct T site exists). In each cluster, the central T site was replaced by an Al and one of the four Al–O bonds was elongated to
∼
1.9
Å
to produce an initial guess structure. The broken bonds at the cluster boundary were saturated by H atoms, which were fixed at a distance of 0.98 and 1.50 Å, respectively, for O and Si atoms along the Si–O direction of the perfect lattice.
The

The ground-state geometries of the two largest clusters, i.e., models B and C, were partially optimized using Huzinaga–Dunning’s double zeta plus polarization53 (DZP) basis sets on all atoms. In particular, the terminal H atoms were kept fixed during the optimization in order to maintain the constraints imposed by the framework. For the smaller cluster, model A, a further single point calculation on the optimized defect structures was performed using

D. Optical excitation properties
DFT methods have proved to give reliable results for many ground-state properties with an accuracy close to that of post-HF methods. As a consequence, there has been great interest in extending DFT to study excited electronic states. In this context, TDDFT (Ref. 57) offers a rigorous route to the calculation of vertical electronic excitation spectra. Prior to the discovery of TDDFT, a standard method of evaluating the excitation energies was CIS, which models excited states as combination of single substitutions out of the HF ground state. In this work, both TDDFT and CIS methods have been applied to investigate the excited-state properties of the
[
AlO
4
]
0
hole in
α
-quartz and ZSM-5. These calculations are computationally demanding, particularly for large systems; therefore, we have restricted our investigation of the electronic transition energies and intensities to the smallest cluster, i.e., model A. For the TDDFT calculations, we have employed the BB1K functional and basis set I. For the CIS calculations, we also applied basis set I. In the TDDFT and CIS calculations, we use the BB1K and UHF optimized ground-state geometries, respectively. For each of these clusters, the lower excitation energies, as well as the absorption intensities characterized by the oscillator strengths
f
have been evaluated.
All the calculations reported in this paper have been performed with the GAUSSIAN 03 program package.58 
IV. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
A. Al defect in
α
-quartz
Before modeling the properties of the Al defect in ZSM-5, we first assess the BB1K functional against data taken from experimental and previous theoretical studies on the defective
α
-quartz. We start this validation work by examining the ground-state properties of the
[
AlO
4
]
0
center in
α
-quartz. Table I shows the computed Mulliken spin population of the four O atoms neighboring the Al center. Our calculation on model A in combination with basis set I gives a large spin density on one of the O atoms neighboring Al, and small spin densities on the remaining three O atoms being less than or equal to 0.2. It is evident that the electron hole is localized mostly on one O atom, and is not distributed over all oxygen atoms. Accompanying the localized hole is a distorted tetrahedral geometry surrounding the Al center. In particular, we found the Al–O bond distance (1.904 Å) involving the hole-bearing O atom to be 10%–12% longer than the remaining three Al–O distances. The elongation of the bond predicted from our calculation is in excellent agreement with that estimated from EPR experiments (12%)29 and early theoretical work by Adrian et al.59

In Table I, we also report the isotropic and anisotropic contributions to the hyperfine coupling matrix for the ground-state
[
AlO
4
]
0
center. Note that the HCC for two
O
17
and two
Si
29
with the largest contributions, as well as the central
Al
27
⁠, are presented. For comparison, the corresponding data obtained from EPR experiments29 and from theoretical studies by Pacchioni et al.14 are also given.
Our results for model A with basis set I show the principal values of matrix
B
for
O
17
and
Si
29
which are in better agreement with the experimental results than those calculated using UHF and UMP2 by Pacchioni et al. However, the situation is reversed for the isotropic coupling constant
a
iso
of
Al
27
⁠. It should be noted that
a
iso
is determined from the spin density at the nucleus, which is difficult to describe using a relatively small Gaussian basis set, as discussed below (see also Ref. 24). Therefore, the calculation of
a
iso
is more likely to suffer from technical errors than the anisotropic matrix. In addition to the
a
iso
value, the
B
matrix of
Al
27
described at the UHF and UMP2 levels are also similar to the experimental values. However, we have some doubts about the reliability of the computed numbers since the UMP2 and UHF results are virtually identical. In Sec. IV B, we show that this is not the case for the defect in ZSM-5.
As mentioned previously, the anisotropic
B
matrix depends upon the angular momentum of the unpaired electron. Given that the unpaired electron resides in a
2
p
orbital of the O atom in question, we should expect matrix
B
to be roughly proportional to the electron population of the
2
p
orbital. Indeed, our results seem to support this view. With respect to the experimental data, the BB1K functional with a spin distribution of
0.81
e
on one O slightly underestimates the principal values of matrix
B
for
O
17
⁠, while the UHF and UMP2 calculations with a spin distribution of
1.04
e
on the same O somewhat overestimate them.
With the exception of the theoretical method, the main difference between our calculations and those by Pacchioni et al. is the type of basis set used for O, Si, and Al atoms. In particular, for the O atom they employed the EPR-II basis set, which has been specifically designed to accurately describe the HCC for O atoms. To investigate the effect of basis-set size, we repeated the calculations for model A with the BB1K functional, but this time we used the larger basis set II. Analysis of Table I shows that moving from basis set I to II does not significantly affect the spin distribution of the hole or greatly improve the HCC. Only the principal values of B (−82.6, 41.3, and 41.3 G) for
O
17
are in better agreement with the corresponding experimental values (−85.0, 41.2, and 43.8 G) than those calculated from basis set I.
In addition to model A, we have also considered a larger cluster, model B where a fourth shell of 12 Si atoms around the Al center is included [see Fig. 3(b)]. Moving from model A to B with basis set I, the hole also localizes on O1. In fact, upon replacement of O–H bonds with Si–O bonds, the localization of this hole becomes more pronounced in model B (⁠
0.93
e
compared to
0.81
e
calculated with model A). Furthermore, the HCC of
Al
27
and
Si
29
derived from model B are in agreement with the experimental values. Overall, we conclude that the hole localization and the accompanying elongation of the Al–O bonds do not vary significantly with cluster size or basis-set size.
So far we have only considered the ground-state properties of the Al defect in
α
-quartz. However, the defect in its excited state has also attracted considerable interest. As mentioned previously, EPR studies have demonstrated that a thermally excited state exists at 0.042 eV above the ground state, with the hole localized on O2. UHF cluster calculations by Pacchioni et al. predicted this state should occur at a higher energy of 0.079 eV. The same authors also identified another excited state at 1.60 eV, with the hole localized over two O2 atoms. Optical absorption measurements have shown the Al containing
α
-quartz absorbs light in the visible part of the optical spectrum. As previously mentioned, two dominant bands observed at 1.98 and 2.85 eV (with relative intensities of 0.25 and 1, respectively) have been associated with the
[
AlO
4
]
0
defect in
α
-quartz. For the first time, we investigate the optical transitions of the defect in
α
-quartz, and later in ZSM-5, by means of BB1K-TDDFT and CIS.
The optimized ground-state structure of model A was used to calculate the optical properties for the Al defect in
α
-quartz. The 12 lowest excitation energies computed at the BB1K-TDDFT level are shown in Table II. Similar to the B3LYP-TDDFT and (outer valence green Function) OVGF work of Zyubin et al.,60 the first excited state corresponds to an on-site transition, in which the hole is excited from its ground
p
state to excited
p
states at the same paramagnetic O ion. Transition to this state, which is 0.58 eV above the ground state, has an oscillator strength of almost zero. The second excited state at 1.65 eV corresponds to an electron transfer to the singly occupied orbital of the hole-bearing O from the doubly occupied orbital of three neighboring O atoms around Al. In this respect, this analysis corroborates Schirmer’s model27 of the hole hopping between equivalent
O
2
−
sites, whereby the excitation is acting against the self-induced trapping potential. However, we find no appreciable intensity for this transition.

In the subsequent five excited states, the hole is distributed among neighboring O atom of the Al center, in agreement with Schirmer’s assignment of an optical absorption band, and the calculated excitation energies are in the range of 1.66–2.48 eV. In fact, the excitation energy of the third excited state (1.99 eV), which exhibits the highest oscillator strength, is in excellent agreement with one of the experimentally observed bands (1.98 eV), and with the reliable OVGF work.60 Taking into account that the other experimental band was observed at 2.85 eV, we expect to find this band at higher energies. In the next six transitions, the hole is not only excited to adjacent O atoms of Al but also delocalized among the next shell of oxygen (i.e., the boundary oxygen). We notice that the tenth excited state occurs with significant intensity, and the excitation energy (3.03 eV) is also consistent with the experimental value.
Further analysis shows that the oscillator strength for the third transition (the lower-energy band) is nearly six times more intense than that found for the tenth transition. Somewhat disappointingly, the situation is reversed for those bands observed experimentally, in which the lower-energy band is four times less intense than the higher one. The difference in intensities points to the deficiencies of the chosen model, such as the boundary O–H bonds of the cluster. It could also be argued that model A is not large enough to include the long-range relaxation effects due to the hole trapping, and can, in principle, lead to somewhat different local geometrical parameters and also different orbital characteristics. A solution is to use a larger cluster model; however, the calculations, especially for excited states, become more computationally demanding. More accurate, embedded cluster investigations are currently underway in our group, and will be reported elsewhere.
In spite of the fact that the a higher-energy band has a larger error
(
∼
0.18
eV
)
⁠, as higher excited states become more delocalized, we note that with the new functional the calculations are still in better agreement with the experiment than those obtained at the B3LYP-TDDFT level by Zyubin et al.60 The error in the B3LYP results can be attributed to the incorrect description of the defect in its ground state, as discussed above. Disagreements of up to 1 eV have also been found previously with transition metal complexes,61 and hence the B3LYP results obtained here are not uncommon.
Now we focus our attention on the CIS calculations (see Table III). With the exception of the first excitation, the next five energies are significantly higher than those calculated from TDDFT, and from the experimental values of
α
-quartz. For instance, the transition with the highest oscillator strength (0.0217) involves the fourth excited state, which occurs at 8.11 eV. This excitation energy is about 5 eV higher than the corresponding experimental value, which suggests that transitions occur into the O–H excitation region. This large deviation points to the crucial role of correlation effects, which are mostly absent in the CIS calculations. The third and fourth excited states involve electron transfer to one or more neighboring O atoms. The third excitation has the second highest oscillator strength, but it is nearly 70% weaker than that calculated for the fourth excited state. For the four remaining transitions involving the first, second, fifth, and sixth excited states, their oscillator strengths are less than or equal to 0.006; therefore, they are not likely to be observed. Further comparison to experimental values is impossible due to the methodological limitations of the model already mentioned.

     In conclusion, the BB1K method can adequately describe the electronic structure and EPR properties of the substitutional Al impurity in
α
-quartz. In fact, regardless of basis-set and cluster size, the HCC evaluated from the BB1K method show an overall improvement over the UHF and UMP2 approaches. As for the optical properties of the
AlO
4
defect the excitation energies calculated by BB1K-TDDFT significantly improve on CIS, with the former producing results very close to the experimental values.
B. Al defect in ZSM-5
In contrast to
α
-quartz, only a limited number of theoretical studies have been reported on Al-related defects in irradiated zeolites. In recent years, DFT periodic and cluster models have been used to investigate the dehydroxylation of Brønsted sites into Lewis sites, such as the trigonal Al center at the site of an oxygen vacancy, as postulated by Stamires and Turkevich.4 It was concluded that the required defect formation energy is too high
(
∼
80
kcal
∕
mol
)
for these sites to develop by a thermally assisted process, which may explain why there has been no conclusive experimental evidence of the existence of trigonal sites. In an earlier DFT cluster study, modeling the localization of the hole in the
[
AlO
4
]
0
defect center proved to be difficult. Similar to the DFT calculations performed on
α
-quartz, it was concluded that the hole is delocalized over all four oxygen, even though a small preference was given to one O
(

)
⁠.12 
In the present work, we significantly extend the scope of previous theoretical studies by examining the spin distribution and HCC for the ground-state
[
AlO

]
0
center in irradiated ZSM-5. In our calculations we have used model A with basis sets I and II, and also model C with basis set I. We have already shown that calculations using the BB1K method can correctly describe the highly localized nature of the hole in
α
-quartz; therefore, we have applied the BB1K method here as well. For comparison purposes, we also present results based on UHF, UMP2, and the standard DFT functional B97-2 for model A. The spin distribution and HCC for the ground-state
[
AlO

0
center computed with model A and C clusters are listed in Table IV, together with the corresponding experimental data. Given that the HCC of
Al

taken from
α
-quartz are also given.

Focusing our attention first on model A with basis set I, we find UHF, UMP2, UHF∕LYP, and BB1K reproduce the experimental observation of a localized hole at O1. In particular, the BB1K calculation predicts the Al–O bond involving the hole-bearing oxygen is about 11% longer than the other ones, which is in excellent agreement with the EPR measurement of the Al defect in
α
-quartz (12%) and with calculations reported in Ref. 15. However, we find that the BB1K functional predicts a lower spin population (ca. 12%–14%) on the hole-bearing O than those calculated with the UHF and UMP2 methods. On the other hand, the results based on the B97-2 functional show an alternative model where the unpaired electron is distributed over two O atoms. A closer inspection of the B97-2 results show the spin population on these two O atoms are almost half the value calculated with the BB1K functional
(
0.89
e
)
⁠. The calculations with two other popular hybrid functionals, B3LYP and B97-1, similar to B97-2, predict that the hole is delocalized over two O atoms. These results can be found as supplementary material.62 Previous studies based on pure DFT approaches such as BLYP have reached the conclusion that the hole is evenly distributed over the four O atoms nearest to Al in
α
-quartz,14 in clear contrast with the experimental observation of a fully localized hole.
With regards to the HCC of
Al
27
⁠, we find that the BB1K functional reproduces the experimental data very well, even better than UHF and UMP2. For instance, the BB1K and experimental isotropic
Al
27
coupling constant differ by only 0.49 G, whereas the difference between the corresponding UMP2 and experimental value is 0.88 G. Moving onto the HCC of
O
17
⁠, we find the BB1K and UMP2 calculations are closest to the experimental values observed for the Al defect in
α
-quartz. In the BB1K calculations,
B
1
⁠,
B
2
⁠, and
B
3
for
O
17
are −85.6, 42.7, and 42.9 G, respectively. The corresponding experimental values obtained from Al-doped
α
-quartz, −85.0, 41.2, and 43.8 G, are in good agreement with the BB1K values. The same conclusion can be made for the principal
B
values of
Al
27
⁠. In addition to BB1K and UMP2, the UHF∕LYP method also reproduces the experimental HCC of
Al
27
very well. As for the standard DF calculations, the HCC are completely different from the experimental values, and those predicted for the localized cases (UHF, UMP2, UHF∕LYP, and BB1K). It is clear that B97-2 overestimates the principal
A
values and
a
iso
of
Al
27
with respect to the experimental ones. Although the results are not presented here, we also find there is more than one set of HCC of
O
17
and
Si
29
with significant contributions, and these HCC are almost half the value of the experimental ones observed for
α
-quartz. This further supports the view that the hole is delocalized, and that the unpaired electron is interacting with more than one nuclear spin of
O
17
and
Si
29
⁠.
According to our calculations, the inclusion of correlation effects in UMP2 does not change the overall picture obtained at the UHF level of a fully localized hole. A similar conclusion was obtained by Pacchioni et al., in which the calculations were performed on defective
α
-quartz. As previously mentioned, their hyperfine constants for
O
17
⁠,
Al
27
⁠, and
Si
29
are virtually identical in their UHF and UMP2 calculations. In contrast, we find the HCC values are different in the two methods, with the UMP2 in better agreement with the experimental data. Specifically, the values of
a
iso
(
O
17
)
obtained from UMP2 and UHF methods are −27.1 and −40.8 G, respectively, while the corresponding experimental value is −26.0 G.
To check whether the remaining discrepancies between the computed and measured values are related to the quality of the basis set, we repeated the calculations on model A with the larger basis set II. Note that in these calculations the computationally demanding UMP2 method was not applied. According to our BB1K calculations, the larger basis set does not significantly improve the HCC of
Al
27
or
Si
29
⁠. In fact, there are larger deviations in the HCC of
O
17
with respect to the experimental data of Al-doped
α
-quartz. For instance, using basis sets I and II the
a
iso
(
O
17
)
are −21.70 and −17.13 G, respectively, while the experimental value is −26.0 G. In contrast, the standard density functionals show little improvements to the HCC of
O
17
when employing a larger basis set. To prove that the spin localization is not an artifact of the smaller model A, we also considered the larger model C. Applying the BB1K functional to model C with basis set I, we confirm the conclusions obtained with the smaller clusters, and importantly, we find the spin distribution has become more pronounced on the hole-bearing O
(
0.93
e
)
than in model A
(
0.89
e
)
⁠.
Similar to the analysis of the defective
α
-quartz, we have further studied the optical properties of the Al defect in ZSM-5. The TDDFT and CIS results for the six lowest excited states of the defect are summarized in Tables V and VI, respectively, and the two cluster models under discussion are pictured in Figs. 4(c) and 4(d). Given that there is no corresponding experimental data, we have compared our results with those obtained from optical spectroscopy studies on Al containing
α
-quartz. Following a similar trend to
α
-quartz, TDDFT predicts the lowest-energy excitation is a local
2
p
–
2
p
transition involving the same O atom bearing the hole. This state is 0.36 eV above the ground state, but would have almost no intensity in the optical spectrum. Apart from the first excited state, all the excitations correspond to the hole being excited to other O neighboring atoms. A closer inspection of the results show the third excitation at 2.16 eV has the highest oscillator strength (0.0314). This excitation is nearly 0.17 eV higher than the calculated value for defective
α
-quartz, which suggests that the results are dependent on the local geometry of the defect. In addition, a second transition is predicted to occur at 2.33 eV with an intensity of about
2
∕
3
of the first. The remaining four excited states have much lower intensities, and are therefore less likely to be observed.

     Turning our attention to the CIS results (Table VI), the first excited state is a local transition involving only the orbitals of the hole-bearing O. This state occurs at 3.35 eV, with negligible intensity. The second excited state also has a low intensity, which in addition to a local transition, involves transfer of an unpaired electron between neighboring O atoms. The other four excited states also correspond to transitions between neighboring O atoms, which occur at 7.95, 8.14, 8.39, and 8.72 eV, respectively. The fourth excited state has the highest oscillator strength (0.0405), but the corresponding excitation energy (8.14 eV) is substantially overestimated with respect to that observed experimentally in
α
-quartz. We have to bear in mind that these are only tentative comparisons, since the structures of
α
-quartz and ZSM-5 are different. One important distinction is the density of the two materials, where silica
α
-quartz is about 33% more dense than silica ZSM-5.63 The source of the discrepancy between theory and experiment is not clear. To gain further understanding of this, calculations based on more accurate, embedded cluster models are currently in progress.
To summarize this section, we have shown that the UHF, UMP2, UHF∕LYP, and BB1K results are consistent with EPR experimental data, while the B97-2 functional fails to describe the hole localization and the structural distortions around the Al impurity. The failure of the latter method is attributed to the incomplete cancellation of the self-interaction by the approximation for the exchange-correlation functional. Although it is not a functional free of self-interaction in the exchange part, the BB1K functional does reproduce the experimental data very well, and therefore can correct the failures of standard DFT methods. Finally, the optical absorption calculations on the Al defect show the excitation energies predicted by TDDFT are in better agreement with the experimental values for the defective
α
-quartz than those calculated with the CIS approach.
V. CONCLUSIONS
The calculations reported in this paper have helped to clarify the hole properties of Al containing
α
-quartz and ZSM-5. Moreover, these results have given us insight into the methodological aspects. In particular, our results show that the BB1K method can correctly describe the localization of the
[
AlO
4
]
0
hole in
α
-quartz and ZSM-5, and simultaneously produce hyperfine parameters of the paramagnetic defect, which are in close agreement with experiment. The optical absorption calculations also demonstrate that the BB1K-TDDFT method can provide accurate energies for the cluster simulating the Al defect in
α
-quartz.
It should also be noted that the ground-state and excited-state properties, in particular, the spin distribution, the hyperfine interactions of paramagnetic defects, and to a lesser extent the excitation energies associated with the Al impurity, for Al containing
α
-quartz are similar to those calculated for Al-doped ZSM-5. As the systems have very similar short-range order, our results point at an extremely localized nature of the properties under study. To provide further corroboration to our work, reliable experimental data for the ground-state, as well as the excited-state properties of the Al center in ZSM-5, are highly desirable. Finally, following the trend observed in our BB1K calculations and taking into account the empirical error found in defective
α
-quartz, we can predict that the
[
AlO
4
]
0
defect in ZSM-5 should give rise to a strong signal between 2.152 and 2.35 eV in the optical absorption spectra.

Finally, one of the authors (J.T.) gratefully acknowledges the EPSRC for the financial support and for the provision of computational resources.
