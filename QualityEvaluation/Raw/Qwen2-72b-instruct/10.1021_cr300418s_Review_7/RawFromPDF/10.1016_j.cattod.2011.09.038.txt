The
 interaction
 of  O2 with  reduced
 rutile
 TiO2(1
 1 0)–(1  ×  1)  has  been
 studied
 by
 means
 of  scanning
 tun-
neling
 microscopy
 (STM),  temperature-programmed
 desorption
 (TPD)  and
 photoelectron
 spectroscopy
(PES).
 It is  found
 that  the  interaction
 of  O2 with  TiO2(1  1 0)
 depends
 strongly
 on  the  reduction
 state
 of
the
 TiO2(1  1 0) crystal.
 High-resolution
 STM  studies
 revealed
 that  the  energy
 barrier
 for
 the
 non-vacancy-
assisted,
 2nd  O2 dissociation
 channel
 decreases
 with  increasing
 crystal
 reduction.
 Additionally,
 it is
 found
in
 the  STM  studies
 that the  Ti interstitial
 diffusion
 is  slightly
 more
 facile  in  high-reduced
 TiO2(1
 1 0)  crys-
tals
 compared
 to  low-reduced
 ones.
 Accompanying
 TPD  studies
 revealed
 that  the  line  shape
 of the  O2-TPD
peak
 occurring
 between
 ∼360
 K  and  ∼450
 K
 depends
 on  the  crystal  reduction
 state.
 For  high-reduced
TiO2(1  1 0)  crystals
 characterized
 by  large  terraces  most  O2 molecules
 desorb
 at  ∼386 K,  whereas
 O2
desorption
 is  peaking
 at  ∼410  K  for  low-  and  medium-reduced
 crystals.
 Furthermore,
 the  O2-TPD  experi-
ments
 revealed
 a  highly
 non-linear
 behavior
 of  the  O2 desorption
 peak  integrals
 as  function
 of the  crystal
reduction
 state.  The  presented
 results
 point  to an  ionosorption
 model
 where
 the  adsorbates
 withdraw
the
 excess  charge
 (Ti3+)
 from  the  near-surface
 region
 at temperatures
 <  ∼360  K and  where
 Ti
 interstitials
react
 with  oxygen
 species
 on  the  surface
 at  temperatures
 ≥ ∼360  K.

 Introduction
Titanium
 dioxide
 (TiO2)
 is
 used
 in
 a
 wide
 number
 of
 tech-
nological
 ﬁelds
 such
 as
 photocatalysis,
 heterogeneous
 catalysis,
biocompatible
 materials,
 photovoltaic
 cells
 and
 gas
 sensors
 [1–9].
In
 all
 these
 applications
 the
 interaction
 of
 O2 with
 TiO2 plays
 an
important
 role.
 For
 example,
 O2 is
 a
 common
 oxidant
 and
 is
 used
in
 photocatalysis
 as
 a
 scavenger
 of
 the
 photoexcited
 electrons
 to
prevent
 negative
 charge
 accumulation
 on
 the
 surface
 of
 the
 cata-
lysts
 [1,2,5,9].
 Thus,
 to
 enhance
 the
 efﬁciencies
 in
 the
 current
 and
future
 applications
 of
 TiO2 it
 is
 essential
 to
 improve
 our
 fundamen-
tal
 understanding
 of
 how
 O2 interacts
 with
 TiO2 surfaces.
It
 is
 generally
 accepted
 that
 adsorbed
 O2 species
 acquire
 nega-
tive
 charge
 upon
 adsorption
 on
 TiO2 surfaces
 [7,9–18]. Theoretical
calculations
 have
 shown
 that
 excess
 charge
 can
 be
 donated
 by
all
 the
 various
 defects
 that
 are
 associated
 with
 Ti3+ such
 as
 O
vacancies,
 surplus
 H
 and
 interstitial
 Ti
 [12,14,15,18–24].

excess
 electrons
 populate
 the
 normally
 empty
 Ti
 3d
 orbitals
 on
cations
 in
 the
 near
 and
 far
 proximity
 of
 the
 structural
 defects,
 lead-
ing
 to
 a
 state
 in
 the
 ∼3.1
 eV
 wide
 band
 gap
 [4,10,13,25–29].
 It
 is
this
 excess
 charge
 that
 can
 be
 donated
 to
 O2 species
 on
 the
 TiO2
surface
 [4,7,9–13,15–18,26,27,30,31].
 However,
 which
 particular
structural
 defects
 provide
 most
 of
 the
 Ti3+ excess
 electrons
 and
are
 thus
 most
 relevant
 for
 the
 O2–TiO2 interaction
 is
 today
 still
unsettled
 [9,17,30,32].
To
 disentangle
 the
 contributions
 of
 the
 individual
 defects
 for
chemical
 reactions
 on
 TiO2,
 the
 surface
 science
 approach
 [33]
 is
most
 promising.
 For
 surface
 science
 studies
 addressing
 TiO2, the
rutile
 TiO2(1
 1
 0)–(1
 ×
 1)
 surface
 has
 been
 often
 preferred
 (Fig.
 1)
[4,7,17,32,34,35].
 Upon
 TiO2(1
 1
 0)
 sample
 preparation
 in
 ultrahigh
vacuum
 (UHV),
 the
 crystals
 are
 reduced,
 leading
 to
 the
 creation
 of
bulk
 defects
 such
 as
 Ti
 interstitials
 and
 bridging
 O
 (Obr)
 vacancies
on
 the
 surface
 [4,13,35,36].
 Considering
 that
 scanning
 tunneling
microscopy
 (STM)
 studies
 addressing
 the
 anatase
 TiO2(101)
 sur-
face
 revealed
 the
 absence
 of
 surface
 O
 vacancies
 [37],
 the
 formation
of
 surface
 O
 vacancies
 in
 UHV
 may
 be
 a
 peculiar
 feature
 of
 rutile
crystals.
The
 interaction
 of
 O2 with
 rutile
 TiO2(1
 1
 0)
 has
 been
 stud-
ied
 previously
 using
 STM

and
 
photon-

electron-
stimulated

 ESD)
 [7,11,16,31,45,52,54–59].
 At
 low
temperatures
 (LT),
 that
 is
 for
 110
 K
 ≤
 T
 ≤
 150
 K,
 O2 molecules
adsorb
 both
 molecularly
 and
 dissociatively
 on
 rutile
 TiO2(1
 1
 0)
[13,30,41,45],
 whereas
 at
 room
 temperature
 (RT)
 dissociative
adsorption
 is
 prevalent
 in
 low-pressure-experiments
 performed
under
 UHV
 conditions
 [10,13,30,44].
 Two
 different
 dissociative
adsorption
 channels
 have
 been
 identiﬁed
 at
 RT:
 The
 1st
 channel
that
 is
 associated
 with
 Obr vacancy
 sites
 and
 the
 2nd
 channel
 that
occurs
 directly
 in
 the
 Ti
 troughs
 and
 is
 not
 associated
 with
 Obr
vacancy
 sites
 [13,30,44].
 As
 a
 result
 of
 dissociative
 O2 adsorption,
O
 adatoms
 are
 created
 that
 reside
 on-top
 on
 the
 5f-Ti
 sites
 (Oot
adatoms,
 cf.
 Fig.
 1).
 In
 the
 STM
 images,
 the
 Oot adatoms
 appear
 as
bright
 protrusions
 in
 the
 Ti
 troughs,
 rendering
 STM
 as
 the
 tech-
nique
 of
 choice
 for
 studying
 the
 dissociative
 adsorption
 of
 O2 on
TiO2(1
 1
 0).
Recent
 low-temperature
 STM
 studies
 [46–48]
 conﬁrmed
 the
occurrence
 of
 molecular
 and
 dissociative
 adsorption
 of
 O2,
 and
 also
the
 existence
 of
 two
 O2 dissociation
 channels
 has
 been
 conﬁrmed
by
 Wang
 et
 al.
 [47].
 However,
 uncertainty
 still
 exists
 with
 regard
to
 the
 temperatures
 at
 which
 the
 two
 O2 dissociation
 channels
 set
in.
 Whereas
 we
 found
 the
 onset
 of
 the
 1st
 O2 dissociation
 channel
to
 occur
 at
 110–130
 K
 [13,41],
 Tan
 et
 al.
 [48]
 reported
 evidence
 for
nondissociated
 O2 at
 Obr vacancies
 at
 130
 K,
 and
 Wang
 et
 al.
 [47]
reported
 that
 O2 molecules
 would
 dissociate
 only
 for
 temperatures
higher
 than
 150
 K.
Regarding
 the
 role
 of
 defects
 for
 the
 interaction
 of
 O2 with
 rutile
TiO2(1
 1
 0),
 Petrik
 et
 al.
 claimed
 that
 the
 amount
 of
 chemisorbed
O2 on
 TiO2 depends
 mainly
 on
 the
 density
 of
 surface
 defects
 such
as
 Obr vacancies
 and
 capping
 H
 adatoms
 [Had species,
 also
 known
as
 bridging
 hydroxyl
 (OHbr)
 groups]
 [31].
 These
 authors
 inferred
that
 the
 Ti3+ excess
 charge
 associated
 with
 Obr vacancies
 and
 Had
species
 rather
 than
 the
 charge
 provided
 from
 subsurface
 defects,
such
 as
 Ti
 interstitials,
 determines
 the
 oxygen
 chemistry
 on
 rutile
TiO2(1
 1
 0)–(1
 ×
 1)
 [31].
 The
 same
 group
 also
 suggested
 that
 the
excess
 charge
 associated
 with
 the
 2nd,
 non-vacancy-assisted
 O2
dissociation
 channel
 would
 stem
 predominantly
 from
 Obr vacan-
cies
 [44]
 rather
 than
 from
 Ti
 interstitials
 as
 we
 proposed
 earlier
[13].
 Recently,
 we
 have
 provided
 further
 evidence
 that
 the
 adsorp-
tion
 of
 oxygen
 species
 on
 clean,
 reduced
 TiO2(1
 1
 0)
 surfaces
 is
governed
 by
 the
 available
 Ti3+ excess
 charge
 in
 the
 near-surface
region
 [30,49].  Speciﬁcally,
 we
 proposed
 that
 the
 desorption
 of
 O2
molecules
 at
 ∼410
 K
 is
 caused
 by
 a
 depletion
 of
 Ti3+ excess
 charge
in
 the
 near-surface
 region
 induced
 by
 reactions
 between
 oxygen
species
 and
 out-diffusing
 Ti
 interstitials
 [30].
 These
 observations
point
 to
 an
 ionosorption
 model
 for
 understanding
 redox
 processes
on
 the
 surface
 of
 reduced
 TiO2(1
 1
 0)
 rather
 than
 to
 charge
 donation
from
 surface
 defects.
In
 the
 present
 article,
 we  studied
 the
 interaction
 of
 O2 with
reduced
 TiO2(1
 1
 0)–(1
 ×
 1)
 surfaces
 for
 a
 wide
 range
 of
 crystal
reduction
 states.
 We  report
 on
 a
 strong
 inﬂuence
 of
 the
 crystal
reduction
 state
 on
 the
 O2 adsorption.
 An
 upper
 limit
 exists
 for
the
 coverage
 of
 Oot adatoms
 that
 can
 be
 adsorbed
 on
 TiO2(1
 1
 0).
On
 high-reduced
 TiO2(1
 1
 0)–(1
 ×
 1)
 surfaces
 this
 limit
 lays
 close
 to
∼8%
 ML  (LT)
 and
 ∼11%
 ML
 (RT),
 respectively.
 In
 addition,
 the
 bar-
rier
 for
 the
 2nd
 O2 dissociation
 channel
 is
 lower
 on
 high-reduced
TiO2(1
 1
 0)
 crystals
 than
 on
 low-
 and
 medium-reduced
 ones.
 Like-
wise
 the
 line
 shape
 of
 the
 O2-TPD-spectra
 depends
 on
 the
 crystal
reduction
 state,
 and
 the
 O2 desorption
 peak
 integrals
 show
 a
 highly
non-linear
 dependence
 of
 the
 crystal
 reduction
 state.
 The
 presented
results
 can
 be
 best
 explained
 within
 an
 ionosorption
 model:
 The
adsorbates,
 O2 molecules
 and
 Oot adatoms,
 respectively,
 withdraw
the
 Ti3+ excess
 charge
 from
 the
 near-surface
 region
 at
 <∼360
 K,
and
 at
 temperatures
 ≥
 ∼360
 K
 the
 oxygen
 species
 react
 with
 out-
diffusing
 Ti
 interstitials.

 Experimental
The
 STM
 and
 TPD
 experiments
 were
 performed
 in
 a
 UHV
 cham-
ber
 with
 a
 base
 pressure
 in
 the
 low
 10−11 Torr
 range
 equipped
 with
a
 homebuilt,
 variable-temperature
 Aarhus
 STM,
 a
 quadrupole
 mass
spectrometer
 (QMS),
 and
 standard
 facilities
 for
 sample
 prepara-
tion
 and
 characterization
 [60,61]. The
 Aarhus
 STM
 is
 capable
 of
 fast
scanning
 and
 high
 resolution
 in
 a
 temperature
 range
 between
 100
and
 400
 K
 [60].
 Electrochemically
 etched
 tungsten
 tips
 were
 used
for
 all
 STM
 measurements.
 The
 STM
 images
 presented
 in
 this
 study
were
 acquired
 in
 constant
 current
 mode
 with
 a
 tunneling
 voltage
 of
∼+1.25
 V
 and
 a
 tunneling
 current
 of
 ∼0.1
 nA.
 Lower
 tunneling
 volt-
ages
 and
 currents
 were
 also
 tested,
 and
 the
 results
 were
 found
 to
be
 invariant
 in
 the
 covered
 parameter
 intervals.
 For
 the
 extraction
of
 coverage
 based
 on
 the
 STM
 measurements
 at
 least
 total
 areas
 of
1300–2000
 nm2 were
 scanned
 and
 analyzed.
 From
 previous
 stud-
ies
 we
 know
 that
 the
 analysis
 of
 STM
 images
 covering
 ∼1000
 nm2
are
 sufﬁcient
 in
 order
 to
 guarantee
 that
 the
 observed
 densities
 are
representative
 for
 the
 whole
 sample
 surface
 [30,42,62].
The
 differentially
 pumped
 QMS
 was
 connected
 to
 the
 main
chamber
 via
 a
 closed
 cone
 with
 a
 small
 aperture
 (d
 ∼
 3
 mm).
 To
ensure
 that
 only
 molecules
 desorbing
 from
 the
 sample
 could
 reach
the
 QMS,
 the
 cone
 was
 placed
 facing
 the
 sample
 at
 a
 distance
of
 ∼1
 mm.
 The
 temperature
 of
 the
 sample
 could
 be
 varied
 from
100
 K
 by
 cooling
 with
 liquid
 nitrogen
 to
 1100
 K
 by
 heating
 the
 back
side
 of
 the
 sample
 radiatively
 and
 by
 electron
 bombardment.
 The
sample
 temperature
 was
 measured
 using
 a
 K-type
 thermocouple
spot-welded
 to
 the
 sample
 plate
 such
 that
 the
 thermocouple
 is
 in
direct
 contact
 with
 the
 crystal
 face.
 The
 sample
 temperature
 was
controlled
 and
 recorded
 by
 a
 Eurotherm
 temperature
 controller
that
 contains
 an
 automatic
 compensation
 of
 ambient
 temperature
changes.
 A
 calibrated
 pyrometer
 was
 used
 to
 double
 check
 the
 tem-
perature
 of
 the
 samples
 during
 vacuum-annealing.
The
 PES
 experiments
 were
 carried
 out
 in
 an
 UHV
 end-station
 at
the
 SX700
 plane
 grating
 monochromator
 beam
 line
 at
 the
 ASTRID
synchrotron
 radiation
 facility
 at
 Aarhus
 University
 [63].
 The
 base
pressure
 in
 this
 UHV
 chamber
 was
 likewise
 in
 the
 10−11 Torr
 range.
The
 PES
 data
 were
 acquired
 using
 a
 VG
 CLAM
 II
 spectrometer
 work-
ing
 at
 30
 eV
 pass
 energy.
 Valence
 band
 spectra
 were
 acquired
 with
 a
photon
 energy
 of
 47.5
 eV,
 corresponding
 to
 the
 Ti
 3p–3d
 resonance
in
 order
 to
 maximize
 the
 intensity
 of
 the
 Ti
 3d
 defect
 state
 in
 the
band
 gap
 [26,64].
 All
 PES
 spectra
 were
 acquired
 in
 normal
 emission
geometry
 and
 normalized
 to
 the
 incident
 photon-ﬂux.
 Spectra
 are
plotted
 versus
 binding

To

 the

 After

 the

 in

If
 not
 stated
 otherwise,

 to
 O2 through
 a
 directional
 doser
 containing
 a

 glass
capillary
 array
 disk
 of
 ∼8
 mm
 diameter,
 which
 was
 placed
 in
 front
 of
the
 sample
 at
 a
 distance
 of
 ∼1
 mm
 from
 the
 sample
 surface.
 When
using
 the
 directional
 doser,
 the
 local
 O2 pressure
 was
 estimated
 to
be
 ∼100
 times
 higher
 than
 the
 background
 O2 pressure.
 The

O2 exposures
 in

 with
 1
 L
 =
 1.33

 s,
 take
this
 factor
 of
 100
 into
 account.
 The
 use
 of
 the
 directional
 doser
 is
advantageous
 to
 minimize
 the
 partial
 O2 pressure
 in
 the
 UHV

 and
 thus
 to

 troughs,
while
 the
 dark
 rows
 arise
 from
 the
 protruding
 two-fold
 coordi-
nated
 Obr atoms
 (Fig.
 1)
 [4,65].
 Protrusions
 within
 the
 dark
 rows
are
 known
 to
 stem
 from
 Obr vacancies,
 i.e.,
 missing
 Obr atoms
[4,17,32,34,41].
 In
 addition
 to
 the
 Obr vacancies
 few
 capping
 Had
species
 in
 the
 rows
 of
 Obr atoms
 are
 also
 evident
 on
 the
 surface.
The
 Had species
 are
 the
 result
 of
 water
 dissociation
 at
 Obr vacancy
sites
 and
 appear
 slightly
 brighter
 in
 the
 STM
 images
 than
 the
 Obr
vacancies
 [17,34,41,66,67].

 shows
 a

trum
 of
 the
 r-TiO2(1

 surface
 that
 was
 acquired
 after
 applying
 a
comparable
 preparation
 protocol
 (red
 curve).
 The
 valence
 band
 of
rutile
 TiO2(1
 1
 0)
 is
 characterized
 by
 bands
 between
 ∼3
 and
 ∼9.5
 eV
BE
 that
 are
 to
 a
 large
 extent
 associated
 with
 O
 2p
 derived
 states
[25,26,68].  In
 addition,
 a
 state
 within
 the
 band
 gap
 is
 observed
 at
∼0.85
 eV
 below
 EF that
 is
 associated
 with
 Ti
 3d
 excess
 electrons
(Ti3+)
 and
 that
 can
 be
 eliminated
 by
 O2 exposure
 [4,13,25–27].
Fig.
 2d
 shows
 an
 O2-TPD
 spectrum
 obtained
 after
 the
 r-TiO2(1
 1
 0)
surface
 imaged
 in
 Fig.
 2a
 was
 exposed
 to
 100
 L
 O2 at
 ∼130
 K.
 The
maximum
 O2 desorption
 occurred
 at
 ∼410
 K
 (-peak)
 regardless
of
 the
 O2 exposure,
 indicating
 ﬁrst-order
 desorption
 kinetics.
 A
shoulder
 at
 ∼386
 K
 (-peak)
 was
 evident
 in
 all
 the
 O2-TPD
 spectra
collected
 from
 this
 TiO2(1
 1
 0)
 crystal.
 Such
 a
 double
 peak
 struc-
ture
 of
 the
 O2 desorption
 has
 also
 been
 reported
 in
 previous
 studies
[10,30,69].
The
 same
 techniques
 were
 applied
 to
 study
 h-TiO2(1
 1
 0)
 sur-
faces
 prepared
 when
 using
 crystals
 characterized
 by
 very
 similar
reduction
 states
 (cf.
 Fig.
 2).
 The
 h-TiO2(1
 1
 0)
 surfaces
 are
 character-
ized
 by
 the
 presence
 of
 Had species
 (indicated
 by
 hexagons
 in
 Fig.
 2a
and
 b)
 and
 the
 complete
 absence
 of
 Obr vacancies
 [41–43].  The
 PES
valence
 band
 spectrum
 of
 the
 h-TiO2(1
 1
 0)
 surface
 (Fig.
 2c,
 blue
curve)
 is
 very
 similar
 to
 the
 one
 obtained
 for
 r-TiO2(1
 1
 0),
 the
 only
apparent
 difference
 being
 a
 peak
 found
 at
 ∼10.3
 eV
 arising
 from
 OH
3
 bonds
 [26].
 Upon
 hydration,
 the
 Ti
 3d
 defect
 state
 at
 ∼0.85
 eV
BE
 remains
 almost
 unchanged
 [13].
 The
 O2-TPD
 spectrum
 obtained
for
 h-TiO2(1
 1
 0)
 after
 O2 saturation
 at
 ∼130
 K
 is
 characterized
 by
 a
narrow
 peak
 that
 is
 centered
 at
 ∼410
 K
 [Fig.
 2d,
 blue
 curve].
 Its
 inte-
grated
 area
 is
 comparable
 to
 that
 found
 on
 the
 r-TiO2(1
 1
 0)
 surface
[31,49,50].
The
 results
 summarized
 in
 Fig.
 2
 reveal
 that
 the
 electronic
 prop-
erties
 of
 r-
 and
 h-TiO2(1
 1
 0)
 surfaces
 are
 similar.
 Consequently,
 the
ability
 to
 chemisorb
 oxygen
 species
 is
 also
 similar
 on
 r-
 and
 h-
TiO2(1
 1
 0)
 surfaces.
 The
 different
 line
 shape
 of
 the
 O2-TPD
 spectra
found
 for
 r-
 and
 h-TiO2(1
 1
 0)
 surfaces
 may
 be
 linked
 to
 the
 differ-
ent
 distribution
 of
 the
 Ti3+ excess
 charge
 in
 the
 near-surface
 region
of
 these
 crystals.
 Filled-state
 STM
 images
 published
 by
 Minato
et
 al.
 [29]
 suggest
 that
 the
 polaronic
 distortions
 on
 h-TiO2(1
 1
 0)
are
 smaller
 than
 that
 on
 r-TiO2(1
 1
 0)
 surfaces.
 Taking
 addition-
ally
 into
 account
 that
 the
 density
 of
 Had species
 on
 h-TiO2(1
 1
 0)
is
 about
 twice
 as
 high
 as
 the
 density
 of
 Obr vacancies
 on
 the
 corre-
sponding
 r-TiO2(1
 1
 0)
 surface,
 it
 is
 very
 likely
 that
 the
 Ti3+ excess
charge
 on
 h-TiO2(1
 1
 0)
 surfaces
 is
 distributed
 much
 more
 homo-
geneously
 than
 on
 r-TiO2(1
 1
 0)
 surfaces.
 An
 additional
 factor
 that
may
 be
 of
 relevance
 when
 discussing
 the
 line
 shape
 of
 the
 O2-TPD
spectra
 is
 the
 high
 mobility
 of
 Had species
 on
 h-TiO2(1
 1
 0)
 surfaces
[17].
 Because
 of
 the
 high
 mobility
 of
 the
 Had species
 on
 the
 surface,
a
 homogeneous
 distribution
 of
 the
 excess
 charge
 can
 be
 main-
tained
 on
 h-TiO2(1
 1
 0),
 even
 when
 the
 temperature
 of
 the
 crystal
is
 increased
 within
 a
 TPD
 experiment.
 On
 the
 contrary,
 upon
 heat-
ing
 of
 O2 exposed
 r-TiO2(1
 1
 0)
 surfaces,
 the
 Ti3+ excess
 charge
 is
expected
 to
 be
 distributed
 rather
 inhomogeneously
 because
 highly
mobile
 charge
 carriers
 that
 are
 able
 to
 diffuse
 across
 the
 surface
 do
not
 exist
 on
 r-TiO2(1
 1
 0).
 Note
 that
 the
 desorption
 of
 O2 molecules
between
 ∼360
 K
 and
 at
 ∼450
 K
 can
 be
 best
 understood
 by
 consid-
ering
 the
 available
 excess
 charge
 in
 the
 near-surface
 region:
 O2
molecules
 desorb
 from
 the
 crystal
 surface
 when
 Ti3+ excess
 charge
is
 lacking
 [30].
 Because
 Ti
 interstitials
 diffuse
 towards
 the
 sur-
face
 upon
 heating
 of
 O2-exposed
 r-TiO2(1
 1
 0)
 surfaces
 where
 they
react
 with
 the
 oxygen
 species,
 the
 Ti3+ excess
 charge
 is
 depleted
in
 the
 near-surface
 region
 [30,45].  Upon
 formation
 of
 TiOx islands
on
 the
 terraces,
 the
 Ti3+ excess
 charge
 depletes
 because
 the
 main
charge
 donors
 –
 the
 Ti
 interstitials
 –
 are
 consumed,
 and
 reﬁlling
of
 interstitials
 sites
 in
 the
 near-surface
 region
 through
 diffusion
 of
Ti
 interstitial
 from
 deeper
 layers
 begins
 only
 when
 the
 sample
 has
reached
 temperatures
 higher
 than
 400
 K
 [13].
3.2.
 Appearance
 of
 Oot adatoms
 in
 the
 STM
 images
Fig.
 3
 shows
 two
 examples
 of
 oxidized
 TiO2(1
 1
 0)
 surfaces
 that
were
 prepared
 in
 different
 ways.
 Whereas
 the
 STM
 image
 dis-
played
 in
 Fig.
 3a
 was
 obtained
 after
 25
 L
 O2 at
 140
 K,
 the
 STM
 image
displayed
 in
 Fig.
 3b
 was
 acquired
 after
 oxidation
 at
 RT.
 In
 both
oxidation
 experiments,
 new
 protrusions
 have
 appeared
 in
 the
 Ti
troughs
 that
 arise
 from
 Oot adatoms
 [13,17,30,32,34,41,44,46,48].
Whereas
 isolated
 Oot adatoms
 are
 prevailing
 after
 O2 exposure
 at
LT,
 some
 of
 the
 Oot adatoms
 occur
 in
 pairs
 on
 next-nearest
 5f-Ti
sites
 [p(2)-Oot pairs]
 after
 O2 exposure
 at
 RT.
 To
 clearly
 distinguish
between
 the
 different
 preparations
 we
 will
 in
 the
 following
 desig-
nate
 TiO2(1
 1
 0)
 surfaces
 prepared
 by
 O2 exposure
 at
 LT
 (110–150
 K)
as
 o-TiO2(1
 1
 0).
On
 o-TiO2(1
 1
 0)
 surfaces,
 the
 Oot adatoms
 are
 created
 exclu-
sively
 via
 dissociation
 of
 O2 molecules
 at
 Obr vacancies,
 i.e.,
 the
 1st
O2 dissociation
 channel
 [41,46–48].
 Because
 the
 diffusion
 of
 Oot
adatoms
 along
 the
 Ti
 troughs
 is
 kinetically
 hindered
 at
 LT
 [17,41],
a
 one-to-one
 correlation
 is
 expected
 between
 the
 Obr vacancies
before
 and
 the
 Oad adatoms
 after
 the
 O2 exposure.
 For
 low-reduced
TiO2(1
 1
 0)
 crystals
 this
 expectation
 is
 indeed
 fulﬁlled
 [30].
 In
 con-
trast,
 when
 exposing
 r-TiO2(1
 1
 0)
 surfaces
 to
 O2 at
 RT,
 the
 2nd
 O2
dissociation
 channel
 is
 in
 play
 as
 well,
 leading
 to
 the
 occurrence

 cannot

 and,

 the

 (see

 of

with
 line
 proﬁles
 through
 two
 Oot adatoms
 in
 the
 Ti

 that
 are
separated
 by
 one
 to
 four
 lattice
 distances.
 An

 of
 an

Oot pair
 is

 together
 with
 another
 pair
 wherein
the
 Oot adatoms
 are

 pairs
 are
 presented
 in
 Fig.

 and

 and
 IV,
 respectively,
 where
 two
 consecutive
 STM
 images
 are
depicted.
 The
 consecutive
 STM
 images
 were
 acquired
 at
 ∼110
 K,
but
 the
 O2 exposure
 was
 accomplished
 at
 RT
 in
 this
 experiment.
In
 addition
 to
 the
 p(2)-Oot pair
 seen
 in
 Fig.

 I
 the
 STM
 images
in
 Fig.

 and

 show
 nearest-neighbor
 Oot adatom
 pairs
 [p(1)-Oot

 that
 appear
 in
 the
 STM

 as
 dumbbell-shaped
 protru-
sions
 and
 that
 are
 indicated
 by

 Both
 the
 p(1)-Oot

 and
 the

 are
 the
 product
 of
 the
 2nd
 O2 dissoci-
ation
 channel
 that
 is
 not
 associated
 with
 Obr vacancies
 (see
 below
and
 Refs.
 [13,30,44,45,47]).
 For
 direct
 comparison,
 an
 isolated
 Oot
adatom
 is
 also
 seen
 in
 Fig.
 4b
 and
 c,
 cf.
 the
 stars.
Line
 proﬁles
 in
 the
 [0
 0

 direction
 taken
 from
 the
 STM
 image
shown
 in
 Fig.
 4a
 are
 displayed
 in
 Fig.
 4d,
 while
 line
 proﬁles
 taken
from
 Fig.
 4b
 and
 c
 are
 displayed
 in
 Fig.
 4e.
 As
 indicated
 by
 dot-
ted
 lines
 in
 the
 STM
 images,
 all
 the
 line
 proﬁles
 were
 taken
 along
the
 Ti
 troughs
 and
 labeled
 using
 Roman
 numbers,
 I–IV.
 From
 the
examples
 shown
 in
 Fig.
 4
 it
 is
 clear
 that
 the
 Oot adatoms
 separated
by
 three
 lattice
 spaces
 [p(3)-Oot pairs,
 II]
 show
 up
 brighter
 in
 the
STM
 images
 than
 Oot adatoms
 in
 p(2)-Oot pairs
 (I).
 Likewise,
 the
line
 proﬁles
 displayed
 in
 Fig.
 4d
 show
 that
 Oot adatoms
 in
 p(1)-Oot
pairs
 (III)
 appear
 with
 much
 lower
 heights
 in
 the
 STM
 images
 than
those
 occurring
 in
 p(2)-Oot pairs
 (IV).
 Note
 that
 the
 apparent
 STM
height
 of
 an
 isolated
 Oot adatom
 (four
 lattice
 distances
 to
 the
 closest
Oot adatom)
 is
 about
 twice
 that
 of
 the
 Oot adatoms
 in
 the
 p(2)-Oot
pairs
 (Fig.
 4e).
 Clearly,
 if
 another
 Oot adatom
 is
 adsorbed
 close
 by
 in
the
 same
 Ti
 trough
 an
 Oot adatom
 appears
 less
 intense
 in
 the
 STM
images
 than
 an
 isolated
 Oot adatom.
Comparing
 the
 consecutive
 STM
 images
 displayed
 in
 Fig.
 4b
 and
c,
 respectively,
 it
 is
 seen
 that
 the
 Oot adatom
 on
 the
 right-hand
 side
of
 pair
 III
 has
 diffused
 one
 lattice
 distance
 away
 from
 the
 Oot adatom
on
 the
 left.
 Consequently,
 pair
 IV
 in
 Fig.
 4c
 appears
 as
 p(2)-Oot pair.
When
 scanning
 on
 this
 surface
 at
 low
 temperature
 (∼110
 K),
 we
only
 rarely
 observed
 the
 diffusion
 of
 Oot adatoms.
 Therefore,
 we
believe
 that
 the
 Coulomb
 repulsion
 between
 nearest-neighbor
 Oot
adatoms
 in
 the
 p(1)-Oot pair
 as
 well
 as
 the
 interaction
 between
the
 STM
 tip
 and
 the
 surface
 has
 induced
 the
 diffusion
 of
 this
 Oot
adatom.
According
 to
 a
 Bader
 charge
 analysis
 reported
 in
 [13],
 an
 iso-
lated
 Oot adatom
 withdraws
 ∼0.8
 e−from
 the
 TiO2(1
 1
 0)
 substrate.
However,
 when
 the
 Oot adatoms
 occur
 in
 pairs,
 less
 charge
 is
 with-
drawn
 per
 Oot adatom
 from
 the
 substrate,
 because
 excess
 charge
is
 scarce
 on
 the
 TiO2(1
 1
 0)
 surface.
 This
 may
 explain
 why
 the
 Oot
adatoms
 appear
 less
 intense
 in
 the
 STM
 images
 if
 another
 Oot
adatom
 is
 adsorbed
 close
 by.
 Nevertheless,
 the
 results
 summarized
in
 Fig.
 4
 further
 underline
 the
 now
 well-established
 fact
 that
 the
STM
 images
 obtained
 on
 rutile
 TiO2(1
 1
 0)
 are
 strongly
 inﬂuenced
by
 electronic
 effects
 [4,65].
Fig.
 5
 shows
 further
 examples
 of
 o-TiO2(1
 1
 0)
 surfaces
 with
p(1)-Oot pairs
 (white
 ovals).
 The
 STM
 image
 depicted
 in
 Fig.
 5a
 was
acquired
 on
 a
 TiO2(1
 1
 0)
 crystal
 (Obr vacancy
 density
 ∼9%
 ML)
 that
was
 exposed
 to
 6
 L
 O2 at
 ∼120
 K
 and
 subsequently
 heated
 up
 to
∼266
 K.
 Following
 this
 preparation
 recipe,
 p(1)-Oot pairs
 appeared
on
 the
 surface.
 This
 result
 conﬁrms
 that
 O2 molecules
 are
 stabilized
on
 the
 o-TiO2(1
 1
 0)
 surface
 and
 that
 the
 2nd
 channel
 is
 a
 thermally
activated
 process
 [30].
 We  add
 that
 the
 adjacent
 Oot adatoms
 in
the
 STM
 image
 depicted
 in
 Fig.
 5a
 are
 very
 well
 resolved,
 which
 is
caused
 by
 a
 special
 state
 of
 the
 tip
 apex;
 most
 likely,
 the
 STM
 tip
had
 picked
 up
 an
 O
 or
 H
 atom
 from
 the
 surface,
 which
 led
 to
 the
increase
 in
 resolution.
 For
 a
 direct
 comparison
 between
 STM
 images
acquired
 with
 a
 special
 and
 with
 a
 normal
 tip
 apex
 we
 present
 in
Fig.
 5b
 and
 c
 two
 examples
 from
 the
 same
 original
 data
 ﬁle
 from
which
 the
 STM
 image
 in
 Fig.
 5a
 was
 selected,
 both
 showing
 pro-
trusions
 originating
 from
 p(1)-Oot pairs.
 We  can
 easily
 distinguish
whether
 we  are
 scanning
 with
 a
 bare
 tungsten
 tip
 or
 with
 a
 spe-
cial
 tip
 apex,
 because
 the
 tip
 changes
 that
 occur
 while
 scanning
 are
obvious.
3.3.
 Effect
 of
 the
 reduction
 state
 on
 the
 dissociative
 adsorption
 of
O2 at
 low
 temperatures
The
 STM
 data
 summarized
 in
 Fig.
 6
 illustrate
 the
 inﬂuence
 of
 the
crystal
 reduction
 state
 on
 the
 dissociation
 of
 O2 on
 r-TiO2(1
 1
 0)
 sur-
faces
 at
 LT
 (110–150
 K).
 In
 the
 STM
 studies,
 the
 Obr vacancy
 density
was
 used
 as
 a
 measure
 of
 the
 bulk
 reduction
 state.
 The
 TiO2(1
 1
 0)
crystals
 are
 classiﬁed
 as
 low-,
 medium-
 and
 high-reduced
 for
 Obr
vacancy
 densities
 of
 2–6%
 ML,
 6–9%
 ML,
 and
 9–12%
 ML,
 respec-
tively.
 In
 the
 experiments
 corresponding
 to
 Fig.
 6a–c
 we
 started
with
 r-TiO2(1
 1
 0)
 surfaces
 characterized
 by
 Obr vacancy
 densities
of
 ∼4.3%
 ML,
 ∼7.9%
 ML,
 and
 ∼10.6%
 ML,
 respectively.
Following
 O2 exposure
 at
 LT,
 Oot adatoms
 were
 found
 on
 all
three
 surfaces,
 as
 expected.
 However,
 the
 density
 of
 Oot adatoms
was
 only
 comparable
 with
 the
 density
 of
 Obr vacancies
 when
the
 crystal
 was
 in
 a
 low-reduced
 state
 (cf.
 Fig.
 6e).
 For
 medium-
and
 high-reduced
 TiO2(1
 1
 0)
 crystals
 the
 Oot densities
 are
 smaller
than
 the
 corresponding
 Obr vacancy
 densities.
 Speciﬁcally,
 for
 the
medium-reduced
 TiO2(1
 1
 0)
 crystal
 corresponding
 to
 Fig.
 6b
 we
found
 0.7
 ±

 whereas
 for
 the

 crystal
 corresponding
 to
 Fig.
 6c
 even
 1.8
 ±
 0.3%
ML  remain
 unﬁlled
 (cf.
 Fig.

 This
 indicates
 that
 some
 of
 the
 Obr
vacancies
 persisted
 the
 oxidation
 on
 medium-
 and
 high-reduced
TiO2(1
 1
 0)
 crystals.
 In
 addition,
 we
 found
 after
 oxidation
 of
 the
high-reduced
 TiO2(1
 1
 0)
 crystal
 at
 120
 K
 that
 some
 of
 the
 Oot
adatoms
 appear
 in
 p(1)-Oot pairs
 (cf.
 the
 hatched
 area
 in
 the
 bar
graph
 corresponding
 to
 Fig.
 6c).
 Note
 that
 p(1)-Oot pairs
 have
 been
observed
 previously
 only
 after
 oxidation
 at
 signiﬁcantly
 higher
temperatures
 [30].
 Our
 statistical
 analysis
 presented
 in
 Ref.
 [30]
revealed
 that
 the
 p(1)-Oot and
 p(2)-Oot pairs
 obtained
 after
 O2
exposure
 at
 temperatures
 higher
 than
 150–180
 K
 are
 the
 product
of
 O2 dissociation
 in
 the
 Ti
 troughs,
 because
 the
 total
 density
 of
Oot adatoms
 on
 the
 surface
 has
 been
 found
 to
 be
 higher
 than
 the
Obr vacancy
 densities
 before
 the
 oxidation.
 In
 contrast,
 in
 the
 STM
experiment
 corresponding
 to
 Fig.
 6c
 and
 d
 we
 are
 facing
 a
 different
situation.
 In
 this
 experiment
 the
 densities
 of
 Oot adatoms
 and
 Obr
vacancies
 together
 are
 smaller
 than
 the
 Obr vacancy
 density
 before
the
 O2 exposure.
We
 have
 checked
 whether
 the
 p(1)-Oot pairs
 found
 on
 the
 high-
reduced
 TiO2(1
 1
 0)
 crystal
 are
 the
 product
 of
 O2 dissociation
 events
of
 separate
 O2 molecules
 at
 nearby
 Obr vacancies
 (1st
 O2 dissocia-
tion
 channel),
 or
 whether
 O2 molecules
 dissociate
 directly
 in
 the
 Ti
troughs
 (2nd
 O2 dissociation
 channel)
 [70].
 At
 LT,
 dissociation
 of
 O2
molecules
 at
 Obr vacancy
 sites
 lead
 preferentially
 to
 Oot adatoms
at
 a
 Ti
 sites
 right
 next
 to
 the
 vacancies
 [41,46,47].
 The
 probability
that
 two
 Oot adatoms
 are
 created
 in
 nearest-neighbor
 sites
 can
 be
deduced
 from
 the
 initial
 distribution
 of
 Obr vacancies
 and
 by
 con-
sidering
 the
 starting
 conﬁgurations
 that
 can
 lead
 to
 the
 formation
of
 p(1)-Oot pairs
 (cf.
 Fig.
 7).
 Conﬁguration
 A
 consists
 of
 two
 adja-
cent
 Obr vacancies
 in
 the
 same
 row,
 while
 conﬁguration
 B
 consists
of
 two
 Obr vacancies
 in
 adjacent
 positions
 in
 adjacent

 Assum-
ing
 that
 all
 the
 dissociation
 events
 are
 independent,
 each
 of
 the
 four
possible
 pathways
 of
 Oot adatom
 pair
 formation
 has
 a
 probability
of
 0.25.

By
 analyzing
 a
 series
 of
 STM
 images
 acquired
 on
 medium-high
reduced
 TiO2(1
 1
 0)
 crystals
 prior
 to
 O2 exposure
 we
 found
 that
 con-
ﬁguration
 A
 does
 not
 occur
 [70].
 This
 is
 probably
 due
 to
 a
 strong
repulsion
 between
 the
 Obr vacancies
 along
 the
 Obr rows.
 Thus,
conﬁguration
 A
 can
 be
 ruled
 out
 as
 a
 possible
 starting
 situation
for
 the
 formation
 of
 p(1)-Oot pairs.
 On
 the
 contrary,
 the
 density
of
 Obr vacancy
 pairs
 in
 conﬁguration
 B
 add
 up
 to
 a
 coverage
 of
0.85%
 ML  for
 the
 medium-reduced
 TiO2(1
 1
 0)
 crystals
 and
 1.8%
ML
 for
 high-reduced
 ones.
 However,
 the
 density
 of
 p(1)-Oot pairs
(here
 given
 as
 the
 density
 of
 pairs
 and
 not
 as
 the
 density
 of
 Oot
adatoms)
 amounts
 to
 ∼0.0%
 ML
 and
 ∼0.6%
 ML  for
 the
 medium-
and
 high-reduced
 crystals,
 respectively.
 Assuming
 identical
 prob-
ability
 of
 the
 p(1)-Oot pair
 formation
 starting
 from
 conﬁguration
 B
in
 both
 cases,
 the
 striking
 difference
 in
 the
 density
 of
 p(1)-Oot pairs
found
 for
 medium-
 and
 high-reduced
 TiO2(1
 1
 0)
 crystals
 indicates
that
 conﬁguration
 B
 can
 be
 ruled
 out
 as
 a
 possible
 starting
 situ-
ation
 for
 the
 formation
 of
 p(1)-Oot pairs
 on

 lead
 to
 the
 Oot adatoms
 found
 experimentally,
 we
 can
 rule
 out
that
 the
 p(1)-Oot pairs
 are
 created
 through
 the
 1st
 O2 dissociation
channel.
 We  thus
 conclude
 that
 on

 crys-
tals
 some
 of
 the
 O2 molecules
 dissociate
 directly
 in
 the
 Ti
 troughs,
even
 at
 120
 K.
 In
 other
 words,
 the
 2nd
 O2 dissociation
 channel
 is
responsible
 for
 the
 formation
 of
 p(1)-Oot pairs
 in
 spite
 of
 the
 low
adsorption
 temperature.
 This
 means
 that
 the
 activation
 barrier
 for
O2 dissociation
 in
 the
 Ti
 troughs
 (2nd
 O2 dissociation
 channel)
decreases
 strongly
 with
 increasing
 reduction
 state
 of
 the
 crystal,
a
 conclusion
 that
 is
 in
 excellent
 agreement
 with
 DFT
 calculations
[13].

 The

 with
 increas-
ing
 bulk
 reduction,
 but
 the
 density
 of

 increases
 as
 well.
 For

surfaces
 (initial

 it
 appears
 that
sat(Oot)

 Based
 on

 experiments
 we  know
 that
 the

 used
in
 the

 studies
 were
 high
 enough
 to
 saturate

 that

 Of
 course,
 sat(Oot)
 depends
 on
 the
 available
 charge
 on
 the
surface.
 As
 further
 discussed
 below,
 this
 charge
 stems
 essentially
from
 the
 near-surface
 region,
 i.e.,
 the
 crystal
 reduction
 state
 is
 an
essential
 factor
 that
 needs
 to
 be
 taken
 into
 consideration.
 Addition-
ally,
 it
 should
 be
 considered
 that
 also
 O2 molecules
 are
 adsorbed
on
 o-TiO2(1
 1
 0)
 surfaces
 [10,30,46–48],
 and
 that
 Oot adatoms
 and
O2 molecules
 compete
 for
 the
 electronic
 charge
 [16,30].  There-
fore,
 sat(Oot)
 at
 LT
 is
 also
 inﬂuenced
 by
 coadsorbed
 O2 molecules.
Because
 the
 O2 molecules
 are
 difﬁcult
 to
 detect
 by
 means
 of
 STM
[30,46–48],
 it
 remains
 to
 be
 resolved
 what
 the
 maximum
 total
coverage
 of
 oxygen
 species,
 sat(oxygen)
 =
 sat(Oot)
 +
 sat(O2),
 is

 that

 not

 (Fig.

 Because
 the
 Oot adatom
 densities
exceed
 the
 corresponding
 densities
 of
 Obr vacancies
 before
 the
 oxi-
dation
 one
 may
 expect
 that
 all
 the
 Obr vacancies
 were
 healed

 this
 is
 not
 the
 case.
 Instead,

 ∼2.2%

 and
 ∼3.0%

 respectively,
 remained
 unﬁlled
 in
spite
 of
 the
 high
 O2 exposures
 and
 the
 relatively
 high
 densities
 of
Oot adatoms
 (Fig.
 9d–f).
 Thus,
 the
 adsorption
 of
 oxygen
 species
 on
TiO2(1
 1
 0)
 is
 limited
 both
 at
 LT
 as
 well
 as
 at
 RT.
 However,
 at
 RT
 and
this
 low
 pressure
 range
 the
 adsorption
 of
 O2 molecules
 is
 unlikely
[10,13,30,44,53]
 and
 the
 2nd

 channel
 is
 in
 opera-
tion
 at
 all
 crystal
 reduction
 states
 [cf.
 the
 p(2)-Oot pairs
 indicated
by

 in
 Fig.

 Because
 of
 the
 self-limitation
 of
 the
O2 dissociation
 reaction
 due
 to
 charge
 depletion,
 and
 because
 Obr
vacancies
 are
 not
 ﬁlled
 via
 the
 2nd
 O2 dissociation
 channel,
 more
Obr vacancies
 remain
 unﬁlled
 at
 RT
 compared
 to
 the
 situation
 when

 are
 exposed
 to

 Annealing
 of
 o-TiO2(1
 1
 0)
 surfaces
We
 now
 turn
 to
 the
 discussion
 of
 STM
 results
 obtained
 after
thermal
 activation
 of
 oxygen
 and
 Ti
 species
 on
 o-TiO2(1
 1
 0).
 Start-
ing
 points
 in
 the
 described
 experiments
 were
 differently
 reduced
TiO2(1
 1
 0)
 crystals
 with
 initial
 Obr vacancy
 densities
 ranging
 from
∼2
 to
 ∼10%
 ML.
 Throughout,
 O2 was
 dosed
 at
 LT.
 Subsequently,
the
 o-TiO2(1
 1
 0)
 surfaces
 were
 annealed
 at
 393
 K
 for
 120
 s.
 Follow-
ing
 this
 preparation
 recipe,
 we
 obtained
 TiO2(1
 1
 0)
 surfaces
 with
Oot adatoms
 and
 small
 TiOx islands
 (Fig.
 10). In
 Fig.
 10a–d
 some
of
 the
 Oot adatoms
 are
 marked
 by
 circles,
 whereas
 some
 of
 the
TiOx islands
 are
 indicated
 by
 hexagons.
 In
 agreement
 with
 previ-
ous
 studies
 [13,30,45],
 the
 prevailing
 TiOx islands
 are
 characterized
by
 an
 apparent
 STM
 height
 of
 ∼2.2 ˚
A.
 Because
 no
 sign
 of
 reduction
was
 observed
 in
 valence
 band
 spectroscopic
 measurements
 after
annealing
 at
 393
 K
 [13],
 most
 of
 the
 TiOx islands
 on
 the
 surfaces
are
 stoichiometric.
 The
 TiOx islands
 are
 the
 result
 of
 Ti
 interstitial
diffusion
 towards
 the
 surface
 where
 they
 react
 with
 Oot adatoms
and
 possibly
 also
 with
 O2 molecules
 [13,30,45].
For
 low-reduced
 TiO2(1
 1
 0)
 surfaces
 (Fig.
 10a and
 b)
 only
 very
few
 TiOx islands
 appeared
 after
 annealing
 at
 393
 K,
 whereas
 a
higher
 density
 of
 TiOx islands
 appeared
 on
 medium-
 and
 high-
reduced
 TiO2(1
 1
 0)
 crystals
 (Fig.
 10c and
 d).
 On
 the
 contrary,
the
 density
 of
 Oot adatoms
 was
 found
 to
 be
 very
 high
 on
 low-
reduced
 TiO2(1
 1
 0)
 surfaces,
 whereas
 low
 densities
 of
 Oot adatoms
were
 evident
 on
 medium-
 and
 high-reduced
 TiO2(1
 1
 0)
 crystals
(Fig.
 10e).
 Fig.
 10e  shows
 the
 ratio,
 R,
 between
 the
 Oot adatom
 den-
sity
 (obtained
 after
 O2 exposure
 at
 LT
 and
 annealing
 at
 393
 K)
 and
the
 initial
 Obr vacancy
 density
 as
 function
 of
 the
 crystal
 reduction
state:
R
 = Oot adatom
 density
 after
 O2 exposure
 at
 LT
 followed
 by
 annealing
 at
 393
 K
 for
 120
 s
initial
 Obr vacancy
 density
For
 low-reduced
 TiO2(1
 1
 0)
 crystals
 we
 found
 R
 >
 2,
 which
 under-
lines
 the
 occurrence
 of
 the
 2nd
 O2 dissociation
 channel.
 However,
between
 5
 and
 6%
 ML
 Obr vacancy
 density
 R
 declines
 strongly,
 and
R
 is
 even
 smaller
 than
 one
 for
 Obr vacancy
 densities
 >6.5%
 ML.
The
 latter
 is
 a
 result
 of
 the
 low
 Oot densities
 found
 for
 medium-
and
 high-reduced
 TiO2(1
 1
 0)
 crystals
 after
 brief
 annealing
 at
 393
 K.
Because
 the
 declining
 density
 of
 Oot adatoms
 with
 higher
 crystal
reduction
 state
 is
 accompanied
 by
 an
 increasing
 density
 of
 TiOx
islands
 (cf.
 Fig.
 10f),
 we
 infer
 that
 the
 decline
 of
 R
 with
 increas-
ing
 reduction
 state
 is
 caused
 by
 enhanced
 Ti
 interstitials
 diffusing
towards
 the
 surface.
 The
 more
 Ti
 interstitials
 react
 with
 oxygen
species,
 Oot adatoms
 and
 O2 molecules,
 respectively,
 the
 more
 TiOx
islands
 are
 formed
 on
 the
 surface
 and
 the
 lower
 is
 the
 density
 of
Oot adatoms.
We
 performed
 two
 additional
 annealing
 experiments
 with
TiO2(1

 crystals
 of
 different
 reduction
 states
 (Fig.

 After

 at

 and
 annealing
 to

we
 observed
 quite
 small
 TiOx islands
 on
 the
 surface
 of
 this
 crystal,
as
 shown
 in
 Fig.

 The
 height
 of
 the
 obtained
 TiOx islands
is,
 in
 average,
 ∼3 ˚
A,
 and
 the
 length
 in

 ∼8 ˚

 The

 of
 this
 type
 was
 performed
 on
 a
 high-reduced
TiO2(1

 crystal
 (Obr vacancy
 density
 ∼10%

 cf.
 Fig.
 11b and
d.
 Clearly,
 the
 TiOx islands
 formed
 on
 the
 surface
 of
 this
 crystal
are
 larger
 than
 that
 found
 on
 the
 low-reduced
 TiO2(1
 1
 0)
 crystal.
The
 apparent
 STM
 height
 of
 the
 TiOx islands
 on
 the
 high-reduced
TiO2(1
 1
 0)
 crystal
 is,
 in
 average,
 ∼4 ˚
A,
 and
 the
 length
 of
 the
 TiOx
islands
 is
 ∼12 ˚
A.
 These
 results
 conﬁrm
 that
 more
 oxygen
 species
react
 with
 high-reduced
 TiO2(1

 0)
 crystals,
 forming
 larger
 TiOx
islands
 on
 the
 surface,
 than
 on
 low-reduced

 The
results
 presented
 in
 Figs.

 and

 are
 in
 excellent
 agreement
 with
previous
 data
 reported
 by
 Li
 et
 al.
 [39,40].  In
 Ref.
 [39]
 it
 has
 been
reported
 that
 the
 adstructures
 obtained
 after
 annealing
 in
 oxygen
depend
 very
 much
 on
 the
 sample
 history,
 i.e.,
 on
 the
 reduction
 state
of
 the
 TiO2(1

 crystal.

 Effect
 of
 the
 reduction
 state
 on
 the
 O2 desorption

∼360
 K
 and

Fig.

 summarizes
 O2-TPD
 spectra
 all
 obtained
 from
 the
 same
sample,
 but
 with
 the
 TiO2(1
 1
 0)
 crystal
 in
 different
 reduction
 states.
In
 its
 low-
 and
 medium-reduced
 state
 (Fig.
 12a),
 the
 maximum
O2 desorption
 occurred
 at
 ∼410
 K
 (-peak),
 and
 a
 shoulder
 was
evident
 at
 ∼386
 K
 (-peak).
 However,
 when
 the
 TiO2(1
 1
 0)
 crystal
was
 high-reduced
 (Fig.
 12b),
 the
 -peak
 was
 more
 intense
 than
 the
-peak.
 Considering
 the
 STM
 data
 presented
 above,
 this
 change
of
 the
 line
 shape
 of
 the
 O2-TPD
 spectra
 between
 low/medium-
and
 high-reduced
 TiO2(1
 1
 0)
 crystals
 may
 be
 rationalized.
 The
STM
 data
 shown
 in
 Fig.
 10
 revealed
 that
 the
 formation
 of
 TiOx
islands
 (x
 ∼
 2)
 begins
 on
 low-
 and
 medium-reduced
 TiO2(1
 1
 0)
crystals
 at
 slightly
 higher
 temperature
 than
 on
 high-reduced
 crys-
tals.
 Concomitantly,
 the
 maximum
 O2 desorption
 on
 such
 crystals
occurs
 predominantly
 at
 the
 high
 temperature,
 ∼410
 K.
 On
 the
contrary,
 on
 high-reduced
 TiO2(1
 1
 0)
 crystals
 that
 are
 character-
ized
 by
 large
 terraces
 the
 formation
 of
 TiOx islands
 occurs
 already
at
 slightly
 lower
 temperatures,
 concomitant
 with
 the
 desorption
of
 O2 molecules
 predominantly
 in
 the
 -peak
 at
 ∼386
 K,
 i.e.,
 at
slightly
 lower
 temperature
 than
 on
 low-
 and
 medium-reduced
TiO2(1
 1
 0)
 crystals.
 That
 two
 peaks
 occur
 in
 the
 O2-TPD
 spectra
could
 be
 related
 to
 the
 fact
 that
 the
 diffusion
 of
 Ti
 interstitials
towards
 the
 surface
 is
 easier
 beneath
 central
 areas
 of
 the
 ter-
races
 than
 beneath
 surface
 regions
 in
 the
 proximity
 to
 the
 step
edges.
 Interestingly,
 electron
 paramagnetic
 resonance
 (EPR)
 mea-
surements
 by
 Aono
 and
 Hasiguti
 [71]
 suggested
 that
 Ti
 interstitials
tend
 to
 cluster
 into
 pairs
 or
 even
 larger
 arrangements
 of
 Ti
 inter-
stitials.
 It
 is
 possible
 that
 the
 Ti
 interstitial
 diffusion
 towards
 the
surface
 is
 facilitated
 if
 they
 occur
 in
 such
 clusters.
 Thus,
 the
 change
in
 the
 line
 shape
 of
 the
 O2-TPD
 spectra
 between
 low/medium-
 and
high-reduced
 TiO2(1
 1
 0)
 crystals
 may
 be
 rationalized
 invoking
 an
enhanced
 occurrence
 of
 Ti
 interstitials
 in
 clusters
 for
 high-reduced
TiO2(1
 1
 0)
 crystals.
 However,
 because
 the
 number
 of
 possible
defect
 conﬁgurations
 in
 the
 bulk
 is
 very
 large,
 our
 interpretation
of
 the
 double-peak
 structure
 in
 the
 O2-TPD
 spectra
 remains
 some-
what
 speculative.

of

 For
 a

 complete

 of

 we
 additionally
 show
 the
 chosen

 (Fig.

 Furthermore,
 Fig.

 shows
 the
 obtained

 (Fig.

 the
 Obr vacancy
 density
 (Fig.

 and
 the
integrated
 area
 of
 the
 Ti
 3d
 defect
 state
 (Fig.

 as
 function
 of
the
 applied
 preparation
 cycles.
 With
 the
 exception
 of
 the
 Ti
 3d
defect
 state
 areas,
 which
 are
 a
 direct
 measure
 of
 the
 Ti3+ excess
charge,
 all
 the
 data
 displayed
 in
 Fig.
 13
 were
 acquired
 using
 the
same
 TiO2(1
 1
 0)
 crystal.
 The
 Ti
 3d
 defect
 state
 measurements
 were
obtained
 on
 a
 different
 crystal
 that
 was
 prepared
 following
 simi-
lar
 preparation
 procedures.
 The
 reduction
 state
 of
 rutile
 TiO2(1
 1
 0)
crystals
 prepared
 under
 UHV
 conditions
 was
 found
 to
 depend
 both
on
 the
 number
 of
 preparation
 cycles
 and
 the
 chosen
 annealing
 tem-
perature.
 During
 the
 ﬁrst
 10
 preparation
 cycles
 the
 temperature
 of
∼823
 K
 during
 annealing
 was
 kept
 constant
 until
 it
 was
 possible
 to
acquire
 STM
 images
 of
 high
 quality.
 Upon
 further
 reduction
 of
 the
crystal
 we
 increased
 the
 annealing
 temperature
 in
 steps
 of
 10
 K
 on
average
 after
 each
 5
 cycles
 in
 order
 to
 obtain/maintain
 TiO2(1
 1
 0)
surfaces
 with
 large
 terraces
 width.
 Upon
 sample
 reduction,
 both
the
 Obr vacancy
 density
 (Fig.
 13d)
 as
 well
 as
 the
 integrated
 area
 of
the
 Ti
 3d
 defect
 state
 (Fig.
 13e)
 increase.
 Thus,
 a
 correlation
 exists
between
 surface
 reduction
 (probed
 by
 STM)
 and
 the
 reduction
 of
the
 near-surface
 region
 (probed
 by
 valence
 band
 PES).
 In
 retrospec-
tive,
 these
 results
 justify
 the
 use
 of
 the
 Obr vacancy
 density
 as
 a
measure
 of
 the
 bulk
 reduction
 state
 (see
 above).
 It
 should
 be
 noted,
however,
 that
 much
 care
 must
 be
 taken
 to
 interpret
 the
 correla-
tion
 between
 the
 integrated
 area
 of
 the
 Ti
 3d
 defect
 state
 and
 the
Obr vacancy
 density
 correctly
 [13,72].
 More
 speciﬁcally,
 alone
 from
the
 fact
 that
 a
 correlation
 seems
 to
 exists
 between
 the
 Ti
 3d
 defect
state
 and
 the
 Obr vacancy
 density
 does
 not
 allow
 one
 to
 deduce
what
 the
 origin
 of
 the
 Ti
 3d
 defect
 state
 is.
 The
 results
 displayed
 in
Fig.
 13d
 and
 e
 are
 not
 surprising
 because
 we
 simultaneously
 altered
the
 bulk-
 and
 surface
 reduction
 state.
In
 the
 O2-TPD
 experiments
 corresponding
 to
 the
 O2-TPD
 peak
areas
 plotted
 in
 Fig.
 13a  we
 used
 both
 r-
 and
 h-TiO2(1
 1
 0)
 surfaces,
and
 in
 either
 case
 the
 surface
 was
 saturated
 with
 O2 at
 ∼130
 K.
The
 O2-TPD
 peak
 areas
 can
 be
 compared
 for
 r-
 and
 h-TiO2(1
 1
 0)
surfaces,
 because
 equal
 amounts
 of
 O2 desorb
 from
 the
 surface
provided
 that
 the
 bulk-reduction,
 the
 surface
 morphology
 and
 the
adsorption
 temperatures
 are
 comparable
 (cf.
 Fig.
 2).
 During
 the
ﬁrst
 40
 preparation
 cycles
 the
 amount
 of
 O2 that
 desorbs
 between
∼360
 K
 and
 at
 ∼450
 K
 increases,
 and
 a
 maximum
 is
 observed
 for
the
 40th
 cycle.
 Upon
 further
 reduction
 of
 the
 crystal,
 the
 amount
of
 desorbing
 O2 declines.
 This
 is
 a
 remarkable
 result
 that
 cannot
 be
explained
 within
 O2 adsorption
 models
 wherein
 surface
 defects,
Obr vacancies
 and
 Had species,
 respectively,
 are
 proposed
 as
 the
main
 charge
 donors,
 enabling
 O2 adsorption
 on
 the
 surface.
 If
 the
O2 molecules
 were
 adsorbed
 on
 the
 surface
 essentially
 through
charge
 transfer
 from
 surface
 defects
 the
 amount
 of
 desorbing
 O2
should
 scale
 directly
 with
 the
 density
 of
 Obr vacancies
 and
 Had
species.
 However,
 the
 decline
 of
 the
 O2-TPD
 peak
 area
 for
 crys-
tal
 reduction
 states
 obtained
 after
 the
 application
 of
 more
 than
40
 preparation
 cycles
 can
 be
 understood
 when
 O2 adsorption
 on
reduced
 TiO2(1
 1
 0)
 crystals
 is
 enabled
 through
 charge
 transfer
 from
defects
 in
 the
 near-surface
 region
 [49].
On
 low-reduced
 TiO2(1
 1
 0)
 crystals
 only
 a
 small
 amount
 of
 O2
adsorbs,
 i.e.,
 the
 amount
 of
 desorbing
 O2 at
 ∼410
 K
 is
 limited
 by
the
 O2 adsorption
 at
 130
 K.
 With
 increasing
 bulk-reduction
 of
 the
crystal
 more
 Ti3+ excess
 charge
 is
 available
 on
 the
 TiO2(1
 1
 0)
 sur-
face,
 and
 thus
 more
 O2 adsorbs.
 As
 a
 result,
 the
 O2-TPD
 peak
 at
∼410
 K
 increases
 initially,
 i.e.,
 during
 the
 ﬁrst
 40
 preparation
 cycles.
We
 know,
 however,
 that
 the
 O2 molecules
 desorbing
 between
∼360
 K
 and
 at
 ∼450
 K
 constitute
 only
 a
 fraction
 of
 the
 O2 molecules
adsorbed
 at
 LT.
 One
 part
 of
 the
 adsorbed
 O2 molecules
 desorbs
between
 ∼130
 K
 and
 ∼360
 K,
 i.e.,
 directly
 after
 starting
 of
 the
temperature
 ramp
 [10,11,30,59],
 and
 another
 part
 is
 lost
 due
 to
O2 dissociation
 (2nd
 channel)
 followed
 by
 TiOx island
 formation.
Therefore,
 the
 amount
 of
 desorbing
 O2 between
 ∼360
 K
 and
 at
∼450
 K
 is
 determined
 by
 two
 variables,
 the
 quantity
 of
 adsorbed
 O2
(at
 130
 K)
 and
 the
 quantity
 of
 the
 O2 loss
 upon
 temperature
 increase
in
 the
 TPD
 experiment.
 When
 the
 crystal
 reduction
 exceeds
 a
 cer-
tain
 degree,
 the
 O2 loss
 upon
 heating
 becomes
 so
 high
 that
 the
residual
 amount
 of
 intact
 O2 molecules
 desorbing
 at
 ∼410
 K
 is
smaller
 than
 on
 o-TiO2(1
 1
 0)
 surfaces
 with
 the
 crystal
 being
 only
 at
medium-reduced.
 This,
 to
 a
 large
 extent,
 explains
 the
 occurrence
of
 a
 maximum
 in
 the
 O2-TPD
 peak
 area
 at
 intermediate
 reduction
states.
The
 utilized
 experimental
 techniques
 did
 not
 allow
 us
 to
 quan-
tify
 sat(O2)
 after
 O2 adsorption
 at
 130
 K.
 Nevertheless,

Ti3+ excess
 charge
 increases
 upon
 sample
 reduction
 (Fig.
 13e),
 it
is
 reasonable
 to
 assume
 that
 sat(O2)
 scales
 with
 the
 crystal
 reduc-
tion
 state.
 However,
 for
 high-reduced
 TiO2(1
 1
 0)
 crystals
 sat(O2)
 is
probably
 sufﬁciently
 high
 so
 that
 the
 Coulombic
 repulsion
 between
the
 O2 molecules
 becomes
 an
 important
 factor
 that
 inhibits
 a
 fur-
ther
 increase
 of
 sat(O2).
 The
 relatively
 small
 values
 for
 sat(Oot),
6.0–8.5%
 ML,
 obtained
 on
 high-reduced
 TiO2(1
 1
 0)
 crystals
 after
 O2
adsorption
 at
 130
 K
 (cf.
 Fig.
 8)
 are
 in
 line
 with
 this
 hypothesis.
 Even
though
 the
 2nd
 O2 dissociation
 channel
 occurs
 on
 high-reduced
TiO2(1
 1
 0)
 crystals
 at
 120
 K
 (cf.
 Fig.
 6)
 no
 further
 increase
 of
 sat(Oot)
was
 observed.
 Rather,
 the
 STM
 data
 summarized
 in
 Fig.
 8
 indicate
that
 sat(Oot)
 is
 declining
 for
 Obr vacancy
 densities
 >10%
 ML
 (see
 the
three
 data
 points
 within
 the
 dotted
 oval).
 This
 result
 is
 consistent
with
 competition
 for
 the
 excess
 charge
 that
 is
 expected
 for
 large
sat(O2).
Assuming
 that
 sat(O2)
 has
 reached
 a
 maximum
 after
 ∼40
 prepa-
ration
 cycles,
 it
 is
 conceivable
 that
 the
 O2-TPD
 peak
 area
 declines,
as
 observed
 experimentally
 (Fig.
 13a).
 The
 fact
 that
 more
 oxygen
species
 react
 with
 high-reduced
 TiO2(1
 1
 0)
 crystals
 upon
 heating
of
 the
 sample
 than
 on
 low-
 and
 medium-reduced
 ones
 as
 observed
by
 STM
 (cf.
 Figs.
 10
 and
 11)  supports
 our
 conclusion
 that
 the
 decline
of
 the
 O2-TPD
 peak
 area
 upon
 further
 reduction
 of
 the
 crystal
 after
40
 preparation
 cycles
 is
 related
 to
 the
 loss
 of
 O2 molecules
 before
O2 desorption
 sets
 in.
 Because
 of
 the
 higher
 amount
 of
 the
 available
excess
 charge
 this
 loss
 of
 O2 molecules
 is
 higher
 on
 high-reduced
crystals
 than
 on
 low-
 and
 medium
 reduced
 ones.
 The
 more
 Ti3+
excess
 charge
 is
 available
 on
 the
 TiO2(1
 1
 0)
 surface
 the
 easier
 are
the
 processes
 that
 lead
 to
 the
 formation
 of
 the
 TiOx islands.
An
 additional
 possible
 reason
 for
 the
 decline
 of
 the
 O2-TPD
 peak
area
 after
 ∼40
 preparation
 cycles
 is
 that
 sat(O2,
 130
 K)
 is
 smaller
 for
high-reduced
 TiO2(1
 1
 0)
 crystals
 than
 for
 medium-reduced
 ones.
This
 hypothesis
 is
 plausible,
 supposed
 we
 assume
 a
 variable
 charge
state
 of
 the
 O2 molecules,
 depending
 on
 the
 crystal
 reduction
 state.
For
 example,
 for
 a
 medium-reduced
 TiO2(1
 1
 0)
 crystal
 the
 prevail-
ing
 charge
 state
 of
 the
 O2 molecules
 might
 be
 −1,
 corresponding
 to
superoxide
 O2 ions,
 as
 has
 been
 suggested
 previously
 [10].
 In
 this
case,
 the
 Coulombic
 repulsion
 between
 the
 O2 molecules
 is
 moder-
ate,
 resulting
 in
 O2 coverage
 at
 130
 K
 on
 o-TiO2(1
 1
 0)
 of
 up
 to
 40%
ML
 [30].
 On
 the
 contrary,
 on
 high-reduced
 TiO2(1
 1
 0)
 crystals
 more
excess
 charge
 is
 available,
 cf.
 Fig.
 13e.
 This
 may
 lead
 to
 a
 situation
where
 the
 prevailing
 charge
 state
 of
 the
 chemisorbed
 O2 molecules
is
 −2,
 corresponding
 to
 peroxo
 O2 ions.
 In
 this
 case
 the
 Coulom-
bic
 repulsion
 between
 the
 O2 molecules
 is
 substantial,
 leading
 to
O2 saturation
 coverage
 that
 are
 smaller
 than
 on
 medium-reduced
TiO2(1
 1
 0)
 crystals.
 Indeed,
 recent
 ultraviolet
 PSD
 experiments
 by
Petrik
 and
 Kimmel
 suggest
 that
 the
 charge
 state
 of
 O2 molecules
is
 variable
 [16],
 rendering
 the
 charge
 state
 of
 the
 chemisorbed
 O2
molecules
 an
 important
 factor
 that
 needs
 to
 be
 considered.
 The
 STM
and
 TPD
 data
 presented
 here
 are
 consistent
 with
 a
 variable
 charge
state
 of
 the
 chemisorbed
 O2 molecules,
 depending
 on
 the
 crystal
reduction
 state.
 We
 consider
 the
 results
 summarized
 in
 Fig.
 13
 as
strong
 indication
 for
 charge
 transfer
 from
 the
 near-surface
 region
to
 chemisorbed
 oxygen
 species.

 Relevance
 to
 applications
 in
 catalysis
 and
 photocatalysis
The
 presented
 study
 has
 implications
 to
 heterogeneous
 catal-
ysis
 since
 TiO2 is
 a
 widely
 used
 support
 for
 metal
 catalysts,
 and
the
 electronic
 state
 of
 the
 TiO2 support
 will
 certainly
 inﬂuence
 the
catalytic
 properties
 of
 the
 metal/oxide
 composite
 catalyst
 [38].
 The
new
 insight
 gained
 here
 is
 also
 useful
 in
 photochemistry
 where
TiO2 is
 electronically
 excited,
 for
 example
 by
 sunlight.
 Depend-
ing
 of
 the
 available
 Ti3+ excess
 charge
 the
 nature
 of
 the
 prevailing
chemisorbed
 oxygen
 species
 may
 change.
 This
 knowledge
 is
 par-
ticularly
 interesting
 for
 applications
 of
 TiO2-based
 materials
 as
E.
 Lira
 et

photo-oxidation
 catalysts.
 Today,
 mechanistic
 insight
 into
 photo-
chemical
 processes
 is
 still
 scarce,
 and
 it
 is
 not
 clear
 yet
 which
oxygen
 species
 is
 the
 main
 player
 in
 photoreactions
 [8,9].
The
 presented
 data
 help
 to
 better
 link
 model
 studies
 performed
under
 UHV
 conditions
 with
 more
 applied
 studies
 in
 the
 ﬁeld
of
 materials
 science.
 For
 example,
 the
 understanding
 of
 why
 O2
molecules
 can
 be
 stabilized
 on
 bulk-reduced
 TiO2(1
 1
 0)
 crystals
and
 desorb
 at
 unusual
 high
 temperatures
 offers
 a
 straightforward
explanation
 of
 how
 O2 molecules
 can
 be
 stabilized
 on
 the
 surfaces
of
 catalysts
 and
 photo-catalysts
 even
 in
 the
 absence
 of
 surface
 O
vacancies:
 The
 O2 molecules
 are
 simply
 stabilized
 through
 charge
transfer
 from
 the
 near-surface
 region
 (ionosorption
 model).
 In
 this
regard
 it
 is
 noteworthy
 that
 striking
 similarities
 exist
 between
 O2-
TPD
 spectra
 obtained
 on
 rutile
 powder
 samples
 [73,74]
 with
 those
measured
 on
 well-characterized
 rutile
 TiO2(1
 1
 0)
 crystals.
 It
 is
also
 noteworthy
 that
 unexpected
 adsorption/desorption
 of
 O2 has
been
 revealed
 for
 TiO2 nanotube
 arrays
 [75],
 and
 further
 that
 even
under
 ambient
 pressure
 a
 narrow
 O2 desorption
 peak
 at
 ∼400
 K
 has
been
 identiﬁed
 in
 TPD
 spectra
 on
 H2O2 treated
 “real”
 TiO2 photo-
catalysts
 [76].
 In
 all
 these
 studies
 [70–73],  it
 is
 unlikely
 that
 surface
O
 vacancies
 persisted
 at
 the
 applied
 high-pressure
 conditions.
In
 this
 light,
 the
 presented
 data
 are
 further
 indication
 that
 sur-
face
 O
 vacancies
 are
 of
 only
 minor
 relevance
 for
 “real”
 catalysts
and
 photo-catalysts
 [32].
 Because
 temperatures
 higher
 than
 500
 K
are
 required
 for
 their
 creation
 [50,77], surface
 O
 vacancies
 are
very
 unlikely
 to
 play
 a
 role
 for
 reaction
 running
 at
 temperatures
lower
 than
 500
 K.
 Alone
 the
 fact
 that
 it
 is
 rather
 difﬁcult
 to
 pro-
duce
 TiO2(1
 1
 0)
 surfaces
 with
 clean
 Obr vacancies
 [r-TiO2(1
 1
 0)]
even
 under
 UHV
 [34,41,78]
 points
 to
 the
 view
 that
 surface
 O
 vacan-
cies
 are
 of
 only
 minor
 relevance
 in
 the
 applications
 of
 TiO2.
 On
 the
contrary,
 bulk-defects
 can
 easily
 persist
 under
 the
 high-pressure
conditions
 at
 which
 catalyzed
 reactions
 and
 photo-reaction
 are
running,
 and
 therefore
 we
 consider
 the
 presence
 of
 charge
 donat-
ing
 bulk-defects
 in
 the
 near-surface
 region
 as
 much
 more
 plausible
explanation
 of
 how
 oxygen
 species
 can
 be
 stabilized
 at
 the
 surfaces
of
 catalysts
 and
 photo-catalysts.
 The
 data
 presented
 here
 may
 also
be
 of
 relevance
 for
 an
 improved
 understanding
 of
 the
 surface
 pro-
cesses
 occurring
 on
 other
 reducible
 oxides
 such
 as
 anatase
 TiO2,
SnO2 and
 ZnO.

 Conclusions
Using
 high-resolution
 STM
 and
 sample
 ensemble
 averaging
techniques
 such
 as
 TPD
 and
 PES
 we
 found
 that
 the
 interaction
 of
O2 with
 TiO2(1
 1
 0)–(1
 ×
 1)
 depends
 strongly
 on
 the
 crystal
 reduc-
tion
 state.
 TiO2(1
 1
 0)
 crystals
 are
 classiﬁed
 as
 low-,
 medium-
 and
high-reduced
 for
 Obr vacancy
 densities
 of
 2–6%
 ML,
 6–9%
 ML,
 and
9–12%
 ML,
 respectively.
 Speciﬁcally,
 we
 found
 that
i)
 the
 energy
 barrier
 for
 the
 2nd,
 non-vacancy-assisted
 O2 disso-
ciation
 channel
 decreases
 with
 increasing
 reduction
 state.
 On
low-and
 medium-reduced
 TiO2(1
 1
 0)
 crystals
 the
 2nd
 O2 disso-
ciation
 channel
 sets
 in
 between
 150
 K
 and
 180
 K
 [30].
 However,
on
 high-reduced
 TiO2(1
 1
 0)
 crystals
 the
 2nd
 O2 dissociation
channel
 sets
 in
 at
 temperatures
 as
 low
 as
 120
 K.
ii)
 an
 upper
 limit
 exists
 for
 the
 density
 of
 Oot adatoms
 that
 can
 be
stabilized
 on
 clean,
 high-reduced
 TiO2(1
 1
 0)–(1
 ×
 1).
 At
 130
 K,
this
 limit
 is
 close
 to
 8%
 ML,
 whereas
 ∼11%
 ML  Oot adatoms
 can
be
 stabilized
 after
 high
 O2 exposure
 at
 RT.
 Some
 Obr vacancies
are
 left
 unﬁlled
 on
 TiO2(1
 1
 0)
 surfaces
 because
 the
 Ti3+ excess
charge
 in
 the
 near-surface
 region
 has
 been
 depleted.
 Because
 Obr
vacancies
 are
 not
 ﬁlled
 via
 the
 2nd
 O2 dissociation
 channel,
 more
Obr vacancies
 remain
 unﬁlled
 at
 RT
 compared
 to
 the
 situation
when
 r-TiO2(1
 1
 0)
 surfaces
 are
 exposed
 to
 O2 at
 110–150
 K.
iii)
 the
 ratio
 between
 the
 Oot adatoms
 obtained
 after
 O2 adsorption
at
 low
 temperature
 followed
 by
 annealing
 at
 393
 K
 and
 the
 initial
density
 of
 Obr vacancies
 declines
 with
 increasing
 reduction
 state.
Simultaneously,
 the
 density
 of
 TiOx islands
 (x
 ∼
 2)
 increases
 after
annealing
 at
 393
 K
 for
 120
 s,
 indicating
 that
 Ti
 interstitial
 diffu-
sion
 is
 slightly
 more
 facile
 in
 high-reduced
 TiO2(1
 1
 0)
 crystals
compared
 to
 low-reduced
 ones.
iv)
 the
 shape
 of
 the
 O2-TPD
 peak
 occurring
 between
 ∼360
 K
 and
∼450
 K
 depends
 on
 the
 crystal
 reduction
 state.
 For
 high-reduced
TiO2(1
 1
 0)
 crystals
 with
 large
 terraces
 most
 O2 molecules
 des-
orb
 at
 ∼386
 K,
 whereas
 O2 desorption
 is
 peaking
 at
 ∼410
 K
 for
low-
 and
 medium-reduced
 crystals.
 However,
 on
 h-TiO2(1
 1
 0)
surfaces
 the
 O2 desorption
 is
 peaking
 at
 ∼410
 K
 regardless
 of
the
 crystal
 reduction
 state.
 This
 observation
 is
 probably
 linked
to
 a
 more
 homogeneous
 distribution
 of
 the
 Ti3+ excess
 charge
in
 the
 near-surface
 region
 of
 h-TiO2(1
 1
 0)
 compared
 to
 the
 sit-
uation
 faced
 on
 r-TiO2(1
 1
 0)
 surfaces.
 On
 r-TiO2(1
 1
 0)
 surfaces,
the
 two
 peaks
 in
 the
 O2-TPD
 spectra
 may
 occur
 because
 the
 Ti
interstitial
 diffusion
 towards
 the
 surface
 is
 easier
 beneath
 cen-
tral
 areas
 of
 the
 terraces
 than
 beneath
 surface
 regions
 in
 the
proximity
 to
 the
 step
 edges.
v) the
 quantity
 of
 O2 desorbing
 between
 ∼360
 K
 and
 ∼450
 K
reaches
 a
 maximum
 at
 intermediate
 crystal
 reduction
 states.
 For
high-reduced
 TiO2(1
 1
 0)
 crystals,
 more
 O2 is
 lost
 upon
 temper-
ature
 increase,
 leading
 to
 a
 decline
 of
 the
 O2-TPD
 peak
 area.
 That
more
 oxygen
 is
 incorporated
 into
 the
 near-surface
 region
 can
 be
rationalized
 by
 a
 lowered
 O2 dissociation
 barrier
 (2nd
 channel),
the
 Ti
 interstitial
 density
 and
 the
 ease
 of
 Ti
 interstitial
 diffusion
 in
high-reduced
 crystals.
 As
 a
 consequence,
 the
 TiOx islands
 (x
 ∼
 2)
found
 on
 high-reduced
 TiO2(1
 1
 0)
 crystals
 are
 larger
 than
 those
found
 on
 low-
 and
 medium-reduced
 crystals.
 An
 additional
 fac-
tor
 that
 may
 contribute
 to
 the
 decline
 of
 the
 O2-TPD
 peak
 area
 is
the
 O2 saturation
 coverage
 at
 130
 K.
 For
 high-reduced
 TiO2(1
 1
 0)
crystals,
 the
 O2 saturation
 coverage
 at
 130
 K
 might
 be
 smaller
than
 that
 on
 medium-reduced
 TiO2(1
 1
 0)
 crystals.
 This
 hypoth-
esis
 is
 plausible,
 supposed
 that
 the
 prevailing
 charge
 state
 of
 the
chemisorbed
 O2 molecules
 is
 different,
 depending
 on
 the
 crystal
reduction
 state.
The
 presented
 data
 conﬁrm
 that
 the
 Ti3+ excess
 charge
 enabling
oxygen
 adsorption
 on
 the
 rutile
 TiO2(1
 1
 0)
 surface
 stems
 predom-
inantly
 from
 sub-surface
 defects
 such
 as
 Ti
 interstitials
 [13,30]
and
 that
 this
 charge
 can
 be
 easily
 transferred
 to
 the
 adsorbates,
even
 at
 130
 K.
 Based
 on
 our
 comprehensive
 studies
 presented
 here
and
 earlier
 [30,49]
 we  ﬁnd
 that
 this
 important
 conclusion
 is
 now
well-documented.
 Surface
 defects
 such
 as
 Obr vacancies
 and
 Had
species
 (OHbr groups)
 alone
 cannot
 account
 for
 all
 the
 phenomena
observed
 for
 differently
 reduced
 TiO2(1
 1
 0)
 crystals.
