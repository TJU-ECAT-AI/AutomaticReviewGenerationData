The rutile TiO2(110) surface has been doped with sub-monolayer
metallic Cr, which oxidises and donates charge to speciﬁc
surface Ti ions. X-Ray and ultra violet photoemission spectro-
scopy and ﬁrst principles density functional theory with Hubbard
U are used to assign the oxidation states of Cr and surface Ti
and we ﬁnd that Cr2+ forms on bridging oxygen ions and a
5-fold coordinated surface Ti atom is reduced to Ti3+ and the
Cr ions readily react with oxygen (to Cr3+), which leads to
depletion of surface Ti3+ 3d electrons.
Introduction
Transition metal oxide surfaces are ubiquitous in numerous
applications such as (photo-) catalysis, gas sensors, optics and
(magneto-) electronics.1–3 Often unique properties or materials
can be produced by engineering interfaces and epitaxial ﬁlms;
for example thin ﬁlms of the metastable CrO2 can be stabilised
on TiO2 substrates.4–10 This material is a half-metallic ferro-
magnet (currently used in magnetic recording tapes11,12) and
shows great promise in spintronics due to high spin polarisa-
tion. Cr-doped TiO2 is also of great interest as a p-type gas
sensor.13–16
To elucidate the atomistic properties of Cr adsorbed at the
TiO2 surface and of the inﬂuence of oxidation on redox
behaviour, a combined ﬁrst principles modelling and experi-
mental approach is needed. We have previously presented a
study of self-doping (Ti adsorption) on rutile TiO2 using a
combination of photoemission spectroscopy and density func-
tional theory, with Hubbard U (DFT + U).17 Recent studies
of reduced TiO2 have demonstrated that hybrid DFT18,19 or
DFT + U17,20 are needed to properly describe reduced Ti.
More standard DFT approaches fail to account for occupied
3d orbitals. DFT + U has also similarly been applied to
describe partially occupied Cr 3d states in Cr2O3
21,22 and
CrO2.23,24
In this paper we investigate, for the ﬁrst time, controlled
doping of the TiO2(110) surface with sub-monolayer Cr
coverages, using photoemission spectroscopy in parallel with
large-scale DFT + U calculations. The coverage in experi-
ment and theory is chosen to match closely. The photo-
emission spectroscopy data indicates the creation of two
distinct defect states in the TiO2 band gap, which are assigned
on the basis of the DFT + U calculations. We ﬁnd that
adsorbed Cr
is oxidised
to Cr2+ reducing one 5-fold
coordinated surface Ti ion to Ti3+ while the remaining
electron is delocalised over neighbouring surface Ti. By
exposing this structure to oxygen we re-oxidise all of the Ti to
Ti4
+ through a strongly preferred adsorption of oxygen only
on the Cr species.
Methods
Experiment
Experiments were performed in a twin chamber UHV system
comprised of a preparation chamber and analyser chamber.
The preparation chamber is equipped with a Cr source (Oxford
Applied Research e-beam evaporator), a Vacuum Generators
low energy electron diﬀraction (LEED) system, a quadropole
mass spectrometer and Ar+ sputtering gun for sample cleaning.
The analyser chamber is constructed from mu metal and
contains a hemispherical electron energy analyser used in
conjunction with an non-monochromated Al Ka X-ray source
(hn = 1486.60 eV) and a helium lamp (hn = 21.21 eV) to
perform X-ray and ultra-violet photoemission spectroscopy
(XPS and He–I UPS). The chambers are separated by a gate
valve to ensure the analyser is never exposed to reactive gases.
The rutile TiO2(110) sample is mounted in Ta foil supported
on high purity W wires. Sample heating is achieved by electron
bombardment (to B1300 K) through a W ﬁlament located
behind the sample and by resistive heating (to B900 K) of the
support wires. A c-type thermocouple is spot welded between
sample and Ta to monitor the temperature. The sample was
prepared through repeated cycles of cold (300 K) 0.6 KeV Ar+
sputtering and annealing to 1000 K in a 1  107 Torr oxygen
atmosphere until a sharp (1  1) pattern was observed in the
LEED.

conﬁrmed
spectro-
scopically by XPS. All experiments were performed on a
starting substrate with a stoichiometry, deﬁned as the percen-
tage of Ti4+ 2p3/2 signal to total Ti 2p3/2 signal, greater than
90%. The Cr was deposited onto the sample (B300 K) at a rate
of B0.4 monolayer (ML) min1 (calibrated by growth on a
W(100) crystal) where 1 ML is equivalent to the surface density
of Ti ions at the surface of TiO2(110). Oxidation of the dosed
surface was achieved by exposing the sample to 1  107 Torr
of high purity oxygen through a ﬁne leak valve. All XPS spectra
are calibrated to the Ti4+ 2p3/2 peak located at 459.0 eV and
UPS spectra to the Fermi level at 0 eV binding energy. Peak
ﬁtting of the spectra is performed using Casa XPS software.25

Modelling
All calculations are carried out in the framework of the
periodic plane wave approach using density functional theory
(DFT) with the VASP code.26 The valence electronic states are
expanded in a basis of periodic plane waves, with an energy
cut-oﬀof 396 eV, while the core-valence interaction is treated
using PAW potentials,27 with an [Ar] core on Ti and Cr and an
[He] core on O. The PW91 exchange–correlation functional28
is used.
The surface is a ﬁnite thickness slab model and slabs along
the z direction (perpendicular to the surface) are separated
with a 10 A
˚ vacuum thickness. A slab with 6 repeat O–Ti–O
units (18 atomic layers) and a (2  4) expansion of the surface
cell is used throughout.17 This surface cell expansion mini-
mises periodic adsorbate–adsorbate interactions and provides
a concentration of adsorbed atoms consistent with the experi-
mental concentration. Cr is adsorbed on one side of the slab
and a dipole correction is added to remove the surface dipole.
k-point sampling is performed at the G-point. Fermi level
smearing is performed, with a width of 0.1 eV, which smooths
the density of states peaks. The Cr atom has a 4s1 3d5
conﬁguration, and calculations are spin polarised.
A key aspect is the description of the electronic structure of
Cr and Ti. Regarding Ti, we17 and others18–20 have shown the
need to go beyond the LDA and GGA exchange correlation
functionals. Thus, we use DFT corrected for on-site Coulomb
interactions, (DFT + U), in all calculations of the adsorbate
structures. From a comparison of experimental XPS and UPS
spectra with DFT + U computations in ref. 17 UTi is set to
3 eV. U is also applied to the Cr adsorbate, since the
partially ﬁlled Cr 3d shell cannot be described with DFT, with
UCr = 3 eV in close accord with the literature value (3.5eV).21
Results
Experiment
The clean TiO2(110) surface was doped with Cr atoms for a
range of coverages (1/30–1.25 ML) and XPS and UPS spectra
recorded. Fig. 1(a) displays Ti 2p3/2 XPS spectra recorded for
the clean surface and that dosed with 1/8 ML Cr ad-atoms.
For Ti 2p3/2 spectra we ﬁt three Gaussian (55%)/Lorentzian
(45%) mixed lineshapes against a Shirley background to
assign the peaks at 459.0, 457.1 and 455.6 eV to the Ti4+
,
Ti3+ and Ti2+ oxidation states, respectively.29 The clean
surface has a stoichiometry of 91% with approximately 8%
of the intensity attributed to the Ti3+ state. Upon adsorption
of Cr atoms, the relative intensity of the Ti4+ peak is reduced
and the intensity in the Ti3+ shoulder increases; no change in
the Ti2+ signal is detected. The reduction in stoichiometry as a
function of the full range Cr coverage is displayed in Fig. 1(b).
Between 0 and 0.5 ML Cr coverage, the stoichiometry of the
TiO2 substrate is reduced from 91% to approximately 60% in
a linear fashion. For Cr coverages’ above 0.5 ML, we observe
a gently reducing stoichiometry indicating that the reduction
of Ti4+ to Ti3+ nears saturation. At this point B40% of the
Ti ions in the XPS probe depth are Ti3+. The inelastic mean
free path of Ti 2p3/2 photoelectrons in TiO2 is B8 ML,29,30
thus it may be concluded that all surface Ti ions have been
reduced to Ti3+ at the 0.5 ML saturation point. This agrees well
with the Cr ML deﬁnition whereby 0.5 ML equates to 1 Cr atom
per surface 5-fold coordinated Ti ion (see DFT + U results).
The eﬀects of the high reactivity and charge transfer at the
Cr/TiO2 interface can be elucidated through examination of
the UPS spectra for these systems. Fig. 2(a) compares the
spectra obtained from the clean TiO2(110) surface and the
1/8 ML Cr doped surface (the re-oxidised doped surface is
discussed later). Individual UPS spectra are ﬁtted with six
Gaussian (70%)/Lorentzian (30%) product lineshapes to
monitor states in the TiO2 band gap region (0–3.05 eV) and
to describe the valence band emission (3.05–10 eV). For clean
TiO2(110) trace emission is observed in the band gap region as
a result of the B9% non-stoichiometry. Upon dosing with
1/8 ML Cr ad-atoms two clear and well separated states are
introduced in the band gap. The ﬁrst, at B1 eV, is a Ti defect
state of 3d character and is a result of the reduction of Ti4+ to

Ti3+
.17,31,32 The state that appears at B2.9 eV is Cr-derived
and is thus not observed on the reduced or self-doped
TiO2(110) surface.17 In Fig. 1(b) we plot the emission from
the Cr 3d state normalised to the total valence band density as
a function of Cr coverage. The intensity increases steeply
between 0 and 0.25 ML, moving to a shallower increase up
to 0.75 ML which further rolls oﬀat higher coverages. The
high coverage behaviour is consistent with a change in growth
mode (from 2D to 3D) as a result of a change in the Cr/TiO2
surface reactivity.33 Below 0.25 ML it is unlikely that Cr–Cr
interactions dominate and so we concentrate on 1/8 and
1/16 ML coverages for spectroscopic and modelling work.
The Cr 2p XPS spectra (Fig. 2(b)) are complicated by
emission from the Ti 2s state from the TiO2, which lies at an
energy B10 eV below the main Cr 2p3/2 peak, and gives rise to
a structured background. To quantify the Cr 2p region there-
fore, a Ti 2s background derived from the clean TiO2(110)
sample is included in the ﬁt. For 1/8 ML Cr on TiO2(110) two
additional peaks (Gaussian (78%)/Lorentzian (22%) line-
shapes) are then ﬁt upon a Shirley background to represent
the Cr 2p3/2 and Cr 2p1/2 states. These peaks are constrained to
have equal width (FWHM = 3.16 eV) and an area ratio of
1.000 : 0.518 to accurately represent the lifetime and occu-
pancy of the spin–orbit split states, respectively. The position
of the peaks were allowed to ﬂoat in the ﬁtting process and a
best ﬁt was obtained with a binding energy of 575.8 eV for Cr
2p3/2 and 585.2 eV for Cr 2p1/2 (spin orbit split 9.4 eV). These
energies are signiﬁcantly higher than those associated with
metallic Cr0 peaks (which has a characteristic energy of
574.2 eV and a spin–orbit split separation of 9.1 eV and must
therefore be related to oxidised Cr. These as deposited Cr
binding energies indicate the formation of Cr2+ where litera-
ture values are typically in the range 575.3–576 eV with a
spin–orbit split of B9.5 eV.34–38
To examine the interaction of the Cr doped TiO2(110)
surface
with
molecular
oxygen
the
sub-monolayer
Cr/TiO2(110) surfaces were exposed for 3 min (saturation) in
an oxygen atmosphere of 1  107 Torr. The upper traces in
Fig. 2 compare the UPS and XPS spectra obtained from
typical dosed and oxidised surfaces. Oxygen exposure removes
the Ti derived bandgap feature at 1 eV in UPS, conﬁrming that
the Ti 3d orbitals are no longer occupied. Interestingly,
however, emission from the Cr 3d state at 2.9 eV remains,
although diminished in intensity somewhat. From the XPS
spectra we observe a signiﬁcant shift in the Cr 2p3/2 and Cr
2p1/2 peaks to 577.3 and 586.8 eV (9.5 eV spin orbit split). This
is indicative of a change in oxidation state and is consistent
with oxidation of the sub-monolayer Cr2+ to Cr3+
.34,38,39 For
the Ti 2p oxidised spectra (not shown) a signiﬁcant reduction
in the Ti3+ shoulder is observed and the TiO2 stoichiometry is
raised from 78% to 94% conﬁrming oxidation of the surface
Ti ions. Exposing the TiO2(110) surface without Cr adsorbed
to oxygen does not change the XPS or UPS as expected for
well prepared substrates.
First principles modelling
Several adsorption models were probed at various coverages
and here we report the low coverage structure to compare with
experiment. In the most stable adsorption site for low coverage
Cr (1/16 ML in this example) on TiO2 the Cr atom bridges two
bridging oxygen atoms (Obr) and is displaced along the h1
10i
direction. The atomic structure is displayed in Fig. 3 and could
be described as the surface termination of the horizontal
interstitial site (ih) using common nomenclature.40 The com-
puted energy gain for this structure, relative to separated bulk
Cr metal and a clean surface, is 0.54 eV. The negative
adsorption energy indicates that the system is stabilised with
Cr adsorbed. The surface geometry is aﬀected by Cr adsorp-
tion. On the surface, the Cr–Obr distances are 1.95 A
˚ . The
distance from Cr to the 6-fold coordinated surface Ti atom
(Ti6fold) below the adsorbate is 2.83 A
˚
and Cr lies 2.44 A
˚
above the surface plane. A notable feature of the geometry is
the strong asymmetry in the distances involving the 5-fold
coordinated surface Ti atoms along the h001i rows either side
of the adsorbate, Fig. 3(c). The row to the left of the Cr shows
Ti5-fold–Oin-plane distances that range from 1.92–2.05 A
˚ , with
the longest distances (the most distorted geometry) centred
around one 5-fold Ti atom. In the other row, the corresponding
Ti5-fold–Oin-plane distances are little distorted from the stoichio-
metric surface, ranging from 1.97–1.98 A
˚ . A similar structural
asymmetry was observed for Ti doping of TiO2 in ref. 17.
To examine the electronic structure and the origin of the
structural distortion, we consider the excess spin density,
deﬁned as the diﬀerence between the majority and minority
spin electron density. The spin density for adsorbed Cr is
displayed in Fig. 4 and shows spin on adsorbed Cr. The
computed spin magnetization gives a 3d4 electronic conﬁgura-
tion on Cr, with the four 3d electrons unpaired, so that upon

adsorption Cr is oxidised to Cr2+
, with the 4s electron and a
3d electron transferred to the surface. There is also spin
density on two ﬁve-fold coordinated surface Ti atoms. Of
these Ti atoms, that nearest the adsorption site is reduced to
Ti3+ (computed spin magnetisation is 0.9 spins) and the
second such Ti is partially reduced (computed spin magnetisa-
tion is 0.22). There is a very small degree of spin density over
other surface Ti atoms. This is very similar to the spin density
found for self-doped TiO2 in ref. 17.
In regard to localization vs. delocalisation in these systems,
a number of recent publications have shown the need to go
beyond DFT.17,19,20 In ref. 17 we showed for Ti adsorption at
the (110) surface, that the DFT description of reduced Ti is
inconsistent with experimental XPS and UPS data. Applying
DFT + U to this system gave results consistent with the
experiment. Morgan and Watson20 showed that DFT + U is
needed to describe the surface oxygen vacancy in rutile (110)
and recent studies from Pacchioni’s group has also shown the
need for hybrid DFT in describing oxygen vacancies in rutile
and anatase TiO2, as well as hydroxyl adsorption.19,20
The partial electronic density of states (PEDOS) is obtained
by projection onto spherical harmonics, with given radii (the
Wigner Seitz radius), which are 1.32 A
˚ for Ti, 1.40 A
˚ for Cr
and 1.40 A
˚ for O. These radii recover the correct number of
valence electrons. The PEDOS is shown in Fig. 4. The PEDOS
shows states in the TiO2 band gap derived from Cr and Ti. The
position of the Ti-derived gap state is consistent with reduced
Ti3+
, with an oﬀset of 1.7 eV to the valence band and 0.8 eV to
the conduction band. The Cr-derived gap states are centred
0.5 eV above the valence band and is well separated from the
Ti3+ peak. The position of these defect states relative to the
valence band is consistent with the UPS data in Fig. 2 allowing
assignment of the UPS peaks to Cr2+ and Ti3+
. To determine
the nature of the states that make up the Cr peak, we analyse
the angular momentum contributions to the PEDOS peak.
This shows that the Cr PEDOS peak is derived from 3dz2, 3dxz,
3dx2y2 and 3dxy orbitals.
There is a general correlation between the surface geometry
and the localisation/delocalisation of the electrons introduced
by dopants on oxides, e.g. for Li-doped MgO41 or Al-doped
SiO2.42 Localisation of charge at a surface cation is accom-
panied by a strong asymmetry in the geometry (as discussed
above); in this case the reduction of a 5-fold coordinated
surface Ti atom in TiO2, in which the 3dx2y2 state is occupied
by one electron, induces a Jahn–Teller distortion in the
geometry. Comparing Fig. 3(c) with Fig. 4, the strongest
asymmetry in the Ti–O distances is found around the Ti3+ ion.
To model the interaction of molecular oxygen with the
doped surface, a number of adsorption sites were studied. In
the most stable adsorption conﬁguration, O2 interacts with
adsorbed Cr with the adsorption structure shown in Fig. 5(a).
The adsorption of oxygen results in an energy gain of
1.88 eV when adsorbed at Cr. The O–O bond lengthens to
1.31 A
˚ (from 1.20 A
˚ in gas phase O2), but is not dissociated,
and is consistent with the formation of a peroxo (O2
2)
species. The spin density is shown in Fig. 5(a) for O2 adsorbed
at Cr and shows no spin density on the Ti atom previously
reduced to 3+, indicating that this Ti is re-oxidised upon
interaction with O2, even though oxygen adsorbs at the Cr
atom. Cr shows a spin density. The PEDOS plot for the
previously reduced 5-fold Ti and adsorbed Cr are shown in
Fig. 5(b). The PEDOS shows that upon adsorption of O2, the
Ti3+ defect state has disappeared. This is consistent with the
UPS data of Fig. 3(a). The Cr 3d peak is diﬀerent to that in
Fig. 5(b) and analysis of the electronic structure indicates a
Cr3+ ion is present.
Discussion
There is considerable similarity in the adsorption site and
electronic structure induced by adsorption of Cr or Ti at the
TiO2(110) surface; both form 2+ ions in the as adsorbed state
in the ih surface site and reduce a local Ti5-fold of the substrate
at the surface. This ih surface site has been the subject of recent
controversy in the assignment of the surface structure of
(1  2) reconstructed substoichiometric TiO2(110) surfaces.43,44
In the case of Cr adsorption the initial adsorption site is
important in deﬁning the structure for the subsequent growth
of rutile CrO2 ﬁlms. The interstitial site bridging two oxygen
atoms does not lend itself to a continuation of the lattice for
epitaxial growth so considerable restructuring would be
required to move the Cr to the atop lattice site. The electronic
structure induced by adsorption is also notable for the loca-
lised nature of the induced defect state in the surface, which
would have implications for electrical conductivity in com-
parison to delocalised charges spread throughout the bulk of
the substrate. Upon oxygen adsorption on the Cr the Ti
bandgap states are removed from the system and the substrate
appears stoichiometric. However, the oxidation of Ti is not
necessarily caused by the local adsorption of oxygen at the
Ti3+ site but can be induced by adsorption on the nearby Cr
ion. The surface 5-fold Ti atoms appear to behave as a
reservoir for charge localised in the 3dx2y2 orbital. It is
probable that the ﬁlling and ordering of charge into these

states contributes to the propensity for this surface to adopt
diﬀerent reconstructions as functions of stoichiometry.
Conclusion
Adsorption of Cr on the TiO2 (110) surface at sub-monolayer
coverage and subsequent adsorption of oxygen has been
studied using a combined experimental photoelectron and
modelling (DFT+U) approach. The most stable adsorption
site is that where the Cr atom adsorbs bridging two bridging
oxygen atoms and is displaced along h1
10i, the so called
horizontal interstital site. The electronic states visible in the
TiO2 bandgap in the UPS spectrum and in XPS are assigned to
Cr(II) for adsorbed Cr, and Ti3+ for a surface Ti atom. The
calculations indicate this is a 5-fold coordinated Ti at the
surface and in its reduced state leads to structural distortions
to neighbouring O atoms. Upon exposing the doped surface to
oxygen, both experiment and modelling show that the
Ti3+ defect is preferentially re-oxidised and electrons are
withdrawn
from the surface region, with adsorbed Cr
further oxidised to Cr(III). Thus, a powerful combination of
experiment and an appropriate computational approach is
shown to elucidate the mechanism of charge transfer upon
metal adsorption and oxidation at oxide surfaces.
