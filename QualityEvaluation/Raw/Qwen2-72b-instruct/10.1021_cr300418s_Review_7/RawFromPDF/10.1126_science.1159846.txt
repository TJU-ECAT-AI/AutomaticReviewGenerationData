The Role of Interstitial Sites
in the Ti3d Defect State
in the Band Gap of Titania

Titanium dioxide (TiO2) has a number of uses in catalysis, photochemistry, and sensing that are
linked to the reducibility of the oxide. Usually, bridging oxygen (Obr) vacancies are assumed to
cause the Ti3d defect state in the band gap of rutile TiO2(110). From high-resolution scanning
tunneling microscopy and photoelectron spectroscopy measurements, we propose that Ti
interstitials in the near-surface region may be largely responsible for the defect state in the band
gap. We argue that these donor-specific sites play a key role in and may dictate the ensuing surface
chemistry, such as providing the electronic charge required for O2 adsorption and dissociation.
Specifically, we identified a second O2 dissociation channel that occurs within the Ti troughs in
addition to the O2 dissociation channel in Obr vacancies. Comprehensive density functional theory
calculations support these experimental observations.
T
itanium dioxide (TiO2), or titania, is used
in a number of technological areas, includ-
ing heterogeneous catalysis, photocatalysis,
solar cells, gas sensors, waste remediation, and
biocompatible materials. In its stoichiometric form,
titania is an inert wide–band gap insulator; how-
ever, its applications are enabled by excess elec-
trons originating from the defect state that is
located within the band gap of reduced titania
(TiO2–x). Understanding the origin of the defect
state is important for improving or expanding the
scope of titania-based systems for specific applica-
tions. For example, the enhanced catalytic activity
of titania-supported gold nanoparticles is coupled
to local properties at the interface between gold and
reduced titania (1–4).
Conventionally, the Ti3d derived state in the
band gap (5–7) at ~0.85 eV below the Fermi level
(EF) has been fully ascribed to bridging oxygen
(Obr) vacancies, because, in an ionic picture, the
two excess electrons per Obr vacancy may be
transferred to neighboring Ti atoms (5, 6, 8–11).
This hypothesis was proposed more than three
decades ago based on ultraviolet photoelectron
spectroscopy (UPS) and low-energy electron-
diffraction measurements on the TiO2(110)–(1 × 1)
surface (8), and has been generally accepted for
years (5, 6, 9, 11). In the UPS studies, this pro-
posed O-vacancy model has largely been based
on experimental observations that the defect state
can be eliminated by O2 exposure (8, 12, 13).
Further possible support for the O-vacancy model
came from scanning tunneling microscopy (STM)
(14–17) and atomic force microscopy (18) studies,
where Obr vacancies have been clearly identified
on TiO2(110). Although most first-principles
density functional theory (DFT) calculations have
not reproduced the experimentally observed state
in the band gap (11), numerous theoretical papers
still favor the O-vacancy model (6, 11).
Nevertheless, the importance of Ti interstitials
in rutile TiO2(110) crystals has been noted. For
example, the reoxidation of sputtered TiO2(110)
surfaces via vacuum annealing has been ex-
plained by Ti interstitial diffusion into the bulk
(19–21). Similarly, when a reduced TiO2(110)
crystal is exposed to O2 at elevated temperatures,
diffusion of Ti interstitials to the surface has been
reported (2, 22–24). Therefore, in addition to O
vacancies, Ti interstitials must also be considered
as defect sites that may influence and even dictate
the surface chemistry of titania.
By means of high-resolution STM and photo-
electron spectroscopy (PES) measurements in
conjunction with DFT calculations, we have sys-
tematically explored the origin of the Ti3d defect
state in the band gap. We found that the gap state
remains almost unchanged on surfaces where the
Obr vacancies (or bridging OH groups) have been
removed. To explain this finding, we propose that
the gap state mainly stems from surplus Ti atoms
in the near-surface region, most likely on inter-
stitial sites. In addition to an O2 dissociation
channel in Obr vacancies, we discovered a non–
vacancy-related O2 dissociation channel that
occurs within the Ti troughs.
The TiO2(110)–(1 × 1) surface consists of
alternating rows of fivefold-coordinated Ti (5f-Ti)
atoms (the Ti troughs) and protruding, twofold-
coordinated Obr atoms. As bulk Ti atoms in
stoichiometric rutile, the Ti atoms underneath the
Obr atoms are sixfold-coordinated. Ion-sputtering
and vacuum-annealing the TiO2(110) crystal
results in a reduced n-type semiconductor, with a
bulk conductivity that allows the use of STM and
other electron spectroscopy techniques. Con-
sistent with previous findings (6), the STM images
(Fig. 1) of the TiO2(110) surface are dominated by
electronic effects; that is, the bright rows corre-
spond to the Ti troughs, whereas geometrically
protruding Obr atoms appear as the dark troughs in
the STM images (6).

(Fig. 1A) shows faint protrusions that appear
between the bright Ti troughs and that correspond
to Obr vacancies in the Obr rows (14–17). Starting
from an r-TiO2(110) surface, we studied the effect
of hydration by letting water dissociate in the Obr
vacancies (Fig. 1B). The brighter protrusions in
the Obr rows appearing on the resulting hydrated
TiO2(110) surface [h-TiO2(110)] originate from
capping H atoms or, in an alternative notation,
from OHbr groups (14–17). In the PES valence-
band spectra corresponding to r- and h-TiO2(110)
(Fig. 1D), the only obvious difference is the
OH3s feature at a binding energy (BE) of ~10.8
eV that is evident in the valence band after hy-
dration (12). The Ti3d defect state at ~0.85 eV
below EF is only minimally affected by hydration,
in spite of the complete absence of Obr vacancies
on h-TiO2(110).
In an attempt to “heal” the Obr vacancies on r-
TiO2(110) without producing capping H atoms
on the Obr rows, we studied the interaction of O2
with clean r-TiO2(110) at room temperature (RT).
The number of Obr vacancies decreased after the
O2 exposure (Fig. 1C), and a number of bright
spots appeared simultaneously on the Ti troughs,
some of which are next-nearest neighbors. Based
on previous O2 interaction experiments (3, 14, 25),
the spots in the Ti troughs are assigned to O
adatoms that reside on top of 5f-Ti atoms (Oot).
However, O2 exposure at RT does not lead to the
healing of all the Obr vacancies, even in the case of
saturation (26). In the valence-band spectrum
corresponding to the O2-exposed TiO2(110) sur-
face, one feature is the strongly suppressed defect
state at ~0.85 eV (Fig. 1D). In addition, compared
with the spectra for r- and h-TiO2(110), the dom-
inating features between BEs of ~3 and ~9.5 eV
[primarily O2p-derived (5, 7, 12, 27)] were found
to be shifted by ~0.4 eV toward EF.
Both of these adsorption experiments, hydra-
tion of r-TiO2(110) as well as oxidation of r-TiO2(110)
at RT, raise questions about the origin of the Ti3d
defect state. In the case of the h-TiO2(110)
surface, the assignment of the defect state is
hampered because of capping H atoms, which
also could lead to a state in the band gap (10).
Because O2 exposure at RT to r-TiO2(110) leads
to a surface with Oot adatoms and residual Obr
vacancies, and not to a TiO2(110) surface that is
characterized by perfect Obr rows as was pre-
viously assumed (8), this experiment also does
not reveal the origin of the defect state. In order to
assign the Ti3d defect state, TiO2(110) surfaces
need to be prepared that are characterized by
perfect Obr rows without Obr vacancies and cap-
ping H atoms, and by Ti troughs without Oot
adatoms.
Motivated by the observation that the capping
H atoms on the Obr rows can be reacted off via
reaction with O2 (28), we exposed h-TiO2(110)
surfaces to O2 at RT (Fig. 2). As revealed by the
STM images depicted in Fig. 2, A to D, it is
possible to react off all capping H atoms from the
Obr rows and create a TiO2(110) surface with
perfect Obr rows. However, for O2 exposures
greater than an optimum value, all of the capping
H atoms were removed, but additionally, new
surface species with an elongated shape appeared
within the Ti troughs (Fig. 2, C and D).
We considered the PES results acquired with
surface preparations identical to those in the STM
experiments and focused on the OH3s feature at
~10.8 eV and on the Ti3d defect state (Fig. 2E).
The OH3s feature was completely attenuated af-
ter an O2 exposure of 4 Langmuirs (L 1L = 1.33 ×
10–6 mbar·sec, whereas much higher exposures
were required to minimize the Ti3d defect state
(420 L). For clarity, the evolutions of the Ti3d
defect state and the OH3s feature are shown in
Fig. 2F in greater detail, and the development of
the OH3s feature for O2 exposures of ≤4 L is
shown in fig. S1 (26). One observation from
Fig. 2F is that for 4-L O2 exposure, where the
TiO2(110) surface is characterized by perfect Obr
rows and essentially without capping H atoms,
the Ti3d defect state was only slightly attenuated.
In complete contradiction to the conventionally
accepted O-vacancy model, the PES valence
spectra in Fig. 2 reveal that the Ti3d defect state

is caused by neither Obr vacancies nor capping
H atoms on the Obr rows. Rather, we will show
in the following that the Ti3d defect state can be
directly correlated with the existence of near-
surface Ti interstitial defect sites. Within this mod-
el, electronegative adsorbates, such as those shown
in Fig. 2, C and D, are stabilized on TiO2(110)
surfaces with perfect Obr rows through charge
transfer from Ti interstitials to the adsorbates.
Given the possibility of electron donation
arising from Ti interstitial defects, we studied the
interaction of O2 with the clean r-TiO2(110)
surface at RTin further detail (Fig. 3). Specifically,
we identified a non–vacancy-related O2 dis-
sociation channel occurring within the Ti troughs.
That such a second O2 dissociation channel exists,
in addition to the known dissociation channel
associated with Obr vacancies (3, 14, 16, 29, 30),
is evident from the high number of paired Oot ad-
atoms observed on a partially oxidized r-TiO2(110)
surface (Fig. 3, A and B). After O2 exposure, the
densities of Obr vacancies {3.9% monolayers
[MLs; 1 ML is the density of the (1 × 1) units,
5.2 × 1014 cm–2]} and Oot adatoms (6.0% MLs)
together exceed the density of Obr vacancies
before the exposure (7.9% MLs) by roughly the
density of Oot adatoms found in pairs (1.7% MLs).
In the pairs, two Oot adatoms are adsorbed on next-
nearest Ti-5f atoms. Such Oot pairs were also
observed after oxidation of an r-TiO2(110) surface
with a very low density of Obr vacancies (Fig. 3C),
where an unlikely but, in principle, possible Oot
pair formation through two separate O2 dissocia-
tion reactions in Obr vacancies on adjacent Obr
rows can be ruled out with certainty. Oot pairs are
also evident in the STM images reported by
Henderson et al. (25).
To study the non–vacancy-related O2 disso-
ciation channel more in depth, we also exposed
r-TiO2(110) surfaces to O2 at low temperatures
(120 K) and subsequently annealed the crystals to
temperatures of 393 K and 448 K, respectively
(Fig. 4, A to E). After exposing the surface of a
TiO2(110) crystal with an Obr vacancy density of
4.5% MLs to 5 L of O2 at 120 K, all the Obr
vacancies disappeared and Oot adatoms appeared
in the Ti troughs (Fig. 4A). No Oot pairs were
evident in the STM images, indicating that the
non–vacancy-related O2 dissociation channel
does not operate at this low temperature. This
conclusion is consistent with the 1:1 correlation
between the density of Obr vacancies before O2
exposure and the density of Oot adatoms after the
exposure. However, after annealing this O2-
exposed TiO2(110) surface to 393 K (Fig. 4B),
the density of Oot adatoms increased by a factor
of ~2. This result shows that the non–vacancy-
related O2 dissociation channel is energetically
more activated than the one associated with the
Obr vacancies.
In addition, a number of small islands ap-
peared on the terraces, one of which is indicated
in Fig. 4B by a circle. These newly formed is-
lands are positioned in between two Ti troughs
and show up in the STM images with a height of
~2.2 Å. Subsequent annealing to an even higher
temperature (448 K) led to an increase in the
density of the islands, and, in this case, larger
islands with a height of ~3.2 Å were observed, in
addition to the small islands (Fig. 4C). A height
of ~3.2 Å closely resembles the step height on
TiO2(110) crystals; that is, the height of one TiO2
trilayer, which is ~3.25 Å. When applying
identical experimental procedures for a more
reduced TiO2(110) crystal (with an Obr vacancy
density of ~10.8% MLs and ~9.4% MLs Oot
adatoms density after saturation with 20 L O2 at
120 K), the density of Oot adatoms was slightly
smaller after annealing to 393 K than before the
anneal (Fig. 4, D and E), but, compared with the
situation on the low-reduced TiO2(110) crystal
(Fig. 4B), the number of small islands after an-
nealing to 393 K was higher.
In Fig. 4F, we present PES results for a similar
annealing experiment. The Ti3d defect state
reappeared after annealing to temperatures higher
than 400 K. In Fig. 4F, the oxidation before the
annealing at 400 K was carried out at RT, but we
found results when the oxidation was performed
at 120 K that were similar to those of the STM
experiments depicted in Figs. 4, A to E. Con-
comitant with the recovery of the Ti3d defect
state, the valence-band maximum (VBM) shifts
back to the original value of the clean r-TiO2(110)
surface.
Based on the STM results (Fig. 4, A to E) and
the PES data (Fig. 4F and figs. S2 and S3) (26),
we propose the following model. Because exclu-
sively Ti and O features are evident in the PES
core-level spectra (fig. S2), the islands appearing
on previously flat terraces must be newly formed
TiOx structures, with x ~ 2. This finding im-
plies that Ti atoms have diffused from the near-
surface region to the topmost surface layer, where
reactions with Oot adatoms and possibly also

with O2 molecules occurred. The fact that the
Ti3d defect state reappears after annealing to
temperatures higher than 400 K can be explained
by the migration of Ti interstitials from deeper
layers to interstitial sites in the layers nearer the
surface that had been depleted in the course of
TiOx island formation. Assuming a 1:2 correlation
between Ti and O in the islands, we estimated a
lower limit of Ti interstitials in the near-surface
region, corresponding to 5 to 6% MLs for the
TiO2(110) crystals used in the experiments
summarized in Fig. 4.
The STM and PES results shown in Fig. 4 are
consistent with the temperature-programmed
static secondary ion mass spectrometry data re-
ported by Henderson (19), in which the onset of
Ti interstitial diffusion occurred at ~400 K. Further-
more, similarities exist to previous STM results by
Onishi et al. (22) and by Li et al. (23), in which
O2-induced growth of new structures on originally
flat TiO2(110) terraces were also obtained. How-
ever, because the experimental procedures applied
in these previous studies were different from the
ones in the present work, the structures obtained
by Onishi et al. (22) and by Li et al. (23) are
different from the ones obtained here.
The above-presented results addressing the
O2 interaction with r-TiO2(110) reveal that Ti
charge donors exist in the near-surface region of
vacuum-annealed TiO2 crystals, and that these
donor sites strongly influence the O2 interaction
with r-TiO2(110), even at temperatures as low as
120 K. Because the gap state remains largely
unaffected by the removal of all surface defects
(Obr and OHbr), we propose that the appearance
of the gap state on clean reduced TiO2(110) crys-
tals, as is typically observed after vacuum anneal-
ing, is mainly associated with the Ti interstitials.
Quenching of the gap state and so-called band-
bending effects (Figs. 1D and 4F) can be ascribed
to the withdrawal of electronic charge from the
donor sites in the near-surface region through the
accumulation of electronegative adsorbates, such
as O2 and Oot adatoms on the surface.
To further explore this new interpretation, we
performed first-principles DFTcalculations using
the DACAPO software package (https://wiki.
fysik.dtu.dk/dacapo), using ultrasoft pseudopo-
tentials and the revised Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof
exchange-correlation functional (26). We as-
sumed a Ti interstitial (Fig. 5, blue) initially
between the second and third trilayers of a five-
TiO2 trilayer slab with a c(4 × 2) surface-unit cell
(Fig. 5B). On the surface of such a slab, an
adsorbed O2 molecule binds with ~1.6 eV
, which
is comparable to the ~1.9- and 0.8-to-2.0-eV bond
strengths calculated for O2 on r-TiO2(110) (14) and
h-TiO2(110) (31), respectively. The DFT
potential-energy diagram (Fig. 5A) shows that
an energetically favorable pathway exists for a Ti
interstitial to diffuse to the surface and to react
with the adsorbed O2 molecule to form a TiO2
island on the terrace. The Ti interstitial diffusion
proceeds via an exchange mechanism (21), in
which a Ti atom on a regular lattice site (light
blue) is released to an interstitial site toward the
surface (Fig. 5C), and subsequently the lattice site
is occupied by the original Ti interstitial atom
(dark blue) from a deeper layer (Fig. 5D).
Dissociation of the O2 molecule (Fig. 5, E and
F) gains ~4 eV in energy.
Relative to the initial configuration (Fig. 5B),
the overall barrier for the formation of the TiOx
islands on the terraces is ~0.75 eV. However,
with respect to the potential energy of the meta-
stable intermediate configuration of the Ti inter-
stitial between the first and second TiO2 trilayer
(Fig. 5C), the barrier becomes ~1.2 eV. The
absolute value of this energy barrier is in good
agreement with the experimental findings that the
TiOx islands appear on the flat TiO2(110) terraces
after annealing to temperatures well above RT
(Fig. 4). If we tentatively assume that the Ti dif-
fusion can be described as a first-order process,
our rough estimate of the diffusion barrier from
the Redhead formula is 1.2 eV.
If we start with a configuration wherein the
O2 molecule in Fig. 5 is replaced by an Oot
adatom, our DFT calculations still indicate fa-
vorable energetics for the diffusion of the Ti
interstitial toward the surface. The two adsorb-
ates, O2 and Oot adatoms, are quite similar elec-
tronically. According to a Bader charge analysis
of our slab systems (26), a molecularly adsorbed
O2 species withdraws ~0.9 electron (e) from the
TiO2(110) substrate, whereas an Oot adatom
withdraws ~0.8 e. If these electronegative ad-
sorbates are removed from the TiO2(110) surface
layer, the most favorable position of the Ti inter-
stitial is the octahedral site (32) between the sec-
ond and third TiO2 trilayer. For a six-TiO2 trilayer
slab, our calculations show that the potential ener-
gy is higher by ~0.40 and ~0.23 eV
, respectively,
when locating the Ti interstitial one-TiO2 trilayer
higher or lower in the [110] direction.
To elucidate the mechanism of the second O2
dissociation channel identified experimentally in
Fig. 3 and Fig. 4, A and B, we performed
additional calculations (figs. S4 and S5) (26). In
agreement with previous reports (14, 33, 34), we
found that O2 molecules neither adsorb nor dis-
sociate on stoichiometric TiO2(110) unless the
slab is reduced. Introduction of an Obr vacancy is
sufficient to enable the adsorption of molecular
O2 (fig. S4B) (26) but not to dissociate O2 in the
Ti trough (fig. S4C) (26). Instead, when reducing
the slab by adding a near-surface Ti interstitial,
both the molecular (fig. S4D) and the dissociative
adsorption (fig. S4E) of O2 become feasible. If
a Ti interstitial and an Obr vacancy occur simul-
taneously, the energy gain is even greater in
both these adsorption modes (fig. S4, F and G).

Fig. 4, A and B, that dissociation of O2 in the Ti
troughs leads to next-nearest neighbors of Oot
adatoms is supported by the calculated prefer-
ence for this configuration (fig. S5D) as com-

pared with a pair of nearest-neighbor Oot ad-
atoms (fig. S5C).
The role of the Ti interstitials in the O2
adsorption and dissociation reactions is to pro-
vide the electronic charge for the adsorbates. Ac-
cording to the above Bader charge analysis, more
electronic charge is required for dissociative ad-
sorption (2Oot) than for molecular adsorption
(1O2). Hence, dissociative adsorption is more
sensitive to the amount of charge available on the
surface than molecular adsorption, a fact clearly
borne out by the DFT calculations in figs. S4 and
S5. For instance, coadsorption of Oot in fig. S5, B
to D, decreases the stability of molecularly ad-
sorbed O2 by ~0.4 eV (fig. S5, B versus E) but
that of dissociatively adsorbed oxygen by ~1.5 eV
(fig. S5, C and D versus F and G). The coadsorbed
Oot adatom partially oxidizes the surface and
thereby lowers the ease with which electronic
charge is available for further surface reactions.
Within the scheme used for the calculations,
the O2 dissociation energy barrier is increased
from ~0.3 to ~0.8 eV (fig. S5A) upon introduc-
tion of the Oot adatom. This result explains why
the coverage of Oot adatoms remains low even
under conditions in which the second O2 dis-
sociation channel operates (Fig. 3C); that is, the
reaction is self-limiting. Similarly, some Obr va-
cancies remain unfilled even in the case of O2 sat-
uration (Figs. 1C and 4D); that is, the electronic
charge required for the resulting Oot adatoms
depletes the source from the limited number of Ti
interstitials. This charge-competition model also
could explain why an O2 desorption feature
observed in the temperature-programmed de-
sorption experiments by Henderson et al. (30) is
evident only after exposing the r-TiO2(110) sur-
face at low temperature (below ~180 K). If
impinging O2 molecules can overcome the disso-
ciation barrier, as observed in the experiments
performed at RT (Fig. 3), the dissociation products
deplete the electron donors in the bulk, and the
accumulation of molecular O2 is prohibited.
For a slab characterized by a Ti interstitial
between the second and third TiO2 trilayer and a
pristine surface, our calculations reveal the exis-
tence of a gap state. This state lies ~2 eV above
the VBM, in good agreement with the state
observed in the PES experiments (Figs. 1D and
2E) as well as with DFT calculations addressing
Ti interstitials in the bulk (32). A thorough anal-
ysis (fig. S6, A and B) of the spatially resolved
electronic density of states shows that the gap
state is spatially located in the region between the
second and third TiO2 trilayer, which strongly
suggests that its origin is from the Ti interstitial.
Further reduction of the surface layer by intro-
duction of an Obr vacancy or a capping H atom
(OHbr group) does not affect the gap state (fig.
S6, C and D).
Conversely, adsorption of electronegative
species such as O2 or Oot adatoms causes quench-
ing of the gap state (fig. S6, E and F); in the case
of adsorbed O2, a new O2-related state appears in
the gap, in agreement with electron energy loss
results by Henderson et al. (30). Most previous
DFT papers addressing the gap state did not
reveal a state in the gap for stoichiometric TiO2
slabs with Obr vacancies or OHbr groups (11).
Our calculations agree with these previous results
(fig. S7, A to C) and further show no sign of a
gap state when we introduce a hypothetical O
vacancy in the bulk (fig. S7, D and E). These
results challenge the conclusions derived by Di
Valentin et al. (10) that a hybrid DFT setup is
required to identify the gap state and that the gap
state is related to Obr vacancies.
We propose that the surface redox chemistry
on reduced titania is to a large extent associated
with Ti interstitials in the near-surface region,
because these defect sites provide the electronic
charge, enabling important reactions. This con-
clusion is consistent with numerous experimental
studies addressing the Ti3d defect state, including
the pioneering work by Henrich et al. (5, 8),
electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy
(35–37), bulk photonic (38) and transport (39)
studies, recent photoelectron diffraction studies
(40), and thin-film growth studies (41).
Moreover, several experimental results that
were puzzling within an O vacancy model can
now be revisited and explained more readily. For
example, the simultaneous UPS and metastable
impact electron spectroscopy (MIES) measure-
ments of r-TiO2(110) by Krischok et al. show no
intensity between 0.5 to 1.0 eV below EF in the
MIES spectrum, whereas the Ti3d defect state is
clearly observed in the UPS spectrum (13). Be-
cause of enhanced surface sensitivity with MIES
as compared with UPS, the intensity of the Ti3d
defect state is strongly suppressed in MIES (13).
As a second example, it can be rationalized why
the Ti3d defect state occurs for reduced bulk
TiO2 single crystals, but not for titania thin films
grown on metal substrates. Particularly in the
case of ultrathin titania films (4, 42), there are no
interstitial sites available and, hence, a defect
state typical of reduced TiO2 single crystals does
not occur (4, 42). Instead, the d electrons of the
metal substrate can be considered a huge “bulk
defect state” and thus fulfill the same function
that the Ti interstitials do in reduced bulk TiO2
crystals. Finally, at interfaces between two iso-
lating oxide materials, the Ti interstitials may
be the cornerstone to explain phenomena such
as superconductivity, as has been reported for
LaAlO3/SrTiO3 (43).
