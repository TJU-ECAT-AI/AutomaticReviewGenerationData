[1] "Many oxides catalyze oxidation reactions through the Marsvan Krevelen mechanism in which the oxygen is supplied from the surface of the oxide. 59 The reduced oxide is reoxidized by reacting with the oxygen molecules in the gas. As the oxygen supplied to the molecule being oxidized comes from the surface of the oxide, the energy of formation of an oxygen vacancy (VO) at the surface of the oxide is often a good indicator of the oxidizing power of the oxide."

1. In the Mars-van Krevelen mechanism, oxygen is supplied from the surface of the oxide to catalyze oxidation reactions. The reduced oxide is reoxidized by reacting with oxygen molecules in the gas phase. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) at the surface of the oxide is a good indicator of the oxide's oxidizing power.

1. 在Mars-van Krevelen机制中，氧化物表面提供氧气以催化氧化反应。还原的氧化物通过与气相中的氧分子反应而重新氧化。在氧化物表面形成氧空位所需的能量(ΔEv)是氧化物氧化能力的良好指标。
