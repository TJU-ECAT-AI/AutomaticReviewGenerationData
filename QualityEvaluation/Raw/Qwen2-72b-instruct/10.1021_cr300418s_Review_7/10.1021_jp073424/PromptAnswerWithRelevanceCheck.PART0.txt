Read the questions and answers provided below. First, critically assess the overall relevance of the answers provided to the set of questions asked.

If, upon your assessment, you find that the answers do not contain information that is relevant to the questions asked, stop your review process immediately and respond with a single sentence: "※※※※※※※The provided answers are not relevant to the questions.※※※※※※※". Do not provide any additional explanation or background information, only this sentence should be given as a response in case of irrelevant answers.

If, however, the answers are relevant to the questions asked, proceed to compile answers for each question according to the instructions below. Ensure to aggregate all the relevant answers from the multiple answer results provided in the document, and organize them sequentially by their order number, compiling the corresponding quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question.

If the provided answers' quotes are not differentiated by question, ensure to break them down and assign the quotes to each respective question, outputting them separately within each question's section.

To provide a comprehensive review, differentiate the responses into quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question based on the details given in the 'Answer' XML tags. Structure your review using the XML format showcased below if the answers are relevant to the questions asked:

<quotes>

[1] "Many oxides catalyze oxidation reactions through the Marsvan Krevelen mechanism in which the oxygen is supplied from the surface of the oxide. 59 The reduced oxide is reoxidized by reacting with the oxygen molecules in the gas. As the oxygen supplied to the molecule being oxidized comes from the surface of the oxide, the energy of formation of an oxygen vacancy (VO) at the surface of the oxide is often a good indicator of the oxidizing power of the oxide."

1. In the Mars-van Krevelen mechanism, oxygen is supplied from the surface of the oxide to catalyze oxidation reactions. The reduced oxide is reoxidized by reacting with oxygen molecules in the gas phase. The energy required for the formation of an oxygen vacancy at the surface of the oxide is a good indicator of the oxide's oxidizing power.
