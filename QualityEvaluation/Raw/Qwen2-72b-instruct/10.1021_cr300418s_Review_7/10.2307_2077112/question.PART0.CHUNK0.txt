I'm going to give you a scientific literature. Then I'm going to ask you some questions about it. I'd like you to first write down exact quotes of parts of the document word by word that would help answer the question, and then I'd like you to answer the question using facts from the quoted content. Do not omit any relevant information from the text, and avoid introducing any falsehoods or assumptions that aren't directly supported by the literature.

She notes,for example, that there are no professional openings for women in Victorian novels, and that writers are silent on any claim by women to a right to a career other than that of governess or teacher. Some nineteenth- century novels do indeed raise the issue of women's careers-for example, George Giss- ing's The Odd Women, or Geraldine Jews- bury's The Half Sisters. Kane has missed them, but her point remains valid: Female professionals are nearly absent from the Victorian imaginary world.The most intriguing point in the evidence is how little novels have to say about family size. Families of two or three children appear to have been the norm throughout the century, and not only because mortality reduced the number of surviving children.There is, typically, an undertone of disap- proval when large broods are mentioned.This attitude fits with some of the major themes of the novels: the acquisition and maintenance of property and status. The desirability of small families, at least in the biased social universe of the novels, pre- ceded by many years the time when family limitation could be measured.Marriage and Divorce in Islamic South-East Asia, by Gavin W.

NoRANI OTHMAN Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia (The National University of Malaysia) This book is about marriage and its dissolu- tion among the Malay populations of South- east Asia, or stated differently, among Melayu- Nusantara Muslims living in Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore, Brunei, four provinces of Southern Thailand (Pattani, Narathiwat, Yala and Satun), and the Philippines. The survey- research upon which a large part of the statistical analyses of marriage and divorce is based was conducted in Indonesia during the period of 1973-78, and in Malaysia in 1978-79 (pp. v-vi). For the rest of the region, Jones's analysis relies solely on secondary data. These data sources, whether primary or secondary, are described in the three appendices.Jones's study is a remarkable chronicle of some actual trends of marriage and divorce within the Southeast Asian Malay-Muslim world. A significant contribution of this book is that it provides the empirical base to examine whether the trends in age at marriage and divorce were driven by social changes or by "modernization" through industrial development. The book then ex- plores to what extent Islam, changes in Islamic laws and practices, and the Islamic resurgence have influenced marriage and its dissolution. The data analyses also include an investigation of trends and differentials in age at first marriage, of divorce, and the effects of these changes on fertility. Besides these statistical analyses, Jones assesses the sources of these marriage and divorce patterns and the varying incidence of polygyny and remarriage.
These analyses are employed to explain the "dramatic changes in the structure and internal dynamics of a traditional society"- changes over a relatively short period that were unequaled anywhere in the world (p. 16). The change has indeed been pervasive:from a pattern of fairly tight control over adolescent females and early or parent- arranged marriage to one of freer female adolescence, followed by later, self-arranged marriage and greater options for nonmarriage or very late marriage. A parallel trend is observable in the movement away from high rates of divorce. The most striking effect of these changes is that over the past 30 years,there has been a revolution in age at marriage throughout Islamic Southeast Asia. Impli- cated in this central transition are fundamen- tal changes in family structure, parent- children relationships, child-raising practices,and expectations of daughters.

How does the Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operate in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions, and what is the significance of the energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface?


</questions>

First, you need to sequentially extract any quotes in the literature that are most relevant to each question, and print them in numbered order, separated by newlines. Quotes should be relatively brief. Do not attempt to summarize or answer questions at this stage, but simply repeat exactly what the corresponding part of the literature says.

Please enclose the full list of quotes in <quotes></quotes> XML tags. If there are no relevant quotes, write "No relevant quotes" instead.

Then, answer the question, starting with "Answer:".  Do not include or reference quoted content verbatim in the answer. Don't say "According to Quote [1]" when answering. Do not write reference number of quotes after answer. Put your answer to the user inside <EnglishVersionAnswer></EnglishVersionAnswer> XML tags. Output formatted text, with line breaks for each question.Separate quotes and answers with a blank line. Provide the answers to all questions in English. After completing the English answers, translate all those answers into Chinese and provide the Chinese version inside <ChineseVersionAnswer></ChineseVersionAnswer> XML tags.

Thus, the format of your overall response should look like what's shown between the <example></example> tags.  Make sure to follow the formatting and spacing exactly.
