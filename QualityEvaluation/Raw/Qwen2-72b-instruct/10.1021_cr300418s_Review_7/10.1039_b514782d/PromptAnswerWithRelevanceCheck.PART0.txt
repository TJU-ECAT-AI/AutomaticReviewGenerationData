1.The literature does not provide a direct explanation of how the Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions or the significance of the energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. However, it does discuss the role of ceria surfaces in the catalytic conversion of CO, NO2, and NO to CO2, NO, and N2, and the importance of understanding the properties of ceria surfaces for developing and optimizing new ceria-containing catalysts. The study found that the sensitivity of the energetics of the catalytic reactions to the nature of the surfaces is determined by the surface vacancy formation energy, which is not related to the stability of the pure surface. This suggests that the energy required for oxygen vacancy formation plays a crucial role in determining the catalytic activity and oxidizing ability of ceria surfaces.

1.文献没有直接解释Mars-van Krevelen机制在氧化物催化氧化反应中的运作方式，也没有解释形成氧空位所需的能量(ΔEv)在确定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力方面的重要性。然而，它确实讨论了铈表面在催化转化CO、NO2和NO为CO2、NO和N2中的作用，以及理解铈表面性质对于开发和优化新的含铈催化剂的重要性。研究发现，催化反应的热力学对表面性质的敏感性是由表面空位形成能决定的，而表面空位形成能与纯表面的稳定性无关。这表明，形成氧空位所需的能量在确定铈表面的催化活性和氧化能力方面起着至关重要的作用。

However, it does discuss the role of ceria surfaces in catalytic reactions, particularly the reduction of ceria surfaces providing oxygen atoms for the oxidation of carbon monoxide to CO2, and the re-oxidation of a reduced ceria surface by extracting oxygen from NO2, which dissociates to NO. The NO formed can dissociate on a reduced ceria surface with the release of N2. The study also finds that the surface sensitivity of the catalytic reactions is determined by the surface vacancy formation energy, indicating that the energy required for oxygen vacancy formation plays a crucial role in the catalytic activity and oxidizing ability of the ceria surface.

The energy for the conversion of CO to CO2, NO2 to NO, and NO to N2 over ceria surfaces is computed, and the surface sensitivity is discussed on the basis of the vacancy formation energies. The study shows that the most favorable surface for vacancy formation cannot simply be predicted from the stability of the pure surfaces, and that the sensitivity of the energetics of the catalytic reactions to the nature of the surfaces is determined by the surface vacancy formation energy.

However, it does discuss the role of ceria surfaces in catalytic reactions, particularly the conversion of CO, NO2, and NO to CO2, NO, and N2, and the sensitivity of these reactions to the nature of the ceria surface. The formation of oxygen vacancies on ceria surfaces is crucial for the catalytic cycle, as it provides oxygen atoms for the oxidation of CO to CO2 and the reduction of NO2 and NO to NO and N2. The surface sensitivity of the reactions is determined by the vacancy formation energies, which are not directly related to the stability of the pure ceria surfaces. The (110) surface is found to be the most suitable for studying these catalytic reactions due to its favorable vacancy formation energy.
