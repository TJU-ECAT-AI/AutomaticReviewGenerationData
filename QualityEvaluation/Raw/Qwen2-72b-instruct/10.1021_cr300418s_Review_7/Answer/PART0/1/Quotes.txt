[1] "A large fraction of the output of the chemical industry consists of products obtained by oxidation or oxidative dehydrogenation reactions catalyzed by oxides. 1-6 In most cases, the reaction proceeds through a Marsvan Krevelen mechanism. 7,8 The species to be oxidized reacts with the oxygen atoms at the surface of the oxide, creating oxygen vacancies. The reduced oxide is oxidized by reacting with gas-phase oxygen."
          [2] "We use oxygen vacancy formation energy (OVFE) as a measure of how easily lattice oxygen may participate in the Mars and Van Krevelen mechanism for oxidation reactions."
          [3] "We calculate with density functional theory how OVFE is affected when some of Zn atoms in ZnO(1010) surface layer are substituted by other metal dopants."
          [4] "We find that Li, Na, K, Rb, Cs, Os, Rh, Ir, Ni, Pd, Pt, Cu, Ag, Au, and Cd decrease OVFE and prefer to be located at the surface of ZnO rather than in the bulk."
          [5] "Mg, Ca, Sr, Ba, Sc, Y, La, Ti, Zr, Hf, Ce, V, Nb, Ta, Cr, Mo, W, Mn, Re, Fe, Ru, Co, Al, Ga, Sn, and Pb increase OVFE."
          [6] "Most of the dopants that increase OVFE prefer to substitute Zn atoms in the bulk, except for Ca, Sr, Ba, La, Ce, Re, Fe, Ru, Co, Sn, and Pb, which prefer to substitute a Zn atom at the surface."





"Many oxides catalyze oxidation reactions through the Marsvan Krevelen mechanism in which the oxygen is supplied from the surface of the oxide. 59 The reduced oxide is reoxidized by reacting with the oxygen molecules in the gas. As the oxygen supplied to the molecule being oxidized comes from the surface of the oxide, the energy of formation of an oxygen vacancy (VO) at the surface of the oxide is often a good indicator of the oxidizing power of the oxide."

[1] "The energy of CO reaction with an oxygen atom from the surface layer decays linearly with the energy of vacancy formation ΔEv, whereas the energy of adsorption of O2 at a vacancy is a linear function of ΔEv."
          [2] "These are the only two reactions in the mechanism whose energy varies from one doped oxide to another."
          [3] "Because they both depend on the energy of oxygen vacancy formation, the latter quantity is a good descriptor of catalytic activity."
          [4] "In deciding which intermediate reactions are most likely from an energetic point of view, we impose a spin conservation rule: a reaction that requires flipping a spin is too slow for catalysis."
          [5] "Because of this, we only consider reactions that conserve spin."
          [6] "We find that all the dopants studied here lower the energy of vacancy formation; therefore, the doped oxides are better oxidants than the undoped ones."



[2] "The energy of oxygen-vacancy formation has been measured but the results are at variance due to differences in the method of preparation. It is therefore not possible to compare reliably the values calculated here with experiments. Measurements of the equilibrium between gaseous O2 and ceria have been used to determine the enthalpy of oxygen-vacancy formation, and the re- sults have been reviewed by Mongensen et al. [46]. It was found that when x in CeO2x is 105 the enthalpy of vacancy formation (to generate O2) is 2.6 eV. This is substantially smaller than the value of 3.36 eV obtained by DFT calculations. However, this enthalpy depends strongly on vacancy concentration [46]: for example, it is 4.9 eV when x = 103. However, more recent results have created a great deal of confusion. The energy to form vacan- cies depends on the temperature of calcination: calcining at high temperature leads to a form of ceria that binds oxygen very strongly [47]. It appears that nano-structured ceria releases oxygen more readily than bulk ceria [4851]. A possible, simple explana- tion may be that in systems with very high surface area one detects the formation of surface oxygen vacancies; their formation re- quires lower energy than forming bulk vacancies. Some measure- ments have correlated the uptake or release of oxygen with the area [48]. Nano-rods of ceria displaying the (0 0 1) and (1 1 0) faces are more active in oxidizing CO than nano-particles of ceria [52] which suggests a dependence of the energy to form oxygen vacan- cies on the crystal face, which is supported by computations [53]."
          [3] "The state having the lowest energy, for the doped slab, has zero spin polarization. Replacing a Ce atom in the surface layer with a Pt atom causes a change in the atomic positions in the top layer: the oxygen atoms neighboring the Pt dopant are closer to it than they were to the Ce atom that has been substituted: the PtO distance is 2.12 Å while the CeO distance in the pure ceria is 2.33 Å. The 2.12 Å PtO distance in doped ceria is longer than the PtO distance in PtO2 (the measured PtO distance is 1.99 Å and the calculated one is 2.00 Å). As the oxygen atoms get closer to the Pt dopant, their distance to the Ce atoms increases from 2.33 Å to 2.43 Å. This increase in the CeO distance suggests that the strength of this bond is diminished. Furthermore, an increased PtO bond, when compared to that of PtO2, suggests that the PtO bond in doped ceria is not as strong as the PtO bond in PtO2."
          [4] "The weakening of the bond between the oxygen atoms neigh- boring the Pt atom is reflected in the change in the energy required for making an oxygen vacancy. To remove an O atom from the top layer of the pure oxide, to form a O2 molecule in the gas phase,costs 3.00 eV. The lowest energy state of a pure ceria slab with an oxygen vacancy in it has Ns = 2 (two unpaired spins). The forma- tion energy for pure ceria is consistent with that calculated by Ganduglia-Pirovano et al. [41]. For the Pt-doped ceria, the forma- tion of an oxygen vacancy, in the top layer, near the dopant, costs 2.15 eV. The lowest energy state of the slab with a vacancy in it has Ns = 0."
          [5] "The removal of an oxygen atom, to form a vacancy, leaves be- hind the two electrons that had formed the oxygenmetal bond. Previous calculations, using DFT + U, have shown that these elec- trons are localized on the f-orbitals of two Ce atoms, converting Ce4+ ions to Ce3+. However, one should keep in mind that these for- mal charges are merely a metaphor: a more appropriate statement would be that the formation of a vacancy reduces the positive charge on the Ce atoms. This behavior is different from that ob- tained with DFTGGA, which does not show the formal reduction of Ce4+ to Ce3+. The experiments suggest that this reduction is pres- ent and this is one of the reasons for the current preference for DFT + U. To test the degree of reduction, we calculated the Bader charges [41,43,44] before and after vacancy formation. The results,for pure ceria, are shown in Fig. 7a and b. The cerium atom in the surface layer of pure ceria has a positive charge of 2.33 (i.e. when forming the oxide the Ce atom donates 2.33 electrons) and the charge on the oxygen atoms (in both the top and the second layer) is 1.18 (when forming the oxide an oxygen atom gains 1.18 elec- trons). When the vacancy is formed, the triangular symmetry of the Ce atoms closest to the surface is broken: the charge on two of the Ce atoms surrounding the vacancy changes from 2.33 to 2.11. The charge on the third Ce atom neighboring the vacancy is unchanged. The formation of the vacancy hardly changes the charge on the oxygen atoms (see Fig. 7b). It is debatable whether the small decrease in the positive charge on two of the Ce atoms,when the vacancy is formed, entitles us to say that Ce4+ is reduced to Ce3+. The experimental evidence for the reduction of Ce upon the formation of an oxygen vacancy is based on the XPS spectra. When the oxide is reduced, a shoulder develops in the XPS spectrum at energies where the XPS spectrum of Ce in Ce2O3 is located. Unfor- tunately, the position of the XPS peaks depends on the electronic structure of the initial and final state, not only on the charge of the atom. Therefore, we do not consider the XPS spectra as provid- ing conclusive evidence for Ce reduction. Theory is not helpful either since the electronic structure is affected by the value of U,and there is no compelling reason to adopt a specific U value."
          [6] "The effect of doping on the atomic charges is shown in Fig. 7c. Replacing a Ce atom with a Pt atom reduces the charge on the adja- cent oxygen atoms in the top layer from 1.18 to 1.03. Pt has a much lower positive charge than the Ce atom it replaced (1.35 in- stead of 2.33). The main effect of vacancy creation is the reduction of Pt (its charge changes from 1.36 to 0.83). This is accompanied by a small reduction of the positive charge on cerium and a slight in- crease of the negative charge on oxygen. The presence of a reduc- ible dopant in a reducible oxide introduces a new element controlling the fate of the electrons left behind when O is removed:they can reduce the cations of the host or the dopant and in the present case the dopant is reduced. Either effect contributes to lowering the energy of vacancy formation."
          [7] "Because of these difficulties in validating the calculated the en- ergy of vacancy formation, we do not place much emphasis on the absolute values of the numbers but assume that the qualitative conclusion that the presence of Pt lowers substantially the energy required for making an oxygen vacancy is correct."
          [8] "As shown in previous work [40,53,57,58], dopants that lower the energy of oxygen-vacancy formation make the oxide a more reactive (than the undoped oxide). This suggests that, in the case of methane activation, the oxygen atoms whose bond to the sur- face is weakened by the presence of Pt will form stronger bonds with the CH3 radical and the hydrogen atom formed by breaking the CH bond. An alternative is that some of the dissociation frag- ments may bind to the Pt dopant. The BronstedEvansPolanyi rule [1322] further suggests that a stronger binding of the prod- ucts will result in a lowering of the activation energy for bond breaking. Theory can test these inferences."
          [9] "Our DFT calculations show that methane dissociates to form a CH3 radical and an H atom, and these two fragments bind to two of the oxygen atoms weakened by the presence of the dopant."
          [10] "The reaction path for this process, obtained with the nudged elastic band (NEB) method [59,60], is shown in Fig. 8. The key energies are given on the potential energy diagrams in Fig. 9. The geometries of these key states are shown in Fig. 10 (on pure ceria) and Fig. 11 (on doped ceria)."
          [11] "Different points on the graph shown in Fig. 8 correspond to dif- ferent geometries along the reaction path. The NEB method opti- mizes these points so that the line joining them passes through the transition state. The shape of the rubber band for the disso- ciative adsorption of methane on Pt-doped ceria is very unusual. The geometry 1 corresponds to physisorbed methane. The binding energy is 0.16 eV, on doped ceria, and 0.21 eV on pure ceria (see Fig. 9). DFT does not include van der Waals interactions and there- fore, the measured binding energy should be larger than these val- ues. The structure of the physisorbed methane on pure ceria is shown in Fig. 10a. A hydrogen atom in methane coordinates to an oxygen atom in the top layer. The position of methane on the Pt-doped ceria is fairly similar. There is no indication that Pt forms a bond with CH4."
          [12] "The geometries 57 along the NEB (see Fig. 8) correspond to a rapid rise of the energy caused by the breaking of the CH bond. Point 7 corresponds to the transition state, whose energy is 1.29 eV on pure ceria, and 1.08 eV on Pt-doped ceria (Fig. 9). The important qualitative result is that doping lowers the activation energy for the breaking of the CH bond. This is the rate-limiting step in all methane activation processes. The geometry of the tran- sition state, for pure ceria, is shown in Fig. 10d. An oxygenH bond of 1.22 Å is formed with one of the oxygen atoms in the top layer;the CH bond is stretched but not broken (its length is 1.41 Å). The geometry of the transition state on the Pt-doped surface is shown in Fig. 11d. This is very similar to the one seen for pure ceria, except that the activation energy is lower. The Pt dopant does not form bonds with the methane or any of the fragments (H or CH3) created by dissociation. The role of Pt is to activate the oxygen atoms next to it."
          [13] "The points 822 correspond to metastable states in which the CH3 group swings around to move close to an oxygen atom on the surface. This large-scale motion does not involve bond stretch- ing or breaking, and this is why the energy does not change much even though the geometry does. The energy of the metastable states is lower than the TS energy, and it is 1.08 eV on pure ceria and 0.90 eV on doped ceria. One of the metastable geometries is shown in Fig. 10c, for pure ceria, and Fig. 11c, for doped ceria."
          [14] "The rapid decrease in energy, as the geometry changes from the points 21 to 25 (Fig. 8), corresponds to the formation of the bond between the C atom in CH3 and an oxygen atom in the surface. The energy of the dissociated state is 1.31 eV for pure ceria and 2.11 eV on doped ceria (see Fig. 9). The geometries of the dissoci- ated states are shown in Fig. 10b (for pure ceria) and Fig. 11b (for doped ceria). Both fragments are binding to oxygen atoms in the surface layers. In the case of the Pt-doped surface, the methyl rad- ical is slightly rotated (when compared to its position on pure cer- ia) so that one H atom gets closer to the Pt atom."
          [15] "The Bader charges on the atoms in the transition state and the final, dissociated state on pure ceria are shown in Fig. 12a and b. The most conspicuous feature is the large change on the charge on the carbon from 0.44 in the transition state to 0.24 in the methoxide formed when CH3 binds to the surface. The charge of the hydrogen atom forming the hydroxyl changes from 0.39 in the transition state to 0.63 in the final (dissociated) state. This is accompanied by a substantial change in the charge of the oxygen atom forming the hydroxyl from 1.17 to 1.34. The electron charge lost by the carbon atom, when going from the transition state to the final state, is donated to the Ce and the O atoms, each of them taking a small amount of electron charge. A similar behav- ior is observed for Pt-doped ceria. It is remarkable that in spite of the large charge transfer occurring on the carbon and the H and O atoms forming the hydroxyl, there is no charge change on the Pt atom."

[1] "An essential step in the Marsvan Krevelen oxidation mechanism is the reaction of a surface oxygen atom with a gas-phase reducing agent, to form an oxidation product and an oxygen vacancy on the surface. The high energy required for forming an oxygen vacancy is one reason why oxides perform oxidation reactions at high temperature."
          [2] "We expect that the dopant lowers the oxidation temperature by weakening the bond between the oxygen and the oxide. Thus, we can measure the oxidizing capacity of an oxide by calculating the energy needed to form a vacancy."
          [3] "However, it is important to keep in mind that this is not a measure of catalytic activity, because a second important step is the ability to heal the vacancy formed by the oxidation process by adsorbing and activating oxygen from the gas phase."

[1] "Some (Cu, Fe) are capable of having two different valence states, whereas some (Zn, Mg, Al) have only one. All of them lower substantially the energy of vacancy formation on the two faces."
          [2] "The oxygen atoms that are easier to remove are more reactive, and the lowering of the energy of oxygen-vacancy formation is a good descriptor of the extent to which doping makes the oxide a better oxidant."
          [3] "For example, (2, 3, 5) for several doped oxides, CO reacts more readily with an oxygen atom near the dopant than it would in the absence of the dopant: doping facilitates the Marsvan Krevelen mechanism (6, 7) for oxidation."
          [4] "Dopants having a higher valence than the cation they replace in the oxide (e.g., Zn oxide doped with Ti) tend to adsorb O2 from the gas phase and activate it to make it a better oxidant."
          [5] "The oxygen atoms engaged in the oxidation reaction come from the gas phase not from the surface."
          [6] "Doping facilitates the dissociative adsorption of molecules. This happens either because one of the fragments binds to the dopant and the other to an oxygen atom nearby or because both fragments bind to the surface oxygen atoms activated by the presence of the dopant."
          [7] "The energy of oxygen-vacancy formation can be used as a crude predictor of the ability of the oxygen atoms at the surface of the oxide to engage in chemical reactions."

If a Mars-van Krevelen mechanism is accepted for CO oxidation on Corresponding author.E-mail addresses: boronat@itq.upv.es (M. Boronat), acorma@itq.upv.es (A. Corma). Au/CeO2, then CO2 is formed when CO takes a oxygen atom from the oxide surface creating a oxygen vacancy defect, and therefore the oxidation activity of a catalyst should be inversely related to the oxygen vacancy energy formation.



[1] "It is widely believed that CO directly combines with lattice oxygen atom on ceria, through the Marsvan Krevelen mechanism [7]. However, the relevant reaction dynamics has not been satisfactorily unravelled."
          [2] "If we define the formation energy of an O vacancy as: Evac = E(cellvac) + 1/2E(O2)  E(cell), where the E (cellvac) and E (cell) are total energies of the optimized surfaces with and without an oxygen vacancy, and E (O2) is the total energy of an oxygen molecule in the gas phase, the calculated value of Evac for the undoped CeO2 (111) surface is 2.87 eV per vacancy. By contrast, Evac of the Ce0.75Zr0.25O2 (111) surface is reduced by approximately 20% to 2.35 eV."
          [3] "Zr dopants reduce the energy cost for the formation of oxygen vacancy [4, 29] and thus increase the mobility of lattice oxygen atoms nearby [30]."
          [3] "The presence of Zr dopant promotes the Ce4+  Ce3+ reduction and hence should assist the release of OL, as attested by the reduction of the formation energy of oxygen vacancy."

[1] "The energy of vacancy formation is an indirect measure of the ability of the oxide to work as an oxidant in catalytic oxidation taking place by a Marsvan Krevelen mechanism."
          [2] "If the oxygen is too easy to remove, it is difficult to put it back."
          [3] "In designing an oxidation catalyst, by doping an oxide, one should aim for the middle ground: the dopant should make it easy to remove an oxygen atom, but not too easy."
          [4] "We call this a moderation principle."
          [1] "In the Marsvan Krevelen (MvK) mechanism, the reductant is oxidized by the oxygen atoms from the surface of the oxide (not by adsorbed oxygen). The easier it is to make a vacancy, the better oxidant the surface is."
          [2] "This implies that doping an oxide surface with a LVD makes it a better oxidant."
          [3] "If the oxygen is too easy to remove, it is difficult to put it back."
          [4] "In designing an oxidation catalyst, by doping an oxide, one should aim for the middle ground: the dopant should make it easy to remove an oxygen atom, but not too easy."

The energy (Evf) required for removing one of the oxygen atoms to form a vacancy in the surface layer and half an oxygen molecule in the gas phase.
          On the other hand, CO oxidation by using any one of the four oxygen atoms of the AuxTi1xO2 surface is exothermic; on this surface CO oxidation is thermodynamically favored.
          After adsorption, the oxygen molecule reacts with gas-phase CO to form a carbonate (figure 1e), with a very substantial release of energy (about 4 eV). This complex decomposes to release CO2 and leaves behind an oxygen atom that fills the vacancy. This restores the surface to its initial state, which means that this set of reactions is catalytic.
          The essential elements of the oxidation mechanism proposed here involve the weakening, by the dopant, of the bond between the oxygen atoms in the top surface layer and the oxide, and the reactivity of the oxygen vacancy and of the molecules adsorbed at an oxygen vacancy site.
          The stability of the doped oxide depends on the method of preparation and the composition of the reacting gases.
          A good oxidation catalyst in this class of compounds requires a fine balance between the rate of oxide reduction and oxidation.
          The error is caused by the electron self- interaction in DFT, which favors the delocalization of the electron in the d- or f-bands where the electron should be localized on individual atoms.
          A good catalyst in this class must strike a balance between the ability to donate an oxygen atom during oxidation, and that of taking oxy- gen from the gas phase to heal the oxygen vacancy formed by the oxidation reaction.
          The oxidation takes place by a Mars-van Krevelen mechanism;
          To determine to what extent the oxide becomes a better oxidant when doped with Au, we have calcu- lated the energy (Evf) required for removing one of the oxygen atoms to form a vacancy in the surface layer and half an oxygen molecule in the gas phase.
          Doping weakens dramatically the bond of surface oxygen to the oxide, even when a Ti atom is substituted by Au in the slab sub layer (not shown).
          However, O2 binds more weakly on an bridging-oxygen vacancy on the Au-doped (DeO2  0:68 eV) than on a pure TiO2(110) surface (DeO2  2:80 eV).





If a doped oxide is used as an oxidation catalyst by a Marsvan Krevelen mechanism, then one should seek a dopant that makes it easy to make oxygen vacancies, but not too easy. Informally, we call this a moderation principle. The point is that, if the oxygen is very easy to remove, then it is a very good oxidant, but not a good oxidation catalyst, since it is difficult to put the oxygen back.

[1] "This reaction follows the Mars van Krevelen mechanism, (16) in which CO removes oxygen from the oxide. This oxygen is then replenished in some way, regenerating the catalyst. It is now understood that, in order to enhance the formation of CO2 from CO, the key quantity is the formation energy of an oxygen vacancy in the oxide; by making the oxygen vacancy formation energy more favorable, the oxidation of CO can be enhanced."
          [1] "A large number of chemical reactions have been studied with ceria as the catalyst, key among these being CO oxidation to CO2. (6-15) This reaction follows the Mars van Krevelen mechanism, (16) in which CO removes oxygen from the oxide. This oxygen is then replenished in some way, regenerating the catalyst. It is now understood that, in order to enhance the formation of CO2 from CO, the key quantity is the formation energy of an oxygen vacancy in the oxide; by making the oxygen vacancy formation energy more favorable, the oxidation of CO can be enhanced."

[1] "In such reactions, the gases introduced in the reactor contain a reductant (e.g., an alkane, CO, H2) and an oxidant (e.g., O2, CO2, N2O). In the Marsvan Krevelen mechanism, the reductant is oxidized by the oxygen atoms from the oxides surface layer (not by adsorbed oxygen or by gas-phase oxygen). When the oxidation products desorb, they leave behind oxygen vacancies. The role of the gas-phase oxidant, introduced with the feed, is to annihilate the oxygen vacancies (to reoxidize the surface)."
          [2] "The assumption is that the smaller is ΔEv, the better oxidant is the surface. Once we accept this idea, we can calculate ΔEv for a quick screening of the oxidative power of various oxides (doped or undoped). Moreover, if we want to make an oxide a better oxidant, we should look for modifications that make ΔEv smaller."
          [3] "However, one must keep in mind that a very small ΔEv means that the surface is a good oxidant, but it is not necessarily a good oxidation catalyst. To complete the catalytic cycle, the gaseous oxidant (oxygen, CO2, N2O) must be able to reoxidize the surface. If oxygen is too easy to remove from the surface layer, it will be difficult to put back."

"Many oxides catalyze oxidation reactions through the Marsvan Krevelen mechanism in which the oxygen is supplied from the surface of the oxide. 59 The reduced oxide is reoxidized by reacting with the oxygen molecules in the gas. As the oxygen supplied to the molecule being oxidized comes from the surface of the oxide, the energy of formation of an oxygen vacancy (VO) at the surface of the oxide is often a good indicator of the oxidizing power of the oxide."

[1] "The energy of CO reaction with an oxygen atom from the surface layer decays linearly with the energy of vacancy formation ΔEv, whereas the energy of adsorption of O2 at a vacancy is a linear function of ΔEv."
          [2] "These are the only two reactions in the mechanism whose energy varies from one doped oxide to another."
          [3] "Because they both depend on the energy of oxygen vacancy formation, the latter quantity is a good descriptor of catalytic activity."
          [4] "In deciding which intermediate reactions are most likely from an energetic point of view, we impose a spin conservation rule: a reaction that requires flipping a spin is too slow for catalysis."
          [5] "Because of this, we only consider reactions that conserve spin."
          [6] "We find that all the dopants studied here lower the energy of vacancy formation; therefore, the doped oxides are better oxidants than the undoped ones."



[2] "The energy of oxygen-vacancy formation has been measured but the results are at variance due to differences in the method of preparation. It is therefore not possible to compare reliably the values calculated here with experiments. Measurements of the equilibrium between gaseous O2 and ceria have been used to determine the enthalpy of oxygen-vacancy formation, and the re- sults have been reviewed by Mongensen et al. [46]. It was found that when x in CeO2x is 105 the enthalpy of vacancy formation (to generate O2) is 2.6 eV. This is substantially smaller than the value of 3.36 eV obtained by DFT calculations. However, this enthalpy depends strongly on vacancy concentration [46]: for example, it is 4.9 eV when x = 103. However, more recent results have created a great deal of confusion. The energy to form vacan- cies depends on the temperature of calcination: calcining at high temperature leads to a form of ceria that binds oxygen very strongly [47]. It appears that nano-structured ceria releases oxygen more readily than bulk ceria [4851]. A possible, simple explana- tion may be that in systems with very high surface area one detects the formation of surface oxygen vacancies; their formation re- quires lower energy than forming bulk vacancies. Some measure- ments have correlated the uptake or release of oxygen with the area [48]. Nano-rods of ceria displaying the (0 0 1) and (1 1 0) faces are more active in oxidizing CO than nano-particles of ceria [52] which suggests a dependence of the energy to form oxygen vacan- cies on the crystal face, which is supported by computations [53]."
          [3] "The state having the lowest energy, for the doped slab, has zero spin polarization. Replacing a Ce atom in the surface layer with a Pt atom causes a change in the atomic positions in the top layer: the oxygen atoms neighboring the Pt dopant are closer to it than they were to the Ce atom that has been substituted: the PtO distance is 2.12 Å while the CeO distance in the pure ceria is 2.33 Å. The 2.12 Å PtO distance in doped ceria is longer than the PtO distance in PtO2 (the measured PtO distance is 1.99 Å and the calculated one is 2.00 Å). As the oxygen atoms get closer to the Pt dopant, their distance to the Ce atoms increases from 2.33 Å to 2.43 Å. This increase in the CeO distance suggests that the strength of this bond is diminished. Furthermore, an increased PtO bond, when compared to that of PtO2, suggests that the PtO bond in doped ceria is not as strong as the PtO bond in PtO2."
          [4] "The weakening of the bond between the oxygen atoms neigh- boring the Pt atom is reflected in the change in the energy required for making an oxygen vacancy. To remove an O atom from the top layer of the pure oxide, to form a O2 molecule in the gas phase,costs 3.00 eV. The lowest energy state of a pure ceria slab with an oxygen vacancy in it has Ns = 2 (two unpaired spins). The forma- tion energy for pure ceria is consistent with that calculated by Ganduglia-Pirovano et al. [41]. For the Pt-doped ceria, the forma- tion of an oxygen vacancy, in the top layer, near the dopant, costs 2.15 eV. The lowest energy state of the slab with a vacancy in it has Ns = 0."
          [5] "The removal of an oxygen atom, to form a vacancy, leaves be- hind the two electrons that had formed the oxygenmetal bond. Previous calculations, using DFT + U, have shown that these elec- trons are localized on the f-orbitals of two Ce atoms, converting Ce4+ ions to Ce3+. However, one should keep in mind that these for- mal charges are merely a metaphor: a more appropriate statement would be that the formation of a vacancy reduces the positive charge on the Ce atoms. This behavior is different from that ob- tained with DFTGGA, which does not show the formal reduction of Ce4+ to Ce3+. The experiments suggest that this reduction is pres- ent and this is one of the reasons for the current preference for DFT + U. To test the degree of reduction, we calculated the Bader charges [41,43,44] before and after vacancy formation. The results,for pure ceria, are shown in Fig. 7a and b. The cerium atom in the surface layer of pure ceria has a positive charge of 2.33 (i.e. when forming the oxide the Ce atom donates 2.33 electrons) and the charge on the oxygen atoms (in both the top and the second layer) is 1.18 (when forming the oxide an oxygen atom gains 1.18 elec- trons). When the vacancy is formed, the triangular symmetry of the Ce atoms closest to the surface is broken: the charge on two of the Ce atoms surrounding the vacancy changes from 2.33 to 2.11. The charge on the third Ce atom neighboring the vacancy is unchanged. The formation of the vacancy hardly changes the charge on the oxygen atoms (see Fig. 7b). It is debatable whether the small decrease in the positive charge on two of the Ce atoms,when the vacancy is formed, entitles us to say that Ce4+ is reduced to Ce3+. The experimental evidence for the reduction of Ce upon the formation of an oxygen vacancy is based on the XPS spectra. When the oxide is reduced, a shoulder develops in the XPS spectrum at energies where the XPS spectrum of Ce in Ce2O3 is located. Unfor- tunately, the position of the XPS peaks depends on the electronic structure of the initial and final state, not only on the charge of the atom. Therefore, we do not consider the XPS spectra as provid- ing conclusive evidence for Ce reduction. Theory is not helpful either since the electronic structure is affected by the value of U,and there is no compelling reason to adopt a specific U value."
          [6] "The effect of doping on the atomic charges is shown in Fig. 7c. Replacing a Ce atom with a Pt atom reduces the charge on the adja- cent oxygen atoms in the top layer from 1.18 to 1.03. Pt has a much lower positive charge than the Ce atom it replaced (1.35 in- stead of 2.33). The main effect of vacancy creation is the reduction of Pt (its charge changes from 1.36 to 0.83). This is accompanied by a small reduction of the positive charge on cerium and a slight in- crease of the negative charge on oxygen. The presence of a reduc- ible dopant in a reducible oxide introduces a new element controlling the fate of the electrons left behind when O is removed:they can reduce the cations of the host or the dopant and in the present case the dopant is reduced. Either effect contributes to lowering the energy of vacancy formation."
          [7] "Because of these difficulties in validating the calculated the en- ergy of vacancy formation, we do not place much emphasis on the absolute values of the numbers but assume that the qualitative conclusion that the presence of Pt lowers substantially the energy required for making an oxygen vacancy is correct."
          [8] "As shown in previous work [40,53,57,58], dopants that lower the energy of oxygen-vacancy formation make the oxide a more reactive (than the undoped oxide). This suggests that, in the case of methane activation, the oxygen atoms whose bond to the sur- face is weakened by the presence of Pt will form stronger bonds with the CH3 radical and the hydrogen atom formed by breaking the CH bond. An alternative is that some of the dissociation frag- ments may bind to the Pt dopant. The BronstedEvansPolanyi rule [1322] further suggests that a stronger binding of the prod- ucts will result in a lowering of the activation energy for bond breaking. Theory can test these inferences."
          [9] "Our DFT calculations show that methane dissociates to form a CH3 radical and an H atom, and these two fragments bind to two of the oxygen atoms weakened by the presence of the dopant."
          [10] "The reaction path for this process, obtained with the nudged elastic band (NEB) method [59,60], is shown in Fig. 8. The key energies are given on the potential energy diagrams in Fig. 9. The geometries of these key states are shown in Fig. 10 (on pure ceria) and Fig. 11 (on doped ceria)."
          [11] "Different points on the graph shown in Fig. 8 correspond to dif- ferent geometries along the reaction path. The NEB method opti- mizes these points so that the line joining them passes through the transition state. The shape of the rubber band for the disso- ciative adsorption of methane on Pt-doped ceria is very unusual. The geometry 1 corresponds to physisorbed methane. The binding energy is 0.16 eV, on doped ceria, and 0.21 eV on pure ceria (see Fig. 9). DFT does not include van der Waals interactions and there- fore, the measured binding energy should be larger than these val- ues. The structure of the physisorbed methane on pure ceria is shown in Fig. 10a. A hydrogen atom in methane coordinates to an oxygen atom in the top layer. The position of methane on the Pt-doped ceria is fairly similar. There is no indication that Pt forms a bond with CH4."
          [12] "The geometries 57 along the NEB (see Fig. 8) correspond to a rapid rise of the energy caused by the breaking of the CH bond. Point 7 corresponds to the transition state, whose energy is 1.29 eV on pure ceria, and 1.08 eV on Pt-doped ceria (Fig. 9). The important qualitative result is that doping lowers the activation energy for the breaking of the CH bond. This is the rate-limiting step in all methane activation processes. The geometry of the tran- sition state, for pure ceria, is shown in Fig. 10d. An oxygenH bond of 1.22 Å is formed with one of the oxygen atoms in the top layer;the CH bond is stretched but not broken (its length is 1.41 Å). The geometry of the transition state on the Pt-doped surface is shown in Fig. 11d. This is very similar to the one seen for pure ceria, except that the activation energy is lower. The Pt dopant does not form bonds with the methane or any of the fragments (H or CH3) created by dissociation. The role of Pt is to activate the oxygen atoms next to it."
          [13] "The points 822 correspond to metastable states in which the CH3 group swings around to move close to an oxygen atom on the surface. This large-scale motion does not involve bond stretch- ing or breaking, and this is why the energy does not change much even though the geometry does. The energy of the metastable states is lower than the TS energy, and it is 1.08 eV on pure ceria and 0.90 eV on doped ceria. One of the metastable geometries is shown in Fig. 10c, for pure ceria, and Fig. 11c, for doped ceria."
          [14] "The rapid decrease in energy, as the geometry changes from the points 21 to 25 (Fig. 8), corresponds to the formation of the bond between the C atom in CH3 and an oxygen atom in the surface. The energy of the dissociated state is 1.31 eV for pure ceria and 2.11 eV on doped ceria (see Fig. 9). The geometries of the dissoci- ated states are shown in Fig. 10b (for pure ceria) and Fig. 11b (for doped ceria). Both fragments are binding to oxygen atoms in the surface layers. In the case of the Pt-doped surface, the methyl rad- ical is slightly rotated (when compared to its position on pure cer- ia) so that one H atom gets closer to the Pt atom."
          [15] "The Bader charges on the atoms in the transition state and the final, dissociated state on pure ceria are shown in Fig. 12a and b. The most conspicuous feature is the large change on the charge on the carbon from 0.44 in the transition state to 0.24 in the methoxide formed when CH3 binds to the surface. The charge of the hydrogen atom forming the hydroxyl changes from 0.39 in the transition state to 0.63 in the final (dissociated) state. This is accompanied by a substantial change in the charge of the oxygen atom forming the hydroxyl from 1.17 to 1.34. The electron charge lost by the carbon atom, when going from the transition state to the final state, is donated to the Ce and the O atoms, each of them taking a small amount of electron charge. A similar behav- ior is observed for Pt-doped ceria. It is remarkable that in spite of the large charge transfer occurring on the carbon and the H and O atoms forming the hydroxyl, there is no charge change on the Pt atom."

[1] "An essential step in the Marsvan Krevelen oxidation mechanism is the reaction of a surface oxygen atom with a gas-phase reducing agent, to form an oxidation product and an oxygen vacancy on the surface. The high energy required for forming an oxygen vacancy is one reason why oxides perform oxidation reactions at high temperature."
          [2] "We expect that the dopant lowers the oxidation temperature by weakening the bond between the oxygen and the oxide. Thus, we can measure the oxidizing capacity of an oxide by calculating the energy needed to form a vacancy."
          [3] "However, it is important to keep in mind that this is not a measure of catalytic activity, because a second important step is the ability to heal the vacancy formed by the oxidation process by adsorbing and activating oxygen from the gas phase."

[1] "Some (Cu, Fe) are capable of having two different valence states, whereas some (Zn, Mg, Al) have only one. All of them lower substantially the energy of vacancy formation on the two faces."
          [2] "The oxygen atoms that are easier to remove are more reactive, and the lowering of the energy of oxygen-vacancy formation is a good descriptor of the extent to which doping makes the oxide a better oxidant."
          [3] "For example, (2, 3, 5) for several doped oxides, CO reacts more readily with an oxygen atom near the dopant than it would in the absence of the dopant: doping facilitates the Marsvan Krevelen mechanism (6, 7) for oxidation."
          [4] "Dopants having a higher valence than the cation they replace in the oxide (e.g., Zn oxide doped with Ti) tend to adsorb O2 from the gas phase and activate it to make it a better oxidant."
          [5] "The oxygen atoms engaged in the oxidation reaction come from the gas phase not from the surface."
          [6] "Doping facilitates the dissociative adsorption of molecules. This happens either because one of the fragments binds to the dopant and the other to an oxygen atom nearby or because both fragments bind to the surface oxygen atoms activated by the presence of the dopant."
          [7] "The energy of oxygen-vacancy formation can be used as a crude predictor of the ability of the oxygen atoms at the surface of the oxide to engage in chemical reactions."

If a Mars-van Krevelen mechanism is accepted for CO oxidation on Corresponding author.E-mail addresses: boronat@itq.upv.es (M. Boronat), acorma@itq.upv.es (A. Corma). Au/CeO2, then CO2 is formed when CO takes a oxygen atom from the oxide surface creating a oxygen vacancy defect, and therefore the oxidation activity of a catalyst should be inversely related to the oxygen vacancy energy formation.



[1] "It is widely believed that CO directly combines with lattice oxygen atom on ceria, through the Marsvan Krevelen mechanism [7]. However, the relevant reaction dynamics has not been satisfactorily unravelled."
          [2] "If we define the formation energy of an O vacancy as: Evac = E(cellvac) + 1/2E(O2)  E(cell), where the E (cellvac) and E (cell) are total energies of the optimized surfaces with and without an oxygen vacancy, and E (O2) is the total energy of an oxygen molecule in the gas phase, the calculated value of Evac for the undoped CeO2 (111) surface is 2.87 eV per vacancy. By contrast, Evac of the Ce0.75Zr0.25O2 (111) surface is reduced by approximately 20% to 2.35 eV."
          [3] "Zr dopants reduce the energy cost for the formation of oxygen vacancy [4, 29] and thus increase the mobility of lattice oxygen atoms nearby [30]."
          [3] "The presence of Zr dopant promotes the Ce4+  Ce3+ reduction and hence should assist the release of OL, as attested by the reduction of the formation energy of oxygen vacancy."

[1] "The energy of vacancy formation is an indirect measure of the ability of the oxide to work as an oxidant in catalytic oxidation taking place by a Marsvan Krevelen mechanism."
          [2] "If the oxygen is too easy to remove, it is difficult to put it back."
          [3] "In designing an oxidation catalyst, by doping an oxide, one should aim for the middle ground: the dopant should make it easy to remove an oxygen atom, but not too easy."
          [4] "We call this a moderation principle."
          [1] "In the Marsvan Krevelen (MvK) mechanism, the reductant is oxidized by the oxygen atoms from the surface of the oxide (not by adsorbed oxygen). The easier it is to make a vacancy, the better oxidant the surface is."
          [2] "This implies that doping an oxide surface with a LVD makes it a better oxidant."
          [3] "If the oxygen is too easy to remove, it is difficult to put it back."
          [4] "In designing an oxidation catalyst, by doping an oxide, one should aim for the middle ground: the dopant should make it easy to remove an oxygen atom, but not too easy."

The energy (Evf) required for removing one of the oxygen atoms to form a vacancy in the surface layer and half an oxygen molecule in the gas phase.
          On the other hand, CO oxidation by using any one of the four oxygen atoms of the AuxTi1xO2 surface is exothermic; on this surface CO oxidation is thermodynamically favored.
          After adsorption, the oxygen molecule reacts with gas-phase CO to form a carbonate (figure 1e), with a very substantial release of energy (about 4 eV). This complex decomposes to release CO2 and leaves behind an oxygen atom that fills the vacancy. This restores the surface to its initial state, which means that this set of reactions is catalytic.
          The essential elements of the oxidation mechanism proposed here involve the weakening, by the dopant, of the bond between the oxygen atoms in the top surface layer and the oxide, and the reactivity of the oxygen vacancy and of the molecules adsorbed at an oxygen vacancy site.
          The stability of the doped oxide depends on the method of preparation and the composition of the reacting gases.
          A good oxidation catalyst in this class of compounds requires a fine balance between the rate of oxide reduction and oxidation.
          The error is caused by the electron self- interaction in DFT, which favors the delocalization of the electron in the d- or f-bands where the electron should be localized on individual atoms.
          A good catalyst in this class must strike a balance between the ability to donate an oxygen atom during oxidation, and that of taking oxy- gen from the gas phase to heal the oxygen vacancy formed by the oxidation reaction.
          The oxidation takes place by a Mars-van Krevelen mechanism;
          To determine to what extent the oxide becomes a better oxidant when doped with Au, we have calcu- lated the energy (Evf) required for removing one of the oxygen atoms to form a vacancy in the surface layer and half an oxygen molecule in the gas phase.
          Doping weakens dramatically the bond of surface oxygen to the oxide, even when a Ti atom is substituted by Au in the slab sub layer (not shown).
          However, O2 binds more weakly on an bridging-oxygen vacancy on the Au-doped (DeO2  0:68 eV) than on a pure TiO2(110) surface (DeO2  2:80 eV).





If a doped oxide is used as an oxidation catalyst by a Marsvan Krevelen mechanism, then one should seek a dopant that makes it easy to make oxygen vacancies, but not too easy. Informally, we call this a moderation principle. The point is that, if the oxygen is very easy to remove, then it is a very good oxidant, but not a good oxidation catalyst, since it is difficult to put the oxygen back.

[1] "This reaction follows the Mars van Krevelen mechanism, (16) in which CO removes oxygen from the oxide. This oxygen is then replenished in some way, regenerating the catalyst. It is now understood that, in order to enhance the formation of CO2 from CO, the key quantity is the formation energy of an oxygen vacancy in the oxide; by making the oxygen vacancy formation energy more favorable, the oxidation of CO can be enhanced."
          [1] "A large number of chemical reactions have been studied with ceria as the catalyst, key among these being CO oxidation to CO2. (6-15) This reaction follows the Mars van Krevelen mechanism, (16) in which CO removes oxygen from the oxide. This oxygen is then replenished in some way, regenerating the catalyst. It is now understood that, in order to enhance the formation of CO2 from CO, the key quantity is the formation energy of an oxygen vacancy in the oxide; by making the oxygen vacancy formation energy more favorable, the oxidation of CO can be enhanced."

[1] "In such reactions, the gases introduced in the reactor contain a reductant (e.g., an alkane, CO, H2) and an oxidant (e.g., O2, CO2, N2O). In the Marsvan Krevelen mechanism, the reductant is oxidized by the oxygen atoms from the oxides surface layer (not by adsorbed oxygen or by gas-phase oxygen). When the oxidation products desorb, they leave behind oxygen vacancies. The role of the gas-phase oxidant, introduced with the feed, is to annihilate the oxygen vacancies (to reoxidize the surface)."
          [2] "The assumption is that the smaller is ΔEv, the better oxidant is the surface. Once we accept this idea, we can calculate ΔEv for a quick screening of the oxidative power of various oxides (doped or undoped). Moreover, if we want to make an oxide a better oxidant, we should look for modifications that make ΔEv smaller."
          [3] "However, one must keep in mind that a very small ΔEv means that the surface is a good oxidant, but it is not necessarily a good oxidation catalyst. To complete the catalytic cycle, the gaseous oxidant (oxygen, CO2, N2O) must be able to reoxidize the surface. If oxygen is too easy to remove from the surface layer, it will be difficult to put back."

[1] "A large fraction of the output of the chemical industry consists of products obtained by oxidation or oxidative dehydrogenation reactions catalyzed by oxides. 1-6 In most cases, the reaction proceeds through a Marsvan Krevelen mechanism. 7,8 The species to be oxidized reacts with the oxygen atoms at the surface of the oxide, creating oxygen vacancies. The reduced oxide is oxidized by reacting with gas-phase oxygen."
          [2] "We use oxygen vacancy formation energy (OVFE) as a measure of how easily lattice oxygen may participate in the Mars and Van Krevelen mechanism for oxidation reactions."
          [3] "We calculate with density functional theory how OVFE is affected when some of Zn atoms in ZnO(1010) surface layer are substituted by other metal dopants."
          [4] "We find that Li, Na, K, Rb, Cs, Os, Rh, Ir, Ni, Pd, Pt, Cu, Ag, Au, and Cd decrease OVFE and prefer to be located at the surface of ZnO rather than in the bulk."
          [5] "Mg, Ca, Sr, Ba, Sc, Y, La, Ti, Zr, Hf, Ce, V, Nb, Ta, Cr, Mo, W, Mn, Re, Fe, Ru, Co, Al, Ga, Sn, and Pb increase OVFE."
          [6] "Most of the dopants that increase OVFE prefer to substitute Zn atoms in the bulk, except for Ca, Sr, Ba, La, Ce, Re, Fe, Ru, Co, Sn, and Pb, which prefer to substitute a Zn atom at the surface."





"Many oxides catalyze oxidation reactions through the Marsvan Krevelen mechanism in which the oxygen is supplied from the surface of the oxide. 59 The reduced oxide is reoxidized by reacting with the oxygen molecules in the gas. As the oxygen supplied to the molecule being oxidized comes from the surface of the oxide, the energy of formation of an oxygen vacancy (VO) at the surface of the oxide is often a good indicator of the oxidizing power of the oxide."

[1] "The energy of CO reaction with an oxygen atom from the surface layer decays linearly with the energy of vacancy formation ΔEv, whereas the energy of adsorption of O2 at a vacancy is a linear function of ΔEv."
          [2] "These are the only two reactions in the mechanism whose energy varies from one doped oxide to another."
          [3] "Because they both depend on the energy of oxygen vacancy formation, the latter quantity is a good descriptor of catalytic activity."
          [4] "In deciding which intermediate reactions are most likely from an energetic point of view, we impose a spin conservation rule: a reaction that requires flipping a spin is too slow for catalysis."
          [5] "Because of this, we only consider reactions that conserve spin."
          [6] "We find that all the dopants studied here lower the energy of vacancy formation; therefore, the doped oxides are better oxidants than the undoped ones."



[2] "The energy of oxygen-vacancy formation has been measured but the results are at variance due to differences in the method of preparation. It is therefore not possible to compare reliably the values calculated here with experiments. Measurements of the equilibrium between gaseous O2 and ceria have been used to determine the enthalpy of oxygen-vacancy formation, and the re- sults have been reviewed by Mongensen et al. [46]. It was found that when x in CeO2x is 105 the enthalpy of vacancy formation (to generate O2) is 2.6 eV. This is substantially smaller than the value of 3.36 eV obtained by DFT calculations. However, this enthalpy depends strongly on vacancy concentration [46]: for example, it is 4.9 eV when x = 103. However, more recent results have created a great deal of confusion. The energy to form vacan- cies depends on the temperature of calcination: calcining at high temperature leads to a form of ceria that binds oxygen very strongly [47]. It appears that nano-structured ceria releases oxygen more readily than bulk ceria [4851]. A possible, simple explana- tion may be that in systems with very high surface area one detects the formation of surface oxygen vacancies; their formation re- quires lower energy than forming bulk vacancies. Some measure- ments have correlated the uptake or release of oxygen with the area [48]. Nano-rods of ceria displaying the (0 0 1) and (1 1 0) faces are more active in oxidizing CO than nano-particles of ceria [52] which suggests a dependence of the energy to form oxygen vacan- cies on the crystal face, which is supported by computations [53]."
          [3] "The state having the lowest energy, for the doped slab, has zero spin polarization. Replacing a Ce atom in the surface layer with a Pt atom causes a change in the atomic positions in the top layer: the oxygen atoms neighboring the Pt dopant are closer to it than they were to the Ce atom that has been substituted: the PtO distance is 2.12 Å while the CeO distance in the pure ceria is 2.33 Å. The 2.12 Å PtO distance in doped ceria is longer than the PtO distance in PtO2 (the measured PtO distance is 1.99 Å and the calculated one is 2.00 Å). As the oxygen atoms get closer to the Pt dopant, their distance to the Ce atoms increases from 2.33 Å to 2.43 Å. This increase in the CeO distance suggests that the strength of this bond is diminished. Furthermore, an increased PtO bond, when compared to that of PtO2, suggests that the PtO bond in doped ceria is not as strong as the PtO bond in PtO2."
          [4] "The weakening of the bond between the oxygen atoms neigh- boring the Pt atom is reflected in the change in the energy required for making an oxygen vacancy. To remove an O atom from the top layer of the pure oxide, to form a O2 molecule in the gas phase,costs 3.00 eV. The lowest energy state of a pure ceria slab with an oxygen vacancy in it has Ns = 2 (two unpaired spins). The forma- tion energy for pure ceria is consistent with that calculated by Ganduglia-Pirovano et al. [41]. For the Pt-doped ceria, the forma- tion of an oxygen vacancy, in the top layer, near the dopant, costs 2.15 eV. The lowest energy state of the slab with a vacancy in it has Ns = 0."
          [5] "The removal of an oxygen atom, to form a vacancy, leaves be- hind the two electrons that had formed the oxygenmetal bond. Previous calculations, using DFT + U, have shown that these elec- trons are localized on the f-orbitals of two Ce atoms, converting Ce4+ ions to Ce3+. However, one should keep in mind that these for- mal charges are merely a metaphor: a more appropriate statement would be that the formation of a vacancy reduces the positive charge on the Ce atoms. This behavior is different from that ob- tained with DFTGGA, which does not show the formal reduction of Ce4+ to Ce3+. The experiments suggest that this reduction is pres- ent and this is one of the reasons for the current preference for DFT + U. To test the degree of reduction, we calculated the Bader charges [41,43,44] before and after vacancy formation. The results,for pure ceria, are shown in Fig. 7a and b. The cerium atom in the surface layer of pure ceria has a positive charge of 2.33 (i.e. when forming the oxide the Ce atom donates 2.33 electrons) and the charge on the oxygen atoms (in both the top and the second layer) is 1.18 (when forming the oxide an oxygen atom gains 1.18 elec- trons). When the vacancy is formed, the triangular symmetry of the Ce atoms closest to the surface is broken: the charge on two of the Ce atoms surrounding the vacancy changes from 2.33 to 2.11. The charge on the third Ce atom neighboring the vacancy is unchanged. The formation of the vacancy hardly changes the charge on the oxygen atoms (see Fig. 7b). It is debatable whether the small decrease in the positive charge on two of the Ce atoms,when the vacancy is formed, entitles us to say that Ce4+ is reduced to Ce3+. The experimental evidence for the reduction of Ce upon the formation of an oxygen vacancy is based on the XPS spectra. When the oxide is reduced, a shoulder develops in the XPS spectrum at energies where the XPS spectrum of Ce in Ce2O3 is located. Unfor- tunately, the position of the XPS peaks depends on the electronic structure of the initial and final state, not only on the charge of the atom. Therefore, we do not consider the XPS spectra as provid- ing conclusive evidence for Ce reduction. Theory is not helpful either since the electronic structure is affected by the value of U,and there is no compelling reason to adopt a specific U value."
          [6] "The effect of doping on the atomic charges is shown in Fig. 7c. Replacing a Ce atom with a Pt atom reduces the charge on the adja- cent oxygen atoms in the top layer from 1.18 to 1.03. Pt has a much lower positive charge than the Ce atom it replaced (1.35 in- stead of 2.33). The main effect of vacancy creation is the reduction of Pt (its charge changes from 1.36 to 0.83). This is accompanied by a small reduction of the positive charge on cerium and a slight in- crease of the negative charge on oxygen. The presence of a reduc- ible dopant in a reducible oxide introduces a new element controlling the fate of the electrons left behind when O is removed:they can reduce the cations of the host or the dopant and in the present case the dopant is reduced. Either effect contributes to lowering the energy of vacancy formation."
          [7] "Because of these difficulties in validating the calculated the en- ergy of vacancy formation, we do not place much emphasis on the absolute values of the numbers but assume that the qualitative conclusion that the presence of Pt lowers substantially the energy required for making an oxygen vacancy is correct."
          [8] "As shown in previous work [40,53,57,58], dopants that lower the energy of oxygen-vacancy formation make the oxide a more reactive (than the undoped oxide). This suggests that, in the case of methane activation, the oxygen atoms whose bond to the sur- face is weakened by the presence of Pt will form stronger bonds with the CH3 radical and the hydrogen atom formed by breaking the CH bond. An alternative is that some of the dissociation frag- ments may bind to the Pt dopant. The BronstedEvansPolanyi rule [1322] further suggests that a stronger binding of the prod- ucts will result in a lowering of the activation energy for bond breaking. Theory can test these inferences."
          [9] "Our DFT calculations show that methane dissociates to form a CH3 radical and an H atom, and these two fragments bind to two of the oxygen atoms weakened by the presence of the dopant."
          [10] "The reaction path for this process, obtained with the nudged elastic band (NEB) method [59,60], is shown in Fig. 8. The key energies are given on the potential energy diagrams in Fig. 9. The geometries of these key states are shown in Fig. 10 (on pure ceria) and Fig. 11 (on doped ceria)."
          [11] "Different points on the graph shown in Fig. 8 correspond to dif- ferent geometries along the reaction path. The NEB method opti- mizes these points so that the line joining them passes through the transition state. The shape of the rubber band for the disso- ciative adsorption of methane on Pt-doped ceria is very unusual. The geometry 1 corresponds to physisorbed methane. The binding energy is 0.16 eV, on doped ceria, and 0.21 eV on pure ceria (see Fig. 9). DFT does not include van der Waals interactions and there- fore, the measured binding energy should be larger than these val- ues. The structure of the physisorbed methane on pure ceria is shown in Fig. 10a. A hydrogen atom in methane coordinates to an oxygen atom in the top layer. The position of methane on the Pt-doped ceria is fairly similar. There is no indication that Pt forms a bond with CH4."
          [12] "The geometries 57 along the NEB (see Fig. 8) correspond to a rapid rise of the energy caused by the breaking of the CH bond. Point 7 corresponds to the transition state, whose energy is 1.29 eV on pure ceria, and 1.08 eV on Pt-doped ceria (Fig. 9). The important qualitative result is that doping lowers the activation energy for the breaking of the CH bond. This is the rate-limiting step in all methane activation processes. The geometry of the tran- sition state, for pure ceria, is shown in Fig. 10d. An oxygenH bond of 1.22 Å is formed with one of the oxygen atoms in the top layer;the CH bond is stretched but not broken (its length is 1.41 Å). The geometry of the transition state on the Pt-doped surface is shown in Fig. 11d. This is very similar to the one seen for pure ceria, except that the activation energy is lower. The Pt dopant does not form bonds with the methane or any of the fragments (H or CH3) created by dissociation. The role of Pt is to activate the oxygen atoms next to it."
          [13] "The points 822 correspond to metastable states in which the CH3 group swings around to move close to an oxygen atom on the surface. This large-scale motion does not involve bond stretch- ing or breaking, and this is why the energy does not change much even though the geometry does. The energy of the metastable states is lower than the TS energy, and it is 1.08 eV on pure ceria and 0.90 eV on doped ceria. One of the metastable geometries is shown in Fig. 10c, for pure ceria, and Fig. 11c, for doped ceria."
          [14] "The rapid decrease in energy, as the geometry changes from the points 21 to 25 (Fig. 8), corresponds to the formation of the bond between the C atom in CH3 and an oxygen atom in the surface. The energy of the dissociated state is 1.31 eV for pure ceria and 2.11 eV on doped ceria (see Fig. 9). The geometries of the dissoci- ated states are shown in Fig. 10b (for pure ceria) and Fig. 11b (for doped ceria). Both fragments are binding to oxygen atoms in the surface layers. In the case of the Pt-doped surface, the methyl rad- ical is slightly rotated (when compared to its position on pure cer- ia) so that one H atom gets closer to the Pt atom."
          [15] "The Bader charges on the atoms in the transition state and the final, dissociated state on pure ceria are shown in Fig. 12a and b. The most conspicuous feature is the large change on the charge on the carbon from 0.44 in the transition state to 0.24 in the methoxide formed when CH3 binds to the surface. The charge of the hydrogen atom forming the hydroxyl changes from 0.39 in the transition state to 0.63 in the final (dissociated) state. This is accompanied by a substantial change in the charge of the oxygen atom forming the hydroxyl from 1.17 to 1.34. The electron charge lost by the carbon atom, when going from the transition state to the final state, is donated to the Ce and the O atoms, each of them taking a small amount of electron charge. A similar behav- ior is observed for Pt-doped ceria. It is remarkable that in spite of the large charge transfer occurring on the carbon and the H and O atoms forming the hydroxyl, there is no charge change on the Pt atom."

[1] "An essential step in the Marsvan Krevelen oxidation mechanism is the reaction of a surface oxygen atom with a gas-phase reducing agent, to form an oxidation product and an oxygen vacancy on the surface. The high energy required for forming an oxygen vacancy is one reason why oxides perform oxidation reactions at high temperature."
          [2] "We expect that the dopant lowers the oxidation temperature by weakening the bond between the oxygen and the oxide. Thus, we can measure the oxidizing capacity of an oxide by calculating the energy needed to form a vacancy."
          [3] "However, it is important to keep in mind that this is not a measure of catalytic activity, because a second important step is the ability to heal the vacancy formed by the oxidation process by adsorbing and activating oxygen from the gas phase."

[1] "Some (Cu, Fe) are capable of having two different valence states, whereas some (Zn, Mg, Al) have only one. All of them lower substantially the energy of vacancy formation on the two faces."
          [2] "The oxygen atoms that are easier to remove are more reactive, and the lowering of the energy of oxygen-vacancy formation is a good descriptor of the extent to which doping makes the oxide a better oxidant."
          [3] "For example, (2, 3, 5) for several doped oxides, CO reacts more readily with an oxygen atom near the dopant than it would in the absence of the dopant: doping facilitates the Marsvan Krevelen mechanism (6, 7) for oxidation."
          [4] "Dopants having a higher valence than the cation they replace in the oxide (e.g., Zn oxide doped with Ti) tend to adsorb O2 from the gas phase and activate it to make it a better oxidant."
          [5] "The oxygen atoms engaged in the oxidation reaction come from the gas phase not from the surface."
          [6] "Doping facilitates the dissociative adsorption of molecules. This happens either because one of the fragments binds to the dopant and the other to an oxygen atom nearby or because both fragments bind to the surface oxygen atoms activated by the presence of the dopant."
          [7] "The energy of oxygen-vacancy formation can be used as a crude predictor of the ability of the oxygen atoms at the surface of the oxide to engage in chemical reactions."

If a Mars-van Krevelen mechanism is accepted for CO oxidation on Corresponding author.E-mail addresses: boronat@itq.upv.es (M. Boronat), acorma@itq.upv.es (A. Corma). Au/CeO2, then CO2 is formed when CO takes a oxygen atom from the oxide surface creating a oxygen vacancy defect, and therefore the oxidation activity of a catalyst should be inversely related to the oxygen vacancy energy formation.



[1] "It is widely believed that CO directly combines with lattice oxygen atom on ceria, through the Marsvan Krevelen mechanism [7]. However, the relevant reaction dynamics has not been satisfactorily unravelled."
          [2] "If we define the formation energy of an O vacancy as: Evac = E(cellvac) + 1/2E(O2)  E(cell), where the E (cellvac) and E (cell) are total energies of the optimized surfaces with and without an oxygen vacancy, and E (O2) is the total energy of an oxygen molecule in the gas phase, the calculated value of Evac for the undoped CeO2 (111) surface is 2.87 eV per vacancy. By contrast, Evac of the Ce0.75Zr0.25O2 (111) surface is reduced by approximately 20% to 2.35 eV."
          [3] "Zr dopants reduce the energy cost for the formation of oxygen vacancy [4, 29] and thus increase the mobility of lattice oxygen atoms nearby [30]."
          [3] "The presence of Zr dopant promotes the Ce4+  Ce3+ reduction and hence should assist the release of OL, as attested by the reduction of the formation energy of oxygen vacancy."

[1] "The energy of vacancy formation is an indirect measure of the ability of the oxide to work as an oxidant in catalytic oxidation taking place by a Marsvan Krevelen mechanism."
          [2] "If the oxygen is too easy to remove, it is difficult to put it back."
          [3] "In designing an oxidation catalyst, by doping an oxide, one should aim for the middle ground: the dopant should make it easy to remove an oxygen atom, but not too easy."
          [4] "We call this a moderation principle."
          [1] "In the Marsvan Krevelen (MvK) mechanism, the reductant is oxidized by the oxygen atoms from the surface of the oxide (not by adsorbed oxygen). The easier it is to make a vacancy, the better oxidant the surface is."
          [2] "This implies that doping an oxide surface with a LVD makes it a better oxidant."
          [3] "If the oxygen is too easy to remove, it is difficult to put it back."
          [4] "In designing an oxidation catalyst, by doping an oxide, one should aim for the middle ground: the dopant should make it easy to remove an oxygen atom, but not too easy."

The energy (Evf) required for removing one of the oxygen atoms to form a vacancy in the surface layer and half an oxygen molecule in the gas phase.
          On the other hand, CO oxidation by using any one of the four oxygen atoms of the AuxTi1xO2 surface is exothermic; on this surface CO oxidation is thermodynamically favored.
          After adsorption, the oxygen molecule reacts with gas-phase CO to form a carbonate (figure 1e), with a very substantial release of energy (about 4 eV). This complex decomposes to release CO2 and leaves behind an oxygen atom that fills the vacancy. This restores the surface to its initial state, which means that this set of reactions is catalytic.
          The essential elements of the oxidation mechanism proposed here involve the weakening, by the dopant, of the bond between the oxygen atoms in the top surface layer and the oxide, and the reactivity of the oxygen vacancy and of the molecules adsorbed at an oxygen vacancy site.
          The stability of the doped oxide depends on the method of preparation and the composition of the reacting gases.
          A good oxidation catalyst in this class of compounds requires a fine balance between the rate of oxide reduction and oxidation.
          The error is caused by the electron self- interaction in DFT, which favors the delocalization of the electron in the d- or f-bands where the electron should be localized on individual atoms.
          A good catalyst in this class must strike a balance between the ability to donate an oxygen atom during oxidation, and that of taking oxy- gen from the gas phase to heal the oxygen vacancy formed by the oxidation reaction.
          The oxidation takes place by a Mars-van Krevelen mechanism;
          To determine to what extent the oxide becomes a better oxidant when doped with Au, we have calcu- lated the energy (Evf) required for removing one of the oxygen atoms to form a vacancy in the surface layer and half an oxygen molecule in the gas phase.
          Doping weakens dramatically the bond of surface oxygen to the oxide, even when a Ti atom is substituted by Au in the slab sub layer (not shown).
          However, O2 binds more weakly on an bridging-oxygen vacancy on the Au-doped (DeO2  0:68 eV) than on a pure TiO2(110) surface (DeO2  2:80 eV).





If a doped oxide is used as an oxidation catalyst by a Marsvan Krevelen mechanism, then one should seek a dopant that makes it easy to make oxygen vacancies, but not too easy. Informally, we call this a moderation principle. The point is that, if the oxygen is very easy to remove, then it is a very good oxidant, but not a good oxidation catalyst, since it is difficult to put the oxygen back.

[1] "This reaction follows the Mars van Krevelen mechanism, (16) in which CO removes oxygen from the oxide. This oxygen is then replenished in some way, regenerating the catalyst. It is now understood that, in order to enhance the formation of CO2 from CO, the key quantity is the formation energy of an oxygen vacancy in the oxide; by making the oxygen vacancy formation energy more favorable, the oxidation of CO can be enhanced."
          [1] "A large number of chemical reactions have been studied with ceria as the catalyst, key among these being CO oxidation to CO2. (6-15) This reaction follows the Mars van Krevelen mechanism, (16) in which CO removes oxygen from the oxide. This oxygen is then replenished in some way, regenerating the catalyst. It is now understood that, in order to enhance the formation of CO2 from CO, the key quantity is the formation energy of an oxygen vacancy in the oxide; by making the oxygen vacancy formation energy more favorable, the oxidation of CO can be enhanced."

[1] "In such reactions, the gases introduced in the reactor contain a reductant (e.g., an alkane, CO, H2) and an oxidant (e.g., O2, CO2, N2O). In the Marsvan Krevelen mechanism, the reductant is oxidized by the oxygen atoms from the oxides surface layer (not by adsorbed oxygen or by gas-phase oxygen). When the oxidation products desorb, they leave behind oxygen vacancies. The role of the gas-phase oxidant, introduced with the feed, is to annihilate the oxygen vacancies (to reoxidize the surface)."
          [2] "The assumption is that the smaller is ΔEv, the better oxidant is the surface. Once we accept this idea, we can calculate ΔEv for a quick screening of the oxidative power of various oxides (doped or undoped). Moreover, if we want to make an oxide a better oxidant, we should look for modifications that make ΔEv smaller."
          [3] "However, one must keep in mind that a very small ΔEv means that the surface is a good oxidant, but it is not necessarily a good oxidation catalyst. To complete the catalytic cycle, the gaseous oxidant (oxygen, CO2, N2O) must be able to reoxidize the surface. If oxygen is too easy to remove from the surface layer, it will be difficult to put back."

[1] "A large fraction of the output of the chemical industry consists of products obtained by oxidation or oxidative dehydrogenation reactions catalyzed by oxides. 1-6 In most cases, the reaction proceeds through a Marsvan Krevelen mechanism. 7,8 The species to be oxidized reacts with the oxygen atoms at the surface of the oxide, creating oxygen vacancies. The reduced oxide is oxidized by reacting with gas-phase oxygen."
          [2] "We use oxygen vacancy formation energy (OVFE) as a measure of how easily lattice oxygen may participate in the Mars and Van Krevelen mechanism for oxidation reactions."
          [3] "We calculate with density functional theory how OVFE is affected when some of Zn atoms in ZnO(1010) surface layer are substituted by other metal dopants."
          [4] "We find that Li, Na, K, Rb, Cs, Os, Rh, Ir, Ni, Pd, Pt, Cu, Ag, Au, and Cd decrease OVFE and prefer to be located at the surface of ZnO rather than in the bulk."
          [5] "Mg, Ca, Sr, Ba, Sc, Y, La, Ti, Zr, Hf, Ce, V, Nb, Ta, Cr, Mo, W, Mn, Re, Fe, Ru, Co, Al, Ga, Sn, and Pb increase OVFE."
          [6] "Most of the dopants that increase OVFE prefer to substitute Zn atoms in the bulk, except for Ca, Sr, Ba, La, Ce, Re, Fe, Ru, Co, Sn, and Pb, which prefer to substitute a Zn atom at the surface."





"Many oxides catalyze oxidation reactions through the Marsvan Krevelen mechanism in which the oxygen is supplied from the surface of the oxide. 59 The reduced oxide is reoxidized by reacting with the oxygen molecules in the gas. As the oxygen supplied to the molecule being oxidized comes from the surface of the oxide, the energy of formation of an oxygen vacancy (VO) at the surface of the oxide is often a good indicator of the oxidizing power of the oxide."

[1] "The energy of CO reaction with an oxygen atom from the surface layer decays linearly with the energy of vacancy formation ΔEv, whereas the energy of adsorption of O2 at a vacancy is a linear function of ΔEv."
          [2] "These are the only two reactions in the mechanism whose energy varies from one doped oxide to another."
          [3] "Because they both depend on the energy of oxygen vacancy formation, the latter quantity is a good descriptor of catalytic activity."
          [4] "In deciding which intermediate reactions are most likely from an energetic point of view, we impose a spin conservation rule: a reaction that requires flipping a spin is too slow for catalysis."
          [5] "Because of this, we only consider reactions that conserve spin."
          [6] "We find that all the dopants studied here lower the energy of vacancy formation; therefore, the doped oxides are better oxidants than the undoped ones."



[2] "The energy of oxygen-vacancy formation has been measured but the results are at variance due to differences in the method of preparation. It is therefore not possible to compare reliably the values calculated here with experiments. Measurements of the equilibrium between gaseous O2 and ceria have been used to determine the enthalpy of oxygen-vacancy formation, and the re- sults have been reviewed by Mongensen et al. [46]. It was found that when x in CeO2x is 105 the enthalpy of vacancy formation (to generate O2) is 2.6 eV. This is substantially smaller than the value of 3.36 eV obtained by DFT calculations. However, this enthalpy depends strongly on vacancy concentration [46]: for example, it is 4.9 eV when x = 103. However, more recent results have created a great deal of confusion. The energy to form vacan- cies depends on the temperature of calcination: calcining at high temperature leads to a form of ceria that binds oxygen very strongly [47]. It appears that nano-structured ceria releases oxygen more readily than bulk ceria [4851]. A possible, simple explana- tion may be that in systems with very high surface area one detects the formation of surface oxygen vacancies; their formation re- quires lower energy than forming bulk vacancies. Some measure- ments have correlated the uptake or release of oxygen with the area [48]. Nano-rods of ceria displaying the (0 0 1) and (1 1 0) faces are more active in oxidizing CO than nano-particles of ceria [52] which suggests a dependence of the energy to form oxygen vacan- cies on the crystal face, which is supported by computations [53]."
          [3] "The state having the lowest energy, for the doped slab, has zero spin polarization. Replacing a Ce atom in the surface layer with a Pt atom causes a change in the atomic positions in the top layer: the oxygen atoms neighboring the Pt dopant are closer to it than they were to the Ce atom that has been substituted: the PtO distance is 2.12 Å while the CeO distance in the pure ceria is 2.33 Å. The 2.12 Å PtO distance in doped ceria is longer than the PtO distance in PtO2 (the measured PtO distance is 1.99 Å and the calculated one is 2.00 Å). As the oxygen atoms get closer to the Pt dopant, their distance to the Ce atoms increases from 2.33 Å to 2.43 Å. This increase in the CeO distance suggests that the strength of this bond is diminished. Furthermore, an increased PtO bond, when compared to that of PtO2, suggests that the PtO bond in doped ceria is not as strong as the PtO bond in PtO2."
          [4] "The weakening of the bond between the oxygen atoms neigh- boring the Pt atom is reflected in the change in the energy required for making an oxygen vacancy. To remove an O atom from the top layer of the pure oxide, to form a O2 molecule in the gas phase,costs 3.00 eV. The lowest energy state of a pure ceria slab with an oxygen vacancy in it has Ns = 2 (two unpaired spins). The forma- tion energy for pure ceria is consistent with that calculated by Ganduglia-Pirovano et al. [41]. For the Pt-doped ceria, the forma- tion of an oxygen vacancy, in the top layer, near the dopant, costs 2.15 eV. The lowest energy state of the slab with a vacancy in it has Ns = 0."
          [5] "The removal of an oxygen atom, to form a vacancy, leaves be- hind the two electrons that had formed the oxygenmetal bond. Previous calculations, using DFT + U, have shown that these elec- trons are localized on the f-orbitals of two Ce atoms, converting Ce4+ ions to Ce3+. However, one should keep in mind that these for- mal charges are merely a metaphor: a more appropriate statement would be that the formation of a vacancy reduces the positive charge on the Ce atoms. This behavior is different from that ob- tained with DFTGGA, which does not show the formal reduction of Ce4+ to Ce3+. The experiments suggest that this reduction is pres- ent and this is one of the reasons for the current preference for DFT + U. To test the degree of reduction, we calculated the Bader charges [41,43,44] before and after vacancy formation. The results,for pure ceria, are shown in Fig. 7a and b. The cerium atom in the surface layer of pure ceria has a positive charge of 2.33 (i.e. when forming the oxide the Ce atom donates 2.33 electrons) and the charge on the oxygen atoms (in both the top and the second layer) is 1.18 (when forming the oxide an oxygen atom gains 1.18 elec- trons). When the vacancy is formed, the triangular symmetry of the Ce atoms closest to the surface is broken: the charge on two of the Ce atoms surrounding the vacancy changes from 2.33 to 2.11. The charge on the third Ce atom neighboring the vacancy is unchanged. The formation of the vacancy hardly changes the charge on the oxygen atoms (see Fig. 7b). It is debatable whether the small decrease in the positive charge on two of the Ce atoms,when the vacancy is formed, entitles us to say that Ce4+ is reduced to Ce3+. The experimental evidence for the reduction of Ce upon the formation of an oxygen vacancy is based on the XPS spectra. When the oxide is reduced, a shoulder develops in the XPS spectrum at energies where the XPS spectrum of Ce in Ce2O3 is located. Unfor- tunately, the position of the XPS peaks depends on the electronic structure of the initial and final state, not only on the charge of the atom. Therefore, we do not consider the XPS spectra as provid- ing conclusive evidence for Ce reduction. Theory is not helpful either since the electronic structure is affected by the value of U,and there is no compelling reason to adopt a specific U value."
          [6] "The effect of doping on the atomic charges is shown in Fig. 7c. Replacing a Ce atom with a Pt atom reduces the charge on the adja- cent oxygen atoms in the top layer from 1.18 to 1.03. Pt has a much lower positive charge than the Ce atom it replaced (1.35 in- stead of 2.33). The main effect of vacancy creation is the reduction of Pt (its charge changes from 1.36 to 0.83). This is accompanied by a small reduction of the positive charge on cerium and a slight in- crease of the negative charge on oxygen. The presence of a reduc- ible dopant in a reducible oxide introduces a new element controlling the fate of the electrons left behind when O is removed:they can reduce the cations of the host or the dopant and in the present case the dopant is reduced. Either effect contributes to lowering the energy of vacancy formation."
          [7] "Because of these difficulties in validating the calculated the en- ergy of vacancy formation, we do not place much emphasis on the absolute values of the numbers but assume that the qualitative conclusion that the presence of Pt lowers substantially the energy required for making an oxygen vacancy is correct."
          [8] "As shown in previous work [40,53,57,58], dopants that lower the energy of oxygen-vacancy formation make the oxide a more reactive (than the undoped oxide). This suggests that, in the case of methane activation, the oxygen atoms whose bond to the sur- face is weakened by the presence of Pt will form stronger bonds with the CH3 radical and the hydrogen atom formed by breaking the CH bond. An alternative is that some of the dissociation frag- ments may bind to the Pt dopant. The BronstedEvansPolanyi rule [1322] further suggests that a stronger binding of the prod- ucts will result in a lowering of the activation energy for bond breaking. Theory can test these inferences."
          [9] "Our DFT calculations show that methane dissociates to form a CH3 radical and an H atom, and these two fragments bind to two of the oxygen atoms weakened by the presence of the dopant."
          [10] "The reaction path for this process, obtained with the nudged elastic band (NEB) method [59,60], is shown in Fig. 8. The key energies are given on the potential energy diagrams in Fig. 9. The geometries of these key states are shown in Fig. 10 (on pure ceria) and Fig. 11 (on doped ceria)."
          [11] "Different points on the graph shown in Fig. 8 correspond to dif- ferent geometries along the reaction path. The NEB method opti- mizes these points so that the line joining them passes through the transition state. The shape of the rubber band for the disso- ciative adsorption of methane on Pt-doped ceria is very unusual. The geometry 1 corresponds to physisorbed methane. The binding energy is 0.16 eV, on doped ceria, and 0.21 eV on pure ceria (see Fig. 9). DFT does not include van der Waals interactions and there- fore, the measured binding energy should be larger than these val- ues. The structure of the physisorbed methane on pure ceria is shown in Fig. 10a. A hydrogen atom in methane coordinates to an oxygen atom in the top layer. The position of methane on the Pt-doped ceria is fairly similar. There is no indication that Pt forms a bond with CH4."
          [12] "The geometries 57 along the NEB (see Fig. 8) correspond to a rapid rise of the energy caused by the breaking of the CH bond. Point 7 corresponds to the transition state, whose energy is 1.29 eV on pure ceria, and 1.08 eV on Pt-doped ceria (Fig. 9). The important qualitative result is that doping lowers the activation energy for the breaking of the CH bond. This is the rate-limiting step in all methane activation processes. The geometry of the tran- sition state, for pure ceria, is shown in Fig. 10d. An oxygenH bond of 1.22 Å is formed with one of the oxygen atoms in the top layer;the CH bond is stretched but not broken (its length is 1.41 Å). The geometry of the transition state on the Pt-doped surface is shown in Fig. 11d. This is very similar to the one seen for pure ceria, except that the activation energy is lower. The Pt dopant does not form bonds with the methane or any of the fragments (H or CH3) created by dissociation. The role of Pt is to activate the oxygen atoms next to it."
          [13] "The points 822 correspond to metastable states in which the CH3 group swings around to move close to an oxygen atom on the surface. This large-scale motion does not involve bond stretch- ing or breaking, and this is why the energy does not change much even though the geometry does. The energy of the metastable states is lower than the TS energy, and it is 1.08 eV on pure ceria and 0.90 eV on doped ceria. One of the metastable geometries is shown in Fig. 10c, for pure ceria, and Fig. 11c, for doped ceria."
          [14] "The rapid decrease in energy, as the geometry changes from the points 21 to 25 (Fig. 8), corresponds to the formation of the bond between the C atom in CH3 and an oxygen atom in the surface. The energy of the dissociated state is 1.31 eV for pure ceria and 2.11 eV on doped ceria (see Fig. 9). The geometries of the dissoci- ated states are shown in Fig. 10b (for pure ceria) and Fig. 11b (for doped ceria). Both fragments are binding to oxygen atoms in the surface layers. In the case of the Pt-doped surface, the methyl rad- ical is slightly rotated (when compared to its position on pure cer- ia) so that one H atom gets closer to the Pt atom."
          [15] "The Bader charges on the atoms in the transition state and the final, dissociated state on pure ceria are shown in Fig. 12a and b. The most conspicuous feature is the large change on the charge on the carbon from 0.44 in the transition state to 0.24 in the methoxide formed when CH3 binds to the surface. The charge of the hydrogen atom forming the hydroxyl changes from 0.39 in the transition state to 0.63 in the final (dissociated) state. This is accompanied by a substantial change in the charge of the oxygen atom forming the hydroxyl from 1.17 to 1.34. The electron charge lost by the carbon atom, when going from the transition state to the final state, is donated to the Ce and the O atoms, each of them taking a small amount of electron charge. A similar behav- ior is observed for Pt-doped ceria. It is remarkable that in spite of the large charge transfer occurring on the carbon and the H and O atoms forming the hydroxyl, there is no charge change on the Pt atom."

[1] "An essential step in the Marsvan Krevelen oxidation mechanism is the reaction of a surface oxygen atom with a gas-phase reducing agent, to form an oxidation product and an oxygen vacancy on the surface. The high energy required for forming an oxygen vacancy is one reason why oxides perform oxidation reactions at high temperature."
          [2] "We expect that the dopant lowers the oxidation temperature by weakening the bond between the oxygen and the oxide. Thus, we can measure the oxidizing capacity of an oxide by calculating the energy needed to form a vacancy."
          [3] "However, it is important to keep in mind that this is not a measure of catalytic activity, because a second important step is the ability to heal the vacancy formed by the oxidation process by adsorbing and activating oxygen from the gas phase."

[1] "Some (Cu, Fe) are capable of having two different valence states, whereas some (Zn, Mg, Al) have only one. All of them lower substantially the energy of vacancy formation on the two faces."
          [2] "The oxygen atoms that are easier to remove are more reactive, and the lowering of the energy of oxygen-vacancy formation is a good descriptor of the extent to which doping makes the oxide a better oxidant."
          [3] "For example, (2, 3, 5) for several doped oxides, CO reacts more readily with an oxygen atom near the dopant than it would in the absence of the dopant: doping facilitates the Marsvan Krevelen mechanism (6, 7) for oxidation."
          [4] "Dopants having a higher valence than the cation they replace in the oxide (e.g., Zn oxide doped with Ti) tend to adsorb O2 from the gas phase and activate it to make it a better oxidant."
          [5] "The oxygen atoms engaged in the oxidation reaction come from the gas phase not from the surface."
          [6] "Doping facilitates the dissociative adsorption of molecules. This happens either because one of the fragments binds to the dopant and the other to an oxygen atom nearby or because both fragments bind to the surface oxygen atoms activated by the presence of the dopant."
          [7] "The energy of oxygen-vacancy formation can be used as a crude predictor of the ability of the oxygen atoms at the surface of the oxide to engage in chemical reactions."

If a Mars-van Krevelen mechanism is accepted for CO oxidation on Corresponding author.E-mail addresses: boronat@itq.upv.es (M. Boronat), acorma@itq.upv.es (A. Corma). Au/CeO2, then CO2 is formed when CO takes a oxygen atom from the oxide surface creating a oxygen vacancy defect, and therefore the oxidation activity of a catalyst should be inversely related to the oxygen vacancy energy formation.



[1] "It is widely believed that CO directly combines with lattice oxygen atom on ceria, through the Marsvan Krevelen mechanism [7]. However, the relevant reaction dynamics has not been satisfactorily unravelled."
          [2] "If we define the formation energy of an O vacancy as: Evac = E(cellvac) + 1/2E(O2)  E(cell), where the E (cellvac) and E (cell) are total energies of the optimized surfaces with and without an oxygen vacancy, and E (O2) is the total energy of an oxygen molecule in the gas phase, the calculated value of Evac for the undoped CeO2 (111) surface is 2.87 eV per vacancy. By contrast, Evac of the Ce0.75Zr0.25O2 (111) surface is reduced by approximately 20% to 2.35 eV."
          [3] "Zr dopants reduce the energy cost for the formation of oxygen vacancy [4, 29] and thus increase the mobility of lattice oxygen atoms nearby [30]."
          [3] "The presence of Zr dopant promotes the Ce4+  Ce3+ reduction and hence should assist the release of OL, as attested by the reduction of the formation energy of oxygen vacancy."

[1] "The energy of vacancy formation is an indirect measure of the ability of the oxide to work as an oxidant in catalytic oxidation taking place by a Marsvan Krevelen mechanism."
          [2] "If the oxygen is too easy to remove, it is difficult to put it back."
          [3] "In designing an oxidation catalyst, by doping an oxide, one should aim for the middle ground: the dopant should make it easy to remove an oxygen atom, but not too easy."
          [4] "We call this a moderation principle."
          [1] "In the Marsvan Krevelen (MvK) mechanism, the reductant is oxidized by the oxygen atoms from the surface of the oxide (not by adsorbed oxygen). The easier it is to make a vacancy, the better oxidant the surface is."
          [2] "This implies that doping an oxide surface with a LVD makes it a better oxidant."
          [3] "If the oxygen is too easy to remove, it is difficult to put it back."
          [4] "In designing an oxidation catalyst, by doping an oxide, one should aim for the middle ground: the dopant should make it easy to remove an oxygen atom, but not too easy."

The energy (Evf) required for removing one of the oxygen atoms to form a vacancy in the surface layer and half an oxygen molecule in the gas phase.
          On the other hand, CO oxidation by using any one of the four oxygen atoms of the AuxTi1xO2 surface is exothermic; on this surface CO oxidation is thermodynamically favored.
          After adsorption, the oxygen molecule reacts with gas-phase CO to form a carbonate (figure 1e), with a very substantial release of energy (about 4 eV). This complex decomposes to release CO2 and leaves behind an oxygen atom that fills the vacancy. This restores the surface to its initial state, which means that this set of reactions is catalytic.
          The essential elements of the oxidation mechanism proposed here involve the weakening, by the dopant, of the bond between the oxygen atoms in the top surface layer and the oxide, and the reactivity of the oxygen vacancy and of the molecules adsorbed at an oxygen vacancy site.
          The stability of the doped oxide depends on the method of preparation and the composition of the reacting gases.
          A good oxidation catalyst in this class of compounds requires a fine balance between the rate of oxide reduction and oxidation.
          The error is caused by the electron self- interaction in DFT, which favors the delocalization of the electron in the d- or f-bands where the electron should be localized on individual atoms.
          A good catalyst in this class must strike a balance between the ability to donate an oxygen atom during oxidation, and that of taking oxy- gen from the gas phase to heal the oxygen vacancy formed by the oxidation reaction.
          The oxidation takes place by a Mars-van Krevelen mechanism;
          To determine to what extent the oxide becomes a better oxidant when doped with Au, we have calcu- lated the energy (Evf) required for removing one of the oxygen atoms to form a vacancy in the surface layer and half an oxygen molecule in the gas phase.
          Doping weakens dramatically the bond of surface oxygen to the oxide, even when a Ti atom is substituted by Au in the slab sub layer (not shown).
          However, O2 binds more weakly on an bridging-oxygen vacancy on the Au-doped (DeO2  0:68 eV) than on a pure TiO2(110) surface (DeO2  2:80 eV).





If a doped oxide is used as an oxidation catalyst by a Marsvan Krevelen mechanism, then one should seek a dopant that makes it easy to make oxygen vacancies, but not too easy. Informally, we call this a moderation principle. The point is that, if the oxygen is very easy to remove, then it is a very good oxidant, but not a good oxidation catalyst, since it is difficult to put the oxygen back.

[1] "This reaction follows the Mars van Krevelen mechanism, (16) in which CO removes oxygen from the oxide. This oxygen is then replenished in some way, regenerating the catalyst. It is now understood that, in order to enhance the formation of CO2 from CO, the key quantity is the formation energy of an oxygen vacancy in the oxide; by making the oxygen vacancy formation energy more favorable, the oxidation of CO can be enhanced."
          [1] "A large number of chemical reactions have been studied with ceria as the catalyst, key among these being CO oxidation to CO2. (6-15) This reaction follows the Mars van Krevelen mechanism, (16) in which CO removes oxygen from the oxide. This oxygen is then replenished in some way, regenerating the catalyst. It is now understood that, in order to enhance the formation of CO2 from CO, the key quantity is the formation energy of an oxygen vacancy in the oxide; by making the oxygen vacancy formation energy more favorable, the oxidation of CO can be enhanced."

[1] "In such reactions, the gases introduced in the reactor contain a reductant (e.g., an alkane, CO, H2) and an oxidant (e.g., O2, CO2, N2O). In the Marsvan Krevelen mechanism, the reductant is oxidized by the oxygen atoms from the oxides surface layer (not by adsorbed oxygen or by gas-phase oxygen). When the oxidation products desorb, they leave behind oxygen vacancies. The role of the gas-phase oxidant, introduced with the feed, is to annihilate the oxygen vacancies (to reoxidize the surface)."
          [2] "The assumption is that the smaller is ΔEv, the better oxidant is the surface. Once we accept this idea, we can calculate ΔEv for a quick screening of the oxidative power of various oxides (doped or undoped). Moreover, if we want to make an oxide a better oxidant, we should look for modifications that make ΔEv smaller."
          [3] "However, one must keep in mind that a very small ΔEv means that the surface is a good oxidant, but it is not necessarily a good oxidation catalyst. To complete the catalytic cycle, the gaseous oxidant (oxygen, CO2, N2O) must be able to reoxidize the surface. If oxygen is too easy to remove from the surface layer, it will be difficult to put back."

[1] "A large fraction of the output of the chemical industry consists of products obtained by oxidation or oxidative dehydrogenation reactions catalyzed by oxides. 1-6 In most cases, the reaction proceeds through a Marsvan Krevelen mechanism. 7,8 The species to be oxidized reacts with the oxygen atoms at the surface of the oxide, creating oxygen vacancies. The reduced oxide is oxidized by reacting with gas-phase oxygen."
          [2] "We use oxygen vacancy formation energy (OVFE) as a measure of how easily lattice oxygen may participate in the Mars and Van Krevelen mechanism for oxidation reactions."
          [3] "We calculate with density functional theory how OVFE is affected when some of Zn atoms in ZnO(1010) surface layer are substituted by other metal dopants."
          [4] "We find that Li, Na, K, Rb, Cs, Os, Rh, Ir, Ni, Pd, Pt, Cu, Ag, Au, and Cd decrease OVFE and prefer to be located at the surface of ZnO rather than in the bulk."
          [5] "Mg, Ca, Sr, Ba, Sc, Y, La, Ti, Zr, Hf, Ce, V, Nb, Ta, Cr, Mo, W, Mn, Re, Fe, Ru, Co, Al, Ga, Sn, and Pb increase OVFE."
          [6] "Most of the dopants that increase OVFE prefer to substitute Zn atoms in the bulk, except for Ca, Sr, Ba, La, Ce, Re, Fe, Ru, Co, Sn, and Pb, which prefer to substitute a Zn atom at the surface."





"Many oxides catalyze oxidation reactions through the Marsvan Krevelen mechanism in which the oxygen is supplied from the surface of the oxide. 59 The reduced oxide is reoxidized by reacting with the oxygen molecules in the gas. As the oxygen supplied to the molecule being oxidized comes from the surface of the oxide, the energy of formation of an oxygen vacancy (VO) at the surface of the oxide is often a good indicator of the oxidizing power of the oxide."

[1] "The energy of CO reaction with an oxygen atom from the surface layer decays linearly with the energy of vacancy formation ΔEv, whereas the energy of adsorption of O2 at a vacancy is a linear function of ΔEv."
          [2] "These are the only two reactions in the mechanism whose energy varies from one doped oxide to another."
          [3] "Because they both depend on the energy of oxygen vacancy formation, the latter quantity is a good descriptor of catalytic activity."
          [4] "In deciding which intermediate reactions are most likely from an energetic point of view, we impose a spin conservation rule: a reaction that requires flipping a spin is too slow for catalysis."
          [5] "Because of this, we only consider reactions that conserve spin."
          [6] "We find that all the dopants studied here lower the energy of vacancy formation; therefore, the doped oxides are better oxidants than the undoped ones."



[2] "The energy of oxygen-vacancy formation has been measured but the results are at variance due to differences in the method of preparation. It is therefore not possible to compare reliably the values calculated here with experiments. Measurements of the equilibrium between gaseous O2 and ceria have been used to determine the enthalpy of oxygen-vacancy formation, and the re- sults have been reviewed by Mongensen et al. [46]. It was found that when x in CeO2x is 105 the enthalpy of vacancy formation (to generate O2) is 2.6 eV. This is substantially smaller than the value of 3.36 eV obtained by DFT calculations. However, this enthalpy depends strongly on vacancy concentration [46]: for example, it is 4.9 eV when x = 103. However, more recent results have created a great deal of confusion. The energy to form vacan- cies depends on the temperature of calcination: calcining at high temperature leads to a form of ceria that binds oxygen very strongly [47]. It appears that nano-structured ceria releases oxygen more readily than bulk ceria [4851]. A possible, simple explana- tion may be that in systems with very high surface area one detects the formation of surface oxygen vacancies; their formation re- quires lower energy than forming bulk vacancies. Some measure- ments have correlated the uptake or release of oxygen with the area [48]. Nano-rods of ceria displaying the (0 0 1) and (1 1 0) faces are more active in oxidizing CO than nano-particles of ceria [52] which suggests a dependence of the energy to form oxygen vacan- cies on the crystal face, which is supported by computations [53]."
          [3] "The state having the lowest energy, for the doped slab, has zero spin polarization. Replacing a Ce atom in the surface layer with a Pt atom causes a change in the atomic positions in the top layer: the oxygen atoms neighboring the Pt dopant are closer to it than they were to the Ce atom that has been substituted: the PtO distance is 2.12 Å while the CeO distance in the pure ceria is 2.33 Å. The 2.12 Å PtO distance in doped ceria is longer than the PtO distance in PtO2 (the measured PtO distance is 1.99 Å and the calculated one is 2.00 Å). As the oxygen atoms get closer to the Pt dopant, their distance to the Ce atoms increases from 2.33 Å to 2.43 Å. This increase in the CeO distance suggests that the strength of this bond is diminished. Furthermore, an increased PtO bond, when compared to that of PtO2, suggests that the PtO bond in doped ceria is not as strong as the PtO bond in PtO2."
          [4] "The weakening of the bond between the oxygen atoms neigh- boring the Pt atom is reflected in the change in the energy required for making an oxygen vacancy. To remove an O atom from the top layer of the pure oxide, to form a O2 molecule in the gas phase,costs 3.00 eV. The lowest energy state of a pure ceria slab with an oxygen vacancy in it has Ns = 2 (two unpaired spins). The forma- tion energy for pure ceria is consistent with that calculated by Ganduglia-Pirovano et al. [41]. For the Pt-doped ceria, the forma- tion of an oxygen vacancy, in the top layer, near the dopant, costs 2.15 eV. The lowest energy state of the slab with a vacancy in it has Ns = 0."
          [5] "The removal of an oxygen atom, to form a vacancy, leaves be- hind the two electrons that had formed the oxygenmetal bond. Previous calculations, using DFT + U, have shown that these elec- trons are localized on the f-orbitals of two Ce atoms, converting Ce4+ ions to Ce3+. However, one should keep in mind that these for- mal charges are merely a metaphor: a more appropriate statement would be that the formation of a vacancy reduces the positive charge on the Ce atoms. This behavior is different from that ob- tained with DFTGGA, which does not show the formal reduction of Ce4+ to Ce3+. The experiments suggest that this reduction is pres- ent and this is one of the reasons for the current preference for DFT + U. To test the degree of reduction, we calculated the Bader charges [41,43,44] before and after vacancy formation. The results,for pure ceria, are shown in Fig. 7a and b. The cerium atom in the surface layer of pure ceria has a positive charge of 2.33 (i.e. when forming the oxide the Ce atom donates 2.33 electrons) and the charge on the oxygen atoms (in both the top and the second layer) is 1.18 (when forming the oxide an oxygen atom gains 1.18 elec- trons). When the vacancy is formed, the triangular symmetry of the Ce atoms closest to the surface is broken: the charge on two of the Ce atoms surrounding the vacancy changes from 2.33 to 2.11. The charge on the third Ce atom neighboring the vacancy is unchanged. The formation of the vacancy hardly changes the charge on the oxygen atoms (see Fig. 7b). It is debatable whether the small decrease in the positive charge on two of the Ce atoms,when the vacancy is formed, entitles us to say that Ce4+ is reduced to Ce3+. The experimental evidence for the reduction of Ce upon the formation of an oxygen vacancy is based on the XPS spectra. When the oxide is reduced, a shoulder develops in the XPS spectrum at energies where the XPS spectrum of Ce in Ce2O3 is located. Unfor- tunately, the position of the XPS peaks depends on the electronic structure of the initial and final state, not only on the charge of the atom. Therefore, we do not consider the XPS spectra as provid- ing conclusive evidence for Ce reduction. Theory is not helpful either since the electronic structure is affected by the value of U,and there is no compelling reason to adopt a specific U value."
          [6] "The effect of doping on the atomic charges is shown in Fig. 7c. Replacing a Ce atom with a Pt atom reduces the charge on the adja- cent oxygen atoms in the top layer from 1.18 to 1.03. Pt has a much lower positive charge than the Ce atom it replaced (1.35 in- stead of 2.33). The main effect of vacancy creation is the reduction of Pt (its charge changes from 1.36 to 0.83). This is accompanied by a small reduction of the positive charge on cerium and a slight in- crease of the negative charge on oxygen. The presence of a reduc- ible dopant in a reducible oxide introduces a new element controlling the fate of the electrons left behind when O is removed:they can reduce the cations of the host or the dopant and in the present case the dopant is reduced. Either effect contributes to lowering the energy of vacancy formation."
          [7] "Because of these difficulties in validating the calculated the en- ergy of vacancy formation, we do not place much emphasis on the absolute values of the numbers but assume that the qualitative conclusion that the presence of Pt lowers substantially the energy required for making an oxygen vacancy is correct."
          [8] "As shown in previous work [40,53,57,58], dopants that lower the energy of oxygen-vacancy formation make the oxide a more reactive (than the undoped oxide). This suggests that, in the case of methane activation, the oxygen atoms whose bond to the sur- face is weakened by the presence of Pt will form stronger bonds with the CH3 radical and the hydrogen atom formed by breaking the CH bond. An alternative is that some of the dissociation frag- ments may bind to the Pt dopant. The BronstedEvansPolanyi rule [1322] further suggests that a stronger binding of the prod- ucts will result in a lowering of the activation energy for bond breaking. Theory can test these inferences."
          [9] "Our DFT calculations show that methane dissociates to form a CH3 radical and an H atom, and these two fragments bind to two of the oxygen atoms weakened by the presence of the dopant."
          [10] "The reaction path for this process, obtained with the nudged elastic band (NEB) method [59,60], is shown in Fig. 8. The key energies are given on the potential energy diagrams in Fig. 9. The geometries of these key states are shown in Fig. 10 (on pure ceria) and Fig. 11 (on doped ceria)."
          [11] "Different points on the graph shown in Fig. 8 correspond to dif- ferent geometries along the reaction path. The NEB method opti- mizes these points so that the line joining them passes through the transition state. The shape of the rubber band for the disso- ciative adsorption of methane on Pt-doped ceria is very unusual. The geometry 1 corresponds to physisorbed methane. The binding energy is 0.16 eV, on doped ceria, and 0.21 eV on pure ceria (see Fig. 9). DFT does not include van der Waals interactions and there- fore, the measured binding energy should be larger than these val- ues. The structure of the physisorbed methane on pure ceria is shown in Fig. 10a. A hydrogen atom in methane coordinates to an oxygen atom in the top layer. The position of methane on the Pt-doped ceria is fairly similar. There is no indication that Pt forms a bond with CH4."
          [12] "The geometries 57 along the NEB (see Fig. 8) correspond to a rapid rise of the energy caused by the breaking of the CH bond. Point 7 corresponds to the transition state, whose energy is 1.29 eV on pure ceria, and 1.08 eV on Pt-doped ceria (Fig. 9). The important qualitative result is that doping lowers the activation energy for the breaking of the CH bond. This is the rate-limiting step in all methane activation processes. The geometry of the tran- sition state, for pure ceria, is shown in Fig. 10d. An oxygenH bond of 1.22 Å is formed with one of the oxygen atoms in the top layer;the CH bond is stretched but not broken (its length is 1.41 Å). The geometry of the transition state on the Pt-doped surface is shown in Fig. 11d. This is very similar to the one seen for pure ceria, except that the activation energy is lower. The Pt dopant does not form bonds with the methane or any of the fragments (H or CH3) created by dissociation. The role of Pt is to activate the oxygen atoms next to it."
          [13] "The points 822 correspond to metastable states in which the CH3 group swings around to move close to an oxygen atom on the surface. This large-scale motion does not involve bond stretch- ing or breaking, and this is why the energy does not change much even though the geometry does. The energy of the metastable states is lower than the TS energy, and it is 1.08 eV on pure ceria and 0.90 eV on doped ceria. One of the metastable geometries is shown in Fig. 10c, for pure ceria, and Fig. 11c, for doped ceria."
          [14] "The rapid decrease in energy, as the geometry changes from the points 21 to 25 (Fig. 8), corresponds to the formation of the bond between the C atom in CH3 and an oxygen atom in the surface. The energy of the dissociated state is 1.31 eV for pure ceria and 2.11 eV on doped ceria (see Fig. 9). The geometries of the dissoci- ated states are shown in Fig. 10b (for pure ceria) and Fig. 11b (for doped ceria). Both fragments are binding to oxygen atoms in the surface layers. In the case of the Pt-doped surface, the methyl rad- ical is slightly rotated (when compared to its position on pure cer- ia) so that one H atom gets closer to the Pt atom."
          [15] "The Bader charges on the atoms in the transition state and the final, dissociated state on pure ceria are shown in Fig. 12a and b. The most conspicuous feature is the large change on the charge on the carbon from 0.44 in the transition state to 0.24 in the methoxide formed when CH3 binds to the surface. The charge of the hydrogen atom forming the hydroxyl changes from 0.39 in the transition state to 0.63 in the final (dissociated) state. This is accompanied by a substantial change in the charge of the oxygen atom forming the hydroxyl from 1.17 to 1.34. The electron charge lost by the carbon atom, when going from the transition state to the final state, is donated to the Ce and the O atoms, each of them taking a small amount of electron charge. A similar behav- ior is observed for Pt-doped ceria. It is remarkable that in spite of the large charge transfer occurring on the carbon and the H and O atoms forming the hydroxyl, there is no charge change on the Pt atom."

[1] "An essential step in the Marsvan Krevelen oxidation mechanism is the reaction of a surface oxygen atom with a gas-phase reducing agent, to form an oxidation product and an oxygen vacancy on the surface. The high energy required for forming an oxygen vacancy is one reason why oxides perform oxidation reactions at high temperature."
          [2] "We expect that the dopant lowers the oxidation temperature by weakening the bond between the oxygen and the oxide. Thus, we can measure the oxidizing capacity of an oxide by calculating the energy needed to form a vacancy."
          [3] "However, it is important to keep in mind that this is not a measure of catalytic activity, because a second important step is the ability to heal the vacancy formed by the oxidation process by adsorbing and activating oxygen from the gas phase."

[1] "Some (Cu, Fe) are capable of having two different valence states, whereas some (Zn, Mg, Al) have only one. All of them lower substantially the energy of vacancy formation on the two faces."
          [2] "The oxygen atoms that are easier to remove are more reactive, and the lowering of the energy of oxygen-vacancy formation is a good descriptor of the extent to which doping makes the oxide a better oxidant."
          [3] "For example, (2, 3, 5) for several doped oxides, CO reacts more readily with an oxygen atom near the dopant than it would in the absence of the dopant: doping facilitates the Marsvan Krevelen mechanism (6, 7) for oxidation."
          [4] "Dopants having a higher valence than the cation they replace in the oxide (e.g., Zn oxide doped with Ti) tend to adsorb O2 from the gas phase and activate it to make it a better oxidant."
          [5] "The oxygen atoms engaged in the oxidation reaction come from the gas phase not from the surface."
          [6] "Doping facilitates the dissociative adsorption of molecules. This happens either because one of the fragments binds to the dopant and the other to an oxygen atom nearby or because both fragments bind to the surface oxygen atoms activated by the presence of the dopant."
          [7] "The energy of oxygen-vacancy formation can be used as a crude predictor of the ability of the oxygen atoms at the surface of the oxide to engage in chemical reactions."

If a Mars-van Krevelen mechanism is accepted for CO oxidation on Corresponding author.E-mail addresses: boronat@itq.upv.es (M. Boronat), acorma@itq.upv.es (A. Corma). Au/CeO2, then CO2 is formed when CO takes a oxygen atom from the oxide surface creating a oxygen vacancy defect, and therefore the oxidation activity of a catalyst should be inversely related to the oxygen vacancy energy formation.



[1] "It is widely believed that CO directly combines with lattice oxygen atom on ceria, through the Marsvan Krevelen mechanism [7]. However, the relevant reaction dynamics has not been satisfactorily unravelled."
          [2] "If we define the formation energy of an O vacancy as: Evac = E(cellvac) + 1/2E(O2)  E(cell), where the E (cellvac) and E (cell) are total energies of the optimized surfaces with and without an oxygen vacancy, and E (O2) is the total energy of an oxygen molecule in the gas phase, the calculated value of Evac for the undoped CeO2 (111) surface is 2.87 eV per vacancy. By contrast, Evac of the Ce0.75Zr0.25O2 (111) surface is reduced by approximately 20% to 2.35 eV."
          [3] "Zr dopants reduce the energy cost for the formation of oxygen vacancy [4, 29] and thus increase the mobility of lattice oxygen atoms nearby [30]."
          [3] "The presence of Zr dopant promotes the Ce4+  Ce3+ reduction and hence should assist the release of OL, as attested by the reduction of the formation energy of oxygen vacancy."

[1] "The energy of vacancy formation is an indirect measure of the ability of the oxide to work as an oxidant in catalytic oxidation taking place by a Marsvan Krevelen mechanism."
          [2] "If the oxygen is too easy to remove, it is difficult to put it back."
          [3] "In designing an oxidation catalyst, by doping an oxide, one should aim for the middle ground: the dopant should make it easy to remove an oxygen atom, but not too easy."
          [4] "We call this a moderation principle."
          [1] "In the Marsvan Krevelen (MvK) mechanism, the reductant is oxidized by the oxygen atoms from the surface of the oxide (not by adsorbed oxygen). The easier it is to make a vacancy, the better oxidant the surface is."
          [2] "This implies that doping an oxide surface with a LVD makes it a better oxidant."
          [3] "If the oxygen is too easy to remove, it is difficult to put it back."
          [4] "In designing an oxidation catalyst, by doping an oxide, one should aim for the middle ground: the dopant should make it easy to remove an oxygen atom, but not too easy."

The energy (Evf) required for removing one of the oxygen atoms to form a vacancy in the surface layer and half an oxygen molecule in the gas phase.
          On the other hand, CO oxidation by using any one of the four oxygen atoms of the AuxTi1xO2 surface is exothermic; on this surface CO oxidation is thermodynamically favored.
          After adsorption, the oxygen molecule reacts with gas-phase CO to form a carbonate (figure 1e), with a very substantial release of energy (about 4 eV). This complex decomposes to release CO2 and leaves behind an oxygen atom that fills the vacancy. This restores the surface to its initial state, which means that this set of reactions is catalytic.
          The essential elements of the oxidation mechanism proposed here involve the weakening, by the dopant, of the bond between the oxygen atoms in the top surface layer and the oxide, and the reactivity of the oxygen vacancy and of the molecules adsorbed at an oxygen vacancy site.
          The stability of the doped oxide depends on the method of preparation and the composition of the reacting gases.
          A good oxidation catalyst in this class of compounds requires a fine balance between the rate of oxide reduction and oxidation.
          The error is caused by the electron self- interaction in DFT, which favors the delocalization of the electron in the d- or f-bands where the electron should be localized on individual atoms.
          A good catalyst in this class must strike a balance between the ability to donate an oxygen atom during oxidation, and that of taking oxy- gen from the gas phase to heal the oxygen vacancy formed by the oxidation reaction.
          The oxidation takes place by a Mars-van Krevelen mechanism;
          To determine to what extent the oxide becomes a better oxidant when doped with Au, we have calcu- lated the energy (Evf) required for removing one of the oxygen atoms to form a vacancy in the surface layer and half an oxygen molecule in the gas phase.
          Doping weakens dramatically the bond of surface oxygen to the oxide, even when a Ti atom is substituted by Au in the slab sub layer (not shown).
          However, O2 binds more weakly on an bridging-oxygen vacancy on the Au-doped (DeO2  0:68 eV) than on a pure TiO2(110) surface (DeO2  2:80 eV).





If a doped oxide is used as an oxidation catalyst by a Marsvan Krevelen mechanism, then one should seek a dopant that makes it easy to make oxygen vacancies, but not too easy. Informally, we call this a moderation principle. The point is that, if the oxygen is very easy to remove, then it is a very good oxidant, but not a good oxidation catalyst, since it is difficult to put the oxygen back.

[1] "This reaction follows the Mars van Krevelen mechanism, (16) in which CO removes oxygen from the oxide. This oxygen is then replenished in some way, regenerating the catalyst. It is now understood that, in order to enhance the formation of CO2 from CO, the key quantity is the formation energy of an oxygen vacancy in the oxide; by making the oxygen vacancy formation energy more favorable, the oxidation of CO can be enhanced."
          [1] "A large number of chemical reactions have been studied with ceria as the catalyst, key among these being CO oxidation to CO2. (6-15) This reaction follows the Mars van Krevelen mechanism, (16) in which CO removes oxygen from the oxide. This oxygen is then replenished in some way, regenerating the catalyst. It is now understood that, in order to enhance the formation of CO2 from CO, the key quantity is the formation energy of an oxygen vacancy in the oxide; by making the oxygen vacancy formation energy more favorable, the oxidation of CO can be enhanced."

[1] "In such reactions, the gases introduced in the reactor contain a reductant (e.g., an alkane, CO, H2) and an oxidant (e.g., O2, CO2, N2O). In the Marsvan Krevelen mechanism, the reductant is oxidized by the oxygen atoms from the oxides surface layer (not by adsorbed oxygen or by gas-phase oxygen). When the oxidation products desorb, they leave behind oxygen vacancies. The role of the gas-phase oxidant, introduced with the feed, is to annihilate the oxygen vacancies (to reoxidize the surface)."
          [2] "The assumption is that the smaller is ΔEv, the better oxidant is the surface. Once we accept this idea, we can calculate ΔEv for a quick screening of the oxidative power of various oxides (doped or undoped). Moreover, if we want to make an oxide a better oxidant, we should look for modifications that make ΔEv smaller."
          [3] "However, one must keep in mind that a very small ΔEv means that the surface is a good oxidant, but it is not necessarily a good oxidation catalyst. To complete the catalytic cycle, the gaseous oxidant (oxygen, CO2, N2O) must be able to reoxidize the surface. If oxygen is too easy to remove from the surface layer, it will be difficult to put back."

[1] "A large fraction of the output of the chemical industry consists of products obtained by oxidation or oxidative dehydrogenation reactions catalyzed by oxides. 1-6 In most cases, the reaction proceeds through a Marsvan Krevelen mechanism. 7,8 The species to be oxidized reacts with the oxygen atoms at the surface of the oxide, creating oxygen vacancies. The reduced oxide is oxidized by reacting with gas-phase oxygen."
          [2] "We use oxygen vacancy formation energy (OVFE) as a measure of how easily lattice oxygen may participate in the Mars and Van Krevelen mechanism for oxidation reactions."
          [3] "We calculate with density functional theory how OVFE is affected when some of Zn atoms in ZnO(1010) surface layer are substituted by other metal dopants."
          [4] "We find that Li, Na, K, Rb, Cs, Os, Rh, Ir, Ni, Pd, Pt, Cu, Ag, Au, and Cd decrease OVFE and prefer to be located at the surface of ZnO rather than in the bulk."
          [5] "Mg, Ca, Sr, Ba, Sc, Y, La, Ti, Zr, Hf, Ce, V, Nb, Ta, Cr, Mo, W, Mn, Re, Fe, Ru, Co, Al, Ga, Sn, and Pb increase OVFE."
          [6] "Most of the dopants that increase OVFE prefer to substitute Zn atoms in the bulk, except for Ca, Sr, Ba, La, Ce, Re, Fe, Ru, Co, Sn, and Pb, which prefer to substitute a Zn atom at the surface."





"Many oxides catalyze oxidation reactions through the Marsvan Krevelen mechanism in which the oxygen is supplied from the surface of the oxide. 59 The reduced oxide is reoxidized by reacting with the oxygen molecules in the gas. As the oxygen supplied to the molecule being oxidized comes from the surface of the oxide, the energy of formation of an oxygen vacancy (VO) at the surface of the oxide is often a good indicator of the oxidizing power of the oxide."

[1] "The energy of CO reaction with an oxygen atom from the surface layer decays linearly with the energy of vacancy formation ΔEv, whereas the energy of adsorption of O2 at a vacancy is a linear function of ΔEv."
          [2] "These are the only two reactions in the mechanism whose energy varies from one doped oxide to another."
          [3] "Because they both depend on the energy of oxygen vacancy formation, the latter quantity is a good descriptor of catalytic activity."
          [4] "In deciding which intermediate reactions are most likely from an energetic point of view, we impose a spin conservation rule: a reaction that requires flipping a spin is too slow for catalysis."
          [5] "Because of this, we only consider reactions that conserve spin."
          [6] "We find that all the dopants studied here lower the energy of vacancy formation; therefore, the doped oxides are better oxidants than the undoped ones."



[2] "The energy of oxygen-vacancy formation has been measured but the results are at variance due to differences in the method of preparation. It is therefore not possible to compare reliably the values calculated here with experiments. Measurements of the equilibrium between gaseous O2 and ceria have been used to determine the enthalpy of oxygen-vacancy formation, and the re- sults have been reviewed by Mongensen et al. [46]. It was found that when x in CeO2x is 105 the enthalpy of vacancy formation (to generate O2) is 2.6 eV. This is substantially smaller than the value of 3.36 eV obtained by DFT calculations. However, this enthalpy depends strongly on vacancy concentration [46]: for example, it is 4.9 eV when x = 103. However, more recent results have created a great deal of confusion. The energy to form vacan- cies depends on the temperature of calcination: calcining at high temperature leads to a form of ceria that binds oxygen very strongly [47]. It appears that nano-structured ceria releases oxygen more readily than bulk ceria [4851]. A possible, simple explana- tion may be that in systems with very high surface area one detects the formation of surface oxygen vacancies; their formation re- quires lower energy than forming bulk vacancies. Some measure- ments have correlated the uptake or release of oxygen with the area [48]. Nano-rods of ceria displaying the (0 0 1) and (1 1 0) faces are more active in oxidizing CO than nano-particles of ceria [52] which suggests a dependence of the energy to form oxygen vacan- cies on the crystal face, which is supported by computations [53]."
          [3] "The state having the lowest energy, for the doped slab, has zero spin polarization. Replacing a Ce atom in the surface layer with a Pt atom causes a change in the atomic positions in the top layer: the oxygen atoms neighboring the Pt dopant are closer to it than they were to the Ce atom that has been substituted: the PtO distance is 2.12 Å while the CeO distance in the pure ceria is 2.33 Å. The 2.12 Å PtO distance in doped ceria is longer than the PtO distance in PtO2 (the measured PtO distance is 1.99 Å and the calculated one is 2.00 Å). As the oxygen atoms get closer to the Pt dopant, their distance to the Ce atoms increases from 2.33 Å to 2.43 Å. This increase in the CeO distance suggests that the strength of this bond is diminished. Furthermore, an increased PtO bond, when compared to that of PtO2, suggests that the PtO bond in doped ceria is not as strong as the PtO bond in PtO2."
          [4] "The weakening of the bond between the oxygen atoms neigh- boring the Pt atom is reflected in the change in the energy required for making an oxygen vacancy. To remove an O atom from the top layer of the pure oxide, to form a O2 molecule in the gas phase,costs 3.00 eV. The lowest energy state of a pure ceria slab with an oxygen vacancy in it has Ns = 2 (two unpaired spins). The forma- tion energy for pure ceria is consistent with that calculated by Ganduglia-Pirovano et al. [41]. For the Pt-doped ceria, the forma- tion of an oxygen vacancy, in the top layer, near the dopant, costs 2.15 eV. The lowest energy state of the slab with a vacancy in it has Ns = 0."
          [5] "The removal of an oxygen atom, to form a vacancy, leaves be- hind the two electrons that had formed the oxygenmetal bond. Previous calculations, using DFT + U, have shown that these elec- trons are localized on the f-orbitals of two Ce atoms, converting Ce4+ ions to Ce3+. However, one should keep in mind that these for- mal charges are merely a metaphor: a more appropriate statement would be that the formation of a vacancy reduces the positive charge on the Ce atoms. This behavior is different from that ob- tained with DFTGGA, which does not show the formal reduction of Ce4+ to Ce3+. The experiments suggest that this reduction is pres- ent and this is one of the reasons for the current preference for DFT + U. To test the degree of reduction, we calculated the Bader charges [41,43,44] before and after vacancy formation. The results,for pure ceria, are shown in Fig. 7a and b. The cerium atom in the surface layer of pure ceria has a positive charge of 2.33 (i.e. when forming the oxide the Ce atom donates 2.33 electrons) and the charge on the oxygen atoms (in both the top and the second layer) is 1.18 (when forming the oxide an oxygen atom gains 1.18 elec- trons). When the vacancy is formed, the triangular symmetry of the Ce atoms closest to the surface is broken: the charge on two of the Ce atoms surrounding the vacancy changes from 2.33 to 2.11. The charge on the third Ce atom neighboring the vacancy is unchanged. The formation of the vacancy hardly changes the charge on the oxygen atoms (see Fig. 7b). It is debatable whether the small decrease in the positive charge on two of the Ce atoms,when the vacancy is formed, entitles us to say that Ce4+ is reduced to Ce3+. The experimental evidence for the reduction of Ce upon the formation of an oxygen vacancy is based on the XPS spectra. When the oxide is reduced, a shoulder develops in the XPS spectrum at energies where the XPS spectrum of Ce in Ce2O3 is located. Unfor- tunately, the position of the XPS peaks depends on the electronic structure of the initial and final state, not only on the charge of the atom. Therefore, we do not consider the XPS spectra as provid- ing conclusive evidence for Ce reduction. Theory is not helpful either since the electronic structure is affected by the value of U,and there is no compelling reason to adopt a specific U value."
          [6] "The effect of doping on the atomic charges is shown in Fig. 7c. Replacing a Ce atom with a Pt atom reduces the charge on the adja- cent oxygen atoms in the top layer from 1.18 to 1.03. Pt has a much lower positive charge than the Ce atom it replaced (1.35 in- stead of 2.33). The main effect of vacancy creation is the reduction of Pt (its charge changes from 1.36 to 0.83). This is accompanied by a small reduction of the positive charge on cerium and a slight in- crease of the negative charge on oxygen. The presence of a reduc- ible dopant in a reducible oxide introduces a new element controlling the fate of the electrons left behind when O is removed:they can reduce the cations of the host or the dopant and in the present case the dopant is reduced. Either effect contributes to lowering the energy of vacancy formation."
          [7] "Because of these difficulties in validating the calculated the en- ergy of vacancy formation, we do not place much emphasis on the absolute values of the numbers but assume that the qualitative conclusion that the presence of Pt lowers substantially the energy required for making an oxygen vacancy is correct."
          [8] "As shown in previous work [40,53,57,58], dopants that lower the energy of oxygen-vacancy formation make the oxide a more reactive (than the undoped oxide). This suggests that, in the case of methane activation, the oxygen atoms whose bond to the sur- face is weakened by the presence of Pt will form stronger bonds with the CH3 radical and the hydrogen atom formed by breaking the CH bond. An alternative is that some of the dissociation frag- ments may bind to the Pt dopant. The BronstedEvansPolanyi rule [1322] further suggests that a stronger binding of the prod- ucts will result in a lowering of the activation energy for bond breaking. Theory can test these inferences."
          [9] "Our DFT calculations show that methane dissociates to form a CH3 radical and an H atom, and these two fragments bind to two of the oxygen atoms weakened by the presence of the dopant."
          [10] "The reaction path for this process, obtained with the nudged elastic band (NEB) method [59,60], is shown in Fig. 8. The key energies are given on the potential energy diagrams in Fig. 9. The geometries of these key states are shown in Fig. 10 (on pure ceria) and Fig. 11 (on doped ceria)."
          [11] "Different points on the graph shown in Fig. 8 correspond to dif- ferent geometries along the reaction path. The NEB method opti- mizes these points so that the line joining them passes through the transition state. The shape of the rubber band for the disso- ciative adsorption of methane on Pt-doped ceria is very unusual. The geometry 1 corresponds to physisorbed methane. The binding energy is 0.16 eV, on doped ceria, and 0.21 eV on pure ceria (see Fig. 9). DFT does not include van der Waals interactions and there- fore, the measured binding energy should be larger than these val- ues. The structure of the physisorbed methane on pure ceria is shown in Fig. 10a. A hydrogen atom in methane coordinates to an oxygen atom in the top layer. The position of methane on the Pt-doped ceria is fairly similar. There is no indication that Pt forms a bond with CH4."
          [12] "The geometries 57 along the NEB (see Fig. 8) correspond to a rapid rise of the energy caused by the breaking of the CH bond. Point 7 corresponds to the transition state, whose energy is 1.29 eV on pure ceria, and 1.08 eV on Pt-doped ceria (Fig. 9). The important qualitative result is that doping lowers the activation energy for the breaking of the CH bond. This is the rate-limiting step in all methane activation processes. The geometry of the tran- sition state, for pure ceria, is shown in Fig. 10d. An oxygenH bond of 1.22 Å is formed with one of the oxygen atoms in the top layer;the CH bond is stretched but not broken (its length is 1.41 Å). The geometry of the transition state on the Pt-doped surface is shown in Fig. 11d. This is very similar to the one seen for pure ceria, except that the activation energy is lower. The Pt dopant does not form bonds with the methane or any of the fragments (H or CH3) created by dissociation. The role of Pt is to activate the oxygen atoms next to it."
          [13] "The points 822 correspond to metastable states in which the CH3 group swings around to move close to an oxygen atom on the surface. This large-scale motion does not involve bond stretch- ing or breaking, and this is why the energy does not change much even though the geometry does. The energy of the metastable states is lower than the TS energy, and it is 1.08 eV on pure ceria and 0.90 eV on doped ceria. One of the metastable geometries is shown in Fig. 10c, for pure ceria, and Fig. 11c, for doped ceria."
          [14] "The rapid decrease in energy, as the geometry changes from the points 21 to 25 (Fig. 8), corresponds to the formation of the bond between the C atom in CH3 and an oxygen atom in the surface. The energy of the dissociated state is 1.31 eV for pure ceria and 2.11 eV on doped ceria (see Fig. 9). The geometries of the dissoci- ated states are shown in Fig. 10b (for pure ceria) and Fig. 11b (for doped ceria). Both fragments are binding to oxygen atoms in the surface layers. In the case of the Pt-doped surface, the methyl rad- ical is slightly rotated (when compared to its position on pure cer- ia) so that one H atom gets closer to the Pt atom."
          [15] "The Bader charges on the atoms in the transition state and the final, dissociated state on pure ceria are shown in Fig. 12a and b. The most conspicuous feature is the large change on the charge on the carbon from 0.44 in the transition state to 0.24 in the methoxide formed when CH3 binds to the surface. The charge of the hydrogen atom forming the hydroxyl changes from 0.39 in the transition state to 0.63 in the final (dissociated) state. This is accompanied by a substantial change in the charge of the oxygen atom forming the hydroxyl from 1.17 to 1.34. The electron charge lost by the carbon atom, when going from the transition state to the final state, is donated to the Ce and the O atoms, each of them taking a small amount of electron charge. A similar behav- ior is observed for Pt-doped ceria. It is remarkable that in spite of the large charge transfer occurring on the carbon and the H and O atoms forming the hydroxyl, there is no charge change on the Pt atom."

[1] "An essential step in the Marsvan Krevelen oxidation mechanism is the reaction of a surface oxygen atom with a gas-phase reducing agent, to form an oxidation product and an oxygen vacancy on the surface. The high energy required for forming an oxygen vacancy is one reason why oxides perform oxidation reactions at high temperature."
          [2] "We expect that the dopant lowers the oxidation temperature by weakening the bond between the oxygen and the oxide. Thus, we can measure the oxidizing capacity of an oxide by calculating the energy needed to form a vacancy."
          [3] "However, it is important to keep in mind that this is not a measure of catalytic activity, because a second important step is the ability to heal the vacancy formed by the oxidation process by adsorbing and activating oxygen from the gas phase."

[1] "Some (Cu, Fe) are capable of having two different valence states, whereas some (Zn, Mg, Al) have only one. All of them lower substantially the energy of vacancy formation on the two faces."
          [2] "The oxygen atoms that are easier to remove are more reactive, and the lowering of the energy of oxygen-vacancy formation is a good descriptor of the extent to which doping makes the oxide a better oxidant."
          [3] "For example, (2, 3, 5) for several doped oxides, CO reacts more readily with an oxygen atom near the dopant than it would in the absence of the dopant: doping facilitates the Marsvan Krevelen mechanism (6, 7) for oxidation."
          [4] "Dopants having a higher valence than the cation they replace in the oxide (e.g., Zn oxide doped with Ti) tend to adsorb O2 from the gas phase and activate it to make it a better oxidant."
          [5] "The oxygen atoms engaged in the oxidation reaction come from the gas phase not from the surface."
          [6] "Doping facilitates the dissociative adsorption of molecules. This happens either because one of the fragments binds to the dopant and the other to an oxygen atom nearby or because both fragments bind to the surface oxygen atoms activated by the presence of the dopant."
          [7] "The energy of oxygen-vacancy formation can be used as a crude predictor of the ability of the oxygen atoms at the surface of the oxide to engage in chemical reactions."

If a Mars-van Krevelen mechanism is accepted for CO oxidation on Corresponding author.E-mail addresses: boronat@itq.upv.es (M. Boronat), acorma@itq.upv.es (A. Corma). Au/CeO2, then CO2 is formed when CO takes a oxygen atom from the oxide surface creating a oxygen vacancy defect, and therefore the oxidation activity of a catalyst should be inversely related to the oxygen vacancy energy formation.



[1] "It is widely believed that CO directly combines with lattice oxygen atom on ceria, through the Marsvan Krevelen mechanism [7]. However, the relevant reaction dynamics has not been satisfactorily unravelled."
          [2] "If we define the formation energy of an O vacancy as: Evac = E(cellvac) + 1/2E(O2)  E(cell), where the E (cellvac) and E (cell) are total energies of the optimized surfaces with and without an oxygen vacancy, and E (O2) is the total energy of an oxygen molecule in the gas phase, the calculated value of Evac for the undoped CeO2 (111) surface is 2.87 eV per vacancy. By contrast, Evac of the Ce0.75Zr0.25O2 (111) surface is reduced by approximately 20% to 2.35 eV."
          [3] "Zr dopants reduce the energy cost for the formation of oxygen vacancy [4, 29] and thus increase the mobility of lattice oxygen atoms nearby [30]."
          [3] "The presence of Zr dopant promotes the Ce4+  Ce3+ reduction and hence should assist the release of OL, as attested by the reduction of the formation energy of oxygen vacancy."

[1] "The energy of vacancy formation is an indirect measure of the ability of the oxide to work as an oxidant in catalytic oxidation taking place by a Marsvan Krevelen mechanism."
          [2] "If the oxygen is too easy to remove, it is difficult to put it back."
          [3] "In designing an oxidation catalyst, by doping an oxide, one should aim for the middle ground: the dopant should make it easy to remove an oxygen atom, but not too easy."
          [4] "We call this a moderation principle."
          [1] "In the Marsvan Krevelen (MvK) mechanism, the reductant is oxidized by the oxygen atoms from the surface of the oxide (not by adsorbed oxygen). The easier it is to make a vacancy, the better oxidant the surface is."
          [2] "This implies that doping an oxide surface with a LVD makes it a better oxidant."
          [3] "If the oxygen is too easy to remove, it is difficult to put it back."
          [4] "In designing an oxidation catalyst, by doping an oxide, one should aim for the middle ground: the dopant should make it easy to remove an oxygen atom, but not too easy."

The energy (Evf) required for removing one of the oxygen atoms to form a vacancy in the surface layer and half an oxygen molecule in the gas phase.
          On the other hand, CO oxidation by using any one of the four oxygen atoms of the AuxTi1xO2 surface is exothermic; on this surface CO oxidation is thermodynamically favored.
          After adsorption, the oxygen molecule reacts with gas-phase CO to form a carbonate (figure 1e), with a very substantial release of energy (about 4 eV). This complex decomposes to release CO2 and leaves behind an oxygen atom that fills the vacancy. This restores the surface to its initial state, which means that this set of reactions is catalytic.
          The essential elements of the oxidation mechanism proposed here involve the weakening, by the dopant, of the bond between the oxygen atoms in the top surface layer and the oxide, and the reactivity of the oxygen vacancy and of the molecules adsorbed at an oxygen vacancy site.
          The stability of the doped oxide depends on the method of preparation and the composition of the reacting gases.
          A good oxidation catalyst in this class of compounds requires a fine balance between the rate of oxide reduction and oxidation.
          The error is caused by the electron self- interaction in DFT, which favors the delocalization of the electron in the d- or f-bands where the electron should be localized on individual atoms.
          A good catalyst in this class must strike a balance between the ability to donate an oxygen atom during oxidation, and that of taking oxy- gen from the gas phase to heal the oxygen vacancy formed by the oxidation reaction.
          The oxidation takes place by a Mars-van Krevelen mechanism;
          To determine to what extent the oxide becomes a better oxidant when doped with Au, we have calcu- lated the energy (Evf) required for removing one of the oxygen atoms to form a vacancy in the surface layer and half an oxygen molecule in the gas phase.
          Doping weakens dramatically the bond of surface oxygen to the oxide, even when a Ti atom is substituted by Au in the slab sub layer (not shown).
          However, O2 binds more weakly on an bridging-oxygen vacancy on the Au-doped (DeO2  0:68 eV) than on a pure TiO2(110) surface (DeO2  2:80 eV).





If a doped oxide is used as an oxidation catalyst by a Marsvan Krevelen mechanism, then one should seek a dopant that makes it easy to make oxygen vacancies, but not too easy. Informally, we call this a moderation principle. The point is that, if the oxygen is very easy to remove, then it is a very good oxidant, but not a good oxidation catalyst, since it is difficult to put the oxygen back.

[1] "This reaction follows the Mars van Krevelen mechanism, (16) in which CO removes oxygen from the oxide. This oxygen is then replenished in some way, regenerating the catalyst. It is now understood that, in order to enhance the formation of CO2 from CO, the key quantity is the formation energy of an oxygen vacancy in the oxide; by making the oxygen vacancy formation energy more favorable, the oxidation of CO can be enhanced."
          [1] "A large number of chemical reactions have been studied with ceria as the catalyst, key among these being CO oxidation to CO2. (6-15) This reaction follows the Mars van Krevelen mechanism, (16) in which CO removes oxygen from the oxide. This oxygen is then replenished in some way, regenerating the catalyst. It is now understood that, in order to enhance the formation of CO2 from CO, the key quantity is the formation energy of an oxygen vacancy in the oxide; by making the oxygen vacancy formation energy more favorable, the oxidation of CO can be enhanced."

[1] "In such reactions, the gases introduced in the reactor contain a reductant (e.g., an alkane, CO, H2) and an oxidant (e.g., O2, CO2, N2O). In the Marsvan Krevelen mechanism, the reductant is oxidized by the oxygen atoms from the oxides surface layer (not by adsorbed oxygen or by gas-phase oxygen). When the oxidation products desorb, they leave behind oxygen vacancies. The role of the gas-phase oxidant, introduced with the feed, is to annihilate the oxygen vacancies (to reoxidize the surface)."
          [2] "The assumption is that the smaller is ΔEv, the better oxidant is the surface. Once we accept this idea, we can calculate ΔEv for a quick screening of the oxidative power of various oxides (doped or undoped). Moreover, if we want to make an oxide a better oxidant, we should look for modifications that make ΔEv smaller."
          [3] "However, one must keep in mind that a very small ΔEv means that the surface is a good oxidant, but it is not necessarily a good oxidation catalyst. To complete the catalytic cycle, the gaseous oxidant (oxygen, CO2, N2O) must be able to reoxidize the surface. If oxygen is too easy to remove from the surface layer, it will be difficult to put back."

[1] "A large fraction of the output of the chemical industry consists of products obtained by oxidation or oxidative dehydrogenation reactions catalyzed by oxides. 1-6 In most cases, the reaction proceeds through a Marsvan Krevelen mechanism. 7,8 The species to be oxidized reacts with the oxygen atoms at the surface of the oxide, creating oxygen vacancies. The reduced oxide is oxidized by reacting with gas-phase oxygen."
          [2] "We use oxygen vacancy formation energy (OVFE) as a measure of how easily lattice oxygen may participate in the Mars and Van Krevelen mechanism for oxidation reactions."
          [3] "We calculate with density functional theory how OVFE is affected when some of Zn atoms in ZnO(1010) surface layer are substituted by other metal dopants."
          [4] "We find that Li, Na, K, Rb, Cs, Os, Rh, Ir, Ni, Pd, Pt, Cu, Ag, Au, and Cd decrease OVFE and prefer to be located at the surface of ZnO rather than in the bulk."
          [5] "Mg, Ca, Sr, Ba, Sc, Y, La, Ti, Zr, Hf, Ce, V, Nb, Ta, Cr, Mo, W, Mn, Re, Fe, Ru, Co, Al, Ga, Sn, and Pb increase OVFE."
          [6] "Most of the dopants that increase OVFE prefer to substitute Zn atoms in the bulk, except for Ca, Sr, Ba, La, Ce, Re, Fe, Ru, Co, Sn, and Pb, which prefer to substitute a Zn atom at the surface."





"Many oxides catalyze oxidation reactions through the Marsvan Krevelen mechanism in which the oxygen is supplied from the surface of the oxide. 59 The reduced oxide is reoxidized by reacting with the oxygen molecules in the gas. As the oxygen supplied to the molecule being oxidized comes from the surface of the oxide, the energy of formation of an oxygen vacancy (VO) at the surface of the oxide is often a good indicator of the oxidizing power of the oxide."

[1] "The energy of CO reaction with an oxygen atom from the surface layer decays linearly with the energy of vacancy formation ΔEv, whereas the energy of adsorption of O2 at a vacancy is a linear function of ΔEv."
          [2] "These are the only two reactions in the mechanism whose energy varies from one doped oxide to another."
          [3] "Because they both depend on the energy of oxygen vacancy formation, the latter quantity is a good descriptor of catalytic activity."
          [4] "In deciding which intermediate reactions are most likely from an energetic point of view, we impose a spin conservation rule: a reaction that requires flipping a spin is too slow for catalysis."
          [5] "Because of this, we only consider reactions that conserve spin."
          [6] "We find that all the dopants studied here lower the energy of vacancy formation; therefore, the doped oxides are better oxidants than the undoped ones."



[2] "The energy of oxygen-vacancy formation has been measured but the results are at variance due to differences in the method of preparation. It is therefore not possible to compare reliably the values calculated here with experiments. Measurements of the equilibrium between gaseous O2 and ceria have been used to determine the enthalpy of oxygen-vacancy formation, and the re- sults have been reviewed by Mongensen et al. [46]. It was found that when x in CeO2x is 105 the enthalpy of vacancy formation (to generate O2) is 2.6 eV. This is substantially smaller than the value of 3.36 eV obtained by DFT calculations. However, this enthalpy depends strongly on vacancy concentration [46]: for example, it is 4.9 eV when x = 103. However, more recent results have created a great deal of confusion. The energy to form vacan- cies depends on the temperature of calcination: calcining at high temperature leads to a form of ceria that binds oxygen very strongly [47]. It appears that nano-structured ceria releases oxygen more readily than bulk ceria [4851]. A possible, simple explana- tion may be that in systems with very high surface area one detects the formation of surface oxygen vacancies; their formation re- quires lower energy than forming bulk vacancies. Some measure- ments have correlated the uptake or release of oxygen with the area [48]. Nano-rods of ceria displaying the (0 0 1) and (1 1 0) faces are more active in oxidizing CO than nano-particles of ceria [52] which suggests a dependence of the energy to form oxygen vacan- cies on the crystal face, which is supported by computations [53]."
          [3] "The state having the lowest energy, for the doped slab, has zero spin polarization. Replacing a Ce atom in the surface layer with a Pt atom causes a change in the atomic positions in the top layer: the oxygen atoms neighboring the Pt dopant are closer to it than they were to the Ce atom that has been substituted: the PtO distance is 2.12 Å while the CeO distance in the pure ceria is 2.33 Å. The 2.12 Å PtO distance in doped ceria is longer than the PtO distance in PtO2 (the measured PtO distance is 1.99 Å and the calculated one is 2.00 Å). As the oxygen atoms get closer to the Pt dopant, their distance to the Ce atoms increases from 2.33 Å to 2.43 Å. This increase in the CeO distance suggests that the strength of this bond is diminished. Furthermore, an increased PtO bond, when compared to that of PtO2, suggests that the PtO bond in doped ceria is not as strong as the PtO bond in PtO2."
          [4] "The weakening of the bond between the oxygen atoms neigh- boring the Pt atom is reflected in the change in the energy required for making an oxygen vacancy. To remove an O atom from the top layer of the pure oxide, to form a O2 molecule in the gas phase,costs 3.00 eV. The lowest energy state of a pure ceria slab with an oxygen vacancy in it has Ns = 2 (two unpaired spins). The forma- tion energy for pure ceria is consistent with that calculated by Ganduglia-Pirovano et al. [41]. For the Pt-doped ceria, the forma- tion of an oxygen vacancy, in the top layer, near the dopant, costs 2.15 eV. The lowest energy state of the slab with a vacancy in it has Ns = 0."
          [5] "The removal of an oxygen atom, to form a vacancy, leaves be- hind the two electrons that had formed the oxygenmetal bond. Previous calculations, using DFT + U, have shown that these elec- trons are localized on the f-orbitals of two Ce atoms, converting Ce4+ ions to Ce3+. However, one should keep in mind that these for- mal charges are merely a metaphor: a more appropriate statement would be that the formation of a vacancy reduces the positive charge on the Ce atoms. This behavior is different from that ob- tained with DFTGGA, which does not show the formal reduction of Ce4+ to Ce3+. The experiments suggest that this reduction is pres- ent and this is one of the reasons for the current preference for DFT + U. To test the degree of reduction, we calculated the Bader charges [41,43,44] before and after vacancy formation. The results,for pure ceria, are shown in Fig. 7a and b. The cerium atom in the surface layer of pure ceria has a positive charge of 2.33 (i.e. when forming the oxide the Ce atom donates 2.33 electrons) and the charge on the oxygen atoms (in both the top and the second layer) is 1.18 (when forming the oxide an oxygen atom gains 1.18 elec- trons). When the vacancy is formed, the triangular symmetry of the Ce atoms closest to the surface is broken: the charge on two of the Ce atoms surrounding the vacancy changes from 2.33 to 2.11. The charge on the third Ce atom neighboring the vacancy is unchanged. The formation of the vacancy hardly changes the charge on the oxygen atoms (see Fig. 7b). It is debatable whether the small decrease in the positive charge on two of the Ce atoms,when the vacancy is formed, entitles us to say that Ce4+ is reduced to Ce3+. The experimental evidence for the reduction of Ce upon the formation of an oxygen vacancy is based on the XPS spectra. When the oxide is reduced, a shoulder develops in the XPS spectrum at energies where the XPS spectrum of Ce in Ce2O3 is located. Unfor- tunately, the position of the XPS peaks depends on the electronic structure of the initial and final state, not only on the charge of the atom. Therefore, we do not consider the XPS spectra as provid- ing conclusive evidence for Ce reduction. Theory is not helpful either since the electronic structure is affected by the value of U,and there is no compelling reason to adopt a specific U value."
          [6] "The effect of doping on the atomic charges is shown in Fig. 7c. Replacing a Ce atom with a Pt atom reduces the charge on the adja- cent oxygen atoms in the top layer from 1.18 to 1.03. Pt has a much lower positive charge than the Ce atom it replaced (1.35 in- stead of 2.33). The main effect of vacancy creation is the reduction of Pt (its charge changes from 1.36 to 0.83). This is accompanied by a small reduction of the positive charge on cerium and a slight in- crease of the negative charge on oxygen. The presence of a reduc- ible dopant in a reducible oxide introduces a new element controlling the fate of the electrons left behind when O is removed:they can reduce the cations of the host or the dopant and in the present case the dopant is reduced. Either effect contributes to lowering the energy of vacancy formation."
          [7] "Because of these difficulties in validating the calculated the en- ergy of vacancy formation, we do not place much emphasis on the absolute values of the numbers but assume that the qualitative conclusion that the presence of Pt lowers substantially the energy required for making an oxygen vacancy is correct."
          [8] "As shown in previous work [40,53,57,58], dopants that lower the energy of oxygen-vacancy formation make the oxide a more reactive (than the undoped oxide). This suggests that, in the case of methane activation, the oxygen atoms whose bond to the sur- face is weakened by the presence of Pt will form stronger bonds with the CH3 radical and the hydrogen atom formed by breaking the CH bond. An alternative is that some of the dissociation frag- ments may bind to the Pt dopant. The BronstedEvansPolanyi rule [1322] further suggests that a stronger binding of the prod- ucts will result in a lowering of the activation energy for bond breaking. Theory can test these inferences."
          [9] "Our DFT calculations show that methane dissociates to form a CH3 radical and an H atom, and these two fragments bind to two of the oxygen atoms weakened by the presence of the dopant."
          [10] "The reaction path for this process, obtained with the nudged elastic band (NEB) method [59,60], is shown in Fig. 8. The key energies are given on the potential energy diagrams in Fig. 9. The geometries of these key states are shown in Fig. 10 (on pure ceria) and Fig. 11 (on doped ceria)."
          [11] "Different points on the graph shown in Fig. 8 correspond to dif- ferent geometries along the reaction path. The NEB method opti- mizes these points so that the line joining them passes through the transition state. The shape of the rubber band for the disso- ciative adsorption of methane on Pt-doped ceria is very unusual. The geometry 1 corresponds to physisorbed methane. The binding energy is 0.16 eV, on doped ceria, and 0.21 eV on pure ceria (see Fig. 9). DFT does not include van der Waals interactions and there- fore, the measured binding energy should be larger than these val- ues. The structure of the physisorbed methane on pure ceria is shown in Fig. 10a. A hydrogen atom in methane coordinates to an oxygen atom in the top layer. The position of methane on the Pt-doped ceria is fairly similar. There is no indication that Pt forms a bond with CH4."
          [12] "The geometries 57 along the NEB (see Fig. 8) correspond to a rapid rise of the energy caused by the breaking of the CH bond. Point 7 corresponds to the transition state, whose energy is 1.29 eV on pure ceria, and 1.08 eV on Pt-doped ceria (Fig. 9). The important qualitative result is that doping lowers the activation energy for the breaking of the CH bond. This is the rate-limiting step in all methane activation processes. The geometry of the tran- sition state, for pure ceria, is shown in Fig. 10d. An oxygenH bond of 1.22 Å is formed with one of the oxygen atoms in the top layer;the CH bond is stretched but not broken (its length is 1.41 Å). The geometry of the transition state on the Pt-doped surface is shown in Fig. 11d. This is very similar to the one seen for pure ceria, except that the activation energy is lower. The Pt dopant does not form bonds with the methane or any of the fragments (H or CH3) created by dissociation. The role of Pt is to activate the oxygen atoms next to it."
          [13] "The points 822 correspond to metastable states in which the CH3 group swings around to move close to an oxygen atom on the surface. This large-scale motion does not involve bond stretch- ing or breaking, and this is why the energy does not change much even though the geometry does. The energy of the metastable states is lower than the TS energy, and it is 1.08 eV on pure ceria and 0.90 eV on doped ceria. One of the metastable geometries is shown in Fig. 10c, for pure ceria, and Fig. 11c, for doped ceria."
          [14] "The rapid decrease in energy, as the geometry changes from the points 21 to 25 (Fig. 8), corresponds to the formation of the bond between the C atom in CH3 and an oxygen atom in the surface. The energy of the dissociated state is 1.31 eV for pure ceria and 2.11 eV on doped ceria (see Fig. 9). The geometries of the dissoci- ated states are shown in Fig. 10b (for pure ceria) and Fig. 11b (for doped ceria). Both fragments are binding to oxygen atoms in the surface layers. In the case of the Pt-doped surface, the methyl rad- ical is slightly rotated (when compared to its position on pure cer- ia) so that one H atom gets closer to the Pt atom."
          [15] "The Bader charges on the atoms in the transition state and the final, dissociated state on pure ceria are shown in Fig. 12a and b. The most conspicuous feature is the large change on the charge on the carbon from 0.44 in the transition state to 0.24 in the methoxide formed when CH3 binds to the surface. The charge of the hydrogen atom forming the hydroxyl changes from 0.39 in the transition state to 0.63 in the final (dissociated) state. This is accompanied by a substantial change in the charge of the oxygen atom forming the hydroxyl from 1.17 to 1.34. The electron charge lost by the carbon atom, when going from the transition state to the final state, is donated to the Ce and the O atoms, each of them taking a small amount of electron charge. A similar behav- ior is observed for Pt-doped ceria. It is remarkable that in spite of the large charge transfer occurring on the carbon and the H and O atoms forming the hydroxyl, there is no charge change on the Pt atom."

[1] "An essential step in the Marsvan Krevelen oxidation mechanism is the reaction of a surface oxygen atom with a gas-phase reducing agent, to form an oxidation product and an oxygen vacancy on the surface. The high energy required for forming an oxygen vacancy is one reason why oxides perform oxidation reactions at high temperature."
          [2] "We expect that the dopant lowers the oxidation temperature by weakening the bond between the oxygen and the oxide. Thus, we can measure the oxidizing capacity of an oxide by calculating the energy needed to form a vacancy."
          [3] "However, it is important to keep in mind that this is not a measure of catalytic activity, because a second important step is the ability to heal the vacancy formed by the oxidation process by adsorbing and activating oxygen from the gas phase."

[1] "Some (Cu, Fe) are capable of having two different valence states, whereas some (Zn, Mg, Al) have only one. All of them lower substantially the energy of vacancy formation on the two faces."
          [2] "The oxygen atoms that are easier to remove are more reactive, and the lowering of the energy of oxygen-vacancy formation is a good descriptor of the extent to which doping makes the oxide a better oxidant."
          [3] "For example, (2, 3, 5) for several doped oxides, CO reacts more readily with an oxygen atom near the dopant than it would in the absence of the dopant: doping facilitates the Marsvan Krevelen mechanism (6, 7) for oxidation."
          [4] "Dopants having a higher valence than the cation they replace in the oxide (e.g., Zn oxide doped with Ti) tend to adsorb O2 from the gas phase and activate it to make it a better oxidant."
          [5] "The oxygen atoms engaged in the oxidation reaction come from the gas phase not from the surface."
          [6] "Doping facilitates the dissociative adsorption of molecules. This happens either because one of the fragments binds to the dopant and the other to an oxygen atom nearby or because both fragments bind to the surface oxygen atoms activated by the presence of the dopant."
          [7] "The energy of oxygen-vacancy formation can be used as a crude predictor of the ability of the oxygen atoms at the surface of the oxide to engage in chemical reactions."

If a Mars-van Krevelen mechanism is accepted for CO oxidation on Corresponding author.E-mail addresses: boronat@itq.upv.es (M. Boronat), acorma@itq.upv.es (A. Corma). Au/CeO2, then CO2 is formed when CO takes a oxygen atom from the oxide surface creating a oxygen vacancy defect, and therefore the oxidation activity of a catalyst should be inversely related to the oxygen vacancy energy formation.



[1] "It is widely believed that CO directly combines with lattice oxygen atom on ceria, through the Marsvan Krevelen mechanism [7]. However, the relevant reaction dynamics has not been satisfactorily unravelled."
          [2] "If we define the formation energy of an O vacancy as: Evac = E(cellvac) + 1/2E(O2)  E(cell), where the E (cellvac) and E (cell) are total energies of the optimized surfaces with and without an oxygen vacancy, and E (O2) is the total energy of an oxygen molecule in the gas phase, the calculated value of Evac for the undoped CeO2 (111) surface is 2.87 eV per vacancy. By contrast, Evac of the Ce0.75Zr0.25O2 (111) surface is reduced by approximately 20% to 2.35 eV."
          [3] "Zr dopants reduce the energy cost for the formation of oxygen vacancy [4, 29] and thus increase the mobility of lattice oxygen atoms nearby [30]."
          [3] "The presence of Zr dopant promotes the Ce4+  Ce3+ reduction and hence should assist the release of OL, as attested by the reduction of the formation energy of oxygen vacancy."

[1] "The energy of vacancy formation is an indirect measure of the ability of the oxide to work as an oxidant in catalytic oxidation taking place by a Marsvan Krevelen mechanism."
          [2] "If the oxygen is too easy to remove, it is difficult to put it back."
          [3] "In designing an oxidation catalyst, by doping an oxide, one should aim for the middle ground: the dopant should make it easy to remove an oxygen atom, but not too easy."
          [4] "We call this a moderation principle."
          [1] "In the Marsvan Krevelen (MvK) mechanism, the reductant is oxidized by the oxygen atoms from the surface of the oxide (not by adsorbed oxygen). The easier it is to make a vacancy, the better oxidant the surface is."
          [2] "This implies that doping an oxide surface with a LVD makes it a better oxidant."
          [3] "If the oxygen is too easy to remove, it is difficult to put it back."
          [4] "In designing an oxidation catalyst, by doping an oxide, one should aim for the middle ground: the dopant should make it easy to remove an oxygen atom, but not too easy."

The energy (Evf) required for removing one of the oxygen atoms to form a vacancy in the surface layer and half an oxygen molecule in the gas phase.
          On the other hand, CO oxidation by using any one of the four oxygen atoms of the AuxTi1xO2 surface is exothermic; on this surface CO oxidation is thermodynamically favored.
          After adsorption, the oxygen molecule reacts with gas-phase CO to form a carbonate (figure 1e), with a very substantial release of energy (about 4 eV). This complex decomposes to release CO2 and leaves behind an oxygen atom that fills the vacancy. This restores the surface to its initial state, which means that this set of reactions is catalytic.
          The essential elements of the oxidation mechanism proposed here involve the weakening, by the dopant, of the bond between the oxygen atoms in the top surface layer and the oxide, and the reactivity of the oxygen vacancy and of the molecules adsorbed at an oxygen vacancy site.
          The stability of the doped oxide depends on the method of preparation and the composition of the reacting gases.
          A good oxidation catalyst in this class of compounds requires a fine balance between the rate of oxide reduction and oxidation.
          The error is caused by the electron self- interaction in DFT, which favors the delocalization of the electron in the d- or f-bands where the electron should be localized on individual atoms.
          A good catalyst in this class must strike a balance between the ability to donate an oxygen atom during oxidation, and that of taking oxy- gen from the gas phase to heal the oxygen vacancy formed by the oxidation reaction.
          The oxidation takes place by a Mars-van Krevelen mechanism;
          To determine to what extent the oxide becomes a better oxidant when doped with Au, we have calcu- lated the energy (Evf) required for removing one of the oxygen atoms to form a vacancy in the surface layer and half an oxygen molecule in the gas phase.
          Doping weakens dramatically the bond of surface oxygen to the oxide, even when a Ti atom is substituted by Au in the slab sub layer (not shown).
          However, O2 binds more weakly on an bridging-oxygen vacancy on the Au-doped (DeO2  0:68 eV) than on a pure TiO2(110) surface (DeO2  2:80 eV).





If a doped oxide is used as an oxidation catalyst by a Marsvan Krevelen mechanism, then one should seek a dopant that makes it easy to make oxygen vacancies, but not too easy. Informally, we call this a moderation principle. The point is that, if the oxygen is very easy to remove, then it is a very good oxidant, but not a good oxidation catalyst, since it is difficult to put the oxygen back.

[1] "This reaction follows the Mars van Krevelen mechanism, (16) in which CO removes oxygen from the oxide. This oxygen is then replenished in some way, regenerating the catalyst. It is now understood that, in order to enhance the formation of CO2 from CO, the key quantity is the formation energy of an oxygen vacancy in the oxide; by making the oxygen vacancy formation energy more favorable, the oxidation of CO can be enhanced."
          [1] "A large number of chemical reactions have been studied with ceria as the catalyst, key among these being CO oxidation to CO2. (6-15) This reaction follows the Mars van Krevelen mechanism, (16) in which CO removes oxygen from the oxide. This oxygen is then replenished in some way, regenerating the catalyst. It is now understood that, in order to enhance the formation of CO2 from CO, the key quantity is the formation energy of an oxygen vacancy in the oxide; by making the oxygen vacancy formation energy more favorable, the oxidation of CO can be enhanced."

[1] "In such reactions, the gases introduced in the reactor contain a reductant (e.g., an alkane, CO, H2) and an oxidant (e.g., O2, CO2, N2O). In the Marsvan Krevelen mechanism, the reductant is oxidized by the oxygen atoms from the oxides surface layer (not by adsorbed oxygen or by gas-phase oxygen). When the oxidation products desorb, they leave behind oxygen vacancies. The role of the gas-phase oxidant, introduced with the feed, is to annihilate the oxygen vacancies (to reoxidize the surface)."
          [2] "The assumption is that the smaller is ΔEv, the better oxidant is the surface. Once we accept this idea, we can calculate ΔEv for a quick screening of the oxidative power of various oxides (doped or undoped). Moreover, if we want to make an oxide a better oxidant, we should look for modifications that make ΔEv smaller."
          [3] "However, one must keep in mind that a very small ΔEv means that the surface is a good oxidant, but it is not necessarily a good oxidation catalyst. To complete the catalytic cycle, the gaseous oxidant (oxygen, CO2, N2O) must be able to reoxidize the surface. If oxygen is too easy to remove from the surface layer, it will be difficult to put back."
