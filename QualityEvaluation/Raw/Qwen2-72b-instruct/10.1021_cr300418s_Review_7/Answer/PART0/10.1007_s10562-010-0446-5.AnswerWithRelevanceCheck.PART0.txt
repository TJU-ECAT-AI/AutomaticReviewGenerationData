          [1] "It is widely believed that CO directly combines with lattice oxygen atom on ceria, through the Marsvan Krevelen mechanism [7]. However, the relevant reaction dynamics has not been satisfactorily unravelled."
          [2] "If we define the formation energy of an O vacancy as: Evac = E(cellvac) + 1/2E(O2)  E(cell), where the E (cellvac) and E (cell) are total energies of the optimized surfaces with and without an oxygen vacancy, and E (O2) is the total energy of an oxygen molecule in the gas phase, the calculated value of Evac for the undoped CeO2 (111) surface is 2.87 eV per vacancy. By contrast, Evac of the Ce0.75Zr0.25O2 (111) surface is reduced by approximately 20% to 2.35 eV."
          [3] "Zr dopants reduce the energy cost for the formation of oxygen vacancy [4, 29] and thus increase the mobility of lattice oxygen atoms nearby [30]."
          [3] "The presence of Zr dopant promotes the Ce4+  Ce3+ reduction and hence should assist the release of OL, as attested by the reduction of the formation energy of oxygen vacancy."

          The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism involves the direct combination of CO with lattice oxygen atoms on ceria surfaces. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) is crucial as it determines the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. Zr dopants reduce the energy cost for the formation of oxygen vacancies, enhancing the mobility of lattice oxygen atoms and thus improving the catalytic activity of the oxide surface. Zr dopants lower the ΔEv, making the surface more active and enhancing the mobility of lattice oxygen atoms, which facilitates the direct oxidation of CO. Zr dopants reduce the energy cost for oxygen vacancy formation, thereby increasing the mobility of lattice oxygen atoms and enhancing the catalytic activity. The presence of Zr dopant promotes the Ce4+ to Ce3+ reduction and hence should assist the release of oxygen for the oxidation process.
