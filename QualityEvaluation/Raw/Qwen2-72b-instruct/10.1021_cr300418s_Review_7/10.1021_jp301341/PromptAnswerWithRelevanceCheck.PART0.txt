<quotes>

[1] "The energy of vacancy formation is an indirect measure of the ability of the oxide to work as an oxidant in catalytic oxidation taking place by a Marsvan Krevelen mechanism."
[2] "If the oxygen is too easy to remove, it is difficult to put it back."
[3] "In designing an oxidation catalyst, by doping an oxide, one should aim for the middle ground: the dopant should make it easy to remove an oxygen atom, but not too easy."
[4] "We call this a moderation principle."

</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>

1.The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions by utilizing oxygen atoms from the surface of the oxide to oxidize the reductant, rather than adsorbed oxygen. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) is significant because it determines the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. If the energy is too low, it becomes difficult to reoxidize the surface with gas-phase oxygen, which is necessary for the catalytic cycle. Therefore, in designing an oxidation catalyst, the dopant should make it easy to remove an oxygen atom, but not too easy, following what is referred to as the moderation principle.

1.火星-范克雷维尔机制在氧化物催化氧化反应中通过利用氧化物表面的氧原子来氧化还原剂，而不是吸附的氧气。形成氧空位所需的能量（ΔEv）是重要的，因为它决定了氧化物表面的氧化能力。如果能量太低，就很难用气相氧气重新氧化表面，这是催化循环所必需的。因此，在设计氧化催化剂时，掺杂剂应该使去除氧原子变得容易，但不要太容易，这遵循所谓的适度原则。

1.In the Mars-van Krevelen mechanism, the oxide surface acts as an oxidant by donating oxygen atoms to the reactant. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) is an indirect measure of the oxide's ability to act as an oxidant. If ΔEv is too low, the oxygen is too easy to remove, making it difficult to reoxidize the surface with gas-phase oxygen. Therefore, in designing an oxidation catalyst, the dopant should make it easy to remove an oxygen atom, but not too easy, which is referred to as the moderation principle.

1.在Mars-van Krevelen机制中，氧化物表面通过向反应物捐赠氧原子来充当氧化剂。形成氧空位所需的能量（ΔEv）是氧化物充当氧化剂能力的间接量度。如果ΔEv太低，氧原子太容易被移除，这使得用气相氧重新氧化表面变得困难。因此，在设计氧化催化剂时，掺杂剂应使移除氧原子变得容易，但不要太容易，这被称为适度原则。

[1] "In the Marsvan Krevelen (MvK) mechanism, the reductant is oxidized by the oxygen atoms from the surface of the oxide (not by adsorbed oxygen). The easier it is to make a vacancy, the better oxidant the surface is."
[2] "This implies that doping an oxide surface with a LVD makes it a better oxidant."
[3] "If the oxygen is too easy to remove, it is difficult to put it back."
[4] "In designing an oxidation catalyst, by doping an oxide, one should aim for the middle ground: the dopant should make it easy to remove an oxygen atom, but not too easy."

1.In the Mars-van Krevelen mechanism, the reductant is oxidized by the oxygen atoms from the surface of the oxide, not by adsorbed oxygen. The easier it is to make a vacancy, the better oxidant the surface is. Doping an oxide surface with a low-valence dopant (LVD) makes it a better oxidant. However, if the oxygen is too easy to remove, it becomes difficult to put it back. In designing an oxidation catalyst by doping an oxide, one should aim for a balance: the dopant should make it easy to remove an oxygen atom, but not too easy.

1.在Mars-van Krevelen机制中，还原剂被氧化物表面的氧原子氧化，而不是被吸附的氧气氧化。形成空位越容易，表面的氧化能力越强。通过低价掺杂剂(LVD)掺杂氧化物表面可以使其成为更好的氧化剂。然而，如果氧太容易被移除，就很难再将其放回。在通过掺杂氧化物设计氧化催化剂时，应该寻求平衡：掺杂剂应该使移除氧原子变得容易，但不要太容易。
