          In the Mars-van Krevelen mechanism, the reductant is oxidized by the oxygen atoms from the surface of the oxide, not by adsorbed oxygen. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) is significant because it determines the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. If the energy is too low, it becomes difficult to reoxidize the surface with gas-phase oxygen, which is necessary for the catalytic cycle. Therefore, in designing an oxidation catalyst, the dopant should make it easy to remove an oxygen atom, but not too easy, following what is referred to as the moderation principle. In the Mars-van Krevelen mechanism, the oxide surface acts as an oxidant by donating oxygen atoms to the reactant. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) is an indirect measure of the oxide's ability to act as an oxidant. If ΔEv is too low, the oxygen is too easy to remove, making it difficult to reoxidize the surface with gas-phase oxygen. Therefore, in designing an oxidation catalyst, the dopant should make it easy to remove an oxygen atom, but not too easy, which is referred to as the moderation principle. The easier it is to make an oxygen vacancy, the better the surface acts as an oxidant. Doping an oxide surface with a low-valence dopant (LVD) makes it a better oxidant. However, if the oxygen is too easy to remove, it becomes difficult to re-oxidize the surface with gas-phase oxygen. In designing an oxidation catalyst, the dopant should make it easy to remove an oxygen atom, but not too easy, aiming for a balance.

          在Mars-van Krevelen机制中，还原剂被氧化物表面的氧原子氧化，而不是被吸附的氧气氧化。形成氧空位所需的能量（ΔEv）是重要的，因为它决定了氧化物表面的氧化能力。如果能量太低，就很难用气相氧气重新氧化表面，这是催化循环所必需的。因此，在设计氧化催化剂时，掺杂剂应该使去除氧原子变得容易，但不要太容易，这遵循所谓的适度原则。在Mars-van Krevelen机制中，氧化物表面通过向反应物捐赠氧原子来充当氧化剂。形成氧空位所需的能量（ΔEv）是氧化物充当氧化剂能力的间接量度。如果ΔEv太低，氧原子太容易被移除，这使得用气相氧重新氧化表面变得困难。因此，在设计氧化催化剂时，掺杂剂应使移除氧原子变得容易，但不要太容易，这被称为适度原则。形成氧空位越容易，表面作为氧化剂的效果越好。通过低价掺杂剂(LVD)掺杂氧化物表面可以使其成为更好的氧化剂。然而，如果氧太容易被移除，就很难用气相氧重新氧化表面。在设计氧化催化剂时，掺杂剂应该使氧原子的移除变得容易，但不要太容易，以达到平衡。
