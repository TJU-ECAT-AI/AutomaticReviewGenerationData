[1] "In the Marsvan Krevelen (MvK) mechanism, the reductant is oxidized by the oxygen atoms from the surface of the oxide (not by adsorbed oxygen). The easier it is to make a vacancy, the better oxidant the surface is."
[2] "This implies that doping an oxide surface with a LVD makes it a better oxidant."
[3] "If the oxygen is too easy to remove, it is difficult to put it back."
[4] "In designing an oxidation catalyst, by doping an oxide, one should aim for the middle ground: the dopant should make it easy to remove an oxygen atom, but not too easy."

1.In the Mars-van Krevelen mechanism, the reductant is oxidized by the oxygen atoms from the surface of the oxide, not by adsorbed oxygen. The easier it is to make an oxygen vacancy, the better the surface acts as an oxidant. Doping an oxide surface with a low-valence dopant (LVD) makes it a better oxidant. However, if the oxygen is too easy to remove, it becomes difficult to re-oxidize the surface with gas-phase oxygen. In designing an oxidation catalyst, the dopant should make it easy to remove an oxygen atom, but not too easy, aiming for a balance.

1.在Mars-van Krevelen机制中，还原剂被氧化物表面的氧原子氧化，而不是被吸附的氧气氧化。形成氧空位越容易，表面作为氧化剂的效果越好。通过低价掺杂剂(LVD)掺杂氧化物表面可以使其成为更好的氧化剂。然而，如果氧太容易被移除，就很难用气相氧重新氧化表面。在设计氧化催化剂时，掺杂剂应该使氧原子的移除变得容易，但不要太容易，以达到平衡。
