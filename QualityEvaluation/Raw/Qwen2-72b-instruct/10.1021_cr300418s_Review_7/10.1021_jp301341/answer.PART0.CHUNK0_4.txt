1.In the Mars-van Krevelen mechanism, the reductant is oxidized by the oxygen atoms from the surface of the oxide, not by adsorbed oxygen. The easier it is to make a vacancy, the better oxidant the surface is. Doping an oxide surface with a low-valence dopant (LVD) makes it a better oxidant. However, if the oxygen is too easy to remove, it becomes difficult to put it back. In designing an oxidation catalyst by doping an oxide, one should aim for the middle ground: the dopant should make it easy to remove an oxygen atom, but not too easy.

1.在Mars-van Krevelen机制中，还原剂被氧化物表面的氧原子氧化，而不是被吸附的氧气氧化。形成空位越容易，表面的氧化能力越强。通过低价掺杂剂(LVD)掺杂氧化物表面可以使其成为更好的氧化剂。然而，如果氧原子太容易去除，就很难再将其放回。在通过掺杂氧化物设计氧化催化剂时，应该寻求中间地带：掺杂剂应该使去除氧原子变得容易，但不要太容易。
