[1] "The energy of vacancy formation is an indirect measure of the ability of the oxide to work as an oxidant in catalytic oxidation taking place by a Marsvan Krevelen mechanism."
[2] "If the oxygen is too easy to remove, it is difficult to put it back."
[3] "In designing an oxidation catalyst, by doping an oxide, one should aim for the middle ground: the dopant should make it easy to remove an oxygen atom, but not too easy."
[4] "We call this a moderation principle."

1.In the Mars-van Krevelen mechanism, the oxide surface acts as an oxidant by donating oxygen atoms to the reactant. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) is an indirect measure of the oxide's ability to act as an oxidant. If ΔEv is too low, the oxygen is too easy to remove, making it difficult to reoxidize the surface with gas-phase oxygen. Therefore, in designing an oxidation catalyst, the dopant should make it easy to remove an oxygen atom, but not too easy, which is referred to as the moderation principle.

1.在Mars-van Krevelen机制中，氧化物表面通过向反应物捐赠氧原子来充当氧化剂。形成氧空位所需的能量（ΔEv）是氧化物充当氧化剂能力的间接量度。如果ΔEv太低，氧原子太容易被移除，这使得用气相氧重新氧化表面变得困难。因此，在设计氧化催化剂时，掺杂剂应使移除氧原子变得容易，但不要太容易，这被称为适度原则。
