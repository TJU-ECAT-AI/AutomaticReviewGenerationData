[1] "The energy of vacancy formation is an indirect measure of the ability of the oxide to work as an oxidant in catalytic oxidation taking place by a Marsvan Krevelen mechanism."
[2] "If the oxygen is too easy to remove, it is difficult to put it back."
[3] "In designing an oxidation catalyst, by doping an oxide, one should aim for the middle ground: the dopant should make it easy to remove an oxygen atom, but not too easy."
[4] "We call this a moderation principle."

1.The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions by utilizing oxygen atoms from the surface of the oxide to oxidize the reductant, rather than adsorbed oxygen. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) is significant because it determines the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. If the energy is too low, it becomes difficult to reoxidize the surface with gas-phase oxygen, which is necessary for the catalytic cycle. Therefore, in designing an oxidation catalyst, the dopant should make it easy to remove an oxygen atom, but not too easy, following what is referred to as the moderation principle.

1.火星-范克雷维尔机制在氧化物催化氧化反应中通过利用氧化物表面的氧原子来氧化还原剂，而不是吸附的氧气。形成氧空位所需的能量（ΔEv）是重要的，因为它决定了氧化物表面的氧化能力。如果能量太低，就很难用气相氧气重新氧化表面，这是催化循环所必需的。因此，在设计氧化催化剂时，掺杂剂应该使去除氧原子变得容易，但不要太容易，这遵循所谓的适度原则。
