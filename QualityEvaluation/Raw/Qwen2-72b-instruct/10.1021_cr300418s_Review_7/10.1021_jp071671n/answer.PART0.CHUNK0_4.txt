[1] "A large fraction of the output of the chemical industry consists of products obtained by oxidation or oxidative dehydrogenation reactions catalyzed by oxides. 1-6 In most cases, the reaction proceeds through a Marsvan Krevelen mechanism. 7,8 The species to be oxidized reacts with the oxygen atoms at the surface of the oxide, creating oxygen vacancies. The reduced oxide is oxidized by reacting with gas-phase oxygen."
[2] "Because these calculations are very tedious, we have used the energy needed for forming an oxygen vacancy and half an oxygen molecule in the gas phase as a criterion for judging the oxidative power of a doped oxide."

1.The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions by the species to be oxidized reacting with the oxygen atoms at the surface of the oxide, creating oxygen vacancies. The reduced oxide is then oxidized by reacting with gas-phase oxygen. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) is used as a criterion for judging the oxidative power of a doped oxide.

1.马斯-范克雷维尔机制在氧化物催化的氧化反应中通过被氧化的物质与氧化物表面的氧原子反应，形成氧空位来运行。还原的氧化物通过与气相氧反应而被氧化。形成氧空位所需的能量（ΔEv）被用作判断掺杂氧化物氧化能力的标准。
