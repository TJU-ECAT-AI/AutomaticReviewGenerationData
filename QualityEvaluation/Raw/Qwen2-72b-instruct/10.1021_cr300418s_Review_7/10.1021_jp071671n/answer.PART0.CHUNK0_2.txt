[1] "A large fraction of the output of the chemical industry consists of products obtained by oxidation or oxidative dehydrogenation reactions catalyzed by oxides. 1-6 In most cases, the reaction proceeds through a Marsvan Krevelen mechanism. 7,8 The species to be oxidized reacts with the oxygen atoms at the surface of the oxide, creating oxygen vacancies. The reduced oxide is oxidized by reacting with gas-phase oxygen."
[2] "We use oxygen vacancy formation energy (OVFE) as a measure of how easily lattice oxygen may participate in the Mars and Van Krevelen mechanism for oxidation reactions."
[3] "We calculate with density functional theory how OVFE is affected when some of Zn atoms in ZnO(1010) surface layer are substituted by other metal dopants."
[4] "We find that Li, Na, K, Rb, Cs, Os, Rh, Ir, Ni, Pd, Pt, Cu, Ag, Au, and Cd decrease OVFE and prefer to be located at the surface of ZnO rather than in the bulk."
[5] "Mg, Ca, Sr, Ba, Sc, Y, La, Ti, Zr, Hf, Ce, V, Nb, Ta, Cr, Mo, W, Mn, Re, Fe, Ru, Co, Al, Ga, Sn, and Pb increase OVFE."
[6] "Most of the dopants that increase OVFE prefer to substitute Zn atoms in the bulk, except for Ca, Sr, Ba, La, Ce, Re, Fe, Ru, Co, Sn, and Pb, which prefer to substitute a Zn atom at the surface."

1.The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions by the reactant species interacting with oxygen atoms at the oxide surface, creating oxygen vacancies. The reduced oxide is then reoxidized by reacting with gas-phase oxygen. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) is used as a measure of how easily lattice oxygen can participate in this mechanism, indicating both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. By substituting some Zn atoms in the ZnO(1010) surface layer with other metal dopants, the ΔEv can be affected, with certain dopants decreasing it and others increasing it. Dopants that decrease ΔEv, such as Li, Na, K, Rb, Cs, Os, Rh, Ir, Ni, Pd, Pt, Cu, Ag, Au, and Cd, are more likely to be located at the surface of ZnO, enhancing its catalytic activity and oxidizing ability. Conversely, dopants that increase ΔEv, such as Mg, Ca, Sr, Ba, Sc, Y, La, Ti, Zr, Hf, Ce, V, Nb, Ta, Cr, Mo, W, Mn, Re, Fe, Ru, Co, Al, Ga, Sn, and Pb, may reduce the oxide's catalytic efficiency, with some of these dopants preferring to substitute Zn atoms at the surface.

1.马斯-范克雷维尔机制在氧化物催化氧化反应中通过反应物与氧化物表面的氧原子相互作用，形成氧空位来运作。还原的氧化物通过与气相氧反应重新氧化。形成氧空位所需的能量（ΔEv）被用作衡量晶格氧参与该机制容易程度的指标，指示氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力。通过在ZnO(1010)表面层中用其他金属掺杂剂替换一些Zn原子，可以影响ΔEv。某些掺杂剂如Li、Na、K、Rb、Cs、Os、Rh、Ir、Ni、Pd、Pt、Cu、Ag、Au和Cd会降低ΔEv，更可能位于ZnO的表面，增强其催化活性和氧化能力。相反，增加ΔEv的掺杂剂如Mg、Ca、Sr、Ba、Sc、Y、La、Ti、Zr、Hf、Ce、V、Nb、Ta、Cr、Mo、W、Mn、Re、Fe、Ru、Co、Al、Ga、Sn和Pb可能会降低氧化物的催化效率，其中一些掺杂剂更喜欢在表面替换Zn原子。
