          If a doped oxide is used as an oxidation catalyst by a Marsvan Krevelen mechanism, then one should seek a dopant that makes it easy to make oxygen vacancies, but not too easy. Informally, we call this a moderation principle. The point is that, if the oxygen is very easy to remove, then it is a very good oxidant, but not a good oxidation catalyst, since it is difficult to put the oxygen back.

          The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions involves the removal and replacement of oxygen from the oxide surface. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) is crucial as it determines the ease of oxygen removal and replacement, impacting both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. A moderate ΔEv is ideal, as it allows for efficient oxygen removal without making it too difficult to replenish the oxygen, which is essential for maintaining catalytic activity. The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions involves the removal and reinsertion of oxygen from the oxide surface. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) is crucial as it determines the ease of oxygen removal and reinsertion. A dopant that makes oxygen vacancy formation too easy results in a good oxidant but a poor catalyst, as the oxygen is hard to replace. A moderate ΔEv is preferred for effective catalysis.

The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) is crucial as it determines the ease of oxygen removal and reinsertion, impacting both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. A moderate ΔEv is ideal, as it ensures the oxide is reactive but also capable of regaining oxygen, maintaining its catalytic function.

          在氧化物催化的氧化反应中，Mars-van Krevelen机制涉及从氧化物表面移除和替换氧气。形成氧空位所需的能量(ΔEv)是关键的，因为它决定了氧气去除和替换的难易程度，影响氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力。适度的ΔEv是理想的，因为它允许有效去除氧气，同时不会使氧气的补充变得过于困难，这对维持催化活性至关重要。在氧化物催化的氧化反应中，Mars-van Krevelen机制涉及从氧化物表面移除和替换氧气。形成氧空位所需的能量(ΔEv)是关键的，因为它决定了氧气的移除和替换的难易程度。如果掺杂剂使氧空位形成过于容易，结果是一个好的氧化剂，但不是一个好的催化剂，因为氧气很难替换。为了有效的催化，需要一个适度的ΔEv。在氧化物催化的氧化反应中，Mars-van Krevelen机制涉及从氧化物表面移除和重新插入氧。形成氧空位所需的能量(ΔEv)是关键的，因为它决定了氧的去除和重新插入的难易程度，影响氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力。适度的ΔEv对于有效的催化剂是理想的，因为它允许氧的容易去除，同时不会使氧的重新插入变得过于困难，确保催化循环可以完成。在氧化物催化的氧化反应中，Mars-van Krevelen机制涉及从氧化物表面移除和重新插入氧。形成氧空位所需的能量(ΔEv)是关键的，因为它决定了氧的去除和重新插入的难易程度，影响氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力。适度的ΔEv是理想的，因为它确保氧化物具有反应性，同时也能够重新获得氧，保持其催化功能。
