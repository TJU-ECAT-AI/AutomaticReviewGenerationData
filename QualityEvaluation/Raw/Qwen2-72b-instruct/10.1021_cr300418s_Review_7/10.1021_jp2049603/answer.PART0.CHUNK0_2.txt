[1] "If a doped oxide is used as an oxidation catalyst by a Marsvan Krevelen mechanism, then one should seek a dopant that makes it easy to make oxygen vacancies, but not too easy. Informally, we call this a moderation principle. The point is that, if the oxygen is very easy to remove, then it is a very good oxidant, but not a good oxidation catalyst, since it is difficult to put the oxygen back."

1.The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions involves the removal and reinsertion of oxygen from the oxide surface. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) is crucial as it determines the ease of oxygen removal and reinsertion, impacting both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. A moderate ΔEv is ideal for an effective catalyst, as it allows for facile oxygen removal without making it too difficult to reinsert oxygen, ensuring the catalytic cycle can be completed.

1.在氧化物催化的氧化反应中，Mars-van Krevelen机制涉及从氧化物表面移除和重新插入氧。形成氧空位所需的能量(ΔEv)是关键的，因为它决定了氧的去除和重新插入的难易程度，影响氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力。适度的ΔEv对于有效的催化剂是理想的，因为它允许氧的容易去除，同时不会使氧的重新插入变得过于困难，确保催化循环可以完成。
