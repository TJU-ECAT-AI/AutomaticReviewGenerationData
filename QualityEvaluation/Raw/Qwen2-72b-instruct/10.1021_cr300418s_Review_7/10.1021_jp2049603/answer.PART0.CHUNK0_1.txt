[1] "If a doped oxide is used as an oxidation catalyst by a Marsvan Krevelen mechanism, then one should seek a dopant that makes it easy to make oxygen vacancies, but not too easy. Informally, we call this a moderation principle. The point is that, if the oxygen is very easy to remove, then it is a very good oxidant, but not a good oxidation catalyst, since it is difficult to put the oxygen back."

1.The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions involves the removal and replacement of oxygen from the oxide surface. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) is crucial as it determines the ease of oxygen removal and replacement. A dopant that makes oxygen vacancy formation too easy results in a good oxidant but a poor catalyst, as the oxygen is hard to replace. A moderate ΔEv is preferred for effective catalysis.

1.在氧化物催化的氧化反应中，Mars-van Krevelen机制涉及从氧化物表面移除和替换氧气。形成氧空位所需的能量(ΔEv)是关键的，因为它决定了氧气的移除和替换的难易程度。如果掺杂剂使氧空位形成过于容易，结果是一个好的氧化剂，但不是一个好的催化剂，因为氧气很难替换。为了有效的催化，需要一个适度的ΔEv。
