Accumulative acid post-treatments were performed on FeMFI and a gradual increase of maximal propylene yield to ca. 25% could be observed. The FeMFI samples before and after acid post-treatments were characterized by means of ICP, XRD, DRIFT, TEM, UV-Vis, H2-TPR, NH3-TPD and EPR. The results clearly indicated the transformation of iron species during acid post-treatments. The active iron species in FeMFI before and after acid post-treatments were characterized by FTIR spectra of NO adsorption. Based on the characterization and catalytic results, the extra-framework FeOAl species and/or isolated iron species in FeMFI were proposed to be more active than oligonuclear iron species for propane dehydrogenation with nitrous oxide.
1. Introduction
Light olefins are very important components for the petrochemical industry and the market demand for light olefins has been growing steadily in recent years. The oxidative dehydrogenation of light paraffins provides a promising route to produce light olefins. In the past decades, the oxidative dehydrogenation of light paraffins to olefins, especially propane to propylene, has been extensively studied. Supported transition metal oxides, e.g. molybdenum oxides1 and vanadium oxides,2 are representative catalysts for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane with dioxygen, and propylene yield of up to 30% can be obtained.
For the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane with dioxygen,extensive COx is formed as over-oxidation by-product even at moderate propane conversion, and therefore low propylene selectivity and propylene yield are usually observed.
Nitrous oxide is an alternative promising oxidant especially when iron modified zeolites, i.e. ironzeolites, are employed as catalysts. In general, nitrous oxide easily chemisorbs on the iron sites in zeolites, accompanied by the liberation of dinitrogen and the deposition of oxygen species.3 The deposited oxygen species is highly active and can be used in several oxidation processes, e.g. benzene hydroxylation to phenol47 and partial oxidation of methane to oxygenate.810 In particular, it has been reported that the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) with nitrous oxide can be realized on ironzeolite catalysts.1114 Several researches have been performed on the ODHP with nitrous oxide catalyzed by ironzeolites, and the best results obtained are comparable with the ODHP with dioxygen catalyzed by transition metal oxides.1119 The use of nitrous oxide instead of dioxygen as oxidant in ODHP reaction distinctly decreases the required operation temperatures and improves the selectivity toward propylene. Moreover, nitrous oxide is a kind of harmful gas with strong greenhouse effect, and therefore the utilization of nitrous oxide from industrial emissions as raw reactant does make sense from an environmental point of view.
For the ODHP to propylene with nitrous oxide catalyzed by ironzeolites, it is most important to know the active sites and the structure-activity relationship. The established knowledge on the active iron sites in ODHP reaction makes it possible to rationally design of highly active ironzeolite catalysts.
However, ironzeolites are known to be complicated systems and many factors, e.g. the zeolite hosts employed and the preparation procedure, may strongly influence the nature and distribution of iron sites. The identification of specific iron sites in ironzeolites and their role in the oxidative dehydro- genation of propane is therefore challenging. Notably, there are some puzzling disagreements on the active iron sites for the Key Laboratory of Advanced Energy Materials Chemistry (Ministry of Education), College of Chemistry, Nankai University, Tianjin 300071, P. R. China.

Technol., 2013, 3, 1333--1342 This journal is c The Royal Society of Chemistry 2013 ODHP with nitrous oxide. Bula nek et al.12 claimed that the catalytic activity of FeZSM-5 in the ODHP with nitrous oxide could be ascribed to the presence of extra-framework Feoxo complexes, similar to that reported by Panov et al.3 in benzene hydroxylation with nitrous oxide. While Kondratenko et al.14 proposed that oligonuclear iron species in FeZSM-5 was more active than isolated iron species for the ODHP with nitrous oxide, probably due to the higher mobility of atomic oxygen species attached to oligonuclear iron species formed upon nitrous oxide chemisorption. Pe rez-Ram rez et al.15 suggested that traces of well-isolated iron species in FeZSM-5 was extremely active in the ODHP with nitrous oxide, while large iron clusters enhanced the deep oxidation of important reaction inter- mediates to COx. Based on the literature reports, MFI is the most suitable zeolite host for iron species, and isomorphous substitution followed by high temperature steam-activation is the recommended route to prepare highly active FeMFI catalyst.1216 While other preparation routes, e.g. solution ion exchange and chemical vapor deposition, probably lead to low activity and selectivity.15 In the present study, solution ion-exchange is employed as a simple and feasible means to prepare ironzeolite for the ODHP with nitrous oxide. Accumulative acid post-treatments are performed on the as-prepared FeMFI to enhance the catalytic activity. The trans- formation of iron species in FeMFI during acid treatments is carefully characterized and the hints on the structure-activity relationship in the ODHP with nitrous oxide will be focused on.
2. Experimental section
2.1
Catalyst preparation A series of aluminosilicate zeolites in H-Form with different framework structure were provided by Sinopec and employed as hosts for iron species. Prior to be used as hosts, the zeolite samples were heated to 873 K at a rate of 5 K min1 and then calcined at 873 K in flowing air for 6 h. Fezeolite samples were prepared via liquid-phase ion exchange with ferrous salt. In a typical experi- ment, zeolite sample of 1 g was placed in the three-necked flask and exchanged with 100 mL of 0.1 M FeCl2 aqueous solution for 24 h at room temperature under the protection of flowing nitrogen at 50 mL min1. The resulting solid was thoroughly washed with deionized water, dried at 353 K overnight, heated to 873 K at 5 K min1 and calcined in flowing air at 873 K for 6 h. FeMFI sample was further subjected to acid post-treatment. For each acid treatment, sample of 1 g was treated with 100 mL of 0.01 M HCl solution at room temperature for 2 h. The resulting solid was thoroughly washed with deionized water, dried at 353 K overnight,heated to 873 K at 5 K min1 and calcined in flowing air at 873 K for 6 h. The product was denoted as FeMFI-tn, where n indicated the accumulative times for the acid treatment.
2.2
Catalyst characterization The Si, Al and Fe contents in samples were analyzed by a Perkin Elmer Optima 2000 inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometer (ICP-OES). The specific surface areas of samples were determined through low temperature N2 adsorption desorption isotherms collected on a Quantachrome iQ-MP gas absorption analyzer. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of samples were recorded on a Bruker D8 ADVANCE powder diffractometer using Cu-Ka radiation (l = 0.1542 nm) at a scanning rate of 41 min1 in the region of 2y = 5401. Trans- mission electron microscopy (TEM) images were taken on a Philips Tecnai G2 20 S-TWIN electron microscope at an acceleration voltage of 200 kV. A few drops of alcohol suspension containing the sample were placed on a carbon-coated copper grid, followed by evaporation at ambient temperature. Diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform (DRIFT) spectra of samples were measured on a Bruker Tensor 27 spectrometer with 128 scans at a resolution of 2 cm1. A self-supporting pellet made of sample was placed in the reaction chamber (Praying Mantis CHC-CHA-3) and pretreated in flowing dry air at 473 K for 1 h. The spectra were recorded in dry air against KBr as background. The 27Al solid-state magic angle spinning nuclear magnetic resonance (MAS-NMR) experiments were performed on a Bruker Avance III spectrometer at resonance frequencies of 104.3 MHz and with a sample spinning rate of 8 kHz. Diffuse reflectance ultraviolet-visible (UV-Vis) spectra of samples were recorded in the air against BaSO4 in the region of 200800 nm on a Varian Cary 300 UV-Vis spectrophotometer.
To reduce light absorption, samples were diluted with BaSO4 at a ratio of 1/4. The temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) experiments were carried out on a Quantachrome ChemBET 3000 chemisorption analyzer. Sample of ca. 0.1 g was pretreated in flowing He at 873 K for 1 h, cooled to 373 K in He and saturated with 5% NH3/He. After that, the sample was purged with He for 30 min to eliminate the physisorbed ammonia. NH3-TPD was then carried out in flowing He in the temperature range of 373873 K at a heating rate of 10 K min1. The temperature-programmed reduction (TPR) experiments were carried out on a Quantachrome ChemBET 3000 chemisorption analyzer. Sample of ca. 0.1 g was pretreated in flowing oxygen at 873 K for 1 h, cooled to 323 K under same atmosphere and purged with 5% H2/Ar for 30 min. H2-TPR was then carried out in flowing 5% H2/Ar in the temperature range of 323923 K at a heating rate of 10 K min1. The response of the TCD to H2 was calibrated by performing a TPR of CuO standard sample.
Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectra in the X-band region were recorded with a Bruker EMX-6/1 spectrometer at 120 K with a microwave power of 5.0 mW and a modulation frequency of 100 kHz. 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl hydrate (DPPH) was used as an internal standard for the measurement of the magnetic field.
FTIR spectra with NO as probe were collected on a Bruker Tensor 27 spectrometer with 128 scans at a resolution of 2 cm1. A self- supporting pellet made of the catalyst sample was placed in the reaction chamber (Praying Mantis CHC-CHA-3) and pretreated in flowing He at 773 K for 1 h. After cooling to room temperature in flowing He, the He stream was switched to 1% NO/He and a series of time-dependent FTIR spectra were sequentially recorded.
2.3
Catalytic evaluation The catalytic evaluation was performed in a fixed-bed flow micro-reactor at atmospheric pressure. Typically, 200 mg catalyst sample (sieve fraction of 0.170.25 mm) was placed in a quartz reactor (4 mm i.d.) and pretreated in 15% N2O/He at Paper Catalysis Science & Technology Downloaded by University of Missouri at Columbia on 08/05/2013 17:44:45.

After cooling to designed temperature, the reactant gas mixture (7.5% C3H8, 15% N2O, and balance He) was fed to the reactor at a total flow rate of 50 mL min1,corresponding to a gas hourly space velocity (GHSV) of 15000 h1.
The steady-state tests were conducted isothermally at designed temperature and the gas products were analyzed after 15-min reaction by using two on-line gas chromatographs. One of them was equipped with a Plot Q capillary column and a FID detector for the analysis of organic products, the other with two packed columns (Porapak Q and Carbon Molecular Sieve TDX) and a TCD detector for the analysis of N2O, N2, O2 and COx.
3. Results
3.1
Physico-chemical properties of Fezeolites The ion exchange result and the physicochemical properties of FeMFI are summarized in Table 1. Theoretically, full ion exchange of zeolite by ferrous salt should give a Fe/Al ratio of
0.5. In the present work, extra-framework iron species can be
introduced to the MFI host with Fe/Al ratios of 0.22 through primary solution ion exchange with ferrous salt. Further acid post-treatments on FeMFI result in the increase in Si/Al ratios and slight decrease in Fe loadings. These should be explained by the dealumination and leaching during acid post-treatments.
Nevertheless, the Fe/Al ratios are kept at the similar level for FeMFI and acid treated FeMFI. It should be mentioned that chlorine is completely removed by thorough washing and subsequent calcination, and therefore no residual chlorine can be detected for all samples.
The powder XRD patterns of FeMFI samples employed in this study are shown in Fig. 1. Typical diffraction lines corre- sponding to MFI host are observed in FeMFI sample,20 indicating that the framework structure of MFI host is well preserved after ion exchange and subsequent calcination. Besides, no obvious diffrac- tion lines corresponding to iron species can be observed, probably due to the low Fe loadings. It is also clearly seen that the framework of MFI is well preserved for FeMFI even after accumulative acid post-treatments.
Fig. 2 displays the hydroxyl stretching region of DRIFT spectra of HMFI and FeMFI samples. For HMFI, a strong band at 3605 cm1 corresponding to Brnsted acid hydroxyl groups, together with a weak band at 3740 cm1 corresponding to silanol groups and a weak band at 3700 cm1 corresponding to hydroxyl groups bounded to Lewis acid sites, can be observed.21,22 With the introduction of iron species by ion exchange, the intensity of IR band corresponding to Brnsted acid hydroxyl groups decreases distinctly, while the intensities of IR bands corresponding to other hydroxyl groups are kept nearly unchanged. It is indicated that a large proportion of protons in Brnsted acid hydroxyl groups are replaced by cationic iron species. Acid post-treatments on FeMFI lead to the appearance of a new IR band at 3655 cm1 corresponding to hydroxyl groups on extra-framework aluminum species23 and the intensity of this IR band gradually increases with accumulative acid post-treatments. Obviously, acid post-treatments on FeMFI result in dealumination in the MFI framework.
The acidic properties of HMFI and FeMFI are evaluated by NH3-TPD and the results are shown in Fig. 3. For HMFI, two major types of ammonia desorption peaks can be observed: the low-temperature peak centered at around 500 K corresponding to weak acid sites and high-temperature peak centered at around 700 K corresponding to strong acid sites. The high- temperature peak can be attributed to the desorption of NH3 strongly interacting with the Brnsted acid sites in the specific case of FeMFI based on literature reports.2426 The introduction of iron species to HMFI by ion exchange results in a distinct decrease in the amount of Brnsted acid sites due to the Table 1 Physicochemical properties of FeMFI samples under study Fezeolite Zeolite host Si/Ala Fe (%) Fe/Ala SBET (m2 g1) FeMFI

Technol., 2013, 3, 1333--1342 This journal is c The Royal Society of Chemistry 2013 replacement of protons in Brnsted acid hydroxyl groups by cationic iron species, in consistency with the FTIR spectra in Fig. 2. It can also be noted that the amount of Brnsted acid sites in FeMFI gradually decreases with accumulative acid post-treatments, which should be ascribed to the continuous dealumination in the MFI framework.
The 27Al MAS-NMR spectra of FeMFI samples before and after acid treatments are shown in Fig. 4. For FeMFI, a strong signal at ca. 55 ppm corresponding to tetrahedrally coordinated aluminum at non-equivalent framework positions and a very weak signal at ca. 0 ppm corresponding to octahedrally coordi- nated extra-framework aluminum species27 can be observed.
Accumulative acid post-treatments on FeMFI result in a slight increase in the intensity of the NMR signal at ca. 0 ppm,indicating the dealumination upon acid treatments. Based on the results from DRIFT spectra in the hydroxyl stretching region (Fig. 2), NH3-TPD (Fig. 3),27Al MAS-NMR spectra (Fig. 4) and ICP analysis (Table 1), the framework dealumination of FeMFI upon acid post-treatments can be unambiguously confirmed. Some of the aluminum species removed from the framework leach to the liquid phase during acid treatments as proved by the increasing Si/Al ratios in Table 1, while others exist in the form of extra-framework species in FeMFI as proved by 27Al MAS-NMR spectra in Fig. 4.
TEM analysis is employed to give a direct view on the formation of iron-related phase in FeMFI and acid treated FeMFI samples. In the TEM image of FeMFI in Fig. 5,nanoparticles with sizes of 26 nm are observed to disperse on the surface of MFI zeolite. These nanoparticles should consist of iron oxides that are formed during ion exchange and the subsequent calcination process. In the TEM image of FeMFI-tn, more nanoparticles with the larger sizes of 310 nm can be observed. The first impression is that serious aggregation of iron oxide nanoparticles occurs during acid post-treatment and calcination. A reasonable explanation is that dealumination in the MFI framework occurs during acid post-treatments on FeMFI and the presence of extra-framework aluminum species may induce the epitaxial growth of the iron oxides, as suggested by Prins et al.28
3.2
Characterization of iron sites in FeMFI The H2-TPR profiles of FeMFI samples are shown in Fig. 6 and the existence of reducible iron species is revealed in some cases. According to the literature reports,29,30 the peaks of H2 consumption below 750 K correspond to the reduction of ferric ions to ferrous ions in isolated state, oligonuclear clusters and nanoparticles with a H/Fe ratio of 1, and the peaks of H2 consumption at 7501000 K correspond to the reduction of ferrous ions to metallic iron in nanoparticles species with a H/Fe ratio of 2.

For FeMFI, broad H2 consumption peaks from 500 to 1000 K with total H/Fe ratio of
2.1 are observed, indicating the existence of various iron sites,
e.g. isolated ferric ions/oligonuclear clusters and nanoparticles.
Through acid treatment, the intensities of H2 consumption peaks below 750 K decrease, while the intensities of H2 consumption peaks at 7501000 K increase. The total H/Fe ratio increases distinctly from 2.1 to 2.7, indicating the formation of more nanoparticles through acid treatment. Moreover, accumulative acid post-treatments do not lead to obvious changes in the TPR profiles and H/Fe ratios of 2.42.7 are obtained.
UV-Vis spectroscopy is a common technique for the char- acterization of iron sites in Fezeolite and the O - Fe ligand to metal charge transfer transitions can give useful information on the coordination states and aggregation extent of iron species. The UV-Vis spectra of FeMFI samples before and after acid treatments are shown in Fig. 7. It is seen that all FeMFI samples exhibit strong absorbance in 200700 nm, revealing the existence of various ferric ions. Specifically, the UV bands at below 300 nm are assigned to isolated ferric ions in tetrahedral coordination (at 215 and 245 nm) or isolated ferric ions in octahedral coordination (at 275 nm).31,32 The UV bands at below 300 nm can also arise from ferric ion dimers when Fezeolite samples are hydrated and the antiferromagnetic coupling is weak.33 The UV bands between 300 and 400 nm are assigned to octahedral ferric ions in oligonuclear FexOy clusters, while the UV bands at above 400 nm are due to the formation of large Fe2O3 nanoparticles.34 Despite the existing controversies on the assignments of UV-Vis subbands, it is quite clear that ferric ions with different nuclearity, e.g. isolated ions,oligonuclear clusters and Fe2O3 nanoparticles,are obtained after ion exchange and subsequent calcination.
Through acid post-treatments, the percentage of Fe2O3 nano- particles increases to some extent, in great consistent with TEM observations. However, no obvious differences can be observed on FeMFI after acid treatments for different times.
The EPR spectra of FeMFI samples before and after acid treatments are shown in Fig. 8. For calcined FeMFI, EPR signals at g0 = 2.0 and g0 = 4.3 can be observed. The g0 =
2.0 EPR signal should be originated from highly symmetric
isolated ferric ions and/or small oligomers with weak dipolar coupling, while the g0 = 4.3 signal should be originated from the ferric ions in tetrahedral coordination.35,36 Through acid post-treatments, the intensity of g0 = 2.0 EPR signal decreases,while the intensity of g0 = 4.3 EPR signal increases. Further accumulative acid post-treatments result in the appearance of g0 = 5.6 and g0 = 6.4 EPR signals, which should be assigned to isolated ferric ions in higher coordination, i.e. with five or six neighboring oxygen ions.36 Obviously, the iron sites in FeMFI undergo transformation during acid post-treatments and sub- sequent calcination. The EPR spectra of uncalcined FeMFI samples (dried at 353 K) are also shown in Fig. 8. For FeMFI prepared by ion exchange with ferrous salt, ferrous ions should be the initial iron species introduced to MFI host. EPR signals corresponding to various ferric ions are observed on uncalcined Fig. 6 H2-TPR profiles of FeMFI samples before and after acid post-treatments.

Technol., 2013, 3, 1333--1342 This journal is c The Royal Society of Chemistry 2013 FeMFI samples due to the oxidation of ferrous ions to ferric ions during the drying process. Moreover, the observed EPR signals on uncalcined samples are quite similar with those on calcined samples, indicating that the transformation of iron species occurs mainly during the acid post-treatment step instead of subsequent calcination step.
According to the commonly adopted model, three different extra-framework sites for isolated metal ions can be identified in zeolite MFI: a site in the straight channels, b site in the intersection between straight and sinusoidal channels and boat-shape g site in the sinusoidal channels.37,38 Further researches of Bru ckner et al. have correlated the different EPR signals to the different sites located in ion exchanged FeZSM-5 based on the characteristic redox behavior of iron species.36 Particularly, the g0 = 4.3 EPR signal is attributed to the g sites in the sinusoidal channels, the g0 = 5.6 and g0 = 6.4 EPR signals to the b sites in the intersection between straight and sinusoidal channels, and the g0 = 2.0 EPR signal to the a site in the straight channels as well as small oligomers in the straight channels of ZSM-5 structure. In the present study, we would like to follow the conclusions and the EPR results indicate the migration of iron species in the channels of ZSM-5 during acid post-treatments,i.e. from the straight channels to the sinusoidal channels.
FTIR spectroscopy with NO probe is an informative and sensitive technique for the characterization of iron sites in zeolite.3942 The characteristic of this technique lies in that only exposed iron sites can be explored, while iron sites in sub-surface position or buried inside cannot be detected. Thus,it can provide us with necessary information on the available or so-called working iron sites in catalytic reactions. It should also be mentioned that the adsorption of NO on oxidized ferric ions is negligible at room temperature, and nitrosyls are formed exclusively with the participation of ferrous ions.39 Therefore,the FeMFI samples employed for FTIR analysis in this study are pre-treated at elevated temperature under inert atmosphere to induce the auto-reduction of ferric ions to ferrous ions.24,43 Fig. 9 shows the FTIR spectra of FeMFI samples in flowing He after exposure to 1% NO for 10 min at room temperature.
NO adsorption on FeMFI results in a broad band centered at 1840 cm1. Through acid post-treatments, the broad band at 1840 cm1 shifts slightly to higher wavenumbers, and two new IR bands at 1875 and 1880 cm1 appear. According to literature reports, the band at 1875 cm1 is assigned to mono-nitrosyl on extra-framework Fe2+OAl species,42,44 while the band at 1880 cm1 is assigned to mono-nitrosyl on isolated ferrous ions located at the g sites of ZSM-5 structure.45,46 The IR bands at around 1850 cm1 should be originated from mono-nitrosyl on ferrous ions, while the location of specific site is a matter of debate. Joyner et al.47 assigned the band at 1841 cm1 to mono- nitrosyl on isolated ferrous ions, and Lezcano et al.48 further assigned the band at 1838 cm1 to mono-nitrosyl on isolated ferrous ions located at the a sites of ZSM-5. Mul et al.42 assigned the IR band at 1853 cm1 to mono-nitrosyl on ferrous ions in oligonuclear clusters probably in the straight channels of ZSM-5. For FeZSM-5 prepared by aqueous-phase ion exchange,the straight channels of ZSM-5 zeolite favor the diffusion of iron precursor and the formation of clusters is unavoidable during the calcination step. Therefore, we prefer to assign the band at 1840 cm1 to mono-nitrosyl on ferrous ions in oligo- nuclear clusters in the straight channels of ZSM-5 zeolite. The shifts of 1840 cm1 band to higher wavenumbers should be ascribed to the changes in the environment and nuclearity of oligonuclear clusters through acid post-treatments. Based on the FTIR spectra with NO adsorption, it is evident that iron species in FeMFI undergo auto-reduction, i.e. ferric ions to ferrous ions, upon high-temperature treatment under inert atmosphere. It should be mentioned that not all ferric ions can be auto-reduced to ferrous ions and some inert ferric ions,probably those strongly interact with zeolite framework, can remain in their ferric form after high-temperature treatment under inert atmosphere. Since the activation of nitrous oxide is facilitated on ferrous ions,49,50 the inert ferric ions, i.e. those cannot be auto-reduced at elevated temperature, will not play a major role in N2O-involved reaction. Acid post-treatments on FeMFI samples result in the dealumination in ZSM-5 frame- work and lead to the formation of extra-framework FeOAl species. Moreover, the detectable ferrous ions migrate from the straight channels to the sinusoidal channels during acid post- treatments, in consistent with the migration of iron species revealed by EPR spectra.
3.3
Catalytic performances of Fezeolites Fezeolites with similar Si/Al ratios and different framework structures are studied as possible catalysts for the ODHP with nitrous oxide. FeFER and FeMOR exhibit quite low activity for the ODHP with nitrous oxide, while FeBEA, FeFAU and FeMFI exhibit significant ODHP activity (Fig. S2, ESI).
Undoubtedly, the framework structure of Fezeolite plays a decisive role in the catalytic activity. FeMFI appears to be more promising catalyst for the ODHP with nitrous oxide and a maximal propylene yield of ca. 14% can be obtained at 673 K.
The major by-products from ODHP with nitrous oxide are CO and CO2, while trace acrolein and some other oxygenates can be also detected.

Technol., 2013, 3, 1333--1342 1339 Fig. 10 displays the ODHP with nitrous oxide catalyzed by FeMFI samples before and after acid post-treatments. For FeMFI, the propane conversion increases while the propylene selectivity decreases with increasing reaction temperature from 573 to 773 K, resulting in a volcano plot of propylene yield with a maximum at 673 K. Meanwhile, the nitrous oxide conversion increases from 0 to 100% with increasing reaction temperature.
Acid post-treatments on FeMFI enhance both the propane conversion and the propylene selectivity to some extent,and therefore, promote the ODHP with nitrous oxide. The promotion effects are more obvious with accumulative acid post-treatments up to six times and further acid post-treatments do not contribute to the propylene production. Typically, the maximal propylene yield increases from ca. 12% over FeMFI to ca. 25% over FeMFI-t6 and FeMFI-t8. It should be mentioned that the propylene yield of ca. 25% obtained in the present work are comparable with the best results reported for ironzeolite catalysts under similar conditions.1315,26 Fig. 11 displays the results of nitrous oxide decomposition over FeMFI samples before and after acid post-treatments. For FeMFI, nitrous oxide decomposition starts at 698 K and then the nitrous oxide conversion increases with increasing reaction temperature. Accumulative acid post-treatments on FeMFI show mild positive effects on the activity for nitrous oxide decomposition and the nitrous oxide conversion at 773 K increases from ca. 35% of FeMFI to ca. 55% of FeMFI-t8.
However, the nitrous oxide conversion is very low (o2%) at 673 K,the temperature when maximal propylene yield is obtained in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane with nitrous oxide. It is thus indicated that the presence of propane in the reaction system greatly improves the conversion of nitrous oxide catalyzed by FeMFI.
The deactivation and regeneration of FeMFI-t8 catalyst in the ODHP with nitrous oxide are further investigated. As shown in Fig. 12, FeMFI-t8 suffers from severe deactivation during the progress of reaction and the propylene yield decreases from ca. 26% to ca. 12% within time-on-stream of 240 min. Based on the literature reports, the deactivation of Fezeolites in the ODHP with nitrous oxide should be caused by the formation of coke on the surface of catalysts.17,18 In our experiment, coke with weight content of ca. 9.5% is observe to accumulate on FeMFI-t8 after ODHP reaction for 240 min. Thereupon, coke- burning regeneration is performed on the deactivated catalyst by calcination in 15% N2O at 773 K for 120 min. After regen- eration, the activity of FeMFI-t8 catalyst in the ODHP with nitrous oxide can fully recover to the initial level. Moreover, the regenerated catalyst exhibits similar deactivation behavior to the fresh catalyst, indicating the good regeneration property of FeMFI-t8.

4. Discussion
4.1
Transformation of iron species in FeMFI during acid post-treatment Through solution ion exchange with ferrous salt, extra-framework iron species can be introduced to the zeolite host. Based on the characterization results from H2-TPR (Fig. 6), UV-Vis (Fig. 7) and EPR (Fig. 8), ferric ions with different nuclearity, e.g. isolated ions,oligonuclear clusters and Fe2O3 nanoparticles, are obtained after ion exchange and subsequent calcination. The ion exchange results obtained here are consistent with literature reports on FeMFI prepared via similar route.34,36 In the present study, acid post- treatments are performed on FeMFI to induce the framework dealumination and the corresponding changes in the iron site constitution in FeMFI. As expected, post-treatments in diluted acid solution show significant impacts on the properties of FeMFI sample. Although the framework structure of MFI zeolite is well preserved after acid post-treatment (ref. XRD patterns in Fig. 1), the dealumination in MFI framework occurs and the Si/Al ratio increases slightly (Table 1). The framework dealumination leads to significant decrease in Brnsted acid sites (ref. the DRIFT spectra in Fig. 2) and the increase in the extra-framework aluminum species (27Al MAS-NMR in Fig. 4). The reduction of strong acid sites (NH3-TPD profiles in Fig. 3) is beneficial to reduce the further reaction of propylene and therefore enhance the selectivity to propylene in ODHP (Fig. 10), in consistence with the results reported by Ates et al.26 Accompanied by the dealumination process, the leaching of iron species during acid post-treatment is evident, as indicated by the decreases in iron loadings (Table 1).
On the one hand, the leached iron species, together with leached aluminum species, may adsorb on the iron oxides at the outer surface of MFI and induce the epitaxial growth of the iron oxides.
This results in the formation of more and larger iron oxide nanoparticles, as revealed by the TEM images in Fig. 5 and UV-Vis spectra in Fig. 7. On the other hand, the leached iron species may act as iron source and re-exchange process takes place inside the MFI channels during acid post-treatment. This results in the migration of iron species from the straight channels to the sinusoidal channels in MFI, as revealed by the EPR spectra in Fig. 8.
Based on the data presented in Table 1, accumulative acid post- treatments up to six times lead to the more significant leaching of iron and aluminum species, as well as the continuous migration of iron species from the straight channels to the sinusoidal channels in MFI (Fig. 8). Meanwhile, the iron oxides nanoparticles do not show obvious changes with the progress of accumulative acid post-treatment.
4.2
Active iron sites for propane dehydrogenation with nitrous oxide The exposed iron sites in FeMFI are probed by FTIR spectra of NO adsorption and nitrosyls on auto-reduced ferrous ions are employed for the titration of iron sites. As shown in Fig. 8, the ferrous ions in oligonuclear clusters change slightly, while the formation of extra-framework Fe2+OAl species and isolated ferrous ions located at the g sites of ZSM-5 structure are quite evident during accumulative acid post-treatments. It has been reported that oligonuclear iron species are preferred over isolated iron species for nitrous oxide decomposition due to the easier oxygen combination.51,52 In the present study, similar nitrous oxide decomposition activities are obtained for FeMFI before and after acid post-treatments (Fig. 11), indicating that oligonuclear iron species plays a major role in nitrous oxide decomposition. It should be noted that the direct decomposition of nitrous oxide takes place at above 673 K (Fig. 11), while significant nitrous oxide conversion can be observed in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane with nitrous oxide at below 673 K (Fig. 10). The equimolar reaction between nitrous oxide and propane is the desired pathway for the ODHP (N2O + C3H8 - C3H6 + N2 + H2O). This reaction contains two steps:(1) the chemisorption of nitrous oxide and (2) the removal of deposited oxygen by propane (* indicates the active site).
N2O + * - N2 + *O
(1)
*O + C3H8 - C3H6 + H2O + *
(2) Since nitrous oxide easily chemisorbs on iron sites in iron zeolites, the reactivity of deposited oxygen toward propane determines the dehydrogenation activity. Based on the correla- tion between the exposed iron sites in FeMFI characterized by FTIR spectra of NO adsorption (Fig. 9) and the ODHP activity (Fig. 10), we believe that extra-framework FeOAl species and/ or isolated iron species in the sinusoidal channels of MFI are more active species than oligonuclear iron species for ODHP with nitrous oxide. Unfortunately, current experiment data cannot give us exact information on either extra-framework FeOAl species or isolated iron species in the sinusoidal channels of MFI is more important for the reaction. However,since steam activated FeZSM-5 is more active than steam activated Fesilicalite in the ODHP with nitrous oxide,1417 it is reasonable to suppose that extra-framework FeOAl species plays an essential role in the reaction. Therefore, it is instruc- tive to drive iron species at framework positions or cation sites to extra-framework FeOAl species in order to obtain highly active ironzeolite catalyst for the ODHP with nitrous oxide.
5. Conclusion
FeMFI prepared by reductive solution ion-exchange is active catalyst for the ODHP with nitrous oxide and maximal propylene yield of ca. 14% can be obtained at 673 K. Acid post- treatments on FeMFI show distinct positive effects on the activity in the ODHP with nitrous oxide. Typically, the maximal propylene yield gradually increases to ca. 25% with accumula- tive acid post-treatments.
Characterization results reveal that ferric ions with different nuclearity, e.g. isolated ions, oligonuclear clusters and Fe2O3 nanoparticles, are formed in FeMFI after reductive solution ion-exchange and subsequent calcination. Acid post-treatments on FeMFI show significant impacts on the properties of FeMFI sample. The leaching of iron and aluminum species is clearly observed during acid post-treatments.

The exposed iron sites in FeMFI are probed by FTIR spectra of NO adsorption. The oligonuclear iron species the straight channels is detected in FeMFI, while acid post-treatments result in the appearance of extra-framework FeOAl species and isolated iron species in the sinusoidal channels. Based on the correlation between the exposed iron sites and the dehydrogenation activity, we propose that extra-framework FeOAl species and/or isolated iron species are more active species than oligonuclear iron species for propane dehydro- genation with nitrous oxide.
