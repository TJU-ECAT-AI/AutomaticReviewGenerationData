1.The literature does not provide specific information on how various synthesis methods of iron-containing ZSM-5 zeolites influence their catalytic performance in the N2O-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reaction. However, it does mention that the preparation method (ion-exchange and steam activation) and the framework composition (FeAlSi, FeGaSi, and FeGeSi) can induce different iron speciation and acidic properties in the zeolites, which in turn affect their catalytic performance. The key performance metrics that demonstrate the effectiveness of the zeolites under different reaction conditions include the initial propylene yield, the rate of deactivation, and the amount of coke formed. Steam-activated Fe-ZSM-5 with FeGaSi framework has been reported to display the highest initial propylene yield and the slowest deactivation rate among the zeolites studied.

1.文献没有提供铁掺杂ZSM-5沸石的各种合成方法如何影响它们在N2O辅助丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)反应中的催化性能的具体信息。但是，它确实提到制备方法（离子交换和蒸汽活化）和骨架组成（FeAlSi、FeGaSi和FeGeSi）可以在沸石中诱导不同的铁物种和酸性性质，这反过来又影响它们的催化性能。在不同的反应条件下证明沸石有效性的关键性能指标包括初始丙烯产量、失活速率和形成的焦炭量。据报道，具有FeGaSi骨架的蒸汽活化Fe-ZSM-5在研究的沸石中具有最高的初始丙烯产量和最慢的失活速率。
