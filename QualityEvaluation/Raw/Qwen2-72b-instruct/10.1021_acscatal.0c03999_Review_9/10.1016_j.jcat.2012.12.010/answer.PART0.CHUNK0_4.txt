[1] "The steamed Fe(H)-ZSM-5st zeolites were greatly reorganized, resulting in a low concentration of both the Brnsted sites and bare Fe(II) ions, and the Td-coordinated Fe(III) ions in the FeAAlASi extra-framework species (4347%) and Fe-oxide-like particles (3033%) prevailed."
[2] "The redox state of Fe in both non-steamed and steamed Fe-ZSM-5 was strongly influenced by the reaction conditions of N2O decomposition and C3H8/N2O."
[3] "Bare counter Fe(III)-oxo species easily reducible to Fe(II) is critical for high activity in N2O decomposition, whereas high yield of propene in C3H8/N2O is achieved regardless of population of the individual dispersed Fe species."
[4] "The low concentration of protonic sites and small crystallites of zeolites, not supporting propene oligomerization, accumulation of polyolefins in the pores and their easy oxidation to CO/CO2, are necessary conditions for selective oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propene over Fe-ZSM-5."

1.Steaming of Fe-ZSM-5 zeolites results in a low concentration of Brnsted sites and bare Fe(II) ions, while Td-coordinated Fe(III) ions in extra-framework species and Fe-oxide-like particles prevail. The redox state of Fe is influenced by the reaction conditions. High activity in N2O decomposition requires easily reducible Fe(III)-oxo species, while high propene yield in C3H8/N2O is achieved regardless of the Fe species population. Low protonic site concentration and small crystallites that prevent propene oligomerization and polyolefin accumulation are necessary for selective propane oxidative dehydrogenation to propene.

1.沸石Fe-ZSM-5的蒸气处理导致Brnsted位点和裸露Fe(II)离子浓度降低，而Td配位Fe(III)离子在框架外物种和Fe氧化物样颗粒中占主导。Fe的氧化还原状态受反应条件影响。N2O分解的高活性需要容易还原的Fe(III)-oxo物种，而C3H8/N2O中高丙烯产率的实现与Fe物种的种群无关。低质子位点浓度和小晶粒，防止丙烯寡聚和多烯烃积累，是Fe-ZSM-5上选择性丙烷氧化脱氢制丙烯的必要条件。
