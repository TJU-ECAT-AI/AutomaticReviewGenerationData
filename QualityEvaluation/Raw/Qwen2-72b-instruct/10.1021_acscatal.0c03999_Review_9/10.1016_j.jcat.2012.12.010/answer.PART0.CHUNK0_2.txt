[1] "The steaming of FeH-zeolites, dramatically changing the structure of Fe species and resulting in that only approximately 20% of the Fe(II) species originally present (see Table 3), yielded a significant decrease in TOF to 30% of the original value (to 2.2  104 and 3.0  104 s1)."
[2] "The initial (at TOS 5 min) TOFC3H8 of both FeH-ZSM-5 zeolites,regardless of the crystal size, were similar and exhibited similar decrease with TOS."
[3] "These initial values were also not significantly affected by the steaming of both zeolites, although the structure of Fe species was markedly changed as reported in Sections 3.13.4."
[4] "But the TOFC3H8 and propane conversion (Fig. 6A) over FeH-ZSM- 5 decreased with TOS much more compared to the steamed zeolites."
[5] "On contrary, the initial propene yields (and TOFC3H6) were substantially higher for the steamed zeolites compared to non- steamed ones, and moreover, much more stable values with TOS were found."
[6] "This finding might indicate much lower propene olig- omerization/aromatization and oxidation of these side products as a result of much lower concentration of Brnsted sites (decreased of ca 80%, see Table 2) in the steamed zeolites."
[7] "The concentration and character of the accumulated hydrocar- bon products in the pores of FeH- and Fe(H)-ZSM-5st zeolites after TOS of 240 min was estimated by the TPO of the spent catalyst (Table 8)."
[8] "The total amount of deposits was substan- tially lower (23 times) for the steamed Fe-zeolites (even at a com- parable amount of converted propane) containing a higher portion of olefinic and oxygenate coke (LTC) in comparison with the non-steamed zeolites, where aromatic coke (HTC) predominated."

1.蒸煮FeH-沸石会改变Fe物种的结构，导致TOF显著降低至原始值的30%。无论晶粒尺寸如何，两种FeH-ZSM-5沸石的初始TOFC3H8相似，并且随TOS的增加而表现出相似的下降趋势。这两种沸石的蒸煮对这些初始值没有显著影响，尽管Fe物种的结构发生了显著变化。但是，FeH-ZSM-5的TOFC3H8和丙烷转化率随TOS的增加比蒸煮沸石下降得更多。相反，蒸煮沸石的初始丙烯产量与非蒸煮沸石相比显著更高，而且，随TOS的增加，这些值更稳定。这一发现可能表明，由于蒸煮沸石中Brnsted位点的浓度大大降低，丙烯的寡聚化/芳构化和这些副产品的氧化大大降低。在TOS 240分钟后，通过TPO分析了FeH-和Fe(H)-ZSM-5st沸石孔隙中积累的烃类产品的浓度和特性。与非蒸煮沸石相比，蒸煮Fe-沸石的沉积物总量大大降低，其中含有较高比例的烯烃和含氧化合物焦炭，而非蒸煮沸石中则以芳烃焦炭为主。
