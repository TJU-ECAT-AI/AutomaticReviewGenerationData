[1] "The steaming of FeH-zeolites, dramatically changing the structure of Fe species and resulting in that only approximately 20% of the Fe(II) species originally present (see Table 3), yielded a significant decrease in TOF to 30% of the original value (to 2.2  104 and 3.0  104 s1)."
[2] "The initial (at TOS 5 min) TOFC3H8 of both FeH-ZSM-5 zeolites,regardless of the crystal size, were similar and exhibited similar decrease with TOS."
[3] "The initial propene yields (and TOFC3H6) were substantially higher for the steamed zeolites compared to non-steamed ones, and moreover, much more stable values with TOS were found."
[4] "The concentration and character of the accumulated hydrocarbon products in the pores of FeH- and Fe(H)-ZSM-5st zeolites after TOS of 240 min was estimated by the TPO of the spent catalyst (Table 8)."
[5] "The total amount of deposits was substantially lower (23 times) for the steamed Fe-zeolites (even at a comparable amount of converted propane) containing a higher portion of olefinic and oxygenate coke (LTC) in comparison with the non-steamed zeolites, where aromatic coke (HTC) predominated."

1.Steaming of FeH-zeolites results in a significant decrease in TOF to 30% of the original value, due to the dramatic change in the structure of Fe species and the reduction of Fe(II) species to only approximately 20% of the original amount. The initial TOFC3H8 of both FeH-ZSM-5 zeolites, regardless of crystal size, are similar and exhibit a similar decrease with TOS. The initial propene yields (and TOFC3H6) are substantially higher for the steamed zeolites compared to non-steamed ones, and moreover, much more stable values with TOS are found. The concentration and character of the accumulated hydrocarbon products in the pores of FeH- and Fe(H)-ZSM-5st zeolites after TOS of 240 min can be estimated by the TPO of the spent catalyst. The total amount of deposits is substantially lower (23 times) for the steamed Fe-zeolites, even at a comparable amount of converted propane, containing a higher portion of olefinic and oxygenate coke (LTC) in comparison with the non-steamed zeolites, where aromatic coke (HTC) predominates.

1.蒸煮FeH-沸石会导致TOF显著降低至原始值的30%，这是由于Fe物种结构的剧烈变化和Fe(II)物种减少至原始量的大约20%。两种FeH-ZSM-5沸石的初始TOFC3H8，无论晶粒大小如何，都是相似的，并且随着TOS的增加而表现出相似的下降趋势。蒸煮沸石的初始丙烯产量（和TOFC3H6）与非蒸煮沸石相比显著更高，而且随着TOS的增加，更稳定的值被发现。在TOS 240分钟后，FeH-和Fe(H)-ZSM-5st沸石孔隙中积累的碳氢化合物产品的浓度和特性可以通过催化剂的TPO来估计。与非蒸煮沸石相比，即使在相当的丙烷转化量下，蒸煮Fe-沸石的沉积物总量显著降低（23倍），其中含有更高比例的烯烃和含氧化合物焦炭（LTC），而非蒸煮沸石中则以芳香焦炭（HTC）为主。
