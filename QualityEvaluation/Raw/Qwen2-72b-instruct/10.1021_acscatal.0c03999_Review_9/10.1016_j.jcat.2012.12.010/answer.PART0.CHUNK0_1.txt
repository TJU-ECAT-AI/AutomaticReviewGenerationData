[1] "The steaming of FeH-zeolites, dramatically changing the structure of Fe species and resulting in that only approximately 20% of the Fe(II) species originally present (see Table 3), yielded a significant decrease in TOF to 30% of the original value (to 2.2  104 and 3.0  104 s1)."

1.Steaming of FeH-zeolites results in a significant decrease in TOF to 30% of the original value, due to the dramatic change in the structure of Fe species and the reduction of Fe(II) species to only approximately 20% of the original amount. The interaction of Fe site with N2O to form Fe(III)AO complex is faster, as evidenced by the nearly quantitative transformation of Fe(II) ions in the cationic sites of FeH-Z1 into Fe(III)AO complexes under simulated in situ reaction conditions at 400 C. The steaming of FeH-zeolites also leads to a significant decrease in TOF to 30% of the original value, due to the dramatic change in the structure of Fe species and the reduction of Fe(II) species to only approximately 20% of the original amount.
