[1] "The steamed Fe(H)-ZSM-5st zeolites were greatly reorganized, resulting in a low concentration of both the Brnsted sites and bare Fe(II) ions, and the Td-coordinated Fe(III) ions in the FeAAlASi extra-framework species (4347%) and Fe-oxide-like particles (3033%) prevailed."
[2] "The high concentration of counter Fe(III)-oxo species easily reducible to Fe(II) is critical for high activity in N2O decomposition, whereas high yield of propene in C3H8/N2O is achieved regardless of population of the individual dispersed Fe species."
[3] "The low concentra- tion of protonic sites and small crystallites of zeolites, not supporting propene oligomerization, accumu- lation of polyolefins in the pores and their easy oxidation to CO/CO2, are necessary conditions for selective oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propene over Fe-ZSM-5."

1.Steaming of Fe-ZSM-5 zeolites results in a reorganization of the structure, leading to a low concentration of Brønsted sites and bare Fe(II) ions. Instead, Td-coordinated Fe(III) ions in the FeAAlASi extra-framework species and Fe-oxide-like particles become predominant. The high concentration of easily reducible Fe(III)-oxo species is crucial for high activity in N2O decomposition. However, high propene yield in propane/N2O reactions can be achieved regardless of the population of individual dispersed Fe species. Low concentration of protonic sites and small crystallites of zeolites, which do not support propene oligomerization and accumulation of polyolefins in the pores, are necessary conditions for selective oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propene over Fe-ZSM-5.

1.铁ZSM-5沸石的蒸汽处理导致结构的重新组织，导致Brønsted位点和裸露Fe(II)离子的浓度降低。相反，FeAAlASi超框架物种和Fe氧化物样颗粒中的Td配位Fe(III)离子成为主导。高浓度的容易还原的Fe(III)-oxo物种对于N2O分解的高活性至关重要。然而，无论分散Fe物种的个体浓度如何，丙烷/N2O反应都能实现高丙烯产率。沸石中质子位点的低浓度和小晶粒，不支持丙烯的寡聚化和多烯烃在孔隙中的积累，是Fe-ZSM-5上选择性氧化脱氢丙烷为丙烯的必要条件。
