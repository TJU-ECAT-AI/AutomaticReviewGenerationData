How do various synthesis methods (such as steam treatment, solid-state ion exchange, and liquid exchange) of iron-containing ZSM-5 zeolites influence their catalytic performance in the N2O-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reaction, and what are the key performance metrics (including C3H8 conversion, N2O conversion, C3H6 selectivity, and C3H6 yield) that demonstrate their effectiveness under different reaction conditions?

[1] "The steaming of FeH-zeolites, dramatically changing the structure of Fe species and resulting in that only approximately 20% of the Fe(II) species originally present (see Table 3), yielded a significant decrease in TOF to 30% of the original value (to 2.2  104 and 3.0  104 s1)."
[2] "The initial (at TOS 5 min) TOFC3H8 of both FeH-ZSM-5 zeolites,regardless of the crystal size, were similar and exhibited similar decrease with TOS."
[3] "The initial propene yields (and TOFC3H6) were substantially higher for the steamed zeolites compared to non-steamed ones, and moreover, much more stable values with TOS were found."
[4] "The concentration and character of the accumulated hydrocarbon products in the pores of FeH- and Fe(H)-ZSM-5st zeolites after TOS of 240 min was estimated by the TPO of the spent catalyst (Table 8)."
[5] "The total amount of deposits was substantially lower (23 times) for the steamed Fe-zeolites (even at a comparable amount of converted propane) containing a higher portion of olefinic and oxygenate coke (LTC) in comparison with the non-steamed zeolites, where aromatic coke (HTC) predominated."

1.蒸煮FeH-沸石会改变Fe物种的结构，导致TOF显著降低至原始值的30%。无论晶粒尺寸如何，两种FeH-ZSM-5沸石的初始TOFC3H8相似，并且随TOS的增加而表现出相似的下降趋势。这两种沸石的蒸煮对这些初始值没有显著影响，尽管Fe物种的结构发生了显著变化。但是，FeH-ZSM-5的TOFC3H8和丙烷转化率随TOS的增加比蒸煮沸石下降得更多。相反，蒸煮沸石的初始丙烯产量与非蒸煮沸石相比显著更高，而且，随TOS的增加，这些值更稳定。这一发现可能表明，由于蒸煮沸石中Brnsted位点的浓度大大降低，丙烯的寡聚化/芳构化和这些副产品的氧化大大降低。在TOS 240分钟后，通过TPO分析了FeH-和Fe(H)-ZSM-5st沸石孔隙中积累的烃类产品的浓度和特性。与非蒸煮沸石相比，蒸煮Fe-沸石的沉积物总量大大降低，其中含有较高比例的烯烃和含氧化合物焦炭，而非蒸煮沸石中则以芳烃焦炭为主。

1.Steaming of Fe-ZSM-5 zeolites results in a reorganization of the structure, leading to a low concentration of Brønsted sites and bare Fe(II) ions. Instead, Td-coordinated Fe(III) ions in the FeAAlASi extra-framework species and Fe-oxide-like particles become predominant. The high concentration of easily reducible Fe(III)-oxo species is crucial for high activity in N2O decomposition. However, high propene yield in propane/N2O reactions can be achieved regardless of the population of individual dispersed Fe species. Low concentration of protonic sites and small crystallites of zeolites, which do not support propene oligomerization and accumulation of polyolefins in the pores, are necessary conditions for selective oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propene over Fe-ZSM-5.
