Iron-containing ZSM-5 zeolites have garnered significant attention as catalysts in the N2O-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reactions due to their high activity and selectivity. The synthesis methods employed for these catalysts play a crucial role in determining their catalytic performance. Different synthesis techniques, such as ion-exchange, incipient wetness impregnation, and hydrothermal synthesis, can influence the iron distribution, acid site density, and pore structure of the zeolites, which in turn affect the reaction kinetics and product selectivity. Key performance metrics, including conversion rate, selectivity to propene, and catalyst stability, are used to evaluate the effectiveness of these catalysts. Studies have shown that the optimal synthesis method can enhance the dispersion of iron species within the zeolite framework, leading to improved catalytic activity and selectivity. Moreover, the stability of the catalyst under reaction conditions is crucial for its practical application, and this is often assessed by monitoring the change in activity over time. Overall, the choice of synthesis method is critical in tailoring the properties of iron-containing ZSM-5 zeolites for efficient and selective ODHP reactions.
