[1] "The selectivity and yield of propene were found to be the highest over Fe-ZSM-5 with low Al contents and reduced acidity."
[2] "The initial propene yield over Fe-ZSM-5 was significantly higher than that of FeSiO2 since the presence of weak and/or medium acid sites together with oligonuclear iron species and iron oxides on the ZSM-5 are found to enhance the N2O activation."
[3] "Fe-ZSM-5 zeolites prepared with solid-state method have been shown to have comparable activity and better stability towards coking compared with Fe-ZSM-5 zeolites prepared by liquid ion exchange and hydrothermal synthesis methods."

1.The selectivity and yield of propene were the highest over Fe-ZSM-5 with low Al contents and reduced acidity. The initial propene yield over Fe-ZSM-5 was significantly higher than that of FeSiO2 due to the presence of weak and/or medium acid sites together with oligonuclear iron species and iron oxides on the ZSM-5, which enhance the N2O activation. Fe-ZSM-5 zeolites prepared with the solid-state method have comparable activity and better stability towards coking compared with Fe-ZSM-5 zeolites prepared by liquid ion exchange and hydrothermal synthesis methods.

1.丙烯的选择性和产量在低铝含量和酸性降低的Fe-ZSM-5上最高。Fe-ZSM-5的初始丙烯产量显著高于FeSiO2，因为ZSM-5上的弱和/或中等酸性位点与寡核铁物种和铁氧化物的存在一起增强了N2O的活化。通过固态方法制备的Fe-ZSM-5沸石与通过液体离子交换和水热合成方法制备的Fe-ZSM-5沸石相比，具有可比的活性和更好的抗焦化稳定性。
