Do not provide any additional explanation or background information, only this sentence should be given as a response in case of irrelevant answers.

If, however, the answers are relevant to the questions asked, proceed to compile answers for each question according to the instructions below. Ensure to aggregate all the relevant answers from the multiple answer results provided in the document, and organize them sequentially by their order number, compiling the corresponding quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question.

If the provided answers' quotes are not differentiated by question, ensure to break them down and assign the quotes to each respective question, outputting them separately within each question's section.

To provide a comprehensive review, differentiate the responses into quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question based on the details given in the 'Answer' XML tags. Structure your review using the XML format showcased below if the answers are relevant to the questions asked:

How do various synthesis methods (such as steam treatment, solid-state ion exchange, and liquid exchange) of iron-containing ZSM-5 zeolites influence their catalytic performance in the N2O-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reaction, and what are the key performance metrics (including C3H8 conversion, N2O conversion, C3H6 selectivity, and C3H6 yield) that demonstrate their effectiveness under different reaction conditions?

[1] "The selectivity and yield of propene were found to be the highest over Fe-ZSM-5 with low Al contents and reduced acidity."
[2] "The initial propene yield over Fe-ZSM-5 was significantly higher than that of FeSiO2 since the presence of weak and/or medium acid sites together with oligonuclear iron species and iron oxides on the ZSM-5 are found to enhance the N2O activation."
[3] "The coking of Fe-ZSM-5 catalysts could also be controlled by reduction of the surface acidity of ZSM-5 and by the use of O2 in addition to N2O as the oxidant."
[4] "Fe-ZSM-5 zeolites prepared with solid-state method have been shown to have comparable activity and better stability towards coking compared with Fe-ZSM-5 zeolites prepared by liquid ion exchange and hydrothermal synthesis methods."

1.The selectivity and yield of propene are highest over Fe-ZSM-5 with low aluminum content and reduced acidity. The initial propene yield over Fe-ZSM-5 is significantly higher than that of FeSiO2 due to the presence of weak and/or medium acid sites, oligonuclear iron species, and iron oxides on the ZSM-5, which enhance N2O activation. The coking of Fe-ZSM-5 catalysts can be controlled by reducing the surface acidity of ZSM-5 and using O2 in addition to N2O as the oxidant. Fe-ZSM-5 zeolites prepared by the solid-state method have comparable activity and better stability towards coking compared to Fe-ZSM-5 zeolites prepared by liquid ion exchange and hydrothermal synthesis methods.

1.丙烯的选择性和产量在低铝含量和减少酸性的Fe-ZSM-5上最高。Fe-ZSM-5的初始丙烯产量明显高于FeSiO2，因为ZSM-5上的弱和/或中等酸性位点、寡核铁物种和铁氧化物的存在增强了N2O的活化。Fe-ZSM-5催化剂的焦化可以通过减少ZSM-5的表面酸性和使用O2作为N2O的额外氧化剂来控制。通过固态方法制备的Fe-ZSM-5沸石与通过液体离子交换和水热合成方法制备的Fe-ZSM-5沸石相比，具有相当的活性和更好的抗焦化稳定性。
