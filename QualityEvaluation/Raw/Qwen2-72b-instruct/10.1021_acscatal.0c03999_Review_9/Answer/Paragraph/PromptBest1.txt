Fe-zeolites with the highest Fe content steamed in the flow of water vapor at 600 C showed the highest catalytic activity. In addition to propene, other valuable products such as ethene, methanol, ethanol, and acetone were formed \[10.1016/j.apcata.2003.12.020\]. Synthesized comprehension stemming from references \[10.1016/j.apcata.2012.06.038\] and \[10.1016/j.jcat.2012.12.010\] reveals that the selectivity and yield of propene were highest over Fe-ZSM-5 with low Al contents and reduced acidity. The initial propene yield over Fe-ZSM-5 was significantly higher than that of FeSiO2 due to the presence of weak and/or medium acid sites together with oligonuclear iron species and iron oxides on the ZSM-5, which enhance the N2O activation. The coking of Fe-ZSM-5 catalysts could be controlled by reducing the surface acidity of ZSM-5 and using O2 in addition to N2O as the oxidant. Fe-ZSM-5 zeolites prepared with the solid-state method have comparable activity and better stability towards coking compared to Fe-ZSM-5 zeolites prepared by liquid ion exchange and hydrothermal synthesis methods \[10.1016/j.apcata.2012.06.038\]. Steaming of FeH-zeolites changes the structure of Fe species, resulting in a significant decrease in TOF to 30% of the original value. The initial TOFC3H8 of both FeH-ZSM-5 zeolites, regardless of the crystal size, were similar and exhibited similar decrease with TOS. These initial values were also not significantly affected by the steaming of both zeolites, although the structure of Fe species was markedly changed. But the TOFC3H8 and propane conversion over FeH-ZSM-5 decreased with TOS much more compared to the steamed zeolites. On contrary, the initial propene yields were substantially higher for the steamed zeolites compared to non-steamed ones, and moreover, much more stable values with TOS were found. This finding might indicate much lower propene oligomerization/aromatization and oxidation of these side products as a result of much lower concentration of Brnsted sites in the steamed zeolites \[10.1016/j.jcat.2012.12.010\].

Future research endeavors might focus on the development of novel synthesis techniques that can further enhance the catalytic performance of Fe-ZSM-5 zeolites in the N2O-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane. The optimization of reaction conditions, such as temperature and oxidant composition, could also be a fruitful area of investigation.

The control of coking and the improvement of catalyst stability are also critical challenges that need to be addressed. The exploration of alternative iron sources and the investigation of the role of other metal ions in the catalytic process could also be promising directions for future research.

The effectiveness and performance of iron-containing ZSM-5 zeolites as catalysts in N2O-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reactions: Impact of synthesis methods on catalytic performance and evaluation through key performance metrics. Steam treatment of iron-containing ZSM-5 zeolites results in a C3H8 conversion of 48%, N2O conversion of 96%, and C3H6 selectivity of 45% at 450 degrees Celsius \[10.1021/acscatal.0c03999_9\]. Solid-state ion exchange or liquid exchange methods of synthesizing Fe-ZSM-5 also show good catalytic performance, with C3H8 conversion ranging from 20% to 60%, C3H6 selectivity from 25% to 70%, and C3H6 yield from 14% to 30% in the temperature range of 377 to 527 degrees Celsius \[10.1021/acscatal.0c03999_9\]. The study investigated the oxidation of propane using oxygen, nitrous oxide, or a mixture of both over ZSM-5 zeolites with low iron concentrations (30-1200 ppm) treated under various conditions at 450 C. The highest propane conversion (51.7%) and selectivity to propene (39.7%) and to the sum of aromatics and oxygenates (11.5%, mainly C1C3 alcohols) was achieved when a mixture of oxygen and nitrous oxide was used as the oxidant over the steamed FeH-ZSM-5 \[10.1016/j.apcata.2003.12.020\]. The selectivity and yield of propene were highest over Fe-ZSM-5 with low Al contents and reduced acidity. The initial propene yield over Fe-ZSM-5 was significantly higher than that of FeSiO2 due to the presence of weak and/or medium acid sites together with oligonuclear iron species and iron oxides on the ZSM-5, which enhance the N2O activation \[10.1016/j.apcata.2012.06.038\].

Future research endeavors might focus on the development of novel synthesis techniques that further enhance the catalytic performance of Fe-ZSM-5 zeolites in the ODHP reaction. The optimization of synthesis conditions, such as temperature, time, and precursor concentration, could lead to the creation of zeolites with improved stability and selectivity. Additionally, the investigation of the role of different iron species in the catalytic activity and the development of strategies to control their formation could provide insights into the design of more efficient catalysts. The exploration of alternative oxidants and reaction conditions could also expand the scope of the ODHP process, potentially leading to the production of a wider range of valuable products.
