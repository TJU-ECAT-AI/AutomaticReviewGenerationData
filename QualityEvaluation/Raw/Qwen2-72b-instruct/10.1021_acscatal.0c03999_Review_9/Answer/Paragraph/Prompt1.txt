{"DOC": "The study investigated the oxidation of propane using oxygen, nitrous oxide, or a mixture of both over ZSM-5 zeolites with low iron concentrations (30-1200 ppm) treated under various conditions at 450 C. The highest propane conversion (51.7%) and selectivity to propene (39.7%) and to the sum of aromatics and oxygenates (11.5%, mainly C1C3 alcohols) was achieved when a mixture of oxygen and nitrous oxide was used as the oxidant over the steamed FeH-ZSM-5. The catalytic activity was attributed to extra-framework Fe-oxo complexes generated by hydrolysis of framework SiOFe bonds followed by extraction of iron to extra-framework positions. Fe-zeolites with the highest Fe content steamed in the flow of water vapor at 600 C showed the highest catalytic activity. In addition to propene, other valuable products such as ethene, methanol, ethanol, and acetone were formed.", "Doi": "10.1016/j.apcata.2003.12.020"},
{"DOC": "The selectivity and yield of propene were highest over Fe-ZSM-5 with low Al contents and reduced acidity. The initial propene yield over Fe-ZSM-5 was significantly higher than that of FeSiO2 due to the presence of weak and/or medium acid sites together with oligonuclear iron species and iron oxides on the ZSM-5, which enhance the N2O activation. The coking of Fe-ZSM-5 catalysts could be controlled by reducing the surface acidity of ZSM-5 and using O2 in addition to N2O as the oxidant. Fe-ZSM-5 zeolites prepared with the solid-state method have comparable activity and better stability towards coking compared to Fe-ZSM-5 zeolites prepared by liquid ion exchange and hydrothermal synthesis methods.", "Doi": "10.1016/j.apcata.2012.06.038"},
{"DOC": "Steaming of FeH-zeolites changes the structure of Fe species, resulting in a significant decrease in TOF to 30% of the original value. The initial TOFC3H8 of both FeH-ZSM-5 zeolites, regardless of the crystal size, were similar and exhibited similar decrease with TOS. These initial values were also not significantly affected by the steaming of both zeolites, although the structure of Fe species was markedly changed. But the TOFC3H8 and propane conversion over FeH-ZSM-5 decreased with TOS much more compared to the steamed zeolites. On contrary, the initial propene yields were substantially higher for the steamed zeolites compared to non-steamed ones, and moreover, much more stable values with TOS were found. This finding might indicate much lower propene oligomerization/aromatization and oxidation of these side products as a result of much lower concentration of Brnsted sites in the steamed zeolites. The concentration and character of the accumulated hydrocarbon products in the pores of FeH- and Fe(H)-ZSM-5st zeolites after TOS of 240 min was estimated by the TPO of the spent catalyst. The total amount of deposits was substantially lower for the steamed Fe-zeolites containing a higher portion of olefinic and oxygenate coke in comparison with the non-steamed zeolites, where aromatic coke predominated. The interaction of Fe site with N2O to form Fe(III)AO complex is faster, as evidenced by the nearly quantitative transformation of Fe(II) ions in the cationic sites of FeH-Z1 into Fe(III)AO complexes under simulated in situ reaction conditions at 400 C. Steaming of Fe-ZSM-5 zeolites results in a low concentration of Brønsted sites and bare Fe(II) ions. Instead, Td-coordinated Fe(III) ions in the FeAAlASi extra-framework species and Fe-oxide-like particles become predominant. The high concentration of easily reducible Fe(III)-oxo species is crucial for high activity in N2O decomposition. However, high propene yield in propane/N2O reactions can be achieved regardless of the population of individual dispersed Fe species. Low concentration of protonic sites and small crystallites of zeolites, which do not support propene oligomerization and accumulation of polyolefins in the pores, are necessary conditions for selective oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propene over Fe-ZSM-5. The redox state of Fe is influenced by the reaction conditions. High activity in N2O decomposition requires easily reducible Fe(III)-oxo species, while high propene yield in C3H8/N2O is achieved regardless of the Fe species population.

But the TOFC3H8 and propane conversion over FeH-ZSM-5 decreased with TOS much more compared to the steamed zeolites. On contrary, the initial propene yields were substantially higher for the steamed zeolites compared to non-steamed ones, and moreover, much more stable values with TOS were found. This finding might indicate much lower propene oligomerization/aromatization and oxidation of these side products as a result of much lower concentration of Brnsted sites in the steamed zeolites. The concentration and character of the accumulated hydrocarbon products in the pores of FeH- and Fe(H)-ZSM-5st zeolites after TOS of 240 min was estimated by the TPO of the spent catalyst. The total amount of deposits was substantially lower for the steamed Fe-zeolites containing a higher portion of olefinic and oxygenate coke in comparison with the non-steamed zeolites, where aromatic coke predominated. The interaction of Fe site with N2O to form Fe(III)AO complex is faster, as evidenced by the nearly quantitative transformation of Fe(II) ions in the cationic sites of FeH-Z1 into Fe(III)AO complexes under simulated in situ reaction conditions at 400 C. Steaming of Fe-ZSM-5 zeolites results in a low concentration of Brønsted sites and bare Fe(II) ions. Instead, Td-coordinated Fe(III) ions in the FeAAlASi extra-framework species and Fe-oxide-like particles become predominant. The high concentration of easily reducible Fe(III)-oxo species is crucial for high activity in N2O decomposition. However, high propene yield in propane/N2O reactions can be achieved regardless of the population of individual dispersed Fe species. Low concentration of protonic sites and small crystallites of zeolites, which do not support propene oligomerization and accumulation of polyolefins in the pores, are necessary conditions for selective oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propene over Fe-ZSM-5. The redox state of Fe is influenced by the reaction conditions.

The concentration and character of the accumulated hydrocarbon products in the pores of FeH- and Fe(H)-ZSM-5st zeolites after TOS of 240 min was estimated by the TPO of the spent catalyst. The total amount of deposits was substantially lower for the steamed Fe-zeolites containing a higher portion of olefinic and oxygenate coke in comparison with the non-steamed zeolites, where aromatic coke predominated. The interaction of Fe site with N2O to form Fe(III)AO complex is faster, as evidenced by the nearly quantitative transformation of Fe(II) ions in the cationic sites of FeH-Z1 into Fe(III)AO complexes under simulated in situ reaction conditions at 400 C. Steaming of Fe-ZSM-5 zeolites results in a low concentration of Brønsted sites and bare Fe(II) ions. Instead, Td-coordinated Fe(III) ions in the FeAAlASi extra-framework species and Fe-oxide-like particles become predominant. The high concentration of easily reducible Fe(III)-oxo species is crucial for high activity in N2O decomposition. However, high propene yield in propane/N2O reactions can be achieved regardless of the population of individual dispersed Fe species. Low concentration of protonic sites and small crystallites of zeolites, which do not support propene oligomerization and accumulation of polyolefins in the pores, are necessary conditions for selective oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propene over Fe-ZSM-5. The redox state of Fe is influenced by the reaction conditions. High activity in N2O decomposition requires easily reducible Fe(III)-oxo species, while high propene yield in C3H8/N2O is achieved regardless of the Fe species population. Low protonic site concentration and small crystallites that prevent propene oligomerization and polyolefin accumulation are necessary for selective propane oxidative dehydrogenation to propene.", "Doi": "10.1016/j.jcat.2012.12.010"},
{"DOC": "Steam-activated Fe-zeolites (MFI and BEA) are efficient catalysts for the N2O-mediated oxidative dehydrogenation of propane, achieving initial propylene yields up to 25% at 723 K. However, they deactivate due to coke formation. Steam activation is essential for superior catalytic performance, as the initial conversions of propane and N2O over calcined zeolites are much lower. The initial conversion and selectivity are similar in steam-activated iron zeolites, regardless of the host (MFI vs BEA), zeolite acidity (ZSM-5 vs silicalite), and iron content. The dynamics of the reaction, including deactivation behavior and coke formation, vary significantly. Coke likely forms from propene condensation, the main olefin produced. Ex-Fe-silicalite shows a lower deactivation rate than ex-FeBEA, with a continuous decline in propene yield correlating with a gradual increase in coke content. Ex-FeZSM-5 exhibits remarkable resistance to deactivation. The higher activity and lower deactivation rate of ex-H-ZSM-5 compared to ex-H-BEA parallel the results for ex-FeZSM-5 and ex-FeBEA.", "Doi": "10.1016/j.jcat.2004.02.005"},

Solid-state ion exchange or liquid exchange methods of synthesizing Fe-ZSM-5 also show good catalytic performance, with C3H8 conversion ranging from 20% to 60%, C3H6 selectivity from 25% to 70%, and C3H6 yield from 14% to 30% in the temperature range of 377 to 527 degrees Celsius.", "Doi": "10.1021/acscatal.0c03999_9"},
{"DOC": "The study investigated the oxidation of propane using oxygen, nitrous oxide, or a mixture of both over ZSM-5 zeolites with low iron concentrations (30-1200 ppm) treated under various conditions at 450 C. The highest propane conversion (51.7%) and selectivity to propene (39.7%) and to the sum of aromatics and oxygenates (11.5%, mainly C1C3 alcohols) was achieved when a mixture of oxygen and nitrous oxide was used as the oxidant over the steamed FeH-ZSM-5. The catalytic activity was attributed to extra-framework Fe-oxo complexes generated by hydrolysis of framework SiOFe bonds followed by extraction of iron to extra-framework positions. Fe-zeolites with the highest Fe content steamed in the flow of water vapor at 600 C showed the highest catalytic activity. In addition to propene, other valuable products such as ethene, methanol, ethanol, and acetone were formed.", "Doi": "10.1016/j.apcata.2003.12.020"},
{"DOC": "The selectivity and yield of propene were highest over Fe-ZSM-5 with low Al contents and reduced acidity. The initial propene yield over Fe-ZSM-5 was significantly higher than that of FeSiO2 due to the presence of weak and/or medium acid sites together with oligonuclear iron species and iron oxides on the ZSM-5, which enhance the N2O activation. The coking of Fe-ZSM-5 catalysts could be controlled by reducing the surface acidity of ZSM-5 and using O2 in addition to N2O as the oxidant. Fe-ZSM-5 zeolites prepared with the solid-state method have comparable activity and better stability towards coking compared to Fe-ZSM-5 zeolites prepared by liquid ion exchange and hydrothermal synthesis methods.", "Doi": "10.1016/j.apcata.2012.06.038"},
{"DOC": "Steaming of FeH-zeolites changes the structure of Fe species, resulting in a significant decrease in TOF to 30% of the original value.

These initial values were also not significantly affected by the steaming of both zeolites, although the structure of Fe species was markedly changed. But the TOFC3H8 and propane conversion over FeH-ZSM-5 decreased with TOS much more compared to the steamed zeolites.
