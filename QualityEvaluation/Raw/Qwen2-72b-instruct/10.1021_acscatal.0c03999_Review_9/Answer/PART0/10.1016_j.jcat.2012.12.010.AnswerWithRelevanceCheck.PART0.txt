          [1] "The steaming of FeH-zeolites, dramatically changing the structure of Fe species and resulting in that only approximately 20% of the Fe(II) species originally present (see Table 3), yielded a significant decrease in TOF to 30% of the original value (to 2.2  104 and 3.0  104 s1)."
          [2] "The initial (at TOS 5 min) TOFC3H8 of both FeH-ZSM-5 zeolites,regardless of the crystal size, were similar and exhibited similar decrease with TOS."
          [3] "The initial propene yields (and TOFC3H6) were substantially higher for the steamed zeolites compared to non-steamed ones, and moreover, much more stable values with TOS were found."
          [4] "The concentration and character of the accumulated hydrocarbon products in the pores of FeH- and Fe(H)-ZSM-5st zeolites after TOS of 240 min was estimated by the TPO of the spent catalyst (Table 8)."
          [5] "The total amount of deposits was substantially lower (23 times) for the steamed Fe-zeolites (even at a comparable amount of converted propane) containing a higher portion of olefinic and oxygenate coke (LTC) in comparison with the non-steamed zeolites, where aromatic coke (HTC) predominated."
          [6] "The finding that the interaction of Fe site with N2O yielding Fe(III)AO complex is faster is also proven here by the simulated in situ reaction conditions at 400 C (monitored by Mssbauer analysis at RT)."
          [7] "It showed nearly quantitative transformation of Fe(II) ions in the cationic sites of FeH-Z1 into Fe(III)AO complexes (75% of Fe ions, see Table 4)."
          [8] "The steamed Fe(H)-ZSM-5st zeolites were greatly reorganized, resulting in a low concentration of both the Brnsted sites and bare Fe(II) ions, and the Td-coordinated Fe(III) ions in the FeAAlASi extra-framework species (4347%) and Fe-oxide-like particles (3033%) prevailed."
          [9] "The redox state of Fe in both non-steamed and steamed Fe-ZSM-5 was strongly influenced by the reaction conditions of N2O decomposition and C3H8/N2O."
          [10] "Bare counter Fe(III)-oxo species easily reducible to Fe(II) is critical for high activity in N2O decomposition, whereas high yield of propene in C3H8/N2O is achieved regardless of population of the individual dispersed Fe species."
          [11] "The low concentration of protonic sites and small crystallites of zeolites, not supporting propene oligomerization, accumulation of polyolefins in the pores and their easy oxidation to CO/CO2, are necessary conditions for selective oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propene over Fe-ZSM-5."

          Steaming of FeH-zeolites changes the structure of Fe species, resulting in a significant decrease in TOF to 30% of the original value. The initial TOFC3H8 of both FeH-ZSM-5 zeolites, regardless of the crystal size, were similar and exhibited similar decrease with TOS. These initial values were also not significantly affected by the steaming of both zeolites, although the structure of Fe species was markedly changed. But the TOFC3H8 and propane conversion over FeH-ZSM-5 decreased with TOS much more compared to the steamed zeolites. On contrary, the initial propene yields were substantially higher for the steamed zeolites compared to non-steamed ones, and moreover, much more stable values with TOS were found. This finding might indicate much lower propene oligomerization/aromatization and oxidation of these side products as a result of much lower concentration of Brnsted sites in the steamed zeolites. The concentration and character of the accumulated hydrocarbon products in the pores of FeH- and Fe(H)-ZSM-5st zeolites after TOS of 240 min was estimated by the TPO of the spent catalyst. The total amount of deposits was substantially lower for the steamed Fe-zeolites containing a higher portion of olefinic and oxygenate coke in comparison with the non-steamed zeolites, where aromatic coke predominated. The interaction of Fe site with N2O to form Fe(III)AO complex is faster, as evidenced by the nearly quantitative transformation of Fe(II) ions in the cationic sites of FeH-Z1 into Fe(III)AO complexes under simulated in situ reaction conditions at 400 C. Steaming of Fe-ZSM-5 zeolites results in a low concentration of Brønsted sites and bare Fe(II) ions. Instead, Td-coordinated Fe(III) ions in the FeAAlASi extra-framework species and Fe-oxide-like particles become predominant. The high concentration of easily reducible Fe(III)-oxo species is crucial for high activity in N2O decomposition. However, high propene yield in propane/N2O reactions can be achieved regardless of the population of individual dispersed Fe species. Low concentration of protonic sites and small crystallites of zeolites, which do not support propene oligomerization and accumulation of polyolefins in the pores, are necessary conditions for selective oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propene over Fe-ZSM-5. The redox state of Fe is influenced by the reaction conditions. High activity in N2O decomposition requires easily reducible Fe(III)-oxo species, while high propene yield in C3H8/N2O is achieved regardless of the Fe species population. Low protonic site concentration and small crystallites that prevent propene oligomerization and polyolefin accumulation are necessary for selective propane oxidative dehydrogenation to propene.

          蒸煮FeH-沸石会改变Fe物种的结构，导致TOF显著降低至原始值的30%。无论晶粒尺寸如何，两种FeH-ZSM-5沸石的初始TOFC3H8相似，并且随TOS的增加而表现出相似的下降趋势。这两种沸石的蒸煮对这些初始值没有显著影响，尽管Fe物种的结构发生了显著变化。但是，FeH-ZSM-5的TOFC3H8和丙烷转化率随TOS的增加比蒸煮沸石下降得更多。相反，蒸煮沸石的初始丙烯产量与非蒸煮沸石相比显著更高，而且，随TOS的增加，这些值更稳定。这一发现可能表明，由于蒸煮沸石中Brnsted位点的浓度大大降低，丙烯的寡聚化/芳构化和这些副产品的氧化大大降低。在TOS 240分钟后，通过TPO分析了FeH-和Fe(H)-ZSM-5st沸石孔隙中积累的烃类产品的浓度和特性。与非蒸煮沸石相比，蒸煮Fe-沸石的沉积物总量大大降低，其中含有较高比例的烯烃和含氧化合物焦炭，而非蒸煮沸石中则以芳烃焦炭为主。Fe位点与N2O的相互作用形成Fe(III)AO复合物的速度更快，这在400°C下模拟的原位反应条件下通过FeH-Z1中位于阳离子位点的Fe(II)离子几乎完全转化为Fe(III)AO复合物得到证实。蒸煮Fe-ZSM-5沸石导致Brønsted位点和裸露Fe(II)离子的浓度降低。相反，FeAAlASi超框架物种和Fe氧化物样颗粒中的Td配位Fe(III)离子成为主导。高浓度的容易还原的Fe(III)-oxo物种对于N2O分解的高活性至关重要。然而，无论分散Fe物种的个体浓度如何，丙烷/N2O反应都能实现高丙烯产率。沸石中质子位点的低浓度和小晶粒，不支持丙烯的寡聚化和多烯烃在孔隙中的积累，是Fe-ZSM-5上选择性氧化脱氢丙烷为丙烯的必要条件。Fe的氧化还原状态受反应条件影响。N2O分解的高活性需要容易还原的Fe(III)-oxo物种，而C3H8/N2O中高丙烯产率的实现与Fe物种的种群无关。低质子位点浓度和小晶粒，防止丙烯寡聚和多烯烃积累，是Fe-ZSM-5上选择性丙烷氧化脱氢制丙烯的必要条件。
