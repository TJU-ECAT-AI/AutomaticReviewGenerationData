The total amount of deposits was substantially lower for the steamed Fe-zeolites containing a higher portion of olefinic and oxygenate coke in comparison with the non-steamed zeolites, where aromatic coke predominated. The interaction of Fe site with N2O to form Fe(III)AO complex is faster, as evidenced by the nearly quantitative transformation of Fe(II) ions in the cationic sites of FeH-Z1 into Fe(III)AO complexes under simulated in situ reaction conditions at 400 C. Steaming of Fe-ZSM-5 zeolites results in a low concentration of Br√∏nsted sites and bare Fe(II) ions. Instead, Td-coordinated Fe(III) ions in the FeAAlASi extra-framework species and Fe-oxide-like particles become predominant. The high concentration of easily reducible Fe(III)-oxo species is crucial for high activity in N2O decomposition. However, high propene yield in propane/N2O reactions can be achieved regardless of the population of individual dispersed Fe species. Low concentration of protonic sites and small crystallites of zeolites, which do not support propene oligomerization and accumulation of polyolefins in the pores, are necessary conditions for selective oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propene over Fe-ZSM-5. The redox state of Fe is influenced by the reaction conditions. High activity in N2O decomposition requires easily reducible Fe(III)-oxo species, while high propene yield in C3H8/N2O is achieved regardless of the Fe species population.
