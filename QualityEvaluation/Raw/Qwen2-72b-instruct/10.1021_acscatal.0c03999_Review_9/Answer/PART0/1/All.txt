However, they deactivate due to coke formation. Steam activation is essential for superior catalytic performance, as the initial conversions of propane and N2O over calcined zeolites are much lower. The initial conversion and selectivity are similar in steam-activated iron zeolites, regardless of the host (MFI vs BEA), zeolite acidity (ZSM-5 vs silicalite), and iron content. The dynamics of the reaction, including deactivation behavior and coke formation, vary significantly. Coke likely forms from propene condensation, the main olefin produced. Ex-Fe-silicalite shows a lower deactivation rate than ex-FeBEA, with a continuous decline in propene yield correlating with a gradual increase in coke content. Ex-FeZSM-5 exhibits remarkable resistance to deactivation.
