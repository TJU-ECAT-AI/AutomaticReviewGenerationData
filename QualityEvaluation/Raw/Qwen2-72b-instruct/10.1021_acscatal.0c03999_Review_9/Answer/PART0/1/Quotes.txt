          [2] "Further studies show that Fe-ZSM-5 synthesized through solid-state ion exchange or liquid exchange methods also deliver good catalytic performance, showing C3H8 conversion between 20% and 60%, C3H6 selectivity between 25% and 70%, and C3H6 yield between 14% and 30% in the temperature range of 377 to 527 C."

[1] "Oxidation of propane with oxygen, nitrous oxide or oxygen together with nitrous oxide over ZSM-5 zeolites with low concentration of iron (301200 ppm) treated at various conditions was studied at 450 C."
          [2] "The highest conversion of propane (51.7%) and selectivity to propene (39.7%) and to the sum of aromatics and oxygenates (11.5%, mainly C1C3 alcohols) was achieved if a mixture of oxygen with nitrous oxide was used as oxidant over the steamed FeH-ZSM-5."
          [3] "Based on the ESR results this activity was ascribed to extra-framework Fe-oxo complexes generated by hydrolysis of framework SiOFe bonds followed by extraction of iron to extra-framework positions."
          [4] "The highest catalytic activity exhibit Fe-zeolites with the highest Fe content steamed in the flow of water vapor at 600 C."
          [5] "In addition to propene, other valuable products as ethene, methanol, ethanol and acetone are formed."

[1] "The selectivity and yield of propene were found to be the highest over Fe-ZSM-5 with low Al contents and reduced acidity."
          [2] "The initial propene yield over Fe-ZSM-5 was significantly higher than that of FeSiO2 since the presence of weak and/or medium acid sites together with oligonuclear iron species and iron oxides on the ZSM-5 are found to enhance the N2O activation."
          [3] "The coking of Fe-ZSM-5 catalysts could also be controlled by reduction of the surface acidity of ZSM-5 and by the use of O2 in addition to N2O as the oxidant."
          [4] "Fe-ZSM-5 zeolites prepared with solid-state method have been shown to have comparable activity and better stability towards coking compared with Fe-ZSM-5 zeolites prepared by liquid ion exchange and hydrothermal synthesis methods."

[1] "The steaming of FeH-zeolites, dramatically changing the structure of Fe species and resulting in that only approximately 20% of the Fe(II) species originally present (see Table 3), yielded a significant decrease in TOF to 30% of the original value (to 2.2  104 and 3.0  104 s1)."
          [2] "The initial (at TOS 5 min) TOFC3H8 of both FeH-ZSM-5 zeolites,regardless of the crystal size, were similar and exhibited similar decrease with TOS."
          [3] "The initial propene yields (and TOFC3H6) were substantially higher for the steamed zeolites compared to non-steamed ones, and moreover, much more stable values with TOS were found."
          [4] "The concentration and character of the accumulated hydrocarbon products in the pores of FeH- and Fe(H)-ZSM-5st zeolites after TOS of 240 min was estimated by the TPO of the spent catalyst (Table 8)."
          [5] "The total amount of deposits was substantially lower (23 times) for the steamed Fe-zeolites (even at a comparable amount of converted propane) containing a higher portion of olefinic and oxygenate coke (LTC) in comparison with the non-steamed zeolites, where aromatic coke (HTC) predominated."
          [6] "The finding that the interaction of Fe site with N2O yielding Fe(III)AO complex is faster is also proven here by the simulated in situ reaction conditions at 400 C (monitored by Mssbauer analysis at RT)."
          [7] "It showed nearly quantitative transformation of Fe(II) ions in the cationic sites of FeH-Z1 into Fe(III)AO complexes (75% of Fe ions, see Table 4)."
          [8] "The steamed Fe(H)-ZSM-5st zeolites were greatly reorganized, resulting in a low concentration of both the Brnsted sites and bare Fe(II) ions, and the Td-coordinated Fe(III) ions in the FeAAlASi extra-framework species (4347%) and Fe-oxide-like particles (3033%) prevailed."
          [9] "The redox state of Fe in both non-steamed and steamed Fe-ZSM-5 was strongly influenced by the reaction conditions of N2O decomposition and C3H8/N2O."
          [10] "Bare counter Fe(III)-oxo species easily reducible to Fe(II) is critical for high activity in N2O decomposition, whereas high yield of propene in C3H8/N2O is achieved regardless of population of the individual dispersed Fe species."
          [11] "The low concentration of protonic sites and small crystallites of zeolites, not supporting propene oligomerization, accumulation of polyolefins in the pores and their easy oxidation to CO/CO2, are necessary conditions for selective oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propene over Fe-ZSM-5."

Steam-activated Fe-zeolites (MFI and BEA) are efficient catalysts for the N2O-mediated oxidative dehydrogenation of propane, with ini- tial propylene yields up to 25% at 723 K, but deactivate as a result of coke formation.
          Steam activation is essential to achieve superior catalytic performances.
          The initial conversions of propane and N2O over the calcined zeolites were very low in comparison with the steamed zeolites.
          The initial conversion and selectivity were quite similar in the steam-activated iron zeolites, regardless of the host (MFI vs BEA), the acidic properties of the zeolite (ZSM-5 vs silicalite), and the catalyst constitution with respect to iron.
          The dynamics of the reaction (deactivation behavior and coke formation) are considerably different.
          Coke deposits likely originate by condensation of propene, the main olefin formed over all the catalysts investigated.
          The rate of deactivation over ex-Fe-silicalite was significantly lower than over ex-FeBEA; the continu- ous decline of the C3H6 yield over ex-Fe-silicalite is clearly connected with the more gradual increase of the coke con- tent, in contrast to ex-FeBEA.
          The remarkable behavior of ex-FeZSM-5 against deactivation deviates from the former iron zeolites.
          The higher activity and lower rate of deactivation of ex-H-ZSM-5 (170 ppm Fe) compared to ex-H-BEA (210 ppm Fe) draw parallels with the results obtained over ex-FeZSM-5 (0.67 wt% Fe) and ex-FeBEA (0.61 wt% Fe).

          [4] "Fe-ZSM-5 zeolites prepared with solid-state method have been shown to have comparable activity and better stability towards coking compared with Fe-ZSM-5 zeolites prepared by liquid ion exchange and hydrothermal synthesis methods."

[1] "The steaming of FeH-zeolites, dramatically changing the structure of Fe species and resulting in that only approximately 20% of the Fe(II) species originally present (see Table 3), yielded a significant decrease in TOF to 30% of the original value (to 2.2  104 and 3.0  104 s1)."
          [2] "The initial (at TOS 5 min) TOFC3H8 of both FeH-ZSM-5 zeolites,regardless of the crystal size, were similar and exhibited similar decrease with TOS."
          [3] "The initial propene yields (and TOFC3H6) were substantially higher for the steamed zeolites compared to non-steamed ones, and moreover, much more stable values with TOS were found."
          [4] "The concentration and character of the accumulated hydrocarbon products in the pores of FeH- and Fe(H)-ZSM-5st zeolites after TOS of 240 min was estimated by the TPO of the spent catalyst (Table 8)."
          [5] "The total amount of deposits was substantially lower (23 times) for the steamed Fe-zeolites (even at a comparable amount of converted propane) containing a higher portion of olefinic and oxygenate coke (LTC) in comparison with the non-steamed zeolites, where aromatic coke (HTC) predominated."
          [6] "The finding that the interaction of Fe site with N2O yielding Fe(III)AO complex is faster is also proven here by the simulated in situ reaction conditions at 400 C (monitored by Mssbauer analysis at RT)."
          [7] "It showed nearly quantitative transformation of Fe(II) ions in the cationic sites of FeH-Z1 into Fe(III)AO complexes (75% of Fe ions, see Table 4)."
          [8] "The steamed Fe(H)-ZSM-5st zeolites were greatly reorganized, resulting in a low concentration of both the Brnsted sites and bare Fe(II) ions, and the Td-coordinated Fe(III) ions in the FeAAlASi extra-framework species (4347%) and Fe-oxide-like particles (3033%) prevailed."
          [9] "The redox state of Fe in both non-steamed and steamed Fe-ZSM-5 was strongly influenced by the reaction conditions of N2O decomposition and C3H8/N2O."
          [10] "Bare counter Fe(III)-oxo species easily reducible to Fe(II) is critical for high activity in N2O decomposition, whereas high yield of propene in C3H8/N2O is achieved regardless of population of the individual dispersed Fe species."
          [11] "The low concentration of protonic sites and small crystallites of zeolites, not supporting propene oligomerization, accumulation of polyolefins in the pores and their easy oxidation to CO/CO2, are necessary conditions for selective oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propene over Fe-ZSM-5."

Steam-activated Fe-zeolites (MFI and BEA) are efficient catalysts for the N2O-mediated oxidative dehydrogenation of propane, with ini- tial propylene yields up to 25% at 723 K, but deactivate as a result of coke formation.
          Steam activation is essential to achieve superior catalytic performances.
          The initial conversions of propane and N2O over the calcined zeolites were very low in comparison with the steamed zeolites.
          The initial conversion and selectivity were quite similar in the steam-activated iron zeolites, regardless of the host (MFI vs BEA), the acidic properties of the zeolite (ZSM-5 vs silicalite), and the catalyst constitution with respect to iron.
          The dynamics of the reaction (deactivation behavior and coke formation) are considerably different.
          Coke deposits likely originate by condensation of propene, the main olefin formed over all the catalysts investigated.
          The rate of deactivation over ex-Fe-silicalite was significantly lower than over ex-FeBEA; the continu- ous decline of the C3H6 yield over ex-Fe-silicalite is clearly connected with the more gradual increase of the coke con- tent, in contrast to ex-FeBEA.
          The remarkable behavior of ex-FeZSM-5 against deactivation deviates from the former iron zeolites.
          The higher activity and lower rate of deactivation of ex-H-ZSM-5 (170 ppm Fe) compared to ex-H-BEA (210 ppm Fe) draw parallels with the results obtained over ex-FeZSM-5 (0.67 wt% Fe) and ex-FeBEA (0.61 wt% Fe).

[1] "An early work reported that iron-containing ZSM-5, synthesized by steam treatment of an isomorphously substituted zeolite framework, shows C3H8 conversion of 48%, N2O conversion of 96%, and C3H6 selectivity of 45% at 450 C."
          [2] "Further studies show that Fe-ZSM-5 synthesized through solid-state ion exchange or liquid exchange methods also deliver good catalytic performance, showing C3H8 conversion between 20% and 60%, C3H6 selectivity between 25% and 70%, and C3H6 yield between 14% and 30% in the temperature range of 377 to 527 C."

[1] "Oxidation of propane with oxygen, nitrous oxide or oxygen together with nitrous oxide over ZSM-5 zeolites with low concentration of iron (301200 ppm) treated at various conditions was studied at 450 C."
          [2] "The highest conversion of propane (51.7%) and selectivity to propene (39.7%) and to the sum of aromatics and oxygenates (11.5%, mainly C1C3 alcohols) was achieved if a mixture of oxygen with nitrous oxide was used as oxidant over the steamed FeH-ZSM-5."
          [3] "Based on the ESR results this activity was ascribed to extra-framework Fe-oxo complexes generated by hydrolysis of framework SiOFe bonds followed by extraction of iron to extra-framework positions."
          [4] "The highest catalytic activity exhibit Fe-zeolites with the highest Fe content steamed in the flow of water vapor at 600 C."
          [5] "In addition to propene, other valuable products as ethene, methanol, ethanol and acetone are formed."

          [8] "The steamed Fe(H)-ZSM-5st zeolites were greatly reorganized, resulting in a low concentration of both the Brnsted sites and bare Fe(II) ions, and the Td-coordinated Fe(III) ions in the FeAAlASi extra-framework species (4347%) and Fe-oxide-like particles (3033%) prevailed."
          [9] "The redox state of Fe in both non-steamed and steamed Fe-ZSM-5 was strongly influenced by the reaction conditions of N2O decomposition and C3H8/N2O."
          [10] "Bare counter Fe(III)-oxo species easily reducible to Fe(II) is critical for high activity in N2O decomposition, whereas high yield of propene in C3H8/N2O is achieved regardless of population of the individual dispersed Fe species."
          [11] "The low concentration of protonic sites and small crystallites of zeolites, not supporting propene oligomerization, accumulation of polyolefins in the pores and their easy oxidation to CO/CO2, are necessary conditions for selective oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propene over Fe-ZSM-5."

Steam-activated Fe-zeolites (MFI and BEA) are efficient catalysts for the N2O-mediated oxidative dehydrogenation of propane, with ini- tial propylene yields up to 25% at 723 K, but deactivate as a result of coke formation.
          Steam activation is essential to achieve superior catalytic performances.
          The initial conversions of propane and N2O over the calcined zeolites were very low in comparison with the steamed zeolites.
          The initial conversion and selectivity were quite similar in the steam-activated iron zeolites, regardless of the host (MFI vs BEA), the acidic properties of the zeolite (ZSM-5 vs silicalite), and the catalyst constitution with respect to iron.
          The dynamics of the reaction (deactivation behavior and coke formation) are considerably different.
          Coke deposits likely originate by condensation of propene, the main olefin formed over all the catalysts investigated.
          The rate of deactivation over ex-Fe-silicalite was significantly lower than over ex-FeBEA; the continu- ous decline of the C3H6 yield over ex-Fe-silicalite is clearly connected with the more gradual increase of the coke con- tent, in contrast to ex-FeBEA.
          The remarkable behavior of ex-FeZSM-5 against deactivation deviates from the former iron zeolites.
          The higher activity and lower rate of deactivation of ex-H-ZSM-5 (170 ppm Fe) compared to ex-H-BEA (210 ppm Fe) draw parallels with the results obtained over ex-FeZSM-5 (0.67 wt% Fe) and ex-FeBEA (0.61 wt% Fe).

[1] "An early work reported that iron-containing ZSM-5, synthesized by steam treatment of an isomorphously substituted zeolite framework, shows C3H8 conversion of 48%, N2O conversion of 96%, and C3H6 selectivity of 45% at 450 C."
          [2] "Further studies show that Fe-ZSM-5 synthesized through solid-state ion exchange or liquid exchange methods also deliver good catalytic performance, showing C3H8 conversion between 20% and 60%, C3H6 selectivity between 25% and 70%, and C3H6 yield between 14% and 30% in the temperature range of 377 to 527 C."

[1] "Oxidation of propane with oxygen, nitrous oxide or oxygen together with nitrous oxide over ZSM-5 zeolites with low concentration of iron (301200 ppm) treated at various conditions was studied at 450 C."
          [2] "The highest conversion of propane (51.7%) and selectivity to propene (39.7%) and to the sum of aromatics and oxygenates (11.5%, mainly C1C3 alcohols) was achieved if a mixture of oxygen with nitrous oxide was used as oxidant over the steamed FeH-ZSM-5."
          [3] "Based on the ESR results this activity was ascribed to extra-framework Fe-oxo complexes generated by hydrolysis of framework SiOFe bonds followed by extraction of iron to extra-framework positions."
          [4] "The highest catalytic activity exhibit Fe-zeolites with the highest Fe content steamed in the flow of water vapor at 600 C."
          [5] "In addition to propene, other valuable products as ethene, methanol, ethanol and acetone are formed."

[1] "The selectivity and yield of propene were found to be the highest over Fe-ZSM-5 with low Al contents and reduced acidity."
          [2] "The initial propene yield over Fe-ZSM-5 was significantly higher than that of FeSiO2 since the presence of weak and/or medium acid sites together with oligonuclear iron species and iron oxides on the ZSM-5 are found to enhance the N2O activation."
          [3] "The coking of Fe-ZSM-5 catalysts could also be controlled by reduction of the surface acidity of ZSM-5 and by the use of O2 in addition to N2O as the oxidant."
          [4] "Fe-ZSM-5 zeolites prepared with solid-state method have been shown to have comparable activity and better stability towards coking compared with Fe-ZSM-5 zeolites prepared by liquid ion exchange and hydrothermal synthesis methods."

[1] "The steaming of FeH-zeolites, dramatically changing the structure of Fe species and resulting in that only approximately 20% of the Fe(II) species originally present (see Table 3), yielded a significant decrease in TOF to 30% of the original value (to 2.2  104 and 3.0  104 s1)."
          [2] "The initial (at TOS 5 min) TOFC3H8 of both FeH-ZSM-5 zeolites,regardless of the crystal size, were similar and exhibited similar decrease with TOS."
          [3] "The initial propene yields (and TOFC3H6) were substantially higher for the steamed zeolites compared to non-steamed ones, and moreover, much more stable values with TOS were found."
          [4] "The concentration and character of the accumulated hydrocarbon products in the pores of FeH- and Fe(H)-ZSM-5st zeolites after TOS of 240 min was estimated by the TPO of the spent catalyst (Table 8)."
          [5] "The total amount of deposits was substantially lower (23 times) for the steamed Fe-zeolites (even at a comparable amount of converted propane) containing a higher portion of olefinic and oxygenate coke (LTC) in comparison with the non-steamed zeolites, where aromatic coke (HTC) predominated."
