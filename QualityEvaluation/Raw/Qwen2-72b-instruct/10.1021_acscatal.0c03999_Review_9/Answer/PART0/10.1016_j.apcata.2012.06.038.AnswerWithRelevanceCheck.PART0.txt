          [1] "The selectivity and yield of propene were found to be the highest over Fe-ZSM-5 with low Al contents and reduced acidity."
          [2] "The initial propene yield over Fe-ZSM-5 was significantly higher than that of FeSiO2 since the presence of weak and/or medium acid sites together with oligonuclear iron species and iron oxides on the ZSM-5 are found to enhance the N2O activation."
          [3] "The coking of Fe-ZSM-5 catalysts could also be controlled by reduction of the surface acidity of ZSM-5 and by the use of O2 in addition to N2O as the oxidant."
          [4] "Fe-ZSM-5 zeolites prepared with solid-state method have been shown to have comparable activity and better stability towards coking compared with Fe-ZSM-5 zeolites prepared by liquid ion exchange and hydrothermal synthesis methods."

          丙烯的选择性和产率在低铝含量和降低酸性的Fe-ZSM-5上最高。Fe-ZSM-5的初始丙烯产率显著高于FeSiO2，因为ZSM-5上的弱和/或中等酸性位点与寡核铁物种和铁氧化物的存在一起增强了N2O的活化。Fe-ZSM-5催化剂的焦化可以通过降低ZSM-5的表面酸性和使用O2作为N2O之外的氧化剂来控制。使用固态方法制备的Fe-ZSM-5沸石与使用液相离子交换和水热合成方法制备的Fe-ZSM-5沸石相比，具有可比的活性和更好的抗焦化稳定性。
