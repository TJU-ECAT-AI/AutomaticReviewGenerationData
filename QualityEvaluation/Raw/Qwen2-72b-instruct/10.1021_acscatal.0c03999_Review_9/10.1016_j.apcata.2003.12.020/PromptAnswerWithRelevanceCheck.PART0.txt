How do various synthesis methods (such as steam treatment, solid-state ion exchange, and liquid exchange) of iron-containing ZSM-5 zeolites influence their catalytic performance in the N2O-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reaction, and what are the key performance metrics (including C3H8 conversion, N2O conversion, C3H6 selectivity, and C3H6 yield) that demonstrate their effectiveness under different reaction conditions?

[1] "Oxidation of propane with oxygen, nitrous oxide or oxygen together with nitrous oxide over ZSM-5 zeolites with low concentration of iron (301200 ppm) treated at various conditions was studied at 450 C."
[2] "The highest conversion of propane (51.7%) and selectivity to propene (39.7%) and to the sum of aromatics and oxygenates (11.5%, mainly C1C3 alcohols) was achieved if a mixture of oxygen with nitrous oxide was used as oxidant over the steamed FeH-ZSM-5."
[3] "Based on the ESR results this activity was ascribed to extra-framework Fe-oxo complexes generated by hydrolysis of framework SiOFe bonds followed by extraction of iron to extra-framework positions."
[4] "The highest catalytic activity exhibit Fe-zeolites with the highest Fe content steamed in the flow of water vapor at 600 C."
[5] "In addition to propene, other valuable products as ethene, methanol, ethanol and acetone are formed."

1.The study investigated the oxidation of propane using oxygen, nitrous oxide, or a mixture of both over ZSM-5 zeolites with low iron concentration (30-1200 ppm) treated under various conditions at 450 C. The highest propane conversion (51.7%) and selectivity to propene (39.7%) and to the sum of aromatics and oxygenates (11.5%, mainly C1C3 alcohols) were achieved when a mixture of oxygen and nitrous oxide was used as the oxidant over the steamed FeH-ZSM-5. The activity was attributed to extra-framework Fe-oxo complexes generated by hydrolysis of framework SiOFe bonds followed by extraction of iron to extra-framework positions. Fe-zeolites with the highest Fe content steamed in the flow of water vapor at 600 C showed the highest catalytic activity. In addition to propene, other valuable products such as ethene, methanol, ethanol, and acetone were formed.

1.研究在450 C下，使用氧气、一氧化二氮或两者的混合物，对低铁浓度（30-1200 ppm）的ZSM-5沸石在不同条件下进行丙烷氧化。当使用氧气和一氧化二氮的混合物作为氧化剂时，过蒸FeH-ZSM-5的丙烷转化率（51.7%）和丙烯选择性（39.7%）以及芳香族和氧化物（11.5%，主要是C1C3醇）的总和最高。活性归因于框架SiOFe键的水解后铁提取到框架外位置生成的框架外Fe-氧复合物。在600 C的水蒸气流中蒸过的最高Fe含量的Fe沸石显示出最高的催化活性。除了丙烯，还形成了其他有价值的产物，如乙烯、甲醇、乙醇和乙酸。
