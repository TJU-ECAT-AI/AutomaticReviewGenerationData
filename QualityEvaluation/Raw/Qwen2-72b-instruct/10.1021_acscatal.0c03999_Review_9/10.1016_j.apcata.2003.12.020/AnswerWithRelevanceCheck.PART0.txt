          [1] "Oxidation of propane with oxygen, nitrous oxide or oxygen together with nitrous oxide over ZSM-5 zeolites with low concentration of iron (301200 ppm) treated at various conditions was studied at 450 C."
          [2] "The highest conversion of propane (51.7%) and selectivity to propene (39.7%) and to the sum of aromatics and oxygenates (11.5%, mainly C1C3 alcohols) was achieved if a mixture of oxygen with nitrous oxide was used as oxidant over the steamed FeH-ZSM-5."
          [3] "Based on the ESR results this activity was ascribed to extra-framework Fe-oxo complexes generated by hydrolysis of framework SiOFe bonds followed by extraction of iron to extra-framework positions."
          [4] "The highest catalytic activity exhibit Fe-zeolites with the highest Fe content steamed in the flow of water vapor at 600 C."
          [5] "In addition to propene, other valuable products as ethene, methanol, ethanol and acetone are formed."

          The study investigated the oxidation of propane using oxygen, nitrous oxide, or a mixture of both over ZSM-5 zeolites with low iron concentrations (30-1200 ppm) treated under various conditions at 450 C. The highest propane conversion (51.7%) and selectivity to propene (39.7%) and to the sum of aromatics and oxygenates (11.5%, mainly C1C3 alcohols) was achieved when a mixture of oxygen and nitrous oxide was used as the oxidant over the steamed FeH-ZSM-5. The catalytic activity was attributed to extra-framework Fe-oxo complexes generated by hydrolysis of framework SiOFe bonds followed by extraction of iron to extra-framework positions. Fe-zeolites with the highest Fe content steamed in the flow of water vapor at 600 C showed the highest catalytic activity. In addition to propene, other valuable products such as ethene, methanol, ethanol, and acetone were formed.

          该研究在450 C下，使用氧气、一氧化二氮或两者的混合物，对低铁浓度（30-1200 ppm）的不同条件下处理的ZSM-5沸石进行了丙烷氧化的研究。当使用氧气和一氧化二氮的混合物作为氧化剂时，在蒸煮的FeH-ZSM-5上，丙烷转化率（51.7%）和丙烯选择性（39.7%）以及芳香族化合物和氧化物（11.5%，主要是C1C3醇）的总和达到最高。催化活性归因于框架SiOFe键的水解后铁提取到框架外位置生成的框架外Fe-氧复合物。在600 C的水蒸气流中蒸煮的具有最高Fe含量的Fe沸石显示出最高的催化活性。除了丙烯，还形成了其他有价值的产物，如乙烯、甲醇、乙醇和乙酸。
