1.Steam-activated Fe-zeolites (MFI and BEA) are efficient catalysts for the N2O-mediated oxidative dehydrogenation of propane, achieving initial propylene yields up to 25% at 723 K. However, they deactivate due to coke formation. Steam activation is essential for superior catalytic performance, as the initial conversions of propane and N2O over calcined zeolites are much lower. The initial conversion and selectivity are similar in steam-activated iron zeolites, regardless of the host (MFI vs BEA), zeolite acidity (ZSM-5 vs silicalite), and iron content. The dynamics of the reaction, including deactivation behavior and coke formation, vary significantly. Coke likely forms from propene condensation, the main olefin produced. Ex-Fe-silicalite shows a lower deactivation rate than ex-FeBEA, with a continuous decline in propene yield correlating with a gradual increase in coke content. Ex-FeZSM-5 exhibits remarkable resistance to deactivation. The higher activity and lower deactivation rate of ex-H-ZSM-5 compared to ex-H-BEA parallel the results for ex-FeZSM-5 and ex-FeBEA.

1.蒸汽活化的Fe-沸石（MFI和BEA）是N2O介导的丙烷氧化脱氢的有效催化剂，在723 K时初始丙烯产率高达25%。然而，它们因焦炭形成而失活。蒸汽活化对于获得优异的催化性能至关重要，因为煅烧沸石上丙烷和N2O的初始转化率要低得多。在蒸汽活化的铁沸石中，初始转化率和选择性相似，无论宿主（MFI与BEA）、沸石酸性（ZSM-5与silicalite）和铁含量如何。反应的动力学，包括失活行为和焦炭形成，有显著差异。焦炭可能来自丙烯的凝结，这是所有催化剂研究中形成的主要烯烃。Ex-Fe-silicalite的失活速率明显低于ex-FeBEA，丙烯产量的持续下降与焦炭含量的逐渐增加相关。Ex-FeZSM-5表现出对失活的显著抵抗力。Ex-H-ZSM-5与ex-H-BEA相比，活性更高，失活速率更低，这与ex-FeZSM-5和ex-FeBEA的结果平行。
