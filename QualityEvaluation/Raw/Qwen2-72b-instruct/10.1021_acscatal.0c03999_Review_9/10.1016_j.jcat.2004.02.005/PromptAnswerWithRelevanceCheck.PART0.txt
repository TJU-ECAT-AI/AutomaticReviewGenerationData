How do various synthesis methods (such as steam treatment, solid-state ion exchange, and liquid exchange) of iron-containing ZSM-5 zeolites influence their catalytic performance in the N2O-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reaction, and what are the key performance metrics (including C3H8 conversion, N2O conversion, C3H6 selectivity, and C3H6 yield) that demonstrate their effectiveness under different reaction conditions?

[1] "Steam-activated Fe-zeolites (MFI and BEA) are efficient catalysts for the N2O-mediated oxidative dehydrogenation of propane, with ini- tial propylene yields up to 25% at 723 K, but deactivate as a result of coke formation."
[2] "A tapered element oscillating microbalance (TEOM) coupled to GC analysis has been applied to correlate activity and deactivation by simultaneous measurements of reaction and coking."
[3] "The presence of extraframework iron species, generated during steam treatment, is essential for producing active catalysts."
[4] "The nature and dis- tribution of extraframework iron species, the zeolite host, and the catalyst acidity have no significant effect on the initial propene yield, but strongly influence the deactivation behavior."
[5] "FeZSM-5 shows a remarkable resistance against deactivation, while a very rapid and complete deactivation occurred in FeBEA."
[6] "The initial propene yield over FeZSM-5 and FeBEA was remarkably higher than over commercial H-ZSM-5 and H-BEA (with 3040 times lower iron content), although the residual activities after 400 min on stream were very similar."

1.蒸汽活化的Fe-沸石（MFI和BEA）是有效的催化剂，用于N2O介导的丙烷氧化脱氢，初始丙烯产量在723 K时高达25%。然而，它们由于焦炭形成而失活。在蒸汽处理过程中生成的框架外铁物种对于产生活性催化剂至关重要。框架外铁物种的性质和分布，沸石宿主，以及催化剂的酸性对初始丙烯产量没有显著影响，但强烈影响失活行为。FeZSM-5显示出对失活的显著抵抗力，而FeBEA则发生了非常快速和完全的失活。FeZSM-5和FeBEA的初始丙烯产量明显高于商业H-ZSM-5和H-BEA（铁含量低30-40倍），尽管在流经400分钟后，残余活性非常相似。

Ex-Fe-silicalite shows a lower deactivation rate than ex-FeBEA, with a continuous decline in propene yield correlating with a gradual increase in coke content. Ex-FeZSM-5 exhibits remarkable resistance to deactivation. The higher activity and lower deactivation rate of ex-H-ZSM-5 compared to ex-H-BEA parallel the results for ex-FeZSM-5 and ex-FeBEA.
