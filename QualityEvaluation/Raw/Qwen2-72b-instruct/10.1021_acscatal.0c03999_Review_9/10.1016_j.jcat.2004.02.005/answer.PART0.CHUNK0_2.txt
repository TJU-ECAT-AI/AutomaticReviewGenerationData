1.Steam-activated Fe-zeolites (MFI and BEA) are efficient catalysts for the N2O-mediated oxidative dehydrogenation of propane, achieving initial propylene yields up to 25% at 723 K. However, they deactivate due to coke formation. Steam activation is essential for superior catalytic performance, as the initial conversions of propane and N2O over calcined zeolites are much lower. The initial conversion and selectivity are similar in steam-activated iron zeolites, regardless of the host (MFI vs BEA), the acidic properties of the zeolite (ZSM-5 vs silicalite), and the catalyst constitution with respect to iron. The dynamics of the reaction, including deactivation behavior and coke formation, vary significantly. Coke deposits likely originate from the condensation of propene, the main olefin formed over all the catalysts. The rate of deactivation over ex-Fe-silicalite is significantly lower than over ex-FeBEA, with a continuous decline in C3H6 yield over ex-Fe-silicalite connected to a more gradual increase in coke content. Ex-FeZSM-5 shows remarkable resistance to deactivation compared to other iron zeolites. The higher activity and lower rate of deactivation of ex-H-ZSM-5 (170 ppm Fe) compared to ex-H-BEA (210 ppm Fe) are similar to the results obtained over ex-FeZSM-5 (0.67 wt% Fe) and ex-FeBEA (0.61 wt% Fe).

1.蒸汽活化的Fe-沸石（MFI和BEA）是N2O介导的丙烷氧化脱氢的有效催化剂，在723 K时初始丙烯产量高达25%。然而，它们由于焦炭的形成而失活。蒸汽活化对于获得优越的催化性能是必不可少的，因为未活化的沸石的丙烷和N2O的初始转化率要低得多。在蒸汽活化的铁沸石中，初始转化率和选择性是相似的，无论宿主（MFI与BEA）、沸石的酸性性质（ZSM-5与硅酸盐）以及催化剂中铁的组成如何。反应的动力学，包括失活行为和焦炭形成，有显著差异。焦炭沉积物可能源于所有催化剂上形成的主烯烃丙烯的凝结。ex-Fe-silicalite的失活速率明显低于ex-FeBEA，ex-Fe-silicalite上C3H6产量的持续下降与焦炭含量的逐渐增加有关。与其它铁沸石相比，ex-FeZSM-5对失活表现出显著的抵抗力。ex-H-ZSM-5（170 ppm Fe）与ex-H-BEA（210 ppm Fe）相比，活性更高，失活速率更低，这与ex-FeZSM-5（0.67 wt% Fe）和ex-FeBEA（0.61 wt% Fe）的结果相似。
