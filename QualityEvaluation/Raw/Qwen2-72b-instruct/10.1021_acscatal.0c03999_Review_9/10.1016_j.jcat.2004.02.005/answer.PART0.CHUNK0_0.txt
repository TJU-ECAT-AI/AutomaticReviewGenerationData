1.Steam-activated Fe-zeolites (MFI and BEA) are efficient catalysts for the N2O-mediated oxidative dehydrogenation of propane, achieving initial propylene yields up to 25% at 723 K. However, they deactivate due to coke formation. The presence of extraframework iron species, generated during steam treatment, is essential for producing active catalysts. The nature and distribution of extraframework iron species, the zeolite host, and the catalyst acidity have no significant effect on the initial propene yield, but strongly influence the deactivation behavior. FeZSM-5 shows a remarkable resistance against deactivation, while a very rapid and complete deactivation occurred in FeBEA. The initial propene yield over FeZSM-5 and FeBEA was remarkably higher than over commercial H-ZSM-5 and H-BEA (with 30-40 times lower iron content), although the residual activities after 400 min on stream were very similar.

1.蒸汽活化的Fe-沸石（MFI和BEA）是有效的催化剂，用于N2O介导的丙烷氧化脱氢，初始丙烯产量在723 K时高达25%。然而，它们由于焦炭形成而失活。在蒸汽处理过程中生成的框架外铁物种对于产生活性催化剂至关重要。框架外铁物种的性质和分布，沸石宿主，以及催化剂的酸性对初始丙烯产量没有显著影响，但强烈影响失活行为。FeZSM-5显示出对失活的显著抵抗力，而FeBEA则发生了非常快速和完全的失活。FeZSM-5和FeBEA的初始丙烯产量明显高于商业H-ZSM-5和H-BEA（铁含量低30-40倍），尽管在流经400分钟后，残余活性非常相似。
