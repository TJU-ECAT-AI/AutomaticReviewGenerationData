[1] "An early work reported that iron-containing ZSM-5, synthesized by steam treatment of an isomorphously substituted zeolite framework, shows C3H8 conversion of 48%, N2O conversion of 96%, and C3H6 selectivity of 45% at 450 C."
[2] "Further studies show that Fe-ZSM-5 synthesized through solid-state ion exchange or liquid exchange methods also deliver good catalytic performance, showing C3H8 conversion between 20% and 60%, C3H6 selectivity between 25% and 70%, and C3H6 yield between 14% and 30% in the temperature range of 377 to 527 C."

1.Steam treatment of iron-containing ZSM-5 zeolites results in a C3H8 conversion of 48%, N2O conversion of 96%, and C3H6 selectivity of 45% at 450 degrees Celsius. Solid-state ion exchange or liquid exchange methods of synthesizing Fe-ZSM-5 also show good catalytic performance, with C3H8 conversion ranging from 20% to 60%, C3H6 selectivity from 25% to 70%, and C3H6 yield from 14% to 30% in the temperature range of 377 to 527 degrees Celsius.
