Introduction
ZSM-5
zeolites with low iron contents have shown remarkable activity and selectivity in the oxidative dehydrogenation
(ODH)
of propane with
N2O
[110] as well as in the hydroxylation of benzene [1115] and other hydrocarbons [11,16,17].  The activity and selectivity in
ODH
of propane
(ODHP)
can be related to the structure of the
ZSM-5,
the type of oxidant used,the speciation of the iron and the pre-treatment of the catalysts.
For example,it is clear that the acidbase properties of the
ZSM-5
are important parameters in the performance of these types of catalysts.
Nowin- ska et al. studied the influence of the acid site concentration on the selectivity and conversion of propane and ethane using
N2O
as the oxidant over Fe-ZSM-5 prepared by liquid phase ion exchange [9,10,17].
A
decrease in Brnsted acid sites via high temperature treatment,sodium doping and hydrothermal treatment resulted in an increase in the propene selectivity,a slight change in the Corresponding author.

distribution of the cracking products as well as a decrease in the alkane conversion.
In the presence of strong acid sites,both dehydrogenation and cracking reactions were reported to occur simultaneously whereas over medium/weak acid sites,the process was found to occur via consecutive reactions.
Teixeira-Neto et al. and Bandiera et al. reported that,while the
C
H
bond of propane is primarily activated on weak and medium acid sites and results in the production of olefins,
C
C
bonds are primarily activated on strong acid sites and lead to the production of cracking products [18,19].
In order to reduce the concentration of strong acid sites, Xu et al. investigated the performance of zeolite based catalysts with a range of Si/Al ratios for the dehydrogenation of propane [20].
They found that the activity in propane dehydrogenation decreased with increasing Si/Al ratio while the opposite trend was observed regard- ing the catalyst stability.
The enhanced stability with increasing Si/Al ratio was linked to the reduced acidity of the catalysts,leading to the suppression of side reactions such as cracking and oligomer- ization.
In contrast, Perez-Ramirez and Gallardo-Llamas reported that the initial propene yield over Fe-ZSM-5 and Fe-BEA prepared by hydrothermal synthesis was not affected by the catalyst acid- ity,the distribution of extra framework iron species or the zeolite structure [6].  They also reported that Fe-AlMFI and Fe-GaMFI had significantly higher stability in comparison to Fe-GeMFI and Fe-MFI with the former having 23 times higher acid site density [7].

General 441 442 (2012) 30 41 31 ion exchange may be due to the types of iron species formed in each case and the nature of the pre-treatments used,as discussed below.
Fe-ZSM-5 prepared by methods leading to extra-framework iron led to catalysts having higher activity for
N2O
decomposition and higher initial activity for
ODH
of propane with
N2O
compared with other methods of preparation.
These materials also showed lower resistance to deactivation.
The high initial activity may be due to the presence of isolated and oligonuclear iron species in the extra-framework iron catalysts [2124].  It has been proposed that the low stability could be improved by increasing the acid- ity [7] in contrast to ion exchange methods.
Catalysts prepared by the solid-state ion exchange method,as studied in detail by Lobree et al.
[25] have different active iron species such as large oxide clus- ters and small oxygen containing nanoclusters such as Fe4O4 and Fe3O4 [2528] as well as isolated iron species.
They reported that Fe3+ cations are exchanged with protons at the Brnsted acid sites on a one-to-one basis for an Fe/Al ratio of
0.56
and formed dis- persed cations such as Fe(OH)2+, Fe(OH)+ and FeO+. Additionally, Abu-Zied et al. reported that the solid-state ion exchange method has various advantages compared with other methods,such as the control of the metal loading,the possibility of exchanging multi- valent cations into the zeolite,the reproducibility,the control of crystallite size and the generation of different active sites [29].
The pre-treatment conditions have also been reported to have a significant effect on the activity and selectivity for the
ODH
of propane with
N2O.
These conditions have included high temper- ature calcination and/or steaming [3,4,9,10,2123,30].
The high temperature treatment and steaming have been reported to increase the amount of extra-framework iron species in Fe-ZSM- 5 prepared by hydrothermal method.
It has also been reported that the high temperature treatments increased the activity for
N2O
decomposition and
ODH
of propane with
N2O
of Fe-ZSM-5 catalysts prepared by ion exchange [4,30,31].
The type and concentration of oxidants have also been reported to affect the activity and selectivity of Fe-ZSM-5.
Monoatomic oxygen species
(O2,
O,
O)
are formed upon
N2O
activation,while polyatomic oxygen species ((O2)s,(O2)s,(O22)s) as well as monoatomic species are formed from O2 activation [32].
The
O
and/or monoatomic oxygen have been reported to be responsible for the
ODH
of propane over the iron species [46].
Nowin- ska et al. proposed that,upon
N2O
decomposition,the surface oxygen formed is responsible for the production of oxygenates such as acetaldehyde [4].  Perez-Ramirez et al. suggested that the monoatomic oxygen species are involved in the conversion of propane to propene [5,6].
While Fe-ZSM-5 catalysts prepared by hydrothermal or ion exchange methods have been studied extensively for the
ODH
with
N2O
reaction,similar catalysts prepared by solid-state exchange have only been the subject of a limited number of investiga- tions.
To the best of our knowledge,alkane dehydrogenation reactions have only been reported using Zn, Mo and Co mod- ified
ZSM-5
catalysts prepared by solid state methods [33].
In this case,propane aromatization was reported and demonstrated that highly active catalysts could be formed via solid-state ion exchange.
The present study compares,for the first time,a series of iron containing zeolites with varying Si/Al ratios (11.5140) and low iron content (0.9 wt.% Fe) synthesised by solid-state ion exchange using commercially available zeolites for the dehydro- genation of propane following low temperature,high temperature or steam treatments.
All catalysts were characterised by
XRD,
N2-Adsorption,
NH3-TPD
and DR-UVvis spectroscopy in order to determine the impact of the various treatment and the Si/Al ratio on the nature of the iron species present and the acidity of these catalysts and clarify their impact on the activity and selectivity for
ODHP.

Catalysts preparation
A
range
of
parent
zeolites
(NH4-ZSM-5)
with
varying Si/Al ratio were used in this study (Zeoliyst,

CBV28014,
Si/Al = 140; Sd-Chemie,

A
series of Fe/SiO2 reference catalysts were also prepared.
The silica support was obtained from Merck (medium pore size:60
A,
particle size:
0.0630.200
mm).
The pre-treatment of the silica and the deposition of the iron were undertaken using the procedures described by Ananieve and Reitzmann [34].
The iron was deposited on all the zeolites by a solid-state technique using FeCl2·4H2O as the iron precursor at atmospheric pressure and
550 C,
as described elsewhere [31].
The ammonia form of the zeolites was mixed with the iron precursor using a mortar and pestle under ambient conditions.
All the samples had a nominal iron loading of
1.0
wt.%.
The physical mixture was heated up to
550 C
over 3 h and maintained at this temperature in air for 6 h.
Thereafter,the samples were cooled to room temperature,washed thoroughly with deionised water,dried at
120 C
and cal- cined at
600 C
in air for 1 h.
The samples are denoted as follows throughout the text: SMxFey or ZxFey,where
SM
and
Z
denote the zeolite supplier
(Z:
Zeoliyst and
SM:
Sd-Chemie) and x and y indi- cate the SiO2/Al2O3 ratio and wt.% of Fe,respectively.
The FeSiO2 catalysts were prepared by wet impregnation of the silica support with a solution of Fe(III) acetylacetonate (Aldrich) in toluene at ambient temperature and atmospheric pressure for 15 h.
The sol- vent was then evaporated and the sample was dried and calcined in air at
600 C
for 5 h.
Three FeSiO2 catalysts were prepared by this method with iron contents of
0.1,
0.67
and
0.90
wt.%.
Before testing,the iron loaded silica was shaped by extrusion with Ludox
(AS-40,
Du Pont) and hydroxyl-ethylene-cellulose and the resulting extrudates were crushed and sieved to 250500 m particles.
2.2.
Characterisation of the catalysts The chemical composition of the catalysts was measured using
ICP.
Powder X-ray diffraction
(XRD)
was performed on a PANalyt- ical XPert Pro X-ray diffractrometer using Cu
K
radiation,with a
0.017step
size at room temperature and the spectra were recorded over a 2 range of
565. Diffuse
reflectance ultravioletvisible spectroscopy (DR-UVvis) measurements were performed at
30 C
and
400 C
after each treatment,using a Lambda
650S
UV-vis spec- trophotometer equipped with a Harrick high temperature reaction chamber and an integrating sphere detector.
