The reaction between C3H8 and N2O over steam-activated
FeMFI zeolites leads to high yields towards propene (24%)
and propionaldehyde (6%) at 773–798 K.
A challenging approach in oxidation catalysis is the functional-
isation of lower alkanes towards olefins and oxygenates. Due to
increasing demand for propene, the catalytic oxidative dehydro-
genation of propane (ODP) has attracted attention as an
alternative route for propene production compared to the
conventional cracking and dehydrogenation processes. Promis-
ing catalysts are based on molybdenum and vanadium oxides,
with propene yields in the range of 10–20%.1 Exceptionally,
higher propene yields have been reported over V–Mg–O
catalysts (24%),2 K/Mo catalyst supported on Si–Ti mixed
oxides (30%),3 and Ba-promoted Ni–Mo–O catalysts (30%),
using O2 as the oxidant.4
The application of Fe-zeolites in oxidative transformations
with N2O was triggered by the accomplishments in hydroxyla-
tion of paraffins to alcohols and of aromatic hydrocarbons to
phenols.5 Our strategy is to utilize the specificity of N2O as a
monooxygen donor and the capability of determined Fe species
in the zeolite for coordinating a-oxygen to develop efficient
catalysts for valorisation of propane and N2O via oxidative
conversions. Previous studies have reported high selectivities of
MFI frameworks with iron towards oxidative dehydrogenation
of light alkanes with N2O and O2 at a low degree of hydrocarbon
conversions (2–10%), thus achieving a low yield of the olefin
( < 10%).6,7 As in many other related studies, diluted mixtures
of the alkane and oxidizing agent were used, which restricts any
realistic conclusion on the potential application of these
catalytic materials.
We report for the first time the superior performance of
steam-activated FeMFI zeolites in ODP with N2O. Initial
propene yields up to 24% are comparable with the highest
values reported over V and Mo oxides with O2. In addition,
remarkable yields towards propionaldehyde (up to 6%) have
been obtained.
Details on the preparation of steam-activated FeMFI zeolites
have been described elsewhere.8,9 The isomorphously substi-
tuted zeolites, with Fe–Al–Si and Fe–Si frameworks, were
calcined and activated in steam (30 vol.% H2O in 30 ml (STP)
min21 of N2 flow) at 873 K during 5 h, yielding FeZSM-5 (Si/
Al = 31 and 0.67 wt.% Fe) and Fe-silicalite (Si/Al ~ H and
0.68 wt.% Fe). Commercial NH4-ZSM-5 (CBV 8020, Si/Al =
37.5 and 220 ppm Fe) was calcined and steamed according to
the procedure described above. Catalytic activity was measured
at 723–798 K in a fixed-bed quartz reactor (6 mm id) under near
isothermal conditions, using 50 mg of catalyst diluted with 150
mg of SiO2 (both 125–200 mm), and contact times in the range
of t = 0.043–0.097 s gcat ml21 at atmospheric pressure. The
feed consisted of 10 vol.% C3H8 and 10 vol.% N2O in Ne. The
product gases were analysed by GC (HP 5890) using Poraplot Q
and Molsieve 5 columns.
The catalytic performance of the steam-activated zeolites in
the ODP reaction is shown in Table 1 and Fig. 1. The values in
Table 1 correspond to the analysis of reaction products after 15
min on stream, denoted hereafter as initial activity. At all the
temperatures investigated propene was the main olefin, with
yields as high as 24% at 798 K. At similar degrees of propane
conversion, the propene selectivity over FeZSM-5 was higher
than over Fe-silicalite. N2O conversion ranged from ca. 45 to
95%, increasing with temperature and contact time. A similar
but less pronounced increase from ca. 30 to 52% was observed
for C3H8 conversion. The increase in propane conversion was
accompanied by a decrease in propene selectivity, from ca. 59
to 44%. Propionaldehyde (CH3CH2CHO) was the main oxy-
genate formed, with yields up to 6%. No significant dependence
was found between the selectivity to propionaldehyde and the
degree of propane conversion, suggesting that this oxygenate is
a primary (stable) product of the ODP reaction. This result is
notable, since a-oxygen (from N2O) in Fe-zeolites has been
typically found to be active for dehydrogenation or insertion
into a C–H bond, forming the corresponding alcohol.5–7 In our
experiments, very low concentrations of alcohols were found.
Methane, ethylene, acetone, and acrolein, as well as CO and
CO2 were reaction products too. The carbon balance in Table 1
indicates that other (non-identified) products in concentrations
< 0.1 vol.% were also formed, including coke deposits on the
catalyst. Steam-activated commercial H-ZSM-5, containing
220 ppm Fe, showed a rather low but measurable activity at 723

a Selectivity and yield were calculated as S(i) = Y(i)/X(C3H8) and Y(i) = C(i)/Co(C3H8), respectively, where X(C3H8) is the conversion of propane and
Co(C3H8) is the inlet concentration of propane.

and 773 K, with propene yields < 10% and traces of
propionaldehyde. The relatively low yield of these products
over steamed H-ZSM-5 strongly supports that iron is predom-
inantly responsible for the observed performance, as concluded
in other N2O conversions over Fe-zeolites, e.g. direct decom-
position or selective oxidation of benzene to phenol.5,9,10
Fig. 1 shows the yield of the iron zeolites vs. time-on-stream
at different temperatures. The conversion of C3H8 and N2O
continuously declines in a period of 100 min, due to coke
formation. As a consequence, the high initial yield towards
propene and propionaldehyde progressively decreases. The rate
of deactivation over FeZSM-5 is significantly lower at 723 K
than at higher temperatures, in agreement with the decreased
carbon balance upon increasing temperature in Table 1. Fe-
silicalite is very sensitive to deactivation, even at 723 K. Both
catalysts completely recovered the initial activity at all the
temperatures after pretreatment in pure oxygen at 773 K for 30
min. This was checked upon by repetition of five successive
ODP-reaction and O2-regeneration cycles.
From the results above, it can be concluded FeZSM-5 is more
active and selective than Fe-silicalite. However, the difference
in performance between both catalysts is marginal if their
constitution with respect to iron is taken into account. Steam-
activated Fe-silicalite does not show any sign of iron associa-
tion, and the majority of extraframework iron species are
uniform and well isolated, with a small fraction of iron in
framework positions.11 In contrast, significant iron clustering
was observed in steam-activated FeZSM-5, where extraframe-
work isolated iron ions and oligonuclear species in the zeolite
channels coexist with iron oxide nanoparticles of 1–2 nm.8,9
Our results suggest that the markedly different nature and
distribution of extraframework iron species in the steam-
activated catalysts does not have a strong influence on the initial
ODP performance. This observation contrasts with the active
site structure sensitivity exhibited by these catalysts in other
N2O conversions, including direct decomposition and SCR with
CO and C3H8 in diluted feed mixtures.11 The observed
behaviour could be attributed to the different intrinsic mecha-
nism of these processes: in direct N2O decomposition or SCR of
N2O, removal of atomic oxygen from the catalyst surface is rate
determining,12 while propane activation determines the rate of
the ODP reaction. What is clear from our results is that
extraframework iron species in FeMFI catalysts are active and
selective towards propene in ODP with N2O. In contrast, Uddin
et al.6 claimed that only framework iron of silicalite is selective
towards the olefin in the ODP with O2. The similar initial
performance of the Fe-zeolites also indicates that Brønsted and
Lewis acidity in steam-activated FeZSM-5 plays a minor role in
the N2O-mediated ODP reaction. The faster deactivation over
Fe-silicalite compared to FeZSM-5 is remarkable, especially at
723 K (see Fig. 1). The acidity in FeZSM-5 should in principle
accelerate the deactivation process due to coke formation, while
the opposite was observed. This is tentatively attributed to the
presence of mesopores in FeZSM-5, due to dealumination upon
steam treatment, which are absent in Fe-silicalite.8,9 The more
open structure of FeZSM-5 may reduce pore blocking by coke
and also improve transport of reactants and products, retarding
deactivation.
Our results show that steam-activated FeMFI zeolites are
highly efficient catalysts for oxidative dehydrogenation of C3H8
with N2O using high partial reactant pressures. Initial propene
yields of 21–24% at 773–798 K are very similar to state-of-the-
art catalysts based on V and Mo oxides with O2. Over vanadia-
based catalysts, N2O is a less effective oxidant than O2 to obtain
high propene yields,13 corroborating the superior performance
of FeMFI with N2O. Another feature of FeMFI relates to the
high propionaldehyde yield, since this product has been never
observed in ODP over typical oxide systems.
This novel application of FeMFI leads to the simultaneous
functionalisation of propane, a relatively cheap and abundant
feedstock, and utilisation of N2O, an environmentally harmful
gas. This concept can be economically applied in tail-gases of
specific chemical processes, e.g. those using HNO3 as oxidizing
agent, where N2O is produced in high concentration (typically
25–40 vol.%). This approach has been proposed for the
selective oxidation of benzene to phenol with N2O in tail-gases
from adipic acid plants.5 An apparent drawback of steam-
activated FeMFI catalysts in ODP is the rapid deactivation by
coke. This issue can be easily overcome, since the initial
performance is completely recovered after oxygen pretreatment
at 773 K. The practical realisation of this process in continuous
mode can be accomplished using a configuration of two reactors
in parallel with alternating reaction–regeneration. Investiga-
tions in such a system are on the way.
