Abstract
The N2O decomposition activity of the Fe-ZSM-5 catalysts, prepared by chemical vapor deposition (CVD) and aqueous ion exchange (IE), was
studied after steaming and high temperature treatment at 1218 K (HT) and compared with the activity of the corresponding non-steamed catalysts
after pretreatment at 873 K. FTIR spectra showed that dehydroxylation and/or dealumination took place during steaming and high temperature
treatment of the catalysts, which leads to the formation of oxygen vacancies (i.e. lattice defect). These lattice defects leads to a change in electronic
properties of the iron sites, which are associated with electron withdrawing Al Lewis centers. The iron sites in close proximity of defects are
responsible for the initial higher N2O decomposition (transient activity) of the steamed and HT catalysts. The increase in steady-state activity over
steamed and HT catalysts can be mainly attributed to an increase in the number of active sites created by autoreduction of the iron centers during
steaming and high temperature treatment. The above-mentioned trends are valid for both CVD and IE samples.

1. Introduction
Fe-ZSM-5 is considered as an interesting catalyst for the
decomposition of N2O, oxidation of benzene to phenol, and
selective catalytic reduction of NOx by ammonia. The activity
of the catalyst increases after various treatments of the catalyst
at high temperatures. High temperature calcination [1–3] and/
or steaming [4–8], and pretreatment in inert gas [9,10], in H2
[11] or in vacuum [3] are the most common ways to increase the
activity of the Fe-ZSM-5 catalysts. The efﬁciency of different
media
increases
in
the
sequence
air < vacuum  inert
gas < H2 < steam [3]. The question why the pretreatments
increase the concentration of active sites and/or the associated
reaction pathways [12] remains, as to date, unanswered. The
positive effect of steaming and high temperature calcination
was ﬁrst observed for the Fe-ZSM-5 samples prepared by
hydrothermal synthesis, which contained Fe in the MFI
framework [1,13]. The positive effect of the pretreatment at
high temperature was therefore ascribed to the extraction of Fe
from an inactive framework position to an active extra-
framework position. Later, a positive effect of pretreatments at
high temperature was also observed for the samples prepared by
ion exchange, which already contained Fe at extra-framework
positions [10–15]. The effect of the pretreatments at high
temperature is therefore not limited to the extraction of
framework Fe. Numerous studies have attempted to explain
what happens during the treatment at high temperatures. Kustov
et al. provided evidence that the dehydroxylation of Brønsted
acid sites at high temperature generates Lewis acid–base pairs,
which activate N2O [2]. According to their work Fe is not
involved in the reaction. In view of the overwhelming body of
evidence that has meanwhile been collected in support the role
of Fe in the activation of N2O [16,17], this position cannot be
upheld any more. If Lewis acidic Al sites are to be involved in
the reaction, they must act in combination with Fe. Kauky et al.
took up this idea and suggested that an electron-accepting Al
Lewis site (created by dehydroxylation at high temperature) in
the vicinity of Fe enhances the activity of the latter [18].
For steamed catalysts, slightly different explanations have
been forwarded. Hensen et al. suggest that extraframework

Fe–O–Al species are formed by a local amorphisation of the
framework
[19,20].
The
most
striking
evidence
is
the
observation that the impregnation of a purely siliceous silicalite
sample with a mixture of Fe(NO3)3 and Al(NO3)3 followed by
treatment at high temperatures generates an active catalyst for
benzene hydroxylation [21]. The theory of extra-framework
Fe–O–Al species is also supported by other groups [22–24]. In
contrast, Centi and co-workers claim that hydroxyl nests
created by dealumination of the MFI framework play an
important role in the reaction [25,26].
Yuranov et al. presented a very interesting comparison of the
effect
of
steaming
and
dehydroxylation
at
very
high
temperatures (1323 K) [27]. They found that behavior of
steamed and dehydroxylated samples in N2O decomposition
was qualitatively different and attributed the difference to the
formation of mono and bi/oligonuclear iron species by the two
methods, respectively. Unfortunately, no spectroscopic char-
acterisation data could be provided to support this argument.
The objective of the present work is to contribute to the
ongoing discussion on the effect of high temperature treatment
on the catalytic behavior of Fe-ZSM-5. We compare the effect
of three different treatments in detail: mild dehydroxylation at
873 K in inert gas, severe dehydroxylation at 1200 K, and
steaming. The study was carried out on catalysts prepared by
chemical vapor deposition of FeCl3 (CVD) or by aqueous ion
exchange. On these samples the effects of the high temperature
treatments are not ‘‘polluted’’ by the parallel extraction of
framework Fe. For studying the catalytic behavior of the
samples in N2O decomposition, transient response experiments
on isotopically labelled catalysts were used. Our results show
that the autoreduction of the Fe sites, which increases with
increasing pre-treatment temperature [10,28,29], can provide a
rather trivial explanation for the positive effect of the high
temperature treatment, without the need to invoke structural
changes in the catalyst.
2. Experimental
2.1. Preparation of catalysts
The NH4-ZSM-5 zeolites were obtained from the parent Na-
ZSM-5 zeolites (Zeochem, PZ 2-40, Si/Al = 25) by threefold
ion
exchange with
a
1 M
NH4NO3
solution
at
room
temperature. The NH4-ZSM-5 was calcined in O2 (heating
rate 1 K/min) at 773 K to convert it into H-ZSM-5.
The iron exchange was carried out by chemical vapor
deposition (CVD) of anhydrous FeCl3 on H-ZSM-5 in a ﬂow of
N2 at 593 K, as described elsewhere [10] and calcined in a ﬂow
of O2 at 773 K (1 K/min) for 2 h. This sample is called Fe-
ZSM-5 CVD (4.5 wt% Fe). In the second method, the iron
exchange was carried out by aqueous ion exchange (IE) of
NH4-ZSM-5 with the iron salt FeCl2*4H2O. About 2 g of NH4-
ZSM-5 was suspended in 40–50 ml of water. To avoid oxidation
of Fe2+–Fe3+, the zeolite suspension was degassed with N2
before adding the iron salt. Then the iron salt was added to the
suspension and the solution was reﬂuxed for 5 h at 353 K. After
that the solid was ﬁltered, washed with water, dried at 383 K
and calcined in air at 773 K for 5 h. This sample is referred as
Fe-ZSM-5 IE (0.4 wt% Fe).
Steaming of the calcined sample was performed at a vapor
pressure of 30 kPa, a temperature of 873 K (heating rate 10 K/
min), for 5 h. The sufﬁx ‘st’ is used to indicate that the sample
was steamed. The high temperature treatment of the Fe-ZSM-5
IE catalyst was carried out at 1218 K (10 K/min) in a ﬂow of He
for 2 h. This sample is referred as Fe-ZSM-5 IE-HT.
2.2. Catalyst characterization
Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the parent and
iron loaded zeolites after various treatments were recorded
from 5 to 508 2Q on a STOE DARMSTAD powder
diffractometer
using
Cu
Ka
radiation
and
Ge
(1 1 1)
monochromator at a step size of 0.038. The powder samples
were introduced into a 0.3 mm diameter capillary, which was
rotated continuously during the measurement. The diffuse
reﬂectance UV–vis spectra were measured at room temperature
on a Cary 400 Scan UV–vis spectrometer (Varian) equipped
with a Praying Mantis sample stage from Harrick. BaSO4 was
used as a reference. Infrared (FTIR) spectra were recorded in
transmission mode at 473 K on a Bio-Rad Excalibur FTS 3000
IR spectrometer equipped with a MCT detector at a resolution
of 4 cm1. Samples were pressed in self-supported pellets of 3–
5 mg and degassed at 673 K in He in order to remove adsorbed
water. The spectra were then recorded in transmission mode at
473 K; 128 scans were accumulated at a resolution of 4 cm1.
The spectra were normalized using the intensities of the
overtone bands of the T–O–T lattice vibrations at 1874 and
1990 cm1.
2.3. Steady-state N2O decomposition
The steady-state N2O decomposition activity was measured
after pretreatment of the catalyst at either 773 or 873 K in He
for 1 h. An amount of 50 mg palletized catalyst (mesh size 250–
300 mm) was ﬁrst treated in a ﬂow of 10% O2 in He at 673 K to
remove adsorbed impurities and subsequently heated to 773 or
873 K in He. Finally, the catalyst was cooled to 573 K in He and
2500 ppm N2O in He was fed to the catalyst. The ﬂow over the
reactor was kept at 50 mlNTP/min, corresponding to a gas hour
space velocity (GHSV) of 40,000 h1. The decomposition of
N2O was followed for 30 min at each temperature before
increasing the temperature by 25–50 K, up to a maximum
temperature of 823 K. Gas chromatography was used to detect
N2, N2O, and O2. The product gases were analyzed three times
at one temperature and an average value was taken for the
evaluation of the activity data. The ﬁrst order rate constant (k)
and the activation energy (Ea) were calculated from the
following equations:
k ¼ lnð1  xÞF
mcat p
(1)
Ea ¼ @ðln kÞ
@ð1=TÞ
(2)

227
where x is the conversion, F is the total ﬂow through the reactor,
p is the total pressure, mcat is the amount of the catalyst and T is
the temperature. The activation energy was determined from an
Arrhenius plot (Eq. (2)). Depending on the temperature range
chosen for its determination, Ea may vary by 10 kJ/mol. This
value may be considered as the error margin of Ea.
2.4. Step response experiments on isotopically labeled
catalysts
Step response experiments were carried out on isotopically
labeled catalysts. Fifty milligrams of pelletized catalyst was
ﬁrst treated in a ﬂow to 10% O2 in He at 673 K in order to
remove adsorbed impurities. For the incorporation of 18O into
the Fe-ZSM-5 sample, the catalyst was reduced in a mixture of
20% H2 in He at 673 K for 1 h. This leads to a complete
reduction to Fe2+ [30]. The step response of the catalyst was
carried out after pretreatment at either 673 or 873 K in He.
Pretreatment at 673 K was performed as follows: The reduced
catalyst was reoxidized at 673 K with 1% 18O2 (93% 18O,
Eurisotop) in He for 1 h. Then, the catalyst was ﬂushed with He
for 10 min at 673 K before step to N2O. Pretreatment at 873 K
was performed as follows: After 30 min at 673 K in a ﬂow of
1% 18O2 in He, the catalyst was heated to 873 K (heating rate
6 K/min) in the same ﬂow and kept in 18O2 for 5 min and then
for another 1 h or 10 min (for Fe-ZSM-5 IE-HT catalyst) in He
at 873 K. Finally the catalyst was cooled to 673 K in He. Then,
a step to 5000 ppm N2O in He was performed.
The gas ﬂow rate over the reactor was always kept at
25 mlNTP/min, corresponding to GHSV of 20,000 h1. The
reaction products were analyzed using a quadrupole mass
spectrometer. The masses m/e = 4 (He), 28 (N2 and N2O), 32
(16O2), 34 (16O18O), 36 (18O2), 44 (N2
16O), and 46 (N2
18O)
were monitored (time resolution 4 s). He (m/e = 4) was used
as a reference in the calibration. The ion current or signal of
each mass fragment was converted into a concentration by
using calibration factors. The step experiments were corrected
for the dead time of the system, which is 35 s.
The degree of isotope exchange was monitored via the
fraction of 18O in the product O2, 18f = ([16O18O] + 2*[18O2])/
(2*[O2,tot]). The value of the equilibrium constant of the isotope
exchange reaction 16O2 + 18O2 $ 2 16O18O, Ke = [16O18O]2/
([16O2]*[18O2]), was also computed. If Ke = 4, the distribution
of isotopes in O2 is statistical, i.e. there is a complete
equilibration of the oxygen atoms.
2.5. FTIR of NO adsorption
The infrared spectra after NO adsorption of self-supporting
wafers (3–5 mg) were recorded at room temperature on a
Mattson Galaxy 6020 IR spectrometer with a MCT detector at a
resolution of 4 cm1. The samples were pretreated in situ in
20 mbar O2 at 673 K for 1 h followed by treatment in vacuum
(pressurewas lower than 106 mbar) for another 1 h at either 673
or 873 K. Then the samples were cooled to room temperature in
vacuo, followed by room temperature exposure to 5 mbar NO for
30 min. The spectra were recorded at room temperature.
3. Results
3.1. X-ray diffraction (XRD)
Powder XRD measurements were performed in order to
check the crystallinity and topology of ZSM-5 after calcination,
steaming, and high temperature treatment of the catalysts.
Fig. 1 compares the XRD patterns of the parent, Fe-ZSM-5 IE,
Fe-ZSM-5 IE-st, and Fe-ZSM-5 IE-HT samples. As can be seen
from Fig. 1, all samples maintain the characteristic pattern of
the MFI topology. Neither steaming nor treatment in He at
1218 K lead to a measurable decrease in crystallinity. If
structural changes took place they must be very much localized
and randomly distributed. Also formation of Fe2O3 clusters
(major reﬂections expected at 2Q = 33.2 and 35.78) was not
observed.
3.2. UV–vis spectroscopy
Fig. 2 compares the UV–vis spectra of Fe-ZSM-5 CVD after
steaming and calcination. In the spectrum of the Fe-ZSM-5
CVD catalyst the two typical oxygen-to-iron ligand-to-metal
charge transfer (LMCT) bands at 44,000 and 37,000 cm1
dominate. The shoulder at 28,000 cm1 is attributed to the
presence of oligomeric iron species [31]. The UV–vis spectrum
of the corresponding steamed sample (Fe-ZSM-5 CVD-st) is
signiﬁcantly broadened and lower in intensity, indicating the
presence of highly distorted and inhomogeneous iron clusters
[32]. The appearance of a band at 20,000 cm1 in the steamed
sample is due to the formation of Fe2O3 clusters. The Fe-ZSM-
5 IE catalyst also shows the two ligand-to-metal charge transfer
(LMCT) bands around 37,000 and 44,000 cm1, but no
absorption was observed at lower frequencies, which could
be attributed to clustered iron species. Fe-ZSM-5 IE contains
isolated Fe3+ species [33,34] or weakly coupled dimers [31].
After steaming and high temperature treatment the LMCT
bands are broadened and their intensity is reduced. The
broadening of the LMCT bands indicates a large spread of the
energy levels of the metal 3d electrons, i.e., highly distorted and

inhomogeneous coordination environments of the iron sites.
The decrease in intensity is generally ascribed to the reduction
of the Fe3+ sites to Fe2+ [35,36]. No strong absorption around
28,000 cm1 was observed, i.e. no clustering of the iron sites
took place during steaming and high temperature treatment of
the catalyst.
3.3. FTIR spectroscopy
The FTIR spectra of non-steamed (i.e. calcined), steamed,
and high temperature treated Fe-ZSM-5 IE samples in the O–H
stretching region are shown in Fig. 3. Bands at 3740 and
3605 cm1 in the non-steamed sample (Fe-ZSM-5 IE) are
attributed to external silanol and Brønsted OH groups,
respectively. A weak band at 3660 cm1 was observed and
assigned to the OH groups connected to extraframework Al.
Also Fe–OH groups may contribute to this band [37]. After
steaming, the intensity of the Brønsted hydroxyl band
decreased signiﬁcantly. The decrease in the intensity of the
Brønsted OH groups after steaming of the Fe-ZSM-5 sample
was reported earlier [7,38] and related to framework deal-
umination of the sample.
After treatment at 1218 K (Fe-ZSM-5 IE-HT), the intensity
of the Brønsted hydroxyl band (at 3605 cm1) decreased
signiﬁcantly compared to the corresponding calcined catalyst.
The intensity of the extraframework Al–OH groups (3660–
3675 cm1) increased after high temperature treatment, due to
the migration of Al from the framework to extraframework
positions. Also Hensen et al. observed a partial dealumination
after calcination at 973 K of the Fe-ZSM-5 catalyst prepared by
sublimation of FeCl3 [6,14]. Sobolev et al. found that increasing
the calcination temperature from 823 to 1173 K leads to a six-
fold decrease in the concentration of Brønsted hydroxyl groups
for the H-ZSM-5 with low iron content [1]. The decrease in
intensity of the Brønsted hydroxyl band could be due to
dealumination (Scheme 1) and/or due to dehydroxylation
(Scheme 2) of the zeolite lattice [39,40]. Note that the
dehydroxylation of the zeolite lattice is associated with the
formation of oxygen vacancies, which are obviously more
sensitive to rehydroxylation during exposure to air.
3.4. Activity in steady-state N2O decomposition
Fig. 4a compares the steady-state N2O decomposition
activity of non-steamed and steamed Fe-ZSM-5 CVD catalysts
after pretreatment in He at either 773 K (temperature used for
the initial calcination of the sample) or 873 K for 1 h. The
steamed catalyst showed a higher steady-state N2O decom-
position activity than the non-steamed catalyst [41]. Moreover,
pretreatment at 873 K leads to a higher activity than
pretreatment at 773 K [10]. The effect of the pretreatment
temperature is larger for the non-steamed than for the steamed

sample. Exactly the same trend is observed for the Fe-ZSM-5
sample prepared by ion exchange (Fig. 4b). The ﬁrst order rate
constants and activation energies during N2O decomposition
are listed in Table 1. The activation energies of the steamed
catalysts were higher than the corresponding non-steamed
catalysts (Table 1), indicating that the steaming changes the
nature of the active sites. Further, the comparison between CVD
and IE samples shows that the activity of the former is only a
factor of 3–4 higher, whereas the iron loading is ten times
higher. In the CVD samples a lower fraction of the iron sites
takes place in the catalysis because the autoreduction of the
CVD samples is thermodynamically less favored [28].
3.5. Isotope exchange and step response experiments
Fig. 5 shows the step response from He to 5000 ppm N2O in
He over the isotopically labeled Fe-ZSM-5 IE at 673 K. A peak
of N2 appears immediately after the step to N2O. It is due to the
reoxidation of Fe2+ sites, which were (partly) created by
autoreduction during the pretreatment of the catalyst [28,41].
2FeðIIÞ þ N2O ! 2FeðIIIÞ þ Ocatalyst þ N2
(3)
After the N2 peak stoichiometric N2O decomposition sets in.
The activity of the catalyst immediately reaches steady state
(this will not be the case for the pretreatments described below)
and remains stable for the duration of the experiment. The
isotope equilibrium constant Ke = [16O18O]2/([16O2]*[18O2]) is
close to 4, which indicates an intensive mixing of the oxygen
atoms on the catalyst surface before their desorption as O2 [42].
The step response drastically changes after pretreatment of
the catalyst at 873 K (Fig. 6). The initial peak of N2, caused by
the reoxidation of Fe2+ sites, increases (Table 2) indicating that
the pretreatment at 873 K leads to more autoreduction. The N2
peak is followed by a period of high N2O decomposition
activity (called transient activity from now on), which decays to
steady state after 10 min. During the transient, the dominating
isotopomer of O2 is 16O2. A signiﬁcantly lower fraction of 18O
is incorporated into the O2 product than in steady state. An
analogous behavior was observed for Fe-ZSM-5 CVD after
dehydroxylation at 873 K [8].

ZSM-5 IE-st catalyst after pretreatment at 673 K in He. The

initial peak of N2, due to the reoxidation of Fe2+ sites, is
signiﬁcantly larger than on the corresponding non-steamed
catalyst (Table 2). After the N2 peak we observe a period of high
initial N2O decomposition activity, similar to that of the
corresponding non-steamed catalyst after dehydroxylation at
873 K (compare with Fig. 6a). However, the isotope pattern
during the transient is very different for the steamed catalyst. In
case of the dehydroxylated sample, the fraction of labelled
oxygen (18f) in the product O2 slightly decreased during the
transient period until the transient activity decayed and then 18f
increased to its steady-state value (see Fig. 6b). The same
behavior was also observed for a dehydroxylated Fe-ZSM-5
CVD catalyst [10]. The remarkable difference in case of the
steamed catalyst, Fe-ZSM-5 IE-st, is that two maxima of 18f are
observed as a function of time. The ﬁrst maximum of 18f rapidly
follows the N2 reoxidation peak and the second maximum
occurs 100 s later. The Fe-ZSM-5 CVD-st catalyst exhibited
qualitatively the same behavior (not shown).
The pattern of 18f described above is typical for all steamed
samples that we have tested, irrespective of iron concentration
and preparation method. Additional dehydroxylation of the
steamed samples at 873 K increases the overall transient
activity, but does not change the two-peak pattern of 18f
(Fig. 8).
The step response and the pattern of the isotope distribution
of the Fe-ZSM-5 IE-HT catalyst after in situ pretreatment at
873 K are very similar to those of the steamed catalyst (Fe-
ZSM-5 IE-st) after pretreatment at 873 K (Fig. 9). Like for the
steamed catalysts, 18f has two maxima (about 55 and 95 s after
the step to N2O) during the initial phase of the transient reaction
(Fig. 9b). Without in situ dehydroxylation at 873 K, Fe-ZSM-5
IE-HT did not exhibit any transient activity. The catalyst
reached steady state immediately after the step to N2O. In both
cases, the degree of autoreduction of Fe-ZSM-5 IE-HT was in
the same order of magnitude as of the corresponding steamed
catalyst.

3.6. FTIR of NO adsorption
NO is widely used as a probe molecule to identify the active
sites in the catalysts [43–46]. NO preferentially adsorbs on Fe2+
sites and forms mono-, di- or trinitrosyl species depending on
the available coordination sites. Fig. 10 shows the FTIR spectra
of NO adsorbed on the non-steamed, steamed, and high
temperature treated Fe-ZSM-5 IE catalysts after pretreatment at
873 K in vacuo. Two bands are observed at 1880 and
1810 cm1 and assigned to mononitrosyl and trinitrosyl
species, respectively. Trinitrosyl species
are formed on
coordinatively unsaturated Fe2+ sites, which are generated by
the dehydroxylation at 873 K. For the steamed catalyst the
amount of trinitrosyl species was lower than for the non-
steamed and high temperature treated catalysts. The decrease of
trinitrosyl species may be tentatively attributed to a clustering
of the iron species due to steaming. An additional mononitrosyl
band at higher frequency (at 1890 cm1) is observed for the
steamed catalyst. The shoulder at 1890 cm1 is also observed
for the Fe-ZSM-5 HT catalyst. Overall, Fe-ZSM-5 HT has the
most intense NO bands and the concentration of coordinatively
unsaturated iron species, which give rise to trinitrosyl species,
is rather high.
4. Discussion
4.1. Catalyst characterization
A signiﬁcant framework dealumination of the catalysts took
place upon steaming and is evidenced by the decrease in
intensity of the Brønsted hydroxyl band at 3605 cm1 (Fig. 3).
Zhu et al. observed a similar behavior after steaming of the
same type of catalyst. They conﬁrmed the presence of
extraframework aluminium by 27Al NMR experiments [6].
Dealumination and/or dehydroxylation also took place during
high temperature treatment of Fe-ZSM-5 IE catalyst at 1218 K
(Schemes 1 and 2). We cannot clearly distinguish framework
dealumination and dehydroxylation, but based on our IR data
and on earlier reports in the literature [1,2,40] we suppose that
both occur in parallel. Dehydroxylation at high temperature
leads to the formation of oxygen vacancies (lattice defects),
which could play an important role for the catalytic activity.
Concerning the iron species, steaming leads to a clustering
of the iron sites in the case of Fe-ZSM-5 CVD (evidenced by
Fig. 8. Response of the Fe-ZSM-5 IE-st-873 catalyst at 673 K to a step from 0

UV–vis and EXAFS [41]). For Fe-ZSM-5 IE-st such a
clustering is not clearly observed in the UV–vis spectra. The
same holds true for Fe-ZSM-5 IE-HT sample. The common
feature of the NO absorbed FTIR spectra of Fe-ZSM-5 IE-st
and IE-HT is the appearance of the band at 1890 cm1. This
band is a characteristic feature of steamed samples or samples
treated at very high temperatures [12,47]. The shift of the NO
stretching frequency to higher wavenumber indicates a lower
backdonation from Fe, i.e. a lower electron density on the iron
sites [45,48]. This indicates that the iron sites are associated
with electron withdrawing Al Lewis centers, possibly created
by framework dealumination or framework dehydroxylation.
Coordinatively unsaturated iron sites (trinitrosyl species) are
present in Fe-ZSM-5 IE-HT, but not in the IE-st sample. We can
sum up the results as follows: treatment at 873 K dehydrox-
ylates the iron sites; steaming creates electron-deﬁcient iron
sites, presumably associated to lattice defects; treatment at
1218 K does both. We ﬁnd no clear evidence for the formation
of iron dimers or clusters after treatment at very high
temperatures. The formation of such dimers/clusters was
invoked by Yuranov et al. to explain the high activity of the HT
treated Fe-ZSM-5 samples [27].
4.2. The effect of steaming and high temperature treatment
on the transient reaction
The step response experiments on the isotopically labeled
catalysts give very interesting information about the reactivity
of the catalysts as a function of their pretreatment. Steaming,
dehydroxylation at 873 K, and dehydroxylation at 1218 K all
lead to occurrence of transient activity, i.e. a high initial N2O
decomposition activity, which slowly decays to steady state.
The isotope distribution (the evolution of
18f) during the
transient activity strongly depends on the pretreatment of the
catalyst. In order to understand these phenomena more in detail
we have to discuss how 18O can be incorporated in the product
O2. N2O decomposition is carried out with non-labeled N2O on
a catalyst that was partially labeled with 18O (by reduction with
H2 and reoxidation with 18O2). The extent of labeling of the
active sites is determined by pulsing a small amount of CO
before the step to N2O. CO is oxidized to CO2 and the fraction
of 18O in the product CO2 is associated with the fraction of 18O
at the active sites [49]. The fraction of 18O at the active sites is,
in general, higher for CVD than for IE catalysts (Table 3). The
pretreatment in He at 873 K redistributes the oxygen species,
i.e. labeled extra-lattice oxygen exchanges with non-labeled
lattice oxygen and diffuses away from the active sites. This
redistribution of labeled oxygen atoms over the lattice reduces
the fraction of 18O at the active sites, especially for samples
with low iron loading [28]. During the decomposition of N2O,
18O from the catalyst is incorporated into the product O2 by
exchange of oxygen atoms from the catalyst with the oxygen
atoms that N2O deposits on the active sites. Earlier studies
showed that gas phase O2, once formed, does not exchange with
the catalyst surface any more [42].1
Our earlier study on Fe-ZSM-5 CVD, dehydroxylated at
873 K, showed that N2O decomposition during the transient
occurs on a single active site [10]. Isotope exchange is limited
to the oxygen atoms surrounding the active iron center. As
isotope exchange and O2 desorption proceed the active sites are
depleted of
18O and
18f decreases. Then the fast N2O
decomposition on a single iron site decays and the slower
steady-state reaction becomes dominant. Steady-state N2O
decomposition occurs via the migration of oxygen atoms
deposited on separate iron centers. The migration of the
deposited oxygen atoms over the catalyst involves an intensive
exchange with oxygen atoms from the catalyst and leads to the
increase of 18f when the transient activity decays. These trends
are reproduced on the Fe-ZSM-5 IE catalyst, which was
dehydroxylated at 873 K.
The situation is different for steamed catalysts. Instead of
slowly decreasing with time (until transient activity decays), 18f
has two maxima at the beginning of the transient. The ﬁrst peak
is attributed to the labeled oxygen atoms that are directly
associated with the active iron centers. They are incorporated
into the product O2 by exchange reactions. Exchange and O2
desorption rapidly deplete this pool and therefore 18f decreases.
Then a second pool of (labeled) oxygen atoms becomes
involved in the reaction and makes 18f rise again. This pool is
slowly depleted and then the steamed catalyst follows the
behavior of the dehydroxylated sample.

1 The absence of isotope exchange with O2 differs from the results of
Novakowa et al., obtained in a batch reactor [50]. In our opinion, the dis-
crepancy between the two results is not unreasonable. The dissociation of O2 on
the catalyst is slower than the dissociation of N2O. In a ﬂow reactor with short
contact times, the faster reaction will be strongly favored while in a batch
reactor both will occur after long reaction times.

In order to describe the mechanism in more detail on a
molecular level we would need to know the structure of the
active site. Unfortunately, at present date the nature of
extraframework species in steamed samples remains unre-
solved. We can, however, speculate on the structure of the
active site in the HT-treated catalysts: Let us assume that the
active site is a single Fe2+ cation (while not ruling out that a
similar mechanism may be possible for iron dimers). In order to
be easily accessible to reactants the Fe2+ cation should be
located in the 10-membered ring channels of ZSM-5. For Cu-
ZSM-5 with a mixed oxidation state of Cu(I)/Cu(II) two
preferred cation locations in the 10-membered ring channel
were recently identiﬁed by XRD [51]. One of them is associated
with a single T-site, the other is located in a 5-memberd ring.
The two charges of Fe2+ are more easily compensated in a 5-
membered ring and we suspect this to be the preferred location
of the iron cations. Further, the characterization data indicate
that Fe2+ is located next to strongly electron-withdrawing Al
centers, associated with lattice defects. For reasons of charge
balancing, these lattice defects are probably not located directly
in the ring where Fe2+ is stabilized, but in a neighboring ring. In
that case we can interpret the two maxima in 18f as follows: The
ﬁrst oxygen pool is associated with the oxygen atoms of the ring
where Fe2+ is located. Scheme 3 indicates how isotope
exchange reactions within the ring are possible during the cycle
of N2O decomposition. Due to the high mobility of the oxygen
species, also more distant lattice oxygen atoms (which are
partially labeled) start to migrate towards the active site. These
migrating oxygen atoms are ﬁrst trapped by the neighboring
defect before reaching the ring where Fe2+ is located. The
trapping of migrating oxygen atoms by the defect can explain
the minimum in 18f.
Apart from this particularity, the mechanism of Scheme 3 is
very similar to the one proposed in our earlier work [10]. It also
ﬁts well with a recent TAP study of Kondratenko and Perez-
Ramirez [52]. The very high activity of the steamed or HT-
treated samples during the transient period leads to a very rapid
desorption of O2. The rapid desorption leaves the oxygen atoms
less time to undergo isotope exchange. Therefore, the 18f
fraction remains very low during the transient period (see
Table 3).
We also have to discuss why the transient activity decays to
steady state. In our earlier work we proposed that transient
activity was entirely related to the dehydroxylation of the iron
sites [10]. The dehydroxylation creates open coordination sites
and allows two oxygen atoms from N2O to adsorb on a single
iron site, which allows rapid desorption of O2. This mechanism
decays as the active sites become slowly rehydroxylated by
traces of H2O in the feed. For the steamed catalysts this
explanation is not applicable. They exhibit transient activity
without prior treatment at 873 K. The high initial activity is
therefore an inherent feature of the active sites in the steamed
catalyst and not related to dehydroxylation. The question then
arises why the transient activity decays. Rehydroxylation by
traces of H2O in the feed cannot be the reason. The structure of
the active sites must change during the course of the reaction.
Perez-Ramirez et al. recently showed that the oxygen atoms
that N2O deposits on the active sites are rapidly transformed
into a less active surface species unless they are given the
possibility to react immediately [53–55]. This transformation
into a less active surface species and/or the healing of defects
may be responsible for the decay of the transient activity in the
steamed/HT-treated catalysts. The deactivation of the transient
activity is, however, not irreversible. A simple purge in inert gas
at 673 K can, partially, restore the high initial activity if the step
to N2O is repeated.
4.3. The effect of steaming and high temperature treatment
on the steady-state activity
The transient experiments, which we discussed above, show
that steaming and high temperature pretreatment qualitatively
changes the nature of the active sites. This is probably related to
the creation of iron sites next to electron-withdrawing Al Lewis
Scheme 3. Scheme of the catalytic cycle during the transient period. A hypothetical structure of an isolated Fe2+ cation next to a lattice defect is used for illustration.
We chose a plausible distribution of bonds in the intermediate structures, but other mesomeric structures and/or other distributions of the oxygen atoms over the ring
are certainly possible. Note that the reaction scheme is purely hypothetical. It is meant as guide for the chemists’ imagination.

234
sites, which was created by the creation of framework defects.
The question arises whether these sites have an intrinsically
higher activity in N2O decomposition. The tentative answer is
no. The changes in N2O decomposition activity upon steaming
and dehydroxylation can be largely ascribed to their effect on
the autoreduction of the iron species. The TOF (N2O activity
per initial concentration of Fe2+ sites) does not change
signiﬁcantly upon steaming or HT treatment. The steamed
and HT treated samples behave differently only during the
initial phase of the reaction, i.e. during the transient period.
Then a rearrangement of the catalyst surface takes place and in
steady-state N2O decomposition at 673 K, the active sites
generated by the high temperature pretreatments seem to have
lost their particularity. We attribute this to the fact that the rate
of N2O decomposition is limited by O2 desorption and not by
the dissociation of N2O. The mobility of the surface oxygen
atoms is more important in N2O decomposition than their
intrinsic activity. In reaction with other reductants (benzene,
NO, CH4, etc.), the turnover frequency may very well change
since the reaction regime will resemble more the one observed
during the transient reaction.
5. Conclusions
Steaming
and
treatment
of
Fe-ZSM-5
at
very
high
temperatures lead to the creation of localised defects in the
ZSM-5 framework. The electronic properties of the iron sites in
the vicinity of these defects change, which is evidenced by the
shift of mononitrosyl band to the higher frequencies. These iron
sites in the vicinity of defects exhibit a qualitatively different
behavior in N2O decomposition. The difference is observed,
however, only in the initial phase of the reaction during which
the catalyst exhibits a higher activity than in steady state.
In steady state the turn-over-frequency of the aforemen-
tioned iron sites is not signiﬁcantly different from other Fe-
ZSM-5 catalysts, which did not undergo steaming or high
temperature dehydroxylation. The increase of activity follow-
ing these pretreatments can be explained by an increase in the
number of active sites, as a consequence of autoreduction of the
iron centers during the pretreatment. The intrinsic activity per
site, however, does not change much. This may be due to the
fact that the rate-limiting step of N2O decomposition is not the
activation of N2O, but the formation of O2.
