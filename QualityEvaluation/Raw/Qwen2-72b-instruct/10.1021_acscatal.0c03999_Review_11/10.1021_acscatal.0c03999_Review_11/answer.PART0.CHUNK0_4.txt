[1] "A selective activation of C3H8 can be achieved via halogen-mediated pathways under relatively mild temperatures between 300 and 700 C."
[2] "To obtain C3H6 from C3H8, different approaches can be used (Figure 22), such as the dehydrogenation with molecular halogens (X2), oxidative dehydrogenation in the presence of halogen (X2 + O2), propane oxyhalogenation via halides (HX + O2), and molten metal halide salts assisted ODHP (LiX + O2)."
[3] "It is important to note that the catalytic transformation of C3H8 in these routes is quite different from other alkanes such as methane and ethane because of the differences in reactivity of the respective alkanes."

1. Propane (C3H8) can be selectively dehydrogenated to propene (C3H6) through halogen-mediated pathways at relatively mild temperatures between 300 and 700 degrees Celsius. The methods include dehydrogenation with molecular halogens, oxidative dehydrogenation in the presence of halogen and oxygen, propane oxyhalogenation using halides and oxygen, and molten metal halide salts assisted oxidative dehydrogenation. The catalytic transformation of propane in these processes is distinct from other alkanes like methane and ethane due to the specific reactivity of each alkane.

1. 丙烷（C3H8）可以通过卤素介导的途径在相对温和的温度下（300至700摄氏度）选择性地脱氢生成丙烯（C3H6）。这些方法包括使用分子卤素的脱氢、在卤素和氧气存在下的氧化脱氢、使用卤化物和氧气的丙烷氧卤化，以及使用熔融金属卤化盐辅助的氧化脱氢。在这些过程中，丙烷的催化转化与甲烷和乙烷等其他烷烃的转化有显著差异，这是由于各自烷烃的反应性不同。
