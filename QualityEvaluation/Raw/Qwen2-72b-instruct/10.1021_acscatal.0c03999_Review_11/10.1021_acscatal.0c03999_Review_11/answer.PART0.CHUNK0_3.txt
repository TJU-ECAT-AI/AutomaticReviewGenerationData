[1] "A selective activation of C3H8 can be achieved via halogen-mediated pathways under relatively mild temperatures between 300 and 700 C."
[2] "To obtain C3H6 from C3H8, different approaches can be used (Figure 22), such as the dehydrogenation with molecular halogens (X2), oxidative dehydrogenation in the presence of halogen (X2 + O2), propane oxyhalogenation via halides (HX + O2), and molten metal halide salts assisted ODHP (LiX + O2)."
[3] "It is important to note that the catalytic transformation of C3H8 in these routes is quite different from other alkanes such as methane and ethane because of the differences in reactivity of the respective alkanes."

1. Halogen-assisted methods for selectively dehydrogenating propane (C3H8) to propene (C3H6) include dehydrogenation with molecular halogens, oxidative dehydrogenation in the presence of halogen, propane oxyhalogenation via halides, and molten metal halide salts assisted oxidative dehydrogenation (ODHP). These methods operate under relatively mild temperatures between 300 and 700 degrees Celsius. The catalytic transformation of propane in these processes is distinct from other alkanes like methane and ethane due to differences in the reactivity of the respective alkanes.

1. 选择性地将丙烷(C3H8)脱氢转化为丙烯(C3H6)的卤素辅助方法包括使用分子卤素的脱氢、在卤素存在下的氧化脱氢、通过卤化物的丙烷氧卤化以及熔融金属卤化盐辅助的氧化脱氢(ODHP)。这些方法在相对温和的温度下进行，温度范围在300到700摄氏度之间。在这些过程中，丙烷的催化转化与甲烷和乙烷等其他烷烃的转化有显著差异，这是由于各自烷烃的反应性存在差异。
