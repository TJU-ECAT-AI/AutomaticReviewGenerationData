Read the questions and answers provided below. First, critically assess the overall relevance of the answers provided to the set of questions asked.

If, upon your assessment, you find that the answers do not contain information that is relevant to the questions asked, stop your review process immediately and respond with a single sentence: "※※※※※※※The provided answers are not relevant to the questions.※※※※※※※". Do not provide any additional explanation or background information, only this sentence should be given as a response in case of irrelevant answers.

If, however, the answers are relevant to the questions asked, proceed to compile answers for each question according to the instructions below. Ensure to aggregate all the relevant answers from the multiple answer results provided in the document, and organize them sequentially by their order number, compiling the corresponding quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question.

If the provided answers' quotes are not differentiated by question, ensure to break them down and assign the quotes to each respective question, outputting them separately within each question's section.

To provide a comprehensive review, differentiate the responses into quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question based on the details given in the 'Answer' XML tags. Structure your review using the XML format showcased below if the answers are relevant to the questions asked:

Describe and compare the various halogen-assisted methods for selectively dehydrogenating propane to propene, including dehydrogenation with halogens, oxidative dehydrogenation, oxyhalogenation, and molten metal halide salt approaches. Explain the reaction conditions for each method and analyze why propane's reactivity in these processes differs significantly from that of other alkanes such as methane and ethane.

[1] "A selective activation of C3H8 can be achieved via halogen-mediated pathways under relatively mild temperatures between 300 and 700 C."
[2] "To obtain C3H6 from C3H8, different approaches can be used (Figure 22), such as the dehydrogenation with molecular halogens (X2), oxidative dehydrogenation in the presence of halogen (X2 + O2), propane oxyhalogenation via halides (HX + O2), and molten metal halide salts assisted ODHP (LiX + O2)."
[3] "It is important to note that the catalytic transformation of C3H8 in these routes is quite different from other alkanes such as methane and ethane because of the differences in reactivity of the respective alkanes."

1. Halogen-assisted dehydrogenation of propane (C3H8) to propene (C3H6) can be achieved through various methods including dehydrogenation with molecular halogens, oxidative dehydrogenation in the presence of halogen, propane oxyhalogenation via halides, and molten metal halide salts assisted oxidative dehydrogenation (ODHP). These processes typically occur at relatively mild temperatures between 300 and 700 degrees Celsius. The catalytic transformation of propane in these routes is distinct from other alkanes like methane and ethane due to the unique reactivity of propane.

1. 丙烷（C3H8）在卤素辅助下脱氢生成丙烯（C3H6）可以通过多种方法实现，包括使用分子卤素的脱氢、在卤素存在下的氧化脱氢、通过卤化物的丙烷氧卤化以及熔融金属卤化盐辅助的氧化脱氢（ODHP）。这些过程通常在相对温和的温度下进行，温度范围在300到700摄氏度之间。在这些路线中，丙烷的催化转化与甲烷和乙烷等其他烷烃的转化截然不同，这是由于丙烷特有的反应性。
