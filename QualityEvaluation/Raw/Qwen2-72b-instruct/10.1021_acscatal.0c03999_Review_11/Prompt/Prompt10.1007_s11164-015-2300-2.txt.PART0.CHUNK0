Effect of oxychlorination treatment on the regeneration of PtSn/Al2O3 catalyst for propane dehydrogenation Ga Hee Kim1 • Kwang-Deog Jung2 • Won-Il Kim3 • Byung-Hwan Um1 • Chae-Ho Shin4 • Kyeongseok Oh5 • Hyoung Lim Koh1 Received: 10 July 2015 / Accepted: 25 September 2015 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht 2015 Abstract Propane dehydrogenation and regeneration of PtSn/h-Al2O3 catalysts was evaluated with oxychlorination treatment. It was observed that the catalytic activity was not fully recovered after coke burning followed by hydrogen reduction process because of the unsatisfying recovery of Pt sintering. In this study, oxy- chlorination treatment was additionally employed between coke burning and hydrogen reduction.
Oxychlorination used diluted HCl at the range of 6257000 ppm. The best recovery of catalytic activity was achieved at the HCl concentration of 5000 ppm. The effective redispersion of Pt was also examined by CO chemisorption, XRD, XPS, CHSN analysis, and STEM.

When propane is used as a feedstock, propane dehydrogenation (PDH) can produce propylene. Propane dehydrogenation reaction is shown in (Eq. 1) [1, 2].

298  129 kJ/mol 1 Since PDH is an endothermic reaction requiring higher temperature, noble metal or heavy metal catalysts are used to achieve economically attractive conversion.
While PDH needs high reaction temperatures in the range of 500700 C, reaction pressures are not severe, but near atmospheric pressure. PDH at higher temperatures may increase the propylene yield, however, also leads to unfavorable side reactions and accelerates catalyst deactivation as well. It was known that dehydrogenation catalysts should be regenerated regularly [2, 3]. The regeneration process includes coke burning to remove the deposits blamed for catalytic deactivation and hydrogen reduction to redisperse sintered Pt (or PtSn) particles in part. The sintering of Pt (or PtSn) particles can gradually become worse because of the repeated use of dehydrogenation and coke burning [4]. Ideally, the catalyst used would restore the original activity and original selectivity through a well-chosen regeneration process.
Among the various regeneration processes, it is noticeable that attractive restoration of catalytic activity and selectivity was achieved by either coke burning/ oxychlorination or chloride addition/metals reduction [5].
Air has been often used as an oxygen source. Even a small amount of oxygen can be critical to trigger coke burning. Temperatures must be carefully maintained in order to prevent an uncontrollable exothermal reaction. If not, an exothermal reaction will result in serious damage to metal crystallites as well as catalyst support. Coke from dehydrogenation can be removed in a series of steps, where the temperature or oxygen concentration is increased until there is no trace of coke on the catalyst. It was reported that exothermic temperature was minimized by controlling oxygen contents and heater programs [4, 5]. In addition, even with controlled coke removal, the metal crystallites may become unavoidably sintered during regeneration processes. As metal crystallites become larger in diameter, the activity will be decreased. It was reported that metal redispersion can be affected by appropriate amounts of oxygen, chloride, temperature, and reaction time [4, 5]. It was also presented that oxychlorination induced the formation of oxychloridic platinum compounds and motivated the effective redispersion of platinum during the regeneration of naphtha reforming catalyst. Postulated was that the greater mobility of chlorinated metal species can induce the redispersion of Pt effectively [4, 5]. If this is true, redispersion can reduce the size of metal crystallites and also result in the overall increase of metal surface area. In general, naphtha reforming catalyst can be used after periodic regeneration by coke burning combined with oxychlorination. Nevertheless, there is no attempt to investigate the activity and the

123 characterization of catalyst in detail when the oxychlorination option was used to catalyst regeneration for PDH reaction.
In this study, oxychlorination was proposed to increase the mobility of Pt on PDH catalyst. Proposed oxychlorination was performed by HCl addition diluted in purified air at 500 C. After oxychlorination reaction, hydrogen reduction process was followed. Reduction temperature and reduction time were selectively conducted for economic purpose. Evidences of redispersion were verified by CO chemisorption, XRD, XPS, CHSN analysis, and STEM.
Experimental Preparation of catalyst PtSn/h-Al2O3 catalysts were prepared by two separate stages of impregnation method. The h-alumina supports were prepared by temperature-programmed calcination of gamma-alumina pellets (provided by Axens) under air atmosphere.
The temperatures were raised from 278 to 1273 K at a rate of 10 K/min and then held at 1273 K for 8 h. At first, a designated amount of Tin(II) chloride (SnCl2, Sigma-Aldrich, [ 98 %) was impregnated on the support, h-Al2O3. Drying and calcination were performed at 120 C for 12 h and 873 K for 3 h, respectively.Then, a counted amount of hydrogen hexachloroplatinate (IV) hydrate (H2PtCl6, Kojima Chemical Co., Ltd., [ 99 %) was consecutively deposited on Sn/h-Al2O3.Another cycle of drying and calcination were carried out at 393 K for 12 h and 853 K for 3 h, respectively.Catalytic activity measurements Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) of catalysts was attempted. For hydrogen reduction, the calcined catalysts were individually reduced in a pure hydrogen (99.99 %) flow (32 mL min-1). Reduction temperature was increased gradually from room temperature to 893 K (10 C min-1). PDH reaction was performed in a fixed-bed quartz reactor at atmospheric pressure and 893 K for 5 h. After hydrogen reduction, C3H8:H2 feed gases with a molar ratio of 1:1 were introduced into the quartz reactor. Total gas flow rate was maintained at 64 mL min-1. The products and reactants were analyzed by an on-line GC (FID detector, Series M600D, Younglin Co.) equipped with a capillary column (GS-Alumina, Agilent Technolo- gies, USA, i.d.: 0.53 mm, length: 50 m). Propane conversion, propylene selectivity and propylene yield were monitored and calculated by the following formulae: Propane conversion % 1 n C3H8

After first-run PDH, the used catalyst was regenerated and evaluated again to determine if active catalyst was fully recovered. The regeneration process was composed of three serial steps: coke burning, oxychlorination, and hydrogen reduction. Table 1 summarizes the regeneration processes we examined. Coke burning was performed at 893 K for 3 h. The pressure was controlled at 1 atm and air flow was set to 60 mL/min. Oxychlorination was followed by coking process.
Oxychlorination included the following steps; (a) heating in flowing air up to 823 K (b) feed of the chloriding mixture of hydrogen chloride (1 % HCl/99 % N2) with the air stream during 2 h at the same temperature, (c) termination of the chloriding mixture feed, and (d) purging by N2 flow for 30 min. The concentration of HCl was varied from 625 to 7000 ppm. The pressure was controlled to atmospheric pressure.
The total gas flow was set to 360 mL/min and 2 g of catalyst were placed to the reactor. Hydrogen reduction of used catalyst was performed by the same procedure as mentioned above.
Catalyst characterization The measurements of BET surface area and N2 adsorptiondesorption were performed at 17 K using an automated gas sorption system (Belsorp II mini, BEL Japan, Inc.). The BarrettJoynerHalanda (BJH) method was used to obtain pore size distribution. CHNS analysis (Fisons EA1108) was carried out to determine the carbon contents accumulated on the catalyst surface during PDH reaction.

123 to evaluate metal dispersion, CO chemisorption was performed with a pulse chemisorption mode (BELCAT, BEL Japan, Inc.). Prior to measurements, 0.05 g of a catalyst sample was thermally treated under a He stream at 773 K for 50 min to remove physically adsorbed water and other impurities. Catalyst sample was cooled down to room temperature and heated to 823 K with a heating rate of 10 K/min using pure H2 at a flow rate of 50 mL/min. The sample was then reduced in a pure H2 flow at 823 K for 2 h. After reduction, the sample was purged with helium (He) gas at the same temperature for 1 h. After cooling to 323 K, the 10 % CO/He (10 % v/v of CO diluted in He) gas was introduced for CO chemisorption. CO loop gas was used for each pulse, and the pulse injections were repeated until saturation. The amount of CO was measured using a thermal conductivity detector. The metal dispersion of each catalyst was then calculated from the amount of CO adsorbed,taking the stoichiometry factor (SF) as one for CO/Ptatm: Dispersion %  100  VS  SF  MW SW  Fn  22:414 where, Vs is the cumulative volume of adsorbed CO (cm3 at STP), MW is the molecular weight of Pt metal (g mol-1), SW is the weight of the sample, and Fn is the Pt fraction in relation to the total catalyst sample weight.
The X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the prepared Pt Sn/Al2O3 catalysts were recorded by a diffractometer (M/S, Shimadzu Instruments, Japan) with Ni-filtered Cu Ka (k = 1.540,600 nm). The operating voltage was 40 kV, and the current was 40 mA, with a 2h scanning rate of 3 min-1. XPS analyses were performed using an Ulvac-PHI spectrometer [PHI 5000 Versa Probe; Minimum X-ray beam size: B10_m, energy resolution: B0.50 eV, sensitivity: C1,000,000 CPS, scanning electron gun (AES/SEM) and UV light source] using a non-monochromatized Mg K_radiation (1253.6 eV). The vacuum in the analysis chamber was controlled to less than 1 9 10-7 Pa. The peaks of Pt and Sn were deconvoluted using a sum of LorentzianGaussian functions. The high resolution TEM images of Pt and Sn nanoparticles were characterized by FEI (Technai F20 G2, The Netherland) microscopy working in a STEM mode (Accelerating voltage: 50200 kV, Image resolution:\
0.23 nm, Electro probe size:\
0.3 nm, Magnification: 251,030,0009,
Specimen double tilting: 40/20). The catalyst sample was prepared by dispersion and suspension in ethanol solution and ultrasonic treatment for 30 min.
Consequently, the treated solution was deposited on copper grid coated with a carbon film, and evaporated. Finally, the sample containing copper grid was used for TEM and HRTEM/HAADF STEM analysis.
