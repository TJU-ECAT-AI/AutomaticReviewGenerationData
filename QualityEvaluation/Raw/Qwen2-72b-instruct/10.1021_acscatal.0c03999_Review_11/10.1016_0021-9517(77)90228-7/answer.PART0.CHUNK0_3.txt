1.The document does not provide information on various halogen-assisted methods for selectively dehydrogenating propane to propene, including dehydrogenation with halogens, oxidative dehydrogenation, oxyhalogenation, and molten metal halide salt approaches. The document focuses on the investigation of the system propane-sulfur dioxide over Pd/A1203 catalyst in the reduced and sulfided states. The overall reaction for the dehydrogenation of propane to propylene with SO2 is given as 3C3H8 + SO2 -> 3CH4 + H2S + 2H2O. The reaction is endothermic and Kp increases with temperature. The reduced Pd/AL203 catalyst is superior to the sulfided catalyst, showing moderate activity and high selectivity to propylene at temperatures as high as 611C. The addition of SO2 to the feed increases the conversion of propane, however, the selectivities to propylene are far below those obtained with pure propane feed.

1.文档没有提供关于选择性脱氢丙烷至丙烯的各种卤素辅助方法的信息，包括与卤素的脱氢，氧化脱氢，氧卤化和熔融金属卤化盐方法。文档专注于在还原和硫化状态下对丙烷-二氧化硫在Pd/A1203催化剂系统的研究。丙烷与SO2脱氢至丙烯的总反应被给出为3C3H8 + SO2 -> 3CH4 + H2S + 2H2O。反应是吸热的，Kp随温度的升高而增加。还原的Pd/AL203催化剂优于硫化催化剂，显示出在高达611C的温度下对丙烯具有中等的活性和高选择性。向进料中添加SO2会增加丙烷的转化率，但是，丙烯的选择性远低于仅使用丙烷进料时获得的选择性。
