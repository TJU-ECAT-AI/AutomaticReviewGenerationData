1.The document does not provide information on various halogen-assisted methods for selectively dehydrogenating propane to propene, including dehydrogenation with halogens, oxidative dehydrogenation, oxyhalogenation, and molten metal halide salt approaches. It only discusses the dehydrogenation of propane to propylene using a Pd/A1203 catalyst in the presence of sulfur dioxide. The reaction conditions for this process are described as being carried out in a conventional fixed bed flow reactor at atmospheric pressure, with the catalyst being reduced and sulfided before use. The document does not provide a comparison with other alkanes such as methane and ethane.

1.文档没有提供各种卤素辅助方法来选择性地将丙烷脱氢为丙烯，包括使用卤素的脱氢、氧化脱氢、氧卤化和熔融金属卤化盐方法的信息。它只讨论了在硫化氢存在下使用Pd/A1203催化剂将丙烷脱氢为丙烯的过程。该过程的反应条件被描述为在常压下在常规的固定床流化反应器中进行，催化剂在使用前被还原和硫化。文档没有提供与其他烷烃如甲烷和乙烷的比较。
