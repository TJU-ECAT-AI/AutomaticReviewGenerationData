1. Halogen-assisted methods for selective propane dehydrogenation: A comparative analysis of various approaches, reaction conditions, and propane's unique reactivity

Halogen-assisted methods for selective propane dehydrogenation have been extensively explored, offering a unique role in the dehydrogenation of various alkanes, affording an exceptionally high selectivity to the respective alkenes \[10.1021/acs.chemrev.6b00551\]. The methods include iodine-mediated dehydrogenation, alkali metal chloride-catalyzed oxidative dehydrogenation, metal iodide-catalyzed oxidative dehydrogenation, and bihalogen-aided dehydrogenation. Iodine-mediated dehydrogenation involves the substitution of molecular iodine with hydrocarbons, but iodine is poorly reactive toward saturated hydrocarbons. A free radical mechanism was proposed for the stoichiometric iodination, consisting of successive hydrogen abstraction reactions involving both atomic and molecular iodine \[10.1021/acs.chemrev.6b00551\]. Molten salts (metal chlorides and iodides) catalyzed oxidative dehydrogenation uses supported alkali metal chloride catalysts, which have been demonstrated to be one of the most promising candidates for the oxidative dehydrogenation of light aliphatic alkanes (C2C4) to olefins \[10.1021/acs.chemrev.6b00551\]. Oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes can also be catalyzed by iodide-based molten salts. Recently, Stucky et al. developed a low-temperature route for propane dehydrogenation by using bihalogens (Br2 and I2) as the mediators, achieving a high yield of C3H6+C3H7X (X = Br and I) up to 80% at moderate reaction temperatures below 800 K \[10.1021/acs.chemrev.6b00551\]. The interplay between Br2 and I2 was believed to be crucial, combining the high reactivity of bromine and high selectivity of iodine \[10.1021/acs.chemrev.6b00551\]. Propane (C3H8) can be selectively dehydrogenated to propene (C3H6) through halogen-mediated pathways at relatively mild temperatures between 300 and 700 degrees Celsius \[10.1021/acscatal.0c03999_11\]. The catalytic transformation of propane in these processes is distinct from other alkanes like methane and ethane due to the specific reactivity of each alkane \[10.1021/acscatal.0c03999_11\].

                Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: The advancements in halogen-assisted methods for selective propane dehydrogenation have opened up new avenues for the production of propene. The unique role of halogens in the dehydrogenation of various alkanes, affording an exceptionally high selectivity to the respective alkenes, has been well-documented. The methods for selectively dehydrogenating propane to propene include iodine-mediated dehydrogenation, alkali metal chloride-catalyzed oxidative dehydrogenation, metal iodide-catalyzed oxidative dehydrogenation, and bihalogen-aided dehydrogenation. The interplay between Br2 and I2 in the bihalogen-aided dehydrogenation was believed to be crucial, combining the high reactivity of bromine and high selectivity of iodine. The catalytic transformation of propane in these processes is distinct from other alkanes like methane and ethane due to the specific reactivity of each alkane. Future research endeavors might focus on the development of new catalysts and the optimization of reaction conditions to further improve the selectivity and yield of propene. The exploration of new halogen-assisted methods for the dehydrogenation of other alkanes, such as butane and pentane, might also be a promising direction.
