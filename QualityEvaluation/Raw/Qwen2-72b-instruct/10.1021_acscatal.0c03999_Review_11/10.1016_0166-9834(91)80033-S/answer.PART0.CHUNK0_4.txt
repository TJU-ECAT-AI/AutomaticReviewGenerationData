1.The document does not provide a comparison of various halogen-assisted methods for selectively dehydrogenating propane to propene. It focuses on the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane in the presence of iodine and air using lithium hydroxide/lithium iodide melts. The reaction conditions are described as occurring at temperatures around 600-700°C with a propane to air ratio of 1:2 to 1:4. The document does not analyze why propane's reactivity in these processes differs significantly from that of other alkanes such as methane and ethane.

1.该文件没有比较各种卤素辅助方法选择性地将丙烷脱氢为丙烯。它专注于在碘和空气存在下使用氢氧化锂/碘化锂熔体对丙烷进行氧化脱氢。反应条件描述为在约600-700°C的温度下，丙烷与空气的比例为1:2至1:4。该文件没有分析为什么丙烷在这些过程中的反应性与甲烷和乙烷等其他烷烃有显著差异。
