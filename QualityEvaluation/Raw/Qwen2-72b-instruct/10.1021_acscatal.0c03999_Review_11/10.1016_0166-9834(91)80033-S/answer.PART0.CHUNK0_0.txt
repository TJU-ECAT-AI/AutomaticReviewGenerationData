1.The document does not provide a comparison of various halogen-assisted methods for selectively dehydrogenating propane to propene. It focuses on the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane in the presence of iodine and air in a lithium hydroxide/lithium iodide salt melt. The reaction conditions are described as being performed at temperatures around 600-700 degrees Celsius with a propane to air ratio of 1:2 to 1:4. The document does not analyze why propane's reactivity in these processes differs significantly from that of other alkanes such as methane and ethane.

1.该文件没有比较各种卤素辅助方法选择性地将丙烷脱氢为丙烯。它专注于在锂氢氧化物/碘化锂盐熔中碘和空气存在下丙烷的氧化脱氢。反应条件描述为在约600-700摄氏度的温度下进行，丙烷与空气的比例为1:2至1:4。该文件没有分析为什么丙烷在这些过程中的反应性与甲烷和乙烷等其他烷烃有显著差异。
