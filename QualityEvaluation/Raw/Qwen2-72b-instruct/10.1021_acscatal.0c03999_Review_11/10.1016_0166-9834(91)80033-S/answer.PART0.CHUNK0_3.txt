1.The document does not provide a comparison of various halogen-assisted methods for selectively dehydrogenating propane to propene. It focuses on the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane in the presence of iodine and air using lithium hydroxide/lithium iodide melts. The reaction conditions are described as occurring at temperatures between 700-900 K. The document does not analyze why propane's reactivity in these processes differs significantly from that of other alkanes such as methane and ethane.
