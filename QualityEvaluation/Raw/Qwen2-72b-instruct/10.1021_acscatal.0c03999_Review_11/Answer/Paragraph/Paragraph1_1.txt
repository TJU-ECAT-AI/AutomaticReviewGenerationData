                Halogen-assisted methods for selective propane dehydrogenation have been extensively explored, offering a unique role in the dehydrogenation of various alkanes, affording an exceptionally high selectivity to the respective alkenes \[10.1021/acs.chemrev.6b00551\]. The methods include iodine-mediated dehydrogenation, alkali metal chloride-catalyzed oxidative dehydrogenation, metal iodide-catalyzed oxidative dehydrogenation, and bihalogen-aided dehydrogenation. Iodine-mediated dehydrogenation involves the substitution of molecular iodine with hydrocarbons, but iodine is poorly reactive toward saturated hydrocarbons. A free radical mechanism was proposed for the stoichiometric iodination, consisting of successive hydrogen abstraction reactions involving both atomic and molecular iodine \[10.1021/acs.chemrev.6b00551\]. Molten salts (metal chlorides and iodides) catalyzed oxidative dehydrogenation uses supported alkali metal chloride catalysts, which have been demonstrated to be one of the most promising candidates for the oxidative dehydrogenation of light aliphatic alkanes (C2C4) to olefins \[10.1021/acs.chemrev.6b00551\]. Oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes can also be catalyzed by iodide-based molten salts. The functions of metal iodides in the dehydrogenation have not been well-understood, but the consensus is that they act as a mediator to adsorb and release I2 \[10.1021/acs.chemrev.6b00551\]. An interesting oxidative dehydrogenation process for various hydrocarbons, based on metal iodides, was developed by Shell \[10.1021/acs.chemrev.6b00551\]. Propane dehydrogenation to propylene has been extensively explored as an alternative approach to supplement the current propylene production based on steam cracking, fluidic catalytic cracking of naphtha and other hydrocarbons, and SAPO-34 catalyzed methanol to mixed olefins \[10.1021/acs.chemrev.6b00551\]. Iodine-mediated dehydrogenation generally gives higher propylene yields compared to the conventional dehydrogenation routes \[10.1021/acs.chemrev.6b00551\]. Recently, Stucky et al. developed a low-temperature route for propane dehydrogenation by using bihalogens (Br2 and I2) as the mediators. A high yield of C3H6+C3H7X (X = Br and I) up to 80% was attained at moderate reaction temperatures below 800 K. The interplay between Br2 and I2 was believed to be crucial, combining the high reactivity of bromine and high selectivity of iodine \[10.1021/acs.chemrev.6b00551\].

                Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: Considering the advancements and findings discussed in the file, there lies an opportunity to explore emerging fields and innovative methodologies. Future research endeavors might focus on the development of novel catalysts that can further enhance the selectivity and yield of propene from propane dehydrogenation. The interplay between different halogens, such as bromine and iodine, offers a promising direction for the design of more efficient and selective dehydrogenation processes. The understanding of the functions of metal iodides in the dehydrogenation process could lead to the development of new catalysts that can operate at lower temperatures and with higher activity. The exploration of alternative halogen sources and the optimization of reaction conditions could also contribute to the improvement of the overall process efficiency. The development of sustainable and environmentally friendly processes for propane dehydrogenation is another important direction for future research.
