                Halogen-assisted methods for selective propane dehydrogenation have been extensively explored, offering a unique role in the dehydrogenation of various alkanes, affording an exceptionally high selectivity to the respective alkenes \[10.1021/acs.chemrev.6b00551\]. The methods include iodine-mediated dehydrogenation, alkali metal chloride-catalyzed oxidative dehydrogenation, metal iodide-catalyzed oxidative dehydrogenation, and bihalogen-aided dehydrogenation. Iodine-mediated dehydrogenation involves the substitution of molecular iodine with hydrocarbons, but iodine is poorly reactive toward saturated hydrocarbons. A free radical mechanism was proposed for the stoichiometric iodination, consisting of successive hydrogen abstraction reactions involving both atomic and molecular iodine \[10.1021/acs.chemrev.6b00551\]. Molten salts (metal chlorides and iodides) catalyzed oxidative dehydrogenation uses supported alkali metal chloride catalysts, which have been demonstrated to be one of the most promising candidates for the oxidative dehydrogenation of light aliphatic alkanes (C2C4) to olefins. The promotional effect of chlorides in these catalysts was reported by Lercher et al., who compared the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane between Li/Dy2O3MgO and LiCl/Dy2O3MgO and found that the chloride-modified catalysts were ten times more active than the chloride-free ones \[10.1021/acs.chemrev.6b00551\]. Oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes can also be catalyzed by iodide-based molten salts. The functions of metal iodides in the dehydrogenation have not been well-understood, but the consensus is that they act as a mediator to adsorb and release I2 \[10.1021/acs.chemrev.6b00551\]. An interesting oxidative dehydrogenation process for various hydrocarbons, based on metal iodides, was developed by Shell \[10.1021/acs.chemrev.6b00551\]. Propane dehydrogenation to propylene has been extensively explored as an alternative approach to supplement the current propylene production based on steam cracking, fluidic catalytic cracking of naphtha and other hydrocarbons, and SAPO-34 catalyzed methanol to mixed olefins. Iodine-mediated dehydrogenation generally gives higher propylene yields compared to the conventional dehydrogenation routes \[10.1021/acs.chemrev.6b00551\]. Recently, Stucky et al. developed a low-temperature route for propane dehydrogenation by using bihalogens (Br2 and I2) as the mediators. A high yield of C3H6+C3H7X (X = Br and I) up to 80% was attained at moderate reaction temperatures below 800 K. The interplay between Br2 and I2 was believed to be crucial, combining the high reactivity of bromine and high selectivity of iodine \[10.1021/acs.chemrev.6b00551\].

                Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: Taking into consideration the advancements and findings discussed in the file, there lies an opportunity to explore emerging fields and innovative methodologies. Future research endeavors might focus on the development of more efficient and selective catalysts for halogen-assisted propane dehydrogenation, particularly in the area of bihalogen-aided dehydrogenation. The interplay between different halogens, such as bromine and iodine, presents a promising avenue for enhancing the reactivity and selectivity of the process. Additionally, the use of molten metal halide salts as catalysts offers a potential route for improving the conversion rates and selectivity of propane to propene. The functions of metal iodides in the dehydrogenation process remain a subject of ongoing research, and a deeper understanding of their role could lead to the design of more effective catalysts. The development of new catalytic systems that can operate at lower temperatures and pressures, while maintaining high selectivity and activity, is also a critical area for future research. The use of renewable energy sources, such as solar or wind power, to drive the dehydrogenation process could also be explored as a means of reducing the environmental impact of the process. Finally, the integration of halogen-assisted propane dehydrogenation with other processes, such as steam cracking or catalytic cracking, could lead to more efficient and sustainable production of propene.
