Halogen-assisted methods for selective propane dehydrogenation have been extensively explored, offering a unique role in the dehydrogenation of various alkanes, affording an exceptionally high selectivity to the respective alkenes \[10.1021/acs.chemrev.6b00551\]. The methods include iodine-mediated dehydrogenation, alkali metal chloride-catalyzed oxidative dehydrogenation, metal iodide-catalyzed oxidative dehydrogenation, and bihalogen-aided dehydrogenation. Iodine-mediated dehydrogenation involves the substitution of molecular iodine with hydrocarbons, but iodine is poorly reactive toward saturated hydrocarbons \[10.1021/acs.chemrev.6b00551\]. Molten salts (metal chlorides and iodides) catalyzed oxidative dehydrogenation uses supported alkali metal chloride catalysts, which have been demonstrated to be one of the most promising candidates for the oxidative dehydrogenation of light aliphatic alkanes (C2C4) to olefins \[10.1021/acs.chemrev.6b00551\]. Oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes can also be catalyzed by iodide-based molten salts \[10.1021/acs.chemrev.6b00551\]. Recently, Stucky et al. developed a low-temperature route for propane dehydrogenation by using bihalogens (Br2 and I2) as the mediators, achieving a high yield of C3H6+C3H7X (X = Br and I) up to 80% at moderate reaction temperatures below 800 K \[10.1021/acs.chemrev.6b00551\]. The interplay between Br2 and I2 was believed to be crucial, combining the high reactivity of bromine and high selectivity of iodine \[10.1021/acs.chemrev.6b00551\]. Propane (C3H8) can be selectively dehydrogenated to propene (C3H6) through halogen-mediated pathways at relatively mild temperatures between 300 and 700 degrees Celsius \[10.1021/acscatal.0c03999\_11\]. The catalytic transformation of propane in these processes is distinct from other alkanes like methane and ethane due to the specific reactivity of each alkane \[10.1021/acscatal.0c03999\_11\].
                
                Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: The advancements in halogen-assisted methods for selective propane dehydrogenation have opened up new avenues for the production of propene. The unique role of halogens in the dehydrogenation of various alkanes, affording an exceptionally high selectivity to the respective alkenes, has been well-documented. The methods for selectively dehydrogenating propane to propene include iodine-mediated dehydrogenation, alkali metal chloride-catalyzed oxidative dehydrogenation, metal iodide-catalyzed oxidative dehydrogenation, and bihalogen-aided dehydrogenation. The interplay between Br2 and I2 in the bihalogen-aided dehydrogenation was believed to be crucial, combining the high reactivity of bromine and high selectivity of iodine. The catalytic transformation of propane in these processes is distinct from other alkanes like methane and ethane due to the specific reactivity of each alkane. Future research endeavors might focus on the development of new catalysts and the optimization of reaction conditions to further improve the selectivity and yield of propene. The exploration of new halogen-assisted methods for the dehydrogenation of other alkanes, such as butane and pentane, might also be a promising direction.

Halogen-assisted methods for selective propane dehydrogenation have been extensively studied, offering a range of approaches to convert propane (C3H8) to propene (C3H6) with high selectivity \[10.1021/acscatal.0c03999\_11\]. These methods include dehydrogenation with molecular halogens, oxidative dehydrogenation in the presence of halogen and oxygen, propane oxyhalogenation using halides and oxygen, and molten metal halide salts assisted oxidative dehydrogenation \[10.1021/acscatal.0c03999\_11\]. The catalytic transformation of propane in these processes is distinct from other alkanes like methane and ethane due to the specific reactivity of each alkane \[10.1021/acscatal.0c03999\_11\].

Iodine-mediated dehydrogenation involves the substitution of molecular iodine with hydrocarbons, but iodine is poorly reactive toward saturated hydrocarbons \[10.1021/acs.chemrev.6b00551\]. A free radical mechanism was proposed for the stoichiometric iodination, consisting of successive hydrogen abstraction reactions involving both atomic and molecular iodine \[10.1021/acs.chemrev.6b00551\]. Molten salts (metal chlorides and iodides) catalyzed oxidative dehydrogenation uses supported alkali metal chloride catalysts, which have been demonstrated to be one of the most promising candidates for the oxidative dehydrogenation of light aliphatic alkanes (C2C4) to olefins \[10.1021/acs.chemrev.6b00551\]. Oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes can also be catalyzed by iodide-based molten salts \[10.1021/acs.chemrev.6b00551\]. An interesting oxidative dehydrogenation process for various hydrocarbons, based on metal iodides, was developed by Shell \[10.1021/acs.chemrev.6b00551\]. Propane dehydrogenation to propylene has been extensively explored as an alternative approach to supplement the current propylene production based on steam cracking, fluidic catalytic cracking of naphtha and other hydrocarbons, and SAPO-34 catalyzed methanol to mixed olefins \[10.1021/acs.chemrev.6b00551\]. Iodine-mediated dehydrogenation generally gives higher propylene yields compared to the conventional dehydrogenation routes \[10.1021/acs.chemrev.6b00551\]. Recently, Stucky et al. developed a low-temperature route for propane dehydrogenation by using bihalogens (Br2 and I2) as the mediators \[10.1021/acs.chemrev.6b00551\].

                Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: The advancements in halogen-assisted methods for selective propane dehydrogenation have opened up new avenues for the production of propene. The unique role of halogens in these processes, particularly the interplay between different halogens, offers a promising direction for future research. The development of low-temperature routes using bihalogens as mediators, such as the work by Stucky et al., highlights the potential for more efficient and environmentally friendly processes. The functions of metal iodides in the dehydrogenation, while not well-understood, present an opportunity for further investigation. The exploration of novel catalysts and reaction conditions that can enhance the selectivity and yield of propene while minimizing byproducts and energy consumption is a critical area for future research. The integration of computational methods with experimental studies could provide deeper insights into the mechanisms of these reactions and guide the design of more effective catalysts. The potential for combining halogen-assisted methods with other processes, such as steam cracking or catalytic cracking, to improve overall efficiency and product distribution is also worth exploring. The development of sustainable and economically viable processes for propane dehydrogenation is crucial for meeting the growing demand for propene in the chemical industry.
