Halogen-assisted methods for selective propane dehydrogenation have been extensively explored, offering a unique role in the dehydrogenation of various alkanes, affording an exceptionally high selectivity to the respective alkenes \[10.1021/acs.chemrev.6b00551\]. The methods include iodine-mediated dehydrogenation, alkali metal chloride-catalyzed oxidative dehydrogenation, metal iodide-catalyzed oxidative dehydrogenation, and bihalogen-aided dehydrogenation. Iodine-mediated dehydrogenation involves the substitution of molecular iodine with hydrocarbons, but iodine is poorly reactive toward saturated hydrocarbons. A free radical mechanism was proposed for the stoichiometric iodination, consisting of successive hydrogen abstraction reactions involving both atomic and molecular iodine \[10.1021/acs.chemrev.6b00551\]. Molten salts (metal chlorides and iodides) catalyzed oxidative dehydrogenation uses supported alkali metal chloride catalysts, which have been demonstrated to be one of the most promising candidates for the oxidative dehydrogenation of light aliphatic alkanes (C2C4) to olefins \[10.1021/acs.chemrev.6b00551\]. Oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes can also be catalyzed by iodide-based molten salts. The functions of metal iodides in the dehydrogenation have not been well-understood, but the consensus is that they act as a mediator to adsorb and release I2 \[10.1021/acs.chemrev.6b00551\]. An interesting oxidative dehydrogenation process for various hydrocarbons, based on metal iodides, was developed by Shell \[10.1021/acs.chemrev.6b00551\]. Propane dehydrogenation to propylene has been extensively explored as an alternative approach to supplement the current propylene production based on steam cracking, fluidic catalytic cracking of naphtha and other hydrocarbons, and SAPO-34 catalyzed methanol to mixed olefins. Iodine-mediated dehydrogenation generally gives higher propylene yields compared to the conventional dehydrogenation routes \[10.1021/acs.chemrev.6b00551\]. Recently, Stucky et al. developed a low-temperature route for propane dehydrogenation by using bihalogens (Br2 and I2) as the mediators. A high yield of C3H6+C3H7X (X = Br and I) up to 80% was attained at moderate reaction temperatures below 800 K. The interplay between Br2 and I2 was believed to be crucial, combining the high reactivity of bromine and high selectivity of iodine \[10.1021/acs.chemrev.6b00551\].
                
                Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: Taking into consideration the advancements and findings discussed in the file, there lies an opportunity to explore emerging fields and innovative methodologies. Future research endeavors might focus on the development of more efficient and selective catalysts for halogen-assisted propane dehydrogenation. The interplay between different halogens and the role of metal halides in the dehydrogenation process warrant further investigation. The optimization of reaction conditions, such as temperature and pressure, could lead to improved yields and selectivity. Moreover, the integration of halogen-assisted methods with other dehydrogenation routes, such as steam cracking and catalytic cracking, could potentially enhance the overall efficiency of propene production. The exploration of novel halogen compounds and their effects on the dehydrogenation process could also open up new avenues for research. In addition, the development of sustainable and environmentally friendly processes for propane dehydrogenation is a critical area that requires attention. The use of renewable energy sources, such as solar and wind power, for the activation of halogens and the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions could be a promising direction for future research. The application of advanced computational methods, such as density functional theory (DFT) and molecular dynamics simulations, could provide insights into the reaction mechanisms and help in the design of more efficient catalysts. The collaboration between academia and industry could facilitate the translation of research findings into practical applications and contribute to the advancement of the field.

5.2. Halogen-Assisted Dehydrogenation
A selective activation of C3H8 can be achieved via halogen-mediated pathways under relatively mild temperatures between 300 and 700 °C. To obtain C3H6 from C3H8, different approaches can be used (Figure 22), such as the dehydrogenation with molecular halogens (X2), oxidative dehydrogenation in the presence of halogen (X2 + O2), propane oxyhalogenation via halides (HX + O2), and molten metal halide salts assisted ODHP (LiX + O2). It is important to note that the catalytic transformation of C3H8 in these routes is quite different from other alkanes such as methane and ethane because of the differences in reactivity of the respective alkanes. (45,46)


5.2.1. Propane Oxyhalogenation
The propane oxyhalogenation reaction proceeds via oxidation of hydrogen halide with O2, producing alkyl halide, alkene, and water (eqs 2-24&ndash;2-29). Theoretically, 100% halogen atom efficiency can be achieved in the presence of O2, whereas efficiency is limited to 50% for halo-dehydrogenation (eqs 2-18, 2-20, and 2-22) due to the formation of HX. (46) C3H6 selectivity during the C3H8 oxidative dehydrogenation is generally lower than that of C2H4 from C2H6 because of the presence of reactive allylic hydrogen atoms in the case of C3H6, which can lead to successive oxidation of C3H6. (246) It is important to note that during oxyhalogenation reactions, the alkane conversion can be enhanced due to the gas-phase reactions. The highly reactive radical species are liberated from the catalyst surface and allow the formation of desired and undesired products in the gas phase. To date, research has mainly focused on the propane oxychlorination (POC), including reports of a wide range of catalytic materials, such as metal oxides (i.e., CeO2), metal phosphates, and metal oxyhalides. On the other hand, propane oxybromination (POB) leads to much lower yields because of polyhalogenation and overoxidation.
5.2.1.1. CeO2-Based Catalyst
CeO2-based catalysts have been studied extensively because of their high activity toward hydrogen halide oxidation, alkane, and alkene oxyhalogenation. (247) Xie et al. have investigated bulk transition metal oxide catalysts (i.e., RuO2, Fe2O3, CuO, NiO) and rare earth metal oxides (i.e., CeO2, La2O3, Eu2O3) for POC. (49) Among transition metal oxides, Fe2O3, CuO, and NiO are unstable during the reaction, whereas RuO2 leads to the formation of COx as major products, indicating high reactivity of oxygen species on the RuO2 surface. Bulk CeO2 shows the highest C3H8 conversion (i.e., 29%) and a good C3H6 selectivity of 61% at 500 °C (Table 14). The POC is demonstrated to be structure-sensitive over various facets and morphology of CeO2. CeO2 nanorods (110 + 100 facet) are the most active for POC. (49) To improve activity and selectivity and suppress the overoxidation potential during POC, a solid solution of transition metal oxides with CeO2 has been investigated (Table 14). (49) In particular, 8% NiO&ndash;CeO2 demonstrates an excellent single pass yield up to 55% with 80% C3H6 selectivity, outperforming other catalysts with different compositions. Raman results demonstrate that the catalyst activity is correlated with surface oxygen vacancies. The band at 831 cm&ndash;1 due to O22&ndash; surface species is the strongest for 8% Ni&ndash;CeO2 followed by CeO2 nanorods and CeO2 nanocubes, while the bands for CeO2 nano-octahedra and CeO2 particles are too weak to be registered. Similarly, surface chloride coverage is determined to be crucial for controlling olefin selectivity, as evidenced by XPS results. (49)

The presence of HCl not only suppresses the reactivity toward oxidation products over CeO2 but also induces new active site pairs for selective C3H6 production. DFT calculations reveal that the reaction is initiated by the formation of peroxide species over oxygen vacancies, which can oxidize Cl&ndash; into Cl&bull;, and the surface-bound Cl&bull; radical is responsible for C&ndash;H activation. (49) DFT calculations combined with detailed kinetic analysis provide insights into the reaction mechanisms, in which the reaction proceeds via propyl chloride generation and subsequent dehydrochlorination into C3H6 over the catalyst surface, as illustrated in Figure 23. (49) The energy barrier of C&ndash;H activation on Ce4+&ndash;O2&ndash; (1.8 eV) is higher than that on Cl&bull; adjacent to O2&ndash; (0.9 eV), indicating that the latter pair is responsible for C3H8 activation. (248) It is generally agreed that the formation of propyl chloride inhibits the overoxidation. (49,248) The formation of Cl2 is found to be negligible in the presence of C3H8, suggesting gas-phase conversion is unlikely.

5.2.1.2. Metal Oxyhalide
While CeO2 exhibits the highest activity (Table 14), europium oxychloride (EuOCl) leads to better C3H6 selectivity (i.e., >95% with C3H8 conversion of 20%) during POC. (48,249) The excellent performance in the case of EuOCl can be rationalized by the unique balance of its mild redox nature that enables alkane activation, minimizes gas-phase reaction by inhibiting the evolution of Cl2 (Figure 24), and suppresses alkane overoxidation. Europium is predominantly found in Eu3+ with minor contributions from Eu2+ via XPS analysis. As suggested, the presence of a redox couple (Eu3+/Eu2+) is responsible for propane activation. (45) LaOCl is less selective toward C3H6 (i.e., 40% with C3H8 conversion of 51%) at 400 °C, in contrast to EuOCl (Table 14).

In the case of EuOBr, the POB reaction favors the formation of alkyl bromides (C3H7Br), resulting in poor C3H6 selectivity (i.e., 22% with C3H8 conversion of 45%) at 500 °C. (45) It is postulated that the C3H8 activation during POB occurs in the gas phase by the in situ generated Br2, leading to polyhalogenation, cracking, and combustion (Figure 25). (45) Characterization of the spent EuOBr catalyst reveals the presence of the EuBr2 and EuBr phases after POB reaction, indicating bromination of the catalyst; whereas the EuOBr phase is stable during HBr oxidation and methane oxybromination in contrast to POC. (250) The bromination of the catalyst is formed due to the reduction of the catalyst surface by the C3H7Br generated in situ during the reaction.


5.1.1.3. Metal Phosphates
Transition metal phosphates such as V, Ti, Mn, Cr, Fe, Co, Ni, and Cu have been investigated for the oxyhalogenation reaction of alkanes (Table 14). (50,249) The product distribution is strongly dependent on the nature of catalyst and the type of halogen. Among the metal phosphates, CrPO4 and FePO4 have shown excellent C3H6 selectivity (i.e., > 95%) during C3H8 oxychlorination. In contrast, Mn-, Ni-, Co-, and Ti-based phosphates result in cracking, V-phosphate only yields oxidation products, and Cu-phosphate favors the formation of chlorinated hydrocarbons. CrPO4 exhibits the maximum C3H6 yield ∼50% with selectivity of ∼95%. (50) Similar to EuOBr, vanadium-phosphate (VPO) shows 35% C3H8 conversion and 24% C3H6 selectivity during POB, but with a yield as low as 8% (Table 14). (251)
Pérez-Ramírez and co-workers describe several kinetic parameters to explain the differences in activity and selectivity toward different products over different catalysts. (50) In particular, the catalytic ability for the oxidation of HCl to molecular Cl2 is quantified based on the temperature at which 10% conversion of HCl oxidation (T10(HCL)) can be achieved (Figure 24). Similarly, the trends toward dehydrochlorination of C3H7Cl, cracking, and oxidation of propane are investigated for all catalysts. As shown in Figure 24, the rate of propane consumption via POC reaction correlates linearly with catalyst ability to evolve molecular Cl2 during oxidation of HCl. The high C3H6 selectivity over CrPO4 is attributed to the fast dehydrochlorination kinetics in combination with a low propensity to cracking and overoxidation, as well as hindered ability to evolve Cl2.
Operando photoelectron photoion coincidence (PEPICO) spectroscopy enables the detection of reactants, products, and short-lived intermediates such as radicals under reaction conditions. Recently, PEPICO has been applied in propane oxyhalogenation over the CrPO4 catalyst to shed light on mechanisms, especially in the gas phase. (246) Operando PEPICO reveals that neither Cl&bull; nor Cl2 are present under POC reaction conditions. This indicates that propane activation occurs primarily on the catalyst surface, namely, a surface-confined mechanism, and proceeds via the formation of C3H7Cl, followed by fast dehydrochlorination to yield olefins. This is in line with the kinetic studies and corroborates that propane oxychlorination proceeds via surface-driven reaction pathways. (50,246)
The propane oxybromination chemistry leads to a lower propylene yield due to the formation of coke, cracking, and oxidation products (COx), as well as brominated hydrocarbons (such as C3H7Br and C3H5Br) over VOPO4/CrPO4/EuOBr. (45,246,251,252) Detailed kinetic analysis, complemented by operando PEPICO, demonstrates that C3H8 activation proceeds in the gas phase with in situ generated bromine species (Br&bull;/Br2) via catalytic HBr oxidation over CrPO4. The evolution of reactive intermediates, such as Br&bull;, is correlated with C3H6 formation via operando PEPICO with increasing temperatures indicates that reaction takes place in gas phase primarily. Similar to POC, POB also proceeds through the formation of propyl halide, which subsequently undergo dehydrohalogenation to yield C3H6. (246) Further, this technique sheds light on the coking and cracking reaction pathways observed under oxybromination reaction conditions during POB (Figure 25). The presence of C3 radicals due to the resonance stabilization prolongs their lifetime in the reactor, leading to coke formation. The coke formation proceeds via consecutive hydrogen abstraction of 2-propyl by Br&bull; to yield allyl and propargyl species which results in the formation of coke precursors such as benzene. Additionally, the cracking of C&ndash;C bonds may also form ethyl and methyl radicals. The presence of methyl radicals likely facilitates the formation of C4&ndash;C6 species through chain growth, thus contributing to the formation of coke precursors from alternative pathways. (246)
In brief, the relationships between propane oxyhalogenation, gas-phase halogenation, C3H7X elimination, hydrogen halide oxidation, and propane oxidative dehydrogenation have been elucidated over a wide set of catalysts. Results suggest that the selectivity in the oxyhalogenation reaction depends on (i) the ability of the catalyst to selectively dehydrogenate the propyl halide into propylene, (ii) hindered ability to evolve molecular halogen, and (iii) suppressed overoxidation and combustion tendency. Of note, the high reactivity toward HCl oxidation can give rise to undesired products because of the gas-phase reactions, indicating the need for a balanced redox nature. (48,249,253)
5.2.2. Other Halogen-Assisted Systems
Propane halo-dehydrogenation by Cl2 has been studied over a 0.28% Ru/TiO2 catalyst that achieves ∼50% C3H8 conversion and 95% C3H6 selectivity at 400 °C. (254) The HCl generated during the reaction requires an oxychlorination reactor to recycle Cl2 via the Deacon reaction (4 HCl + O2 → Cl2 + 2H2O). Alkali metal chloride catalysts also have been probed for oxidative dehydrogenation of C3H8, though scarcely. (46,255,256) The C3H6 yield obtained over Li&ndash;K/Dy2O3 is below 20% at 600 °C, along with propylene selectivity lower than 60%. (255)
The effect of organochloride compounds, such as CCl4, has also been studied for oxidative propane dehydrogenation over CeO2, Fe2O3, and CuO, in which improved C3H6 selectivities of up to 80% are evident at P(CCl4) = 0.17 kPa under oxygen-limiting conditions. (257−259) These studies are conducted under relatively low conversions (i.e., 25% at 450 °C and FT/W ∼ 4000&ndash;6000 cm3 h&ndash;1 gcat&ndash;1), which limits the C3H8 yield below 20%. Of note, the presence of chlorinated species near the surface region and in the gas phase accounts for the improved performance with the addition of CCl4. (257,258) Oxychlorination on a Pt&ndash;Sn/θ-Al2O3 catalyst also shows the restoration of catalytic activity during conventional DHP because of the excellent dispersion of sintered Pt agglomerates. (260)
5.2.3. Molten Salt-Catalyzed Oxidative Dehydrogenation
The oxidative dehydrogenation of various hydrocarbons on metal iodide-based molten salt was first developed by Shell. (261,262) In those approaches, the ODHP reaction can occur between 450 and 600 °C in the presence of metal iodides (i.e., LiI, CdI2, ZnI2, and PbI2), and a C3H6 yield up to 70% can be achieved (Table 15). The molten salt catalyzed oxidative dehydrogenation can be considered a special case of halogen-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation, in which a halogen, such as I2, is generated in situ via the reaction between metal iodide and oxygen. The reaction, however, primarily takes place in the gas phase.

It is generally accepted that the interplay between the metal iodide and metal oxide (LiI/LiOH) plays an important role in the generation of iodine to initiate a radical chain reaction. (263,264) A constant-temperature ab initio molecular dynamics study has been used to investigate the reactions between LiI and gaseous molecules (O2, H2O, and I2). (265) Results demonstrate that the most favorable process is the formation of gaseous I2, coproduced with LiOH or Li2O, depending on the availability of water; the reaction most likely occurs in the gas phase. These observations are supported by the fact that a similar product distribution is observed using either LiI/LiOH or I2 as an iodine source for the dehydrogenation reaction. (263) The high C3H6 yield can be achieved if the molten salt meets the following prerequisites: (i) the metal oxide can be converted into the corresponding iodide by exposure to iodide species under the reaction conditions and vice versa and (ii) I2 (g) can be obtained by oxidation under dehydrogenation conditions. (261) Similarly, an optimal concentration of O2 is vital for this reaction because (i) it is responsible for generating iodine radicals for chain reactions and (ii) excess oxygen can cause combustion reactions. (263,264) It is important to note that the corrosive nature of the mixture of molten salt, I2, HI, and alkyl halides, is a serious concern that might impair efforts for its commercial applications.
