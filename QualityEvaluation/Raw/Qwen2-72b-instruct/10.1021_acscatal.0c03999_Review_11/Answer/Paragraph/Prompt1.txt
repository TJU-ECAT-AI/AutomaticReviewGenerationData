A free radical mechanism was proposed for the stoichiometric iodination, consisting of successive hydrogen abstraction reactions involving both atomic and molecular iodine. Molten salts (metal chlorides and iodides) catalyzed oxidative dehydrogenation uses supported alkali metal chloride catalysts, which have been demonstrated to be one of the most promising candidates for the oxidative dehydrogenation of light aliphatic alkanes (C2C4) to olefins. The promotional effect of chlorides in these catalysts was reported by Lercher et al., who compared the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane between Li/Dy2O3MgO and LiCl/Dy2O3MgO and found that the chloride-modified catalysts were ten times more active than the chloride-free ones. A reverse Mars-van Krevelen mechanism was suggested for the activation of ethane over KCl-LiCl/Dy2O3MgO. Oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes can also be catalyzed by iodide-based molten salts. The functions of metal iodides in the dehydrogenation have not been well-understood, but the consensus is that they act as a mediator to adsorb and release I2. An interesting oxidative dehydrogenation process for various hydrocarbons, based on metal iodides, was developed by Shell. Propane dehydrogenation to propylene has been extensively explored as an alternative approach to supplement the current propylene production based on steam cracking, fluidic catalytic cracking of naphtha and other hydrocarbons, and SAPO-34 catalyzed methanol to mixed olefins. Iodine-mediated dehydrogenation generally gives higher propylene yields compared to the conventional dehydrogenation routes. Recently, Stucky et al. developed a low-temperature route for propane dehydrogenation by using bihalogens (Br2 and I2) as the mediators. A high yield of C3H6+C3H7X (X = Br and I) up to 80% was attained at moderate reaction temperatures below 800 K. The interplay between Br2 and I2 was believed to be crucial, combining the high reactivity of bromine and high selectivity of iodine.", "Doi": "10.1021/acs.chemrev.6b00551"},
