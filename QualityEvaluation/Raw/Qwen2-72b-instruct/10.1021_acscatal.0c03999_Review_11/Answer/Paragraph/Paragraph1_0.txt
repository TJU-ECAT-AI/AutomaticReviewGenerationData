                Halogen-assisted methods for selective propane dehydrogenation have been extensively explored, offering a unique role in the dehydrogenation of various alkanes, affording an exceptionally high selectivity to the respective alkenes \[10.1021/acs.chemrev.6b00551\]. The methods include iodine-mediated dehydrogenation, alkali metal chloride-catalyzed oxidative dehydrogenation, metal iodide-catalyzed oxidative dehydrogenation, and bihalogen-aided dehydrogenation. Iodine-mediated dehydrogenation involves the substitution of molecular iodine with hydrocarbons, but iodine is poorly reactive toward saturated hydrocarbons. A free radical mechanism was proposed for the stoichiometric iodination, consisting of successive hydrogen abstraction reactions involving both atomic and molecular iodine \[10.1021/acs.chemrev.6b00551\]. Molten salts (metal chlorides and iodides) catalyzed oxidative dehydrogenation uses supported alkali metal chloride catalysts, which have been demonstrated to be one of the most promising candidates for the oxidative dehydrogenation of light aliphatic alkanes (C2C4) to olefins \[10.1021/acs.chemrev.6b00551\]. Oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes can also be catalyzed by iodide-based molten salts. The functions of metal iodides in the dehydrogenation have not been well-understood, but the consensus is that they act as a mediator to adsorb and release I2 \[10.1021/acs.chemrev.6b00551\]. An interesting oxidative dehydrogenation process for various hydrocarbons, based on metal iodides, was developed by Shell \[10.1021/acs.chemrev.6b00551\]. Propane dehydrogenation to propylene has been extensively explored as an alternative approach to supplement the current propylene production based on steam cracking, fluidic catalytic cracking of naphtha and other hydrocarbons, and SAPO-34 catalyzed methanol to mixed olefins. Iodine-mediated dehydrogenation generally gives higher propylene yields compared to the conventional dehydrogenation routes \[10.1021/acs.chemrev.6b00551\]. Recently, Stucky et al. developed a low-temperature route for propane dehydrogenation by using bihalogens (Br2 and I2) as the mediators. A high yield of C3H6+C3H7X (X = Br and I) up to 80% was attained at moderate reaction temperatures below 800 K. The interplay between Br2 and I2 was believed to be crucial, combining the high reactivity of bromine and high selectivity of iodine \[10.1021/acs.chemrev.6b00551\].

                Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: Taking into consideration the advancements and findings discussed in the file, there lies an opportunity to explore emerging fields and innovative methodologies. Future research endeavors might focus on the development of more efficient and selective catalysts for halogen-assisted propane dehydrogenation. The interplay between different halogens and the role of metal halides in the dehydrogenation process warrant further investigation. The optimization of reaction conditions, such as temperature and pressure, could lead to improved yields and selectivity. Moreover, the integration of halogen-assisted methods with other dehydrogenation routes, such as steam cracking and catalytic cracking, could potentially enhance the overall efficiency of propene production. The exploration of novel halogen compounds and their effects on the dehydrogenation process could also open up new avenues for research. In addition, the development of sustainable and environmentally friendly processes for propane dehydrogenation is a critical area that requires attention. The use of renewable energy sources, such as solar and wind power, for the activation of halogens and the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions could be a promising direction for future research. The application of advanced computational methods, such as density functional theory (DFT) and molecular dynamics simulations, could provide insights into the reaction mechanisms and help in the design of more efficient catalysts. The collaboration between academia and industry could facilitate the translation of research findings into practical applications and contribute to the advancement of the field.
