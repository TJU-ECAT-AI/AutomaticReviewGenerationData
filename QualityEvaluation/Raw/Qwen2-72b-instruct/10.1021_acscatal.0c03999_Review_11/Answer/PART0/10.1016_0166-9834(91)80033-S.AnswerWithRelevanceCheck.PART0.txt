          The document does not provide a comparison of various halogen-assisted methods for selectively dehydrogenating propane to propene. It focuses on the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane in the presence of iodine and air using lithium hydroxide/lithium iodide melts. The reaction conditions are described as occurring at temperatures between 700-900 K, with the optimal conditions for high propene selectivity being at lower temperatures. The document does not explain why propane's reactivity in these processes differs significantly from that of other alkanes such as methane and ethane.

          该文件没有比较各种卤素辅助方法选择性地将丙烷脱氢为丙烯。它专注于在碘和空气存在下使用氢氧化锂/碘化锂熔体对丙烷进行氧化脱氢。反应条件描述为在700-900 K的温度下进行，对于高丙烯选择性，最佳条件是在较低温度下。文档没有解释为什么丙烷在这些过程中的反应性与甲烷和乙烷等其他烷烃有显著差异。
