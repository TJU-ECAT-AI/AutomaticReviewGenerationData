Abstract: The ethylbenzene dehydrogenation and the oxidation ability of CO2 on the V2O5(001) 
surface are systematically studied by the density functional theory method. Results show that 
among all three lattice oxygen sites on V2O5(001): the vanadyl oxygen O(1), the bridge oxygen 
O(2), and the three-coordinate oxygen O(3), the O(1) site is the active site for the ethylbenzene 
dehydrogenation. With the production of styrene, the lattice oxygen O(1) is removed by H2O 
release. As a soft oxidant, CO2 cannot re-oxidize the defected V2O5(001) in time due to the 
relatively high activation energy, which gradually leads to the deactivation of the catalyst. 
Keywords: periodic density functional theory; V2O5(001); lattice oxygen; ethylbenzene

which is energy efficient and environmentally friendly, has attracted increasing attention over the 
years. Among various catalysts, the vanadium oxide-based (V) catalysts exhibit higher catalytic 
efficiency during the dehydrogenation of EB in CO2 (Sakurai et al., 2000; Sun et al., 2002). This is 
mainly attributed to the dehydrogenation of EB occurring on the V catalysts being an oxidative 
dehydrogenation (ODH) (Chaar et al., 1988; Corma et al., 1993). The widespread Mars-van 
Krevelen mechanism gives a good illustration of ODH (Creaser et al., 1999; Oyama, 1991), which 
contains two reaction steps: (i) the hydrocarbon is activated by the lattice oxygen, while the 
reactive surface is reduced by the hydrocarbon and (ii) the gas-phase oxygen then re-oxidizes the 
surface. Under the reaction system described in this paper, the gas-phase oxygen is CO2. 
However, the missing lattice oxygen is still a dominant cause for catalyst deactivation. Zhang 
et al. (2013) and Sakurai et al. (2002) pointed out that the reduction of V5+ gave rise to the catalyst 
deactivation. Chen et al. (2006) noted that the formation of oxygen vacancies with the reduction of 
metal cation was related to the catalytic activity. Many experimental results (Wachs, 2005; Wang 
et al., 2010) attributed the appearance of these phenomena to the structure of the vanadium species. 
The vanadium species which is isolated or highly dispersed on the support, exhibit high activity 
for EB ODH in CO2. However, with the increasing of vanadium loading on the V catalysts, the 
V2O5 crystalline formation and the catalyst activity will decrease, and the V catalysts deactivate 
soon (Chen et al., 2006; Chen et al., 2012; Xiang et al., 2008). This perhaps is because CO2 as the 
weak oxidant can hardly re-oxidize the reduced V2O5 crystalline when the oxygen vacancies are 
created by the hydrocarbon dehydrogenation (Sakurai et al., 2000). Nevertheless, this is only 
speculation from experiments.

It is well established that there are three kinds of lattice oxygen on the V catalysts (Ramirez 
et al., 1990): (i) the vanadyl oxygen, O(1), (ii) the bridge oxygen, O(2) and (iii) the 
three-coordinate oxygen, O(3). Up to now, there is still no research about which lattice oxygen is 
the main active site in the EB dehydrogenation. For other reactions taking place on the V-based 
catalyst, the O(1) site was regarded as an important active site by many researchers (Mori et al., 
1985; Oyama, 1991; Tarama et al., 1968), while Alexopoulos et al. (2012) suggested that the O(2) 
site was more selective. With regards to the O(3) site, Wachs (2005) and Ono et al. (1997) both 
held the idea that the O(3) site was the most active site. 
In this paper, we mainly focus on interpreting the phenomena on V2O5 crystalline through the 
DFT method. The V2O5 (001) is selected to model the V2O5 crystalline because the (001) plane is 
the most thermodynamically stable plane of V2O5 (Ranea et al., 1999), and the three kinds of 
lattice oxygen on the V2O5(001) surface are exhibited in Fig. 1. We first explore the mechanisms 
of EB dehydrogenation over the three types of lattice oxygen of V2O5(001) and find out the lattice 
oxygen responsible for the EB dehydrogenation, to explain the reactivity of the V2O5 crystalline 
and whether CO2 can re-oxidized the catalyst. 
2. Computational models and methods 
2.1 Catalyst models 
Bulk V2O5 forms a layer-type orthorhombic lattice with space group pmmn (No.59) and the 
lattice parameters are: a=11.535 Å, b=3.603Å, c=4.442Å (Yin et al., 1998). The V2O5 bulk is an 
easily cleaved parallel (001) plane, due to the weak Van der Waals force between the layers 
4 / 18 

(Chakrabarti et al., 1999; Ganduglia-Pirovano and Sauer, 2004; Yin et al., 1998). It has been 
proven that the second layer has little influence on the properties of the up-layers based on the 
periodic density function theory (DFT) calculations (Alexopoulos et al., 2012), and our tests with 
the double-layer and single-layer show that the surface energy (for each atom) and the C-H bond 
activation energy (on O(1) sites) have little difference. Therefore, a single-layer slab is adequate to 
model the defect-free V2O5(001). However, the formation of oxygen vacancy gives rise to the 
creation of an interlayer bond. In order to reduce computation load in this study, the oxidation 
reaction of dehydrogenation of EB at the early stages is simulated on a single-layer slab, then the 
formation of H2O and the process of CO2 oxidation the reduced V2O5(001) surface are simulated 
on the double-layer slab. 
As seen from Fig. 1, one (1×3) supercell (11.54×10.81 Å) is used in the calculation so as to 
reduce the interaction between adsorbed molecules. The vacuum gap of 1.4 nm is sufficient to 
eliminate the interaction between the slabs. During the calculation, all atoms are allowed to relax 
freely. 
2.2 Computational methods 
The detailed periodic density function theoretical (DFT) study is employed with the 
Cambridge Serial Total Energy Package (CASTEP) plane-wave code (Yin et al., 1998). The 
exchange and correlation interaction are modeled using the Perdew - Burke - Ernzerh of functional 
(PBE) within the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) (Dai et al., 2008). A plane-wave 
energy cut-off of 500 eV has been used in all cases. Electron-ion interactions are described by the 
ultra soft pseudo potential. The convergence criteria for the structure optimization and energy 
5 / 18 

calculation are set as follows: (a) a self-consistent field (SCF) tolerance of 2.0×10-6 eV/atom, (b) a 
total energy difference tolerance of 1.0×10-5 eV/atom, (c) a maximum force tolerance of 5.0×10-2 
eV/Å, and (d) a maximum displacement tolerance of 2.0×10-3 Å. Spin-polarization is considered 
during all the calculations. Transition states (TS) are located by the complete LST/QST method 
(Wang et al., 2007). 
The Brillouin-zone sampling is based on the Monkhorst-Pack division scheme. A 2×2×1 
k-point mesh is applied for the (1×3) supercell of V2O5(001). Adsorption energies of ‘adsorbate’ 
on the surface are calculated as follows: 
Eads= E(adsorbate-substrate) – (Eadsorbate+ Esubstrate) 
where E(adsorbate-substrate) refers to the energy of the physical-adsorption or chemical-adsorption, 
Eadsorbate refers to the energy of the ‘adsorbate’ in the gas phase, and Esubstrate refers to the energy of 
the clean V2O5(001) surface. Negative Eads values indicate exothermic adsorption, while positive 
Eads values indicate endothermic adsorption. 
3. Results and discussion 
3.1 Adsorption of EB  
The EB molecular adsorbing over three distinct lattice oxygen sites on V2O5(001) are 
observed. Considering the possibilities of EB adsorbing on the surface, we have examined 
different orientations of EB near the O(1), O(2), and O(3) sites. The most stable adsorption 
structure of EB on the three lattice oxygen sites are shown in Fig. 2. It is found that only a weak 
physisorption appears in all cases with no significant changes in the EB and surface structure. 
6 / 18 

Moreover, among the three different active sites, the preferred location for EB is on the O(2) site 
(-0.12 eV for O(1), -0.17 eV for O(2), and -0.10 eV for O(3)). As shown in Fig. 2b-c, there is a 
really big distance between the mass center of EB and mass centers of the O(2) and O(3) sites, 
which is mainly due to the important steric hindrance. The physisorption configuration of EB 
represents a precursor state of the subsequent catalytic reaction and can be used as a basic 
construction to reveal insights into the next catalytic steps (Kämper et al., 2000). 
Therefore, although EB is preferentially physically-adsorbed on the O(2) site, the O(1) and 
O(3) sites are not so far away from the EB, and also the adsorption energies of EB on the three 
lattice oxygen sites have a slight difference. Hence the configuration of EB physisorption on the 
O(1), O(2), and O(3) sites should be taken into account as precursors for subsequent catalytic 
reactions (Alexopoulos et al., 2012). 
3.2 C-H bond activation 
In the EB molecule, the breaking of the C-H bond is more favorable occurrence in the 
methylene group based on the principles of thermodynamics and dynamics (He et al., 2011). 
There are two different ways for the C-H bond activation on metal oxide (Mamedov and Cortés 
Corberán, 1995; Martin and Mirodatos, 1995). One is the heterolytic splitting which usually takes 
place on the surface with strong acid-base pairs. The other is the homolytic cleavage that is 
usually present on the O sites. Fu et al. (2006) had inferred that the heterolytic cleavage of the C-H 
bond for activation of propane on the V2O5(001) surface was impossible since there were no 
strong acid-base pairs presenting on the V2O5(001). Hence, we just examine the homolytic 
cleavage for the C-H bond of EB.  
7 / 18 

According to previous work (Alexopoulos et al., 2012; Fu et al., 2006; He et al., 2011), three 
possible homolytic cleavage mechanisms of C-H bond activation have been considered, as shown 
in Fig. 3. 
Mechanism A: the lattice O atom attacks and inserts into the C-H bond of the EB to form an 
alcoholic intermediate. Then the H atom of the alcoholic intermediate is transferred to another 
lattice O nearby, following the pathway 12a3. 
Mechanism B: a lattice O atom abstracts an H atom from the EB to generate an ethoxyphenyl 
radical in gas phase. It is then followed by the ethoxyphenyl radical rebound to an alternate 
oxygen layer, following the pathway 12b3, or it may rebound to the first lattice O atom to 
form an alcoholic intermediate, then the ethoxyphenyl radical transfers to another lattice O, 
following the pathway 2b2a. 
Mechanism C: a one-step reaction, the EB reacts with two adjacent O atoms in a concerted 
way. It follows the pathway 12c3. Among the three configurations, 2c is the transient state 
(TS). 
Considering that there are three precursors of EB physisorption configuration and three 
different O sites on the V2O5(001) surface, we employ the form O(m)-O(n)-X proposed by Dai et 
al. (Dai et al., 2008) to represent the various C-H bond activation pathways, of which m and n 
choose 1, 2, 3 and X is one of the A, B, C mechanisms. The first O(m) denotes the O site on the 
V2O5(001) which reacts with the EB initially, i.e. O(1)-O(1)-B is the O(1) site which abstracts an 
H atom from the EB producing an ethoxyphenyl radical in the gas phase. The ethoxyphenyl 
8 / 18 

radical then rebounds to another O(1) site, forming the structure of 3 (in Fig. 3) on O(1) sites. In 
addition, being taken as the reaction precursors, the C-H bonds of methylene group in EB 
molecule are all located above a pair of two adjacent same O sites. With regards to the mechanism 
C, herein we explored the C-H bond activated by two same lattice oxygen, namely the 
O(1)-O(1)-C, O(2)-O(2)-C and O(3)-O(3)-C. 
Before the activation of the C-H bond on the V2O5(001) is investigated, it is necessary to 
confirm the co-adsorbed configurations that are exhibited in Fig. 3. On the O(1) site, we have not 
been able to locate the alcoholic intermediate 2a, as seen from Fig. 4a. After optimization, its C-O 
bond is beyond the scope of chemical bond. On the O(2) and O(3) sites, as seen from Fig. 4b-d, 
because of the steric hindrances, the configuration of ethoxyphenyl species adsorbing on the O 
sites cannot be found as well, which leads to the nonexistence of co-adsorbed configurations 2a 
and 3 shown in Fig. 3. 
Consequently, on the O(1) site, we investigate the pathways of 12b3 and 12c3, 
namely the O(1)-O(1)-B and O(1)-O(1)-C. Otherwise, on the O(2) and O(3) sites, only the 
O(2)-O(1)-B and O(3)-O(1)-B (12b3 pathway) are observed.  
3.2.1 
C-H bond activation on O(1) site: O(1)-O(n)-X 
(a) The O(1)-O(1)-B pathway (12b3) 
In mechanism B, two pathways i.e. O(1)-O(1)-B and O(1)-O(2)-B share the same first step, 
namely, the H atom is abstracted by the O(1). It needs to overcome an activation barrier of 1.96 
eV, and the TS of this step has been located (TS1 in Fig. 5). At the TS1, the C-H bond of the 
9 / 18 

methylene group is elongated from 1.10 Å to 1.91Å, with the distance of H-O shortened to 1.26 Å. 
After the TS1, an ethoxyphenyl radical is formed in the gas phase (IM in Fig. 5). Then the 
ethoxyphenyl radical adsorbs on another lattice O site which could be the O(1) or O(2) site. 
However, it has been mentioned in the preceding section that the ethoxyphenyl radical cannot 
adsorb on the O(2) site, so we just need to investigate the O(1)-O(1)-B pathway. It can be 
concluded that the nearest O(1) site is the most favorable location site for the ethoxyphenyl radical 
and the reaction needs to overcome a reaction barrier of 1.46 eV. The TS of this step has been 
located (TS2 in Fig. 5). 
(b) The O(1)-O(1)-C pathway (12c.3.) 
In mechanism C, a ring transition state (TS3) on two adjacent O(1) atoms can be easily 
achieved with the reaction barrier of 1.86 eV. As seen from Fig. 5, in the configuration of TS3, the 
H-O bond of 1.00 Å is formed, and the distance between the ethoxyphenyl species to O(1) atom is 
3.32 Å. 
Overall, on the O(1) site, the O(1)-O(1)-C with the lowest energy pathway is more favorable 
than the O(1)-O(2)-C and O(1)-O(3)-C. 
3.2.2 
C-H bond activation on O(2) and O(3) site: O(2)/ O(3)-O(1)-B 
With regards to the O(2) and O(3) sites, the pathways of O(2)-O(n)-X and O(3)-O(n)-X are 
similar to O(1)-O(n)-X. However, because the ethoxyphenyl species could bound to the O(1) site 
only, we just observe the pathways of O(2)-O(1)-B and O(3)-O(1)-B. After the H atom is 
abstracted by the O(2) / O(3) site, the ethoxyphenyl radical will immigrate to the nearest O(1) site 
10 / 18 

and the configuration of TS and their relative energies are exhibited in Fig. 6 and Fig. 7. It is 
obvious that the reaction barriers of first step (3.13 eV on O(2) site, 3.51 eV on O(3) site) are 
really high, which may be caused by the large distance between the initial and terminal 
configurations. 
From the above results, we find that the O(1) sites play a key role during the C-H activation 
process, and the most beneficial pathway is O(1)-O(1)-C through the one step concert mechanism. 
3.3 ST formation 
To form ST, the adsorbed ethoxyphenyl species needs to release an H atom. The H atom can 
be abstracted by either the nearby O sites or the newly formed OH group. Based on the 
low-energy reaction pathways above, the formation of ST begins with the ethoxyphenyl species 
absorbed on O(1) site. We firstly examine the pathway with the H atom moving to the nearby O(1) 
site, the transition state and related energy profile are shown in Fig. 8. Nevertheless, the obtained 
energy barrier is 3.19 eV, which is quite high. It is therefore concluded that the ST formation from 
the H atom ending up at O(1) sites is kinetically difficult.  
The H atom may also be abstracted by the OH group, leading to the formation of H2O. In this 
process, a two-layer model of V2O5(001) surface is employed. As shown in Fig. 8, the ST is 
formed through the H atom of the ethoxyphenyl species on the O(1) site being abstracted by OH 
group on the nearby O(1) site. The reaction pathway needs to overcome an energy barrier of 2.32 
eV with the located TS1. 
11 / 18 

Compared with the H atom abstracted by the nearby O sites, it is more advantageous for the 
H atom to be abstracted by the OH group on the O(1) site. 
In summary, we deduce that the O(1) site is the active site for the EB dehydrogenation to 
produce ST. This agrees with most studies on V2O5(001) and that the ODH reaction of alkane is 
more likely to take place on the O(1) sites (Mori et al., 1985; Oyama, 1991; Tarama et al., 1968).  
3.4 H2O and H2 formation  
The H atoms from the EB eventually will leave the surface in either the form of H2 or H2O 
through the combination of two adjacent O-H groups on the surface. As shown in Fig. 9, the H 
atom is more favorable to generate H2O without a reaction barrier and exothermic, releasing 0.62 
eV. Moreover, we can find that the formation of H2O on the O(1) sites has weaken the O-V bond, 
and the V bound to H2O relax inward to bind with a second-layer O atom. The newly formed H2O 
molecules will quickly desorb from the surface, leading to the formation of surface O vacancies, 
and the interlayer bond of V-O will shorten from 2.14 Å to 1.77Å. The H2O desorption and the O 
vacancies formation finish in one step without the reaction energy barrier and endothermic process 
with 0.99 eV. From the process, we notice that desorption of H2O takes away the active lattice 
oxygen from the catalyst, which will gradually give rise to the decrease of catalyst activity. 
Alternatively, dissociation of H atoms from the surface by H2 can also take place with the 
energy barrier of 0.74 eV. During this process, the H-O bond is stretched to 1.64 and 1.51Å, while 
the H-H bond length is reduced to 0.80 Å. Thus, it can be seen that the release of H atoms is 
dominated by the form of H2O. 
12 / 18

3.5 Vanadium re-oxidation by CO2 
Based on the Mars-van Krevelen mechanism, after H2O molecules are released from the 
catalyst surface, the defective V2O5(001) surface needs to be re-oxidized by CO2 to keep the 
reaction cycle going.  
As shown in Fig. 10, the stable configuration (R) of CO2 absorbed on the defected V2O5(001) 
surface is found, with the adsorption energy of 0.11 eV. In the R configuration, the V-O bond is 
2.72 Å with an overlap-population of 0.08, while the overlap-population of the C-O bond in the 
CO2 molecule has a mere change of 0.02, which results in the high energy for breaking the C-O 
bond (3.16 eV) to oxidize the surface.  
Compared with the two steps of EB ODH to ST which consume the lattice oxygen 
persistently, re-oxidization of the defected V2O5(001) surface by CO2 needs to overcome much 
higher reaction barrier. Based on the Arrhenius-laws (Ilg and Barrat, 2007), lower activation 
energy means a higher reaction rate. Therefore we can conclude from the rate of CO2 oxidation, 
the reduced surface is much slower than the consummation of lattice oxygen. These results are in 
line with the experimental study (Sakurai et al., 2000). In this way, with the reaction progress of 
EB ODH in the presence of CO2, the V2O5(001) surface will be rapidly reduced. 
4. Conclusions 
To interpret the experimental phenomena that the V catalyst activity deactivated soon in the 
EB ODH with the formation of V2O5 crystalline, we employ the DFT method to study the EB 
ODH mechanisms on three different lattice oxygen sites of the V2O5(001) surface and the capacity 
13 / 18 

of CO2 to oxide the reduced surface. 
The EB dehydrogenation to ST in the presence of CO2 is favorably occurring on the vanadyl 
oxygen O(1) site of the V2O5(001) surface. With the production of ST, the formed H2O molecules 
will be removed from the surface, causing the O vacancies on the V2O5(001) surface. However, 
CO2 as a soft oxidant can hardly re-oxidize the defected V2O5(001) in time due to the high 
activation energy (3.16 eV). The missing active sites gradually give rise to the deactivation of the 
V2O5 catalysts.
