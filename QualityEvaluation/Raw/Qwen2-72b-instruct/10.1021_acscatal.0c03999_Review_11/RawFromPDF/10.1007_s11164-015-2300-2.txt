Abstract
Propane dehydrogenation and regeneration of Pt–Sn/h-Al2O3 catalysts
was evaluated with oxychlorination treatment. It was observed that the catalytic
activity was not fully recovered after coke burning followed by hydrogen reduction
process because of the unsatisfying recovery of Pt sintering. In this study, oxy-
chlorination treatment was additionally employed between coke burning and
hydrogen
reduction.

Introduction
Propylene and ethylene are the most useful light oleﬁns and they have been
produced by traditional cracking of hydrocarbon feedstock, such as reﬁnery
naphtha, condensate-derived naphtha, liqueﬁed petroleum gas, ethane, and propane.
When propane is used as a feedstock, propane dehydrogenation (PDH) can produce
propylene. Propane dehydrogenation reaction is shown in (Eq. 1) [1, 2].

Since PDH is an endothermic reaction requiring higher temperature, noble metal
or heavy metal catalysts are used to achieve economically attractive conversion.
While PDH needs high reaction temperatures in the range of 500–700 C, reaction
pressures are not severe, but near atmospheric pressure. PDH at higher temperatures
may increase the propylene yield, however, also leads to unfavorable side reactions
and accelerates catalyst deactivation as well. It was known that dehydrogenation
catalysts should be regenerated regularly [2, 3]. The regeneration process includes
coke burning to remove the deposits blamed for catalytic deactivation and hydrogen
reduction to redisperse sintered Pt (or Pt–Sn) particles in part. The sintering of Pt (or
Pt–Sn) particles can gradually become worse because of the repeated use of
dehydrogenation and coke burning [4]. Ideally, the catalyst used would restore the
original activity and original selectivity through a well-chosen regeneration process.
Among the various regeneration processes, it is noticeable that attractive restoration
of catalytic activity and selectivity was achieved by either coke burning/
oxychlorination or chloride addition/metals reduction [5].
Air has been often used as an oxygen source. Even a small amount of oxygen can
be critical to trigger coke burning. Temperatures must be carefully maintained in
order to prevent an uncontrollable exothermal reaction. If not, an exothermal
reaction will result in serious damage to metal crystallites as well as catalyst
support. Coke from dehydrogenation can be removed in a series of steps, where the
temperature or oxygen concentration is increased until there is no trace of coke on
the catalyst. It was reported that exothermic temperature was minimized by
controlling oxygen contents and heater programs [4, 5]. In addition, even with
controlled coke removal, the metal crystallites may become unavoidably sintered
during regeneration processes. As metal crystallites become larger in diameter, the
activity will be decreased. It was reported that metal redispersion can be affected by
appropriate amounts of oxygen, chloride, temperature, and reaction time [4, 5]. It
was also presented that oxychlorination induced the formation of oxychloridic
platinum compounds and motivated the effective redispersion of platinum during
the regeneration of naphtha reforming catalyst. Postulated was that the greater
mobility of chlorinated metal species can induce the redispersion of Pt effectively
[4, 5]. If this is true, redispersion can reduce the size of metal crystallites and also
result in the overall increase of metal surface area. In general, naphtha reforming
catalyst can be used after periodic regeneration by coke burning combined with
oxychlorination. Nevertheless, there is no attempt to investigate the activity and the

characterization of catalyst in detail when the oxychlorination option was used to
catalyst regeneration for PDH reaction.
In this study, oxychlorination was proposed to increase the mobility of Pt on
PDH catalyst. Proposed oxychlorination was performed by HCl addition diluted in
puriﬁed air at 500 C. After oxychlorination reaction, hydrogen reduction process
was followed. Reduction temperature and reduction time were selectively
conducted for economic purpose. Evidences of redispersion were veriﬁed by CO
chemisorption, XRD, XPS, CHSN analysis, and STEM.
Experimental
Preparation of catalyst
Pt–Sn/h-Al2O3 catalysts were prepared by two separate stages of impregnation
method. The h-alumina supports were prepared by temperature-programmed
calcination of gamma-alumina pellets (provided by Axens) under air atmosphere.
The temperatures were raised from 278 to 1273 K at a rate of 10 K/min and then
held at 1273 K for 8 h. At ﬁrst, a designated amount of Tin(II) chloride (SnCl2,
Sigma-Aldrich, [
98 %) was impregnated on the support, h-Al2O3. Drying and
calcination were performed at 120 C for 12 h and 873 K for 3 h, respectively.
Then, a counted amount of hydrogen hexachloroplatinate (IV) hydrate (H2PtCl6,
Kojima Chemical Co., Ltd., [
99 %) was consecutively deposited on Sn/h-Al2O3.
Another cycle of drying and calcination were carried out at 393 K for 12 h and
853 K for 3 h, respectively.
Catalytic activity measurements
Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) of catalysts was attempted. For hydrogen
reduction, the calcined catalysts were individually reduced in a pure hydrogen
(99.99 %) ﬂow (32 mL min-1). Reduction temperature was increased gradually
from room temperature to 893 K (10 C min-1). PDH reaction was performed in a
ﬁxed-bed quartz reactor at atmospheric pressure and 893 K for 5 h. After hydrogen
reduction, C3H8:H2 feed gases with a molar ratio of 1:1 were introduced into the
quartz reactor. Total gas ﬂow rate was maintained at 64 mL min-1. The products
and reactants were analyzed by an on-line GC (FID detector, Series M600D,
Younglin Co.) equipped with a capillary column (GS-Alumina, Agilent Technolo-
gies, USA, i.d.: 0.53 mm, length: 50 m). Propane conversion, propylene selectivity
and propylene yield were monitored and calculated by the following formulae:

n(C2H4), and n(C3H6) is the moles of methane, ethane, ethene, and propene from
outlet, respectively.
After ﬁrst-run PDH, the used catalyst was regenerated and evaluated again to
determine if active catalyst was fully recovered. The regeneration process was
composed of three serial steps: coke burning, oxychlorination, and hydrogen
reduction. Table 1 summarizes the regeneration processes we examined. Coke
burning was performed at 893 K for 3 h. The pressure was controlled at 1 atm and
air ﬂow was set to 60 mL/min. Oxychlorination was followed by coking process.
Oxychlorination included the following steps; (a) heating in ﬂowing air up to 823 K
(b) feed of the chloriding mixture of hydrogen chloride (1 % HCl/99 % N2) with the
air stream during 2 h at the same temperature, (c) termination of the chloriding
mixture feed, and (d) purging by N2 ﬂow for 30 min. The concentration of HCl was
varied from 625 to 7000 ppm. The pressure was controlled to atmospheric pressure.
The total gas ﬂow was set to 360 mL/min and 2 g of catalyst were placed to the
reactor. Hydrogen reduction of used catalyst was performed by the same procedure
as mentioned above.
Catalyst characterization
The measurements of BET surface area and N2 adsorption–desorption were
performed at 17 K using an automated gas sorption system (Belsorp II mini, BEL
Japan, Inc.). The Barrett–Joyner–Halanda (BJH) method was used to obtain pore
size distribution. CHNS analysis (Fisons EA1108) was carried out to determine the
carbon contents accumulated on the catalyst surface during PDH reaction. In order

to evaluate metal dispersion, CO chemisorption was performed with a pulse
chemisorption mode (BELCAT, BEL Japan, Inc.). Prior to measurements, 0.05 g of
a catalyst sample was thermally treated under a He stream at 773 K for 50 min to
remove physically adsorbed water and other impurities. Catalyst sample was cooled
down to room temperature and heated to 823 K with a heating rate of 10 K/min
using pure H2 at a ﬂow rate of 50 mL/min. The sample was then reduced in a pure
H2 ﬂow at 823 K for 2 h. After reduction, the sample was purged with helium (He)
gas at the same temperature for 1 h. After cooling to 323 K, the 10 % CO/He (10 %
v/v of CO diluted in He) gas was introduced for CO chemisorption. CO loop gas
was used for each pulse, and the pulse injections were repeated until saturation. The
amount of CO was measured using a thermal conductivity detector. The metal
dispersion of each catalyst was then calculated from the amount of CO adsorbed,
taking the stoichiometry factor (SF) as one for CO/Ptatm:
Dispersion ð%Þ ¼ 100  VS  SF  MW
SW  Fn  22:414
where, Vs is the cumulative volume of adsorbed CO (cm3 at STP), MW is the
molecular weight of Pt metal (g mol-1), SW is the weight of the sample, and Fn is
the Pt fraction in relation to the total catalyst sample weight.
The X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the prepared Pt Sn/Al2O3 catalysts were
recorded by a diffractometer (M/S, Shimadzu Instruments, Japan) with Ni-ﬁltered
Cu Ka (k = 1.540,600 nm). The operating voltage was 40 kV, and the current was
40 mA, with a 2h scanning rate of 3 min-1. XPS analyses were performed using an
Ulvac-PHI spectrometer [PHI 5000 Versa Probe; Minimum X-ray beam size:
B10_m, energy resolution: B0.50 eV, sensitivity: C1,000,000 CPS, scanning
electron gun (AES/SEM) and UV light source] using a non-monochromatized Mg
K_radiation (1253.6 eV). The vacuum in the analysis chamber was controlled to
less than 1 9 10-7 Pa. The peaks of Pt and Sn were deconvoluted using a sum of
Lorentzian–Gaussian functions. The high resolution TEM images of Pt and Sn
nanoparticles were characterized by FEI (Technai F20 G2, The Netherland)
microscopy working in a STEM mode (Accelerating voltage: 50–200 kV, Image
resolution:\
0.23 nm, Electro probe size:\
0.3 nm, Magniﬁcation: 25–1,030,0009,
Specimen double tilting: ±40/±20). The catalyst sample was prepared by
dispersion and suspension in ethanol solution and ultrasonic treatment for 30 min.
Consequently, the treated solution was deposited on copper grid coated with a
carbon ﬁlm, and evaporated. Finally, the sample containing copper grid was used
for TEM and HRTEM/HAADF STEM analysis.

identiﬁcation of catalysts, refer to Table 1. Propane conversions of catalysts were
determined for 300 min and are presented in Fig. 1. The conversion of propane was
evaluated in the presence of fresh catalyst (1Pt0.5Sn-C) at ﬁrst and used as a
reference value. The coke-burned catalyst (1Pt0.5Sn-B) led to much lower
conversion values than 1Pt0.5Sn-C. This is not surprising because coke-burning
can remove cokes; however, this may lead to unfavorable metal sintering. It was
observed that sintered metal particulates were not redispersed effectively even
though hydrogen reduction was employed, which will be discussed later.
Oxychlorinarion was evaluated by increasing the amount of HCl. The concentration
of HCl was varied from 625 to 7000 ppm. In case of 1Pt0.5Sn-OC625, propane
conversion was not improved but lowered than 1Pt0.5Sn-B. The recovery of
propane conversion was gradually improved when oxychlorination increases the
amount of HCl from 2000 to 7000 ppm in this work. Return to Fig. 1, the initial
conversion values of 1Pt0.5Sn-C, 1Pt0.5Sn-B, 1Pt0.5Sn-OC625, 1Pt0.5Sn-OC2000,
1Pt0.5Sn-OC3300, 1Pt0.5Sn-OC5000, and 1Pt0.5Sn-OC7000 were 42.2, 35.9, 37.4,
40.9, 40.5, 41.7, and 41.0 %, respectively. And after 300 min of PDH reaction, the
conversions were decreased to 33.9, 26.8, 24.8, 31.6, 32.3, 34.2, and 34.0 %,
respectively. The highest conversion was obtained in the presence of 1Pt0.5Sn-
OC5000, which is as high as the conversion obtained by fresh catalyst (1Pt0.5Sn-C).
In case of 1Pt0.5Sn-OC7000, the conversion values were more or less similar to
1Pt0.5Sn-OC5000. In Fig. 2, selectivity data were presented. Highest selectivity
was observed when 1Pt0.5Sn-C was used. Competitive data to 1Pt0.5Sn-C were
obtained when 1Pt0.5Sn-OC5000 and 1Pt0.5Sn-OC7000 options were attempted.
As similar to conversion results, less HCl concentration up to 3300 ppm did not
show the full restoration of catalytic performance when compared to 1Pt0.5Sn-C.

of monometallic and bimetallic catalysts are also represented in Table 2
(DX = 100 9 (Xi - Xf)/Xi, where Xi is the initial and Xf is the ﬁnal conversion,
respectively). The stability will be improved when DX values becomes lower. The
trend of deactivation was same as shown in propane conversion in Fig. 1. It should
be noted that the activity becomes stable as the concentration of HCl was increased.

Characteristic trend of lower values in 1Pt0.5Sn-B and 1Pt0.5Sn-OC625 was also
shown in selectivity and yield as well. Lower concentration of HCl during
oxychlorination leads even worse than the regeneration option without oxychlori-
nation. Gradual improvement of selectivity and yield were obtained in same manner
when oxychlorination option increased the concentration of HCl from 2000 to
7000 ppm.
Characterization of catalysts
BET surface area and coke amount
Table 3 shows the pore characteristics of catalysts and the coke content formed
during PDH reaction. Pore characteristics includes BET surface areas, pore volume,
and average pore diameter. BET surface area, pore volume, and average pore
diameter of 1Pt0.5Sn-C catalyst were 77.575 m2 g-1, 0.3153 cm3 g-1, and
7.592 nm,
respectively.
The
surface
area
of
1Pt0.5Sn-B
catalyst
was
89.363 m2 g-1, which is greater than that of 1Pt0.5Sn-C catalyst. In case of
oxychlorination option was included in regeneration, surface areas were increased
when compared with 1Pt0.5Sn-C. The pore volumes were more or less similar even
oxychlorination option was included (0.3153–0.3405 cm3 g-1). In the case of pore
diameters, there is no signiﬁcant change between with and without oxychlorination.
It is interesting that the 1Pt0.5Sn-OC5000 catalyst has a similar pore diameter to 1Pt
0.5Sn-C (7.614 vs. 7.592 nm). The regeneration of catalyst may restore the pore
structures as well even a clue is not conﬁrmed.

The ﬁrst run of PDH reaction, the coke was formed to 7.14 wt%. Coke burning
decreased the coke amount down to 0.08 wt%. To see the effect of oxychlorination,
coke contents were measured individually after PDH reaction. The coke content of
1Pt0.5Sn-OC2000, 1Pt0.5Sn-OC3300, 1Pt0.5Sn-OC5000, and 1Pt0.5Sn-OC7000
was 6.54, 6.00, 5.91, and 4.98 wt%, respectively. Coke amount generated during
PDH reaction was also decreased as oxychlorination option increased the
concentration of HCl.
CO chemisorption
Table 4 shows the CO chemisorption data. Metal dispersion, metal surface area, and
average particle size of Pt particles were presented. As a reference catalyst,
1Pt0.5Sn-C showed 12.6 % of metal dispersion, and 0.311 m2 g-1 cat-1 of metal
surface area, and 9.0 nm of average particle size. After PDH reaction, 1Pt0.5Sn-C
(used) had very low values in dispersion (0.63 %) and metal surface area
(0.016 m2 g-1 cat-1), but very high value in average particle size (178.8 nm). This
provides the clue that cokes may cover metal sites and block the pores, which
eventually prevents CO from being adsorbed on Pt active sites. Coke burning helped
the restoration of metal dispersion (2.14 %) and metal surface area (0.053 m2 g-1 -
cat-1), but these were only marginal. Unfavorable sintering of particle size was
occurred by coke burning. The effect of oxychlorination are also presented in
Table 4. Overall restoration of metal dispersion, surface area and particle size were
achieved when oxychlorination was employed in regeneration process. It is
noticeable that 1Pt0.5Sn-OC5000 had 13.23 % metal dispersion, 0.053 m2 g-1 -
cat-1 metal surface area, and also 8.6 nm average particle size. These values were
even superior to 1Pt0.5Sn-C (fresh catalyst). In the case of 1Pt0.5Sn-OC7000, the
effect of oxychlorination was not as high as 1Pt0.5Sn-C. Veldurthi et al. [7] reported
that the improvement of catalytic activity was mainly related to the metal
dispersion, metal surface area, and particle size of the catalysts. This supports why
1Pt0.5Sn-OC5000 showed the superior activity in PDH reaction to 1Pt0.5Sn-C (Ref.
Fig. 1).

X-ray diffraction (XRD)
Crystallographic changes of catalysts without oxychlorination are presented in
Fig. 3. XRD pattern of h-Al2O3 was used as a reference in Fig. 3a. The 2h values of
h-Al2O3 appeared at 31.5, 32. 8, 36.7, 38.9, 39.9, 44.9, 47.6, 50.7, 59.9, 62.3, 64.1,
and 67.4. XRD peaks of 1Pt0.5Sn-C, 1Pt0.5Sn-C/reduced, and 1Pt0.5Sn-C/used
looked almost identical to h-Al2O3 and did not reveal any traces of Pt/PtO or Sn
particles. We interpret that the sizes of Pt and Sn were too small to be detected by
XRD measurement. This also provides evidence of high dispersion of Pt and Sn
particles on the h-Al2O3 support. Similar interpretation was shown elsewhere [8, 9].
After coke burning of 1Pt0.5Sn-C/used catalyst, the existence of Pt particles was
detected by XRD patterns in both cases of 1Pt0.5Sn-B (Fig. 3e) and 1Pt0.5Sn-B/
reduced (Fig. 3f). This can be implied that coke burning induced the larger size of
Pt agglomerate by sintering.
In Fig. 4, XRD patterns were presented to show the effect of oxychlorination
options. Recall that oxychlorination was followed by coke burning. Concentration
of HCl during oxychlorination was varied from 2000 to 7000 ppm. The detection of
Pt particles was observed clearly when oxychlorination was performed (Fig. 4a, c,
e, g). The effect of Pt sintering still remained even when oxychlorination was
additionally employed right after prior coke burning. However, the crystallography
of catalysts was distinctively changed when hydrogen reduction was performed. The
Pt peaks in XRD patterns disappeared (Fig. 4b, d, f, h). It can be interpreted by the
redispersion of Pt agglomerates after hydrogen reduction was performed. This
redispersion occurred only after three stages of coke burning, oxychlorination, and

hydrogen reduction was applied. The result was conﬁrmed by CO chemisorption in
advance as shown in Table 4. In Fig. 4h, Pt3Sn phases were generated on
1Pt0.5SnOC7000 catalyst. The atomic composition of Pt3Sn alloy is often detected
on bimetallic Pt–Sn catalysts although all types of Pt–Sn alloys are possible [10–
14]. Even though there is no clue about how Pt3Sn alloy was formed during the
regeneration of PtSn/h-Al2O3, the mobility increases of both Pt and Sn may be
destined by oxychlorination [19–22]. It is suspect that the formation of Pt3Sn may
also induce the nanosize redispersion of sintered Pt agglomerates. In terms of
catalytic activity, there are arguments about the superiority between PtSn and Pt3Sn
[21, 22]. However, Pt3Sn showed the positive effect of catalytic activity during PDH
reaction in this study.
X-ray photo electron spectroscopy (XPS)
XPS was employed to examine the chemical shifts of Pt and Sn during the various
regeneration options. Although the most intense photoemission lines of platinum
were revealed from the Pt 4f levels, these energy regions were overshadowed by the
presence of a very strong Al 2p peak in this case. Pt 4d lines were analyzed instead.
In Fig. 5, there was an asymmetric broad of Pt 4d peak. It could be resolved after
curve ﬁtting procedures into two components with binding energies of 315.2 and
317.6 eV. The Pt 4d binding energy for Pt and PtO is usually reported in this region
[15], respectively. The components at higher binding energies can be attributed to
PtO species that created after calcination process, meanwhile the band at lower

binding energies can be assigned to the presence of Pt species. The chemical
changes in the platinum particles after reduction in H2 were also investigated by
XPS. Figure 5a, b present the XPS of 1Pt0.5Sn-C (fresh catalyst) after calcination
and additional reduction, respectively. In the cases of 1Pt0.5Sn-B and 1Pt0.5Sn-B/
reduced, there was no signiﬁcant traces of Pt4d peak (Fig. 5c, d). Later, the broad
bands were reappeared after oxychlorination was applied, in both cases for
1Pt0.5Sn-OC5000 and 1Pt0.5Sn-OC5000/reduced (Fig. 5e, f), which supports the
implication that the platinum was redispersed. The binding energy of Pt 4d shifts to
lower values as 1Pt0.5Sn-OC5000 catalyst was reduced.
In Fig. 6, XPS of Pt 4f shows the doublets corresponding to zero-valence of Pt.
The peak separation of Pt 4f7/2 (ca. 71.3 eV) and Pt 4f5/2 (ca. 74.6 eV) was 3.3 eV
and the area ratio of Pt 4f7/2 to Pt 4f5/2 was 1.33 as ﬁtting procedures were presented
in literature [16]. In Fig. 6b, the peak intensity of Pt 4f was increased after
reduction, which was comparable to the peak intensity of Al 2p (dashed line). In
Fig. 6f, the peak intensity of Pt 4f was also increased after reduction. Fig. 6c, d
show no distinctive changes.
In Fig. 7, the Sn 3d peaks indicated at the region of 485–487 eV. It is reported
that the peaks at 486.5 and 488.6 eV are designated to oxidized states of Sn (II, IV)
and SnClx species bound to the support, respectively [17, 18]. The intensity of
486.5 eV was increased after hydrogen reduction of 1Pt0.5Sn-OC5000. We suspect
that Sn attached to Pt may migrate to the surface of h-Al2O3, which results in the
increase of SnClx/Al peak. This should be examined in future work.

HAADF STEM and corresponding EDS mapping
Returning to Fig. 4f, the XRD pattern of 1Pt 0.5Sn-OC5000/reduced catalyst did not
show any metal or metal oxides peaks (Pt/PtOx or Sn/SnOx), but a sole h-Al2O3
phase appeared. To identify the structures of Pt particles, 1Pt0.5Sn-OC5000 was
characterized by FEI microscopy in STEM mode. Figure 8a, b shows typical high-
angle annular dark-ﬁeld scanning TEM (HAADF STEM) images and their
corresponding EDS maps of two catalysts; 1Pt0.5Sn-OC5000 and 1Pt0.5Sn-
OC5000/reduced. In Fig. 8a, the distribution of Pt particles in 1Pt0.5Sn-OC5000
shows the evidence of agglomeration caused by sintering. However, in Fig. 8b, the
Pt particles of 1Pt0.5Sn-OC5000/reduced were distributed in ﬁne scales, in other
words nanoscales. This result is consistent with CO chemisorption results (shown in
Table 4) and conﬁrms that oxychlorination option regenerated the nanoscale
dispersion of Pt again.
Conclusions
Bimetallic Pt–Sn catalysts were employed for propane dehydrogenation. It is well
known that coke is easily formed as a reaction proceeds. In order to restore catalytic
activity, coke burning is routinely used and followed by hydrogen reduction.
However, coke burning also induces to Pt sintering. In this study, oxychlorination
right after coke burning was included to aid the regeneration of bimetallic catalyst.
Diluted HCl concentration was examined at a range of 625–7000 ppm. In terms of
catalytic activity, oxychlorination clearly enhanced the catalytic activity to be as
high as a fresh catalyst. Catalytic activity was the greatest when oxychlorination

was performed at a HCl concentration of 5000 ppm. In other words, the full
restoration of catalytic activity was achieved by three combined regeneration
processes: coke burning, oxchlorination at 5000 ppm of HCl, followed by hydrogen
reduction. We interpret that catalyst regeneration is mainly attributed to the
successful redispersion of Pt. Evidence of effective redispersion was conﬁrmed by
CO adsorption, XRD, HAADF STEM, and EDS mapping. In addition, Pt3Sn was
formed during oxychlorination followed by hydrogen reduction. The formation of
Pt3Sn during the regeneration process resulted in positive restoration of catalytic
activity as well as the nanosize redispersion of sintered Pt agglomerates.
