Mechanism of Selective and Complete Oxidation in La2O3-
catalyzed Oxidative Coupling of Methane Reaction† 
Shibin Wang,a,b,c Shenggang Li*a,b and David A. Dixon*d 
Periodic density function theory (DFT) calculations were performed to study the evolution of surface oxygen species on the 
La2O3 catalyst during the oxidative coupling of methane (OCM) reaction, and to establish the catalytic mechanism of the 
selective and complete oxidation of CH4. The lattice oxygen (O2−) site on the stoichiometric La2O3 surface activates CH4 via 
heterolytic C−H bond cleavage to yield CH3− and H+ fragments, which bind to surface Lewis acid (La3+) and Brönsted base (O2−) 
sites, respectively. In the presence of the H+ fragment, the CH3− fragment binds quite strongly to the above La2O3 surface, 
but O2 adsorption facilitates its desorption as a gaseous CH3 radical at relatively low reaction temperatures, while molecular 
O2 adsorbed at the La3+ site becomes a superoxo radical (O2•−) species. This O2•− species reacts with a second CH4 molecule 
via direct H abstraction to produce another gaseous CH3 radical, accompanied by its transformation into a hydrogenperoxo 
(HO2−) species, which transfers an O atom to a neighboring O2− site and converts the latter into a peroxo (O22−) site. Whereas 
CH4 activation at the O2− site is essentially an acid-base reaction, that at the O22− site is clearly a redox reaction, which occurs 
via an O insertion mechanism to directly form gaseous CH3OH as further confirmed by our ab initio molecular dynamics 
(AIMD) calculations. CH3OH is further oxidized by additional O22− site to yield CO2 following a similar mechanism, whereas 
CO may form from dehydrogenatio of the CH2O intermediate at the same site. Thus, the O22− site is proposed to be 
responsible for complete oxidation of CH4 in the OCM reaction, whereas the O2− and O2•− sites are responsible for the 
formation of gaseous CH3 radicals and thus C2 products. Our proposed catalytic mechanism is based on first principles DFT 
calculations, which gives a comprehensive view of CH4 interaction with the different oxygen species on the La2O3 catalyst 
surface, and provides critical insights into the possible evolution of surface oxygen species and the detailed surface reaction 
network. 
Introduction 
Due to the increasing exploration and utilization of unconventional 
natural gas, the efficient conversion of CH4 into value−added chemicals 
such as C2H4 by the oxidative coupling of methane (OCM) reaction is of 
growing importance.1−3 It is generally accepted that C2 products (C2H6 and 
C2H4) result from direct coupling of CH3 radicals in the gas phase, which 
are formed by CH4 activation at oxygen sites on the catalyst surface.4−6 
Highly reactive catalysts are required to catalyze the OCM reaction due 
to the high C−H bond energy in CH4; however, an issue is that the 
resulting CH3 radicals or C2 products are more reactive and thus can be 
easily oxidized to generate CO and CO2 byproducts, as the over-oxidation 
reactions are thermodynamically and, possibly also kinetically, favorable. 
Thus, the challenge for continued catalyst development lies in balancing 
reactivity with selectivity.7 Over the past three decades, a large number 
of catalysts, such as doped alkali metal oxides (Li/MgO),8,9 doped rare 
earth metal oxides (Sr/La2O3),10 and mixed transition metal oxides 
(Mn−Na2WO4/SiO2)11−14 were extensively investigated for optimizing the 
C2 yield in the OCM reaction. Among the known OCM catalysts, La2O3 
catalysts exhibit good activity but relatively low C2 yields, and the 
relatively low operational temperature may give the La2O3 catalyst a 
great advantage.15−18 For examples, Jiang et al prepared La2O3 catalysts 
of different dimensionalities, yielding CH4 conversion and C2 selectivity 
up to 32% and 46%, respectively, with the reaction temperature of 823 
K.19 
To limit the extent of over-oxidation and to improve C2 selectivity, 
a lower amount of O2 is usually used in the reaction stream, resulting in 
limited CH4 conversion with usually complete O2 consumption.20 In 
addition, the most efficient OCM catalysts such as Li/MgO and Sr/La2O3 
are oxide materials with strong basicity and little oxidation capability, so 
oxidation may be mostly attributed to gaseous O2. Indeed, isotope-
labelled experiments under OCM conditions and corresponding 
computational studies reveal the occurrence of O2 dissociative 
adsorption over the La2O3 surface to generate active oxygen species.21,22 
We have previously investigated O2 chemisorption over low−index La2O3 
surfaces, and peroxo (O22−) sites were predicted to form upon O2 
dissociation.23 O2 dissociation over the stoichiometric La2O3 (001) surface 
was predicted to be modestly endothermic (64.6 kJ mol−1) with a sizable 
energy barrier (124.5 kJ mol−1) at 0 K. Nevertheless, the nature of the 
active oxygen species and its evolution, and the detailed catalytic 
mechanism of the OCM reaction remain elusive.

Numerous experiments have been carried out to elucidate the role 
of surface oxygen species in the OCM reaction.24 The activated forms of 
the surface oxygen species in the OCM reaction may include lattice 
oxygen (O2−), peroxo (O22−), superoxo radical (O2•−), and oxygen radical 
(O•−). For the Li/MgO catalyst, Discoll et al. proposed the O•− site near the 
Li+ dopant to be responsible for CH4 activation,25 although for La2O3 and 
other rare earth metal oxide-based OCM catalysts, there is a lack of direct 
experimental evidence for the presence of the O•− site. In situ Raman 
spectroscopy was employed by Lunsford et al. to demonstrate the 
presence of the O22− site on the Ba/MgO catalyst,26 and X−ray 
photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) studies on the same catalyst showed a 
correlation between the catalytic activity and near−surface O22− 
concentration.27 Furthermore, Wang et al. detected the O2•− species on 
the La2O3 catalyst surface using electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) 
spectroscopy.28 However, Louis et al. raised doubt about the stability of 
the O2•− species on the La2O3 surface under OCM conditions on the basis 
of the low oxygen partial pressure commonly used in the reaction.29 Xu 
et al detected surface superoxide (O2−) species over the La2B2O7 ( B= Ti4+, 
Zr4+, Ce4+) catalysts, and suggested the important role of this species in 
determining the OCM activity, where the La2Ce2O7 catalyst with the 
highest amount of O2− sites exhibited the highest reactivity.30 Thus, most 
of the above-mentioned surface oxygen sites are likely to be present on 
the La2O3 catalyst surface during the OCM reaction, and it is of great 
interest to reveal the role and the evolution of these surface oxygen 
species. 
First principles-based electronic structure calculations have also 
been performed to investigate CH4 activation at different surface oxygen 
sites. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations were performed by 
Palmer et al. to examine CH4 activation by surface O2−, O22−, and O•− 
species on the La2O3(001) surface.31 Direct hydrogen abstraction from 
CH4 by O2− on the stoichiometric La2O3 (001) slab surface was predicted 
to be very endothermic at 383.0 kJ mol−1, whereas that by O•− on the 
nonstoichiometric La2O3.33 (001) slab surface was calculated to be 
exothermic with a very low energy barrier of 42.5 kJ mol−1. The energy 
barrier for the reaction of CH4 with the O22− site was predicted to be quite 
high at 197.8 kJ mol−1. Wang et al. recently proposed two strategies to 
improve the reactivity of the La2O3 catalyst: constructing surfaces with 
low coordination number oxygen sites, e.g. the La2O3 (210) surface, and 
doping the La2O3 (001) surface with Sr or Ce. The energy barriers of CH4 
dissociation were calculated at the PBE level to be 86.8, 113.9, and 135.1 
kJ mol−1 for the La2O3 (210), Sr-doped La2O3 (001), and Ce-doped La2O3 
(001) surfaces, respectively.32 We have previously investigated the 
mechanism of CH4 activation at the O22− site using La2O3 cluster models.33 
In addition to the hydrogen abstraction mechanism found on very small 
clusters with well-exposed O22− sites, on larger clusters with less-exposed 
O22− sites, we predicted that the O22− site activates CH4 by directly 
inserting an O atom into the CH3−H bond. CH3OH is produced in this 
process, and the reaction is highly exothermic but with a considerable 
energy barrier. With the La4O7 (C2v) cluster model, the exothermicity and 
energy barrier were calculated to be −180.3 kJ mol−1 and 180.7 kJ mol−1, 
respectively. In addition, Chrétien and Metiu carried out DFT calculations 
to study CH4 dissociation at the O2− site on the stoichiometric La2O3 (001) 
surface, and the resulting CH3− and H+ fragments were predicted to 
preferentially adsorb at the La3+ and O2− sites, respectively; this was 
attributed to an acid−base interaction, although the energy barrier for 
this process was not reported.34 Using stoichiometric La2O3 cluster 
models, we previously investigated CH4 activation at the La3+−O2− pair site 
at the DFT and coupled cluster (CCSD(T)) levels of theory.35 The energy 
barriers (∆E0K) from the physisorption state were predicted to be modest 
at ~104.2 kJ mol−1. Furthermore, we were able to establish a linear 
relationship between the acid−base properties of the La3+−O2− pair site in 
terms of the CO2 chemisorption energy and its reactivity with CH4.36 
Regarding the role of gaseous O2 in the OCM reaction catalyzed by oxides 
with strong basicity such as MgO, Schwach et al. suggested that gaseous 
O2 might merely act as an electron acceptor to facilitate the formation of 
the CH3 radical, and proposed that the O2•− radical species generated in 
this process was adsorbed on the MgO surface near a proton.37 However, 
molecular level understanding of this process and of the detailed 
catalytic mechanism of the OCM reaction in general remains lacking. 
In this work, we used the symmetric and stoichiometric low−index 
La2O3(001) surface as a model for the La2O3 catalyst, and we performed 
periodic DFT calculations to study the catalytic mechanism of the OCM 
reaction. Gibbs free energy surfaces at the relevant reaction temperature 
of 823 K were predicted to fully elucidate the catalytic mechanisms under 
realistic reaction conditions, and the evolution of the surface oxygen 
species was also revealed. Our computational studies provide critical 
insights into the role of the surface oxygen species and the detailed 
catalytic reaction network for selective and complete CH4 oxidation. 
Results and discussion 
CH4 Selective Oxidation. 
The stoichiometric La2O3(001) slab model and the 
computational method used in this work are similar to our 
previous work,23 although we now consider a number of 
additional factors affecting the accuracy of our results, which 
are mostly discussed in the Computational section. The Gibbs 
free energy surface for CH4 activation at the O2− site on the 
La2O3(001) slab surface at the relevant reaction temperature of 
823 K is shown in Figure 1(a). Physisorption of CH4 on the 
La2O3(001) surface is very weak, so CH4 activation should occur 
without pre-adsorption and by direct collisions of the gaseous 
CH4 molecule with the La2O3 surface at any relevant reaction 
temperature. A significant free energy barrier (Ga) of 269.2 kJ 
mol−1 was predicted for CH4 dissociation, leading to the 
chemisorption structure with the CH3− fragment adsorbed at 
the bridge site between two adjacent La atoms (Lab) and with 
the H+ fragment adsorbed at the top site on the O atom (Ot). We 
note that the energy barrier at 0 K (Ea) is considerably lower at 
161.9 kJ mol −1, but the temperature-dependent pre-
exponential factor should be very low for such as a direct-
collision-induced gas-surface reaction. Thus, CH4 dissociation at 
the O2− site involves two neighboring La3+ sites, leading to 
heterolytic CH3−H bond splitting to yield the CH3− and H+ 
fragments, which bind to the Lewis acid (Lab) and Brönsted base 
(Ot) sites, respectively, consistent with previous studies.34-36 For 
this reason, the La3+ and O2− sites are labelled separately with 
La* and O* in all figures, and the CH3− and H+ species adsorbed 
at these sites are denoted as CH3−La* and H−O*, respectively. 
Bader charge analysis38−40 shows that the CH3− and H+ fragments 
carry negative and positive charges of −0.66 |e| and +0.61 |e| 
in the transition state, and −0.67 |e| and +0.59 |e| in the 
chemisorption state, respectively, confirming the heterolytic 
nature of the bond splitting. In addition, CH4 dissociation clearly 
involves a late transition state due to the high endothermicity 
of 259.3 kJ mol−1, and the average La−C and O−H distance in the 
transition state of 3.00 Å and 0.99 Å are very close to those in 
the chemisorption state of 2.86 Å and 0.97 Å. The proximity of

the transition state to the product chemisorption state makes it 
very difficult to locate this transition state.31,34 Vibrational 
frequencies of the transition state were also calculated, and 
only one imaginary frequency of 143i cm−1 was predicted, which 
has the correct displacements (Figure S1), confirming it as the 
right transition state. This low frequency is consistent with the 
lateness of the transition state. In addition, in the presence of 
the H+ adsorbate at the Ot site, the CH3− adsorbate binds quite 
strongly to the Lab site, as the free energy of desorption as a CH3 
radical from the Lab site was predicted to be 100.7 kJ mol−1. As 
the direct desorption process is just an endothermic process 
without any transition state, the effective free energy barrier 
(Ga,eff) for CH4 activation on the La2O3 (001) surface to directly 
form the CH3 radical, defined as the free energy relative to the 
separated reactants (the stoichiometric surface and the CH4 
molecule), is thus 360.0 kJ mol−1. At 0 K, the reaction energy for 
CH4 dissociation on the La2O3 (001) surface  to form the CH3 
radical was calculated to be 387.9 kJ mol−1, and this value is only 
slightly larger than the previously calculated reaction energy of 
383.0 kJ mol−1,31 and is ~51.1 kJ mol−1 less than the first C-H 
bond dissociation energy (BDE) in CH4 of 439.0 kJ mol−1.41

CH3 direct desorption. (b) O2−assisted CH3 desorption. The 
La3+−O2− pair site is considered as a combination of the La3+ site 
(La*) and the neighbouring O2− site (O*). 
 
The above charge analysis suggests that an ionic 
interaction between the CH3− adsorbate and the La site exists 
and contributes to the high desorption energy of the CH3 radical 
from the La site, with Edes of 232.6 kJ mol−1 at 0 K. This is 
confirmed by an electron localization function (ELF) analysis 
shown in Figure S2(a), which reveals that the electron density is 
highly localized around the C atom, and little electron density 
appears between the C–La bond, indicating that interaction 
between the CH3− adsorbate and the La site is dominated by an 
ionic interaction instead of covalent bonding. This is further 
validated by crystal orbital Hamilton population (COHP) analysis 
shown in Figure S2(b), which reveals that there is no obvious 
covalent interaction in the bonding area between the C atom 
and the relevant La site. As also shown in the projected density 
of states (PDOS) plot in Figure S3, with the CH3− adsorbate at 
the relevant La site, the frontier orbitals in the valence band and 
conduction band are dominated by the C 2p and La 5d orbitals, 
respectively. When the CH3 radical desorbs from the La site, the 
CH3− fragment must transfer an electron from its C 2p orbital to 
the La 5d orbital of the surface, and a high energy input is 
required for breaking the ionic interaction, which can be 
correlated with the estimated band gap of 278.8 kJ mol−1, and 
contributes to the high desorption energy of the CH3 radical 
from the La site. 
As mentioned above, CH4 physisorption on the La2O3 (001) 
surface is very weak, so it does not bind to the surface at any practical 
reaction temperature. Furthermore, the significant instability of the 
chemisorbed heterolytic pair relative to the separated reactants also 
makes it unlikely to be observed. As the direct release of the CH3 
radical while leaving an H atom on the catalyst surface requires a very 
high energy input, just slightly below the first BDE of CH4, this process 
is not really catalytic. Upon desorption of the CH3 radical from the 
surface, the extra electron from the CH3− adsorbate returns to the 
surface, although the resulting slab model remains neutral due to the 
H+ adsorbate. Spin-polarized calculation of the H−adsorbed surface 
shows that each of the four surface La atoms carries a magnetic 
moment of 0.04~0.05 μB (the spin magnetic moment of each 
unpaired electron is 1.0 μB, although the total magnetic moment of 
an atom also has contribution from its orbital magnetic moment). 
Bader charge analysis further shows that each of these surfaces La 
atoms carries a positive charge of +1.96 |e|. These values are to be 
compared with those of 0.0 μB and +2.02 |e|, respectively, for the 
stoichiometric surface, suggesting that the surface La sites on the H-
adsorbed surface are only slightly reduced upon electron transfer 
from the CH3− adsorbate. 
CH4 reactivity of the H-adsorbed surface was also investigated, 
and the potential energy surface is shown in Figure S6. The free 
energy of the reaction at 823 K remains very positive at 231.1 kJ mol−1 
with a high free energy barrier of 245.9 kJ mol−1, although most of 
this barrier is due to the endothermicity, so the H-adsorbed 
La2O3(001) surface has similar CH4 reactivity as the stoichiometric 
surface. Due to the fact that the formation of the H−adsorbed 
La2O3(001) surface requires significant energy input for CH4 
dissociation on the stoichiometric surface as shown in Figure 1(a), 
CH4 reaction with the H−adsorbed surface was not further 
considered.

In addition, we examined alternative routes for the further 
evolution of the CH4 chemisorption state on the stoichiometric 
La2O3(001) surface. First, as shown in Figure S7, the migration of the 
CH3 species adsorbed at the La* site to another nearby O* site to 
form CH3−O* was predicted to be highly endothermic by 264.4 kJ 
mol−1, consistent with the previous prediction that 
the 
chemisorption state in Figure 1(a) is the most stable adsorption 
structure.34 Second, we failed to locate a local minimum 
corresponding to the transfer of another H atom from the CH3 
species to a nearby O* site to form CH2−La*, as the H atom was 
transferred back upon relaxation. 
For the MgO-based OCM catalyst, molecular O2 was proposed 
to facilitate the formation of the CH3 radical, and the reaction energy 
for CH4 dissociation to form the CH3 radical was calculated to drop 
from 228.7 kJ mol−1 to 37.6 kJ mol−1 with the assistance of O2.42 Our 
calculations show that at relatively low temperatures, molecular O2 
can indeed promote the desorption of the CH3 species from the CH4 
chemisorption state via competitive adsorption at the Lab site, and 
as shown in Figure S12(b), a surface superoxo (O2•−) species forms at 
the Lab site upon the release of the CH3 radical into the gas phase, 
which is exothermic by −49.2 kJ mol−1 with a negligible energy barrier 
of 4.8 kJ mol−1 at 0 K, suggesting that O2-assisted CH3 desorption is 
favorable both thermodynamically and kinetically. Bader charge 
analysis shows that the O2•− species carries a negative charge of −0.76 
|e|, which is nearly half of that calculated for the lattice O2− of −1.33 
|e|, consistent with our formal charge assignment. However, the 
above reaction is again a gas-surface reaction without pre-
adsorption of the gaseous reactant at any relevant reaction 
temperature, and should occur by direct collisions of the O2 
molecules with the surface. Thus, although the energy barrier at 0 K 
(Ea) is negligible, the pre-exponential factor can be expected to be 
very small, and the free energy barrier (Ga) is substantial at 101.6 kJ 
mol−1 at 823 K as shown in Figure 1 (b), despite the fact that the 
reaction remains exothermic by −65.7 kJ mol−1. This free energy 
barrier is actually comparable with the free energy of direct 
desorption of the CH3 radical (100.7 kJ mol−1) shown in Figure 1 (a), 
suggesting that direct CH3 desorption becomes competitive with the 
O2-assisted route at 823 K, and further increasing (reducing) the 
reaction temperature will favor the direct (O2-assisted) pathway. 
Furthermore, the O2-assisted route obviously requires the presence 
of gaseous O2, so the direct desorption pathway may dominate when 
gaseous O2 is largely consumed even below 823 K.  At 823 K, the 
effective free energy barrier for O2-assisted CH4 dissociation to form 
the CH3 radical on the stoichiometric La2O3 (001) surface is 360.9 kJ 
mol−1, comparable to that of the direct desorption route of 360.0 kJ 
mol−1, consistent with the above conclusions on the temperature 
effect. We also note that our O2-assisted CH4 dissociation route is 
similar to some extent to that proposed by Cooper et al43 for CH4 
activation over the yttrium-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) surface in the 
presence of O2, where homolytic cleavage of the CH3−H bond was 
suggested to occur with the electron from the H atom transferred to 
the O2 molecule to also yield the O2•− species. 
As discussed above, due to the significant instability of the 
CH4 chemisorption state with respect to the separated 
reactants on the stoichiometric La2O3(001) surface, the 
coverage of the chemisorbed heterolytic pair can be expected 
to be very low. Nevertheless, the exothermicity from O2 
adsorption before or after CH3 radical desorption can still play 
an important role in driving the reaction forward. For other 
La2O3 surfaces on which CH4 chemisorption is exothermic, the 
coverage of the chemisorbed heterolytic pair can become 
appreciable especially at relatively low temperature. 
Evolution of Surface Oxygen Species. 
As shown in Figure 1(b), CH4 dissociation at the Lab−Ot pair 
site followed by O2-assisted CH3 desorption or direct CH3 
desorption followed by O2 adsorption leads to formation of the 
O2•− species at the Lab site along with the co-adsorbed H+ 
species at the neighboring Ot site. The above pair site must be 
regenerated for the completion of the OCM catalytic cycle, and 
thus we further investigated the reactions of the O2•− species 
with CH4. 
The free energy diagram for the CH4 reaction with the O2•− 
species is shown in Figure 2(a), which can be considered as a 
continuation from that in Figure 1(b). CH4 first reacts with the 
O2•− species to yield the second CH3 radical, which incurs a 
significant free energy barrier of 237.3 kJ mol−1 at 823 K, and the 
free energy of the reaction is 130.7 kJ mol−1. This is again a gas-
surface reaction without pre-adsorption of the gaseous 
reactant. Different from the CH4 activation mechanism at the 
Lab−Ot pair site, the O2•− species directly abstracts an H atom 
from CH4, leading to homolytic splitting of the C−H bond and the 
prompt release of the second CH3 radical. Bader charge analysis 
shows that the total negative charges carried by the two O 
atoms are −0.76 |e|, −1.25 |e|, and −1.36 |e| in the initial state, 
the transition state, and the final state, respectively. Magnetic 
moments of these two oxygen atoms were calculated to be 0.40 
and 0.38 μB in the initial state, and zero in the final state. These 
are consistent with the conversion of the O2•− species to the 
hydrogenperoxo (HO2−) species upon CH4 activation. Comparing 
the effective energy barrier for CH3 radical formation at the O2− 
site (360.0 or 360.9 kJ mol−1) shown in Figure 1 and that 
involving the O2− species (237.3 kJ mol−1) shown in Figure 2(a), 
we conclude that the O2•− site on the La2O3(001) surface is more 
reactive than the O2− site with CH4.  
The HO2− species can be considered as a precursor of 
hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), which is thermodynamically 
unstable at OCM conditions, so we consider its further 
evolution via another reaction channel. As also shown in Figure 
2(a), the HO2− species adsorbed at the Lab site readily reacts 
with a neighboring lattice O2− site to yield a hydroxide (OH−) 
species adsorbed at the La3+ top site (Lat), which is accompanied 
by the conversion of the lattice O2− site to a peroxo (O22−) site. 
The latter is written as O−O* to signify its connection with the 
lattice O2− site, although the exposed O atom also interacts with 
two neighboring La3+ sites. This process is exothermic by −68.2 
kJ mol−1 with a very low energy barrier of 26.6 kJ mol−1. Bader 
charge analysis shows that the O22− site carries the total 
negative charge of −1.38 |e|, which is very close to that at the 
lattice O2− site of −1.33 |e|. Furthermore, similar to the case of 
the HO2− species adsorbed at the Lab site, the two oxygen atoms 
at the O22− site were predicted to have zero magnetic moments. 
These are consistent with our assignment.

The O22− site can further react with CH4, and we have 
previously found that CH4 can be activated by direct insertion of 
an exposed O atom from the O22− site on the La2nO3n+1 clusters 
into the CH3−H bond to produce CH3OH.33 A similar reaction 
mechanism is proposed for the O22− site on the La2O3 (001) 
surface, and the free energy surface for CH4 activation at the

O22− site on the La2O3(001) surface is shown in Figure 2(b). CH4 
is oxidized by the O22− site to form CH3OH, which is very 
exothermic at −125.4 kJ mol−1, although it has a relatively free 
energy barrier (236.8 kJ mol−1) at 823 K. We note that this is 
once again a gas-surface reaction without pre-adsorption of the 
gaseous reactant at any relevant reaction temperature. The 
O−C and O−H distances in the transition state are 2.21 and 1.10 
Å, respectively. Vibrational frequencies of this transition state 
were calculated, and only one imaginary frequency of 745i cm−1 
was found. As shown by the vector displacement of the 
imaginary frequency (Figure S1), the exposed O atom from the 
O22− site moves towards the C atom, while the H atom from CH4 
moves toward the O atom, consistent with the formation of 
CH3OH.  
To further verify the formation of CH3OH at the O22− site, 
we performed ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations 
starting from the transition state structure, and to simplify the 
AIMD simulations, we removed both the H adsorbate at the Ot 
site and the OH adsorbate at the Lat site, which would further 
combine and desorb as an H2O molecule as discussed below. 
The potential energy surface is shown in Figure S4, and the 
transition state has a comparable imaginary frequency of 731i 
cm−1. Our AIMD simulations show that at ~37 fs, the H atom was 
transferred to the O atom of the O22− species, and the resulting 
OH fragment then binds to the CH3 group to form CH3OH. 
During the time period of our simulations (40~800 fs), the 
CH3OH molecule would further desorb from the surface, thus 
confirming the direct formation of CH3OH from CH4 reaction 
with the O22− species. 
After CH3OH desorption, hydrogen transfer from the H+ 
species adsorbed at the Ot site to the OH− species adsorbed at 
the Lat site readily occurs to form H2O with a very low free 
energy barrier of 30.0 kJ mol−1. Upon H2O desorption, the 
stoichiometric La2O3(001) surface is regenerated. With the 
above catalytic cycle, the total reaction is 3CH4 (g) + O2 (g) → 
2CH3 (g) + CH3OH (g) + H2O (g), which is endothermic by 60.3 kJ 
mol−1 at 823 K. If the CH3 radicals further combine to form C2H6, 
the total reaction becomes 3CH4 (g) + O2 (g) → C2H6 (g) + CH3OH 
(g) + H2O (g), which is now exothermic by −141.2 kJ mol−1 at 823 
K. The formation of C2H6 from two CH3 radicals was calculated 
to be exothermic at −201.5 kJ mol−1 at 823 K. In addition, if 
further reaction of the resulting C2H6 always results in the 
formation of C2H4, whereas CH3OH is completely oxidized by 
molecular O2, the selectivity of C2 products can be expected to 
be ~67%. However, the above must be considered as an ideal 
scenario, as many additional elementary reactions are likely to 
occur, some of which will be further discussed in the following 
section. Nevertheless, the direct oxidation of CH4 by surface 
O22− site suggests that this site should be responsible for CH4 
over-oxidation, which differs significantly from its role proposed 
by previous studies.31 
 
CH3OH Oxidation and CO2 Formation. 
As CH3OH was not observed as one of the main products 
in the OCM reaction, we propose it to be an intermediate during 
CH4 over-oxidation to COx (x = 1, 2). Further calculations show 
that CH3OH can easily dissociate at the Lat−Ot pair site on the 
stoichiometric La2O3(001) surface to form the methoxy (CH3O−) 
and H+ species adsorbed at the Lat and Ot sites with a relatively 
low free energy barrier of 68.0 kJ mol−1 at 823 K, as shown in 
Figure S8. The CH3O− species may be further oxidized to form 
COx. Karakaya et al. previously proposed a sequence of 
elementary steps for the OCM reaction over a La2O3/CeO2 
nanofabric catalyst,44 where the CH3O species was converted 
into CO by three dehydrogenation steps at the surface oxygen 
site via the formation of CH2O and HCO intermediates. Energy 
barriers for CH2O and HCO dehydrogenation were estimated to 
be only 55.0 and 6.8 kJ mol−1, respectively, based on the 
Evans−Polanyi relationship45 between reaction enthalpies and 
energy barriers, whereas CH3O dehydrogenation was suggested 
to be barrierless due to its strong exothermicity. However, 
additional first principles calculations are necessary to verify the

possibility of the above pathway by calculating the energy 
barriers. 
Contrary to the above proposed pathway for CH3OH 
oxidation to CO, our calculations show that although CH3OH can 
easily dissociate at the Lat−Ot pair site on the stoichiometric 
La2O3(001) surface to form the CH3O− species at the Lat site 
(Figure S8), the CH3O− species cannot be further oxidized by the 
lattice O2− site to form COx, as we failed to locate a local 
minimum with an H atom from the CH3O− species transferred to 
the neighboring O2− site. This is consistent with the fact that the 
stoichiometric La2O3(001) surface lacks oxidative capability, and 
its reaction with CH4 or CH3OH is best understood as an acid-
base reaction.34-36 Furthermore, direct desorption of the CH3O 
radical from the La2O3(001) surface from the CH3OH 
chemisorption state is also unlikely to occur due to its very high 
endothermicity of 299.1 kJ mol−1 at 823 K. Thus, we propose 
that further oxidation of CH3OH must occur by its reaction with 
the O22− site, which may result from the above mechanism 
shown in Figure 2(a) or from direct O2 dissociation.23 We note 
that the coverage of surface O22− sites resulting from this 
process may be limited due to the high endothermicity (202.2 
kJ mol−1) as well as the high free energy barrier (270.6 kJ mol−1) 
for direct O2 dissociation on the La2O3(001) surface at 823 K, 
which is also a gas-surface reaction without pre-adsorption of 
the gaseous reactant. We note that the free energy barrier of 
O2 dissociation is comparable to that of CH4 activation on the 
clean La2O3 (001) surface, which suggests that the O2 
dissociation reaction is competitive with the CH4 activation 
reaction. However, the O2 partial pressure is generally much 
lower than that of CH4 under realistic reaction conditions with 
typical inlet CH4/O2 volume ratios of 3~11,19,44 which should 
result in a lower reaction rate for O2 dissociation than that for 
CH4 activation on the La2O3 (001) surface, according to the 
collision theory.46 In fact, the local CH4/O2 volume ratio near the 
catalyst surface may be significantly higher, as much of the O2 is 
already consumed in the early stages of the OCM reactor.44  
Thus, we consider the OCM reaction to be initiated by CH4 
activation rather than O2 dissociation at the La−O pair site. 
Additionally, the process of O2 activation involves a spin 
crossover as molecular O2 has a triplet ground state, whereas 
surface O22− species have a singlet ground state, so the reaction 
rate may be further limited.47 However, it is difficult to predict 
to what extent the spin-crossover will affect the reaction rate of 
this process.. Nevertheless, we investigated the complete 
oxidation of CH3OH by the O22− site on the La2O3 (001) surface. 
As shown in Figure 3, CH3OH is oxidized by the surface O22− 
site to form CO2 in three separate steps. In the first step, 
oxidation of CH3OH by the O22− species to form CH2(OH)2 was 
predicted to be very exothermic at −175.7 kJ mol−1 with an 
modest free energy barrier of 124.7 kJ mol−1 at 823 K. Our 
calculations further show that CH3OH adsorbs at the O22− site on 
the La2O3(001) surface with a sizable physisorption energy of 
−88.7 kJ mol−1 at 0 K, where the O atom from CH3OH interacts 
with the La3+ site in a Lewis acid-base interaction at a La−O 
distance of 2.68 Å. Notably, CH3OH physisorption at the La3+ site 
leads to significant change in the structure of the O22− site in 
that the two O atoms from the O22− site move toward the 
subsurface. The distance between the bottom O atom from the 
O22− site and the nearest La atom from the subsurface is 
reduced from 3.77 Å to 2.61 Å. Thus, CH3OH oxidation by the 
O22− site may differ significantly in nature from the other gas-
surface reactions studied in this work at relatively low reaction 
temperature. Only one imaginary frequency (268i cm−1) was 
predicted for the transition state, which also has the 
appropriate displacements. In addition, the alternative 
dehydrogenation reaction of CH3OH at the O22− site was also 
investigated. As shown in Figure S9, the hydrogen atom from 
the OH group can be transferred to the neighboring O22− site, 
with the CH3O* species adsorbed at the bridge site between 
two La atoms. The free energy of this reaction is endothermic 
at 82.9 kJ mol−1 at 823 K, in contrast to the exothermic CH3OH 
oxidation reaction to form CH2(OH)2, which indicates that the 
oxygen insertion mechanism for CH3OH reaction at the O22− site 
is favored over its dehydrogenation mechanism. Upon the 
desorption of CH2(OH)2, its direct dehydration in the gas phase 
can occur to form CH2O, which was calculated to have a 
significant free energy barrier of 181.9 kJ mol−1 at 823 K, 
although with the assistance of an H2O molecule, the free 
energy barrier was predicted to be much lower at 113.2 kJ mol−1. 
Alternatively, we expect surface OH species to also accelerate 
the dehydration reaction of CH2(OH)2. 
In the second step, CH2O is oxidized by the O22− site to 
form HCOOH, which is highly exothermic by −133.9 kJ mol−1 
with an energy barrier of 158.2 kJ mol−1 at 823 K. The transition 
state was predicted to have only one imaginary frequency of 
519i cm−1. As shown in Figure S10, we also considered the 
dissociation of CH2O at the O22− site via the alternative hydrogen 
transfer mechanism, which leads to the formation of the CHO* 
and OH* adsorbates and the recovery of the lattice oxygen O2− 
site. The resulting CHO* species is adsorbed on the La2O3 
surface with the C and O atoms bonded with the O2−  and La3+ 
sites, respectively. The free energy of this reaction was 
calculated to be highly exothermic by −212.9 kJ mol−1 at 823 K, 
and we were unable to locate its transition state, most likely due 
to the high exothermicity, consistent with an early transition 
state and a small (if any) energy barrier. After CHO* formation, 
the remaining H atom can be further transferred to the 
neighboring OH* adsorbate, leading to the formation of 
gaseous H2O and CO. The free energy of this reaction step was 
calculated to be slightly endothermic at 13.0 kJ mol−1 at 823 K. 
Thus, CH2O dehydrogenation at the O22− site should result in the 
formation of CO in the OCM reaction, although further 
calculations are necessary to locate the relevant transition 
states, if present.  
In the third step, HCOOH is oxidized by the O22− site to 
form carbonic acid (H2CO3), which is exothermic by −271.1 kJ 
mol−1 with a free energy barrier of 165.3 kJ mol−1 at 823 K. The 
transition state has only one imaginary frequency of 374i cm−1. 
Direct dehydration of H2CO3 in the gas phase to form CO2 was 
calculated to have a free energy barrier of 166.8 kJ mol−1 at 823 
K, although with the assistance of an H2O molecule, the free 
energy barrier was predicted to be much lower at 104.2 kJ mol−1. 
At 0 K, the direct gas phase dehydration of H2CO3 was predicted 
to be exothermic by −36.4 kJ mol−1 with an energy barrier of

171.5 kJ mol−1 at the CCSD(T)/complete basis set (CBS) theory 
level, whereas the effective energy barrier of the dehydration 
mediated by an additional H2O molecule was calculated to be 
74.1 kJ mol−1,48 and our present B3LYP results of −4.5, 184.9, 
and 97.9 kJ mol−1, respectively, are in line with the previously 
calculated more accurate CCSD(T) results. Again, we expect 
surface OH species to also accelerate the dehydration of H2CO3.

oxidation and HCOOH formation. (c) HCOOH oxidation and CO2 
formation. Dehydration of CH2(OH)2 and H2CO3 can occur 
directly (red) or with the H2O assistance (black). 
 
In addition, we also investigated the alternative reaction 
pathway for the direct dehydration of HCOOH to form CO and 
H2O. As shown in Figure S11, the free energy barrier and 
reaction energy for HCOOH direct dehydrogenation was 
calculated to be 286.0 kJ/mol and 19.4 kJ mol−1, respectively, 
and with the assistance of an additional H2O molecule, the free 
energy barrier was reduced be 230.7 kJ mol−1. Thus, compared 
to the reaction pathway shown in Figure 3c for HCOOH 
oxidation by surface O22− species to form H2CO3 and CO2, direct 
dehydrogenation of HCOOH to form CO has a much higher free 
energy barrier, suggesting that in the presence of molecular O2 
and surface O22− species, CO2 formation is favored over CO 
formation.  
Thus, our calculations show that the sequential oxidation 
of CH3OH by the O22− site involves modest energy barriers of no 
more than ~165 kJ mol−1. Based on our predicted pathway for 
the complete oxidation of CH4 on the La2O3(001) surface, the 
rate determining step (RDS) is the initial CH4 oxidation step at 
the O22− site with a significant free energy barrier of 236.8 kJ 
mol−1 at 823 K as shown in Figure 2(b). If the O22− site is formed 
via direct O2 dissociation on the La2O3(001) surface, then this 
step becomes the RDS with an even higher free energy barrier 
of 270.6 kJ mol−1 at 823 K. Thus, a relatively high reaction 
temperature is still required to reach an appreciable oxidation 
rate catalyzed by the La2O3(001) surface. 
 
CH4 Oxidation Reaction Network. 
Based on our calculated free energy surfaces, we 
constructed a first principles-based reaction network for the 
evolution of the surface oxygen species and the formation of 
CH3 radicals from CH4 over the La2O3(001) surface. A possible 
mechanism for CO2 formation was also proposed, although we 
note that the oxidation of CH3 radicals in the gas phase may  also 
occur at these relatively high temperatures.49−51 As shown in 
Figure 4, our proposed reaction network includes twelve 
elementary steps (ES), two of which are gas phase reactions 
(ES8 for CH2(OH)2 dehydration and ES11 for H2CO3 dehydration). 
Furthermore, the formation of C2H6 from the coupling of two 
CH3 radicals in the gas phase is a very exothermic reaction with 
no energy barrier, whereas the formation of C2H4 from C2H6 is a 
multistep process involving further surface reactions, as the 
direct loss of H2 from C2H6 in the gas phase was predicted to 
have a very high energy barrier of 487.2 kJ mol−1 at 0 K at the 
CCSD(T)/CBS level.52 The reaction energies as well as the energy 
barriers for these elementary steps are further listed in Table 1. 
With our proposed reaction mechanism, CH4 is first 
activated at the lattice oxygen site on the La2O3(001) surface, 
which is highly endothermic with a high energy barrier. Thus, 
the direct dissociation of CH4 on the La2O3(001) surface is a slow 
step, and molecular O2 facilitates CH4 conversion by driving the 
reaction towards CH3 radical desorption especially at relatively 
low reaction temperature. A surface superoxo species is then 
generated, which can directly convert CH4 into another CH3 
radical. Although molecular O2 can promote the formation of 
the CH3 radical and benefit CH4 conversion, the CH3 radical in the 
gas phase may be further oxidized by excess molecular O2 to

form by-products COx at relatively high temperature, resulting 
in the loss of C2 selectivity. Furthermore, the exothermicity from 
the oxidation of the CH3 radical in the gas phase can contribute 
to the increase of the surface temperature in the OCM reaction, 
which may further promote CH4 dissociation on the La2O3 
surface and CH3 radical desorption, leading to accelerated CH4 
oxidation in the presence of an abundant amount of O2 in the 
gas phase. At the relatively high reaction temperature of >823K, 
direct desorption of the CH3 radical after CH4 dissociation at the 
La3+-O2− pair site becomes favoured over the O2-assisted CH3 
desorption pathway, and this is followed by O2 adsorption and 
the similar evolution of the surface oxygen species in the 
presence of gaseous O2. However, when gaseous O2 is depleted, 
the OCM reaction may follow a distinct pathway possibly 
involving the formation of H2, which is likely akin to the non-
oxidative dehydrogenation of CH4. Thus, our proposed OCM 
reaction mechanism is likely more suitable at low to modest O2 
conversion rate.

Our proposed reaction mechanism agrees well with the 
experimental results of Karakaya et al.,44 who made 
model−based interpretation of spatially resolved concentration 
and temperature profiles measured in a laboratory-scale 
packed−bed reactor over a La2O3/CeO2 nanofabric catalyst. 
With a CH4/O2 ratio of 9 in the feed, the O2 concentration was 
found to decrease rapidly due to CH4 consumption when the gas 
mixture entered the catalyst bed. In addition, the C2H4 and C2H6 
profiles rise more slowly than those of CO2 and H2O, indicating 
that CH4 combustion occurs prior to the oxidative coupling and 
C2 product formation. The combustion of CH4 provides the heat 
required for the OCM reaction, as the latter occurs at much 
higher reaction temperatures (~1073 K). When CH4 passes 
through the La2O3 catalyst, oxygen is mostly consumed in the 
early stage of the reactor accompanied by a rapid increase of 
catalyst bed temperature; the temperature then falls off in the 
middle to latter stages of the reactor. For the over-oxidation of 
CH4, we propose a possible mechanism based on its initial 
oxidation to CH3OH at the O22− site, followed by subsequent 
oxidations to CH2O and HCOOH before CO2 formation. Although 
direct experimental evidence to support our proposed over-
oxidation mechanism is still lacking, we note that for the partial 
oxidation of CH4 on the YSZ catalyst, CH2O has been identified 
by experiments of Zhu et al. as the intermediate for CO 
formation, and traces of CH2O and HCOOH have been detected 
in the product streams along with CO and CO2.53 However, their 
further experiments suggest that the mechanism on the YSZ 
catalyst is quite different from our proposal for the La2O3 
catalyst, where oxygen vacancies are involved and the Mars–
van Krevelen mechanism is at work.54  
With our proposed reaction network, the O22− species is 
responsible for complete CH4 oxidation, in contrast to the 
previously proposed role of this species.31 Our proposal is based 
on the evidence from our calculations using both the slab and 
cluster models,33 and is consistent with the superior oxidative 
capability of the peroxide species. CO2 is generated in four C-H 
activation steps from CH4 by atomic oxygen insertion. Due to 
the high energy barrier for CH4 activation at the O22− site to form 
CH3OH as well as that for direct O2 dissociation at the O2− site to 
form the O22− site, we suggest that CO2 formation over the La2O3 
surface mainly occurs at the relatively high temperature region 
in the early stage of the OCM reactor.  
Based on our proposed reaction network, the formation 
of CH3 radicals in the La2O3-catalyzed OCM reaction is mainly 
attributed to CH4 activation at the O2− site followed by O2-
assisted (direct) CH3 desorption at relative low (high) reaction 
temperature of <823 K (> 823 K), and CH4 activation at the 
resulting O2•− site, each with a substantial energy barrier. The 
regeneration of the catalyst dictates the further activation of 
CH4 at the O22− site, leading to the formation of CH3OH as an 
intermediate on the path to complete CH4 combustion. If 
CH3OH is oxidized solely by surface O22− sites from direct O2 
dissociation, and all of the CH3 radicals produced are converted 
into C2 products, C2 selectivity will be ~67%. However, the actual 
reaction mechanism is likely to be more complex. On the one 
hand, CH3OH or other intermediates in CH4 combustion may 
consume the surface O22− sites, which helps to complete the 
catalytic cycle without producing more CH3OH and leads to 
higher C2 selectivity. On the other hand, CH3 radicals in the gas 
phase may further react with O2 at relatively high temperatures, 
resulting in CH4 combustion and the loss of C2 selectivity. The 
further oxidation of C2H6 and C2H4 would also result in lower C2 
selectivity. Thus, it is still a great challenge to reliably predict C2 
selectivity in the OCM reaction, and further studies are 
necessary to reach a more quantitative prediction model of the 
OCM reaction.

 Figure 4. Proposed reaction network for selective (blue) and complete (red) CH4 oxidation over the La2O3(001) surface. Gibbs free 
energy barriers (Ga, 823 K, kJ mol−1) for the elementary steps are also shown. 
 
We have recently shown experimentally that the catalytic 
mechanism of the OCM reaction may be significantly influenced 
by the reaction temperature.55 Although a detailed microkinetic 
model of the OCM reaction working at different temperatures 
is beyond the scope of the current work, we now qualitatively 
discuss temperature effects on the kinetics of the various 
elementary steps based on recent studies of model reactions 
such as methanol selective oxidation.56 Based on the Arrhenius 
equation, the rate constant of an elementary step with an 
energy barrier depends on the exponential of the ratio of the 
classical activation energy and the reaction temperature and 
the pre-exponential factor. The latter is strongly influenced by 
the nature of the elementary step, and can be estimated by 
empirical rules,56 although it can also be calculated from the 
thermodynamic formulation of the transition state theory with 
caution. 
Thus, depending on the adsorption strength of the various 
adsorbates involved in the elementary steps, the elementary 
steps shown in Table 1 can be divided into three categories. The 
first category includes ES1, ES2, ES3, ES5, and ES12, which 
involves the reaction of a weakly adsorbed molecular species, 
CH4 for ES1, ES3 and ES5, and O2 for ES2 and ES12. Despite the 
known underestimation of the physisorption energies by the 
PBE functional, it is obvious that the molecular species involved 
in the above elementary steps are very weakly adsorbed on the 
surface at 0 K, so at any relevant reaction temperature, these 
reactions should really be considered to occur by direct 
collisions of the gaseous reactants with the surface, which 
usually result in very low pre-exponential factors. Thus, these 
elementary steps are rather slow, especially those also involve 
high energy barrier at 0 K (Ea), i.e. ES1 (161.9 kJ mol−1), ES3 
(135.1 kJ mol−1), ES5 (149.8 kJ mol−1), and ES12 (121.3 kJ mol−1). 
This explains the need for elevated temperature in the OCM 
reaction. 
The second category includes ES7, ES9, and ES10, which 
are characterized by adsorbates of modest adsorption strength 
at 0 K, i.e. CH3OH, CH2O, and HCOOH. The two gas phase 
elementary steps (ES8 and ES11) may also be considered to fall 
into this group, as we expect that the dehydration of CH2(OH)2 
and H2CO3 can also be catalyzed by the surface OH species, and 
these molecules should physisorb at the surface OH species 
with modest adsorption strength. At relatively low reaction 
temperature, physisorption of the above-mentioned molecules 
will occur, which is followed by surface-only reactions with 
usually high pre-exponential factors. In fact, the energy barrier 
at 0 K (Ea) of the surface-only reactions involved in elementary 
steps ES7, ES9, and ES10 are also modest at 90.8 kJ mol−1, 94.6 
kJ mol−1, and 114.6 kJ mol−1. At relatively high reaction 
temperatures, these elementary steps must again be 
considered to occur by direct collisions of the gaseous reactants

with the surface, although they all involve much lower energy 
bariers than those in the first category. Thus, the overall rate 
constants of the elementary steps in this category can be 
expected to be much greater than those in the first category. 
The third category includes ES4 and ES6, which are purely 
surface reactions with strongly surface-bound species, so their 
pre-exponential factors should be much higher. In addition, the 
very low energy barrier at 0 K (Ea), 15.1 kJ mol−1 for ES4 and 22.2 
kJ mol−1 for ES6, also make these elementary steps the fastest. 
Therefore, the above discussion suggests that the RDS of 
the OCM reaction is likely one or more of the CH4 and O2 
activation steps involved in ES1, ES3, ES5 and ES12. For the 
La2O3(001) surface, ES1 for CH4 dissociation at the lattice oxygen 
site should be the slowest with its highest energy barrier at 0 K 
(Ea) of 161.9 kJ mol−1. Nevertheless, this may not be true for the 
other low-index La2O3 surfaces, as the OCM reaction appears to 
be structure-sensitive, and our preliminary calculations on the 
reactivity of the La2O3 (011) surface show that ES1 for this 
surface involves a much lower energy barrier at 0 K of 72.4 kJ 
mol−1,55 so the RDS for this surface can be expected to be 
different based on our present studies on the reaction network. 
Furthermore, more reliable identification of the preferable 
reaction pathway and the RDS in complex catalytic reactions 
requires detailed microkinetic simulations at realistic conditions 
using accurate energetics as demonstrated by recent large-scale 
computational simulations.57,58 Our ongoing studies aim at 
revealing the possible elementary steps on other low-index 
La2O3 surfaces, as well as building a reliable microkinetic model 
based on our first principles studies on the OCM reaction. 
Reliable experimental measurements of the activation 
energies and prefactors for the OCM reaction over the La2O3 
catalyst are lacking, in part due to the often observed great 
difference between the oven temperature and catalyst bed 
temperature.19 This has been largely resolved by the design of a 
novel reactor, and experimental apparent activation energies 
were obtained from the Arrhenius plots.53 The experimental 
apparent activation energy of 341.6 kJ mol−1 deduced from the 
Arrhenius plots for C2H6 formation is significantly higher than 
the calculated energy barriers at 0 K in our reaction network. 
However, we found the above experimental value to match 
quite well with the calculated effective energy barrier at 0 K for 
CH4 activation to directly form the CH3 radical especially over 
the more reactive La2O3 (011) surface (354.1 kJ mol−1), whereas 
this value was predicted to be 387.9 kJ mol−1 over the La2O3 (001) 
surface. Furthermore, our previous study identifies a “turn-over” 
zone in the temperature range of 853 K and 913 K, which is 
characterized by the rapid increase in the formation of C2 
products, the great decrease in the O2 concentration, and the 
reduction in COx (x = 1, 2) formations, suggesting a change in the 
reaction mechanism.55 This temperature range is close to the 
reaction temperature of 823 K investigated in this work, and our 
calculations show that above this temperature, direct CH3 
desorption is kinetically favoured over the O2-assisted pathway, 
which may explain the change of the reaction mechanism.  
Nevertheless, more reliable kinetic measurements together 
with accurate microkinetic simulations of the OCM reaction 
over the La2O3 catalyst are necessary to reach a more definitive 
conclusion. 
Computational 
Periodic DFT calculations were performed with the 
Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof 
(PBE) 
exchange-correlation 
functional59 and the projector-augmented wave (PAW) 
method.60,61 The recommended default potentials were 
employed for all atoms, and an energy cutoff of 520 eV was 
used throughout this work. Spin polarization was applied, 
although it was found to have no effect on most of the systems 
studied in this work. Bulk La2O3 and its surfaces studied in this 
work all have significant band gaps, and Gaussian smearing with 
a width of 0.05 eV was applied. The electronic energy of the 
supercell was converged to 10−5 eV in the self-consistent field 
calculations, whereas the force on each relaxed atom was 
converged to 0.02 eV/Å in the ionic relaxation calculations. 
A symmetric and stoichiometric slab model of the 
La2O3(001) surface was built from the optimized bulk structure, 
and the fractional coordinates are given in the Supporting 
Information. We have previously optimized the thickness of the 
La2O3 slab models by converging the O2 dissociation energies to 
form surface O22− sites to better than 0.01 eV.23 For the 
La2O3(001) surface, the number of repeating units based on O2 
dissociation energy convergence with the p(1×1) unit cell was 
calculated to be two. Thus, two repeating units for the (001) 
surface along the surface normal were included in the slab 
models with the bottom half fixed at their bulk positions. A 
vacuum layer of 15 Å was inserted between adjacent slabs, and 
reactions were allowed only on the relaxed side of the slab. A 
p(2×2) supercell for the (001) surface was used with a Γ-centred 
Monkhorst-Pack k-point mesh of (3×3×1). 
Dipole moment corrections along the surface normal 
should generally be applied for asymmetric slab models with 
adsorbates on only one side of the slab. For CH4 physisorption 
and chemisorption structures on the La2O3 (001) surface, the 
sum of dipole and quadrupole energy corrections were 
calculated to be 2×10−3 eV and 3×10−3 eV, respectively, so the 
dipole effect on the potential energy surface is insignificant and 
dipole corrections were not included in further calculations. 
Transition states were optimized with the climbing image 
nudged elastic band (CI-NEB) approach,62,63 although the dimer 
method was also employed in some cases. Harmonic 
frequencies of the adsorbates in the local minima and transition 
states were calculated with a much tighter energy convergence 
of 10−8 eV, and zero-point energy (ZPE) corrections were 
included in the calculated energy barriers and reaction energies. 
The periodic DFT calculations were performed with VASP,64,65 
and the CI-NEB and dimer calculations were performed using 
the VASP transition state tools (VTST) interfaced with VASP with 
a much tighter energy convergence of 10−8 eV. The Atomic 
Simulation Environment (ASE) program was used to drive some 
of these calculations,66 and the surface structures were built 
and visualized with Materials Visualizer from Materials Studio.67

Hamilton population (COHP)71,72 analyses were performed 
using VESTA73 and lobster softwares,74,75 respectively. 
For CH4 activation at the O22− site, we further performed 
ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations with VASP in 
the 
canonical 
ensemble 
employing 
Nosé-Hoover 
thermostats76,77 with a time step of 1 fs. Due to the limited time 
scale in the calculation, slow reaction processes may be 
precluded. Thus, a relatively high temperature of 1000 K was 
employed to explore the reactivity of the O22− site.  
The Gibbs free energy for each species in a given 
elementary step was calculated as G = Eelec + EZPE – T*S, where 
Eelec is the electronic energy at 0 K from the DFT calculation, and 
EZPE is the zero−point energy term. For gaseous molecules, the 
entropic term calculated by the PBE functional using the 
VASPKIT program78 is not sufficiently accurate as shown in Table 
S1, and we found that predictions from the B3LYP79 hybrid 
exchange-correlation functional and the 6-31G* basis set80-81 
using the Gaussian 09 program package82 are in much better 
agreement with the experimental values. For surface-adsorbed 
species, all 3N degrees of freedom of the adsorbate were 
treated as harmonic vibrations, and the entropy was calculated 
as a sum of the contributions from these vibrational motions. 
Although 
the 
above 
procedure 
may 
introduce 
some 
discrepancies for the calculations of entropies of gaseous and 
surface species, we note that the entropy of the gaseous species 
is significantly larger than that of the surface species due to the 
non-vibrational contributions, and thus can be expected to be 
more critical for the overall accuracy in the calculated 
energetics. 
Conclusions 
We systematically investigated CH4 activation by different 
surface oxygen species (O2−, O2•−, and O22−), and proposed a 
reaction network for the OCM reaction. The lattice oxygen site 
was found to activate CH4 by heterolytic C−H bond splitting to 
yield the CH3− and H+ fragments, which bind to the Lewis acid 
site (bridge Lab) and Brönsted base site (top Ot), respectively. 
Although the CH3− fragment binds quite strongly to the surface 
in the presence of the H+ fragment, molecular O2 can facilitate 
its desorption especially at relatively low reaction temperatures 
leading to the formation of an O2•− species. The O2•− species can 
further activate CH4 by direct hydrogen abstraction, producing 
the second CH3 radical. Comparing the free energy barriers of 
CH3 radical formation at the O2− and O2•− sites, we found the 
O2•− site to be kinetically favorable for selective conversion of 
CH4 into the CH3 radical. For CH4 activation at the O22− site, 
direct insertion of an O atom into the C−H bond leads to the 
formation of CH3OH. However, CH3OH is much less stable than 
CH4 under the OCM conditions, and can be further oxidized by 
the O22− site to form CO2 in three C−H activation steps, whereas 
dehydrogenation of the CH2O intermediate at this site can result 
in CO formation. Thus, our study suggests that surface O22− 
species are responsible for CH4 complete oxidation in the OCM 
reaction, where the first C−H bond activation is the 
rate−determining step. From our predicted pathway for CH4 
selective oxidation in the OCM reaction, C2 selectivity is 
predicted to be ~67% in the absence of competing reactions, 
although the selectivity could be significantly affected by side 
reactions. Our calculations provide important insights into the 
role of the surface oxygen species, as well as the reaction 
network for the selective and complete oxidation of CH4 in the 
OCM reaction.
