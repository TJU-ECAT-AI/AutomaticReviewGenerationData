While the search for catalysts capable of directly converting
methane to higher value commodity chemicals and liquid fuels
has been active for over a century, a viable industrial process
for selective methane activation has yet to be developed1.
Electronic structure calculations are playing an increasingly
relevant role in this search, but large-scale materials screening
eforts are hindered by computationally expensive transition
state barrier calculations. The purpose of the present letter is
twofold. First, we show that, for the wide range of catalysts
that proceed via a radical intermediate, a unifying framework
for predicting C‚ÄìH activation barriers using a single universal
descriptor can be established. Second, we combine this
scaling approach with a thermodynamic analysis of active site
formation to provide a map of methane activation rates. Our
modelsuccessfullyrationalizestheavailableempiricaldataand
lays the foundation for future catalyst design strategies that
transcend diferent catalyst classes.
Methane is relatively inert, and many diÔ¨Äerent classes of
catalysts have been investigated for its activation. In all catalyst
materials, one of two distinct transition state (TS) geometries is
observed2 (Supplementary Fig. 1). For some catalysts, such as
non-noble metals and certain oxides, unsaturated surface atoms
are available to stabilize the methyl group in the TS3‚Äì6. However,
if the CH3‚Äìsurface interaction is energetically unfavourable7 or
geometrically inaccessible8, a radical-like TS is observed2,9‚Äì13. Many
of the most promising catalysts for alkane activation fall into this
second category: cation-exchanged zeolites11,14‚Äì17, metal organic
frameworks (MOFs)18,19 and decorated graphene nanosheets20 for
the partial oxidation of alkanes, and certain oxides2,21 and zeolites22
for oxidative coupling of methane.
Hydrogen aÔ¨Énity (EH) has previously been shown to be a suitable
descriptor of reactivity for radical-like hydrocarbon activation23‚Äì25.
However, these analyses have traditionally been limited to trends
within groups of certain transition metal oxides. By examining 20
distinct active site motifs and catalysts, including those as diverse
as zeolites, oxides, metals and MOFs, we broaden the scope of
these studies and demonstrate that EH can be used universally to
describe all catalysts that follow the radical-like methane activation
mechanism (Fig. 1). Here, EH is defined as:
EH =E(MmOxHy+1)‚àíE(MmOxHy)
(1)
where E(MmOxHy+1) and E(MmOxHy) are the formation energies
of the reduced and bare active sites respectively, referenced to gas-
phase H2O and O2 (Supplementary Equation 1). Figure 1 includes

a vast range of interesting catalyst materials, and prototypical
examples of TS geometries for several of these materials are shown
in Fig. 2. For each case, we observe that methane activation proceeds
through a radical-like TS. This TS is characterized by a C‚ÄìH (O‚ÄìH)
bond length of ‚àº2.5 (1.2) √Ö, and its radical nature is confirmed
by examining the carbon projected density of states and spin
density diÔ¨Äerence (Supplementary Figs 2‚Äì4). We note that other
related descriptors have been previously used for similar purposes,
including oxide surface reducibility2, acidity/basicity26 and reaction

energy4,27. However, these studies have generally been limited to
describing trends within one subset of catalyst materials.
Similar to the above analysis, we determined the TS and universal
scaling lines for C‚ÄìH bond activation in ethane and methanol for
diÔ¨Äerent active sites and materials using the same descriptor, EH.
The universal scaling lines for these reactants lie below and parallel
to the methane activation line (Fig. 3a). Inspired by the recent work
on metal surfaces, we expect the shift in TS scaling for diÔ¨Äerent
reactants to be related to the reactant‚Äôs C‚ÄìH bond strength, EC‚ÄìH
(ref. 28). Figure 3b illustrates this relationship for Fe/(Mg) MOF-74
(refs 18,19) for C1‚ÄìC3 alkanes and methanol. Using this relationship,
we can describe C‚ÄìH bond activation across reactants and catalysts
by a more general equation (equation (2)) that depends only on
the hydrogen aÔ¨Énity of the catalyst and the C‚ÄìH bond energy of
the reactant.
ETS =0.75EH ‚àí1.26EC‚ÄìH ‚àí4.93
(2)
Figure 3c demonstrates the excellent agreement between our
model‚Äôs predictions and calculated density functional theory (DFT)
C‚ÄìH bond activation energies across a wide variety of reactants
and catalyst.
It is useful to examine the implications of accurately predicting
C‚ÄìH activation energies for many reactants and a large library of
chemically and structurally diverse catalyst materials (Fig. 2) using
a single descriptor. The errors for the scaling relationships shown
in Figs 1 and 3a (‚àº0.1 eV) are comparable to the typical accuracy
of DFT adsorption energies29,30. More importantly, these small
deviations indicate that computationally expensive calculations of
TS energies can be avoided, and this model can easily be used
to accelerate materials discovery for various C‚ÄìH bond activation
reactions. Our findings also support the well-established idea1 that
selective methane oxidation to methanol in a continuous catalytic
process is problematic due to the more facile activation of methanol
than methane for a given active site, suggesting that step-wise
processes analogous to those used in zeolite chemistry may be
required to achieve high selectivity.
With the insight that a single descriptor can be used to predict
C‚ÄìH activation energies on many diverse catalyst materials, we are
able to generate a simple model that describes the ability of a catalyst
to activate methane. Therefore, we shift our focus to free energies,
as these are more relevant for a reaction rate analysis. While we
acknowledge that the ability to activate methane is only one of the
necessary characteristics of an ideal alkane activation catalyst, we
choose not to focus on product selectivity as the complex nature
of selectivity would hinder a general analysis across catalyst classes.
The rate of methane activation can be written as:
rate=œëmotif
kBT
h exp
‚àí1Ga
kBT

(3)
where œëmotif is the fraction of available active sites of the catalytic
material and the remaining terms express the rate of molecular
methane activation. Note that equation (3) is a simple measure
of activity assuming only one type of active site that may not be
directly related to the overall performance of the catalyst. This is an
important distinction, as the overall activity of a catalyst will depend
on the material properties, synthesis method, and other possible

species that can be formed during activation. For instance, during
zeolite activation for partial oxidation of methane, diÔ¨Äerent oxygen-
containing species can be formed to varying degrees depending on
the Si/Al ratio, extent of cation exchange, Al distribution, cation
positions and zeolite topology. Although a detailed investigation
of these factors is beyond the scope of this work, we acknowledge
that the œëmotif represents an upper bound of the equilibrium active
site coverage for the specific materials we have considered. œëmotif
is a function of the free energy of active site formation, Gf. The
forms of these functions, which will change for diÔ¨Äerent active
site geometries and oxidizing agents, are given in Supplementary
Equations 2‚Äì7. If only MmOx active sites are considered with
molecular oxygen as the oxidant, Gf and œëmotif can be generally
defined as follows:

A plot of œëmotif as a function of Gf for oxygen activation of MmOx
active sites is given in Supplementary Fig. 5. For simplicity, only
materials with MmOx active sites activated via molecular oxygen
for the methane oxidation reaction are explored in the following
discussion. A similar analysis of M-OH active site materials and
other oxidants is presented in Supplementary Figs 6 and 7.
Given that the TS energy scales with the hydrogen aÔ¨Énity
(Fig. 1), Gf and GH provide a complete description of the ability of a
catalyst to activate methane. GH is defined analogously to EH as:
GH =G(MmOxHy+1)‚àíG(MmOxHy)
(6)
where G(MmOxHy+1) and G
 MmOxHy
 are the formation free
energies of the reduced and bare active sites referenced to the
gas-phase free energies of H2O and O2. Using these quantities as
independent descriptors, a two-dimensional rate volcano can be
constructed showing the rate of methane activation as a function
of Gf and GH (Fig. 4a). Here, we focus on low-temperature (150 ‚ó¶C)
methane activation, which is primarily relevant to partial methane
oxidation to methanol. Therefore, 1Ga in equation (3) is calculated
at 150 ‚ó¶C. We model the high temperatures used for catalyst
activation in zeolite chemistry by calculating œëmotif in equation (3)
at 450 ‚ó¶C. However, we note that the results are not significantly
diÔ¨Äerent if oxygen equilibration takes place at 150 ‚ó¶C or 600 ‚ó¶C, or
if N2O is used as an oxidant (Supplementary Fig. 7).
Interestingly, all the materials explored seem to fall on one
of two distinct Gf versus GH scaling lines (red and purple lines,
Fig. 4a). We posit the physical origin of these two lines may be
related to the ability of the substrate to delocalize changes in charge
following active site formation, as determined by a Bader charge
analysis before and after oxygen adsorption to form the active site
(Supplementary Figs 8‚Äì11). Along each Gf versus GH scaling line,
the dimensionality of the problem is reduced to a single independent
descriptor and a one-dimensional rate volcano can be generated
(Fig. 4b). Materials that fall on the lower Gf versus GH scaling line
(the high-activity class, red line) include various active site motifs
for zeolites and several oxygen-promoted rutile oxides. The results
clearly explain the prevailing interest in Cu-exchanged zeolites, as
Cu-exchanged catalysts tend to be closer to the peak of the volcano
than other cations for a given active site motif (Fig. 4b). These
include the previously studied Cu-O-Cu/MOR (ref. 11), bis-¬µ-oxo
Cu/MOR (ref. 17), and Cu3O3/MOR (ref. 16) motifs. This finding is
especially relevant given that Cu3O3/MOR (purple square, Fig. 4b)
was recently demonstrated to have an order of magnitude greater
methanol yield (per Cu atom) than other zeolites16. Additionally,
certain materials that, to the best of our knowledge, have not
yet been tested for partial oxidation of methane, such as oxygen-
promoted IrO2, also lie close to the peak of the volcano. It should
be stressed that this volcano elucidates only the ability of a catalyst
to break the initial C‚ÄìH bond in methane, and is meant to serve as
a guide in the initial stages of catalyst discovery. We do not claim
that materials near the peak of the volcano such as IrO2 will be
selective to methanol formation, but instead suggest that IrO2 is
likely to have high methane activation activity at low temperatures.
While a new catalyst‚Äôs selectivity must be explored separately, this
simple kinetic and thermodynamic model can provide a useful
foundation for easily evaluating the often rate-limiting crucial first
step in methane oxidation.
For computational screening approaches to be viable for
materials discovery, suitable scaling relationships that avoid the
computationally expensive calculation of TS energies are necessary.
Traditionally, most of the reported descriptor approaches have been
limited to describing one reaction within a single class of catalyst
materials2,23‚Äì26. In this work, we have shown that hydrocarbon
activation provides a unique opportunity for the development
of a universal scaling relationship that accurately describes a
vast library of catalyst materials and reactions, which has not
been previously demonstrated. We postulate that this is possible
because the radical-like TS interacts with only one site on the
catalyst surface, and, therefore, does not depend significantly on
catalyst geometry.

Figure 5 | Identifying promising catalysts for methane activation using
scaling. Rate volcano for diferent zeolite topologies (AEI, AFX, MAZ, MOR,
FAU) for MmOx active site motifs (red squares), 4d and 5d transition metal
cations for M-O/CHA (half-Ô¨Ålled red squares) and oxides (perovskites and
strained IrO2, blue circles). The Ô¨Ålled symbols correspond to systems for
which a TS was explicitly calculated using DFT and half-Ô¨Ålled symbols
represent the rates predicted by the universal scaling relationship. Grey
points are the original set of materials shown in Fig. 4.
Our analysis provides the guidelines necessary to predict and
compare the performance of new catalysts with the existing
materials used for C‚ÄìH bond activation reactions. One approach to
improving activity is to tune the formation energy of the active site
motif (1Gf) by changing the physical characteristics of the catalyst.
We illustrate this approach by evaluating diÔ¨Äerent zeolite topologies
(AEI, AFX, MAZ, MOR, FAU), including 4d and 5d transition
metal cations for M-O/CHA motif, inducing strain in IrO2 and
evaluating perovskites for C‚ÄìH activation. Figure 5 shows that all
of these materials follow one of the two scaling lines identified
earlier, and many fall in the high-activity region of the volcano
plot (details in Supplementary Table 1). While the provided analysis
does not guarantee any of these materials to be selective to partial
oxidation, it does answer the question of whether methane will be
activated at a given temperature. Undoubtedly, many catalysts that
are able to activate methane at low temperatures will have poor
selectivity, but no catalyst that fails to activate methane can go on
to be selective. The methods presented herein are meant to quickly
determine whether a new material of interest can successfully
activate methane and should be examined further. Only once the
question of methane activation is answered can the diÔ¨Écult problem
of selectivity be explored.

Methods
Metals and oxides. The plane-wave QuantumEspresso code and Bayesian error
estimation functional with Van der Waals corrections (BEEF-vdw) functional was
used for the DFT calculations. All adsorption and TS energy calculations for metal
and oxide surfaces were spin-polarized. For adsorption of ‚ÄìO and ‚ÄìOH species,
spin polarization did not aÔ¨Äect the adsorption energies and non-spin polarized
calculations were used. Forces on all atoms were minimized to 0.05 eV √Ö‚àí1. For
oxides, perovskites and metals, (6,6,1) k-point sampling was employed. A 2 √ó 1
expansion of the 110 surface unit cell is used for oxides and perovskites, while a
3√ó3 expansion of the 111 surface unit cell was used for metals. Metals, oxides and
perovskites slabs were composed of four stoichiometric layers separated by
15 √Ö vacuum, and the bottom two layers were kept fixed to simulate the bulk. For
each active site motif and material category, we performed climbing-image nudged
elastic band calculations to determine the location of the TS.
Zeolites, MOFs, graphenes and nanoparticles. All calculations were
performed using the BEEF-vdW functional as implemented in the periodic Vienna
Ab Initio Simulation (VASP) code. All possible spin multiplicities are
considered to determine the ground-state electronic configuration. For
zeolites, MOFs and nanoparticles only the gamma point was used, while a (3,3,1)
k-point sampling was employed for the decorated graphene sheets. Forces on
all atoms were converged to 0.03 eV √Ö‚àí1. The initial zeolite structures were
obtained from the IZA database (http://www.iza-structure.org/databases) and the
lattice constants were optimized at an energy cutoÔ¨Äof 700 eV. All further geometry
optimizations and TS calculations were performed using fixed unit cell size
at a plane-wave cutoÔ¨Äof 400 eV. The MOF-74 structures were obtained
from ref. 18 and were similarly optimized. For each active site motif and
material category shown in Fig. 1, climbing-image nudged elastic band
calculations and the dimer method are used to determine the location of
the TS.
Entropic contributions are found to be similar for all materials, so for
the purposes of scaling the zero-point energy entropy contributions (at the
harmonic approximation) on IrO2 are used to calculate free energies at
various temperatures.
