Abstract 
Co3O4 is a metal oxide catalyst with weak, tunable M-O bonds promising for catalysis. 
Here density functional theory (DFT) is used to study the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of 
ethane on Co3O4 nanorods based on the preferred surface orientation (111) from the 
experimental electron-microcopy image. The pathway and energetics of the full catalytic cycle 
including the first and second C-H bond cleavages, hydroxyl clustering, water formation, and 
oxygen-site regeneration are determined. We find that both lattice O and Co may participate as 
active sites in the dehydrogenation, with the lattice-O pathway being favored. We identify the 
best ethane ODH pathway based on the overall energy profiles of several routes. We identify that 
water formation from the lattice oxygen has the highest energy barrier and is likely a rate-
determining step. This work of the complete catalytic cycle of ethane ODH will allow further 
study into tuning the surface chemistry of Co3O4 nanorods for high selectivity of alkane ODH 
reactions.

1. Introduction 
The conversion of alkanes such as ethane and propane into olefins is an industrially and 
economically important process and produces a significant portion of highly desired feedstock 
used in the chemical industry. Due to the high expense and energy cost of steam cracking to 
produce these olefins, there has been intense effort in recent years to search for more selective 
and energetically efficient methods.1 Catalytic oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) has been 
proposed as an attractive alternative with the advantage of being more thermodynamically 
favored and with the potential to have greater selectivity at lower temperatures. These qualities 
of the ODH pathway would significantly reduce the costs of olefin production to suit the quickly 
increasing global demand.2 
A wide variety of catalytic materials have been studied for the ODH reaction: earth-
abundant metal oxides3-18 appear as a cost effective and more viable alternative to noble metal 
catalysts. In particular, spinel cobalt oxide (Co3O4) is a particularly promising candidate which 
has been found to be very active in many oxidation reactions including those of CO,19 CH4,20 and 
other hydrocarbons.21 A major factor in the catalytic activity of Co3O4 is the very weak M-O 
bond among other transition metal oxides22 and the presence of readily generated oxygen 
vacancies at the surface.20, 23 Experimental and theoretical studies have identified a number of 
stable surfaces on the Co3O4 nanoparticles and nanorods, including the (100), (110) and (111) 
surfaces.19, 21, 24-32  
Of these surfaces, the high activity of the (110) facet in these studies for reactions such as 
CO oxidation has been widely reported; however, the (111) surface has been found to be readily 
formed26, 29 and more thermodynamically stable28 than the (110) surface. Therefore, the 
morphology of Co3O4 nanocatalysts may greatly impact their catalytic activity due to the

difference in preferred surface orientations and it would be very interesting to understand the 
change in the reaction mechanism on those different surfaces. DFT has been employed in many 
previous studies on the surface properties and catalytic activity of Co3O4 that is thought to 
proceed via the Mars-van Krevelen mechanism involving the lattice oxygen on the surface.33-37 
These active oxygen species react and desorb as products to form vacancies which must then be 
regenerated from gaseous molecular oxygen in order to maintain the catalytic activity of the 
surface.  
Several recent works have shown that modifying the pure Co3O4 surface can improve its 
performance for alkane activation. These methods include doping transition metals such as Ni to 
facilitate the oxidation of alkanes20 and depositing nonmetallic elements such as Si and Ge on the 
surface of Co3O4 nanorods to tune the selectivity of the catalyst towards the ethane ODH 
product.38 However, the underlying mechanism of how the modification of the Co3O4 surface by 
other elements changes the activity and selectivity of the nanocatalyst for ethane ODH remains 
unclear.  
As a first step toward understanding the roles of morphology control and surface 
modification in Co3O4 nanocatalysts for ethane ODH, herein we will present the detailed analysis 
of the full catalytic cycle from first principles based on the experimental determination of the 
preferred surface orientation of Co3O4 nanorods. We hope to elucidate the nature of the two C-H 
activations to produce ethylene, the formation of water, and the regeneration of the oxygen sites 
to complete the catalytic cycle. These insights will provide a better understanding of the role of 
the different active surface atoms on a specific surface orientation in determining selectivity and 
yield of the ethane ODH pathway that may allow one to design better Co3O4 nanocatalysts.

2. Experimental and Computational Methods 
Co3O4 nanorods were synthesized via a previously reported method.23, 39 Briefly, cobalt 
acetate tetrahydrate was dissolved in ethylene glycol and heated to 160 oC under N2; then reacted 
with the slowly added NaHCO3 aqueous solution under vigorous stirring. After centrifugation a 
purple precipitate was obtained, which was then dried at 50 oC under vacuum and calcined at 350 
oC in air to yield the Co3O4 nanorods. Their crystalline form was checked with powder X-ray 
diffraction. Then the nanorods were imaged with the high angle annular dark field (HAADF) 
scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) on a JEOL JEM-ARM200F Transmission 
Electron Microscope at 200 kV. Based on the surface orientation of the Co3O4 nanorods from the 
STEM images, we then employed density functional theory (DFT) to examine the ethane ODH 
pathways on it.  
All DFT calculations were performed using the Vienna ab initio Simulation Package 
(VASP).40, 41 The on-site Coulomb interaction was included using the DFT+U method by 
Dudarev, et al.42 in VASP using a Hubbard parameter of U = 2 eV for Co, which yielded band 
gaps in good agreement with experimental results and was used to good effect in previous DFT 
studies of Co3O4 surface chemistry and catalysis.19, 20 The Perdew-Burke-Erzerhof (PBE)43 form 
of the generalized-gradient approximation (GGA) was chosen for electron exchange and 
correlation. The electron-core interaction was described using the projector-augmented wave 
method (PAW).44, 45 A kinetic energy cutoff of 450 eV was used for the planewaves, and the 
Brillouin zone was sampled using a 3×3×1 Monkhorst-Pack scheme.46 All calculations in this 
work were performed with spin polarization. The slab was created containing 11 layers with the 
bottom 9 layers frozen in their bulk positions. The optimized lattice constant was found to be 
8.14 Å, in very good agreement with the experimental value of 8.09 Å.47

The adsorption energies were defined by Eads = Esurface+adsorbate – (Esurface + Eadsorbate), where 
the energy of the adsorbate Eadsorbate was computed by placing an adsorbate molecule in a cubic 
cell of 10 Å in side length (in other words, the molecule and its nearest periodic images are 
separated by about 10-Å vacuum). Transition states were found via a two-step approach, using 
both the nudged elastic band method (NEB) and the dimer method48 implemented in the VASP-
VTST package by Henkelman et al.49 Initial and final states of the reactions were first created 
and optimized, and were used to generate 8-10 equally spaced images through a linear 
interpolation. These images were then minimized under the NEB constraints to forces of ~0.4-
0.2 eV/Å in order to generate an approximate minimum reaction energy path. The highest two 
energy images along the path were then used to generate a starting geometry for the dimer 
method, until reaching an energy convergence of 0.05 eV/Å. Selected transition states were 
confirmed with vibrational frequency analysis to verify the effectiveness of this method and the 
convergence criterion. 
3. Results and discussion 
3.1 Surface structure of Co3O4 nanorods 
Recent work has shown that Si and Ge modified Co3O4 nanorods improved the selectivity 
and yield of ethane ODH, but the molecular-level mechanism is still unclear.38 Here we first 
direct our attention to modeling the mechanism of ethane ODH on the experimentally produced 
Co3O4 nanorods, so we can examine the role of the surface modification in the future. The 
synthesized Co3O4 nanorods were imaged via the scanning tunneling electron microscopy 
(STEM) (Fig. 1 A-B). The atomic-resolution HAADF-STEM image (Fig. 1B) suggests that the 
Co3O4(111) surface is preferentially exposed in this sample of Co3O4 nanorods. This information 
about the surface orientation provides a desired foundation for our DFT modeling. The

Co3O4(111) surface as well with the Co3O4 (110) surface are both catalytically active and stable 
surfaces confirmed from both experimental and theoretical studies in previous literature.26, 28, 29 
Based on the STEM images, we chose the (111) surface as a model active surface in this work.

area of the Co3O4 nanorod sample, marked with lattice fringes. (C) The surface model used in this DFT 
study for the same Co3O4 (111) surface: only the first three layers are shown for clarity. The two 
inequivalent surface lattice oxygens are labeled as OA and OB: OA is coordinated with three subsurface 
Co3+ atoms (in light blue); OB  is coordinated with two subsurface Co3+ atoms and one surface Co2+ atom. 
 
The Co3O4(111) surface can be terminated into six inequivalent layers; we chose the one 
with the lowest surface energy based on previous DFT calculations.28 This surface model 
terminates to yield tetrahedral Co2+ atoms and triply coordinated oxygen atoms on the surface 
(Fig. 1C). The surface lattice oxygens can be categorized into two types: OA, which are triply 
coordinated to the subsurface cobalt (Co3+); OB, which are doubly coordinate to the subsurface 
Co but also singly coordinated to the surface Co (Fig. 1C). After relaxation of this Co3O4 (111) 
surface termination, the surface Co-OB bonds shorten from 1.952 to 1.788 Å. The OA-Co bonds 
shorten from 1.932 to 1.885 Å. In predicting the reactivity of the two inequivalent lattice O

atoms, we find that OA has a lower vacancy formation energy of 2.488 eV and a higher average 
Bader charge of -0.767 |e|. Meanwhile, the OB has a vacancy formation energy of 2.946 eV and 
an average Bader charge of -0.860 |e|. The average Bader charge of the surface Co was found to 
be 1.298 |e|. The lower OA vacancy formation energy suggests that the OA oxygen is more active 
and more likely to react to result in a vacancy.  
Both OA and OB vacancies lead to minimal surface rearrangement, with the OA vacancy 
leading to the least change in surface bond lengths and the OB vacancy leading to a shortening of 
the remaining two Co- OB bonds from 1.788 to 1.769 Å. These results show that the Co3O4(111) 
surface can readily generate and refill oxygen vacancies without loss of surface structure, 
suggesting a robustness and stability consistent with experimental and theoretical findings,26, 28, 50 
and making it a good candidate as the model for the catalytic surface.  
A less negative Bader charge of OA than OB indicates the increased ability of the OA 
oxygen to further gain electrons, so OA is more electrophilic than OB and thus is the more 
favored active site for the homolytic fission of the C-H bond in the ethane ODH reaction. The 
more negative Bader charge of OB suggests that it is more nucleophilic in character and more 
suited in the heterolytic fission of the C-H bond as part of the metal-oxygen redox pair, where 
the metal cation Co2+ participates as the electrophile. Both the homolytic and heterolytic C-H 
cleavage will be examined next. 
3.2 First C-H activation of ethane 
In alkane oxidation reactions over metal oxides, both the full oxidation and ODH 
reactions proceed first via C-H activation onto the surface. Thus, we first study the activation of 
the ethane C-H bond by either a surface oxygen or cobalt. They can be characterized as either

homolytic or heterolytic mechanisms, via the lattice oxygen or lattice cobalt, respectively.21, 51-53 
In the homolytic case, the oxygen atom abstracts a hydrogen from the alkane, forming an alkyl 
radical which then reacts with a nearby lattice oxygen. In the heterolytic case, the reaction occurs 
over the Co-O acid-base site pair with the lattice Co activating the C-H bond via σ-bond 
metathesis, leading to Co-C2H5 and O-H.

Co2+ activated heterolytic reactions. Reactions 1C-E are O activated homolytic reactions. 
 
We examined both the heterolytic and homolytic pathways on Co3O4(111) surface. Based 
on the configuration of the surface cobalt and oxygen, there should be five possible final states. 
Starting with a weakly physisorbed C2H6 on the surface, we found the minimum energy paths

and transition states leading to the five final states. These transition and final states are illustrated 
in Fig. 2, while the energetic profiles are shown in Fig. 3. For the heterolytic activation (reactions 
1A-B), the transition states were found to form a Co-C2H5-H-O complex. The barrier for the 
pathway via OB is 1.02 eV, lower than via OA (1.11 eV), likely due to the fact that OA is slightly 
farther from Co than OB, which results in a less stable transition state complex. For homolytic 
activation (reactions 1C-E), the transition states show the formation of the CH3CH2--H--O 
complex where the C-H-O angle is almost 180 degrees, while in the final states the ethyl group 
attaches to another nearby lattice O. Reaction 1C is activated by the OA oxygen with a barrier of 
0.62 eV, whereas reaction 1D and 1E are both activated by the OB oxygen with a similar barrier 
of 0.98 to 1.03 eV. The stronger oxidizing power of OA than OB, as indicated by the charge 
analysis, corroborates the lower activation energy of the first C-H activation on OA.

The energy barriers (Ea) and reaction energies (∆E) of both heterolytic and homolytic 
pathways of 1A-E are compared in Table 1, together with those of propane from another study.21 
We find that our calculated barriers are in very good agreement with the propane barriers for the 
same surface. It is apparent that the homolytic pathway is both the thermodynamically and 
kinetically favored reaction path due to both the overall lower barriers as well as the more 
negative reaction energies. The OA-catalyzed pathway has the lowest barrier by far with a value 
of 0.62 eV. These results are also in good agreement with the propane DFT results and consistent 
with the higher bond dissociation energy of the ethane C-H bond.

3.3 Second C-H activation and C2H4 formation 
We further examined the second C-H activation of ethane following the first C-H 
activation. Reactions 1A and 1C were selected as the best starting points for the second 
activation for the heterolytic and homolytic cases, respectively. The subsequent second C-H 
pathways (transition states and final states) are illustrated in Fig. 4, while the energy profiles are 
shown in Fig. 5. In the heterolytic case (following 1A), the second C-H bond is activated via OB 
on the CH3 group, or the β-hydrogen elimination, (2A); via OB on the CH2 group, or the α-

hydrogen elimination, (2B); or via OA by the β-hydrogen elimination (2C). We find that the 2C 
path has the lowest barrier of only 0.39 eV (Fig. 5). In the homolytic case (following 1C), the 
second C-H bond is activated via either OA by the β-hydrogen elimination (2D), OB by the α-
hydrogen elimination, (2E), or the OA-H in the previous step by the α-hydrogen elimination (2F). 
We found that 2D and 2E pathways yield very similar barriers of 1.26 eV (Fig. 5). The 2F 
pathway has a much higher barrier of 2.46 eV, because the presence of a preexisting adsorbed 
hydrogen on the lattice O severely deactivates it from further C-H activation.

The barriers and reaction energies of the second C-H activation are compared in Table 2. 
Most notably, the second C-H activation following the heterolytic pathway (1A then 2C) appears 
to have lower barriers than following the homolytic pathway (1C then 2D or 2E). This result is 
also consistent with the DFT study of propane on the Co3O4 (110) surface.21 Reactions via β-
hydrogen elimination, 2A, 2C, and 2D all lead to ethylene formation. In the case of 2A and 2C, 
we found that desorption of C2H4 is uphill by about 1.0 eV, while in the case of 2D, C2H4 was 
found to spontaneously go to the gas phase. Reactions 2B, 2E, and 2F via α-hydrogen 
elimination generate CH3CH which were found to bind very strongly to the surface Co or O with 
a strength greater than 2 eV. We expect that the CH3CH intermediate is unlikely to result in 
ethylene production and more likely to be part of the further oxidation pathways.

3.4 Hydroxyl clustering, water formation, and water desorption 
Following the second C-H activation, ethylene will desorb in the ODH reaction, leaving 
two lattice O sites with adsorbed hydrogen, that is, formation of hydroxyls. Previous 
experimental isotopic studies have thoroughly shown that the oxidation and ODH reactions result 
in the formation of water containing the lattice oxygen.20 Therefore, these surface hydroxyls will 
come closer (clustering), then form water, and desorb from the surface, in order for the catalytic 
cycle to proceed. This simplistic path for hydroxyl clustering is via diffusion of the hydrogen 
atom from a surface hydroxyl to a neighboring lattice oxygen. With two hydroxyl groups nearby, 
then one hydrogen of a hydroxyl can combine with the neighboring hydroxyl to form water. The 
barrier for a representative H diffusion from OA to OB on the Co3O4(111) surface was found to be 
1.35 eV (Fig. 6A). Next, we examined the water formation from two neighboring hydroxyl 
groups (Fig. 6B) and the barrier increases to 2.02 eV.

Fig. 6 Initial, transition, and final states of hydrogen diffusion across the Co3O4 (111) surface: A, 
diffusion of hydrogen from OA to OB; B, diffusion of hydrogen from OB to a OA-H hydroxyl group. 
 
After the H-O-H species is formed on the surface (Fig. 6B), it can then desorb to the gas 
phase. This desorption energy was found to be 0.581 eV, much lower than the lattice-oxygen 
vacancy formation energy (2.488 eV for the OA atom). Indeed, the addition of two hydrogen 
atoms on the lattice oxygen destabilizes the system and lengthening the Co-O bonds. Oxygen 
vacancies are then formed following the desorption of water. 
3.5 Regeneration of lattice oxygen sites 
The oxygen vacancies left from water desorption can react with gas phase O2 to 
regenerate the lattice oxygen sites. A very likely scenario would be that one gaseous O2 molecule 
refills at a double oxygen vacancy site. We found that O2 first binds vertically on one of the 
vacancies and then one oxygen atom of O2 then dissociates to the neighboring vacancy site. We 
calculated the barrier of this process and found that it occurs via a barrier of only 0.51 eV and a 
reaction energy of -4.24 eV (Fig. 7A). These double vacancies may be generated through the 
process of continued water formation/desorption reactions on the surface during the catalytic

cycle, or through vacancy diffusion across the surface. The diffusion of these oxygen vacancies 
were also studied and found to have a barrier of 1.63 eV for a diffusion from a vacancy at OA to 
OB (Fig. 7B). This double-vacancy regeneration model with very low barriers is also consistent 
with previous theoretical works on the Co3O4(110) surface.19, 21 Thus, we can conclude that 
regeneration of the lattice oxygen sites is highly facile in oxygen rich environments and unlikely 
to be a rate-determining step in the overall catalytic cycle.

3.6 Overall energy profile 
Fig. 8 shows the overall energy profile including the first and second C-H activations, 
hydroxyl clustering via hydrogen diffusion, and water formation and desorption. We select the 
1C-2D reaction path as the most representative ODH pathway through consideration of both 
activation energies, reaction energies, and product desorption. We omit the vacancy regeneration 
portion of the cycle for simplicity as well as the fact that its barriers are quite low in comparison. 
Fig. 8 shows that the water formation step is the least energetically favored step and a possible 
rate-determining step in the overall catalytic cycle. Alternative to the 1C-2D path, we also

considered a competitive path via the 1A-2C channel where the first C-H activation is via Co2+ 
and the second C-H activation is via OA. We found that again the water formation is the rate-
determining step (RDS) in this mechanism.

A schematic drawing of the complete catalytic cycle for the homolytic path is shown in 
Fig. 9, composed of the first and second C-H activations, hydrogen diffusion, water formation, 
and lattice-oxygen regeneration. It starts with C2H6 adsorption, followed by the first C-H 
cleavage on lattice OA. Then, the second C-H cleavage takes place on another lattice OA, leading 
to formation and desorption of C2H4. Next, hydroxyl clusters via hydrogen diffusion and water 
forms from nearby hydroxyl groups. Water desorbs and leaves lattice-oxygen vacancy, which is 
refilled by molecular oxygen. The cycle repeats.

3.7 Implications of the present DFT results 
Our present DFT study of ethane ODH on the Co3O4 (111) surface presents several 
interesting perspectives regarding the reaction characteristics. First, we find that for ethane, the 
first step of the reaction occurs via the activation of its C-H bond over either the Co2+ or the OA /

OB atoms. While the first C-H activation is strongly favored towards the O-activated homolytic 
pathway, the second C-H activation is in fact more favored towards the heterolytic pathway. In 
reality, it is likely for both pathways to participate in the formation of ethylene; however, without 
further kinetic analysis it would be very difficult to quantify their respective contributions 
towards forming the ODH product.  
Next, we have found that the vacancy formation energy and Bader charge of the lattice 
oxygen to be a good descriptor of the catalytic activity of the lattice oxygen. We were able to 
predict the OA oxygen to have lower barriers for C-H activation than the OB oxygen. We would 
expect this trend to hold for lattice oxygen atoms of different Co3O4 surfaces, such as (110), 
(100), and (112), which could be important of Co3O4 nanocatalysts with different morphologies.  
We find that the water formation step of the catalytic cycle on the pure (111) surface 
appears to be the RDS, while experiments shows that changing the alkane will change the overall 
barriers,54 thus suggesting that the C-H activation barrier is significant to the overall rates. Based 
on preliminary DFT results, we believe that the hydroxylation of the surface will affect the 
energy profile by increasing the barriers of C-H activation and reducing the barriers of H2O 
formation. In this model, we can then expect that the actual experimental energy profile will 
have the C-H activation and water formation barriers approach in energy at a steady-state 
hydrogen coverage of the surface. Thus, varying C-H bond strength would in fact affect the rates 
of the overall ODH reaction. 
Experimental findings have indeed shown that surface hydroxylation occurs on the 
surfaces of metal oxides as the dominant species during and after a reaction.55, 56 In addition, 
water formation, and consequently water concentration were found to affect the rates of the 
ODH/oxidation reactions on many studied metal oxides.55, 57-59 This phenomenon occurs for CO

and CH4 oxidation on Co3O4 as well.56, 60, 61 These experimental findings support our conclusion 
that the water formation is an important step of the ethane ODH on Co3O4(111). This 
phenomenon is notably absent in CO oxidation, which is consistent with experimental 
observations of CO oxidations having much lower barriers and reaction temperatures than alkane 
oxidation. The coverage effect of surface hydroxyl groups on the catalytic pathways thus 
warrants further studies.  
The experimental work of ethane ODH on Co3O4 nanorods38 have focused on 
ethylene/CO2 selectivity and ethylene yield as a function of surface modification by Si and Ge 
oxides. Detailed kinetic data such as reaction rates and apparent activation energy on the 
unmodified Co3O4 nanorods are still not available for a direct comparison. To compare with the 
experimental ethylene/CO2 selectivity, the complete pathway of ethane combustion has to be 
mapped out, which requires substantial more work and is beyond the scope of the present work. 
A joint experimental and computational study is expected for the near future to directly compare 
the computational results and the experimental data. 
The present DFT study focuses on the (111) surface based on the STEM images of our 
Co3O4 nanorod sample (Fig. 1), but other facets may also exist such as the (100) and (110) 
surfaces depending upon preparation methods and calcination temperature. The different facets 
can affect the energetics of the elementary steps because the oxygen reactivity can be different. 
For example, the (110)-B surface of Co3O4 has a twofold-coordinate oxygen site, in contrast with 
the threefold-coordinate oxygen sites on the (111) surface. How this twofold-coordinate oxygen 
site on the (110)-B surface would change the energetics of ethane ODH steps is a question that 
we intend to find out in a future study.

4. Conclusions 
We have studied the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of ethane to ethylene on the 
Co3O4(111) surface with DFT+U, in order to understand the mechanism on Co3O4 nanorods. The 
more reactive lattice oxygen (OA) was found to yield the lowest barriers for the first C-H 
activation, consistent with our predictions based on vacancy formation energy and Bader 
charges. Overall, we found the barriers for the first C-H activation to be lower for the homolytic 
pathway (~0.62 eV), but the barriers for the second C-H activation to be lower for the heterolytic 
pathway. The cleaved hydrogen from C2H6 forms hydroxyl groups on Co3O4(111), which can 
cluster via hydrogen diffusion. Water formation from nearby hydroxyl groups and desorption to 
leave oxygen vacancy on the surface were found to have a large activation energy (2.02 eV) and 
is likely to be the rate-determining step. These vacancies can readily react with oxygen 
molecules in gas phase to regenerate the lattice oxygen sites. These insights will help understand 
the role of the surface orientation of the Co3O4 nanocatalysts in improving the selectivity and 
yield of alkane to alkene conversion through ODH.
