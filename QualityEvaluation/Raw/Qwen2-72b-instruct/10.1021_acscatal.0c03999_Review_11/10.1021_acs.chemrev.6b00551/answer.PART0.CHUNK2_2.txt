[1] "3.4 Halogen-Assisted Dehydrogenation of Alkanes (C2C5)"
[2] "Olefins are extensively used as building blocks in the production of a vast array of chemicals, including polymers, oxygenates, and important chemical intermediates."
[3] "In this context, halogens play a unique role in the dehydrogenation of various alkanes, affording an exceptionally high selectivity to the respective alkenes (Table 6)."
[4] "Depending on the forms of how halogens are involved, these reactions can be classified into three groups: iodine-mediated dehydrogenation, molten salts (metal chlorides and iodides) catalyzed oxidative dehydrogenation, and bihalogen-aided dehydrogenation."
[5] "3.4.1 Iodine-Mediated Dehydrogenation"
[6] "The substitution of molecular iodine with various hydrocarbons has long been known, but it is generally recognized that iodine is poorly reactive toward saturated hydrocarbons."
[7] "A free radical mechanism was also proposed for the stoichiometric iodination, consisting of successive hydrogen abstraction reactions involving both atomic and molecular iodine."
[8] "3.4.2 Alkali Metal Chloride-Catalyzed Oxidative Dehydrogenation"
[9] "Supported alkali metal chloride catalysts have been demonstrated to be one of the most promising candidates for the oxidative dehydrogenation of light aliphatic alkanes (C2C4) to olefins."
[10] "3.4.3 Metal Iodide-Catalyzed Oxidative Dehydrogenation"
[11] "Oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes can also be catalyzed by iodide-based molten salts."
[12] "Compared to the iodination reactions, the oxidative dehydrogenation usually shows higher alkane conversions and comparable or even superior selectivity at much lower temperatures (Table 6)."
[13] "3.4.4 Bi-Halogens Interplay in Propane Dehydrogenation"
[14] "Propane dehydrogenation to propylene has been extensively explored as an alternative approach to supplement the current propylene production based on steam cracking, fluidic catalytic cracking of naphtha and other hydrocarbons, and SAPO-34 catalyzed methanol to mixed olefins."
[15] "Recently, Stucky et al. developed a low-temperature route for propane dehydrogenation by using bihalogens (Br2 and I2) as the mediators."
[16] "A high yield of C3H6+C3H7X (X = Br and I) up to 80% was attained at moderate reaction temperatures below 800 K."
[17] "The interplay between Br2 and I2 was believed to be crucial, combining the high reactivity of bromine and high selectivity of iodine."

1.Halogen-assisted methods for selectively dehydrogenating propane to propene include iodine-mediated dehydrogenation, alkali metal chloride-catalyzed oxidative dehydrogenation, metal iodide-catalyzed oxidative dehydrogenation, and bihalogen interplay. Iodine-mediated dehydrogenation involves the substitution of molecular iodine with hydrocarbons, with a free radical mechanism proposed involving hydrogen abstraction reactions. Alkali metal chloride-catalyzed oxidative dehydrogenation uses supported alkali metal chloride catalysts for the oxidative dehydrogenation of light aliphatic alkanes to olefins. Metal iodide-catalyzed oxidative dehydrogenation utilizes iodide-based molten salts, showing higher alkane conversions and comparable or superior selectivity at lower temperatures compared to iodination reactions. Bi-halogen interplay, using Br2 and I2 as mediators, combines the high reactivity of bromine and high selectivity of iodine for propane dehydrogenation at moderate temperatures below 800 K. Propane's reactivity in these processes differs significantly from other alkanes due to its unique chemical structure and the specific reaction conditions required for selective dehydrogenation.
