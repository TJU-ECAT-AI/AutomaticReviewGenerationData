1.Halogens play a unique role in the dehydrogenation of various alkanes, affording an exceptionally high selectivity to the respective alkenes. The methods for selectively dehydrogenating propane to propene include iodine-mediated dehydrogenation, molten salts (metal chlorides and iodides) catalyzed oxidative dehydrogenation, and bihalogen-aided dehydrogenation. Iodine-mediated dehydrogenation involves the substitution of molecular iodine with hydrocarbons, which is generally recognized as poorly reactive toward saturated hydrocarbons. A free radical mechanism was proposed for the stoichiometric iodination, consisting of successive hydrogen abstraction reactions involving both atomic and molecular iodine. Molten salts (metal chlorides and iodides) catalyzed oxidative dehydrogenation uses supported alkali metal chloride catalysts, which have been demonstrated to be one of the most promising candidates for the oxidative dehydrogenation of light aliphatic alkanes (C2C4) to olefins. The promotional effect of chlorides in these catalysts was reported by Lercher et al., who compared the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane between Li/Dy2O3MgO and LiCl/Dy2O3MgO and found that the chloride-modified catalysts were ten times more active than the chloride-free ones. A reverse Mars-van Krevelen mechanism was suggested for the activation of ethane over KCl-LiCl/Dy2O3MgO. Oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes can also be catalyzed by iodide-based molten salts.

1.卤素在各种烷烃的脱氢反应中起着独特的作用，对相应的烯烃具有异常高的选择性。选择性脱氢丙烷至丙烯的方法包括碘介导的脱氢、金属卤化物熔盐催化氧化脱氢和双卤素辅助脱氢。碘介导的脱氢涉及分子碘与烃的置换，这通常被认为对饱和烃的反应性较差。提出了一个自由基机制来解释碘化物的计量碘化，包括涉及原子和分子碘的连续氢原子抽提反应。金属卤化物熔盐催化氧化脱氢使用支持的碱金属氯化物催化剂，这些催化剂已被证明是C2C4轻质脂肪族烷烃氧化脱氢至烯烃的最有希望的候选者之一。Lercher等人报道了氯化物在这些催化剂中的促进作用，他们比较了Li/Dy2O3MgO和LiCl/Dy2O3MgO对乙烷氧化脱氢的影响，发现含氯化物的催化剂比不含氯化物的催化剂活性高十倍。提出了一个反向Mars-van Krevelen机制来解释KCl-LiCl/Dy2O3MgO上乙烷的活化。烷烃的氧化脱氢也可以通过碘化物基熔盐催化。金属卤化物在脱氢中的作用尚未得到充分理解，但共识是它们作为吸附和释放I2的介质。壳牌开发了一种基于金属卤化物的有趣氧化脱氢过程，用于各种烃。丙烷脱氢至丙烯已被广泛探索，作为补充当前基于蒸汽裂解、流体催化裂解石脑油和其他烃以及SAPO-34催化甲醇至混合烯烃的丙烯生产的一种替代方法。碘介导的脱氢通常比传统脱氢路线产生更高的丙烯产量。最近，Stucky等人开发了一种使用双卤素（Br2和I2）作为介质的低温丙烷脱氢路线。在800 K以下的中等反应温度下，C3H6+C3H7X（X = Br和I）的高产量高达80%。Br2和I2之间的相互作用被认为是关键，结合了溴的高反应性和碘的高选择性。
