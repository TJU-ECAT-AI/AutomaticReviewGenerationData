1.Halogen-assisted dehydrogenation of alkanes (C2C5) is a process that converts alkanes into olefins, which are widely used as building blocks in the production of various chemicals. The methods for selectively dehydrogenating propane to propene include iodine-mediated dehydrogenation, molten salts (metal chlorides and iodides) catalyzed oxidative dehydrogenation, and bihalogen-aided dehydrogenation. Iodine-mediated dehydrogenation involves the substitution of molecular iodine with hydrocarbons, but iodine is poorly reactive toward saturated hydrocarbons. Molten salts (metal chlorides and iodides) catalyzed oxidative dehydrogenation uses supported alkali metal chloride catalysts, which are promising for the oxidative dehydrogenation of light aliphatic alkanes (C2C4) to olefins. Oxidative dehydrogenation in the presence of molten salts (acting as hydrogen iodide acceptors) is an effective alternative to overcome the difficulties of iodine substitution. The functions of metal iodides in the dehydrogenation are not well-understood. An interesting oxidative dehydrogenation process for various hydrocarbons, based on metal iodides, was developed by Shell. Propane dehydrogenation to propylene has been extensively explored as an alternative approach to supplement the current propylene production. Iodine-mediated dehydrogenation generally gives higher propylene yields compared to the conventional dehydrogenation routes. Recently, Stucky et al. developed a low-temperature route for propane dehydrogenation by using bihalogens (Br2 and I2) as the mediators. The reaction conditions for each method vary, but they generally involve high temperatures and the presence of halogens or molten salts. The reactivity of propane in these processes differs significantly from that of other alkanes such as methane and ethane due to the different functional groups and leaving groups involved in the reactions.

1.卤素辅助的C2C5烷烃脱氢是一种将烷烃转化为烯烃的过程，烯烃被广泛用作生产各种化学品的构建块。选择性将丙烷脱氢为丙烯的卤素辅助方法包括碘介导的脱氢、金属氯化物和碘化物熔盐催化氧化脱氢以及双卤素辅助脱氢。碘介导的脱氢涉及分子碘与烃的取代，但碘对饱和烃的反应性较差。金属氯化物和碘化物熔盐催化氧化脱氢使用支持的碱金属氯化物催化剂，这些催化剂对于C2C4轻质脂肪族烷烃氧化脱氢为烯烃很有前景。在熔盐（作为氢碘化物受体）存在下进行的氧化脱氢是一种有效的替代方案，可以克服碘取代的困难。金属碘化物在脱氢中的作用尚不清楚。壳牌公司开发了一种基于金属碘化物的有趣氧化脱氢过程，用于各种烃类。丙烷脱氢为丙烯已被广泛探索，作为补充当前基于蒸汽裂解、流体催化裂解和SAPO-34催化甲醇制混合烯烃的丙烯生产的替代方法。碘介导的脱氢通常比传统脱氢路线产生更高的丙烯产量。最近，Stucky等人开发了一种使用双卤素（Br2和I2）作为介质的低温丙烷脱氢路线。每种方法的反应条件各不相同，但通常涉及高温和卤素或熔盐的存在。这些过程中丙烷的反应性与甲烷和乙烷等其他烷烃的反应性有显著差异，这是由于反应中涉及的不同官能团和离去基团。
