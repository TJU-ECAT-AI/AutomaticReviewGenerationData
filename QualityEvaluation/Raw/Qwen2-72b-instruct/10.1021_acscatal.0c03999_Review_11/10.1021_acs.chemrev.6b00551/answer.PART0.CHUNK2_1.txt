[2] "Olefins are extensively used as building blocks in the production of a vast array of chemicals, including polymers, oxygenates, and important chemical intermediates."
[3] "In this context, halogens play a unique role in the dehydrogenation of various alkanes, affording an exceptionally high selectivity to the respective alkenes (Table 6)."
[4] "Depending on the forms of how halogens are involved, these reactions can be classified into three groups: iodine-mediated dehydrogenation, molten salts (metal chlorides and iodides) catalyzed oxidative dehydrogenation, and bihalogen-aided dehydrogenation."

[6] "The substitution of molecular iodine with various hydrocarbons has long been known, but it is generally recognized that iodine is poorly reactive toward saturated hydrocarbons."

1.Halogens play a unique role in the dehydrogenation of various alkanes, providing exceptionally high selectivity to the corresponding alkenes. The methods for selectively dehydrogenating propane to propene include iodine-mediated dehydrogenation, alkali metal chloride-catalyzed oxidative dehydrogenation, metal iodide-catalyzed oxidative dehydrogenation, and bihalogen-aided dehydrogenation. Iodine-mediated dehydrogenation involves the substitution of molecular iodine with hydrocarbons, but iodine is poorly reactive toward saturated hydrocarbons. A free radical mechanism is proposed, consisting of successive hydrogen abstraction reactions involving both atomic and molecular iodine. Alkali metal chloride-catalyzed oxidative dehydrogenation uses supported alkali metal chloride catalysts for the oxidative dehydrogenation of light aliphatic alkanes to olefins. Metal iodide-catalyzed oxidative dehydrogenation uses iodide-based molten salts to catalyze the oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes. Bi-halogens interplay in propane dehydrogenation involves using bihalogens (Br2 and I2) as mediators for propane dehydrogenation. Adding a small amount of bromine to the iodination reaction can significantly promote propane conversion and the selectivity of the desired products. Propane dehydrogenation to propylene has been extensively explored as an alternative approach to supplement current propylene production methods. Iodine-mediated dehydrogenation generally gives higher propylene yields compared to conventional dehydrogenation routes. The reactivity of propane in these processes differs significantly from that of other alkanes such as methane and ethane due to the different functional groups and leaving groups involved in the reactions.
