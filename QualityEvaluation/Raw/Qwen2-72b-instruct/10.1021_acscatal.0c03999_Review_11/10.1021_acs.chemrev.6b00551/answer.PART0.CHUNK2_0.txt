[2] "Olefins are extensively used as building blocks in the production of a vast array of chemicals, including polymers, oxygenates, and important chemical intermediates."
[3] "In this context, halogens play a unique role in the dehydrogenation of various alkanes, affording an exceptionally high selectivity to the respective alkenes (Table 6)."
[4] "Depending on the forms of how halogens are involved, these reactions can be classified into three groups: iodine-mediated dehydrogenation, molten salts (metal chlorides and iodides) catalyzed oxidative dehydrogenation, and bihalogen-aided dehydrogenation."
[5] "3.4.1 Iodine-Mediated Dehydrogenation"
[6] "The substitution of molecular iodine with various hydrocarbons has long been known, but it is generally recognized that iodine is poorly reactive toward saturated hydrocarbons."
[7] "A free radical mechanism was also proposed for the stoichiometric iodination, consisting of successive hydrogen abstraction reactions involving both atomic and molecular iodine."
[8] "3.4.2 Alkali Metal Chloride-Catalyzed Oxidative Dehydrogenation"

[11] "Oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes can also be catalyzed by iodide-based molten salts."
[12] "Compared to the iodination reactions, the oxidative dehydrogenation usually shows higher alkane conversions and comparable or even superior selectivity at much lower temperatures (Table 6)."
[13] "3.4.4 Bi-Halogens Interplay in Propane Dehydrogenation"
[14] "Propane dehydrogenation to propylene has been extensively explored as an alternative approach to supplement the current propylene production based on steam cracking, fluidic catalytic cracking of naphtha and other hydrocarbons, and SAPO-34 catalyzed methanol to mixed olefins."
[15] "Recently, Stucky et al. developed a low-temperature route for propane dehydrogenation by using bihalogens (Br2 and I2) as the mediators."
[16] "A high yield of C3H6+C3H7X (X = Br and I) up to 80% was attained at moderate reaction temperatures below 800 K."
[17] "The interplay between Br2 and I2 was believed to be crucial, combining the high reactivity of bromine and high selectivity of iodine."

1.Halogens play a unique role in the dehydrogenation of various alkanes, affording an exceptionally high selectivity to the respective alkenes. These reactions can be classified into three groups: iodine-mediated dehydrogenation, molten salts (metal chlorides and iodides) catalyzed oxidative dehydrogenation, and bihalogen-aided dehydrogenation. Iodine-mediated dehydrogenation involves the substitution of molecular iodine with various hydrocarbons, consisting of successive hydrogen abstraction reactions involving both atomic and molecular iodine. Alkali metal chloride-catalyzed oxidative dehydrogenation uses supported alkali metal chloride catalysts for the oxidative dehydrogenation of light aliphatic alkanes (C2C4) to olefins. Metal iodide-catalyzed oxidative dehydrogenation uses iodide-based molten salts to catalyze oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes, showing higher alkane conversions and comparable or even superior selectivity at much lower temperatures. Bi-halogens interplay in propane dehydrogenation involves using bihalogens (Br2 and I2) as mediators for propane dehydrogenation to propylene, combining the high reactivity of bromine and high selectivity of iodine to achieve a high yield of C3H6+C3H7X (X = Br and I) up to 80% at moderate reaction temperatures below 800 K.

2.Propane's reactivity in halogen-assisted dehydrogenation processes differs significantly from that of other alkanes such as methane and ethane due to the different functional groups and leaving groups involved. Methane and ethane have higher stability and weaker C-H bonds, making them less reactive in dehydrogenation processes. Propane, on the other hand, has a tertiary C-H bond that is more reactive and easier to break, leading to higher selectivity for propene in dehydrogenation reactions. The presence of halogens also affects the reactivity of propane, with iodine providing high selectivity and bromine providing high reactivity when used in combination.

1.卤素在各种烷烃的脱氢反应中起着独特的作用，对相应的烯烃具有异常高的选择性。这些反应可以分为三类：碘介导的脱氢、金属氯化物和碘化物熔盐催化的氧化脱氢，以及双卤素辅助的脱氢。碘介导的脱氢涉及分子碘与各种烃类的取代，包括原子碘和分子碘参与的连续氢原子抽提反应。碱金属氯化物催化的氧化脱氢使用支持的碱金属氯化物催化剂将轻质脂肪族烷烃（C2C4）氧化脱氢为烯烃。金属碘化物催化的氧化脱氢使用基于碘化物的熔盐催化烷烃的氧化脱氢，显示出在较低温度下更高的烷烃转化率和相当甚至更优的选择性。双卤素在丙烷脱氢中的相互作用涉及使用双卤素（Br2和I2）作为丙烷脱氢至丙烯的介质，结合溴的高反应性和碘的高选择性，在800K以下的中等反应温度下达到C3H6+C3H7X（X=Br和I）高达80%的高产率。

2.丙烷在卤素辅助脱氢过程中的反应性与甲烷和乙烷等其他烷烃显著不同，这是由于涉及的不同功能基团和离去基团。甲烷和乙烷具有更高的稳定性和较弱的C-H键，使它们在脱氢过程中反应性较低。另一方面，丙烷具有三级C-H键，反应性更强，更容易断裂，导致脱氢反应中对丙烯具有更高的选择性。卤素的存在也会影响丙烷的反应性，碘提供高选择性，溴提供高反应性，当它们组合使用时。
