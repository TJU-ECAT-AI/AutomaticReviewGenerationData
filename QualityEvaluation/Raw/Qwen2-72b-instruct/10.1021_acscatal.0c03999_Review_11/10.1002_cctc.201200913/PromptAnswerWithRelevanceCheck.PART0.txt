Read the questions and answers provided below. First, critically assess the overall relevance of the answers provided to the set of questions asked.

If, upon your assessment, you find that the answers do not contain information that is relevant to the questions asked, stop your review process immediately and respond with a single sentence: "※※※※※※※The provided answers are not relevant to the questions.※※※※※※※". Do not provide any additional explanation or background information, only this sentence should be given as a response in case of irrelevant answers.

If, however, the answers are relevant to the questions asked, proceed to compile answers for each question according to the instructions below. Ensure to aggregate all the relevant answers from the multiple answer results provided in the document, and organize them sequentially by their order number, compiling the corresponding quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question.

If the provided answers' quotes are not differentiated by question, ensure to break them down and assign the quotes to each respective question, outputting them separately within each question's section.

To provide a comprehensive review, differentiate the responses into quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question based on the details given in the 'Answer' XML tags. Structure your review using the XML format showcased below if the answers are relevant to the questions asked:

<questions>

Describe and compare the various halogen-assisted methods for selectively dehydrogenating propane to propene, including dehydrogenation with halogens, oxidative dehydrogenation, oxyhalogenation, and molten metal halide salt approaches. Explain the reaction conditions for each method and analyze why propane's reactivity in these processes differs significantly from that of other alkanes such as methane and ethane.

1.The literature does not provide a detailed comparison of various halogen-assisted methods for selectively dehydrogenating propane to propene. It focuses on the dual-halogen process using bromine and iodine together as oxidants in propane oxidative dehydrogenation. This process achieves a single-pass C3H6+C3H7X yield above 80% at moderate reaction temperatures (<800K). The literature does not discuss dehydrogenation with halogens, oxidative dehydrogenation, oxyhalogenation, or molten metal halide salt approaches in detail. It also does not analyze why propane's reactivity in these processes differs significantly from that of other alkanes such as methane and ethane.

1.文献没有详细比较各种卤素辅助的将丙烷选择性脱氢为丙烯的方法。它专注于使用溴和碘一起作为氧化剂的双卤素过程，在丙烷氧化脱氢中。该过程在适中的反应温度(<800K)下实现了超过80%的C3H6+C3H7X单程产量。文献没有详细讨论卤素脱氢、氧化脱氢、氧卤化或熔融金属卤化盐方法。它也没有分析为什么丙烷在这些过程中的反应性与甲烷和乙烷等其他烷烃有显著差异。
