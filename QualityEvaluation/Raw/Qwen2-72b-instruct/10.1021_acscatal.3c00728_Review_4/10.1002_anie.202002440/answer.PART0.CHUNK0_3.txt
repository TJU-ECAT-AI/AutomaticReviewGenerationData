[1] "Now, the first direct experimental evidence of gas-phase methyl radicals (CH3.) in the ODHP reaction over boron-based catalysts is achieved by using online synchrotron vacuum ultraviolet photoionization mass spectroscopy (SVUV-PIMS), which uncovers the existence of gas-phase radical pathways."
[2] "These observations provide new insights towards understanding the ODHP reaction mechanisms over boron-based catalysts."
[3] "Propene is mainly generated on the catalyst surface from the CH activation of propane, while C2 and C1 products can be formed via both surface-mediated and gas-phase pathways."
[4] "The drastically different product distributions observed in the h-BN and metal oxide-based catalysts imply that the reaction mechanisms are different in these two types of catalysts."
[5] "The proposed mechanism bears similarities to other redox-poor oxides such as MgO,16 and shares their capacity for selective alkane conversions."
[6] "Our findings provide new insights towards understanding the ODHP reaction mechanisms and pathways over boron-based catalysts and are of significance for developing highly selective catalysts for alkane ODH."

1.The multidimensional nature of the ODHP reaction mechanism over B-based catalysts, involving both surface and gas-phase radical reactions, contributes significantly to our understanding of the overall reaction network. The direct experimental evidence of gas-phase methyl radicals using SVUV-PIMS reveals the existence of gas-phase radical pathways, which provides new insights into the ODHP reaction mechanisms over boron-based catalysts. Propene is primarily formed from surface reactions through the activation of propane's CH bonds, while C1 and C2 products can be produced through both surface-mediated and gas-phase reactions. The synergistic effects of these pathways have implications for catalyst performance and design optimization, as they highlight the importance of understanding and controlling both surface and gas-phase reactions for the development of highly selective catalysts for alkane oxidative dehydrogenation.
