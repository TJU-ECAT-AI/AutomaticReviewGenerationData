1.The multidimensional nature of the ODHP reaction mechanism over B-based catalysts, which includes both surface and gas-phase radical reactions, contributes significantly to our understanding of the overall reaction network. The direct experimental evidence of gas-phase methyl radicals using SVUV-PIMS reveals the existence of gas-phase radical pathways, providing new insights into the ODHP reaction mechanisms over boron-based catalysts. Propene is primarily formed from surface reactions involving the CH activation of propane, whereas C2 and C1 products can be produced through both surface-mediated and gas-phase pathways. The distinct product distributions observed in h-BN and metal oxide-based catalysts suggest that the reaction mechanisms differ between these two types of catalysts. The proposed mechanism shares similarities with other redox-poor oxides, such as MgO, and highlights the potential for selective alkane conversions. These findings are crucial for developing highly selective catalysts for alkane oxidative dehydrogenation, as they offer a deeper understanding of the synergistic effects between surface and gas-phase reactions, which can be leveraged to optimize catalyst performance and design.

1.在B基催化剂上，ODHP反应机制的多维性质，包括表面和气相自由基反应，对理解整个反应网络有重大贡献。使用SVUV-PIMS直接实验证据揭示了气相甲基自由基的存在，揭示了气相自由基路径，为理解在硼基催化剂上的ODHP反应机制提供了新的见解。丙烯主要通过表面反应形成，涉及丙烷的CH活化，而C2和C1产品可以通过表面介导和气相途径产生。在h-BN和金属氧化物基催化剂中观察到的明显不同的产物分布表明，这两种类型催化剂的反应机制不同。提出的机制与MgO等其他还原性差的氧化物有相似之处，突出了选择性烷烃转化的潜力。这些发现对于开发高度选择性的烷烃氧化脱氢催化剂至关重要，因为它们提供了对表面和气相反应之间的协同效应的更深入理解，这些效应可以用来优化催化剂性能和设计。
