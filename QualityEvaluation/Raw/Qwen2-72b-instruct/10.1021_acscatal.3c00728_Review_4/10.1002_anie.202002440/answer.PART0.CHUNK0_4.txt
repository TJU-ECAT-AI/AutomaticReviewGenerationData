[1] "Now, the first direct experimental evidence of gas-phase methyl radicals (CH3.) in the ODHP reaction over boron-based catalysts is achieved by using online synchrotron vacuum ultraviolet photoionization mass spectroscopy (SVUV-PIMS), which uncovers the existence of gas-phase radical pathways."
[2] "Propene is mainly generated on the catalyst surface from the CH activation of propane, while C2 and C1 products can be formed via both surface-mediated and gas-phase pathways."
[3] "The drastically different product distributions observed in the h-BN and metal oxide-based catalysts imply that the reaction mechanisms are different in these two types of catalysts."
[4] "The proposed mechanism bears similarities to other redox-poor oxides such as MgO,16 and shares their capacity for selective alkane conversions."

1.The multidimensional nature of the ODHP reaction mechanism over B-based catalysts, which includes both surface and gas-phase radical reactions, contributes significantly to our understanding of the overall reaction network. The direct experimental evidence of gas-phase methyl radicals using SVUV-PIMS uncovers the existence of gas-phase radical pathways. Propene is primarily formed from surface reactions through the activation of propane's CH bonds, while C2 and C1 products can be produced through both surface-mediated and gas-phase reactions. The distinct product distributions observed in h-BN and metal oxide-based catalysts suggest that the reaction mechanisms differ between these two types of catalysts. The synergistic effects of surface and gas-phase reactions have implications for catalyst performance and design optimization, as they highlight the potential for selective alkane conversions, similar to other redox-poor oxides like MgO.

1.B基催化剂上ODHP反应机制的多维性质，包括表面和气相自由基反应，对整体反应网络的理解有重大贡献。使用SVUV-PIMS直接实验证据揭示了气相甲基自由基的存在，证明了气相自由基路径的存在。丙烯主要通过表面反应形成，通过丙烷的CH键激活，而C2和C1产品可以通过表面介导和气相反应形成。在h-BN和金属氧化物基催化剂中观察到的产品分布的显著差异表明，这两种催化剂的反应机制不同。表面和气相反应的协同效应对于催化剂性能和设计优化有影响，因为它们突出了选择性烷烃转化的潜力，类似于其他还原性差的氧化物，如MgO。
