1.The multidimensional nature of the ODHP reaction mechanism over B-based catalysts, which includes both surface and gas-phase radical reactions, is not directly discussed in the literature. However, the literature does highlight the importance of the B[OHO(H)Si]2 structure in the borosilicate zeolite as the active center for the reaction. This structure not only activates molecular oxygen and propane but also hinders full boron hydrolysis during catalysis, leading to high activity and selectivity in a continuous test for a long lifetime. The synergistic effects of surface and gas-phase reactions could potentially optimize catalyst performance and design by tuning the coordination environment of isolated boron species in a zeolite framework.

1.关于B基催化剂上ODHP反应机制的多维性质，包括表面和气相自由基反应，文献中没有直接讨论。然而，文献确实强调了硼硅酸盐沸石中B[OHO(H)Si]2结构作为反应活性中心的重要性。这种结构不仅激活了分子氧和丙烷，而且在催化过程中阻碍了硼的完全水解，导致在长时间连续测试中具有高活性和选择性。表面和气相反应的协同效应可能通过在沸石框架中调整孤立硼物种的配位环境来优化催化剂性能和设计。
