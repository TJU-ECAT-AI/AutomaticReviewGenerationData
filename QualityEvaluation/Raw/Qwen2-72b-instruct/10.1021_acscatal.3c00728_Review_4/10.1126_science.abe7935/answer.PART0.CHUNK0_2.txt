1.The multidimensional nature of the ODHP reaction mechanism over B-based catalysts, encompassing both surface and gas-phase radical reactions, is not directly discussed in the literature. However, the literature does highlight the importance of the B[OHO(H)Si]2 structure in the borosilicate zeolite as the active center for the reaction. This structure not only efficiently activates molecular oxygen and propane to promote dehydrogenation but also hinders full boron hydrolysis during catalysis. The synergistic effects of the surface and gas-phase reactions could potentially lead to a more complex reaction network, which may have implications for catalyst performance and design optimization. The literature does not provide specific details on how these synergistic effects contribute to the overall reaction network or how they can be optimized for catalyst design.

1.在B基催化剂上，ODHP反应机制的多维性质，包括表面和气相自由基反应，并没有在文献中直接讨论。然而，文献确实强调了在硼硅酸盐沸石中B[OHO(H)Si]2结构作为反应活性中心的重要性。这种结构不仅有效地激活了分子氧和丙烷，促进了脱氢反应，而且在催化过程中阻止了硼的完全水解。表面反应和气相反应的协同效应可能会导致更复杂的反应网络，这可能对催化剂性能和设计优化有影响。文献没有提供具体细节，说明这些协同效应如何对整个反应网络做出贡献，或者如何为催化剂设计进行优化。
