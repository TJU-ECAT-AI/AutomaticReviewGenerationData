[1] "Despite the significant achievements obtained regarding the mechanism of the B-based catalysts for the ODHP reaction, the whole reaction network, the detailed activation manner of alkanes, and the interplay between different intermediates are still unknown."
[2] "Therefore, the reaction occurs not only on the 1- and 2-D surface-active sites but also in the 3-D space in the gas phase."
[3] "In the following sections, the experimental and theoretical evidence related to the surface and gas radical reaction mechanisms will be summarized."
[4] "Furthermore, the synergistic effect between the surface and gas-phase reactions in ODHP will also be discussed."
[5] "The effective coupling of the two processes plays an important role in realizing the high activity and high propene selectivity during ODHP."
[6] "The mixed heterogeneous-homogeneous ODH mechanism has been proposed, which can be described as the boron oxide/hydroxide phase on the surface of the catalyst acting as an initiator to form alkyl radicals, which further react in the gas phase."
[7] "Achieving the synergy of the surface reaction and gas radical reaction is of considerable significance to enhance the understanding of the ODHP reaction mechanism and to design a more effective B-based catalytic system."

1.The multidimensional nature of the ODHP reaction mechanism over B-based catalysts, which includes both surface and gas-phase radical reactions, contributes to a more comprehensive understanding of the overall reaction network. The surface reaction mechanism involves the activation of alkanes and the formation of intermediates on the catalyst surface, while the gas radical reaction mechanism involves the propagation of reactions in the 3-D space of the gas phase. The synergistic effects between these two mechanisms are crucial for the high activity and selectivity of propene in the ODHP reaction. The mixed heterogeneous-homogeneous ODH mechanism, where the boron oxide/hydroxide phase on the catalyst surface initiates the formation of alkyl radicals that further react in the gas phase, highlights the importance of achieving synergy between the surface reaction and gas radical reaction. This understanding is significant for the design of more effective B-based catalytic systems.

1.在B基催化剂上，ODHP反应机制的多维性质，包括表面和气相自由基反应，对整体反应网络的理解做出了重要贡献。表面反应机制涉及催化剂表面上的烷烃活化和中间体的形成，而气相自由基反应机制涉及在气相的三维空间中的反应传播。这两种机制之间的协同效应对于ODHP反应中丙烯的高活性和选择性至关重要。混合的异相-均相ODH机制，其中催化剂表面上的硼氧化物/氢氧化物相启动形成烷基自由基，这些自由基进一步在气相中反应，突出了实现表面反应和气相自由基反应之间协同作用的重要性。这种理解对于设计更有效的B基催化系统具有重要意义。
