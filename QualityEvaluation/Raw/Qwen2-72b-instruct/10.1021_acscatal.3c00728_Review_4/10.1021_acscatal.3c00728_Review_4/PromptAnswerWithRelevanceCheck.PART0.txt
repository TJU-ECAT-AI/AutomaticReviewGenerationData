[1] "Despite the significant achievements obtained regarding the mechanism of the B-based catalysts for the ODHP reaction, the whole reaction network, the detailed activation manner of alkanes, and the interplay between different intermediates are still unknown."
[2] "Therefore, the reaction occurs not only on the 1- and 2-D surface-active sites but also in the 3-D space in the gas phase."
[3] "From the spatial dimension of reactant molecular motion, we divide the reaction mechanism into two parts: surface reaction mechanism and gas radical reaction mechanism."
[4] "The effective coupling of the two processes plays an important role in realizing the high activity and high propene selectivity during ODHP."
[5] "The mixed heterogeneous-homogeneous ODH mechanism has been proposed, which can be described as the boron oxide/hydroxide phase on the surface of the catalyst acting as an initiator to form alkyl radicals, which further react in the gas phase."
[6] "Achieving the synergy of the surface reaction and gas radical reaction is of considerable significance to enhance the understanding of the ODHP reaction mechanism and to design a more effective B-based catalytic system."

1.The multidimensional nature of the ODHP reaction mechanism over B-based catalysts, encompassing both surface and gas-phase radical reactions, contributes to a more comprehensive understanding of the overall reaction network. The reaction not only occurs on the surface-active sites but also in the 3-D space in the gas phase. This division into surface reaction mechanism and gas radical reaction mechanism highlights the complexity of the reaction network and the detailed activation manner of alkanes. The effective coupling of these two processes is crucial for achieving high activity and high propene selectivity during ODHP. The mixed heterogeneous-homogeneous ODH mechanism, where the boron oxide/hydroxide phase on the surface of the catalyst acts as an initiator to form alkyl radicals that further react in the gas phase, underscores the importance of achieving synergy between the surface reaction and gas radical reaction. This understanding is significant for enhancing the design of more effective B-based catalytic systems.

1.The multidimensional nature of the ODHP reaction mechanism over B-based catalysts, which includes both surface and gas-phase radical reactions, contributes to a more comprehensive understanding of the overall reaction network. The detailed activation manner of alkanes and the interplay between different intermediates are still under investigation, indicating that there is much to learn about the complex interactions within the reaction. The reaction occurs not only on the surface-active sites but also in the 3-D space in the gas phase, highlighting the importance of considering both dimensions in the study of the reaction mechanism. The synergistic effect between the surface and gas-phase reactions is crucial for the high activity and high propene selectivity observed during the ODHP reaction. The mixed heterogeneous-homogeneous ODH mechanism, where the boron oxide/hydroxide phase on the surface of the catalyst acts as an initiator to form alkyl radicals that further react in the gas phase, is a significant finding. Achieving the synergy of the surface reaction and gas radical reaction is essential for enhancing the understanding of the ODHP reaction mechanism and for designing a more effective B-based catalytic system.

1.The multidimensional nature of the ODHP reaction mechanism over B-based catalysts, which includes both surface and gas-phase radical reactions, contributes to a more comprehensive understanding of the overall reaction network. The surface reaction mechanism involves the activation of alkanes and the formation of intermediates on the catalyst surface, while the gas radical reaction mechanism involves the propagation of reactions in the 3-D space of the gas phase. The synergistic effects between these two mechanisms are crucial for the high activity and selectivity of propene in the ODHP reaction. The mixed heterogeneous-homogeneous ODH mechanism, where the boron oxide/hydroxide phase on the catalyst surface initiates the formation of alkyl radicals that further react in the gas phase, highlights the importance of achieving synergy between the surface reaction and gas radical reaction. This understanding is significant for the design of more effective B-based catalytic systems.
