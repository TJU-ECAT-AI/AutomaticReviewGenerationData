[1] "Despite the significant achievements obtained regarding the mechanism of the B-based catalysts for the ODHP reaction, the whole reaction network, the detailed activation manner of alkanes, and the interplay between different intermediates are still unknown."
[2] "Therefore, the reaction occurs not only on the 1- and 2-D surface-active sites but also in the 3-D space in the gas phase."
[3] "In the following sections, the experimental and theoretical evidence related to the surface and gas radical reaction mechanisms will be summarized."
[4] "Furthermore, the synergistic effect between the surface and gas-phase reactions in ODHP will also be discussed."
[5] "The effective coupling of the two processes plays an important role in realizing the high activity and high propene selectivity during ODHP."
[6] "The mixed heterogeneous-homogeneous ODH mechanism has been proposed, which can be described as the boron oxide/hydroxide phase on the surface of the catalyst acting as an initiator to form alkyl radicals, which further react in the gas phase."
[7] "Achieving the synergy of the surface reaction and gas radical reaction is of considerable significance to enhance the understanding of the ODHP reaction mechanism and to design a more effective B-based catalytic system."

1.The multidimensional nature of the ODHP reaction mechanism over B-based catalysts, which includes both surface and gas-phase radical reactions, contributes to a more comprehensive understanding of the overall reaction network. The detailed activation manner of alkanes and the interplay between different intermediates are still under investigation, indicating that there is much to learn about the complex interactions within the reaction. The reaction occurs not only on the surface-active sites but also in the 3-D space in the gas phase, highlighting the importance of considering both dimensions in the study of the reaction mechanism. The synergistic effect between the surface and gas-phase reactions is crucial for the high activity and high propene selectivity observed during the ODHP reaction. The mixed heterogeneous-homogeneous ODH mechanism, where the boron oxide/hydroxide phase on the surface of the catalyst acts as an initiator to form alkyl radicals that further react in the gas phase, is a significant finding. Achieving the synergy of the surface reaction and gas radical reaction is essential for enhancing the understanding of the ODHP reaction mechanism and for designing a more effective B-based catalytic system.

1.在B基催化剂上，ODHP反应机制的多维性质，包括表面和气相自由基反应，对整体反应网络的理解做出了贡献。烷烃的详细激活方式以及不同中间体之间的相互作用仍然未知，这表明在反应的复杂相互作用研究中还有许多需要学习的地方。反应不仅发生在表面活性位点上，也发生在气相的三维空间中，这强调了在研究反应机制时考虑两个维度的重要性。表面和气相反应之间的协同效应对于在ODHP反应中观察到的高活性和高丙烯选择性至关重要。混合的异相-均相ODH机制，其中催化剂表面的硼氧化物/氢氧化物相作为引发剂形成烷基自由基，这些自由基进一步在气相中反应，是一个重要的发现。实现表面反应和气相自由基反应的协同作用对于增强对ODHP反应机制的理解和设计更有效的B基催化系统至关重要。
