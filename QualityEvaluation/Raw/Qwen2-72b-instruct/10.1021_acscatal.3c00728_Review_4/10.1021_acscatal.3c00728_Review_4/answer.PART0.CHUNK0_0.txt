[1] "Despite the significant achievements obtained regarding the mechanism of the B-based catalysts for the ODHP reaction, the whole reaction network, the detailed activation manner of alkanes, and the interplay between different intermediates are still unknown."
[2] "Therefore, the reaction occurs not only on the 1- and 2-D surface-active sites but also in the 3-D space in the gas phase."
[3] "From the spatial dimension of reactant molecular motion, we divide the reaction mechanism into two parts: surface reaction mechanism and gas radical reaction mechanism."
[4] "The effective coupling of the two processes plays an important role in realizing the high activity and high propene selectivity during ODHP."
[5] "The mixed heterogeneous-homogeneous ODH mechanism has been proposed, which can be described as the boron oxide/hydroxide phase on the surface of the catalyst acting as an initiator to form alkyl radicals, which further react in the gas phase."
[6] "Achieving the synergy of the surface reaction and gas radical reaction is of considerable significance to enhance the understanding of the ODHP reaction mechanism and to design a more effective B-based catalytic system."

1.The multidimensional nature of the ODHP reaction mechanism over B-based catalysts, encompassing both surface and gas-phase radical reactions, contributes to a more comprehensive understanding of the overall reaction network. The reaction not only occurs on the surface-active sites but also in the 3-D space in the gas phase. This division into surface reaction mechanism and gas radical reaction mechanism highlights the complexity of the reaction network and the detailed activation manner of alkanes. The effective coupling of these two processes is crucial for achieving high activity and high propene selectivity during ODHP. The mixed heterogeneous-homogeneous ODH mechanism, where the boron oxide/hydroxide phase on the surface of the catalyst acts as an initiator to form alkyl radicals that further react in the gas phase, underscores the importance of achieving synergy between the surface reaction and gas radical reaction. This understanding is significant for enhancing the design of more effective B-based catalytic systems.

1.在B基催化剂上，ODHP反应机制的多维性质，包括表面和气相自由基反应，对整体反应网络的理解做出了贡献。反应不仅发生在表面活性位点，还在气相的三维空间中发生。这种将反应机制分为表面反应机制和气相自由基反应机制的划分，突出了反应网络的复杂性和烷烃的详细激活方式。表面反应和气相自由基反应的有效耦合对于实现ODHP期间的高活性和高丙烯选择性至关重要。混合的异相-均相ODH机制，其中催化剂表面的硼氧化物/氢氧化物相作为引发剂形成烷基自由基，这些自由基进一步在气相中反应，强调了实现表面反应和气相自由基反应之间协同作用的重要性。这种理解对于增强B基催化系统的更有效设计具有重要意义。
