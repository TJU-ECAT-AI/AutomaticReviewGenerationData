1.The multidimensional nature of the ODHP reaction mechanism over B-based catalysts, which includes both surface and gas-phase radical reactions, contributes to a more comprehensive understanding of the overall reaction network. The detailed activation manner of alkanes and the interplay between different intermediates are still being explored, indicating that there is ongoing research to unravel the complexities of this mechanism.
2.The reaction occurs not only on the surface-active sites but also in the 3-D space in the gas phase, suggesting a mixed mechanism that includes both surface and gas radical reactions.
3.Experimental and theoretical evidence related to the surface and gas radical reaction mechanisms have been summarized, providing insights into the different aspects of the ODHP reaction.
4.The synergistic effect between the surface and gas-phase reactions in ODHP is a topic of discussion, highlighting the importance of understanding how these two processes interact and influence each other.
5.A mixed heterogeneous-homogeneous ODH mechanism has been proposed, where the boron oxide/hydroxide phase on the surface of the catalyst acts as an initiator to form alkyl radicals, which further react in the gas phase.
6.Achieving the synergy of the surface reaction and gas radical reaction is significant for enhancing the understanding of the ODHP reaction mechanism and for designing a more effective B-based catalytic system. This implies that optimizing catalyst performance requires a thorough understanding of both the surface and gas-phase reactions and their interplay.
