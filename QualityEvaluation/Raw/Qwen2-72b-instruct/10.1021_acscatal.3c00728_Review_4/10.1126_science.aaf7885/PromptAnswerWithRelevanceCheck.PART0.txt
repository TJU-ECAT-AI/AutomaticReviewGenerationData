Read the questions and answers provided below. First, critically assess the overall relevance of the answers provided to the set of questions asked.

If, upon your assessment, you find that the answers do not contain information that is relevant to the questions asked, stop your review process immediately and respond with a single sentence: "※※※※※※※The provided answers are not relevant to the questions.※※※※※※※". Do not provide any additional explanation or background information, only this sentence should be given as a response in case of irrelevant answers.

If, however, the answers are relevant to the questions asked, proceed to compile answers for each question according to the instructions below. Ensure to aggregate all the relevant answers from the multiple answer results provided in the document, and organize them sequentially by their order number, compiling the corresponding quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question.

If the provided answers' quotes are not differentiated by question, ensure to break them down and assign the quotes to each respective question, outputting them separately within each question's section.

To provide a comprehensive review, differentiate the responses into quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question based on the details given in the 'Answer' XML tags. Structure your review using the XML format showcased below if the answers are relevant to the questions asked:

1.The multidimensional nature of the ODHP reaction mechanism over B-based catalysts, which includes both surface and gas-phase radical reactions, contributes to a more comprehensive understanding of the overall reaction network. The synergistic effects of these reactions have implications for catalyst performance and design optimization, as they may lead to the creation of more stable and selective catalysts. The stabilization of the propyl radical by the nitroxyl radical site, due to the one-dimensional (1D) nature of the edge, avoids the creation of a highly reactive propyl radical (typical of 0D single-site catalysts) and also suppresses the overoxidation of the adsorbed species (typical of 2D surface catalysts). This results in higher olefin selectivity and improved catalyst stability.

1.B基催化剂上的ODHP反应机制的多维性质，包括表面和气相自由基反应，对整体反应网络的理解做出了更全面的贡献。这些反应的协同效应对于催化剂性能和设计优化有影响，因为它们可能导致更稳定和更选择性的催化剂的创建。由于边缘的一维（1D）性质，硝基自由基位点对丙基自由基的稳定化，避免了高度反应性的丙基自由基的产生（典型的0D单点催化剂），同时也抑制了吸附物种的过度氧化（典型的2D表面催化剂）。这导致了更高的烯烃选择性和改进的催化剂稳定性。
