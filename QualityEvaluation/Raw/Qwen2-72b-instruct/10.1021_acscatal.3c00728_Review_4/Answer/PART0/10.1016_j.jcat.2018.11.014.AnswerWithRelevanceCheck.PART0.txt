          The multidimensional nature of the ODHP reaction mechanism over B-based catalysts, encompassing both surface and gas-phase radical reactions, is not directly discussed in the literature. However, it can be inferred that the complex interplay between surface and gas-phase reactions contributes to the overall reaction network and has implications for catalyst performance and design optimization. The literature highlights the importance of BOH groups generated from BO species with the assistance of steam as catalytic activity sites, suggesting that the synergistic effects of surface and gas-phase reactions play a crucial role in the oxidative dehydrogenation of light alkanes. These synergistic effects could potentially optimize catalyst performance and design by facilitating the cleavage of CH bonds in alkanes while simultaneously shutting off pathways leading to overoxidation and CO2 formation, providing multiple pathways for the conversion of light alkanes to olefins. A comprehensive understanding of both surface and gas-phase reactions is necessary to develop more efficient and selective catalysts.

          关于B基催化剂上ODHP反应机制的多维性质，包括表面和气相自由基反应，并没有在文献中直接讨论。然而，可以推断，表面和气相反应之间的复杂相互作用对整个反应网络有贡献，并对催化剂性能和设计优化有影响。文献强调了在蒸汽的帮助下从BO物种产生的BOH基团作为催化活性位点的重要性，这表明表面和气相反应的协同效应在轻烷氧化脱氢中起着关键作用。这些协同效应可能通过促进烷烃中CH键的断裂，同时关闭导致过度氧化和CO2形成的路径，从而优化催化剂性能和设计，为轻烷烃转化为烯烃提供多种途径。需要全面理解表面和气相反应，以开发更有效和选择性的催化剂。
