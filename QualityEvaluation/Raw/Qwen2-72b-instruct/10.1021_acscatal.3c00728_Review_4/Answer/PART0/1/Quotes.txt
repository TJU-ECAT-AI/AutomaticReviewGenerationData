          [2] "Therefore, the reaction occurs not only on the 1- and 2-D surface-active sites but also in the 3-D space in the gas phase."
          [3] "From the spatial dimension of reactant molecular motion, we divide the reaction mechanism into two parts: surface reaction mechanism and gas radical reaction mechanism."
          [4] "The effective coupling of the two processes plays an important role in realizing the high activity and high propene selectivity during ODHP."
          [5] "The mixed heterogeneous-homogeneous ODH mechanism has been proposed, which can be described as the boron oxide/hydroxide phase on the surface of the catalyst acting as an initiator to form alkyl radicals, which further react in the gas phase."
          [6] "Achieving the synergy of the surface reaction and gas radical reaction is of considerable significance to enhance the understanding of the ODHP reaction mechanism and to design a more effective B-based catalytic system."

[1] "The recent discovery demonstrated that hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) and boron-containing catalysts with active oxygenated boron species could selectively catalyze the ODH reaction with only negligible CO2 formation, thus opening new avenues toward the selective cleavage of the CH bond of alkanes7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16."
          [2] "Prior studies have reported that the exceptional product distribution on h-BN catalyst is ascribed to the combination of surface-mediated formation of radicals and subsequent gaseous reactions17,18,19,20, which contrasts with the Mars-van Krevelen mechanism on traditional vanadium-based catalysts."
          [3] "However, although some experimental indications of gas-phase reactions were observed21,22, the complex radical reaction networks hindered the insights into the ODH over h-BN."
          [4] "The understanding of which species could ensure high alkane conversion and olefin selectivity would pave the way for the construction of a more efficient catalytic reaction system."
          [5] "The complex surface-gas-phase reaction involved many synergies and it is worth further investigation in the future to comprehend this system."

[1] "For hexagonal boron nitride-based (h-BN) and B2O3-based catalysts, it is gradually recognized that, in addition to surface-catalyzed pathway, gas-phase radical reactions are also the important issue during the ODHP process, which could influence the overall catalytic activity [8] ,[16] ,[17] ,[18] ,[19] ,[20] ,[21] ,[22] ,[23] ,[24] ."

          [3] "Therefore, it can be reasonably deduced that the lower reaction order of propane and catalytic activity over zeolite-based catalysts could result from the limited contribution of gas-phase reactions."
          [4] "The strengthened contribution of gas-phase reaction facilitates the activation of propane, consequently resulting in higher reaction order of propane."
          [5] "It enables the enhanced catalytic performance of embryonic borosilicate zeolite catalyst in terms of propane conversion and propylene selectivity."
          [6] "Moreover, a 1.4-order dependent on the propane partial pressure was observed, which was caused by the enhanced surface contribution catalyzed by VOx site."
          [7] "In consideration of the reaction pathways, the construction of highly exposed active boron centers and enhanced gas-phase reactions might be a feasible way to construct highly active and selective ODHP catalysts."



[1] "Now, the first direct experimental evidence of gas-phase methyl radicals (CH3.) in the ODHP reaction over boron-based catalysts is achieved by using online synchrotron vacuum ultraviolet photoionization mass spectroscopy (SVUV-PIMS), which uncovers the existence of gas-phase radical pathways."

          [3] "Propene is mainly generated on the catalyst surface from the CH activation of propane, while C2 and C1 products can be formed via both surface-mediated and gas-phase pathways."
          [4] "The drastically different product distributions observed in the h-BN and metal oxide-based catalysts imply that the reaction mechanisms are different in these two types of catalysts."
          [5] "The proposed mechanism bears similarities to other redox-poor oxides such as MgO,16 and shares their capacity for selective alkane conversions."
          [6] "Our findings provide new insights towards understanding the ODHP reaction mechanisms and pathways over boron-based catalysts and are of significance for developing highly selective catalysts for alkane ODH."
          [7] "Propene is exclusively formed from the surface reaction, while C1 and C2 products are formed via both channels."
          [8] "The integrated peak intensity of signals of various gas-phase components in the SVUV-PIMS spectra of the ODHP reaction catalyzed by BN-T-high sample was plotted as a function of temperature and shown in Figure2B."
          [9] "With the increasing of reaction temperature from 500 to 600C, there was an obvious growth of the signals for C2H4, C2H6, and HCHO, whereas the integrated ion intensities of CH3., CH4, and COx increased slowly with the reaction temperature."
          [10] "This similar growth trend of integrated ion intensities suggests that some of C1 and C2 products should be formed by the secondary gas-phase reaction of surface-generated methyl radicals."
          [11] "Meanwhile, the main product, propene, is more likely formed on the catalyst surface, since no gas-phase propyl radicals were observed."

          [9] "The combined surface and gas-phase reaction network reported herein provides a sound mechanistic framework for future studies of boron-containing materials."
          [10] "While upon first inspection the addition of a gas-phase may prove complex, we have shown that it is the gas-phase component itself that enables the outstanding product distribution observed with boron-based catalysts."
          [11] "This situation, where the surface initiates a free-radical gas-phase reaction, stands in sharp contrast with the mechanisms that have been proposed in the literature for vanadium-based catalysts."
          [12] "For the boron-initiated mechanism, a key role of the catalyst is to generate the reactive species (HOO. radicals) that activate the propane substrate in the gas phase, leading to fast radical propagation."
          [13] "A fraction of the propane reacts directly with the catalyst surface during chain initiation, playing a critical role in establishing the distribution of available propyl species in the gas phase."
          [14] "This reaction channel in turn lights off a gas-phase reaction and leads to the oxyfunctionalization of the BN surface under ODH conditions."
          [15] "We emphasize that heating BN in the presence of oxygen only does not result in surface oxidation, implying that the oxyfunctionalization goes hand-in-hand with the gas-phase radical chemistry."
          [16] "Our computational studies also highlight the complexity of this oxidation, leading to a variety of boron species with different reactivities."
