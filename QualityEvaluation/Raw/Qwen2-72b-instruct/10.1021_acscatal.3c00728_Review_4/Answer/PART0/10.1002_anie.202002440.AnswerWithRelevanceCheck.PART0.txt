          [1] "Now, the first direct experimental evidence of gas-phase methyl radicals (CH3.) in the ODHP reaction over boron-based catalysts is achieved by using online synchrotron vacuum ultraviolet photoionization mass spectroscopy (SVUV-PIMS), which uncovers the existence of gas-phase radical pathways."
          [2] "These observations provide new insights towards understanding the ODHP reaction mechanisms over boron-based catalysts."
          [3] "Propene is mainly generated on the catalyst surface from the CH activation of propane, while C2 and C1 products can be formed via both surface-mediated and gas-phase pathways."
          [4] "The drastically different product distributions observed in the h-BN and metal oxide-based catalysts imply that the reaction mechanisms are different in these two types of catalysts."
          [5] "The proposed mechanism bears similarities to other redox-poor oxides such as MgO,16 and shares their capacity for selective alkane conversions."
          [6] "Our findings provide new insights towards understanding the ODHP reaction mechanisms and pathways over boron-based catalysts and are of significance for developing highly selective catalysts for alkane ODH."
          [7] "Propene is exclusively formed from the surface reaction, while C1 and C2 products are formed via both channels."
          [8] "The integrated peak intensity of signals of various gas-phase components in the SVUV-PIMS spectra of the ODHP reaction catalyzed by BN-T-high sample was plotted as a function of temperature and shown in Figure2B."
          [9] "With the increasing of reaction temperature from 500 to 600C, there was an obvious growth of the signals for C2H4, C2H6, and HCHO, whereas the integrated ion intensities of CH3., CH4, and COx increased slowly with the reaction temperature."
          [10] "This similar growth trend of integrated ion intensities suggests that some of C1 and C2 products should be formed by the secondary gas-phase reaction of surface-generated methyl radicals."
          [11] "Meanwhile, the main product, propene, is more likely formed on the catalyst surface, since no gas-phase propyl radicals were observed."

          The multidimensional nature of the ODHP reaction mechanism over B-based catalysts, which includes both surface and gas-phase radical reactions, contributes significantly to our understanding of the overall reaction network. Direct experimental evidence of gas-phase methyl radicals using SVUV-PIMS reveals the existence of gas-phase radical pathways, providing new insights into the ODHP reaction mechanisms over boron-based catalysts. Propene is primarily formed from surface reactions involving the CH activation of propane, while C1 and C2 products can be produced through both surface-mediated and gas-phase reactions. The distinct product distributions observed in h-BN and metal oxide-based catalysts suggest that the reaction mechanisms differ between these two types of catalysts. The synergistic effects of surface and gas-phase reactions have implications for catalyst performance and design optimization, as they highlight the potential for selective alkane conversions, similar to other redox-poor oxides like MgO. These findings are crucial for developing highly selective catalysts for alkane oxidative dehydrogenation, as they offer a deeper understanding of the synergistic effects between surface and gas-phase reactions, which can be leveraged to optimize catalyst performance and design.

          在B基催化剂上，ODHP反应机制的多维性质，包括表面和气相自由基反应，对理解整个反应网络有重大贡献。使用SVUV-PIMS直接实验证据揭示了气相甲基自由基的存在，揭示了气相自由基路径，为理解在硼基催化剂上的ODHP反应机制提供了新的见解。丙烯主要通过表面反应形成，涉及丙烷的CH活化，而C1和C2产品可以通过表面介导和气相途径产生。在h-BN和金属氧化物基催化剂中观察到的明显不同的产物分布表明，这两种类型催化剂的反应机制不同。表面和气相自由基反应的协同效应对于催化剂性能和设计优化有影响，因为它们突出了选择性烷烃转化的潜力，类似于其他还原性差的氧化物，如MgO。这些发现对于开发高度选择性的烷烃氧化脱氢催化剂至关重要，因为它们提供了对表面和气相反应之间的协同效应的更深入理解，这些效应可以用来优化催化剂性能和设计。
