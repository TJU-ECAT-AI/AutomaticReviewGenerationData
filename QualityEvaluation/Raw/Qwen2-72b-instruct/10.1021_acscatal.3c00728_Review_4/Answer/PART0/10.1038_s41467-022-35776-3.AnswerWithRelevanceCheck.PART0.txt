          [1] "The recent discovery demonstrated that hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) and boron-containing catalysts with active oxygenated boron species could selectively catalyze the ODH reaction with only negligible CO2 formation, thus opening new avenues toward the selective cleavage of the CH bond of alkanes7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16."
          [2] "Prior studies have reported that the exceptional product distribution on h-BN catalyst is ascribed to the combination of surface-mediated formation of radicals and subsequent gaseous reactions17,18,19,20, which contrasts with the Mars-van Krevelen mechanism on traditional vanadium-based catalysts."
          [3] "However, although some experimental indications of gas-phase reactions were observed21,22, the complex radical reaction networks hindered the insights into the ODH over h-BN."
          [4] "The understanding of which species could ensure high alkane conversion and olefin selectivity would pave the way for the construction of a more efficient catalytic reaction system."
          [5] "The complex surface-gas-phase reaction involved many synergies and it is worth further investigation in the future to comprehend this system."

          The multidimensional nature of the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reaction mechanism over boron-based (B-based) catalysts, which includes both surface-mediated radical formation and subsequent gas-phase reactions, offers a unique pathway for the selective cleavage of the carbon-hydrogen (CH) bond in alkanes with minimal carbon dioxide (CO2) formation. This mechanism contrasts with the traditional Mars-van Krevelen mechanism observed on vanadium-based catalysts. The complex radical reaction networks in the gas phase, however, have hindered a deeper understanding of the ODHP reaction over hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN). Gaining insights into which species can ensure high alkane conversion and olefin selectivity is crucial for the design of more efficient catalytic systems. The synergistic effects between surface and gas-phase reactions in the ODHP mechanism over B-based catalysts suggest that optimizing catalyst performance requires a comprehensive understanding of the interplay between these two reaction domains. Further investigation into the synergies involved in the surface-gas-phase reaction is warranted to fully comprehend this system.

          硼基催化剂上丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)反应机制的多维性质，包括表面介导的自由基形成和随后的气相反应，为烷烃中碳氢(CH)键的有选择性断裂提供了一条独特途径，同时二氧化碳(CO2)的生成量极小。这与在钒基催化剂上观察到的传统Mars-van Krevelen机制形成对比。然而，气相中复杂的自由基反应网络阻碍了对h-BN上ODHP反应的深入了解。了解哪些物种可以确保高烷烃转化率和高烯烃选择性，对于设计更有效的催化反应系统至关重要。B基催化剂上ODHP机制中表面和气相反应之间的协同效应表明，优化催化剂性能需要全面理解这两个反应域之间的相互作用。对表面-气相反应中涉及的协同作用进行进一步研究，以充分理解这个系统是值得的。
