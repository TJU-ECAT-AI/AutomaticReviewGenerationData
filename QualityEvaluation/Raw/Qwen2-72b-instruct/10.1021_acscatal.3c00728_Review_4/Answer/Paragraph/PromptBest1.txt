This complex interplay between surface and gas-phase reactions suggests a synergistic effect that impacts catalyst performance and design optimization \[10.1016/j.cjche.2020.07.040\]. The B2O3/SiO2@HC monolithic catalyst demonstrates high propylene productivity, attributed to the efficient dispersion of B2O3 and improved mass transfer \[10.1016/j.cjche.2020.07.040\]. Balancing surface and gas-phase reactions maximizes propylene yield and minimizes CO2 formation \[10.1016/j.cjche.2020.07.040\]. The multidimensional ODHP mechanism over B-based catalysts, featuring surface-mediated radical formation and gas-phase reactions, selectively cleaves CH bonds in alkanes with minimal CO2 formation \[10.1038/s41467-022-35776-3\].

                    Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: The multidimensional nature of the ODHP reaction mechanism over B-based catalysts, integrating surface and gas-phase radical reactions, offers a comprehensive understanding of the reaction network and its implications for catalyst performance and design optimization. The synergistic effects between surface and gas-phase reactions significantly impact catalyst selectivity and activity, suggesting that both surface and gas-phase processes must be considered for optimized catalyst design. Future research endeavors might focus on developing catalysts with highly exposed active boron centers and enhanced gas-phase reactions to optimize performance and selectivity in ODHP processes. The exploration of novel B-based catalysts that can effectively manage both surface and gas-phase reactions could lead to breakthroughs in propylene productivity and selectivity, minimizing CO2 formation and enhancing the efficiency of the oxidative dehydrogenation process.
