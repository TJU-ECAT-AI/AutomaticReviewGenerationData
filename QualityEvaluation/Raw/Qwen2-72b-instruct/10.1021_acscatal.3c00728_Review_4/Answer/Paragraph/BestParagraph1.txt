The multidimensional nature of the ODHP reaction mechanism over B-based catalysts, featuring surface and gas-phase radical reactions, highlights the B[OHO(H)Si]2 structure in borosilicate zeolites as a key active center \[10.1126/science.abe7935\]. This structure effectively activates molecular oxygen and propane for dehydrogenation while hindering full boron hydrolysis. The synergistic effects of surface and gas-phase reactions suggest a complex reaction network, impacting catalyst performance and design optimization. The B2O3/SiO2@HC monolithic catalyst demonstrates high propylene productivity due to efficient dispersion of B2O3 and improved mass transfer \[10.1016/j.cjche.2020.07.040\]. Balancing surface and gas-phase reactions maximizes propylene yield and minimizes CO2 formation, highlighting the importance of catalyst design in achieving selectivity and activity. The synergistic effects provide multiple conversion pathways, and optimizing design can lead to improved performance. The first coated SiO2 layer stabilizes active boron species, while the monolithic design effectively manages gas-phase reactions, suppressing overoxidation and enhancing olefin selectivity. The multidimensional ODHP mechanism over B-based catalysts, featuring surface and gas-phase radical reactions, selectively cleaves CH bonds in alkanes with minimal CO2 formation, differing from the Mars-van Krevelen mechanism on vanadium-based catalysts \[10.1038/s41467-022-35776-3\]. Complex radical networks in the gas phase challenge deeper insights, yet understanding species for high conversion and selectivity is key for efficient catalytic systems. Synergies between surface and gas-phase reactions suggest optimizing catalyst performance requires a comprehensive approach. Further investigation is warranted to fully comprehend this system, as indicated by recent discoveries on hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) and boron-containing catalysts.

                    Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: Considering the advancements and findings discussed in the file, there lies an opportunity to explore emerging fields and innovative methodologies. Future research endeavors might focus on the development of catalysts that can more effectively balance surface and gas-phase reactions, leading to enhanced selectivity and activity. The optimization of the B[OHO(H)Si]2 structure in borosilicate zeolites for improved dehydrogenation efficiency while minimizing CO2 formation is a promising area. Additionally, the investigation of h-BN and other boron-containing materials for their unique properties in ODHP reactions could lead to the discovery of novel catalysts with superior performance. The comprehensive understanding of both surface and gas-phase reactions is crucial for the rational design of more efficient and selective catalysts. The exploration of synergistic effects between surface and gas-phase reactions could provide insights into the development of catalysts that can achieve high conversion rates while minimizing overoxidation. The optimization of catalyst design for improved performance and selectivity, considering both surface properties and gas-phase chemistry, is a critical direction for future research. The development of catalysts that can effectively manage gas-phase reactions while stabilizing active boron species could lead to significant advancements in the field of ODHP reactions.
