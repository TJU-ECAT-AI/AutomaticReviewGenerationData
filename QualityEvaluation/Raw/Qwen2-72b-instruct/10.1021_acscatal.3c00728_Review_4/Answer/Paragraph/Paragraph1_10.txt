The oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) over boron (B)-based catalysts exemplifies the intricate multidimensionality of catalytic reaction mechanisms, where both surface and gas-phase radical reactions play pivotal roles. This complexity arises from the interplay between the catalyst's surface properties and the reactive intermediates in the gas phase, leading to a synergistic effect that significantly influences catalytic performance. The surface of B-based catalysts provides active sites for the adsorption and activation of propane, while simultaneously facilitating the formation and stabilization of radical species. In the gas phase, these radicals can undergo a variety of reactions, including chain propagation and termination steps, which are crucial for the overall conversion and selectivity of the process. Understanding these mechanisms requires a comprehensive approach that integrates experimental data with theoretical models, enabling the elucidation of the detailed reaction pathways and the identification of key parameters that govern the catalytic activity and selectivity. This holistic perspective is essential for the rational design of more efficient B-based catalysts for ODHP and other similar reactions.
