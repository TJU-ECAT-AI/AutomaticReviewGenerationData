This mechanism contrasts sharply with the proposed mechanisms for vanadium-based catalysts, where surface reactions predominate. The gas-phase component of the reaction network enables the outstanding product distribution observed with boron-based catalysts, highlighting the importance of free-radical gas-phase chemistry. The oxyfunctionalization of the boron nitride (BN) surface under ODHP conditions is closely linked to the gas-phase radical chemistry, and the computational studies reveal the complexity of this oxidation, leading to a variety of boron species with different reactivities. Optimal ODHP catalysts should generate reactive H-abstracting species that favor the abstraction of secondary CH bonds in propane and not interact strongly with intermediates and products to minimize fast consecutive surface oxidation steps. These insights provide a sound mechanistic framework for future studies of boron-containing materials and reveal a general set of guidelines for the development of more selective catalysts. The multidimensional nature of the ODHP reaction mechanism over boron-based catalysts, which encompasses both surface and gas-phase radical reactions, contributes significantly to our understanding of the overall reaction network. The surface-mediated formation of radicals over metastable sites and their subsequent propagation in the gas phase are key factors in the remarkable product distribution observed. This understanding is achieved through the combination of catalytic activity measurements and quantum chemical calculations. The dynamic surface changes during the reaction benefit from computational investigations of metastable surface sites, beyond thermodynamically stable species. The importance of free-radical gas-phase chemistry and surface-mediated reactions in explaining catalyst performance is highlighted. The model suggests that propane is consumed in specific reactions, leading to a clear expression for propane consumption. Optimal ODH catalysts should generate reactive H-abstracting species that favor the abstraction of secondary CH bonds in propane and not interact strongly with intermediates and products to minimize fast consecutive surface oxidation steps. The synergistic effects of surface and gas-phase reactions have implications for catalyst performance and design optimization, as they can lead to enhanced selectivity and efficiency in the ODHP process.", "Doi": "10.1002/anie.202003695"}
