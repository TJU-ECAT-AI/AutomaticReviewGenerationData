The multidimensional nature of the ODHP reaction mechanism over B-based catalysts, encompassing both surface and gas-phase radical reactions, significantly influences the overall reaction network \[10.1126/science.abe7935\]. The synergistic effects of these reactions are crucial for understanding the network, offering multiple pathways for propane conversion to propylene \[10.1016/j.cjche.2020.07.040\]. Balancing the rates of surface and gas-phase reactions maximizes propylene yield while minimizing CO2 formation. The B2O3/SiO2@HC monolithic catalyst demonstrates high propylene productivity due to efficient dispersion of B2O3 and improved mass transfer, highlighting the importance of catalyst design in managing these reactions for optimized performance and selectivity \[10.1016/j.cjche.2020.07.040\]. The first coated SiO2 layer stabilizes active boron species, while the monolithic design effectively manages gas-phase reactions, suppressing overoxidation and enhancing olefin selectivity.

                    The multidimensional ODHP reaction mechanism over B-based catalysts, involving surface and gas-phase radical reactions, enhances understanding of the reaction network \[10.1002/cctc.201700725\]. Synergistic effects, particularly the formation of BO(H) active sites at BN edges facilitated by ethane, and hydrogen abstraction with O2, highlight the complex interplay crucial for catalyst performance. This knowledge guides the rational design of nonmetal catalysts for efficient paraffin ODHP reactions, emphasizing the control of ethane and oxygen activation for improved catalyst efficiency and olefin yields.

                    The multidimensional ODHP reaction mechanism over B-based catalysts, involving surface and gas-phase radical reactions, is crucial for understanding catalytic performance \[10.1016/j.jcat.2018.11.014\]. BOH groups, generated from BO species with steam assistance, act as catalytic activity sites, highlighting the synergistic effects of these reactions. These effects optimize catalyst performance by facilitating CH bond cleavage in alkanes while preventing overoxidation and CO2 formation, essential for efficient light alkane conversion to olefins. A comprehensive understanding of both surface and gas-phase reactions is vital for developing more selective and efficient catalysts.
                    
                    Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: The multidimensional nature of the ODHP reaction mechanism over B-based catalysts, integrating surface and gas-phase radical reactions, has significantly advanced our understanding of catalytic performance and synergistic effects. This understanding highlights the importance of controlling ethane and oxygen activation at BN edges, leading to the formation of BO(H) active sites. The complex interplay between surface and gas-phase reactions offers multiple pathways for propane conversion to propylene, maximizing propylene yield while minimizing CO2 formation. Future research endeavors might focus on developing catalysts with highly exposed active boron centers and enhanced gas-phase reactions to optimize performance and selectivity. The stabilization of active boron species and effective management of gas-phase reactions under high GHSV conditions will be crucial for suppressing overoxidation and achieving high olefin selectivity. Additionally, the design of efficient and selective catalysts for ODHP reactions could benefit from a deeper understanding of the stabilization of the propyl radical by the nitroxyl radical site, which contributes to high olefin selectivity and avoids overoxidation.
