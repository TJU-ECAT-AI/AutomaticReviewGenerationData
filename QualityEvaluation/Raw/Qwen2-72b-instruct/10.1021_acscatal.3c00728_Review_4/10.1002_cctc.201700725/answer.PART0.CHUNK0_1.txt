1.The multidimensional nature of the ODHP reaction mechanism over B-based catalysts, which includes both surface and gas-phase radical reactions, contributes to a comprehensive understanding of the overall reaction network. The synergistic effects of these reactions have significant implications for catalyst performance and design optimization, as they highlight the importance of controlling the activation of ethane and oxygen at the edges of boron nitride catalysts. The formation of BO(H) active sites, facilitated by ethane, enables the selective oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane to ethylene with high selectivity and conversion. This understanding can guide the development of more efficient and selective catalysts for the conversion of paraffins to olefins.

1.B基催化剂上的ODHP反应机制的多维性质，包括表面和气相自由基反应，对整体反应网络的理解做出了全面的贡献。这些反应的协同效应对于催化剂性能和设计优化有重大影响，因为它们强调了在硼氮化物催化剂边缘控制乙烷和氧气激活的重要性。由乙烷促进的BO(H)活性位点的形成，使乙烷选择性氧化脱氢为乙烯具有高选择性和转化率。这种理解可以指导开发更有效和选择性的催化剂，用于将石蜡转化为烯烃。
