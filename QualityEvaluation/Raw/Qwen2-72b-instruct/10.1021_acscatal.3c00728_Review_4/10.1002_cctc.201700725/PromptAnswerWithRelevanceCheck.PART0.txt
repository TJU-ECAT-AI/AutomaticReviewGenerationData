1.The multidimensional nature of the ODHP reaction mechanism over B-based catalysts, which includes both surface and gas-phase radical reactions, contributes to a comprehensive understanding of the overall reaction network. The synergistic effects of these reactions have significant implications for catalyst performance and design optimization, as they highlight the importance of controlling the activation of ethane and oxygen at the edges of boron nitride catalysts. The formation of BO(H) active sites at the BN edges by the aid of ethane, and the subsequent abstraction of a hydrogen atom from ethane with the assistance of O2, demonstrate the complex interplay between surface and gas-phase reactions. This understanding can guide the rational design of nonmetal catalysts for combustion-free paraffin ODHP reactions, potentially leading to improved catalyst performance and optimized olefin yields.

1.B基催化剂上的ODHP反应机制的多维性质，包括表面和气相自由基反应，对整体反应网络的全面理解做出了贡献。这些反应的协同效应对于催化剂性能和设计优化具有重大意义，因为它们强调了在硼氮化物催化剂边缘控制乙烷和氧气活化的重要性。在BN边缘通过乙烷辅助形成BO(H)活性位点，随后在O2的帮助下从乙烷中抽离氢原子，展示了表面和气相反应之间的复杂相互作用。这种理解可以指导非金属催化剂的合理设计，用于无燃烧的石蜡ODHP反应，可能带来改进的催化剂性能和优化的烯烃产量。

The synergistic effects of these reactions have significant implications for catalyst performance and design optimization, as they highlight the importance of controlling the activation of ethane and oxygen at the edges of boron nitride catalysts. The formation of BO(H) active sites, facilitated by ethane, enables the selective oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane to ethylene with high selectivity and conversion. This understanding can guide the development of more efficient and selective catalysts for the conversion of paraffins to olefins.

1.The multidimensional nature of the ODHP reaction mechanism over B-based catalysts, which includes both surface and gas-phase radical reactions, is not directly discussed in the provided literature. However, the literature does highlight the importance of the edge B atoms in the BN nanosheets for O2 activation and ethane dehydrogenation. The synergistic effects of these reactions could imply that the design of B-based catalysts should focus on maximizing the availability of edge sites for improved performance.
