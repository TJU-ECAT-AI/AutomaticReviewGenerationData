1.The multidimensional nature of the ODHP reaction mechanism over B-based catalysts, which includes both surface and gas-phase radical reactions, is not directly discussed in the provided literature. However, the literature does highlight the importance of the edge B atoms in the BN nanosheets for O2 activation and ethane dehydrogenation. The synergistic effects of these reactions could imply that the design of B-based catalysts should focus on maximizing the availability of edge sites for improved performance.

1.在提供的文献中，并没有直接讨论B基催化剂上ODHP反应机制的多维性质，包括表面和气相自由基反应。然而，文献确实强调了BN纳米片边缘的B原子对于O2活化和乙烷脱氢的重要性。这些反应的协同效应可能意味着B基催化剂的设计应侧重于最大化边缘位点的可用性，以提高性能。
