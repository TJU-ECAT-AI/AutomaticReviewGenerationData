1.The multidimensional nature of the ODHP reaction mechanism over B-based catalysts, which includes both surface and gas-phase radical reactions, contributes to a comprehensive understanding of the overall reaction network. The synergistic effects of these reactions have significant implications for catalyst performance and design optimization, as they highlight the importance of controlling the activation of ethane and oxygen at the edges of boron nitride catalysts. The formation of BO(H) active sites at the BN edges by the aid of ethane, and the subsequent abstraction of a hydrogen atom from ethane with the assistance of O2, demonstrate the complex interplay between surface and gas-phase reactions. This understanding can guide the development of more efficient and selective catalysts for the oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes.

1.B基催化剂上的ODHP反应机制的多维性质，包括表面和气相自由基反应，对整体反应网络的全面理解做出了贡献。这些反应的协同效应对于催化剂性能和设计优化具有重要意义，因为它们强调了在硼氮化物催化剂边缘控制乙烷和氧气活化的重要性。在BN边缘通过乙烷辅助形成BO(H)活性位点，随后在O2的帮助下从乙烷中抽氢，展示了表面和气相反应之间的复杂相互作用。这种理解可以指导开发更高效、更选择性的催化剂，用于烷烃的氧化脱氢。
