1.The multidimensional nature of the ODHP reaction mechanism over B-based catalysts, which includes both surface and gas-phase radical reactions, contributes to a deeper understanding of the overall reaction network. The synergistic effects of these reactions have significant implications for catalyst performance and design optimization, as they highlight the importance of controlling both the surface properties of the catalyst and the reaction conditions in the gas phase. This understanding can guide the development of more efficient and selective catalysts for the ODHP reaction.
