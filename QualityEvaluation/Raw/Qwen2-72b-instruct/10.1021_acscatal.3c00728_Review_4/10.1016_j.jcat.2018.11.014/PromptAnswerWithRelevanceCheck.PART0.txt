1.The multidimensional nature of the ODHP reaction mechanism over B-based catalysts, encompassing both surface and gas-phase radical reactions, is not directly discussed in the literature. However, the literature does highlight the importance of BOH groups generated from BO species with the assistance of steam as potential catalytic activity sites. The synergistic effects of surface and gas-phase reactions could potentially optimize catalyst performance by facilitating the formation of these active sites and promoting the selective cleavage of CH bonds in alkanes.

However, the literature does highlight the importance of BOH groups generated from BO species with the assistance of steam as potential catalytic activity sites. The synergistic effects of surface and gas-phase reactions could potentially optimize catalyst performance and design by facilitating the cleavage of CH bonds in alkanes while simultaneously shutting off pathways leading to overoxidation and CO2 formation.

1.The multidimensional nature of the ODHP reaction mechanism over B-based catalysts, encompassing both surface and gas-phase radical reactions, is not specifically discussed in the literature provided. However, it can be inferred that the synergistic effects of these reactions contribute to the overall reaction network by providing multiple pathways for the conversion of light alkanes to olefins. The implications for catalyst performance and design optimization are that a comprehensive understanding of both surface and gas-phase reactions is necessary to develop more efficient and selective catalysts.
