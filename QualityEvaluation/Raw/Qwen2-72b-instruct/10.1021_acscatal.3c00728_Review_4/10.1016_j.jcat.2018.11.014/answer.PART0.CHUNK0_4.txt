1.The multidimensional nature of the ODHP reaction mechanism over B-based catalysts, encompassing both surface and gas-phase radical reactions, is not specifically discussed in the literature. However, the literature does highlight the importance of BOH groups generated from BO species with the assistance of steam as potential catalytic activity sites. The synergistic effects of surface and gas-phase reactions could potentially optimize catalyst performance by facilitating the formation of these active sites and promoting the selective cleavage of CH bonds in alkanes.

1.关于B基催化剂上ODHP反应机制的多维特性，包括表面和气相自由基反应，文献中没有具体讨论。但是，文献确实强调了在蒸汽辅助下从BO物种生成的BOH基团作为潜在催化活性位点的重要性。表面和气相反应的协同效应可能通过促进这些活性位点的形成和促进烷烃中CH键的选择性断裂，从而优化催化剂性能。
