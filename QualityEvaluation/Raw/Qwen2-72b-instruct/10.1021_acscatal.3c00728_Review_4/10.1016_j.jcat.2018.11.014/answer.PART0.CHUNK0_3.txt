1.The multidimensional nature of the ODHP reaction mechanism over B-based catalysts, encompassing both surface and gas-phase radical reactions, is not specifically discussed in the literature provided. However, it can be inferred that the synergistic effects of these reactions contribute to the overall reaction network by providing multiple pathways for the conversion of light alkanes to olefins. The implications for catalyst performance and design optimization are that a comprehensive understanding of both surface and gas-phase reactions is necessary to develop more efficient and selective catalysts.

1.在提供的文献中，没有具体讨论B基催化剂上ODHP反应机制的多维性质，包括表面和气相自由基反应。然而，可以推断，这些反应的协同效应通过为轻烷烃转化为烯烃提供多种途径，对整个反应网络的贡献。这对催化剂性能和设计优化的影响是，需要全面理解表面和气相反应，以开发更有效和选择性的催化剂。
