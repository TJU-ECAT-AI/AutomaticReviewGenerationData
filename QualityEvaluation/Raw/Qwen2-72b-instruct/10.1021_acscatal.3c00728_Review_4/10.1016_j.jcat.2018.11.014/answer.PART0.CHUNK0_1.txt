1.The multidimensional nature of the ODHP reaction mechanism over B-based catalysts, encompassing both surface and gas-phase radical reactions, is not specifically discussed in the literature provided. However, it can be inferred that the complex interplay between surface and gas-phase reactions contributes to the overall reaction network and has implications for catalyst performance and design optimization. The literature highlights the importance of BOH groups generated from BO species with the assistance of steam as catalytic activity sites, suggesting that the synergistic effects of surface and gas-phase reactions play a crucial role in the oxidative dehydrogenation of light alkanes.

1.在提供的文献中，没有具体讨论B基催化剂上ODHP反应机制的多维性质，包括表面和气相自由基反应。然而，可以推断，表面和气相反应之间的复杂相互作用对整个反应网络有贡献，并对催化剂性能和设计优化有影响。文献强调了在蒸汽的帮助下从BO物种产生的BOH基团作为催化活性位点的重要性，这表明表面和气相反应的协同效应在轻烷氧化脱氢中起着关键作用。
