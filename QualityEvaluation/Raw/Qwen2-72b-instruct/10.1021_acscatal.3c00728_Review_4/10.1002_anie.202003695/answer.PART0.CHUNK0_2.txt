[1] "We combine catalytic activity measurements with quantum chemical calculations to put forward a bold new hypothesis. We argue that the remarkable product distribution can be rationalized by a combination of surface-mediated formation of radicals over metastable sites, and their sequential propagation in the gas phase."
[2] "The dynamic surface changes during ODH may benefit from computational investigations of metastable surface sites, beyond thermodynamically stable species such as BO3."
[3] "Considering the possible radical pathways involved in hBN-catalyzed ODH, we aim to gain insight into the reactions that could take place both at the surface and in the gas phase."
[4] "This readily explains why the catalyst shows no dehydrogenation activity and is only active for ODH."
[5] "The radicals generated during the ODH reaction can terminate according to two pathways. First, in a radical-radical recombination. Or in a surface termination, with one predicted route."
[6] "The role of gas-phase chemistry on ODH performance Building on the chemistry predicted to occur on the catalyst surface, we investigated the possible gas-phase reaction network."
[7] "This simple model is, to our knowledge, the first mechanistic hypothesis that can predict the experimentally observed product distribution of BOx-catalyzed ODH over a range of oxygen partial pressures."
[8] "According to this simple model, propane is consumed in Reactions, leading to the expression for the propane consumption."
[9] "This situation, where the surface initiates a free-radical gas-phase reaction, stands in sharp contrast with the mechanisms that have been proposed in the literature for vanadium-based catalysts."
[10] "We conclude that optimal ODH catalysts should 1)generate reactive H-abstracting species that favor the abstraction of secondary CH bonds in propane, and 2)not interact strongly with intermediates and products to minimize fast consecutive surface oxidation steps."

1.The multidimensional nature of the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reaction mechanism over boron-based catalysts, which encompasses both surface and gas-phase radical reactions, contributes significantly to our understanding of the overall reaction network. The combination of surface-mediated formation of radicals over metastable sites and their sequential propagation in the gas phase explains the remarkable product distribution observed. This understanding is achieved through the integration of catalytic activity measurements and quantum chemical calculations, which allows for the exploration of dynamic surface changes during the reaction, beyond thermodynamically stable species. The synergistic effects of surface and gas-phase reactions have implications for catalyst performance and design optimization, as they highlight the importance of generating reactive H-abstracting species that favor the abstraction of secondary CH bonds in propane, while minimizing strong interactions with intermediates and products to prevent fast consecutive surface oxidation steps. This knowledge can guide the development of more selective and efficient ODH catalysts.

1.硼基催化剂上丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)反应机制的多维性质，包括表面和气相自由基反应，对理解整个反应网络有重大贡献。表面在亚稳态位点形成自由基并随后在气相中顺序传播的组合解释了观察到的显著产物分布。通过催化活性测量与量子化学计算的结合，我们能够探索反应过程中表面动态变化，超越热力学稳定物种。表面和气相反应的协同效应对于催化剂性能和设计优化有重要影响，因为它们强调了生成有利于丙烷中二次CH键抽氢的活性H-抽取物种的重要性，同时最小化与中间体和产物的强烈相互作用，以防止快速连续的表面氧化步骤。这些知识可以指导更选择性和高效ODH催化剂的开发。
