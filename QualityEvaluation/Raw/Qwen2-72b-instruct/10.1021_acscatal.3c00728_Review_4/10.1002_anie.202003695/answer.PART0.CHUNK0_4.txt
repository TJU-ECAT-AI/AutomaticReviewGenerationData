[1] "We combine catalytic activity measurements with quantum chemical calculations to put forward a bold new hypothesis. We argue that the remarkable product distribution can be rationalized by a combination of surface-mediated formation of radicals over metastable sites, and their sequential propagation in the gas phase."
[2] "The dynamic surface changes during ODH may benefit from computational investigations of metastable surface sites, beyond thermodynamically stable species such as BO3."
[3] "Considering the possible radical pathways involved in hBN-catalyzed ODH, we aim to gain insight into the reactions that could take place both at the surface and in the gas phase."
[4] "This readily explains why the catalyst shows no dehydrogenation activity and is only active for ODH."
[5] "The radicals generated during the ODH reaction can terminate according to two pathways. First, in a radical-radical recombination. Or in a surface termination."
[6] "Our proposed reaction mechanism (simplified schematic depicted in Figure10) clearly highlights the importance of free-radical gas-phase chemistry as well as surface-mediated reactions in explaining catalyst performance."
[7] "According to this simple model, propane is consumed in Reactions(14)(17), leading to the expression Equation(2a) for the propane consumption."
[8] "We conclude that optimal ODH catalysts should 1)generate reactive H-abstracting species that favor the abstraction of secondary CH bonds in propane, and 2)not interact strongly with intermediates and products to minimize fast consecutive surface oxidation steps."

1.The multidimensional nature of the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reaction mechanism over boron-based catalysts, which encompasses both surface and gas-phase radical reactions, contributes significantly to our understanding of the overall reaction network. The surface-mediated formation of radicals over metastable sites and their subsequent propagation in the gas phase are key factors in the remarkable product distribution observed. This understanding is achieved through the combination of catalytic activity measurements and quantum chemical calculations. The dynamic surface changes during the reaction benefit from computational investigations of metastable surface sites, beyond thermodynamically stable species. The importance of free-radical gas-phase chemistry and surface-mediated reactions in explaining catalyst performance is highlighted. The model suggests that propane is consumed in specific reactions, leading to a clear expression for propane consumption. Optimal ODH catalysts should generate reactive H-abstracting species that favor the abstraction of secondary CH bonds in propane and not interact strongly with intermediates and products to minimize fast consecutive surface oxidation steps. The synergistic effects of surface and gas-phase reactions have implications for catalyst performance and design optimization, as they can lead to enhanced selectivity and efficiency in the ODHP process.

1.硼基催化剂上丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)反应机制的多维性质，包括表面和气相自由基反应，对理解整个反应网络有重大贡献。表面介导的在亚稳态位点形成自由基及其随后在气相中的传播是观察到的显著产物分布的关键因素。这种理解是通过催化活性测量和量子化学计算的结合实现的。反应过程中动态表面变化得益于对亚稳态表面位点的计算研究，这超出了热力学稳定物种的范畴。自由基气相化学和表面介导反应的重要性在解释催化剂性能方面被突出。该模型表明，丙烷在特定反应中被消耗，导致丙烷消耗的清晰表达。理想的ODH催化剂应该产生反应性的H-抽取物种，有利于丙烷中二次CH键的抽取，并且与中间体和产物的相互作用不强，以最小化快速连续的表面氧化步骤。表面和气相反应的协同效应对于催化剂性能和设计优化有影响，因为它们可以导致ODHP过程中的选择性和效率提高。
