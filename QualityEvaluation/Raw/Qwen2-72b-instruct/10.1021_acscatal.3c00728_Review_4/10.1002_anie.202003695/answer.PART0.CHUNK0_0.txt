[1] "We combine catalytic activity measurements with quantum chemical calculations to put forward a bold new hypothesis. We argue that the remarkable product distribution can be rationalized by a combination of surface-mediated formation of radicals over metastable sites, and their sequential propagation in the gas phase."
[2] "The dynamic surface changes during ODH may benefit from computational investigations of metastable surface sites, beyond thermodynamically stable species such as BO3."
[3] "Considering the possible radical pathways involved in hBN-catalyzed ODH, we aim to gain insight into the reactions that could take place both at the surface and in the gas phase."
[4] "This readily explains why the catalyst shows no dehydrogenation activity and is only active for ODH."
[5] "The radicals generated during the ODH reaction can terminate according to two pathways. First, in a radical-radical recombination. Or in a surface termination, with one predicted route."
[6] "Our proposed reaction mechanism (simplified schematic depicted in Figure10) clearly highlights the importance of free-radical gas-phase chemistry as well as surface-mediated reactions in explaining catalyst performance."
[7] "According to this simple model, propane is consumed in Reactions(14)(17), leading to the expression for the propane consumption."
[8] "We conclude that optimal ODH catalysts should 1)generate reactive H-abstracting species that favor the abstraction of secondary CH bonds in propane, and 2)not interact strongly with intermediates and products to minimize fast consecutive surface oxidation steps."

1.The multidimensional nature of the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reaction mechanism over boron-based catalysts, which encompasses both surface and gas-phase radical reactions, contributes significantly to our understanding of the overall reaction network. The synergy between surface-mediated radical formation over metastable sites and their subsequent propagation in the gas phase explains the unique product distribution observed with boron-based catalysts. This understanding has implications for catalyst performance and design optimization, as it suggests that optimal ODH catalysts should generate reactive H-abstracting species favoring the abstraction of secondary CH bonds in propane and should not interact strongly with intermediates and products to minimize fast consecutive surface oxidation steps. This insight guides the development of more selective catalysts by focusing on the generation of reactive species that favor secondary CH bond abstraction and minimizing interactions with intermediates and products.

1.硼基催化剂上丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)反应机制的多维性质，包括表面和气相自由基反应，对理解整个反应网络有重大贡献。表面介导的在亚稳态位点形成自由基，随后在气相中传播，解释了硼基催化剂观察到的独特产物分布。这对催化剂性能和设计优化有影响，因为它表明最佳的ODH催化剂应该生成有利于丙烷中二级CH键抽氢的活性H-抽取物种，并且不应该与中间体和产物强烈相互作用，以最小化快速连续的表面氧化步骤。这一见解通过专注于生成有利于二级CH键抽氢的活性物种，并最小化与中间体和产物的相互作用，指导了更选择性催化剂的开发。
