[1] "We conclude that optimal ODH catalysts should 1)generate reactive H-abstracting species that favor the abstraction of secondary CH bonds in propane, and 2)not interact strongly with intermediates and products to minimize fast consecutive surface oxidation steps."
[2] "The combined surface and gas-phase reaction network reported herein provides a sound mechanistic framework for future studies of boron-containing materials."
[3] "While upon first inspection the addition of a gas-phase may prove complex, we have shown that it is the gas-phase component itself that enables the outstanding product distribution observed with boron-based catalysts."
[4] "This situation, where the surface initiates a free-radical gas-phase reaction, stands in sharp contrast with the mechanisms that have been proposed in the literature for vanadium-based catalysts."
[5] "For the boron-initiated mechanism, a key role of the catalyst is to generate the reactive species (HOO. radicals) that activate the propane substrate in the gas phase, leading to fast radical propagation."
[6] "A fraction of the propane reacts directly with the catalyst surface during chain initiation, playing a critical role in establishing the distribution of available propyl species in the gas phase."
[7] "This reaction channel in turn lights off a gas-phase reaction and leads to the oxyfunctionalization of the BN surface under ODH conditions."
[8] "We emphasize that heating BN in the presence of oxygen only does not result in surface oxidation, implying that the oxyfunctionalization goes hand-in-hand with the gas-phase radical chemistry."
[9] "Our computational studies also highlight the complexity of this oxidation, leading to a variety of boron species with different reactivities."

1.The multidimensional nature of the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reaction mechanism over boron-based catalysts, which encompasses both surface and gas-phase radical reactions, contributes significantly to our understanding of the overall reaction network. The synergistic effects of these reactions have profound implications for catalyst performance and design optimization. The surface of boron-based catalysts plays a critical role in generating reactive species, such as HOO. radicals, that activate propane in the gas phase, leading to fast radical propagation. This mechanism contrasts sharply with the proposed mechanisms for vanadium-based catalysts, where surface reactions predominate. The gas-phase component of the reaction network enables the outstanding product distribution observed with boron-based catalysts, highlighting the importance of free-radical gas-phase chemistry. The oxyfunctionalization of the boron nitride (BN) surface under ODHP conditions is closely linked to the gas-phase radical chemistry, and the computational studies reveal the complexity of this oxidation, leading to a variety of boron species with different reactivities. Optimal ODHP catalysts should generate reactive H-abstracting species that favor the abstraction of secondary CH bonds in propane and not interact strongly with intermediates and products to minimize fast consecutive surface oxidation steps. These insights provide a sound mechanistic framework for future studies of boron-containing materials and reveal a general set of guidelines for the development of more selective catalysts.

1.硼基催化剂上丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)反应机制的多维性质，包括表面和气相自由基反应，对理解整个反应网络有重大贡献。这些反应的协同效应对催化剂性能和设计优化有深远影响。硼基催化剂的表面在生成活性物种(如HOO.自由基)方面起着关键作用，这些物种在气相中激活丙烷，导致快速的自由基传播。这种机制与文献中提出的钒基催化剂的机制形成鲜明对比，后者以表面反应为主。气相反应网络的加入使硼基催化剂的产物分布异常出色，突出了自由基气相化学的重要性。在ODHP条件下，硼氮化物(BN)表面的氧功能化与气相自由基化学密切相关，计算研究表明这种氧化的复杂性，导致了具有不同反应性的多种硼物种。理想的ODHP催化剂应生成活性H-提取物种，有利于丙烷中二级CH键的提取，且与中间体和产物的相互作用不强，以最小化快速连续的表面氧化步骤。这些见解为未来硼材料的研究提供了一个坚实的机制框架，并揭示了一套用于开发更选择性催化剂的通用指导原则。
