1.The multidimensional nature of the ODHP reaction mechanism over B-based catalysts, encompassing both surface and gas-phase radical reactions, is not specifically discussed in the literature provided. However, it can be inferred that the synergistic effects of these reactions contribute to the overall reaction network by providing multiple pathways for the conversion of propane to propylene. The implications for catalyst performance and design optimization are that a balance must be struck between the rates of surface and gas-phase reactions to maximize propylene yield while minimizing the formation of unwanted byproducts such as CO2.

1.在提供的文献中，没有具体讨论B基催化剂上ODHP反应机制的多维性质，包括表面和气相自由基反应。然而，可以推断，这些反应的协同效应通过为丙烷转化为丙烯提供多种途径，对整体反应网络的贡献。对催化剂性能和设计优化的影响是，必须在表面和气相反应的速率之间找到平衡，以最大限度地提高丙烯产量，同时尽量减少CO2等不希望的副产品的形成。
