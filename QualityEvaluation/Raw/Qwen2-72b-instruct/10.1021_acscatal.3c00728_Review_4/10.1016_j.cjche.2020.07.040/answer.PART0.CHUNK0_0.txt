1.The multidimensional nature of the ODHP reaction mechanism over B-based catalysts, encompassing both surface and gas-phase radical reactions, is not specifically discussed in the literature provided. However, it can be inferred that the complex interplay between surface and gas-phase reactions influences the overall reaction network. The synergistic effects of these reactions can have significant implications for catalyst performance and design optimization, potentially leading to improved selectivity and activity. The literature highlights the importance of the B2O3/SiO2@HC monolithic catalyst in achieving high propylene productivity under oxidative dehydrogenation of propane conditions, which may be attributed to the efficient dispersion and firm attachment of the catalytically active B2O3 layer on the modified SiO2@HC support, as well as the improved mass transfer brought by the honeycomb structure.

1.在提供的文献中，没有具体讨论B基催化剂上ODHP反应机制的多维性质，包括表面和气相自由基反应。然而，可以推断，表面和气相反应之间的复杂相互作用影响了整个反应网络。这些反应的协同效应可能对催化剂性能和设计优化有重大影响，可能导致选择性和活性的提高。文献强调了B2O3/SiO2@HC蜂窝状催化剂在实现高丙烯生产力方面的重要性，这可能归因于催化活性B2O3层在改性SiO2@HC支撑上的有效分散和牢固附着，以及蜂窝结构带来的质量传递的改善。
