1.The multidimensional nature of the ODHP reaction mechanism over B-based catalysts, encompassing both surface and gas-phase radical reactions, is not specifically discussed in the literature provided. However, it can be inferred that the complex interplay between surface and gas-phase reactions is crucial for understanding the overall reaction network. The synergistic effects of these reactions have implications for catalyst performance and design optimization, as they can influence the selectivity and activity of the catalyst. For instance, the literature highlights the importance of the first coated SiO2 layer in stabilizing the active boron species, which could be related to the surface reactions. The high propylene productivity achieved under high gas hourly space velocity (GHSV) conditions suggests that the gas-phase reactions are also effectively managed by the monolithic catalyst design, leading to suppressed overoxidation and high olefin selectivity.

1.在提供的文献中，没有具体讨论B基催化剂上ODHP反应机制的多维性质，包括表面和气相自由基反应。然而，可以推断出表面和气相反应之间的复杂相互作用对于理解整个反应网络至关重要。这些反应的协同效应对于催化剂性能和设计优化有影响，因为它们可以影响催化剂的选择性和活性。例如，文献强调了第一层涂覆的SiO2在稳定活性硼物种方面的重要性，这可能与表面反应有关。在高气体小时空间速度（GHSV）条件下实现的高丙烯生产力表明，通过单体催化剂设计，气相反应也被有效地管理，导致过氧化作用被抑制，选择性高。
