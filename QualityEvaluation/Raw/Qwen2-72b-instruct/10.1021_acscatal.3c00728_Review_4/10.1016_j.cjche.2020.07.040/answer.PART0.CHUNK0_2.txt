1.The multidimensional nature of the ODHP reaction mechanism over B-based catalysts, encompassing both surface and gas-phase radical reactions, is not specifically discussed in the literature provided. However, it can be inferred that the complex interplay between surface and gas-phase reactions is crucial for understanding the overall reaction network. The synergistic effects of these reactions have implications for catalyst performance and design optimization, as they can influence the selectivity and activity of the catalyst. Optimizing the catalyst design to balance the contributions of surface and gas-phase reactions could lead to improved performance in terms of propylene productivity and selectivity.
