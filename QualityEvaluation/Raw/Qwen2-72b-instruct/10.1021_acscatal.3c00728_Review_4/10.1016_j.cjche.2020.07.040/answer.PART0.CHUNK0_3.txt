1.The multidimensional nature of the ODHP reaction mechanism over B-based catalysts, encompassing both surface and gas-phase radical reactions, is not specifically discussed in the literature provided. However, it can be inferred that the synergistic effects of these reactions contribute to the overall reaction network by providing multiple pathways for the conversion of propane to propylene. The implications for catalyst performance and design optimization are that a balance must be struck between the surface and gas-phase reactions to maximize propylene selectivity and minimize over-oxidation to CO2. The design of the B2O3/SiO2@HC catalyst, with its high surface area and optimized B2O3 loading, is an example of how these considerations can be addressed to achieve high propylene productivity.

1.在提供的文献中，没有具体讨论B基催化剂上ODHP反应机制的多维性质，包括表面和气相自由基反应。然而，可以推断，这些反应的协同效应通过为丙烷转化为丙烯提供多种途径，对整个反应网络的贡献。对催化剂性能和设计优化的影响是，必须在表面和气相反应之间找到平衡，以最大限度地提高丙烯的选择性，同时最小化氧化为CO2。B2O3/SiO2@HC催化剂的设计，具有高表面积和优化的B2O3负载，是通过这些考虑因素来实现高丙烯生产力的一个例子。
