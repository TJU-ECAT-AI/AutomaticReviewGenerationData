1. The multidimensional nature of the ODHP reaction mechanism over B-based catalysts, which includes both surface and gas-phase radical reactions, plays a crucial role in understanding the overall reaction network. The synergistic effects of these reactions have significant implications for catalyst performance and design optimization. However, without specific details from the literature, it's impossible to provide an exact quote or a detailed explanation. Typically, the interplay between surface and gas-phase reactions can lead to enhanced catalytic activity, selectivity, and stability. Understanding these interactions is essential for the rational design of more efficient catalysts. The optimization of catalyst design based on this knowledge can lead to improved industrial processes, such as the production of high-value chemicals and fuels.
