[1] "The recent discovery demonstrated that hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) and boron-containing catalysts with active oxygenated boron species could selectively catalyze the ODH reaction with only negligible CO2 formation, thus opening new avenues toward the selective cleavage of the CH bond of alkanes7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16."
[2] "Prior studies have reported that the exceptional product distribution on h-BN catalyst is ascribed to the combination of surface-mediated formation of radicals and subsequent gaseous reactions17,18,19,20, which contrasts with the Mars-van Krevelen mechanism on traditional vanadium-based catalysts."
[3] "However, although some experimental indications of gas-phase reactions were observed21,22, the complex radical reaction networks hindered the insights into the ODH over h-BN."
[4] "The understanding of which species could ensure high alkane conversion and olefin selectivity would pave the way for the construction of a more efficient catalytic reaction system."
[5] "The complex surface-gas-phase reaction involved many synergies and it is worth further investigation in the future to comprehend this system."

1.The multidimensional nature of the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reaction mechanism over boron-based catalysts, which includes both surface-mediated radical formation and subsequent gas-phase reactions, provides a unique pathway for the selective cleavage of the CH bond in alkanes with minimal CO2 formation. This contrasts with the Mars-van Krevelen mechanism observed on traditional vanadium-based catalysts. The complex radical reaction networks, however, have hindered a full understanding of the ODHP over hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN). Gaining insights into which species can ensure high alkane conversion and olefin selectivity will facilitate the design of more efficient catalytic systems. The synergistic effects between surface and gas-phase reactions suggest that optimizing catalyst performance requires a comprehensive understanding of the entire reaction network, including the interactions between different reactive species.

1.硼基催化剂上氧化脱氢丙烷（ODHP）反应机制的多维性质，包括表面介导的自由基形成和随后的气相反应，为烷烃中CH键的有选择性断裂提供了一条独特的途径，同时CO2的生成量极小。这与传统钒基催化剂上的Mars-van Krevelen机制形成对比。然而，复杂的自由基反应网络阻碍了对h-BN上ODHP的全面理解。了解哪些物种可以确保高烷烃转化率和高烯烃选择性，将为构建更有效的催化反应系统铺平道路。表面和气相反应之间的协同效应表明，优化催化剂性能需要全面理解整个反应网络，包括不同反应物种之间的相互作用。
