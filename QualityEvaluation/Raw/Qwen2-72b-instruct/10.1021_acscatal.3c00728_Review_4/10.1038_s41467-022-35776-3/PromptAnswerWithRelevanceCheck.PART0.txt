[1] "The recent discovery demonstrated that hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) and boron-containing catalysts with active oxygenated boron species could selectively catalyze the ODH reaction with only negligible CO2 formation, thus opening new avenues toward the selective cleavage of the CH bond of alkanes7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16."
[2] "Prior studies have reported that the exceptional product distribution on h-BN catalyst is ascribed to the combination of surface-mediated formation of radicals and subsequent gaseous reactions17,18,19,20, which contrasts with the Mars-van Krevelen mechanism on traditional vanadium-based catalysts."
[3] "However, although some experimental indications of gas-phase reactions were observed21,22, the complex radical reaction networks hindered the insights into the ODH over h-BN."
[4] "The understanding of which species could ensure high alkane conversion and olefin selectivity would pave the way for the construction of a more efficient catalytic reaction system."
[5] "The complex surface-gas-phase reaction involved many synergies and it is worth further investigation in the future to comprehend this system."

1.The multidimensional nature of the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reaction mechanism over boron-based catalysts, which includes both surface-mediated radical formation and subsequent gas-phase reactions, offers a unique pathway for the selective cleavage of the CH bond in alkanes. This mechanism contrasts with the Mars-van Krevelen mechanism observed on traditional vanadium-based catalysts. The complex radical reaction networks in the gas phase, however, have hindered a full understanding of the ODH process over hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN). Gaining insights into which species can ensure high alkane conversion and olefin selectivity will facilitate the design of more efficient catalytic systems. The synergistic effects between surface and gas-phase reactions in the ODHP mechanism suggest that optimizing catalyst performance requires a comprehensive understanding of the entire reaction network, including the interplay between surface and gas-phase reactions. This understanding will be crucial for the future development and optimization of boron-based catalysts for the ODHP reaction.

1.硼基催化剂上丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)反应机制的多维性质，包括表面介导的自由基形成和随后的气相反应，为烷烃中CH键的有选择性断裂提供了一条独特的途径。这一机制与传统钒基催化剂上的Mars-van Krevelen机制形成对比。然而，气相中复杂的自由基反应网络阻碍了对h-BN上ODH过程的全面理解。深入了解哪些物种可以确保高烷烃转化率和高烯烃选择性，将有助于设计更有效的催化反应系统。ODHP机制中表面和气相反应之间的协同效应表明，优化催化剂性能需要对整个反应网络有全面的理解，包括表面和气相反应之间的相互作用。这种理解对于未来硼基催化剂在ODHP反应中的开发和优化至关重要。

1.The multidimensional nature of the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reaction mechanism over boron-based (B-based) catalysts, which includes both surface-mediated radical formation and subsequent gas-phase reactions, offers a unique pathway for the selective cleavage of the carbon-hydrogen (CH) bond in alkanes with minimal carbon dioxide (CO2) formation. This contrasts with traditional vanadium-based catalysts that follow the Mars-van Krevelen mechanism. The complex radical reaction networks in gas-phase reactions have hindered a deeper understanding of the ODHP over hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN). Gaining insights into which species can ensure high alkane conversion and olefin selectivity will facilitate the design of more efficient catalytic systems. The synergistic effects between surface and gas-phase reactions in the complex surface-gas-phase reaction system warrant further investigation to fully comprehend the system.
