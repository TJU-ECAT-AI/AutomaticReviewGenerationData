[1] "The recent discovery demonstrated that hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) and boron-containing catalysts with active oxygenated boron species could selectively catalyze the ODH reaction with only negligible CO2 formation, thus opening new avenues toward the selective cleavage of the CH bond of alkanes7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16."
[2] "Prior studies have reported that the exceptional product distribution on h-BN catalyst is ascribed to the combination of surface-mediated formation of radicals and subsequent gaseous reactions17,18,19,20, which contrasts with the Mars-van Krevelen mechanism on traditional vanadium-based catalysts."
[3] "However, although some experimental indications of gas-phase reactions were observed21,22, the complex radical reaction networks hindered the insights into the ODH over h-BN."
[4] "The understanding of which species could ensure high alkane conversion and olefin selectivity would pave the way for the construction of a more efficient catalytic reaction system."
[5] "The complex surface-gas-phase reaction involved many synergies and it is worth further investigation in the future to comprehend this system."

1.The multidimensional nature of the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reaction mechanism over boron-based catalysts, which includes both surface-mediated radical formation and subsequent gas-phase reactions, offers a unique pathway for the selective cleavage of the CH bond in alkanes. This mechanism contrasts with the Mars-van Krevelen mechanism observed on traditional vanadium-based catalysts. The complex radical reaction networks in the gas phase, however, have hindered a full understanding of the ODH process over hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN). Gaining insights into which species can ensure high alkane conversion and olefin selectivity will facilitate the design of more efficient catalytic systems. The synergistic effects between surface and gas-phase reactions in the ODHP mechanism suggest that optimizing catalyst performance requires a comprehensive understanding of the entire reaction network, including the interplay between surface and gas-phase reactions. This understanding will be crucial for the future development and optimization of boron-based catalysts for the ODHP reaction.
