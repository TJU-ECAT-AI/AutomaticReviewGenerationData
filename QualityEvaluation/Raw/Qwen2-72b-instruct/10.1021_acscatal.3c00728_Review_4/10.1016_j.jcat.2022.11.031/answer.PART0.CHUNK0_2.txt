[1] "For hexagonal boron nitride-based (h-BN) and B2O3-based catalysts, it is gradually recognized that, in addition to surface-catalyzed pathway, gas-phase radical reactions are also the important issue during the ODHP process, which could influence the overall catalytic activity [8] ,[16] ,[17] ,[18] ,[19] ,[20] ,[21] ,[22] ,[23] ,[24] ."
[2] "Wu lately reported the improvement of ODHP activity via the gas-phase radical chemistry over VOx-modified BN catalyst, evidenced by the formation of NO according to the observation of synchrotron vacuum ultraviolet photoionization mass spectroscopy (SVUV-PIMS) [25] ."
[3] "Moreover, a 1.4-order dependent on the propane partial pressure was observed, which was caused by the enhanced surface contribution catalyzed by VOx site."
[4] "Therefore, it can be reasonably deduced that the lower reaction order of propane and catalytic activity over zeolite-based catalysts could result from the limited contribution of gas-phase reactions."
[5] "In consideration of the reaction pathways, the construction of highly exposed active boron centers and enhanced gas-phase reactions might be a feasible way to construct highly active and selective ODHP catalysts."

1.The multidimensional nature of the ODHP reaction mechanism over B-based catalysts, encompassing both surface and gas-phase radical reactions, contributes to our understanding of the overall reaction network by highlighting the importance of gas-phase radical reactions in addition to surface-catalyzed pathways. The synergistic effects of these reactions have implications for catalyst performance and design optimization, as evidenced by the improvement of ODHP activity via gas-phase radical chemistry over VOx-modified BN catalysts. The observation of a 1.4-order dependence on propane partial pressure, caused by enhanced surface contribution catalyzed by VOx sites, suggests that the lower reaction order of propane and catalytic activity over zeolite-based catalysts could result from the limited contribution of gas-phase reactions. Therefore, the construction of highly exposed active boron centers and enhanced gas-phase reactions might be a feasible way to construct highly active and selective ODHP catalysts.

1.在B基催化剂上，ODHP反应机制的多维性质，包括表面和气相自由基反应，通过强调气相自由基反应的重要性，除了表面催化的途径外，对整体反应网络的理解做出了贡献。这些反应的协同效应对于催化剂性能和设计优化有影响，正如VOx改性BN催化剂通过气相自由基化学改善ODHP活性所证明的那样。观察到的对丙烷分压的1.4阶依赖性，是由VOx位点催化增强的表面贡献引起的，表明在沸石基催化剂上，丙烷的较低反应阶和催化活性可能是由于气相反应的贡献有限。因此，构建高度暴露的活性硼中心和增强的气相反应可能是一种可行的方法，以构建高活性和选择性的ODHP催化剂。
