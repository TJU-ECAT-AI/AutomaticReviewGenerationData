[1] "For hexagonal boron nitride-based (h-BN) and B2O3-based catalysts, it is gradually recognized that, in addition to surface-catalyzed pathway, gas-phase radical reactions are also the important issue during the ODHP process, which could influence the overall catalytic activity [8] ,[16] ,[17] ,[18] ,[19] ,[20] ,[21] ,[22] ,[23] ,[24] ."
[2] "Therefore, it can be reasonably deduced that the lower reaction order of propane and catalytic activity over zeolite-based catalysts could result from the limited contribution of gas-phase reactions."
[3] "In consideration of the reaction pathways, the construction of highly exposed active boron centers and enhanced gas-phase reactions might be a feasible way to construct highly active and selective ODHP catalysts."

1.The multidimensional nature of the ODHP reaction mechanism over B-based catalysts, encompassing both surface and gas-phase radical reactions, is gradually recognized as an important factor influencing the overall catalytic activity. The limited contribution of gas-phase reactions could result in lower reaction order of propane and catalytic activity over zeolite-based catalysts. The construction of highly exposed active boron centers and enhanced gas-phase reactions is a feasible way to construct highly active and selective ODHP catalysts.

1.在B基催化剂上，ODHP反应机制的多维性质，包括表面和气相自由基反应，逐渐被认识为影响整体催化活性的重要因素。气相反应的有限贡献可能导致沸石基催化剂上丙烷反应级数和催化活性降低。构建高度暴露的活性硼中心和增强的气相反应是一种可行的方法，用于构建高活性和选择性的ODHP催化剂。
