[1] "For hexagonal boron nitride-based (h-BN) and B2O3-based catalysts, it is gradually recognized that, in addition to surface-catalyzed pathway, gas-phase radical reactions are also the important issue during the ODHP process, which could influence the overall catalytic activity [8] ,[16] ,[17] ,[18] ,[19] ,[20] ,[21] ,[22] ,[23] ,[24] ."
[2] "Wu lately reported the improvement of ODHP activity via the gas-phase radical chemistry over VOx-modified BN catalyst, evidenced by the formation of NO according to the observation of synchrotron vacuum ultraviolet photoionization mass spectroscopy (SVUV-PIMS) [25] ."
[3] "Therefore, it can be reasonably deduced that the lower reaction order of propane and catalytic activity over zeolite-based catalysts could result from the limited contribution of gas-phase reactions."
[4] "The strengthened contribution of gas-phase reaction facilitates the activation of propane, consequently resulting in higher reaction order of propane."
[5] "It enables the enhanced catalytic performance of embryonic borosilicate zeolite catalyst in terms of propane conversion and propylene selectivity."

1.The multidimensional nature of the ODHP reaction mechanism over B-based catalysts, encompassing both surface and gas-phase radical reactions, contributes to our understanding of the overall reaction network by highlighting the importance of gas-phase radical reactions in addition to surface-catalyzed pathways. The synergistic effects of these reactions have implications for catalyst performance and design optimization, as evidenced by the improvement of ODHP activity via gas-phase radical chemistry over VOx-modified BN catalysts. The limited contribution of gas-phase reactions could result in lower reaction order of propane and catalytic activity over zeolite-based catalysts. The strengthened contribution of gas-phase reaction facilitates the activation of propane, leading to higher reaction order of propane and enhanced catalytic performance of embryonic borosilicate zeolite catalyst in terms of propane conversion and propylene selectivity.

1.B基催化剂上ODHP反应机制的多维性质，包括表面和气相自由基反应，通过强调气相自由基反应的重要性，除了表面催化的途径外，对整体反应网络的理解做出了贡献。这些反应的协同效应对于催化剂性能和设计优化有影响，正如VOx改性的BN催化剂上通过气相自由基化学改善ODHP活性所证明的那样。气相反应的有限贡献可能导致较低的丙烷反应级数和沸石基催化剂的催化活性。气相反应的加强贡献促进了丙烷的活化，导致丙烷的反应级数更高，以及在丙烷转化率和丙烯选择性方面提高了胚胎硼硅酸盐沸石催化剂的催化性能。
