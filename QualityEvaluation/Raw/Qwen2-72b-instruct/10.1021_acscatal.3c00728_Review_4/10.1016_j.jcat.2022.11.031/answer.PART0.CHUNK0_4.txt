[1] "For hexagonal boron nitride-based (h-BN) and B2O3-based catalysts, it is gradually recognized that, in addition to surface-catalyzed pathway, gas-phase radical reactions are also the important issue during the ODHP process, which could influence the overall catalytic activity [8] ,[16] ,[17] ,[18] ,[19] ,[20] ,[21] ,[22] ,[23] ,[24] ."
[2] "Therefore, it can be reasonably deduced that the lower reaction order of propane and catalytic activity over zeolite-based catalysts could result from the limited contribution of gas-phase reactions."
[3] "In consideration of the reaction pathways, the construction of highly exposed active boron centers and enhanced gas-phase reactions might be a feasible way to construct highly active and selective ODHP catalysts."

1.The multidimensional nature of the ODHP reaction mechanism over B-based catalysts, which includes both surface-catalyzed pathways and gas-phase radical reactions, is crucial for understanding the overall reaction network. The gas-phase radical reactions are increasingly recognized as an important factor in the ODHP process, which can significantly influence the overall catalytic activity. The lower reaction order of propane and catalytic activity over zeolite-based catalysts may be attributed to the limited contribution of gas-phase reactions. This understanding suggests that constructing highly exposed active boron centers and enhancing gas-phase reactions could be a feasible strategy for developing highly active and selective ODHP catalysts, which has significant implications for catalyst performance and design optimization.

1.在B基催化剂上，ODHP反应机制的多维性质，包括表面催化路径和气相自由基反应，对于理解整个反应网络至关重要。气相自由基反应正逐渐被认识为ODHP过程中一个重要的因素，可以显著影响整体催化活性。在沸石基催化剂上，丙烷的较低反应级数和催化活性可能归因于气相反应的有限贡献。这种理解表明，构建高度暴露的活性硼中心和增强气相反应可能是一种可行的策略，用于开发高活性和选择性的ODHP催化剂，这对催化剂性能和设计优化具有重要意义。
