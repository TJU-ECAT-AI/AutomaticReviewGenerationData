[1] "For hexagonal boron nitride-based (h-BN) and B2O3-based catalysts, it is gradually recognized that, in addition to surface-catalyzed pathway, gas-phase radical reactions are also the important issue during the ODHP process, which could influence the overall catalytic activity [8] ,[16] ,[17] ,[18] ,[19] ,[20] ,[21] ,[22] ,[23] ,[24] ."
[2] "Therefore, it can be reasonably deduced that the lower reaction order of propane and catalytic activity over zeolite-based catalysts could result from the limited contribution of gas-phase reactions."
[3] "In consideration of the reaction pathways, the construction of highly exposed active boron centers and enhanced gas-phase reactions might be a feasible way to construct highly active and selective ODHP catalysts."

1.B基催化剂上ODHP反应机制的多维性质，包括表面和气相自由基反应，通过强调气相自由基反应的重要性，除了表面催化的途径外，对整体反应网络的理解做出了贡献。这些反应的协同效应对于催化剂性能和设计优化有影响，正如VOx改性的BN催化剂上通过气相自由基化学改善ODHP活性所证明的那样。气相反应的有限贡献可能导致较低的丙烷反应级数和沸石基催化剂的催化活性。气相反应的加强贡献促进了丙烷的活化，导致丙烷的反应级数更高，以及在丙烷转化率和丙烯选择性方面提高了胚胎硼硅酸盐沸石催化剂的催化性能。
