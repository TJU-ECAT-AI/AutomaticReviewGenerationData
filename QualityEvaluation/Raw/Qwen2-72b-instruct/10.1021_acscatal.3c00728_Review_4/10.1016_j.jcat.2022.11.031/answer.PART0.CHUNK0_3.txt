[1] "For hexagonal boron nitride-based (h-BN) and B2O3-based catalysts, it is gradually recognized that, in addition to surface-catalyzed pathway, gas-phase radical reactions are also the important issue during the ODHP process, which could influence the overall catalytic activity [8] ,[16] ,[17] ,[18] ,[19] ,[20] ,[21] ,[22] ,[23] ,[24] ."
[2] "Therefore, it can be reasonably deduced that the lower reaction order of propane and catalytic activity over zeolite-based catalysts could result from the limited contribution of gas-phase reactions."
[3] "In consideration of the reaction pathways, the construction of highly exposed active boron centers and enhanced gas-phase reactions might be a feasible way to construct highly active and selective ODHP catalysts."

1.The multidimensional nature of the ODHP reaction mechanism over B-based catalysts, which includes both surface-catalyzed pathways and gas-phase radical reactions, is crucial for understanding the overall reaction network. The recognition of the importance of gas-phase radical reactions in the ODHP process has implications for the overall catalytic activity. The lower reaction order of propane and catalytic activity over zeolite-based catalysts could be attributed to the limited contribution of gas-phase reactions. This understanding suggests that the construction of highly exposed active boron centers and the enhancement of gas-phase reactions could lead to the development of highly active and selective ODHP catalysts.

1.在B基催化剂上，ODHP反应机制的多维性质，包括表面催化路径和气相自由基反应，对于理解整个反应网络至关重要。认识到气相自由基反应在ODHP过程中的重要性对整体催化活性有影响。在沸石基催化剂上，丙烷的较低反应级数和催化活性可能是由于气相反应的贡献有限。这种理解表明，构建高度暴露的活性硼中心和增强气相反应可能有助于开发高活性和选择性的ODHP催化剂。
