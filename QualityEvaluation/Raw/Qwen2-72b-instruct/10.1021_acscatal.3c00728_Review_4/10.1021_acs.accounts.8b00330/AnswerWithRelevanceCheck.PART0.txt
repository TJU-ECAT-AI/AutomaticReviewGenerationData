          The multidimensional nature of the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reaction mechanism over B-based catalysts, which involves both surface and gas-phase radical reactions, contributes to a more comprehensive understanding of the overall reaction network. The synergistic effects of these reactions have implications for catalyst performance and design optimization, as they can influence the selectivity and activity of the catalyst. By understanding the interplay between surface and gas-phase reactions, researchers can develop more efficient catalysts that maximize the production of desired products while minimizing the formation of undesired byproducts. The multidimensional nature of the ODHP reaction mechanism over B-based catalysts, encompassing both surface and gas-phase radical reactions, contributes to our understanding of the overall reaction network by highlighting the complexity and interconnectivity of the various reaction pathways. The synergistic effects of these reactions have implications for catalyst performance and design optimization, as they suggest that both surface and gas-phase processes must be considered to achieve high selectivity and efficiency. Optimizing catalysts for these reactions may require a balance between promoting surface reactions that favor olefin formation and controlling gas-phase reactions to minimize overoxidation.
