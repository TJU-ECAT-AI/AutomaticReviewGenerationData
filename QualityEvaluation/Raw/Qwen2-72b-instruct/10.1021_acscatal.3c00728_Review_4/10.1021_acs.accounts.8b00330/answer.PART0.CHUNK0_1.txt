1.The multidimensional nature of the ODHP reaction mechanism over B-based catalysts, encompassing both surface and gas-phase radical reactions, contributes to our understanding of the overall reaction network by highlighting the complexity and interconnectivity of the various reaction pathways. The synergistic effects of these reactions have implications for catalyst performance and design optimization, as they suggest that both surface and gas-phase processes must be considered to achieve high selectivity and efficiency. Optimizing catalysts for these reactions may require a balance between promoting surface reactions that favor olefin formation and controlling gas-phase reactions to minimize overoxidation.
