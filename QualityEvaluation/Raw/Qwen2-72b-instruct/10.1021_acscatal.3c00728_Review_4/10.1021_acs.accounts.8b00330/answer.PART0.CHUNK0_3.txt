1.The multidimensional nature of the ODHP reaction mechanism over B-based catalysts, encompassing both surface and gas-phase radical reactions, contributes to our understanding of the overall reaction network by highlighting the complexity and interplay of various reaction pathways. The synergistic effects of these pathways have implications for catalyst performance and design optimization, as they suggest that both surface properties and gas-phase chemistry need to be considered for the development of more efficient and selective catalysts.
