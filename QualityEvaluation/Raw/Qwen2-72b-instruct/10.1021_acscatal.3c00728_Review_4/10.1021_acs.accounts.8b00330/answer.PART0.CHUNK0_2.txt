1.The multidimensional nature of the ODHP reaction mechanism over B-based catalysts, encompassing both surface and gas-phase radical reactions, contributes to our understanding of the overall reaction network by highlighting the complexity and interconnectivity of the various reaction pathways. The synergistic effects of these pathways have significant implications for catalyst performance and design optimization, as they suggest that both surface and gas-phase reactions must be considered to fully understand and control the selectivity and activity of the catalyst. By optimizing the catalyst to facilitate the desired radical reactions while minimizing undesired side reactions, researchers can improve the efficiency and selectivity of the oxidative dehydrogenation process.
