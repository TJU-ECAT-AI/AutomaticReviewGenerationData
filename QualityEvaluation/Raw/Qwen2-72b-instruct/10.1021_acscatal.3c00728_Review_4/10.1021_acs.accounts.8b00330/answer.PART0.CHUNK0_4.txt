1.The multidimensional nature of the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reaction mechanism over B-based catalysts, which encompasses both surface and gas-phase radical reactions, contributes to a more comprehensive understanding of the overall reaction network. The synergistic effects of these reactions have implications for catalyst performance and design optimization, as they may influence the selectivity towards desired products and the stability of the catalyst under reaction conditions. However, the literature does not provide specific details on how these synergistic effects contribute to catalyst performance and design optimization.
