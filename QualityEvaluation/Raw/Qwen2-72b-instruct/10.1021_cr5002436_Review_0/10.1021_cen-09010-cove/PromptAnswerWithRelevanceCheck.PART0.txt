Read the questions and answers provided below. First, critically assess the overall relevance of the answers provided to the set of questions asked.

If, upon your assessment, you find that the answers do not contain information that is relevant to the questions asked, stop your review process immediately and respond with a single sentence: "※※※※※※※The provided answers are not relevant to the questions.※※※※※※※". Do not provide any additional explanation or background information, only this sentence should be given as a response in case of irrelevant answers.

If, however, the answers are relevant to the questions asked, proceed to compile answers for each question according to the instructions below. Ensure to aggregate all the relevant answers from the multiple answer results provided in the document, and organize them sequentially by their order number, compiling the corresponding quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question.

If the provided answers' quotes are not differentiated by question, ensure to break them down and assign the quotes to each respective question, outputting them separately within each question's section.

To provide a comprehensive review, differentiate the responses into quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question based on the details given in the 'Answer' XML tags. Structure your review using the XML format showcased below if the answers are relevant to the questions asked:

The document does not provide specific information on how light olefins such as propylene and ethylene contribute to the chemical industry in terms of their applications and market trends. However, it does mention that North American petrochemical companies are investing heavily in new ethylene and derivatives production facilities due to the low cost of natural gas liquids, particularly ethane, which is used as a feedstock for ethylene production. The document also notes that the oversupply of ethane from shale gas drilling has led to a significant drop in prices, making it more cost-effective for petrochemical companies to produce ethylene and other derivatives. The document does not provide details on the key production methods and thermodynamic challenges associated with the synthesis of light olefins, particularly in relation to temperature, pressure, and alkane chain length effects.

该文件没有提供轻烯烃如丙烯和乙烯如何在应用和市场趋势方面对化工行业做出贡献的具体信息。但是，它确实提到北美石化公司正在大量投资新建乙烯及其衍生物生产设施，因为天然气液体（尤其是作为乙烯生产原料的乙烷）的低成本。文件还指出，页岩气钻探导致的乙烷过剩供应导致价格大幅下跌，使得石化公司生产乙烯和其他衍生物更具成本效益。该文件没有提供与温度、压力和烷链长度效应相关的轻烯烃合成的关键生产方法和热力学挑战的详细信息。
