The document does not provide specific information on how light olefins such as propylene and ethylene contribute to the chemical industry in terms of their applications and market trends. However, it does mention that North American petrochemical companies are investing heavily in new ethylene and derivatives production facilities due to the low cost of natural gas liquids, particularly ethane, which is used as a feedstock for ethylene production. The document also notes that the oversupply of ethane from shale gas drilling has led to a significant drop in prices, making it more cost-effective for petrochemical companies to produce ethylene and other derivatives. The document does not provide details on the key production methods and thermodynamic challenges associated with the synthesis of light olefins, particularly in relation to temperature, pressure, and alkane chain length effects.
