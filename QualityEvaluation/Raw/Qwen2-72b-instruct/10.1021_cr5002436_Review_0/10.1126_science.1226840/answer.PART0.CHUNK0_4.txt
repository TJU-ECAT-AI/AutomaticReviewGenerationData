[1] "Process chemistry—including free-radical routes or catalytic partial oxidation—already allows a fraction of the heavier alkanes in natural gas (ethane, propane, and butane) to be converted into more-valuable chemical products."

[2] "A high yield of ethylene and propylene can be achieved under properly selected reaction conditions when the primary feed is ethane; but steam cracking still produces a mixture of olefin products along with other hydrocarbons and H2."

[3] "Steam reforming is costly; it requires high operating pressures and temperatures (15 to 40 atm, 700 to 1000°C) in expensive reactors with heat transfer and coke management challenges."

[4] "Overall efficiencies are 75% or lower."

1.Light olefins, such as propylene and ethylene, are valuable chemical products that can be derived from heavier alkanes in natural gas through process chemistry, including free-radical routes or catalytic partial oxidation. Steam cracking is a method that can achieve high yields of ethylene and propylene when ethane is the primary feedstock. However, this process also produces a mixture of olefin products along with other hydrocarbons and hydrogen. Steam reforming, another method, is costly due to the high operating pressures and temperatures required, which can lead to challenges in heat transfer and coke management. The overall efficiency of these processes is typically 75% or lower.

1.轻质烯烃，如丙烯和乙烯，是通过过程化学，包括自由基途径或催化部分氧化，从天然气中的较重烷烃中获得的有价值的化学产品。当乙烷是主要原料时，蒸汽裂解是一种可以实现高产率的乙烯和丙烯的方法。然而，这一过程也会产生烯烃产品、其他烃类和氢气的混合物。蒸汽重整是另一种方法，由于需要高压和高温操作，成本高昂，这可能导致传热和焦炭管理方面的挑战。这些过程的总体效率通常为75%或更低。
