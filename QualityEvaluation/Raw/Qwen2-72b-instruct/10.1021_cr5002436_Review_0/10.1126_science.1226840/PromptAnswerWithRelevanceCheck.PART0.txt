<quotes>

[1] "A high yield of eth- ylene and propylene can be achieved under properly selected reaction conditions when the primary feed is ethane; but steam crack- ing still produces a mixture of olefi n prod- ucts along with other hydrocarbons and H2."
[2] "Steam reform- ing is costly; it requires high operating pres- sures and temperatures (15 to 40 atm, 700 to 1000C) in expensive reactors with heat transfer and coke management challenges."
[3] "Overall effi ciencies are 75% or lower."

1.Light olefins, such as propylene and ethylene, are crucial in the chemical industry for the production of a wide range of products including plastics, detergents, and synthetic fibers. The key production methods involve steam cracking and steam reforming. Steam cracking, when using ethane as the primary feed, can achieve high yields of ethylene and propylene, but it also produces a mixture of other olefin products, hydrocarbons, and hydrogen. Steam reforming, on the other hand, is an expensive process that requires high operating pressures and temperatures, and it faces challenges with heat transfer and coke management. The overall efficiencies of these processes are typically 75% or lower.

1.轻质烯烃，如丙烯和乙烯，在化工行业中对于生产包括塑料、洗涤剂和合成纤维在内的广泛产品至关重要。主要生产方法涉及蒸汽裂解和蒸汽重整。当使用乙烷作为主要原料时，蒸汽裂解可以实现高产率的乙烯和丙烯，但同时也会产生其他烯烃产品、烃类和氢气的混合物。另一方面，蒸汽重整是一种成本高昂的过程，需要高操作压力和温度，并且面临着热传递和焦炭管理的挑战。这些过程的总体效率通常为75%或更低。

[1] "Process chemistry—including free-radical routes or catalytic partial oxidation—already allows a fraction of the heavier alkanes in natural gas (ethane, propane, and butane) to be converted into more-valuable chemical products."

[2] "A high yield of ethylene and propylene can be achieved under properly selected reaction conditions when the primary feed is ethane; but steam cracking still produces a mixture of olefin products along with other hydrocarbons and H2."

[3] "Steam reforming is costly; it requires high operating pressures and temperatures (15 to 40 atm, 700 to 1000°C) in expensive reactors with heat transfer and coke management challenges."

1.Light olefins, such as propylene and ethylene, are produced from heavier alkanes in natural gas through process chemistry, including free-radical routes or catalytic partial oxidation. Ethylene and propylene can be obtained in high yields under appropriate reaction conditions when ethane is the primary feedstock. However, steam cracking produces a mixture of olefin products along with other hydrocarbons and hydrogen. Steam reforming is an expensive process that requires high operating pressures and temperatures, and it faces challenges in heat transfer and coke management. The overall efficiency of these processes is 75% or lower.
