[1] "Process chemistry—including free-radical routes or catalytic partial oxidation—already allows a fraction of the heavier alkanes in natural gas (ethane, propane, and butane) to be converted into more-valuable chemical products."

[2] "A high yield of ethylene and propylene can be achieved under properly selected reaction conditions when the primary feed is ethane; but steam cracking still produces a mixture of olefin products along with other hydrocarbons and H2."

[3] "Steam reforming is costly; it requires high operating pressures and temperatures (15 to 40 atm, 700 to 1000°C) in expensive reactors with heat transfer and coke management challenges."

[4] "Overall efficiencies are 75% or lower."

1.Light olefins, such as propylene and ethylene, are produced from heavier alkanes in natural gas through process chemistry, including free-radical routes or catalytic partial oxidation. Ethylene and propylene can be obtained in high yields under appropriate reaction conditions when ethane is the primary feedstock. However, steam cracking produces a mixture of olefin products along with other hydrocarbons and hydrogen. Steam reforming is an expensive process that requires high operating pressures and temperatures, and it faces challenges in heat transfer and coke management. The overall efficiency of these processes is 75% or lower.

1.轻质烯烃，如丙烯和乙烯，通过工艺化学，包括自由基途径或催化部分氧化，从天然气中的较重烷烃中生产。当乙烷是主要原料时，可以在适当的反应条件下获得高产率的乙烯和丙烯。然而，蒸汽裂解产生包括其他烃类和氢气在内的烯烃混合物。蒸汽重整是一个昂贵的过程，需要高操作压力和温度，并且面临着热传递和焦炭管理的挑战。这些过程的总体效率为75%或更低。
