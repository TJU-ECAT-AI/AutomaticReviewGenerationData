[1] "Process chemistry—including free-radical routes or catalytic partial oxidation—already allows a fraction of the heavier alkanes in natural gas (ethane, propane, and butane) to be converted into more-valuable chemical products."

[2] "A high yield of ethylene and propylene can be achieved under properly selected reaction conditions when the primary feed is ethane; but steam cracking still produces a mixture of olefin products along with other hydrocarbons and H2."

1.Light olefins, such as propylene and ethylene, are valuable chemical products that can be obtained from the heavier alkanes in natural gas through process chemistry, including free-radical routes or catalytic partial oxidation. When ethane is the primary feed, high yields of ethylene and propylene can be achieved under properly selected reaction conditions. However, steam cracking still produces a mixture of olefin products along with other hydrocarbons and hydrogen. Steam reforming, another method, is costly due to the high operating pressures and temperatures required, and it faces challenges in heat transfer and coke management. The overall efficiencies of these processes are 75% or lower.

1.轻质烯烃，如丙烯和乙烯，是通过过程化学，包括自由基途径或催化部分氧化，从天然气中的较重烷烃中获得的有价值的化学产品。当乙烷是主要原料时，可以在适当选择的反应条件下获得高产率的乙烯和丙烯。然而，蒸汽裂解仍然会产生与其它烃类和氢气混合的烯烃产品。另一种方法，蒸汽重整，由于需要高操作压力和温度，成本高昂，并且在热传递和焦炭管理方面面临挑战。这些过程的总体效率为75%或更低。
