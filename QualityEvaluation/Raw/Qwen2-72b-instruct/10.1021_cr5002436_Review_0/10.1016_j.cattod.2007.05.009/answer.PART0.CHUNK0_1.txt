1.The literature does not provide specific information on how light olefins contribute to the chemical industry in terms of their applications and market trends. However, it does mention that the demand for olefins, especially ethylene and propylene, is expected to increase significantly in the near future. The main sources of olefins are steam cracking, fluid-catalytic-cracking, and catalytic dehydrogenation. The production of chemicals starting from alkanes by means of oxidative processes has been one of the most studied topics in recent decades. The direct conversion of ethane and propane to commodity chemical intermediates has the potential to radically transform the chemical industry. The effectiveness of the catalyst, that is the activity for alkane conversion and the selectivity to desired products, will ultimately determine the economic attractiveness of an alkane-based chemical process.

1.文献没有提供轻烯烃如何在化学工业的应用和市场趋势方面的具体信息。然而，它确实提到，预计在不久的将来，对烯烃，特别是乙烯和丙烯的需求将显著增加。烯烃的主要来源是蒸汽裂解、流体催化裂解和催化脱氢。从烷烃开始生产化学品的氧化过程在过去几十年里是最受研究的主题之一。直接将乙烷和丙烷转化为商品化学中间体有可能彻底改变化学工业。催化剂的有效性，即烷烃转化的活性和对所需产品的选择性，将最终决定基于烷烃的化学过程的经济吸引力。
