Read the questions and answers provided below. First, critically assess the overall relevance of the answers provided to the set of questions asked.

If, upon your assessment, you find that the answers do not contain information that is relevant to the questions asked, stop your review process immediately and respond with a single sentence: "※※※※※※※The provided answers are not relevant to the questions.※※※※※※※". Do not provide any additional explanation or background information, only this sentence should be given as a response in case of irrelevant answers.

If, however, the answers are relevant to the questions asked, proceed to compile answers for each question according to the instructions below. Ensure to aggregate all the relevant answers from the multiple answer results provided in the document, and organize them sequentially by their order number, compiling the corresponding quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question.

If the provided answers' quotes are not differentiated by question, ensure to break them down and assign the quotes to each respective question, outputting them separately within each question's section.

To provide a comprehensive review, differentiate the responses into quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question based on the details given in the 'Answer' XML tags. Structure your review using the XML format showcased below if the answers are relevant to the questions asked:

1.The literature does not provide specific information on how light olefins contribute to the chemical industry in terms of their applications and market trends. However, it does mention that the demand for olefins, especially ethylene and propylene, is expected to increase significantly in the near future. The main sources of olefins are steam cracking, fluid-catalytic-cracking, and catalytic dehydrogenation. The production of chemicals starting from alkanes by means of oxidative processes has been one of the most studied topics in recent decades. The direct conversion of ethane and propane to commodity chemical intermediates has the potential to radically transform the chemical industry. The effectiveness of the catalyst, that is the activity for alkane conversion and the selectivity to desired products, will ultimately determine the economic attractiveness of an alkane-based chemical process.

1.文献没有提供轻烯烃如何在化学工业的应用和市场趋势方面的具体信息。然而，它确实提到，预计在不久的将来，对烯烃，特别是乙烯和丙烯的需求将显著增加。烯烃的主要来源是蒸汽裂解、流体催化裂解和催化脱氢。从烷烃开始生产化学品的氧化过程在过去几十年里是最受研究的主题之一。直接将乙烷和丙烷转化为商品化学中间体有可能彻底改变化学工业。催化剂的有效性，即烷烃转化的活性和对所需产品的选择性，将最终决定基于烷烃的化学过程的经济吸引力。
