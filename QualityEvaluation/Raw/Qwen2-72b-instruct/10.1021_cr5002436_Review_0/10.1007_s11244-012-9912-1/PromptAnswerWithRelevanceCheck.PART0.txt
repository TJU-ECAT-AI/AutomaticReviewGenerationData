1.The literature does not provide specific information on how light olefins contribute to the chemical industry in terms of their applications and market trends. However, it does mention that catalytic dehydrogenation is a critical and growing technology for the production of olefins, especially for propylene production. The process of dehydrogenation involves high reaction enthalpy and thermodynamic equilibrium limitations, requiring the process to operate at high temperatures (>600°C) and lower pressures (<30 psig) to achieve economic conversion levels. These conditions are necessary due to the high energy required for the removal of hydrogen from alkanes to form olefins. The literature also discusses the use of noble metal multi-metallic catalysts and continuous catalyst regeneration (CCR) process in the UOP C3 Oleflex units for propylene production from propane dehydrogenation. The coupling of catalytic dehydrogenation with selective oxidation of hydrogen allows for the design of a process that greatly improves equilibrium conversions while maintaining high selectivity to olefin.

1.文献没有具体说明轻烯烃如何在化学工业中应用以及市场趋势。但是，它确实提到催化脱氢是生产烯烃，特别是丙烯生产的关键且日益重要的技术。脱氢过程涉及高反应焓和热力学平衡限制，要求过程在高温（>600°C）和低压（<30 psig）下运行，以实现经济的转化水平。这些条件是必要的，因为从烷烃中去除氢形成烯烃需要高能量。文献还讨论了在UOP C3 Oleflex装置中使用贵金属多金属催化剂和连续催化剂再生（CCR）过程，用于从丙烷脱氢生产丙烯。催化脱氢与氢气选择性氧化的结合，使得设计出一个过程，大大提高了平衡转化率，同时保持了高选择性到烯烃。

However, it does mention that catalytic dehydrogenation is a critical and growing technology for the production of olefins, especially for propylene production. The process of dehydrogenation requires high temperatures (>600 C) and lower pressures (<30 psig) due to the high reaction enthalpy and thermodynamic equilibrium limitations. These conditions are necessary to achieve economic conversion levels. The design of dehydrogenation catalysts must consider both chemical and mass transport properties to achieve high activity and selectivity. The use of shaped particles, modifying pore architecture, and employing methodologies to achieve a higher surface concentration of active component in the catalyst support pellet are common approaches to eliminate intraparticle pore diffusional limitations. The chemical composition of dehydrogenation catalysts is also critical to avoid high carbon deposition and side reactions. The role of platinum modifiers is to weaken the platinum-olefin interaction selectively without affecting the platinum-paraffin interaction, which improves catalyst selectivity and stability. The literature also discusses the Lummus/UOP SMART process, which employs an innovative catalytic oxidation technology to selectively burn the hydrogen liberated by the dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene, providing direct and more efficient reheating of the reaction mixture and reducing steam consumption. This process also shifts the reaction equilibrium towards the production of styrene monomer, increasing single-pass ethylbenzene conversion while maintaining high selectivity.
