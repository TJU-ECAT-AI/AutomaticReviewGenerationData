1.The literature does not provide specific information on how light olefins contribute to the chemical industry in terms of their applications and market trends. However, it does mention that catalytic dehydrogenation is a critical and growing technology for the production of olefins, especially for propylene production. The process of dehydrogenation requires high temperatures (>600 C) and lower pressures (<30 psig) due to the high reaction enthalpy and thermodynamic equilibrium limitations. These conditions are necessary to achieve economic conversion levels. The design of dehydrogenation catalysts must consider both chemical and mass transport properties to achieve high activity and selectivity. The use of shaped particles, modifying pore architecture, and employing methodologies to achieve a higher surface concentration of active component in the catalyst support pellet are common approaches to eliminate intraparticle pore diffusional limitations. The chemical composition of dehydrogenation catalysts is also critical to avoid high carbon deposition and side reactions. The role of platinum modifiers is to weaken the platinum-olefin interaction selectively without affecting the platinum-paraffin interaction, which improves catalyst selectivity and stability. The literature also discusses the Lummus/UOP SMART process, which employs an innovative catalytic oxidation technology to selectively burn the hydrogen liberated by the dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene, providing direct and more efficient reheating of the reaction mixture and reducing steam consumption. This process also shifts the reaction equilibrium towards the production of styrene monomer, increasing single-pass ethylbenzene conversion while maintaining high selectivity.

1.文献没有提供轻烯烃如何在化学工业中应用以及市场趋势的具体信息。但是，它确实提到了催化脱氢是生产烯烃，特别是丙烯生产的关键和不断发展的技术。脱氢过程需要高温（>600°C）和低压（<30 psig），这是由于反应焓高和热力学平衡限制。这些条件是实现经济转换水平所必需的。脱氢催化剂的设计必须考虑化学和质量传递特性，以实现高活性和选择性。使用形状粒子，修改孔结构，以及采用方法来在催化剂支撑颗粒中实现更高的活性成分表面浓度是消除粒子内孔扩散限制的常见方法。脱氢催化剂的化学组成对于避免高碳沉积和副反应也至关重要。铂修饰剂的作用是选择性地削弱铂-烯烃相互作用，而不影响铂-烷烃相互作用，这提高了催化剂的选择性和稳定性。文献还讨论了Lummus/UOP SMART工艺，该工艺采用创新的催化氧化技术，选择性地燃烧由乙苯脱氢释放的氢，为反应混合物提供直接和更有效的再加热，减少蒸汽消耗。该过程还使反应平衡向苯乙烯单体的生产转移，提高了单程乙苯转化率，同时保持高选择性。
