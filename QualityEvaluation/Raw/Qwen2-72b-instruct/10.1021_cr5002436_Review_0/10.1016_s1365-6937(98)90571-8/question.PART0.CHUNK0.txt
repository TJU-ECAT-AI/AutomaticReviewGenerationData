I'm going to give you a scientific literature. Then I'm going to ask you some questions about it. I'd like you to first write down exact quotes of parts of the document word by word that would help answer the question, and then I'd like you to answer the question using facts from the quoted content. Do not omit any relevant information from the text, and avoid introducing any falsehoods or assumptions that aren't directly supported by the literature.

ABB WINS TEXAN
TURNKEY ORDER
ABB,
the international engi- neering company,has been awarded a turnkey contract to build a 1000 MW gas-fired combined-cycle power plant in Midlothian, Texas.
The contract,valued at more than US$350 million,was placed by independent power producer American National Power Inc. a sub- sidiary of National Power plc
UK. Under
the terms of the contract, ABB will supply four CT24 gas turbines and associ- ated steam turbines,electrical generators,and heat recovery steam generators.
In addition,
ABB
will provide the engi- neering,procurement,and construction work as well as the power plant control,the distribution systems, and the balance of plant equipment.
ABB
will also be responsible for the complete installation and commissioning.
ABB
Combustion Engi- neering Boiler Systems of Windsor, Connecticut,will supply the heat recovery steam generator,and ABB Power Generation of Midlothian, Virginia,will provide gas tur- bine assembly,civil works,and construction.
Work on the new power plant is planned to begin later this year, with com- mercial operation set for the summer of 2000.
The plant will be one of the largest mer- chant power plants in the increasingly deregulated
US
power market. Merchant plants deliver power as needed to meet the actual short-term demands of the open market,without the long-term contract and guaranteed prices typical of regulated markets.
GREENFIELD
PLANT FOR
PARIS, TEXAS
Duke/Fluor Daniel has been awarded a turnkey contract by Panda Paris Power LP, a subsidiary of Panda Energy International Inc, to provide engineering,procurement,construction and start-up services for a 1000
MW,
greenfield power plant locat- ed in Paris, Texas.
The value of Duke/Fluor Daniels contract was not dis- closed.
Detailed engineering for the combined cycle power plant,which is Duke/Fluor Daniels third merchant power plant in Texas, is underway.
Commercial operation is scheduled for the summer of 2000 and construction will begin in March 1999.
Established in 1982, Panda Energy International is a pri- vately held corporation which develops power and infrastruc- ture projects worldwide.
Duke/Fluor Daniel,formed in 1989 by Duke Energy Corp and Fluor Daniel,provides engineering,procurement,construction,operations and maintenance services for fos- sil-fueled electric power gen- eration facilities worldwide.

SENEGAL POWER
PROJECT
GE
Capital Structured Finance Group
(SFG)
has completed the financing of the US$65 million,
50+MW
GTi Dakar power plant in Senegal.
Developed and sponsored by SFG, the GTi Dakar power plant represents the largest single US investment in Sene- gal. The project will employ energy-efficient power genera- tion equipment provided by
NUOVO
Pignone,a subsidiary of General Electric Power Systems.
Construction is expected to begin soon, and will be carried out in two stages over 19 months.
DEATH KNELL
TOLLS FOR
GERMAN
NUCLEAR
INDUSTRY
Germanys newly elected Social Democrat and Green coalition government is phasing out nuclear power.
The two parties have agreed a plan to shut down the countrys 19 nuclear power plants, which provide around a third of Germanys electricity.
November 1999 has been set as the deadline for reaching agreement with industry over the pace of the closures,but the shutdown process itself may take up to 30 years.
Sources say that if an agree- ment is not reached with industry, the coalition govem- ment will legislate anyway.
ELWOOD ENERGY
SELECTS GE AS
CONTRACTOR
Elwood Energy
LLC,
a joint venture between Peoples Energy Resources Corp and Dominion Energy Inc, has signed a contract with General Electric to provide engineering,procurement and construction services for two additional combustion turbines,as part of a facility expansion.
Under the terms of the agreement, GE will provide two 150
MW
Model
PG723 1
FA combustion tur- bines at the planned merchant electricity facility,scheduled for construction at an energy centre 60 miles southwest of Chicago. When the additional units are installed,they will increase the proposed facilitys total planned capacity from 300 MW to 600 MW. The four turbines will enter service in June and July 1999.
SHELL AND
ENRON AGREE ON
CUIABA PROJECT
Shell International Gas Ltd and Enron International have Bnalised a partnership agreement to develop the Cuiaba Power Project.
This integrated power pro- ject consists of a gas-fired combined cycle power plant situated in Mato Grass0 state in the west of Brazil and a 630 km gas pipeline in Bolivia and Brazil. With a final capacity of 480
MW. the plant
will be developed in stages, over three years. The total cost of the pro- ject is approximately
US$500
million and the first phase is expected to start-up at the end of this year. Shell equity in the project ranges between 25 and 35 per cent for the power sta- tion and pipeline respectively.
HERCULES
EXPANDS
PECTIN
PRODUCTION
Hercules is undertaking engineering studies to expand its pectin facility at its food gums plant in Grossenbrode, Germany.
This investment will increase pectin annual capacity in Grossenbrode from 3300 metric tons to 5500 metric tons. The project,which will reduce manufacturing costs at the site considerably,is sched- uled for completion by the third quarter of 2000.
This automation and expansion pro- ject is the first in a series of three planned expansions.
Hercules is the worlds largest producer of pectin,which is derived from citrus and apple peels and used primarily in the food industry as a stabiliser.

First, you need to sequentially extract any quotes in the literature that are most relevant to each question, and print them in numbered order, separated by newlines. Quotes should be relatively brief. Do not attempt to summarize or answer questions at this stage, but simply repeat exactly what the corresponding part of the literature says.

Please enclose the full list of quotes in <quotes></quotes> XML tags. If there are no relevant quotes, write "No relevant quotes" instead.

Then, answer the question, starting with "Answer:".  Do not include or reference quoted content verbatim in the answer. Don't say "According to Quote [1]" when answering. Do not write reference number of quotes after answer. Put your answer to the user inside <EnglishVersionAnswer></EnglishVersionAnswer> XML tags. Output formatted text, with line breaks for each question.Separate quotes and answers with a blank line. Provide the answers to all questions in English. After completing the English answers, translate all those answers into Chinese and provide the Chinese version inside <ChineseVersionAnswer></ChineseVersionAnswer> XML tags.

Thus, the format of your overall response should look like what's shown between the <example></example> tags.  Make sure to follow the formatting and spacing exactly.
