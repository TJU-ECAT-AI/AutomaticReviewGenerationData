[1] "Catalytic paraffin dehydrogenation for the production of olefins has been in commercial use since the late 1930s, while catalytic paraffin oxydehydrogenation for olefin production has not yet been commercialized."
[2] "Commercial processes for the catalytic dehydrogenation of propane and butanes attain per-pass conversions in the range of 3060%, while the catalytic dehydrogenation of C10C14 paraffins typically operates at conversion levels of 1020%."
[3] "In the year 2000, nearly 7 million metric tons of C3C4 olefins and 2 million metric tons of C10C14 range olefins were produced via catalytic dehydrogenation."
[4] "Oxydehydrogenation employs catalysts containing vanadium and, more recently, platinum."
[5] "Oxydehydrogenation at 1000 C and very short residence time over Pt and Pt-Sn catalysts can produce ethylene in higher yields than in steam cracking."
[6] "However, there are a number of issues related to safety and process upsets that need to be addressed."
[7] "Important objectives in oxydehydrogenation are attaining high selectivity to olefins with high conversion of paraffin and minimizing potentially dangerous mixtures of paraffin and oxidant."
[8] "More recently, the use of carbon dioxide as an oxidant for ethane conversion to ethylene has been investigated as a potential way to reduce the negative impact of dangerous oxidantparaffin mixtures and to achieve higher selectivity."
[9] "While catalytic dehydrogenation reflects a relatively mature and well-established technology, oxydehydrogenation can in many respects be characterized as still being in its infancy."
[10] "Oxydehydrogenation, however, offers substantial thermodynamic advantages and is an area of active research in many fronts."

1.Light olefins, such as propylene and ethylene, are crucial to the chemical industry, serving as key building blocks for a wide range of products including plastics, detergents, and synthetic fibers. The market for these olefins is substantial, with millions of metric tons produced annually through catalytic dehydrogenation processes. The production of C3C4 olefins and C10C14 range olefins via catalytic dehydrogenation in the year 2000 alone amounted to nearly 7 million and 2 million metric tons, respectively. The commercial processes for dehydrogenation of propane and butanes achieve per-pass conversions of 30-60%, while those for C10C14 paraffins operate at lower conversion levels of 10-20%. Oxydehydrogenation, a process that employs catalysts containing vanadium and, more recently, platinum, is an area of active research due to its potential thermodynamic advantages. However, it is not yet commercialized due to safety concerns and the challenge of achieving high selectivity and conversion without dangerous paraffin-oxidant mixtures. Recent investigations into using carbon dioxide as an oxidant for ethane conversion to ethylene aim to address these issues and improve selectivity.

1.轻质烯烃，如丙烯和乙烯，是化工行业的重要组成部分，作为塑料、洗涤剂和合成纤维等广泛产品的关键原料。这些烯烃的市场巨大，每年通过催化脱氢过程生产数以百万吨计。仅在2000年，通过催化脱氢生产的C3C4烯烃和C10C14范围烯烃就分别达到了近700万和200万公吨。丙烷和丁烷的脱氢商业过程实现了30-60%的单程转化率，而C10C14烷烃的转化率则较低，为10-20%。氧脱氢，一种使用含钒和最近含铂催化剂的过程，由于其潜在的热力学优势，是当前研究的热点。然而，由于安全问题和在不产生危险的烷烃-氧化剂混合物的情况下实现高选择性和转化的挑战，它尚未实现商业化。最近对使用二氧化碳作为氧化剂将乙烷转化为乙烯的研究旨在解决这些问题并提高选择性。
