[1] "Catalytic paraffin dehydrogenation for the production of olefins has been in commercial use since the late 1930s, while catalytic paraffin oxydehydrogenation for olefin production has not yet been commercialized."
[2] "Commercial processes for the catalytic dehydrogenation of propane and butanes attain per-pass conversions in the range of 3060%, while the catalytic dehydrogenation of C10C14 paraffins typically operates at conversion levels of 1020%."
[3] "In the year 2000, nearly 7 million metric tons of C3C4 olefins and 2 million metric tons of C10C14 range olefins were produced via catalytic dehydrogenation."
[4] "Oxydehydrogenation employs catalysts containing vanadium and, more recently, platinum. Oxydehydrogenation at 1000 C and very short residence time over Pt and Pt-Sn catalysts can produce ethylene in higher yields than in steam cracking."
[5] "However, there are a number of issues related to safety and process upsets that need to be addressed."
[6] "Important objectives in oxydehydrogenation are attaining high selectivity to olefins with high conversion of paraffin and minimizing potentially dangerous mixtures of paraffin and oxidant."
[7] "More recently, the use of carbon dioxide as an oxidant for ethane conversion to ethylene has been investigated as a potential way to reduce the negative impact of dangerous oxidantparaffin mixtures and to achieve higher selectivity."
[8] "While catalytic dehydrogenation reflects a relatively mature and well-established technology, oxydehydrogenation can in many respects be characterized as still being in its infancy."
[9] "Oxydehydrogenation, however, offers substantial thermodynamic advantages and is an area of active research in many fronts."

1.Light olefins, such as propylene and ethylene, are crucial to the chemical industry, serving as fundamental building blocks for a wide range of products, including plastics, detergents, and synthetic fibers. Propylene and ethylene production via catalytic dehydrogenation has been a commercial practice since the late 1930s, with significant volumes produced annually. In 2000, nearly 7 million metric tons of C3C4 olefins and 2 million metric tons of C10C14 olefins were produced through this method. The production of light olefins faces thermodynamic challenges, particularly related to temperature, pressure, and the length of the alkane chain. Higher temperatures are required for the dehydrogenation of light paraffins to achieve economically attractive conversions, which can lead to increased side reactions, coke formation, and catalyst deactivation. The equilibrium conversion for dehydrogenation increases with the carbon number in the paraffin, making the dehydrogenation of heavy paraffins more favorable at lower temperatures. Oxydehydrogenation, which is still in its infancy, offers thermodynamic advantages by removing the equilibrium conversion restriction of dehydrogenation, but it presents safety and process control challenges due to the potentially explosive mixtures of paraffins and oxygen. The use of carbon dioxide as an oxidant is being explored to improve selectivity and safety in ethane conversion to ethylene.

1.轻烯烃，如丙烯和乙烯，是化工行业至关重要的组成部分，作为塑料、洗涤剂和合成纤维等广泛产品的基础原料。自20世纪30年代末以来，通过催化脱氢生产丙烯和乙烯已成为商业实践，每年生产大量此类烯烃。2000年，通过这种方法生产了近700万吨C3C4烯烃和200万吨C10C14烯烃。轻烯烃的生产面临着与温度、压力和烷烃链长度相关的热力学挑战。为了实现经济上吸引人的转化率，需要在较高温度下进行轻烷烃的脱氢，这可能导致副反应增加、焦炭形成和催化剂失活。脱氢的平衡转化率随着烷烃中碳数的增加而增加，使得在较低温度下重烷烃的脱氢更为有利。尽管仍处于起步阶段，但氧脱氢提供了热力学优势，通过消除脱氢的平衡转化限制，但因烷烃和氧气可能形成爆炸性混合物，带来了安全和过程控制的挑战。正在探索使用二氧化碳作为氧化剂，以提高乙烯从乙烷转化的乙烯选择性和安全性。
