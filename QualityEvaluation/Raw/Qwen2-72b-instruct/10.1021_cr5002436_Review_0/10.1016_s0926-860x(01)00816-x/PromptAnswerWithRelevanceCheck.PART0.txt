[1] "The world propylene production capacity, based on the use of catalytic dehydrogenation of propane has increased steadily over the past 10 years [13] and is ex- pected to grow even further under the right economic conditions relative to the availability of propane; on the other hand, environmental concerns on the use of MTBE are expected to adversely impact the future ex- pansion of isobutane dehydrogenation applications."
[2] "Although production of ethylene via catalytic dehy- drogenation over Pt catalysts is very selective (about 95%), extension of this dehydrogenation technology to ethane has not taken place due to the need for even more severe operating conditions; higher temperatures and lower pressures. Such conditions cause excessive coking of the catalyst or require costlier operation under vacuum."
[3] "The equilibrium conversion increases at higher Fig. 4 indicates that the temperature required for the dehydrogenation of light paraffins is much higher than for heavy paraf- fins. For 40% conversion, for example, the dehydro- genation of propane requires a temperature of at least about 580 C, while dodecane can be theoretically dehydrogenated to the same extent at only 450 C."
[4] "The equilibrium constant for paraffin dehydrogena- tion increases significantly as the carbon number in- creases."

1.Light olefins, such as propylene and ethylene, are crucial to the chemical industry, serving as key building blocks for a wide range of products including plastics, detergents, and synthetic fibers. The production capacity for propylene, particularly through catalytic dehydrogenation of propane, has seen steady growth over the past decade and is projected to further expand under favorable economic conditions, especially with the availability of propane. However, environmental concerns regarding the use of methyl tertiary butyl ether (MTBE) are anticipated to negatively affect the future expansion of isobutane dehydrogenation applications. Ethylene production through catalytic dehydrogenation over platinum catalysts is highly selective, but extending this technology to ethane requires more severe operating conditions, such as higher temperatures and lower pressures, which can lead to excessive catalyst coking or necessitate more expensive vacuum operations. The thermodynamic challenge for light olefin synthesis is that higher temperatures are required for the dehydrogenation of light paraffins compared to heavy paraffins. For instance, achieving 40% conversion of propane demands a temperature of at least 580 degrees Celsius, whereas dodecane can be dehydrogenated to the same extent at a lower temperature of 450 degrees Celsius. The equilibrium constant for paraffin dehydrogenation increases significantly with the increase in carbon number.

1.轻烯烃，如丙烯和乙烯，对化工行业至关重要，是塑料、洗涤剂和合成纤维等广泛产品的关键原料。基于丙烷催化脱氢的丙烯生产能力在过去十年中稳步增长，并且在有利的经济条件下，特别是丙烷的可用性下，预计将进一步扩大。然而，对使用甲基叔丁基醚(MTBE)的环境担忧预计会对异丁烷脱氢应用的未来扩张产生负面影响。通过铂催化剂催化脱氢生产乙烯具有高度选择性，但将这项技术扩展到乙烷需要更苛刻的操作条件，如更高的温度和更低的压力，这可能导致催化剂过度积碳或需要更昂贵的真空操作。轻烯烃合成的热力学挑战在于，轻石蜡的脱氢需要比重石蜡更高的温度。例如，要达到40%的丙烷转化率，需要至少580摄氏度的温度，而十二烷可以在较低的450摄氏度温度下脱氢到相同的程度。随着碳数的增加，石蜡脱氢的平衡常数显著增加。

1.Light olefins, such as propylene and ethylene, are crucial to the chemical industry, serving as fundamental building blocks for a wide range of products, including plastics, detergents, and synthetic fibers. Propylene and ethylene production via catalytic dehydrogenation has been a commercial practice since the late 1930s, with significant volumes produced annually. In 2000, nearly 7 million metric tons of C3C4 olefins and 2 million metric tons of C10C14 olefins were produced through this method. The production of light olefins faces thermodynamic challenges, particularly related to temperature, pressure, and the length of the alkane chain. Higher temperatures are required for the dehydrogenation of light paraffins to achieve economically attractive conversions, which can lead to increased side reactions, coke formation, and catalyst deactivation. The equilibrium conversion for dehydrogenation increases with the carbon number in the paraffin, making the dehydrogenation of heavy paraffins more favorable at lower temperatures. Oxydehydrogenation, which is still in its infancy, offers thermodynamic advantages by removing the equilibrium conversion restriction of dehydrogenation, but it presents safety and process control challenges due to the potentially explosive mixtures of paraffins and oxygen. The use of carbon dioxide as an oxidant is being explored to improve selectivity and safety in ethane conversion to ethylene.

1.Light olefins, such as propylene and ethylene, are crucial to the chemical industry, serving as key building blocks for a wide range of products, including plastics, detergents, and synthetic fibers. The market trends for these olefins are influenced by global demand for petrochemical products, with steady growth expected due to increasing industrialization and population growth. The primary production methods for light olefins include steam cracking and catalytic dehydrogenation. Steam cracking is the most widely used process, involving the thermal cracking of hydrocarbons at high temperatures to produce a mixture of olefins and other hydrocarbons. Catalytic dehydrogenation, on the other hand, is a more selective process that converts paraffins to olefins using catalysts. The thermodynamic challenges associated with the synthesis of light olefins are significant, particularly in relation to temperature, pressure, and the length of the alkane chain. Higher temperatures are required for the dehydrogenation of light paraffins to achieve economically attractive conversions, but this also accelerates catalyst deactivation and side reactions. Pressure plays a role in shifting the equilibrium towards higher conversions, with lower pressures favoring dehydrogenation. The length of the alkane chain affects the equilibrium conversion, with longer chains requiring lower temperatures for dehydrogenation. Oxydehydrogenation, which uses oxygen as a co-reactant, offers thermodynamic advantages by removing the hydrogen product, thus shifting the equilibrium towards higher conversions. However, this process is still in the developmental stage and faces challenges related to safety, process upsets, and the need for highly selective catalysts.

The market for these olefins is substantial, with millions of metric tons produced annually through catalytic dehydrogenation processes. The production of C3C4 olefins and C10C14 range olefins via catalytic dehydrogenation in the year 2000 alone amounted to nearly 7 million and 2 million metric tons, respectively. The commercial processes for dehydrogenation of propane and butanes achieve per-pass conversions of 30-60%, while those for C10C14 paraffins operate at lower conversion levels of 10-20%. Oxydehydrogenation, a process that employs catalysts containing vanadium and, more recently, platinum, is an area of active research due to its potential thermodynamic advantages. However, it is not yet commercialized due to safety concerns and the challenge of achieving high selectivity and conversion without dangerous paraffin-oxidant mixtures.
