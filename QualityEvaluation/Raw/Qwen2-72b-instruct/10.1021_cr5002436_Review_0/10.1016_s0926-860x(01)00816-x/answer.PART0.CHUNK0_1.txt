[1] "Catalytic paraffin dehydrogenation for the production of olefins has been in commercial use since the late 1930s, while catalytic paraffin oxydehydrogenation for olefin production has not yet been commercialized."
[2] "Commercial processes for the catalytic dehydrogenation of propane and butanes attain per-pass conversions in the range of 3060%, while the catalytic dehydrogenation of C10C14 paraffins typically operates at conversion levels of 1020%."
[3] "In the year 2000, nearly 7 million metric tons of C3C4 olefins and 2 million metric tons of C10C14 range olefins were produced via catalytic dehydrogenation."
[4] "Oxydehydrogenation employs catalysts containing vanadium and, more recently, platinum."
[5] "Oxydehydrogenation at 1000 C and very short residence time over Pt and Pt-Sn catalysts can produce ethylene in higher yields than in steam cracking."
[6] "However, there are a number of issues related to safety and process upsets that need to be addressed."
[7] "Important objectives in oxydehydrogenation are attaining high selectivity to olefins with high conversion of paraffin and minimizing potentially dangerous mixtures of paraffin and oxidant."
[8] "More recently, the use of carbon dioxide as an oxidant for ethane conversion to ethylene has been investigated as a potential way to reduce the negative impact of dangerous oxidantparaffin mixtures and to achieve higher selectivity."
[9] "While catalytic dehydrogenation reflects a relatively mature and well-established technology, oxydehydrogenation can in many respects be characterized as still being in its infancy."
[10] "Oxydehydrogenation, however, offers substantial thermodynamic advantages and is an area of active research in many fronts."

1.Light olefins, such as propylene and ethylene, are crucial to the chemical industry, serving as key building blocks for a wide range of products including plastics, detergents, and synthetic fibers. The market for these olefins is substantial, with millions of metric tons produced annually through catalytic dehydrogenation processes. Propylene and ethylene production methods are dominated by catalytic dehydrogenation, which has been a commercial technology since the late 1930s. However, the technology faces thermodynamic challenges, particularly in relation to temperature, pressure, and the length of the alkane chain. Higher temperatures are required for the dehydrogenation of light olefins compared to heavier olefins to achieve higher conversion levels, which can lead to increased side reactions and catalyst deactivation. Oxydehydrogenation, which is still in its infancy, offers thermodynamic advantages by removing the equilibrium conversion restriction of dehydrogenation, but it also presents safety concerns and the challenge of attaining high selectivity to olefins while minimizing potentially dangerous mixtures of paraffin and oxidant. The use of carbon dioxide as an oxidant is being explored to improve selectivity and safety in ethane conversion to ethylene.

1.轻质烯烃，如丙烯和乙烯，对化工行业至关重要，是塑料、洗涤剂和合成纤维等广泛产品的关键原料。这些烯烃的市场巨大，每年通过催化脱氢过程生产数以百万吨计。丙烯和乙烯的生产方法主要依赖于自20世纪30年代末以来的商业技术——催化脱氢。然而，该技术面临着与温度、压力和烷链长度相关的热力学挑战。对于轻质烯烃的脱氢，与较重的烯烃相比，为了达到更高的转化水平，需要更高的温度，这可能导致副反应增加和催化剂失活。氧脱氢，尽管仍处于起步阶段，通过消除脱氢的平衡转化限制，提供了热力学优势，但它也带来了安全问题和在最小化潜在危险的石蜡和氧化剂混合物的同时，实现高烯烃选择性的挑战。正在探索使用二氧化碳作为氧化剂，以提高乙烯从乙烷转化的乙烯选择性和安全性。
