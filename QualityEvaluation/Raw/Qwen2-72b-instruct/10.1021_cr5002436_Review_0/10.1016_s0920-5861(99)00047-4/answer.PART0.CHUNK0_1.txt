1.The literature does not provide specific information on how light olefins contribute to the chemical industry in terms of their applications and market trends. However, it does mention that propene is used in the polymer industry for the synthesis of high-purity polypropylene, and isobutene is needed for the synthesis of MTBE and ETBE, additives to gasoline. The dehydrogenation of propane and isobutane has become more important in recent years. Alkane dehydrogenation is an endothermic process that requires relatively high temperatures and low pressures to obtain significant yields of alkenes. The required high temperatures favor thermal cracking reactions to lighter alkanes and coke, which can lead to catalyst deactivation. Suitable catalysts not only have to possess good activity and selectivity, but also must suppress thermal cracking reactions.

1.文献没有提供轻烯烃如何在化学工业中应用以及市场趋势的具体信息。但是，它确实提到丙烯在聚合物工业中用于合成高纯度聚丙烯，异丁烯用于合成MTBE和ETBE，这两种物质是汽油的添加剂。近年来，丙烷和异丁烷的脱氢变得越来越重要。烷烃脱氢是一个吸热过程，需要相对较高的温度和较低的压力才能获得显著的烯烃产量。所需高温有利于热裂解反应生成较轻的烷烃和焦炭，这可能导致催化剂失活。合适的催化剂不仅需要具有良好的活性和选择性，还必须抑制热裂解反应。
