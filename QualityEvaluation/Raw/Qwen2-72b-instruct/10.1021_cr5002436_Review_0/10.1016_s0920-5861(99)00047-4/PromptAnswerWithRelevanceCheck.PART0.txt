Read the questions and answers provided below. First, critically assess the overall relevance of the answers provided to the set of questions asked.

If, upon your assessment, you find that the answers do not contain information that is relevant to the questions asked, stop your review process immediately and respond with a single sentence: "※※※※※※※The provided answers are not relevant to the questions.※※※※※※※". Do not provide any additional explanation or background information, only this sentence should be given as a response in case of irrelevant answers.

If, however, the answers are relevant to the questions asked, proceed to compile answers for each question according to the instructions below. Ensure to aggregate all the relevant answers from the multiple answer results provided in the document, and organize them sequentially by their order number, compiling the corresponding quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question.

If the provided answers' quotes are not differentiated by question, ensure to break them down and assign the quotes to each respective question, outputting them separately within each question's section.

To provide a comprehensive review, differentiate the responses into quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question based on the details given in the 'Answer' XML tags. Structure your review using the XML format showcased below if the answers are relevant to the questions asked:

1.The literature does not provide specific information on how light olefins contribute to the chemical industry in terms of their applications and market trends. However, it does mention that propene is used in the polymer industry for the synthesis of high-purity polypropylene, and isobutene is needed for the synthesis of MTBE and ETBE, additives to gasoline. The dehydrogenation of propane and isobutane has become more important in recent years. The CATOFIN process leads the world for producing propene and isobutene. The production of light olefins is an endothermic process that requires relatively high temperatures and low pressures to obtain significant yields. Longer alkane chains are dehydrogenated at lower temperatures, whereas lighter alkanes require higher dehydrogenation temperatures.

1.文献没有提供轻烯烃如何在化学工业中应用以及市场趋势的具体信息。但是，它确实提到丙烯用于聚合物工业中高纯度聚丙烯的合成，异丁烯用于合成MTBE和ETBE，这是汽油的添加剂。近年来，丙烷和异丁烷的脱氢变得越来越重要。CATOFIN工艺在生产丙烯和异丁烯方面领先全球。轻烯烃的生产是一个吸热过程，需要相对较高的温度和较低的压力才能获得显著的产量。较长的烷烃链在较低的温度下脱氢，而较轻的烷烃则需要较高的脱氢温度。

The dehydrogenation of propane and isobutane has become more important in recent years. Alkane dehydrogenation is an endothermic process that requires relatively high temperatures and low pressures to obtain significant yields of alkenes. The required high temperatures favor thermal cracking reactions to lighter alkanes and coke, which can lead to catalyst deactivation. Suitable catalysts not only have to possess good activity and selectivity, but also must suppress thermal cracking reactions.
