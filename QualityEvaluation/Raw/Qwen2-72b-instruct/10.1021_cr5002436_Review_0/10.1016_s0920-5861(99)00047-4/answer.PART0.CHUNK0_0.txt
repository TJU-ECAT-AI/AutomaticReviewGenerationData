1.The literature does not provide specific information on how light olefins contribute to the chemical industry in terms of their applications and market trends. However, it does mention that propene is used in the polymer industry for the synthesis of high-purity polypropylene, and isobutene is needed for the synthesis of MTBE and ETBE, additives to gasoline. The dehydrogenation of propane and isobutane has become more important in recent years. The CATOFIN process leads the world for producing propene and isobutene. The production of light olefins is an endothermic process that requires relatively high temperatures and low pressures to obtain significant yields. Longer alkane chains are dehydrogenated at lower temperatures, whereas lighter alkanes require higher dehydrogenation temperatures.

1.文献没有提供轻烯烃如何在化学工业中应用以及市场趋势的具体信息。但是，它确实提到丙烯用于聚合物工业中高纯度聚丙烯的合成，异丁烯用于合成MTBE和ETBE，这是汽油的添加剂。近年来，丙烷和异丁烷的脱氢变得越来越重要。CATOFIN工艺在生产丙烯和异丁烯方面领先全球。轻烯烃的生产是一个吸热过程，需要相对较高的温度和较低的压力才能获得显著的产量。较长的烷烃链在较低的温度下脱氢，而较轻的烷烃则需要较高的脱氢温度。
