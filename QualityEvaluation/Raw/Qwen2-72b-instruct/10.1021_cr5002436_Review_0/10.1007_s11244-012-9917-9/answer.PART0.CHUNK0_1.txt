1.Light olefins, such as propylene and ethylene, are the top two largest volume petrochemical intermediates. Ethylene is primarily produced through the thermal cracking of ethane, LPG, and heavier feedstocks. Propylene production has seen a growth rate that outpaces conventional supply routes over the past two decades, leading to the construction of commercial units for the selective catalytic dehydrogenation of propane to propylene. Additionally, isobutane dehydrogenation units were built during the 1990s to produce isobutylene, which was then converted to MTBE or dimerized and hydrogenated to produce isooctane, a high octane gasoline blending component. The production of light olefins is thermodynamically challenging due to the high temperatures required for dehydrogenation, which increases significantly as the carbon number decreases. For instance, propane dehydrogenation requires a temperature of at least 580 C for 40% conversion at 1 atm absolute pressure, while dodecane can be dehydrogenated to the same extent at only 450 C.

1.轻烯烃，如丙烯和乙烯，是前两大最大体积的石化中间体。乙烯主要通过乙烷、LPG和重质原料的热裂解生产。在过去的二十年里，丙烯的生产增长率超过了这些传统的供应路线，导致了商业单位的建设，用于选择性催化脱氢，将丙烷转化为丙烯。此外，在20世纪90年代，建造了几个异丁烷脱氢装置，生产异丁烯，然后转化为MTBE或二聚化和氢化，以生产异辛烷，这是一种高辛烷值的汽油混合成分。轻烯烃的生产在热力学上具有挑战性，因为脱氢需要的高温随着碳数的减少而显著增加。例如，丙烷脱氢在1 atm绝对压力下，40%的转化率需要至少580 C的温度，而十二烷在相同的程度下脱氢只需要450 C。
