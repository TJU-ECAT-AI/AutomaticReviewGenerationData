ORIGINAL PAPER
Development of Dehydrogenation Catalysts and Processes Bipin V. Vora Published online: 13 November 2012 Springer Science+Business Media New York 2012 Abstract Catalytic dehydrogenation plays an important role in production of light (C3C4 carbon range), detergent range (C10C13 carbon range) olefins and for ethylbenzene dehydrogenation to styrene. During the World War II,catalytic dehydrogenation of butane over a chromiaalu- mina catalyst was practiced for the production of butenes that were dimerized to octenes and hydrogenated to octanes to yield high-octane aviation fuels. The earlier catalyst development employed chromiaalumina catalyst and more recent catalytic developments use platinum or mod- ified platinum catalysts. Dehydrogenation is a highly endothermic process and as such is an equilibrium limited reaction. Thus important aspects in dehydrogenation entail approaching equilibrium or near-equilibrium conversion while minimizing side reactions and coke formation.
Keywords Paraffin dehydrogena  Olefins production Platinum catalysis Significant development work has been done on paraffin oxydehydrogenation that would allow selective combustion of hydrogen and thus shift the equilibrium more in favor of higher conversion. This approach was practiced during 1960s for the production of butadiene by Petro-Tex Chemical Corporation and by Phillips Petroleum Com- pany. However, as significant quantity of butadiene became available as byproduct of naphtha cracker for ethylene, this route is not practiced today.
Commercial processes for catalytic dehydrogenation of propane and butanes attain 3060 % per-pass conversion while C10C13 range paraffin dehydrogenation operate at per-pass conversion range of 1015 %. Ethylene and pro- pylene are No.1 and No.2 largest volume petrochemical intermediates. Figure 1 shows worldwide demand of eth- ylene and propylene and growth from 1990 to 2010 [1]. For ethylene thermal cracking of ethane, LPG and heavier feedstocks continues to be the primary route. Thermal cracking of LPG or heavier feedstocks also provide sig- nificant quantity of propylene byproduct. Fluid catalytic cracking in refineries also produce significant quantity of propylene byproduct. However, over the past two decades propylene growth rate has out-paced these conventional supply routes leading to construction of number of com- mercial units for selective catalytic dehydrogenation of propane to propylene. Also during 1990s several isobutane dehydrogenation units were built producing isobutylene that were converted to MTBE or dimerized and hydroge- nated to produce isooctane, a high octane gasoline blending components. 1 Historical Developments Chromiaalumina catalyst for the production of olefins has been in use since the late 1930s. During World War II,catalytic dehydrogenation of butanes over a chromia/alu- mina catalyst was practiced for the production of butenes which were then dimerized to octenes and hydrogenated to octanes to yield high-octane aviation fuel.
Dehydrogenation of butanes over a chromia/alumina catalyst was first developed and commercialized at Leuna in Germany and also independently by Ipatieff and co- workers at UOP [2, 3]. The first UOP-designed plant came Prepared for Dr. Jeff Bricker 2011 ACS Award Symposium.

The production of octenes by butene dimerization made use of UOPs catalytic condensation process in which olefins are dimerized, oligomerized, or alkylated over a solid phos- phoric acid (SPA) catalyst, discovered by Schaad and Ipatieff, and first commercialized in 1933 [5].
These pioneering efforts were soon followed by other companies (e.g., Phillips Petroleums multitubular dehy- drogenation reactor near Borger, Texas, in 1943 [4]).
However, the most significant development was that made by Houdry using dehydrogenation under vacuum for higher per-pass conversions and commercialized two stage butane dehydrogenation chromia/alumina system, known as Cat- adiene process, for the production of butadiene [4].
The Houdry Catadiene process was used extensively for the production of butadiene, either by itself (n-butane to butadiene) or in conjunction with the Oxo-D catalytic process for the oxydehydrogenation of n-butene to buta- diene that was commercialized by what was then known as Petro-Tex Chemical Corp. [6]. A similar oxydehydrogen- ation approach for the production of butadiene was fol- lowed by Phillips Petroleum in their O-X-D process [6].
Large quantities of butadiene have become available in the market over the past 30 years, mostly as a byproduct from the thermal cracking of naphtha and other heavy hydrocarbons. The result from this market shift has been the shutdown of all ad-hoc catalytic dehydrogenation units for butadiene production in North America, Western Eur- ope, and the Far East. However, over the past two decades because of changing to lighter (ethane and LPG) feedstocks for the ethylene plant crackers, rate of butadiene produc- tion growth has slowed below the demand growth creating regional shortage of butadiene. Butadiene price has jumped from $800/MT in 2005 to over $2000/MT in 2011. As a result of this there is again increasing interest in on-purpose butadiene production. In August 2011 Texas Petrochemical (TPC Group Inc) announced detail engineering study of on- purpose butadiene production utilizing their idled Oxo-D plant. In 2011 Mitsubishi announced a development of oxidative dehydrogenation process for butane dehydroge- nation for the production of butadiene [7].
In the late 1980s, application of chromia/alumina cata- lysts was extended by Houdry to the dehydrogenation of propane to propylene and isobutane to isobutene, and over the two decades there were several new units were built for this purpose. These units again operate on the same cyclic principles as in the former Catadiene process, and the new process application is named Catofin [8, 9]. The Catofin process technology is currently owned by Su d-Chemie and is offered by Lummus, A CBI Company.
In about 1959 an alternative chromia/alumina catalytic dehydrogenation process was developed in the former Soviet Union that avoided the use of the cyclic operation by using a fluidized bed reactor configuration similar to the fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) process used in refineries [4]. However, back mixing common to dense fluidized bed operations results in poor selectivity and increases the formation of heavies, sometimes called green oils. Cir- culating regenerated catalyst is used to provide the heat of reaction in the riser and spent catalyst is reheated by carbon burn in a regenerator. A larger scale isobutane dehydro- genation unit using this principle was commercialized by Snam Progetti in Saudi Arabia based on technology from Yarsintez in Russia [10].
Lestor, Carson, and others at UOP during late 1960s and early 1970s also worked on development of fluid-bed cat- alytic dehydrogenation employing chromia alumina cata- lyst but the technology was not commercialized [1114].
Chromia/alumina catalysts pose a significant health risk in case of spillage or by exposure to the plant operators during maintenance or catalyst changeover. Chromia/alumina catalysts always contain a significant proportion of Cr(VI),principally in the regenerated catalyst; Cr(VI) is a well- known carcinogen and its adverse health effects have been well documented [15, 16]. Chromia/alumina catalysts sin- ter much more rapidly than alumina when exposed to high temperatures; the replacement of the mass of spent catalyst often requires strenuous and lengthy use of manual labor for such an operation [17, 18].
The dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene to styrene reac- tion proceeds over an iron or an ironchromium catalyst that usually also contains potassium in the form of potas- sium carbonate, so that at elevated temperatures various complex mixed carbonates and oxides are formed; e.g., KFeO2. Temperatures are elevated, in the order of 630 C,and steam dilution is practiced to lower the partial pressure of the reactants. Because the reaction is strongly endo- thermic various reaction stages are normally employed with interheat and interstage addition of superheated steam. 120 0 Demand, MM MTA 1995 2000 2005 100 80 60 40 20 Ethylene Propylene 2010 Fig. 1 Ethylene and propylene demand 1298 Top Catal (2012) 55:12971308 123 2 Noble Metal Dehydrogenation Catalysts A different approach to catalytic dehydrogenation was first introduced in the mid-1960s, for the production of linear olefins of C10C13 carbon range for the production of biodegradable detergents.
Synthetic detergents based on the use of alkylbenzene sulfonates had been introduced in the 1940s. The manu- facture of these early detergents made use of UOPs cata- lytic condensation process to oligomerize propylene to a mixture of branched dodecene isomers. The branched do- decenes were then alkylated with benzene in the presence of a strong acid, usually HF, followed by sulfonation and neutralization to yield dodecylbenzenesulfonate, the active ingredient.
By the early 1960s it became apparent that branched dodecylbenzene-based detergents, though very active and offering excellent detergency, did not biodegrade readily and were accumulating in our lake and river waters. The need for biodegradable detergents prompted the develop- ment of catalytic dehydrogenation of linear paraffins to linear olefins.
The work on catalytic reforming of naphtha with noble metal (Pt) catalysts done in the 1940s by Haensel [19] had clearly demonstrated that Pt-based catalysts had high activity for the dehydrogenation of paraffins to the corre- sponding olefins. In the 1960s Dr. Bloch [20] further extended this thinking by developing Pt-based catalysts that could selectively dehydrogenate heavy linear paraffins to the corresponding internal mono-olefins with high activity and stability and with minimum cracking. This was the basis for the UOP PacolTM process for the production of linear olefins for the manufacture of biodegradable detergents [21]. Independently Roth [22] at Monsanto developed a paraffin dehydrogenation catalyst and com- mercialized dehydrogenation alkylation combination for production of linear alkylbenzenes. There was only one plant built at Louisiana and now owned by Huntsmann Chemicals 3 Light Olefins In view of the successful application of Pt-based noble metal catalysts to the dehydrogenation of heavy paraffins it would seem that their extension to the production of light olefins would be a trivial undertaking. In reality, this is not the case.
Heavy paraffins are both valuable and highly prone to cracking. Therefore, in order to maintain a high selectivity and yield it is necessary to operate at relatively mild con- ditions, typically below 500 C and at relatively low per- pass conversions and higher H2 partial pressure. While this is economical for the production of heavy linear olefins, it is not for the production of light olefins.
Paraffin dehydrogenation is an endothermic reaction that is limited by chemical equilibrium and, according to Le Chateliers principle, higher conversion will require either higher temperatures or lower pressures. In a somewhat abbreviated form for the production of mono-olefins, this can be expressed as follows:xe Kp Kp  P where, xe is the equilibrium conversion, P is the total pressure in atmospheres absolute and Kp is the equilibrium constant for the dehydrogenation reaction. The equilibrium constant can be easily calculated from Gibbs free energies as tabulated in the API 44 report or in similar sources of thermodynamic data. Figures 2 and 3 illustrate the equi- librium conversion levels that can be obtained for propane at 1 and at 0.23 atm. abs. (175 torr), respectively.
The equilibrium constant for paraffin dehydrogenation increases significantly as the carbon number increases. The temperature required for the dehydrogenation of light paraffins is much higher than for heavy paraffins. For example, at 1 atm absolute pressure for 40 % conversion,the dehydrogenation of propane requires a temperature of at least about 580 C, while dodecane can be theoretically dehydrogenated to the same extent at only 450 C. The equilibrium conversion increases at higher temperatures,but side reactions, coke formation, and catalyst deactiva- tion also are accelerated. Thus, we cannot extrapolate directly from heavy olefins to light olefins without taking other factors into consideration.
Light olefins, especially ethylene and propylene, are made in very large steam cracking units using a variety of 100 90 80 70 60 50 40 30 20 10 0 627 727 827 927 1027 1127 Temperature, C

Modern facilities have capacities for up to 1.5 million MTA ethylene using a plurality of furnaces in parallel, each for a capacity of about 200,000 MTA ethylene, at very high severities in excess of 800 C and at high per-pass conver- sions and at rather low selectivities. For example, while the yield of ethylene from ethane cracking is close to 80 wt%,the yield drops to about 30 wt% for a naphtha feedstock.
More significantly, the yield of propylene is only 1317 wt% of the feed for practically all feedstocks, from propane to gas oil. Likewise, the yield of the C4 product from a steam cracking unit with a light naphtha feed is 811 wt% and about one half of that is butadiene [4].
Production of light olefins by the catalytic dehydroge- nation of light paraffins must be able to maintain reason- able per-pass conversion levels and high olefin selectivity.
Also, it must be able to produce olefins in high yields over long periods of times without shutdowns and with high operating efficiency. From what we saw above, this can pose a formidable challenge.
In the early 1970s UOP introduced continuous catalyst regeneration (CCR) technology that enabled noble metal catalysts to remain at their most desirable stable activity. In this mode, a small amount of the catalyst from the reactor is removed and sent to a separate regeneration vessel where carbon burning and platinum redistribution are completed.
This regenerated catalyst is returned to the top of the reactor. In this steady state continuous mode of operation the catalyst maintains constant activity. Use of CCR tech- nology makes it possible to operate a dehydrogenation catalyst at high severity without fear of coking and without the need to frequently shut down the reactor for catalyst regeneration. While CCR technology was first introduced for the UOP PlatformingTM catalytic reforming process, it has proven to be equally useful for the catalytic aromati- zation of LPG fractions such as in the UOP CyclarTM pro- cess and for the catalytic dehydrogenation of light paraffins.
The combination of noble metal catalysts operating at high severity in conjunction with CCR technology has made it possible to design, build, and operate very large catalytic dehydrogenation units that can produce light olefins, in particular propylene and isobutylene, at high selectivities and economically [23]. Not surprisingly, the world pro- pylene production capacity based on the use of catalytic dehydrogenation of propane has increased steadily over the past 20 years [24] with 2010 production of propylene via propane dehydrogenation at 3 million metric tons per year.
Use of the Oleflex process for the dehydrogenation of ethane to ethylene has also been investigated but, to date,the economics do not appear to be favorable because of the low equilibrium conversion and the need to operate under vacuum if a reasonable ethane conversion is to be expected.
The cost of fractionating ethylene in an ethane-ethylene splitter is otherwise too high. Dow Chemical has recently been awarded a patent [25] for the dehydrogenation of ethane over a metal-mordenite catalyst complex at rela- tively low-conversions in which the product ethylene is selectively recovered from the dilute ethylene-ethane stream by alkylating it with benzene.
As mentioned earlier lower partial pressure of reactant increases conversion achieved. Steam dehydrogenation is based on the idea that by adding steam the partial pressure of the paraffin can be lowered such that effectively the conversion level could be as much as that obtained under vacuum, but still operating at a superatmospheric level.
Two other potential benefits are that superheated steam can be used as a heat carrier to supply heat for the dehydroge- nation reaction and that steam interacts with coke deposits to maintain the catalyst free of coke and active.
This approach is used by Phillips Petroleum in devel- oping their STAR technology for isobutene dehydrogena- tion employing Pt-type catalyst and multi-tubular reactor design. This reactor design resembles a typical steam reformer that is operated until the catalyst deactivates as a result of coke deposition. This reactor is taken out of ser- vice for catalyst regeneration while a spare muti-tubular reactor is brought on-stream. The STAR technology is currently owned and licensed by Krupp-Uhde.
Steam dilution is also employed in dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene to styrene. Bricker and associates developed steam stable catalysts for propane and isobutene dehydro- genation in a high steam environment [26, 27].

C10C14
n-paraffins) are more complicated than are those in light paraffin dehydrogenation (e.g., propane and isobutane).
The main difference in reaction pathway is that a signifi- cant amount of cyclic compounds can form via dehydro- cyclization from heavy paraffins while this is not the case for light paraffins. Figures 4 and 5, respectively, illustrate possible reactions that take place on platinum (Pt) and acid (A) sites in the dehydrogenation of light and heavy paraf- fins when the catalyst is not selective, e.g., unmodified platinum catalysts supported on alumina.
The consecutive reactions, the dehydrogenation of mono- olefins to diolefins and triolefins, are catalyzed on the same active site as the dehydrogenation of paraffins to mono- olefins. Therefore, the consecutive reactions cannot be eliminated but can be suppressed not only by catalyst mod- ification but also by controlling the reaction kinetics. The conversion of triolefins to aromatics is a very fast reaction and thermodynamically favorable. Thus, the formation of aromatics from triolefins must also be suppressed kinetically.
3.2 Dehydrogenation Catalysts and Modifiers
The key role of dehydrogenation catalysts is to accelerate the main reaction and to control other reactions. Unmodi- fied alumina-supported platinum catalysts are highly active but are not selective to dehydrogenation. Various by- products, as indicated in Figs. 4 and 5, can also form. In addition, the catalyst rapidly deactivates because of fouling by heavy carbonaceous materials that forms coke on cat- alyst and blocks active platinum sites. Therefore, the properties of platinum and the alumina support need to be modified to suppress the formation of by-products and to increase catalytic stability.
The reaction of olefins on platinum is faster than that of paraffins because olefins interact with platinum more strongly than do paraffins. The role of platinum modifiers is to weaken the platinum-olefin interaction selectively without affecting the platinumparaffin interaction. The consecutive dehydrogenation rate of mono-olefins and di- olefins is decreased by this modification without lowering the rate of paraffin dehydrogenation significantly. The modifier also improves the stability against coking by heavy carbonaceous materials.
Alumina support has acidic sites that accelerate skeletal isomerization, cracking, oligomerization, and polymeriza- tion of olefinic materials, and enhances coke formation.
Therefore, acidity must be eliminated by a proper modifier to control these undesirable reactions.
Since first commercial operation of the PacolTMprocess in 1968, sevral catalytic advances have been made. Imai [28, 29] developed next generation modified Pt catalyst showing significantly lower coking and doubling the cat- alyst stability. For longer carbon chain paraffins diffusion also becomes a critical parameter and thus large pore low density support is need to access all Pt sites. Jensen [30, 31] further advanced the catalysis by introducing finely dis- persed thin Pt layer over an inert core and thus prepared next generation dehydrogenation catalyst. No catalyst development is complete unless a sound process design is wrapped around it that overcomes the techno-economic barrier for a commercial success. Vora [32, 33] developed a new radial flow reactor design.
The modified catalyst described above has high activity and high selectivity to mono-olefins. The major by-prod- ucts are diolefins that can be controlled kinetically. The coke formation is also suppressed, and therefore, sta- bility is greatly improved. Over the modified catalyst, the major reaction pathways for both light and heavy paraffin dehydrogenation systems are simpler (Fig. 6). n-Paraffin n- Olefin n-Diene Pt Pt

3.3 Dehydrogenation Catalyst Supports
Platinum is a highly active catalytic element and is not required in large quantities to catalyze the reaction when it is dispersed on a high surface-area support. The high dispersion is also necessary to achieve high selectivity to dehydrogena- tion relative to undesirable side reactions, such as cracking.
Among many high surface area materials, alumina is the support of choice. Alumina is relatively inert when it is modified properly, as described previously, and when the undesirable reactions are controlled. Alumina has excellent thermal stability and mechanical strength under processing,transport, and catalyst regeneration conditions. However,the most important reason why alumina is chosen as sup- port material is its superior capability of maintaining a high degree of platinum dispersion, which is essential for maintaining the dehydrogenation activity and selectivity.
The catalytic reaction rate is limited by the intraparticle mass transfer rate. If the mass transfer rate is relatively slow, both activity and selectivity are lowered. As a result,the support must have a low pore diffusional resistance.
The surface area and the strength of the support increase as the pore diameter decreases, and the pore diffusional resistance decreases as the pore diameter increases. Surface area retention with multiple regeneration cycles is also an important feature in selecting an optimal support material.
Thus, an appropriate pore structure must be determined for the support to achieve optimal catalytic performance.
The shape, strength, surface area, and surface smooth- ness are important factors in applying CCR process tech- nology, which consists of a moving-bed reactor and catalyst regenerator. A proprietary catalyst manufacturing technology developed by UOP meets the requirements for preparing high-strength, low-attrition spherical supports.
3.4 Preliminary Catalyst Evaluation
In the catalyst screening stage, a short-time test is con- ducted to determine activity and selectivity in a small fixed-bed reactor containing 5100 cc of catalyst.
In paraffin dehydrogenation employing a platinum cat- alyst, hydrogen is used as a co-feed to increase catalytic stability by suppressing undesirable consecutive reactions.
Thus, hydrogen also improves selectivity to the desired mono-olefins.
Reaction conditions, such as temperature, pressure, and hydrogen-to-paraffin feed ratio, are determined on the basis of chemical equilibrium analysis and testing of a reference catalyst. The most important data to be analyzed in the preliminary evaluation stage are the change of conversion as a function of time and the change of selectivity as a function of conversion. For instance, Fig. 7 shows the conversions of C10C14 n-paraffins obtained with DeH-5TM and DeH-7TM PacolTM dehydrogenation catalysts. DeH-7 catalyst is more stable than DeH-5.
The selectivity to the corresponding n-mono-olefins for DeH-7 catalyst is equivalent to DeH-5 catalyst, as shown in Fig. 8. The results indicate that DeH-7 has superior sta- bility and activity to that of DeH-5 and maintains equiva- lent selectivity to DeH-5 catalyst. Therefore, using DeH-7 n-Paraffin n- Olefin n-Diene Pt Pt

Selectivity varies as a function of conversion for a given set of operational variables. Therefore, understanding the rela- tionship between selectivity and these variables is important.
Selectivity decreases as the conversion increases because n- mono-olefins are consecutively converted into by-products.
The selectivity decreases sharply as conversion approaches equilibrium because the main dehydrogenation process is limited by equilibrium, but other reactions continue to occur.
Therefore, if side reactions are controlled, the selectivity is improved as the equilibrium conversion becomes higher by increasing the temperature and by decreasing the pressure and the feed ratio of hydrogen to paraffin.
Figure 9 shows simulated selectivities to n-heptene and n-heptadiene for the dehydrogenation of n-heptane. In this simulation, the relative rate constants used are unity, which represents that the catalyst possesses perfect selectivity regarding consecutive dehydrogenation; the dehydrogena- tion rate of paraffin is equal to that of mono-olefin and diolefin. Experimental selectivities obtained over a UOP dehydrogenation catalyst show that the catalyst has virtu- ally perfect selectivity for consecutive dehydrogenation steps, as seen in Fig. 9.
3.5 Catalyst Stability and Regeneration
Once an active and selective catalyst is developed, stability tests are conducted. The dehydrogenation of detergent- range paraffins is performed under relatively mild temperature conditions. Thus, the catalyst can maintain a long life even at high space velocity, and therefore, it is not economical to regenerate the catalyst. Because of the equilibrium limitation, the dehydrogenation of light par- affins requires significantly higher temperatures to achieve economically attractive conversion. The catalyst deactiva- tion is accelerated under high-temperature conditions, and therefore, frequent catalyst regeneration is necessary for light paraffin dehydrogenation. For the dehydrogenation of light paraffins, the UOP CCR technology is applied. In this mode, ultimate catalyst life of several years is achieved.
3.6 Heat of Reaction
The dehydrogenation of n-paraffins is an endothermic reac- tion with a heat of reaction of about 30 kcal/mol. Therefore, a significant temperature drop occurs in a commercial adiabatic reactor, which lowers the equilibrium conversion level. A multistage reactor system with interstage reheating is needed for light paraffin dehydrogenation. Figure 10 illustrates con- version, equilibrium conversion, and temperature along the catalyst bed in a three-stage reactor system for the dehydro- genation of isobutane. For propane dehydrogenation, a four- stage reactor system becomes more economical because higher average temperatures are needed.
Excessively high inlet temperatures can be avoided by employing the multistage reactor system as opposed to a single stage reactor system (Fig. 11). Thus, thermal cracking and catalyst deactivation, which are accelerated at higher temperatures, can be controlled to low levels.
3.7 Commercial Processes
The UOP Pacol TM process for selective dehydrogenation of C10C13 range linear paraffins to produce the corre- sponding linear mono-olefins is shown in Fig. 12 in com- bination with the UOP Detergent Alkylation process. The Pacol process consists of a radial-flow reactor and a product recovery section. Worldwide more than 3 million MTA LAB is produced employing this process [34].
As described earlier, the Houdry Catadiene process and the Catofin process make use of parallel reactor and operate in a cyclic mode. In this type of dehydrogenation process using chromia/alumina catalysts, the catalyst is in a fixed shallow bed located inside a reactor that may be spherical or often a horizontal cylinder. Significant quantity of inert materials, such as, various size of alumina or silica balls are used below and above the catalyst bed to support the cat- alyst and also to fill up the reactor. A significant amount of coke is deposited on the catalyst during the dehydrogena- tion step, such that a number of reactors are used in parallel with some being used for dehydrogenation while the others 100 50 2 n-C7 Conversion, % n-C7= Selectivity, mol-% 90 80 70 60 5 10 15 Experimental Data 20 25 30 100 50 n-C7== Selectivity, mol-% 90 80 70 60 Reaction: n-C7 n-C7= n-C7== Toluene

The dehydrogenation reactions are strongly endothermic, and in this process the heat is pro- vided by the sensible heat stored in the catalyst and the inert materials during regeneration. The length of the total reactor cycle is limited by the amount of heat available, and can be as short as 1030 min. Figure 13 illustrates a schematic of such a process.
Onstream time  purge time  regeneration time purge time  total cycle time Another cyclic process is Phillips STAR technology [35]. It uses a fixed-bed, fired-tube reactor operating at superatmospheric pressure with steam as a diluent to lower the partial pressure of the reactants in order to achieve reasonable conversion level. In many respects it is similar in design to a steam reforming furnace with the heat of reaction provided by firing outside tubes and thus operating at near isothermal condition. As of 2010 there are two small operating plants, 118,000 and 13,000 MTA, for the production of isobutylene from isobutene. As mentioned earlier, this technology is currently owned and licensed by Krupp-Uhde.
The UOP OleflexTM is more widely used process for propane and isobutene dehydrogenation. Figure 14 illus- trates the flow diagram of the UOP OleflexTM process. The process consists of a reactor section and a product recovery section. The reactor section consists of three or four stages of radial-flow reactors, charge and interstage heaters,reactor feed-effluent exchangers, and the CCR continuous catalyst regeneration unit (Fig. 15). Today more than 3 million MTA of propylene and 2 million MTA isobutene are produced via this route. In 2011 there are 11 operating UOP OleflexTM units for propane to propylene and six more for isobutane to isobutene, with five more in con- struction and design [36]. 4 Ethylbenzene Dehydrogenation As mentioned earlier, the ethylbenzene dehydrogenation reaction proceeds over an iron or an iron-chromium catalyst that usually also contains potassium in the form of potassium carbonate. The reaction takes place at 630 C temperature and pressure is usually subatmospheric for improved per- pass conversion. Steam dilution is practiced to further lower the partial pressure of the reactants. Because the reaction is strongly endothermic, various reaction stages with interheat and interstage addition of superheated steam are normally employed. Figure 16 illustrates a typical process scheme for the dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene to styrene.
In an interesting variant of the conventional process,part of the hydrogen that is produced in the first stage of conversion is selectively reacted with oxygen over a sep- arate bed of oxidation catalyst such that significant amounts of heat are released internally within the reactor system. The hydrogen oxidation catalyst is selected such that there is practically no conversion or degradation of either ethylbenzene or styrene to CO2 [37]. While this process could be thought of as an oxydehydrogenation process, in reality it is just a conventional dehydrogenation coupled with an oxidative reheat step. The alternative ethylbenzene dehydrogenation process, known commer- cially as SMARTTM (Styrene Monomer by Advanced Reheat Technology), was originally called the Styro-Plus process and initially demonstrated at Mitsubishi Chemi- cals, Kashima, Japan The SMART process is now licensed jointly by UOP LLC and ABB Lummus Global Inc.

Other approaches have also been considered in the past although none has reached to the level of commer- cialization. Some of the most notable are:• Halogenated dehydrogenation • Oxydehydrogenation Use of halogens for the dehydrogenation of paraffins has been proposed in different ways. For example, as noted earlier, heavy paraffins were first chlorinated and then dehydrochlorinated to heavy olefins commercially in the past both by Shell (CDC process) and by Hu ls, among others. Pyrolysis of methane in the presence of chlorine has been proposed by Prof. Benson [39] for the production of acetylene and ethylene.
Other chlorination/dehydro- chlorination cycles have been proposed for the production of ethylene from ethane.

Apart from the apparent corrosion prob- lems associated with the use of chlorine, other difficulties readily come to mind owing to the relatively high cost of chlorine, and even more so of iodine, and the need to either dispose of or recycle vast quantities of hydrogen chloride generated as a byproduct.
Oxydehydrogenation or oxidative dehydrogenation can be considered in at least two different ways:
Use of oxygen as a way to selectively oxidize the hydrogen coproduct from dehydrogenation, and thus to displace the dehydrogenation equilibrium to higher conversions. As mentioned earlier, this approach has also been used commercially in the catalytic dehydro- genation of ethylbenzene to styrene as in the UOP Styro-PlusTM process or in the ABB Lummus/UOP SMARTTM process. Vora [40] has shown a similar flow scheme where oxygen is used in between the multi-stage reactors to combust hydrogen and thus improve equilibrium for the propane or butane dehydrogenation.
Direct use of oxygen as a means of dehydrogenating, say,ethane to ethylene. Some interesting work in this area is currently being done by Prof. Schmidt [41] and his colleagues at the University of Minnesota in the United States, and also by Prof. Eliseo Ranzi and coworkers at the Polytechnic University of Milan, Italy. Ethylene production at greater than 85 % selectivity and 70 % ethane conversion has been claimed at a small experi- mental scale over a platinumtin catalyst. If these results can be extrapolated to a large scale commercial operation it could become an attractive alternative to conventional steam cracking of ethane since oxydehydrogenation units in principle could be much smaller than the very large capacities required in steam cracking furnaces.
Significant concerns exist however over the operating conditions reported by these research teams: (1) The relatively low ratio molar ratio of ethane:oxygen:hydro- gen s of 2:1:2 over a catalyst at about 950 C is potentially explosive, (2) the hydrogen feed require- ments is surprisingly high (although the research team claims that they can be balanced with the net production of hydrogen in the reaction), and (3) the operating conditions are exceedingly severe for most catalyst compositions all of which contribute to the unlikely commercial feasibility of such a process.
As indicated earlier, oxydehydrogenation found suc- cessful commercial application in the conversion of n- butenes to butadiene, but not yet for the production of ethylene or propylene.

The following types of reactor design are commercially proven for endothermic catalytic dehydrogenation processes:• Downflow adiabatic fixed bed • Radial flow fixed bed or moving bed adiabatic • Tubular isothermal • Fluidized bed The conventional choice in reactor design is the down- flow packed bed. Reactants, either vapor or vapor plus liquid, enter at the top of the catalyst bed and flow down through the catalyst. The main characteristics of the downflow reactor are:• Plug flow • Tendency for imperfect distribution of process flow • Relatively high pressure drop • Adiabatic: no temperature control • Inefficient use of the catalyst Pressure drop is the main disadvantage of the downflow reactor in many process applications, particularly in processes that require a low operating pressure and a large catalyst inventory. This pressure-drop concern was addressed by the introduction of the radial-flow reactor. Reactants in a radial- flow reactor normally enter the vessel from the top and then flow radially either inward or outward through an annular catalyst bed. The advantage of this design is that the flow path is short and the cross-sectional area is large, allowing a rea- sonable ratio of vessel length to diameter. Low pressure drops can be achieved because of the flow path through the packed bed can be kept short. Also, catalyst can easily be added and removed while the reactor is in operation. Characteristics of the radial flow reactor are:• Plug flow • Low pressure drop • Easy catalyst replacement • Adiabatic: no temperature control • Limited to single-phase operation The tubular reactor was developed to allow for heat transfer in the reactor bed. This reactor is essentially a shell and tube heat exchanger that has catalyst in the tubes and a heat transfer medium in the shell. Processes with high heats of reaction require long tube lengths to increase the nec- essary surface area. Tubular reactors loaded with conven- tional-shaped catalysts, spherical or extruded, have high pressure drops. Consequently, specialized catalyst shapes were developed to increase voidage and reduce pressure drop. However, reduced voidage increased the catalyst volume requirements. Large catalyst volumes can require many tubes (on the order of tens of thousands). Loading tubular reactors is a time-consuming and labor-intensive operation. Tubular reactors have these attributes:• Plug flow • Intrinsically high pressure drop that requires special catalyst shapes to minimize pressure drop. • Fabrication constraints of large tube sheets • Difficult to load and unload • Limited control of the reactor temperature profile The fluidized-bed reactor can mitigate the problem of pressure drop to an extent, but the catalyst recovery equipment can cause higher pressure drop. This reactor is approximately isothermal as a result of the high degree of mixing. Heat can be added or removed by heat exchange coils in the fluidized bed. Its main disadvantage is that the reaction is not plug flow. In addition, catalyst losses can be prohibitive if the catalyst is costly or is environmentally unsafe. A fluidized-bed reactor has these characteristics:

These include the production of light olefins,heavy olefins, and alkenylaromatics. Oxydehydrogenation,on the other hand, is still in the developmental stage but if successful holds great promise due to the potential energy savings of this process. For the production of heavy olefins,selective paraffin dehydrogenation over noble metal cata- lysts has proven to be the preferred and dominant route.
When only one or two light olefins are desired, in par- ticular propylene or isobutylene or perhaps a mixture of propylene and isobutylene, catalytic dehydrogenation over noble metal catalysts has acquired a significant and grow- ing market share.
Finally, the choice of reactor plays an important role in securing the success of a catalytic process. Pressure drop,heat transfer, and the ability to move or to regenerate the catalyst all must be taken into account in the process development and design stages.
