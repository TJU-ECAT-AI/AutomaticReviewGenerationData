1.Light olefins, such as propylene and ethylene, are the top two largest volume petrochemical intermediates. Ethylene is primarily produced through the thermal cracking of ethane, LPG, and heavier feedstocks. Propylene is a byproduct of thermal cracking of LPG and heavier feedstocks. Over the past two decades, the growth rate of propylene demand has outpaced conventional supply routes, leading to the construction of commercial units for selective catalytic dehydrogenation of propane to propylene. Isobutane dehydrogenation units were also built in the 1990s to produce isobutylene, which is then converted to MTBE or dimerized and hydrogenated to produce isooctane, a high octane gasoline blending component. The production of light olefins is thermodynamically challenging due to the high temperatures required for dehydrogenation of light paraffins compared to heavy paraffins. For example, at 1 atm absolute pressure for 40% conversion, the dehydrogenation of propane requires a temperature of at least about 580 C, while dodecane can be theoretically dehydrogenated to the same extent at only 450 C.

1.轻烯烃，如丙烯和乙烯，是前两大最大体积的石化中间体。乙烯主要通过乙烷、LPG和重质原料的热裂解生产。丙烯是LPG和重质原料热裂解的副产品。在过去二十年中，丙烯需求的增长率超过了传统供应路线，导致了选择性催化脱氢生产丙烯的商业装置的建设。在1990年代，还建造了异丁烷脱氢装置，用于生产异丁烯，然后将其转化为MTBE或二聚化并氢化以生产异辛烷，这是一种高辛烷值汽油调和组分。轻烯烃的生产在热力学上具有挑战性，因为轻质烷烃脱氢所需的高温与重质烷烃相比更高。例如，在1 atm绝对压力下，40%转化率时，丙烷脱氢需要至少580 C的温度，而十二烷在理论上可以在仅450 C的温度下脱氢到相同的程度。

1.Ethylene and propylene are the first and second largest volume petrochemical intermediates. For ethylene, the primary production route is the thermal cracking of ethane, LPG, and heavier feedstocks. This process also yields a significant amount of propylene as a byproduct. However, in the past two decades, the growth rate of propylene demand has outpaced the conventional supply routes, leading to the construction of commercial units for the selective catalytic dehydrogenation of propane to propylene. In the 1990s, several isobutane dehydrogenation units were built, producing isobutylene, which was then converted to MTBE or dimerized and hydrogenated to produce isooctane, a high-octane gasoline blending component. The equilibrium conversion of light olefins increases at higher temperatures, but this also accelerates side reactions, coke formation, and catalyst deactivation. Therefore, the production of light olefins cannot be directly extrapolated from the production of heavy olefins without considering other factors.

1.乙烯和丙烯是第一和第二大的石化中间体。对于乙烯，主要的生产路线是乙烷、LPG和更重的原料的热裂解。这个过程也产生大量的丙烯作为副产品。然而，在过去的二十年里，丙烯需求的增长速度超过了传统的供应路线，导致了用于选择性催化脱氢的商业单位的建设，将丙烷转化为丙烯。在1990年代，建立了几个异丁烷脱氢装置，生产异丁烯，然后转化为MTBE或二聚化和氢化，以生产异辛烷，这是一种高辛烷值的汽油混合成分。轻质烯烃的平衡转化率在较高温度下增加，但这也会加速副反应、焦炭形成和催化剂失活。因此，轻质烯烃的生产不能直接从重质烯烃的生产中推断出来，而不考虑其他因素。
