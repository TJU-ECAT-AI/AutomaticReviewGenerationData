[2] "For ethylene thermal cracking of ethane, LPG and heavier feedstocks continues to be the primary route."
[3] "However, over the past two decades propylene growth rate has out-paced these conventional supply routes leading to construction of number of com- mercial units for selective catalytic dehydrogenation of propane to propylene."

[7] "For example, at 1 atm absolute pressure for 40 % conversion,the dehydrogenation of propane requires a temperature of at least about 580 C, while dodecane can be theoretically dehydrogenated to the same extent at only 450 C."

1.Light olefins, such as propylene and ethylene, are the top two largest volume petrochemical intermediates. Ethylene is primarily produced through the thermal cracking of ethane, LPG, and heavier feedstocks. Propylene production has seen a growth rate that outpaces conventional supply routes over the past two decades, leading to the construction of commercial units for selective catalytic dehydrogenation of propane to propylene. Isobutane dehydrogenation units have also been built during the 1990s to produce isobutylene, which is then converted to MTBE or dimerized and hydrogenated to produce isooctane, a high octane gasoline blending component. The production of light olefins is thermodynamically challenging due to the high temperatures required for dehydrogenation, which increases significantly with decreasing alkane chain length. For instance, propane dehydrogenation requires a temperature of at least 580 C for 40% conversion, while dodecane can be dehydrogenated to the same extent at a much lower temperature of 450 C.

1.轻烯烃，如丙烯和乙烯，是前两大最大体积的石化中间体。乙烯主要通过乙烷、LPG和重质原料的热裂解生产。在过去二十年中，丙烯的生产增长率超过了这些传统供应路线，导致了选择性催化脱氢将丙烷转化为丙烯的商业装置的建设。在1990年代，还建造了几个异丁烷脱氢装置，生产异丁烯，然后将其转化为MTBE或二聚化并氢化以生产异辛烷，这是一种高辛烷值汽油调和组分。轻烯烃的生产在热力学上具有挑战性，因为脱氢所需的高温随着烷烃链长度的减小而显著增加。例如，丙烷脱氢在40%转化率下至少需要580 C的温度，而十二烷在相同程度的脱氢下仅需450 C的温度。
