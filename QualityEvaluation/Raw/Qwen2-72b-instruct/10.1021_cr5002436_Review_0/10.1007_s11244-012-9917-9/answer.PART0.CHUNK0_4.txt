1.Light olefins, such as propylene and ethylene, are the largest volume petrochemical intermediates. Ethylene is primarily produced through the thermal cracking of ethane, LPG, and heavier feedstocks. Propylene production has seen a growth rate that outpaces conventional supply routes, leading to the construction of commercial units for the selective catalytic dehydrogenation of propane to propylene. Isobutane dehydrogenation units have also been built to produce isobutylene, which is then converted to MTBE or dimerized and hydrogenated to produce isooctane, a high octane gasoline blending component. The dehydrogenation of paraffins is limited by chemical equilibrium, with higher conversion requiring either higher temperatures or lower pressures. The equilibrium constant for paraffin dehydrogenation increases significantly as the carbon number increases. The temperature required for the dehydrogenation of light paraffins is much higher than for heavy paraffins. For example, at 1 atm absolute pressure for 40% conversion, the dehydrogenation of propane requires a temperature of at least about 580 C, while dodecane can be theoretically dehydrogenated to the same extent at only 450 C.

1.轻烯烃，如丙烯和乙烯，是最大的石化中间体。乙烯主要通过乙烷、LPG和重质原料的热裂解生产。丙烯的生产增长率超过了传统的供应路线，导致了用于选择性催化脱氢的商业单位的建设，将丙烷转化为丙烯。还建造了异丁烷脱氢装置，用于生产异丁烯，然后将其转化为MTBE或二聚化并氢化，以生产异辛烷，这是一种高辛烷值汽油混合组分。脱氢反应受化学平衡的限制，更高的转化率需要更高的温度或更低的压力。随着碳数的增加，烷烃脱氢的平衡常数显著增加。轻质烷烃的脱氢所需的温度远高于重质烷烃。例如，在1 atm绝对压力下，40%转化率时，丙烷的脱氢需要至少580 C的温度，而十二烷在理论上可以在仅450 C的温度下脱氢到相同的程度。
