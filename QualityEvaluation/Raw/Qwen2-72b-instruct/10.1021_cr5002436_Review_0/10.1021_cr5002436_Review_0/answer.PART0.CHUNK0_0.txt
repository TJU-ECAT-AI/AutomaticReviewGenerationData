[1] "Because of their extensive use as chemical building blocks, light olefins, such as propylene (propene) and ethylene (ethene), are among the most important types of compounds in the chemical industry. Light olefins are the feedstock employed in the production of a vast array of chemicals, including polymers (e.g., polyethylene and polypropylene), oxygenates (e.g., ethylene glycol, acetaldehyde, acetone, and propylene oxide), and important chemical intermediates (e.g., ethylbenzene and propionaldehyde)."
[2] "The demand of these building blocks has increased steadily over the last years, all major markets registering a positive growth in demand and production in recent years with the exception of the Eurozone, due to the effects of the recent economic downturn."
[3] "Steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) of naphtha, light diesel, and other oil byproducts are the most common methods for obtaining these light olefins."
[4] "The reaction is thermodynamically limited and highly endothermic, which, according to Le Chateliers principle, implies that higher reaction temperature and/or lower paraffin partial pressure are needed to achieve high conversions."
[5] "Indeed, temperatures of 550750 C are typically required in the dehydrogenation of C2C4 paraffins to obtain alkane conversions 50% at 1 bar (see Figure 8)."
[6] "Moreover, given that the enthalpy required to dehydrogenate alkanes decreases as the chain becomes longer (ΔH2980 = 137 kJ mol1 for ethane, 124.3 kJ mol1 for propane, and 117.6 kJ mol1 for isobutane dehydrogenation), a considerably larger amount of energy is required to dehydrogenate light paraffins on a mass basis."

Light olefins, such as propylene and ethylene, are crucial components in the chemical industry, serving as building blocks for a wide range of products including polymers, oxygenates, and chemical intermediates. The demand for these compounds has been on a steady rise in major markets, except for the Eurozone, which has been affected by economic downturns. Steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) are the primary methods for producing light olefins, involving the processing of naphtha, light diesel, and other oil byproducts. The synthesis of light olefins is thermodynamically challenging, requiring high temperatures (550-750°C) and low pressures to achieve significant conversions, especially for C2-C4 paraffins. The energy demand for dehydrogenation increases with the length of the alkane chain, necessitating more energy for the conversion of light paraffins.

轻烯烃，如丙烯和乙烯，在化学工业中是至关重要的组成部分，作为广泛产品的构建块，包括聚合物、含氧化合物和化学中间体。除了受到经济衰退影响的欧元区，这些化合物在主要市场的需求一直在稳步上升。蒸汽裂解和流化催化裂化（FCC）是生产轻烯烃的主要方法，涉及对石脑油、轻柴油和其他石油副产品的加工。轻烯烃的合成在热力学上具有挑战性，需要高温（550-750°C）和低压力来实现C2-C4石蜡的显著转化。随着烷烃链长度的增加，脱氢作用的能量需求增加，这需要更多的能量来转化轻石蜡。
