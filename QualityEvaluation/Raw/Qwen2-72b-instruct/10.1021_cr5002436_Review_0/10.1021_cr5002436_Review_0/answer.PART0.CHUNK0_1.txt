[1] "Because of their extensive use as chemical building blocks, light olefins, such as propylene (propene) and ethylene (ethene), are among the most important types of compounds in the chemical industry. Light olefins are the feedstock employed in the production of a vast array of chemicals, including polymers (e.g., polyethylene and polypropylene), oxygenates (e.g., ethylene glycol, acetaldehyde, acetone, and propylene oxide), and important chemical intermediates (e.g., ethylbenzene and propionaldehyde)."
[2] "The demand of these building blocks has increased steadily over the last years, all major markets registering a positive growth in demand and production in recent years with the exception of the Eurozone, due to the effects of the recent economic downturn."
[3] "Steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) of naphtha, light diesel, and other oil byproducts are the most common methods for obtaining these light olefins."
[4] "The reaction is thermodynamically limited and highly endothermic, which, according to Le Chateliers principle, implies that higher reaction temperature and/or lower paraffin partial pressure are needed to achieve high conversions."
[5] "Indeed, temperatures of 550750 C are typically required in the dehydrogenation of C2C4 paraffins to obtain alkane conversions 50% at 1 bar (see Figure 8)."
[6] "Moreover, given that the enthalpy required to dehydrogenate alkanes decreases as the chain becomes longer (ΔH2980 = 137 kJ mol1 for ethane, 124.3 kJ mol1 for propane, and 117.6 kJ mol1 for isobutane dehydrogenation), a considerably larger amount of energy is required to dehydrogenate light paraffins on a mass basis."

Light olefins, such as propylene and ethylene, are crucial components in the chemical industry, serving as building blocks for a wide range of products including polymers, oxygenates, and chemical intermediates. The demand for these compounds has been on a steady rise in major markets, except for the Eurozone which was affected by an economic downturn. Steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking are the primary methods for producing light olefins. The synthesis of these olefins is thermodynamically challenging, requiring high temperatures and low pressures to achieve high conversions due to the endothermic nature of the dehydrogenation reaction. For instance, temperatures between 550 and 750 degrees Celsius are typically needed to convert C2 to C4 paraffins into olefins at a conversion rate of over 50% at 1 bar. Additionally, the energy required for dehydrogenation decreases as the alkane chain lengthens, meaning that more energy is needed to dehydrogenate light paraffins on a mass basis.

轻烯烃，如丙烯和乙烯，在化学工业中是至关重要的组成部分，作为广泛产品系列的构建块，包括聚合物、含氧化合物和化学中间体。除了受经济衰退影响的欧元区外，这些化合物的需求在主要市场中一直在稳步上升。蒸汽裂解和流化催化裂化是生产轻烯烃的主要方法。这些烯烃的合成在热力学上具有挑战性，由于脱氢反应的吸热性质，需要高温和低压才能实现高转化率。例如，通常需要在550到750摄氏度之间的温度将C2到C4的石蜡转化为烯烃，转化率超过50%，在1巴下。此外，脱氢所需的能量随着烷链长度的增加而减少，这意味着在质量基础上，需要更多的能量来脱氢轻石蜡。
