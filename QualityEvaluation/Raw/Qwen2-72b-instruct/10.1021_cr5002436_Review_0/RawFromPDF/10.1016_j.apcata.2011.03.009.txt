Steam cracking of hydrocarbons has been the major source of light oleﬁns for more than half a century.
The recent studies have reported that ethylene and propylene can also be produced through the cracking
of hydrocarbons over modiﬁed ZSM-5 zeolites in a considerable amount.
This paper highlights the important current ideas about acid-catalyzed hydrocarbon cracking that has
resulted in high yield of ethylene and propylene. Light oleﬁn production via catalytic cracking of various
industrial feedstocks, ranging from heavy hydrocarbons to ethane, over modiﬁed ZSM-5 zeolites, has
been reviewed in the present paper. Furthermore, the inﬂuence of various employed promoters, i.e.,
alkali and alkaline earth, transition, rare earth elements, and phosphorus, on the chemical properties of
the modiﬁed ZSM-5 and the performance of resulting catalyst in enhancing the selectivity to light oleﬁns,
have been addressed. Moreover, the inﬂuences of different factors, including the zeolite acidity, Si/Al ratio
and the temperature, on the light oleﬁn production and the reaction scheme have been speciﬁed. The
role of incorporated element in the catalytic cracking mechanism is also summarized.

1. Introduction
Steam cracking of hydrocarbons has been the major source of
light oleﬁns and dioleﬁns for more than half a century. The yield
of ethylene and propylene varies between 24–55% and 1.5–18%,
respectively depending greatly on the feedstock type and oper-
ating condition [1–4]. It is the ﬁrst energy-consuming process in
petrochemical industry in spite of the improvements that have
been made in this process. It requires high reaction temperature
800–880 ◦C that accounts for 40% of the total energy consum-
ing every year in the entire petrochemical industry and results
in high amount of CO2 emission [5–7]. The development of tech-
nologies that not only maximize energy and resource-savings but
also minimize CO2 emissions is stimulated by global environ-
mental issues. Moreover, the additional disadvantages of steam
cracking are the limited control over the P/E (propylene to ethy-
lene) ratios in the oleﬁns coming from steam crackers and its
direct dependence on the feed type, whilst the demand for propy-
lene is growing faster than that for ethylene [3,8–10]. Hence,
the processes capable of controlling the ratio of light oleﬁns
are preferred [3,8–10]. The catalytic cracking of hydrocarbons
has attracted researchers’ attention to overcome the mentioned
disadvantages.
The catalytic cracking of various types of hydrocarbons have
been investigated over the modiﬁed HZSM-5 zeolites in order to
enhance light oleﬁn production. The reaction occurs at 550–650 ◦C
that is about 200 ◦C lower than steam cracking, and the yields of
ethylene and propylene are high enough to compete with the steam
cracking products. It is noteworthy that the effect of feed type on
the light oleﬁns ratio is not as prominent as the steam cracking
and the ratios of P/E could be controlled by adjusting the acid type,
acid strength, and acid distribution, i.e. Lewis/Brønsted (L/B) acid
sites, as well as the operating condition. Moreover, researchers have
attempted to establish the fundamental technologies for catalyst
design and preparation in order to commercialize the industrial
processes in this ﬁeld.
In the present paper, light oleﬁn production via catalytic
cracking of various industrial types of hydrocarbons, i.e., heavy
feedstocks, naphtha range, and gaseous feedstocks, over modiﬁed
ZSM-5 zeolites has been reviewed; furthermore, the latest activities
accomplished in this regard are highlighted. The review has merely
focused on ZSM-5 type zeolite because the promising results of light
oleﬁn production have been mostly achieved over this pentasil type
structure. In other words, this paper does not cover all the differ-
ent catalytic cracking researches carried out using various types of
hydrocarbons and/or zeolite structures.
In addition, the function of various employed promoters on the
chemical properties, and the performance of the resulting catalyst
in enhancing the selectivity to light oleﬁns have been addressed.
Moreover, the inﬂuence of different factors such as, the zeolite
acidity, the Si/Al ratio and the operating condition on the reaction
scheme has been speciﬁed. It also summarizes some relevant ideas
regarding the role of incorporated elements in the catalytic cracking
mechanism in order to shed light on this process. It is notewor-
thy that the catalytic dehydrogenation processes are not included
in this paper and it also excludes cycloalkanes, unsaturated and
aromatic hydrocarbons.
2. Summary of historical aspects
Great effort has been dedicated to the researches on developing
a novel process that can overcome the deﬁciencies of steam crack-
ing. Different types of catalysts (basic catalysts, transition metal
oxide catalysts and acidic catalysts) have been studied in the cat-
alytic cracking of hydrocarbons to achieve higher yields of light
oleﬁns [3,5,11].
The use of metal oxides such as CaO, A12O3, SrO, MgO, TiO2,
MnO2, Mn2O3, ZrO2, K2O, and In2O3, in oleﬁn production has been
investigated since 1960. An ethylene yield of 24–40% and a propy-
lene yield of 15–22% have been obtained over metal oxide catalysts
depending on the feed type and the reaction condition [11–17].
The calcium aluminate (12CaO–7Al2O3) loaded with K2CO3, and
potassium vanadate (KVO3) on alumina creates the most promising
result. Compared with the conventional steam cracking, the yield
of ethylene from naphtha was enhanced by 5–10%, at 770–820 ◦C
[11,13,14,18].
In spite of using the catalyst, the reaction temperature is not
reduced considerably, and the higher yield of ethylene is not
probably a result of catalytic ethylene production. However, it
is due to the improved heat transfer because of surface/volume
effect [18,19] and the enhanced rate of coke and heavy hydro-
carbons gasiﬁcation reactions, which produce high amount of
CO and CO2 [11,13,20] about 5–20% [3]. This concept (catalytic
reforming of gasiﬁed coke) have been also applied in combina-
tion with steam cracking as coatings on the wall of pyrolysis
reactors [21,22], e.g. Linde/Veba’s thermocatalytic PYROCAT pro-
cess [23] and/or tube inserts [20,24–27], in order to lessen the
tendency of carbon to deposit on metal surface and increase
light oleﬁn production. The processes of VNIIOS, Toyo engi-
neering, and LG petrochemical have been developed based on
the metal oxide catalysts [11], but the catalyst deactivation at
elevated reaction temperatures, great amount of steam consump-
tion [3], and high rate of coke formation are critical issues
that have decreased the energy efﬁciency of these processes
[11].
The most active and widely investigated catalysts for hydro-
carbon cracking are solid proton-donor acids, including zeolites,
which are the key components of industrial petroleum cracking
catalysts [28]. Light oleﬁn production through catalytic cracking
of hydrocarbons using zeolites was ﬁrstly studied by Pop et al.
over bifunctional Ag/Cu/Co–mordenite–Al2O3, at 600–750 ◦C [29].
They obtained ethylene and propylene yields of 8–41% and 11–17%,
respectively, in the catalytic cracking of raw materials from n-
butane to oil cuts (boiling point >500 ◦C) [29]. Early studies on
zeolitic catalysts resulted in low ethylene (15–27%) but high propy-
lene (15–50%) and aromatic (11–34%) yields, at lower temperatures
compared with the conventional steam cracking process [3].
To our knowledge, few reports exist concerning the catalytic
cracking of hydrocarbons over zeolites with the aim of light oleﬁn
production before 1990. Less attention has been dedicated to cat-
alytic production of light oleﬁns speciﬁcally ethylene, over zeolites
because of the fully developed industrial steam cracking process
[30]. The recent researchers (after 1990) have focused on formu-
lating a catalyst that could improve the selectivity to both ethylene
and propylene in catalytic cracking of hydrocarbons.

3. Why zeolites?
Zeolitic materials are being extensively used in three major cat-
alytic reactions in the area of petroleum reﬁning, petrochemicals
and pollution control [31]. Zeolites, e.g. ZSM-5, are active catalysts
and/or supports for a variety of reactions such as cracking, alkyla-
tion, aromatization, isomerization of hydrocarbons, etc., owing to
their activity, shape selectivity [30,32–36], ion-exchanging prop-
erties and special pore structure, such as the tri-dimensional
micro-pore topology and large speciﬁc surface area in ZSM-5
[37–42]. Zeolites have not yet been employed for on-purpose oleﬁn
production through catalytic cracking of hydrocarbons because of
the existing well-established industrial steam cracking process;
nevertheless, they play an important role in the oleﬁn indus-
try, especially in the processes that are under development or
improvement, in order to meet the requirements for more efﬁcient
technologies [30].
4. Producing light oleﬁns via catalytic cracking of various
hydrocarbons over modiﬁed ZSM-5 zeolites
The production of light oleﬁns through catalytic cracking of dif-
ferent types of industrial feeds, i.e. heavy feedstocks, naphtha range,
and gaseous feedstocks, are reported in the following sections.
4.1. Heavy feedstocks
Steam cracking is still the most reliable and efﬁcient commercial
process for the production of light oleﬁns, speciﬁcally ethylene [43].
The primary sources of propylene have been as a byproduct from
steam cracking and reﬁnery ﬂuid catalytic cracking (FCC) units. The
conventional FCC technology results in the yield of propylene and
ethylene about 3–6 wt.% and 1–2 wt.%, respectively [11,30]. Cur-
rently, about 30% of the world’s propylene is supplied by reﬁnery
FCC operations, 60–65% is co-produced from steam cracking, and
the remaining is produced on-purpose using metathesis or propane
dehydrogenation processes [9,43,44]. The projected growth rate
of propylene demand is estimated at 4–5%/year [44]. At present,
the FCC modiﬁed processes (FCC family techniques) accounts for
one third of the total propylene supply; thus, it is indispensable
to optimize or improve propylene production in these processes
[2,10,43,45–48].
The addition of ZSM-5 to an FCC catalyst is one of the efﬁ-
cient methods for improving the yield of light oleﬁns [49,50]
because it provides reﬁners with a high degree of ﬂexibility to opti-
mize the production output [51,52]. Utilizing HZSM-5 as a hybrid
catalyst, results in minimizing hydrogen transfer reactions, so it
hinders bimolecular reactions; consequently, enhances cracking
over hydrogen transfer due to its shape selective sinusoidal pore
structure [52,53]. Moreover, its acidity signiﬁcantly inﬂuences on
selectivity, given that high acidity enhances the cracking of high
molecular weight oleﬁns into the gasoline range, whereas low acid-
ity enhances the isomerization of oleﬁns, especially those of 4–6 C
atoms [52]. When ZSM-5 is added to the FCC unit, the main reac-
tions it catalyzes are C+
5 oleﬁn isomerization and cracking; thus,
the yield of C−
5 increases while that of C+
7 oleﬁns and parafﬁns
decreases. The high C=
3 /C=
4 ratio is observed over ZSM-5 additives
with enhanced activity [54].
The FCC family technologies, such as MAXOFIN developed by
Kellogg Brown & Root, Inc. (KBR) and Mobil Technology Com-
pany [9,55], UOP’s PetroFCC [56], UOP’s Fluidized Light Oleﬁn
Catalytic Cracking (FLOCC), ABB Lummus’ Selective Catalytic Crack-
ing (SCC), RIPP/Sinopec’s Deep Catalytic Cracking (DCCI & II) [10],
RIPP/Sinopec’s and Stone & Webster’s Catalytic Pyrolysis Process
(CPP) [57–59], and Grace Davison’s HPFCC (High Propylene Fluid
Catalytic Cracking) [60], have been commercialized and industrial
plants are established based on the mentioned technologies. Vac-
uum gas oil (VGO), VGO blended with residual oil, cocker gas oil,
deasphalted oil, and atmospheric residue are among the industrial
feedstocks used in these technologies [2,11,45,61,62]. The yield of
ethylene in the ﬁrst ﬁve mentioned processes is typically less than
6 wt.% [11] because of the fast aromatization reactions, but they can
yield up to 15–25 wt.% propylene [2,11,48,59], while in the former
ones the combined yield of ethylene and propylene above 40% has
been obtained [11,57,58].
4.2. Naphtha range feedstocks
Naphtha is currently one of the dominant feedstocks used
worldwide in steam cracking [2]. In a typical naphtha cracker,
ethylene and propylene yield varies in the range of 25–32.4% and
15.3–16.5%, respectively, with regards to the operating condition
[1]. It is one of the most attractive feedstocks for investigating the
production of light oleﬁns via catalytic cracking because it behaves
as an intermediate product of heavy oil catalytic cracking, and its
study could also provide further understandings of the FCC pro-
cess [63,64]. It can also take advantage of the present facilities that
are used for steam cracking [63]. The properties of typical naphtha
feedstocks are presented in Table 1 [3].
Yoshimura et al. conducted a comprehensive research study on
the catalytic cracking of naphtha to produce light oleﬁns under
the national project called “Development of a next-generation
chemical process technology” that was undertaken from 1995 to
1999, in Japan. They investigated oxidative cracking over basic
catalysts (aerobic reaction), oxidative and non-oxidative cracking
over transition metal catalysts (aerobic/non-aerobic reaction) and
catalytic cracking over solid acid catalysts (non-aerobic reaction),
and achieved promising results over a newly developed zeolite-
based La2O3-P/ZSM-5 (Si/A1 = 200) catalyst. The developed catalyst
could create both a sufﬁcient stability and high yield of ethylene
(34 wt.%) and propylene (23 wt.%), at 650 ◦C (in the presence of
steam), which is about 10% higher than the conventional steam
cracking process operated at around 820 ◦C [3]. Furthermore, the
feasibility study for naphtha processing capacity of 3000 tons/day
indicated that the ﬁxed-bed type catalytic cracking unit can reduce
energy consumption by more than 20% per ton of ethylene plus
propylene and hence decrease CO2 emission by approximately
20% [3].
It was observed that the La loading (Section 5.4) was apparently
the major cause of the lower aromatics formation [3] which was
different from the results obtained by Wei et al. to some extent.
They observed that over La/ZSM-5 (Si/A1 = 72), more than 50% of
naphtha was transferred to BTX indicating that hydrogen transfer
is more prominent. While, the lower yield of BTX and the higher
yields of light oleﬁns were achieved over the other catalysts mod-
iﬁed with the incorporation of P specially and the other elements:
Mg, Ca, and Cu (Table 2). The modiﬁcation of ZSM-5 zeolites with
Co, Ni, Fe and Zn suppressed the BTX generation, although the
yield of ethylene and propylene also decreased to some extent [5].
Nevertheless, they also achieved the best results over P-La/ZSM-
5 (Si/A1 = 72) catalyst with C=
2 + C=
3 yield of about 57–60%, at the
beginning 10 h. The test of stability (at various times on stream)
indicated that over P-La/ZSM-5, the C=
2 + C=
3 yield was kept higher
than 50% for 30 h, while the yield of 47% at the beginning 1 h of the
reaction decreased to 31%, over 10 h on HZSM-5 [5]. The catalytic
cracking reactions under the steam condition (without N2 stream)
compared to the results without steam, produced more light oleﬁns
over the sample of P/, Mg/, Ca/, Sr/, Cu/ZSM-5, especially for P/ZSM-
5 (C=
2 + C=
3 = 57%); furthermore, the BTX yield decreased greatly.
This suggested that the associated steam improves the yield of light
oleﬁns by suppressing the generation of BTX and light parafﬁns (i.e.

The synergistic effect of lanthanum and phosphorous is
concluded to be prominent to obtain promising results over P-
La/ZSM-5 for light oleﬁn production. Adopting both the rare earth
and phosphorus to modify the zeolite might result in the formation
of RE–P–O oxides that precipitate on the outer surface of zeolite
and cover some parts of surface acid sites [65]. Lanthanum also
stabilizes P species in the zeolite from leaching in steam at high
temperatures. The modiﬁcation of zeolite with rare earth metal
and phosphorus altogether, reduces the surface acidity owing to
the interaction of rare earth cation and phosphate anion [65,66].
The distinct inﬂuences of rare earth elements and phosphorus on
ZSM-5 zeolites are reported in Sections 5.4 and 5.5 of this paper,
respectively.
The ﬂuorinated HZSM-5 zeolites (F/HZSM-5) could be an effec-
tive catalyst for the catalytic cracking of naphtha to light oleﬁns. The
F-Modiﬁed HZSM-5 samples were prepared by immersing HZSM-
5 (Si/Al = 46) zeolite in an aqueous solution of NH4F. Feng. et al.
observed that the maximum propylene and ethylene yields reached
36.4% and 20.2%, respectively, at 600 ◦C (over 0.1F/HZSM-5 which
possessed the largest Brønsted acid amount) that were 7.3 and 4.3%
higher than those over the parent HZSM-5 zeolite [63]. The FT-IR
of pyridine adsorption on F/HZSM-5 revealed that the modiﬁcation
with ﬂuorine remarkably enhances the acid amount of HZSM-5.
The BET surface area and the pore volume of F/HZSM-5 increased,
mainly due to increase in the micropores. The ﬂuorine modiﬁca-
tion not only regulates the pore characteristics of HZSM-5 zeolites
but also modulates the amount of acid sites, especially the den-
sity of Brønsted acidity which could be favorable for obtaining a
high conversion of naphtha and high selectivity to light oleﬁns
[63]. Mao et al. found that F-ion-exchanged ZSM-5 zeolite shows an
enhanced surface acidity because of the formation of new Brønsted
acid sites and the strengthening of some acid sites of the parent zeo-
lite. They ascribed it to the proton attack of the zeolite surface by
the chemisorbed H+F−ion pair. Under these preparation conditions,
the zeolite framework structure is fully preserved [67].
Han et al. carried out the catalytic cracking of heavy naph-
tha for the selective formation of light oleﬁns over various types
of zeolites, i.e. HZSM-5 (Si/Al = 20, 25, 40, and 75), H-mordenite
(Si/A1 = 12.5), H-beta (Si/Al = 150), and SAPO-11. The yields of C=

13.3%, respectively, while that over HZSM-5 (20) was 37.5% (naph-
tha/steam (w/w) = 2, weight hourly space velocity (WHSV) = 5 h−1,
T = 650 ◦C). Among the various types of catalysts, HZSM-5 was found
to be the most effective catalyst for light oleﬁn production. They
obtained the maximum yield of C=
2 + C=
3 about 48.5 wt.% (C=
2 /C=
3 =
0.90) over HZSM-5 with the lowest Si/Al = 20 ratio [7]. The propy-
lene can be produced selectively through the catalytic cracking of
heavy naphtha over HZSM-5 without the loss of total oleﬁn yield
[7].
Hayim Abrevaya investigated the cracking of naphtha range
alkanes and naphthenes over a series of 8–12-MR (member ring)
zeolitic catalysts to verify the relationship between the zeo-
lite topology and naphtha cracking activity. The highest yields
of light oleﬁns were obtained over 10-MR zeolites such as
ferrierite at 650 ◦C with 83% naphtha conversion and 54 wt.%
selectivity to the ethylene and propylene. The relative activi-
ties and selectivities indicated that the activity ranking for the
catalysts at 650 ◦C was: beta (Si/Al = 66), ZSM-22 (Si/Al = 62) > ZSM-
23 (Si/Al = 89) > EU-1 (Si/Al = 70) > ZSM-35 (Si/Al = 19), ferrierite
(Si/Al = 71) > Y (Si/Al = 81) [68]. The C=
2 + C=
3 selectivity ranking for
the catalysts was: ferrierite > ZSM-22, ZSM-23 > ZSM-35, Y > EU-
1 > beta [68]. 12-MR zeolites favor bimolecular hydride transfer
pathways, which eventually increase the selectivity to light alkanes
and coke at the expense of ethylene and propylene [68].
The ﬂuidized-bed catalytic cracking of naphtha over a ZSM-5-
based catalyst yielded up to 48% ethylene and propylene at 680 ◦C
[69]. The newly developed Advanced Catalytic Oleﬁns (ACO) pro-
cess combines the KBR ﬂuidized catalytic cracking reactor system
with a proprietary catalyst formulated by SK Corporation & Korea
Research Institute of Chemical Technology (KRICT). The process
selectively converts naphtha and the heavier feedstocks such as
kerosene and LGO [60], to large quantities of C=
2 + C=
3 and yields
roughly 65% oleﬁns with P/E ratios up to 1/1 which is about 15–25%
more C=
2 + C=
3 than a typical naphtha cracker on a relative basis,
depending on the operating conditions [70]. The ACO demo plant
evaluation with 60,000 tons/year capacity is scheduled to be per-
formed by the end of 2010 [60], and the ﬁrst commercialized ACO
process is planned to be implemented at the Number 1 Ethylene
Unit of SK Corporation in Ulsan, by 2012 [70,71]. The process is
claimed to reduce energy needs by 20% [72] and initial investment
costs by 30% [71].
The results of light oleﬁn production in catalytic cracking of
naphtha feedstock over modiﬁed ZSM-5 zeolites are summarized
in Table 2. All the experiments have been carried out in a ﬁxed bed
reactor.
4.2.1. C8–C6 alkanes
Catalytic cracking of the typical components of naphtha such
as n-octane, n-heptane, n-hexane, methyl hexane, etc., have been
widely investigated over zeolites not only to elucidate the perfor-
mance of catalysts and the reaction mechanism but also to create
further improvement in FCC process [63,73]. Some relevant works
are reported in this subsection.
Yoshimura
et
al.
investigated
the
reactivity
of
several
model compounds in the catalytic cracking over 10%La/ZSM-5
(Si/Al = 200). For n-parafﬁns, an increase in the carbon number
results in an enhancement in the oleﬁn yield. Furthermore, as
the number of methyl substitutes increased the conversion and
oleﬁn yields decreased. This decrease in reactivity is linked to the
increased stability of carbenium ions, i.e., the order of the reactivity
was: n-parafﬁns > methyl substituted isomers > dimethyl substi-
tuted isomers [3].
Jung et al. studied the inﬂuence of pore structure and
acidity of various zeolite topologies in the catalytic crack-
ing of n-octane [74]. The NH3–TPD results depicted that the
order of strong acid site numbers is: beta (Si/Al = 13) < faujasite
(Si/Al = 2.65) < ferrierite (Si/Al = 8.5) < MCM-22 (Si/Al = 10) < ZSM-5
(Si/Al = 25) < mordenite (Si/Al = 10); however, the strength of strong
acid sites increases with the order of: beta ≈faujasite < MCM-
22 ≈ZSM-5 < ferrierite < mordenite. The order of the conversion
over zeolite catalysts at 1 h nicely coincides with that of the acid
strength and the amount of strong acid sites, if the faujasite and fer-
rierite catalysts were eliminated because of their rapid deactivation
and mass transfer restriction (at 500 ◦C). The steric hindrance and
the limitation on mass transfer of reactant and products in ferrierite
pores cause the low conversions even though it has a medium
amount of strong acid sites. On the contrary, the conversion of n-
octane over faujasite is extremely low due to rapid deactivation of
the catalyst because of the enough space provided for a severe car-
bon deposition in faujasite supercages. One-dimensional pores of
mordenite are easily blocked even with a small amount of carbon
deposit (the conversion decreased from 80% to 20% during 4 h reac-
tion) [74]. On the other hand, the catalyst life of zeolites is largely
dependent on their pore structures. Almost the same conversions
at 1 h and 5 h over ZSM-5 catalyst indicate a negligible deactivation.
The ZSM-5 large number of strong acid sites and sinusoidal pores
cause high and constant catalytic activity that accelerates the crack-
ing of n-octane and suppress the formation of large intermediates.
The conversion of n-octane is largely dependent on the number
of strong acid sites, while the zeolite pore structure determines
the rate of catalyst deactivation due to carbon deposit [74]. Fur-
thermore, Jung et al. concluded that the acidity is the predominant
factor in determining the conversion level and product composi-
tion, so a high conversion and a high yield of alkenes are obtained
over ZSM-5 zeolite with a large amount of strong acid sites [40].
They found that by increasing the concentration of employed alkali
solution, the conversion of n-octane sharply decreased. The maxi-
mum yield of C=
2 + C=
3 was about 37% (80% conversion) [40].
Altwasser et al. veriﬁed the inﬂuence of zeolite pore size and
spatial constraints on the contribution of monomolecular and
bimolecular mechanisms in the catalytic cracking of n-octane.
A comparison between 8-, 10-, and12-MR zeolites with similar
framework aluminum contents, crystal sizes and ammonium ion
exchange degrees clearly reveals that with decreasing the pore
dimensions the relative importance of monomolecular cracking is
strongly increases as compared to that of bimolecular cracking. The
product distribution at similar conversions shifted with decreas-
ing the pore diameter of the zeolitic catalysts from medium-chain
(C4–C6) to short-chain (C1–C3) hydrocarbons [75].
Comparing the catalytic cracking of n-heptane on various types
of zeolites indicates that a large pore HUSY zeolite is three times
more active for cracking but decays some eight times faster than
HZSM-5 [76]. Theoretical calculations based on estimating the mag-
nitude of steric hindrance predicted that hydride transfer would
be most restricted in ferrierite and Theta-1; however, the lower
heptane adsorption capacities suggested that ZSM-5 would be the
best compromise in terms of both high activity and selectivity.
The results of the simulation indicated that the zeolites with 12-
MR pores (beta and mordenite) or with cage structure (chabazite
and erionite) exert a smaller steric inﬂuence on the adsorbed
molecules/transition states than zeolites with 10-MR pores (ZSM-
5, Theta-1and ferrierite) do [77]. HZSM-5 and H-ferrierite result
in higher alkene selectivity (80% conversion) than H-MCM-22, H-
mordenite, H-beta, and HY in the catalytic cracking of n-heptane.
The Ca2+ or Ba2+ exchanged HZSM-5 and H-ferrierite gave the high-
est selectivity (60%) to alkenes at 70% conversion. The concentration
of Brønsted acid site does not affect the selective alkene formation
but the hindrance of the bimolecular hydride transfer in the Ca2+ or
Ba2+-exchanged ferrierite enhances the selectivity to alkenes even
at high conversions [78].
The mechanism of catalytic cracking of n-hexane, as a model
component, over zeolites has been widely studied [79–82] but the
6
N. Rahimi, R. Karimzadeh / Applied Catalysis A: General 398 (2011) 1–17
high yield of light oleﬁns has not been addressed in literature. The
data obtained in the catalytic cracking of n-hexane over K and
Ba impregnated ZSM-5 zeolites indicated that the enhanced small
oleﬁn selectivity can be achieved over K/HZSM-5 and Ba/HZSM-5,
and the formation of aromatics will be reduced compared to HZSM-
5. C2–C4 oleﬁn selectivities reached 54% at the conversion of 94.4%,
at a temperature of 873 K [83]. Furthermore, Wei et al. observed that
the yield of light oleﬁns increased in catalytic cracking of n-hexane
over HZSM-5 zeolites ion-exchanged with alkali solution [6]. The
cracking of n-hexane catalyzed by HZSM-5 zeolites dealuminated
under mild steaming conditions enhances the yield of H2 compared
with the fresh catalyst. The addition of 1-hexene to n-hexane as a
feed led to an increase of the activity of the fresh zeolite, whereas
it had just the opposite effect on the activity of dealuminated sam-
ples [84]. Maia et al. concluded that the bi-functional calcined nickel
ZSM-5 (Si/Al = 25) zeolite catalyst improves the selectivity toward
the light oleﬁns. Nickel was introduced in ZSM-5 zeolite by two
different methods, i.e., wetness impregnation and ionic exchange;
the later improved the formation of light oleﬁns. The method of
metal introduction inﬂuences on n-hexane cracking activity and
the selectivity to light alkenes [85].
Catalytic cracking of n-hexane over a series of calcinated ZSM-12
samples elucidated that the higher ratios of L/B acid sites increase
the cracking activity [86]. The catalytic activity of MgAPO-11 was
evaluated for hydrocarbon catalytic cracking using n-hexane. It
shows a moderate activity for n-hexane catalytic cracking conver-
sion in the reaction temperature range of 450–550 ◦C [87].
4.3. C4 alkanes
C4 alkanes have been widely investigated for light oleﬁn pro-
duction as well as kinetic studies over zeolites. They are valuable
probe reactants because they are small and symmetrical enough to
limit the number of possible products while allowing enough differ-
ent reaction pathways to be the representative of alkane cracking
[28,88]. The recent researches depict that catalytic cracking of C4
alkanes over the modiﬁed ZSM-5 zeolites results in high yield of
light oleﬁns that is reported in this subsection.
4.3.1. Alkaline earth metal modiﬁed ZSM-5 zeolites
Wakui et al. investigated the effect of alkaline earth metal (i.e.
Mg, Ca, Sr, Ba) modiﬁcation on the performance of HZSM-5 in the
catalytic cracking of n-butane. The zeolites were modiﬁed by the
addition of carbonate salt (AE(CO3)) of each alkaline earth to the
aqueous solution used for the synthesis of the zeolite. The higher
yield of ethylene and propylene was observed by using the alkaline
earth modiﬁed ZSM-5 zeolites compared with the non-modiﬁed
HZSM-5 (Table 3). The favorable results (C=
2 + C=
3 ≃4.5%) were
obtained over Ba/ZSM-5 [89]. The stability of the modiﬁed catalyst
was not reported by the authors [90].
4.3.2. Transition metal modiﬁed ZSM-5 zeolites
The performance of Fe/HZSM-5 [91] and Cr/HZSM-5 [92]
zeolites in the catalytic cracking of isobutane (for light oleﬁn elab-
oration) was ﬁrstly investigated by Lu et al. A very high catalytic
activity and selectivity in the catalytic cracking of isobutane was
attained over Fe/HZSM-5 (Si/Al = 32) and Cr/HZSM-5 (Si/Al = 32)
catalysts loaded with a trace amount of 0.010 mmol/g Fe [91] and
0.004 mmol/g of Cr [92], at 625 ◦C (incipient-wetness impregna-
tion). The yield of total oleﬁns (C=
2 + C=
3 + C=
4 ) was 65.6% and 56.1%
over Fe/and Cr/HZSM-5 zeolites, respectively. The high yields of
ethylene and propylene reached 24.6% and 32.4% over Fe/HZSM-5
zeolites at 625 ◦C (Table 3) [91]. The presence of a small amount of
Fe or Cr could be favorable for the dehydrogenation of isobutane
to isobutene which will be easily cracked to light oleﬁns [91,92].
The selectivity of butene will be enhanced in the dehydrogenative
cracking of C4 alkanes occur over cobalt oxide-impregnated HZSM-
5 (5%Co/ZSM-5) [89]. Moreover, the ZSM-5 zeolites (Si/Al = 200)
modiﬁed with transition metals, such as Cu, Zn, and Ag increase
the yield of aromatics and reduce the C=
2 + C=
3 yield in catalytic
cracking of C4 alkanes [3].
4.3.3. Rare earth (RE) element modiﬁed ZSM-5 zeolites
The effects of rare earth on the structure, acidity, and cat-
alytic performance of HZSM-5 zeolite were investigated by Wang
et al. with the aim of light oleﬁn production. The performance
of RE (La, Ce, Pr, Nd, Sm, Eu, Gd)/HZSM-5 (Si/A1 = 64.1) catalysts
(impregnating with an aqueous solution of RE(NO3)3) was evalu-
ated in the catalytic cracking of mixed C4 alkanes [93]. The optimal
propylene yield at 600 ◦C reached 25.9%, 25.2%, and 25.2% over
Nd/HZSM-5, Ce/HZSM-5, and La/HZSM-5, respectively. The best
total alkene yield was achieved over Ce/HZSM-5 (57.2 wt.%) at
600 ◦C, and Nd/HZSM-5 (60.0 wt.%), at 650 ◦C [93]. The ratio of
P/E differs obviously according to the reaction temperature and
the type of incorporated rare earth element (Table 3). The results
revealed that RE-modiﬁed HZSM-5 catalyst signiﬁcantly enhances
the selectivity to light oleﬁns; thus, the yield of oleﬁns increases
and the yield of aromatics decreases greatly in the catalytic crack-
ing of butane. The loading of the rare earth metals in HZSM-5
sample promotes the performance of HZSM-5 (Section 5.4) in the
catalytic cracking of butane [93]. Moreover, Wakui et al. reported
an overall C=
2 + C=
3 yield of 48 wt.% at 650 ◦C in the catalytic crack-
ing of n-butane over La impregnated HZSM-5 (Si/Al = 200) catalysts
[94]. The yield of C=
2 + C=
3 rises to 58% at 650 ◦C by suggesting
a dehydrogenation-cracking double-stage reaction with employ-
ing a Pt–Sn type dehydrogenation catalyst and a cracking catalyst
(RE-loaded HZSM-5) [95]. In the proposed process, n-butane is
ﬁrstly dehydrogenated to n-butene (1- and 2-butene) over the
Pt–Sn/Ca–ZnAl2O4 as a dehydrogenation catalyst (loaded at the
upper part of the reactor), then n-butene is successively converted
to ethylene and propylene over 10%Pr/ZSM-5 as a cracking catalyst
(loaded at the lower part of the reactor) [95].
4.3.4. Phosphorus modiﬁed ZSM-5 zeolites
Although phosphorus modiﬁcation is the most commonly used
method employed to improve HZSM-5 zeolites performance, the
catalytic cracking of C4 alkanes for producing light oleﬁns over
P-modiﬁed (incipient-wetness impregnation with an aqueous solu-
tion of (NH4)2HPO4) HZSM-5 catalyst is seldom reported so far
[96]. Jiang et al. investigated the efﬁciency of P-modiﬁed HZSM-5
(Si/Al = 25) in the catalytic cracking of mixed C4 alkanes to increase
the yield of ethylene and propylene [96]. At the temperature of
650 ◦C, the maximum yields of propylene and ethylene reached
to 25.6 and 33.9 wt.%, which were higher than those over par-
ent HZSM-5 by 7 and 4.5 wt.%, respectively [96]. On the contrary,
Wakui et al. observed that ethylene and propylene yields dimin-
ished over P/ZSM-5 (2 wt.% P-loading) in the catalytic cracking of
n-butane at 650 ◦C; however, the conversion over P/ZSM-5 was
rather stable for 5 h. They observed that the loaded phosphorus
created a negative effect on the cracking activity (Table 3) [94]. Any-
way, the favorable results were achieved over 2%P–10%La/HZSM-5
(Si/Al = 200) zeolite prepared by impregnating with the aqueous
solutions of La(CH3COO)3·1.5H2O and (NH4)2HPO4, respectively
[94]. The results of light oleﬁns in the catalytic cracking of C4
alkanes over modiﬁed ZSM-5 zeolites (ﬁxed bed reactor) are sum-
marized in Table 3.
4.3.5. HZSM-5 zeolites with different Si/Al ratios
Acidity of the zeolites is largely dependent on their Si/Al molar
ratios and the employed modifying promoters [74]. In general, the
extremely high hydrothermal stability is closely related to the high
Si/Al ratio of ZSM-5 zeolite [41,69]. The low Al content in ZSM-

5 framework limits the extent of aluminum extraction from the
framework structure and reduces the occurrence of framework col-
lapse during steam treatment [69], so the stability of the crystal
lattice enhances with increasing Si/Al ratio [41,97]. On dealumina-
tion, the number of acidic centers decreases, but the acidity of the
remaining centers increases up to a degree of dealumination of ca.
50%. The opposite effects of the concentration of acid centers and
their acid strength are superimposed, so that maximum reactivity
is reached at a certain SiO2/Al2O3 ratio [97].
The effects of Si/Al ratio on the performance of ZSM-5 catalyst for
light oleﬁn formation have been merely investigated by Lu et al. in
C4 alkane catalytic cracking. They studied several systems of HZSM-
5, Fe/HZSM-5 and Cr/HZSM-5 zeolites with the different ratios of
Si/Al (25, 38, 50, 80, and 150). The NH3–TPD results indicated that
the total acid amounts, density, and strength of HZSM-5, Fe/HZSM-
5, and Cr/HZSM-5 zeolites obviously decrease, while those of weak
acid amounts enhance with reducing the Si/Al molar ratios. It was
concluded that when the ratio of Si/Al was less than 50, the three
systems of HZSM-5, Fe/HZSM-5, and Cr/HZSM-5 catalysts with the
same ratio of Si/Al gave similar and high isobutane conversions.
However, these three systems of catalysts possess different alter-
ing tendencies of isobutane conversions for the ratios of Si/Al ≥80.
The higher ratios of Si/Al (≥80) are beneﬁcial to improve the yields
of light oleﬁns (C=
2 + C=
3 + C=
4 ) over Fe/HZSM-5 and Cr/HZSM-5
zeolites (Table 3) [98]. The results reported on the catalytic per-
formances of HZSM-5, Fe/HZSM-5, and Cr/HZSM-5 zeolites with
different molar ratios of Si/Al, are not in agreement with each other
at the mentioned temperatures (550–600 ◦C); furthermore, it is not
possible to specify the optimum Si/Al ratio that favors the yield of
each light oleﬁn, i.e. ethylene, propylene, and butene. For exam-
ple, at the temperature of 550 ◦C, the highest yield of light oleﬁns
(59.8 wt.%) over Cr/HZSM-5 zeolite was achieved using Si/Al ratio
of 150, while over Fe/HZSM-5 and HZSM-5 the ratios of 80 and
50 resulted in the highest yields of light oleﬁns (54.6 wt.% and
50.8 wt.%, respectively). Generally, the yield of BTX abated in all
the samples by increasing the Si/Al ratios, so hydride transfer and
8

aromatization are suppressed by keeping the number of acid sites
low.
The inﬂuence of Si/Al ratio on light oleﬁn production is also
investigated in the catalytic cracking of other feedstocks reported in
this paper. Jung et al. observed that enhancing the Si/Al molar ratio
of ZSM-5 (25, 75 and 100) zeolites induces a signiﬁcant decrease in
the conversion of n-octane, at the temperature range of 200–600 ◦C.
The selectivity for oleﬁn slowly increases with elevating the reac-
tion temperature regardless of their Si/Al molar ratio. Thus, the
number of strong acid sites inﬂuences on the conversion con-
siderably, but not in selectivity [74]. Abrevaya reported that by
increasing the Si/Al ratio from 24 to 66, hydride transfer and arom-
atization reactions are lowered [68]. Zhu et al. studied the impact
of Si/Al ratio in the catalytic cracking of butene to propylene over
ZSM-5 zeolites, and proposed that both the propylene selectivity
and the overall yield of propylene and ethylene increased with
ascending the Si/Al2 ratio [99]. Furthermore, the stabilities of the
catalysts are effectively prolonged with enhancing the Si/Al ratios.
For the ZSM-5 (Si/Al2 = 50), the conversion decreased from an ini-
tial value of 96.6–67.5%, i.e. 29% lower in 10 h of running, while for
the ZSM-5 (Si/Al2 = 366) the conversion changed from 84.5 to 81.4%
(a decrease of only 3%) [99]. In contrast to the aforementioned con-
clusions, Han et al. observed that as the Si/A1 ratio decreased from
75 to 20, the yield of C=
2 + C=
3 increased from 29.3% to 37.5% [7].
4.4. Hydrocarbons lighter than C4
Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is an industrialized process for
the production of propylene [30] that employs different types of
catalysts, e.g., Platinum–tin-based (Pt–Sn) promoters supported on
alumina [100,101], silica, ZSM-5 [102–105], SAPO-34 [106,107],
etc. The oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of ethane and propane
over different types of catalysts including modiﬁed zeolites such
as Ga2O3/HZSM-5 [108], ZnO/HZSM-5 [109], etc., is another route
for light oleﬁn production that has been widely studied [110–116].
The mentioned processes are out of the scope in the current paper.
To the best of our knowledge, the non-oxidative catalytic crack-
ing of propane and ethane has not been resulted in high conversion
of light oleﬁns. However, the transformation of propane over
modiﬁed zeolites (e.g., Pt, Co, Zn, Ga, etc.) has been intensively
reported in literature [117–120]. The main feature of the pro-
posed conversion mechanism involves propane dehydrogenation,
followed by oligomerization and aromatization [121,122]. Metals
induce the dehydrogenating properties of the material whereas
acid sites are responsible for the oligomerization of the dehy-
drogenation products (bifunctional mechanism) [119]. Propane
activation mechanism and cracking for light oleﬁn production over
Ga oxide and Al oxide modiﬁed HZSM-5 zeolites depicts that the
preference for C–H bond activation over Ga cations results in high
propylene selectivities of more than 85% over Ga+ modiﬁed HZSM-
5 [120,123]. The faujasite structure zeolites type-X and the USY
exchanged with copper, iron, and platinum have been used in
propane transformation at 400 and 550 ◦C. The highest propane
dehydrogenation activity has been achieved with the platinum-
exchanged X zeolite (propylene yield ∼11.2%, selectivity ∼31%).
USY zeolites show high cracking capability and relatively low dehy-
drogenation activity [119].
Ethane aromatization has been also investigated extensively
over zeolites modiﬁed with metal cations such as Ga and Zn
[124]. The initial stage is the dehydrogenation of ethane that pro-
ceeds with subsequent oligomerization and dehydrocyclization
[125,126]. Different ideas regarding the nature of metal cations on
the catalyst surface, as well as the effect of the incorporated ele-
ment including the enhancement of ethane conversion, increasing
the initial formation of oleﬁns, and retarding the deactivation by
coke formation have been proposed in literature. The mechanistic

considerations such as the occurrence of a bifunctional mechanism
over the modiﬁed zeolite and/or competing of the reactants and the
intermediates for the same acidic sites are also another issues [127].
The theoretical calculations have been focused on the mechanism
of ethane dehydrogenation and the nature of intermediates and
transition states over modiﬁed zeolites. The probability of the alkyl
rupture of the ethane C–H bond or the carbenium activation have
been predicted by estimating the activation energies [128,129].
4.5. Concluding remarks
One of the advantages of catalytic cracking process, compared
to the conventional steam cracking, is that the feedstocks type is
not as prominent as steam cracking. A ﬂexible product distribution,
such as more light oleﬁns, BTX or both of them could be achieved
over modiﬁed ZSM-5 catalysts with a suitable strength and density
of acidity in the catalytic cracking of hydrocarbons (Tables 2 and 3).
Another improvement is that the P/E ratio is adjustable by choosing
the appropriate catalyst (Tables 2 and 3).
Unfortunately, in the steam cracking process, ethane feedstock
does not typically give enough propylene to be recovered. The
amount of propylene produced from propane, butane or even naph-
tha cracking is less than half that of the ethylene yields as shown
in Fig. 1 [70].
The data reported in Tables 2 and 3 depict that the ratio of P/E
differs signiﬁcantly, according to the reaction temperature and the
type of incorporated element. The catalytic cracking process has
overcome the low P/E ratio disadvantage of steam cracking; given
that, the ratios are higher than 0.58 in all the modiﬁed zeolites, and
vary in the range of 1.8–1.33 over F-, Fe-, Cr-, P-modiﬁed HZSM-5
zeolites. The promoters that accelerate dehydrogenative cracking
of hydrocarbons, such as F, Cr and Fe, are shown to increase the
ratio of P/E. Fig. 2 shows the variation of P/E (1.7–0.9) ratios versus
the modiﬁed HZSM-5 zeolite samples in the catalytic cracking of
C4 alkanes. The ratio of P/E can be altered by adjusting the zeo-
lite structure and the acidity, i.e., type, strength, and distribution
[131]. In most of the samples, the yield of ethylene increases but
the propylene yield decreases by elevating the temperature. The
selectivity for propylene is generally dependent on the extent of
the reaction: the selectivity for propylene is usually high at low
conversion, while that for ethylene becomes higher with increasing
the conversion.
In the catalytic cracking of C4 alkanes, the maximum ethy-
lene yields are achieved over 10%Pr/ZSM-5 [95], Ce/HZSM-5 [93],
and 0.5P/HZSM-5 [96] zeolites, at 650 ◦C (32.5–33.9 wt.%), while
the highest propylene yield is observed over Fe/HZSM-5 [91], at
600–625 ◦C (∼32–33 wt.%). The yield of ethylene (∼31–31.9 wt.%)

over Cr/HZSM-5 zeolite at 600 ◦C is also favorable. However, the
highest total oleﬁns as well as C=
2 + C=
3 yields have been obtained
over Fe/HZSM-5 and Cr/HZSM-5. In the catalytic cracking of naph-
tha, the highest yield of propylene is observed over F/HZSM-5
(36–33.8 wt.%), while that of ethylene is produced over La/HZSM-
5 and La-P/HZSM-5 (38–32 wt.%); La-P/HZSM-5 is the most stable
catalyst with the highest yield of C=
2 + C=
3 (62 wt.%).
Investigating the yield of light oleﬁns versus the corresponding
Si/Al ratios (Table 3) elucidates that they do not follow any trend,
generally. The highest yields of total oleﬁn are observed over the
wide range of Si/Al ratios from 32 to 200. It is noteworthy that
the operating conditions are not identical in the reported data;
consequently, comparing these data does not speciﬁcally elicit the
impact of this property. Nevertheless, the values of BTX yield have
not exceeded 5 wt.% at the highest Si/Al ratios (200), and as the
Si/Al ratio increases the yield of BTX decreases over the modiﬁed
HZSM-5 zeolites. Higher Si/Al ratios hinder the bimolecular hydro-
gen transfer reactions.
The important job in designing a catalyst is to optimize
the balance between the number/strength of acid sites and the
type/amount of metals in the modiﬁed H-ZSM-5 for maximiza-
tion of light alkenes with relatively low coke formation and catalyst
stability.
5. Effect of element modiﬁcation on the performance of
ZSM-5
The effect of ZSM-5 zeolite modiﬁcation on the selectivity of
favorable products can be studied considering various approaches.
The appropriate catalyst formulation (modiﬁcation of ZSM-5) is one
of the most important factors that inﬂuences directly on the yield of
light oleﬁns. The effect of various elements on the chemical prop-
erties of ZSM-5 zeolite, and their impacts on light oleﬁn production
are reported in this section.
A complete and detailed review of all modiﬁcations, which zeo-
lites may sustain has been published by Kühl [132]. The topic is
comprehensive enough to be excluded from the scope of the current
paper. The acid strength of zeolite varies over a wide range by the
modiﬁcation (e.g., ion exchange, impregnation, partial dealumina-
tion, and isomorphic substitution of the framework Al and Si atoms)
with multivalent cations. Brønsted acid centers are generally the
catalytically active sites of H-zeolites [97,132]. Steaming is proba-
bly the oldest modifying treatment, since it has been known since
the mid 1960s. By steaming or acid extraction, part of the zeolite
can be dissolved or restructured leaving a mesoporous system in
addition to the microporous one, which may be of importance in the
transport of reactants or products and thus the conversion of rela-
tively large molecules which may be present in a feedstock [133].
The hydroxyaluminate species formed by steaming are potential
Lewis acid sites, since the environment of the corresponding alu-
minums is octahedral [39].
5.1. Acidity of zeolites
The global acidity of a given zeolite is the result, amongst
other things, of two parameters characteristic of Brønsted sites,
i.e., their density (or their concentration) and their strength [39].
The density of Brønsted acid sites decreases when the Si/Al ratio
of the zeolitic framework increases [39,41,133,134], since the ion-
exchange capacity corresponds to the Al3+ content of the zeolites
[41,97]. The zeolites are classiﬁed according to increasing Si/Al ratio
and the associated acid/base properties (Table 4).
The strength of the Brønsted sites depends on the interaction
between the proton and the zeolitic framework or the environment
of the framework Al [39]. A completely isolated Al tetrahedron
will create the strongest type of Brønsted acid site [134]. The two
main parameters governing the acid strength of the Brønsted sites
are the structural characteristics of the zeolite and its chemical
composition. The structural characteristic of the zeolite is related
to the proton lability that depends on the angle formed between
the two adjacent tetrahedra T at the oxygen carrying the proton
[39]. Regarding the chemical composition factor, the acid strength
depends on the number of Al atoms (aluminate tetrahedral) that
are adjacent to a silanol (silicate tetrahedron) group [39,41,97]. The
highest proton-donor strengths are exhibited by zeolites with the
lowest concentrations of AlO−
4 tetrahedra such as HZSM-5 and the
ultrastable zeolite HY [41,97].
The strength of the Brønsted acid sites (intrinsic acidity) is also
affected by isomorphic substitution [133,134]. The acid strength
depends on the type of heteroatom; gallium or iron zeolites are
much less acidic than aluminum zeolites. Boron-substituted for Si
in pentasil ZSM-5 zeolites was observed to yield very weak acidity
strength [133,135], although, it results in an excellent catalyst for
isomerization [136]. Ga substituted ZSM-5 samples was shown to
exhibit both acidic and dehydrogenation properties [136].
The Lewis acid sites are related to the formation of positively
charged oxide clusters or ions within the porous structures of the
zeolites [137]. They are usually associated with extra framework
Al (EFAL) species formed by extraction of aluminum from the lat-
tice [39,134,138], or metal ions exchanged for the protons of acid
sites. These metal cations together with the adjacent framework
oxygens will act as Lewis acid/base pair, and may polarize bonds in
reacting molecules [137]. It has been also suggested that the extra-
framework trivalent Al species (formation of hydroxyaluminate
species in the microporosity) reduce the concentration of Brønsted
acid sites in the framework, simultaneously [39] increase their acid
strength if the initial Si/Al ratio is not too high (<7) [39,79,120]. In
general, the presence of Lewis acid sites could increase the strength
of the nearby OH Brønsted acid sites, due to an inductive or a syner-
gistic effect between the Brønsted and the Lewis acid sites [39,79].
5.2. Alkali and alkaline earth metals
Exchanging
zeolites
with
a

charge-
balancing cation such as Cs+ and/or occlusion of alkali metal oxide
clusters or alkali metal clusters in zeolite cages makes the zeo-
lites basic. Basic zeolites contain either Lewis base sites associated
with the framework oxygen ions, or Brønsted base sites linked
to basic hydroxyl groups, or both. The former is inﬂuenced by
the negative charge of the oxygen, while the latter depends on
the nature of extra framework cation present in the zeolite. The
base strength of the zeolite rises with increasing the aluminum
content of the framework (i.e. ZSM-5 < mordenite < L < Y < X) and

(e.g. Li < Na < K < Rb < Cs). It is also inﬂuenced by the exchange of Al
and/or Si ions in the zeolite framework for Ga and/or Ge, respec-
tively [134].
One of the roles of the alkaline earth metals is the modiﬁca-
tion of acid character by weakening acid strength or reducing acid
sites [90]. The NH3–TPD spectra of the alkaline earth modiﬁed
HZSM-5 catalysts indicated that the strong acid sites are trans-
formed to weak acid sites by the introduction of alkaline earth
metals [90]. The amount of strong acid sites reduces with the alka-
line earth modiﬁcation by increasing the ionic radius with the
order of nonmodiﬁed (H form) ≫Mg > Ca > Sr > Ba [90,97]. Barium
as the strongest Lewis base in alkaline earths series resulted in the
highest yield of light oleﬁns [90]. Tynjala et al. proposed that the
rapid decrement of strong Brønsted acid sites with increasing the
degree of Ba ion-exchange is due to quite negligible effect of the
Plank–Hirschler mechanism. The ion-exchange of zeolites with di-
and trivalent metal cations leads to the formation of metal hydrate
cations M(H2O)2+
n
and M(H2O)3+
n , respectively. H MAS NMR spec-
tra showed that the intensity of the Brønsted acid site signal also
decreased as the degree of ion-exchange increased [139].
The modiﬁcation of ZSM-5 zeolite catalysts with the elements
enhancing the surface basicity decreases the readsorption of the
basic compounds of the cracking products, such as ethylene, propy-
lene, and butenes, and this is apparently the major cause of the
lower aromatics and higher light oleﬁn formation [3]. On the other
hand, the alkaline earth metal modiﬁed HZSM-5 zeolite suppresses
hydrogen transfer reaction and stimulates the dehydrogenative
cracking by controlling the HZSM-5 acid character and dehydro-
genation activity to improve the yield of light oleﬁns [89].
The alkali treatment of zeolites induces a signiﬁcant change in
their acidity and pore structure because silica and alumina of the
framework are dissolved in alkaline solution [40]. The dissolution
of alumina removes aluminum atoms from the zeolite framework;
thus, results in the loss of strong acid sites and destruction of zeo-
lite structure [40]. The thermal and hydrothermal stabilities of the
alkali-treated ZSM-5 zeolites are slightly deteriorated because of
the introduction of mesopores caused by the desilication [140].
Weak alkali solutions dissolve a small amount of silica and alumina,
so create mesopores [6,40,141] by enlarging the micropores of zeo-
lites, while strong alkali solutions destroy their crystal structure;
therefore, convert them to amorphous materials with macropores
and extremely small acid sites [40]. Ogura et al. reported that the
microporous structure remained unchanged in Na/ZSM-5 zeolite,
but the acidic property altered very little quantitatively or qualita-
tively [141]. The textural properties analyzed by Wei et al. indicated
that the surface area and pore volume of micropores decrease to
some extent [6]. Alkali modiﬁed zeolites, usually Na and K, are not
recommended by some authors, because of the deactivating effect
of them in most of the catalytic reactions and hydrocarbon transfor-
mations [36,38]. The alkali treatment is not effective in enhancing
the overall selectivity to alkenes, but the selectivity for propylene is
high because of the rapid elution of primary cracking products [40].
On the contrary, it was observed that the loss of strong acid sites
due to alkali treatment suppresses the production of longer alkanes
such as hexane and heptane by reducing further oligomerization
[40]. Wang et al. deduced that the role of K and Ba is to enhance
the dehydrogenation activity of the catalysts and minimize the
bimolecular hydrogen transfer reaction, which is responsible for
the saturation of small oleﬁns and the formation of aromatics [83].
5.3. Transition metals
Transition metals have partially occupied d-orbitals the sym-
metry of which is suitable for formation of chemical bonds with
neutral molecules. These metals also have several stable oxidation
states and different coordination numbers as a result of the changes
in the number of d-electrons [142]. The catalysis by organometallic
compounds is based on activation of the substrates by coordinating
it to the metal, which lowers the activation energy of the reaction
between substrates. Organometallic catalysts also include speciﬁc
ligands besides the atom or group of metal atoms. A very large num-
ber of different types of ligands can coordinate to transition metal
ions. Once the ligands are coordinated, the reactivity of the met-
als may change dramatically. The rate and selectivity of a given
process can be optimized to the desired level by controlling the lig-
and environment [142]. It is known that transition metals create
new Lewis acid sites in HZSM-5 zeolites. The simultaneous pres-
ence of Brønsted and Lewis sites could increase the acid activity
of zeolites and inﬂuence on the selectivity of the catalytic cracking
products. The nature of Lewis sites, and how they impact catalyst
performance in catalytic cracking of hydrocarbons are still not fully
understood [134].
The modiﬁcation of ZSM-5 zeolites with transition metals
adjusts the catalyst acidity. Lu et al. observed that the acidic amount
of the Fe/HZSM-5 catalysts ﬁrstly increased with the introduction
of a small amount of Fe, but it decreased with further enhanc-
ing the quantity of Fe(III). The higher loading amount of iron was
proposed to lessen the catalytic cracking activity of Fe/HZSM-5 cat-
alysts obviously, that might be due to the aggregation of a majority
of iron into oxo-iron compounds with large domain size, which
could cover the outer surface of the zeolite catalysts, or combine
with acid sites [91]. The NH3–TPD analysis results of Cr/HZSM-5
indicated that the density of acid sites (weak and strong) enhance
with increasing the loading amount of Cr(III), while the strength
of strong acid sites obviously reduces [92]. It was postulated that
the majority of Cr species in the catalysts are uniform, isolated,
well dispersed, and almost oxidized to Cr(VI) after calcinations.
The catalytic cracking reactivity of Cr/HZSM-5 catalysts decreases
by rising the loading amount of Cr, that might be due to the exis-
tence of a majority of Cr(III) with large domain size, which could
cover the outer surface of the zeolite catalysts, or combine with

11
acid sites [92]. Enhancing the quantity of Fe or Cr in HZSM-5 leads
to increasing the selectivity to aromatic hydrocarbon and decreas-
ing the total oleﬁns, because of improving further oligomerization
and cyclization reactions [91,92]. A partially Cu-exchanged HZSM-
5 provides with an optimum balance between dehydrogenation
activity of the metal and acid function of the shape selective HZSM-
5 zeolite, when employed as FCC catalyst additive for improving the
yield of light oleﬁns. Lappas et al. found that a small amount of cop-
per ions, as hydrated Cu(I) or Cu(II) cations in ion-exchange sites,
hinders framework dealumination during steaming compared to
HZSM-5 or the Ga- and Cr-modiﬁed samples. The total number
of acid sites of the Cu/HZSM-5 sample was also higher than the
rest of the samples [51]. Kwak et al. observed that the addition
of Zn by chemical vapor deposition (CVD) decreased the intensity
of the Brønsted acidity, but it did not cause the apparent forma-
tion of Lewis acid sites, unlike Ga/HZSM-5 catalysts [143]. The
reported results depict that Co [89], Cu, Zn, and Ag [3] loaded
sites on HZSM-5 zeolites accelerate the dehydrogenative crack-
ing [89] and cyclo-dehydrogenation reaction [3]. Zhang et al. found
that the hydrogen transfer capability of the transition metals sup-
pressed in the presence of phosphorus, and the selectivity to light
oleﬁns were increased because of its dehydrogenation activity
[131].
As the aromatization reaction starts with dehydrogenation step
and the formation of small oleﬁns, the results obtained in this
reaction are also applicable for studying the impact of element
modiﬁcation in improving the yield of light oleﬁns. The incorpo-
ration of transition metal ions into zeolites leads to interesting
bifunctional catalysts [85] in which metal and acid centers can
act simultaneously [97]. The transition metals, such as Ni, Co, Zn,
Cu, Cr, and Mn, introduced into pentasil type zeolites are generally
used as active components for hydrogenation or dehydrogenation
[144,145] or aromatization reactions [121,122,131]. The hypothe-
sis of dehydrogenation enhancing role of Lewis acid in the initial
stages of the cracking reactions have been supported by various
researches. It results in the oleﬁn formation that can initiate, or at
least enhance the cracking reaction [8,138].
The mechanism of hydrocarbon transformation over a modi-
ﬁed zeolite could involve both Lewis and Brønsted acid sites [84].
The activation on a zeolite matrix should occur largely on strong
Lewis acidic centers, while secondary cracking, on strong Brønsted
centers [146]. It is also probable that both the incorporated ele-
ment and zeolite protons intervene in hydrocarbon activation step
[143,147]. In a true bifunctional catalyst such as Ga2O3/ZSM-5,
the dehydrogenation and aromatization mainly occurs on metals,
while oligomerization, cyclization, dealkylation, transalkylation,
and isomerization of alkyl aromatics occur on zeolite [42]. Tran-
sition metals, e.g. Zn and Ga cations, are the driving force for
dehydrogenation by combining the H-atoms that form during the
activation of C–H at Brønsted acid sites due to the cyclic reduction
and oxidation of Zn and Ga species [148]. Altogether, the com-
bination of Lewis sites for the dehydrogenation of the parafﬁnic
feedstock with Brønsted acid sites for the cracking of subsequent
higher oleﬁns to light oleﬁns, could enhance the yield of light oleﬁns
[8].
5.4. Rare earth elements
Rare earth is a generic name used for the 14 metallic elements of
the Lanthanide series, which contain the atomic numbers from 57
through 71 plus Scandium (At. #21) and Yttrium (At. #39). These
elements occupy a unique place in the periodic chart. They are the
ﬁrst elements where the increasing atomic number results in the
ﬁlling of the inner electron shell after an outer shell has been ﬁlled,
causing a high similarity in chemical properties [149].
Rare earth cations such as La3+ and Ce3+ have been successfully
employed in FCC so called zeolite Y (REY) catalysts to improve the
ability of the catalyst to withstand high temperature, leading to the
catalytic stability [11,150], increasing catalyst activity and gaso-
line selectivity [11,93]. A higher concentration of acid sites will be
found in the rare earth exchanged catalyst due to inhibiting the dea-
lumination of the zeolite; consequently, both the activity and the
hydrothermal stability of the catalyst will be improved [149]. The
effects of rare earth elements on Y zeolites are still controversial. On
one hand, they shift the cracking selectivity due to the reduction of
hydrogen transfer to produce higher percentages of oleﬁns, which
will increase gasoline octane number [150]. On the other hand, as a
result of the greater number of active sites, both the primary crack-
ing and hydrogen transfer reactions that occur within the zeolite
are enhanced [149].
The inﬂuence of RE modiﬁcation on the catalytic performances
of ZSM-5 zeolite is also debatable. On one hand, some researchers
have reported that the introduction of a rare earth metal ion
into HZSM-5 has a great impact on its acidic properties [93,151].
Hartford et al. observed that lanthanum exchanged ZSM-5 zeo-
lite alters the acidity by lowering the number of strong acid sites
and increasing the number of weak acid sites (Table 5), but it
does not reduce the effective free pore volume nor it enlarge
steric hindrances for the passage of linear molecules through
the pores of the catalyst [151]. Moreover, Wang et al. illus-
trated that the total amount of acid sites of light RE-modiﬁed
HZSM-5 samples increases, compared to the unmodiﬁed HZSM-
5 sample, except for the Gd-modiﬁed sample [93]. The orders of
the amount of weak acid, strong acid, and total acid total acid
have been observed as follows: Sm >Nd > Pr > Eu > Ce > La > HZSM-
5 > Gd; Nd >Eu > La > Sm > Ce > Pr > Gd > HZSM-5; Nd > Sm > Eu > Pr
> Ce > La > HZSM-5 > Gd (Table 5) [93]. On the contrary, Xue et al.
deduced that adding La to HZSM-5 zeolite decreases the total
amount of Brønsted acid sites in the zeolite. This elimination was
probably caused by the exchange of La3+ ion with bridged hydrox-
yls in zeolite; although, some new acid sites might be generated by
splitting the coordinated water molecules with La3+ ions. The den-
sity of Brønsted acid sites in La/HZSM-5 decreases with the increase
in La loadings [66]. The acid amount of RE/HZSM-5 after NH3–TPD
measurement is listed in Table 5.
The presence of the empty f orbital in rare earth metals is essen-
tial to modify the acidity of HZSM-5 zeolites because it can at least
provide some positions for the formation of Lewis acidic sites [93].
The detailed results of the FT-IR spectra of adsorbed pyridine on the
RE-modiﬁed HZSM-5 zeolites are reported in Table 6. The results
indicate that Brønsted and Lewis acid sites coexist on all the stud-
ied samples. The modiﬁcation of HZSM-5 zeolite with rare earth
metals not only amend the amount of acid sites but also alters the
acid type, i.e., the ratio of L/B [93].
On the other hand, it is generally accepted that the introduc-
tion of RE elements modiﬁes the basicity of ZSM-5 zeolite as RE
oxides usually possess some basic characters [93]. Yoshimura et al.
and Wakui et al. observed that the acid amount and strength were
almost the same before and after the La loading (10 wt.% loading)
indicating that the modiﬁcation of HZSM-5 with La did not affect
the acidic character of the catalyst [3,94]. In contrast to the acid-
ity, considerable changes were observed for the basicity measured
by CO2–TPD. The amount of CO2 adsorption calculated from the
peak at 70 ◦C enhanced as the quantity of La loading increased, sug-
gesting the generation of basic sites on the surface as a result of
La-loading [3]. Wakui et al. illustrated that as the amount of La-
loaded increases, the oleﬁn adsorption over La/HZSM-5 zeolites
decreases; thus, the main reason for the higher yield of ethy-
lene and propylene is inhibiting the bimolecular reactions due to
the suppression of oleﬁn adsorption [89,95]. The introduction of
RE elements modiﬁes the basicity of ZSM-5 zeolite [3,93]; hence,

[93]: The series of RE/HZSM-5 catalysts contain 7.54 wt.% of different kinds of light RE (La, Ce, Pr, Nd, Sm, Eu, Gd) [93].
[152]: Two lanthanum-exchanged forms of the catalyst, containing 0.13% and 0.60% w/w La, respectively, were prepared. Assuming that a stoichiometric exchange process
takes place, with three monovalent ammonium ions being replaced by one trivalent lanthanum ion, these masses correspond to lanthanum-ammonium exchanges of 5% and
25%, respectively [152].
decreases the readsorption of the basic compounds of the cracking
products, such as ethylene, propylene, and butenes, which is one
of the major causes of higher light oleﬁn formation.
5.5. Phosphorus
Phosphorus modiﬁcation is the most widely used method that
has been applied for improving HZSM-5 zeolites performance [96].
Researchers at Mobil where among the ﬁrst to recognize the ben-
eﬁts of phosphorus [49] for improving the hydrothermal stability
and shape selectivity of ZSM-5 zeolites [49,152,153]. Phosphorus
stabilizes the lattice aluminum ions by retarding aluminum from
leaving the zeolite framework; thus, it hinders structural changes
of zeolite that signiﬁcantly results in enhancing the stability of the
catalyst [3,5,49,152,153]. Degnan et al. have summarized that phos-
phorus reduces the initial acidity of the zeolite, but after severe
steaming produces a zeolite that retains a larger fraction of its
acidity [49]. The stabilization of cracking activity is entirely due
to the improved retention of framework aluminum in ZSM-5 [49].
Lercher et al. proposed that the phosphorus species interact with
the oxygen of the bridging hydroxyl groups by replacing the pro-
tons on them and result in the cleavage of the Al–O bonding and the
opening of the zeolite framework [154]. When phosphorus reacts
with zeolite, the hydroxyl connected with aluminum atoms on the
zeolite surfaces is replaced by P–OH, so the acid strength is weak-
ened because the strength of P–OH is weaker than that of Al–OH
[154]. Xue et al. used various experimental techniques to demon-
strate the inﬂuences of hydrothermal treatment on the Brønsted
acid sites of the HZSM-5 impregnated by phosphorus. The inter-
action of phosphorus species with silanol nests exposed on the
zeolite (due to dealumination) creates new hydrothermally stable
acid sites during the steam treatment [152]. The new acid sites
seem to be related to the phosphorus entering into the zeolitic
position left by dealumination and stabilized by some extra-lattice
aluminum. The entry of phosphorus into the zeolitic framework
protects the residual framework aluminum against further dealu-
mination. The integrated effect causes the hydrothermally stable
acid sites in P/HZSM-5 [152]. The Phosphorous–zeolite interac-
tion is also proposed to stabilize the framework aluminum pairs
by extra-framework cationic species formed via protonation of
orthophosphoric acid [155].
Altogether, the modiﬁcation of HZSM-5 zeolite with phospho-
rus decreases Brønsted acidity [5,153,156]; and/or converts strong
Brønsted acid sites of HZSM-5 into weak Brønsted acid sites that
increases the density of the weak Brønsted acid sites without
changing the overall acid–base properties [154,157]. On the other
hand, it is reported that the concentration of both Brønsted and
Lewis acid sites are signiﬁcantly decreased in P/HZSM-5 zeolites, at
the same desorption temperature. Brønsted and Lewis acid sites
dropped with increasing the desorption temperature (from 100
to 300 ◦C) [158]. It is suggested that during calcinations, some of
the Brønsted acid sites are neutralized by attaching P species, and
subsequent hydrothermal treatment of P/HZSM-5 converts the P
species to more condensed phase which block pores of zeolite
reversibly [153]. Acid amounts of P/HZSM-5 zeolites after NH3/TPD
measurement are reported in Table 7.
Reducing the Brønsted acidity of P/HZSM-5 provides a path-
way for reaction to occur with enhanced light oleﬁn production
[5]. The introduction of P in HZSM-5 increases the selectivity to
propylene and butenes in the catalytic cracking of n-decane [155].
The incorporated phosphorous species are responsible for both the
enhanced acid stability, and the signiﬁcantly improved catalytic
performance in the cracking of C4 oleﬁn to propylene and ethy-
lene [152]. Zhao et al. supported the idea that the P-impregnated
HZSM-5 zeolites improve the propylene selectivity greatly and
result in excellent anti-coking ability (lifetime exceeding 800 h on
a single process) in the catalytic cracking of C4 oleﬁn [158]. Liu
et al. concluded that P/HZSM-5 leads to higher yields of light oleﬁn
(i.e., ethylene and propylene) in the catalytic cracking of naphtha
[153].

On the other hand, the introduction of phosphorus not only
modulates the amount of acidic sites and the percentage of weak
acidic sites in total acidic sites but also regulates the ratio of L/B
(Table 8), which are favorable for obtaining the high yield of propy-
lene in the catalytic cracking of C4 alkanes. The results showed that
the new basic sites generated on the surfaces of P/HZSM-5 catalysts
inhibit the adsorption of intermediate oleﬁns and lower the forma-
tion of aromatics. The results of the P/HZSM-5 catalyst stability test
indicated that there was an insigniﬁcant decrease in the conversion
of the mixed C4 alkanes after 10.5 h continuous reaction, while the
yield of ethylene plus propylene exhibited a slight enhancement
[96].
6. Mechanism of catalytic cracking over zeolites
The present paper does not intend to go through the suggested
mechanisms of hydrocarbon catalytic cracking as some extensive
reviews have been already published in this ﬁeld [28,138,159–161].
The catalytic cracking reaction scheme and the inﬂuence of various
factors on the contribution of each mechanism have been summa-
rized in this section.
Alkanes can be activated by two mechanisms: monomolecu-
lar and bimolecular mechanisms. In the monomolecular (protolytic
cracking) mechanism, proposed by Haag and Dessau in 1984 [162],
alkanes are protonated to form carbonium ion transition states that
can undergo either C–C bond cleavage yielding alkanes (including
methane and ethane) or C–H bond cleavage yielding hydrogen and
carbenium ions. These carbenium ions subsequently form alkenes
via back donation of a proton to the zeolite. The formation of
ethylene is possible via this mechanism (Fig. 3) [28,68,77]. In the
bimolecular mechanism, cracking takes place when branched sec-
ondary and tertiary alkylcarbenium ions derived from the feed
molecule are cleaved by a single beta-scission into smaller alkyl-
carbenium ions and alkenes (Fig. 4).
The formation of primary alkylcarbenium ions is unlikely, so
ethylene, ethane and methane are not observed via this mechanism.
Bimolecular hydride transfer reactions between alkylcarbenium
ions and feed alkanes lead to chain reactions that produce shorter
alkanes thus limiting the yield of oleﬁns to 50 wt.% [28,77].
6.1. The factors determining the dominant mechanism
The protolytic cracking mechanism allows the formation of
large quantities of ethylene and propylene from naphtha range
reactants, provided that the bimolecular hydride transfer and
aromatization reactions, which will consume ethylene and propy-
lene are hindered [68]. The zeolite structure (e.g. the pore size
and shape) and chemical properties (i.e. the promoter type,
the acidity, and Si/Al ratio), as well as the operating condition
directly inﬂuence on the contribution of the mentioned reaction
schemes in the system. The monomolecular mechanism is dom-
inant in the medium pore shape selective zeolites, i.e. ZSM-5
[28,46,68,75,77,81,88,138,163], with high Si/Al ratio [74,138] over
strong proton sites of low density [68,159,164], at a low concen-
tration of alkenes in the reaction environment [28,77], low partial
pressure of reactants [39,47,81,159,165], high temperature and low
conversion [46,88,159,165]. The ZSM-5 zeolite improves the pro-

duction of light oleﬁns, particularly propylene. Its shape selectivity
affects on the catalyst performance in two ways. (1) Reactant state
selectivity (RSS), so that the linear and monobranched parafﬁnic
structures and even more the oleﬁnic structures are converted into
smaller fragments (C4−) in the microporosity. (2) Transition state
selectivity (TSS) which acts in two ways in the ZSM-5: ﬁrst, it pre-
vents the formation of the transition state needed for the transfer
of hydrogen; second, it hinders the formation of coke in the micro-
porosity of the zeolite. The role of shape selectivity is often more
important than their acidity [33].
The various reactions rely in different ways on the strength and
local structure of the Brønsted acid sites in zeolites. The activ-
ity of Brønsted acid sites in zeolites is strongly affected by the
rate-limiting step of the reaction. The monomolecular cracking
of alkanes proceeds via protonation of the alkane as the rate-
limiting step. This reaction is inﬂuenced by the size and shape
of the pores that impact the heat of adsorption [165]. Previous
studies support this idea and declare that the differences in the
heat of adsorption, and thus the size and shape of the pores,
are the dominant factors in determining the cracking activity of
the Brønsted acid sites [79,165,166]. High Brønsted acid site den-
sity decreases the activation energy [167]; consequently, results
in high rate of hydride transfer and stable alkylation catalysts
[167,168].
The rate-limiting step in dehydrogenation of alkanes is the des-
orption of intermediate species, that is determined by the stability
of these species [169]. This stability depends on the local structure
of the Brønsted acid site and the Si/Al ratio of the zeolite frame-
work [165]. Thus, changes in zeolite structure and such properties
as the Si/Al ratio, framework ionicity, and framework ﬂexibility,
strongly inﬂuence the stability of the intermediate species [165].
Higher Si/Al ratio of zeolite decelerates the rate of hydride transfer
reactions [168].
6.2. The role of incorporated element in the catalytic cracking
mechanism
Determining the precise role of incorporated element in the
reaction steps is not simple, especially when the nature of the active
metal species such as Ga remains unclear [123]. The effect of zeolite
modiﬁcation on the catalytic cracking is still under investigation,
from the mechanistic point of view. Some relevant ideas regarding
the role of incorporated element in the catalytic cracking reaction
scheme have been summarized in this subsection.
Alternative to the conversion of hydrocarbons over Brønsted
acid sites is their activation over Lewis acid sites. A distinct dif-
ference exists in the product distribution between Brønsted and
Lewis sites. The former mainly catalyze C–C cracking reactions
while the latter exhibits a strong preference for C–H activation and
to a greater extent dehydrogenation [123]. The further cracking of
the carbenium ion resulted from C–C cleavage increases the oleﬁns-
to-parafﬁn ratio compared to unity for Brønsted acid sites [8]. When
bimolecular hydride transfer is limited as for HZSM-5, one predicts
oleﬁn-to-parafﬁn ratios of about 2 [163]. Doronin et al. considered
that activation on a zeolite matrix should occur largely on strong
Lewis acidic centers, while secondary cracking, on strong Brønsted
centers [146]. Biscardi et al. [170] and Yu et al. [118] suggested
that the predominant role of extra-framework cations like Zn and
Co in Zn/HZSM-5 and Co/HZSM-5 is to enhance the recombinative
desorption of hydrogen, that increases the rate of dehydrogenation
compared to HZSM-5. This process consumes the surface hydro-
gen pool available for the reverse hydrogenation reactions, and it
increases the overall rate of propylene conversion to aromatics. Zn
and Co cations promote not only alkane dehydrogenation but also
the subsequent removal of hydrogen as H2, leading to unsaturated
intermediates required in cyclization steps [118,170]. Feller et al.
proposed that the activation of propane over Ga-containing zeo-
lites occurs via a pseudo-protonated cyclopropane intermediate
involving both protons and Ga+ species [8,168]. The recent exper-
imental and theoretical work have shown that Lewis sites such as
Ga+ species activate parafﬁns via heterolytic dissociation, over the
Lewis acid–base pair formed by the univalent Ga+ ion and the zeo-
lite oxygen anion [123], that differs from the activation of parafﬁns
over HZSM-5 via a carbonium ion mechanism [120]. Kazansky et al.
concluded that hydrocarbon activation on HZSM-5 modiﬁed by Zn
and Ga cations proceeds via two distinctly different mechanisms.
The role of Zn2+ in Zn/ZSM-5 is the heterolytic dissociative adsorp-
tion of ethane forming an alkyl group and a Brønsted acid site,
while Ga2+ results in dissociative adsorption of hydrocarbon [171].
Furthermore, Hensen et al. illustrated that over Ga cations, het-
erolytic dissociation of propane takes place on the Lewis acid base
pair formed by the Ga+ ion and the zeolite oxygen anion that leads
to high propylene production. Similarly, propane gives propylene
over the acid–base pair of GaO+ via a lower energy barrier [120].
Rane et al. suggested that the synergy between Ga dehydrogenation
sites and Brønsted acid sites improve the dehydrogenation rate; the
high acidity of the zeolitic proton facilitates hydrogen recombina-
tion and concomitant removal of product oleﬁn from the Ga active
sites. The promoter cations play a key role in the dehydrogenation
of parafﬁns, and Brønsted acid protons catalyze the oligomerization
of the oleﬁns produced [8].
7. Conclusion
Light oleﬁn production through catalytic cracking of hydro-
carbons has attracted researchers’ attention to overcome the
disadvantages of the conventional steam cracking, such as the
high reaction temperature, the great amount of CO2 emission,
and the low P/E ratios (0.4–0.6). The use of a shape selective, tri-
dimensional micropore structure HZSM-5 zeolite with the large
speciﬁc surface area has led to promising results in the catalytic
cracking of different types of hydrocarbons, i.e., heavy feedstocks,
naphtha range feedstocks, and C4 alkanes, at 550–650 ◦C; that is
about 200 ◦C lower than the steam cracking. The ethylene yield of
28–34% and propylene yield of 23–29% have been attained depend-

ing on the feed type and the operating condition that is improved
by 7–10%, compared with steam cracking. Furthermore, the ratio of
P/E could be improved to 1.8–0.6 by adjusting the acidity, i.e., the
acid type, density, strength, and distribution (L/B), as well as the
reaction temperature.
The appropriate modiﬁcation, including the selection of a suit-
able promoter, the amount of loading and the modiﬁcation method
has direct impact on the ZSM-5 performance and the product
distribution. The promoter controls the pore characteristics and
shape-selectivity of ZSM-5 zeolite, as well as the acidity; moreover,
it inﬂuences on the catalyst activity and hydrothermal stability.
Alkaline and rare earth elements cations not only increase the sur-
face basicity that results in reducing the readsorption of the basic
compounds of the cracking products, such as ethylene, propylene,
and butenes, but also enhance the dehydrogenation reaction, which
are the major causes of light oleﬁn formation. Transition metals
alter the acid distribution, i.e., the ratio of L/B, regulate the con-
centration, and amend the strength of Brønsted acid sites. The role
of Lewis acid sites in accelerating the dehydrogenation reaction
combined to a synergistic effect that exists between the Brønsted
and the Lewis acid sites, hinder the hydrogen transfer reaction, and
improve the dehydrogenative cracking that consequently improve
the yield of light oleﬁns. Rare earth elements not only amend the
acid strength and distribution but also enhance the surface basicity
of ZSM-5 catalyst. The modiﬁcation of ZSM-5 with phosphorus is
the best compromise in terms of both improving the hydrothermal
stability as well as adjusting the zeolite chemical properties.
The higher Si/Al (>80) ratios in ZSM-5 framework are beneﬁcial
because of the well-established impact of low Al content in limiting
the extent of aluminum extraction from the framework structure
[69] and thus, increasing the stability of the crystal lattice [41,97].
Moreover, the higher Si/Al ratios hinder the bimolecular reactions
and prevent from the formation of BTX.
The mechanism of hydrocarbon transformation over a modiﬁed
HZSM-5 zeolite could involve both Lewis and Brønsted acid sites,
so the reactant is under the inﬂuence of two different types of sites
simultaneously: the incorporated element and the zeolite acid sites.
The synergy between Brønsted acid sites and the sites created via
modiﬁed elements is one of the essential factors in determining
the dominant mechanism in the catalytic cracking reaction. The
factors such as the zeolite chemical and physical properties and
the operating condition also verify the contribution of the favorable
reaction scheme in the system.
8. Future prospects
Naphtha has thus far been employed as the main feedstock for
oleﬁns productions. However, due to the sudden rise in the price
of oil and shortage of current light crude, many nations in Europe,
North America, and the Middle East have paid attention to pro-
ducing light oleﬁns via alternative potential feedstocks such as
heavy crudes. Meanwhile, the investment in plant construction in
the petrochemical industry has focused on the utilization of nat-
ural gas due to economical aspects. Although, it is expected that
market demands for ethylene can be met by natural gas decompo-
sition technology, but in the near future there will be a shortage of
propylene supply [10,60].
According to the mentioned reasons, future technologies such
as the catalytic cracking will be required to fulﬁll forthcoming mar-
ket demand. Therefore, the catalytic cracking process should satisfy
not only the production of high amount of light oleﬁns (ethylene
and propylene) from low grade crude as a feedstock but also con-
trollable ratios of P/E [60,70]. Thus, it is anticipated that the thermal
cracking process will be gradually transformed to a catalytic pro-
cess such as ACO that can efﬁciently produce both ethylene and
propylene, reduce the reaction temperature, and adjust the product
distribution [7,60,63,68,70]. Most of the currently used units and
equipment in steam cracking processes can be utilized for this cat-
alytic cracking process; hence, the new process has a high potential
for commercialization.
However, large-scale production of light oleﬁns using catalytic
cracking has some obstacles. The catalyst should have enough activ-
ity, selectivity and stability for the production of light oleﬁns; the
other problem could be the production cost. During the last decade,
research scientists have focused on developing a number of mod-
iﬁed HZSM-5 zeolites with tuned acidities and optimized control
of the catalyst pore size to maximize the selectivities, and mini-
mize the by product and coke formation. The suitable catalysts for
the catalytic cracking of parafﬁns should contain strong acid sites
to initiate the cracking reaction by producing reactive intermedi-
ates and the speciﬁc pore structures to suppress the formation of
large hydrocarbons. The high hydrothermal stability of the cata-
lysts is also indispensable because the reaction is operated at high
temperatures in the presence of steam [74]. The shape selective, tri-
dimensional HZSM-5 zeolite with high Si/Al (>80) ratios has proven
to be the best choice for light oleﬁn production. Furthermore, the
impact of phosphorus on enhancing the hydrothermal stability of
the given catalyst is well-established, but it is not easy to spec-
ify the other concomitant promoter, exactly. Rare earth elements
could be appropriate candidates because they can amend both the
ZSM-5 acidity and basicity; thus, the dehydrogenation is acceler-
ated, and the readsorption of oleﬁnic basic products is hindered,
simultaneously. Anyway, the La-P/HZSM-5 (Si/Al = 200) zeolite has
been so far the best compromise in terms of both the high selec-
tivity to light oleﬁns and the appropriate stability for the catalytic
cracking of naphtha feedstock. The promoters that accelerate dehy-
drogenative cracking of hydrocarbons, such as Cr and Fe, are shown
to increase the ratio of P/E in the catalytic cracking of C4 alkanes.
Finally, to put the catalyst and the catalytic process to practical use,
the following studies are needed: (a) test of catalytic performance
on a pilot scale unit, (b) measurement and estimation of the cata-
lyst life, (c) formation of catalysts with low pressure drop, and (d)
optimization of the catalyst regeneration method [3].
