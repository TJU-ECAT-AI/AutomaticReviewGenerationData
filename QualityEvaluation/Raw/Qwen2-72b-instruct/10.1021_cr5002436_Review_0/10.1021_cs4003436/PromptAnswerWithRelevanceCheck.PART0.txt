[1] "Ethylene, propylene, and butylenes are key building blocks in the chemical industry. Throughout this review we refer to C2C4 olefins as lower or light olefins. These base chemicals are among the organic chemicals with the largest production volumes worldwide (Table 1). Their broad spectrum of derivatives result in a very diverse end market ranging from packing materials and synthetic textiles to antifreezing agents, solvents, and coatings."
[2] "Ethylene is the largest-volume petrochemical produced worldwide. It is used to produce intermediate chemicals of high importance in industry such as ethyl benzene, ethylene oxide, and ethylene dichloride, which were listed, along with ethylene, in the top 30 highest volume chemicals in the United States in 2000. (2) The major chemicals derived from ethylene and their derivatives are shown in Figure 1. Ethylene is mainly used by the plastics industry. In 2010, approximately 61% of the total consumption of ethylene was for production of polyethylene in the Western European countries (Figure 2). Ethylene is also used in the production of other plastics such as polystyrene (PS), polyethylene terephthalate (PET), and polyvinyl chloride (PVC), which are widely used in the packaging, textile, and construction industries."
[3] "Propylene is a versatile petrochemical which has even more derivatives than ethylene. However, the tremendous growth of polypropylene consumption over the past 15 years has been the main driver of the large increase of the demand of propylene. In 2010, more than 55% of propylene consumption was dedicated to the production of polypropylene in the Western European countries. Approximately 13% of the propylene was used in the production of propylene oxide, which is a chemical precursor for the synthesis of propylene glycol and polyols. The rest of the production was used in the synthesis of cumene (about 8%), acrylonitrile, isopropyl alcohol, and many other industrially relevant chemicals. (3)"

The rest of the production was used in the synthesis of cumene (about 8%), acrylonitrile, isopropyl alcohol, and many other industrially relevant chemicals. (3) Traditionally, propylene is produced as a byproduct of steam cracking of naphtha for ethylene production or it is recovered from refinery processes, especially from fluid catalytic cracking (FCC)."
[4] "The C4 olefins fraction is composed of butadiene, isobutylene, and n-butenes which are used in fuel and chemical applications. Butadiene is mainly used as raw material for the production of different types of synthetic rubber (SBR, polybutadiene rubber, etc.). These synthetic rubbers are in high demand all over the world, especially in Asia, for the manufacture of finished goods in the electronics and automotive sectors. Butadiene is also used for the production of ABS (acrylonitrilebutadienestyrene), SB (styrenebutadiene) copolymer latex and block copolymers, and nitrile rubbers (NBR)."
[5] "One of the most important applications of butylenes is in the fuel industry, accounting for approximately 85% of butylenes world production. They are used for the production of gasoline alkylate, polymer gasoline, and dimersol, which are gasoline blending components. Isobutylene is a raw material for the synthesis of methyl tert-butyl ether (MTBE) and ethyl tert-butyl ether (ETBE), which are used as octane enhancers, and for the production of isooctane by dimerization and subsequent hydrogenation. n-Butenes have a smaller chemical market compared with butadiene and isobutylene. They are used as comonomers for polyethylene, for the production of sec-butyl alcohol, which is a raw material in the synthesis of MEK (methyl ethyl ketone), and for the synthesis of higher olefins."
[6] "The constantly growing demand for lower olefins has caused the global production capacity to double over the past 15 years. During 2008 and 2009, ethylene demand decreased due to the slow global economic growth; nevertheless, analysts predict that the demand will grow after 2012 (Figure 3)."
[7] "It is expected that new steam crackers will provide sufficient ethylene to meet the growing demand. Propylene production will increase as well; however, according to experts the production capacity will be insufficient to cover the demand. (6) The growth of the demand for lower olefins will inevitably increase the demand for the feedstocks required in the petrochemical industry. With the recent high oil prices, research has been directed to the development of processes based on alternative feedstocks for the production of lower olefins."
[8] "The production of lower olefins via steam cracking is one of the ten most energy-consuming processes of the chemical and petrochemical industry. (7)"
[9] "There is a growing awareness of the depletion of conventional oil reserves. Some analysts suggest that oil consumption will surpass the discovery of new reserves followed by the depletion of known reserves. (8)"
[10] "The oil contained in unconventional reserves is heavy oil in the case of so-called oil sands. The extraction and upgrading of unconventional oil currently may involve higher costs and higher CO2 emissions in comparison with conventional oil. (9)"
[11] "There is a pressing necessity to decrease CO2 emissions. (10) Feedstocks such as biomass have lower net CO2 contribution. (11)"
[12] "Many countries, among them Japan, China, and Brazil, are searching for alternatives to reduce their reliance on imported crude oil and refined products."
[13] "Several processes have been developed in an attempt to solve one or more of the challenges encountered by the lower olefins industry. These processes are based on alternative feedstock such as coal, natural gas, or biomass."
[14] "Although coal has long been used as a feedstock for the chemical industry, for instance, for the production of acetylene via the carbide process and for the synthesis of ammonia, in times of abundant low-cost oil and gas, its role diminished."
[15] "The rapid increase of energy demand, the high oil and gas prices, and the strategic drive of coal-rich countries to reduce their dependence on imported crude oil have led to reconsider coal as a primary feedstock for the production of chemicals."
[16] "Biomass gasification has potential as a source for hydrocarbon products in view of feedstock flexibility and the possibilities to reduce net CO2 emissions. (12-15) The use of biomass for the production of lower olefins might benefit from low feedstock costs and tax incentives. However, the potential for cost reduction in light olefins production is limited by the cost of collection and transportation of biomass in large-scale applications and the production of synthesis gas."
[17] "The use of biomass is mainly encouraged by its carbon-neutral nature. Biomass may be transformed through pyrolysis to achieve high energy density and then converted to syngas. The syngas obtained from biomass is CO-rich and in general contains several impurities, as is the case for coal-based syngas. The syngas derived from these sources requires extensive purification to remove contaminants, such as sulfur, that are detrimental for the catalysts used in syngas transformation processes. For most conversion processes, the H2/CO ratio needs to be adjusted by means of the water gas shift reaction (WGS). After purification and tuning the H2/CO ratio, syngas can be used for the production of chemicals and fuels."
[18] "With the recent discovery of large shale gas reserves in the U.S., (16, 17) new possibilities are open for the transformation of natural gas to olefins. Wet shale gas can be directly fed to ethane crackers to produce ethylene, while dry shale gas can be used for the production of syngas and thus be transformed directly or indirectly to lower olefins."
[19] "The increased availability of natural gas from shale deposits has produced a major shift in the feedstocks used for the production of ethylene in U.S., and consequently it has affected the propylene and butadiene markets. The use of ethane as feedstock for the crackers instead of naphtha results in a tighter supply of C3 and C4 olefins, and it might increase the prices for those chemicals in the future. (5, 18) These issues have also opened opportunities for alternative processes for the production of propylene and butylenes."
[20] "Large shale gas reserves have been found not only in U.S. but also in other countries such as China, which holds the largest technically recoverable reserves. (19) The exploitation of shale gas for energy purposes and for the production of lower olefins is expected to increase dramatically in the years to come in spite of some environmental concerns related to its extraction (20) and the high costs involved in the production of shale gas.

1.轻烯烃，如乙烯和丙烯，是化工行业中的关键基础原料，其广泛的衍生物用于各种应用，包括包装材料、合成纺织品、防冻剂、溶剂和涂料。乙烯是全球产量最大的石化产品，用于生产乙苯、环氧乙烷和二氯乙烯等中间化学品。它主要用于塑料行业，2010年西欧国家约61%的乙烯总消耗量用于聚乙烯生产。丙烯，拥有比乙烯更多的衍生物，由于聚丙烯消费量的大幅增长，需求大幅增加。2010年，西欧国家超过55%的丙烯消耗量用于聚丙烯生产。丙烯还用于生产丙烯氧化物、酮、丙烯腈、异丙醇和其他工业相关化学品。C4烯烃部分，由丁二烯、异丁烯和正丁烯组成，用于燃料和化工应用。丁二烯主要用于合成橡胶生产，而丁烯主要用于燃料行业，约占全球丁烯产量的85%。
2.对轻烯烃的持续增长需求导致过去15年全球生产能力翻了一番。分析师预测，需求将在2012年后增长。预计新的蒸汽裂解装置将提供足够的乙烯以满足不断增长的需求，但丙烯生产能力可能不足以满足需求。通过蒸汽裂解生产轻烯烃是化工和石化行业中十大最耗能的工艺之一。对常规石油储备枯竭的日益增长的认识，非常规石油（如油砂中的重油）的高成本和高CO2排放，减少CO2排放的迫切需要，以及许多国家（如日本、中国和巴西）寻求减少对进口原油和精炼产品的依赖，这些因素导致研究转向基于替代原料（如煤、天然气或生物质）的轻烯烃生产过程。煤长期以来一直被用作化工行业的原料，例如用于通过碳化物过程生产乙炔和合成氨。在低成本石油和天然气充足的时代，煤的作用减弱。能源需求的迅速增长、高油价和天然气价格以及煤炭丰富国家的战略驱动，以减少对进口原油的依赖，导致重新考虑将煤作为生产化学品的主要原料。生物质气化作为轻烃产品的来源具有潜力，因为原料的灵活性和减少净CO2排放的可能性。使用生物质生产轻烯烃可能受益于较低的原料成本和税收优惠，但大规模应用中生物质收集和运输的成本以及合成气的生产限制了轻烯烃生产成本降低的潜力。使用生物质主要受到其碳中性性质的鼓励。生物质可以通过热解达到高能量密度，然后转化为合成气。从生物质获得的合成气是CO丰富的，通常含有几种杂质，就像煤基合成气一样。从这些来源获得的合成气需要经过广泛的净化以去除对合成气转化过程中使用的催化剂有害的污染物，如硫。对于大多数转化过程，需要通过水煤气变换反应（WGS）调整H2/CO比。净化和调整H2/CO比后，合成气可用于生产化学品和燃料。最近在美国发现大量页岩气储备，为天然气转化为烯烃开辟了新的可能性。湿页岩气可以直接送入乙烯裂解炉生产乙烯，而干页岩气可用于生产合成气，从而直接或间接转化为轻烯烃。页岩沉积物中天然气供应量的增加导致美国用于生产乙烯的原料发生了重大转变，进而影响了丙烯和丁二烯市场。使用乙烷而不是石脑油作为裂解原料，导致C3和C4烯烃供应紧张，未来这些化学品的价格可能会上涨。不仅在美国，其他国家也发现了大量页岩气储备，如中国，拥有最大的技术可采储量。尽管与页岩气开采相关的环境问题和页岩气生产中的高成本，预计未来几年页岩气用于能源和轻烯烃生产将大幅增加。

Ethylene is also used in the production of other plastics such as polystyrene (PS), polyethylene terephthalate (PET), and polyvinyl chloride (PVC), which are widely used in the packaging, textile, and construction industries. Propylene is a versatile petrochemical which has even more derivatives than ethylene. However, the tremendous growth of polypropylene consumption over the past 15 years has been the main driver of the large increase of the demand of propylene. In 2010, more than 55% of propylene consumption was dedicated to the production of polypropylene in the Western European countries. Approximately 13% of the propylene was used in the production of propylene oxide, which is a chemical precursor for the synthesis of propylene glycol and polyols. The rest of the production was used in the synthesis of cumene (about 8%), acrylonitrile, isopropyl alcohol, and many other industrially relevant chemicals.
