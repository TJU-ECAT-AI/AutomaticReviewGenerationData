I'm going to give you a scientific literature. Then I'm going to ask you some questions about it. I'd like you to first write down exact quotes of parts of the document word by word that would help answer the question, and then I'd like you to answer the question using facts from the quoted content. Do not omit any relevant information from the text, and avoid introducing any falsehoods or assumptions that aren't directly supported by the literature.

spokesperson, Total will pay $40 M to Corbion to acquire part of the joint venture (a sum included in the $140 M). Corbion's lactic acid unit in Thailand will remain under the Dutch group's sole control. Corbion claims to be the world's leading producer of lactic acid, lactic acid compounds and lactides. It is also a leading producer of functional mixtures containing enzymes, emulsifiers, inorganic chemicals and vitamins. It employs 1673 people and in 2015 generated sales of $918.3 M. The new unit will be its first making polylactic acid. It will also be one of a very few commercial polylactic acid units worldwide. At present, the only others belong to NatureWorks (140,000 tonnes) in Nebraska.For Total, the new unit represents a foothold on the bioplastics market. The group wants to develop bioplastics and biofuels operations to complement its tradition hydrocarbon-based businesses. In 2007 Total opened a 15000 tonnes/y demonstration unit in partnership with Galactic in Escanaffles, Belgium but sold its stake in the joint venture (Futerro) to Galactic in Jan 2016 because the technology did not meet its expectations.Original Source: Chimie Pharma Hebdo, 21 Nov 2016, (781), (Website: http://www.industrie.com/ chimie/)  ETAI Information 2016.Loop Energy introduces fuel cell range extender for electric transport Loop Energy introduced on 24 Nov 2016 a new range-extender (REX) power module for heavy-duty electric transport vehicles. At the core of the module is Loop's unique fuel cell design which substantially improves performance, durability and cost. Following a three-year development period, the Loop power module is now being integrated by an original equipment manufacturer and will begin in- service operation in 2017. Fuel cell range extenders, or auxiliary power units, are critical to zero-emission trucks and buses as they extend the range of battery-electric systems using on-board hydrogen fuel. The Loop module provides a breakthrough in terms of cost and power density, making range extension economically viable for a broad array of applications. Loop's patented eFlow fuel cell features a radically improved design, and is the competitive advantage within all Loop fuel cell stacks and power modules. By optimizing air flow inside the fuel cell, Loop's eFlow design produces far greater power density than industry-standard fuel cells. This higher power density allows Loop to simplify and significantly increase the efficiency of the fuel cell stack and system. The Loop 56 kW fuel cell power module offers a power density of 213 W/L to boost the range of battery electric vehicles by more than three times. The module is turn-key,containing the air compressor and controls,enabling a drop-in solution for manufacturers of heavy-duty trucks and transit buses who want increased power and range for a reduced cost.Original Source: Loop Energy, 2016.

Every four to five years, the 65,000 tonnes/y unit undergoes a complex catalyst change. There have been comments centred on the company's decision to further evaluate its BDO unit and other facilities in its intermediates and solvents (I&S) business. The company recorded a $276 M loss in the quarter ended 30 Sep 2016, versus the $55 M loss in 2015. The loss was mainly due to a $181 M impairment charge to detail the value of several I&S assets. Company officials have restated that the firm is at the bottom of the BDO cycle, which has experienced mostly declining prices in the two prior years due to global oversupply,particularly in Asia. Ashland also sustains a $4 M charge due to an unscheduled outage at its Ohio BDO facility in Aug 2016.Original Source: ICIS Chemical Business, 28 Nov-4 Dec 2016, 290 (18), 15 (Website: http://www.icis. com)  Reed Business Information Limited 2016.

Global Bioenergies finishes construction on new Leuna demo isobutene plant Global Bioenergies has completed construction on its demo facility in Leuna, Germany,dedicated to the production of high-purity isobutene from renewable resources. The demo plant, with a nameplate capacity of 100 tonnes/y, is the "only facility in the world'' dedicated to the direct fermentation of gaseous hydrocarbons. It combines two 5000 L fermenters and a complete purification system,mimicking all aspects of a commercial-scale isobutene facility. The project was supported by a 5.7 M grant from the German Federal Ministry for Research, along with a 4.4 M loan from a consortium of French banks, including Societe Generale, BNP-Paribas, CM-CIC and
BPI.

Jacobs wins contract from Borealis to study feasibility of new propane dehydrogenation (PDH) unit at Kallo site Jacobs Engineering has been awarded a contract from Borealis to perform a feasibility study for a proposed propane dehydrogenation (PDH) unit at Borealis' existing production site in Kallo, Belgium. The new world-scale PDH, which would be based on Honeywell UOP's Oleflex technology,would have a targeted production of 740,000 tonnes/y, making it "one of the largest and most efficient facilities in the world''. The study is scheduled for completion by mid-2017. A final investment decision is planned in 3Q 2018 and potential start-up of the plant is scheduled for 2H 2021.

Butene-1 plant planned for Baytown SBE Chemical Partners, a joint venture between Stonebridge Energy Partners and Evonik Industries, has secured funding,customer and engineering deals for its butene-1 plant in Baytown, TX, US. The 100,000 tonnes/y plant, which will open in 2018, will cost around $200 M. It will employ Axen's AlphaButol technology to produce butane-1 by dimerizing ethylene. The site is a former carbon black facility of Evonik.Original Source: Chemical and Engineering News,28 Nov 2016, 94 (47), 14 (Website: http://cen.acs. org/index.html)  American Chemical Society 2016.Topsoe providing technology,services to Grannus NH3 plant in California Haldor Topsoe will license its technology and provide engineering services for a new 250 tonnes/d ammonia plant being built by Grannus LLC in Kern County, CA, US.
