The project is being undertaken in response to rapidly growing demand for more sophisticated, complex catalysts to meet tightening European emission control legislation coming into force over the next few years.
This legislation covers both light and heavy duty vehicles as well as non- road applications such as construction and agricultural equipment. The expansion will be carried out in two phases at total cost of around GBP 50 M and will double the existing capacity of the plant. The expansion project will result in the creation of more than 100 additional jobs.

Rosneft GTL demo plant to include Oxford reactors Oxford Catalysts Group PLC is pleased to announce selection of the Groups technology for a small scale Gas-to-Liquids (GTL) facility commissioned by Rosneft. Rosneft (an integrated oil company majority owned by the Russian government) has announced a partnership with technology commercialisation firm Gazohim Techno (Gazohi), to design and construct a GTL demonstration plant using Oxford Catalysts Fischer- Tropsch technology. This plant will have a capacity of some 10 M cu m/y natural gas (equivalent to approximately 100 barrel/d synthetic crude oil). It will be located at Rosnefts Angarsk Petrochemical Complex in Irkutsk Oblast, Russia,and is targeted to be complete by end
2014. Rosneft has a stated objective
and budget to reduce flaring and make better use of associated gas.
This facility is envisioned as the first of many commercial GTL plants that will convert gas associated with oil production into synthetic crude or high quality downstream products,including synthetic diesel, waxes and naphtha.

Since the new catalyst was introduced just over a year ago, commercial operations employing the improved catalyst have delivered a 2-3% selectivity boost as well as energy savings of between 5% and 10%, both of which have a significant and very positive impact on plant economics,enabling an increase in production without additional operating costs.

a new grassroots facility, this performance improvement can translate into a profit improvement of up to $30 M, when compared to using conventional catalysts. The CATOFIN PDH process is a reliable, proven route for the production of propylene from propane; the process can also be used to produce isobutylenes from isobutane. It operates at an optimum reactor pressure and temperature to maximize conversion of propane (or isobutane) with low investment and operating costs. Sd-Chemie produces the CATOFIN catalyst, and Lummus Technology, a CB&I business sector, has exclusive worldwide licensing rights to the technology.
CATOFIN technology has been selected by 20 licensees worldwide and is in operation in 14 units today,including the largest PDH unit currently in operation with a capacity of 500,000 tonnes/y. A 600,000 tonnes/y CATOFIN PDH unit will start operation in 2013. The CATOFIN process offers superior selectivity and on-stream efficiency.

Sinochem Quanzhou Petrochemical Co Ltd will use two UOP Polybed PSA (Pressure Swing Adsorption) Systems to produce high-purity hydrogen at its new refinery. The hydrogen will be used for the production of clean transportation fuels, including diesel,gasoline, and jet fuel, in the new 12 M tonne/y refinery. Refineries use hydrogen in the hydrocracking process to convert heavy oils to lighter, higher-value products such as transportation fuels. Hydrogen is also used in the hydrotreating process to remove contaminants and improve the quality of end products. Two Polybed PSA Systems will be used to process hydrogen from different streams throughout the facility. The system processing feed from a steam reformer will produce 140,000 normal cu m/hour of hydrogen, and the system processing refinery off-gas will produce 110,000 normal cu m/hour of hydrogen. The facility, located in Quanzhou City, Fujian Province, China, is expected to start up in 2013.

The new facility, which is slated to go online in 2013, will utilize UOPs Oleflex technology to manufacture 450,000 tonne/y of propylene. Additionally, UOP will offer engineering design, catalysts,adsorbents, associated equipment,personnel training, and technical service for the project. The Oleflex process employs catalytic dehydrogenation for the conversion of propane to propylene. The process, in comparison with the alternative propane dehydrogenation process,offers lower manufacturing costs and the highest return on investment. The process is advantageous because of lower operating and capital costs,enabling a high yield of propylene and highest operating flexibility.

Emerald is expected to use Honeywells UOP/Eni Ecofining process technology to produce 85 M gallon/y of Honeywell Green Diesel from non-edible,second-generation oils and animal fats. Unlike biodiesel, Honeywell Green Diesel is a drop-in replacement for traditional diesel. Chemically identical to petroleum-based diesel, Honeywell Green Diesel can be used in any proportion in existing fuel tanks without infrastructure changes.
International Alliance Group (IAG) will provide engineering, procurement,and construction services for the project. UOP and Eni SpA jointly developed the UOP/Eni Ecofining process, which uses hydroprocessing technology to convert non-edible natural oils and animal fats to Honeywell Green Diesel. The fuel offers improved performance over biodiesel and petroleum-based diesel,including a high cetane value of 80 compared with a cetane range of 40 to 60 found in diesel at the pump today.
