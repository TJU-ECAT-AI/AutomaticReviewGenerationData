Propylene, a byproduct of these processes, has seen increased demand, leading to selective catalytic dehydrogenation of propane. Isobutane dehydrogenation units produce isobutylene, converted to MTBE or isooctane. Synthesizing light olefins is thermodynamically challenging, requiring higher temperatures for dehydrogenation of light paraffins than heavy ones; for instance, propane needs at least 580°C for 40% conversion, compared to 450°C for dodecane.", "Doi": "10.1007/s11244-012-9917-9"},
{"DOC": "Light olefins, like propylene and ethylene, are vital in the chemical industry for producing plastics, detergents, and synthetic fibers. Steam cracking, using ethane as feed, yields high amounts of these olefins but also produces a mix of other hydrocarbons and hydrogen. Steam reforming, though costly due to high pressure and temperature requirements (15-40 atm, 700-1000°C), faces heat transfer and coke management challenges. Both methods have overall efficiencies of 75% or less. Process chemistry, including free-radical routes and catalytic partial oxidation, converts heavier alkanes in natural gas into these valuable olefins.", "Doi": "10.1126/science.1226840"},
