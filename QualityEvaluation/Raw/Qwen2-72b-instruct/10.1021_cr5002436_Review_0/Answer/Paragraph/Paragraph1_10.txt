Light olefins, primarily ethylene and propylene, are pivotal in the chemical industry, serving as fundamental building blocks for a vast array of products, including plastics, solvents, and synthetic fibers. Their industrial importance is underscored by the massive global demand, driving continuous innovation in production methods. Traditionally, steam cracking of naphtha or gas oil has been the dominant process, but the advent of shale gas has led to a significant shift towards the cracking of lighter feedstocks like ethane and propane. This change not only offers economic benefits but also poses new thermodynamic challenges. The high temperatures required for cracking favor the formation of aromatics and coke, necessitating precise control to maximize olefin yield. Moreover, the exothermic nature of the reactions can lead to heat management issues, requiring sophisticated reactor design and operation. As the industry pushes for more sustainable and efficient production, research into catalytic processes and alternative feedstocks, such as biomass-derived materials, is gaining momentum, aiming to address these thermodynamic hurdles while reducing environmental impact.
