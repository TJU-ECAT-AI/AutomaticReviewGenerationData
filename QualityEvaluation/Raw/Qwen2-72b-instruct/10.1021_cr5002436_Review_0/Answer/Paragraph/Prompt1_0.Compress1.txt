{"DOC": "The chemical industry anticipates a significant rise in demand for olefins, notably ethylene and propylene. These are primarily produced through steam cracking, fluid-catalytic-cracking, and catalytic dehydrogenation. Direct conversion of alkanes to olefins, particularly ethane and propane to commodity chemical intermediates, could revolutionize the industry. The economic viability of alkane-based processes hinges on the catalyst's efficiency for alkane conversion and selectivity to desired products, addressing thermodynamic challenges related to temperature, pressure, and alkane chain length.", "Doi": "10.1016/j.cattod.2007.05.009"},

Propylene, a byproduct of LPG cracking, has seen increased demand, leading to propane dehydrogenation units. Isobutane dehydrogenation produces isobutylene, converted to MTBE or isooctane. Dehydrogenation of light paraffins, like propane, requires higher temperatures than heavy paraffins; for instance, propane needs at least 580 C for 40% conversion, compared to 450 C for dodecane.", "Doi": "10.1007/s11244-012-9917-9"},
{"DOC": "Light olefins, including propylene and ethylene, are vital in the chemical industry for producing plastics, detergents, and synthetic fibers. Steam cracking, using ethane as feed, yields high amounts of ethylene and propylene but also produces a mix of olefins, hydrocarbons, and hydrogen. Steam reforming, though costly, requires high pressures (15-40 atm) and temperatures (700-1000°C) and faces heat transfer and coke management challenges. Overall, these processes have efficiencies of 75% or less.
