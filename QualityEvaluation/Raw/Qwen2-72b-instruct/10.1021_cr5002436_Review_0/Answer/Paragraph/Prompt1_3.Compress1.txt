These are primarily produced through steam cracking, fluid-catalytic-cracking, and catalytic dehydrogenation. The economic viability of alkane-based chemical processes is determined by the catalyst's effectiveness for conversion and selectivity to desired products, addressing thermodynamic challenges in synthesis.", "Doi": "10.1016/j.cattod.2007.05.009"},
{"DOC": "Light olefins, ethylene and propylene, are the top petrochemical intermediates. Ethylene is mainly produced by thermal cracking of ethane, LPG, and heavier feedstocks. Propylene, a byproduct of LPG and heavier feedstock cracking, has seen its demand outpace supply, leading to the development of propane dehydrogenation units. Isobutane dehydrogenation units produce isobutylene, which is converted to MTBE or isooctane. The dehydrogenation of light paraffins to produce light olefins is thermodynamically challenging, requiring higher temperatures than for heavy paraffins; for instance, propane needs at least 580°C for 40% conversion, compared to 450°C for dodecane.", "Doi": "10.1007/s11244-012-9917-9"},
{"DOC": "Light olefins, including propylene and ethylene, are vital in the chemical industry for manufacturing plastics, detergents, and synthetic fibers. Steam cracking, using ethane as feed, can yield high amounts of these olefins but also produces a mix of other hydrocarbons and hydrogen.

Steam cracking is the primary production method for light olefins, with capacity exceeding 1 million tons of ethylene annually. Catalytic cracking, particularly FCC, also yields propylene. Increasing propylene production through propane dehydrogenation is anticipated due to thermodynamic limits in naphtha crackers and low propylene output in ethane-based crackers. Catalytic alkane dehydrogenation faces challenges due to thermodynamic limitations and high endothermic reaction temperatures, requiring 825-975 K for propane and 775-825 K for isobutane, with decreasing temperatures for higher carbon number alkanes.", "Doi": "10.1002/9783527610044.hetcat0162"},

{"DOC": "Light olefins, including propylene and ethylene, are vital to the chemical industry, serving as building blocks for plastics, detergents, and synthetic fibers. Propylene production through catalytic dehydrogenation of propane has seen steady growth, influenced by economic conditions and propane availability, but environmental concerns may limit isobutane dehydrogenation. Ethylene production via catalytic dehydrogenation over platinum catalysts is selective but faces challenges with ethane due to severe operating conditions that cause catalyst coking or require costly vacuum operations. Higher temperatures are required for dehydrogenating light paraffins compared to heavy paraffins, with propane needing at least 580 degrees Celsius for 40% conversion, while dodecane requires only 450 degrees Celsius. The equilibrium constant for dehydrogenation increases with carbon number. Catalytic dehydrogenation has been commercial since the 1930s, with significant annual production volumes.

High temperatures (>600°C) and lower pressures (<30 psig) are required for economic conversion, necessitated by the high energy demand for hydrogen removal from alkanes. Catalyst design must balance chemical and mass transport properties for high activity and selectivity, often using shaped particles and pore architecture modifications.
