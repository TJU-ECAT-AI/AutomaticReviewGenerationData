          [1] "A high yield of eth- ylene and propylene can be achieved under properly selected reaction conditions when the primary feed is ethane; but steam crack- ing still produces a mixture of olefi n prod- ucts along with other hydrocarbons and H2."
          [2] "Steam reform- ing is costly; it requires high operating pres- sures and temperatures (15 to 40 atm, 700 to 1000C) in expensive reactors with heat transfer and coke management challenges."

          Light olefins, such as propylene and ethylene, are crucial in the chemical industry for the production of a wide range of products including plastics, detergents, and synthetic fibers. The key production methods involve steam cracking and steam reforming. Steam cracking, when using ethane as the primary feed, can achieve high yields of ethylene and propylene, but it also produces a mixture of other olefin products, hydrocarbons, and hydrogen. Steam reforming, on the other hand, is an expensive process that requires high operating pressures and temperatures, and it faces challenges with heat transfer and coke management. The overall efficiencies of these processes are typically 75% or lower. Light olefins, such as propylene and ethylene, are produced from heavier alkanes in natural gas through process chemistry, including free-radical routes or catalytic partial oxidation. Ethylene and propylene can be obtained in high yields under appropriate reaction conditions when ethane is the primary feedstock. However, steam cracking produces a mixture of olefin products along with other hydrocarbons and hydrogen. Steam reforming is an expensive process that requires high operating pressures and temperatures, and it faces challenges in heat transfer and coke management.
