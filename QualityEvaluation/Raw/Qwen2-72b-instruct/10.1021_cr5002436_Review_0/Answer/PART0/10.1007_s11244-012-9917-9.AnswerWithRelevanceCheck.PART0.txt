          Ethylene and pro- pylene are No.1 and No.2 largest volume petrochemical intermediates.
          For ethylene thermal cracking of ethane, LPG and heavier feedstocks continues to be the primary route.
          Thermal cracking of LPG or heavier feedstocks also provide sig- nificant quantity of propylene byproduct.
          However, over the past two decades propylene growth rate has out-paced these conventional supply routes leading to construction of number of com- mercial units for selective catalytic dehydrogenation of propane to propylene.
          Also during 1990s several isobutane dehydrogenation units were built producing isobutylene that were converted to MTBE or dimerized and hydroge- nated to produce isooctane, a high octane gasoline blending components.
          The equilibrium constant for paraffin dehydrogenation increases significantly as the carbon number increases.
          The temperature required for the dehydrogenation of light paraffins is much higher than for heavy paraffins.
          For example, at 1 atm absolute pressure for 40 % conversion,the dehydrogenation of propane requires a temperature of at least about 580 C, while dodecane can be theoretically dehydrogenated to the same extent at only 450 C.

          Light olefins, such as propylene and ethylene, are the top two largest volume petrochemical intermediates. Ethylene is primarily produced through the thermal cracking of ethane, LPG, and heavier feedstocks. Propylene is a byproduct of thermal cracking of LPG and heavier feedstocks. Over the past two decades, the growth rate of propylene demand has outpaced conventional supply routes, leading to the construction of commercial units for selective catalytic dehydrogenation of propane to propylene. Isobutane dehydrogenation units were also built in the 1990s to produce isobutylene, which is then converted to MTBE or dimerized and hydrogenated to produce isooctane, a high octane gasoline blending component. The production of light olefins is thermodynamically challenging due to the high temperatures required for dehydrogenation of light paraffins compared to heavy paraffins. For example, at 1 atm absolute pressure for 40% conversion, the dehydrogenation of propane requires a temperature of at least about 580 C, while dodecane can be theoretically dehydrogenated to the same extent at only 450 C.

          轻烯烃，如丙烯和乙烯，是前两大最大体积的石化中间体。乙烯主要通过乙烷、LPG和重质原料的热裂解生产。丙烯是LPG和重质原料热裂解的副产品。在过去二十年中，丙烯需求的增长率超过了传统供应路线，导致了选择性催化脱氢生产丙烯的商业装置的建设。在1990年代，还建造了异丁烷脱氢装置，用于生产异丁烯，然后将其转化为MTBE或二聚化并氢化以生产异辛烷，这是一种高辛烷值汽油调和组分。轻烯烃的生产在热力学上具有挑战性，因为轻质烷烃脱氢所需的高温与重质烷烃相比更高。例如，在1 atm绝对压力下，40%转化率时，丙烷脱氢需要至少580 C的温度，而十二烷在理论上可以在仅450 C的温度下脱氢到相同的程度。
