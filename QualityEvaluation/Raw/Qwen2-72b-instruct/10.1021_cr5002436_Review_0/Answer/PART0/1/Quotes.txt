Ethylene and pro- pylene are No.1 and No.2 largest volume petrochemical intermediates.
          For ethylene thermal cracking of ethane, LPG and heavier feedstocks continues to be the primary route.
          Thermal cracking of LPG or heavier feedstocks also provide sig- nificant quantity of propylene byproduct.
          However, over the past two decades propylene growth rate has out-paced these conventional supply routes leading to construction of number of com- mercial units for selective catalytic dehydrogenation of propane to propylene.
          Also during 1990s several isobutane dehydrogenation units were built producing isobutylene that were converted to MTBE or dimerized and hydroge- nated to produce isooctane, a high octane gasoline blending components.
          The equilibrium constant for paraffin dehydrogenation increases significantly as the carbon number increases.
          The temperature required for the dehydrogenation of light paraffins is much higher than for heavy paraffins.
          For example, at 1 atm absolute pressure for 40 % conversion,the dehydrogenation of propane requires a temperature of at least about 580 C, while dodecane can be theoretically dehydrogenated to the same extent at only 450 C.

[1] "Ethylene, propylene, and butylenes are key building blocks in the chemical industry. Throughout this review we refer to C2C4 olefins as lower or light olefins. These base chemicals are among the organic chemicals with the largest production volumes worldwide (Table 1). Their broad spectrum of derivatives result in a very diverse end market ranging from packing materials and synthetic textiles to antifreezing agents, solvents, and coatings."
          [2] "Ethylene is the largest-volume petrochemical produced worldwide. It is used to produce intermediate chemicals of high importance in industry such as ethyl benzene, ethylene oxide, and ethylene dichloride, which were listed, along with ethylene, in the top 30 highest volume chemicals in the United States in 2000. (2) The major chemicals derived from ethylene and their derivatives are shown in Figure 1. Ethylene is mainly used by the plastics industry. In 2010, approximately 61% of the total consumption of ethylene was for production of polyethylene in the Western European countries (Figure 2). Ethylene is also used in the production of other plastics such as polystyrene (PS), polyethylene terephthalate (PET), and polyvinyl chloride (PVC), which are widely used in the packaging, textile, and construction industries."
          [3] "Propylene is a versatile petrochemical which has even more derivatives than ethylene. However, the tremendous growth of polypropylene consumption over the past 15 years has been the main driver of the large increase of the demand of propylene. In 2010, more than 55% of propylene consumption was dedicated to the production of polypropylene in the Western European countries. Approximately 13% of the propylene was used in the production of propylene oxide, which is a chemical precursor for the synthesis of propylene glycol and polyols. The rest of the production was used in the synthesis of cumene (about 8%), acrylonitrile, isopropyl alcohol, and many other industrially relevant chemicals. (3)"

[1] "Light alkenes are among the most important intermediate products in the chemical industry. For example, in 2003,the worldwide production of ethene was 100 × 106 t and approximately 56 × 106 t for propene [1]. Ethene is primarily used for the production of polymers,especially polyethylenes (HDPE, LDPE, LLDPE) or precursors of other polymer compounds such as 1,2- dichloroethane/vinyl chloride as a precursor of PVC,ethylbenzene/styrene as a precursor of polystyrene or ethylene oxide as a precursor of ethylene glycols or polyethoxylates."
          [2] "Propene is also important for the production of polymers, mainly for the production of polypropylene Corresponding author."
          [3] "Steam cracking of hydrocarbons is the most important process for the production of light alkenes. World-scale steam crackers have the capacity to produce more than 106 t per annum of ethene."
          [4] "Another source of low alkenes, especially propene, is catalytic cracking in the form of fluid catalytic cracking (FCC). In a refinery, FCC is used for the production of fuel components (gasoline and kerosene or diesel oils) from high-boiling crude oil distillation fractions. In addition,low alkenes, especially propene and butenes, are also formed in this process, which at present is preferably performed with zeolite-type catalysts."
          [5] "An increase in the share of the catalytic dehydrogenation of propane in the overall production of propene can be expected. On the one hand, the production of propene in existing naphtha crackers cannot be increased without limit at the cost of ethene production since, as a matter of principle, thermodynamic limits prevent a propene/ethene ratio of approximately 0.60.7 from being exceeded. On the other hand, predominantly ethane-based steam crackers are being built that produce only a small amount of propene, and the production of propene in these systems is generally not economically justifiable."
          [6] "Furthermore, the predicted growth rate for propene is higher than that for ethene [4]."
          [7] "The technical realization of catalytic alkane dehydrogena- tion is problematic, despite its simple stoichiometry. On the one hand, this is due to the thermodynamic limitation of alkane conversion. On the other hand, the reaction is strongly endothermic."
          [8] "To achieve technically relevant conversions of 3050%, reaction temperatures of 825975 K are required for propane and 775825 K are correspondingly required for isobutane. As the carbon number of the alkanes to be dehydrogenated increases, the reaction temperature falls."

[1] "Because of their extensive use as chemical building blocks, light olefins, such as propylene (propene) and ethylene (ethene), are among the most important types of compounds in the chemical industry. Light olefins are the feedstock employed in the production of a vast array of chemicals, including polymers (e.g., polyethylene and polypropylene), oxygenates (e.g., ethylene glycol, acetaldehyde, acetone, and propylene oxide), and important chemical intermediates (e.g., ethylbenzene and propionaldehyde)."
          [2] "The demand of these building blocks has increased steadily over the last years, all major markets registering a positive growth in demand and production in recent years with the exception of the Eurozone, due to the effects of the recent economic downturn."
          [3] "Steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) of naphtha, light diesel, and other oil byproducts are the most common methods for obtaining these light olefins."
          [4] "The reaction is thermodynamically limited and highly endothermic, which, according to Le Chateliers principle, implies that higher reaction temperature and/or lower paraffin partial pressure are needed to achieve high conversions."
          [5] "Indeed, temperatures of 550750 C are typically required in the dehydrogenation of C2C4 paraffins to obtain alkane conversions 50% at 1 bar (see Figure 8)."
          [6] "Moreover, given that the enthalpy required to dehydrogenate alkanes decreases as the chain becomes longer (ΔH2980 = 137 kJ mol1 for ethane, 124.3 kJ mol1 for propane, and 117.6 kJ mol1 for isobutane dehydrogenation), a considerably larger amount of energy is required to dehydrogenate light paraffins on a mass basis."

[1] "The world propylene production capacity, based on the use of catalytic dehydrogenation of propane has increased steadily over the past 10 years [13] and is ex- pected to grow even further under the right economic conditions relative to the availability of propane; on the other hand, environmental concerns on the use of MTBE are expected to adversely impact the future ex- pansion of isobutane dehydrogenation applications."
          [2] "Although production of ethylene via catalytic dehy- drogenation over Pt catalysts is very selective (about 95%), extension of this dehydrogenation technology to ethane has not taken place due to the need for even more severe operating conditions; higher temperatures and lower pressures. Such conditions cause excessive coking of the catalyst or require costlier operation under vacuum."
          [3] "The equilibrium conversion increases at higher Fig. 4 indicates that the temperature required for the dehydrogenation of light paraffins is much higher than for heavy paraf- fins. For 40% conversion, for example, the dehydro- genation of propane requires a temperature of at least about 580 C, while dodecane can be theoretically dehydrogenated to the same extent at only 450 C."
          [4] "The equilibrium constant for paraffin dehydrogena- tion increases significantly as the carbon number in- creases."
          [1] "Catalytic paraffin dehydrogenation for the production of olefins has been in commercial use since the late 1930s, while catalytic paraffin oxydehydrogenation for olefin production has not yet been commercialized."
          [2] "Commercial processes for the catalytic dehydrogenation of propane and butanes attain per-pass conversions in the range of 3060%, while the catalytic dehydrogenation of C10C14 paraffins typically operates at conversion levels of 1020%."
          [3] "In the year 2000, nearly 7 million metric tons of C3C4 olefins and 2 million metric tons of C10C14 range olefins were produced via catalytic dehydrogenation."
          [4] "Oxydehydrogenation employs catalysts containing vanadium and, more recently, platinum."
          [5] "Oxydehydrogenation at 1000 C and very short residence time over Pt and Pt-Sn catalysts can produce ethylene in higher yields than in steam cracking."
          [6] "However, there are a number of issues related to safety and process upsets that need to be addressed."
          [7] "Important objectives in oxydehydrogenation are attaining high selectivity to olefins with high conversion of paraffin and minimizing potentially dangerous mixtures of paraffin and oxidant."
          [8] "More recently, the use of carbon dioxide as an oxidant for ethane conversion to ethylene has been investigated as a potential way to reduce the negative impact of dangerous oxidantparaffin mixtures and to achieve higher selectivity."
          [9] "While catalytic dehydrogenation reflects a relatively mature and well-established technology, oxydehydrogenation can in many respects be characterized as still being in its infancy."
          [10] "Oxydehydrogenation, however, offers substantial thermodynamic advantages and is an area of active research in many fronts."

[1] "Ethylene, propylene, and butylenes are key building blocks in the chemical industry. Throughout this review we refer to C2C4 olefins as lower or light olefins. These base chemicals are among the organic chemicals with the largest production volumes worldwide (Table 1). Their broad spectrum of derivatives result in a very diverse end market ranging from packing materials and synthetic textiles to antifreezing agents, solvents, and coatings."
          [2] "Ethylene is the largest-volume petrochemical produced worldwide. It is used to produce intermediate chemicals of high importance in industry such as ethyl benzene, ethylene oxide, and ethylene dichloride, which were listed, along with ethylene, in the top 30 highest volume chemicals in the United States in 2000. (2) The major chemicals derived from ethylene and their derivatives are shown in Figure 1. Ethylene is mainly used by the plastics industry. In 2010, approximately 61% of the total consumption of ethylene was for production of polyethylene in the Western European countries (Figure 2). Ethylene is also used in the production of other plastics such as polystyrene (PS), polyethylene terephthalate (PET), and polyvinyl chloride (PVC), which are widely used in the packaging, textile, and construction industries."
          [3] "Propylene is a versatile petrochemical which has even more derivatives than ethylene. However, the tremendous growth of polypropylene consumption over the past 15 years has been the main driver of the large increase of the demand of propylene. In 2010, more than 55% of propylene consumption was dedicated to the production of polypropylene in the Western European countries. Approximately 13% of the propylene was used in the production of propylene oxide, which is a chemical precursor for the synthesis of propylene glycol and polyols. The rest of the production was used in the synthesis of cumene (about 8%), acrylonitrile, isopropyl alcohol, and many other industrially relevant chemicals. (3)"

[1] "Light alkenes are among the most important intermediate products in the chemical industry. For example, in 2003,the worldwide production of ethene was 100 × 106 t and approximately 56 × 106 t for propene [1]. Ethene is primarily used for the production of polymers,especially polyethylenes (HDPE, LDPE, LLDPE) or precursors of other polymer compounds such as 1,2- dichloroethane/vinyl chloride as a precursor of PVC,ethylbenzene/styrene as a precursor of polystyrene or ethylene oxide as a precursor of ethylene glycols or polyethoxylates."
          [2] "Propene is also important for the production of polymers, mainly for the production of polypropylene Corresponding author."
          [3] "Steam cracking of hydrocarbons is the most important process for the production of light alkenes. World-scale steam crackers have the capacity to produce more than 106 t per annum of ethene."
          [4] "Another source of low alkenes, especially propene, is catalytic cracking in the form of fluid catalytic cracking (FCC). In a refinery, FCC is used for the production of fuel components (gasoline and kerosene or diesel oils) from high-boiling crude oil distillation fractions. In addition,low alkenes, especially propene and butenes, are also formed in this process, which at present is preferably performed with zeolite-type catalysts."
          [5] "An increase in the share of the catalytic dehydrogenation of propane in the overall production of propene can be expected. On the one hand, the production of propene in existing naphtha crackers cannot be increased without limit at the cost of ethene production since, as a matter of principle, thermodynamic limits prevent a propene/ethene ratio of approximately 0.60.7 from being exceeded. On the other hand, predominantly ethane-based steam crackers are being built that produce only a small amount of propene, and the production of propene in these systems is generally not economically justifiable."
          [6] "Furthermore, the predicted growth rate for propene is higher than that for ethene [4]."
          [7] "The technical realization of catalytic alkane dehydrogena- tion is problematic, despite its simple stoichiometry. On the one hand, this is due to the thermodynamic limitation of alkane conversion. On the other hand, the reaction is strongly endothermic."
          [8] "To achieve technically relevant conversions of 3050%, reaction temperatures of 825975 K are required for propane and 775825 K are correspondingly required for isobutane. As the carbon number of the alkanes to be dehydrogenated increases, the reaction temperature falls."

[1] "Because of their extensive use as chemical building blocks, light olefins, such as propylene (propene) and ethylene (ethene), are among the most important types of compounds in the chemical industry. Light olefins are the feedstock employed in the production of a vast array of chemicals, including polymers (e.g., polyethylene and polypropylene), oxygenates (e.g., ethylene glycol, acetaldehyde, acetone, and propylene oxide), and important chemical intermediates (e.g., ethylbenzene and propionaldehyde)."
          [2] "The demand of these building blocks has increased steadily over the last years, all major markets registering a positive growth in demand and production in recent years with the exception of the Eurozone, due to the effects of the recent economic downturn."
          [3] "Steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) of naphtha, light diesel, and other oil byproducts are the most common methods for obtaining these light olefins."
          [4] "The reaction is thermodynamically limited and highly endothermic, which, according to Le Chateliers principle, implies that higher reaction temperature and/or lower paraffin partial pressure are needed to achieve high conversions."
          [5] "Indeed, temperatures of 550750 C are typically required in the dehydrogenation of C2C4 paraffins to obtain alkane conversions 50% at 1 bar (see Figure 8)."
          [6] "Moreover, given that the enthalpy required to dehydrogenate alkanes decreases as the chain becomes longer (ΔH2980 = 137 kJ mol1 for ethane, 124.3 kJ mol1 for propane, and 117.6 kJ mol1 for isobutane dehydrogenation), a considerably larger amount of energy is required to dehydrogenate light paraffins on a mass basis."

[1] "The world propylene production capacity, based on the use of catalytic dehydrogenation of propane has increased steadily over the past 10 years [13] and is ex- pected to grow even further under the right economic conditions relative to the availability of propane; on the other hand, environmental concerns on the use of MTBE are expected to adversely impact the future ex- pansion of isobutane dehydrogenation applications."
          [2] "Although production of ethylene via catalytic dehy- drogenation over Pt catalysts is very selective (about 95%), extension of this dehydrogenation technology to ethane has not taken place due to the need for even more severe operating conditions; higher temperatures and lower pressures. Such conditions cause excessive coking of the catalyst or require costlier operation under vacuum."
          [3] "The equilibrium conversion increases at higher Fig. 4 indicates that the temperature required for the dehydrogenation of light paraffins is much higher than for heavy paraf- fins. For 40% conversion, for example, the dehydro- genation of propane requires a temperature of at least about 580 C, while dodecane can be theoretically dehydrogenated to the same extent at only 450 C."
          [4] "The equilibrium constant for paraffin dehydrogena- tion increases significantly as the carbon number in- creases."
          [1] "Catalytic paraffin dehydrogenation for the production of olefins has been in commercial use since the late 1930s, while catalytic paraffin oxydehydrogenation for olefin production has not yet been commercialized."
          [2] "Commercial processes for the catalytic dehydrogenation of propane and butanes attain per-pass conversions in the range of 3060%, while the catalytic dehydrogenation of C10C14 paraffins typically operates at conversion levels of 1020%."
          [3] "In the year 2000, nearly 7 million metric tons of C3C4 olefins and 2 million metric tons of C10C14 range olefins were produced via catalytic dehydrogenation."
          [4] "Oxydehydrogenation employs catalysts containing vanadium and, more recently, platinum."
          [5] "Oxydehydrogenation at 1000 C and very short residence time over Pt and Pt-Sn catalysts can produce ethylene in higher yields than in steam cracking."
          [6] "However, there are a number of issues related to safety and process upsets that need to be addressed."
          [7] "Important objectives in oxydehydrogenation are attaining high selectivity to olefins with high conversion of paraffin and minimizing potentially dangerous mixtures of paraffin and oxidant."
          [8] "More recently, the use of carbon dioxide as an oxidant for ethane conversion to ethylene has been investigated as a potential way to reduce the negative impact of dangerous oxidantparaffin mixtures and to achieve higher selectivity."
          [9] "While catalytic dehydrogenation reflects a relatively mature and well-established technology, oxydehydrogenation can in many respects be characterized as still being in its infancy."
          [10] "Oxydehydrogenation, however, offers substantial thermodynamic advantages and is an area of active research in many fronts."





Ethylene and pro- pylene are No.1 and No.2 largest volume petrochemical intermediates.
          For ethylene thermal cracking of ethane, LPG and heavier feedstocks continues to be the primary route.
          Thermal cracking of LPG or heavier feedstocks also provide sig- nificant quantity of propylene byproduct.
          However, over the past two decades propylene growth rate has out-paced these conventional supply routes leading to construction of number of com- mercial units for selective catalytic dehydrogenation of propane to propylene.
          Also during 1990s several isobutane dehydrogenation units were built producing isobutylene that were converted to MTBE or dimerized and hydroge- nated to produce isooctane, a high octane gasoline blending components.
          The equilibrium constant for paraffin dehydrogenation increases significantly as the carbon number increases.
          The temperature required for the dehydrogenation of light paraffins is much higher than for heavy paraffins.
          For example, at 1 atm absolute pressure for 40 % conversion,the dehydrogenation of propane requires a temperature of at least about 580 C, while dodecane can be theoretically dehydrogenated to the same extent at only 450 C.

In 2010, approximately 61% of the total consumption of ethylene was for production of polyethylene in the Western European countries (Figure 2). Ethylene is also used in the production of other plastics such as polystyrene (PS), polyethylene terephthalate (PET), and polyvinyl chloride (PVC), which are widely used in the packaging, textile, and construction industries."
          [3] "Propylene is a versatile petrochemical which has even more derivatives than ethylene. However, the tremendous growth of polypropylene consumption over the past 15 years has been the main driver of the large increase of the demand of propylene. In 2010, more than 55% of propylene consumption was dedicated to the production of polypropylene in the Western European countries. Approximately 13% of the propylene was used in the production of propylene oxide, which is a chemical precursor for the synthesis of propylene glycol and polyols. The rest of the production was used in the synthesis of cumene (about 8%), acrylonitrile, isopropyl alcohol, and many other industrially relevant chemicals. (3)"

[1] "Light alkenes are among the most important intermediate products in the chemical industry. For example, in 2003,the worldwide production of ethene was 100 × 106 t and approximately 56 × 106 t for propene [1]. Ethene is primarily used for the production of polymers,especially polyethylenes (HDPE, LDPE, LLDPE) or precursors of other polymer compounds such as 1,2- dichloroethane/vinyl chloride as a precursor of PVC,ethylbenzene/styrene as a precursor of polystyrene or ethylene oxide as a precursor of ethylene glycols or polyethoxylates."
          [2] "Propene is also important for the production of polymers, mainly for the production of polypropylene Corresponding author."
          [3] "Steam cracking of hydrocarbons is the most important process for the production of light alkenes. World-scale steam crackers have the capacity to produce more than 106 t per annum of ethene."
          [4] "Another source of low alkenes, especially propene, is catalytic cracking in the form of fluid catalytic cracking (FCC). In a refinery, FCC is used for the production of fuel components (gasoline and kerosene or diesel oils) from high-boiling crude oil distillation fractions. In addition,low alkenes, especially propene and butenes, are also formed in this process, which at present is preferably performed with zeolite-type catalysts."
          [5] "An increase in the share of the catalytic dehydrogenation of propane in the overall production of propene can be expected. On the one hand, the production of propene in existing naphtha crackers cannot be increased without limit at the cost of ethene production since, as a matter of principle, thermodynamic limits prevent a propene/ethene ratio of approximately 0.60.7 from being exceeded. On the other hand, predominantly ethane-based steam crackers are being built that produce only a small amount of propene, and the production of propene in these systems is generally not economically justifiable."
          [6] "Furthermore, the predicted growth rate for propene is higher than that for ethene [4]."
          [7] "The technical realization of catalytic alkane dehydrogena- tion is problematic, despite its simple stoichiometry. On the one hand, this is due to the thermodynamic limitation of alkane conversion. On the other hand, the reaction is strongly endothermic."
          [8] "To achieve technically relevant conversions of 3050%, reaction temperatures of 825975 K are required for propane and 775825 K are correspondingly required for isobutane. As the carbon number of the alkanes to be dehydrogenated increases, the reaction temperature falls."

[1] "Because of their extensive use as chemical building blocks, light olefins, such as propylene (propene) and ethylene (ethene), are among the most important types of compounds in the chemical industry. Light olefins are the feedstock employed in the production of a vast array of chemicals, including polymers (e.g., polyethylene and polypropylene), oxygenates (e.g., ethylene glycol, acetaldehyde, acetone, and propylene oxide), and important chemical intermediates (e.g., ethylbenzene and propionaldehyde)."
          [2] "The demand of these building blocks has increased steadily over the last years, all major markets registering a positive growth in demand and production in recent years with the exception of the Eurozone, due to the effects of the recent economic downturn."
          [3] "Steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) of naphtha, light diesel, and other oil byproducts are the most common methods for obtaining these light olefins."
          [4] "The reaction is thermodynamically limited and highly endothermic, which, according to Le Chateliers principle, implies that higher reaction temperature and/or lower paraffin partial pressure are needed to achieve high conversions."
          [5] "Indeed, temperatures of 550750 C are typically required in the dehydrogenation of C2C4 paraffins to obtain alkane conversions 50% at 1 bar (see Figure 8)."
          [6] "Moreover, given that the enthalpy required to dehydrogenate alkanes decreases as the chain becomes longer (ΔH2980 = 137 kJ mol1 for ethane, 124.3 kJ mol1 for propane, and 117.6 kJ mol1 for isobutane dehydrogenation), a considerably larger amount of energy is required to dehydrogenate light paraffins on a mass basis."

[1] "The world propylene production capacity, based on the use of catalytic dehydrogenation of propane has increased steadily over the past 10 years [13] and is ex- pected to grow even further under the right economic conditions relative to the availability of propane; on the other hand, environmental concerns on the use of MTBE are expected to adversely impact the future ex- pansion of isobutane dehydrogenation applications."
          [2] "Although production of ethylene via catalytic dehy- drogenation over Pt catalysts is very selective (about 95%), extension of this dehydrogenation technology to ethane has not taken place due to the need for even more severe operating conditions; higher temperatures and lower pressures. Such conditions cause excessive coking of the catalyst or require costlier operation under vacuum."
          [3] "The equilibrium conversion increases at higher Fig. 4 indicates that the temperature required for the dehydrogenation of light paraffins is much higher than for heavy paraf- fins. For 40% conversion, for example, the dehydro- genation of propane requires a temperature of at least about 580 C, while dodecane can be theoretically dehydrogenated to the same extent at only 450 C."
          [4] "The equilibrium constant for paraffin dehydrogena- tion increases significantly as the carbon number in- creases."
          [1] "Catalytic paraffin dehydrogenation for the production of olefins has been in commercial use since the late 1930s, while catalytic paraffin oxydehydrogenation for olefin production has not yet been commercialized."
          [2] "Commercial processes for the catalytic dehydrogenation of propane and butanes attain per-pass conversions in the range of 3060%, while the catalytic dehydrogenation of C10C14 paraffins typically operates at conversion levels of 1020%."
          [3] "In the year 2000, nearly 7 million metric tons of C3C4 olefins and 2 million metric tons of C10C14 range olefins were produced via catalytic dehydrogenation."
          [4] "Oxydehydrogenation employs catalysts containing vanadium and, more recently, platinum."
          [5] "Oxydehydrogenation at 1000 C and very short residence time over Pt and Pt-Sn catalysts can produce ethylene in higher yields than in steam cracking."
          [6] "However, there are a number of issues related to safety and process upsets that need to be addressed."
          [7] "Important objectives in oxydehydrogenation are attaining high selectivity to olefins with high conversion of paraffin and minimizing potentially dangerous mixtures of paraffin and oxidant."
          [8] "More recently, the use of carbon dioxide as an oxidant for ethane conversion to ethylene has been investigated as a potential way to reduce the negative impact of dangerous oxidantparaffin mixtures and to achieve higher selectivity."
          [9] "While catalytic dehydrogenation reflects a relatively mature and well-established technology, oxydehydrogenation can in many respects be characterized as still being in its infancy."
          [10] "Oxydehydrogenation, however, offers substantial thermodynamic advantages and is an area of active research in many fronts."





Ethylene and pro- pylene are No.1 and No.2 largest volume petrochemical intermediates.
          For ethylene thermal cracking of ethane, LPG and heavier feedstocks continues to be the primary route.
          Thermal cracking of LPG or heavier feedstocks also provide sig- nificant quantity of propylene byproduct.
          However, over the past two decades propylene growth rate has out-paced these conventional supply routes leading to construction of number of com- mercial units for selective catalytic dehydrogenation of propane to propylene.
          Also during 1990s several isobutane dehydrogenation units were built producing isobutylene that were converted to MTBE or dimerized and hydroge- nated to produce isooctane, a high octane gasoline blending components.
          The equilibrium constant for paraffin dehydrogenation increases significantly as the carbon number increases.
          The temperature required for the dehydrogenation of light paraffins is much higher than for heavy paraffins.
          For example, at 1 atm absolute pressure for 40 % conversion,the dehydrogenation of propane requires a temperature of at least about 580 C, while dodecane can be theoretically dehydrogenated to the same extent at only 450 C.

          [6] "Furthermore, the predicted growth rate for propene is higher than that for ethene [4]."
          [7] "The technical realization of catalytic alkane dehydrogena- tion is problematic, despite its simple stoichiometry. On the one hand, this is due to the thermodynamic limitation of alkane conversion. On the other hand, the reaction is strongly endothermic."
          [8] "To achieve technically relevant conversions of 3050%, reaction temperatures of 825975 K are required for propane and 775825 K are correspondingly required for isobutane. As the carbon number of the alkanes to be dehydrogenated increases, the reaction temperature falls."

[1] "Because of their extensive use as chemical building blocks, light olefins, such as propylene (propene) and ethylene (ethene), are among the most important types of compounds in the chemical industry. Light olefins are the feedstock employed in the production of a vast array of chemicals, including polymers (e.g., polyethylene and polypropylene), oxygenates (e.g., ethylene glycol, acetaldehyde, acetone, and propylene oxide), and important chemical intermediates (e.g., ethylbenzene and propionaldehyde)."
          [2] "The demand of these building blocks has increased steadily over the last years, all major markets registering a positive growth in demand and production in recent years with the exception of the Eurozone, due to the effects of the recent economic downturn."
          [3] "Steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) of naphtha, light diesel, and other oil byproducts are the most common methods for obtaining these light olefins."
          [4] "The reaction is thermodynamically limited and highly endothermic, which, according to Le Chateliers principle, implies that higher reaction temperature and/or lower paraffin partial pressure are needed to achieve high conversions."
          [5] "Indeed, temperatures of 550750 C are typically required in the dehydrogenation of C2C4 paraffins to obtain alkane conversions 50% at 1 bar (see Figure 8)."
          [6] "Moreover, given that the enthalpy required to dehydrogenate alkanes decreases as the chain becomes longer (ΔH2980 = 137 kJ mol1 for ethane, 124.3 kJ mol1 for propane, and 117.6 kJ mol1 for isobutane dehydrogenation), a considerably larger amount of energy is required to dehydrogenate light paraffins on a mass basis."

[1] "The world propylene production capacity, based on the use of catalytic dehydrogenation of propane has increased steadily over the past 10 years [13] and is ex- pected to grow even further under the right economic conditions relative to the availability of propane; on the other hand, environmental concerns on the use of MTBE are expected to adversely impact the future ex- pansion of isobutane dehydrogenation applications."
          [2] "Although production of ethylene via catalytic dehy- drogenation over Pt catalysts is very selective (about 95%), extension of this dehydrogenation technology to ethane has not taken place due to the need for even more severe operating conditions; higher temperatures and lower pressures. Such conditions cause excessive coking of the catalyst or require costlier operation under vacuum."
          [3] "The equilibrium conversion increases at higher Fig. 4 indicates that the temperature required for the dehydrogenation of light paraffins is much higher than for heavy paraf- fins. For 40% conversion, for example, the dehydro- genation of propane requires a temperature of at least about 580 C, while dodecane can be theoretically dehydrogenated to the same extent at only 450 C."
          [4] "The equilibrium constant for paraffin dehydrogena- tion increases significantly as the carbon number in- creases."
          [1] "Catalytic paraffin dehydrogenation for the production of olefins has been in commercial use since the late 1930s, while catalytic paraffin oxydehydrogenation for olefin production has not yet been commercialized."
          [2] "Commercial processes for the catalytic dehydrogenation of propane and butanes attain per-pass conversions in the range of 3060%, while the catalytic dehydrogenation of C10C14 paraffins typically operates at conversion levels of 1020%."
          [3] "In the year 2000, nearly 7 million metric tons of C3C4 olefins and 2 million metric tons of C10C14 range olefins were produced via catalytic dehydrogenation."
          [4] "Oxydehydrogenation employs catalysts containing vanadium and, more recently, platinum."
          [5] "Oxydehydrogenation at 1000 C and very short residence time over Pt and Pt-Sn catalysts can produce ethylene in higher yields than in steam cracking."
          [6] "However, there are a number of issues related to safety and process upsets that need to be addressed."
          [7] "Important objectives in oxydehydrogenation are attaining high selectivity to olefins with high conversion of paraffin and minimizing potentially dangerous mixtures of paraffin and oxidant."
          [8] "More recently, the use of carbon dioxide as an oxidant for ethane conversion to ethylene has been investigated as a potential way to reduce the negative impact of dangerous oxidantparaffin mixtures and to achieve higher selectivity."
          [9] "While catalytic dehydrogenation reflects a relatively mature and well-established technology, oxydehydrogenation can in many respects be characterized as still being in its infancy."
          [10] "Oxydehydrogenation, however, offers substantial thermodynamic advantages and is an area of active research in many fronts."
