The demand for olefins, especially ethylene and propylene, is expected to increase significantly in the near future. The main sources of olefins are steam cracking, fluid-catalytic-cracking, and catalytic dehydrogenation. The production of chemicals starting from alkanes by means of oxidative processes has been one of the most studied topics in recent decades. The direct conversion of ethane and propane to commodity chemical intermediates has the potential to radically transform the chemical industry. The effectiveness of the catalyst, that is the activity for alkane conversion and the selectivity to desired products, will ultimately determine the economic attractiveness of an alkane-based chemical process.

Light olefins, such as propylene and ethylene, are the top two largest volume petrochemical intermediates. Ethylene is primarily produced through the thermal cracking of ethane, LPG, and heavier feedstocks. Propylene is a byproduct of thermal cracking of LPG and heavier feedstocks. Over the past two decades, the growth rate of propylene demand has outpaced conventional supply routes, leading to the construction of commercial units for selective catalytic dehydrogenation of propane to propylene. Isobutane dehydrogenation units were also built in the 1990s to produce isobutylene, which is then converted to MTBE or dimerized and hydrogenated to produce isooctane, a high octane gasoline blending component. The production of light olefins is thermodynamically challenging due to the high temperatures required for dehydrogenation of light paraffins compared to heavy paraffins. For example, at 1 atm absolute pressure for 40% conversion, the dehydrogenation of propane requires a temperature of at least about 580 C, while dodecane can be theoretically dehydrogenated to the same extent at only 450 C.

Light olefins, such as propylene and ethylene, are crucial in the chemical industry for the production of a wide range of products including plastics, detergents, and synthetic fibers. The key production methods involve steam cracking and steam reforming. Steam cracking, when using ethane as the primary feed, can achieve high yields of ethylene and propylene, but it also produces a mixture of other olefin products, hydrocarbons, and hydrogen. Steam reforming, on the other hand, is an expensive process that requires high operating pressures and temperatures, and it faces challenges with heat transfer and coke management. The overall efficiencies of these processes are typically 75% or lower. Light olefins, such as propylene and ethylene, are produced from heavier alkanes in natural gas through process chemistry, including free-radical routes or catalytic partial oxidation. Ethylene and propylene can be obtained in high yields under appropriate reaction conditions when ethane is the primary feedstock.

The literature does not provide specific information on how light olefins contribute to the chemical industry in terms of their applications and market trends. However, it does mention that propene is used in the polymer industry for the synthesis of high-purity polypropylene, and isobutene is needed for the synthesis of MTBE and ETBE, additives to gasoline. The dehydrogenation of propane and isobutane has become more important in recent years. The CATOFIN process leads the world for producing propene and isobutene. The production of light olefins is an endothermic process that requires relatively high temperatures and low pressures to obtain significant yields. Longer alkane chains are dehydrogenated at lower temperatures, whereas lighter alkanes require higher dehydrogenation temperatures. The required high temperatures favor thermal cracking reactions to lighter alkanes and coke, which can lead to catalyst deactivation. Suitable catalysts not only have to possess good activity and selectivity, but also must suppress thermal cracking reactions.

Light olefins, such as ethylene and propylene, are key building blocks in the chemical industry. They are among the organic chemicals with the largest production volumes worldwide. Ethylene is the largest-volume petrochemical produced worldwide, mainly used by the plastics industry. In 2010, approximately 61% of the total consumption of ethylene was for the production of polyethylene in Western European countries. Ethylene is also used in the production of other plastics such as polystyrene (PS), polyethylene terephthalate (PET), and polyvinyl chloride (PVC), which are widely used in the packaging, textile, and construction industries. Propylene is a versatile petrochemical with even more derivatives than ethylene. The tremendous growth of polypropylene consumption over the past 15 years has been the main driver of the large increase in the demand for propylene. In 2010, more than 55% of propylene consumption was dedicated to the production of polypropylene in Western European countries. Approximately 13% of the propylene was used in the production of propylene oxide, which is a chemical precursor for the synthesis of propylene glycol and polyols. The rest of the production was used in the synthesis of cumene (about 8%), acrylonitrile, isopropyl alcohol, and many other industrially relevant chemicals.

Light olefins, such as propylene and ethylene, are crucial intermediate products in the chemical industry. In 2003, the global production of ethylene was 100 million tons, and propylene was approximately 56 million tons. Ethylene is mainly used for the production of polymers, especially polyethylene (HDPE, LDPE, LLDPE), or as a precursor for other polymer compounds such as 1,2-dichloroethane/vinyl chloride for PVC, ethylbenzene/styrene for polystyrene, or ethylene oxide for ethylene glycols or polyethoxylates. Propylene is also important for the production of polymers, mainly for the production of polypropylene. Steam cracking of hydrocarbons is the most important process for the production of light olefins, with world-scale steam crackers capable of producing more than 1 million tons of ethylene per year. Another source of light olefins, especially propylene, is catalytic cracking in the form of fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) in refineries. The share of catalytic dehydrogenation of propane in the overall production of propylene is expected to increase, as the production of propylene in existing naphtha crackers cannot be increased without limit due to thermodynamic limits, and predominantly ethane-based steam crackers produce only a small amount of propylene. The predicted growth rate for propylene is higher than that for ethylene. The technical realization of catalytic alkane dehydrogenation is problematic due to thermodynamic limitations and the endothermic nature of the reaction. To achieve technically relevant conversions of 30-50%, reaction temperatures of 825-975 K are required for propane and 775-825 K for isobutane. As the carbon number of the alkanes to be dehydrogenated increases, the reaction temperature falls.

Light olefins, such as propylene and ethylene, are crucial components in the chemical industry, serving as building blocks for a wide range of products including polymers, oxygenates, and chemical intermediates. The demand for these compounds has been on a steady rise in major markets, except for the Eurozone which was affected by economic downturn. Steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking are the primary methods for their production. The synthesis of light olefins is thermodynamically challenging, requiring high temperatures and low pressures to achieve high conversions due to the endothermic nature of the reactions. Specifically, temperatures between 550 and 750 degrees Celsius are needed for the dehydrogenation of C2 to C4 paraffins to reach 50% conversions at 1 bar. Moreover, the energy requirement for dehydrogenation decreases with increasing alkane chain length, meaning that more energy is needed to dehydrogenate light paraffins on a mass basis.

Light olefins, such as propylene and ethylene, are crucial to the chemical industry, serving as key building blocks for a wide range of products including plastics, detergents, and synthetic fibers. The production capacity for propylene, particularly through catalytic dehydrogenation of propane, has seen steady growth over the past decade and is projected to further expand under favorable economic conditions, especially with the availability of propane. However, environmental concerns regarding the use of methyl tertiary butyl ether (MTBE) are anticipated to negatively affect the future expansion of isobutane dehydrogenation applications. Ethylene production through catalytic dehydrogenation over platinum catalysts is highly selective, but extending this technology to ethane requires more severe operating conditions, such as higher temperatures and lower pressures, which can lead to excessive catalyst coking or necessitate more expensive vacuum operations. The thermodynamic challenge for light olefin synthesis is that higher temperatures are required for the dehydrogenation of light paraffins compared to heavy paraffins. For instance, achieving 40% conversion of propane demands a temperature of at least 580 degrees Celsius, whereas dodecane can be dehydrogenated to the same extent at a lower temperature of 450 degrees Celsius. The equilibrium constant for paraffin dehydrogenation increases significantly with the increase in carbon number. Light olefins, such as propylene and ethylene, are crucial to the chemical industry, serving as fundamental building blocks for a wide range of products, including plastics, detergents, and synthetic fibers. Propylene and ethylene production via catalytic dehydrogenation has been a commercial practice since the late 1930s, with significant volumes produced annually. In 2000, nearly 7 million metric tons of C3C4 olefins and 2 million metric tons of C10C14 olefins were produced through this method. The production of light olefins faces thermodynamic challenges, particularly related to temperature, pressure, and the length of the alkane chain. Higher temperatures are required for the dehydrogenation of light paraffins to achieve economically attractive conversions, which can lead to increased side reactions, coke formation, and catalyst deactivation. The equilibrium conversion for dehydrogenation increases with the carbon number in the paraffin, making the dehydrogenation of heavy paraffins more favorable at lower temperatures. Oxydehydrogenation, which is still in its infancy, offers thermodynamic advantages by removing the equilibrium conversion restriction of dehydrogenation, but it presents safety and process control challenges due to the potentially explosive mixtures of paraffins and oxygen. The use of carbon dioxide as an oxidant is being explored to improve selectivity and safety in ethane conversion to ethylene. Light olefins, such as propylene and ethylene, are crucial to the chemical industry, serving as key building blocks for a wide range of products, including plastics, detergents, and synthetic fibers. The market trends for these olefins are influenced by global demand for petrochemical products, with steady growth expected due to increasing industrialization and population growth. The primary production methods for light olefins include steam cracking and catalytic dehydrogenation. Steam cracking is the most widely used process, involving the thermal cracking of hydrocarbons at high temperatures to produce a mixture of olefins and other hydrocarbons. Catalytic dehydrogenation, on the other hand, is a more selective process that converts paraffins to olefins using catalysts. The thermodynamic challenges associated with the synthesis of light olefins are significant, particularly in relation to temperature, pressure, and the length of the alkane chain. Higher temperatures are required for the dehydrogenation of light paraffins to achieve economically attractive conversions, but this also accelerates catalyst deactivation and side reactions. Pressure plays a role in shifting the equilibrium towards higher conversions, with lower pressures favoring dehydrogenation. The length of the alkane chain affects the equilibrium conversion, with longer chains requiring lower temperatures for dehydrogenation. Oxydehydrogenation, which uses oxygen as a co-reactant, offers thermodynamic advantages by removing the hydrogen product, thus shifting the equilibrium towards higher conversions. However, this process is still in the developmental stage and faces challenges related to safety, process upsets, and the need for highly selective catalysts. Light olefins, such as propylene and ethylene, are crucial to the chemical industry, serving as key building blocks for a wide range of products including plastics, detergents, and synthetic fibers. The market for these olefins is substantial, with millions of metric tons produced annually through catalytic dehydrogenation processes. The production of C3C4 olefins and C10C14 range olefins via catalytic dehydrogenation in the year 2000 alone amounted to nearly 7 million and 2 million metric tons, respectively. The commercial processes for dehydrogenation of propane and butanes achieve per-pass conversions of 30-60%, while those for C10C14 paraffins operate at lower conversion levels of 10-20%. Oxydehydrogenation, a process that employs catalysts containing vanadium and, more recently, platinum, is an area of active research due to its potential thermodynamic advantages. However, it is not yet commercialized due to safety concerns and the challenge of achieving high selectivity and conversion without dangerous paraffin-oxidant mixtures. Recent investigations into using carbon dioxide as an oxidant for ethane conversion to ethylene aim to address these issues and improve selectivity.

The literature does not provide specific information on how light olefins contribute to the chemical industry in terms of their applications and market trends. However, it does mention that catalytic dehydrogenation is a critical and growing technology for the production of olefins, especially for propylene production. The process of dehydrogenation involves high reaction enthalpy and thermodynamic equilibrium limitations, requiring the process to operate at high temperatures (>600°C) and lower pressures (<30 psig) to achieve economic conversion levels. These conditions are necessary due to the high energy required for the removal of hydrogen from alkanes to form olefins. The design of dehydrogenation catalysts must consider both chemical and mass transport properties to achieve high activity and selectivity. The use of shaped particles, modifying pore architecture, and employing methodologies to achieve a higher surface concentration of active component in the catalyst support pellet are common approaches to eliminate intraparticle pore diffusional limitations. The chemical composition of dehydrogenation catalysts is also critical to avoid high carbon deposition and side reactions. The role of platinum modifiers is to weaken the platinum-olefin interaction selectively without affecting the platinum-paraffin interaction, which improves catalyst selectivity and stability. The literature also discusses the Lummus/UOP SMART process, which employs an innovative catalytic oxidation technology to selectively burn the hydrogen liberated by the dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene, providing direct and more efficient reheating of the reaction mixture and reducing steam consumption. This process also shifts the reaction equilibrium towards the production of styrene monomer, increasing single-pass ethylbenzene conversion while maintaining high selectivity.

The overall efficiency of these processes is typically 75% or lower. Light olefins, such as propylene and ethylene, are valuable chemical products that can be derived from heavier alkanes in natural gas through process chemistry, including free-radical routes or catalytic partial oxidation.

The literature does not provide specific information on how light olefins contribute to the chemical industry in terms of their applications and market trends. However, it does mention that propene is used in the polymer industry for the synthesis of high-purity polypropylene, and isobutene is needed for the synthesis of MTBE and ETBE, additives to gasoline. The dehydrogenation of propane and isobutane has become more important in recent years. The CATOFIN process leads the world for producing propene and isobutene. The production of light olefins is an endothermic process that requires relatively high temperatures and low pressures to obtain significant yields. Longer alkane chains are dehydrogenated at lower temperatures, whereas lighter alkanes require higher dehydrogenation temperatures. The required high temperatures favor thermal cracking reactions to lighter alkanes and coke, which can lead to catalyst deactivation. Suitable catalysts not only have to possess good activity and selectivity, but also must suppress thermal cracking reactions.

Light olefins, such as ethylene and propylene, are key building blocks in the chemical industry. They are among the organic chemicals with the largest production volumes worldwide. Ethylene is the largest-volume petrochemical produced worldwide, mainly used by the plastics industry. In 2010, approximately 61% of the total consumption of ethylene was for the production of polyethylene in Western European countries. Ethylene is also used in the production of other plastics such as polystyrene (PS), polyethylene terephthalate (PET), and polyvinyl chloride (PVC), which are widely used in the packaging, textile, and construction industries. Propylene is a versatile petrochemical with even more derivatives than ethylene. The tremendous growth of polypropylene consumption over the past 15 years has been the main driver of the large increase in the demand for propylene. In 2010, more than 55% of propylene consumption was dedicated to the production of polypropylene in Western European countries. Approximately 13% of the propylene was used in the production of propylene oxide, which is a chemical precursor for the synthesis of propylene glycol and polyols. The rest of the production was used in the synthesis of cumene (about 8%), acrylonitrile, isopropyl alcohol, and many other industrially relevant chemicals.

Light olefins, such as propylene and ethylene, are crucial intermediate products in the chemical industry. In 2003, the global production of ethylene was 100 million tons, and propylene was approximately 56 million tons. Ethylene is mainly used for the production of polymers, especially polyethylene (HDPE, LDPE, LLDPE), or as a precursor for other polymer compounds such as 1,2-dichloroethane/vinyl chloride for PVC, ethylbenzene/styrene for polystyrene, or ethylene oxide for ethylene glycols or polyethoxylates. Propylene is also important for the production of polymers, mainly for the production of polypropylene. Steam cracking of hydrocarbons is the most important process for the production of light olefins, with world-scale steam crackers capable of producing more than 1 million tons of ethylene per year. Another source of light olefins, especially propylene, is catalytic cracking in the form of fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) in refineries. The share of catalytic dehydrogenation of propane in the overall production of propylene is expected to increase, as the production of propylene in existing naphtha crackers cannot be increased without limit due to thermodynamic limits, and predominantly ethane-based steam crackers produce only a small amount of propylene. The predicted growth rate for propylene is higher than that for ethylene. The technical realization of catalytic alkane dehydrogenation is problematic due to thermodynamic limitations and the endothermic nature of the reaction. To achieve technically relevant conversions of 30-50%, reaction temperatures of 825-975 K are required for propane and 775-825 K for isobutane. As the carbon number of the alkanes to be dehydrogenated increases, the reaction temperature falls.

Light olefins, such as propylene and ethylene, are crucial components in the chemical industry, serving as building blocks for a wide range of products including polymers, oxygenates, and chemical intermediates. The demand for these compounds has been on a steady rise in major markets, except for the Eurozone which was affected by economic downturn. Steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking are the primary methods for their production. The synthesis of light olefins is thermodynamically challenging, requiring high temperatures and low pressures to achieve high conversions due to the endothermic nature of the reactions. Specifically, temperatures between 550 and 750 degrees Celsius are needed for the dehydrogenation of C2 to C4 paraffins to reach 50% conversions at 1 bar. Moreover, the energy requirement for dehydrogenation decreases with increasing alkane chain length, meaning that more energy is needed to dehydrogenate light paraffins on a mass basis.

Light olefins, such as propylene and ethylene, are crucial to the chemical industry, serving as key building blocks for a wide range of products including plastics, detergents, and synthetic fibers. The production capacity for propylene, particularly through catalytic dehydrogenation of propane, has seen steady growth over the past decade and is projected to further expand under favorable economic conditions, especially with the availability of propane. However, environmental concerns regarding the use of methyl tertiary butyl ether (MTBE) are anticipated to negatively affect the future expansion of isobutane dehydrogenation applications. Ethylene production through catalytic dehydrogenation over platinum catalysts is highly selective, but extending this technology to ethane requires more severe operating conditions, such as higher temperatures and lower pressures, which can lead to excessive catalyst coking or necessitate more expensive vacuum operations. The thermodynamic challenge for light olefin synthesis is that higher temperatures are required for the dehydrogenation of light paraffins compared to heavy paraffins. For instance, achieving 40% conversion of propane demands a temperature of at least 580 degrees Celsius, whereas dodecane can be dehydrogenated to the same extent at a lower temperature of 450 degrees Celsius. The equilibrium constant for paraffin dehydrogenation increases significantly with the increase in carbon number. Light olefins, such as propylene and ethylene, are crucial to the chemical industry, serving as fundamental building blocks for a wide range of products, including plastics, detergents, and synthetic fibers. Propylene and ethylene production via catalytic dehydrogenation has been a commercial practice since the late 1930s, with significant volumes produced annually. In 2000, nearly 7 million metric tons of C3C4 olefins and 2 million metric tons of C10C14 olefins were produced through this method. The production of light olefins faces thermodynamic challenges, particularly related to temperature, pressure, and the length of the alkane chain. Higher temperatures are required for the dehydrogenation of light paraffins to achieve economically attractive conversions, which can lead to increased side reactions, coke formation, and catalyst deactivation. The equilibrium conversion for dehydrogenation increases with the carbon number in the paraffin, making the dehydrogenation of heavy paraffins more favorable at lower temperatures. Oxydehydrogenation, which is still in its infancy, offers thermodynamic advantages by removing the equilibrium conversion restriction of dehydrogenation, but it presents safety and process control challenges due to the potentially explosive mixtures of paraffins and oxygen. The use of carbon dioxide as an oxidant is being explored to improve selectivity and safety in ethane conversion to ethylene. Light olefins, such as propylene and ethylene, are crucial to the chemical industry, serving as key building blocks for a wide range of products, including plastics, detergents, and synthetic fibers. The market trends for these olefins are influenced by global demand for petrochemical products, with steady growth expected due to increasing industrialization and population growth. The primary production methods for light olefins include steam cracking and catalytic dehydrogenation. Steam cracking is the most widely used process, involving the thermal cracking of hydrocarbons at high temperatures to produce a mixture of olefins and other hydrocarbons. Catalytic dehydrogenation, on the other hand, is a more selective process that converts paraffins to olefins using catalysts. The thermodynamic challenges associated with the synthesis of light olefins are significant, particularly in relation to temperature, pressure, and the length of the alkane chain. Higher temperatures are required for the dehydrogenation of light paraffins to achieve economically attractive conversions, but this also accelerates catalyst deactivation and side reactions. Pressure plays a role in shifting the equilibrium towards higher conversions, with lower pressures favoring dehydrogenation. The length of the alkane chain affects the equilibrium conversion, with longer chains requiring lower temperatures for dehydrogenation. Oxydehydrogenation, which uses oxygen as a co-reactant, offers thermodynamic advantages by removing the hydrogen product, thus shifting the equilibrium towards higher conversions. However, this process is still in the developmental stage and faces challenges related to safety, process upsets, and the need for highly selective catalysts. Light olefins, such as propylene and ethylene, are crucial to the chemical industry, serving as key building blocks for a wide range of products including plastics, detergents, and synthetic fibers. The market for these olefins is substantial, with millions of metric tons produced annually through catalytic dehydrogenation processes. The production of C3C4 olefins and C10C14 range olefins via catalytic dehydrogenation in the year 2000 alone amounted to nearly 7 million and 2 million metric tons, respectively. The commercial processes for dehydrogenation of propane and butanes achieve per-pass conversions of 30-60%, while those for C10C14 paraffins operate at lower conversion levels of 10-20%. Oxydehydrogenation, a process that employs catalysts containing vanadium and, more recently, platinum, is an area of active research due to its potential thermodynamic advantages. However, it is not yet commercialized due to safety concerns and the challenge of achieving high selectivity and conversion without dangerous paraffin-oxidant mixtures. Recent investigations into using carbon dioxide as an oxidant for ethane conversion to ethylene aim to address these issues and improve selectivity.

The literature does not provide specific information on how light olefins contribute to the chemical industry in terms of their applications and market trends. However, it does mention that catalytic dehydrogenation is a critical and growing technology for the production of olefins, especially for propylene production. The process of dehydrogenation involves high reaction enthalpy and thermodynamic equilibrium limitations, requiring the process to operate at high temperatures (>600°C) and lower pressures (<30 psig) to achieve economic conversion levels. These conditions are necessary due to the high energy required for the removal of hydrogen from alkanes to form olefins. The design of dehydrogenation catalysts must consider both chemical and mass transport properties to achieve high activity and selectivity. The use of shaped particles, modifying pore architecture, and employing methodologies to achieve a higher surface concentration of active component in the catalyst support pellet are common approaches to eliminate intraparticle pore diffusional limitations. The chemical composition of dehydrogenation catalysts is also critical to avoid high carbon deposition and side reactions. The role of platinum modifiers is to weaken the platinum-olefin interaction selectively without affecting the platinum-paraffin interaction, which improves catalyst selectivity and stability. The literature also discusses the Lummus/UOP SMART process, which employs an innovative catalytic oxidation technology to selectively burn the hydrogen liberated by the dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene, providing direct and more efficient reheating of the reaction mixture and reducing steam consumption. This process also shifts the reaction equilibrium towards the production of styrene monomer, increasing single-pass ethylbenzene conversion while maintaining high selectivity.

The demand for olefins, especially ethylene and propylene, is expected to increase significantly in the near future. The main sources of olefins are steam cracking, fluid-catalytic-cracking, and catalytic dehydrogenation. The production of chemicals starting from alkanes by means of oxidative processes has been one of the most studied topics in recent decades. The direct conversion of ethane and propane to commodity chemical intermediates has the potential to radically transform the chemical industry. The effectiveness of the catalyst, that is the activity for alkane conversion and the selectivity to desired products, will ultimately determine the economic attractiveness of an alkane-based chemical process.

Light olefins, such as propylene and ethylene, are the top two largest volume petrochemical intermediates. Ethylene is primarily produced through the thermal cracking of ethane, LPG, and heavier feedstocks. Propylene is a byproduct of thermal cracking of LPG and heavier feedstocks. Over the past two decades, the growth rate of propylene demand has outpaced conventional supply routes, leading to the construction of commercial units for selective catalytic dehydrogenation of propane to propylene. Isobutane dehydrogenation units were also built in the 1990s to produce isobutylene, which is then converted to MTBE or dimerized and hydrogenated to produce isooctane, a high octane gasoline blending component. The production of light olefins is thermodynamically challenging due to the high temperatures required for dehydrogenation of light paraffins compared to heavy paraffins. For example, at 1 atm absolute pressure for 40% conversion, the dehydrogenation of propane requires a temperature of at least about 580 C, while dodecane can be theoretically dehydrogenated to the same extent at only 450 C.

Light olefins, such as propylene and ethylene, are crucial in the chemical industry for the production of a wide range of products including plastics, detergents, and synthetic fibers. The key production methods involve steam cracking and steam reforming. Steam cracking, when using ethane as the primary feed, can achieve high yields of ethylene and propylene, but it also produces a mixture of other olefin products, hydrocarbons, and hydrogen. Steam reforming, on the other hand, is an expensive process that requires high operating pressures and temperatures, and it faces challenges with heat transfer and coke management. The overall efficiencies of these processes are typically 75% or lower.

Another source of light olefins, especially propylene, is catalytic cracking in the form of fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) in refineries. The share of catalytic dehydrogenation of propane in the overall production of propylene is expected to increase, as the production of propylene in existing naphtha crackers cannot be increased without limit due to thermodynamic limits, and predominantly ethane-based steam crackers produce only a small amount of propylene. The predicted growth rate for propylene is higher than that for ethylene. The technical realization of catalytic alkane dehydrogenation is problematic due to thermodynamic limitations and the endothermic nature of the reaction. To achieve technically relevant conversions of 30-50%, reaction temperatures of 825-975 K are required for propane and 775-825 K for isobutane. As the carbon number of the alkanes to be dehydrogenated increases, the reaction temperature falls.

Light olefins, such as propylene and ethylene, are crucial components in the chemical industry, serving as building blocks for a wide range of products including polymers, oxygenates, and chemical intermediates. The demand for these compounds has been on a steady rise in major markets, except for the Eurozone which was affected by economic downturn. Steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking are the primary methods for their production. The synthesis of light olefins is thermodynamically challenging, requiring high temperatures and low pressures to achieve high conversions due to the endothermic nature of the reactions. Specifically, temperatures between 550 and 750 degrees Celsius are needed for the dehydrogenation of C2 to C4 paraffins to reach 50% conversions at 1 bar. Moreover, the energy requirement for dehydrogenation decreases with increasing alkane chain length, meaning that more energy is needed to dehydrogenate light paraffins on a mass basis.

Light olefins, such as propylene and ethylene, are crucial to the chemical industry, serving as key building blocks for a wide range of products including plastics, detergents, and synthetic fibers. The production capacity for propylene, particularly through catalytic dehydrogenation of propane, has seen steady growth over the past decade and is projected to further expand under favorable economic conditions, especially with the availability of propane. However, environmental concerns regarding the use of methyl tertiary butyl ether (MTBE) are anticipated to negatively affect the future expansion of isobutane dehydrogenation applications. Ethylene production through catalytic dehydrogenation over platinum catalysts is highly selective, but extending this technology to ethane requires more severe operating conditions, such as higher temperatures and lower pressures, which can lead to excessive catalyst coking or necessitate more expensive vacuum operations. The thermodynamic challenge for light olefin synthesis is that higher temperatures are required for the dehydrogenation of light paraffins compared to heavy paraffins. For instance, achieving 40% conversion of propane demands a temperature of at least 580 degrees Celsius, whereas dodecane can be dehydrogenated to the same extent at a lower temperature of 450 degrees Celsius. The equilibrium constant for paraffin dehydrogenation increases significantly with the increase in carbon number. Light olefins, such as propylene and ethylene, are crucial to the chemical industry, serving as fundamental building blocks for a wide range of products, including plastics, detergents, and synthetic fibers. Propylene and ethylene production via catalytic dehydrogenation has been a commercial practice since the late 1930s, with significant volumes produced annually. In 2000, nearly 7 million metric tons of C3C4 olefins and 2 million metric tons of C10C14 olefins were produced through this method. The production of light olefins faces thermodynamic challenges, particularly related to temperature, pressure, and the length of the alkane chain. Higher temperatures are required for the dehydrogenation of light paraffins to achieve economically attractive conversions, which can lead to increased side reactions, coke formation, and catalyst deactivation. The equilibrium conversion for dehydrogenation increases with the carbon number in the paraffin, making the dehydrogenation of heavy paraffins more favorable at lower temperatures. Oxydehydrogenation, which is still in its infancy, offers thermodynamic advantages by removing the equilibrium conversion restriction of dehydrogenation, but it presents safety and process control challenges due to the potentially explosive mixtures of paraffins and oxygen. The use of carbon dioxide as an oxidant is being explored to improve selectivity and safety in ethane conversion to ethylene. Light olefins, such as propylene and ethylene, are crucial to the chemical industry, serving as key building blocks for a wide range of products, including plastics, detergents, and synthetic fibers. The market trends for these olefins are influenced by global demand for petrochemical products, with steady growth expected due to increasing industrialization and population growth. The primary production methods for light olefins include steam cracking and catalytic dehydrogenation. Steam cracking is the most widely used process, involving the thermal cracking of hydrocarbons at high temperatures to produce a mixture of olefins and other hydrocarbons. Catalytic dehydrogenation, on the other hand, is a more selective process that converts paraffins to olefins using catalysts. The thermodynamic challenges associated with the synthesis of light olefins are significant, particularly in relation to temperature, pressure, and the length of the alkane chain. Higher temperatures are required for the dehydrogenation of light paraffins to achieve economically attractive conversions, but this also accelerates catalyst deactivation and side reactions. Pressure plays a role in shifting the equilibrium towards higher conversions, with lower pressures favoring dehydrogenation. The length of the alkane chain affects the equilibrium conversion, with longer chains requiring lower temperatures for dehydrogenation. Oxydehydrogenation, which uses oxygen as a co-reactant, offers thermodynamic advantages by removing the hydrogen product, thus shifting the equilibrium towards higher conversions. However, this process is still in the developmental stage and faces challenges related to safety, process upsets, and the need for highly selective catalysts. Light olefins, such as propylene and ethylene, are crucial to the chemical industry, serving as key building blocks for a wide range of products including plastics, detergents, and synthetic fibers. The market for these olefins is substantial, with millions of metric tons produced annually through catalytic dehydrogenation processes. The production of C3C4 olefins and C10C14 range olefins via catalytic dehydrogenation in the year 2000 alone amounted to nearly 7 million and 2 million metric tons, respectively. The commercial processes for dehydrogenation of propane and butanes achieve per-pass conversions of 30-60%, while those for C10C14 paraffins operate at lower conversion levels of 10-20%. Oxydehydrogenation, a process that employs catalysts containing vanadium and, more recently, platinum, is an area of active research due to its potential thermodynamic advantages. However, it is not yet commercialized due to safety concerns and the challenge of achieving high selectivity and conversion without dangerous paraffin-oxidant mixtures. Recent investigations into using carbon dioxide as an oxidant for ethane conversion to ethylene aim to address these issues and improve selectivity.

The literature does not provide specific information on how light olefins contribute to the chemical industry in terms of their applications and market trends. However, it does mention that catalytic dehydrogenation is a critical and growing technology for the production of olefins, especially for propylene production. The process of dehydrogenation involves high reaction enthalpy and thermodynamic equilibrium limitations, requiring the process to operate at high temperatures (>600°C) and lower pressures (<30 psig) to achieve economic conversion levels. These conditions are necessary due to the high energy required for the removal of hydrogen from alkanes to form olefins. The design of dehydrogenation catalysts must consider both chemical and mass transport properties to achieve high activity and selectivity. The use of shaped particles, modifying pore architecture, and employing methodologies to achieve a higher surface concentration of active component in the catalyst support pellet are common approaches to eliminate intraparticle pore diffusional limitations. The chemical composition of dehydrogenation catalysts is also critical to avoid high carbon deposition and side reactions. The role of platinum modifiers is to weaken the platinum-olefin interaction selectively without affecting the platinum-paraffin interaction, which improves catalyst selectivity and stability. The literature also discusses the Lummus/UOP SMART process, which employs an innovative catalytic oxidation technology to selectively burn the hydrogen liberated by the dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene, providing direct and more efficient reheating of the reaction mixture and reducing steam consumption. This process also shifts the reaction equilibrium towards the production of styrene monomer, increasing single-pass ethylbenzene conversion while maintaining high selectivity.

The demand for olefins, especially ethylene and propylene, is expected to increase significantly in the near future. The main sources of olefins are steam cracking, fluid-catalytic-cracking, and catalytic dehydrogenation. The production of chemicals starting from alkanes by means of oxidative processes has been one of the most studied topics in recent decades. The direct conversion of ethane and propane to commodity chemical intermediates has the potential to radically transform the chemical industry. The effectiveness of the catalyst, that is the activity for alkane conversion and the selectivity to desired products, will ultimately determine the economic attractiveness of an alkane-based chemical process.

Light olefins, such as propylene and ethylene, are the top two largest volume petrochemical intermediates. Ethylene is primarily produced through the thermal cracking of ethane, LPG, and heavier feedstocks. Propylene is a byproduct of thermal cracking of LPG and heavier feedstocks. Over the past two decades, the growth rate of propylene demand has outpaced conventional supply routes, leading to the construction of commercial units for selective catalytic dehydrogenation of propane to propylene. Isobutane dehydrogenation units were also built in the 1990s to produce isobutylene, which is then converted to MTBE or dimerized and hydrogenated to produce isooctane, a high octane gasoline blending component. The production of light olefins is thermodynamically challenging due to the high temperatures required for dehydrogenation of light paraffins compared to heavy paraffins. For example, at 1 atm absolute pressure for 40% conversion, the dehydrogenation of propane requires a temperature of at least about 580 C, while dodecane can be theoretically dehydrogenated to the same extent at only 450 C.

Light olefins, such as propylene and ethylene, are crucial in the chemical industry for the production of a wide range of products including plastics, detergents, and synthetic fibers. The key production methods involve steam cracking and steam reforming. Steam cracking, when using ethane as the primary feed, can achieve high yields of ethylene and propylene, but it also produces a mixture of other olefin products, hydrocarbons, and hydrogen. Steam reforming, on the other hand, is an expensive process that requires high operating pressures and temperatures, and it faces challenges with heat transfer and coke management. The overall efficiencies of these processes are typically 75% or lower. Light olefins, such as propylene and ethylene, are produced from heavier alkanes in natural gas through process chemistry, including free-radical routes or catalytic partial oxidation. Ethylene and propylene can be obtained in high yields under appropriate reaction conditions when ethane is the primary feedstock.

The literature does not provide specific information on how light olefins contribute to the chemical industry in terms of their applications and market trends. However, it does mention that propene is used in the polymer industry for the synthesis of high-purity polypropylene, and isobutene is needed for the synthesis of MTBE and ETBE, additives to gasoline. The dehydrogenation of propane and isobutane has become more important in recent years. The CATOFIN process leads the world for producing propene and isobutene. The production of light olefins is an endothermic process that requires relatively high temperatures and low pressures to obtain significant yields. Longer alkane chains are dehydrogenated at lower temperatures, whereas lighter alkanes require higher dehydrogenation temperatures. The required high temperatures favor thermal cracking reactions to lighter alkanes and coke, which can lead to catalyst deactivation. Suitable catalysts not only have to possess good activity and selectivity, but also must suppress thermal cracking reactions.

Light olefins, such as ethylene and propylene, are key building blocks in the chemical industry. They are among the organic chemicals with the largest production volumes worldwide. Ethylene is the largest-volume petrochemical produced worldwide, mainly used by the plastics industry. In 2010, approximately 61% of the total consumption of ethylene was for the production of polyethylene in Western European countries. Ethylene is also used in the production of other plastics such as polystyrene (PS), polyethylene terephthalate (PET), and polyvinyl chloride (PVC), which are widely used in the packaging, textile, and construction industries. Propylene is a versatile petrochemical with even more derivatives than ethylene. The tremendous growth of polypropylene consumption over the past 15 years has been the main driver of the large increase in the demand for propylene. In 2010, more than 55% of propylene consumption was dedicated to the production of polypropylene in Western European countries. Approximately 13% of the propylene was used in the production of propylene oxide, which is a chemical precursor for the synthesis of propylene glycol and polyols. The rest of the production was used in the synthesis of cumene (about 8%), acrylonitrile, isopropyl alcohol, and many other industrially relevant chemicals.

Light olefins, such as propylene and ethylene, are crucial intermediate products in the chemical industry. In 2003, the global production of ethylene was 100 million tons, and propylene was approximately 56 million tons. Ethylene is mainly used for the production of polymers, especially polyethylene (HDPE, LDPE, LLDPE), or as a precursor for other polymer compounds such as 1,2-dichloroethane/vinyl chloride for PVC, ethylbenzene/styrene for polystyrene, or ethylene oxide for ethylene glycols or polyethoxylates.

The equilibrium conversion for dehydrogenation increases with the carbon number in the paraffin, making the dehydrogenation of heavy paraffins more favorable at lower temperatures. Oxydehydrogenation, which is still in its infancy, offers thermodynamic advantages by removing the equilibrium conversion restriction of dehydrogenation, but it presents safety and process control challenges due to the potentially explosive mixtures of paraffins and oxygen. The use of carbon dioxide as an oxidant is being explored to improve selectivity and safety in ethane conversion to ethylene. Light olefins, such as propylene and ethylene, are crucial to the chemical industry, serving as key building blocks for a wide range of products, including plastics, detergents, and synthetic fibers. The market trends for these olefins are influenced by global demand for petrochemical products, with steady growth expected due to increasing industrialization and population growth. The primary production methods for light olefins include steam cracking and catalytic dehydrogenation. Steam cracking is the most widely used process, involving the thermal cracking of hydrocarbons at high temperatures to produce a mixture of olefins and other hydrocarbons. Catalytic dehydrogenation, on the other hand, is a more selective process that converts paraffins to olefins using catalysts. The thermodynamic challenges associated with the synthesis of light olefins are significant, particularly in relation to temperature, pressure, and the length of the alkane chain. Higher temperatures are required for the dehydrogenation of light paraffins to achieve economically attractive conversions, but this also accelerates catalyst deactivation and side reactions. Pressure plays a role in shifting the equilibrium towards higher conversions, with lower pressures favoring dehydrogenation. The length of the alkane chain affects the equilibrium conversion, with longer chains requiring lower temperatures for dehydrogenation. Oxydehydrogenation, which uses oxygen as a co-reactant, offers thermodynamic advantages by removing the hydrogen product, thus shifting the equilibrium towards higher conversions. However, this process is still in the developmental stage and faces challenges related to safety, process upsets, and the need for highly selective catalysts. Light olefins, such as propylene and ethylene, are crucial to the chemical industry, serving as key building blocks for a wide range of products including plastics, detergents, and synthetic fibers. The market for these olefins is substantial, with millions of metric tons produced annually through catalytic dehydrogenation processes. The production of C3C4 olefins and C10C14 range olefins via catalytic dehydrogenation in the year 2000 alone amounted to nearly 7 million and 2 million metric tons, respectively. The commercial processes for dehydrogenation of propane and butanes achieve per-pass conversions of 30-60%, while those for C10C14 paraffins operate at lower conversion levels of 10-20%. Oxydehydrogenation, a process that employs catalysts containing vanadium and, more recently, platinum, is an area of active research due to its potential thermodynamic advantages. However, it is not yet commercialized due to safety concerns and the challenge of achieving high selectivity and conversion without dangerous paraffin-oxidant mixtures. Recent investigations into using carbon dioxide as an oxidant for ethane conversion to ethylene aim to address these issues and improve selectivity.

The literature does not provide specific information on how light olefins contribute to the chemical industry in terms of their applications and market trends. However, it does mention that catalytic dehydrogenation is a critical and growing technology for the production of olefins, especially for propylene production. The process of dehydrogenation involves high reaction enthalpy and thermodynamic equilibrium limitations, requiring the process to operate at high temperatures (>600°C) and lower pressures (<30 psig) to achieve economic conversion levels. These conditions are necessary due to the high energy required for the removal of hydrogen from alkanes to form olefins. The design of dehydrogenation catalysts must consider both chemical and mass transport properties to achieve high activity and selectivity. The use of shaped particles, modifying pore architecture, and employing methodologies to achieve a higher surface concentration of active component in the catalyst support pellet are common approaches to eliminate intraparticle pore diffusional limitations. The chemical composition of dehydrogenation catalysts is also critical to avoid high carbon deposition and side reactions. The role of platinum modifiers is to weaken the platinum-olefin interaction selectively without affecting the platinum-paraffin interaction, which improves catalyst selectivity and stability. The literature also discusses the Lummus/UOP SMART process, which employs an innovative catalytic oxidation technology to selectively burn the hydrogen liberated by the dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene, providing direct and more efficient reheating of the reaction mixture and reducing steam consumption. This process also shifts the reaction equilibrium towards the production of styrene monomer, increasing single-pass ethylbenzene conversion while maintaining high selectivity.
