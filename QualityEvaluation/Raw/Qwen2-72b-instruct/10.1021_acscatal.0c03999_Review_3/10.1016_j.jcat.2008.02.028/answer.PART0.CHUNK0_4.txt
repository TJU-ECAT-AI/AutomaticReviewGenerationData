1.The literature does not provide information on the primary causes of metal oxide catalyst deactivation in oxidative dehydrogenation processes, nor does it compare various regeneration methods in terms of their effectiveness, temperature requirements, and impact on catalytic performance. The literature focuses on the preparation and characterization of VOx/SiO2 catalysts for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane, and does not discuss the potential of CO2 addition for mitigating overoxidation in VOx-catalyzed reactions.
