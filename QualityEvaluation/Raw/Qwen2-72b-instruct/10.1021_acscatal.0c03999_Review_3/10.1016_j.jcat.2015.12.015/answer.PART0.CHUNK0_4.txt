1.The primary causes of metal oxide catalyst deactivation, focusing on Cr-based and VOx catalysts, in oxidative dehydrogenation processes are not explicitly mentioned in the literature. However, it is noted that the presence of WOx hinders the clustering of VOx species during the reaction, preventing the formation of non-selective oxygen, which reduces the probability of CO2 formation and thus total oxidation of propane. Reoxidation with CO2 is less effective than with O2 in fully reoxidizing the catalyst to its V2O5 state, as it can only oxidize to V2O4. The addition of CO2 can mitigate overoxidation in VOx-catalyzed reactions by suppressing the formation of surface carbon and enhancing the selectivity towards propylene production.

1.在氧化脱氢过程中，Cr基和VOx催化剂失活的主要原因在文献中没有明确提及。然而，文献指出WOx的存在在反应过程中阻碍了VOx物种的聚集，防止了非选择性氧的形成，减少了CO2形成的可能性，从而减少了丙烷的完全氧化。与O2相比，CO2的再氧化在将催化剂完全再氧化为V2O5状态方面效果较差，因为它只能氧化到V2O4。CO2的添加可以通过抑制表面碳的形成和提高丙烯的产率来缓解VOx催化反应中的过度氧化。
