What are the primary causes of metal oxide catalyst deactivation (focusing on Cr-based and VOx catalysts) in oxidative dehydrogenation processes, and how do various regeneration methods (such as reoxidation with air, CO2, or O2) compare in terms of their effectiveness, temperature requirements, and impact on catalytic performance, including the potential of CO2 addition for mitigating overoxidation in VOx-catalyzed reactions?

1.The primary causes of metal oxide catalyst deactivation, focusing on Cr-based and VOx catalysts, in oxidative dehydrogenation processes are not explicitly mentioned in the literature. However, it is noted that CO2-assisted propane dehydrogenation results in a higher selectivity toward propylene production and a reduction of carbon formation. The effectiveness of various regeneration methods, such as reoxidation with air, CO2, or O2, is not directly compared in terms of temperature requirements and impact on catalytic performance. The potential of CO2 addition for mitigating overoxidation in VOx-catalyzed reactions is suggested by the literature, as CO2 can re-oxidize partially reduced metal oxides and follows a proposed pathway in agreement with the Mars-Van Krevelen mechanism.

1.关于Cr基和VOx催化剂在氧化脱氢过程中的主要失活原因，文献中没有明确提及。然而，文献指出，CO2辅助丙烷脱氢导致丙烯产率提高和碳形成减少。各种再生方法（如用空气、CO2或O2再氧化）在温度要求和对催化性能影响方面的有效性没有直接比较。CO2添加在VOx催化反应中缓解过度氧化的潜力在文献中被暗示，因为CO2可以再氧化部分还原的金属氧化物，并遵循与Mars-Van Krevelen机制一致的建议途径。

1.The primary causes of metal oxide catalyst deactivation in oxidative dehydrogenation processes, focusing on Cr-based and VOx catalysts, are not explicitly mentioned in the literature. However, it is noted that the presence of WOx hinders the clustering of VOx species during the reaction, preventing the formation of non-selective oxygen, which reduces the probability of CO2 formation and thus total oxidation of propane. Reoxidation methods, such as using CO2, are effective in regenerating the catalyst but cannot completely reoxidize it to its V2O5 state, only to V2O4. CO2-assisted propane dehydrogenation results in higher selectivity toward propylene production and a reduction in carbon formation. The use of CO2 addition can mitigate overoxidation in VOx-catalyzed reactions by suppressing the formation of surface carbon and allowing the reaction to proceed via direct oxidative dehydrogenation and non-oxidative dehydrogenation followed by the reverse water gas shift reaction.

1.在氧化脱氢过程中，金属氧化物催化剂失活的主要原因，特别是Cr基和VOx催化剂，没有在文献中明确提及。然而，文献指出WOx的存在可以阻止VOx物种在反应过程中的聚集，防止非选择性氧的形成，从而降低CO2生成的概率，减少丙烷的完全氧化。再生方法，如使用CO2，可以有效地再生催化剂，但不能完全将其重新氧化到V2O5状态，只能氧化到V2O4。CO2辅助的丙烷脱氢导致了对丙烯生产的更高选择性，并减少了碳的形成。CO2的添加可以通过抑制表面碳的形成和允许反应同时通过直接氧化脱氢和非氧化脱氢后接逆向水煤气转换反应来缓解VOx催化反应中的过度氧化。
