1.The primary causes of metal oxide catalyst deactivation, focusing on Cr-based and VOx catalysts, in oxidative dehydrogenation processes are not explicitly mentioned in the literature. However, it is noted that CO2-assisted propane dehydrogenation results in a higher selectivity toward propylene production and a reduction of carbon formation. The effectiveness of various regeneration methods, such as reoxidation with air, CO2, or O2, is not directly compared in terms of temperature requirements and impact on catalytic performance. The potential of CO2 addition for mitigating overoxidation in VOx-catalyzed reactions is suggested by the literature, as CO2 can re-oxidize partially reduced metal oxides and suppress the formation of surface carbon.

1.关于Cr基和VOx催化剂在氧化脱氢过程中的主要失活原因，文献中没有明确提及。但是，文献指出，CO2辅助丙烷脱氢导致丙烯产率提高和碳形成减少。各种再生方法（如用空气、CO2或O2再氧化）在温度要求和对催化性能影响方面的有效性没有直接比较。文献表明，CO2添加有可能缓解VOx催化反应中的过度氧化，因为CO2可以再氧化部分还原的金属氧化物，并抑制表面碳的形成。
