Read the questions and answers provided below. First, critically assess the overall relevance of the answers provided to the set of questions asked.

If, upon your assessment, you find that the answers do not contain information that is relevant to the questions asked, stop your review process immediately and respond with a single sentence: "※※※※※※※The provided answers are not relevant to the questions.※※※※※※※". Do not provide any additional explanation or background information, only this sentence should be given as a response in case of irrelevant answers.

If, however, the answers are relevant to the questions asked, proceed to compile answers for each question according to the instructions below. Ensure to aggregate all the relevant answers from the multiple answer results provided in the document, and organize them sequentially by their order number, compiling the corresponding quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question.

If the provided answers' quotes are not differentiated by question, ensure to break them down and assign the quotes to each respective question, outputting them separately within each question's section.

To provide a comprehensive review, differentiate the responses into quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question based on the details given in the 'Answer' XML tags. Structure your review using the XML format showcased below if the answers are relevant to the questions asked:

What are the primary causes of metal oxide catalyst deactivation (focusing on Cr-based and VOx catalysts) in oxidative dehydrogenation processes, and how do various regeneration methods (such as reoxidation with air, CO2, or O2) compare in terms of their effectiveness, temperature requirements, and impact on catalytic performance, including the potential of CO2 addition for mitigating overoxidation in VOx-catalyzed reactions?

1.The literature does not provide information on the primary causes of metal oxide catalyst deactivation in oxidative dehydrogenation processes, nor does it compare various regeneration methods in terms of their effectiveness, temperature requirements, and impact on catalytic performance. The document focuses on the selective oxidation of propane on V2O5 and V2O5/TiO2 catalysts using periodic density functional theory (DFT) and does not discuss Cr-based catalysts or the effects of CO2 addition on overoxidation in VOx-catalyzed reactions.

1.文献没有提供金属氧化物催化剂在氧化脱氢过程中失活的主要原因，也没有比较各种再生方法在效率、温度要求和对催化性能影响方面的优劣。该文件使用周期性密度泛函理论（DFT）重点研究了V2O5和V2O5/TiO2催化剂上丙烷的选择性氧化，没有讨论Cr基催化剂，也没有讨论CO2添加对VOx催化反应中过度氧化的影响。

1.The literature does not provide information on the primary causes of metal oxide catalyst deactivation in oxidative dehydrogenation processes, nor does it compare various regeneration methods in terms of their effectiveness, temperature requirements, and impact on catalytic performance. The document focuses on the selective oxidation of propane on the vanadyl and bridging oxygen sites of the fully oxidized (001) V2O5 surface and of an epitaxial vanadia monolayer supported on (001) TiO2 anatase using periodic density functional theory (DFT).
