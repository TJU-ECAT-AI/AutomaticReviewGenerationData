1.No relevant information is provided in the literature to answer the question about the primary causes of metal oxide catalyst deactivation, focusing on Cr-based and VOx catalysts, in oxidative dehydrogenation processes. Nor does the literature compare various regeneration methods such as reoxidation with air, CO2, or O2 in terms of their effectiveness, temperature requirements, and impact on catalytic performance. The potential of CO2 addition for mitigating overoxidation in VOx-catalyzed reactions is also not discussed.
