electrodes functionalized with [cis- bis(isothiocyanato)bis(2,2-bipyridyl-4,4-dicarboxylato)ruthenium(II) or N3 dye molecules through a combination of spontaneous diazonium grafting, Suzuki cross-coupling and EDC/NHS chemistry (Figure 14c).164 Spectroscopic analysis of the diamond electrodes revealed that approximately 3 x 1014 Ru atoms were present per square centimeter, which is a quite dense film. UPS analysis also indicated that there is a more favorable energy level alignment of the N3 dye with diamond. The HOMO of the dye is situated 0.5 eV below the valence band of diamond, which provides sufficient driving force for hole injection without a too large voltage drop. Proof-of-concept photoelectrochemical measurements of these N3-functionalized surfaces were performed by employing diamond as a working electrode in a three-electrode electrochemical setup. The electrodes where submerged in a 0.1 M Na2SO4 electrolyte solution that contains 5 mM methyl viologen (MV2+), which serves as a redox couple. Under illumination of the electrodes with a 150 W halogen lamp at an intensity of 1.5 sun (150 mW cm-2, AM 1.5G), photocurrents of ca. 25 nA cm-2 were obtained. During these chronoamperometric measurements, a negative bias of -0.1 V was applied to the system as this was previously demonstrated to positively influence the current generation due to the establishment of a net vectorial electron flow from the photocathode to the counter electrode.230, 231 In addition to the commonly employed Ru-based dyes, other metal complexes have been investigated as well for the sensitization of diamond. For instance, manganese phthalocyanines (Mn- Pc) were grafted onto the surface of OH/NH2-terminated boron-doped nanocrystalline diamond (Figure 14 d). This was done through a nucleophilic substitution reaction between the alcohol or amine group at the diamond surface and the metal center of Cl-Mn-Pc.232 Such a functionalization approach will result in a flat geometry of the phthalocyanines on the surface, which impedes high dye coverage. Photoelectrochemical measurements were performed in a phosphate buffed saline (PBS) solution under illumination with a light-emitting diode (LED) operating at 770 nm. In case of the samples where an OH-terminated surface was employed to graft the Mn-Pc dyes, either no or extremely weak photocurrents were observed. In contrast, the NH2-terminated surfaces afforded photocurrents up to 40 nA cm-2. Follow-up work demonstrated that a difference in band bending at the two surfaces is at the origin of the respective photovoltaic behavior. The moderate band bending at NH2-terminated surfaces allows a nearly barrier-free transition from the hole in the HOMO of the dye into diamond. Stronger band bending at OH-terminated surfaces on the other hand results in an energy barrier that is too high to overcome, preventing photocurrent generation.233 Page 22 of 53 Journal of Materials Chemistry C Journal of Materials Chemistry C Accepted Manuscript Published on 08 August 2019.

3.1.2.2. Donor-acceptor chromophores
A second class of dye molecules that has received considerable attention for application in DSSCs and (bulk heterojunction) organic photovoltaics are the push-pull or donor-acceptor chromophores.
They typically consist of an electron-rich (donor) and an electron-deficient (acceptor) building block.
The large variety of both donor and acceptor units enables easy tuning of the optical and electrochemical properties through molecular design. Other advantages of this family of dyes in comparison with Ru-based metal complexes are the high molar extinction coefficients, lower production costs and a smaller environmental impact.234 The first report on the functionalization of BDD with donor-acceptor chromophores for photovoltaic applications was published in 2008 by K.P.
Loh and coworkers.138 Initial surface functionalization was performed via the electrochemical diazonium grafting of in situ diazotized 4-aminophenylboronic acid pinacol ester. Next, the donor- acceptor chromophore 2T-C60 was assembled on the surface in two steps (Figure 15a). First, the phenylboronic acid group was used to attach the bithiophene donor unit through Suzuki cross- coupling with 5'-iodo-[2,2'-bithiophene]-5-carbaldehyde (I-2T-CHO). Secondly, the acceptor unit was coupled to the carbaldehyde moiety by refluxing the diamond substrate, fullerene-C60 and N- methyglycine in toluene. It should be mentioned here that for donor-acceptor chromophores the organization of the dye on the surface plays an important role. After excitation of the chromophore,the generated charges will have the tendency to separate, where the electron and hole will move toward the electron-deficient (acceptor) and electron-rich (donor) building block, respectively.Hence, to minimize charge recombination, the donor unit should be as close as possible to the diamond electrode to ensure fast hole injection, while the acceptor unit should be in close proximity to the redox electrolyte. As a result, all donor-acceptor chromophores developed for sensitization of p-type photocathodes have a similar electrode-donor-acceptor structure. Photoelectrochemical measurements of the 2T-C60-functionalized diamond electrodes were performed in a 0.1 M Na2SO4/5 mM MV2+ electrolyte solution at an applied bias of -0.1 V. These proof-of-concept measurements resulted in stable light photocurrents of ca. 130 nA cm-2. The stability of this system was attributed to the strong carbon-carbon bonds at the diamond-chromophore interface and the robustness of the Page 23 of 53 Journal of Materials Chemistry C Journal of Materials Chemistry C Accepted Manuscript Published on 08 August 2019.

24 Suzuki coupling, resulting in a fully conjugated system that facilitates charge transport. In follow-up work by the same authors, photoelectrochemical currents of ca. 3.50 A cm-2 were measured under 1 sun (100 mW cm-2, AM 1.5G) illumination without application of an external bias.166 Employing a similar functionalization strategy  diazonium grafting and Suzuki cross-coupling  a second iodine-bearing donor-acceptor chromophore,2-([2,2'-bithiophen]-5- ylmethylene)malononitrile (2T-(CN)2), was covalently immobilized onto diamond as well (Figure 15b).Also for this system, photocurrents of ca. 3.50 A cm-2 were obtained. Application of a -0.2 V bias lead to an increase of the photocurrent with 80% to approximately 6.3 A cm-2. The BDD electrodes were also benchmarked against ITO and fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) functionalized using similar reactions. Despite a lower surface coverage (0.44 monolayers), the generated photocurrents on diamond electrodes were 2.3 and 3 times larger than those on ITO (0.60 monolayers) and FTO (0.55 monolayers), respectively. Stability tests showed that after continuous illumination for 2 hours (1 sun), the diamond electrodes only suffered a 10% decrease in photocurrent, whereas this was 40% and 36% for ITO and FTO, respectively. These results highlight the advantage of the strong carbon- carbon bonds at the interface, which is unique to diamond photocathode materials.

Diamond surface functionalization with light-harvesting molecules through a combination of diazonium grafting and Suzuki cross-coupling was also investigated in our institute.141 In this work,special attention was devoted to the efficiency of the Suzuki-Miyaura reaction and the surface coverage was optimized by employing a combination of palladium(II) acetate (Pd(OAc)2) and 2- dicyclohexylphosphino-2,6-dimethoxybiphenyl (SPhos) as the catalyst system. SPhos is a sterically hindered electron-rich biarylmonodentate ligand that is employed for the coupling of large and bulky molecules.235 The electron-rich nature of the ligand favors oxidative addition, whereas its bulkiness results in a very reactive complex that undergoes rapid reductive elimination, affording increased Page 24 of 53 Journal of Materials Chemistry C Journal of Materials Chemistry C Accepted Manuscript Published on 08 August 2019.

25 coupling efficiencies.236 Hence, the Suzuki coupling efficiency of a phenylboronic acid functionalized diamond surface with brominated (5-([2,2'-bithiophen]-5-ylmethylene)-4-oxo-2-thioxothiazolidin-3- yl)acetic acid (BT-Rho) and (3-cyano-4-(2-(4,4-diethyl-4H-cyclopenta[2,1-b:3,4-b']dithiophen-2- yl)vinyl)-5,5-dimethylfuran-2(5H)-ylidene)malononitrile (CPDT-Fur), as shown in (Figure 15c), was increased to 0.58 and 0.56 monolayers, respectively, an increase of approximately 30% compared to previous reports.166 The inverted functionalization strategy  bromophenyl functionalized diamond and chromophores carrying boronic acid groups  was also pursued, but a lower surface coverage was obtained. This was tentatively explained by the fact that the cross-coupling reaction proceeds slower when the Pd-complex is formed at the diamond interface, as was also observed for the Stille cross-coupling on diamond (vide infra).140 Both the BT-Rho and CPDT-Fur chromophores have high molar extinction coefficients (ε = 43 200 M-1 cm-1 at λmax = 473 nm and ε = 73 100 M-1 cm-1 at λmax = 582 nm) and a suitable energy level alignment where the HOMO is situated 0.3 and 0.5 eV below the valence band of diamond, respectively (as determined by UPS). Illumination of diamond electrodes sensitized by BT-Rho provided photocurrents of ca. 85 nA cm-2, whereas those sensitized with CPDT- Fur yielded currents up to approximately 140 nA cm-2. The measurements were performed in an 0.1 M Na2SO4 electrolyte solution containing 5 mM methyl viologen under 0.15 sun irradiation (15 mA cm-2) at an applied bias of -0.2 V. Despite the increased surface coverage, the generated photocurrents are still several orders of magnitude lower than the state of the art TiO2 and NiO DSSCs. This can partly be attributed to the morphology of the diamond films. The employed flat diamond electrodes have a roughness factor (Rf) of 4, which is far lower than those of nanostructured TiO2 electrodes (RF = 1000).In order to improve the photocurrents, a mesoporous diamond electrode was created by spin- coating silica spheres (d = 500 nm) on top of a flat BDD electrode.9 These spheres were subsequently overgrown with BDD (gas feed with a 12 000 ppm B/C ratio), resulting in 5-6 layers of diamond coated spheres. Finally, the silica spheres were etched away through an HF treatment, giving rise to a porous diamond electrode. The roughness factor for these diamond foams was calculated to be 114,approximately 30 times higher than for the thin films. Functionalization of these foam electrodes with BT-Rho and CPDT-fur resulted in photocurrents between 500 and 700 nA cm-2 under 0.2 sun illumination at an applied bias of -0.2 V. If we consider the slightly increased light intensity, only a 3- fold increase in the photocurrent was obtained despite the nearly 30-fold increase in Rf value.165 This lower than proportional increase of the current is most likely caused by an incomplete dye coverage due to sp2 carbon impurities and a complex morphology of the diamond foam.Remarkable results were obtained when the long-term stability of BT-Rho functionalized electrodes was investigated under 1 sun illumination and at an applied bias of -0.3 V. Initially,currents of ca. 2 A cm-2 were observed, which is more or less proportional with the increased light intensity. However, after 24 hours of constant illumination, the photocurrents increased to ca. 15 A cm-2 and even values of 22 A cm-2 were reached for the best performing electrode. This so-called aging-activation mechanism was also observed for diamond foams functionalized with CPDT-Fur,albeit with lower photocurrents, as well as on flat diamond electrodes. Analysis of the action spectra (incident photon-to-electron conversion efficiency (IPCE) vs. wavelength) for BT-Rho functionalized electrodes showed that the absorption peak at 470 nm gradually decreases over time, whereas the originally weaker absorption peak at 350 nm becomes more intense (Figure 16). This seems to indicate that degradation of the dye occurs. However, how this then positively influences the photocurrents has yet to be unraveled.Page 25 of 53 Journal of Materials Chemistry C Journal of Materials Chemistry C Accepted Manuscript Published on 08 August 2019.

26 Figure 16  Action spectra for a diamond foam electrode sensitized with BT-Rho after chopped illumination at 1 sun and an applied bias of -0.3 V. [Reprinted with permission]165 In addition to the Suzuki cross-coupling, other Pd-catalyzed reactions have also been investigated for the construction of uninterrupted conjugated diamond-chromophore systems. The Stille cross- coupling was recently deemed unsuitable since a high amount of Pd and Sn impurities remained on the diamond surface due to the unstable nature of the organotin reagents.140 On the other hand, the Sonogashira cross-coupling, which uses more stable alkyne derivatives, was successfully employed to couple alkynylated 2-(benzo[2,1,3]thiadiazol-4-yl)-4-hexyl-4H-dithieno[3,2-b:2,3-d]pyrrole (DTP-BT) onto iodophenyl-functionalized diamond (Figure 15d).159 By varying the employed catalyst system,base and concentration, the surface coverage, which is expressed by the atomic concentration of sulfur as measured by XPS, was increased from 1.1 to 2.3%. The photoresponse of the corresponding diamond electrodes increased accordingly from  200 to  450 nA cm-2 under 0.9 sun illumination at an applied bias of -0.2 V. The possibly negative effects of contamination with Pd were also demonstrated, as the photocurrents for samples that show increased Pd concentrations on the surface were considerably lower. The same alkynylated DTP-BT dye was also attached to an azidophenyl functionalized diamond electrode via CuAAC. By clicking the dye to the diamond surface, a slightly higher surface coverage was obtained. However, the generated photocurrents were 3 times lower (140 nA cm-2). The observed difference was ascribed to the employed linker. In comparison with the flat diamond electrodes functionalized via Suzuki cross-coupling, the photocurrents are slightly lower (taking into account the different light intensities). However, it should be mentioned that the molar extinction coefficient of the DTP-BT chromophore (ε = 18 600 M- 1 cm-1 at λmax = 474 nm) is rather modest and its high HOMO level (-5.21 eV), which is situated slightly above the VBM of diamond, is actually unfavorable for hole injection.A final donor-acceptor chromophore that was thoroughly investigated by Krysova et al. is 4-(bis- (4-[5-(2,2-dicyanovinyl)-thiophene-2-yl]phenyl)amino)benzoic acid or the
P1
dye.
This commercially available chromophore has a high molar extinction coefficient of 58 000 M-1 cm-1 at a wavelength of 468 nm and was previously employed for sensitization of p-NiO,237 making it an excellent starting point in the quest for a suitable diamond sensitizer. The HOMO of P1 (-5.81 eV) is also well below the VBM of diamond in contact with an electrolyte solution. In their first study, BDD (gas feed with a 4,000 ppm B/C ratio) was first non-covalently functionalized by adsorption of a thin (5 nm) layer of polyethyleneimine (PEI). The amine groups on the polymer were then employed to form a stable amide bond through an acylation reaction with the acid chloride derivative of the P1 Page 26 of 53 Journal of Materials Chemistry C Journal of Materials Chemistry C Accepted Manuscript Published on 08 August 2019.

27 dye, P1-Cl (Figure 17a).238 The advantage of this functionalization strategy is obviously the circumvention of the sometimes complicated multi-step surface reaction sequence or the poor yields when the chromophores are directly attached to the surface. Photoelectrochemical measurements in a 0.1 M Na2SO4 solution with MV2+ as redox couple under 0.18 sun illumination resulted in photocurrents of ca. 130 nA cm-2 at an applied bias of -0.2 V. This demonstrates that PEI, which has insulating properties, does not prevent hole injection into diamond, which proceeds in a tunneling fashion.
In their second study related to the P1 dye, similar BDD electrodes were functionalized in a completely covalent fashion.109 The primary surface functionalization in a near monolayer fashion was done through photochemical grafting of short terminal alkene linkers, bearing a protected amine group. After deprotection, the amine could again be employed to form an amide bond with P1-Cl (Figure 17b).
The employed linkers are N-allyltrifluoroacetamide and
N-
allyltrifluoromethanesulfonamide. Photoelectrochemical measurements on electrodes where the P1 dye was tethered via a sulfonamide linker demonstrated a poorer performance (200 nA cm-2) than when an acetamide linker was employed (900 nA cm-2; under 1 sun illumination and at an applied bias of -0.3 V). This is somewhat surprising since the strong electron-accepting properties of the sulfonamide linker should facilitate photochemical grafting. However, sulfonamide protecting groups also require harsher deprotection conditions. As a result, a lower amount of P1 dye molecules can eventually be coupled in comparison with the acetamide linker, which is reflected in the photocurrents. The value of 900 nA cm-2 for a fully covalently functionalized electrode also compares favorably to the non-covalent approach previously employed, even after taking into account the difference in irradiation intensity. This highlights the importance of the actual carbon-carbon bond formation at the diamond interface.

The long term stability of these systems was evaluated upon extended illumination with 1 sun. A similar aging-activation phenomenon as for the diamond foams was observed. After 5 hours of chopped light illumination, the initial photocurrent increased from 900 nA cm-2 to 1.5 A cm-2, after which it dropped again to 600 nA cm-2 when the illumination was extended for up to 45 hours. In the most recent study, the fully covalent surface functionalization as demonstrated in Figure 17b was further improved by employing an upgraded photoelectrochemical setup. All reactions were initially performed on nanodiamond in order to carefully characterize the surface chemistry and then extended to flat diamond electrodes.239 This optimization resulted in a 3-fold increase of the photocurrents (2.5 to 3.2 A cm-2) when identical illumination (1 sun and a bias of -0.3 V) and doping (4,000 ppm B/C) conditions were applied. In addition to improving the surface functionalization, the influence of the doping level was addressed and diamond electrodes with varying doping levels (250, Page 27 of 53 Journal of Materials Chemistry C Journal of Materials Chemistry C Accepted Manuscript Published on 08 August 2019.

28 500, 1,000, 2,000 and 4,000 ppm B/C ratios in the gas phase) were investigated. Surface analysis of the different functionalized electrodes by AFM did not reveal any significant differences in morphology. Additionally, XPS analysis indicated a similar surface coverage for all samples based on the sulfur concentrations. Nevertheless, the generated photocurrents strongly increased with decreasing doping levels and stable (up to 1 hour) currents of 6.6 A cm-2 were generated for the diamond electrodes with the lowest (250 ppm B/C) doping level (Figure 18). The only notable difference between the samples was the lower oxygen concentration on the 250 ppm B/C sample.
This lead to the hypothesis that oxygen-rich diamond surfaces are potentially undesirable for photocurrent generation in diamond-based DSSCs.

3.1.2.3. Various chromophores
Apart from the metal complexes and donor-acceptor molecules, other types of chromophores have been employed as well to sensitize diamond electrodes. One such example is the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon pyrene. A BDD electrode was first treated with singlet oxygen to hydroxylate the surface. The resulting alcohol groups were then employed to anchor pyrenebutyric acid molecules through esterification (Figure 19a).178 Photoelectrochemical measurements were performed in a 0.1 NaCl solution under illumination with a 351 nm Ar laser at an intensity of 5 mW cm-2 and a bias of -0.2 V. When an Ar-purged electrolyte solution was employed, photocurrents of 150 nA cm-2 were obtained. When the solution was saturated with oxygen, the photocurrents increased to 3.0 A cm-2, which was explained by the possibility of oxygen to react with excited pyrene molecules.
Other work involved the electrostatic self-assembly of phosphotungstic acid (PTA), a type of polyoxometalate, on BDD electrodes functionalized with a bilayer of an in situ diazotized pyridinium dye through electrochemical diazonium grafting (Figure 19b).142 In the action spectrum of diamond electrodes functionalized with only the pyridinium dye, photocurrents of approximately 600 nA cm-2 were detected at a wavelength of 350 nm and at an applied bias of -0.1 V. After self-assembly of PTA,the photocurrents remarkably decreased to only 50 nA cm-2 under similar operating conditions,indicating that the addition of PTA impedes the flow of electrons. Electrochemical analysis of the energy levels of PTA revealed that its redox potential is slightly below (0.3 eV) that of the redox couple MV2+/MV1+. As a result, the excited electrons from the HOMO of the dye are transferred back to the PTA layer, where recombination is higher since PTA cannot diffuse to the counter electrode.

A limiting factor for high photocurrents on dye-sensitized electrodes, especially for diamond due to its intrinsic inertness, will always be the difficulty to anchor a large amount of chromophores. Lim et al. attempted to circumvent this problem by coating BDD with P3HT, a commonly employed polymer in organic photovoltaics.240 H-terminated, OH-terminated and O-terminated BDD electrodes were decorated with a thin (20 nm) layer of P3HT through spin-coating and the photovoltaic performance was compared to ITO. The lowest photocurrents  under 1 sun irradiation and no applied bias  were obtained for H-terminated diamond and the ITO reference (both ca. 3 A cm-2).
OH-terminated diamond electrodes on the other hand generated currents of 9 A cm-2, whereas the best results were obtained for O-terminated diamond electrodes, with photocurrents of 12 A cm-2.
The observed results can partially be explained by looking at the VOC for the different electrodes,which is defined by the energy difference between the Fermi level of the electrode and the redox potential of methyl viologen (Figure 20). H-terminated diamond and ITO both have a VOC of 100 mV,which is much smaller than the values (1.0 and 1.3 V) for OH- and O-terminated diamond,respectively. Additionally, in case of the OH- and O-terminated electrodes, an interfacial dipole with P3HT is present, which facilitates the injection of charge carriers, resulting in a higher photocurrent density. Under prolonged irradiation for 2 hours, no decrease in photocurrent was observed for O- terminated electrodes, which is in sharp contrast with the 52% decrease on ITO after only 20 minutes.

30 The final system discussed here for photovoltaic applications is somewhat unique in the sense that not merely simple dye molecules, but more complex reaction centers are employed. These reaction centers are the biological units that enable solar energy harvesting in plants and bacteria.
Their highly efficient charge separation mechanism renders them attractive candidates for the development of bio-solar cells.241 However, great care is needed when immobilizing these reactions centers on inorganic electrodes to prevent their denaturation. Caterino et al. have successfully functionalized BDD electrodes with reaction centers via two different approaches (Figure 21).208 In the first strategy, a monolayer of 6-phosphonohexanoic acid was grafted onto OH- terminated diamond. The available carboxylic acid groups were then employed to anchor cytochrome c (cyt-c), an electron mediator that regenerates the reaction center, through an amide bond. Finally, the reaction centers were physisorbed onto the functionalized electrodes.
Photoelectrochemical measurements were performed in 10 mM PBS buffer with 10 M cyt-c and 100 M of free quinone molecule (Q0), which functions as a redox electrolyte (similar to MV2+ in the previously discussed systems). Upon irradiation with NIR light (870 nm) and at an applied bias of -0.1 V, this system afforded photocurrents of 50 nA cm-2. An improvement to this system was made by replacing cyt-c with aminomethylferrocene (AMF). The more efficient electron transfer between AMF and the diamond electrode resulted in 5 times larger photocurrents (250 nA cm-2) and a faster response to light/dark. A second functionalization strategy involved the polymerization of poly(tert- butyl methyl acrylate) brushes on the diamond surface.  Saponification of the methyl ester functional groups allowed attachment of AMF and physisorption of the reaction centers similar to the monolayer approach. Obviously, in this way a larger amount of reaction centers could be attached to the functional surface, which immediately translated itself in much higher photocurrents of 1500 nA cm-2. Despite the increasing distance from the reaction center to the electrode, the light/dark response did not decrease. Long-term stability measurements showed that after 15 hours of illumination, only 30% of the photocurrent was retained. This was attributed to a combination of denaturation and desorption of the reaction centers.

31 electrodes results in a better photocurrent generation when compared to a non-covalent approach for the same dye system. (ii) Increasing the surface coverage by employing nanostructured diamond significantly improves the photocurrents. However, this increase is not proportional to the increase in surface area due to the higher sp2-carbon content in these nanostructured electrodes and their complex morphology. (iii) Lowering the boron doping concentration positively influences the photoelectrochemical performance. This can be partially explained by the fact that the structural quality of the diamond film increases with lower doping concentrations due to lower amounts of sp2 carbon. However, it is remarkable that the sample that has a gas feed with a 250 ppm B/C ratio shows the best performance since the resulting boron concentration of 1 x 1020 places it slightly below the threshold to have a metallic conductivity,11 which is assumed to be necessary to obtain good charge carrier mobilities. Hence, further research on the influence of the doping concentration is required.

Photocatalysis
3.2.1. NH3 synthesis
Another specific feature that is strongly related to the surface functionalization of diamond is the possibility to generate solvated electrons.242 This is a direct consequence of the NEA intrinsic to H- terminated diamond electrodes.243, 244 The terminal C-H bonds generate a surface dipole that lowers the electron affinity and thus increases the position of the conduction band minimum up to -1.3 eV (compared to the vacuum level).245 As a result, upon illumination of H-terminated diamond surfaces with UV light (hν > 5.5 eV), the electrons that are excited from the valence band to the conduction band can readily be ejected into vacuum or in a liquid in a barrier-free fashion.210, 246, 247 Through electron ejection into liquids, solvated electrons can be created. These solvated electrons are simple,yet, extremely potent reducing agents that can be employed in chemical and biological reactions.248- 250 In 2013, the group of R.J. Hamers was the first to demonstrate diamonds unique property to serve as a direct source of solvated electrons in water.242 The electron emission from diamond into water was detected by directly measuring the resulting solvated electrons employing transient absorption spectroscopy, as illustrated in Figure 22a. The diamond sample was illuminated using a pulsed UV laser (213 nm) while the change in intensity of a laser beam with a wavelength of 633 nm in parallel with the diamond surface was detected. In Figure 22b one can clearly see a decrease in intensity of the transmitted 633 nm light due to absorption by solvated electrons, which have a maximum lifetime of approximately 150 ns. By purging the aqueous solution for 90 seconds with N2O, a commonly known electron scavenger, both the intensity and lifetime of the solvated electrons drastically decreased. When performing this experiment under acidic conditions (pH = 2), barely any solvated electrons were detected since they rapidly react with protons to form neutral atomic hydrogen. When metallic electrodes (Niobium) are employed, the lifetime of the generated solvated electrons drastically decreased.251 This observation is easily explained by the presence of a continuum of states in metal surfaces, which provides an easy pathway for recombination. In diamond electrodes on the other hand, the energy of the solvated electrons lies well below the conduction band minimum and no or very limited states are available for recombination. The lifetime of solvated electrons near the diamond surface is therefore controlled by reactions with other chemical species. As mentioned above, these solvated electrons are extremely useful as they can be employed as strong reducing agents (ca. -4.6 V vs NHE) in chemical reactions that are not accessible through conventional methods.

33 Figure 22  a. Illustration of the transient light absorption measurements. b. Change in intensity of transmitted 633 nm light after excitation of H-terminated BDD with UV light of 213 nm. [Reprinted with permission, Copyright (2013) Springer Nature]242 One such example is the photocatalytic reduction of nitrogen gas (N2) to ammonia (NH3), which is especially difficult since binding both N2 and hydrogen gas (H2) to a solid-state catalyst is not convenient252, 253 and high-energy intermediates are involved in the reaction.254 By employing diamond as a source of solvated electrons, the issue of adsorbing N2 is circumvented and high-energy intermediates become more readily accessible.242 The actual capability of diamond to produce ammonia was demonstrated by employing a BDD sample of electrochemical quality in a single- compartment cell filled with N2-saturated water under illumination with above-bandgap light. To maintain charge neutrality, it is required that for every reduction reaction, a corresponding oxidation reaction should occur as well. Since oxidation of water at a diamond electrode is an inefficient process, the reduction of ammonia is limited by the oxidation rate.255 Therefore, the efficiency was further improved by employing a dual-compartment cell, where the oxidation reaction occurs at a platinum electrode in a 0.002 M KI solution. During prolonged illumination of the diamond sample,the ability to reduce nitrogen was retained. However, with increasing illumination time, a gradual decrease in the activity was observed. XPS and valence-band photoemission spectroscopy showed that the initially H-terminated sample is slowly being oxidized and that the surface is gradually converted to one with a PEA, which prevents electron emission (since the conduction band minimum is below the vacuum level) and thus decreases the ammonia yield. The issue of the decreasing photocatalytic activity was resolved by changing from a H-terminated diamond sample to a NH2- terminated one through plasma treatment of the surface.54 When operating at neutral pH values, all primary amino (C-NH2) groups at the diamond surface should be protonated,256 creating a positively charged layer, resulting in a NEA. As-prepared NH2-terminated diamond electrodes showed a similar efficiency in reducing N2 compared to a H-terminated surface. However, after briefly submerging the samples in concentrated HCl, an almost 2-fold increase in efficiency was observed (Figure 23). This can be attributed to the fact that in case of a monolayer of primary amine groups at neutral pH, only a fraction of the NH2 groups are protonated and more acidic conditions are required to overcome Page 33 of 53 Journal of Materials Chemistry C Journal of Materials Chemistry C Accepted Manuscript Published on 08 August 2019.

34 coulombic repulsion between the positively charged groups.257, 258 The increased positive charge on the surface after submerging the samples in HCl facilitates electron emission and thus increases the ammonia yields. More importantly, XPS analysis of NH2-terminated samples showed a significant enhancement of the stability under the employed photochemical reaction conditions compared to the H-terminated samples.
Figure 23  Ammonia yield for H-terminated, NH2-functionalized and HCl treated NH2-functionalized diamond electrodes. [Reprinted with permission, Copyright (2016) Elsevier]54 Recently, the photoelectron emission of diamond and its ability to photo-catalyse the synthesis of ammonia has been further improved by developing an electrode where silver nanoparticles of approximately 100 nm are embedded within the diamond film.259 These diamond-Ag-diamond (D-Ag- D) electrodes show a ca. 2.5-fold increase in ammonia yield compared to regular electrodes under illumination with full spectrum light for 5 hours. When a filter is employed that eliminates wavelengths below 225 nm, the D-Ag-D electrodes show a 5-fold increase, while upon eliminating wavelengths below 280 nm, a double efficiency is still obtained compared to the standard H- terminated diamond (Figure 24).

[Reprinted with permission, Copyright (2018) American Chemical Society]259 To get a clear understanding of how Ag can influence the properties of diamond to reduce N2, the different pathways for the photoemission of electrons were investigated (Figure 25).259 The first pathway (1) involves the direct excitation of an electron from the valence band of diamond to the Page 34 of 53 Journal of Materials Chemistry C Journal of Materials Chemistry C Accepted Manuscript Published on 08 August 2019.

35 conduction band upon illumination with above bandgap light. The presence of Ag nanoparticles can enhance the optical scattering and thus increase the optical path length for deep UV photons within the diamond film.260 The second pathway (2) involves internal photoemission, where electrons are directly excited from the valence band of Ag to the conduction band of diamond. Since the valence band of Ag lies slightly above that of diamond, the required wavelengths for this pathway should be below 260 nm. The final pathway (3) is classified as defect associated photoemission. In this case,electrons are excited from states associated to higher energetic sp2-hybridized graphitic carbon impurities present in the diamond lattice with wavelengths of ca. 350 nm. Incorporation of Ag nanoparticles could contribute to this pathway if the amount of graphitic carbon is increased by doing so. Based on the experimental results in Figure 25, it was concluded that the introduction of Ag nanoparticles has the strongest contribution to pathway (2), whereas pathway (3) is relatively unimportant.
Figure 25  Different pathways for the excitation of electrons to the conduction band of diamond and subsequent steps leading to the reduction of N2. [Reprinted with permission, Copyright (2018) American Chemical Society]259 A combination of experimental and theoretical studies has revealed that the reduction of N2 to ammonia in an aqueous solution proceeds via a single mechanism.251, 261, 262 First, the solvated electrons react with protons to form atomic hydrogen (e-(aq.) + H+    H•). Next, the atomic hydrogen will react with N2 to form N2H, which will again react with atomic hydrogen to produce diazene (N2H2). Diazene is a stable molecule that can be further reduced to hydrazine (N2H4) and ammonia

3.2.2. CO2 reduction
Apart from the photoreduction of nitrogen gas to ammonia, the photo- and electrochemical properties of diamond also make it a very suitable candidate for the reduction of carbon dioxide.
Nowadays, decreasing the amount of carbon dioxide in the Earth atmosphere is receiving a huge amount of attention, also at a political level, and large investments for the development of novel technologies are being made because of the impeding climate crisis. However, research on the photoelectrochemical reduction of CO2 in aqueous conditions has already been performed since the 70s.265 Depending on the employed electrode material, carbon dioxide can be transformed into a variety of valuable chemical compounds, such as methanol, formic acid, formaldehyde, carbon monoxide and methane.266, 267 Initial reports on the application of diamond electrodes for CO2 reduction solely rely on its electrochemical properties, i.e. a broad potential window. In these cases,highly doped diamond (B conc. 1021 cm-3) is either functionalized with Co-porphyrins to facilitate the Page 35 of 53 Journal of Materials Chemistry C Journal of Materials Chemistry C Accepted Manuscript Published on 08 August 2019.

36 reduction of CO2,117 or the boron/nitrogen-doped diamond is employed as such, while applying a reductive potential using cyclic voltammetry.268, 269 Only in 2014, the photochemical properties of diamond were harnessed for the reduction of CO2 to carbon monoxide.270 BDD electrodes of electrochemical grade in an electrolyte solution with a Pt counter electrode (dual-compartment cell) were pressurized to 2.5 MPa with CO2. Upon illumination with UV light, CO2 was reduced to CO with very high selectivity (more than 95%) over the reduction of H+ to form hydrogen gas. Similar to the reduction of N2, the mechanism is expected to proceed through (1) the excitation of an electron from the valence band of diamond to its conduction band and (2) subsequent emission into the aqueous solution, (3) generating solvated electrons (Figure 26). These solvated electrons have strong reductive properties and can react in a one-electron reaction with either H+ or CO2 to form H• or CO2•-. Due to the high CO2 concentration (2.5 MPa) and lower energy of the CO2 anion radical, the latter reaction is favored. CO2•- then further photo-dissociates into CO.
Figure 26  Energy diagram of H-terminated diamond and relevant redox potentials regarding the photoelectrochemical reduction of CO2. [Reprinted with permission, Copyright (2014) Wiley]270 The same experiment was also performed by dispersing detonation nanodiamond (ca. 5 nm diameter) in water. In this setup, a single-compartment cell had to be employed, so both the reduction and oxidation reaction occur at the diamond electrode.251 However, employing isotopically labeled 13CO2 revealed that the detected 12CO did not originate from the photocatalytic reduction of 13CO2, but from oxidation of carbon from the diamond surface itself, which is favored over the oxidation of water.271 To avoid this photo-induced etching of diamond, two specific improvements to the system were made.272 First, the detonation nanodiamond, which was determined to have a large amount of reactive surface defects and possible poor H-termination, was replaced with nanoparticles made from natural diamond (ca. 125 nm diameter). These nanoparticles have a better crystal quality,which diminishes oxidation of the surface, and superior H-termination, which favors electron emission.273 Next, an electrolyte solution containing Na2SO4 and Na2SO3 was employed as a sacrificial donor. The SO32- anion is an efficient hole scavenger and its oxidation provides an alternative, more suitable pathway for maintaining charge neutrality in the system, decreasing the oxidation of the diamond surface itself. These combined efforts resulted in the successful reduction of CO2 to CO employing diamond nanoparticles. However, the required high operating pressure of 2.5 MPa to favor CO2 reduction over H2 gas production is inconvenient for actual applications.
Roy et al. studied an alternative approach to employ diamond electrodes for the reduction of CO2 at atmospheric pressure and temperature by electrodepositing Ag nanoparticles on top of O- terminated lightly boron-doped diamond (BDDL) electrodes.274 By cycling to a reductive potential of -

37 in a CO2 saturated aqueous solution with and without illumination (Figure 27a). While applying a constant potential of -1.1 V vs. RHE, the dark experiment showed a rapid decrease of the photocurrent from -0.3 to -0.2 mA/cm2. The experiment where the samples were illuminated with UV light (222 nm) showed an increase in activity, which stabilized after approximately 60 minutes, as shown in Figure 27b. The observed increase in photocurrent density was attributed to the photo- excitation and activation of the Ag-covered BDDL electrodes. Analysis of the reduction products revealed a Faradaic efficiency of 72.5% for CO and 9.08% for H2 for a Ag-covered diamond electrode electrodeposited from a 0.1 M AgNO3 solution. The high product selectivity for CO was obtained due to the presence of the Ag nanoparticles. A decrease of the AgNO3 concentration resulted in lower Faradaic efficiencies for CO. Employing highly boron-doped diamond (BDDH) or glassy carbon electrodes also had a negative influence on the selective reduction to CO. The performance of these Ag-covered BDDL electrodes was further improved via a pretreatment of the diamond surface.275 This was done by cycling the BDD electrode between a potential of 0 and -2.0 V vs. Ag/AgCl for 250 cycles in a sulfuric acid solution, resulting in H-termination of the surface. The resulting NEA lead to a positive shift of the current for the reduction of CO2 with approximately 0.4 V and the Faradaic efficiency for CO further increased to 77.6%.

3.2.3. Water Splitting
Amongst the different photocatalytic applications, the conversion of water to O2 and H2 gas might be the one with the highest environmental impact as this allows the conversion of solar energy into chemical fuel. In these photoelectrochemical cells, sunlight is absorbed by a semiconductor and the resulting electron-hole pairs can catalyze the splitting of water into its components. Depending on the employed photocatalyst, water is either oxidized or reduced in the respective oxygen or hydrogen evolution reaction at the working electrode. Generally, a broad absorption window, good charge separation and long term stability of the electrode material are required to obtain efficient electrodes for solar water splitting.276 Although diamond is not an ideal candidate as a photocatalyst for water splitting due to its wide bandgap, H-terminated detonation nanodiamond has been employed for the photocatalytic reduction of water.277 Nevertheless, the true potential of diamond for water splitting lies in its application as a protective coating due to its high corrosion resistance and transparency or as electrode material due to its good p-type conductivity upon doping with Page 37 of 53 Journal of Materials Chemistry C Journal of Materials Chemistry C Accepted Manuscript Published on 08 August 2019.

38 boron. Since diamond will only function as a backing electrode or coating, a suitable semiconductor should be employed to provide sufficient energy for the electrolysis of water.278 Silicon-based photoelectrodes absorb a significant fraction of the solar light and they have been proven to be excellent materials for the development of solar cells. However, application of silicon in water splitting is limited due to its high sensitivity for corrosion and dissolution of the electrode material under continuous oxidizing conditions in a photoelectrochemical cell. By employing conductive BDD as a coating, Ashcheulov et al. were able to protect the underlying silicon photoelectrode during the oxygen evolution reaction (Figure 28).279 However, since diamond has a wide electrochemical potential window and thus poor catalytic properties, the oxygen evolution reaction has a large onset potential of 1.9 V vs. RHE in dark conditions, whereas the water oxidation potential is 1.23 V vs. RHE. The low catalytic activity and large overpotential for the oxygen evolution reaction was addressed by electrodepositing cobalt phosphate, an oxygen evolution catalyst, onto the diamond coating.280 This resulted in a significant reduction of the water oxidation onset potential to 1.6 V vs. RHE. Under 1 sun illumination, the photovoltaic component of the photoelectrode provided a photovoltage of approximately 0.5 V, which promotes charge separation of the generated holes and electrons. Upon injection of the holes into the valence band of diamond, they can participate in the oxidation of water, which further decreased the onset potential to  1.1 V vs. RHE.
In addition to employing diamond coated Si photovoltaics for the oxygen evolution reaction, Halima et al. investigated their performance for the hydrogen evolution reaction under acidic conditions,which improved the stability of the electrode. However, it should be mentioned that in this study all experiments were performed without exposure to light.281 Figure 28  Schematic representation of a Si-based photoelectrochemical cell coated with a thin film of boron-doped diamond. The Si solar cell is responsible for light absorption and charge separation,while the oxygen evolution reactions occurs at the cobalt phosphate functionalized diamond electrode/electrolyte interface and the hydrogen evolution reactions takes place at the coiled metal electrode. [Reprinted with permission, Copyright (2018), American Chemical Society]280 Diamond can also serve as backing electrode material since it demonstrated superior performances in a benchmarking study against different electrodes for photoelectrochemical water splitting.282 Geiger et al. have constructed p-n hetero-structured electrodes to enhance the oxygen evolution reaction by sputtering a uniform TiO2 thin film on BDD.283 Optimization of the electrodes was performed by varying the sputtering time. The best electrode showed low leakage currents and a remarkably high rectifying ratio of 63,773 at an applied potential of 5.0 V.

39 photoelectrochemical water splitting under 1 sun illumination, the generated currents for TiO2/diamond and the TiO2 reference electrode were similar when the voltage was increased from -
0.1 to +0.43 V vs SHE. However, in the potential region above 0.43 V, the TiO2/diamond electrode
showed superior behavior, with an increase of 60% compared to the TiO2 reference. The improved quality of the hetero-structured electrodes is ascribed to the presence of a high quality p-n junction that promotes charge separation.
In addition to covering diamond with TiO2, which is an efficient photocatalyst for the oxygen evolution reaction, BDD electrodes have also been functionalized with NiO-Cu2O particles to catalyze the hydrogen evolution reaction.284 The bandgap and energy levels of Cu2O make it an interesting material for the photoelectrochemical reduction of water. However, the short exciton diffusion length, low hole mobilities and self-photo-corrosion of Cu2O limit its practical application. By employing NiO as a co-catalyst, self-photo-corrosion of Cu2O can be overcome. Hence, after electrodepositing cubic Cu2O particles on BDD, the electrodes were functionalized with NiO particles through repetitive dip-coating steps. Photoelectrochemical performances of the photocatalysts were evaluated under 1 sun illumination. When no external potential was applied one can see from Table 2 that the photocurrent increased with an increasing amount of coating steps up to 15 layers. The improved activity of the photoelectrochemical cell is a result of the suitable energy level alignment of the NiO-coated Cu2O particles, which facilitates transfer of the generated charges to the interface.
Further increasing the amount of NiO on the electrode to 20 layers resulted in a decrease of the photocurrent since a too thick layer of NiO hinders photoabsorption by Cu2O. Also, it should be mentioned that after 6 coatings steps, the photoconversion efficiency dropped due to an increased dark current.

Apart from thin film heterostructures, composite materials were made by embedding nanodiamond in Cu2O nanocrystals. The electron-donating behavior of nanodiamond and a suitable energy level alignment promote electron injection from diamond into the Cu2O matrix. As a result,these nanocomposites demonstrated an improved charge separation and thus higher hydrogen evolution reaction rates compared to Cu2O only.285 The hydrogen evolution for nanodiamond-Cu2O nanocrystals were studied under 1 sun illumination. Upon increasing the nanodiamond loading, the H2 production increased accordingly, reaching a maximum at 3 wt%. Further increase of the nanodiamond loading again resulted in a decrease of the H2 yield. Similar results were observed for nanodiamond-graphitic carbon nitride (ND@g-C3N4) heterostructures. Here, a maximum yield for the hydrogen evolution reaction was observed for a nanodiamond content of 12 wt%.286 In both cases,addition of nanodiamond improved the light absorption due to efficient light scattering at the nanodiamond/g-C3N4 or Cu2O interface. The photoluminescence intensity of the composites was also Page 39 of 53 Journal of Materials Chemistry C Journal of Materials Chemistry C Accepted Manuscript Published on 08 August 2019.

40 significantly lower, which indicates a suppression of charge recombination. Hence, the addition of nanodiamond allows the generation of more charge carriers, while improving their separation at the same time. However, employing an excessive amount of nanodiamond might hinder the contacts between the photocatalyst and the reagent, water, resulting in a lower hydrogen gas yield.
4. Conclusions and future perspectives
In order to transform diamond from a simply beautiful object to a relevant photoelectrochemical material, understanding and controlling the surface chemistry plays a crucial role. Diamond is generally considered to be a very inert material that is difficult to functionalize. However, after three decades of research on its surface chemistry, a multitude of innovative methods have been developed to alter the diamond surface composition and to attach functional (macro)molecules. The hydrogen termination on as-grown CVD diamond is readily exchanged for oxygen, nitrogen and even halogen atoms, drastically altering the surface properties. Depending on the treatment protocol or the applied potential during electrochemical oxidation, the ratio of alcohol, carbonyl and ether species can be controlled.32, 48 In most cases, OH-termination is desired as this enables straightforward further functionalization via silanization, esterification or thermal alkylation.
Similarly, for nitrogen-terminated surfaces a high amount of primary amine groups is targeted toward subsequent amidation reactions, which can be achieved by controlled plasma treatments.70 On the other hand, H-terminated surfaces have also been employed to covalently attach small (linker) molecules via stable and robust carbon-carbon bonds. This, however, remains limited to two well-known approaches, i.e. diazonium and photochemical grafting. Nevertheless, significant improvements have been achieved over the years for both grafting procedures. A major drawback of electrochemical diazonium grafting, the lack of control over the thickness of the grafted layer and multilayer formation, has been resolved. By either controlling the charge in a constant potential method, employing bulky diazonium salts, adding radical scavengers or using the spontaneous grafting method, thin monolayers can be obtained. Very recently, an alternative for the photochemical grafting of alkenes has also been proposed, that generates surface radicals, which can react with the terminal alkene functionalities.287 Accordingly, a broader range of molecules can be grafted to the surface since the prerequisite that they should not absorb light at 254 nm, as employed in photochemical grafting, no longer holds. Functionalization of diamond with molecules bearing reactive moieties via diazonium or photochemical grafting enabled the exploration of numerous chemical reactions on diamond. In this way, complex light-harvesting small molecule chromophores have been immobilized on the diamond surface toward the development of p-type dye-sensitized solar cells. Very important here is a good energy level alignment between the dye molecules and both the valence band of diamond and the reduction potential of the redox electrolyte. Hence, the surface has been decorated with various metal-complex, donor-acceptor and less conventional dyes such as polyoxometalates and biological reaction centers. Combined efforts on optimization of the employed chromophores and diamond surface chemistry resulted in the improvement of the photocurrent from a few nA to 6.5 A cm-2 for boron-doped nanocrystalline thin films and even 22 A cm-2 for boron-doped diamond foams.165,239 Additionally, the photoelectrochemical properties of diamond have been harnessed for the creation of solvated electrons, which are extremely potent reduction reagents that allow for the synthesis of ammonia from nitrogen and the reduction of carbon dioxide. Again, the surface functionalization plays a crucial role. Decorating diamond with protonated primary amines for instance increases the ammonia yield by a 3-fold.54 Similarly, embedding Ag nanoparticles in the diamond film or putting Page 40 of 53 Journal of Materials Chemistry C Journal of Materials Chemistry C Accepted Manuscript Published on 08 August 2019.

41 them on top of the surface results in a more efficient reduction of carbon dioxide to carbon monoxide.259, 275 It should be mentioned here that in most cases the diamond surface functionalization has been limited to a single functional group, despite the existence of patterning methods and the availability of orthogonal functionalization strategies. For example by applying both photochemical grafting and thermal alkylation procedures on a partially oxidized surface, two different functionalities can readily be introduced. Even on a completely H-terminated surface, mixed layers can be prepared via diazonium grafting of different diazonium salts.144 This can afford significant advances in the solar cell field since dyes with a complementary absorption spectra can be attached. On the other hand, also biosensors can be developed that screen for multiple target molecules. Therefore, we believe that continued efforts in exploring and optimizing the diamond surface chemistry, with special emphasis on multifunctionalized surfaces, will pave the road to various applications of functional diamond substrates.
