2 Abstract Diamond is a highly attractive material for photoelectrochemical applications such as dye- sensitized solar cells or photocatalysis because of its high chemical stability, high conductivity upon doping and the ease by which synthetic diamond thin films or nanostructures can be grown on various substrates. For these applications in particular, a well-defined surface functionalization is a crucial, yet non-trivial matter. In the first part of this review we therefore provide an extensive overview of the surface chemistry of doped and intrinsic diamond thin films. Different techniques to alter the surface termination of freshly grown diamond electrodes are illustrated and compared.
Next, the subsequent functionalization steps to form stable covalent bonds between (linker) molecules and the diamond surface are discussed, with special emphasis on photochemical and (electro)chemical diazonium grafting. Several strategies to fabricate macromolecular brushes via surface initiated and direct polymerization techniques are proposed as well. In the second part, the photocurrent generation of dye-sensitized boron-doped diamond electrodes is compared and the influence of the employed chromophores, functionalization strategy, surface contamination and doping concentrations is analyzed. To conclude, the emerging photocatalytic applications of diamond are highlighted, such as the reduction of carbon monoxide, ammonia synthesis and water splitting.

1. Introduction
Natural diamond is commonly known as a precious gemstone. However, as a result of the development of high-pressure high-temperature (HPHT) diamond synthesis and chemical vapour deposition (CVD) techniques,1-4 synthetic diamond has gained significant scientific and economic importance. Both single crystal and polycrystalline diamond can be grown on multiple surfaces and the grain size can be controlled from ultranano- to nano- and microcrystalline dimensions.5 Polishing of these surfaces allows for the development of atomically flat diamond films,6 whereas reactive ion etching and CVD growth on patterned templates result in different diamond nanostructures such as vertically aligned nanowires,7 diamond foams,8, 9 fibres,10 etc. Moreover, the conductivity of diamond, which is an insulating material in se due to its wide bandgap of 5.47 eV, can be tuned by substituting carbon atoms in the crystal lattice with boron or nitrogen and phosphorus to obtain p- type or n-type conductivity, respectively.11 At rather low doping levels ( 1019 atoms cm-3) diamond attains semiconducting properties, while higher doping levels (above 1020 atoms cm-3) result in a semi-metallic electrical behavior. In combination with diamonds unique intrinsic properties, i.e. an extreme hardness, high thermal conductivity, chemical inertness, broad potential window and biocompatibility, this has led to a broad range of applications. Boron-doped diamond (BDD) for example excels as an electrochemical material.12 It holds great promise for high power electronics13 and photodetectors,14 and plays a major role in quantum technologies.15 Over the past 10 years,diamond has also been gaining more and more interest as a photocathode material for alternative p- type dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) and for photocatalytic applications. Here, not only the bulk properties, but also the surface composition of diamond plays a crucial role in its success.
Although diamond is always considered an inert material, a multitude of strategies have been developed to alter its surface. The surface termination of freshly grown diamond depends on the available molecules during the growth process, which is typically hydrogen. However, these hydrogen atoms can be replaced by other elements such as oxygen, nitrogen, sulfur and even halogens by performing thermal, electrochemical or plasma treatments.16 Subsequently, the resulting surface termination can be exploited to covalently attach larger molecules such as light- harvesting dyes, DNA or proteins. The most popular functionalization strategies involve photochemical or diazonium grafting of terminal alkenes and diazonium salts, respectively, on H- terminated diamond.17 Accordingly, strong carbon-carbon bonds are formed between the surface and the target molecules. This results in a very robust interface that outperforms other semiconducting materials such as silicon, gold or glassy carbon in terms of stability. Oxygen- and nitrogen-terminated diamond are commonly employed as well for further functionalization via silanization, esterification or amidation reactions.18 Moreover, the functionalization of diamond is not limited to (bio)molecules, but larger macromolecular structures, including polymers, have also been successfully grafted onto the surface.
In this review we thoroughly discuss the surface chemistry of diamond thin films, while a recent book chapter by A. Krueger specifically deals with nanodiamonds.19 A complete and up to date overview of the different techniques employed for surface termination, functionalization and polymerization is provided. In contrast with a previous review from 2014,16 which focuses on the biological applications of functionalized diamond, we have paid special attention to the photoelectrochemical applications of these functional surfaces. This includes its application in p-type DSSCs and emerging photocatalytic applications such as CO2 reduction, ammonia synthesis, and water splitting.

2. Diamond Surface Chemistry
2.1.
Surface Termination Under typical CVD growth conditions, the employed hydrogen gas plays an important role. It not only allows the synthesis of diamond through the generation of radicals on both the hydrocarbon source and the monocrystalline or nanodiamond substrate, it also etches away sp2-hybridized carbon (graphite) at a much higher rate than it does for sp3-hybridized carbon (diamond), resulting in high quality diamond films. The employed hydrogen gas stabilizes the dangling bonds at the diamond surface, resulting in H-termination. This H-termination gives rise to some of diamonds unique properties, such as its high chemical inertness, large potential window and negative electron affinity (NEA), which results in a p-type surface conductivity after surface transfer doping, even in undoped diamond films.20 Although H-terminated diamond has a high stability and hence a low surface reactivity, the H-termination will gradually deteriorate when used repeatedly in an electrochemical setup or exposed to air for a prolonged period of time. The most convenient ways of restoring this hydrogen surface termination is by subjecting diamond to a hydrogen plasma or performing an electrochemical cathodic treatment.21, 22 The latter method has the advantage of being non- destructive, which can be advantageous when ultra-nanocrystalline diamond (UNCD)  having a higher sp2-carbon content that would be etched away by a hydrogen plasma  is being employed.23 Also, it has been demonstrated that plasma treatment can lead to microscopic inhomogenities in the form of non-diamond carbon of 1 nm thickness at the surface.24 Recently, Kasahara et al. have elucidated the mechanism for the hydrogenation of diamond electrodes via cathodic treatment and they demonstrated that a faster and more efficient H-termination can be achieved when lower potentials (-5.0 V vs. Ag/AgCl) are applied in strongly acidic electrolyte solutions (pH = 0.9).25 The H-terminated diamond surface can also be deliberately oxidized to form hydroxyl (C-OH),ether (C-O-C), carbonyl (C=O) and carboxylic acid (COOH) functional groups, drastically changing the surface properties. O-terminated diamonds are hydrophilic materials that demonstrate a good biocompatibility.26 The p-type surface conductivity is lost since O-terminated diamond electrodes have a positive electron affinity (PEA). Moreover, due to the possibility of forming H-bonds with other molecules, the electrochemical properties (i.e. electron transfer kinetics and potential window) are altered. Surface oxidation of diamond has been achieved through a variety of techniques,including (i) thermal oxidation,27-29 (ii) hot filament cracking to produce O2•,30 (iii) reaction of Cl- terminated diamond with H2O,31 (iv) chemical treatment by boiling in sulfochromic acid or piranha,32,33 (v) oxygen plasma treatment,34, 35 (vi) photochemical oxidation,36, 37 (vii) UV-ozone treatment,33, 38, 39 and (viii) anodic electrochemical polarization.40-42 The various approaches result in different surface compositions, which have been extensively studied by Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and high-resolution electron loss spectroscopy (HREELS).
Oxidation with thermally activated oxygen results in surfaces that mainly contain C-OH and C=O groups in the early stages, whereas fully oxidized surfaces are dominated by C-O-C groups.28, 30 Thermal treatment is also beneficial for the quality of diamond as this reduces the quantity of non- diamond carbon in thin films.43 However, heating above 600 C leads to surface defects.44 For samples treated with UV/ozone, a similar trend in the surface termination was observed, with C-OH groups dominating for short treatments while longer treatments result in a high amount of C-O-C groups.  Oxygen plasma on the other hand is an extremely fast technique and after only 2 minutes,the surface is completely covered with C-O-C groups. The harsh conditions employed for plasma treatment also lead to a certain amount of undesired graphitization.40, 45 Analysis of diamond electrodes oxidized through anodic electrochemical polarization provided somewhat contradicting Page 4 of 53 Journal of Materials Chemistry C Journal of Materials Chemistry C Accepted Manuscript Published on 08 August 2019.

5 results. Notsu et al. demonstrated that after applying a constant potential of 2.4 V vs. Ag/AgCl in 0.1 M KOH for 1 hour, the majority of the oxygen groups were C=O species,40, 46 which was later supported by HREELS measurements.44 Conversely, Wang et al. reported that electrochemically oxidized surfaces contain high amounts of C-OH functionalities, which they confirmed through esterification of the surface alcohol groups with trifluoroacetic acid.47 These results were rationalized by the fact that high amounts of OH radicals are formed near the diamond surface during the electrochemical treatment. More recently, the importance of the employed potential during the anodic polarization was pointed out. Electrochemical oxidation occurs starting from potentials higher than 1.6 V vs. Ag/Ag2SO4, with primarily C-OH functionalities being formed. Formation of C=O and C- O-C only happens at higher potentials above 2.1 V (Figure 1),48 which explains the difference between previous results. A similar dependence on the employed potential was also observed by Nakamura and co.49 Generally, it can be stated that for the discussed techniques, except for plasma treatment, the surface oxygen species can be tuned depending on the conditions. It should also be mentioned that there are differences between single crystal and polycrystalline diamond and the local heterogeneities at different doping level play a significant role as well.32, 48 Therefore, it is imperative that the employed conditions and substrate specifications are reported precisely for reproducibility purposes.50 Figure 1  Electrochemical oxidation of boron-doped diamond (BDD) by cycling the potential between -1.8 V and + 0.5, + 1.6 and + 2.5 V vs Ag/Ag2SO4, respectively. At a potential of + 0.5 V, only a small amount of C-OH groups are formed. After the threshold value of 1.6 V, the C-OH concentration increases, together with the formation of carbonyl groups. At potentials above 2.5 V,the majority of surface oxygen species are ether groups. [Reprinted with permission, Copyright (2016) Elsevier]48 Several methods have also been developed to introduce N-termination on diamond since these surfaces proved to be ideal platforms for the attachment of biomolecules such as DNA and peptides.51, 52 Moreover, N-termination can improve quantum-sensing applications by increasing the spin coherence time of nitrogen vacancy (NV) centers.53 N-terminated diamond is hydrophilic and shows exceptional properties with regards to electron affinity. When the surface is covered by primary amine groups (C-NH2), a NEA is obtained.54 However, if more secondary amines (C-NH-C, C=NH) or hydrazine-like (C-NH-NH-C) structures are present, which fully terminate the surface, a PEA is observed.55, 56 N-termination of diamond can be achieved through a two-step procedure by thermal or photochemical amination of Cl-terminated surfaces,31, 57, 58 or directly via photochemical Diamond Electrode Electrochem.

[Reprinted with permission, Copyright (2014-2015) Elsevier]67, 69 S-termination of diamond thin films was first investigated by Nakamura et al. via the photolysis of cyclic disulfides with UV light.72 Analysis of the C1s signal in XPS revealed the formation of two new carbon moieties, i.e. thioethers (C-S-C) and thiols (C-SH). Mechanistically, this means that after photolysis of the cyclic disulfide, one end of the generated radical dithiol grafts itself onto the surface, while the other end remains in contact with the solution, resulting in the formation of a thioalkylthiol layer as shown in Figure 3. To avoid the synthesis of these cyclic disulfides, a similar procedure was employed using elementary sulfur (S8).73, 74 Here, the photolysis of S8 is followed by the grafting of a polythiol (-Sx-) on the surface. Under continuous irradiation, this is further photolysed leading to S-terminated diamond. FTIR and XPS analysis demonstrated that both C-SH and thiocarbonyl groups are present (C=S). The resulting surfaces were then employed for the construction of self-assembled monolayers with gold nanoparticles.

Apart from the conventional H-, O-, N- and the somewhat more exotic S-terminated surfaces,halogenation of diamond has been thoroughly investigated as well and this already starting from
1967.75 Development of F-terminated diamond has received special attention as this drastically
improved the (oxidative) stability at elevated temperatures and the lubrication properties.
Fluorinated BDD electrodes are the only electrode materials to date that have an electrochemical potential window spanning 5 V.76 This can be explained by the low interaction between adsorbed intermediates and the fluorinated electrode as a result of its polar hydrophobicity.77 Termination of the diamond surface with fluorine has been achieved through treating diamond powder or films with molecular fluorine (F2),75 atomic fluorine (F•) beams,78 or plasma treatment with SF6,79, 80 CF4,81-83 or
CHF3.84 However, despite the atomic radius of F (1.4 Å) being only slightly larger than that of H (1.2
Å), a surface termination of only 60% could be obtained.85 Therefore, Smetkowksi et al. developed a novel fluorination strategy through irradiation of perfluorinated butyl iodides (C4F9I) with X-rays.86 This generates the corresponding radical C4F9•, which can attach onto a H-terminated diamond surface. The functionalized surfaces were then heated to 300 K to remove any non-reacted C4F9I,which resulted in a surface fluorine to carbon ratio of 2. Further increasing the temperature up to 800 K led to a thermal decomposition of the diamond-C4F9 interface to one with simple C-F bonds, as shown in Figure 4. This was accompanied by a decrease of the surface F to C ratio to a value of 0.6,which is a similar fluorine coverage as produced by the techniques described above.87 Small variations on the perfluorination of diamond were performed through photolysis of perfluoroalkyl iodides with UV light,88 by employing perfluoroazoalkanes (as they also readily decompose into radicals upon illumination)89, 90 or through electrochemical oxidation of perfluoroalkyl acids.91 Page 7 of 53 Journal of Materials Chemistry C Journal of Materials Chemistry C Accepted Manuscript Published on 08 August 2019.

Figure 4  Diamond surface fluorination by employing molecular fluorine (F2), atomic fluorine (F•) beams, plasma treatment or a perfluorination method.
In addition to fluorine, also Cl-terminated diamond surfaces have been prepared through various methods (Figure 5). Initially, rather harsh and corrosive reaction conditions were employed, e.g. guiding a Cl2 gas stream over diamond powder at 400 C75 or generation of atomic chlorine in a microwave reactor at 300 C.31 A milder route towards chlorination of diamond was first reported by Miller and Brown and employs irradiation of diamond powders or single crystals with a high-pressure Hg arc lamp to photochemically dissociate Cl2.57 There are also some reports on the preparation of Cl-terminated diamond surfaces via two wet-chemical approaches: (i) Heating diamond in a solution of thionyl chloride (SOCl2) and chloroform at 50 C in the presence of azobisisobutyronitrile (AIBN),which serves as a radical initiator;92-94 (ii) Refluxing diamond in a solution of N-chlorosuccinimide (NCS) and tetrachloromethane (CCl4) in the presence of benzoylperoxide as radical initiator.95 Cl- terminated surfaces demonstrated a lower stability compared to F-terminated diamond. Exposure of these chlorinated surfaces to water or air resulted in partial hydrolysis of the C-Cl bonds, which decreased the surface termination from 50% to only 5%.31, 82 Yet, this higher reactivity of the Cl- terminated surfaces can be beneficial as this resulted in one of the first methods to develop NH2- terminated surfaces31, 57, 58 and enables direct functionalization of diamond with pyridinium salts96 and n-, sec- or tert-butyl groups (Figure 5).92, 93 Diamond Electrode

Br-termination of diamond has received much less attention. The first report dates from 1968,wherein a stream of Br2 gas was guided over a diamond powder at 100 C.75 However, only very small amounts of bromine were actually bound to the surface. Similarly, a chemical approach in which diamond was heated in a solution of Br2 and chloroform at 50 C with AIBN as radical initiator resulted in poor Br-termination.92 Wang et al. obtained a Br/C ratio of 0.15 after bromine termination of diamond by refluxing the sample in a mixture of N-bromosuccinimide (NBS) and CCl4.
Afterwards, alkylation was attempted through reaction with the Grignard reagent of 1-bromodecane.
However, again a low grafting density was observed (Figure 5).95 The poor Br-termination is explained by a sterical effect due to the increased size of the atomic radius of bromine compared to chlorine and fluorine.97 Bromine is also a better leaving group, which facilitates hydrolysis of the C-Br Page 8 of 53 Journal of Materials Chemistry C Journal of Materials Chemistry C Accepted Manuscript Published on 08 August 2019.

9 bonds at the surface. Due to its even larger atomic radius, I-termination of diamond has not been reported to date.
2.2.
Surface Functionalization From the above we can conclude that the diamond surface can be readily terminated with hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, sulfur and halogen atoms through a broad range of dry and wet chemical approaches. The different terminations can be employed to directly attach molecules to the diamond surface. However, high loadings are hard to achieve. The stability of certain surface terminations is also questionable. Therefore, it is advisable to first covalently attach linker molecules to the diamond surface that in a subsequent reaction can be employed to immobilize larger molecules. The covalent attachment of these linkers will be discussed in the following paragraphs.
2.2.1. Functionalization of H-terminated Diamond
2.2.1.1. Photochemical Functionalization
Photochemical functionalization techniques have not only been employed to obtain oxygen-,amine- and halogen-terminated diamond, but the formation of actual C-C bonds between organic linker molecules and the surface has been addressed as well. This method, which was first employed for the functionalization of H-terminated Si (Si-H) surfaces, was translated to diamond by Hamers and co. in 2002.98 Practically, H-terminated diamond is covered with a thin layer of liquid alkenes and subsequently irradiated with UV light of 254 nm to form a self-terminating monolayer. The influence of the functionalization time was carefully investigated and after 1.5 hours of UV irradiation, a rough surface was obtained indicating the formation of a sub-monolayer. For longer irradiation times between 10 and 12 hours, the surface roughness decreased and a complete 2D monolayer was obtained. Further increasing the reaction time lead to the formation of a thick 3D multilayer through cross-polymerization via the alkene functionalities.99, 100 The reaction time can eventually be decreased to  4 hours by applying a negative potential during the functionalization. Nevertheless,this does not change the density of the formed monolayers.101 The employed organic molecules typically comprise a terminal alkene and a protected functional moiety that can be utilized for attaching different molecules to the surface. Protection of the functional head group is necessary for functionalization of Si-H surfaces to prevent etching of the topmost layer. Yet, for diamond this is not required due to its intrinsic stability.102 Employing this technique, diamond has been functionalized with a large variety of short and long alkenes bearing (protected) amines,103-109 carboxylic acids,26, 102,110-113 ethers,114, 115 alcohols,116-118 thiols,119, 120 or more exotic functional groups such as perfluorinated alkanes,121 ferrocene,122 pyridine123 and phosphoric acids.124 Nevertheless, the applicability of these alkenes is limited in a sense that they are not allowed to absorb light with wavelengths around 254 nm, as this would interfere with the functionalization mechanism. An overview of the alkenes that have been employed so far is presented in Figure 6. Amines and carboxylic acids are most frequently encountered as these types of surfaces present an ideal platform to design biosensors via attachment of either DNA or proteins via EDC/NHS coupling reactions.114, 125-128 Mixed molecular monolayers can be developed as well. By introducing ethylene glycol functionalized alkenes for example, non-specific binding of proteins can be drastically decreased.129 Patterned surfaces with a resolution of 1 m can also be obtained by employing a mask to shield certain parts of the surface during irradiation.130 The mechanism of the photochemical diamond functionalization has been the subject of several studies, but it was only 8 years after the development of this technique that it was completely Page 9 of 53 Journal of Materials Chemistry C Journal of Materials Chemistry C Accepted Manuscript Published on 08 August 2019.

10 elucidated.101, 104, 131 For a long time it was thought that upon illumination with UV light, electrons were excited from the valence band of H-terminated diamond to its conduction band, and then ejected into the liquid alkene film. However, the electrons are actually directly excited into the liquid and more exactly in the functionalized head group, since alkenes with stronger electron withdrawing groups are grafted more efficiently.129, 132 After electron ejection, a positively charged hole stays behind on the diamond surface, which undergoes a nucleophilic attack by the terminal alkene. The resulting positive charge on the grafted alkane will abstract a proton from diamond which can then undergo a nucleophilic attack by the next alkene molecule. A schematic illustration of this mechanism is depicted in Figure 6.

2.2.1.2. Diazonium Grafting
Besides photochemical functionalization, grafting of aryl diazonium salts can also be employed to construct stable C-C bonds between the diamond surface and aromatic organic molecules. This method was first demonstrated by Swain and co. in 1999 and it holds considerable advantages over the photochemical method.133 Diazonium grafting is mostly performed electrochemically, by submerging a BDD electrode in a solution of the diazonium salt and cycling to negative potentials.134 By doing so, electrons are ejected from the diamond electrode, resulting in the generation of aryl radicals near the surface and their subsequent grafting. This functionalization proceeds very rapidly as the reduction peak decreases drastically after only one cycle, indicating passivation of the Page 10 of 53 Journal of Materials Chemistry C Journal of Materials Chemistry C Accepted Manuscript Published on 08 August 2019.

11 diamond (Figure 7).135 Compared to the photochemical method, diazonium grafting was calculated to form denser and stronger molecular layers due to π-π stacking between the aromatic molecules.136 This was confirmed by atomic force microscopy (AFM) scratching experiments. Removal of a diazonium grafted layer required almost the double amount of force compared to a photochemically functionalized one.128, 137 The delocalization of electrons in these aryl linkers also increases the applicability of diamond electrodes in organic electronics because of the improved charge transfer in fully conjugated systems.138 Patterning is also possible via electrospotting.139 Moreover, a large amount of aryl diazonium salts are commercially available or they can easily be prepared (in situ) from the corresponding amines through diazotization with NaNO2 or tert-butyl nitrite.138, 140-142 Diamond Electrode

Cyclic voltammogram for the electrochemical reduction of an aryl diazonium salt, with a typical sharp reduction peak in the first scan that disappears in subsequent cycles.
Nevertheless, functionalization via electrochemical diazonium grafting also suffers from a few drawbacks. First of all, this strategy requires an electrically conductive substrate, so it is not applicable for undoped diamond. Also, if the reduction potential is set too negative, the aryl radical will be further reduced to the corresponding anion and the grafting efficiency will be limited.143 The biggest disadvantage, however, is the lack of control and strong tendency to form multilayers due to attack of radicals on the already grafted layer.134, 135, 144 Since the amount of generated radicals is directly related to the charge passed through the electrode, controlling the amount of charges could suppress multilayer formation. Indeed, by briefly (a few seconds) applying a constant potential,which is just below the redox potential of the diazonium salt, an actual monolayer of nitrophenyl molecules (0.8 nm) could be formed.145 Increasing the time to 600 seconds resulted in the formation of a thin multilayer (2.1 nm), whereas the cycling potential method gave rise to rather thick layers (7.6 nm).146 A different approach to limit the charge passing through the diamond electrode is lowering the (boron) doping concentration, which was successfully applied to construct a compact monolayer.147 In case of H-terminated diamond, which has a p-type surface conductivity due to its NEA, spontaneous diazonium grafting was demonstrated as well.

12 simply submerging the diamond sample in a solution of the diazonium salt in acetonitrile,148 ionic liquids,149 or an acidic aqueous solution for reaction times up to 2 hours.138 After grafting an initial surface layer, the p-type conductivity is lost, making the reaction self-limiting to a monolayer. This method is extremely simple since no electrochemical setup is required and it has the advantage that intrinsic diamond can be functionalized as well. On the other hand, Leroux et al. demonstrated that employing diazonium salts with bulky functional groups, such as triisopropylsilyl protected ethynyls,could prevent multilayer formation as the ortho position is sterically shielded.150 Decreasing the size of the protecting group from triisopropyl- to triethyl- and trimethylsilyl was used to increase the density of the monolayer.151 A final technique to obtain monolayers is the addition of molecules such as 2,2-diphenylpicrylhydrazyl. Its electro-reduced species controls the formation of reactive aryl radicals through a redox reaction with the corresponding diazonium salt.152 Via this grafting method, be it electrochemical or spontaneous, a broad range of functional groups have been attached on the diamond surface, the majority being nitro moieties. They are easily reduced to amines, which are mostly employed for the development of amperometric sensors through attachment of DNA153-155 or proteins.156, 157 Aryl diazonium salts bearing carboxylic acids,158 azides,159, 160 alkynes,161-163 halogens138, 140, 164 and boronic acids141, 165, 166 are also frequently encountered (Figure 7) since they allow further functionalization via copper(I) azide-alkyne cycloaddition (CuAAC) or Pd-catalyzed cross-coupling reactions. Lastly, some larger conjugated molecules such as anthraquinones,167 ruthenium dyes,168 biphenyls,142, 148, 169 or nanobodies were directly attached to diamond electrodes as well.170
2.2.2. Functionalization of O-terminated Diamond
Application of oxygen-terminated diamond surfaces for further functionalization has also received a considerable amount of attention. Although the various oxidation techniques provide surfaces that comprise alcohol, ether, carbonyl and carboxyl functional groups, the large majority of further functionalization approaches focus on the OH-functionalities on diamond. The most frequently employed protocols involve silanization, esterification and thermal alkylation.
2.2.2.1. Silanization
Initially, silanization of OH-terminated diamond surfaces was merely performed to confirm the presence of the alcohol groups after surface oxidation, as their XPS signal is indistinguishable from that of ethers. This was first demonstrated by Notsu et al. in 2001 by immersing the BDD samples in an ethanol solution containing 2% of (3-aminopropyl)triethoxysilane (APTES) for 2 hours at room temperature.171 Their grafting was confirmed through an increased water contact angle and improved charge transfer kinetics with the [Fe(CN)6]3-/4- redox couple due to attractive electrostatic interaction with the positively charge amine. The amine groups on these APTES layers were also employed to anchor biomolecules via the construction of α-oxo-semicarbazide bonds or a photocleavable o-nitrobenzyl linker, as illustrated in Figure 8.172, 173 Similarly, Boukherroub et al. functionalized a photochemically oxidized diamond surface with perfluorodecyltrichlorosilane (PFDS) to prove the formation of OH moieties.37 Functionalization of diamond nanograss arrays with these PFDS molecules resulted in super hydrophobic surfaces.174 More recently, it was demonstrated that the presence of PFDS molecules strongly suppresses the formation of perchlorate ions during the electrochemical oxidation of organic molecules in NaCl and NaClO3 containing electrolyte solutions.91 Functionalization of diamond with aromatic molecules such as N-(3-trimethoxysilylpropyl)pyrrole (TMPP)175 and p-aminophenyltrimethoxysilane was also performed.36 The lower stability of the Si-O Page 12 of 53 Journal of Materials Chemistry C Journal of Materials Chemistry C Accepted Manuscript Published on 08 August 2019.

Electrochemical impedance spectra show that after irradiation (black) of diamond nanowires functionalized with lysozyme (blue), the Nyquist plot is identical to the one before anchoring of the biomolecules (green). This demonstrates that illumination with light of 365 nm for 20 min is sufficient to completely release all attached molecules.

2.2.2.2. Esterification
Esterification reactions employing the OH-groups on oxidized diamond surfaces can be performed in multiple ways. The most common method involves a direct reaction of the surface alcohol groups with a DCC or EDC/NHS activated carboxylic acid. As such, diamond has been functionalized with biotin,177 pyrene,178 and benzophenone.179 These benzophenone-decorated surfaces allow for some interesting chemistry. They are stable under standard conditions, but upon irradiation with light of 365 nm, a diradical species is generated. These radicals can then react with sterically available C-H bonds to anchor biomolecules while retaining their activity.180 Diamond has also been functionalized with ionic liquids, which allows for a simple modification of the surface properties and mainly the wettability by exchanging the counter ions.181 Reactions with 4-azidobenzoic acids have also been performed and the resulting azide groups were employed for further functionalization via click chemistry, with efficiencies up to 53%.182, 183 A different way to functionalize the diamond surface is to perform an esterification reaction with linkers such as adipoyl chloride or succinic anhydride.184, 185 The resulting carboxylic acid or acid chloride terminated surface then allows for further reactions.
However, for this purpose, the COOH groups which are formed after the oxidation process can also be employed directly.186, 187 Finally, also two techniques were developed for the formation of phosphoester bonds. In the first method, the OH-groups are reacted with phosphorus oxychloride to form a diamond-O-POCl2 interface. Next, zirconoyl chloride is added, resulting in the oxidation to phosphoric acids, which immediately form a coordination bond with the present Zr4+ ions.

14 zirconation step, carboxylic acid bearing molecules can be anchored to the surface, as shown in Figure 9.188 In the other method, phosphoester bonds were formed by submerging an OH-terminated diamond sample in a solution of 6-phosphonohexanoic acid. After evaporation of the solvent, the samples were annealed at 180 C for 20 hours to remove all physisorbed molecules and the procedure was repeated one more time to obtain a good surface coverage.189 Diamond Electrode

2.2.2.3. Thermal Alkylation
The last method that has been applied for functionalization of oxygen-terminated diamond surfaces is thermal alkylation, wherein diamond is heated in a neat solution of octadecene for 3 hours at 200 C.190 AFM scratching confirmed grafting of the alkene molecules. A layer with a thickness of 1.5  0.4 nm was observed, indicating that the octadecyl chains adopt a tilted orientation. H-terminated diamond was proven to be unaffected under these alkylation conditions.
Thus, this technique can be readily employed to develop multifunctional surfaces through a combination of thermal alkylation and photochemical grafting of OH- and H-terminated diamond,respectively.
2.2.3. Functionalization of N-terminated Diamond
Functionalization of N-terminated diamond surfaces is essentially very similar to that of OH- termination. The primary amine groups can be employed to form amide bonds with molecules bearing activated carboxylic acid moieties. Both flexible and more rigid linkers with various reactive groups have been investigated. For example, bifunctional linkers such succinyl chloride and the activated esters of adipic, terephthalic and trimesic acid have been employed to obtain a layer of COOH functional groups on an initially NH2-terminated surface. Subsequently, different biomolecules such as DNA can be attached via EDC/NHS chemistry.58, 59 The advantage of this method over esterification is the improved stability of the interfacial amide bonds toward hydrolysis. Peptide chains and fluorescein dyes were also attached through the formation of an α-oxo-semicarbazide Page 14 of 53 Journal of Materials Chemistry C Journal of Materials Chemistry C Accepted Manuscript Published on 08 August 2019.

15 bond or reaction with sulfosuccinimidyl 4-(N-maleimidomethyl)cyclohexane-1-carboxylate and subsequent Michael-addition.52, 62 Moreover, introduction of alkynes through amide bond formation with 4-pentynoic acid allowed the development of catalyst free thiol-yne reactions on diamond. The success of this method was addressed by coupling of perfluorinated and ferrocene functionalized thiol molecules, as this enables straightforward XPS and electrochemical analysis. Afterwards, DNA was also immobilized for the development of amperometric biosensors.191 Finally, NH2-terminated diamond surfaces can also be directly functionalized without using a linker molecule. However, this might result in a lower surface coverage due to sterical factors.68, 192
2.3.
Surface Polymerization Over the past decades, the discussed functionalization strategies of H-, O- and N-terminated diamond have been employed to covalently attach various (bio)molecules, which resulted in a broad range of applications. However, all these functionalization strategies suffer from the same drawback that only a limited amount of molecules can be attached. Even for diamond electrodes functionalized through electrochemical diazonium grafting, which has the tendency to form multilayers, sterical crowding will prevent a high surface coverage for subsequent coupling reactions. This issue can be overcome by functionalizing the surface with thicker polymer films that bear a multitude of reactive moieties. Typically, functionalization of surfaces with polymers can be performed in two different ways, i.e. via the grafting from and grafting onto strategy. For diamond, only surface initiated polymerizations and direct surface polymerizations, which are two variations on the grafting from approach, have been investigated so far.
2.3.1.
Surface initiated polymerization In the case of surface initiated polymerizations, a macro-initiated surface has to be prepared through functionalization of the diamond surface via conventional grafting procedures. This was first reported by Matrab et al. in 2006 for boron-doped ultrananocrystalline diamond (UNCD) by reaction with 4-(1-bromoethyl)benzenediazonium salts. The bromine groups then serve as an initiator for the atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP) of vinyl monomers such as styrene and methyl methacrylate in the presence of a Cu catalyst and a multidentate amine ligand.193 After polymerization of the poly(styrene) and poly(methyl methacrylate) polymer brushes, XPS analysis showed that a terminal Br group is still present, which is in line with the ATRP mechanism.194 UNCD was also functionalized with non-fouling poly(ethylene glycol) methacrylate polymer brushes via ATRP on an α-bromoisobutyryl functionalized surface.195 In addition to controlled radical polymerizations, polymer-protein bioconjugate systems were developed via the free radical photopolymerization of hydroxyethyl methacrylate on benzophenone-terminated diamond (Figure 10). The resulting OH-groups in the side chains of poly(hydroxyethyl methacrylate) were employed to construct carbamate bonds with bovine serum albumin (BSA), which demonstrates specific interactions with anti-BSA.169 Other than radical polymerizations, Szunerits and co. have investigated the electropolymerization of O-terminated diamond surfaces that have been functionalized with pyrrole and thiophene units.175, 182 Electropolymerization was performed by submerging the functionalized electrodes in an aqueous electrolyte solution and cycling to oxidative potentials. Local polymerization resulting in polypyrrole dots between 1 and 250 m could be obtained via scanning electrochemical microscopy techniques.

2.3.2.
Direct surface polymerization Different from surface initiated polymerizations, direct surface polymerization does not require immobilization of an initiator on the diamond surface. The direct approaches that have been employed include electrochemical polymerization,self-initiated photografting and photopolymerization (SIPGP), and plasma polymerization.
The electropolymerization of BDD thin films with a polyaniline/poly(acrylic acid) copolymer by Gu et al. in 2004 presented the very first report of diamond being covalently functionalized with a polymer.196 This specific copolymer was chosen since poly(acrylic acid) contains COOH groups, which can be used for the attachment of (bio)molecules, and polyaniline is a semiconducting material that improves charge transfer between the anchored molecules and the diamond electrode. Attachment of amino-functionalized single stranded DNA probes via EDC/NHS chemistry led to the development of an impedimetric sensor for DNA hybridization events. The detection limit was as low as 20 nM with a good selectivity between complementary and one-base mismatch targets, without detectable nonspecific interactions.197 Another material that has been intensively studied for electropolymerization on diamond is pyrrole. Thick (25 nm) poly(pyrrole) films are readily obtained on both H- and O-terminated diamond from a 0.24 M aqueous pyrrole solution under galvanostatic conditions.198 Grafting of these poly(pyrrole) chains on nanocrystalline diamond (NCD) significantly changes both the photoluminescence properties and transport behavior of free charge carriers in the bulk diamond.199, 200 Pyrrole has also been polymerized in the presence of analytes such as theophylline and histamine for the development of molecularly imprinted polymers (MIPs) on diamond. After polymerization, these analytes can be removed from the polymer matrix and a cavity remains. In this cavity, however, the orientation of the pyrrole units is ideal for rebinding the analyte molecules, which can be used to develop very specific impedimetric sensors.201, 202 A different kind of impedimetric sensor was developed by modifying diamond nanowires with a poly(3-carboxypyrrole) film. Depending on the charge that is passed through the diamond electrode, a different morphology is obtained. For a low deposition charge of 2 mC cm-2, polymer formation occurs only in between the Page 16 of 53 Journal of Materials Chemistry C Journal of Materials Chemistry C Accepted Manuscript Published on 08 August 2019.

17 nanowires. When a high charge of 23 mC cm-2 is applied, the polymer film becomes too thick and the wire structure is lost. However, only when a moderate deposition charge of 11 mC cm-2 is employed,all nanowires are properly coated. The resulting COOH groups were employed to coordinate with divalent Cu2+ ions, which are further utilized for the binding of histidine-tagged peptides, as shown in Figure 11. The advantage of this functionalization approach is that the sensor is reusable since the complexes are easily disrupted using competing chelators.203 More recently, a hemin integrated poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT) was electropolymerized from a solution containing 1.5 mM hemin and 4.5 mM 3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene. The hemin groups are incorporated in the PEDOT structure via interactions between their carboxylic acid groups and the thiophene units,resulting in a cauliflower structure, which is related to 3D branched multi-globular films. The Fe atoms in these hemin groups allow for the electrochemical oxidation and detection of peroxynitrite with a sensitivity as low as 10 nM.204
Figure 11  Coordination of the carboxylic acid groups from poly(3-carboxypyrrole), which is polymerized on boron-doped nanowires, with Cu2+ at pH values above 6 and subsequent chelation of histidine-tagged peptides. [Reprinted with permission]203 Another way to easily prepare polymer brushes on diamond surfaces is the self-initiated photografting and photopolymerization or SIPGP of alkene-functionalized molecules. The first account of this SIPGP on diamond was reported by Steenackers et al. for the development of poly(styrene) brushes by simply submerging diamond substrates in freshly distilled styrene and irradiating the samples for 16 hours with light of 350 nm.205 Remarkably, no surface polymerization occurred on H-terminated diamond, whereas OH-terminated surfaces afforded 110 nm thick poly(styrene) brushes. This large difference is related to the SIPGP mechanism, where a proton is abstracted from the surface after photosensitization of the monomer. Since the bond dissociation energy for O-H bonds is lower than those of C-H bonds, the difference in surface polymerization behavior can be explained. The grafted poly(styrene) layers are extremely stable and vigorous reaction conditions can be employed to perform post-polymerization modifications toward poly(nitrostyrene) and poly(styrene sulfonic acids).  To further increase the structural complexity of the grafted polymers, a bifunctional 2-isoprenyl-2-oxazoline monomer was employed. The isoprenyl groups allow for the SIPGP of polymer brushes that contain oxazoline molecules, which hold the potential to be further polymerized via living cationic ring opening polymerization.206 To do so, an excess of methyl triflate was added to prepare a polycationic macroinitiator. Next, either 2-ethyl-2- Page 17 of 53 Journal of Materials Chemistry C Journal of Materials Chemistry C Accepted Manuscript Published on 08 August 2019.

18 oxazoline or 2-carbazole-2-oxazoline monomers were added to prepare so-called polymer bottle- brush brushes, as shown in Figure 12. Functionalization of these bottle-brush brushes is also possible by terminating the cationic ring opening polymerization with a glycine derivative of which the COOH group can be employed to attach biomolecules such as green fluorescent protein.207 In addition to oxazoline and styrene monomers, different acrylates such as methyl methacrylate, tert-butyl methacrylate and N,N-dimethylaminoethyl methacrylate were grafted on diamond as well via SIPGP.
After hydrolysis of the tert-butyl groups from poly(tert-butyl methacrylate) to poly(methacrylate),green fluorescent protein was attached to the carboxylic acid groups.207 The same functionalization strategy was also utilized to covalently attach cytochrome C and aminomethylferrocene.208 Polymer brush Polymer bo le-brush brushes Polyca onic macroini ator Figure 12  Fabrication of poly(2-oxazoline) bottle-brush brushes on nanocrystalline diamond thin films. a.

3. Photoelectrochemical Applications
3.1.
(Dye-Sensitized) Solar Cells
3.1.1. Diamond-based active layers
Thanks to diamonds extraordinary properties and good (photo)electrochemical behavior, the material has received a considerable amount of attention for its application in photovoltaic devices.
Initial experiments on photocurrent generation using either doped or undoped diamond films were performed by irradiating the surface with monochromatic laser light of various intensities.210, 211 By employing above bandgap light (>5.5 eV), cathodic photocurrents of a few A/cm2 were obtained.
Irradiation with light that has an energy below the bandgap of diamond still resulted in detectable photocurrents. Since this effect was more pronounced for doped electrodes, the observed currents were related to energy states arising from dopants and the presence of graphitic sp2-carbon.212 The influence of the vacuum annealing temperature on the photopotential of undoped diamond electrodes was studied213 and photovoltaic cells were made that comprised an amorphous carbon (a-
C:H) film on top of a heavily doped BDD electrode.214 Since the a-C:H film has a lower bandgap
(between 0.8 and 3.0 eV) than diamond, this layer mainly absorbs visible light, whereas diamond absorbs the UV light. By combining both layers, the photocurrents improved, but remained low (ca. 20 nA/cm2). Next to the conversion of UV light to energy, diamond photovoltaic cells with a p-i structure were also investigated for the generation of photocurrents based on the absorption of α- particles and X-rays.215 From the obtained open-circuit voltage (VOC), short-circuit current density (JSC) and the irradiation input, the conversion efficiencies for α-particles and X-rays were calculated to be
4.5 and 8.2%, respectively. This is lower than the conversion efficiencies for UV light (14%). Diamond
was also proposed as a potential material for the conversion of high energy ions, generated by nuclear reactions, to energy.216 The previously mentioned applications all employ diamond as the absorber material. However,due to its large bandgap, photocurrents remained limited. Nevertheless, the optical transparency,surface inertness and tunable conductivity upon doping also allow to employ diamond in different other functions for photovoltaic applications. For instance, von Huth et al. constructed an inverted p- n heterojunction solar cell wherein diamond was employed as the p-type window layer and CdTe as n-type absorber.217 Good energy level alignment of the valence band of diamond with the valence band of CdTe provided sufficient driving force for charge separation. J-V measurements for this solar cell revealed a VOC of 230 mV, a JSC of 1.54 mA/cm2 and a fill factor (FF) of 0.32 when illuminated with AM 1.0 light. The low VOC and JSC were attributed to transmission losses related to the diamond film and high recombination in the CdTe film. In another application, diamond films were deposited on industrial silicon solar cells, which contributed to the stability of the devices under earth- and space- like illumination conditions (AM 1.0 and AM 0, respectively).218 Intrinsic diamond was also investigated as an alternative for Pt counter electrodes in TiO2 n-type DSSCs.219 The device efficiency of the diamond electrode-DSSCs (0.4%) was approximately 10 times lower as compared to that of the standard device, which was explained by the presence of a high resistance in undoped diamond films. In a similar experiment wherein BDD was used to replace indium tin oxide (ITO) as the electrode material in poly(3-hexylthiophene):[6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (P3HT:PC61BM) bulk heterojunction organic solar cells, a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 0.91% was obtained.220 Again, the obtained values were significantly lower than when applying standard ITO electrodes. In this case, the decreased transparency of BDD and its increased roughness, which hinders electron transitions at the diamond-ZnO interface, were held accountable.

20 In addition to diamond thin films, nanodiamond has also been employed as p-type semiconductor to develop composite materials with fullerene-C60 derivatives and phthalocyanines.221, 222 Adding nanodiamond to the active layer led to improved light absorption and an increase of the interfacial p- n heterojunction area. However, since no efficient pathways are available for charge separation in the donor/acceptor microstructure, strong charge recombination was observed.223 Nanodiamond has also been used as acceptor material in combination with tetrakis(carboxyphenyl)porphyrin (TCPP).224 Herein, a nanodiamond-TCPP supramolecular assembly was made through hydrogen bond formation between diamond and the porphyrin chromophore. The resulting nanoclusters were deposited as a thin film on an ITO electrode and photocurrents of 31 A/cm2 were obtained under 0.1 sun illumination. Finally, blends of nanodiamond and regioregular P3HT were investigated as photoactive material. The obtained photocurrents were about 10 times larger than when TiO2 or ZnO nanoparticles were employed. In addition to the more favorable energy level alignment, a well- structured hexagonal arrangement of the active layer was obtained in the films containing blends with nanodiamond.225, 226
3.1.2. Functionalized diamond electrodes
When the absorption spectrum of diamond is compared with the photon flux density of solar light, which is the highest between 500 and 1500 nm, it is easy to understand that photovoltaics solely based on diamond as active material will always result in inefficient devices. To extend the absorption to the visible and potentially even the near-infrared (NIR) region of the solar spectrum,diamond can be sensitized with light-harvesting molecules through various functionalization strategies. Because of its p-type conductivity, BDD is a promising photocathode material for the development of DSSCs. The hole diffusion coefficient (230 cm2s-1)227 and optical transparency in the region between 300 and 1000 nm compare favorable to NiO, which is currently being employed as photocathode. In addition to this, the possibility to covalently functionalize diamond  resulting in actual C-C bonds between the dyes and the surface  has been demonstrated to be beneficial for the stability at the interface.
The working principle of a p-type DSSC is illustrated in Figure 13. Under illumination, an electron is promoted from the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) of the dye to the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO), leaving behind a positively charged hole in the ground state.
For efficient photocurrent generation to occur, these charges need to be transported to the respective electrodes. The electron is first transferred to a redox electrolyte, which can diffuse to the counter electrode, whereas the positively charged hole is injected into the valence band of diamond.
To minimize charge recombination, a good energy level alignment is required. Hence, the HOMO of the dye should be below the valence band maximum (VBM) of diamond (ca. -5.5 eV when in contact with an electrolyte solution), while the LUMO of the dye should be located above the redox potential of the employed electrolyte. However, the differences between the energy levels cannot be too large either as this will result in voltage drops. In the following paragraphs, the functionalization of diamond with metal-complex, donor-acceptor and some less conventional chromophores is discussed.

21 Figure 13  Schematic representation of the working mechanism of p-type dye-sensitized solar cells.
3.1.2.1. Metal-complex chromophores
Pioneering work on dye sensitization of p-type semiconductive diamond was performed by Fujishima and co. in 1999.228 In their first report, diamond was not yet covalently functionalized. A BDD working electrode was simply submerged in an electrolyte solution containing 0.1 M tetra-n- butylammonium perchlorate (TBAP) and 0.1 mM tris(bipyridine)ruthenium(II) (Ru(bpy)32+) (Figure 14a). Two diamond electrodes with different doping levels, showing acceptor densities of Na = 1017 and 1019 cm-3, were investigated under illumination with 400600 nm light from a 150 W Xe arc lamp. Larger photocurrents (100 nA cm-2) were obtained for low acceptor density electrodes than for those with a higher density of acceptor states (12 nA cm-2) at an applied bias of -1.0 V. An explanation for this observation was found in the thickness of the space charge layer. In case of the more highly doped diamond, the strongly decreased size of this space charge layer hindered effective charge separation.
As mentioned above, good energy level alignment for the HOMO and LUMO of the dye with the valence band of diamond and the redox potential of the electrolyte are essential for the conversion of solar light into energy. Himpsel and coworkers studied the position of the energy levels for a bis(terpyridine)ruthenium(II) (Ru(tpy)2) dye that was covalently attached to a diamond electrode.229 First, H-terminated diamond was functionalized with undecanol through photochemical grafting of 1- undecen-11-ol. The alcohol moiety was subsequently converted to an azide, that was employed to attach an alkynylated Ru(tpy)2 complex via CuAAC chemistry (Figure 14b).116 Information on the position of the HOMO of the Ru dye was obtained through ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy Page 21 of 53 Journal of Materials Chemistry C Journal of Materials Chemistry C Accepted Manuscript Published on 08 August 2019.

22 (UPS), while the position of the LUMO was determined via near edge x-ray absorption fine structure (NEXAFS) spectroscopy. The HOMO of surface attached Ru(tpy)2 was found to be 0.9 eV below the VBM of diamond. This large energy difference will surely result in a fast hole injection and regeneration of the dye. However, the voltage drop of 0.9 eV would lead to large losses in efficiency.
Hence, no photochemical measurements were performed for these electrodes.
