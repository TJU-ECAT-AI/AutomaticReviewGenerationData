1. Deactivation mechanisms, regeneration strategies, and performance optimization of metal oxide catalysts (Cr-based and VOx) in oxidative dehydrogenation processes, with emphasis on coke mitigation and CO2 utilization

The deactivation mechanisms of metal oxide catalysts, particularly Cr-based and VOx catalysts, in oxidative dehydrogenation processes are multifaceted and complex \[10.1002/cctc.201200397, 10.1016/S0920-5861(03)00268-2, 10.1039/C5CY00998G\]. CrOx/silica catalysts, for instance, suffer from rapid deactivation due to coke deposition and the reduction of CrOx, which converts the coordinatively unsaturated Cr3+ state into the inactive Cr2+ state \[10.1002/cctc.201200397\]. In the case of higher alkanes, the produced alkenes contain allylic hydrogen, which has a lower bond dissociation energy than the starting alkanes, leading to the rapid abstraction of hydrogen and the formation of coke precursors \[10.1016/S0920-5861(03)00268-2\]. VOx/SiO2 catalysts are also rapidly deactivated with increasing VOx content above the theoretical monolayer coverage, with a decrease in selectivity to propylene at the expense of propane cracking reactions \[10.1002/ejic.201701049\].

Regeneration strategies for these catalysts include reoxidation with air, CO2, or O2 \[10.1021/cr5002436, 10.1016/j.jcat.2015.12.015\]. Reoxidation with air or CO2 at high temperatures (550-650 degrees Celsius) is effective in recovering most of the activity and selectivity of Cr-based catalysts \[10.1021/cr5002436\]. For VOx catalysts, the addition of CO2 in the feed gas of C3H8/O2 can mitigate overoxidation by decreasing surface molecular oxygen species and partially reoxidizing VOx catalysts, converting V2O3 to V2O4 \[10.1021/acscatal.0c03999_3\]. However, achieving a complete recovery of active sites is challenging and requires proper preparation methods to ensure well-dispersed Cr species \[10.1021/cr5002436\].

Performance optimization of these catalysts involves mitigating coke formation and utilizing CO2 effectively. The addition of MgO can improve the performance of supported vanadium catalysts by reducing coke formation \[10.1021/cr5002436\]. CO2-assisted propane dehydrogenation results in higher selectivity toward propylene production and a reduction of carbon formation \[10.1016/j.jcat.2015.12.015\]. CO2 addition can mitigate overoxidation in VOx-catalyzed reactions by suppressing the formation of surface carbon and allowing the reaction to proceed via direct oxidative dehydrogenation and non-oxidative dehydrogenation followed by the reverse water gas shift reaction \[10.1016/j.jcat.2015.12.015\].

※※※
Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: The literature reveals a complex interplay between deactivation mechanisms, regeneration strategies, and performance optimization of Cr-based and VOx catalysts in oxidative dehydrogenation processes. Future research endeavors might focus on developing novel catalyst preparation methods that ensure the dispersion of Cr species and the stabilization of VOx species to enhance reoxidation efficiency and selectivity. The role of CO2 in mitigating overoxidation and its potential to facilitate the reverse water gas shift reaction opens up new avenues for catalyst design and process optimization. The exploration of alternative supports, such as MgO, that can reduce coke formation and improve catalyst performance is also a promising direction. Moreover, the integration of in situ spectroscopic techniques with computational methods, such as DFT calculations, can provide deeper insights into the redox mechanisms and the dynamic behavior of these catalysts under reaction conditions. This integrated approach can guide the development of next-generation catalysts with enhanced stability, selectivity, and efficiency in oxidative dehydrogenation processes.
