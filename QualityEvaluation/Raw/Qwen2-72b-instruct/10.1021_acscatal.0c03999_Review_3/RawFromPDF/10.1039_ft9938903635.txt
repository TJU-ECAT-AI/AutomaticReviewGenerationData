Thermal oxidizing treatments o
f
 hydrogenated diamond surfaces have been performed in an O2 
environment. 
Chemisorption of oxygen on diamond surfaces has been investigated by diffuse reflectance Fourier-transform 
infrared (FTIR), temperature-programmed desorption (TPD), 
temperature-programmed reaction (TPR) and ther- 
mogravimetry (TG). Oxidation of the hydrogenated diamond occurred above 300 "C and diamond started to burn 
out above 480 "C in 20% 0,. Diffuse reflectance FTIR spectra indicated that the oxidation gave species contain- 
ing C-0 and C-0-C 
structures on the diamond surface above 300°C. The structures o
f
 the chemisorbed 
species changed with the oxidation temperature. The maximum coverage o
f
 oxygen was obtained between 480 
and 500 "C. TPD spectra o
f
 oxidized diamond indicated that the oxygencontaining species were desorbed as CO 
and CO, above 480°C. This paper deals with the mechanistic considerations for the oxidation o
f
 diamond sur- 
faces. 
Chemisorption on a variety of carbon compounds such as 
graphite, carbon black, carbon fibres, and coal has been 
extensively studied by an array of different spectroscopic 
techniques.'-'* Although diamond is one of the most impor- 
tant and interesting forms of carbonaceous materials, few 
studies have been reported on the oxidation of diamond sur- 
faces. The characterization of chemisorbed species on 
diamond surfaces is of great interest because of its role in the 
stabilization of diamond surface structures and its giving vital 
information for the understanding of chemical vapour depo- 
sition processes. It is also necessary to understand the 
properties of the diamond surface and metal/diamond inter- 
face in applications of semiconducting diamond". " 
because 
the electronic character is affected by the properties of the 
metal/semiconducting diamond interface. 
A number of experimental and theoretical studies of 
diamond surfaces have been carried o ~ t . ' ~ - ' ~  
Significant 
amounts of oxygen are present on both natural surfaces and 
those polished in an aqueous medium." It has been also 
reported that diamond growth is significantly affected by the 
presence of a small amount of oxygen during chemical 
vapour deposition.18-21 
However, no detailed information on 
the reactivity of diamond surfaces towards oxidation have 
been reported. 
Recently Evans has reviewed functional groups at diamond 
We have also reported that carbonyl (C-0), 
lactone [-(C0)O-1, 
carboxylic acid (CO'H) and cyclic 
ether (COC) groups were observed on diamond surfaces by 
FTIR spectro~copy.~~ 
IR absorption spectroscopy is one of 
the most useful methods for studies of the species chemi- 
sorbed on solid  surface^.'-^*'^^^^ Moreover, diamond is opti- 
cally transparent in the IR region except for the frequency 
range where weak two-phonon absorption bands appearsz4 
in contrast with other 'black' carbons. 
In this study, the oxidation of hydrogenated diamond sur- 
faces has been performed in 0
'
 environments. The reacti- 
vities and the mechanisms of the vapour-phase oxidation 
have been investigated. 
Experimental 
Commercially available synthesized and natural diamond 
powder was used. Its specific surface area was 20.3 m2 g-', 
determined with nitrogen at 77 K using a Micrometrics Digi- 
sorb 2600 surface analyser. Before oxidation treatment, the 
diamond powder was fully hydrogenated in a pure hydrogen 
(99.9999%) environment at 900 0C.26 
The oxidation of this 
hydrogenated diamond was performed in a tubular flow 
reactor. The reaction was carried out using O2 (20%) in Ar 
for a range of times at treatment temperatures from 300 to 
1000°C. The temperature of the substrates was measured by 
a thermocouple detector. Diffuse reflectance IR spectra were 
recorded on an FTIR instrument (Bio-Rad, Digilab FTS-45) 
equipped with a cooled MCT detector in the region 4000- 
400 cm-' at a resolution of 2 cm-'. 
256 scans were accumu- 
lated for each spectrum. A KBr standard powder was used 
for the reference spectrum. Diffuse reflectance was converted 
into Kubelka-Munk function unit. 
Thermal desorption spectra were obtained at atmospheric 
pressure using He (99.99%) as a carrier gas using a quadru- 
pole mass spectrometer combined with a thermobalance. A 
sampling valve interfaced the atmospheric-pressure gas to the 
ultra-high-vacuum system, which contained the mass spec- 
trometer and was pumped by a turbomolecular pump. Two 
computers allowed simultaneous observation of multiple 
masses and the thermocouple signal. TPD was carried out 
from room temperature to 1000°C at a heating rate of 20°C 
min-'. TPR was carried out in an O2 
(1.0%)-He flow from 
room temperature to 1000°C at a heating rate of 20°C 
min-'. 
A double monochromator (SPEX model 1403) 
equipped with a photomultiplier was used for laser Raman 
spectroscopic measurements. The excitation beam was the 
514.5 nm line of an argon-ion laser. The incident laser power 
was ca. 50 mW. The Raman spectra were obtained in the 
back-scattering geometry.

min. There was no spectral change for temperatures below 
310°C. After oxidation above 310"C, the bands of C-H 
stretching vibrations decreased in intensity with increasing 
oxidation temperature. No significant C-H stretching vibra- 
tions remained for oxidation above 410 "C. This indicates 
that elimination of hydrogen by O2 
was complete at around 
410°C. No peak due to aromatic C-H stretching vibrations 
of sp2 hybridized bonding was observed in the region 3000- 
3200 cm- ' 
during all oxidation experiments. Oxidation did 
not induce formation of aromatics on the diamond surface 
under the present conditions. Laser Raman spectra of the 
treated diamond showed no significant peak in the region 
1500-1600 cm-'. This also indicates that no graphitic or 
non-diamond phase was produced on the diamond surface. 
C-0-C 
and C-0 Stretching Vibrutions 
New bands centred at 1106, 1264, 1444, 1718 and 1766 cm-' 
were observed above 330°C [Fig. 2(c)]. The bands centred at 
1106 and 1264 cm-' were assigned to C-0-C 
stretching 
vibrations ( v ~ - ~ )  
of cyclic ether or cyclic ester. The doublet 
band at 1650-1850 cm-' was assigned to C-0 stretching 
vibrations ( v ~ = ~ )  
of a cyclic ketone, lactone or carboxylic 
anhydride structure. Two maxima at 1710 and 1770 cm-' 
appeared at the oxidation temperature of 330°C. The two 
maxima associated with C-O stretching vibrations increased 
in intensity and shifted to a higher-wavenumber region with 
increasing treatment temperature. The lower-wavenumber 
peak was more intense than the higher-wavenumber peak 
below 410°C (Fig. 2), but the higher-wavenumber peak was 
dominant at high temperature (Fig. 3). The maximum was 
shifted to 1820 cm-' at the treatment temperature of 480°C. 
The peak shift returned to 1806cm-' at 500°C. This suggests 
that oxygenation was complete at 480 "C 
and decomposition 
of oxygen chemisorbed structures occurred above 480 "C. 
Surface oxidation at 480°C gave a 0.7% 
increase in weight. 
In the case of the diamond crystal surface, the population of 
carbon atoms is 30.2 x 
mol m-2 on the (111) surface 
and 26.1 x 
mol m-2 on the (100) surface). As the 
diamond powder used in this study had a surface area of CU.

desorption may occur at high temperatures, the ideal calcu- 
lated weight gain was not obtained. However, this result sug- 
gests that almost all carbon atoms of the diamond surfaces 
were covered with oxygen atoms at a 77-88% coverage by 
oxidation in 20% 0, at 480°C. 
We now consider the C=O stretching vibration bands: 
Cyclic ketone structures correspond to relatively low fre- 
quencies (1700-1800 cm- '), carboxylic anhydride structures 
correspond to relatively high frequencies ( > 
1800 cm- ') and 
lactone structures give bands between those of the cyclic 
ketone and carboxylic anhydride structures in this region. 
The spectral change of the C=O stretching vibrations sug- 
gests that cyclic ketone (-CO-) 
structures formed at a rela- 
tively 
lower 
temperature 
and 
changed 
to 
lactone 
[-(C0)O-] 
structures and furthermore to carboxylic anhy- 
dride [CO(O)CO] structures with increasing oxidation tem- 
perature (Fig. 3). 
The band in the region 1360-1500 cm-', which had a 
maximum at 1444 cm-', also grew with increasing oxidation 
temperature. The correct assignment of this band at 1444 
cm-' is still open to debate, although we suppose that it is 
due to oxygen-containing species. Meldrum and Rochester 
reported the study of the surface oxidation of activated 
carbon., Their spectra show bands at CQ. 1434 cm-' in the 
spectrum of carbon positioned similarly to those in this 
study. They reported that the band at ca. 1434 cm-' was 
ascribed to aromatic C- H vibrations. Zawadzki also report- 
ed that the band at 1400-1475 cm-' was attributed to the 
aromatic ring absorption in the studies of various carbon- 
aceous materials.' However, in the present study, the exis- 
tence of the aromatic groups would be improbable since 
there was no corresponding C-H 
peak in the 3000-3200 
cm- ' 
region. The laser Raman spectra likewise indicated the 
absence of aromatic ring mentioned above. Zawadzki indi- 
cated that another plausible assignment of the band in the 
1400-1475 cm-' region could be to ionic carbonate struc- 
tures.' 
Fig. 4 shows the changes of the integrated peak intensities 
of the C-H 
stretching vibrations and the C-0 
stretching 
vibrations. The total of these C-H 
peak intensities was 
reduced by raising the oxidation temperature and reached 
near zero at 400°C. It is obvious that the elimination of 
hydrogen occurred in the range 310-380°C. The amount of 
C-0 peak intensities, integrated from 1630 to 1880 cm-', 
gradually increased with increasing oxidation temperature up 
to 480°C. The increase in formation of the C-0 containing 
group was enhanced above 400°C. While both dehydroge-

nation and oxygenation proceeded concurrently below 
400 "C, oxygenation progressed exclusively in the range 400- 
480°C. The maximum chemisorption of oxygen onto the 
diamond surface was obtained in the oxidation between 480 
and 500°C. 
Hydrolysis of the Oxidized Diamond Surface 
Oxidized diamond at 500°C in 20% 0, was treated in 0.1 
mol dm-3 NaOH at 90°C 
for 60 
min to confirm the presence 
of the carboxylic anhydride structures. After treatment in the 
NaOH solution, the sample was thoroughly washed with dis- 
tilled water. The peak at 1806 cm-' was shifted to 1775 
cm-' and a new peak appeared at 1640 cm-' 
in the C-0 
stretching region [Fig. 5(b)]. 
The new peak at 1640 cm-' is 
ascribed to the C-0 stretching vibration and/or the 0-H 
bending vibration (6, - 
H
)
 
of carboxylic acid structures. Simul- 
taneously, a new peak appeared at 3710 cm-' in the 0 - H  
stretching region ( v , - ~ )  [Fig. 5(b)]. 
This spectral change indi- 
cated that the carboxylic acid (C0,H) structure was produc- 
ed. In addition, the band at 1288 cm-' 
in the C-0-C 
stretching region was reduced in intensity. The reduction of 
the bands at 1806 and 1288 cm-' indicated that the concen- 
tration of the carboxylic anhydride structure had decreased. 
Two bands at around 1444 and 1073 cm-' scarcely changed.

This indicates that the carboxylic anhydride structure on the 
oxidized diamond was hydrolysed to form the carboxylic 
acid 
structure. 
Thermal Decomposition of the Oxidized Diamond Surface 
Diamond oxidized at 500°C was treated in an Ar (99.999%) 
environment above 500°C (Fig. 6). While the bands at 1444 
and 1288 cm- ' 
reduced in intensity at the same temperature 
in the absence of 0, [Fig. qb)], the bands at 1806 and 1073 
cm-' 
hardly changed. Species, which gave the bands at 1444 
and 1288 cm-', were desorbed at a relatively low tem- 
perature. This result may suggest that the band at 1444 cm-' 
was due to the carbonate structure. 
The band due to C-0 stretching vibrations also reduced 
in intensity and the peak shifted to lower wavenumbers with 
increasing treatment temperature. At 700"C, the peak posi- 
tion was shifted to 1750 cm-' [Fig. 6(f)]. No significant IR 
peak was observed above 800"C, whereas the laser Raman 
spectra indicated a small broad peak from 1500-1600 cm-'. 
The carboxylic anhydride structures were decomposed first, 
lactone structures were decomposed successively and ketone 
structures remained up to 800 "C. 
TPD 
TPD mass spectra of diamond powder, which was oxidized 
at 480°C in 20% 0, 
for 20 min, are shown in Fig. 7. TPD 
was carried out by raising the diamond temperature at 20°C 
min-' in an He (200 ml min-') flow at ambient pressure, to 
a final temperature of 1OOO"C. Very little desorption was 
observed below 480 "C. Physical desorption of water 
occurred from room temperature to 200°C. When TPD 
experiments were carried out immediately after oxidation, no 
desorption of water was detected. The main desorption pro- 
ducts from oxidized diamond surfaces were CO and CO,.

a large peak at 610°C and a small peak at 790°C. CO was 
desorbed from 600 to 920°C. The main desorption peak of 
CO was observed at 690°C and a broad tail continued to 
920°C. This indicates that little desorption took place with 
increasing temperature above 920 "C. No desorption of 0, 
was detected from room temperature to lo00 "C. 
The simultaneous results of TG and DTA during TPD are 
also presented in Fig. 8. The TG curve shows that a small 
weight loss started from 480°C and a steep weight loss con- 
tinued up to cu. 880°C. This curve indicates that the major 
desorption is complete at ca. 900°C. Close agreement 
between TPD and TG analysis was obtained. 
The total weight loss of chemisorbed species from the 
diamond surface, which was oxidized at 480"C, was cu. 1.5 
wt.%. As mentioned above, the oxidation gave a maximum 
weight gain of CQ. 0.7 wt.% in this oxidation process. Once 
oxygen chemisorbed onto diamond surfaces, oxygen atoms 
can never be desorbed as 
oxygen molecules (0,) 
and it is easy 
for them to be desorbed as CO and CO,. In the case of 
hydrogen desorption, hydrogen chemisorbed on diamond 
surfaces can be desorbed thermally as hydrogen molecules 
(H,) and it is more dificult for it to be desorbed as hydrocar- 
bon molecules such as CH,.26 This point seems to be impor-

tant in considering the mechanism of diamond formation by 
chemical vapour deposition. 
The DTA curve shows a significant exothermic peak at 
around 580°C and a small broad exothermic peak in the 
380-460°C region. When considered with the FTIR and 
TPD mass spectroscopic analyses, this result suggests that 
the oxygenation of diamond surface and the desorption of 
CO, are exothermic processes. 
TPR 
TPR studies were attempted for the oxidation process. TPR 
was carried out by raising the diamond temperature at 20°C 
min-' in an 0, 
(1.0%)-He flow at ambient pressure, to a 
final temperature of 1OOO"C. TPR selected mass us. tem- 
perature plots obtained from hydrogenated diamond powder 
in O2 (1.0%) are presented in Fig. 9. Oxygen started to be 
used up at ca. 400 "C and decreased rapidly above ca. 500 "C. 
A significant amount of water was observed from 400 to 
680 "C. The elimination of hydrogen occurred during oxidia- 
tion at a relatively low temperature to produce water simul- 
taneously. Above 550"C, CO, and CO were desorbed 
significantly and diamond burned off. 
The TG curve obtained during TPR showed a small 
weight gain from 400 to 500°C and then the weight gradually 
reduced with increasing temperature (Fig. 10). Above 560 "C, 
a steep and continuous weight loss took place. The DTA 
curve shows two exothermic peaks in the 400-500°C region 
and in the 550-800°C region. The former peak was due to 
the oxygenation of the diamond surface and the latter was 
due to the decomposition and/or combustion of diamond. 
According to the TPD analysis above, it is believed that the 
desorption of CO, is the main exothermic process. 
Mechanism of the Oxidation of Hydrogenated Diamond 
Surfaces 
No reaction occurred below 300°C in an 0, environment. In 
other words, the hydrogenated diamond surfaces are entirely 
stable in air below 300 "C.

We propose that the oxidation of a hydrogenated diamond 
surface can be divided into three major stages as follows: (A) 
dehydrogenation (in the region 300-380 "C), (B) oxygenation 
(in the region 380-480 "C), (C) continuous oxidation with 
desorption, i.e. combustion (above 500 "C). 
First the dehydrogenation proceeded via oxygen molecules 
and the dissociative adsorption of these on the diamond 
surface formed the C-0-C 
[Scheme l(b)] and the C-0 
containing structures above 300 "C [Scheme l(c)]. Whilst 
hydrogen was not desorbed thermally below 800°C in Ar, He 
and/or vacuum conditions,26 the presence of oxygen mol- 
ecules induced the dehydrogenation and produced water 
molecules above 300 "C. 
Secondly, after dehydrogenation, further adsorption of 
oxygen continued and the oxidized surface structure changed 
gradually up to ca. 480°C. With increasing oxygen coverage, 
both the ether structure [Scheme 2(b)] and the ketone struc- 
ture [Scheme 2(c)] changed into the lactone structure 
[Scheme 2(4] and further to the carboxylic anhydride struc- 
ture [Scheme 2(e)] in the temperature range 380-480°C. At

Scheme 3 Desorption process (C) 
480"C, the diamond surface can be covered with bound 
oxygen atom and be hydrogen-free. 
Finally, above 480 "C, decomposition of the oxygen- 
containing structures caused desorption of CO, molecules. 
CO, was desorbed in the range 480-600°C and the surface 
structure again changed into the lacton [Scheme 3(6)] and/or 
the ketone structures [Scheme 3(f)]. The lactone structure 
further decomposed to give CO,. The ketone structure 
remained above 600°C and was decomposed to give CO 
between 600 and 800°C [Scheme 3(f)]. These decomposi- 
tions of chemisorbed structures were exothermic. If oxygen 
molecules were present above 480 "C, the diamond surface 
would be continuously oxidized and consequently would also 
burn off. 
Conclusion 
Diffuse reflectance FTIR, TPD, TPR and TG analysis gave 
detailed information on the vapour-phase oxidation of 
hydrogenated diamond surfaces. Diffuse reflectance infrared 
spectra of oxidized diamond exhibited absorption bands due 
to the C-0-C 
and the C=O groups and indicated the 
presence of the cyclic ether, the cyclic ketone, the lactone and 
the carboxylic anhydride structures. The IR spectral changes 
corresponded to changes of the surface structures induced by 
raising the oxidation temperature. Dehydrogenation and oxi- 
dation of the diamond surface occurred in a relatively low 
temperature range ( < 
380 "C). Further oxidation and struc- 
tural changes occurred in the intermediate temperature range 
(380-480 "C) used. Both oxygenation and desorption of 
oxygen-containing species occurred at the same time in the 
higher temperature range (> 
480 "C). This study has eluci- 
dated the structural changes of the species chemisorbed on 
diamond surfaces during the oxidation. The reactivity for the 
vapour-phase oxidation of hydrogenated diamond surfaces 
and the mechanisms of the oxidation process have been dis- 
cussed.
