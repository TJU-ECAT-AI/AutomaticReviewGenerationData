[1] "Despite the excellent performance of Pt and CrOx catalysts in paraffin dehydrogenation, a number of issues including catalyst poisoning, the high cost of Pt, and environmental concerns associated with the use of Cr have spurred the search for alternatives. Vanadium oxides are known to be active for many hydrocarbon oxidation reactions, including dehydrogenation."
[2] "Prior to reaction, the vanadium in these catalysts is generally present as V5+. However, the reduction of the catalyst by the hydrocarbon feed results in the formation of V4+ and V3+."
[3] "Initially, deactivation is caused by the strong adsorption of reactants on the active sites and to a lesser extent to coke deposition. When the coke is removed through the calcination of the catalyst, the latter may deactivate further as vanadium oxide species sinter and form larger V2O5 crystallites or mixed oxides such as AlVO4, both of which are less active."
[4] "V2O5 crystallites can revert to active polymeric vanadium species by treating the catalyst under an oxygen atmosphere at 600 C."
[5] "In several studies, CO2 is added to the feed as a mild oxidant to increase alkene yields."
[6] "Different reasons for this beneficial effect of CO2 have been suggested, such as the removal of acid sites that catalyze unwanted side reactions, coke gasification, oxidation of overly reduced vanadium centers, and hydrogen removal by the reverse watergas shift reaction."
[7] "CO2, being a much milder oxidant, can effectively consume H2 under dehydrogenation conditions, although it is not reactive enough to oxidize the hydrocarbons in the reaction mixture. However, much less heat is formed when CO2 is used, so the dehydrogenation reaction remains endothermic (H2 + CO2  H2O + CO (ΔH2980 = 41 kJ mol1)), as the RWGS does not provide enough heat to compensate for the highly endothermic dehydrogenation reaction. The cofeeding of CO2 may result in additional coke deposition, due to the increased CO and decreased H2 partial pressures brought about by the reverse watergas shift reaction."
[8] "On the other hand, coke may be gasified by CO2."

1.金属氧化物催化剂失活的主要原因，重点关注Cr基和VOx催化剂，在氧化脱氢过程中包括催化剂中毒、Pt成本高、Cr使用环境问题、反应物在活性位点的强烈吸附和焦炭沉积。催化剂被烃类进料还原导致V4+和V3+的形成，这可能导致失活。当通过催化剂的煅烧去除焦炭时，后者可能进一步失活，因为钒氧化物物种烧结并形成更大的V2O5晶体或如AlVO4的混合氧化物，两者都活性较低。V2O5晶体可以通过在600 C的氧气气氛下处理催化剂转化为活性多聚钒物种。在一些研究中，CO2被添加到进料中作为温和的氧化剂以增加烯烃产量。对CO2这种有益效果的不同原因已被提出，例如去除催化不希望的副反应的酸性位点、焦炭气化、过度还原的钒中心的氧化以及通过逆水煤气变换反应去除氢气。然而，CO2的共进料可能会导致额外的焦炭沉积，这是由于逆水煤气变换反应导致的CO增加和H2分压降低。另一方面，焦炭可以通过CO2气化。

The effectiveness of various regeneration methods, such as reoxidation with air, CO2, or O2, varies. Reoxidation with air or O2 can be effective in regenerating the catalyst, but it may also lead to further deactivation due to sintering and the formation of inactive species. CO2 addition can mitigate overoxidation in VOx-catalyzed reactions by preventing the growth of carbides and increasing the oxophilicity of the catalyst. However, hydrogen addition, while preventing coke formation and increasing conversion, may competitively adsorb on the active sites of the catalyst.

However, it is known that Cr-based catalysts deactivate due to the deposition of coke, which requires periodic regeneration. Regeneration methods such as reoxidation with air, CO2, or O2 are effective in removing coke deposits, but the high temperatures required for regeneration can lead to the incorporation of chromia into the alumina framework, resulting in a loss of catalytic activity. The effectiveness of regeneration methods depends on the specific catalyst and reaction conditions. CO2 addition can mitigate overoxidation in VOx-catalyzed reactions by selectively oxidizing hydrogen, shifting the equilibrium towards product formation without oxidizing the catalytically active Cr3+ species to inactive Cr5+ or Cr6+ species.

[8] "Harlin et al. studied the effects of vanadium oxide reduction with H2, CO, and CH4 prior to the dehydrogenation reaction. In all cases, the reduction was incomplete, and yielded a mix of vanadium oxide species, including V3+, V4+, and V5+."
[9] "The authors suggested that when the catalyst was reduced with H2 and CH4, detrimental OH groups were formed."

[17] "According to these workers, the increase in dehydrogenation selectivity stems from the basic nature of MgO, resulting in reduced coke formation."
[18] "MoO3 catalysts deactivate rapidly due to coking and generally afford a relatively low conversion and selectivity."
[19] "The formation of molybdenum oxycarbides (MoOxCy) has been reported to occur during butane dehydrogenation on unsupported molybdenum oxide."
[20] "To improve the stability of the oxide, steam can be added to the feed (which hampers the growth of these carbides) or the catalyst can be doped with vanadium (which increases the oxophilicity of the catalyst)."
[21] "Hydrogen addition prevents coke formation and increases conversion, albeit it is believed that H2 competitively adsorbs on the active sites of the catalyst."
[22] "Consistent with the fact that MoOxCy is a catalyst active in butane dehydrogenation, Harlin et al. showed that MoO3 deposited on SiC displays significant catalytic properties when hydrogen and steam are present in the feed."
[23] "As compared to bulk MoO3 and MoO3 supported on SiO2 and Al2O3, higher selectivities and stability are obtained over MoO3/SiC, albeit at the cost of a lower conversion."
[24] "This was explained by the increased reducibility of MoO3/SiC as compared to the MoO3/Al2O3 catalyst."
[25] "The exact nature of the active sites in Ga-based dehydrogenation catalysts is still under debate."
[26] "Akin to Al2O3, Ga2O3 has different polymorphs of which β-Ga2O3 is not only the most stable, but also the most active Ga species in PDH according to some authors."
[27] "Indeed, a heterolytic dissociation reaction mechanism has been proposed where H adsorbs on a Ga+ Lewis acid site and C3H7+ on a neighboring oxygen, although these species can also be adsorbed reversed."
[28] "The assignment of Lewis acid sites as the active species was substantiated by Chen et al., who, by relating the results of NH3-TPD measurements with activity data for different GaxAl10xO15 mixed oxides, showed that a high concentration of Lewis acid groups in the form of coordinatively unsaturated tetrahedral Ga3+ cations is a prerequisite for dehydrogenation activity."
[29] "Studies by Liu et al. regarding propane dehydrogenation on a perfect Ga2O3 (100) surface revealed that the CH bond is activated by a surface oxygen that abstracts an hydrogen from the propane molecule, thus forming a propyl species, which coordinates with a Ga surface site and a hydroxyl group."
[30] "A second hydroxyl group is formed via β-hydrogen elimination, but for these hydroxyl groups to recombine, either as H2O or as H2, a high energy barrier needs to be overcome."
[31] "This barrier is much lower over a gallium hydridehydroxide species, although the formation of the gallium hydride also involves a high energy barrier."
[32] "Murata and co-workers have observed an increase in activity after a prereduction step with hydrogen at 550 C, while a simultaneous increase of Gaδ+H and GaOH sites was observed via NH3 TPD."
[33] "These authors proposed that these sites also form during reaction and may be responsible for the dehydrogenation activity of the silica supported Ga2O3 catalyst."
[34] "A number of studies have shown that the addition of CO2 to the reactant feed improves the olefin yield."
[35] "Nakagawa et al. found that the addition of steam and CO2 decreased coke deposition on a Ga2O3/TiO2 catalyst by the Boudouart reaction, while also assisting ethylene desorption."
[36] "However, other authors claimed that the increase in activity was caused by the reverse watergas shift reaction (RWGS)."
[37] "Additionally, Michorczyk et al. noted that this effect could only be seen at relative low levels of coke deposition."
[38] "It was suggested that CO2 could also poison the basic sites required for the dissociative adsorption of the alkane."
[39] "Additionally, Hensen et al. studied the promoting effect of water with experiments and theory and observed an increase in the conversion of propane by cofeeding water."
[40] "The authors attributed this promoting effect to the formation of partially hydrolyzed gallium species, more specifically, to the formation of binuclear hydroxyl-bridged Ga3+ cations."
[41] "Xu et al. reported that in the absence of an oxidizing agent, the conversion obtained using Ga2O3 supported on ZrO2, Al2O3, and TiO2 was high, medium, and low, respectively, while SiO2 and MgO-supported Ga2O3 were inactive in alkane dehydrogenation."
[42] "The authors proposed the activity to be dependent on the presence of acid sites of medium strength on the catalyst surface."
[43] "However, a different trend was observed when CO2 was present, as conversion was observed to be high on Ga2O3/TiO2 and low on Ga2O3/ZrO2 and Ga2O3/Al2O3."
[44] "This was attributed to the two contrary roles of CO2, which on the one hand removes H2 from the surface of the catalyst by the reverse watergas shift reaction, while on the other hand absorbs strongly on the basic sites of the support."
[45] "Thus, the low conversion observed when zirconia or alumina were employed as the support can be ascribed to the relatively high amount of basic sites on these oxides."
[46] "Notably, the structure of the support is also important, as a mesoporous GaAl mixed oxide exhibited an increased resistance to catalyst coking."

[9] "Relatively weak basic sites on carriers, such as those present on an activated carbon support, facilitate the reverse water gas shift reaction, which lifts the thermodynamic limitation of the reaction and increases alkane conversion."
[10] "When these basic sites are too strong, as is the case on Al2O3 and ZnO2, CO2 irreversibly adsorbs and poisons these sites."
[11] "This increases the acidity of the support, which in turn increases coke formation and lowers selectivity."
[12] "If these basic sites are absent, as in the case of SiO2, no beneficial effects of CO2 are observed."
[13] "Alumina is commonly used as a support for vanadium oxide catalysts, although Sokolov et al. concluded through testing a wide range of Si- and Al-based supports that using silica to dope the alumina support provides beneficial effects on catalyst stability and activity."
[14] "Furthermore, as was shown by Harlin et al., the performance of supported vanadium catalysts can be improved through the addition of MgO, either as a promoter or as a component of a mixed oxide."
[15] "According to these workers, the increase in dehydrogenation selectivity stems from the basic nature of MgO, resulting in reduced coke formation."

1.The primary causes of metal oxide catalyst deactivation, focusing on Cr-based and VOx catalysts, in oxidative dehydrogenation processes include catalyst poisoning, high cost of Pt, environmental concerns associated with the use of Cr, strong adsorption of reactants on the active sites, coke deposition, sintering of vanadium oxide species, and formation of larger V2O5 crystallites or mixed oxides such as AlVO4. Reoxidation with air, CO2, or O2 can be used to regenerate the catalysts. Reoxidation with air or O2 is effective but requires high temperatures, while CO2 addition can mitigate overoxidation in VOx-catalyzed reactions by facilitating the reverse watergas shift reaction, which lifts the thermodynamic limitation of the reaction and increases alkane conversion. However, the effect of CO2 depends strongly on the catalyst support. If the basic sites are too strong, CO2 irreversibly adsorbs and poisons these sites, increasing the acidity of the support, which in turn increases coke formation and lowers selectivity. If these basic sites are absent, no beneficial effects of CO2 are observed. The addition of MgO can improve the performance of supported vanadium catalysts by reducing coke formation.

1.金属氧化物催化剂失活的主要原因，重点关注Cr基和VOx催化剂，在氧化脱氢过程中包括催化剂中毒、Pt成本高、Cr使用环境问题、反应物在活性位点的强烈吸附、焦炭沉积、钒氧化物物种的烧结、形成更大的V2O5晶体或如AlVO4的混合氧化物。空气、CO2或O2的再氧化可以用于再生催化剂。空气或O2的再氧化是有效的，但需要高温，而CO2的添加可以通过促进逆水煤气变换反应来缓解VOx催化反应中的过度氧化，该反应提高了烷烃转化的热力学限制。然而，CO2的效果强烈依赖于催化剂载体。如果碱性位点太强，CO2不可逆地吸附并毒化这些位点，增加了载体的酸性，反过来增加了焦炭形成并降低了选择性。如果这些碱性位点不存在，则不会观察到CO2的有益效果。MgO的添加可以改善支撑的钒催化剂的性能，通过减少焦炭形成。

1.The primary causes of metal oxide catalyst deactivation, focusing on Cr-based and VOx catalysts, in oxidative dehydrogenation processes are not explicitly mentioned in the provided literature. However, it is known that Cr-based catalysts deactivate due to coke deposition and the incorporation of Cr3+ into the alumina framework during regeneration, leading to a decrease in the amount of catalytically active Cr species. Regeneration methods such as reoxidation with air, CO2, or O2 are effective in removing coke deposits and restoring activity, but the impact on catalytic performance and the potential of CO2 addition for mitigating overoxidation in VOx-catalyzed reactions are not discussed in the literature.

1.在氧化脱氢过程中，Cr基和VOx催化剂失活的主要原因在提供的文献中没有明确提及。然而，已知Cr基催化剂在再生过程中由于焦炭沉积和Cr3+在氧化铝框架中的掺入而失活，导致催化活性Cr物种的数量减少。空气、CO2或O2的再氧化等再生方法在去除焦炭沉积物和恢复活性方面是有效的，但对催化性能的影响以及CO2添加在VOx催化反应中防止过度氧化的潜力在文献中没有讨论。
