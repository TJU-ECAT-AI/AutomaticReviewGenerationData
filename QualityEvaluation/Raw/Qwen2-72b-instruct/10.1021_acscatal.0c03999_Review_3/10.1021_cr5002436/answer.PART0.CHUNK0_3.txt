1.The primary causes of metal oxide catalyst deactivation, focusing on Cr-based and VOx catalysts, in oxidative dehydrogenation processes are not explicitly mentioned in the provided literature. However, it is known that Cr-based catalysts deactivate due to the deposition of coke, which requires periodic regeneration. Regeneration methods such as reoxidation with air, CO2, or O2 are effective in removing coke deposits, but the high temperatures required for regeneration can lead to the incorporation of chromia into the alumina framework, resulting in a decrease in catalytic activity. The effectiveness of these regeneration methods, their temperature requirements, and their impact on catalytic performance are not directly compared in the literature. The potential of CO2 addition for mitigating overoxidation in VOx-catalyzed reactions is not discussed.

1.在氧化脱氢过程中，Cr基和VOx催化剂失活的主要原因在提供的文献中没有明确提及。然而，已知Cr基催化剂由于焦炭沉积而失活，这需要定期再生。通过空气、CO2或O2的再氧化等再生方法在去除焦炭沉积物方面是有效的，但再生所需的高温会导致铬酸盐进入氧化铝框架，导致催化活性下降。这些再生方法的有效性、温度要求及其对催化性能的影响在文献中没有直接比较。CO2添加在VOx催化反应中缓解过度氧化的潜力没有讨论。
