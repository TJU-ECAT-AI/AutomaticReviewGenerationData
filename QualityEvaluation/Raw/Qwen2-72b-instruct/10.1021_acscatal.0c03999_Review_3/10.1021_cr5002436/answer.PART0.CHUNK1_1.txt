[1] "Despite the excellent performance of Pt and CrOx catalysts in paraffin dehydrogenation, a number of issues including catalyst poisoning, the high cost of Pt, and environmental concerns associated with the use of Cr have spurred the search for alternatives."
[2] "The surface area-to-metal loading ratio determines which species will form. Indeed, Wu et al. reported that monomeric species are predominantly present below 1.2 V/nm2, polymeric vanadium species prevail between 1.2 and 4.4 V/nm2, and crystalline V2O5 species preponderate at even higher loadings."
[3] "Initially, deactivation is caused by the strong adsorption of reactants on the active sites and to a lesser extent to coke deposition. When the coke is removed through the calcination of the catalyst, the latter may deactivate further as vanadium oxide species sinter and form larger V2O5 crystallites or mixed oxides such as AlVO4, both of which are less active."
[4] "Prior to reaction, the vanadium in these catalysts is generally present as V5+. However, the reduction of the catalyst by the hydrocarbon feed results in the formation of V4+ and V3+."
[5] "V2O5 crystallites can revert to active polymeric vanadium species by treating the catalyst under an oxygen atmosphere at 600 C."
[6] "In several studies, CO2 is added to the feed as a mild oxidant to increase alkene yields."
[7] "The reducibility of the vanadium species depends on their molecular structure, VOV and VO bonds being more easily reduced than VO-support bonds."
[8] "The formation of molybdenum oxycarbides (MoOxCy) has been reported to occur during butane dehydrogenation on unsupported molybdenum oxide. These materials are also active in the dehydrogenation of paraffins, and a high activity close to the thermodynamic equilibrium is initially obtained, although over a period of a few hours the selectivity drops to zero and the reaction yields only methane, as shown in Figure 23."
[9] "To improve the stability of the oxide, steam can be added to the feed (which hampers the growth of these carbides) or the catalyst can be doped with vanadium (which increases the oxophilicity of the catalyst)."
[10] "Hydrogen addition prevents coke formation and increases conversion, albeit it is believed that H2 competitively adsorbs on the active sites of the catalyst."

1.The primary causes of metal oxide catalyst deactivation in oxidative dehydrogenation processes, focusing on Cr-based and VOx catalysts, include catalyst poisoning, high cost of Pt, environmental concerns associated with the use of Cr, strong adsorption of reactants on the active sites, and coke deposition. The effectiveness of various regeneration methods, such as reoxidation with air, CO2, or O2, varies. Reoxidation with air or O2 can be effective in regenerating the catalyst, but it may also lead to further deactivation due to sintering and the formation of inactive species. CO2 addition can mitigate overoxidation in VOx-catalyzed reactions by preventing the growth of carbides and increasing the oxophilicity of the catalyst. However, hydrogen addition, while preventing coke formation and increasing conversion, may competitively adsorb on the active sites of the catalyst.

1.在氧化脱氢过程中，金属氧化物催化剂失活的主要原因，特别是Cr基和VOx催化剂，包括催化剂中毒、Pt的高成本、Cr使用相关的环境问题、反应物在活性位点的强烈吸附和焦炭沉积。各种再生方法，如用空气、CO2或O2的再氧化，其有效性各不相同。用空气或O2再氧化可能有效地再生催化剂，但也可能导致进一步失活，因为烧结和不活性物种的形成。CO2的添加可以通过防止碳化物的生长和增加催化剂的氧化性来缓解VOx催化反应中的过度氧化。然而，氢气的添加，虽然可以防止焦炭的形成和提高转化率，但可能在催化剂的活性位点上竞争性吸附。
