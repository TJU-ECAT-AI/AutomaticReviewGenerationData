[1] "Despite the excellent performance of Pt and CrOx catalysts in paraffin dehydrogenation, a number of issues including catalyst poisoning, the high cost of Pt, and environmental concerns associated with the use of Cr have spurred the search for alternatives."
[2] "The surface area-to-metal loading ratio determines which species will form. Indeed, Wu et al. reported that monomeric species are predominantly present below 1.2 V/nm2, polymeric vanadium species prevail between 1.2 and 4.4 V/nm2, and crystalline V2O5 species preponderate at even higher loadings."
[3] "Initially, deactivation is caused by the strong adsorption of reactants on the active sites and to a lesser extent to coke deposition. When the coke is removed through the calcination of the catalyst, the latter may deactivate further as vanadium oxide species sinter and form larger V2O5 crystallites or mixed oxides such as AlVO4, both of which are less active."
[4] "Prior to reaction, the vanadium in these catalysts is generally present as V5+. However, the reduction of the catalyst by the hydrocarbon feed results in the formation of V4+ and V3+."
[5] "V2O5 crystallites can revert to active polymeric vanadium species by treating the catalyst under an oxygen atmosphere at 600 C."
[6] "In several studies, CO2 is added to the feed as a mild oxidant to increase alkene yields."
[7] "The reducibility of the vanadium species depends on their molecular structure, VOV and VO bonds being more easily reduced than VO-support bonds."
[8] "Harlin et al. studied the effects of vanadium oxide reduction with H2, CO, and CH4 prior to the dehydrogenation reaction. In all cases, the reduction was incomplete, and yielded a mix of vanadium oxide species, including V3+, V4+, and V5+."
[9] "The authors suggested that when the catalyst was reduced with H2 and CH4, detrimental OH groups were formed."
[10] "V4+ was determined to be the most active species in butane dehydrogenation."
[11] "Ogonowski et al. reported that the effect of CO2 depends strongly on the catalyst support. Relatively weak basic sites on carriers, such as those present on an activated carbon support, facilitate the reverse water gas shift reaction, which lifts the thermodynamic limitation of the reaction and increases alkane conversion."
[12] "When these basic sites are too strong, as is the case on Al2O3 and ZnO2, CO2 irreversibly adsorbs and poisons these sites."
[13] "This increases the acidity of the support, which in turn increases coke formation and lowers selectivity."
[14] "If these basic sites are absent, as in the case of SiO2, no beneficial effects of CO2 are observed."
[15] "Alumina is commonly used as a support for vanadium oxide catalysts, although Sokolov et al. concluded through testing a wide range of Si- and Al-based supports that using silica to dope the alumina support provides beneficial effects on catalyst stability and activity."
[16] "Furthermore, as was shown by Harlin et al., the performance of supported vanadium catalysts can be improved through the addition of MgO, either as a promoter or as a component of a mixed oxide."
[17] "According to these workers, the increase in dehydrogenation selectivity stems from the basic nature of MgO, resulting in reduced coke formation."
[18] "MoO3 catalysts deactivate rapidly due to coking and generally afford a relatively low conversion and selectivity."
[19] "The formation of molybdenum oxycarbides (MoOxCy) has been reported to occur during butane dehydrogenation on unsupported molybdenum oxide."
[20] "To improve the stability of the oxide, steam can be added to the feed (which hampers the growth of these carbides) or the catalyst can be doped with vanadium (which increases the oxophilicity of the catalyst)."
[21] "Hydrogen addition prevents coke formation and increases conversion, albeit it is believed that H2 competitively adsorbs on the active sites of the catalyst."
[22] "Consistent with the fact that MoOxCy is a catalyst active in butane dehydrogenation, Harlin et al. showed that MoO3 deposited on SiC displays significant catalytic properties when hydrogen and steam are present in the feed."
[23] "As compared to bulk MoO3 and MoO3 supported on SiO2 and Al2O3, higher selectivities and stability are obtained over MoO3/SiC, albeit at the cost of a lower conversion."
[24] "This was explained by the increased reducibility of MoO3/SiC as compared to the MoO3/Al2O3 catalyst."
[25] "The exact nature of the active sites in Ga-based dehydrogenation catalysts is still under debate."
[26] "Akin to Al2O3, Ga2O3 has different polymorphs of which β-Ga2O3 is not only the most stable, but also the most active Ga species in PDH according to some authors."
[27] "Indeed, a heterolytic dissociation reaction mechanism has been proposed where H adsorbs on a Ga+ Lewis acid site and C3H7+ on a neighboring oxygen, although these species can also be adsorbed reversed."
[28] "The assignment of Lewis acid sites as the active species was substantiated by Chen et al., who, by relating the results of NH3-TPD measurements with activity data for different GaxAl10xO15 mixed oxides, showed that a high concentration of Lewis acid groups in the form of coordinatively unsaturated tetrahedral Ga3+ cations is a prerequisite for dehydrogenation activity."
[29] "Studies by Liu et al. regarding propane dehydrogenation on a perfect Ga2O3 (100) surface revealed that the CH bond is activated by a surface oxygen that abstracts an hydrogen from the propane molecule, thus forming a propyl species, which coordinates with a Ga surface site and a hydroxyl group."
[30] "A second hydroxyl group is formed via β-hydrogen elimination, but for these hydroxyl groups to recombine, either as H2O or as H2, a high energy barrier needs to be overcome."
[31] "This barrier is much lower over a gallium hydridehydroxide species, although the formation of the gallium hydride also involves a high energy barrier."
[32] "Murata and co-workers have observed an increase in activity after a prereduction step with hydrogen at 550 C, while a simultaneous increase of Gaδ+H and GaOH sites was observed via NH3 TPD."
[33] "These authors proposed that these sites also form during reaction and may be responsible for the dehydrogenation activity of the silica supported Ga2O3 catalyst."
[34] "A number of studies have shown that the addition of CO2 to the reactant feed improves the olefin yield."
[35] "Nakagawa et al. found that the addition of steam and CO2 decreased coke deposition on a Ga2O3/TiO2 catalyst by the Boudouart reaction, while also assisting ethylene desorption."
[36] "However, other authors claimed that the increase in activity was caused by the reverse watergas shift reaction (RWGS)."
[37] "Additionally, Michorczyk et al. noted that this effect could only be seen at relative low levels of coke deposition."
[38] "It was suggested that CO2 could also poison the basic sites required for the dissociative adsorption of the alkane."
[39] "Additionally, Hensen et al. studied the promoting effect of water with experiments and theory and observed an increase in the conversion of propane by cofeeding water."
[40] "The authors attributed this promoting effect to the formation of partially hydrolyzed gallium species, more specifically, to the formation of binuclear hydroxyl-bridged Ga3+ cations."
[41] "Xu et al. reported that in the absence of an oxidizing agent, the conversion obtained using Ga2O3 supported on ZrO2, Al2O3, and TiO2 was high, medium, and low, respectively, while SiO2 and MgO-supported Ga2O3 were inactive in alkane dehydrogenation."
[42] "The authors proposed the activity to be dependent on the presence of acid sites of medium strength on the catalyst surface."
[43] "However, a different trend was observed when CO2 was present, as conversion was observed to be high on Ga2O3/TiO2 and low on Ga2O3/ZrO2 and Ga2O3/Al2O3."
[44] "This was attributed to the two contrary roles of CO2, which on the one hand removes H2 from the surface of the catalyst by the reverse watergas shift reaction, while on the other hand absorbs strongly on the basic sites of the support."
[45] "Thus, the low conversion observed when zirconia or alumina were employed as the support can be ascribed to the relatively high amount of basic sites on these oxides."
[46] "Notably, the structure of the support is also important, as a mesoporous GaAl mixed oxide exhibited an increased resistance to catalyst coking."

1. The primary causes of metal oxide catalyst deactivation in oxidative dehydrogenation processes, focusing on Cr-based and VOx catalysts, include catalyst poisoning, high cost of Pt, environmental concerns associated with the use of Cr, strong adsorption of reactants on active sites, coke deposition, sintering of vanadium oxide species, and formation of inactive mixed oxides. Reoxidation with air, CO2, or O2 can be used to regenerate the catalysts, with CO2 addition potentially mitigating overoxidation in VOx-catalyzed reactions by facilitating the reverse water gas shift reaction, which lifts the thermodynamic limitation of the reaction and increases alkane conversion. However, the effectiveness of regeneration methods depends on the catalyst support, with CO2 having a beneficial effect on activated carbon support but potentially poisoning strong basic sites on Al2O3 and ZnO2, increasing acidity and coke formation, and lowering selectivity. The addition of MgO as a promoter or component of a mixed oxide can improve the performance of supported vanadium catalysts by reducing coke formation.

1. 在氧化脱氢过程中，Cr基和VOx催化剂失活的主要原因包括催化剂中毒、Pt的高成本、Cr使用的环境问题、反应物在活性位点的强烈吸附、焦炭沉积、钒氧化物的烧结以及非活性混合氧化物的形成。可以通过空气、CO2或O2的再氧化来再生催化剂，其中CO2的添加可能通过促进逆水煤气变换反应来缓解VOx催化反应中的过度氧化，该反应提高了烷烃转化的热力学限制并增加了烷烃的转化。然而，再生方法的有效性取决于催化剂载体，CO2对活性炭载体有有益影响，但可能毒化Al2O3和ZnO2上的强碱性位点，增加酸性和焦炭形成，降低选择性。添加MgO作为助剂或混合氧化物的组分可以改善支撑的钒催化剂的性能，减少焦炭形成。
