1.The primary causes of metal oxide catalyst deactivation, focusing on Cr-based and VOx catalysts, in oxidative dehydrogenation processes are not explicitly mentioned in the literature. However, it is known that Cr-based catalysts deactivate due to the deposition of coke, which requires periodic regeneration. Regeneration methods such as reoxidation with air, CO2, or O2 are effective in removing coke deposits, but the high temperatures required for regeneration can lead to the incorporation of chromia into the alumina framework, resulting in a loss of catalytic activity. The effectiveness of regeneration methods depends on the specific catalyst and reaction conditions. CO2 addition can mitigate overoxidation in VOx-catalyzed reactions by selectively oxidizing hydrogen, shifting the equilibrium towards product formation without oxidizing the catalytically active Cr3+ species to inactive Cr5+ or Cr6+ species.

1.金属氧化物催化剂失活的主要原因,特别是Cr基和VOx催化剂,在氧化脱氢过程中,文献中没有明确提及。然而,已知Cr基催化剂由于焦炭沉积而失活,这需要定期再生。通过空气、CO2或O2的再氧化等再生方法在去除焦炭沉积物方面是有效的,但再生所需的高温会导致铬酸盐进入氧化铝框架,导致催化活性的损失。再生方法的有效性取决于特定的催化剂和反应条件。在VOx催化的反应中,CO2的添加可以通过选择性氧化氢,将平衡转移到产物形成,而不将催化活性Cr3+物种氧化为非活性Cr5+或Cr6+物种,从而缓解过度氧化。
