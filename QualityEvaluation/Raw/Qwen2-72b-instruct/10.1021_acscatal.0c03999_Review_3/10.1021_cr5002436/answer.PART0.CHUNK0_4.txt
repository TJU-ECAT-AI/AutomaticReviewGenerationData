1.The primary causes of metal oxide catalyst deactivation, focusing on Cr-based and VOx catalysts, in oxidative dehydrogenation processes are not explicitly mentioned in the provided literature. However, it is known that Cr-based catalysts deactivate due to coke deposition and the incorporation of Cr3+ into the alumina framework during regeneration, leading to a decrease in the amount of catalytically active Cr species. Regeneration methods such as reoxidation with air, CO2, or O2 are effective in removing coke deposits and restoring activity, but the impact on catalytic performance and the potential of CO2 addition for mitigating overoxidation in VOx-catalyzed reactions are not discussed in the literature.

1.在氧化脱氢过程中，Cr基和VOx催化剂失活的主要原因在提供的文献中没有明确提及。然而，已知Cr基催化剂在再生过程中由于焦炭沉积和Cr3+在氧化铝框架中的掺入而失活，导致催化活性Cr物种的数量减少。空气、CO2或O2的再氧化等再生方法在去除焦炭沉积物和恢复活性方面是有效的，但对催化性能的影响以及CO2添加在VOx催化反应中防止过度氧化的潜力在文献中没有讨论。
