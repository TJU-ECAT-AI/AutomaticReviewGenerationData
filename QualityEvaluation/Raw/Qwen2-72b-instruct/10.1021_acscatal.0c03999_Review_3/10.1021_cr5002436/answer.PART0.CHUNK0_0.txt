1.The primary causes of metal oxide catalyst deactivation in oxidative dehydrogenation processes, focusing on Cr-based and VOx catalysts, are not explicitly discussed in the provided literature. However, it is mentioned that Cr-based catalysts deactivate due to the deposition of coke, which requires periodic regeneration. Regeneration methods, such as reoxidation with air, CO2, or O2, are not compared in terms of their effectiveness, temperature requirements, and impact on catalytic performance. The potential of CO2 addition for mitigating overoxidation in VOx-catalyzed reactions is not addressed.

1.在氧化脱氢过程中，金属氧化物催化剂失活的主要原因，特别是Cr基和VOx催化剂，没有在提供的文献中明确讨论。然而，文献中提到Cr基催化剂由于焦炭的沉积而失活，这需要定期再生。再生方法，如用空气、CO2或O2再氧化，在其有效性、温度要求和对催化性能的影响方面没有进行比较。在VOx催化反应中，添加CO2以缓解过度氧化的潜力没有被提及。
