          [1] "Coke deposition and reduction of active sites are major reasons for deactivation of Cr-based catalysts."
          [2] "Regeneration in air or CO2 at high temperatures (i.e., 550650 C) is widely applied, through which most of the activity and selectivity are usually recoverable."
          [3] "By contrast, a complete recovery of active sites is rather challenging yet is still achievable if a proper method is used to prepare well-dispersed Cr species."
          [4] "Adding CO2 in the feed gas of C3H8/O2 is a promising approach, as it enables a decrease of surface molecular oxygen species that account for overoxidation by tuning adsorptiondesorption equilibria on basic oxidizing sites."
          [5] "Results of isothermal reduction confirm that CO2 cannot reoxidize the catalyst completely to V2O5 but is capable of oxidizing V2O3 to V2O4."
          [6] "Redox mechanisms have been proposed on the silsesquioxane cluster with an isolated V5+OV3+ pair via density functional theory (DFT) calculations for the entire reaction network including CO2ODHP, DHP, and RWGS."

          The primary causes of deactivation for Cr-based catalysts in oxidative dehydrogenation processes are coke deposition and the reduction of active sites. Regeneration methods using air or CO2 at high temperatures (550-650 degrees Celsius) are effective in recovering most of the activity and selectivity of the catalysts. However, achieving a complete recovery of active sites is challenging but can be accomplished with proper preparation methods that ensure well-dispersed Cr species. For VOx catalysts, the addition of CO2 in the feed gas of C3H8/O2 can mitigate overoxidation by decreasing surface molecular oxygen species. CO2 can partially reoxidize VOx catalysts, converting V2O3 to V2O4, but cannot fully reoxidize them to V2O5. DFT calculations have been used to propose redox mechanisms for the entire reaction network, including CO2ODHP, DHP, and RWGS.

          Cr基催化剂在氧化脱氢过程中失活的主要原因是焦炭沉积和活性位点的还原。使用空气或CO2在高温(550-650摄氏度)下的再生方法可以有效地恢复催化剂的大部分活性和选择性。然而，实现活性位点的完全恢复是具有挑战性的，但可以通过确保Cr物种良好分散的适当制备方法来实现。对于VOx催化剂，向C3H8/O2的进料气体中添加CO2可以减少过度氧化，通过减少表面分子氧物种来实现。CO2可以部分再氧化VOx催化剂，将V2O3转化为V2O4，但不能完全再氧化为V2O5。DFT计算已被用于提出整个反应网络的氧化还原机制，包括CO2ODHP，DHP和RWGS。
