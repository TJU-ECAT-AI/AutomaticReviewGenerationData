The primary causes of metal oxide catalyst deactivation, focusing on Cr-based and VOx catalysts, are not explicitly mentioned in the literature. However, it is noted that CrOx/silica catalysts suffer from rapid deactivation due to coke deposition and CrOx reduction, which converts the coordinatively unsaturated Cr3+ state into the inactive Cr2+ state. The effectiveness of various regeneration methods, such as reoxidation with air, CO2, or O2, is not directly compared in the literature. However, it is mentioned that the addition of a small amount of O2 decreases the deactivation rate of the CrOx/silica catalyst but significantly decreases the selectivity of the reaction for C3H6. The potential of CO2 addition for mitigating overoxidation in VOx-catalyzed reactions is not discussed in the literature.

The primary causes of metal oxide catalyst deactivation, focusing on Cr-based and VOx catalysts, in oxidative dehydrogenation processes are not explicitly stated in the literature. However, it is mentioned that in the dehydrogenation of higher alkanes, the produced alkenes contain allylic hydrogen, which has much lower bond dissociation energy than that of starting alkanes. Thus, abstraction of hydrogen from the allylic position may proceed more rapidly to give coke precursors. Deactivation of the catalyst could not be avoided, consequently giving decreases in alkene yields. Various regeneration methods such as reoxidation with air, CO2, or O2 are not compared in terms of their effectiveness, temperature requirements, and impact on catalytic performance.

The primary causes of deactivation for Cr-based catalysts in oxidative dehydrogenation processes are coke deposition and the reduction of active sites. Regeneration methods using air or CO2 at high temperatures (550-650 degrees Celsius) are effective in recovering most of the activity and selectivity of the catalysts. However, achieving a complete recovery of active sites is challenging but can be accomplished with proper preparation methods that ensure well-dispersed Cr species. For VOx catalysts, the addition of CO2 in the feed gas of C3H8/O2 can mitigate overoxidation by decreasing surface molecular oxygen species. CO2 can partially reoxidize VOx catalysts, converting V2O3 to V2O4, but cannot fully reoxidize them to V2O5. DFT calculations have been used to propose redox mechanisms for the entire reaction network, including CO2ODHP, DHP, and RWGS.

The primary causes of metal oxide catalyst deactivation in oxidative dehydrogenation processes, focusing on Cr-based and VOx catalysts, are not explicitly mentioned in the literature. However, it is noted that the VOx/SiO2 catalysts are rapidly deactivated with increasing VOx content above the theoretical monolayer coverage. The catalytic activity did not increase with reaction temperature, while the selectivity to propylene decreased at the expense of propane cracking reactions. Moreover, the S2 and S3 catalysts that showed higher conversion for CO2 ODH of propane tended to be deactivated rather quickly with time on stream. Also, deactivation of the S2 and S3 catalysts was accelerated at a higher reaction temperature of 600 C, as propane conversion decreased by about 50% after 1 h under catalytic reaction conditions. These results suggested that a more limited extent of surface reoxidation with increased VOx coverage may be responsible for the decreased ODH activity of VOx/SiO2 catalysts. The effectiveness of various regeneration methods, such as reoxidation with air, CO2, or O2, is not directly compared in the literature. However, it is mentioned that the exposure of the silica surface to hydrocarbon intermediates is minimized above monolayer coverage of the VOx species, which explains the diminished carbon deposition observed for the S4 catalyst (ca. 2% weight loss). The potential of CO2 addition for mitigating overoxidation in VOx-catalyzed reactions is not discussed in the literature.

The primary causes of metal oxide catalyst deactivation, focusing on Cr-based and VOx catalysts, in oxidative dehydrogenation processes include catalyst poisoning, high cost of Pt, environmental concerns associated with the use of Cr, strong adsorption of reactants on the active sites, coke deposition, sintering of vanadium oxide species, and formation of larger V2O5 crystallites or mixed oxides such as AlVO4. Reoxidation with air, CO2, or O2 can be used to regenerate the catalysts. Reoxidation with air or O2 is effective but requires high temperatures, while CO2 addition can mitigate overoxidation in VOx-catalyzed reactions by facilitating the reverse watergas shift reaction, which lifts the thermodynamic limitation of the reaction and increases alkane conversion. However, the effect of CO2 depends strongly on the catalyst support. If the basic sites are too strong, CO2 irreversibly adsorbs and poisons these sites, increasing the acidity of the support, which in turn increases coke formation and lowers selectivity. If these basic sites are absent, no beneficial effects of CO2 are observed. The addition of MgO can improve the performance of supported vanadium catalysts by reducing coke formation.

The effectiveness of various regeneration methods, such as reoxidation with air, CO2, or O2, is not directly compared in terms of temperature requirements and impact on catalytic performance. The potential of CO2 addition for mitigating overoxidation in VOx-catalyzed reactions is suggested by the literature, as CO2 can re-oxidize partially reduced metal oxides, suppress the formation of surface carbon, and enhance the selectivity towards propylene production. Reoxidation methods, such as using CO2, are effective in regenerating the catalyst but cannot completely reoxidize it to its V2O5 state, only to V2O4. The presence of WOx hinders the clustering of VOx species during the reaction, preventing the formation of non-selective oxygen, which reduces the probability of CO2 formation and thus total oxidation of propane. Reoxidation with CO2 is less effective than with O2 in fully reoxidizing the catalyst to its V2O5 state, as it can only oxidize to V2O4. The use of CO2 addition can mitigate overoxidation in VOx-catalyzed reactions by suppressing the formation of surface carbon and allowing the reaction to proceed via direct oxidative dehydrogenation and non-oxidative dehydrogenation followed by the reverse water gas shift reaction.

The literature does not provide specific information on the primary causes of metal oxide catalyst deactivation in oxidative dehydrogenation processes, focusing on Cr-based and VOx catalysts. It does not compare various regeneration methods such as reoxidation with air, CO2, or O2 in terms of their effectiveness, temperature requirements, and impact on catalytic performance. The potential of CO2 addition for mitigating overoxidation in VOx-catalyzed reactions is suggested, but the specific details of how this is achieved are not provided.

The primary causes of deactivation for Cr-based catalysts in oxidative dehydrogenation processes are coke deposition and the reduction of active sites. Regeneration methods using air or CO2 at high temperatures (550-650 degrees Celsius) are effective in recovering most of the activity and selectivity of the catalysts. However, achieving a complete recovery of active sites is challenging but can be accomplished with proper preparation methods that ensure well-dispersed Cr species. For VOx catalysts, the addition of CO2 in the feed gas of C3H8/O2 can mitigate overoxidation by decreasing surface molecular oxygen species. CO2 can partially reoxidize VOx catalysts, converting V2O3 to V2O4, but cannot fully reoxidize them to V2O5. DFT calculations have been used to propose redox mechanisms for the entire reaction network, including CO2ODHP, DHP, and RWGS.

The primary causes of metal oxide catalyst deactivation in oxidative dehydrogenation processes, focusing on Cr-based and VOx catalysts, are not explicitly mentioned in the literature. However, it is noted that the VOx/SiO2 catalysts are rapidly deactivated with increasing VOx content above the theoretical monolayer coverage. The catalytic activity did not increase with reaction temperature, while the selectivity to propylene decreased at the expense of propane cracking reactions. Moreover, the S2 and S3 catalysts that showed higher conversion for CO2 ODH of propane tended to be deactivated rather quickly with time on stream. Also, deactivation of the S2 and S3 catalysts was accelerated at a higher reaction temperature of 600 C, as propane conversion decreased by about 50% after 1 h under catalytic reaction conditions. These results suggested that a more limited extent of surface reoxidation with increased VOx coverage may be responsible for the decreased ODH activity of VOx/SiO2 catalysts. The effectiveness of various regeneration methods, such as reoxidation with air, CO2, or O2, is not directly compared in the literature. However, it is mentioned that the exposure of the silica surface to hydrocarbon intermediates is minimized above monolayer coverage of the VOx species, which explains the diminished carbon deposition observed for the S4 catalyst (ca. 2% weight loss). The potential of CO2 addition for mitigating overoxidation in VOx-catalyzed reactions is not discussed in the literature.

The primary causes of metal oxide catalyst deactivation, focusing on Cr-based and VOx catalysts, in oxidative dehydrogenation processes include catalyst poisoning, high cost of Pt, environmental concerns associated with the use of Cr, strong adsorption of reactants on the active sites, coke deposition, sintering of vanadium oxide species, and formation of larger V2O5 crystallites or mixed oxides such as AlVO4. Reoxidation with air, CO2, or O2 can be used to regenerate the catalysts. Reoxidation with air or O2 is effective but requires high temperatures, while CO2 addition can mitigate overoxidation in VOx-catalyzed reactions by facilitating the reverse watergas shift reaction, which lifts the thermodynamic limitation of the reaction and increases alkane conversion. However, the effect of CO2 depends strongly on the catalyst support. If the basic sites are too strong, CO2 irreversibly adsorbs and poisons these sites, increasing the acidity of the support, which in turn increases coke formation and lowers selectivity. If these basic sites are absent, no beneficial effects of CO2 are observed. The addition of MgO can improve the performance of supported vanadium catalysts by reducing coke formation.

However, it is noted that CO2-assisted propane dehydrogenation results in a higher selectivity toward propylene production and a reduction of carbon formation. The effectiveness of various regeneration methods, such as reoxidation with air, CO2, or O2, is not directly compared in terms of temperature requirements and impact on catalytic performance. The potential of CO2 addition for mitigating overoxidation in VOx-catalyzed reactions is suggested by the literature, as CO2 can re-oxidize partially reduced metal oxides, suppress the formation of surface carbon, and enhance the selectivity towards propylene production. Reoxidation methods, such as using CO2, are effective in regenerating the catalyst but cannot completely reoxidize it to its V2O5 state, only to V2O4. The presence of WOx hinders the clustering of VOx species during the reaction, preventing the formation of non-selective oxygen, which reduces the probability of CO2 formation and thus total oxidation of propane. Reoxidation with CO2 is less effective than with O2 in fully reoxidizing the catalyst to its V2O5 state, as it can only oxidize to V2O4. The use of CO2 addition can mitigate overoxidation in VOx-catalyzed reactions by suppressing the formation of surface carbon and allowing the reaction to proceed via direct oxidative dehydrogenation and non-oxidative dehydrogenation followed by the reverse water gas shift reaction.

The primary causes of metal oxide catalyst deactivation, focusing on Cr-based and VOx catalysts, are not explicitly mentioned in the literature. However, it is noted that CrOx/silica catalysts suffer from rapid deactivation due to coke deposition and CrOx reduction, which converts the coordinatively unsaturated Cr3+ state into the inactive Cr2+ state. The effectiveness of various regeneration methods, such as reoxidation with air, CO2, or O2, is not directly compared in the literature. However, it is mentioned that the addition of a small amount of O2 decreases the deactivation rate of the CrOx/silica catalyst but significantly decreases the selectivity of the reaction for C3H6. The potential of CO2 addition for mitigating overoxidation in VOx-catalyzed reactions is not discussed in the literature.

The primary causes of metal oxide catalyst deactivation, focusing on Cr-based and VOx catalysts, in oxidative dehydrogenation processes are not explicitly stated in the literature. However, it is mentioned that in the dehydrogenation of higher alkanes, the produced alkenes contain allylic hydrogen, which has much lower bond dissociation energy than that of starting alkanes. Thus, abstraction of hydrogen from the allylic position may proceed more rapidly to give coke precursors. Deactivation of the catalyst could not be avoided, consequently giving decreases in alkene yields.

The primary causes of metal oxide catalyst deactivation in oxidative dehydrogenation processes, focusing on Cr-based and VOx catalysts, are not explicitly mentioned in the literature. However, it is noted that the VOx/SiO2 catalysts are rapidly deactivated with increasing VOx content above the theoretical monolayer coverage. The catalytic activity did not increase with reaction temperature, while the selectivity to propylene decreased at the expense of propane cracking reactions. Moreover, the S2 and S3 catalysts that showed higher conversion for CO2 ODH of propane tended to be deactivated rather quickly with time on stream. Also, deactivation of the S2 and S3 catalysts was accelerated at a higher reaction temperature of 600 C, as propane conversion decreased by about 50% after 1 h under catalytic reaction conditions. These results suggested that a more limited extent of surface reoxidation with increased VOx coverage may be responsible for the decreased ODH activity of VOx/SiO2 catalysts. The effectiveness of various regeneration methods, such as reoxidation with air, CO2, or O2, is not directly compared in the literature. However, it is mentioned that the exposure of the silica surface to hydrocarbon intermediates is minimized above monolayer coverage of the VOx species, which explains the diminished carbon deposition observed for the S4 catalyst (ca. 2% weight loss). The potential of CO2 addition for mitigating overoxidation in VOx-catalyzed reactions is not discussed in the literature.

The primary causes of metal oxide catalyst deactivation, focusing on Cr-based and VOx catalysts, in oxidative dehydrogenation processes include catalyst poisoning, high cost of Pt, environmental concerns associated with the use of Cr, strong adsorption of reactants on the active sites, coke deposition, sintering of vanadium oxide species, and formation of larger V2O5 crystallites or mixed oxides such as AlVO4. Reoxidation with air, CO2, or O2 can be used to regenerate the catalysts. Reoxidation with air or O2 is effective but requires high temperatures, while CO2 addition can mitigate overoxidation in VOx-catalyzed reactions by facilitating the reverse watergas shift reaction, which lifts the thermodynamic limitation of the reaction and increases alkane conversion. However, the effect of CO2 depends strongly on the catalyst support. If the basic sites are too strong, CO2 irreversibly adsorbs and poisons these sites, increasing the acidity of the support, which in turn increases coke formation and lowers selectivity. If these basic sites are absent, no beneficial effects of CO2 are observed. The addition of MgO can improve the performance of supported vanadium catalysts by reducing coke formation.

The primary causes of metal oxide catalyst deactivation, focusing on Cr-based and VOx catalysts, in oxidative dehydrogenation processes are not explicitly mentioned in the literature. However, it is noted that CO2-assisted propane dehydrogenation results in a higher selectivity toward propylene production and a reduction of carbon formation. The effectiveness of various regeneration methods, such as reoxidation with air, CO2, or O2, is not directly compared in terms of temperature requirements and impact on catalytic performance. The potential of CO2 addition for mitigating overoxidation in VOx-catalyzed reactions is suggested by the literature, as CO2 can re-oxidize partially reduced metal oxides, suppress the formation of surface carbon, and enhance the selectivity towards propylene production. Reoxidation methods, such as using CO2, are effective in regenerating the catalyst but cannot completely reoxidize it to its V2O5 state, only to V2O4. The presence of WOx hinders the clustering of VOx species during the reaction, preventing the formation of non-selective oxygen, which reduces the probability of CO2 formation and thus total oxidation of propane. Reoxidation with CO2 is less effective than with O2 in fully reoxidizing the catalyst to its V2O5 state, as it can only oxidize to V2O4. The use of CO2 addition can mitigate overoxidation in VOx-catalyzed reactions by suppressing the formation of surface carbon and allowing the reaction to proceed via direct oxidative dehydrogenation and non-oxidative dehydrogenation followed by the reverse water gas shift reaction.
