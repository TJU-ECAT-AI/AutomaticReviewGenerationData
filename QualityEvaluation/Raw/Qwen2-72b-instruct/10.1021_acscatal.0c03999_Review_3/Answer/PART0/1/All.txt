However, much less heat is formed when CO2 is used, so the dehydrogenation reaction remains endothermic (H2 + CO2  H2O + CO (ΔH2980 = 41 kJ mol1)), as the RWGS does not provide enough heat to compensate for the highly endothermic dehydrogenation reaction. The cofeeding of CO2 may result in additional coke deposition, due to the increased CO and decreased H2 partial pressures brought about by the reverse watergas shift reaction.\"\n          [8] \"On the other hand, coke may be gasified by CO2.\"\n          [9] \"The surface area-to-metal loading ratio determines which species will form.

However, it is noted that CO2-assisted propane dehydrogenation results in a higher selectivity toward propylene production and a reduction of carbon formation. The effectiveness of various regeneration methods, such as reoxidation with air, CO2, or O2, is not directly compared in terms of temperature requirements and impact on catalytic performance. The potential of CO2 addition for mitigating overoxidation in VOx-catalyzed reactions is suggested by the literature, as CO2 can re-oxidize partially reduced metal oxides, suppress the formation of surface carbon, and enhance the selectivity towards propylene production. Reoxidation methods, such as using CO2, are effective in regenerating the catalyst but cannot completely reoxidize it to its V2O5 state, only to V2O4. The presence of WOx hinders the clustering of VOx species during the reaction, preventing the formation of non-selective oxygen, which reduces the probability of CO2 formation and thus total oxidation of propane. Reoxidation with CO2 is less effective than with O2 in fully reoxidizing the catalyst to its V2O5 state, as it can only oxidize to V2O4. The use of CO2 addition can mitigate overoxidation in VOx-catalyzed reactions by suppressing the formation of surface carbon and allowing the reaction to proceed via direct oxidative dehydrogenation and non-oxidative dehydrogenation followed by the reverse water gas shift reaction.", "Chinese": "关于Cr基和VOx催化剂在氧化脱氢过程中的主要失活原因，文献中没有明确提及。然而，文献指出，CO2辅助丙烷脱氢导致丙烯产率提高和碳形成减少。各种再生方法（如用空气、CO2或O2再氧化）在温度要求和对催化性能影响方面的有效性没有直接比较。文献表明，CO2添加有可能缓解VOx催化反应中的过度氧化，因为CO2可以再氧化部分还原的金属氧化物，抑制表面碳的形成，并提高丙烯的产率。再生方法，如使用CO2，可以有效地再生催化剂，但不能完全将其重新氧化到V2O5状态，只能氧化到V2O4。WOx的存在可以阻止VOx物种在反应过程中的聚集，防止非选择性氧的形成，从而降低CO2生成的概率，减少丙烷的完全氧化。与O2相比，CO2的再氧化在将催化剂完全再氧化为V2O5状态方面效果较差，因为它只能氧化到V2O4。CO2的添加可以通过抑制表面碳的形成和允许反应同时通过直接氧化脱氢和非氧化脱氢后接逆向水煤气转换反应来缓解VOx催化反应中的过度氧化。", "Doi": "10.1016/j.jcat.2015.12.015"},
