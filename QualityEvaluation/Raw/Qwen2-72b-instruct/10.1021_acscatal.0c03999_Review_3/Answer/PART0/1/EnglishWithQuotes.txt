Regeneration methods using air or CO2 at high temperatures (550-650 degrees Celsius) are effective in recovering most of the activity and selectivity of the catalysts. However, achieving a complete recovery of active sites is challenging but can be accomplished with proper preparation methods that ensure well-dispersed Cr species. For VOx catalysts, the addition of CO2 in the feed gas of C3H8/O2 can mitigate overoxidation by decreasing surface molecular oxygen species. CO2 can partially reoxidize VOx catalysts, converting V2O3 to V2O4, but cannot fully reoxidize them to V2O5. DFT calculations have been used to propose redox mechanisms for the entire reaction network, including CO2ODHP, DHP, and RWGS.", "Doi": "10.1021/acscatal.0c03999_3"},
{"Quotes": "No quotes provided.", "English": "The primary causes of metal oxide catalyst deactivation in oxidative dehydrogenation processes, focusing on Cr-based and VOx catalysts, are not explicitly mentioned in the literature. However, it is noted that the VOx/SiO2 catalysts are rapidly deactivated with increasing VOx content above the theoretical monolayer coverage. The catalytic activity did not increase with reaction temperature, while the selectivity to propylene decreased at the expense of propane cracking reactions. Moreover, the S2 and S3 catalysts that showed higher conversion for CO2 ODH of propane tended to be deactivated rather quickly with time on stream. Also, deactivation of the S2 and S3 catalysts was accelerated at a higher reaction temperature of 600 C, as propane conversion decreased by about 50% after 1 h under catalytic reaction conditions. These results suggested that a more limited extent of surface reoxidation with increased VOx coverage may be responsible for the decreased ODH activity of VOx/SiO2 catalysts. The effectiveness of various regeneration methods, such as reoxidation with air, CO2, or O2, is not directly compared in the literature. However, it is mentioned that the exposure of the silica surface to hydrocarbon intermediates is minimized above monolayer coverage of the VOx species, which explains the diminished carbon deposition observed for the S4 catalyst (ca. 2% weight loss). The potential of CO2 addition for mitigating overoxidation in VOx-catalyzed reactions is not discussed in the literature.", "Doi": "10.1002/ejic.201701049"},
