In the realm of oxidative dehydrogenation processes, the deactivation of metal oxide catalysts, particularly those based on chromium (Cr) and vanadium oxides (VOx), poses significant challenges due to coke formation and the accumulation of carbonaceous residues. Deactivation mechanisms often involve the blocking of active sites by coke, leading to reduced catalytic activity and selectivity. To counteract this, regeneration strategies are employed, which typically include thermal treatment under oxidative conditions to burn off the coke without damaging the catalyst structure. Additionally, innovative approaches are being explored to optimize the performance of these catalysts by enhancing their stability and activity. One promising direction is the utilization of CO2 as a reactant, which not only mitigates coke formation but also converts CO2 into value-added products, thereby addressing environmental concerns while improving process efficiency. Research in this area is focused on developing catalysts with tailored properties that can effectively manage coke deposition and promote CO2 utilization, ultimately leading to more sustainable and economically viable oxidative dehydrogenation processes.
