The deactivation mechanisms of metal oxide catalysts, specifically Cr-based and VOx catalysts, in oxidative dehydrogenation processes are multifaceted and complex. CrOx/silica catalysts are prone to rapid deactivation due to coke deposition and the reduction of CrOx, which converts the coordinatively unsaturated Cr3+ state into the inactive Cr2+ state \[10.1002/cctc.201200397\]. The addition of a small amount of O2 can decrease the deactivation rate of CrOx/silica catalysts but significantly decreases the selectivity of the reaction for C3H6 \[10.1002/cctc.201200397\]. For VOx catalysts, deactivation is observed with increasing VOx content above the theoretical monolayer coverage, leading to a decrease in catalytic activity and selectivity to propylene at the expense of propane cracking reactions \[10.1002/ejic.201701049\]. The S2 and S3 catalysts, which showed higher conversion for CO2 ODH of propane, tended to deactivate rather quickly with time on stream, and this deactivation was accelerated at a higher reaction temperature of 600 C \[10.1002/ejic.201701049\].

Regeneration strategies for Cr-based catalysts involve reoxidation with air or CO2 at high temperatures (550-650 degrees Celsius), which is effective in recovering most of the activity and selectivity of the catalysts \[10.1021/acscatal.0c03999_3\]. However, achieving a complete recovery of active sites is challenging but can be accomplished with proper preparation methods that ensure well-dispersed Cr species \[10.1021/acscatal.0c03999_3\]. For VOx catalysts, the addition of CO2 in the feed gas of C3H8/O2 can mitigate overoxidation by decreasing surface molecular oxygen species. CO2 can partially reoxidize VOx catalysts, converting V2O3 to V2O4, but cannot fully reoxidize them to V2O5 \[10.1021/acscatal.0c03999_3\].

The performance optimization of metal oxide catalysts in oxidative dehydrogenation processes, particularly in terms of coke mitigation and CO2 utilization, is a critical area of research. CO2-assisted propane dehydrogenation results in a higher selectivity toward propylene production and a reduction of carbon formation \[10.1016/j.jcat.2015.12.015\]. The use of CO2 addition can mitigate overoxidation in VOx-catalyzed reactions by suppressing the formation of surface carbon and allowing the reaction to proceed via direct oxidative dehydrogenation and non-oxidative dehydrogenation followed by the reverse water gas shift reaction \[10.1016/j.jcat.2015.12.015\].

※※※
Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: The deactivation mechanisms of Cr-based and VOx catalysts in oxidative dehydrogenation processes are primarily attributed to coke deposition and the reduction of active sites. Regeneration strategies, particularly the use of CO2, offer promising avenues for mitigating overoxidation and enhancing catalytic performance. Future research should focus on developing more efficient regeneration methods that can fully reoxidize VOx catalysts to their V2O5 state and on understanding the role of CO2 in suppressing the formation of surface carbon. The optimization of catalyst preparation methods to ensure well-dispersed Cr species and the exploration of novel supports that can improve the performance of supported vanadium catalysts by reducing coke formation are also critical areas for investigation. The potential of CO2 addition for mitigating overoxidation in VOx-catalyzed reactions opens up new possibilities for the design of more sustainable and efficient oxidative dehydrogenation processes.

Regeneration strategies, particularly the use of CO2, offer promising avenues for mitigating these issues. However, the effectiveness of regeneration methods is influenced by factors such as temperature requirements and the impact on catalytic performance. The potential of CO2 addition for mitigating overoxidation in VOx-catalyzed reactions is a promising area for further exploration. Future research might focus on developing catalysts with enhanced stability against deactivation, optimizing regeneration methods for specific catalyst types, and exploring the synergistic effects of CO2 addition on catalytic performance. The use of advanced characterization techniques and computational methods could provide deeper insights into the deactivation mechanisms and guide the design of more robust catalysts for oxidative dehydrogenation processes.

The development of predictive models based on density functional theory (DFT) calculations could also aid in the rational design of new catalysts with improved performance and stability.

The deactivation mechanisms of metal oxide catalysts, particularly Cr-based and VOx, in oxidative dehydrogenation processes are multifaceted, involving coke deposition and the reduction of active sites \[10.1002/cctc.201200397\]. CrOx/silica catalysts, for instance, suffer from rapid deactivation due to coke deposition and the conversion of coordinatively unsaturated Cr3+ to inactive Cr2+ \[10.1002/cctc.201200397\]. For VOx catalysts, deactivation is exacerbated by increased VOx content above monolayer coverage, leading to reduced surface reoxidation and decreased ODH activity \[10.1002/ejic.201701049\]. The addition of a small amount of O2 can decrease the deactivation rate of CrOx/silica catalysts but significantly reduces the selectivity for C3H6 \[10.1002/cctc.201200397\]. Reoxidation methods using air or CO2 at high temperatures (550-650 degrees Celsius) are effective in recovering most of the activity and selectivity of Cr-based catalysts \[10.1021/acscatal.0c03999_3\]. However, achieving a complete recovery of active sites is challenging without proper preparation methods that ensure well-dispersed Cr species \[10.1021/acscatal.0c03999_3\]. For VOx catalysts, CO2 addition in the feed gas of C3H8/O2 can mitigate overoxidation by decreasing surface molecular oxygen species and partially reoxidizing VOx catalysts from V2O3 to V2O4 \[10.1021/acscatal.0c03999_3\]. The effectiveness of various regeneration methods, such as reoxidation with air, CO2, or O2, is not directly compared in terms of their effectiveness, temperature requirements, and impact on catalytic performance \[10.1002/ejic.201701049\]. However, CO2 addition can enhance the selectivity towards propylene production and reduce carbon formation in propane dehydrogenation \[10.1016/j.jcat.2015.12.015\].

Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: The deactivation of metal oxide catalysts in oxidative dehydrogenation processes, particularly Cr-based and VOx, is a complex issue that requires a multifaceted approach for mitigation. The potential of CO2 addition for mitigating overoxidation in VOx-catalyzed reactions and enhancing the selectivity towards propylene production presents a promising avenue for future research \[10.1016/j.jcat.2015.12.015\]. The use of CO2 can also suppress the formation of surface carbon and allow the reaction to proceed via direct oxidative dehydrogenation and non-oxidative dehydrogenation followed by the reverse water gas shift reaction \[10.1016/j.jcat.2015.12.015\]. However, the effect of CO2 depends strongly on the catalyst support, and if the basic sites are too strong, CO2 can irreversibly adsorb and poison these sites, increasing the acidity of the support and increasing coke formation \[10.1021/cr5002436\]. Future research might focus on developing catalysts with optimized basic sites that can effectively utilize CO2 for regeneration while minimizing coke formation. Additionally, the development of preparation methods that ensure well-dispersed Cr species could lead to a complete recovery of active sites in Cr-based catalysts \[10.1021/acscatal.0c03999_3\]. The use of MgO can also improve the performance of supported vanadium catalysts by reducing coke formation \[10.1021/cr5002436\]. These findings suggest that there is a need for further research on the development of novel catalysts and regeneration methods that can effectively mitigate deactivation mechanisms and optimize catalytic performance in oxidative dehydrogenation processes.

The deactivation mechanisms of metal oxide catalysts, specifically Cr-based and VOx, in oxidative dehydrogenation processes are multifaceted and complex. CrOx/silica catalysts, for instance, suffer from rapid deactivation due to coke deposition and the reduction of CrOx, converting the coordinatively unsaturated Cr3+ state into the inactive Cr2+ state \[10.1002/cctc.201200397\]. This deactivation is exacerbated by the abstraction of hydrogen from allylic positions, leading to the formation of coke precursors \[10.1016/S0920-5861(03)00268-2\]. VOx/SiO2 catalysts, on the other hand, are rapidly deactivated with increasing VOx content above the theoretical monolayer coverage, with a decrease in selectivity to propylene at the expense of propane cracking reactions \[10.1002/ejic.201701049\].

Regeneration strategies for these catalysts include reoxidation with air, CO2, or O2. Reoxidation with air or CO2 at high temperatures (550-650 degrees Celsius) is effective in recovering most of the activity and selectivity of Cr-based catalysts \[10.1021/acscatal.0c03999_3\]. However, achieving a complete recovery of active sites is challenging and requires proper preparation methods to ensure well-dispersed Cr species. For VOx catalysts, the addition of CO2 in the feed gas of C3H8/O2 can mitigate overoxidation by decreasing surface molecular oxygen species \[10.1021/acscatal.0c03999_3\]. CO2 can partially reoxidize VOx catalysts, converting V2O3 to V2O4, but cannot fully reoxidize them to V2O5 \[10.1021/acscatal.0c03999_3\].

The effectiveness of CO2 addition for mitigating overoxidation in VOx-catalyzed reactions is suggested by the literature \[10.1016/j.jcat.2015.12.015\]. CO2 can re-oxidize partially reduced metal oxides, suppress the formation of surface carbon, and enhance the selectivity towards propylene production. Reoxidation methods using CO2 are effective in regenerating the catalyst but cannot completely reoxidize it to its V2O5 state, only to V2O4 \[10.1016/j.jcat.2015.12.015\]. The presence of WOx hinders the clustering of VOx species during the reaction, preventing the formation of non-selective oxygen, which reduces the probability of CO2 formation and thus total oxidation of propane \[10.1016/j.jcat.2015.12.015\].

Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: The deactivation mechanisms and regeneration strategies for Cr-based and VOx catalysts in oxidative dehydrogenation processes highlight the need for innovative methodologies to enhance catalytic performance and mitigate deactivation. The potential of CO2 addition for mitigating overoxidation in VOx-catalyzed reactions opens up new avenues for research, particularly in the context of sustainable and environmentally friendly catalytic processes. Future research endeavors might focus on developing novel catalyst preparation methods that ensure well-dispersed active sites, minimizing the formation of coke and maximizing the selectivity towards desired products. Additionally, the exploration of alternative regeneration methods that can fully reoxidize VOx catalysts to their V2O5 state could lead to significant improvements in catalytic performance and longevity. The integration of CO2 utilization in catalytic processes not only mitigates overoxidation but also offers a potential pathway for carbon capture and utilization, aligning with the broader goals of green chemistry and sustainable catalysis.
