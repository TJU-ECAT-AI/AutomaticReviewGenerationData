1.The document does not provide information on the primary causes of metal oxide catalyst deactivation, focusing on Cr-based and VOx catalysts, in oxidative dehydrogenation processes. Nor does it compare various regeneration methods such as reoxidation with air, CO2, or O2 in terms of their effectiveness, temperature requirements, and impact on catalytic performance. It also does not discuss the potential of CO2 addition for mitigating overoxidation in VOx-catalyzed reactions.
