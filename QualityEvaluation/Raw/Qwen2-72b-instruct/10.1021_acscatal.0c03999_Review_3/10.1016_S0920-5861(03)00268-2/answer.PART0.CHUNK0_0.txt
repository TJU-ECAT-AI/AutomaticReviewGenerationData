1.The primary causes of metal oxide catalyst deactivation, focusing on Cr-based and VOx catalysts, in oxidative dehydrogenation processes are not explicitly stated in the literature. However, it is mentioned that in the dehydrogenation of higher alkanes, the produced alkenes contain allylic hydrogen, which has much lower bond dissociation energy than that of starting alkanes. Thus, abstraction of hydrogen from the allylic position may proceed more rapidly to give coke precursors. Deactivation of the catalyst could not be avoided, consequently giving decreases in alkene yields. Various regeneration methods such as reoxidation with air, CO2, or O2 are not compared in terms of their effectiveness, temperature requirements, and impact on catalytic performance. The potential of CO2 addition for mitigating overoxidation in VOx-catalyzed reactions is not discussed.

1.金属氧化物催化剂失活的主要原因,重点关注Cr基和VOx催化剂,在氧化脱氢过程中没有在文献中明确说明。然而,提到在较高烷烃的脱氢中,产生的烯烃含有烯丙基氢,其键解离能远低于起始烷烃。因此,从烯丙基位置抽离氢可能更迅速地产生焦炭前体。无法避免催化剂失活,结果导致烯烃产量下降。没有比较各种再生方法,如用空气、CO2或O2再氧化,在效果、温度要求和对催化性能影响方面的比较。没有讨论CO2添加在VOx催化反应中缓解过度氧化的潜力。
