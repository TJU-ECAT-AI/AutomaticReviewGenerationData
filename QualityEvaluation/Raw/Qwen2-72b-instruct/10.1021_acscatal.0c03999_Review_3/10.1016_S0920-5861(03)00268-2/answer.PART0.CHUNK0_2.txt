1.The primary causes of metal oxide catalyst deactivation, focusing on Cr-based and VOx catalysts, in oxidative dehydrogenation processes are not explicitly stated in the literature. However, it is mentioned that in the dehydrogenation of higher alkanes, the produced alkenes contain allylic hydrogen, which has much lower bond dissociation energy than that of starting alkanes. Thus, abstraction of hydrogen from the allylic position may proceed more rapidly to give coke precursors. Deactivation of the catalyst could not be avoided, consequently giving decreases in alkene yields. Various regeneration methods such as reoxidation with air, CO2, or O2 are not compared in terms of their effectiveness, temperature requirements, and impact on catalytic performance. The potential of CO2 addition for mitigating overoxidation in VOx-catalyzed reactions is not discussed.

1.在氧化脱氢过程中，Cr基和VOx催化剂失活的主要原因在文献中没有明确说明。然而，提到在较高烷烃的脱氢过程中，产生的烯烃含有烯丙基氢，其键解离能远低于起始烷烃。因此，从烯丙基位置抽氢可能会更快地产生焦油前体。催化剂的失活无法避免，从而导致烯烃产量的下降。各种再生方法，如用空气、CO2或O2再氧化，在其有效性、温度要求和对催化性能的影响方面没有进行比较。CO2添加在VOx催化反应中防止过度氧化的潜力没有被讨论。
