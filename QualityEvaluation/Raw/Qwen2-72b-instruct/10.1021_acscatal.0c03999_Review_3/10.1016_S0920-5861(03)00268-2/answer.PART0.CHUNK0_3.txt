1.The primary causes of metal oxide catalyst deactivation, focusing on Cr-based and VOx catalysts, are not explicitly mentioned in the literature. However, it is noted that in the dehydrogenation of higher alkanes, the produced alkenes contain allylic hydrogen, which has much lower bond dissociation energy than that of starting alkanes. Thus, abstraction of hydrogen from the allylic position may proceed more rapidly to give coke precursors, leading to deactivation of the catalyst. The literature does not provide a direct comparison of various regeneration methods such as reoxidation with air, CO2, or O2. It does mention that CO2 played a role in the shift of equilibrium and in the elimination of deposited carbon during the dehydrogenation of lower alkanes over the oxidized diamond-supported Cr2O3 and V2O5 catalysts. The potential of CO2 addition for mitigating overoxidation in VOx-catalyzed reactions is not discussed.

1.关于Cr基和VOx催化剂金属氧化物催化剂失活的主要原因,文献中没有明确提及。但是,文献指出,在较高烷烃的脱氢过程中,产生的烯烃含有烯丙基氢,其键解离能远低于起始烷烃。因此,从烯丙基位置抽提氢可能更快地产生焦炭前体,导致催化剂失活。文献没有直接比较各种再生方法,如用空气、CO2或O2再氧化。但是,它确实提到,在氧化金刚石支持的Cr2O3和V2O5催化剂上较低烷烃的脱氢过程中,CO2在平衡转移和消除沉积碳方面发挥了作用。关于CO2添加在VOx催化的反应中缓解过度氧化的潜力,文献中没有讨论。
