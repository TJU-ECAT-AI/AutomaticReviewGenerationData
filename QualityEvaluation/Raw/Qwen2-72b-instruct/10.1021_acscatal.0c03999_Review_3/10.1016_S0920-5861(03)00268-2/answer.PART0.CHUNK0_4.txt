1.The primary causes of metal oxide catalyst deactivation, focusing on Cr-based and VOx catalysts, are not explicitly mentioned in the literature. However, it is noted that in the dehydrogenation of higher alkanes, the produced alkenes contain allylic hydrogen, which has much lower bond dissociation energy than that of starting alkanes. Thus, abstraction of hydrogen from the allylic position may proceed more rapidly to give coke precursors, leading to catalyst deactivation. The literature does not provide a direct comparison of various regeneration methods such as reoxidation with air, CO2, or O2. It does mention that CO2 plays a role in the shift of equilibrium and in the elimination of deposited carbon, which could mitigate overoxidation in VOx-catalyzed reactions.

1.金属氧化物催化剂失活的主要原因,特别是Cr基和VOx催化剂,在文献中没有明确提及。但是,文献指出,在较高烷烃的脱氢过程中,产生的烯烃含有烯丙基氢,其键解离能远低于起始烷烃。因此,从烯丙基位置抽提氢可能更快地进行,产生焦炭前体,导致催化剂失活。文献没有直接比较各种再生方法,如用空气、CO2或O2再氧化。但它确实提到CO2在平衡转移和消除沉积碳中发挥作用,这可能有助于缓解VOx催化反应中的过度氧化。
