[1] "Coke deposition and reduction of active sites are major reasons for deactivation of Cr-based catalysts."
[2] "Regeneration in air or CO2 at high temperatures (i.e., 550650 C) is widely applied, through which most of the activity and selectivity are usually recoverable."
[3] "By contrast, a complete recovery of active sites is rather challenging yet is still achievable if a proper method is used to prepare well-dispersed Cr species."
[4] "Adding CO2 in the feed gas of C3H8/O2 is a promising approach, as it enables a decrease of surface molecular oxygen species that account for overoxidation by tuning adsorptiondesorption equilibria on basic oxidizing sites."
[5] "Results of isothermal reduction confirm that CO2 cannot reoxidize the catalyst completely to V2O5 but is capable of oxidizing V2O3 to V2O4."
[6] "Redox mechanisms have been proposed on the silsesquioxane cluster with an isolated V5+OV3+ pair via density functional theory (DFT) calculations for the entire reaction network including CO2ODHP, DHP, and RWGS."

1.The primary causes of metal oxide catalyst deactivation in oxidative dehydrogenation processes, focusing on Cr-based and VOx catalysts, are coke deposition and reduction of active sites. For Cr-based catalysts, regeneration in air or CO2 at high temperatures (550-650 C) is effective in recovering most of the activity and selectivity. Complete recovery of active sites is challenging but achievable with well-dispersed Cr species. For VOx catalysts, CO2 addition in the feed gas can mitigate overoxidation by decreasing surface molecular oxygen species. CO2 can partially reoxidize the catalyst, converting V2O3 to V2O4, but not completely to V2O5. The redox cycle of VOx in CO2ODHP involves the activation of the secondary CH bond of C3H8 by hydrogen abstraction, with the regeneration of active V sites differing from that in DHP.

1.在氧化脱氢过程中，金属氧化物催化剂失活的主要原因，重点关注Cr基和VOx催化剂，是焦炭沉积和活性位点的还原。对于Cr基催化剂，在高温(550-650 C)下用空气或CO2再生可以有效恢复大部分活性和选择性。完全恢复活性位点具有挑战性，但通过使用分散良好的Cr物种可以实现。对于VOx催化剂，在C3H8/O2进料气体中添加CO2可以通过减少表面分子氧物种来缓解过度氧化。CO2可以部分再氧化催化剂，将V2O3转化为V2O4，但不能完全转化为V2O5。VOx在CO2ODHP中的氧化还原循环涉及通过氢原子抽提激活C3H8的次级CH键，活性V位点的再生与DHP中的再生不同。
