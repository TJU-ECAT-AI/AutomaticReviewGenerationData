What are the primary causes of metal oxide catalyst deactivation (focusing on Cr-based and VOx catalysts) in oxidative dehydrogenation processes, and how do various regeneration methods (such as reoxidation with air, CO2, or O2) compare in terms of their effectiveness, temperature requirements, and impact on catalytic performance, including the potential of CO2 addition for mitigating overoxidation in VOx-catalyzed reactions?

[1] "Coke deposition and reduction of active sites are major reasons for deactivation of Cr-based catalysts."
[2] "Regeneration in air or CO2 at high temperatures (i.e., 550650 C) is widely applied, through which most of the activity and selectivity are usually recoverable."
[3] "By contrast, a complete recovery of active sites is rather challenging yet is still achievable if a proper method is used to prepare well-dispersed Cr species."
[4] "Adding CO2 in the feed gas of C3H8/O2 is a promising approach, as it enables a decrease of surface molecular oxygen species that account for overoxidation by tuning adsorptiondesorption equilibria on basic oxidizing sites."
[5] "Results of isothermal reduction confirm that CO2 cannot reoxidize the catalyst completely to V2O5 but is capable of oxidizing V2O3 to V2O4."
[6] "Redox mechanisms have been proposed on the silsesquioxane cluster with an isolated V5+OV3+ pair via density functional theory (DFT) calculations for the entire reaction network including CO2ODHP, DHP, and RWGS."

The primary causes of deactivation for Cr-based catalysts in oxidative dehydrogenation processes are coke deposition and the reduction of active sites. Regeneration in air or CO2 at high temperatures (550-650 C) can recover most of the activity and selectivity, with complete recovery of active sites achievable if well-dispersed Cr species are prepared. For VOx catalysts, CO2 addition in the feed gas of C3H8/O2 can decrease surface molecular oxygen species, mitigating overoxidation. However, CO2 cannot fully reoxidize the catalyst to V2O5, only to V2O4. Redox mechanisms involving V5+OV3+ pairs have been proposed for reactions including CO2ODHP, DHP, and RWGS.

Cr基催化剂在氧化脱氢过程中的主要失活原因是焦炭沉积和活性位点的还原。在高温(550-650 C)下用空气或CO2再生可以恢复大部分的活性和选择性，如果制备了分散良好的Cr物种，可以实现活性位点的完全恢复。对于VOx催化剂，向C3H8/O2的进料气体中添加CO2可以减少表面分子氧物种，从而缓解过度氧化。然而，CO2不能将催化剂完全再氧化至V2O5，只能至V2O4。已经为包括CO2ODHP、DHP和RWGS在内的反应提出了涉及V5+OV3+对的氧化还原机制。

1.The primary causes of metal oxide catalyst deactivation in oxidative dehydrogenation processes, focusing on Cr-based and VOx catalysts, are coke deposition and reduction of active sites. For Cr-based catalysts, regeneration in air or CO2 at high temperatures (550-650 C) is effective in recovering most of the activity and selectivity. Complete recovery of active sites is challenging but achievable with well-dispersed Cr species. For VOx catalysts, CO2 addition in the feed gas can mitigate overoxidation by decreasing surface molecular oxygen species. CO2 can partially reoxidize the catalyst, converting V2O3 to V2O4, but not completely to V2O5. The redox cycle of VOx in CO2ODHP involves the activation of the secondary CH bond of C3H8 by hydrogen abstraction, with the regeneration of active V sites differing from that in DHP.

Cr基催化剂在氧化脱氢过程中失活的主要原因是焦炭沉积和活性位点的还原。使用空气或CO2在高温(550-650摄氏度)下的再生方法可以有效地恢复催化剂的大部分活性和选择性。然而，实现活性位点的完全恢复是具有挑战性的，但可以通过确保Cr物种良好分散的适当制备方法来实现。对于VOx催化剂，向C3H8/O2的进料气体中添加CO2可以减少过度氧化，通过减少表面分子氧物种来实现。CO2可以部分再氧化VOx催化剂，将V2O3转化为V2O4，但不能完全再氧化为V2O5。DFT计算已被用于提出整个反应网络的氧化还原机制，包括CO2ODHP，DHP和RWGS。
