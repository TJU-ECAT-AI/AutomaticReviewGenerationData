[1] "Coke deposition and reduction of active sites are major reasons for deactivation of Cr-based catalysts."
[2] "Regeneration in air or CO2 at high temperatures (i.e., 550650 C) is widely applied, through which most of the activity and selectivity are usually recoverable."
[3] "By contrast, a complete recovery of active sites is rather challenging yet is still achievable if a proper method is used to prepare well-dispersed Cr species."
[4] "Adding CO2 in the feed gas of C3H8/O2 is a promising approach, as it enables a decrease of surface molecular oxygen species that account for overoxidation by tuning adsorptiondesorption equilibria on basic oxidizing sites."
[5] "Results of isothermal reduction confirm that CO2 cannot reoxidize the catalyst completely to V2O5 but is capable of oxidizing V2O3 to V2O4."
[6] "Redox mechanisms have been proposed on the silsesquioxane cluster with an isolated V5+OV3+ pair via density functional theory (DFT) calculations for the entire reaction network including CO2ODHP, DHP, and RWGS."

The primary causes of deactivation for Cr-based catalysts in oxidative dehydrogenation processes are coke deposition and the reduction of active sites. Regeneration in air or CO2 at high temperatures (550-650 C) can recover most of the activity and selectivity, with complete recovery of active sites achievable if well-dispersed Cr species are prepared. For VOx catalysts, CO2 addition in the feed gas of C3H8/O2 can decrease surface molecular oxygen species that cause overoxidation. CO2 can oxidize V2O3 to V2O4 but cannot completely reoxidize the catalyst to V2O5. Redox mechanisms involving V5+OV3+ pairs have been proposed for reactions including CO2ODHP, DHP, and RWGS.

Cr基催化剂在氧化脱氢过程中的主要失活原因是焦炭沉积和活性位点的还原。在高温(550-650 C)下用空气或CO2再生可以恢复大部分的活性和选择性，如果制备了分散良好的Cr物种，可以实现活性位点的完全恢复。对于VOx催化剂，在C3H8/O2的进料气体中添加CO2可以减少导致过度氧化的表面分子氧物种。CO2可以将V2O3氧化为V2O4，但不能完全将催化剂重新氧化为V2O5。已经为包括CO2ODHP、DHP和RWGS在内的反应提出了涉及V5+OV3+对的氧化还原机制。
