1.The primary causes of metal oxide catalyst deactivation, focusing on Cr-based and VOx catalysts, are not explicitly mentioned in the literature. However, it is noted that CrOx/silica catalysts suffer from rapid deactivation due to coke deposition and CrOx reduction, which converts the coordinatively unsaturated Cr3+ state into the inactive Cr2+ state. The effectiveness of various regeneration methods, such as reoxidation with air, CO2, or O2, is not directly compared in the literature. However, the addition of Ni to the CrOx/silica catalyst enhances the catalytic stability of propylene in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane with CO2 (ODHP) reaction by regenerating the reduced CrOx. The potential of CO2 addition for mitigating overoxidation in VOx-catalyzed reactions is not discussed in the literature.

1.关于Cr基和VOx催化剂金属氧化物催化剂失活的主要原因,文献中没有明确提及。但是,文献指出CrOx/硅胶催化剂由于焦炭沉积和CrOx还原而迅速失活,这将配位不饱和的Cr3+状态转化为不活跃的Cr2+状态。文献中没有直接比较各种再生方法(如用空气、CO2或O2再氧化)的有效性。但是,向CrOx/硅胶催化剂中添加Ni通过再生还原的CrOx,增强了丙烷与CO2氧化脱氢(ODHP)反应中丙烯的催化稳定性。文献中没有讨论CO2添加在VOx催化反应中缓解过度氧化的潜力。
