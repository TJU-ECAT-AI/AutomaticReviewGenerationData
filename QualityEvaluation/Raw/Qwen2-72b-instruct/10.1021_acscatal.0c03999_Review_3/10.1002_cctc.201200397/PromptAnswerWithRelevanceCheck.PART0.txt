Read the questions and answers provided below. First, critically assess the overall relevance of the answers provided to the set of questions asked.

If, upon your assessment, you find that the answers do not contain information that is relevant to the questions asked, stop your review process immediately and respond with a single sentence: "※※※※※※※The provided answers are not relevant to the questions.※※※※※※※". Do not provide any additional explanation or background information, only this sentence should be given as a response in case of irrelevant answers.

If, however, the answers are relevant to the questions asked, proceed to compile answers for each question according to the instructions below. Ensure to aggregate all the relevant answers from the multiple answer results provided in the document, and organize them sequentially by their order number, compiling the corresponding quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question.

If the provided answers' quotes are not differentiated by question, ensure to break them down and assign the quotes to each respective question, outputting them separately within each question's section.

To provide a comprehensive review, differentiate the responses into quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question based on the details given in the 'Answer' XML tags. Structure your review using the XML format showcased below if the answers are relevant to the questions asked:

What are the primary causes of metal oxide catalyst deactivation (focusing on Cr-based and VOx catalysts) in oxidative dehydrogenation processes, and how do various regeneration methods (such as reoxidation with air, CO2, or O2) compare in terms of their effectiveness, temperature requirements, and impact on catalytic performance, including the potential of CO2 addition for mitigating overoxidation in VOx-catalyzed reactions?

1.The primary causes of metal oxide catalyst deactivation, focusing on Cr-based and VOx catalysts, are not explicitly mentioned in the literature. However, it is noted that CrOx/silica catalysts suffer from rapid deactivation due to coke deposition and CrOx reduction, which converts the coordinatively unsaturated Cr3+ state into the inactive Cr2+ state. The effectiveness of various regeneration methods, such as reoxidation with air, CO2, or O2, is not directly compared in the literature. However, the addition of Ni to the CrOx/silica catalyst enhances the catalytic stability of propylene in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane with CO2 (ODHP) reaction by regenerating the reduced CrOx. The potential of CO2 addition for mitigating overoxidation in VOx-catalyzed reactions is not discussed in the literature.

1.关于Cr基和VOx催化剂金属氧化物催化剂失活的主要原因,文献中没有明确提及。但是,文献指出CrOx/硅胶催化剂由于焦炭沉积和CrOx还原而迅速失活,这将配位不饱和的Cr3+状态转化为不活跃的Cr2+状态。文献中没有直接比较各种再生方法(如用空气、CO2或O2再氧化)的有效性。但是,向CrOx/硅胶催化剂中添加Ni通过再生还原的CrOx,增强了丙烷与CO2氧化脱氢(ODHP)反应中丙烯的催化稳定性。文献中没有讨论CO2添加在VOx催化反应中缓解过度氧化的潜力。

The effectiveness of various regeneration methods, such as reoxidation with air, CO2, or O2, is not directly compared in the literature. However, it is noted that the addition of a small amount of O2 decreases the deactivation rate of the CrOx/silica catalyst but significantly decreases the selectivity of the reaction for C3H6. The potential of CO2 addition for mitigating overoxidation in VOx-catalyzed reactions is not discussed.
