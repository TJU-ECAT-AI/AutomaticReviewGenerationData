1.The primary causes of metal oxide catalyst deactivation, focusing on Cr-based and VOx catalysts, are not explicitly mentioned in the literature. However, it is noted that CrOx/silica catalysts suffer from rapid deactivation due to coke deposition and CrOx reduction, which converts the coordinatively unsaturated Cr3+ state into the inactive Cr2+ state. The effectiveness of various regeneration methods, such as reoxidation with air, CO2, or O2, is not directly compared in the literature. However, it is mentioned that the addition of a small amount of O2 decreases the deactivation rate of the CrOx/silica catalyst but significantly decreases the selectivity of the reaction for C3H6. The potential of CO2 addition for mitigating overoxidation in VOx-catalyzed reactions is not discussed in the literature.

1.金属氧化物催化剂失活的主要原因,特别是Cr基和VOx催化剂,在文献中没有明确提及。然而,文献指出CrOx/硅胶催化剂由于焦炭沉积和CrOx还原而迅速失活,这将配位不饱和的Cr3+状态转化为不活跃的Cr2+状态。各种再生方法,如用空气、CO2或O2再氧化的有效性,在文献中没有直接比较。然而,文献提到添加少量O2会降低CrOx/硅胶催化剂的失活率,但会显著降低反应对C3H6的选择性。CO2添加在VOx催化反应中缓解过度氧化的潜力在文献中没有讨论。
