1.No relevant information was provided in the literature to answer the question about the primary causes of metal oxide catalyst deactivation, focusing on Cr-based and VOx catalysts, in oxidative dehydrogenation processes. Additionally, there is no information to compare various regeneration methods, such as reoxidation with air, CO2, or O2, in terms of their effectiveness, temperature requirements, and impact on catalytic performance, including the potential of CO2 addition for mitigating overoxidation in VOx-catalyzed reactions.
