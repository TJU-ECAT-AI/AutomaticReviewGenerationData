In dehydrated catalysts with V contents lower than 2.8 wt%, vanadium is mainly in a tetrahedral environment. Higher V contents in the catalyst lead to the formation of polymeric V2O5-like species. Textural, SEM/TEM, and XRD results indicate that the ordered hexagonal mesoporous structure with large pore diameters of the support is retained upon the vanadium incorporation, and therefore high surface areas were obtained on the final catalysts. Vanadium species anchored to the surface show structural properties similar to those on mesoporous V-MCM and conventional VSiO2 catalysts, but a higher surface concentration of isolated or low polymeric VOx species could be achieved on the V-SBA samples. The number and nature of the acid sites also change with the vanadium loading. The superior performance of the present mesoporous SBA-15 catalysts in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane has been attributed to a higher dispersion of V species achieved on the SBA-15 support with large pore diameters as well as the low surface acidity of the catalyst. 2004 Elsevier Inc.

1. Introduction
Catalysts based on supported vanadium oxides have been reported to be active and selective for the oxidative dehydro- genation (ODH) of alkanes to their corresponding alkenes,but unselective combustion pathways limit alkene selectivi- ties, particularly at high conversions [16]. Especially in the field of the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propy- lene, it has been well established that the limited propy- lene selectivity at higher propane conversions is linked with propylene adsorption on acid sites and their subsequent com- bustion to carbon oxides [2,7]. Thus, new efficient catalyst systems that can allow the effective production of propy- lene with high selectivity at higher propane conversions are highly desirable. * Corresponding authors.

It is known that the catalytic behavior of supported vana- dium oxide catalysts in the selective oxidation of propane depends strongly on the content of vanadium loaded on the metal oxide supports [810]. Isolated tetrahedral vanadium oxide species containing terminal V=O groups has been suggested as the active sites for the selective formation of propylene [2]. Actually, a clear relationship between the dispersion of vanadium oxide on the silica surface and the selectivity to propylene has been observed [10]. Both vana- dium species dispersion and propylene selectivity drastically decreased for vanadia loading above 5 wt% in V2O5/SiO2 catalysts [10]. Such behavior has been interpreted with a change in the molecular structure of the supported VOx species with increasing vanadium loading. The selective iso- lated vanadium sites were predominantly formed at low vanadia content (below 15 wt%), while at higher loading polymeric species and even crystalline V2O5 species con- taining VOV entities, responsible for the over oxidation of propylene into carbon oxides, also developed on the silica 0021-9517/$  see front matter 2004 Elsevier Inc.

surface. The presence of polymerized vanadium species on the surface of silica not only has a detrimental influence on the propylene selectivity but also may exert a negative effect on catalyst activity, due to the presence of vanadium atoms nonaccessible to the propane reactant molecules.
From the above discussion, it is clear that in order to obtain more active and selective vanadium-based catalysts for ODH of propane one should achieve a high disper- sion of the vanadium oxide species at vanadium loadings as high as possible. Therefore, great efforts have been ded- icated toward the potential applications of high surface area materials as the supports for dispersing the vanadium atoms [11,12]. Recently, the new discovery of the family of siliceous mesostructured materials M41S has attracted much attention as catalyst supports since they possess high sur- face areas (> 800 m2 g1) as well as well-ordered hexagonal channels with controllable uniform pore sizes of 28 nm [13,14]. Regarding the various synthetic methods proposed for the synthesis of active and selective vanadium-containing MCM materials without collapse of the mesoporous struc- ture [1520], the conventional impregnation method has appeared to be more practical and attractive to obtain the highly active and selective VOx/MCM-41catalysts with in- creased amounts of vanadium species [20]. Solsona and co- workers have demonstrated that a higher concentration of isolated tetrahedral vanadium species was achieved with the MCM-41 support as compared with amorphous silica, re- sulting in a greater density of surface-active sites [20]. As a consequence, VOx/MCM catalysts displayed high produc- tivities, keeping high selectivities to propylene during the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane. Unfortunately, to the best of our knowledge, the yield of olefins from propane did not achieve above 30% over all catalyst systems reported up to now [1520].
Very recently, SBA-15, another new type of ordered mesoporous material achieved by using a triblock copoly- mer as structure-directing agent under strongly acidic condi- tions, has also attracted great attention in the field of cataly- sis [2126]. SBA-15 material possesses a high surface area (6001000 m2 g1) and is formed by a hexagonal array of uniform tubular channels with tunable pore diameters in the range of 530 nm which are significantly larger than those of MCM-41 [13]. Especially given its thicker walls (3164 Å), SBA-15 provides a thermal stability and hydrothermal sta- bility that exceed those for the thinner walled MCM-41 materials [27]. In a preliminary communication, we have re- ported that the use of mesoporous SBA-15 silica as a support can allow the generation of a highly efficient VOx-SBA-15 catalyst (see Scheme 1, Ref. [28]) exhibiting high selectiv- ities (80%) to olefins at high propane conversions (42%) in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane [28]. The intro- duction of vanadium species onto the inner walls of SBA-15 can provide new vanadium-containing catalysts with a large concentration of accessible, isolated, and structurally well- defined active sites for the ODH of propane [29]. The su- perior performance of the mesoporous VOx-SBA-15 cata- Scheme 1. lyst is related to the particular large pore diameter as well as a low surface acidity achieved in the SBA-15 catalysts [28,29]. However, a fundamental understanding of the na- ture and redox properties of the vanadium species anchored on the surface of the SBA-15 support, especially the role of the pore diameter of the catalyst during the selective oxida- tion of propane, remained to be established.
To gain a further insight into the dispersity and the nature of V species formed on SBA-15-supported vanadia catalysts (VOx-SBA-15), a detailed characterization of the vanadium incorporated SBA-15 catalysts by SEM/TEM, DR UVvis,51V NMR, H2-TPR, UV-Raman, and FTIR spectroscopy as well as their catalytic performance in the oxidative dehydro- genation of propane has been presented in this paper. The nature and redox properties of the VOx species anchored on the mesoporous SBA-15 carrier are also compared with those on MCM-41 and conventional SiO2 support.
2. Experimental
2.1. Catalyst preparation
A purely siliceous SBA-15 sample was prepared accord- ing to a literature procedure using Pluronic P123 triblock polymer (EO20PO70EO20, Mav = 5800, from Aldrich) as template under acidic conditions [21]. Briefly, a solution of
EO20PO70EO20:2 M HCl:TEOS:H2O = 2:60:4.25:15 (mass
ratio) was prepared, stirred for several hours at 40 C, and then hydrothermally treated at 95 C for 3 days. The solid products were recovered by filtering off. Then, the SBA-15 was dried overnight at 100 C. The occluded surfactant was removed by calcination at 600 C for 5 h in air, yielding the final mesoporous SBA-15 material.
SBA-supported vanadia catalysts were prepared by fol- lowing an alcoholic impregnation method [29]. A methanol solution of NH4VO3 to achieve a final V content of 1.0 to
9.0 wt% of V atoms was contacted with the SBA-15 carrier
at 60 C and the methanol was rotaevaporated until com- plete dryness. Then, the catalysts were dried overnight in air at 120 C, followed by calcination at 600 C for 4 h in air. The impregnated samples named by a number (denotes the V content in the calcined catalysts) followed by SBA are summarized in Table 1. Thus, sample named 2.8V-SBA is a SBA-15-supported catalyst with 2.8 wt% of V atoms. For comparison, vanadia catalysts supported on MCM-41 and amorphous silica (from Shanghai Super Chemical Material

2.2. Catalyst characterization
Nitrogen adsorption/desorption at 77 K were measured using a Micromeritics TriStar 3000 equipment after the sam- ples were degassed (1.33 × 102 Pa) at 300 C overnight.
The specific surface area was calculated following the method of Brunauer, Emmet, and Teller (BET). The method of Barret, Joyner, and Halenda (BJH) was used to determine the pore-size distribution (PSD).
X-ray diffraction patterns (XRD) were collected using a Germany Bruker D8Advance X-ray diffractometer equipped with a graphite monochromator, operating at 40 kV and 40 mA and employing nickel-filtered Cu-Kα radiation (λ =
1.5418 Å).
Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was recorded dig- itally on a Philips XL 30 microscope operating at 30 kV.
Before being transferred into the SEM chamber, the samples dispersed with ethanol were deposited on the sample holder and then quickly moved into the vacuum evaporator (LDM- 150D) in which a thin gold film was deposited after drying in vacuo.
Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was recorded digitally with a Gatan slow-scan charge-coupled device (CCD) camera on a JEOL 2011 electron microscope op- erating at 200 kV. The samples were prepared by dispersing the powder products as a slurry in acetone, which was then deposited and dried on a holey carbon film on a Cu grid.
Diffuse reflectance UVvis spectra were collected on a Varian Cary 5 spectrophotometer equipped with a Pray- ing Mantis attachment from Harrick. The sample cell was equipped with a heater unit, a thermocouple, and a gas flow system for in situ measurements. The samples were dehy- drated in situ in dry air at 400 C for 30 min. The spectra were recorded upon cooling down to room temperature, with dry air flowing through the sample to avoid the rehydra- tion processes. The absorption edge energies for dehydrated spectra were determined by finding the intercept of the straight line in the low-energy rise of a plot of [F(R)hν]1/2 against hν [8,9], where F(R) is a KubelkaMunk func- tion [30], hν is the energy of the incident photon.
Prior to recording of the 51V nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra, the samples were treated under dynamic vacuum at 100 C overnight and then transferred and sealed into the rotor in a glove box under an atmosphere of nitro- gen. Solid-state 51V NMR spectra were recorded at 7.05 T at ambient temperature on a Bruker AVAVCE DSX 300 spec- trometer at 78.9 MHz, using a high-speed MAS Doty super- sonic probe (zirconia rotors with 5 mm in diameter). Short excitation pulses of 1 s duration and recycle delays of 1 s were applied. The chemical shifts are given in ppm related to VOCl3.
In situ laser Raman spectra were obtained using a confo- cal microprobe Jobin Yvon Lab Ram Infinity Raman system equipped with both UV and visible excitation lines. The UV- Raman measurements were carried out using the UV line at 325 nm from a Kimmon IK3201R-F HeCd laser as the exciting source, where a laser output of 30 mW was used and the maximum incident power at the sample was approx- imately 6 mW. The sample was loaded in an in situ cell and was treated in dry airflow at 500 C for 1 h for dehydration.
All spectra were recorded at 200 C in N2 gas flow with a resolution of 4 cm1.
Temperature-programmed reduction (TPR) spectra were obtained on a homemade apparatus loaded with 100 mg of catalyst [31]. The samples were pretreated in flowing air at 600 C for 2 h in order to ensure complete oxidation. Then the samples were cooled to room temperature in argon. The samples were subsequently contacted with an H2/Ar mixture (H2/Ar molar ratio of 5/95 and a total flow of 40 ml min1) and heated, at a rate of 10 C min1, to a final temperature of 800 C. The H2 consumption was monitored using a TCD detector.
In order to characterize the acidity of the catalysts, spectra in the OH vibration region as well as spectra of chemisorbed pyridine were monitored on a Bruker Vector 22 spectrometer using self-supporting wafers in a heatable IR gas cell [32].
The samples were pretreated at 450 C for 1 h under vacuum prior to pyridine adsorption. Pyridine was adsorbed at room temperature from an argon flow containing 2 vol% pyri- 420

dine. Then, the samples were heated to 100 C and evacuated to remove physisorbed and weakly chemisorbed pyridine.
Temperature-programmed desorption of the adsorbed pyri- dine starting at 100 C was studied by stepwise heating of the sample under vacuum to characterize the strength of the acid sites. Difference spectra were obtained by subtracting the background (base spectrum) of the unloaded sample.
2.3. Catalytic tests
The catalytic experiments were carried out in a fixed- bed quartz tubular flow reactor (i.d. 6 mm, length 400 mm) at atmospheric pressure [29,31]. The reactor was equipped with a coaxial thermocouple for catalytic bed temperature monitoring. Catalyst samples (6080 mesh) were introduced into the reactor and diluted with 300 mg quartz powder (4060 mesh) to keep a constant volume in the catalyst bed.
The flow rate and the amount of the catalyst were varied to achieve different propane conversion levels. The feed con- sisted of a mixture of propane/oxygen/nitrogen with a molar ratio of 1/1/4. Experiments were carried out at 600 C to achieve the higher selectivity to partial oxidation products.
The feed and the reaction products were analyzed on-line by online gas chromatograph (Type GC-122, Shanghai). Per- manent gases (N2, O2, CO, CO2) were separated using a TDX-01 column connected to a TCD detector and other reaction products were analyzed employing a Porapak Q col- umn connected to a FID detector. Blank runs show that under the experimental conditions used in this work the homoge- neous reaction could be neglected.
3. Results
3.1. Catalysts characterization
SBA-15-supported vanadia samples (V loadings from 1.0 to 9.0 wt%) present well-defined XRD patterns correspond- ing to SBA-15 structures (Fig. 1), implying that all catalysts prepared by alcoholic impregnation have ordered hexagonal mesostructures. However, a shift of the diffraction peaks to higher 2θ values is identified for the V-SBA samples, pos- sibly due to a contraction of their frameworks with increas- ing vanadium loading during the calcination procedure [29].
Moreover, it is seen that the intensity of the d100 peak is gradually attenuated (inset to Fig. 1) with increasing V load- ing in the XRD patterns of the samples. The reduction of the reflections may be caused by a degradation of the hexago- nal arrangement of SBA-15 pores [12,20]. The hexagonal arrangement of the SBA-15 frameworks was retained af- ter vanadia incorporation, as could be seen from TEM and N2-adsorption data presented as follows. Thus, the progres- sive reduction of the d100 reflections in the present case is more likely due to a dilution of silica with continuous incor- poration of vanadia as a consequence of higher absorption factor for X-rays than silicon [26]. The absorption of X-rays Fig. 1. Low-angle X-ray diffraction patterns of calcined SBA-15-supported vanadia catalysts: (a) SBA-15; (b) 1.0V-SBA; (c) 2.8V-SBA; (d) 4.5V-SBA;(e) 9.0V-SBA. by vanadia was indeed very significant, as inferred from strong reduction of the main beam intensity.
SEM image (Fig. 2a) reveals that the as-synthesized parent SBA-15 sample consists of well-defined wheat-like macro-structures aggregated with rope-like domains with relatively uniform sizes of 1 m [21]. After vanadium incor- poration, a significant degradation in macroscopic structure occurred; however, the rope-like domains with average sizes of 1 m were still largely maintained (Figs. 2c anf 2e). TEM images (Figs. 2b, 2d, and 2f) of all SBA-15 samples (in- cluding different V loadings) show well-ordered hexagonal arrays of mesopores (1D channels) and unambiguously con- firm that the hexagonal pore structure of the SBA-15 was robust enough to survive the vanadium incorporation process and so offers a good matrix to support highly dispersed vana- dium species.
The maintenance of ordered hexagonal arrangement of the SBA-15 frameworks upon vanadium introduction is fur- ther supported by the N2-adsorption data. Although the in- corporation of vanadia into SBA-15 led to a continuous de- crease of the specific surface area and the cumulative pore volume (Table 1), high surface areas (SBET) and pore vol- umes as well as very narrow pore-size distributions are ob- served in SBA-15-supported materials with V loading up to 9 wt%. A similar decrease of the SBET and pore volume has already been reported by Berndt et al. for mesoporous V-containing MCM materials [33]. Thus, it can be concluded that well-organized mesoporous SBA-15 catalysts with a high surface area could be obtained at all V loadings in the present study.

Considering that the nature of the vanadium supported on siliceous materials is highly moisture sensitive [3436], to identify the exact vanadium environment, diffuse reflectance spectra in the UVvis region of SBA-15-supported samples were recorded in the dehydrated state. Fig. 3 shows the dif- fuse reflectance UVvis spectra of calcined VOx/SBA sam- ples after dehydration under dry air at 450 C (Fig. 3A) and after rehydration at room temperature (Fig. 3B), the absorp- tion edge energies for dehydrated spectra are also included.
In the dehydrated samples, a decrease of the energy with increasing vanadium content is identified, reflecting an in- crease in the size and dimensionality of VOx domains as vanadium surface density increases [8,9]. The presence of a very broad band centered at ca. 300 nm is also observed.
A deconvolution of this band reveals two main absorption features at 250 and 320 nm corresponding to isolated V sites in tetrahedral coordination and polymeric VOV species,respectively [20,33,3538]. As the vanadium content in- creases, one can observe an increase of the intensity of the band at 320 nm with respect to the absorption appearing at 250 nm, resulting in a progressive shift of the overlap- ping band toward a higher wavelength. In addition, a new feature at 450 nm appears for the samples with 4.5 wt% V loading, pointing to the presence of bulk-like V2O5 crys- tallites due to a further polymerization of the V species [20,3538]. The presence of these three bands has also been re- ported in vanadia catalysts supported on MCM-41 or silica [20,3538]. Thus, the present observation of the increase of the relative intensities of the absorptions at 320 and 450 nm with increasing vanadium content can be attributed to the presence of vanadium species with a larger polymerization degree at high V loadings. 51V NMR has been shown to be a powerful technique in the characterization of the local coordination environ- ment of V5+ cations in the supported vanadium oxide cata- lysts. Comparisons of the NMR spectra of the catalysts with model compounds can a provide an opportunity to extract additional information about the symmetry environment of vanadium sites in the vanadium-containing SBA-15 cata- lysts [39,40]. Fig. 4 shows the 51V wide-line NMR spectra of calcined 2.8V-SBA and 4.5V-SBA catalysts dehydrated and after hydration by exposing them to ambient air for 2 days.
The NMR spectra of the dehydrated catalysts 2.8V-SBA (Fig 4a) and 4.5V-SBA (Fig. 4c) consist of a resonance at ca. 422

460 and 470 ppm, respectively, which can be attributed to distorted isolated tetrahedral V5+ of type (SiO)3VO, in agreement with previous studies on VOx/SiO2 [40,41] and V-containing mesoporous MCM materials [20,33,35]. How- ever, on consideration of the UVvis results, the contribution of low polymeric V5+ sites to the NMR signals of the dehy- drated 2.8V-SBA (Fig. 4a) and 4.5V-SBA (Fig. 4c) cannot be excluded. A weak signal at 300 ppm appears in the spec- trum of the dehydrated sample 4.5V-SBA (Fig. 4c), which is generally assigned to the V5+ in a distorted octahedral or pseudo-octahedral symmetry as in V2O5 [20,39]. The exis- tence of octahedral V5+ after dehydration could be due to the formation of a bulk-like surface oxide phase at higher vanadium content.
After hydration, two main signals, at 300 ppm and an- other one at ca. 530 and 570 ppm for 2.8V-SBA (Fig. 4b) and 4.5V-SBA (Fig. 4d), respectively, are registered in the NMR spectra. In agreement with previous publications the wide-line spectrum can be interpreted as the contribution of two different signals [39,42,43]. The low-field peak in the spectra indicates the presence of vanadium in octahedral co- ordination; however, due to distortion of the spectrum we cannot establish the symmetry of this octahedral site [44].
The appearance of this signal after hydration suggests that a part of the tetrahedral vanadium coordinates to two (or one) extra water molecules to produce octahedral (or pseudo- octahedral) coordination. This species is proposed to be of the (SiO)3V=O(H2O)2 type for isolated V5+ species [20].
This suggestion is further supported by comparing the UV vis spectra of the dehydrated 2.8V-SBA and 4.5V-SBA cat- alysts with those obtained in their rehydrated state, where it can be seen that upon hydration a new band at 380 nm appears which can be unambiguously assigned to pseudo- octahedrically coordinated V5+ species as a consequence of the interaction of tetrahedral sites with two molecules of water [20]. Interestingly, the presence of the absorption at 320 nm in the UVvis spectra of the hydrated samples suggests that a portion of the V species remains in pure tetra- hedral coordination. This indicates the existence of nonac- cessible tetrahedral V species incorporated within the pore walls of the siliceous SBA-15 structure, in accordance with previous studies on V-containing mesoporous MCM materi- als [20,33]. The second signal, characterized by a maximum between 500 and 600 ppm (at ca. 530 or 570 ppm) possessing a low anisotropy of the chemical shift, dominates the wide-line spectrum. Comparison with model compounds allows us to attribute this signal to the presence of polymeric tetrahedral vanadium sites [39,40], although it appears at a different position from that in the dehydrated catalysts.
UV resonance Raman spectroscopy has recently been shown to be another powerful technique for the study of various catalytic materials, especially for the identification of the molecular structure of isolated transition metal atoms anchored on the surface of metal oxides [4549]. The reso- nance Raman effect may provide opportunity to selectively enhance the intensity of the Raman signal by several orders of magnitude when the excitation laser line is close to the electronic transition absorption of the samples [46]. Fig. 5 shows the UV-Raman spectra excited by a 325-nm line of the V-containing samples, which are significantly different from the visible Raman spectra as previously reported [29].
The measurements were performed at 200 C in N2 gas flow

As shown in Fig. 5, the Raman bands at 336, 466, 920, 1018, and 2036 cm1 are observed for the V-SBA samples with V content of 1.0 and 2.8 wt%.
The band at 460 cm1 is associated with the vibration of the siloxane rings of siliceous SBA-15 [49]. The 335 and 920 cm1 bands are assigned to the bending mode of the VOV bond and symmetric OVO stretching of the poly- meric vanadia species, respectively [47,50]. The 1018 cm1 band is attributed to the symmetric stretching mode of the V=O bond of the isolated tetrahedral VO4 species anchored on SBA-15. The bands at 1018 and 2036 cm1 are, respec- tively, the fundamental and double-frequency bands of the tetrahedral V=O bonds because the frequencies of the latter are approximately double at 1018 cm1 [48]. To the best of our knowledge, the 2036 cm1 band was never detected in visible Raman spectra for supported vanadia because there is no resonance effect in the visible region.
The absence of a typical band at ca. 990 cm1 of V2O5 in Fig. 5a and 5b implies that no crystalline V2O5 is formed in V-SBA samples with V content lower than 2.8 wt%. This suggests that the vanadium species in V-SBA samples are isolated or, at least, highly dispersed on the surface [29]. In comparison, an additional shoulder band at ca. 990 cm1 was observed in Fig. 5c for the 2.8VSiO2 and 2.8V-MCM samples, suggesting the existence of crystalline V2O5 in these two samples. On the other hand, a decrease in the rel- ative intensity for the V=O overtone stretching with respect to the fundamental frequency band of the V=O band has been observed for the V-SBA sample with increasing V con- tent.

Thus, the present observation of the decrease in the relative intensity for the V=O overtone stretching with increasing vanadium content over V-SBA samples is possi- bly due to a negative effect of enhanced absorption in the ultraviolet region by the 2.8V-SBA sample as a consequence of fewer scatters sampled by the laser beam [47]. It is worth noting that a variation of the relative intensity for the V=O overtone stretching with respect to the fundamental band has also been identified for the vanadium (2.8 wt%) catalysts supported on siliceous SBA-15, MCM-41, and amorphous SiO2, further confirming the different polymerization degree of dispersed vanadia species achievable over the different siliceous materials.
Pyridine adsorption was followed by infrared spec- troscopy to identify the number and nature of acid sites in SBA-15-supported catalysts. Fig. 6 shows the FTIR spec- tra of the catalysts after pyridine adsorption and subsequent evacuation at 150 C. In the spectrum of the parent SBA-15 a band at 1445 cm1 appears and is assigned to pyridine coordinatively bound to defect sites of a distorted silica network as weak acidic Lewis sites [51], or to hydrogen- bonded pyridine [52]. The spectrum of the two catalysts with vanadium content lower than 2.8 wt% additionally show a weak band at 1545 cm1 which can be attributed to pyridine cations formed on acidic VOH groups (Brnsted sites) [33].

the MCM-41 has been previously discussed by Grubert et al., who studied the reduction mechanism of VOx species on MCM-41 [53]. Additional bands at 1490 and around 1600 cm1, associated with the presence of pyridine, are also observed in all the catalysts. However, their assignment to a specific type of acid sites is not clear [33]. Moreover, it is found that the Lewis acid sites due to parent SBA-15 de- crease substantially upon the initial anchoring of vanadium onto the support surface. Nevertheless, it is seen that the number of acid sites increases with increasing vanadia con- tent for the vanadium-containing catalysts, suggesting the formation of new type of Lewis acid sites on the V-SBA-15 samples. Thus, for the SBA-15-supported vanadia catalysts studied here, the number of both Lewis acid sites and Brn- sted acid sites increases with vanadium loading. According to this and based on previous results, it can be concluded that both the Lewis acid sites and the Brnsted acid sites ev- idenced over the V-SBA catalysts are related to vanadium oxide incorporation.
Meanwhile, a close comparison of the spectra for the
2.8V-SBA sample with those for 2.8V-MCM and 2.8VSiO2
catalysts in Fig. 6 reveals that at the same V loading level the total number of both the Lewis acid sites and Brn- sted acid sites is much lower on the SBA-15 catalyst than its MCM-41 or conventional SiO2 counterparts. Moreover,the temperature-programmed pyridine desorption showed that pyridine adsorbed on V-SBA samples was completely removed at 200 C already. In contrast, the complete re- moval of the pyridine adsorbed on V-containing MCM-41 and conventional SiO2 samples could only be achieved at temperature well above 250 C. Thus, the temperature- programmed pyridine desorption reveals a relatively mod- erate acid strength of the Brnsted and Lewis sites on the V-SBA catalysts.
The TPR profiles of V-SBA catalysts are comparatively shown in Fig. 7 and their main features summarized in Ta- ble 1. One sharp peak at ca. 500 C is observed on SBA- supported samples with V loadings from 1.0 to 2.8 wt%.
In the sample with high V content (4.5V-SBA) the main peak becomes broader and shifted to 526 C with a shoul- der appearing at 590 C (Fig. 7d). By analogy with previous studies on the reducibility of VOx/SiO2 and V-containing mesoporous materials [5,17,33,36], the peak at low temper- ature is attributed to the reduction of dispersed tetrahedral vanadium species, while the peak at 590 C to the reduction of polymeric V5+ species V2O5-like. The progressive shift of the maximum of the H2 consumption peak to high tem- perature with the V loading suggests a progressive formation of less reducible high polymeric vanadium species.
Moreover, the high temperature shoulder at 590 C is also identified in the sample 2.8V-MCM (Fig. 7e), which is more evident for the 2.8VSiO2 sample (Fig. 7f), suggest- ing the presence of V2O5-like polymeric vanadium species over these two samples. This observation is in sharp contrast to the reduction pattern as observed for sample 2.8V-SBA (Fig. 7c). Thus, the present H2-TPR results further confirm Fig. 7. H2-TPR results of SBA-15-supported vanadium oxide catalysts:(a) 1.0V-SBA; (b) 1.8V-SBA; (c) 2.8V-SBA; (d) 4.5V-SBA; (e) 2.8V-MCM;(f) 2.8VSiO2. that the formation of highly dispersed vanadium species is more favored over the surface of SBA-15. On the other hand,in consideration of a total V5+-to-V3+ reduction for every H2 molecule consumed, the average oxidation state (AOS) after H2 reduction has been calculated and included in Ta- ble 1. It can be seen that the average oxidation state of vanadium in the reduced catalysts decreases as the V loading increases, and a sharp decrease of the AOS value from ap- proximately 4 to 3 is observed for sample 9.0V-SBA. These results strongly suggest that bulk type V2O5 species could be reduced to a greater extent than isolated tetrahedral vana- dium sites [33].
3.2. Catalytic tests in oxidative dehydrogenation of
propane The catalytic results obtained in the oxidative dehydro- genation of propane at 600 C over SBA-15-supported vana- dium oxide catalysts are shown in Table 2. Propylene, and carbon oxides (CO and CO2) were the main reaction prod- ucts during the ODH of propane on SBA-supported vanadia catalysts (Table 2). It is observed that propane could only be poorly converted over parent SBA-15, whereas the introduc- tion of V remarkably enhanced propane conversion and the selectivity for partial oxidation products [28,29]. Propylene is formed with high selectivity over the SBA-15 catalysts with higher V content and the propylene yield is compara- ble with that obtained over VMgO catalysts [6]. As shown in Table 2, the SBA-15 catalysts with low V contents would result in the formation of an appreciable amount of acrolein.
Similar catalytic behavior has been observed over V cat- alysts supported on mesoporous silica such as MCM-41 and HMS [5,12]. It should be noted that ethylene was also

It is remarkable that olefin selectivity up to 80% at a high propane conversion of 41.7% could be achieved over the catalyst of 2.8V-SBA.
It is also clear from Table 2 that the 2.8V-SBA cata- lyst exhibited much higher propane conversion and selec- tivity to olefins than those of mesoporous 2.8V-MCM and amorphous 2.8VSiO2. The high selectivity to olefins on the former could be related to their highly dispersed vanadium species on the large surface of SBA-15 with a large pore diameter as described above. In a comparison of three dif- ferent silica supports, it is observed that mesoporous silica (MCM-41 and SBA-15) with high surface area are more ef- fective, as demonstrated by the higher activities observed for these supports. Additionally, with a similar V content, SBA-15 is much superior to MCM-41 as a support.
The catalytic activity of the V-SBA catalysts is found to be strongly dependent on the reaction temperature. It is known that high reaction temperatures favor higher selec- tivities to olefin products when the ODH reaction is carried out on V-containing catalysts. As a result, the reaction was mainly studied at 600 C. Fig. 8a shows the variation of propane conversion with the V loading. It can be seen that propane conversion initially increases with the incorporation of vanadium, whereas the highest activity for propane con- version is achieved on the catalyst with vanadium content of
2.8 wt%. The turnover frequencies (TOF) of the olefin prod-
uct of propylene and ethylene with the V loading are also compared in Fig. 8. It can be seen that the intrinsic rates of formation for propylene decreases with the vanadium load- ing (Fig. 8b). In comparison, a remarkably different variation behavior (Fig. 8c) with increasing V-containing has been ob- served for the intrinsic rates of formation for ethylene. The TOF value for ethylene formation shows a maximum on cat- alysts with vanadium content of 2.8 wt%, demonstrating that the ethylene formation via the oxidative cracking of propane could be achieved much more efficiently over the 2.8V-SBA catalyst.
To further investigate the influence of the vanadium con- tents on the catalytic behavior of the SBA-15 catalysts, the variation of the selectivities to the main products with vana- Fig. 8.

It is interesting to find that the selectiv- ity to propylene and ethylene shows a maximum on catalysts with a vanadium content of 2.8 wt%, which is quite different from the results obtained over V-HMS [12] or V-MCM-41 catalysts reported by Solsona et al. [20]. However, the selec- tivity to carbon oxides (COx) changes in a different way by attaining the lowest value over the 2.8V-SBA catalyst. This unique behavior for the selectivity to the undesirable deep oxidation products (COx) implies that the vanadium surface density is a quite important parameter for tuning the behav- ior of the selective oxidation of propane over the vanadia species supported on mesoporous SBA-15.
Fig. 10 compares the variation behavior of the selectivity to propylene with the propane conversion on the vanadia dis- persed on the three different siliceous supports at the same V loading level of 2.8 wt%.

V-containing samples. By correlation with the pore-size dis- tribution data included in the inset to Fig. 10, it could be found that the V-containing mesoporous SBA-15 is more active and selective with respect to V-MCM-41 or VSiO2 catalysts because its favorable large mesopore diameter lim- its the consecutive reaction of propylene or allylic inter- mediates leading to deep oxidation. In a recent adsorption equilibrium investigation of the diffusion of light hydro- carbons on silica gel, Grande and Rodrigues demonstrated that the mass transfer of propylene in the narrow-pore silica gel with average pore diameter of 4 nm was mainly con- trolled by Knudsen diffusion [54]. Assuming a calculation of the Knudsen diffusivity (Dk) for propylene diffusion by Dk = 9700 rp(T/M)1/2, where rp is the pore radius and M is the molecular weight of the adsorbate, the mesoporous cata- lyst with a larger pore diameter would have a larger Dk value for propylene diffusion, thus favorable for the discharging of the produced propylene to the outside of the pore, conse- quently preventing the subsequent deep oxidation.
4. Discussion
In this work a novel catalyst system VOx-SBA-15 pre- pared by using well-organized hexagonal mesoporous sili- ceous SBA-15 as the support for the oxidative dehydrogena- tion of propane has been investigated in detail. Previous reported results show that the incorporation of vanadium in mesoporous MCM-41 or HMS materials allows the dis- persion of a higher amount of isolated and low polymeric vanadium species on the support surface as compared to the conventional SiO2 support, thus leading to an improved selectivity to propylene during the oxidative dehydrogena- tion of propane [12,33]. The present results show that the amount of dispersed vanadium ions can be further increased on SBA-15, thus yielding a more selective vanadium-based catalyst for ODH of propane.
Investigation by means of UVvis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy has confirmed that at low V content (be- low 2.8 wt%), the surface of V-SBA is mainly covered by highly dispersed tetrahedral V5+ species and low polymeric VOV entities. At higher V loading, polymeric vanadium species become more abundant, and at 4.5 wt%, octahe- dral V5+ forming the oxide phase also appears. The 51V NMR results of the dehydrated 2.8V-SBA and 4.5V-SBA catalysts confirm that most vanadium cations are tetrahe- drally coordinated and that a V2O5-like phase begins to appear in the 4.5V-SBA sample. The 51V MAS NMR and UVvis spectra of the samples recorded under ambient con- ditions show that most vanadium species are able to coordi- nate additional water molecules and therefore are located in easily accessible sites. The vanadium species remain- ing in tetrahedral coordination in the presence of moisture has been attributed to nonaccessible V5+ cations buried in the framework of the pore walls. Similar UVvis and 51V MAS NMR spectra have been reported previously in V-containing MCM-41 or V-substituted MCM-41 [5,17,20,55,56] and also on SiO2-supported vanadia [10,57,58] or V-silicate [32,59,60]. Therefore, the nature of the vanadium species formed on siliceous or mesoporous SBA-15 supports must be similar.
The TPR results show that the reducibility of the iso- lated V5+ species anchored on the pore walls of the SBA-15 support, which are predominant at low V content, is similar to that reported for this species on MCM-41 and SiO2 [10,20,5658]. Polymeric V5+ species and/or V2O5 crystallites,formed on catalysts with V loading higher than 2.8 wt%,

427 are more difficult to reduce. Again, the reducibility behav- ior of vanadium oxide supported on mesoporous SBA-15 suggests that the same type of vanadium species observed on V-MCM-41 and VSiO2 catalysts is formed on SBA-15 support. Such a result is consistent with the conclusion from UVvis and 51V MAS NMR measurements described above.
Compared to the visible Raman spectra as reported in our preceding paper [29], the present UV-Raman spec- tra of the V-SBA samples show significant differences in the 8501050 cm1 range. The intense Raman band at 1018 cm1 associated with the terminal V=O stretches of isolated tetrahedral VO4 species in the present UV-Raman spectra has a different band position as the relatively weaker band at 1036 cm1 observed in visible Raman spectra for the V-SBA samples [29]. The difference in Raman shift of these two bands could be due to two type of mono-oxo vanadium species, and the species with a V=O stretch at a lower Ra- man shift is preferentially resonance enhanced under UV ex- citation [46]. A similar observation for the presence of three kinds of tetrahedral V5+ species has recently been reported by Dzwigaj et al. [61], where a combined DR UVvis and photoluminescencespectroscopic investigation has been em- ployed to distinguish the different kinds of tetrahedral vana- dium species incorporated in VSiβ zeolites. On the other hand, according to the empirical relationship between V=O bond lengths and Raman stretching frequencies, a lower fre- quency corresponds to longer V=O bonds [48]. Therefore,the present band with a lower frequency at 1018 cm1 corre- sponds to a longer V=O bond distance, providing evidence for the presence of isolated mono-oxo vanadate species of a tetrahedral structure with a weaker structural tension. This structure could be preferentially resonance enhanced by the 325-nm line excitation, thus leading to the appearance of well-defined overtone bands characteristic of the V=O bond at ca. 2036 cm1.
Characterization by FTIR/pyridine adsorption has con- firmed the formation of VOH groups corresponding to weak acidic Brnsted sites as well as the generation of new Lewis acid sites over the vanadium-containing VSBA samples. This result indicates that incorporation of vana- dium provokes a moderate development of acidity [5]. More- over, the temperature-programmed pyridine desorption re- veals that both the strength and the density of the acid sites on the V-SBA sample are much weaker/or lower compared with the V-MCM and VSiO2 samples, suggesting the weak nature of the acid sites developed on the V-loaded SBA-15 catalysts. Takehira and co-workers have proposed that the formation of deep oxidation products (COx) is closely re- lated to the interaction of propylene or allylic intermediates with surface medium acid sites during the ODH of propane over MCM-41-supported vanadia catalysts [19]. Thus, it is conceivable that the desorption of target product of C3H6 would be facile over the V-SBA catalyst without surface medium acid sites.
Isolated tetrahedral V5+ species appear to be the selec- tive sites in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane, as previously proposed in V-MCM-41 systems, V-containing microporous materials, or supported vanadia catalysts [5,12,17,32]. The polymerization degree of the surface vanadia species and the appearance of V2O5 crystallites have a sig- nificant effect on the selectivity to propylene. As has been suggested, the surface propyl species or adsorbed propylene may react over two V atoms of VOV species favoring the consecutive reactions and decreasing the selectivity to propylene from propane [6,62]. Thus, the present superior performance of the V-SBA catalysts in the oxidative dehy- drogenation of propane is a consequence of the greater den- sity of active species with a lower surface acidity achieved on the surface of the SBA-15 support as suggested from the detailed characterization results presented above.
5. Conclusions
This work presents a detailed study of the effect of V con- tent on the nature of the VOx species anchored on the surface of the SBA-15-supported vanadia catalysts. The results show that the V-containing SBA-15 catalysts possess a unique textural feature of high surface area as well as the well- organized mesoporous structures with large pore diameters.
The comparative study of the V-SBA and V-MCM-41 and the conventional VSiO2 catalysts has shown that a higher concentration of isolated V species is readily achievable on the surface of the SBA-15 support. Moreover, a much weaker and lower acidity of the surface acid sites is observed for the vanadium-incorporated SBA-15 catalysts. The high dispersion of vanadium species achievable on the SBA-15 support with large pore diameters as well as the relatively low surface acidity of the catalyst is considered to be re- sponsible for the superior catalytic behavior of the V-SBA catalyst in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane.
