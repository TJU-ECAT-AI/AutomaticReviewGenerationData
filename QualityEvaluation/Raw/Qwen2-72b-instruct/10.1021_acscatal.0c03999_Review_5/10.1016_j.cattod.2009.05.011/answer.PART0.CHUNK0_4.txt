[1] "Zinc modified HZSM-5 materials with lower Si/Al ratios (generally below 35) are known to be another kind of effective catalysts for the production of aromatics from light alkanes [15,16]."
[2] "The reaction mechanism is thought to consist of a complex scheme involving dehydrogenation, oligomerization and ring- closure steps."
[3] "The modifying zinc cations play a key role in the dehydrogenation of light paraffins, which is quite similar to that of gallium species in Ga-promoted HZSM-5 catalysts [1727]."
[4] "This suggests that ZnO/HZSM-5 could be also a promising catalyst for the dehydrogenation of propane to propene in the presence of CO2 if the acidity of the HZSM-5 support is decreased."
[5] "The acidity of HZSM-5 supported zinc oxide catalysts was investigated by the NH3-TPD method, and the results are summarized in Table 2."
[6] "The number of weak and strong acid sites decreases quickly with increasing the Si/Al ratio of the support from 60 to 201, and diminishes a bit with further increase of the Si/Al ratio from 201 to 242."
[7] "The initial propane conversion decreases as the Si/Al ratio increases, suggesting that the acidities of the supported zinc oxide catalysts have a great effect on their dehydrogenation activity."
[8] "The decreasing rate of the catalytic activity becomes lower for those catalysts with Si/Al ratio higher than 160,indicating that the catalyst stability improves as the catalyst acidity decreases."
[9] "Thus, appropriate amount of acid sites is critical for gaining an optimal result, and this goal is achieved in the case of ZnO/HZSM-5(160) in our present study."

1.Zeolites, such as HZSM-5, are promising support materials for CO2-ODHP catalysts due to their high surface area, micropore volume, and tunable acidity. Dealumination and weakening methods, such as increasing the Si/Al ratio, can modify the acidity of zeolites, which is crucial for optimizing catalytic performance. These modifications contribute to enhancing the dehydrogenation activity of light paraffins by creating a suitable environment for the reaction mechanism involving dehydrogenation, oligomerization, and ring closure steps. The key considerations in selecting and implementing these strategies for different types of zeolites used as supports include the balance between acidity and stability, the compatibility with the active metal species, and the effect on the selectivity and yield of the desired products. For instance, ZnO/HZSM-5 catalysts with a Si/Al ratio of 160 exhibit the best performance for propane dehydrogenation to propene in the presence of CO2, achieving a propane conversion of 41.5% and a propene yield of 25.8% at steady state. This is attributed to the appropriate amount of acid sites that promote the dehydrogenation reaction while suppressing side reactions such as cracking, oligomerization, and aromatization.

1.沸石，如HZSM-5，是CO2-ODHP催化剂有希望的支撑材料，因为它们具有高表面积、微孔体积和可调酸性。脱铝和弱化方法，如提高Si/Al比，可以改变沸石的酸性，这对优化催化性能至关重要。这些修改通过为涉及脱氢、寡聚化和环闭合步骤的反应机制创造合适的环境，有助于增强轻质石蜡的脱氢活性。在为不同类型的用作支撑的沸石选择和实施这些策略时，主要考虑因素包括酸性和稳定性的平衡、与活性金属物种的兼容性以及对所需产品选择性和产量的影响。例如，Si/Al比为160的ZnO/HZSM-5催化剂在CO2存在下丙烷脱氢制丙烯方面表现出最佳性能，实现了41.5%的丙烷转化率和25.8%的丙烯产量。这归因于适量的酸性位点，它们促进脱氢反应，同时抑制裂化、寡聚化和芳构化等副反应。
