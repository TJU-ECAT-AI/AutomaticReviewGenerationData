[1] "Zinc modified HZSM-5 materials with lower Si/Al ratios (generally below 35) are known to be another kind of effective catalysts for the production of aromatics from light alkanes [15,16]."
[2] "The reaction mechanism is thought to consist of a complex scheme involving dehydrogenation, oligomerization and ring- closure steps."
[3] "The modifying zinc cations play a key role in the dehydrogenation of light paraffins, which is quite similar to that of gallium species in Ga-promoted HZSM-5 catalysts [1727]."
[4] "This suggests that ZnO/HZSM-5 could be also a promising catalyst for the dehydrogenation of propane to propene in the presence of CO2 if the acidity of the HZSM-5 support is decreased."
[5] "However, there is little report focused on this so far."
[6] "The acidity of HZSM-5 supported zinc oxide catalysts was investigated by the NH3-TPD method, and the results are summarized in Table 2."
[7] "The number of weak and strong acid sites decreases quickly with increasing the Si/Al ratio of the support from 60 to 201, and diminishes a bit with further increase of the Si/Al ratio from 201 to 242."
[8] "As the Si/Al ratio of the HZSM-5 support increases, the amounts of both Lewis and Brnsted sites decrease, which is consistent with the NH3-TPD results."
[9] "When the Si/Al ratio reaches 201 and above, Brnsted acidity is undetectable."
[10] "The initial activity of HZSM-5 supported zinc oxide catalysts decreases with increasing the Si/Al ratio, while the stability and the propene selectivity improve."
[11] "The enhancement of the catalyst stability with increasing the Si/Al ratio of the HZSM-5 support originates from the decrease in acidity of the catalysts, as revealed by the results of NH3-TPD and FT-IR spectra of pyridine adsorption, which leads to the suppression of the side reactions, such as cracking, oligomerization and aromatization."

1.Zeolites, such as HZSM-5, are promising support materials for CO2-ODHP catalysts due to their high surface area, micropore volume, and tunable acidity. Dealumination and weakening methods can modify the acidity of zeolites, which is crucial for optimizing catalytic performance. Dealumination, which involves removing aluminum from the zeolite framework, can decrease the number of strong acid sites, leading to improved stability and selectivity. Weakening methods, such as increasing the Si/Al ratio, can also reduce the acidity, resulting in the suppression of side reactions like cracking, oligomerization, and aromatization. The key considerations in selecting and implementing these strategies include the type of zeolite, the desired reaction, and the balance between activity and selectivity. For instance, ZnO/HZSM-5 catalysts with high Si/Al ratios show enhanced stability and propene selectivity due to the decreased acidity, which inhibits side reactions and improves the overall catalytic performance.

1.沸石，如HZSM-5，是CO2-ODHP催化剂有前景的支撑材料，因为它们具有高表面积、微孔体积和可调酸性。脱铝和弱化方法可以修改沸石的酸性，这对优化催化性能至关重要。脱铝，涉及从沸石框架中去除铝，可以减少强酸位点的数量，从而提高稳定性和选择性。弱化方法，如增加Si/Al比，也可以降低酸性，导致抑制裂化、寡聚化和芳构化等副反应。在选择和实施这些策略时，关键考虑因素包括沸石的类型、所需的反应以及活性和选择性之间的平衡。例如，高Si/Al比的ZnO/HZSM-5催化剂由于酸性降低，显示出增强的稳定性和丙烯选择性，这抑制了副反应，提高了整体催化性能。
