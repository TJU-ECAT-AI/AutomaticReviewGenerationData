[1] "Zinc modified HZSM-5 materials with lower Si/Al ratios (generally below 35) are known to be another kind of effective catalysts for the production of aromatics from light alkanes [15,16]."
[2] "The reaction mechanism is thought to consist of a complex scheme involving dehydrogenation, oligomerization and ring- closure steps."
[3] "The modifying zinc cations play a key role in the dehydrogenation of light paraffins, which is quite similar to that of gallium species in Ga-promoted HZSM-5 catalysts [1727]."
[4] "This suggests that ZnO/HZSM-5 could be also a promising catalyst for the dehydrogenation of propane to propene in the presence of CO2 if the acidity of the HZSM-5 support is decreased."
[5] "However, there is little report focused on this so far."
[6] "The acidity of HZSM-5 supported zinc oxide catalysts was investigated by the NH3-TPD method, and the results are summarized in Table 2."
[7] "The number of weak and strong acid sites decreases quickly with increasing the Si/Al ratio of the support from 60 to 201, and diminishes a bit with further increase of the Si/Al ratio from 201 to 242."
[8] "As the Si/Al ratio of the HZSM-5 support increases, the amounts of both Lewis and Brnsted sites decrease, which is consistent with the NH3-TPD results."
[9] "When the Si/Al ratio reaches 201 and above, Brnsted acidity is undetectable."
[10] "The initial activity of HZSM-5 supported zinc oxide catalysts decreases with increasing the Si/Al ratio, while the stability and the propene selectivity improve."
[11] "The enhancement of the catalyst stability with increasing the Si/Al ratio of the HZSM-5 support originates from the decrease in acidity of the catalysts, as revealed by the results of NH3-TPD and FT-IR spectra of pyridine adsorption, which leads to the suppression of the side reactions, such as cracking, oligomerization and aromatization."

1.Zeolites, especially HZSM-5 with high Si/Al ratios, are promising support materials for CO2-ODHP catalysts due to their unique properties. They have a complex reaction mechanism involving dehydrogenation, oligomerization, and ring closure steps. Zinc cations play a key role in the dehydrogenation of light paraffins, similar to gallium species in Ga-promoted HZSM-5 catalysts. Dealumination and weakening methods, such as increasing the Si/Al ratio, can decrease the acidity of the HZSM-5 support, which is beneficial for the dehydrogenation of propane to propene in the presence of CO2. These modifications contribute to optimizing catalytic performance by suppressing side reactions like cracking, oligomerization, and aromatization. The key considerations in selecting and implementing these strategies for different types of zeolites used as supports include the balance between activity and stability, the type and strength of acid sites, and the compatibility with the active species.

1.沸石，特别是高硅铝比的HZSM-5，是CO2-ODHP催化剂有前途的支撑材料，因为它们具有独特的性质。它们具有涉及脱氢、寡聚化和环闭合步骤的复杂反应机制。锌阳离子在轻质石蜡的脱氢中起着关键作用，类似于Ga-促进的HZSM-5催化剂中的镓物种。脱铝和削弱方法，如提高Si/Al比，可以降低HZSM-5支撑的酸性，这对在CO2存在下丙烷脱氢为丙烯是有利的。这些修改通过抑制裂解、寡聚化和芳构化等副反应，有助于优化催化性能。在为不同类型的用作支撑的沸石选择和实施这些策略时，关键考虑因素包括活性和稳定性的平衡、酸位的类型和强度以及与活性物种的兼容性。
