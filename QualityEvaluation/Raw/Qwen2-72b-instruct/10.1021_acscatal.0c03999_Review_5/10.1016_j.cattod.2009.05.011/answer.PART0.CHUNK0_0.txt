[1] "Zinc modified HZSM-5 materials with lower Si/Al ratios (generally below 35) are known to be another kind of effective catalysts for the production of aromatics from light alkanes [15,16]."
[2] "The reaction mechanism is thought to consist of a complex scheme involving dehydrogenation, oligomerization and ring- closure steps."
[3] "The modifying zinc cations play a key role in the dehydrogenation of light paraffins, which is quite similar to that of gallium species in Ga-promoted HZSM-5 catalysts [1727]."
[4] "This suggests that ZnO/HZSM-5 could be also a promising catalyst for the dehydrogenation of propane to propene in the presence of CO2 if the acidity of the HZSM-5 support is decreased."
[5] "However, there is little report focused on this so far."
[6] "The acidity of HZSM-5 supported zinc oxide catalysts was investigated by the NH3-TPD method, and the results are summarized in Table 2."
[7] "There is a broad asymmetric NH3 desorption peak on the TPD profiles of all the supported zinc oxide catalysts (not shown here)."
[8] "NH3 molecules desorbing between 120 and 350 8C correspond to acidity with weak acid strength,and those desorbing between 350 and 600 8C correspond to acidity with strong acid strength."
[9] "The number of weak and strong acid sites decreases quickly with increasing the Si/Al ratio of the support from 60 to 201, and diminishes a bit with further increase of the Si/Al ratio from 201 to 242."
[10] "The nature of the acid sites on HZSM-5 supported ZnO catalysts was measured in situ by FT-IR spectra of adsorbed pyridine on the catalysts."
[11] "As the Si/Al ratio of the HZSM-5 support increases, the amounts of both Lewis and Brnsted sites decrease, which is consistent with the NH3-TPD results."
[12] "When the Si/Al ratio reaches 201 and above, Brnsted acidity is undetectable."
[13] "The initial activity of HZSM-5 supported zinc oxide catalysts decreases with increasing the Si/Al ratio, while the stability and the propene selectivity improve."
[14] "The ZnO/HZSM-5(160) catalyst exhibits the best perfor- mance, with a propane conversion of 41.5% and propene yield of 25.8% at steady state."
[15] "The enhancement of the catalyst stability with increasing the Si/Al ratio of the HZSM-5 support originates from the decrease in acidity of the catalysts, as revealed by the results of NH3-TPD and FT-IR spectra of pyridine adsorption, which leads to the suppression of the side reactions, such as cracking,oligomerization and aromatization."

1.Zeolites, such as HZSM-5, are promising support materials for CO2-ODHP catalysts due to their high surface area, micropore volume, and tunable acidity. Dealumination and weakening methods can modify the acidity of zeolites, which is crucial for optimizing catalytic performance. Dealumination reduces the number of acid sites, which can suppress side reactions and improve selectivity. Weakening methods, such as increasing the Si/Al ratio, decrease the strength of acid sites, which can enhance stability and selectivity. The key considerations in selecting and implementing these strategies include the type of zeolite, the desired reaction, and the balance between activity, selectivity, and stability. For instance, ZnO/HZSM-5 catalysts with high Si/Al ratios show improved stability and propene selectivity for propane dehydrogenation in the presence of CO2, while the initial activity decreases. The optimal Si/Al ratio for a specific reaction should be determined experimentally to achieve the best catalytic performance.

1.沸石，如HZSM-5，是CO2-ODHP催化剂有前途的支撑材料，因为它们具有高表面积、微孔体积和可调酸性。脱铝和弱化方法可以改变沸石的酸性，这对优化催化性能至关重要。脱铝减少了酸性位点的数量，可以抑制副反应，提高选择性。弱化方法，如提高Si/Al比，降低了酸性位点的强度，可以增强稳定性和选择性。在选择和实施这些策略时，关键考虑因素包括沸石的类型、所需的反应以及活性、选择性和稳定性之间的平衡。例如，高Si/Al比的ZnO/HZSM-5催化剂在CO2存在下进行丙烷脱氢时，显示出改善的稳定性和丙烯选择性，而初始活性降低。对于特定反应的最佳Si/Al比应通过实验确定，以实现最佳的催化性能。
