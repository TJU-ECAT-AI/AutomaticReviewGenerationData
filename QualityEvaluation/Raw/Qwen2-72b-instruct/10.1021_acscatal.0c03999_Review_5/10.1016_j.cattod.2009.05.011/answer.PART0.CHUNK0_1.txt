[1] "Zinc modified HZSM-5 materials with lower Si/Al ratios (generally below 35) are known to be another kind of effective catalysts for the production of aromatics from light alkanes [15,16]."
[2] "The acidity of HZSM-5 supported zinc oxide catalysts was investigated by the NH3-TPD method, and the results are summarized in Table 2. There is a broad asymmetric NH3 desorption peak on the TPD profiles of all the supported zinc oxide catalysts (not shown here). NH3 molecules desorbing between 120 and 350 8C correspond to acidity with weak acid strength,and those desorbing between 350 and 600 8C correspond to acidity with strong acid strength. The number of weak and strong acid sites decreases quickly with increasing the Si/Al ratio of the support from 60 to 201, and diminishes a bit with further increase of the Si/Al ratio from 201 to 242."
[3] "The nature of the acid sites on HZSM-5 supported ZnO catalysts was measured in situ by FT-IR spectra of adsorbed pyridine on the catalysts. As shown in Fig. 3, the band detected at 1544 cm1 is ascribed to pyridine adsorbed on Brnsted acid sites, whereas the bands assigned to pyridine adsorbed on Lewis acid sites were recorded at 1451 and 1610 cm1. The band at 1490 cm1 is attributed to pyridine adsorbed on both Brnsted and Lewis acid sites. Brnsted and Lewis acidity are quantified into the integrated areas of the absorbance peaks at 1544 and at 1451 cm1, respectively, after calibrating the molar extinction coefficients of Brnsted and Lewis acid sites (the ratio of former to latter = 1:1.5 [29])."
[4] "The initial propane conversion decreases as the Si/Al ratio increases, suggesting that the acidities of the supported zinc oxide catalysts have a great effect on their dehydrogenation activity. ZnO/HZSM-5(60), which is the most acidic one according to the results of NH3-TPD and FT-IR spectra of adsorbed pyridine, has the highest initial activity."
[5] "The decreasing rate of the catalytic activity becomes lower for those catalysts with Si/Al ratio higher than 160,indicating that the catalyst stability improves as the catalyst acidity decreases."
[6] "Thus, appropriate amount of acid sites is critical for gaining an optimal result, and this goal is achieved in the case of ZnO/HZSM-5(160) in our present study."

1.Zeolites, such as HZSM-5, are promising support materials for CO2-ODHP catalysts due to their high surface area, micropore volume, and tunable acidity. Dealumination and weakening methods can modify the acidity of zeolites, which is crucial for optimizing catalytic performance. Dealumination, which increases the Si/Al ratio, decreases the number of acid sites, leading to a reduction in side reactions and an improvement in catalyst stability. Weakening methods, such as the introduction of zinc oxide, can also decrease the number of acid sites, which is beneficial for suppressing side reactions and enhancing propene selectivity. The key considerations in selecting and implementing these strategies include the balance between activity and stability, the type of zeolite used, and the specific reaction conditions. For instance, ZnO/HZSM-5(160) exhibits the best performance in the dehydrogenation of propane to propene in the presence of CO2, with a propane conversion of 41.5% and a propene yield of 25.8% at steady state, due to the appropriate amount of acid sites that result from the high Si/Al ratio of the HZSM-5 support.

1.沸石，如HZSM-5，是CO2-ODHP催化剂有希望的支撑材料，因为它们具有高表面积、微孔体积和可调酸性。脱铝和弱化方法可以修改沸石的酸性，这对优化催化性能至关重要。脱铝，即增加Si/Al比，减少了酸性位点的数量，导致副反应减少，催化剂稳定性提高。弱化方法，如引入氧化锌，也可以减少酸性位点的数量，这对抑制副反应和提高丙烯选择性有益。在选择和实施这些策略时，关键考虑因素包括活性和稳定性之间的平衡、所用沸石的类型以及特定的反应条件。例如，ZnO/HZSM-5(160)在丙烷存在CO2的情况下脱氢制丙烯的反应中表现出最佳性能，丙烷转化率为41.5%，丙烯产率为25.8%，这是由于HZSM-5支撑的高Si/Al比导致的适当数量的酸性位点。
