Dealumination, a method of removing aluminum from the zeolite structure, can significantly modify the acidity of the zeolite. This process, when applied to TEABeta zeolite, results in an aluminium-free SiBeta support with a high Si/Al ratio, which is beneficial for the dispersion of chromium species. The acidity of the zeolite support plays a crucial role in the catalytic performance. Low acidity, as seen in SiBeta, is advantageous for achieving high selectivity to propene, while high acidity, as in AlBeta, promotes the cracking of propane to lighter hydrocarbons, which is less desirable. The choice and implementation of acidity modification strategies, such as dealumination, should be carefully considered based on the specific type of zeolite used as a support and the desired catalytic outcome.", "Doi": "10.1016/j.jcou.2019.09.018"},
