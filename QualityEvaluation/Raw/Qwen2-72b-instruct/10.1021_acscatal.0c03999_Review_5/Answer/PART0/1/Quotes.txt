          [2] "The reaction mechanism on the titled catalyst was discussed."
          [3] "The main problem of the current industrial process is that most catalysts, such as Cr2O3/Al2O3 [1] and Pt-Sn/Al2O3 [2], quickly deactivate during reaction, which is caused by the side reactions like oligomerization and cracking."
          [4] "The oxidative dehydrogenation of propane by oxygen has been proposed as an alternative, since coke can be consumed timely by oxygen during the reaction."
          [5] "However, the propene selectivity becomes a prominent problem because of the over-oxidation of propane to carbon dioxide."
          [6] "Recently, oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes by carbon dioxide instead of oxygen has been reported to give rather high selectivity towards their corresponding alkenes over some catalysts, such as rare earth vanadates [3], supported Cr2O3 [4], and Ga2O3 [5,6]."
          [7] "Unfortunately, the stability of these catalysts is still rather poor and the activity declines dramatically with reaction time, which is fatal for industrial application [3-6]."
          [8] "Aromatization of light paraffins over Ga-promoted HZSM-5 catalysts has been studied intensely in the previous decades."
          [9] "The aromatization reaction is thought to proceed via a bifunctional mechanism. Gallium oxide is responsible for catalyzing the dehydrogenation of propane while Bronsted acid sites account for catalyzing the oligomerization of light alkenes and the cyclization of C6  C9 alkenes [7-10]."
          [10] "More recently, it has been discovered that carbon dioxide could markedly promote the dehydrogenation of ethane and propane over supported gallium oxide catalysts [11]."
          [11] "Furthermore, distinct behavior is observed over different supported gallium oxide catalysts, such as Ga2O3/TiO2, Ga2O3/Al2O3, Ga2O3/ZrO2, Ga2O3/SiO2 and Ga2O3/MgO."
          [12] "The support effect comes from their different H2 adsorption capacities and acid-base properties, caused by the intrinsic properties of the supports and their interactions with gallium oxide [12]."
          [13] "The possible reasons for the superior catalytic behavior were discussed."
          [14] "The initial propane conversion decreases as the steaming temperature rises, indicating that the dealumination of the HZSM-5 support has a significant effect on the dehydrogenation activity of the supported gallium oxide catalysts."
          [15] "Ga2O3/silicalite, which has no aluminium in the framework of the support, has the lowest initial activity."
          [16] "The decreasing rate of the catalytic activity is much slower for those catalysts with the steaming temperature of the support higher than 650 oC, suggesting that the HZSM-5 supported gallium oxide catalysts are more resistant to deactivation after the dealumination of the support."
          [17] "The improvement of the catalyst stability with increasing Si/Al ratio can also be verified by measuring the coke deposited on the catalysts after on stream for 24 h."

          [19] "The acidity of the supported gallium oxide catalysts was measured by NH3-TPD method and the results are summarized in Table 2."
          [20] "There is only one identifiable desorption peak at 264 oC in the NH3-TPD profile of HZSM-5, and the amount of desorbed NH3 is small."
          [21] "This can be attributed to the few framework Al existing in HZSM-5 zeolite because of the high Si/Al ratio."
          [22] "When gallium oxide is supported on HZSM-5, a second peak at 465 oC emerges in its NH3-TPD profile, indicating that some strong acid sites emerge on the catalyst."
          [23] "The acid amount of Ga2O3/HZSM-5 is more than triple of that of HZSM-5, suggesting that Ga2O3 on the support may be the cause for the strong acidity of the catalyst."
          [24] "Meanwhile, dealumination of HZSM-5 would weaken the acidity of the supported gallium oxide catalysts."
          [25] "As the steaming temperature rises, the acid strength and acid amount of the catalysts decrease markedly."
          [26] "Obviously, the decrease in acid amount does not result only from the loss of acid sites present on HZSM-5, since the amount of acid sites reduced is greater than that of total acid sites the HZSM-5 originally possesses."
          [27] "The previous studies show that strong interactions between Ga2O3 species and the support enhance the acidity of the supported gallium oxide catalysts [12, 15], so the extra decrease in acid amount may be connected with the weakening of the interaction between Ga2O3 species and the HZSM-5 support due to the dealumination of the zeolite."
          [28] "Catalyst deactivation in dehydrogenation reactions is mainly attributed to the coke deposition on the catalyst surface."
          [29] "Thus, inhibiting these side reactions through removing the excess acid sites present on the catalysts would improve the stability of the catalysts for propane dehydrogenation."
          [30] "This is probably the reason why the stability of supported Ga2O3 catalysts is significantly enhanced by reducing the amount of strong acid sites appropriately through steaming treatment of the HZSM-5 support."
          [31] "It could be concluded that the strong acid sites on supported gallium oxide catalysts play two opposite roles in propane dehydrogenation reaction."
          [32] "The positive role is to enhance the catalyst activity by providing alternative reaction path to the slow step, and the negative role is to accelerate the catalyst deactivation by catalyzing a series of side reactions."
          [33] "Therefore, the amount of strong acid sites present on the catalysts is critical for gaining an optimal result, and this goal is achieved in the case of Ga2O3/HZSM-5(700)."

As described in Table 2,the total amount of acid sites on Ga2O3/HZSM-48 catalyst is quite similar to that on Ga2O3/HZSM-5 with similar Si/Al ratio, while the amount of medium to strong acid sites is much lower, indicating that the acid strength of Ga2O3/HZSM-48 is much weaker in comparison with that of Ga2O3/HZSM-5."

          [15] "The enhancement of the catalyst stability with increasing the Si/Al ratio of the HZSM-5 support originates from the decrease in acidity of the catalysts, as revealed by the results of NH3-TPD and FT-IR spectra of pyridine adsorption, which leads to the suppression of the side reactions, such as cracking,oligomerization and aromatization."
          [16] "The initial propane conversion decreases as the Si/Al ratio increases, suggesting that the acidities of the supported zinc oxide catalysts have a great effect on their dehydrogenation activity."
          [17] "The decreasing rate of the catalytic activity becomes lower for those catalysts with Si/Al ratio higher than 160,indicating that the catalyst stability improves as the catalyst acidity decreases."

          [2] "The reaction mechanism on the titled catalyst was discussed."
          [3] "The main problem of the current industrial process is that most catalysts, such as Cr2O3/Al2O3 [1] and Pt-Sn/Al2O3 [2], quickly deactivate during reaction, which is caused by the side reactions like oligomerization and cracking."
          [4] "The oxidative dehydrogenation of propane by oxygen has been proposed as an alternative, since coke can be consumed timely by oxygen during the reaction."
          [5] "However, the propene selectivity becomes a prominent problem because of the over-oxidation of propane to carbon dioxide."
          [6] "Recently, oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes by carbon dioxide instead of oxygen has been reported to give rather high selectivity towards their corresponding alkenes over some catalysts, such as rare earth vanadates [3], supported Cr2O3 [4], and Ga2O3 [5,6]."
          [7] "Unfortunately, the stability of these catalysts is still rather poor and the activity declines dramatically with reaction time, which is fatal for industrial application [3-6]."
          [8] "Aromatization of light paraffins over Ga-promoted HZSM-5 catalysts has been studied intensely in the previous decades."
          [9] "The aromatization reaction is thought to proceed via a bifunctional mechanism. Gallium oxide is responsible for catalyzing the dehydrogenation of propane while Bronsted acid sites account for catalyzing the oligomerization of light alkenes and the cyclization of C6  C9 alkenes [7-10]."
          [10] "More recently, it has been discovered that carbon dioxide could markedly promote the dehydrogenation of ethane and propane over supported gallium oxide catalysts [11]."
          [11] "Furthermore, distinct behavior is observed over different supported gallium oxide catalysts, such as Ga2O3/TiO2, Ga2O3/Al2O3, Ga2O3/ZrO2, Ga2O3/SiO2 and Ga2O3/MgO."

          [13] "The possible reasons for the superior catalytic behavior were discussed."
          [14] "The initial propane conversion decreases as the steaming temperature rises, indicating that the dealumination of the HZSM-5 support has a significant effect on the dehydrogenation activity of the supported gallium oxide catalysts."
          [15] "Ga2O3/silicalite, which has no aluminium in the framework of the support, has the lowest initial activity."
          [16] "The decreasing rate of the catalytic activity is much slower for those catalysts with the steaming temperature of the support higher than 650 oC, suggesting that the HZSM-5 supported gallium oxide catalysts are more resistant to deactivation after the dealumination of the support."
          [17] "The improvement of the catalyst stability with increasing Si/Al ratio can also be verified by measuring the coke deposited on the catalysts after on stream for 24 h."

          [20] "There is only one identifiable desorption peak at 264 oC in the NH3-TPD profile of HZSM-5, and the amount of desorbed NH3 is small."
          [21] "This can be attributed to the few framework Al existing in HZSM-5 zeolite because of the high Si/Al ratio."
          [22] "When gallium oxide is supported on HZSM-5, a second peak at 465 oC emerges in its NH3-TPD profile, indicating that some strong acid sites emerge on the catalyst."
          [23] "The acid amount of Ga2O3/HZSM-5 is more than triple of that of HZSM-5, suggesting that Ga2O3 on the support may be the cause for the strong acidity of the catalyst."
          [24] "Meanwhile, dealumination of HZSM-5 would weaken the acidity of the supported gallium oxide catalysts."
          [25] "As the steaming temperature rises, the acid strength and acid amount of the catalysts decrease markedly."
          [26] "Obviously, the decrease in acid amount does not result only from the loss of acid sites present on HZSM-5, since the amount of acid sites reduced is greater than that of total acid sites the HZSM-5 originally possesses."
          [27] "The previous studies show that strong interactions between Ga2O3 species and the support enhance the acidity of the supported gallium oxide catalysts [12, 15], so the extra decrease in acid amount may be connected with the weakening of the interaction between Ga2O3 species and the HZSM-5 support due to the dealumination of the zeolite."
          [28] "Catalyst deactivation in dehydrogenation reactions is mainly attributed to the coke deposition on the catalyst surface."
          [29] "Thus, inhibiting these side reactions through removing the excess acid sites present on the catalysts would improve the stability of the catalysts for propane dehydrogenation."
          [30] "This is probably the reason why the stability of supported Ga2O3 catalysts is significantly enhanced by reducing the amount of strong acid sites appropriately through steaming treatment of the HZSM-5 support."
          [31] "It could be concluded that the strong acid sites on supported gallium oxide catalysts play two opposite roles in propane dehydrogenation reaction."
          [32] "The positive role is to enhance the catalyst activity by providing alternative reaction path to the slow step, and the negative role is to accelerate the catalyst deactivation by catalyzing a series of side reactions."

          [9] "The number of weak and strong acid sites decreases quickly with increasing the Si/Al ratio of the support from 60 to 201, and diminishes a bit with further increase of the Si/Al ratio from 201 to 242."
          [10] "The nature of the acid sites on HZSM-5 supported ZnO catalysts was measured in situ by FT-IR spectra of adsorbed pyridine on the catalysts."
          [11] "As the Si/Al ratio of the HZSM-5 support increases, the amounts of both Lewis and Brnsted sites decrease, which is consistent with the NH3-TPD results."
          [12] "When the Si/Al ratio reaches 201 and above, Brnsted acidity is undetectable."
          [13] "The initial activity of HZSM-5 supported zinc oxide catalysts decreases with increasing the Si/Al ratio, while the stability and the propene selectivity improve."
          [14] "The ZnO/HZSM-5(160) catalyst exhibits the best perfor- mance, with a propane conversion of 41.5% and propene yield of 25.8% at steady state."
          [15] "The enhancement of the catalyst stability with increasing the Si/Al ratio of the HZSM-5 support originates from the decrease in acidity of the catalysts, as revealed by the results of NH3-TPD and FT-IR spectra of pyridine adsorption, which leads to the suppression of the side reactions, such as cracking,oligomerization and aromatization."
          [16] "The initial propane conversion decreases as the Si/Al ratio increases, suggesting that the acidities of the supported zinc oxide catalysts have a great effect on their dehydrogenation activity."
          [17] "The decreasing rate of the catalytic activity becomes lower for those catalysts with Si/Al ratio higher than 160,indicating that the catalyst stability improves as the catalyst acidity decreases."

[1] "High catalytic activity and stability of dehydrogenation of propane to propene in the presence of CO2 were achieved over Ga2O3 catalyst supported on HZSM-5 with high Si/Al ratio."
          [2] "The reaction mechanism on the titled catalyst was discussed."
          [3] "The main problem of the current industrial process is that most catalysts, such as Cr2O3/Al2O3 [1] and Pt-Sn/Al2O3 [2], quickly deactivate during reaction, which is caused by the side reactions like oligomerization and cracking."
          [4] "The oxidative dehydrogenation of propane by oxygen has been proposed as an alternative, since coke can be consumed timely by oxygen during the reaction."
          [5] "However, the propene selectivity becomes a prominent problem because of the over-oxidation of propane to carbon dioxide."
          [6] "Recently, oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes by carbon dioxide instead of oxygen has been reported to give rather high selectivity towards their corresponding alkenes over some catalysts, such as rare earth vanadates [3], supported Cr2O3 [4], and Ga2O3 [5,6]."
          [7] "Unfortunately, the stability of these catalysts is still rather poor and the activity declines dramatically with reaction time, which is fatal for industrial application [3-6]."
          [8] "Aromatization of light paraffins over Ga-promoted HZSM-5 catalysts has been studied intensely in the previous decades."
          [9] "The aromatization reaction is thought to proceed via a bifunctional mechanism. Gallium oxide is responsible for catalyzing the dehydrogenation of propane while Bronsted acid sites account for catalyzing the oligomerization of light alkenes and the cyclization of C6  C9 alkenes [7-10]."
          [10] "More recently, it has been discovered that carbon dioxide could markedly promote the dehydrogenation of ethane and propane over supported gallium oxide catalysts [11]."
          [11] "Furthermore, distinct behavior is observed over different supported gallium oxide catalysts, such as Ga2O3/TiO2, Ga2O3/Al2O3, Ga2O3/ZrO2, Ga2O3/SiO2 and Ga2O3/MgO."
          [12] "The support effect comes from their different H2 adsorption capacities and acid-base properties, caused by the intrinsic properties of the supports and their interactions with gallium oxide [12]."
          [13] "The possible reasons for the superior catalytic behavior were discussed."
          [14] "The initial propane conversion decreases as the steaming temperature rises, indicating that the dealumination of the HZSM-5 support has a significant effect on the dehydrogenation activity of the supported gallium oxide catalysts."
          [15] "Ga2O3/silicalite, which has no aluminium in the framework of the support, has the lowest initial activity."
          [16] "The decreasing rate of the catalytic activity is much slower for those catalysts with the steaming temperature of the support higher than 650 oC, suggesting that the HZSM-5 supported gallium oxide catalysts are more resistant to deactivation after the dealumination of the support."
          [17] "The improvement of the catalyst stability with increasing Si/Al ratio can also be verified by measuring the coke deposited on the catalysts after on stream for 24 h."

          [20] "There is only one identifiable desorption peak at 264 oC in the NH3-TPD profile of HZSM-5, and the amount of desorbed NH3 is small."
          [21] "This can be attributed to the few framework Al existing in HZSM-5 zeolite because of the high Si/Al ratio."
          [22] "When gallium oxide is supported on HZSM-5, a second peak at 465 oC emerges in its NH3-TPD profile, indicating that some strong acid sites emerge on the catalyst."
          [23] "The acid amount of Ga2O3/HZSM-5 is more than triple of that of HZSM-5, suggesting that Ga2O3 on the support may be the cause for the strong acidity of the catalyst."
          [24] "Meanwhile, dealumination of HZSM-5 would weaken the acidity of the supported gallium oxide catalysts."
          [25] "As the steaming temperature rises, the acid strength and acid amount of the catalysts decrease markedly."
          [26] "Obviously, the decrease in acid amount does not result only from the loss of acid sites present on HZSM-5, since the amount of acid sites reduced is greater than that of total acid sites the HZSM-5 originally possesses."
          [27] "The previous studies show that strong interactions between Ga2O3 species and the support enhance the acidity of the supported gallium oxide catalysts [12, 15], so the extra decrease in acid amount may be connected with the weakening of the interaction between Ga2O3 species and the HZSM-5 support due to the dealumination of the zeolite."
          [28] "Catalyst deactivation in dehydrogenation reactions is mainly attributed to the coke deposition on the catalyst surface."
          [29] "Thus, inhibiting these side reactions through removing the excess acid sites present on the catalysts would improve the stability of the catalysts for propane dehydrogenation."
          [30] "This is probably the reason why the stability of supported Ga2O3 catalysts is significantly enhanced by reducing the amount of strong acid sites appropriately through steaming treatment of the HZSM-5 support."
          [31] "It could be concluded that the strong acid sites on supported gallium oxide catalysts play two opposite roles in propane dehydrogenation reaction."
          [32] "The positive role is to enhance the catalyst activity by providing alternative reaction path to the slow step, and the negative role is to accelerate the catalyst deactivation by catalyzing a series of side reactions."

[1] "Beta zeolite was applied due to a three-dimensional structure,the pores larger than those of ZSM-5 with 12-membered ring openings (0.75 by 0.57 nm for linear and 0.65 by 0.56 nm for tortuous channels),a high thermal and acid stability and a large specific surface area needed for high chromium species dispersion [3335]."
          [2] "The Cr-containing SiBeta zeolite catalysts were ob- tained by two-step postsynthesis preparation procedure which consist, in the first step, removal of aluminum from TEABeta zeolite with Si/Al of 17 by treatment with nitric acid solution to obtain an aluminium-free SiBeta support with Si/Al ratio of 1000 and, in the second step, various amounts of Cr were introduced into the siliceous SiBeta zeolite structure by wet impregnation."
          [3] "Low acidity of SiBeta is suitable for achieving high selectivity to propene (above 80 %) while high acidity of starting AlBeta promotes propane cracking to lighter hydrocarbons."

[1] "Zinc modified HZSM-5 materials with lower Si/Al ratios (generally below 35) are known to be another kind of effective catalysts for the production of aromatics from light alkanes [15,16]."

          [3] "The modifying zinc cations play a key role in the dehydrogenation of light paraffins, which is quite similar to that of gallium species in Ga-promoted HZSM-5 catalysts [1727]."
          [4] "This suggests that ZnO/HZSM-5 could be also a promising catalyst for the dehydrogenation of propane to propene in the presence of CO2 if the acidity of the HZSM-5 support is decreased."
          [5] "However, there is little report focused on this so far."
          [6] "The acidity of HZSM-5 supported zinc oxide catalysts was investigated by the NH3-TPD method, and the results are summarized in Table 2."
          [7] "There is a broad asymmetric NH3 desorption peak on the TPD profiles of all the supported zinc oxide catalysts (not shown here)."
          [8] "NH3 molecules desorbing between 120 and 350 8C correspond to acidity with weak acid strength,and those desorbing between 350 and 600 8C correspond to acidity with strong acid strength."
          [9] "The number of weak and strong acid sites decreases quickly with increasing the Si/Al ratio of the support from 60 to 201, and diminishes a bit with further increase of the Si/Al ratio from 201 to 242."
          [10] "The nature of the acid sites on HZSM-5 supported ZnO catalysts was measured in situ by FT-IR spectra of adsorbed pyridine on the catalysts."
          [11] "As the Si/Al ratio of the HZSM-5 support increases, the amounts of both Lewis and Brnsted sites decrease, which is consistent with the NH3-TPD results."
          [12] "When the Si/Al ratio reaches 201 and above, Brnsted acidity is undetectable."
          [13] "The initial activity of HZSM-5 supported zinc oxide catalysts decreases with increasing the Si/Al ratio, while the stability and the propene selectivity improve."
          [14] "The ZnO/HZSM-5(160) catalyst exhibits the best perfor- mance, with a propane conversion of 41.5% and propene yield of 25.8% at steady state."
          [15] "The enhancement of the catalyst stability with increasing the Si/Al ratio of the HZSM-5 support originates from the decrease in acidity of the catalysts, as revealed by the results of NH3-TPD and FT-IR spectra of pyridine adsorption, which leads to the suppression of the side reactions, such as cracking,oligomerization and aromatization."
          [16] "The initial propane conversion decreases as the Si/Al ratio increases, suggesting that the acidities of the supported zinc oxide catalysts have a great effect on their dehydrogenation activity."
          [17] "The decreasing rate of the catalytic activity becomes lower for those catalysts with Si/Al ratio higher than 160,indicating that the catalyst stability improves as the catalyst acidity decreases."

          [2] "The reaction mechanism on the titled catalyst was discussed."
          [3] "The main problem of the current industrial process is that most catalysts, such as Cr2O3/Al2O3 [1] and Pt-Sn/Al2O3 [2], quickly deactivate during reaction, which is caused by the side reactions like oligomerization and cracking."
          [4] "The oxidative dehydrogenation of propane by oxygen has been proposed as an alternative, since coke can be consumed timely by oxygen during the reaction."

          [6] "Recently, oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes by carbon dioxide instead of oxygen has been reported to give rather high selectivity towards their corresponding alkenes over some catalysts, such as rare earth vanadates [3], supported Cr2O3 [4], and Ga2O3 [5,6]."

          [8] "Aromatization of light paraffins over Ga-promoted HZSM-5 catalysts has been studied intensely in the previous decades."
          [9] "The aromatization reaction is thought to proceed via a bifunctional mechanism. Gallium oxide is responsible for catalyzing the dehydrogenation of propane while Bronsted acid sites account for catalyzing the oligomerization of light alkenes and the cyclization of C6  C9 alkenes [7-10]."
          [10] "More recently, it has been discovered that carbon dioxide could markedly promote the dehydrogenation of ethane and propane over supported gallium oxide catalysts [11]."

          [14] "The initial propane conversion decreases as the steaming temperature rises, indicating that the dealumination of the HZSM-5 support has a significant effect on the dehydrogenation activity of the supported gallium oxide catalysts."
          [15] "Ga2O3/silicalite, which has no aluminium in the framework of the support, has the lowest initial activity."
          [16] "The decreasing rate of the catalytic activity is much slower for those catalysts with the steaming temperature of the support higher than 650 oC, suggesting that the HZSM-5 supported gallium oxide catalysts are more resistant to deactivation after the dealumination of the support."
          [17] "The improvement of the catalyst stability with increasing Si/Al ratio can also be verified by measuring the coke deposited on the catalysts after on stream for 24 h."

          [22] "When gallium oxide is supported on HZSM-5, a second peak at 465 oC emerges in its NH3-TPD profile, indicating that some strong acid sites emerge on the catalyst."
          [23] "The acid amount of Ga2O3/HZSM-5 is more than triple of that of HZSM-5, suggesting that Ga2O3 on the support may be the cause for the strong acidity of the catalyst."
          [24] "Meanwhile, dealumination of HZSM-5 would weaken the acidity of the supported gallium oxide catalysts."
          [25] "As the steaming temperature rises, the acid strength and acid amount of the catalysts decrease markedly."
          [26] "Obviously, the decrease in acid amount does not result only from the loss of acid sites present on HZSM-5, since the amount of acid sites reduced is greater than that of total acid sites the HZSM-5 originally possesses."
          [27] "The previous studies show that strong interactions between Ga2O3 species and the support enhance the acidity of the supported gallium oxide catalysts [12, 15], so the extra decrease in acid amount may be connected with the weakening of the interaction between Ga2O3 species and the HZSM-5 support due to the dealumination of the zeolite."
          [28] "Catalyst deactivation in dehydrogenation reactions is mainly attributed to the coke deposition on the catalyst surface."
          [29] "Thus, inhibiting these side reactions through removing the excess acid sites present on the catalysts would improve the stability of the catalysts for propane dehydrogenation."
          [30] "This is probably the reason why the stability of supported Ga2O3 catalysts is significantly enhanced by reducing the amount of strong acid sites appropriately through steaming treatment of the HZSM-5 support."
          [31] "It could be concluded that the strong acid sites on supported gallium oxide catalysts play two opposite roles in propane dehydrogenation reaction."

          [2] "The acidity of HZSM-48 supported Ga2O3 catalyst was also compared with that of supported HZSM-5. As described in Table 2,the total amount of acid sites on Ga2O3/HZSM-48 catalyst is quite similar to that on Ga2O3/HZSM-5 with similar Si/Al ratio, while the amount of medium to strong acid sites is much lower, indicating that the acid strength of Ga2O3/HZSM-48 is much weaker in comparison with that of Ga2O3/HZSM-5."

          [2] "The acidity of various HZSM-5 supports was measured using cumene cracking as a model reaction, and the results are listed in Table 2. It can be seen that the activ- ity decreases markedly after steaming treatment. This is indicative of the removal of some framework Al atoms in the HZSM-5 zeolite upon steaming treatment, since cumene cracking is catalyzed only by the Brnsted acid sites."

          [2] "The acidity of various HZSM-5 supports was measured using cumene cracking as a model reaction, and the results are listed in Table 2. It can be seen that the activ- ity decreases markedly after steaming treatment. This is indicative of the removal of some framework Al atoms in the HZSM-5 zeolite upon steaming treatment, since cumene cracking is catalyzed only by the Brnsted acid sites."
          [3] "The acidity of various HZSM-5 supports was also measured by the NH3-TPD method, and the results are summarized in Table 2. As presented in Table 2, the number of weak acid sites (expressed as the amount of NH3 desorbed at 120350 ), strong acid sites (ex- pressed as the amount of NH3 desorbed at 350600 ) and total acid sites of the steaming-treated HZSM-5 are evidently lower than those of the parent HZSM-5. The severer the steaming condition, the lower the acidity."
          [4] "The above results suggest that too many and too few Brnsted acidic sites on HZSM-5 are both not favored to the dehydrogenation reaction, and appro- priate density of Brnsted acidic sites on HZSM-5 is crucial to the catalytic performance of ZnO/HZSM-5."

[1] "Beta zeolite was applied due to a three-dimensional structure,the pores larger than those of ZSM-5 with 12-membered ring openings (0.75 by 0.57 nm for linear and 0.65 by 0.56 nm for tortuous channels),a high thermal and acid stability and a large specific surface area needed for high chromium species dispersion [3335]."
          [2] "The Cr-containing SiBeta zeolite catalysts were ob- tained by two-step postsynthesis preparation procedure which consist, in the first step, removal of aluminum from TEABeta zeolite with Si/Al of 17 by treatment with nitric acid solution to obtain an aluminium-free SiBeta support with Si/Al ratio of 1000 and, in the second step, various amounts of Cr were introduced into the siliceous SiBeta zeolite structure by wet impregnation."
          [3] "Low acidity of SiBeta is suitable for achieving high selectivity to propene (above 80 %) while high acidity of starting AlBeta promotes propane cracking to lighter hydrocarbons."

[1] "Zinc modified HZSM-5 materials with lower Si/Al ratios (generally below 35) are known to be another kind of effective catalysts for the production of aromatics from light alkanes [15,16]."
          [2] "The reaction mechanism is thought to consist of a complex scheme involving dehydrogenation, oligomerization and ring- closure steps."
          [3] "The modifying zinc cations play a key role in the dehydrogenation of light paraffins, which is quite similar to that of gallium species in Ga-promoted HZSM-5 catalysts [1727]."
          [4] "This suggests that ZnO/HZSM-5 could be also a promising catalyst for the dehydrogenation of propane to propene in the presence of CO2 if the acidity of the HZSM-5 support is decreased."
          [5] "However, there is little report focused on this so far."
          [6] "The acidity of HZSM-5 supported zinc oxide catalysts was investigated by the NH3-TPD method, and the results are summarized in Table 2."
          [7] "There is a broad asymmetric NH3 desorption peak on the TPD profiles of all the supported zinc oxide catalysts (not shown here)."
          [8] "NH3 molecules desorbing between 120 and 350 8C correspond to acidity with weak acid strength,and those desorbing between 350 and 600 8C correspond to acidity with strong acid strength."
          [9] "The number of weak and strong acid sites decreases quickly with increasing the Si/Al ratio of the support from 60 to 201, and diminishes a bit with further increase of the Si/Al ratio from 201 to 242."
          [10] "The nature of the acid sites on HZSM-5 supported ZnO catalysts was measured in situ by FT-IR spectra of adsorbed pyridine on the catalysts."
          [11] "As the Si/Al ratio of the HZSM-5 support increases, the amounts of both Lewis and Brnsted sites decrease, which is consistent with the NH3-TPD results."
          [12] "When the Si/Al ratio reaches 201 and above, Brnsted acidity is undetectable."
          [13] "The initial activity of HZSM-5 supported zinc oxide catalysts decreases with increasing the Si/Al ratio, while the stability and the propene selectivity improve."
          [14] "The ZnO/HZSM-5(160) catalyst exhibits the best perfor- mance, with a propane conversion of 41.5% and propene yield of 25.8% at steady state."
          [15] "The enhancement of the catalyst stability with increasing the Si/Al ratio of the HZSM-5 support originates from the decrease in acidity of the catalysts, as revealed by the results of NH3-TPD and FT-IR spectra of pyridine adsorption, which leads to the suppression of the side reactions, such as cracking,oligomerization and aromatization."
          [16] "The initial propane conversion decreases as the Si/Al ratio increases, suggesting that the acidities of the supported zinc oxide catalysts have a great effect on their dehydrogenation activity."
          [17] "The decreasing rate of the catalytic activity becomes lower for those catalysts with Si/Al ratio higher than 160,indicating that the catalyst stability improves as the catalyst acidity decreases."
          [18] "Thus, appropriate amount of acid sites is critical for gaining an optimal result, and this goal is achieved in the case of ZnO/HZSM-5(160) in our present study."

[1] "High catalytic activity and stability of dehydrogenation of propane to propene in the presence of CO2 were achieved over Ga2O3 catalyst supported on HZSM-5 with high Si/Al ratio."
          [2] "The reaction mechanism on the titled catalyst was discussed."
          [3] "The main problem of the current industrial process is that most catalysts, such as Cr2O3/Al2O3 [1] and Pt-Sn/Al2O3 [2], quickly deactivate during reaction, which is caused by the side reactions like oligomerization and cracking."
          [4] "The oxidative dehydrogenation of propane by oxygen has been proposed as an alternative, since coke can be consumed timely by oxygen during the reaction."
          [5] "However, the propene selectivity becomes a prominent problem because of the over-oxidation of propane to carbon dioxide."
          [6] "Recently, oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes by carbon dioxide instead of oxygen has been reported to give rather high selectivity towards their corresponding alkenes over some catalysts, such as rare earth vanadates [3], supported Cr2O3 [4], and Ga2O3 [5,6]."
          [7] "Unfortunately, the stability of these catalysts is still rather poor and the activity declines dramatically with reaction time, which is fatal for industrial application [3-6]."
          [8] "Aromatization of light paraffins over Ga-promoted HZSM-5 catalysts has been studied intensely in the previous decades."
          [9] "The aromatization reaction is thought to proceed via a bifunctional mechanism. Gallium oxide is responsible for catalyzing the dehydrogenation of propane while Bronsted acid sites account for catalyzing the oligomerization of light alkenes and the cyclization of C6  C9 alkenes [7-10]."
          [10] "More recently, it has been discovered that carbon dioxide could markedly promote the dehydrogenation of ethane and propane over supported gallium oxide catalysts [11]."
          [11] "Furthermore, distinct behavior is observed over different supported gallium oxide catalysts, such as Ga2O3/TiO2, Ga2O3/Al2O3, Ga2O3/ZrO2, Ga2O3/SiO2 and Ga2O3/MgO."
          [12] "The support effect comes from their different H2 adsorption capacities and acid-base properties, caused by the intrinsic properties of the supports and their interactions with gallium oxide [12]."
          [13] "The possible reasons for the superior catalytic behavior were discussed."
          [14] "The initial propane conversion decreases as the steaming temperature rises, indicating that the dealumination of the HZSM-5 support has a significant effect on the dehydrogenation activity of the supported gallium oxide catalysts."
          [15] "Ga2O3/silicalite, which has no aluminium in the framework of the support, has the lowest initial activity."
          [16] "The decreasing rate of the catalytic activity is much slower for those catalysts with the steaming temperature of the support higher than 650 oC, suggesting that the HZSM-5 supported gallium oxide catalysts are more resistant to deactivation after the dealumination of the support."
          [17] "The improvement of the catalyst stability with increasing Si/Al ratio can also be verified by measuring the coke deposited on the catalysts after on stream for 24 h."
          [18] "The steady state conversion of propane for the catalysts is in the order of > Ga2O3/HZSM-5  Ga2O3/HZSM-5(800)  Ga2O3/silicalite."
          [19] "The acidity of the supported gallium oxide catalysts was measured by NH3-TPD method and the results are summarized in Table 2."
          [20] "There is only one identifiable desorption peak at 264 oC in the NH3-TPD profile of HZSM-5, and the amount of desorbed NH3 is small."
          [21] "This can be attributed to the few framework Al existing in HZSM-5 zeolite because of the high Si/Al ratio."
          [22] "When gallium oxide is supported on HZSM-5, a second peak at 465 oC emerges in its NH3-TPD profile, indicating that some strong acid sites emerge on the catalyst."
          [23] "The acid amount of Ga2O3/HZSM-5 is more than triple of that of HZSM-5, suggesting that Ga2O3 on the support may be the cause for the strong acidity of the catalyst."
          [24] "Meanwhile, dealumination of HZSM-5 would weaken the acidity of the supported gallium oxide catalysts."
          [25] "As the steaming temperature rises, the acid strength and acid amount of the catalysts decrease markedly."
          [26] "Obviously, the decrease in acid amount does not result only from the loss of acid sites present on HZSM-5, since the amount of acid sites reduced is greater than that of total acid sites the HZSM-5 originally possesses."
          [27] "The previous studies show that strong interactions between Ga2O3 species and the support enhance the acidity of the supported gallium oxide catalysts [12, 15], so the extra decrease in acid amount may be connected with the weakening of the interaction between Ga2O3 species and the HZSM-5 support due to the dealumination of the zeolite."
          [28] "Catalyst deactivation in dehydrogenation reactions is mainly attributed to the coke deposition on the catalyst surface."
          [29] "Thus, inhibiting these side reactions through removing the excess acid sites present on the catalysts would improve the stability of the catalysts for propane dehydrogenation."
          [30] "This is probably the reason why the stability of supported Ga2O3 catalysts is significantly enhanced by reducing the amount of strong acid sites appropriately through steaming treatment of the HZSM-5 support."
          [31] "It could be concluded that the strong acid sites on supported gallium oxide catalysts play two opposite roles in propane dehydrogenation reaction."
          [32] "The positive role is to enhance the catalyst activity by providing alternative reaction path to the slow step, and the negative role is to accelerate the catalyst deactivation by catalyzing a series of side reactions."
          [33] "Therefore, the amount of strong acid sites present on the catalysts is critical for gaining an optimal result, and this goal is achieved in the case of Ga2O3/HZSM-5(700)."

          [2] "In addition to the aforementioned mesoporous silica and various metal oxides, zeolites are also promising support materials because of their microporosity with large surface area, tunable acidity, and excellent thermostability."
          [3] "Dealumination is widely used to eliminate the surface acidity, and approaches include acid treatment (22) and steaming treatments at temperatures."
          [4] "Weakening acidity is an alternative to control the surface acidity and can be achieved by tuning the Al amount (143) and incorporating another element into the framework of zeolite to displace the original strong Brnsted acid sites."
          [5] "Therefore, a balance of such a trade-off can optimize the catalytic performance on Ga2O3/HZSM-5 treated at 700 C (Table 6)."
          [6] "Increasing Si/Al ratios is an option to weaken the acidity."
          [7] "Differently, Ren et al. tune the Si/Al molar ratio (i.e., 60242) of ZnO/HZSM-5 by varying the amount of Al source, namely, NaAlO2, during preparation."
          [8] "Introducing phosphorus into HZSM-5 is another option to displace the original strong Brnsted acid sites by newly created weakened Brnsted acid sites, as well as to improve hydrothermal stability."
          [9] "Clearly, reducing the number of acid sites on HZSM-5 is a more effective approach to boost C3H8 dehydrogenation to C3H6 than weakening the acidity."

[1] "ZSM-48, first synthesized by Chu [19],is another prospective candidate for supporting Ga2O3, because ZSM-48 is a high Si-containing zeolite with the uninterpenetrating linear 10-membered ring channels (0.530.56 nm) and its acid strength is relatively weaker than that of ZSM-5 [20]."
          [2] "The acidity of HZSM-48 supported Ga2O3 catalyst was also compared with that of supported HZSM-5. As described in Table 2,the total amount of acid sites on Ga2O3/HZSM-48 catalyst is quite similar to that on Ga2O3/HZSM-5 with similar Si/Al ratio, while the amount of medium to strong acid sites is much lower, indicating that the acid strength of Ga2O3/HZSM-48 is much weaker in comparison with that of Ga2O3/HZSM-5."
          [3] "The selectivity on Ga2O3/HZSM-48 was much higher than that on Ga2O3/HZSM-5 at low propane conversion. With the increase of propane conversion, the selectivity difference became smaller."
          [4] "The lower stability of Ga2O3/HZSM-48(130) may also be caused by its uninterpenetrating linear channels, which is easier to be blocked by the coke deposition during the reactions."
