          [1] "Beta zeolite was applied due to a three-dimensional structure,the pores larger than those of ZSM-5 with 12-membered ring openings (0.75 by 0.57 nm for linear and 0.65 by 0.56 nm for tortuous channels),a high thermal and acid stability and a large specific surface area needed for high chromium species dispersion [3335]."
          [2] "The Cr-containing SiBeta zeolite catalysts were ob- tained by two-step postsynthesis preparation procedure which consist, in the first step, removal of aluminum from TEABeta zeolite with Si/Al of 17 by treatment with nitric acid solution to obtain an aluminium-free SiBeta support with Si/Al ratio of 1000 and, in the second step, various amounts of Cr were introduced into the siliceous SiBeta zeolite structure by wet impregnation."
          [3] "Low acidity of SiBeta is suitable for achieving high selectivity to propene (above 80 %) while high acidity of starting AlBeta promotes propane cracking to lighter hydrocarbons."

          Zeolites, especially Beta zeolites, are promising support materials for CO2-ODHP catalysts due to their three-dimensional structure, larger pore size compared to ZSM-5, high thermal and acid stability, and large specific surface area, which is essential for high dispersion of chromium species. Dealumination, a method of removing aluminum from the zeolite structure, can significantly modify the acidity of the zeolite. This process, when applied to TEABeta zeolite, results in an aluminium-free SiBeta support with a high Si/Al ratio, which is beneficial for the dispersion of chromium species. The acidity of the zeolite support plays a crucial role in the catalytic performance. Low acidity, as seen in SiBeta, is advantageous for achieving high selectivity to propene, while high acidity, as in AlBeta, promotes the cracking of propane to lighter hydrocarbons, which is less desirable. The choice and implementation of acidity modification strategies, such as dealumination, should be carefully considered based on the specific type of zeolite used as a support and the desired catalytic outcome.

          沸石，特别是Beta沸石，由于其三维结构、与ZSM-5相比更大的孔径、高热稳定性和酸稳定性以及大比表面积，是CO2-ODHP催化剂的有希望的支撑材料，大比表面积对于高分散铬物种至关重要。脱铝，一种从沸石结构中去除铝的方法，可以显着改变沸石的酸性。当应用于TEABeta沸石时，该过程产生无铝的SiBeta支撑，具有高Si/Al比，这对铬物种的分散有利。沸石支撑的酸性在催化性能中起着至关重要的作用。低酸性，如SiBeta中所见，有利于提高丙烯的选择性，而高酸性，如AlBeta中所见，促进了丙烷向更轻的烃类的裂解，这是不那么理想的。选择和实施酸性改性策略，如脱铝，应根据用作支撑的具体沸石类型和所需的催化结果仔细考虑。
