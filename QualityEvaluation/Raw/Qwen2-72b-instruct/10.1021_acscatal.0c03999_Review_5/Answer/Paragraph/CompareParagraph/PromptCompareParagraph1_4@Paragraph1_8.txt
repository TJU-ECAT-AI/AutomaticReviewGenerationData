Zeolites, such as HZSM-5 with a high Si/Al ratio, are recognized as promising support materials for CO2-ODHP catalysts due to their high catalytic activity and stability in the dehydrogenation of propane to propene in the presence of CO2 \[10.1016/S0167-2991(07)80962-1\]. Dealumination and weakening methods are employed to modify the acidity of zeolites, which is crucial for optimizing catalytic performance by reducing the amount of strong acid sites that can cause catalyst deactivation through side reactions like oligomerization and cracking \[10.1016/S0167-2991(07)80962-1\]. The intrinsic properties of the supports, their interactions with gallium oxide, and the balance between enhancing catalyst activity and preventing catalyst deactivation are key considerations in selecting and implementing these strategies for different types of zeolites used as supports \[10.1016/S0167-2991(07)80962-1\].
                
                Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: The optimization of zeolite-supported catalysts for CO2-ODHP reactions involves a deep understanding of the properties and acidity modification techniques that influence catalytic performance. Future research should focus on developing novel dealumination and weakening methods that can precisely control the acidity of zeolites, leading to enhanced selectivity and stability. The exploration of zeolites with unique pore structures and tunable acidity, such as ZSM-48 and Beta zeolites, offers promising avenues for improving the efficiency of CO2-ODHP catalysts. Moreover, the integration of advanced characterization techniques and computational modeling can provide insights into the structure-activity relationships of zeolite-supported catalysts, guiding the design of more efficient and selective catalysts for CO2-ODHP reactions.

Zeolites, such as HZSM-5 with a high Si/Al ratio, are recognized as promising support materials for CO2-ODHP catalysts due to their high catalytic activity and stability in the dehydrogenation of propane to propene in the presence of CO2 \[10.1016/S0167-2991(07)80962-1\]. The modification of acidity through dealumination and weakening methods is crucial for optimizing catalytic performance, as it reduces the amount of strong acid sites that can cause catalyst deactivation through side reactions like oligomerization and cracking \[10.1016/S0167-2991(07)80962-1\]. Zeolites' high surface area, pore structure, and tunable acidity make them suitable for CO2-ODHP catalysts, with pore structure enhancing selectivity and efficiency of the catalytic process \[10.1039/C5CS00626K\]. Dealumination, which removes aluminum from the zeolite framework, can increase acidity and catalytic activity but may lead to structural instability and decreased surface area if excessive \[10.1039/C5CS00626K\]. Weakening methods, such as steam treatment or acid leaching, can reduce acidity, improving selectivity \[10.1039/C5CS00626K\]. The balance between acidity and stability, compatibility with active metal species, and effect on selectivity and yield of desired products are key considerations in selecting and implementing acidity modification strategies \[10.1016/j.cattod.2009.05.011\]. For instance, ZnO/HZSM-5 catalysts with a Si/Al ratio of 160 exhibit optimal performance for propane dehydrogenation to propene in the presence of CO2, achieving a propane conversion of 41.5% and a propene yield of 25.8% at steady state \[10.1016/j.cattod.2009.05.011\].
                
                Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: The advancements in modifying zeolite acidity for CO2-ODHP catalysts have opened up new avenues for enhancing catalytic performance. Future research might focus on developing novel dealumination techniques that maintain structural stability while reducing strong acid sites. Additionally, exploring the synergistic effects of different acidity modification methods could lead to more efficient catalysts. The integration of computational modeling with experimental studies could provide deeper insights into the optimal acidity for different zeolite types and reaction conditions. Moreover, the development of multifunctional zeolite supports that simultaneously address selectivity, stability, and activity could revolutionize CO2-ODHP catalysis. The exploration of alternative metal species and their interactions with modified zeolite supports could also be a promising direction for enhancing catalytic outcomes.
