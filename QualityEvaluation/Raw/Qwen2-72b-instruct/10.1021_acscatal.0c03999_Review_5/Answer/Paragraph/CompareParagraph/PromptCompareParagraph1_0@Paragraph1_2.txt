Zeolites, such as HZSM-5 with a high Si/Al ratio, are recognized as promising support materials for CO2-ODHP catalysts due to their high catalytic activity and stability in the dehydrogenation of propane to propene in the presence of CO2 \[10.1016/S0167-2991(07)80962-1\]. The modification of acidity through dealumination and weakening methods is crucial for optimizing catalytic performance by reducing the amount of strong acid sites that can cause catalyst deactivation through side reactions like oligomerization and cracking \[10.1016/S0167-2991(07)80962-1\]. Zeolites' high surface area, pore structure, and tunable acidity make them suitable for CO2-ODHP catalysts, as the pore structure provides a confined space for the reaction, enhancing selectivity and efficiency \[10.1039/C5CS00626K\]. Dealumination, which involves removing aluminum from the zeolite framework, can increase acidity and catalytic activity, but excessive dealumination can lead to structural instability and decreased surface area \[10.1039/C5CS00626K\]. Weakening methods, such as steam treatment or acid leaching, can reduce acidity, improving selectivity \[10.1039/C5CS00626K\]. The balance between the number of acid sites and their strength is critical for optimizing catalytic performance \[10.1021/acscatal.0c03999\_5\]. Increasing the Si/Al ratio can weaken acidity, and introducing phosphorus into HZSM-5 can displace strong Brnsted acid sites with weaker ones, improving hydrothermal stability \[10.1021/acscatal.0c03999\_5\]. Zeolites like ZSM-48, with high silicon content and relatively weaker acid strength compared to ZSM-5, are also promising for CO2-ODHP catalysts \[10.1016/j.jiec.2011.11.134\]. Dealumination and weakening methods can modify acidity, enhancing selectivity and stability, but excessive weakening may lead to lower activity \[10.1016/j.jiec.2011.11.134\]. ZSM-5's tri-dimensional micropore structure, large specific surface area, and medium pore size make it resistant to coking \[10.1002/cjoc.201100379\]. Dealumination and weakening methods, such as steaming treatment, can modify acidity by removing framework Al atoms and reducing the number of Brnsted acid sites \[10.1002/cjoc.201100379\]. Beta zeolites, with their three-dimensional structure and larger pore size compared to ZSM-5, are promising for CO2-ODHP catalysts due to their high thermal and acid stability \[10.1016/j.jcou.2019.09.018\]. Dealumination can significantly modify acidity, and low acidity in SiBeta supports high selectivity to propene \[10.1016/j.jcou.2019.09.018\]. ZnO/HZSM-5 catalysts with a Si/Al ratio of 160 exhibit the best performance for propane dehydrogenation to propene in the presence of CO2, achieving a propane conversion of 41.5% and a propene yield of 25.8% at steady state \[10.1016/j.cattod.2009.05.011\]. This is attributed to the appropriate amount of acid sites that promote the dehydrogenation reaction while suppressing side reactions \[10.1016/j.cattod.2009.05.011\].
                
                Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: The advancements in modifying zeolite acidity through dealumination and weakening methods have opened new avenues for optimizing CO2-ODHP catalysts. Future research might focus on developing novel methods for controlling acidity with greater precision, such as the use of templating agents or the incorporation of heteroatoms other than phosphorus. The exploration of zeolites with unique pore structures, such as ZSM-48, could lead to improved selectivity and stability in CO2-ODHP reactions. Moreover, the development of advanced characterization techniques could provide deeper insights into the relationship between zeolite structure and catalytic performance. The integration of computational modeling with experimental studies could also aid in the rational design of zeolite-supported catalysts for CO2-ODHP reactions, leading to enhanced catalytic activity and selectivity.

Dealumination, which involves removing aluminum from the zeolite framework, can increase acidity and catalytic activity but must be balanced against potential structural instability and surface area reduction \[10.1039/C5CS00626K\]. Weakening methods, such as steam treatment or acid leaching, can reduce acidity, improving selectivity \[10.1039/C5CS00626K\].

Increasing the Si/Al ratio can weaken acidity, and introducing phosphorus into HZSM-5 can displace strong Brnsted acid sites with weaker ones, improving hydrothermal stability \[10.1021/acscatal.0c03999\_5\]. However, reducing the number of acid sites on HZSM-5 is more effective for boosting C3H8 dehydrogenation to C3H6 than simply weakening the acidity \[10.1021/acscatal.0c03999\_5\].
                    
                    Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: The optimization of zeolite-supported catalysts for CO2-ODHP reactions involves a delicate balance between acidity, stability, and selectivity. Future research should focus on developing novel dealumination and weakening methods that can precisely control the acidity of zeolites without compromising their structural integrity or surface area. The exploration of new zeolite structures with tailored pore sizes and acidity could lead to enhanced catalytic performance. Additionally, the integration of advanced characterization techniques to monitor changes in acidity and surface properties during dealumination and weakening processes could provide insights into the optimal conditions for catalyst preparation. The development of multifunctional catalysts that combine the properties of different zeolites or incorporate additional metal species could also be a promising direction for improving selectivity and yield in CO2-ODHP reactions.
