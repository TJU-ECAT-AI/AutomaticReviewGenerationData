{"DOC": "Zeolites, such as HZSM-5 with high Si/Al ratio, are promising support materials for CO2-ODHP catalysts due to their high catalytic activity and stability in dehydrogenation of propane to propene in the presence of CO2. Dealumination and weakening methods are used to modify the acidity of zeolites, which can contribute to optimizing catalytic performance by reducing the amount of strong acid sites that cause catalyst deactivation through side reactions like oligomerization and cracking. The key considerations in selecting and implementing these strategies for different types of zeolites used as supports include the intrinsic properties of the supports, their interactions with gallium oxide, and the balance between enhancing catalyst activity and preventing catalyst deactivation.", "Doi": "10.1016/S0167-2991(07)80962-1"},
{"DOC": "Zeolites are promising support materials for CO2-ODHP catalysts due to their high surface area, pore structure, and acidity. The pore structure of zeolites provides a confined space for the reaction, which can enhance the selectivity and efficiency of the catalytic process. The acidity of zeolites can be modified through various techniques, such as dealumination and weakening methods, to optimize the catalytic performance. Dealumination involves removing aluminum from the zeolite framework, which can increase the acidity of the zeolite and improve its catalytic activity. However, excessive dealumination can lead to a loss of structural stability and a decrease in the surface area of the zeolite. Weakening methods, such as steam treatment or acid leaching, can reduce the acidity of the zeolite, which can improve the selectivity of the catalytic process.

Weakening acidity by tuning the Al amount or incorporating another element into the zeolite framework to displace strong Brnsted acid sites is an alternative approach to control surface acidity. The balance between the number of acid sites and their strength is crucial for optimizing catalytic performance. Increasing the Si/Al ratio is an option to weaken acidity, and introducing phosphorus into HZSM-5 can displace strong Brnsted acid sites with weaker ones, improving hydrothermal stability.

This process, when applied to TEABeta zeolite, results in an aluminium-free SiBeta support with a high Si/Al ratio, which is beneficial for the dispersion of chromium species. The acidity of the zeolite support plays a crucial role in the catalytic performance. Low acidity, as seen in SiBeta, is advantageous for achieving high selectivity to propene, while high acidity, as in AlBeta, promotes the cracking of propane to lighter hydrocarbons, which is less desirable.
