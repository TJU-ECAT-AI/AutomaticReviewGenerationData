Zeolites, such as HZSM-5 with a high Si/Al ratio, are recognized as promising support materials for CO2-ODHP catalysts due to their high catalytic activity and stability in the dehydrogenation of propane to propene in the presence of CO2 \[10.1016/S0167-2991(07)80962-1\]. The modification of acidity through dealumination and weakening methods is crucial for optimizing catalytic performance by reducing the amount of strong acid sites that can cause catalyst deactivation through side reactions like oligomerization and cracking \[10.1016/S0167-2991(07)80962-1\]. Zeolites' high surface area, pore structure, and tunable acidity make them suitable for CO2-ODHP catalysts, as the pore structure provides a confined space for the reaction, enhancing selectivity and efficiency \[10.1039/C5CS00626K\]. Dealumination, which involves removing aluminum from the zeolite framework, can increase acidity and catalytic activity, but excessive dealumination can lead to structural instability and decreased surface area \[10.1039/C5CS00626K\]. Weakening methods, such as steam treatment or acid leaching, can reduce acidity, improving selectivity \[10.1039/C5CS00626K\]. The balance between the number of acid sites and their strength is critical for optimizing catalytic performance \[10.1021/acscatal.0c03999_5\]. Increasing the Si/Al ratio can weaken acidity, and introducing phosphorus into HZSM-5 can displace strong Brnsted acid sites with weaker ones, improving hydrothermal stability \[10.1021/acscatal.0c03999_5\]. Zeolites like ZSM-48, with high silicon content and relatively weaker acid strength compared to ZSM-5, are also promising for CO2-ODHP catalysts \[10.1016/j.jiec.2011.11.134\]. Dealumination and weakening methods can modify acidity, enhancing selectivity and stability, but excessive weakening may lead to lower activity \[10.1016/j.jiec.2011.11.134\]. ZSM-5's tri-dimensional micropore structure, large specific surface area, and medium pore size make it resistant to coking \[10.1002/cjoc.201100379\]. Dealumination and weakening methods, such as steaming treatment, can modify acidity by removing framework Al atoms and reducing the number of Brnsted acid sites \[10.1002/cjoc.201100379\]. Beta zeolites, with their three-dimensional structure and larger pore size compared to ZSM-5, are promising for CO2-ODHP catalysts due to their high thermal and acid stability \[10.1016/j.jcou.2019.09.018\]. Dealumination can significantly modify acidity, and low acidity in SiBeta supports high selectivity to propene \[10.1016/j.jcou.2019.09.018\]. ZnO/HZSM-5 catalysts with a Si/Al ratio of 160 exhibit the best performance for propane dehydrogenation to propene in the presence of CO2, achieving a propane conversion of 41.5% and a propene yield of 25.8% at steady state \[10.1016/j.cattod.2009.05.011\]. This is attributed to the appropriate amount of acid sites that promote the dehydrogenation reaction while suppressing side reactions \[10.1016/j.cattod.2009.05.011\].
                ※※※
                Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: The advancements in modifying zeolite acidity through dealumination and weakening methods have opened new avenues for optimizing CO2-ODHP catalysts. Future research might focus on developing novel methods for controlling acidity with greater precision, such as the use of templating agents or the incorporation of heteroatoms other than phosphorus. The exploration of zeolites with unique pore structures, such as ZSM-48, could lead to improved selectivity and stability in CO2-ODHP reactions. Moreover, the development of advanced characterization techniques could provide deeper insights into the relationship between zeolite structure and catalytic performance. The integration of computational modeling with experimental studies could also aid in the rational design of zeolite-supported catalysts for CO2-ODHP reactions, leading to enhanced catalytic activity and selectivity.

The key considerations in selecting and implementing these strategies for different types of zeolites used as supports include the intrinsic properties of the supports, their interactions with gallium oxide, and the balance between enhancing catalyst activity and preventing catalyst deactivation \[10.1016/S0167-2991(07)80962-1\].
                    Zeolites are promising support materials for CO2-ODHP catalysts due to their high surface area, pore structure, and acidity \[10.1039/C5CS00626K\].

Dealumination involves removing aluminum from the zeolite framework, which can increase the acidity of the zeolite and improve its catalytic activity. However, excessive dealumination can lead to a loss of structural stability and a decrease in the surface area of the zeolite. Weakening methods, such as steam treatment or acid leaching, can reduce the acidity of the zeolite, which can improve the selectivity of the catalytic process. The key considerations in selecting and implementing these strategies for different types of zeolites used as supports include the type of zeolite, the reaction conditions, and the desired product distribution \[10.1039/C5CS00626K\].
                    The properties that make zeolites promising support materials for CO2-ODHP catalysts include their microporosity with a large surface area, tunable acidity, and excellent thermostability \[10.1021/acscatal.0c03999_5\]. Dealumination, achieved through acid treatment or steaming treatments, is used to eliminate surface acidity, which can lead to the cracking of C3H8 and the formation of undesired products. Weakening acidity by tuning the Al amount or incorporating another element into the zeolite framework to displace strong Brnsted acid sites is an alternative approach to control surface acidity. The balance between the number of acid sites and their strength is crucial for optimizing catalytic performance. Increasing the Si/Al ratio is an option to weaken acidity, and introducing phosphorus into HZSM-5 can displace strong Brnsted acid sites with weaker ones, improving hydrothermal stability. However, reducing the number of acid sites on HZSM-5 is more effective for boosting C3H8 dehydrogenation to C3H6 than simply weakening the acidity \[10.1021/acscatal.0c03999_5\].
                    Zeolites, such as ZSM-48, are promising support materials for CO2-ODHP catalysts due to their high silicon content, uninterpenetrating linear 10-membered ring channels, and relatively weaker acid strength compared to other zeolites like ZSM-5 \[10.1016/j.jiec.2011.11.134\]. Dealumination and weakening methods can modify the acidity of zeolites, which contributes to optimizing catalytic performance by reducing the number of medium to strong acid sites. Key considerations in selecting and implementing these strategies include the type of zeolite, the desired acid strength, and the potential for pore blockage by coke deposition during reactions. The modification of acidity can enhance selectivity and stability, but excessive weakening may lead to lower activity \[10.1016/j.jiec.2011.11.134\].

Dealumination and weakening methods, such as steaming treatment, can modify the acidity of zeolites by removing framework Al atoms and reducing the number of Brnsted acid sites. These modifications contribute to optimizing catalytic performance by creating an appropriate density of Brnsted acidic sites on the zeolite support, which is crucial for the dehydrogenation reaction. The key considerations in selecting and implementing these strategies for different types of zeolites used as supports include the severity of the steaming condition, which affects the acidity of the zeolite, and the balance between the number of acid sites and the dispersion of the active metal component on the support \[10.1002/cjoc.201100379\].
                    Zeolites, especially Beta zeolites, are promising support materials for CO2-ODHP catalysts due to their three-dimensional structure, larger pore size compared to ZSM-5, high thermal and acid stability, and large specific surface area, which is essential for high dispersion of chromium species \[10.1016/j.jcou.2019.09.018\]. Dealumination, a method of removing aluminum from the zeolite structure, can significantly modify the acidity of the zeolite. This process, when applied to TEABeta zeolite, results in an aluminium-free SiBeta support with a high Si/Al ratio, which is beneficial for the dispersion of chromium species. The acidity of the zeolite support plays a crucial role in the catalytic performance. Low acidity, as seen in SiBeta, is advantageous for achieving high selectivity to propene, while high acidity, as in AlBeta, promotes the cracking of propane to lighter hydrocarbons, which is less desirable. The choice and implementation of acidity modification strategies, such as dealumination, should be carefully considered based on the specific type of zeolite used as a support and the desired catalytic outcome \[10.1016/j.jcou.2019.09.018\].
                    Zeolites, such as HZSM-5, are promising support materials for CO2-ODHP catalysts due to their high surface area, micropore volume, and tunable acidity \[10.1016/j.cattod.2009.05.011\]. Dealumination and weakening methods can modify the acidity of zeolites, which is crucial for optimizing catalytic performance. These modifications contribute to enhancing the dehydrogenation activity of light paraffins by creating a suitable environment for the reaction mechanism involving dehydrogenation, oligomerization, and ring closure steps. The key considerations in selecting and implementing these strategies for different types of zeolites used as supports include the balance between acidity and stability, the compatibility with the active metal species, and the effect on the selectivity and yield of the desired products. For instance, ZnO/HZSM-5 catalysts with a Si/Al ratio of 160 exhibit the best performance for propane dehydrogenation to propene in the presence of CO2, achieving a propane conversion of 41.5% and a propene yield of 25.8% at steady state.

Low acidity, as seen in SiBeta, is advantageous for achieving high selectivity to propene, while high acidity, as in AlBeta, promotes the cracking of propane to lighter hydrocarbons, which is less desirable \[10.1016/j.jcou.2019.09.018\]. The choice and implementation of acidity modification strategies, such as dealumination, should be carefully considered based on the specific type of zeolite used as a support and the desired catalytic outcome \[10.1016/j.jcou.2019.09.018\].

                Zeolites, such as HZSM-5, are promising support materials for CO2-ODHP catalysts due to their high surface area, micropore volume, and tunable acidity \[10.1016/j.cattod.2009.05.011\]. Dealumination and weakening methods can modify the acidity of zeolites, which is crucial for optimizing catalytic performance \[10.1016/j.cattod.2009.05.011\]. These modifications contribute to enhancing the dehydrogenation activity of light paraffins by creating a suitable environment for the reaction mechanism involving dehydrogenation, oligomerization, and ring closure steps \[10.1016/j.cattod.2009.05.011\]. The balance between acidity and stability, the compatibility with the active metal species, and the effect on the selectivity and yield of the desired products are key considerations in selecting and implementing these strategies for different types of zeolites used as supports \[10.1016/j.cattod.2009.05.011\]. For instance, ZnO/HZSM-5 catalysts with a Si/Al ratio of 160 exhibit the best performance for propane dehydrogenation to propene in the presence of CO2, achieving a propane conversion of 41.5% and a propene yield of 25.8% at steady state \[10.1016/j.cattod.2009.05.011\]. This is attributed to the appropriate amount of acid sites that promote the dehydrogenation reaction while suppressing side reactions such as cracking, oligomerization, and aromatization \[10.1016/j.cattod.2009.05.011\].
