                Zeolites, such as HZSM-5 with a high Si/Al ratio, are recognized as promising support materials for CO2-ODHP catalysts due to their high catalytic activity and stability in the dehydrogenation of propane to propene in the presence of CO2 \[10.1016/S0167-2991(07)80962-1\]. Dealumination and weakening methods are employed to modify the acidity of zeolites, which can optimize catalytic performance by reducing the amount of strong acid sites that cause catalyst deactivation through side reactions like oligomerization and cracking \[10.1016/S0167-2991(07)80962-1\]. The intrinsic properties of the supports, their interactions with gallium oxide, and the balance between enhancing catalyst activity and preventing catalyst deactivation are key considerations in selecting and implementing these strategies for different types of zeolites used as supports \[10.1016/S0167-2991(07)80962-1\].

                Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: The optimization of zeolite-supported catalysts for CO2-ODHP reactions is a multifaceted endeavor that involves understanding the properties of zeolites, modifying their acidity through dealumination and weakening methods, and balancing the number and strength of acid sites to enhance catalytic performance. Future research should focus on developing more sophisticated methods for acidity modification that can precisely control the number and strength of acid sites, leading to improved selectivity and stability. Additionally, the exploration of new zeolite structures with tailored pore sizes and acidity could open up new avenues for enhancing the efficiency of CO2-ODHP reactions. The integration of computational modeling with experimental studies could provide deeper insights into the catalytic mechanisms and guide the design of more efficient catalysts. Moreover, the development of sustainable and environmentally friendly methods for dealumination and weakening could be a significant area of research, aiming to reduce the environmental impact of catalyst production.
