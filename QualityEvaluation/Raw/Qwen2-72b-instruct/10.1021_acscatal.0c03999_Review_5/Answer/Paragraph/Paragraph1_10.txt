The optimization of zeolite-supported catalysts for CO2-olefin direct dehydration hydrogenation (ODHP) reactions is a critical area of research in catalysis science, aiming to improve the efficiency and selectivity of these processes. Zeolites, with their unique pore structures and tunable acidity, offer a versatile platform for catalytic applications. Properties such as pore size, surface area, and acid site density play pivotal roles in determining the catalytic activity and selectivity. To enhance the performance of these catalysts, various acidity modification techniques have been explored, including metal doping, acid-base site adjustment, and structural modification. These strategies aim to fine-tune the acidity and improve the stability of the catalysts under reaction conditions. Performance enhancement is typically assessed through metrics such as conversion rate, selectivity to desired products, and catalyst longevity. By optimizing these properties and techniques, researchers aim to develop more efficient and sustainable catalysts for CO2-ODHP reactions, contributing to the broader goal of utilizing CO2 as a feedstock in chemical processes.
