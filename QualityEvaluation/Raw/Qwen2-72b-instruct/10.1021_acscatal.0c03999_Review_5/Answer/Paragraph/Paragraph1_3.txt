                    Zeolites, such as HZSM-5 with a high Si/Al ratio, are recognized as promising support materials for CO2-ODHP catalysts due to their high catalytic activity and stability in the dehydrogenation of propane to propene in the presence of CO2 \[10.1016/S0167-2991(07)80962-1\]. Dealumination and weakening methods are employed to modify the acidity of zeolites, which can contribute to optimizing catalytic performance by reducing the amount of strong acid sites that cause catalyst deactivation through side reactions like oligomerization and cracking \[10.1016/S0167-2991(07)80962-1\]. The intrinsic properties of the supports, their interactions with gallium oxide, and the balance between enhancing catalyst activity and preventing catalyst deactivation are key considerations in selecting and implementing these strategies for different types of zeolites used as supports \[10.1016/S0167-2991(07)80962-1\].

                    Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: The optimization of zeolite-supported catalysts for CO2-ODHP reactions is a multifaceted endeavor that requires a deep understanding of the properties and acidity of zeolites, as well as the effects of dealumination and weakening methods on catalytic performance. Future research should focus on developing more sophisticated methods for controlling the acidity of zeolites, such as the precise tuning of the Si/Al ratio and the incorporation of elements that can displace strong acid sites. Additionally, the exploration of new zeolite structures with unique pore architectures and acidity profiles could lead to the discovery of more efficient and selective catalysts for CO2-ODHP reactions. The integration of computational methods with experimental approaches could also provide insights into the optimal design of zeolite supports for CO2-ODHP catalysts, guiding the development of next-generation catalysts with enhanced performance.

                    HZSM-5等具有高Si/Al比的沸石被公认为CO2-ODHP催化剂的有前途的支撑材料，因为它们在CO2存在下将丙烷脱氢为丙烯时具有高催化活性和稳定性\[10.1016/S0167-2991(07)80962-1\]。脱铝和弱化方法用于修改沸石的酸性，这有助于通过减少导致催化剂失活的强酸位点的数量来优化催化性能\[10.1016/S0167-2991(07)80962-1\]。在为不同类型的沸石选择和实施这些策略作为支撑材料时，需要考虑支撑材料的内在性质、它们与镓氧化物的相互作用以及增强催化剂活性和防止催化剂失活之间的平衡\[10.1016/S0167-2991(07)80962-1\]。
