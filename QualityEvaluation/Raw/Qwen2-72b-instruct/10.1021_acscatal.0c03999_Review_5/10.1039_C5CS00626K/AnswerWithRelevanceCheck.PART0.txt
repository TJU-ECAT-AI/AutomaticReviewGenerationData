          Zeolites are promising support materials for CO2-ODHP catalysts due to their high surface area, pore structure, and acidity. The pore structure of zeolites provides a confined space for the reaction, which can enhance the selectivity and efficiency of the catalytic process. The acidity of zeolites can be modified through various techniques, such as dealumination and weakening methods, to optimize the catalytic performance. Dealumination involves removing aluminum from the zeolite framework, which can increase the acidity of the zeolite and improve its catalytic activity. However, excessive dealumination can lead to a loss of structural stability and a decrease in the surface area of the zeolite. Weakening methods, such as steam treatment or acid leaching, can reduce the acidity of the zeolite, which can improve the selectivity of the catalytic process. The key considerations in selecting and implementing these strategies for different types of zeolites used as supports include the type of zeolite, the reaction conditions, and the desired product distribution.

          沸石是CO2-ODHP催化剂有前途的支撑材料，因为它们具有高表面积、孔结构和酸性。沸石的孔结构为反应提供了受限的空间，可以增强催化过程的选择性和效率。沸石的酸性可以通过各种技术进行改性，如脱铝和弱化方法，以优化催化性能。脱铝涉及从沸石框架中去除铝，这可以增加沸石的酸性并提高其催化活性。然而，过度脱铝会导致沸石结构稳定性的丧失和表面积的减少。弱化方法，如蒸汽处理或酸浸，可以降低沸石的酸性，从而提高催化过程的选择性。选择和实施这些策略用于不同类型的沸石作为支撑的关键考虑因素包括沸石的类型、反应条件和所需的产品分布。
