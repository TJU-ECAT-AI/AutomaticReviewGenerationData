3.3. Zeolite-Supported Catalysts
As discussed in section 3.1.1.3, the nature of the support has a crucial role in affecting metal dispersion and preserving redox Cr species; therefore, it strongly influences catalytic performance in CO2ODHP. In addition to the aforementioned mesoporous silica and various metal oxides, zeolites are also promising support materials because of their microporosity with large surface area, tunable acidity, and excellent thermostability. (138140) To selectively activate CH bond rather than CC bond, the modification of acid sites is critical, especially the strong acid sites. (22) Dealumination is widely used to eliminate the surface acidity, and approaches include acid treatment (22) and steaming treatments at temperatures. (141,142) Weakening acidity is an alternative to control the surface acidity and can be achieved by tuning the Al amount (143) and incorporating another element into the framework of zeolite to displace the original strong Brnsted acid sites. (144) Zeolites that have been introduced as a support include Beta zeolite, (22) HZSM-5 (141) and phosphorus-modified HZSM-5, (144) HZSM-48, (145,146) and boron-containing MFI. (147)
3.3.1. Dealumination
3.3.1.1. Acid Treatment
Michorczyk et al. have prepared Cr-loaded Beta zeolite catalysts by wet impregnation for CO2ODHP. (22) Acid sites of the tetraethylammonium Beta (TEABeta) support are eliminated by dealumination with a nitric acid solution, resulting in SiBeta zeolite with Si/Al at 1000. For comparison, AlBeta is prepared by simple calcination of TEABeta with a lower Si/Al ratio of 17. As listed in Table 6, C3H8 and CO2 conversion and C3H6 selectivity show an increase with an increase in Cr loading on Cr-SiBeta catalysts under the same reaction conditions, and are all higher than those on Cr-AlBeta. This demonstrates that a high concentration of strong acid prefers C3H8 cracking, thus significantly promoting the formation of C2H6, C2H4, and CH4.

3.3.1.2. Steaming Treatment
Ga-loaded HZSM-5 catalysts become a potential candidate for CO2ODHP because of their reported high activity in aromatization of light paraffins. (148) The reaction is proposed to follow a bifunctional mechanism, in which Ga2O3 accounts for catalyzing propane dehydrogenation to light alkenes, while Brnsted acid sites are responsible for subsequent oligomerization of light alkenes and the cyclization of C6C9 alkenes. (148) To transfer this catalyst into CO2ODHP, treatments are necessary to eliminate the acid sites or weaken their strength on HZSM-5 by dealumination. Xu et al. have carried out dealumination on HZSM-5 zeolite (Si/Al = 60) by steaming treatments at temperatures (i.e., 600800 C), followed by loading Ga2O3 via IWI. (141) NH3TPD results indicate that the number of acid sites monotonically decreases with the rise of steaming temperature. The dealumination not only enables the reduction of the acid sites on HZSM-5, but it also weakens the interaction between Ga2O3 and HZSM-5, resulting in an additional decease in the number of acid sites. As proposed in Figure 10A, CO2ODHP proceeds through a heterolytic dissociation reaction pathway on the gallium oxide catalysts. The presence of strong acid sites on HZSM-5 can facilitate the conjugated effect of protons and gallium oxide, resulting in promoted activity (eq 3-10 in Figure 10A). However, excess acid sites on HZSM-5 can promote coke formation via oligomerization and cyclization, causing deactivation. Therefore, a balance of such a trade-off can optimize the catalytic performance on Ga2O3/HZSM-5 treated at 700 C (Table 6).
Zhu et al. eliminate the acid sites on boron-containing MFI zeolite-supported CrOx catalysts by steaming treatment. (147) Cr/H[B]MFI exhibits higher C3H8 conversion and C3H6 selectivity than the benchmark Cr/silicate-1 (Table 6). The steaming-treated catalyst, namely Cr/H[B]MFI-st, has comparable C3H6 selectivity, yet lower C3H8 conversion. Characterization results demonstrate that the steaming treatment results in the autoreduction of some Cr6+ to Cr3+ which is located at the ion-exchange sites in the vicinity of boron sites. As known in the literature, Cr3+ polychromate is less active for CO2ODHP than Cr6+ monochromate, though it still can catalyze the reaction. (80) This explains the lower conversion observed on Cr/H[B]MFI-st. Noteworthily, Cr/H[B]MFI-st presents higher C3H8 conversion after TOS = 40 h, indicating its better stability than Cr/H[B]MFI.
3.3.2. Surface Acidity Weakening
Increasing Si/Al ratios is an option to weaken the acidity. HZSM-48 is also a candidate of support material because of its medium pore size and high Si/Al molar ratio, accompanied by weaker acidity compared to HZSM-5. (145,146) Ren et al. have prepared a Ga2O3/HZSM-48 catalysts with the Si/Al ratios from 130 to 220, and performed comparative studies with Ga2O3/HZSM-5 for CO2ODHP. (149) HZSM-48 supported catalysts exhibit higher C3H6 selectivity than the HZSM-5 supported counterpart and comparable C3H6 yield, but lower C3H8 conversion (Table 6). Despite high selectivity, Ga2O3/HZSM-48 has worse stability than the HZSM-5-supported counterpart. This can be ascribed to weak-acid-induced side reactions, through which the formed coke clogs the 2D channels. This is reflected from the more serious degradation of pores on HZSM-48 after reaction than on HZSM-5.
Differently, Ren et al. tune the Si/Al molar ratio (i.e., 60242) of ZnO/HZSM-5 by varying the amount of Al source, namely, NaAlO2, during preparation. (143) As proposed, the reaction proceeds through dissociative adsorption of C3H8 on Zn oxide sites and a subsequent one-step elimination to produce H2 and C3H6. This requires that both [ZnC3H7]+ and the framework attached H+ ions are in proximity. Therefore, the presence of protons from the zeolite framework can facilitate the recovery of active sites, resulting in enhanced activity. However, excess acid sites are detrimental to the activity and stability because of the catalyzed reactions to form coke. Therefore, an optimal Si/Al ratio is obtained at 160 with the highest C3H6 yield (Table 6). At TOS = 10 h, the C3H8 conversion drops from 68.3% to 50.2%. Regeneration in O2 twice can help to completely recover the C3H8 conversion. Alternatively, dealumination of the ZnO/HZSM-5 catalysts has also been examined by a steaming treatment, and the 650 C-treated catalyst exhibits the highest C3H6 yield and C3H8 conversion (Table 6). (142) Introducing phosphorus into HZSM-5 is another option to displace the original strong Brnsted acid sites by newly created weakened Brnsted acid sites, as well as to improve hydrothermal stability. (144) Compared to the benchmark Ga2O3/HZSM-5, the enhanced activity and yield are evident (Table 6); yet the Ga2O3/P-HZSM-5 catalysts fail to show comparable C3H8 conversion or C3H6 yield to the steaming-treated, P-free catalyst Ga2O3/HZSM-5(700). The created weak acid sites barely show any promotional effect on C3H6 formation, while mainly on side reactions, thus leading to deactivation. Clearly, reducing the number of acid sites on HZSM-5 is a more effective approach to boost C3H8 dehydrogenation to C3H6 than weakening the acidity.
