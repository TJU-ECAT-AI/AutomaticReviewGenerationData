1.Analyze the properties that make zeolites promising support materials for CO2-ODHP catalysts, and critically evaluate the various acidity modification techniques, such as dealumination and weakening methods. How do these modifications contribute to optimizing catalytic performance, and what are the key considerations in selecting and implementing these strategies for different types of zeolites used as supports? The provided literature does not contain information about the properties of zeolites as support materials for CO2-ODHP catalysts, nor does it discuss acidity modification techniques such as dealumination and weakening methods. Therefore, I cannot provide relevant quotes from the literature. However, I can answer the question based on general knowledge in the field. Zeolites are promising support materials for CO2-ODHP catalysts due to their high surface area, uniform pore structure, and tunable acidity. Dealumination and other acidity modification techniques can adjust the acidity of zeolites, which is crucial for optimizing catalytic performance. The key considerations in selecting and implementing these strategies include the type of zeolite, the desired acidity level, and the specific reaction conditions. For example, dealumination can be achieved through thermal treatment or acid leaching, which can remove aluminum from the zeolite framework and reduce its acidity. However, excessive dealumination can lead to a loss of structural stability and a decrease in catalytic activity. Therefore, it is important to find the optimal balance between acidity and stability for each type of zeolite used as a support.

1.分析使沸石成为CO2-ODHP催化剂有希望的支撑材料的特性，并批判性地评估各种酸性改性技术，如脱铝和弱化方法。这些改性如何有助于优化催化性能，选择和实施这些策略用于不同类型的沸石作为支撑的关键考虑因素是什么？提供的文献没有包含关于沸石作为CO2-ODHP催化剂支撑材料的特性的信息，也没有讨论脱铝和弱化方法等酸性改性技术。因此，我无法从文献中提供相关引用。但是，我可以根据该领域的通用知识来回答这个问题。沸石是CO2-ODHP催化剂有希望的支撑材料，因为它们具有高表面积、均匀的孔结构和可调的酸性。脱铝和其他酸性改性技术可以调整沸石的酸性，这对优化催化性能至关重要。选择和实施这些策略的关键考虑因素包括沸石的类型、所需的酸性水平和特定的反应条件。例如，脱铝可以通过热处理或酸浸来实现，这可以从沸石框架中去除铝并降低其酸性。然而，过度脱铝会导致结构稳定性的丧失和催化活性的下降。因此，对于用作支撑的每种类型的沸石，找到酸性和稳定性之间的最佳平衡非常重要。
