[1] "The acidity of the supported gallium oxide catalysts was measured by NH3-TPD method and the results are summarized in Table 2. There is only one identifiable desorption peak at 264 oC in the NH3-TPD profile of HZSM-5, and the amount of desorbed NH3 is small. This can be attributed to the few framework Al existing in HZSM-5 zeolite because of the high Si/Al ratio. When gallium oxide is supported on HZSM-5, a second peak at 465 oC emerges in its NH3-TPD profile, indicating that some strong acid sites emerge on the catalyst. The acid amount of Ga2O3/HZSM-5 is more than triple of that of HZSM-5, suggesting that Ga2O3 on the support may be the cause for the strong acidity of the catalyst. Meanwhile, dealumination of HZSM-5 would weaken the acidity of the supported gallium oxide catalysts. As the steaming temperature rises, the acid strength and acid amount of the catalysts decrease markedly."
[2] "Obviously, the decrease in acid amount does not result only from the loss of acid sites present on HZSM-5, since the amount of acid sites reduced is greater than that of total acid sites the HZSM-5 originally possesses. The previous studies show that strong interactions between Ga2O3 species and the support enhance the acidity of the supported gallium oxide catalysts, so the extra decrease in acid amount may be connected with the weakening of the interaction between Ga2O3 species and the HZSM-5 support due to the dealumination of the zeolite."
[3] "The dehydrogenation of propane over gallium oxide or supported gallium oxide catalysts in the presence of CO2 has been suggested to proceed through a heterolytic dissociation reaction pathway. The surface strong acid site would facilitate the conjugated effect of proton and gallium oxide and in turn promote the dehydrogenation reaction. The decrease of the initial dehydrogenation activity over HZSM-5 supported gallium oxide catalysts with increasing Si/Al ratio of HZSM-5 support can be attributed to the reduction of the amount of strong acid sites. On the other hand, acid sites also catalyze coke formation via side reactions, such as oligomerization and cyclization. Catalyst deactivation in dehydrogenation reactions is mainly attributed to the coke deposition on the catalyst surface. Thus, inhibiting these side reactions through removing the excess acid sites present on the catalysts would improve the stability of the catalysts for propane dehydrogenation. This is probably the reason why the stability of supported Ga2O3 catalysts is significantly enhanced by reducing the amount of strong acid sites appropriately through steaming treatment of the HZSM-5 support."
[4] "It could be concluded that the strong acid sites on supported gallium oxide catalysts play two opposite roles in propane dehydrogenation reaction. The positive role is to enhance the catalyst activity by providing alternative reaction path to the slow step, and the negative role is to accelerate the catalyst deactivation by catalyzing a series of side reactions. Therefore, the amount of strong acid sites present on the catalysts is critical for gaining an optimal result, and this goal is achieved in the case of Ga2O3/HZSM-5(700)."

1. Zeolites, especially those with high Si/Al ratios, are promising support materials for CO2-ODHP catalysts due to their unique acidity properties. The acidity of zeolites can be modified through dealumination and weakening methods, which contribute to optimizing catalytic performance. Dealumination, achieved by steaming treatment, can remove framework Al from the zeolite, leading to a decrease in the amount and strength of acid sites. This process weakens the acidity of the supported gallium oxide catalysts, which is beneficial for reducing side reactions and coke formation, thus improving the stability of the catalysts for propane dehydrogenation. The weakening of the interaction between Ga2O3 species and the HZSM-5 support due to dealumination also contributes to the decrease in acid amount. The key considerations in selecting and implementing these strategies for different types of zeolites used as supports include the balance between the positive role of strong acid sites in enhancing catalyst activity and the negative role in accelerating catalyst deactivation. The goal is to achieve an optimal amount of strong acid sites on the catalysts, as demonstrated in the case of Ga2O3/HZSM-5(700).

1. 高硅铝比的沸石是CO2-ODHP催化剂有希望的支撑材料，因为它们具有独特的酸性性质。沸石的酸性可以通过脱铝和减弱的方法进行修改，这有助于优化催化性能。通过蒸煮处理去除沸石中的框架铝，可以实现脱铝，导致酸位点的数量和强度降低。这一过程削弱了支撑镓氧化物催化剂的酸性，有利于减少副反应和焦炭的形成，从而提高了丙烷脱氢催化剂的稳定性。由于脱铝，镓氧化物物种与HZSM-5支撑之间的相互作用减弱，也导致酸量的减少。在选择和实施这些策略时，对于用作支撑的不同类型的沸石，关键的考虑因素包括强酸位点在提高催化剂活性的积极作用和加速催化剂失活的负面作用之间的平衡。目标是在催化剂上实现强酸位点的最优数量，如Ga2O3/HZSM-5(700)的情况所示。
