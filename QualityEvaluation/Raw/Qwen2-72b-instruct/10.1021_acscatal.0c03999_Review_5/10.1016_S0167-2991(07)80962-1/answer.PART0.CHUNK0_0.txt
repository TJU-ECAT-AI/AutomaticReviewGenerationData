[1] "High catalytic activity and stability of dehydrogenation of propane to propene in the presence of CO2 were achieved over Ga2O3 catalyst supported on HZSM-5 with high Si/Al ratio."
[2] "The reaction mechanism on the titled catalyst was discussed."
[3] "The main problem of the current industrial process is that most catalysts, such as Cr2O3/Al2O3 [1] and Pt-Sn/Al2O3 [2], quickly deactivate during reaction, which is caused by the side reactions like oligomerization and cracking."
[4] "The oxidative dehydrogenation of propane by oxygen has been proposed as an alternative, since coke can be consumed timely by oxygen during the reaction."
[5] "However, the propene selectivity becomes a prominent problem because of the over-oxidation of propane to carbon dioxide."
[6] "Recently, oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes by carbon dioxide instead of oxygen has been reported to give rather high selectivity towards their corresponding alkenes over some catalysts, such as rare earth vanadates [3], supported Cr2O3 [4], and Ga2O3 [5,6]."
[7] "Unfortunately, the stability of these catalysts is still rather poor and the activity declines dramatically with reaction time, which is fatal for industrial application [3-6]."
[8] "Aromatization of light paraffins over Ga-promoted HZSM-5 catalysts has been studied intensely in the previous decades."
[9] "The aromatization reaction is thought to proceed via a bifunctional mechanism. Gallium oxide is responsible for catalyzing the dehydrogenation of propane while Bronsted acid sites account for catalyzing the oligomerization of light alkenes and the cyclization of C6  C9 alkenes [7-10]."
[10] "More recently, it has been discovered that carbon dioxide could markedly promote the dehydrogenation of ethane and propane over supported gallium oxide catalysts [11]."
[11] "Furthermore, distinct behavior is observed over different supported gallium oxide catalysts, such as Ga2O3/TiO2, Ga2O3/Al2O3, Ga2O3/ZrO2, Ga2O3/SiO2 and Ga2O3/MgO."
[12] "The support effect comes from their different H2 adsorption capacities and acid-base properties, caused by the intrinsic properties of the supports and their interactions with gallium oxide [12]."
[13] "The propene yield stabilized at about 22 % without observable deactivation in 100 h, which was thought to be caused by adjusting the acidity of the catalyst appropriately through dealumination of the zeolite."
[14] "The improvement of the catalyst stability with increasing Si/Al ratio can also be verified by measuring the coke deposited on the catalysts after on stream for 24 h."
[15] "The amount of coke reduces as the Si/Al ratio of the HZSM-5 support increases, and the reduction is more obvious initially."
[16] "The steady state conversion of propane for the catalysts is in the order of > Ga2O3/HZSM-5  Ga2O3/HZSM-5(800)  Ga2O3/silicalite."
[17] "The initial propane conversion decreases as the steaming temperature rises, indicating that the dealumination of the HZSM-5 support has a significant effect on the dehydrogenation activity of the supported gallium oxide catalysts."
[18] "Ga2O3/silicalite, which has no aluminium in the framework of the support, has the lowest initial activity."
[19] "The propane conversion of the supported gallium oxide catalysts is at least five times higher than that of the corresponding HZSM-5 supports (not shown)."
[20] "For all the supported catalysts, the propane conversion drops with reaction time and almost reaches steady state after 30 h."
[21] "The decreasing rate of the catalytic activity is much slower for those catalysts with the steaming temperature of the support higher than 650 oC, suggesting that the HZSM-5 supported gallium oxide catalysts are more resistant to deactivation after the dealumination of the support."
[22] "The best performance was observed over Ga2O3/HZSM-5(700) catalyst, i. e., the propane yield keeps steadily at 22% after the initial rise."
[23] "The propene yield is decreased as the steaming temperature of the HZSM-5 support is further increased, showing that over dealumination deteriorates the catalyst."
[24] "The acidity of the supported gallium oxide catalysts was measured by NH3-TPD method and the results are summarized in Table 2."
[25] "There is only one identifiable desorption peak at 264 oC in the NH3-TPD profile of HZSM-5, and the amount of desorbed NH3 is small."
[26] "This can be attributed to the few framework Al existing in HZSM-5 zeolite because of the high Si/Al ratio."
[27] "When gallium oxide is supported on HZSM-5, a second peak at 465 oC emerges in its NH3-TPD profile, indicating that some strong acid sites emerge on the catalyst."
[28] "The acid amount of Ga2O3/HZSM-5 is more than triple of that of HZSM-5, suggesting that Ga2O3 on the support may be the cause for the strong acidity of the catalyst."
[29] "Meanwhile, dealumination of HZSM-5 would weaken the acidity of the supported gallium oxide catalysts."
[30] "As the steaming temperature rises, the acid strength and acid amount of the catalysts decrease markedly."
[31] "The decrease in acid amount does not result only from the loss of acid sites present on HZSM-5, since the amount of acid sites reduced is greater than that of total acid sites the HZSM-5 originally possesses."
[32] "The previous studies show that strong interactions between Ga2O3 species and the support enhance the acidity of the supported gallium oxide catalysts [12, 15], so the extra decrease in acid amount may be connected with the weakening of the interaction between Ga2O3 species and the HZSM-5 support due to the dealumination of the zeolite."
[33] "The decrease of the initial dehydrogenation activity over HZSM-5 supported gallium oxide catalysts with increasing Si/Al ratio of HZSM-5 support can be attributed to the reduction of the amount of strong acid sites."
[34] "On the other hand, acid sites also catalyze coke formation via side reactions, such as oligomerization and cyclization."
[35] "Catalyst deactivation in dehydrogenation reactions is mainly attributed to the coke deposition on the catalyst surface."
[36] "Thus, inhibiting these side reactions through removing the excess acid sites present on the catalysts would improve the stability of the catalysts for propane dehydrogenation."
[37] "This is probably the reason why the stability of supported Ga2O3 catalysts is significantly enhanced by reducing the amount of strong acid sites appropriately through steaming treatment of the HZSM-5 support."
[38] "The strong acid sites on supported gallium oxide catalysts play two opposite roles in propane dehydrogenation reaction."
[39] "The positive role is to enhance the catalyst activity by providing alternative reaction path to the slow step, and the negative role is to accelerate the catalyst deactivation by catalyzing a series of side reactions."
[40] "Therefore, the amount of strong acid sites present on the catalysts is critical for gaining an optimal result,and this goal is achieved in the case of Ga2O3/HZSM-5(700)."

1.Zeolites, such as HZSM-5 with high Si/Al ratio, are promising support materials for CO2-ODHP catalysts due to their high catalytic activity and stability in dehydrogenation of propane to propene in the presence of CO2. The acidity of the catalyst can be adjusted through dealumination of the zeolite, which contributes to optimizing catalytic performance by reducing the amount of strong acid sites that cause side reactions leading to coke formation and catalyst deactivation. The key considerations in selecting and implementing these strategies for different types of zeolites used as supports include the intrinsic properties of the supports, their interactions with gallium oxide, and the balance between enhancing catalyst activity and inhibiting side reactions.
2.Dealumination of zeolites, such as HZSM-5, can weaken the acidity of the supported gallium oxide catalysts, which is beneficial for improving the stability of the catalysts for propane dehydrogenation. However, the reduction of the amount of strong acid sites also decreases the initial dehydrogenation activity. Therefore, the amount of strong acid sites present on the catalysts is critical for gaining an optimal result. The acidity modification techniques should be carefully selected and implemented to achieve a balance between enhancing catalyst activity and inhibiting side reactions, which is crucial for the performance of CO2-ODHP catalysts.

2.沸石的脱铝，如HZSM-5，可以削弱支撑氧化镓催化剂的酸性，这对提高丙烷脱氢催化剂的稳定性有益。然而，强酸位点数量的减少也会降低初始脱氢活性。因此，催化剂上存在的强酸位点的数量对于获得最佳结果至关重要。应仔细选择和实施酸性改性技术，以实现增强催化剂活性和抑制副反应之间的平衡，这对CO2-ODHP催化剂的性能至关重要。
