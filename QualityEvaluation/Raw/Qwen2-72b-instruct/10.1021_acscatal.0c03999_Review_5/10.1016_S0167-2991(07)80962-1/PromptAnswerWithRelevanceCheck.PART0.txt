[1] "High catalytic activity and stability of dehydrogenation of propane to propene in the presence of CO2 were achieved over Ga2O3 catalyst supported on HZSM-5 with high Si/Al ratio."
[2] "The reaction mechanism on the titled catalyst was discussed."
[3] "The main problem of the current industrial process is that most catalysts, such as Cr2O3/Al2O3 [1] and Pt-Sn/Al2O3 [2], quickly deactivate during reaction, which is caused by the side reactions like oligomerization and cracking."
[4] "The oxidative dehydrogenation of propane by oxygen has been proposed as an alternative, since coke can be consumed timely by oxygen during the reaction."
[5] "However, the propene selectivity becomes a prominent problem because of the over-oxidation of propane to carbon dioxide."
[6] "Recently, oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes by carbon dioxide instead of oxygen has been reported to give rather high selectivity towards their corresponding alkenes over some catalysts, such as rare earth vanadates [3], supported Cr2O3 [4], and Ga2O3 [5,6]."
[7] "Unfortunately, the stability of these catalysts is still rather poor and the activity declines dramatically with reaction time, which is fatal for industrial application [3-6]."
[8] "Aromatization of light paraffins over Ga-promoted HZSM-5 catalysts has been studied intensely in the previous decades."
[9] "The aromatization reaction is thought to proceed via a bifunctional mechanism. Gallium oxide is responsible for catalyzing the dehydrogenation of propane while Bronsted acid sites account for catalyzing the oligomerization of light alkenes and the cyclization of C6  C9 alkenes [7-10]."
[10] "More recently, it has been discovered that carbon dioxide could markedly promote the dehydrogenation of ethane and propane over supported gallium oxide catalysts [11]."
[11] "Furthermore, distinct behavior is observed over different supported gallium oxide catalysts, such as Ga2O3/TiO2, Ga2O3/Al2O3, Ga2O3/ZrO2, Ga2O3/SiO2 and Ga2O3/MgO."
[12] "The support effect comes from their different H2 adsorption capacities and acid-base properties, caused by the intrinsic properties of the supports and their interactions with gallium oxide [12]."
[13] "The propene yield stabilized at about 22 % without observable deactivation in 100 h, which was thought to be caused by adjusting the acidity of the catalyst appropriately through dealumination of the zeolite."
[14] "The improvement of the catalyst stability with increasing Si/Al ratio can also be verified by measuring the coke deposited on the catalysts after on stream for 24 h."
[15] "The amount of coke reduces as the Si/Al ratio of the HZSM-5 support increases, and the reduction is more obvious initially."
[16] "The steady state conversion of propane for the catalysts is in the order of > Ga2O3/HZSM-5  Ga2O3/HZSM-5(800)  Ga2O3/silicalite."
[17] "The initial propane conversion decreases as the steaming temperature rises, indicating that the dealumination of the HZSM-5 support has a significant effect on the dehydrogenation activity of the supported gallium oxide catalysts."
[18] "Ga2O3/silicalite, which has no aluminium in the framework of the support, has the lowest initial activity."
[19] "The propane conversion of the supported gallium oxide catalysts is at least five times higher than that of the corresponding HZSM-5 supports (not shown)."
[20] "For all the supported catalysts, the propane conversion drops with reaction time and almost reaches steady state after 30 h."
[21] "The decreasing rate of the catalytic activity is much slower for those catalysts with the steaming temperature of the support higher than 650 oC, suggesting that the HZSM-5 supported gallium oxide catalysts are more resistant to deactivation after the dealumination of the support."
[22] "The best performance was observed over Ga2O3/HZSM-5(700) catalyst, i. e., the propane yield keeps steadily at 22% after the initial rise."
[23] "The propene yield is decreased as the steaming temperature of the HZSM-5 support is further increased, showing that over dealumination deteriorates the catalyst."
[24] "The acidity of the supported gallium oxide catalysts was measured by NH3-TPD method and the results are summarized in Table 2."
[25] "There is only one identifiable desorption peak at 264 oC in the NH3-TPD profile of HZSM-5, and the amount of desorbed NH3 is small."
[26] "This can be attributed to the few framework Al existing in HZSM-5 zeolite because of the high Si/Al ratio."
[27] "When gallium oxide is supported on HZSM-5, a second peak at 465 oC emerges in its NH3-TPD profile, indicating that some strong acid sites emerge on the catalyst."
[28] "The acid amount of Ga2O3/HZSM-5 is more than triple of that of HZSM-5, suggesting that Ga2O3 on the support may be the cause for the strong acidity of the catalyst."
[29] "Meanwhile, dealumination of HZSM-5 would weaken the acidity of the supported gallium oxide catalysts."
[30] "As the steaming temperature rises, the acid strength and acid amount of the catalysts decrease markedly."
[31] "The decrease in acid amount does not result only from the loss of acid sites present on HZSM-5, since the amount of acid sites reduced is greater than that of total acid sites the HZSM-5 originally possesses."
[32] "The previous studies show that strong interactions between Ga2O3 species and the support enhance the acidity of the supported gallium oxide catalysts [12, 15], so the extra decrease in acid amount may be connected with the weakening of the interaction between Ga2O3 species and the HZSM-5 support due to the dealumination of the zeolite."
[33] "The decrease of the initial dehydrogenation activity over HZSM-5 supported gallium oxide catalysts with increasing Si/Al ratio of HZSM-5 support can be attributed to the reduction of the amount of strong acid sites."
[34] "On the other hand, acid sites also catalyze coke formation via side reactions, such as oligomerization and cyclization."
[35] "Catalyst deactivation in dehydrogenation reactions is mainly attributed to the coke deposition on the catalyst surface."
[36] "Thus, inhibiting these side reactions through removing the excess acid sites present on the catalysts would improve the stability of the catalysts for propane dehydrogenation."
[37] "This is probably the reason why the stability of supported Ga2O3 catalysts is significantly enhanced by reducing the amount of strong acid sites appropriately through steaming treatment of the HZSM-5 support."
[38] "The strong acid sites on supported gallium oxide catalysts play two opposite roles in propane dehydrogenation reaction."
[39] "The positive role is to enhance the catalyst activity by providing alternative reaction path to the slow step, and the negative role is to accelerate the catalyst deactivation by catalyzing a series of side reactions."
[40] "Therefore, the amount of strong acid sites present on the catalysts is critical for gaining an optimal result,and this goal is achieved in the case of Ga2O3/HZSM-5(700)."

1.高硅铝比的沸石，如HZSM-5，作为CO2-ODHP催化剂的支撑材料具有前景，因为它们在CO2存在下对丙烷脱氢至丙烯具有高催化活性和稳定性。通过沸石的脱铝可以调整催化剂的酸性，通过减少导致焦炭形成和催化剂失活的副反应的强酸位点数量，有助于优化催化性能。在为用作支撑材料的不同类型的沸石选择和实施这些策略时，关键考虑因素包括支撑材料的内在性质，它们与氧化镓的相互作用，以及增强催化剂活性和抑制副反应之间的平衡。
2.沸石的脱铝，如HZSM-5，可以削弱支撑氧化镓催化剂的酸性，这对提高丙烷脱氢催化剂的稳定性有益。然而，强酸位点数量的减少也会降低初始脱氢活性。因此，催化剂上存在的强酸位点的数量对于获得最佳结果至关重要。应仔细选择和实施酸性改性技术，以实现增强催化剂活性和抑制副反应之间的平衡，这对CO2-ODHP催化剂的性能至关重要。

1.Zeolites, with their high Si/Al ratio, have been shown to be promising support materials for CO2-ODHP catalysts due to their ability to achieve high catalytic activity and stability in the dehydrogenation of propane to propene in the presence of CO2. This is attributed to the adjustment of the acidity of the catalyst through dealumination of the zeolite, which helps to optimize catalytic performance.
2.Dealumination, a method of weakening the acidity of zeolites, has been found to contribute significantly to the optimization of catalytic performance in CO2-ODHP reactions. By adjusting the acidity of the catalyst, dealumination helps to inhibit side reactions that lead to catalyst deactivation, such as oligomerization and cracking, thereby improving the stability of the catalyst.
3.Key considerations in selecting and implementing dealumination and other acidity modification techniques for different types of zeolites used as supports include the intrinsic properties of the supports and their interactions with gallium oxide. The steaming temperature of the support is a critical factor, as it affects the Si/Al ratio and, consequently, the acidity and catalytic activity of the supported gallium oxide catalysts. Over dealumination can lead to a decrease in propene yield, indicating that the optimal level of dealumination is crucial for achieving the best catalytic performance.
4.The role of CO2 in CO2-ODHP reactions is to eliminate coke formed on the catalyst surface, thereby enhancing the stability of the catalyst. However, the introduction of CO2 into the feed gas can also suppress the dehydrogenation activity of the catalyst, and the optimal CO2/C3H8 ratio for achieving the highest activity after 6 h on stream is 2.

1.具有高Si/Al比的沸石已被证明是CO2-ODHP催化剂有前途的支撑材料，因为它们能够在CO2存在下实现丙烷脱氢至丙烯的高催化活性和稳定性。这归因于通过沸石的脱铝调整催化剂的酸性，有助于优化催化性能。
2.脱铝，一种削弱沸石酸性的方法，已被发现对CO2-ODHP反应中催化性能的优化有重大贡献。通过调整催化剂的酸性，脱铝有助于抑制导致催化剂失活的副反应，如聚合和裂化，从而提高催化剂的稳定性。
3.在选择和实施脱铝和其他酸性改性技术用于不同类型的沸石作为支撑时的关键考虑因素包括支撑的内在性质及其与氧化镓的相互作用。支撑的蒸汽温度是一个关键因素，因为它影响Si/Al比，进而影响支撑氧化镓催化剂的酸性和催化活性。过度脱铝会导致丙烯产量下降，表明达到最佳催化性能所需的脱铝水平至关重要。
4.CO2在CO2-ODHP反应中的作用是消除催化剂表面形成的焦炭，从而增强催化剂的稳定性。然而，将CO2引入进料气体中也会抑制催化剂的脱氢活性，达到最高活性后6小时的最优CO2/C3H8比为2。

1. Zeolites, especially those with high Si/Al ratios, are promising support materials for CO2-ODHP catalysts due to their unique acidity properties. The acidity of zeolites can be modified through dealumination and weakening methods, which contribute to optimizing catalytic performance. Dealumination, achieved by steaming treatment, can remove framework Al from the zeolite, leading to a decrease in the amount and strength of acid sites. This process weakens the acidity of the supported gallium oxide catalysts, which is beneficial for reducing side reactions and coke formation, thus improving the stability of the catalysts for propane dehydrogenation. The weakening of the interaction between Ga2O3 species and the HZSM-5 support due to dealumination also contributes to the decrease in acid amount. The key considerations in selecting and implementing these strategies for different types of zeolites used as supports include the balance between the positive role of strong acid sites in enhancing catalyst activity and the negative role in accelerating catalyst deactivation. The goal is to achieve an optimal amount of strong acid sites on the catalysts, as demonstrated in the case of Ga2O3/HZSM-5(700).

1. 高硅铝比的沸石是CO2-ODHP催化剂有希望的支撑材料，因为它们具有独特的酸性性质。沸石的酸性可以通过脱铝和减弱的方法进行修改，这有助于优化催化性能。通过蒸煮处理去除沸石中的框架铝，可以实现脱铝，导致酸位点的数量和强度降低。这一过程削弱了支撑镓氧化物催化剂的酸性，有利于减少副反应和焦炭的形成，从而提高了丙烷脱氢催化剂的稳定性。由于脱铝，镓氧化物物种与HZSM-5支撑之间的相互作用减弱，也导致酸量的减少。在选择和实施这些策略时，对于用作支撑的不同类型的沸石，关键的考虑因素包括强酸位点在提高催化剂活性的积极作用和加速催化剂失活的负面作用之间的平衡。目标是在催化剂上实现强酸位点的最优数量，如Ga2O3/HZSM-5(700)的情况所示。

[11] "Furthermore, distinct behavior is observed over different supported gallium oxide catalysts, such as Ga2O3/TiO2, Ga2O3/Al2O3, Ga2O3/ZrO2, Ga2O3/SiO2 and Ga2O3/MgO."
[12] "The support effect comes from their different H2 adsorption capacities and acid-base properties, caused by the intrinsic properties of the supports and their interactions with gallium oxide [12]."
[13] "The possible reasons for the superior catalytic behavior were discussed."

[25] "As the steaming temperature rises, the acid strength and acid amount of the catalysts decrease markedly."

1.Zeolites, such as HZSM-5 with high Si/Al ratio, are promising support materials for CO2-ODHP catalysts due to their high catalytic activity and stability in dehydrogenation of propane to propene in the presence of CO2. Dealumination and weakening methods are used to modify the acidity of zeolites, which can contribute to optimizing catalytic performance by reducing the amount of strong acid sites that cause catalyst deactivation through side reactions like oligomerization and cracking. The key considerations in selecting and implementing these strategies for different types of zeolites used as supports include the intrinsic properties of the supports, their interactions with gallium oxide, and the balance between enhancing catalyst activity and preventing catalyst deactivation.
2.Dealumination of HZSM-5 support has a significant effect on the dehydrogenation activity of the supported gallium oxide catalysts. Ga2O3/silicalite, which has no aluminium in the framework of the support, has the lowest initial activity. The decreasing rate of the catalytic activity is much slower for those catalysts with the steaming temperature of the support higher than 650 oC, suggesting that the HZSM-5 supported gallium oxide catalysts are more resistant to deactivation after the dealumination of the support. The improvement of the catalyst stability with increasing Si/Al ratio can also be verified by measuring the coke deposited on the catalysts after on stream for 24 h. The steady state conversion of propane for the catalysts is in the order of > Ga2O3/HZSM-5  Ga2O3/HZSM-5(800)  Ga2O3/silicalite.

1.沸石，如具有高硅铝比的HZSM-5，是CO2-ODHP催化剂有希望的支撑材料，因为它们在二氧化碳存在下将丙烷脱氢为丙烯时具有高催化活性和稳定性。脱铝和弱化方法用于修改沸石的酸性，这可以通过减少导致催化剂失活的强酸位点的数量，通过副反应如聚合和裂化，从而优化催化性能。在为不同类型的用作支撑的沸石选择和实施这些策略时，主要考虑因素包括支撑的内在性质，它们与氧化镓的相互作用，以及在增强催化剂活性和防止催化剂失活之间的平衡。
2.脱铝的HZSM-5支撑对支撑的氧化镓催化剂的脱氢活性有显著影响。Ga2O3/silicalite，其支撑框架中不含铝，具有最低的初始活性。催化活性的下降率对于那些支撑温度高于650°C的催化剂要慢得多，这表明在支撑的脱铝后，HZSM-5支撑的氧化镓催化剂对失活的抵抗力更强。通过测量催化剂在流经24小时后沉积的焦炭，可以验证随着硅铝比的增加，催化剂稳定性的提高。对于催化剂，丙烷的稳态转化率的顺序为> Ga2O3/HZSM-5  Ga2O3/HZSM-5(800)  Ga2O3/silicalite。
3.通过NH3-TPD方法测量了支撑的氧化镓催化剂的酸性。在HZSM-5的NH3-TPD轮廓中，只有一个可识别的解吸峰在264°C，解吸的NH3量很小。这可以归因于HZSM-5沸石中由于高硅铝比而存在的少量框架铝。当氧化镓支撑在HZSM-5上时，其NH3-TPD轮廓中出现了一个465°C的第二个峰，表明催化剂上出现了一些强酸位点。Ga2O3/HZSM-5的酸量是HZSM-5的三倍多，这表明支撑上的氧化镓可能是催化剂强酸性的原因。同时，HZSM-5的脱铝会削弱支撑的氧化镓催化剂的酸性。随着蒸煮温度的升高，催化剂的酸强度和酸量明显下降。显然，酸量的减少不仅仅是因为HZSM-5上存在的酸位点的损失，因为减少的酸位点的数量大于HZSM-5最初拥有的总酸位点的数量。以前的研究表明，氧化镓物种和支撑之间的强烈相互作用增强了支撑的氧化镓催化剂的酸性，因此，酸量的额外减少可能与由于沸石的脱铝导致的氧化镓物种和HZSM-5支撑之间的相互作用的减弱有关。
4.脱氢反应中的催化剂失活主要归因于催化剂表面的焦炭沉积。因此，通过去除催化剂上存在的过量酸位点来抑制这些副反应将提高催化剂对丙烷脱氢的稳定性。这可能是通过适当减少HZSM-5支撑的强酸位点的数量，通过蒸煮处理来增强支撑的氧化镓催化剂的稳定性。可以得出结论，支撑的氧化镓催化剂上的强酸位点在丙烷脱氢反应中起着两个相反的作用。积极作用是通过为缓慢步骤提供替代反应路径来增强催化剂活性，而消极作用是通过催化一系列副反应来加速催化剂失活。因此，催化剂上存在的强酸位点的数量对于获得最佳结果至关重要，这一目标在Ga2O3/HZSM-5(700)的情况下实现。
