[1] "The acidity of the supported gallium oxide catalysts was measured by NH3-TPD method and the results are summarized in Table 2. There is only one identifiable desorption peak at 264 oC in the NH3-TPD profile of HZSM-5, and the amount of desorbed NH3 is small. This can be attributed to the few framework Al existing in HZSM-5 zeolite because of the high Si/Al ratio."
[2] "When gallium oxide is supported on HZSM-5, a second peak at 465 oC emerges in its NH3-TPD profile, indicating that some strong acid sites emerge on the catalyst."
[3] "The acid amount of Ga2O3/HZSM-5 is more than triple of that of HZSM-5, suggesting that Ga2O3 on the support may be the cause for the strong acidity of the catalyst."
[4] "Meanwhile, dealumination of HZSM-5 would weaken the acidity of the supported gallium oxide catalysts. As the steaming temperature rises, the acid strength and acid amount of the catalysts decrease markedly."
[5] "The decrease of the initial dehydrogenation activity over HZSM-5 supported gallium oxide catalysts with increasing Si/Al ratio of HZSM-5 support can be attributed to the reduction of the amount of strong acid sites."
[6] "On the other hand, acid sites also catalyze coke formation via side reactions, such as oligomerization and cyclization."
[7] "Catalyst deactivation in dehydrogenation reactions is mainly attributed to the coke deposition on the catalyst surface. Thus, inhibiting these side reactions through removing the excess acid sites present on the catalysts would improve the stability of the catalysts for propane dehydrogenation."
[8] "This is probably the reason why the stability of supported Ga2O3 catalysts is significantly enhanced by reducing the amount of strong acid sites appropriately through steaming treatment of the HZSM-5 support."
[9] "It could be concluded that the strong acid sites on supported gallium oxide catalysts play two opposite roles in propane dehydrogenation reaction. The positive role is to enhance the catalyst activity by providing alternative reaction path to the slow step, and the negative role is to accelerate the catalyst deactivation by catalyzing a series of side reactions."

1.Zeolites, such as HZSM-5, are promising support materials for CO2-ODHP catalysts due to their high Si/Al ratio, which results in fewer framework Al and thus lower acidity. This property is beneficial for the dehydrogenation of propane to propene in the presence of CO2.
2.Dealumination, a method of weakening the acidity of zeolites, contributes to optimizing catalytic performance by reducing the amount of strong acid sites. This modification can improve the stability of the catalysts for propane dehydrogenation by inhibiting side reactions that lead to coke formation and catalyst deactivation.
3.The key considerations in selecting and implementing these strategies for different types of zeolites used as supports include the balance between the positive and negative roles of strong acid sites. While strong acid sites can enhance catalyst activity by providing alternative reaction paths, they can also accelerate catalyst deactivation by catalyzing side reactions. Therefore, the amount of strong acid sites present on the catalysts is critical for gaining an optimal result.
4.In the case of Ga2O3/HZSM-5(700), the amount of strong acid sites is appropriately reduced through steaming treatment of the HZSM-5 support, resulting in a highly stable catalyst for dehydrogenation of propane to propene in the presence of CO2.

1.沸石，如HZSM-5，由于其高硅铝比，导致框架铝较少，酸性较低，因此是CO2-ODHP催化剂的有前途的支撑材料。这一特性有利于在CO2存在下将丙烷脱氢为丙烯。
2.脱铝，一种削弱沸石酸性的方法，通过减少强酸位点的数量来优化催化性能，从而提高丙烷脱氢催化剂的稳定性，抑制导致焦炭形成和催化剂失活的副反应。
3.在选择和实施不同类型的沸石作为支撑材料的这些策略时，关键考虑因素包括强酸位点的正负作用之间的平衡。虽然强酸位点可以通过提供替代反应路径来增强催化剂活性，但它们也可以通过催化副反应加速催化剂失活。因此，催化剂上强酸位点的数量对于获得最佳结果至关重要。
4.在Ga2O3/HZSM-5(700)的情况下，通过HZSM-5支撑的蒸汽处理，强酸位点的数量适当地减少，从而产生了一种在CO2存在下将丙烷脱氢为丙烯的高稳定催化剂。
