[1] "High catalytic activity and stability of dehydrogenation of propane to propene in the presence of CO2 were achieved over Ga2O3 catalyst supported on HZSM-5 with high Si/Al ratio."
[2] "The propene yield stabilized at about 22 % without observable deactivation in 100 h, which was thought to be caused by adjusting the acidity of the catalyst appropriately through dealumination of the zeolite."
[3] "The reaction mechanism on the titled catalyst was discussed."
[4] "The main problem of the current industrial process is that most catalysts, such as Cr2O3/Al2O3 [1] and Pt-Sn/Al2O3 [2], quickly deactivate during reaction, which is caused by the side reactions like oligomerization and cracking."
[5] "The oxidative dehydrogenation of propane by oxygen has been proposed as an alternative, since coke can be consumed timely by oxygen during the reaction."
[6] "However, the propene selectivity becomes a prominent problem because of the over-oxidation of propane to carbon dioxide."
[7] "Recently, oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes by carbon dioxide instead of oxygen has been reported to give rather high selectivity towards their corresponding alkenes over some catalysts, such as rare earth vanadates [3], supported Cr2O3 [4], and Ga2O3 [5,6]."
[8] "Unfortunately, the stability of these catalysts is still rather poor and the activity declines dramatically with reaction time, which is fatal for industrial application [3-6]."
[9] "Aromatization of light paraffins over Ga-promoted HZSM-5 catalysts has been studied intensely in the previous decades."
[10] "The aromatization reaction is thought to proceed via a bifunctional mechanism. Gallium oxide is responsible for catalyzing the dehydrogenation of propane while Bronsted acid sites account for catalyzing the oligomerization of light alkenes and the cyclization of C6  C9 alkenes [7-10]."
[11] "More recently, it has been discovered that carbon dioxide could markedly promote the dehydrogenation of ethane and propane over supported gallium oxide catalysts [11]."
[12] "Furthermore, distinct behavior is observed over different supported gallium oxide catalysts, such as Ga2O3/TiO2, Ga2O3/Al2O3, Ga2O3/ZrO2, Ga2O3/SiO2 and Ga2O3/MgO. The support effect comes from their different H2 adsorption capacities and acid-base properties, caused by the intrinsic properties of the supports and their interactions with gallium oxide [12]."
[13] "The initial propane conversion decreases as the steaming temperature rises, indicating that the dealumination of the HZSM-5 support has a significant effect on the dehydrogenation activity of the supported gallium oxide catalysts."
[14] "The decreasing rate of the catalytic activity is much slower for those catalysts with the steaming temperature of the support higher than 650 oC, suggesting that the HZSM-5 supported gallium oxide catalysts are more resistant to deactivation after the dealumination of the support."
[15] "The improvement of the catalyst stability with increasing Si/Al ratio can also be verified by measuring the coke deposited on the catalysts after on stream for 24 h."
[16] "The amount of coke reduces as the Si/Al ratio of the HZSM-5 support increases, and the reduction is more obvious initially."
[17] "The steady state conversion of propane for the catalysts is in the order of > Ga2O3/HZSM-5  Ga2O3/HZSM-5(800)  Ga2O3/silicalite."
[18] "The initial rise in propene yield is due to the sharp increase in the propene selectivity in the initial period of reaction."
[19] "The propene yield is decreased as the steaming temperature of the HZSM-5 support is further increased, showing that over dealumination deteriorates the catalyst."
[20] "The acidity of the supported gallium oxide catalysts was measured by NH3-TPD method and the results are summarized in Table 2."
[21] "There is only one identifiable desorption peak at 264 oC in the NH3-TPD profile of HZSM-5, and the amount of desorbed NH3 is small."
[22] "When gallium oxide is supported on HZSM-5, a second peak at 465 oC emerges in its NH3-TPD profile, indicating that some strong acid sites emerge on the catalyst."
[23] "The acid amount of Ga2O3/HZSM-5 is more than triple of that of HZSM-5, suggesting that Ga2O3 on the support may be the cause for the strong acidity of the catalyst."
[24] "Meanwhile, dealumination of HZSM-5 would weaken the acidity of the supported gallium oxide catalysts."
[25] "As the steaming temperature rises, the acid strength and acid amount of the catalysts decrease markedly."
[26] "The decrease of the initial dehydrogenation activity over HZSM-5 supported gallium oxide catalysts with increasing Si/Al ratio of HZSM-5 support can be attributed to the reduction of the amount of strong acid sites."
[27] "On the other hand, acid sites also catalyze coke formation via side reactions, such as oligomerization and cyclization."
[28] "Catalyst deactivation in dehydrogenation reactions is mainly attributed to the coke deposition on the catalyst surface."
[29] "Thus, inhibiting these side reactions through removing the excess acid sites present on the catalysts would improve the stability of the catalysts for propane dehydrogenation."
[30] "The strong acid sites on supported gallium oxide catalysts play two opposite roles in propane dehydrogenation reaction."
[31] "The positive role is to enhance the catalyst activity by providing alternative reaction path to the slow step, and the negative role is to accelerate the catalyst deactivation by catalyzing a series of side reactions."
[32] "Therefore, the amount of strong acid sites present on the catalysts is critical for gaining an optimal result."
[33] "The main role of CO2 here is to eliminate coke formed on catalyst surface."
[34] "The effect of CO2 partial pressure on the dehydrogenation of propane over Ga2O3/HZSM-5(700) catalyst was also studied, and the results are shown in Fig. 5(b)."
[35] "The initial propane conversion decreases as the CO2/C3H8 ratio rises, but the introduction of CO2 into the feed gas enhance the stability of catalyst."
[36] "However, too much CO2 will suppress the dehydrogenation activity of the catalyst."

1.Zeolites, with their high Si/Al ratio, have been shown to be promising support materials for CO2-ODHP catalysts due to their ability to achieve high catalytic activity and stability in the dehydrogenation of propane to propene in the presence of CO2. This is attributed to the adjustment of the acidity of the catalyst through dealumination of the zeolite, which helps to optimize catalytic performance.
2.Dealumination, a method of weakening the acidity of zeolites, has been found to contribute significantly to the optimization of catalytic performance in CO2-ODHP reactions. By adjusting the acidity of the catalyst, dealumination helps to inhibit side reactions that lead to catalyst deactivation, such as oligomerization and cracking, thereby improving the stability of the catalyst.
3.Key considerations in selecting and implementing dealumination and other acidity modification techniques for different types of zeolites used as supports include the intrinsic properties of the supports and their interactions with gallium oxide. The steaming temperature of the support is a critical factor, as it affects the Si/Al ratio and, consequently, the acidity and catalytic activity of the supported gallium oxide catalysts. Over dealumination can lead to a decrease in propene yield, indicating that the optimal level of dealumination is crucial for achieving the best catalytic performance.
4.The role of CO2 in CO2-ODHP reactions is to eliminate coke formed on the catalyst surface, thereby enhancing the stability of the catalyst. However, the introduction of CO2 into the feed gas can also suppress the dehydrogenation activity of the catalyst, and the optimal CO2/C3H8 ratio for achieving the highest activity after 6 h on stream is 2.

1.具有高Si/Al比的沸石已被证明是CO2-ODHP催化剂有前途的支撑材料，因为它们能够在CO2存在下实现丙烷脱氢至丙烯的高催化活性和稳定性。这归因于通过沸石的脱铝调整催化剂的酸性，有助于优化催化性能。
2.脱铝，一种削弱沸石酸性的方法，已被发现对CO2-ODHP反应中催化性能的优化有重大贡献。通过调整催化剂的酸性，脱铝有助于抑制导致催化剂失活的副反应，如聚合和裂化，从而提高催化剂的稳定性。
3.在选择和实施脱铝和其他酸性改性技术用于不同类型的沸石作为支撑时的关键考虑因素包括支撑的内在性质及其与氧化镓的相互作用。支撑的蒸汽温度是一个关键因素，因为它影响Si/Al比，进而影响支撑氧化镓催化剂的酸性和催化活性。过度脱铝会导致丙烯产量下降，表明达到最佳催化性能所需的脱铝水平至关重要。
4.CO2在CO2-ODHP反应中的作用是消除催化剂表面形成的焦炭，从而增强催化剂的稳定性。然而，将CO2引入进料气体中也会抑制催化剂的脱氢活性，达到最高活性后6小时的最优CO2/C3H8比为2。
