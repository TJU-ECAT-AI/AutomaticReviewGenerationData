          [1] "High catalytic activity and stability of dehydrogenation of propane to propene in the presence of CO2 were achieved over Ga2O3 catalyst supported on HZSM-5 with high Si/Al ratio."
          [2] "The reaction mechanism on the titled catalyst was discussed."
          [3] "The main problem of the current industrial process is that most catalysts, such as Cr2O3/Al2O3 [1] and Pt-Sn/Al2O3 [2], quickly deactivate during reaction, which is caused by the side reactions like oligomerization and cracking."
          [4] "The oxidative dehydrogenation of propane by oxygen has been proposed as an alternative, since coke can be consumed timely by oxygen during the reaction."
          [5] "However, the propene selectivity becomes a prominent problem because of the over-oxidation of propane to carbon dioxide."
          [6] "Recently, oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes by carbon dioxide instead of oxygen has been reported to give rather high selectivity towards their corresponding alkenes over some catalysts, such as rare earth vanadates [3], supported Cr2O3 [4], and Ga2O3 [5,6]."
          [7] "Unfortunately, the stability of these catalysts is still rather poor and the activity declines dramatically with reaction time, which is fatal for industrial application [3-6]."
          [8] "Aromatization of light paraffins over Ga-promoted HZSM-5 catalysts has been studied intensely in the previous decades."
          [9] "The aromatization reaction is thought to proceed via a bifunctional mechanism. Gallium oxide is responsible for catalyzing the dehydrogenation of propane while Bronsted acid sites account for catalyzing the oligomerization of light alkenes and the cyclization of C6  C9 alkenes [7-10]."
          [10] "More recently, it has been discovered that carbon dioxide could markedly promote the dehydrogenation of ethane and propane over supported gallium oxide catalysts [11]."
          [11] "Furthermore, distinct behavior is observed over different supported gallium oxide catalysts, such as Ga2O3/TiO2, Ga2O3/Al2O3, Ga2O3/ZrO2, Ga2O3/SiO2 and Ga2O3/MgO."
          [12] "The support effect comes from their different H2 adsorption capacities and acid-base properties, caused by the intrinsic properties of the supports and their interactions with gallium oxide [12]."
          [13] "The possible reasons for the superior catalytic behavior were discussed."
          [14] "The initial propane conversion decreases as the steaming temperature rises, indicating that the dealumination of the HZSM-5 support has a significant effect on the dehydrogenation activity of the supported gallium oxide catalysts."
          [15] "Ga2O3/silicalite, which has no aluminium in the framework of the support, has the lowest initial activity."
          [16] "The decreasing rate of the catalytic activity is much slower for those catalysts with the steaming temperature of the support higher than 650 oC, suggesting that the HZSM-5 supported gallium oxide catalysts are more resistant to deactivation after the dealumination of the support."
          [17] "The improvement of the catalyst stability with increasing Si/Al ratio can also be verified by measuring the coke deposited on the catalysts after on stream for 24 h."
          [18] "The steady state conversion of propane for the catalysts is in the order of > Ga2O3/HZSM-5  Ga2O3/HZSM-5(800)  Ga2O3/silicalite."
          [19] "The acidity of the supported gallium oxide catalysts was measured by NH3-TPD method and the results are summarized in Table 2."
          [20] "There is only one identifiable desorption peak at 264 oC in the NH3-TPD profile of HZSM-5, and the amount of desorbed NH3 is small."
          [21] "This can be attributed to the few framework Al existing in HZSM-5 zeolite because of the high Si/Al ratio."
          [22] "When gallium oxide is supported on HZSM-5, a second peak at 465 oC emerges in its NH3-TPD profile, indicating that some strong acid sites emerge on the catalyst."
          [23] "The acid amount of Ga2O3/HZSM-5 is more than triple of that of HZSM-5, suggesting that Ga2O3 on the support may be the cause for the strong acidity of the catalyst."
          [24] "Meanwhile, dealumination of HZSM-5 would weaken the acidity of the supported gallium oxide catalysts."
          [25] "As the steaming temperature rises, the acid strength and acid amount of the catalysts decrease markedly."
          [26] "Obviously, the decrease in acid amount does not result only from the loss of acid sites present on HZSM-5, since the amount of acid sites reduced is greater than that of total acid sites the HZSM-5 originally possesses."
          [27] "The previous studies show that strong interactions between Ga2O3 species and the support enhance the acidity of the supported gallium oxide catalysts [12, 15], so the extra decrease in acid amount may be connected with the weakening of the interaction between Ga2O3 species and the HZSM-5 support due to the dealumination of the zeolite."
          [28] "Catalyst deactivation in dehydrogenation reactions is mainly attributed to the coke deposition on the catalyst surface."
          [29] "Thus, inhibiting these side reactions through removing the excess acid sites present on the catalysts would improve the stability of the catalysts for propane dehydrogenation."
          [30] "This is probably the reason why the stability of supported Ga2O3 catalysts is significantly enhanced by reducing the amount of strong acid sites appropriately through steaming treatment of the HZSM-5 support."
          [31] "It could be concluded that the strong acid sites on supported gallium oxide catalysts play two opposite roles in propane dehydrogenation reaction."
          [32] "The positive role is to enhance the catalyst activity by providing alternative reaction path to the slow step, and the negative role is to accelerate the catalyst deactivation by catalyzing a series of side reactions."
          [33] "Therefore, the amount of strong acid sites present on the catalysts is critical for gaining an optimal result, and this goal is achieved in the case of Ga2O3/HZSM-5(700)."

          Zeolites, such as HZSM-5 with high Si/Al ratio, are promising support materials for CO2-ODHP catalysts due to their high catalytic activity and stability in dehydrogenation of propane to propene in the presence of CO2. Dealumination and weakening methods are used to modify the acidity of zeolites, which can contribute to optimizing catalytic performance by reducing the amount of strong acid sites that cause catalyst deactivation through side reactions like oligomerization and cracking. The key considerations in selecting and implementing these strategies for different types of zeolites used as supports include the intrinsic properties of the supports, their interactions with gallium oxide, and the balance between enhancing catalyst activity and preventing catalyst deactivation.

          沸石，如具有高硅铝比的HZSM-5，是CO2-ODHP催化剂有希望的支撑材料，因为它们在二氧化碳存在下将丙烷脱氢为丙烯时具有高催化活性和稳定性。脱铝和弱化方法用于修改沸石的酸性，这可以通过减少导致催化剂失活的强酸位点的数量，通过副反应如聚合和裂化，从而优化催化性能。在为不同类型的用作支撑的沸石选择和实施这些策略时，主要考虑因素包括支撑的内在性质，它们与氧化镓的相互作用，以及在增强催化剂活性和防止催化剂失活之间的平衡。
