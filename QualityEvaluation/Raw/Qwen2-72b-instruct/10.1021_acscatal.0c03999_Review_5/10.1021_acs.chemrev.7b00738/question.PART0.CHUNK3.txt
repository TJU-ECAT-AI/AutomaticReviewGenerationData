In the context of feedstock shifts in the chemical industry (e.g., shale gas) and a general revival in CH activation, (381) the field of methane oxidation with transition metal ion-exchanged zeolites has expanded rapidly in the last three years. Not only have breakthroughs been reported in terms of methanol extraction (382) or even reactivation with steam, (383) efforts have also been directed to turn the stepwise stoichiometric reaction into a catalytic one. (384) The latter report for instance details a gas-phase process for continuous methanol production, flowing a mixture of CH4, H2O, and O2 over Cu-ZSM-5 at 210 C, with good selectivity, and (a still very low) CH3OH production rate of 0.88 μmol·g cat1·h1. Note that a catalytic liquid phase methane oxidation process using Fe-ZSM-5 with H2O2 as oxidant has been known for a longer time, but so far, no small-pore zeolites have been reported for this case. (385) It was only in 2015 that the first small-pore zeolites (Table 9) exchanged with Cu were reported for gas-phase methane oxidation, as pioneered by the Lobo group. (25) Several reports have surfaced since, but still only a select number of topologies have been tested (Table 9). For a comparative series of medium- and large pore zeolites, the reader is referred to a recent critical assessment, (386) as well as an in-depth review in this journal. (99) Table 9.

3.3.2. Small-Pore Cu-Zeolites for Methane Oxidation
Wulfers et al. assessed AEI, AFX, and CHA versus MFI and SAPO-34 for methane oxidation following the three-step activation, reaction, extraction cycle. The three small pore, d6r-based zeolites performed similarly, and about 3040 μmol methanol per gram of catalyst was obtained, as compared to only 16 μmol·g cat1 for a ZSM-5. The small-pore zeolite results give methanol per Cu ratios between 0.03 (an aluminous CHA, not in Table 3) and 0.09 (AEI). It has been noted that the active sites of these copper-containing small-pore zeolites could be the same as those active for the decomposition of NO in SCR. (25) Park et al. confirmed the value for CHA, but higher Si/Al and Cu/Al ratios were used (Table 9). (387) Later, the Lobo group also found the system to work with N2O instead of O2. (388) Moving from a consecutive to a real catalytic system is clearly a necessity if this process is ever to be viable. Roman-Leshkov and co-workers broke ground in that respect, using O2 in flow conditions, and with several types of zeolites. The rates with Na-Cu-SSZ-13 attained 16 μmol·g1·h1. (384) Ipek et al. investigated expanding the N2O-activated cycle into a catalytic process for Cu-SSZ-13 as well, noting similar rates at 260 C (19 μmol·g1·h1), and up to 55 μmol·g1·h1 at 300 C (Table 9). (388) Ipek et al. also launched a full scale investigation into the nature of the Cu-sites in SSZ-13 and SSZ-39 and showed that trans-μ-1,2-peroxo dicopper(II), that is, [Cu2O2]2+, and mono-(μ-oxo) dicopper(II), that is, [Cu2O]2+, likely form on these Cu-zeolites (with Cu/Al = 0.40.48, Si/Al = 1012), as seen in Figure 33.

The thermodynamically optimized structures need at least one Cu-cation on the 8MR of SSZ-13 (Figure 33). Aluminous SSZ-13 zeolites have a higher percentage of bare Cu2+ on d6r 6MR windows, containing two Al-atoms (e.g., see Figure 16). These bare sites seem inactive for methanol formation, while Cu2+ ions on 8MR windows are believed to lead to CuxOy active species. (390) Studt and co-workers recently performed a DFT study, suggesting that monocopper species are also active sites for partial methane oxidation in 8MR zeolites. The suggested [CuIIOH]+ active site was said to provide an additional route for methane activation in zeolites in addition to the known multicopper sites. (391) Pappas et al. studied the Cu-SSZ-13 in great detail, uncovering structureactivity relations and allowing them to optimize methanol formation: up to 107 μmol·g cat1 was found using a long high temperature O2-activation (Table 9). After four cycles, 125 μmol·g1 was even obtained, related to the water-assisted movement of the metal during the extractions, to (more) active positions. Bare CuII species on 6MRs were indeed excluded as active sites, while [CuIIOH]+ species, also inactive, are identified as precursors to the methane converting site. A positive linear structureactivity correlation was found between activity and the reducibility of the Cu center. (389)
3.3.3. Conclusions on Small-Pore Zeolites for Methane Oxidation
While Cu- and Fe-zeolites have been known for quite some time to possess activity for methane oxidation after activation with O2 or N2O, the use of the first small-pore zeolites in these types of reactions was reported in 2015 and, thus far, only with Cu. Only a few topologies have been tested, and most of the focus has been placed on CHA, where the active sites have now been more clearly defined. There is a large opportunity for improvement in this area, especially when considering that the Si/Al ratios needed for this reaction are similar to the ones in SCR where hosting the same transition metals plays a crucial role. However, the active site requirements to the zeolite framework seem to be different (e.g., Al in d6r, 8MR, ...). Drawing parallels between the SCR literature, large-pore methane oxidation reports, and the identity of the active site (precursors) in SSZ-13 will undoubtedly lead to new insights and active small-pore zeolite catalysts for this reaction (and likely new types of active sites).
3.4. Olefin Generation: Methanol-to-Olefins (MTO) and Ethanol/Ethylene Conversion
3.4.1. History and General Chemistry of MTO
The MTO reaction is an industrially viable way to produce light olefins (C2C3C4) at temperatures around 350 C. Typically, MTO requires a solid acid catalyst such as a zeolite or a silicoaluminophosphate (zeotypes). The MTO reaction evolved from the methanol-to-gasoline process, as discovered in the 1970s by the Mobil researchers Chang and Silvestri. (392,393) Serendipity was involved, as the researchers were looking for routes to make highly branched alkanes from methanol and isobutane. The latter molecule did not convert, but methanol did and gave a mixture of aromatics and isoalkanes with C-numbers not larger than C11. (394) In the 1980s, the first plant was commissioned in New Zealand, to produce gasoline from natural gas, through intermediate methanol production. The selectivity to light olefins (MTO) was remarkably improved when UOP researchers discovered SAPO-34, the silicoaluminophosphate of the small-pore CHA topology. Nowadays, MTO, focused on making ethylene and propylene, offers an industrially viable alternative route to olefins from nonpetroleum sources, such as biomass, natural gas, and coal. The intermediate methanol is often produced via syngas through Cu/ZnO/Al2O3 catalyst technology. (395,396) A large number of industrial and academic research groups have contributed to the understanding and advancement of MTO over the years, and informative reviews on the subject are available. (93,102,394,397399) In recent years, several large scale commercial units have been built in China, mainly based on SAPO-34, (93) but also a ZSM-5-based (medium sized pore-zeolite MFI) operation is reported. (394) MTO can be considered in four consecutive steps. (400) First, the dehydration of methanol yields dimethyl ether (DME), methanol, and water in equilibrium. Second, an induction time is present, on fresh catalysts, and only few olefins are produced. Internally, intermediate species start to accumulate, and the first CC bond formation occurs. The third step involves high yield production of olefins, i.e., actual MTO, and a so-called hydrocarbon pool mechanism is dominant in most of the materials. The fourth step describes the deactivation by coking inside the zeolite.
In SAPO-34 a hydrocarbon pool of alkylbenzenes is present, and these intermediates dominate the pathway of olefin formation. (401) An active pool can consist of benzene and naphthalene aromatics that are substituted with methyl groups (mostly more than one). The organic pool together with the inorganic acid forms a hybrid reaction hub for adding C1 species (methanol, dimethyl ether, ...) that then transform, forming ethyl and propyl side groups that lead to olefin expulsion. Other mechanisms can also lead to olefin generation during the third phase, such as the methylation of olefins, with chain lengths increasing, followed by cracking of the longer olefins into ethylene and propylene. This route can be considered independent of the pool pathway and is often thought to be present to some extent as the minor reaction path. Dual-cycle mechanisms combining the methylation and hydrocarbon pool have also been proposed. (402)Figure 34 shows the dual-cycle, as it conveniently displays both major paths. (403) Figure 34 Figure 34. Dual-cycle mechanism in MTO. Reprinted with permission from ref (403). Copyright 2016 Elsevier.
A lot of mechanistic research has recently focused on elucidating the first CC bond formation, either on ZSM-5 or SAPO-34. (404406) MTO is a very interesting reaction to study since it involves a whole range of classic (as well as less common) hydrocarbon chemistries: isomerization, alkylation, hydrogen transfer, (407) cracking, (de)protonation, homologation and oligomerization, and cyclization and aromatization. The study of MTO has certainly helped to understand other vital hydrocarbon conversions. Overviews of MTO chemistry, often centered on SAPOs, are available. (93,394,408)
3.4.2. Overview and Specifics of Small-Pore Zeolite MTO
Aside from ZSM-5, most of the MTO research has focused on small-pore SAPO-34. Here, we limit our discussion to small-pore aluminosilicates, where the MTO literature is less abundant. SSZ-13 (CHA) was one of the first zeolites tested in this category, as patented by Santilli and Zones. (409,410) On average, compared to SAPOs, zeolites are more strongly acidic and have a higher hydrothermal stability. Katada et al. published a detailed comparison of the acidic properties of small-pore cage-based zeolites with different topologies in comparison to SAPOs (not in an MTO study, but still informative). (411) Bleken et al. studied the effect of acid strength for this reaction, comparing SAPO-34 and SSZ-13 (Si/Al = 11). (412) Keeping acid density and crystal size constant, and probing strength with CO-IR, a more active MTO chemistry (olefin production but also aromatics production and thus deactivation) was found for the aluminosilicate at the same temperature. Reaction paths and intermediates were similar, demonstrating topology matters more in this respect, although ethylene to propylene ratios were a bit higher for SSZ-13. Due to the higher activity, aluminosilicates can work at lower (optimal) temperature. Ethylene to propylene ratios usually also increase with temperature, and this is understood from the prevalent dual-cycle mechanism and the kinetic competition between (and activation barriers of) aromatic and olefinic cycles (C2/C3 olefin ratios are said to be also influenced by shape-selectivity originating from differences in diffusivity (102)). For MTO, the stronger acidity of aluminosilicates is thus not needed per se. The hydrothermal stability can be important for having longer catalysts lifetimes and an overall lower solid use per olefin generated. Given the industrial mode of MTO, often in fluidized bed with regeneration loops at low to intermediate coking levels, this could be important.
The MTO reaction on small-pore cage containing zeolites is a prime example of reaction intermediate confinement, as the cage traps the large hydrocarbon pools polymethylbenzene intermediates, allowing only the escape of C1C4 compounds (and a limited fraction of longer linear alkanes/alkenes) and mostly ethylene, propylene, and some butylenes (incl. butadiene). The ratio of ethylene:propylene:butylenes (aside from the mentioned condition dependence) can thus depend on topology-specific changes as well as on the size and shape of the cage that can allow different hydrocarbon pool species. Care should be taken, when interpreting topology-dependent selectivities, that the conditions used are comparable (i.e., particle size, T, methanol turnover level, coking level, conversion). 8MR zeolites without cages have also been assessed, generally without success. (413)Table 10 lists a comprehensive overview of (all) tested 8MR aluminosilicate zeolite frameworks for the MTO reaction. Typical catalytic data for each framework are supplemented both with relative grading and (dis)advantages. Note that Table 10 does not intend to credit first results reported for a given framework but aims to compile data with the most similar operating conditions.

Aside from the following comparison between small-pore zeolites and their structureactivity relations, work dedicated to understanding the mechanism of MTO in SSZ-13 (using one material with fixed properties) and other aluminosilicates has been reported. Such conditional (e.g., cofeeding, water addition, ...) and kinetic studies (414) are not detailed here.
3.4.3. Key StructureActivity Relations in Zeolite-Catalyzed MTO
3.4.3.1. Topology and the Presence of Cages
From the body of MTO literature, it is obvious that topology is the decisive factor for both activity (selectivity) and deactivation. Based on the information provided in Table 10 and comparing across different reports, it is clear that sufficiently sized-cages are needed when MTO is targeted in small-pore zeolites. Zero MTO activity was found for the 1D ESV and MTF zeolites (very small cage) in a recent study, and the main product in these dense materials is DME. Although MTF showed no olefins, a minor amount, possibly due to impurities, was detected in earlier work (both in Table 10). In comparison to small-pore SAPO zeotypes, (422,423) and large pore zeolites (ZSM-5: MFI, MEL, TON, BEA, ...), (424) relatively few studies have narrowed in on the role of cage dimensions in comparative studies for small-pore zeolites. Although parallels between SAPOs and zeolites with the same structure in terms of product distribution have been drawn (e.g., SSZ-13 above, or for AEI: SSZ-39 (179) and SAPO-18 (425)), direct zeolite-zeotype comparisons remain difficult.
The size and the shape of the cage, as well as their connectivity, are decisive in MTO as they:(i) determine the nature (size and reactivity) of the hydrocarbon pool species that can be included and, derived thereof, MTO activity and C2/C3/C4 olefin product distribution;(ii) are linked to acid site density (protons per cage);(iii) determine deactivation routes through the molecular sizes of accumulating carbonaceous deposits, a.k.a. coke. These originate from species in the pool that are not active toward olefin expulsion anymore (or from reactions at external surface areas).
It is clear that confinement effects and the number of acid sites confined within one cage are crucial in this complex chemistry. With a focus on cage dimensions, CHA, AFX, and LEV (SSZ-17) zeolites were compared by Bhawe et al. at similar Si/Al ratios (16) and crystal sizes. The selectivity toward ethylene increased with a decrease in cage size (LEV being the smallest and largest ethylene producer). AFX, with huge aft-cavity (Figure 7, 15.1 T/1000 Å3), showed the worst performance in terms of both activity (53% of conversion at WHSV = 1.3) and lifetime. Studying the organic species on partially and fully coked AFX samples showed that initially large organic species (phenanthrenes, anthracenes) form on the zeolite, while smaller species later occupy the remaining free cage volume. In contrast, for LEV and CHA zeolites (density of 15.9 and 15.1 T/1000 Å3, respectively) at partial coking, the size of the organics at maximum propylene selectivity correlated with the cages size (C2-benzenes for LEV, C3-C4-benzenes for CHA), while heavier carbonaceous species are only encountered later, at full coking. The average molecular weight of the hydrocarbon pool in this case continues to increase. For AFX, the average weight stayed more or less constant during deactivation. This suggests that materials with too large cages can deactivate faster and differently, based on the initial formation of large species right from the start, which could cause pore blockages. Recently, SFW was used for the first time in MTO, and compared to CHA and AFX because of their structural relation (see Figure 10, the SFW-cage is a c-axis expanded version of the AFX-cage). (419) SFW produced equal amounts of C2 and C3 olefins and little butylenes (Table 10), as did AFX in this study (33/33/8 for AFX with Si/Al = 14.7, similar to the tabulated value from another study). Product selectivity and deactivation for the elongated cages are very similar, as is the cage diameter and 8MR windows. Compared to CHA, larger cages more readily produce organics that lead to faster deactivation.Park et al. compared LTA (UZM-9, 14.2 T/1000 Å3), UFI (15.2 T/1000 Å3), and ERI (UZM-12, (16.2 T/1000 Å3) zeolites at 350 C (Table 10) vs SAPO-34. (420) UFI and LTA (lta-cage) showed propylene as main product, supplemented with both ethylene and medium amounts of butylenes, while ERI produced more or less 1/1 C2/C3 and a few C4 olefins. The ERI-zeolite tested by Kang et al. showed a somewhat higher ethylene/propylene ratio at peak olefin yield (50/23/5 for a Si/Al = 5.7). (419) These materials with high Al-content (Si/Al = 57) gave a fast deactivation by coking, as evidenced from anthracene and phenanthrene molecules (quickly) present in the LTA and UFI cage and alkylated naphthalenes in ERI. These large polycyclic aromatics are typical dead-end coke species for this reaction and lead to pore-filling and cage blocking and thus active site and catalyst deactivation. CHA, on the other hand, with a smaller cage (Figure 7), allows the formation of multialkylbenzenes (active hydrocarbon pool species) but suppresses the formation of polycyclic aromatics, at least initially. However, since the UFI, ERI, and LTA materials tested all had very high acid site densities, deactivation paths could be different for Al-deficient materials. Since Boal et al. recently discovered an easy route to high-silica LTA (14.2 T/1000 Å3) zeolites, the MTO performance of these materials was especially interesting. As seen in Table 10, a Si/Al = 42 LTA-zeolite (synthesis: Table 7, entry 11) showed low C2 + C3 olefin selectivities but a large fraction of butylenes and C5C6 molecules. Also, as a fast deactivation was noticed, it seems clear that the large lta-cavity of LTA favors the formation of higher-carbon number products and thus also likely easy deactivation by larger carbonaceous coking species (rather than being caused (only) by high Al-content in UZM-9). The selectivity toward butylenes was also clear in the SAPO version of LTA. (422)Table 10 suggests that zeolites UFI, KFI, and RHO, all containing the same lta-cage (although little differences exist, caused by the different connection mode), also show olefin distributions in favor of larger products, like LTA, although, comparing across different conditions and Si/Al ratios is difficult.An interesting case is the dense zeolite DDR with relatively small cages (17.9 T/1000 Å3), accessible only in 2D by ellipsoidal windows (3.6 Å × 4.4 Å). Compared to CHA (15.1 T/1000 Å3), for instance, this is a dense material, as CHA has 3.8 Å × 3.8 Å pores, accessing the cage in 3D. Olson et al. indeed noticed a much faster diffusion of propane and propylene in CHA than in DDR- zeolites. (110) Thus, apart from the size and shape of the cavity, the accessibility, determined by the dimensionality (1D-2D-3D) of the pore system and the shape of the 8MR windows, may matter as well. DDR produces virtually no saturated alkanes, as well as high amounts of C2 and C3 olefins (Table 10). (246,417) In light of costly separation of alkanes from alkenes (e.g., propane from propylene), this could be interesting. Gascon and co-workers studied DDR by looking at the two different methods of making this zeolite (Sigma-1 and ZSM-58). ZSM-58 produced up to 80% of olefins at 400 C (Table 10), while for Sigma-1, up to 90% of C2 + C3 olefins can be yielded at 450 C (not in table). As commonly encountered, the ethylene-to-propylene ratio depends on the temperature, e.g., for Sigma-1, going from 0.5 at 380 C to 1.6 at 475 C (Si/Al = 58). The ratio also partially depends on catalyst morphology and composition.A detailed study on the deactivation of zeolite using three different topologies, CHA, LEV (Nu-3), and DDR (Sigma-1), has been published by Goetze et al. (418) As seen in Figure 35, CHA coke species exist of methylated benzenes, methylated naphthalenes, and pyrene, while for DDR, 1-methylnaphthalene is mainly found, supplemented with diamantane after the 350 C reaction. This molecule resembles the OSDA used for Sigma-1 (1-adamantlyamine, see section 2.3.4) but was confirmed to not come from the remains of the synthesis. LEV coke species consist mainly of naphthalene (and methylbenzenes at low T), since larger species likely do not fit. An operando-UVvis study further tried to distinguish the different species between the induction, active, and deactivation periods and at different temperatures. For an in-depth study of deactivation in MTO, with a focus on active intermediate, the reader is referred to the review by Olsbye et al., where SSZ-13 is also covered. (426) Figure 35 Figure 35. Coke analysis via GC-MS of soluble species in dichloromethane after HF-mediated breakdown of the zeolite in left: CHA (SSZ-13, Si/Al 60); middle: DDR (Sigma-1, Si/Al 50); and right: LEV (Si/Al 30). Reproduced with permission from Goetze et al. (418) (ACS Author Choice open access).Dusselier et al. studied MTO with SSZ-39 (AEI) noting high C3 and C4 selectivities and about 85% of olefins at full conversion. (179) Schmidt et al. reported a new route to RTH, assessing MTO performance in the process, and documenting around 70% of C3 + C4 olefins (Table 10). (169) Given the fact that the cage of RTH (16.6 T atoms/1000 Å3) is somewhat smaller than that of AEI (15.1 T/1000 Å3), these selectivities are intriguing, as they are not straightforwardly explained by the large cage, large products observations over for instance LTA (14.2 T/1000 Å3). A more detailed study on the origin of this selectivity is due, although parallels to SAPO-18 (AEI) vs SAPO-34 suggest that indeed the shape of the cage is important, the AEI cage being more basket-shaped and wider at the bottom than the more symmetric CHA cavity. (425,427,428) SSZ-39 is a very interesting catalyst for MTO, but steaming was needed for optimal performance (section 3.4.3.2). No SAPO versions of RTH exist. Computational chemistry could be useful in this regard but so far has mainly focused on ZSM-5 and SAPO-34.Sastre computationally screened a series of relevant cages (all found in Table 10), for the methylation of hexamethylbenzene (HMB), as a model reaction for successive methylation of a hydrocarbon pool species (before olefin expulsion), and for reactions leading to the formation of coke. (429) In RTH, LEV, and AEI cavities it was found that it is impossible to host a linear OC(H3)···C(HMB) angle, required by the planar methyl group of methanol interacting with HMB (Figure 36). In other cavities, larger OCC angles (more linear) can be achieved, indicating this reaction to be more likely there. Whether this can be linked to active behavior or deactivation kinetics remains an open question.Figure 36 Figure 36. Cages of small-pore zeolites filled with the HMB-methylation transition state (green = C, red = O, white = H, purple = Si). For AEI, LEV, and RTH, the OCC angle is 150, 125, and 156, respectively, while larger values, closer to linear, are found for others.

Copyright 2016 Springer.Additional discussion on the impact of cavities (in light of the recent work of Kang et al.) taking in consideration other parameters such as Si/Al ratio, is found in section 3.4.4 (also featuring zeolite ITE, found in Table 10).
3.4.3.2. Si/Al Ratio and the Presence of Paired Al
It seems that the inherent selectivity in terms of C2/C3/C4 ratio of a cage-containing MTO-active zeolite, at a fixed temperature and assessed at maximum C3 + C2 olefins production, is not strongly dependent on the Si/Al ratio (for example: double entries in Table 10 for RHO, LEV, RTH at the same temperature, or for CHA in Figure 37 ). However, this does not mean transient behavior in olefin selectivities is absent, and often ethylene yields tend to rise during the time on stream. The Si/Al dependent behavior in MTO can be described for a couple of small-pore zeolites, where synthetic access to a diverse range of Si/Al ratios exists (cf. Table 3) or from dealumination studies based on steaming.
Figure 37 Figure 37. (A) MTO behavior for different Si/Al in SSZ-13; (B) paired Al site content (fraction of framework Al) and initial propane selectivity as a function of Si/Al ratio. Based on data and plots in ref (416). Copyright 2016 American Chemical Society. WHSV: 1.3 h1, 400 C.
Synthetic access has allowed for the investigation of the effects of Si/Al ratio with CHA (from 2.3 up to 67), (201) RTH (Si/Al = 17, 29, 59), (169) LTA (Si/Al = 12, 33, 38, and 42; although it is more difficult to draw conclusions here), (135) and DDR (Si/Al = 32, 55, 107, 198), (417) all made via the use of OSDA in hydroxide media, with the exception LTA (HF). Deimund et al. studied CHA thoroughly, concluding that lower Si/Al ratios lead to drastically shorter catalytic lifetimes (e.g., less than 2 h for Si/Al = 17 to more than 5 h for Si/Al = 55) as well as significant transient ethylene selectivity and high light alkane initial selectivities (see A in Figure 37). The higher Si/Al ratio materials resembled the output of SAPO-34. The lifetime effect was also noticed before by Tatsumi and co-workers, (201) but not the alkanes (perhaps also reaction condition related). The effects of the Si/Al (transient nature, alkane production initially) were ascribed to the paired Al site content, that is increasingly present as the Si/Al ratio drops. Cu2+ titration confirmed the paired Al-site content along a theoretical line for d6r only zeolites (section 2.3.3.5 and Figure 16) (430) and was plotted with the initial propane selectivity (B in Figure 37). In light of Al-site density per cage, a Si/Al ratio of 11 would translate to approximately 1 acid site per cage. Given that one cage consists of 36 T atoms, each shared over three cages in CHA, and that pairing, inducing alkanes, assumes at least 2 per cage locally, it is clear that the optimal acid site density for MTO is less than 1 per cage for CHA. In the RTH series, higher initial alkane production was also encountered for lower Si/Al materials.
Kumita et al. found an optimum MTO performance at Si/Al = 55 (400 C) for ZSM-58 of the DDR topology, more or less corresponding to 1 acid site per cage. Less aluminum resulted in prompt deactivation, while more aluminum did not help either. (417) However, Sigma-1, the other DDR zeolite made with a different organic (Figure 17), showed a reverse trend at 450 C. There, more methanol converted over the materials with the least amount of Al (Si/Al = 158 and 208 vs 60, for similar crystal sizes), and also the yield to ethylene increased, while propylene decreased. Interestingly, the C2/C3 olefin ratio changes from 0.7 to 1.3 for Si/Al ratios varying from 60 to 208, thus demonstrating a zeolite where acid site density influences olefin ratios. Also, for Sigma-1, the acid strength was varying with the Al content and, with that, the nature of some coke species. Truly exceptional in this series of DDR-zeolites is the very low Al-content (e.g., Si/Al = 158) that was able to still perform MTO. The differences between Sigma-1 and ZSM-58 are likely explained by the not-so constant particle sizes in the ZSM-58 series (section 3.4.3.3). What remains puzzling is why for the same Si/Al ratio, ZSM-58 converts up to 3× more methanol before deactivation than Sigma-1. (246) For some small-pore zeolite (Table 3), synthetic access to a wide range of Si/Al ratios is not possible. However, using organic-free methods of zeolite production, CHA, RHO, and KFI materials with low Si/Al ratios were subjected to steaming studies by Ji et al. (222,267) For CHA (OSDA-free: Si/Al = 2.4, Table 5, Entry 2) remarkable improvements were obtained. When steaming temperature and partial pressure are optimized and an additional acid washing step is incorporated, the time to deactivation at 400 C MTO for instance increased from 1.3 g of methanol per g of catalyst to 5.0 (for a sample steamed at 600 C and acid washed with a 0.1 M HCl solution). The same sample was able to produce 71% of olefins at full conversion at 450 C with a time to deactivation of 9 g·g1. The Si/Al ratio only considering the framework Al (MAS NMR) of this treated CHA increased to 12. For RHO and KFI, the steamed samples showed increased lifetimes and olefin selectivities, but the conversion over the materials was never prolonged beyond 2 h on stream. Interestingly, steaming also created some mesoporosity, also thought to contribute to the increase in lifetime, by allowing better access to the micropores. Phosphite treatment of the external surfaces, to block acid sites locally, was found not to influence the inherent C2/C3/C4 olefin ratios, but it prolonged the lifetime further of steamed RHO and KFI zeolites. Likely, acid sites in mesopores made by steaming can also serve as sites for coke deposition.
Remarkable steaming improvements were also noted for SSZ-39. (179) This zeolite is difficult to access in high Si/Al ratios from synthesis (section 2.3.1, most materials around Si/Al = 510). The Si/Al = 8.5 material (easily accessed) shows quite mediocre MTO performance, characterized by fast deactivation, transient olefin selectivities, and high initial alkane production (Figure 38, left). After steaming at 750 C, however, a superior MTO catalyst was obtained, showing extraordinary lifetime, few alkanes, and a stable, high olefin production (85%, Figure 38, right). Extra-framework Al in this case is still present inside the zeolite particles, but no lowering of the micropore volumes was found in N2-physisorption. The tetrahedral Si/AlT ratio based on combining the bulk value and tetrahedral Al-fraction from Al-MAS NMR was calculated to be 62 (or lower if the steaming temperature was lower). This result is consistent with the crucial role of acid site density in the cages. The steamed SSZ-39 catalyst converted over 11 g·g1, and the experiment was halted before full deactivation.

3.4.3.3. Crystal Size
Crystal sizes can vary a lot from synthesis, and as documented in section 2, numerous researchers have targeted smaller crystals in their protocols with the aim of improving mass transport issues and, perhaps, coking problems in catalytic applications.
Li et al. compared the nanosized CHA zeolites obtained by CTAB addition (section 2.3.3) and noticed a remarkable conversion capacity increase from 4.2 to 10.4 g·g1 when going from the standard, 1.52.5 μm crystals, to the 50200 nm nanocrystals (WHSV 0.8 h1, 350 C). (208) Interestingly, the C2/C3 ratio also increased for the nanosized samples. This was explained by the lower contribution of hydrogen transfer reactions, causing lower deactivation in the aromatic pool.
Yarulina et al., in their DDR study, also reported on the effect of crystal sizes for Sigma-1 (DDR) with Si/Al ratio of 158, i.e., 0.4, 2.4, and 4.6 μm. Again, smaller crystals were able to convert more methanol, up to 3.6 g of methanol per g of catalysts, more than medium (2.3 g·g1) or large-size crystals (1.6 g·g1). (246) The ethylene yield also dropped with increasing crystal sizes, while C3 and C4-olefins remained constant.
Finally, Martn et al. compared the small SSZ-39 crystals of about 4050 nm, obtained from IZC (section 2.3.1, Table 4), to a larger SSZ-39 catalyst of 0.20.4 μm; both with Si/Al around 8.5. (188) The latter value is similar to the one shown in Figure 38, while the particle sizes are clearly smaller: around 0.51 μm was used in the work of Dusselier et al., and these values were apparently unaffected by steaming. Methanol conversion dipped below 50% after 540 and 940 min on stream, for the large and nanocrystals, respectively (after a throughput of 7.2 g·g1 and 12.5 g·g1). Comparing throughputs with data in Figure 38 is difficult, as a different WHSV and temperature (0.8 h1 and 350 C) were used for the nano-SSZ-39 study (although selectivities were in good agreement). (179,188)
3.4.3.4. Other Parameters: Seeding and Defects, Mesopores and Hierarchy
Gascon and co-workers reported an interesting comparison between DDR zeolites, Sigma-1 and ZSM-58, made with and without seeding syntheses. (245) Seeding is known to speed up zeolite synthesis, either by speeding up nucleation or by coreshell growth around the seed crystals. Faster zeolite crystallization leads to framework imperfections, and this possibly affects MTO performance. Seeding ZSM-58 and Sigma-1 gave nanoparticles with average sizes of 100 nm in DLS, while direct hydrothermal synthesis yielded disks (1215 μm, Sigma-1) or spheres (0.51.6 μm, ZSM-58). The lifetime at 450 C was not linked to sizes in this case, in contrast to the discussion in the above section, and the larger crystals, made without seeds, often performed better. An SSZ-13 benchmark confirmed this. Characterization showed that the main difference between the seeded and the nonseeded zeolites was the large amount of defects, i.e., internal silanols and silanol nests, in seeded materials. It appears that one reason why seeded zeolites deactivate much faster is that the defects accelerate the formation of internal coke and that the positive effect on lifetime of particle size can thus be overridden in seeded small crystals. Finally, confirmation was found in an SSZ-13 zeolite with improved lifetime, after it was subjected to a postsynthetic defect-healing with NH4F, a method reported by Valtchev et al. (431) This defect-induced impact on MTO is a crucial observation, as too often seeded zeolite catalysts are used without benchmarking the effect of their defects.
A large subfield of zeolite catalysis involves material hierarchy, aiming at enhanced mass transport via mesoporous access to microporous active sites. (24,307,432) Olsbye and co-workers reported a desilication study of SSZ-13 with Si/Al = 14, with NaOH, for MTO. Mesopores were created at the expense of micropores. The methanol throughput significantly decreased for the mesoporous version and was said to originate from lower surface areas and acidity, while no evidence for larger coke species was found. Possibly, Lewis acidity, created in the mesoporous zeolite also catalyzed the aging of the hydrocarbon pool. (433) Interestingly, the dual-template SSZ-13 reported by Hensen et al. (section 2.3.3), with micropores similar to the classic SSZ-13 (0.21 cm3.g1) and containing about the same amount of mesopore volume, outperformed the nonmesoporous version in MTO: the lifetime, at WHSV of 0.8 h1 and 350 C, more than doubled. (218) This was said to come from a more efficient use of the micropore space, by an increase of the surface to volume ratio. These observations are in line with those of the Corma group regarding nanosized SSZ-13. A detailed follow-up study by the Hensen group showed that the increase of access needs to be balanced by an increase in the rate of coke formation. (219) The interesting bimodal microporous SSZ-13 derived from adding NaF in hydroxide media was tested in MTO and also gave a longer lifetime. The effect was more pronounced if the F/Si ratio in the synthesis was higher (0.1 vs 0.05 F:Si). (434) The spatial coke distribution was visualized and showed that throughout the entire spent crystal, aromatics were found, versus mainly at the outer rim for the classic SSZ-13. Access again improved performance here, clearly, although the effects of defects in the F-rich conditions (given for example healing with NH4F in the work of Yarulina et al. for DDR and CHA) should be investigated as well. The Hensen group further combined the mesoporogen approach with the bimodal micropores, and the trimodal material outperformed both other approaches. (221) Confocal microscopy of spent catalysts, in the middle of single crystals, shows the much higher degree of utilization of the crystal, when the bimodal micropores or, in addition to that, mesopores are present (Figure 39). The trimodal catalyst does not light up with exposure from the 488 nm laser (Figure 39c), which is indicative of polymethylated naphthalenes. Likely for this faster catalyst, these species have already converted into bulkier multiring aromatics. The additional porosity clearly enhances the utilization of the crystals, said to originate from faster transport of methanol. The total methanol conversion capacity for the trimodal SSZ-13 resides in the range of 1620 g·g1, versus only 6.8 g·g1 for the classic or 12.5 g·g1 for the bimodal microporous version. (221) Figure 39 Figure 39. Confocal fluorescence microscopy images of different modal porous crystals collected after the MTO reaction.

Selzer et al. investigated hierarchical DDR zeolites for MTO, made by desilication of a ZSM-58 material with Si/Al = 48 using NaOH in the presence of TEA. Higher product yields and longer lifetimes were noted for the mesopore-containing zeolites, which also featured lower Si/Al ratios. The benign effect of the mesopores was attributed to the increased acidity (although previous DDR work above found less Al to work better) and faster adsorption/desorption kinetics, the latter retarding coke formation. (435)
3.4.4. Overarching Analysis of Small-Pore Zeolite Cavities for MTO
Very recently, Kang et al. presented an interesting MTO study, arguably the most comprehensive set to date, comparing 11 framework topologies, as well as some interesting intergrowths (LEV/ERI: SSZ-105 and CHA/GME: SSZ-99) and an 8MR-zeolite with an unreported topology and an interesting, large cage (SSZ-27). (419) The testing of ITE (cage in Figure 5) and SSZ-27 (both having pentasil subunits as is also the case for DDR) shows that ITE produces double the amount of propylene versus ethylene (Table 10), while SSZ-27 deactivates quickly, likely due to its tortuous nature (not in IZA database so far).
This study visually confirms (Figure 40, left) and generalizes the correlation that the initial alkane productionhigher at low Si/Alnoticed for CHA (Figure 37 above) is present for numerous structures. It also appears that the longer a single cage dimension, the more propane is formed, and this is linked to faster deactivation. Implications from these results are that more symmetrical cages are better, as one longer dimension diminishes lifetime. Also, the number of frameworks tested at the same conditions allows for the identification of four classes of behavior in terms of olefins selectivity (Figure 40, right):(I) equal C2 and C3 olefins with low C4 olefins (CHA, AFX, SFW) (II) more C2 than C3 olefins with low C4 olefins (LEV, ERI) (III) less C2 than C3 olefins with C4 olefins equal to C2 olefins (AEI, RTH, DDR, ITE) (IV) equal C2, C3, and C4 olefins (LTA, RHO) Figure 40 Figure 40. Left: initial propane selectivity after <10 min on stream as a function of the tetrahedral Si/Al ratio as measured by energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy for a number of zeolites and intergrowths. Right: averaged product selectivities for conversions in the range of 98100% for of a range of zeolites compared to SAPO-34. Four classes IIV of behavior are indicated and explained in the text. Both plots reproduced with permission from Kang et al., ref (419) Copyright 2018 Wiley. Conditions of MTO reaction: 400 C, WHSV 1.3 h1, 10% methanol in inerts. SSZ-28 (DDR type); SSZ-98 (ERI-type), SSZ-99, 104, and 105 are intergrowths or with stacking faults.The fact that pentasil units are found in DDR versus only d6r units in AEI but that they, sort of, behave the same indicates that such structural features are not the dominant reason for high propylene selectivities. The IV class, with very large but symmetrical cages, compared to cages that are only large in one dimension (SFW and AFX) reveals that not only size but also shape is crucial. (419)
3.4.5. Conclusions of Small-Pore Cage-Based Zeolite-Catalyzed MTO
When designing small-pore, cage-based zeolites for MTO, the following should be considered:have large enough cages to allow hydrocarbon pool species to form (e.g., not MTF) do not have too large of a cage (even a single dimension of the cage) for fast coking or accumulation of dead hydrocarbon pool species (e.g., too large: AFX), and if large, it seems better to have a symmetric one. there are four types of behavior in terms of olefin selectivity observed thus far, for different cages have a high number of cages per nm3 of solid (low T-site density is an indicator here, although large cages also lower this) have a 3D channel structure for optimal diffusion of reactants and products have at most one active site per cage avoid low Si/Al ratios, as these element ratios favor high alkane production (Figure 40) minimize particle size and avoiding silanol defects Thus, a conceptualized, ideal cage would be one that just barely can host the right hydrocarbon pool species needed, but not the coke precursors or e.g. bicyclic aromatics. At this time, although trends are increasingly unraveled, it is not yet clear how to design a crystalline structure to purposefully control the light olefin selectivities to any of the desired products (cf. AEI vs RTH vs DDR). A unifying concept to link the nature of light olefin production to the structure is thus still at large.
3.4.6. Olefin Generation from Ethanol or Ethylene Conversions: ETO and ETP
In addition to MTO, the ethanol-to-olefins process (ETO) is also well-known. Ethylene can be formed via simple dehydration, e.g. shown with 8MR-zeolite ETL at 200 C, (77) but the mechanisms of olefin generation in ETO are more complex as higher olefins are also formed and multiple routes can be at work, e.g., identified in ZSM-5 by Galvita and co-workers. (436) Also, the often considered crucial first CC bonds formation present in MTO is absent with ETO. ETO could be interesting when considering biobased ethanol, if sustainably sourced availability arises. Another common reaction in this context is the ethanol to butadiene conversion, (437) requiring different chemistries, e.g., combining dehydrogenation and aldol condensation, often performed on nonporous oxides, or Lewis acidic large pore zeolites. (438) ETO has been investigated mainly with ZSM-5 and SAPO-34, (439) but also with zeolites SSZ-13 and MTF.
Tatsumi and co-workers studied the conversion of ethanol at 350 C on H-SSZ-13 and H-MTF. While the CHA-type material yielded 25% of ethylene, 40% of propylene as well as some alkanes, MTF only led to 90% of ethylene, likely due to the small cage, and some diethyl ether. (440) Itakura et al. assessed their SSZ-13 sample made via IZC using BTMA (Table 5, Figure 14), in ETO chemistry, at 400 C. At their conditions and full conversion, initial yields of 55, 35, and 3% of ethylene, propylene, and butylenes were obtained. (216) Itakura went on to study ETO on their materials in greater depth, and they found an interesting relation for the Si/Al of the SSZ-13 zeolites, showing a maximum of 47% of propylene for Si/Al = 15 (Figure 41). (224) This behavior is related to the oligomerization ability of ethylene on acid sites. (439) Figure 41 Figure 41. ETO at 400 C on H-SSZ-13 showing different propylene and ethylene yields in function of different Si/Al ratios obtained from IZC with BTMA. Reproduced with permission from ref (224).

Inoue et al. also tested their LEV-zeolite made by IZC with choline hydroxide (Table 6, Entry 13) in the conversion of ethanol to olefins, at 400 C, with 36% of ethylene and 35% of propylene obtained initially (resembling those values in Table 10 for MTO). When coke starts forming, the selectivity to ethylene goes to 100%. (284) Another reaction of interest, especially in the light of cheap ethylene from gas-fired steam crackers, e.g., in the US, (441) is the conversion of ethylene to propylene (ETP, see Figure 2). Tatsumi and co-workers assessed ethylene feedstocks in their MTF-CHA comparison and found that while MTF was largely inactive, CHA converted 68% of ethylene into mainly propylene, with a 34% yield, and with some propane. (440) When the coke content increased, the activity decreased, but the selectivity to C3 olefin increased. This is explained by the decreased hydrogen transfer reaction at high coking levels. Baba and co-workers reported a thorough study on the conversion of ethylene to propylene, (442) as well as the conversion of butylene, (443) with a focus on the effects of pore volume and topology. The study is a nice example of a dedicated effort to find topology-effects in catalysis. They suggested that in ETP, the propylene selectivity depends on the pore volume of the zeolite, rather than on classic pore size-sieving effects. (442) Excellent propylene selectivities from, for example ethylene and pentene cracking, can be obtained based on selecting the right pore volume, that can accommodate the volume of an olefin and/or its carbenium ion. Figure 42 shows data that demonstrate a clear maximum for 8MR zeolites tested (also includes SAPO-data) for Di values (diameter of the maximum included sphere) around 77.6 Å.

(444)) Di is proportional to pore volume. Adapted from Koyama et al., ref (442) with permission of the PCCP Owner Societies.
Interpretation aside (Di, cage size, sieving, hydrocarbon pool?, ...), the screening showed that CHA, DDR, ERI, and LEV (the usual suspects in MTO, viz. Table 10) attained propylene selectivities over 60% and clear superiority versus large-cage LTA, KFI, and RHO (although Si/Al values did not always allow fair comparison).
Finally, Hunger and co-workers investigated the mechanism of ETP in detail over SSZ-13, and they noted a longer lifetime after dealumination, caused by a reduced coke formation at lower acid density. (445) Also, the nanosized LEV zeolites by IZC, made with N,N-dimethylpiperidinium, were briefly assessed for the ethylene conversion at 400 C. The 35 nm crystals (Si/Al = 10) displayed a better lifetime than a zeolite with 220 nm sized crystals. ETP was also studied in the case of IZC-derived CHA zeolites. (446)
3.5. Methylamine Synthesis
3.5.1. Introduction to Zeolite-Catalyzed Methylamine Synthesis
Methylamines are crucial chemicals in many industrial processes. They are not only intermediates for amine-functionalized chemicals (pesticides, solvents, ...) but also have their own uses (water treatment). The Brnsted acid-catalyzed amination of methanol yields a thermodynamically controlled product profile, with trimethylamines (TrMA) being most abundant, followed by dimethylamine (DMA) and monomethylamine (MMA, structures, see Figure 2). For example, at the relevant 400 C and for a 1/1 MeOH/NH3 feed, 62% of TrMA is predicted, versus only 17 and 21% of MMA and DMA, respectively, at 99% MeOH conversion. From an application point-of-view, however, DMA and then MMA are the most important. (447) Typically, a gas-phase process contacts methanol and ammonia at elevated temperature over a dehydrating catalyst, mostly run in an adiabatic plug flow reactor containing a fixed catalyst bed. In order to avoid TrMA formation (favored), H-MOR zeolites have been applied commercially for a while. (448) The reader is referred to a thorough review in the field (dated, but the field does not expand during the last years), listing a large number of zeolites tested, and even individual data tables for small-pore RHO, CHA, KFI, and LTA. (447)
3.5.2. Small-Pore Zeolites for Methylamine Synthesis from Methanol and Ammonia
Generally, the acidic zeolite should hinder (the formation or) escape of TrMA (3.9 × 5.4 × 6.1 Å) from the pores, while still allowing DMA (3.9 × 4.7 × 6.0 Å) and MMA (3.7 × 3.9 × 4.4 Å) to form. (164) Hong et al. tested a range of different small-pore zeolites in identical conditions, i.e., H-form at 400 C. Similar and high conversions were attained for UFI, CHA, AFX, and RHO (Table 11), allowing fair comparison of the selectivities. For LEV, MTF, and DDR, however, lower conversions were found. The selectivity of UFI-zeolite is clearly the worst, and >60% of TrMA is formed, versus for example only 8% for the Rho benchmark. The results can be rationalized on pore size effects given the larger diameter of the 8MR in UFI (the reader is referred to the online database of the IZA). (3) Furthermore, the cage volume, and the dimensionality were also suggested to matter, as these could be at the origin of the suboptimal MTF, LEV, and DDR performance. CHA, AFX, and LEV were also compared in both zeolite and SAPO versions, to assess acid strength and densities. However, a Si/Al variation within one optimal zeolite has not been performed. Overall, AFX and RHO were found to be the most selective zeolites in that study, and the data in Table 11 show that higher selectivities, with the exception of KFI, are not encountered. KFI was studied thoroughly, by Shannon and co-workers, but found to be less active and stable than RHO. (449) Table 11.

3.6. Other Relevant Reactions
3.6.1. Cracking
Since the beginnings of shape-selectivity (Weisz) (452,453) all types of zeolites have been tested in reactions involving the cracking of hydrocarbons. In the early days, the focus was mainly placed on natural 8MR zeolites and LTA, since few synthetic small-pore materials existed. Aside from chabazite, (454) natural mineral erionite (ERI) was investigated. (455) Small-pore zeolites offer the advantage in cracking that the intracrystalline 8MR pores allow discriminating between paraffins (n-alkanes) and larger isoparrafins (branched), e.g., valid in hexane cracking, as the branched isomers do not easily enter (reactant type shape-selectivity). On top of that, Chen et al. noted the cage effect for the first time, when cracking n-alkane C22H46 over erionite and found odd product distributions. Remarkably absent were products with C1C2, C7C9 and >C12 carbon numbers indicating additional effects in addition to classic cracking mechanisms. The missing products undergo secondary cracking, while e.g., C10C12, fragments were said to be able to cross the cage of ERI (bridging across two 8MR windows), while diffusing along an 8MR pore. (104) C7C9 fragments were indeed found to have very low diffusivities in ERI, compared to longer or shorted alkanes and are trapped in the zeolite (cages), allowing further cracking to C3C4 products. (456) It is worth noting that Barrer had already in the 1950s studied the geometric factors involved in diffusion, by looking at the channels of small-pore natural mineral zeolites of the LEV, CHA, and ERI type. (457) A detailed cracking study by Weitkamp and co-workers focused on small-pore zeolites and n-octane (allowing β-scission) as the substrate. (243) LTA, CHA (chabazite), LEV (Nu-3), RHO (Rho), the two types of DDR, and KFI (ZK-5) were used in a fixed-bed setup. Haag-Dessau monomolecular cracking (C1C3 products, few branching) was found to be dominant and more prominent as the pores narrow. Bimolecular cracking products (branched) were also detected, such as isobutane and isobutene. Bimolecular hydrogen transfer is hindered in 8MR zeolites, leading to more olefins than paraffins, but no pure monomolecular cracking was observed. Selectivities to C1 and C2 products increased with decreasing pore-window size (e.g., RHO < LTA) and increasing spatial constraint (LEV, DDR). The selectivities of LEV, DDR, and RHO were over 30% for C12 products, versus only 1521% for CHA, KFI, and LTA with larger 8MR windows (than RHO).Aside from cracking with ERI-zeolites and the zeolite series mentioned above, the hydrocracking of n-decane has been reported on Nu-6 zeolite (NSI topology) with Si/Al = 45. It was shown to be an active and selective dewaxing catalyst yielding 76% of cracking products at 79% conversion. (49) Santilli and Zones reported on SSZ-16 (AFX) with Si/Al = 6 for the cracking of hexane and hexadecane in the light of studying shape-selectivity. (458) While hexane and hexadecane both cracked when fed separately, hexadecane ceased to convert in a 50/50 feedstock mixture. Due to the steric nature of this effect, caused by both the small pore and the presence of hexane, this behavior was denoted as an example of secondary shape-selectivity.Yun and Lobo reported propane cracking on H-SSZ-13, and they unearthed a structureactivity relation based on thermal treatment for Si/Al = 6 and 12 materials. (459) Without treatment, both propane cracking and dehydrogenation reaction rates were similar. Interestingly, after a mild thermal treatment (500 C), the zeolites started to crack more selectively (2×), while the high temperature treatment (550800 C) enhanced their dehydrogenation behavior. The authors hinted to the formation of another, new type of active site (not Brnsted) in SSZ-13 after the harsh treatment.
3.6.2. StructureActivity Relation of Al-Pairing in CHA for Dimethyl Ether Formation
The paired Al series (Figure 16 and the updated work by Gounder et al.) were used to elaborate an elegant synthesisstructureactivity relation for the Brnsted catalyzed dehydration of methanol to DME. It was seen that the rates were 1 order of magnitude smaller on isolated protons, versus those on acid sites in paired arrangements. Evidence was presented to state that such paired protons can access alternate reactions paths that are inaccessible to isolated acid sites. (237)
4. SummaryOpportunitiesOutlook
4.1. General Summary
(1) Cundy and Cox disagreed with the tendency that many researchers have to label the hydrothermal synthesis of zeolites as poorly understood or as a kind of alchemical mystery. (96) The synthesis of new frameworks in the 1960s, especially LTA in the 8MR group, sparked fundamental studies and revealed a lot about hydrothermal synthesis mechanisms when alkali are used in hydrothermally treated gels. Although some aspects of inorganic cation-directed zeolite synthesis in hydrothermal media remain unexplained, like the effect of concentration (water content) on phase competition and relative growth rates, a great deal of these crystallization pathways have been elucidated to some extent. However, the introduction of OSDAs complicates and expands the conceptual view of zeolite synthesis, as has the use of zeolites as source materials (interzeolite conversion) and the roles of seeding. A proof of this complication is found in the charge density mismatch approach, leading to new 8MR zeolite UFI with common TEA, TMA, and Na combinations. Also, the same OSDA can lead to (a range of) completely different zeolites (e.g., Figure 9: AEI vs GME). This is especially the case when the organics are on the smaller side relative to the intrazeolite pore space, and when the OSDA has numerous conformations in solution. OSDA-based syntheses in fluoride media without aluminum and alkali are simpler systems to rationalize how the OSDA leads to a particular topology. Smaller OSDAs and alkali can also stabilize smaller cages, composite building blocks, or tiles of the framework, besides residing in the main cage of the small-pore zeolite. What structural unit they stabilize at what time in the synthesis process depends on the conditions and inorganics used, and an overarching explanation for these interactions is missing. The most useful 8MR zeolites from a catalytic point of view feature larger cages with 8MR access. The larger cage is useful in structure prediction or when optimizing synthetic strategies, as they are the voids mostly filled with OSDA. In the case where OSDAs have a decent but not very tight fit with such cages, the Si/Al ratio of the product is hard to control. In that situation, it appears that cage-based, small-pore zeolites are driven toward an optimal Si/Al ratio, depending on the overall charge balance (e.g., 1 OSDA cation per cage) and the ease (or difficulty) of building in siloxy defects in the material (section 2.4).
(2) The last 15 years have seen remarkable progress in the synthesis of 8MR zeolites, and a few are highlighted: the pentamethylimidazolium route to RTH; the IZC route to CHA with TEA; the DM3(4MB) or supramolecular assembly route to LTA; the IZC routes to AEI and LEV; control over the Al-pairing in CHA via the Na/ADAM ratio or its particle size via growth-modifiers; the isoreticular series based on RHO; the synthesis of ERI and UFI through charge density mismatch; and last but not least the discoveries of the first 2D 8MR zeolite layer (RTH) and SFW, a zeolite with an 18-layer structure.
(3) The use of OSDAs in hydroxide media is the main route in the synthesis of 8MR zeolites, although for some zeolites, the use of HF is beneficial, e.g., when d4r need stabilization in high-silica composition. In some synthesis, NaF or NH4F is added to hydroxide-rich synthesis media with interesting results (e.g., IZC of FAU to LEV, Table 6; or the trimodal porous CHA). Interzeolite conversion (not the highly alkaline versions) and charge density mismatch approaches are two successful routes, also with OSDAs, to diversify synthesis routes toward existing frameworks (e.g., TEA for CHA), to attain new Si/Al ratios for a given framework (e.g., AEI) or even yield new zeolites (e.g., UFI by OSDA cooperation).
(4) Small-pore zeolites have been used in a range of fundamentally interesting or commercially relevant catalytic reactions. Cu-SSZ-13 catalysts are now the commercial standard in certain diesel-exhaust cleaning systems, and excellent selectivities, activity, and times-on-stream stability have been documented in methanol-to-olefins catalysis, e.g., with CHA, AEI, and DDR-zeolites. The higher stability of aluminosilicates versus SAPOs or other zeotypes may be beneficial in the light of longer catalysts lifetime, especially in repeated reaction/regeneration catalytic processes, as is the case in commercial MTO (now with SAPO). However, the cost of the aluminosilicate should be competitive. Specifically, for the case of MTO, zeolites seem able to compete in terms of performance, with SAPO-34 but the latter are made with cheap amines, instead of (often) quaternary ammonium OSDAs. The cost of a zeolite is largely determined by the cost of the organic and the synthesis time in a given reactor unit. Some of the OSDAs needed for 8MR zeolite synthesis are not currently available (e.g., the new benzyl-imidazolium for LTA), while others are commercially accessible at the large scale (TEA, TMA, choline) or in close alignment with industrial precursors (e.g., dimethylpiperidines for AEI). Useful benchmarks for OSDA-cost assessment are the commercial ADAM used in SSZ-13 synthesis for SCR, estimated to cost around 2030 USD·kg1 and TEA, at 35 USD·kg1.
(5) The progress in synthesis has led to a more widespread exploration of 8MR zeolites in heterogeneous catalyzed gas-phase processes. The new routes to AEI, RTH, LTA, and RHO, for example, now give synthetic access to a wider range of Si/Al ratios, allowing catalytic tests to be run with a more appropriate acid or active site density. An important example here is the new synthesis route to LTA using DM3(4MB), leading to the discovery of a very efficient SCR catalyst, that at certain conditions, is outperforming Cu-SSZ-13. Apart from improvements in controlling the Al-content, for selected zeolites, the fine-tuning of particle sizes, hierarchy, and even some control over the pairing or isolation of Al has been reported (CHA, Figure 16). This synthetic control over the zeolite properties has led to improvements in catalytic performance of certain 8MR-topologies.
(6) New reactivities for small-pore zeolites can still be found. The partial oxidation of methane to methanol on Cu centers in SSZ-39 and SSZ-13 was for instance first reported in 2015 (Table 9). The reaction is now mostly performed in a cycle involving methanol extraction and reactivation after every reaction, although catalytic processes have been documented, for the first time, in recent years. For this reaction, catalytic development will need to focus on increasing the productivities drastically while synthesis efforts could be directed toward increasing the numbers of active sites per gram of zeolite support.
4.2. Opportunities in Synthesis and Catalysis
In no particular order, some opportunities in the synthesis and catalysis with 8MR zeolites are as follows: For some 8MR frameworks with catalysis-relevant features, access to higher Si/Al ratios is lacking. Table 3 provides an extensive overview, although the Si/Al limits of AEI (max 25 (OH)), EAB (max. 3), ERI (max. 8), KFI (max. 4), and RHO (max. 8) come to mind. This challenge becomes even more formidable if one is to consider a cost-effective synthesis route.
In this contexte.g., KFI with less Al, or more cost-effective routesthe computational prediction of suitable OSDAs for a given lattice, as successfully demonstrated by Deem and co-workers for SFW, STW, and AEI, (137,138,185,333) should be further explored.
Given the new OSDA for high-silica LTA, i.e., DM3(4MB), and the proposed mechanism for LTA-synthesis starting with the construction of the large cage; the synthesis of KFI and RHO, with the same α-cage differently connected, could be explored with DM3(4MB) in conditions resembling that of RHO and KFI. A second OSDA to consider for LTA and KFI syntheses is the Cs+-18-crown-6-ether complex reported for RHO.
The forty-four existing 8MR zeolites (Table 1) are part of the 8MR molecular sieve family totaling seventy-six zeotypes. There are thus thirty-two small-pore frameworks that are, so far, unattainable in zeolite composition. Four of these are pure-silicates (Table 2), while the remaining ones usually are (metallo)aluminophosphates. Some of these structures could be highly unique catalysts when access to their zeolite counterpart is found. One such example is the SAV topology (MgAlPO4), (271) a 3D framework with large, unusual cages, that can be exclusively built from d6r units, and that is closely related to KFI.
The control of the pairing or isolation of Al sites in CHA could be expanded to other frameworks relevant in catalysis with an abundance in 6MR (LEV, AEI, KFI) and perhaps even 8MR zeolites with 5MR (RTH, DDR). Such control can undoubtedly lead to catalytic insights and new synthesis-structureactivity relationships.
The cage-count approach, detailed for AEI, CHA, and LEV, and discussed in section 2.4, should be applied to other cage-containing zeolites.
Tables 1 and 3 present more zeolite materials than those used in catalysis, i.e., Table 8, 9, 10 or 11. Given the structureactivity relations detailed above, some candidates could be worthy of investigation, e.g., EAB or PAU for SCR or MTO (provided they can be made with less aluminum or dealuminated) or RHO for the partial oxidation of methane. For the latter, the SCR overview can be useful, as the same metal precursor to the respective active sites is used. SFW and ETL, recent additions to the 8MR zeolite group, are also relatively unexplored in catalysis.
The search for alternative MTO catalysts is still ongoing, and significant advantages could be achieved for zeolites that would be more selective to a single olefin, i.e., specific to propylene or ethylene.
The performance of the steamed AEI in MTO is highly promising, especially when C4 olefins are valued more than ethylene. The recent improvements in synthetic access to AEI with larger Si/Al ratios (Table 3) would be helpful.
A detailed study of the effects of seeding on defect formation in zeolite synthesis is needed. The work on DDR showed that secondary growth from seeds can lead to materials rife with defects and deteriorated MTO performance. (245) Although seeding is used a lot as a synthetic tool to enhance nucleation/crystallization rates and phase selectivity, the consequences of their use on catalysis are rarely investigated in comparison to nonseeded materials.
Fe-containing small-pore zeolites could be more broadly assessed in SCR, and for the low-temperature partial oxidation of methane (with N2O activation).
Although not within the scope of this review, the recent development of siliceous 8MR zeolites containing Lewis acid framework atoms (e.g., Sn (460) and Ti (461) in CHA, Ti in LTA, (135) Zn in AEI (462)) is worth noting. In the context of catalysis (e.g., MTO or methylamine synthesis) such Lewis acidic sites could display unexpected selectivities. (18,463,464)
4.3. Outlook
Changes in global energy, carbon (feedstock) and environmental challenges (point-source pollution control) are demanding innovative solutions. Material science and catalytic technology have a large role to play in dealing with the key issues. For instance, feedstocks in the (petro)chemical industry are shifting to a more gaseous nature and with them, the required specifications of catalytic and porous materials. Small-pore zeolites have proven potential in the MTO reactions, as well as in engine pollution control based on NOx removal. The catalytic potential of cage-containing, small-pore 8MR aluminosilicates is obviously large and growing. Engineering small-pore zeolites to this end and tailoring them to applications is clearly an active component of modern catalytic technology.The recently increasing interest in using 8MR zeolites has sparked innovation in the synthesis of these types of materials (small pore zeolites have been ignored for several decades due to the emphasis on medium pore materials like ZSM-5), and a large number of new strategies have been reported recently. In years to come, control over the Al-substitution, both in content and exact location in the framework, will be a topic of research and debate. Structureactivity relations based on active site elucidation (e.g., Cu in SCR or partial methane oxidation) under working catalytic conditions (operando) will spark further interest in controlling the porous host and the location of its framework charge. The search for a 100% selective MTO catalyst based on the shape of the cage and its Al-distribution is another example. In SCR, the question of how structure leads to stability remains to be elucidated, and the role of the shape of the cage and the mechanisms of framework protection by active divalent cations are not completely understood. The relation between starting and product zeolite in IZC is puzzling, and the mechanism of these syntheses is clearly different from standard hydrothermal syntheses starting from amorphous reagents. The exploitation of IZC for different purposes, not only the synthesis of a given zeolite with Si/Al control, but also active-site control (e.g., Cu in situ) or metal encapsulation is in its early stages of development. Finally, computation has shown that likely, there are framework-dependent, preferred Al-contents and locations for proton-balanced zeolite (Si,Al) systems. In future work, such computation will include OSDAs and all other cations present, in order to simulate not only the energetic minima of the framework but also those of the OSDA-framework hybrid (the true product of a synthesis) and its Al-location. In reverse, computation will also play an increasingly larger role in synthesis, via the prediction of feasible OSDAs for a given lattice (e.g., the success with SFW). The charge density mismatch approach as well as the tuning of Al pairing in CHA clearly shows that the role of charged cations, i.e., their nature, quantity, density, and interactions with other charged species (both cations and anionic Al-incorporations), is crucial to the synthesis path followed and, therefore, the end-product, the kinetic construct that is a zeolite. It is expected that the role of the OSDA as a charge center, and not only a space-filler, will be better understood.
