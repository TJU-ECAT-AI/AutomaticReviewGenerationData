Chemical ReviewsVol 118/Issue 11Article Cite Share Jump to Expand REVIEWMay 10, 2018 Small-Pore Zeolites: Synthesis and Catalysis Michiel Dusselier* Mark E. Davis* Open PDF Abstract In the past decade or so, small-pore zeolites have received greater attention than large- and medium-pore molecular sieves that have historically dominated the literature. This is primarily due to the commercialization of two major catalytic processes, NOx exhaust removal and methanol conversion to light olefins, that take advantage of the properties of these materials with smaller apertures. Small-pore zeolites possess pores that are constructed of eight tetrahedral atoms (Si4+ and Al3+), each time linked by a shared oxygen These eight-member ring pores (8MR) provide small molecules access to the intracrystalline void space, e.g., to NOx during car exhaust cleaning (NOx removal) or to methanol en route to its conversion into light olefins, while restricting larger molecule entrance and departure that is critical to overall catalyst performance. In total, there are forty-four structurally different small-pore zeolites. Forty-one of these zeolites can be synthesized, and the first synthetic zeolite (KFI, 1948) was in fact a small-pore material. Although the field of 8MR zeolite chemistry has expanded in many directions, the progress in synthesis is framework-specific, leaving insights and generalizations difficult to realize. This review first focuses on the relevant synthesis details of all 8MR zeolites and provides some generalized findings and related insights. Next, catalytic applications where 8MR zeolites either have been commercialized or have dominated investigations are presented, with the aim of providing structureactivity relationships. The review ends with a summary that discusses (i) both synthetic and catalytic progress, (ii) a list of opportunities in the 8MR zeolite field, and (iii) a brief future outlook.

1. Introduction
1.1. General Introduction to Zeolite Catalysts
Zeolites are a group of crystalline, microporous materials that are constructed from regular networks of alumina and silica tetrahedra (TO4  oxygen atoms bridge the tetrahedral atoms). (1,2) These oxide networks, technically also known as tectoaluminosilicates, are often relatively open, through the presence of specific sub-2-nanometer pores and cages. Besides zeolites, that in the strict sense only have Si4+ and Al3+ in T atom positions, porous oxides with other elements that allow tetrahedral coordination, e.g., P5+, Ti4+, Ge4+, Ga3+, Co2+, or Zn2+, are known. The channels and voids allow for the intracrystalline transport, adsorption, and reaction of molecules and explain the use of the term molecular sieves for this broad class of inorganic materials. Currently, the diversity of existing crystalline molecular sieve topologies is documented in 235 frameworks. (3) While some of these topologies are represented by vastly diverse compositions in the type of T atoms involved and their molar ratios, others are only represented by a single material. The former is illustrated by CHA (each unique framework topology is given a three letter code (3)), a framework encountered in the zeolite mineral chabazite, but also in synthetic silicoaluminophoshate (SAPO-34), aluminosilicate (synthetic zeolite SSZ-13) (4,5) and more exotic versions (e.g., AlCoPO4 (6)). An example of the latter is EEI, so far, only found as a high-silica zeolite (Figure 1). (7,8) The focus in the present work is placed solely on zeolite compositions. There, the generation of a negative charge, when Al3+ is isomorphically substituted for Si4+ in the oxide framework, dictates the need for a balancing cation such as H+, Na+, or NH4+, or even divalent cations when two charges are in close proximity. This exchange capacity can be used to create catalytic sites inside the pores, leading to active site confinement. (9) Zeolites are commercially employed in catalysis, adsorption (separation), and ion-exchange applications. Most catalytic uses are found in hydrocarbon (petrochemistry, refining) and environmental technology, (10) while ion-exchange and sorption properties are respectively exploited in laundry detergent powders and adsorbents/desiccants. It is obvious that the size of the pores and the possible presence of additional cages or larger intersections influence the (organic) chemistry and catalytic applications that can result within. Typically, small-pore zeolites have pore sizes in the range of 0.300.45 nm, while medium-pore zeolite openings range from 0.450.60 nm and large pore materials have their largest pores in the range from 0.600.80 nm. (11) Although the first synthetic zeolite was a small-pore material (vide infra), the catalytic application of zeolites was initially heavily focused on large-pore zeolites. Since the discovery of the synthetic form of faujasite in the 1960s, the large-pore zeolite Y (FAU), with supercages, has been exploited in the fluid catalytic cracking of oil, a large scale catalytic operation producing gasoline. (12) Later the discovery of zeolite BEA and the introduction of MOR in catalytic processes fortified the role of large pore zeolites in petrochemistry, i.e., the catalytic upgrading of platform molecules from the refinery (e.g., transalkylation). With the advent of ferrierite (FER), MCM-22 (MWW), and ZSM-5 (MFI), medium-pore zeolites found commercial application as well, e.g., in olefin isomerization (FER), refinery dewaxing or xylene isomerization (MFI), and ethylbenzene synthesis (MWW). (10) Many of these classic hydrocarbon processes rely on shape-selective effects inside the specific voids. (13) In the 1990s, a push for extra-large pore materials resulted in the synthesis of zeolites UTD-1 (DON) (14) and CIT-5 (CFI), (15) with pore sizes close to 1 and 0.8 nm, respectively, as well as the generation of series of ordered mesoporous (alumino)silicates such as MCM-41. (16) The new millennium brought about the search for catalytic processes dealing with alternative feedstocks and environmental remediation. Alternatives to crude oil have since been studied, with the goal of finding more sustainable (if efficient) routes to chemicals and materials, notably, from lignocellulosic biomass or (natural) gas. Dealing with biopolymer feedstock and its rather large sugar constituents (17) has pushed zeolite development into mesopore-generation (e.g., hierarchical materials) as well as fueled the rise of Lewis acidic silicates such as Sn-BEA. (1822) Thus, far, new zeolite structures have not been targeted in biomass conversion, but rather the goal has been to adapt commercial zeolite catalysts to new processes. (9,23,24) On the other hand, the prospect of upgrading small-molecule feedstocks such as natural gas (CH4, (25) C2H6), syngas (CO/H2), (26) and CO2 (27) and thereof derived platform molecules such as methanol and ethylene did stimulate the use and synthesis of small-pore zeolites in recent years. Together with the fast progress in catalytic environmental remediation, i.e., the use of Cu-zeolites for the reduction of vehicle NOx emissions, these small-molecule conversions have triggered new synthetic strategies and allowed improved materials and even new zeolites to emerge.
1.2. 8MR Zeolites: Definitions and Scope of the Review
The 235 documented framework types thus present a diverse range of different pore and cavity systems with different potential uses. Considering only aluminosilicates (zeolites) and direct synthesis methods, rings of T atoms containing as few as 3 (MEI (28)) and as much as (excluding larger ones where T-atoms are not 4-connected) 14 members (CFI, SFH, SFN) (15,29,30) have been identified (the number of T atoms in the ring equals the number of oxygen atoms in the ring). In light of the above definitions and different catalytic scopes of small and large pore materials, the entrance to and exit from the intracrystalline void spaces have been defined. As such, 8-membered ring (8MR, referring to T atoms, in fact 16 atoms are in the ring) structures are considered small-pore zeolites, while materials with openings limited by 10- and 12-membered rings are defined as medium and large-pore zeolites, respectively. (31) Often, rings larger than 12 are denoted as extra-large pore materials. Medium, large, and extra-large pore materials can also contain smaller pores: LTL, e.g., has its 1-dimensional 12MR channels intersected by 8MR openings.
Even though some large-pore zeolites behave like small-pore 8MR systems through intergrowth faulting of the main pore (e.g., 12MR GME, (32) note that a fault-free version has just been reported (33)), this review will only focus on the synthesis and applications of pure 8MR zeolites (8 being the largest ring size) for reasons provided below. Besides the T atom definition of pores, the pore connectivity as well as the occurrence of larger cavities is of major importance for applications. For example, EEI has a very large cage (5.6 × 19.8 Å), that is only accessible through 8MR windows (Figure 1), as is the case for another 8MR zeolite, SFW. (8) 8MR zeolites without cages also exist: a commercially used example is GIS, seen in Figure 1. Table 1 lists the forty-four known 8MR zeolites. Additionally, the list contains four pure-silicate 8MR molecular sieves. When expanding this list to other T atoms (e.g., common PO4), a total of seventy-six 8MR microporous materials can be found. (3) Given the importance of the fit between molecules and pores, it is fairly obvious that 8MR zeolites will excel in applications dealing with smaller molecules and ions. (91) Perhaps it is no coincidence that the discovery of the molecular sieving effect itself was done with an 8MR zeolite, cfr. Weigel and Steinhoff in 1924. They discovered the rapid adsorption of water, methanol, formic acid, and ethanol vapors on natural chabazite (CHA), while acetone, ether, or benzene vapors were not adsorbed. (92) Today, over 90 years later, synthetic versions of CHA are produced at the kiloton-scale for use as methanol-to-olefins (SAPO-34, mainly in China) (93) or NOx reduction catalysts (Cu-SSZ-13). (94,95) Even though 8MR zeolites have been known for quite some time, it is only recently that the two significant commercial catalyst uses mentioned have occurred. These technologies have stimulated recent research into 8MR zeolites and molecular sieves. Given these events, the objective of this review is to provide a critical and comprehensive overview of the chemistry, synthesis, and catalytic applications of 8MR zeolites (strictly only aluminosilicates) from the early days (1940s) to the present. A classic historic and general account of hydrothermal zeolite synthesis (up to 2003) was presented by Cox and Cundy. (96) Other comprehensive reviews in the field focus on one particular aspect of zeolite chemistry, such as more sustainable synthesis routes, (97) new frameworks since 2007 (focused on structural information), (98) catalytic applications for a specific group of substrates such as biomass, (24) CH activation, (99) or nitrogen containing exhaust gases. (100,101) At this time, there is a brief overview on synthesis strategies for small pore molecular sieves by Moliner et al. (31) Thus, our goal in the present review is to provide in-depth discussions on both the synthesis and catalytic applications of 8MR zeolites in order to highlight structureproperty relationships for this increasingly important class of materials.

1.3. Introduction to the Use of 8MR Zeolites as Catalysts
From the early days of applied zeolite science, 8MR zeolites have been investigated for sorption and separation applications. (92) However, 8MR materials largely have been neglected as catalysts until recently (large and medium pore materials dominate in petrochemical applications). Since the discovery of the excellent olefin selectivities and yields using certain acidic 8MR molecular sieves during methanol conversion in the 1980s (102) and the remarkable stability and activity during redox reactions of transition metal-exchanged 8MR zeolites for NOx reduction in the 2000s, these zeolites have been extensively explored for catalytic conversions of small, often gaseous, molecules. Lately, there has been an increase in interest due to changes in cost/availability of gaseous feedstocks and emission legislation. (103) An overview of prominent reactions where 8MR zeolites have been used is found in Figure 2.
Commercial applications (current and previous) of 8MR zeolites include materials that have the following topologies: CHA, EDI, ERI, GIS, LTA, MER, and RHO. (10) Most of these materials are used for separations and sorption, while ERI, CHA, and RHO also are exploited in catalytic applications. ERI was used as a hydrocracking catalyst in refineries, before its replacement by ZSM-5 (a 10MR-zeolite of the MFI topology). Specifically, ERI was used in the Selectoforming process, aimed at increasing the octane number of light naphtha by the shape-selective cracking of short linear alkanes while preserving the branched ones (section 3.6.1). (104) Besides MTO, the reaction that is industrialized with SAPO-34 (CHA), the selective catalytic reduction (SCR) of NOx with Cu-SSZ-13 is now being exploited worldwide. The catalytic synthesis of methylamines (at one point, commercial based on large pore-zeolite MOR) has been performed with 8MR zeolite Rho (RHO) at the pilot stage. RHO was useful in order to exploit shape-selectivity and avoid the formation of trimethylamine, but it never reached the commercial stage. Two reactions related to MTO are the ethanol dehydration and the ethylene oligomerization-cracking processes (Figure 2). The former is not to be mistaken for the MTO-analogous ethanol-to-olefins route, as it can be performed through somewhat different reaction routes and conditions, as CC coupling is not per se needed (unless propylene is formed). Lastly, there is the partial oxidation of methane-to-methanol, with the use of O2 (or N2O) as oxidant. This reaction, discovered on Cu-exchanged ZSM-5 (105,106) and later observed from other larger-pore materials, (107) has recently also been reported with Cu-exchanged 8MR zeolites by Lobo and co-workers. (25) The similar nature of these catalysts with those used in SCR research warrants discussion that is provided below.
Although the CHA-materials dominate the industrial catalytic applications, numerous other 8MR materials have been explored for SCR, MTO, and methylamine synthesis, and sometimes, they yield better results with respect to the industrial standards. Here, after we thoroughly discuss the synthetic details of 8MR zeolites in the next section, this review will focus on selected catalytic data in order to demonstrate structure/activity relations of 8MR zeolites (section 3). Other applications, summarized below (provided for completeness), will not be discussed in detail.
While we limit our presentations to catalytic applications of 8MR zeolites, we mention the largest commercial applications of 8MR zeolites (volumetric scale) to inform readers that catalysis remains a growth area for these types of zeolites. The largest commercial applications for 8MR zeolites are still found in ion-exchange and sorption/separation. The use of zeolites P and A (GIS and LTA, respectively) in detergent-builders, e.g., to remove Ca2+ ions from aqueous solutions, is well-known. Other common detergent-builders are the large pore materials zeolite X and Y. (108) Also, 8MR zeolites (LTA) are often used as dessicants. Furthermore, in gas sorption and separation, 8MR zeolites are of major importance, due to their ability to discern between short chain alkanes and olefins, (109) different light hydrocarbons, (110,111) CO2/CH4, (112) H2/N2, and CO2/N2. (113) Often zeolite membranes are constructed in this context (LTA). (114116) Aside from these common applications, small-pore zeolites have been explored in all kinds of specialty devices and materials. (117) Thin films of pure-silica CHA have been assessed in low-dielectric constant applications, (118) while aluminous LTA has been applied in films for humidity sensors (119) and Ag-LTA in photoluminescent materials. (120)
2. Synthesis of 8MR Zeolites
2.1. Introduction to Different Strategies for Making 8MR Zeolites
Of the forty-four 8MR zeolites listed in Table 1, three are found as natural minerals only and no route for their synthesis exists to date (these lack an entry in the reference column in Table 1). For the remaining forty-one zeolites, a dedicated synthesis route, usually leading to a pure-phase product, exists. When analyzing the different routes to these 8MR aluminosilicates, a set of distinct synthetic approaches can be identified (Table 2). These methods will be explained one by one, from A to G, in the following paragraphs. Then, in section 2.2, an overview of all synthetic 8MR zeolites is presented, with an indication of which methods have been reported for each framework. Specific examples and mechanistic insights of the use of these methods (other than those in the next paragraph) are found throughout section 2.3, where all synthetic progress of the relevant 8MR zeolites is detailed per topology.
Figure 2 Figure 2. Reported important reactions with 8MR zeolites. Methanol to olefins and NOx reduction (solid lines) are commercially applied, at this time, using 8MR materials. The dashed boxes have only been investigated at small or pilot plant scale (amines) or have been shut down (Selectoforming). MMA, DMA, and TrMA, respectively, are mono-, di-, and trimethylamine. Methane oxidation can also use N2O as an oxidant.

RTH, not known from unseeded hydroxide media OSDA-free synthesis, is the exception to this. (121) (This contrasts with a lot of high-silica, large-pore zeolites (BEA, MFI), whose syntheses without OSDA were reported long after their discovery through the use of OSDAs.) cAlways with inorganic cations and/or OSDAs. dAlways with OSDAs.
The first forays into zeolite synthesis were conducted by geothermal mimicking (Method A, Table 2), in an attempt to simulate the mineralization process found in the Earths crust. This is mostly done by bringing mixtures of alkali, silica, and alumina (often glasses), with compositions close to that of the natural zeolites, to high pressures and temperatures. The pioneer of (classic) zeolite synthesis was Richard M. Barrer, who meticulously explored crystallization fields with different alkali cations and Si/Al ratios. (122) Soon, new zeolite recipes began emerging from his school in the 194050s and from research at Union Carbide (Linde type materials). Early on, several attempts were made to obtain synthetic chabazite, but the first synthetic 8MR zeolite prepared was likely analcite (ANA), a dense zeolite with little use for molecular sieving, dating back to 1882. (123,124) In 1948, while looking for synthetic chabazite, Barrer discovered the first synthetic zeolite with no natural counterpart, and he documented its chabazite-like behavior. (125) The zeolite later turned out to be an 8MR material with the KFI topology (126) and thus analogous to the ZK-5 zeolite (in the meantime reported) and its structure (Mobil). (88,127) Another 8MR milestone came in 1956, when R. M. Milton (later joined by Breck and co-workers) at Union Carbide demonstrated the synthesis of LTA (also not found in nature), with excellent ion-exchange properties. (128130) To this day, the production of this so-called zeolite A is one of the largest scale manufacturing processes of all synthetic zeolites, mainly due to its use as a detergent-builder. Several 8MR zeolites were discovered by these pioneers and others in their wake, by using different alkali as structure-directing agents in hydroxide media (Method B, Table 2): lithium-ABW (1951), potassium-EDI (KF, 1956), rubidium-ATT (RMA-3, 2005), cesium-BIK (at Mobil, 1989), sodium-cesium-RHO (Rho, 1973), etc.
In 1961, Barrer introduced a new method to prepare zeolites by adding charged organic ammonium and alkylammonium species in the gels. (131,96) This breakthrough effectively pioneered the use of organic structure directing agents (OSDAs) in zeolite synthesis (Method C, Table 2). LTA, for instance, was soon thereafter made in the presence of tetramethylammonium (TMA). (132) The use of organic cations, typically bulkier per charge than classic alkali cations, revolutionized the synthesis field. Important was the realization that the larger organic cations required less aluminum to be built-in in the zeolite framework (countercharge), thus opening up the possibility of high-silica materials. Initially, only larger pore materials were discovered using OSDAs, such as the 10MR MFI and the 12MR-zeolites MWW and BEA. The first OSDA-directed 8MR zeolite was EAB (1970), containing a medium-large cage, made by using a combination of TMA and sodium cations. (60) An excellent example of this strategy (Method C, Table 2) for 8MR zeolites is the synthesis of CHA-type zeolites that can now be prepared over a very wide range of Si/Al ratios by using the large N,N,N-trimethyl-1-adamantyl-ammonium cation (ADAM) as OSDA. (4) This method, invented by Zones and based upon stabilization of the large CHA cage by the organic, is industrially used to make the 8MR zeolite (SSZ-13) for exhaust cleaning. (133) Up to today, the use of new and complex OSDAs continues to lead to new zeolites (134) or new recipes for known zeolites, the latter often with access to higher Si/Al ratios. (135,136) By means of illustration, the two OSDAs that can be used to prepare the EEI zeolite (Figure 1) are illustrated in Figure 3, along with the organic initially reported for SFW, an interesting zeolite related to CHA, with a very large cage. The most recent example of Method C (OSDA/hydroxide media) is the synthesis of EU-12 by using choline (N,N,N-trimethylethanolammonium), Rb+, and Na+ (8MR-zeolite ETL, 2016). (77) Figure 3 Figure 3. OSDAs for making EEI (Figure 1) or SFW (Figure 10) zeolites in hydroxide media. The charged quaternary nitrogen atoms are marked in red. For SFW, more practical organics have been found recently, through computational OSDA design. The work of Deem et al. is a good example of this strategy. (137,138) Barrer also introduced the use of a zeolite as sole source for making another zeolite, by studying the hydrothermal transformations of analcime in the presence of metal salts (yielding KFI with barium halides for instance). (139) Dwyer and Chu presented the transformation of FAU, still in its growth medium and considered metastable, into a MAZ-zeolite (ZSM-4, or Omega) in the presence of TMA at 100 C. Normally, the more dense zeolite P (GIS) is expected in the absence of TMA. Also, the MAZ zeolite appeared to nucleate on the surface of the dissolving FAU-crystal. (140,141) Later, Zones reported an interesting series of experiments that involved the transformation of zeolite P (GIS) and Y (FAU) into a range of high-silica 8MR zeolites (LEV, CHA, AFX) by the addition of organocations, e.g., ADAM, and by starting from actual dry zeolites. (142144) Davis and co-workers later used (diluted) alkaline earths and successfully synthesized CIT-4 (48) (synthetic BRE, use of seeds) and epistilbite (EPI) from zeolites P1 (GIS) and L (LTL). (68) Due to peculiar differences between this method of interzeolite conversion (IZC) and classic hydroxide media reactions that use separate (and different) silica and alumina sources, we consider this a distinct method (Table 2, Method D). The Sano group reported a number of interesting IZC-based studies that yielded relevant 8MR zeolites such as AEI, CHA, and LEV, often from FAU precursors (see section 2.3, with the respective frameworks). (145,146) The observations that IZC often gives faster syntheses than identical recipes with traditional inorganic sources and that, sometimes, only IZC leads to a particular zeolite, e.g., AEI, have led to the idea that structural similarities (composite building units, cages, specific membered rings or other less-defined structures, e.g., ladders; collectively sometimes referred to as nanoparts) between starting and product zeolites play, under the right conditions, a decisive role in the nucleation/growth of the new material (exemplified in Figure 4 for FAU to CHA). (145,146) This is similarly asserted in seeded-synthesis. (147) Figure 4 Figure 4. Cartoon illustrating the hypothesis that nanoparts are involved in the FAU-to-CHA IZC. Adapted from ref (145).
A new, creative approach to zeolite synthesis emerged from researchers at UOP in the 2000s, when Lewis et al. introduced the concept of charge density mismatch (CDM, Method E, Table 2). (148) This approach (technically a variation on method C) is based on the creation of an initial mixture that is not able to crystallize because of a mismatch between the low charge density of the used OSDA and the high charge density of the potential aluminosilicate network (at low hydroxide content, often only sourced from the OSDA). Often, the inorganic-cation free, mismatched mixture is a solution, rather than a gel in the case of alkali cations. Then, a second, crystallization-inducing, high charge density OSDA (often TMA or alkali cations) is added, but only in minute amounts. This OSDA cannot effectively dominate structure formation nor balance all Al present but triggers condensation. This forces the SDAs to work together. The classic example is the synthesis of 8MR UZM-5 (UFI, 2003) using tetraethylammonium (TEA) initially and TMA and Na+ in a later stage. (73,148) A game-changer in molecular sieve synthesis was the introduction of fluoride ions as mineralizing agent, traced back to Flanigen and Patton in 1978. (149) Typically, the more neutral synthesis media, often based on equimolar HF to OSDA(OH) addition, in the absence of alkali, prove successful to make less dense, high-silica zeolites and pure-silicates (Method F, Table 2, Caution: HF is extremely corrosive). For several known 8MR zeolites, fluoride routes have been successfully explored as alternatives to hydroxide protocols: some with minor adaptations (e.g., CHA), some with largely different OSDAs (LEV). (122) A few new 8MR zeolites, discovered and exclusively found in fluoride media, are ITQ-32 (78) (IHW) and SSZ-73 (65) (SAS). Their OSDAs and structures are seen in Figure 5. IHW is somewhat of a special case, as it has 12-ring connections between the [100] channels, but there are no 12-ring channels, classifying it as an 8MR zeolite. A final example is zeolite ITE, originally discovered in pure-silica form, in low water fluoride media, but Al was also said to incorporate. (150) Later, Valtchev et al. found a procedure to prepare Al-rich ITE in classic hydroxide gels, and their OSDA is remarkably different (Figure 5). (80,81) Figure 5 Figure 5. OSDAs used for SAS, IHW, or ITE (ITQ-3) zeolites in fluoride media. Mu-14 OSDA is shown for comparison, but not used in F-media. For IHW, the double-charged OSDA promotes a large Al incorporation and yields ITQ-32 with Si/Al ratios between 13 and 32, while the piperazine-derived OSDA (upper) leads to a higher Si/Al (>300) material. (78) It has been discovered that 2D-layered precursors could transform into 3D-frameworks upon high-temperature treatment (calcination) by the condensation of silanol groups in the layers that release water (topotactic condensation, Method G, Table 2). Marler and co-workers performed pioneering efforts in this synthetic area. Among the first zeolites prepared this way was FER, from the PREFER layer. (151) Certain zeolites can (so far) only be made through the topotactic mechanism. The classic 8MR example is the synthesis of the CDO framework from the PLS-1 or RUB-36 or UZM-13 layers. In the case of CDO, the layers also have a FER structure, but they are arranged in a different way due to the organic. (152) These layers are synthesized hydrothermally and thus come stacked with organic moieties. PLS-1 is, for instance, made with TMA and K+ cations in a silica, (153) water, and dioxane mixture, while RUB-36 and UZM-13 are made with diethyldimethylammonium cations. (52,154) The latter two layers have been reported with Al incorporated, thus leading to zeolite versions of the CDO topology. (155) Aluminosilicate CDO is also found in the isostructural MCM-65 zeolite. (53,156,157) The topotactic conversion of RUB-36 to a silicate version of CDO is shown in Figure 6. A recent trend in material design is to take the layered precursors and pillar them with additional reagents, such as e.g. dimethyldichlorosilane, to obtain interlayer expanded materials. The connecting atoms are (mostly) not 4-fold coordinated in the framework (not strictly zeolites), but it can be an interesting route to introduce heteroatoms in the material for certain applications. (158) In the context of creating 8MR, the expansion concept is less useful, as the condensation of the classic layers (without expansion) usually creates at least an 8MR.

Now that a concise overview of the generalized strategies for 8MR syntheses has been presented, we elaborate further on details for specific 8MR zeolites. Reviews on more generalized mechanisms of zeolite synthesis, applicable for all types of zeolites, can be found elsewhere and are focused on more classic zeolite synthesis (OH, OSDA, alkali, F), e.g., see Cundy and Cox.

2.2. Overview of Si/Al Ratios and Methods per Framework
Table 1 lists all 8MR zeolites, while section 2.1 (Table 2) identifies a set of distinct routes for their synthesis. Table 3 shows which methods have been reported for each 8MR aluminosilicate. Additionally, the reported ranges of Si/Al ratios that can be obtained by direct synthesis are shown (tentative). The Si/Al range is often method-specific: for example, when a zeolite can be made in both OH and F media, Si/Al ranges of materials made in the latter are often higher.

2.3. Synthesis Details of 11 Significant Frameworks
Based on the openness of topologies (2D-3D, cages), the amount of synthesis and application studies reported, and their (potential) catalytic relevance, we have selected the 11 most important 8MR zeolite frameworks and have detailed the progress on their synthesis. The aim is to (i) highlight interesting synthetic strategies or unique features of the synthetic approaches by concrete examples and (ii) develop links between topologies. These 11 topologies are highlighted in Table 3. Unsurprisingly, these are the ones where multiple methods of synthesis have been explored. Second, ten of these topologies have large cages, explaining their usefulness in catalysis and sorption (Figure 7). This review has no intention to draw or explain the structure of every topology in detail, and it refers the reader to the IZA (3) and Zeomics resources. (176) However, some structural features and important building units will be shown when useful to the discussion of the synthetic method. Zeolite P (GIS) is the only framework in the selected series without large voids, but this zeolite is often used in ion-exchange to soften water.

2.3.1. AEI
2.3.1.1. Structure and Implications
The AEI topology, as many others, was first encountered in aluminophosphate (AlPO-18) and SAPO-type compositions. (177) The framework can be described entirely of d6r-building blocks (d6r = double 6MR = hexagonal prism) without the need for any other composite building unit. Herein, we refer to such topologies as part of the d6r-only family. In AEI, these building units are linked by 4MRs, to form chains and eventually planes, with the d6r units all aligned in the same way (Figure 8). These planes are stacked along the c-axis, each with a 180 rotation, and this leads to the asymmetric, pear-like cage with a sort of side-pocket (Figure 7). The cage has also been described as basket-shaped, although that expression fits the cage of 8MR zeolite ESV better. (71) If the planes in Figure 8 are not rotated, but just stacked, the CHA-structure is obtained (vide infra).
Figure 8 Figure 8. Building the AEI framework from linking d6r in chains to form planes, and stacking those planes.
Zones et al. discovered a recipe yielding the aluminosilicate version of AEI and named it SSZ-39. (36) Wagner et al. noted that the zeolite formed with a range of organics (examples in Table 4) in mixtures with a medium Si/Al ratio (15) and a lot of hydroxide; the latter needed to solubilize the aluminum. (36,178) They noted that in these cases, the inorganic gel composition can dominate over the organic/inorganic interactions and lead to cage-containing zeolites with even-membered ring constructions and small portals (e.g., AEI, AFX, CHA, SFW, ... vide infra). The even-membered rings (8MR, 6MR, 4MR) are hypothesized to form more readily at high Al-substitution (than 5MR), because the strict alteration of Si and Al (Lwensteins rule) can more easily avoid the unfavorable Coulombic interactions when two negatively charged alumina tetrahedra are close to each other (i.e., in the extreme case, Si/Al = 1 can be obtained in a 6MR but never in a 5MR).

2.3.1.2. AEI Zeolite Synthesis
Since this zeolite has proven merits in catalysis, (179,181) a detailed discussion of its synthesis is warranted. Table 4 presents an overview of most of the reported AEI syntheses.
The original patent on SSZ-39 claims a set of different organics. Ten of these are effectively based on piperidine, with different, often methyl, substitutions on the ring and with the nitrogen quaternized by methyl or ethyl groups. The foremost examples are N,N-diethyl-2,6-dimethyl-, N,N-dimethyl-3,5-dimethyl-, and N,N-dimethyl-2,6-dimethylpiperidinium (Table 4, entries 1, 4, and 9). Typically, these OSDAs, e.g., DEDMP in entry 1, lead to SSZ-39 with a Si/Al ratio around 7.5, in synthesis mixtures with Si/Al ratios of 15, with the help of a FAU zeolite as aluminum (and partial Si) source. Evidently, the different Si/Al ratios in the product and synthesis mixture reveal a low yield, as part of the silica remains unused. Another patented OSDA was based on an azoniabicyclononane (Table 4, Entry 2), and when tested in a Si/Al 50 mixture, a material was produced with a Si/Al ratio of 25 (a value so far not attained for piperidinium-OSDAs in OH-media). This is still the lowest Al-substitution reported in AEI zeolites made in hydroxide media. Later, Cao et al. claimed a route for AEI (with Si/Al > 200) also using DEDMP in Al-deficient fluoride gels, based on using SSZ-39 seeds made in hydroxide media (Table 4, entry 3). However, Zones et al. published a thorough study investigating the role of a range of piperidinium-based OSDAs, also DEDMP, in fluoride media, but never obtained AEI. (190) Moliner et al. reproduced the original synthesis of SSZ-39, in the context of deNOx catalysis, with the use of N,N-dimethyl-3,5-dimethylpiperidinium (cis- and trans-3,5; unspecified isomer ratio, Table 4, entry 4). (181) They noted the large impact of different sources on the success of making SSZ-39 in hydroxide media, and they showed that only a specific combination of a FAU zeolite precursor, also a member of the d6r-only family, and sodium silicate (as in Zones patent) yielded SSZ-39. Later, Dusselier et al. showed that sodium silicate was replacable, e.g., by using TEOS or colloidal silica, as long as the FAU-zeolite Al-source was used, and the relatively high OH and Na+ contents remained. (184) Dusselier et al. also investigated the influence of diastereo- and structural isomers of the tetramethylated-piperidinium OSDAs by using different cis/trans-3,5 mixtures (ranging from 48/52 to 98/2) and mixtures of these with N,N-dimethyl-cis-2,6-dimethylpiperidinium (cis-2,6). From an economic point of view, these 3,5- and 2,6-dimethylpiperidine-based molecules are important, since their precursor dimethylpyridines are among the most common commercially produced alkylated pyridines. (184) The cis and trans isomers of the 3,5-form both arise during the hydrogenation of the aromatic ring, while for the 2,6-form, the cis-isomer dominates due to steric hindrance. Dusselier and co-workers showed specific conditions where SSZ-39 could be made, with cis-3,5, trans-3,5, or cis-2,6 isomers and, even tertiary, mixtures thereof (Table 4, entries 810). As the OSDA is often one of the decisive cost factors in commercial zeolite synthesis, these results are thus important, as mixtures (in line with the organic production) could be used instead of more expensive pure isomers. Although mixtures worked, the authors noted remarkable isomer-dependent trends for the AEI zeolite synthesis. A relative rate of formation trend was documented (in the studied conditions: trans-3,5 > cis-3,5 > cis-2,6). Second, it was shown that preferential incorporation existed (visible in 13C MAS NMR and confirmed by zeolite dissolution), when isomers where presented in competition (trans-3,5 > cis-3,5 and cis-2,6 > cis-3,5 isomer). Recently, Shantz and co-workers deepened the isomer-study, confirming most of the findings and the trans-induced faster rate of formation, while also carefully analyzing the solid yields. Additionally, in Si/Al 45 synthesis suspensions, a small but clear increase in the Si/Al ratio of the material is found when increasing the trans-isomer content. (191) On a side note, recently it was found that when the concentration of water content of syntheses with pure cis-3,5 was lowered (in fact only going from H2O:Si 35 to 20, in conditions like those of Table 4 entry 8), another zeolite formed. This zeolite, CIT-9, proved to be a fault-free GME. The concentrated cis-3,5 route thus ended a 40-year search for a simple recipe to a porous version of this 12 × 8 × 8 topology. (33) Although not a small-pore zeolite, this is informative in the light of targeting cage-based 8MR zeolites. The selectivity of the cis-OSDA for both GME and AEI, respectively in concentrated and dilute conditions, visualized in Figure 9, was suggested to be linked to the concentration of the OSDA in the syntheses. The cis-OSDAs were found in the 12MR channel of GME from molecular modeling, while for AEI, one OSDA per cage is found (Figure 9, left). The calculated energies for GME are most favorable when using two organics per unit cell, instead of less, implying OSDAs closely line up in the 12MR pore (Figure 9, right). It is likely that this type of structure-direction only occurs when the concentration in the synthesis suspension is high, while dilute conditions lead to AEI, with occlusion of one OSDA per cage.
Figure 9 Figure 9. Competition from the ratios of reflections measured in PXRD between small-pore AEI and large pore GME zeolites as a function of the concentration of the N,N-dimethyl-cis-3,5-dimethylpiperidinium OSDA. The modeling energy and OSDA position for GME are accurate and found in ref (33). The energy for AEI is found in earlier work, (192) without the optimal OSDA position documented: A simple cartoon showing one per cage (confirmed from various techniques) was made.
In this context, the work of Schmidt et al. is intriguing, as it documented a computational search for the optimal OSDA for SSZ-39. Besides proposing a new OSDA from computation and successfully obtaining AEI aluminosilicate with that heavily substituted, asymmetrically quaternized piperidine (Table 4, entry 11), they reported the calculated stabilization energies of all reported N-based OSDAs for SSZ-39. (185) In decreasing order, the values for DEDMP, azoniabicyclononane, N,N-dimethyl-2,6-dimethylpiperidinium, and N,N-dimethyl-3,5-dimethylpiperidinium (structures in Table 4) were 16.2, 14.9, 14.0, and 13.3 kJ/molSi. Their new OSDA scored the highest value of 16.9 kJ/molSi. SSZ-39 synthesis with this organic led to a material with relatively high Si/Al ratio of 13. The energy difference between the 3,5- and the 2,6-isomer OSDAs is not deemed significant enough to explain the differences in rates and incorporation noted by Dusselier et al. Moreover, the calculations did not take into account cis/trans-isomerism. Usually, for a given framework, stabilization energy differences among OSDAs on the order of 2 kJ/mol are significant to corroborate synthesis trends.
A new OSDA and set of conditions for AEI materials was reported by the Sano group, using tetraethylphosphonium hydroxide (TEP) and a FAU-zeolite as both Si and Al-source (Table 4, entry 5). This route, effectively an interzeolite conversion (method D in Tables 2 and 3), only worked well when a small amount of NaOH and specific dealuminated FAU zeolites (Si/Al ratios 11 and 17) were used. Remarkably, these synthesis-Si/Al ratios are similar to those used earlier in the mixtures with sodium silicate and an aluminous FAU zeolite. An issue with quaternized P-based organics is that during calcination, to remove the organic and empty the voids for application, often monomeric and condensed phosphorus species (e.g., oxides) remain in the solid. These P-species can alter the zeolites properties. A P/Al ratio of 1.2 was indeed found after calcination of these AEI zeolites. Later, the group revisited their procedure, to investigate the P-species in the zeolite, and demonstrated deNOx activity after Cu-exchange. Using an excessive amount of seeds and by adding NH4F, a pure-phase material with Si/Al = 21 was obtained using TEP (Table 4, entry 6). In the same work, the authors also successfully prepared SSZ-39 from interzeolite conversion with DEDMP (Table 4, entry 7). Although not highlighted in their work, this methodology is an easy route for SSZ-39, using classic (easy-to-remove) N-based organics. (183) The Si/Al ratio of the starting and product zeolite in this IZC were 16 and 12, respectively, suggesting a solid conversion yield near 75% (considering all Al incorporated in the new phase). Interestingly, the crystal sizes of the IZC-materials (entries 57) are somewhat smaller than those of the classic SSZ-39 zeolites, around 200600 nm (vs 0.51.0 μm). (183) The materials prepared by TEP also seemed significantly more thermally stable, likely by phosphorus-modification. In a more recent report, the authors even proposed a mixed-OSDA strategy, using DEDMP and TEP together (Table 4, entry 13) to take advantage of an optimal, small amount of phosphorus-modification, to increase the hydrothermal stability. (187) Martn et al. further studied IZC-methods for preparing SSZ-39 from FAU (actual USY-zeolites, Table 4, entry 12). (186) Notably, instead of DEDMP, (183) they used the cis/trans-3,5 OSDA (ratio unknown). This improvement could be relevant, as a diethyl-quaternization step in OSDA synthesis (e.g., for DEDMP) is usually harder than a dimethyl one. The Si/Al ratio of the starting and product zeolite were 10.5 and 8.2, respectively, indicating a high solid conversion yield. Interestingly, the authors also reported the addition of Cu-tetraethylenepentamine to this synthesis, yielding Cu-SSZ-39 for SCR directly (without Cu-exchange afterward). (186) The same authors also reported a modification of the TEP-procedure, using the Si/Al = 10.5 FAU-zeolite as source (Table 4, entry 14). (188) They noted, compared to their work above in a similar synthesis with cis/trans-3,5, that the crystal sizes of the resulting zeolites were very small and in the range of 50 nm. These zeolites are about an order of magnitude smaller than the TEP-zeolites reported earlier. The reason for this result is uncertain, although a faster nucleation rate, originating from an unknown interplay between the specific starting FAU zeolite and TEP is likely. Crystal sizes can be crucial to the performance in certain catalytic applications (see section 3.4.3.3). A recent AEI synthesis was also reported in this context, when Kubota and co-workers found medium-small crystallites (Table 4, entry 15) when using colloidal silica, an appropriate FAU-zeolite, and the cis/trans-3,5 OSDA (isomer ratio unknown). The concept in this report was to work with very low water content (H2O/Si = 3.3), and with specific alkaline ratios. The result, 300 nm small SSZ-39 particles, with a high Si/Al of 16, is remarkable and could be of use in catalysis. Additionally, an interesting and informative set of experiments was shown that involved different FAU precursors. For instance to obtain AEI in the conditions of entry 15, but with a more aluminous FAU (Si/Al = 5.3 instead of 10.3), the NaOH addition had to be increased to 0.24 (and the dilution, H2O:Si to 5), to avoid MTW and FAU competition. (189)
2.3.1.3. AEI-Zeolite Conclusions
AEI presents an important set of materials due to the excellent performance in both SCR and MTO catalysis (sections 3.2, 3.4). In the last 3 years, remarkable progress in its hydrothermal synthesis has been reported. Some interesting observations, insights, and comments can be made:(1) The Si/Al ratios of the zeolite prepared in hydroxide media still have not risen above 20 (except for one patent entry). The question is whether this derives (i) from structure-specific limitations of the AEI framework itself, favoring more Al-incorporation or (ii) due to the lack of an OSDA that fits very well. The latter could be plausible, given that the patent entry made use of the relatively large azonia-OSDA.
(2) Since AEI and CHA are very similar structures and both are d6r-only members, it is worthwhile to note that the latter can be made in OH-media up to Si/Al = 55 by using the very well fitting ADAM OSDA (section 2.3.3), and that there is no structural limitation to even pure-siliceous CHA materials (F-media). This argument is in favor of the possibility of creating AEI with higher ratios. On the other hand, creating highly siliceous cage-containing zeolites in hydroxide media should also be approached from a charge balance perspective: in the ideal case, one OSDA occupies every large cage. AEI has 36 T atoms surrounding the cage (Figure 7), with each T atom shared over 3 cages, rendering the amount of T atoms per cage at 12 (the unit cell, having 48 T atoms and 4 full cages, confirms this count). (184) This implies that the ideal AEI structure made with one OSDA per cage should include one aluminum for charge balancing, or thus have a Si/Al ratio of 11. The reported ratios in Table 4 seem to be centered around this value. Higher Si/Al values in OH-media entail the incorporation of charge-balancing siliceous defects (although these can anneal in calcination). Perhaps the structure of AEI does not allow the incorporation of such defects to the same extent as CHA, considering for instance that AEI has three crystallographically different (although very similar) T atoms, while CHA has one.
(3) A multitude of OSDAs for aluminosilicate AEI have been reported. Notably, the heavily substituted piperidinium published by Schmidt et al. (entry 11, Table 4), with the largest stabilization energy for the cage, has not been tested in a range of conditions intended for creating higher silica materials. (185) It should be.
(4) Not one AEI zeolite has been made without the presence of a FAU-zeolite. The FAU is used either as source for alumina, with silica added separately, or as only source in IZC. An exception here would be the fluoride-based method described in the patent, but there, AEI-seeds are used. To the best of our knowledge, aluminosilicate AEI is a unique case in this respect, certainly in the realm of 8MR zeolites. Since the source of alumina has so far always been a zeolite, there are indications that this influences the Al-incorporation into the new zeolite and thus its Si/Al ratio. Insights from the numerous IZC routes reported for CHA (see below, section 2.3.3.4) could be of use. Strikingly, CHA can be made without FAU-sources, but it seems to go faster if they are present (again pointing to the need for a good fitting OSDA for AEI). Both FAU and AEI are members of the d6r-only family (the only other 8MR-zeolite members are CHA, AFX, KFI, SAS, SFW, and TSC). It is likely that this structural similarity helps in forming the new zeolite during IZC (e.g., along the line of Figure 4, with 6MR-nanoparts) or partial IZC. The hypothesis, preeminent in IZC literature, (146) is that the new zeolite is formed faster (and selectively) through the reassembly of (nano)parts from the dissolving mother zeolite. It is also interesting to note the similarities to seeding and its benefits in classic synthesis. There, seeds sometimes completely disappear in the X-ray diffractogram in the first hours of the synthesis but still direct the crystallization to be faster or more selective, indicating that they do not completely dissolve to monomolecular T atoms. (193) (5) Although the AEI zeolite can thus be made with a different range of organics (Table 4, Zones patent), the inorganic conditions are thought to predominate over the organic/inorganic interactions. Zones noted this, because these zeolites are formed in the presence of high OH contents (i.e., 0.7 OH/Si). (178) This is thought to favor the occurrence of even-membered rings (AEI is built from 4, 6, and 8MR), as well as being needed to solubilize the aluminum. In Table 4, the OH content can be calculated by simply adding the OSDA/Si and Na/Si columns. (178) Interestingly, most syntheses where FAU was used and another silica source was added indeed feature a high OH/Si, while the IZC routes use remarkably less hydroxide. Given the fact that a FAU zeolite is built from 4MR and 6MR (d6r), there is a good chance that the complete breakdown of the structure to monomolecular Al- and Si-precursors is not occurring, but rather to some (not necessarily well-defined) nanoparts. (145,146) A possible reason why IZC routes need considerably less hydroxide for success (i.e., to inhibit other phases or amorphous solids) could be that the precursors-derived nanoparts with even-membered rings replace the role of a high-in-hydroxide medium favoring even-membered rings. Note that in the case of using FAU with additional silica, the Si/Al of the product is more than doubled with respect to the starting zeolite (entries 1, 4, 810). Considering a d6r (with 12 T atoms) in a FAU precursor with three aluminums (Si/Al = 9/3 = 3), this entails theoretically replacing one (or two) aluminums by external silicons to obtain a Si/Al = 5 (or 11). The use of a high hydroxide content in these FAU+silica syntheses is thus needed to mobilize aluminum, at least locally. The use of high hydroxide entails the coaddition of alkali (Na) that does not help in creating high-silica materials (Na+ can easily balance charge in d6r cages). On the contrary, in the case of pure IZC, the Si/Al ratios of the product are always lower than that of the starting FAU (entries 57, 1214), meaning that silica is being selectively dissolved during the transformation, and part of it stays in solution. There is thus less of a need for hydroxide-rich conditions since the aluminum does not need to be solubilized. These two types of synthesis, although leading to the same product and seemingly similar, are thus very different (!). There is of course a middle path, and in our opinion, this is embodied in the last entry in Table 4. Kubota and co-workers used an appropriate FAU source and a silica sol (instead of Na-silicate) and noted the crucial selection of both NaOH and water contents depending on the FAU used. Using less of a more aluminous FAU warranted higher hydroxide addition, but in a higher dilution, while using more of a siliceous FAU allowed the authors to use a lesser NaOH content in the gel. The latter also entailed heavily concentrating the solution to H2O/Si = 3.3. (189) We believe this is necessary to let the OSDA interact better with the FAU (note how these conditions start to resemble those of IZC, as these often rely on low water contents).
(6) Dusselier et al. found remarkable organic-sensitive trends in the isomer-study, although the inorganic conditions in these OH rich syntheses are thought to dominate (comment 5). (184) A likely explanation for these results is that the relative occurrence of kinetically competing phases (e.g., MOR) is altered by the different isomers. For instance in Si/Al = 15 mixtures, the 2,6-isomer did not produce AEI, while the 3,5-isomers did (in Si/Al = 30 mixtures, both isomers did produce AEI). Similarly, cis-3,5 leads to GME in concentrated conditions. The kinetic competition of other phases clearly differs with the Al-content of the synthesis. The reason why IZC (could) overcomes this, is perhaps that the aluminum is not substantially solubilized, as is the case in the isomer studies using additional silica (corroborating comment 5).
(7) Crystal sizes could offer insights into the mechanisms governing AEI synthesis, as they are determined by the interplay between nucleation and crystal growth. The interaction of FAU precursors with the OSDA and the added Na+ should mainly effect the former (e.g., nanosized synthesis by Martn et al). (188) (8) The most recent synthesis by Kubota and co-workers seems relevant for catalytic purposes (also see comment 5), as Al-incorporation this low had never been reported for the perhaps most accessible N,N-dimethyl-3,5-dimethylpiperidinium OSDA.
2.3.2. AFX
The first material reported with the AFX structure had a SAPO-composition. AFX is a member of the ABC-6 stacking family of structures. The ABC-6 pattern consists of planar hexagonal arrays of nonconnected 6MR that are translated horizontally and connected (stacked) vertically. Each planar layer is in an A, B, or C position, yielding repeating descriptions, e.g., ...AABBCCBB... for AFX (Figure 10). The other ABC-6 members in the 8MR zeolite family are CHA, EAB, ERI, LEV, and SFW. The ABC-6 pattern for AFX generates a large cage (aft composite building unit), resembling an extended version of the cage of CHA (Figure 7). Another way to build the AFX structure is by translating and connecting d6r units. As with AEI, AFX is a member of the d6r-only family. The only two other structures that belong to both the d6r-only and the ABC-6 families are CHA and SFW. The structural link between these three materials with expanding cages (Xie et al. (66)) provides an interesting case for relating synthesis and structure (Figure 10).

Note how the d6r-only nature in ABC-6 zeolites is visible in the double repeat of each layer (e.g., AA). Yellow = very large SFW cage.
The zeolite version of AFX, named SSZ-16, was discovered by Zones using a 1,4-bis(1-azoniabicyclo[2.2.2]octane)butyl dibromide OSDA in hydroxide media, in the presence of Na+. (39,142) This OSDA consists of two quinuclidine units connected by their quaternary nitrogen atoms through a four-carbon polymethylene bridge (Figure 11). The quinuclidine unit resembles 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane, better known as DABCO (structure in Figure 18, without the R-group of ERI OSDAs), but does not have a second N atom in the 4-position. A couple of other diquaternary OSDA (diquat) with four-carbon bridges were also found to work and are based on connecting two ADAM, two DABCO, or even two triethylammonium units. (38) Archer et al. used 1,3-imidazolium linked ADAMs for synthesizing SSZ-16 (not a diquat), (194) while Lee et al. reported C5-bridged triethylammoniums (Et6-diquat-5). (195)Figure 11 shows three of these SSZ-16 organics, along with the common OSDAs for CHA and SFW. The Si/Al range reported for AFX is narrow, from 3.7 to 17, suggesting that the d6r units in this zeolite have a preference for a specific amount of aluminum incorporation in OH media: from 1 to 3 aluminums per 12 T atoms (=d6r unit). The Si/Al ratio for the commonly used DABCO-, quinuclidine-, and triethylammonium-based diquats seems to be closer to 5 (or 2 Al per d6r). (38,164,195,196) The simplified T atom count per cage for charge balance estimates (as for AEI above and CHA below) is harder for AFX due to the presence of a second type of smaller cage (gme-unit, Figure 10), in spite of the structural similarity of the AFX cage and CHA-cage (1.5× expansion).
Figure 11 Figure 11. OSDA for CHA, AFX, and SFW (cages and structures in Figures 7 and 10) Only for SFW, two OSDAs per cage were found. ADAM = N,N,N-trimethyl-1-adamantylammonium.
The most siliceous AFX Si/Al (17) was reported using the monoquaternary bis-ADAM-imidazolium linked OSDA (Figure 11), (159) likely due to the lower charge-over-size ratio of this organic. Aiming at lower Si/Al ratios in the syntheses mixtures often gives competition with other Na+-rich phases that do not need to include organic. Given the d6r-only feature of AFX and the fact that the CHA zeolite, with structural similarity, can be made over the full range of Si/Al ratios, there does not appear to be a thermodynamically-induced lower limit to Al-incorporation. An all silica version of AFX should thus be able to form. The likely reason why no higher-silica versions of AFX have been made is that the stabilization energies of the reported OSDAs are not low enough, and perhaps most of these organics are too flexible. Considering that ADAM provides a very high stabilization of 16.7 kJ per mole of T atoms in CHA, its synthesis over a wider range of Si/Al is less surprising. The trends in AFX and SFW (for the latter, 11.1 kJ/mol is the lowest framework-OSDA stabilization encountered (137)) seem to indicate that higher silica materials need to have a more specific OSDAinorganic interaction, to be successfully synthesized in hydroxide media, or, in reverse, that these types of structures (ABC-6, d6r-only, cages) have a preferred Si/Al compositional range, tentatively estimated from 2.6 (close to natural CHA) to 11. An interesting and detailed synthesis study using the bis-triethylammonium diquat was reported by Hrabanek et al., showing the importance of aging and inorganic sources for SSZ-16. The authors noted a strong influence of nucleation on particle size and, interestingly, isolated coreshell structures with amorphous silica inside an SSZ-16 shell, when fumed silica was used. (197) Recently Martn et al. reported a new, IZC-based, route to AFX, with a large multicyclic DielsAlder derived OSDA that also led to ERI in slightly different conditions (OSDA: see Figure 18). A very small synthetic window and the use of the right FAU (Si/Al = 6) zeolite precursor led to AFX (i.e., OSDA/Si = 0.2, NaOH/Si = 0.1, H2O/Si = 15). The Si/Al range of the product, 5.2, is in line with previous SSZ-16 materials. The same conditions, save for changing Na+ for K+, lead to ERI. (198)
2.3.3. CHA
2.3.3.1. Synthetic Chabazite, SSZ-13, and Pure Silicas
As mentioned above and illustrated in Figures 7 and 10, the structure of CHA consists of symmetric, medium-sized cages obtained by stacking planes of nonconnected 6MR rings along an AABBCC sequence, or from d6r units. The latter description resembles that of AEI (Figure 8), but for CHA, the planes of d6r units are stacked on top of each other along the c-axis, without prior rotation. CHA has only one unique T atom position. Since the early days, attempts were made to synthetically access CHA-zeolites, given the interesting sorption and sieving properties, discovered as early as 1924 on chabazite minerals. Barrer and Baynham obtained species K-G from potassium aluminosilicate gels. (44) A standard recipe is now available to obtain this zeolite with Si/Al ratio between 2 and 3 in classic hydroxide media (cfr. Synthesis Commission of IZA). (167) This recipe uses Na+/K+ and M+/Al ratio of 0.085, and 2.2, respectively, at 95 C, in a Si/Al 2.6 gel with a FAU-type zeolite as T atom source (in fact an organic-free IZC). (199) Recipes with more classic sources are also known. A low-silica recipe using only K+ with addition of NH4F was reported recently. (200) A breakthrough in CHA zeolite synthesis was realized by Zones in 1985, who demonstrated Si/Al ratios well above those of the organic-free synthesis by using the large ADAM OSDA (Figure 11) in common hydroxide media. (4) Zeolites with Si/Al ratios higher than 10 are often required for catalytic applications, as they are more stable than their more aluminous counterparts at high temperatures or in steam-rich conditions. In synthesis mixtures with Si/Al ratios below 55, the zeolite can now readily be made with the according Si/Al ratio in the material. Above that ratio, the hydroxide syntheses also starts to produce MWW, STT, and AFI-type zeolites. (162,201,202) The large cages are ideally occupied by one ADAM molecule. By switching to fluoride media, Camblor and co-workers showed the possibility of making pure-silica CHA with ADAM. (162) Typically, such a synthesis works in the absence of inorganic cations, and the amount of HF added neutralizes the amount of base generated by the addition of the OSDA in its hydroxide form (ADAM(OH)). Furthermore, F anions associate closely with the ADAM cation and counterbalance its charge so that the framework can be neutral, and pure-silica CHA can form. (203) Zones SSZ-13 discovery was very important for the application-relevant CHA topology, (4) and it generally can be seen as a breakthrough for large cage-containing 8MR zeolites. Many materials, with useful Si/Al ratios, followed it: SSZ-16 (AFX), SSZ-45 (EEI), SSZ-50 (RTH), SSZ-52 (SFW), SSZ-73 (SAS), cfr. Table 3.
2.3.3.2. Alterations to the ADAM Recipe
Many variations to the Zones recipe have been reported. Eilertsen et al. detailed a recipe using ADAM, NaOH, and NaF (in a 2:3:1 OSDA:Na:F molar ratio), from aluminum(hydr)oxide and fumed silica sources. (202) This recipe appears to be a combination of fluoride and hydroxide-media and yields materials with Si/Al ratios between 15 and 133 (in agreement with similar values in the gels). The particle sizes were generally in the 20 μm range for the Si/Al ratios under 40 and were much smaller, close to 4 μm, for the higher Si/Al mixtures. In this context, Zones also patented a small crystallite aluminosilicate CHA, named SSZ-62, specifically with zeolite particles sizing between 0.050.1 μm, in the Si/Al = 1025 range. (55) Common crystal sizes are 1 μm or larger for SSZ-13. The small crystals were obtained with classic ADAM and NaOH synthesis, but with a specific Al-hydroxide gel (from easily soluble Al2O3) and precipitated amorphous silica, at a precise H2O:Si ratio of 16.
Usually, the unit cell of a zeolite contracts with decreasing Al incorporation, due to the larger bond length of AlO vs SiO. The unit cell parameters of Eilertsens SSZ-13 series with Si/Al ranging from 15133 were measured for both as-made and calcined materials. (202) For as-made materials, the authors found an anisotropic contraction, with most unit cell shrinkage along the a-axis, while the c-axis parameter remained more or less constant. In the calcined materials, there was a large relaxation of strain (or expansion of the unit cell with increasing Al content) along the c-axis as well. Likely, the trend in the as-made materials can be linked to the orientation of the OSDA in the zeolite: the ADAM cation sits either parallel or antiparallel to the c-axis, as determined on pure-silica forms by Villaescusa et al. (204) This arrangement could sterically prevent large shrinkages along the c-axis parameter of the unit cell in as-made higher silica materials. Interestingly, this would suggest that the structure direction with ADAM for CHA (and thus crystal growth) is more favorable at lower Si/Al ratios; as for more siliceous materials the ADAM-cavity fit is less good. This could be one of the reasons why the competition of other zeolites is more profound at Si/Al ratios >55 in OH-media, although charge balancing is also key (vide infra).
In search for a single-parameter variation synthesis, Eilertsen et al. reported another series of CHA-zeolites made in fluoride media (ADAM:HF = 1) and with Si/Al ratios ranging from 20 to infinity. The particle sizes of the zeolites in this series (at 24 μm), as well as the surface areas, are more or less constant. For Si/Al ratios larger than 100, Si/F ratios were around 12, confirming the incorporation of about one F-anion per OSDA in the materials, likely in the d6r unit, as in pure-silica CHA. (204,205) Such series are very useful in application studies, as the impact of purely Si/Al-variation on, e.g., catalysis or sorption, can be studied, while every other property remains more or less constant. Structureactivity relations in such cases are more unambiguous.
Lillerud and co-workers also investigated the formation of SSZ-13, with a focus on the particle size (through the crystal growth mechanism) in Si/Al = 50 syntheses from TEOS and aluminum hydroxide. (206) This Si/Al ratio is close to the upper limit for hydroxide media syntheses. The influence of stirring versus tumbling versus static syntheses on particle size and crystallinity was tracked in time (Figure 12). It is important to note that the starting point for particle size from dynamic light scattering (DLS, right curve) at time zero corresponds to aggregates of clusters of silicon/aluminum/ADAM, sizing about one micron, obtained by aging the precursor solution under stirring for 24 h at room temperature. The final particle sizes for static synthesis were larger (as expected), but for stirring, no growth of the particles was seen. The growth of particles under tumbling or static conditions was not behaving in a linear manner, but rather with an induction period (sigmoidal) and mostly, the particles grew after reaching full crystallinity (compare left to right plots). The crystallization is also slower in the case of the strongest agitation (stirring). The crystallization process can hence be partly controlled, as is particle size.
