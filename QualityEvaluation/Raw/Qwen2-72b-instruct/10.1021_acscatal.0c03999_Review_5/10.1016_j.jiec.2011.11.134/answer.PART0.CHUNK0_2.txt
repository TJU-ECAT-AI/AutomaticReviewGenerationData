[1] "ZSM-48, first synthesized by Chu [19],is another prospective candidate for supporting Ga2O3, because ZSM-48 is a high Si-containing zeolite with the uninterpenetrating linear 10-membered ring channels (0.530.56 nm) and its acid strength is relatively weaker than that of ZSM-5 [20]."
[2] "The acidity of HZSM-48 supported Ga2O3 catalyst was also compared with that of supported HZSM-5. As described in Table 2,the total amount of acid sites on Ga2O3/HZSM-48 catalyst is quite similar to that on Ga2O3/HZSM-5 with similar Si/Al ratio, while the amount of medium to strong acid sites is much lower, indicating that the acid strength of Ga2O3/HZSM-48 is much weaker in comparison with that of Ga2O3/HZSM-5."
[3] "The lower stability of Ga2O3/HZSM-48(130) may also be caused by its uninterpenetrating linear channels, which is easier to be blocked by the coke deposition during the reactions."

1.Zeolites, such as ZSM-48, are promising support materials for CO2-ODHP catalysts due to their high silicon content, uninterpenetrating linear 10-membered ring channels, and relatively weaker acid strength compared to other zeolites like ZSM-5. Dealumination and weakening methods can modify the acidity of zeolites, which contributes to optimizing catalytic performance by reducing the number of medium to strong acid sites. However, the choice and implementation of these strategies should consider the specific pore structure of the zeolite, as unidimensional pore structures like those in ZSM-48 can be more susceptible to blockage by coke deposition, affecting catalyst stability.

1.沸石，如ZSM-48，由于其高硅含量、非穿透性线性10元环通道和与ZSM-5等其他沸石相比相对较弱的酸强度，是CO2-ODHP催化剂有前景的支撑材料。脱铝和弱化方法可以改变沸石的酸性，通过减少中强酸位点的数量来优化催化性能。然而，在选择和实施这些策略时，应考虑沸石的具体孔结构，因为像ZSM-48这样的单向孔结构更容易被焦炭沉积堵塞，影响催化剂的稳定性。
