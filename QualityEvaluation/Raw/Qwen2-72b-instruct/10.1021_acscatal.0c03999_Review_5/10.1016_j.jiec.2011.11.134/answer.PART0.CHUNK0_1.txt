[1] "ZSM-48, first synthesized by Chu [19],is another prospective candidate for supporting Ga2O3, because ZSM-48 is a high Si-containing zeolite with the uninterpenetrating linear 10-membered ring channels (0.530.56 nm) and its acid strength is relatively weaker than that of ZSM-5 [20]."
[2] "The acidity of HZSM-48 supported Ga2O3 catalyst was also compared with that of supported HZSM-5. As described in Table 2,the total amount of acid sites on Ga2O3/HZSM-48 catalyst is quite similar to that on Ga2O3/HZSM-5 with similar Si/Al ratio, while the amount of medium to strong acid sites is much lower, indicating that the acid strength of Ga2O3/HZSM-48 is much weaker in comparison with that of Ga2O3/HZSM-5."
[3] "The selectivity on Ga2O3/HZSM-48 was much higher than that on Ga2O3/HZSM-5 at low propane conversion. With the increase of propane conversion, the selectivity difference became smaller."

1.Zeolites, such as ZSM-48, are promising support materials for CO2-ODHP catalysts due to their high silicon content, uninterpenetrating linear 10-membered ring channels, and relatively weaker acid strength compared to other zeolites like ZSM-5. Dealumination and weakening methods can modify the acidity of zeolites, which contributes to optimizing catalytic performance by reducing the number of medium to strong acid sites. Key considerations in selecting and implementing these strategies include the type of zeolite, the desired acid strength, and the specific reaction conditions. For instance, ZSM-48 with weaker acidity can improve selectivity to propene at low propane conversion, while ZSM-5 with stronger acidity may be more suitable for higher conversion rates.

1.沸石，如ZSM-48，是CO2-ODHP催化剂有前景的支撑材料，因为它们具有高硅含量、不相互穿透的线性10元环通道，以及与ZSM-5等其他沸石相比相对较弱的酸强度。脱铝和减弱方法可以改变沸石的酸性，这通过减少中强酸位点的数量来优化催化性能。在选择和实施这些策略时，关键考虑因素包括沸石的类型、所需的酸强度和特定的反应条件。例如，酸性较弱的ZSM-48可以提高在低丙烷转化率下对丙烯的选择性，而酸性较强的ZSM-5可能更适合高转化率。
