[1] "ZSM-48, first synthesized by Chu [19],is another prospective candidate for supporting Ga2O3, because ZSM-48 is a high Si-containing zeolite with the uninterpenetrating linear 10-membered ring channels (0.530.56 nm) and its acid strength is relatively weaker than that of ZSM-5 [20]."
[2] "The acidity of HZSM-48 supported Ga2O3 catalyst was also compared with that of supported HZSM-5. As described in Table 2,the total amount of acid sites on Ga2O3/HZSM-48 catalyst is quite similar to that on Ga2O3/HZSM-5 with similar Si/Al ratio, while the amount of medium to strong acid sites is much lower, indicating that the acid strength of Ga2O3/HZSM-48 is much weaker in comparison with that of Ga2O3/HZSM-5."
[3] "The lower stability of Ga2O3/HZSM-48(130) may also be caused by its uninterpenetrating linear channels, which is easier to be blocked by the coke deposition during the reactions."

1.Zeolites, such as ZSM-48, are promising support materials for CO2-ODHP catalysts due to their high silicon content, uninterpenetrating linear 10-membered ring channels, and relatively weaker acid strength compared to other zeolites like ZSM-5. Dealumination and weakening methods can modify the acidity of zeolites, which contributes to optimizing catalytic performance by reducing the number of medium to strong acid sites. Key considerations in selecting and implementing these strategies include the type of zeolite, the desired acid strength, and the potential for pore blockage by coke deposition during reactions. The modification of acidity can enhance selectivity and stability, but excessive weakening may lead to lower activity.

1.沸石，如ZSM-48，是CO2-ODHP催化剂有前景的支撑材料，因为它们具有高硅含量、不相互穿透的线性10元环通道，以及与ZSM-5等其他沸石相比相对较弱的酸强度。脱铝和弱化方法可以改变沸石的酸性，这通过减少中强酸位点的数量来优化催化性能。在选择和实施这些策略时，关键的考虑因素包括沸石的类型、所需的酸强度，以及在反应中因焦炭沉积导致的孔堵塞的可能性。酸性的修改可以提高选择性和稳定性，但过度的弱化可能会导致活性降低。
