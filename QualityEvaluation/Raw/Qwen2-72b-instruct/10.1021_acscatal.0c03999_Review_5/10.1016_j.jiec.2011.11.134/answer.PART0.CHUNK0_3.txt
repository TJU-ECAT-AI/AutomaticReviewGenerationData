[1] "ZSM-48, first synthesized by Chu [19],is another prospective candidate for supporting Ga2O3, because ZSM-48 is a high Si-containing zeolite with the uninterpenetrating linear 10-membered ring channels (0.530.56 nm) and its acid strength is relatively weaker than that of ZSM-5 [20]."
[2] "The acidity of HZSM-48 supported Ga2O3 catalyst was also compared with that of supported HZSM-5. As described in Table 2,the total amount of acid sites on Ga2O3/HZSM-48 catalyst is quite similar to that on Ga2O3/HZSM-5 with similar Si/Al ratio, while the amount of medium to strong acid sites is much lower, indicating that the acid strength of Ga2O3/HZSM-48 is much weaker in comparison with that of Ga2O3/HZSM-5."
[3] "The selectivity on Ga2O3/HZSM-48 was much higher than that on Ga2O3/HZSM-5 at low propane conversion. With the increase of propane conversion, the selectivity difference became smaller."

1.ZSM-48 is a promising support material for CO2-ODHP catalysts due to its high silicon content, uninterpenetrating linear 10-membered ring channels, and relatively weaker acid strength compared to ZSM-5. Dealumination and weakening methods can modify the acidity of zeolites, which contributes to optimizing catalytic performance by reducing the number of medium to strong acid sites. However, the key considerations in selecting and implementing these strategies depend on the specific type of zeolite used as a support. For instance, ZSM-48 has a similar total amount of acid sites to HZSM-5 with a similar Si/Al ratio, but fewer medium to strong acid sites, resulting in a weaker acid strength. This modification can lead to higher selectivity to propene at low propane conversion, but the selectivity difference becomes smaller with increased propane conversion.

1.ZSM-48是CO2-ODHP催化剂有希望的支撑材料，因为它具有高硅含量、不相互穿透的线性10元环通道和与ZSM-5相比相对较弱的酸强度。脱铝和弱化方法可以改变沸石的酸性，通过减少中强酸位的数量来优化催化性能。然而，选择和实施这些策略的关键考虑因素取决于用作支撑的具体沸石类型。例如，ZSM-48与具有相似Si/Al比的HZSM-5具有相似的总酸位数量，但中强酸位较少，导致酸强度较弱。这种修改可以在低丙烷转化率下导致更高的丙烯选择性，但随着丙烷转化率的增加，选择性差异变小。
