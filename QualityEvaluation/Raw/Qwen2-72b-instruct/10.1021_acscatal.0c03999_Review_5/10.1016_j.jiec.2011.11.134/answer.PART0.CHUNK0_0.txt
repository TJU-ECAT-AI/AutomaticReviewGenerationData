[1] "ZSM-48, first synthesized by Chu [19],is another prospective candidate for supporting Ga2O3, because ZSM-48 is a high Si-containing zeolite with the uninterpenetrating linear 10-membered ring channels (0.530.56 nm) and its acid strength is relatively weaker than that of ZSM-5 [20]."
[2] "The acidity of HZSM-48 supported Ga2O3 catalyst was also compared with that of supported HZSM-5. As described in Table 2,the total amount of acid sites on Ga2O3/HZSM-48 catalyst is quite similar to that on Ga2O3/HZSM-5 with similar Si/Al ratio, while the amount of medium to strong acid sites is much lower, indicating that the acid strength of Ga2O3/HZSM-48 is much weaker in comparison with that of Ga2O3/HZSM-5."
[3] "The selectivity on Ga2O3/HZSM-48 was much higher than that on Ga2O3/HZSM-5 at low propane conversion. With the increase of propane conversion, the selectivity difference became smaller."
[4] "The lower stability of Ga2O3/HZSM-48(130) may also be caused by its uninterpenetrating linear channels, which is easier to be blocked by the coke deposition during the reactions."

1.Zeolites, such as ZSM-48, are promising support materials for CO2-ODHP catalysts due to their high silicon content, uninterpenetrating linear 10-membered ring channels, and relatively weaker acid strength compared to other zeolites like ZSM-5. These properties contribute to optimizing catalytic performance by providing a suitable environment for the dehydrogenation reaction while minimizing side reactions. Dealumination and weakening methods can be used to modify the acidity of zeolites, which is crucial for enhancing selectivity and stability. Dealumination reduces the number of acid sites, particularly those with medium to strong strength, which can lead to higher selectivity to propene. Weakening methods, such as increasing the Si/Al ratio, can also decrease the acid strength, further improving selectivity. However, the stability of the catalyst can be compromised by these modifications, especially if the pore structure becomes more susceptible to blockage by coke deposition. Therefore, the key considerations in selecting and implementing these strategies include balancing the need for high selectivity with the requirement for long-term stability, taking into account the specific pore structure and acidity of the zeolite support.

1.沸石，如ZSM-48，是CO2-ODHP催化剂有前景的支撑材料，因为它们具有高硅含量、不相交的线性10元环通道和与ZSM-5等其他沸石相比相对较弱的酸强度。这些特性通过为脱氢反应提供合适的环境，同时最小化副反应，从而优化催化性能。脱铝和弱化方法可用于修改沸石的酸性，这对增强选择性和稳定性至关重要。脱铝减少了酸性位点的数量，特别是中强酸性位点，这可以导致丙烯选择性的提高。弱化方法，如增加Si/Al比，也可以降低酸强度，进一步提高选择性。然而，这些修改可能会损害催化剂的稳定性，特别是在孔结构更容易因焦炭沉积而堵塞的情况下。因此，在选择和实施这些策略时的关键考虑因素包括在高选择性需求与长期稳定性要求之间取得平衡，同时考虑到沸石支撑的具体孔结构和酸性。
