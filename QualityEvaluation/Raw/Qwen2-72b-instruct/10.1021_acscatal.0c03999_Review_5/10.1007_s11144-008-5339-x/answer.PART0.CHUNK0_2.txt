1. The literature does not provide information on the properties of zeolites as support materials for CO2-ODHP catalysts, nor does it discuss acidity modification techniques such as dealumination and weakening methods. Therefore, it is not possible to analyze how these modifications contribute to optimizing catalytic performance or to consider the key factors in selecting and implementing these strategies for different types of zeolites used as supports.
