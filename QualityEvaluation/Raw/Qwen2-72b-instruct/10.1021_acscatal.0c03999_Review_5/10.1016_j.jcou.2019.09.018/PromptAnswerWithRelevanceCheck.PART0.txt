[1] "Beta zeolite was applied due to a three-dimensional structure,the pores larger than those of ZSM-5 with 12-membered ring openings (0.75 by 0.57 nm for linear and 0.65 by 0.56 nm for tortuous channels),a high thermal and acid stability and a large specific surface area needed for high chromium species dispersion [3335]."
[2] "The Cr-containing SiBeta zeolite catalysts were ob- tained by two-step postsynthesis preparation procedure which consist, in the first step, removal of aluminum from TEABeta zeolite with Si/Al of 17 by treatment with nitric acid solution to obtain an aluminium-free SiBeta support with Si/Al ratio of 1000 and, in the second step, various amounts of Cr were introduced into the siliceous SiBeta zeolite structure by wet impregnation."
[3] "Low acidity of SiBeta is suitable for achieving high selectivity to propene (above 80 %) while high acidity of starting AlBeta promotes propane cracking to lighter hydrocarbons."

1.Zeolites, particularly Beta zeolites, are promising support materials for CO2-ODHP catalysts due to their three-dimensional structure, larger pore sizes compared to ZSM-5, high thermal and acid stability, and large specific surface area, which is essential for the high dispersion of chromium species. Dealumination, a process where aluminum is removed from the zeolite structure, is a common acidity modification technique. This process contributes to optimizing catalytic performance by reducing the acidity of the zeolite, which is beneficial for achieving high selectivity to propene. In contrast, high acidity in the starting AlBeta zeolite promotes propane cracking to lighter hydrocarbons, which is less desirable. The key considerations in selecting and implementing these strategies for different types of zeolites used as supports include the desired acidity level for the specific reaction, the stability of the zeolite under dealumination conditions, and the compatibility of the modified zeolite with the active metal species.

1.沸石，特别是Beta沸石，由于其三维结构、与ZSM-5相比更大的孔径、高热稳定性和酸稳定性以及大比表面积，是CO2-ODHP催化剂有希望的支撑材料，大比表面积对于铬物种的高分散至关重要。脱铝，即从沸石结构中去除铝的过程，是一种常见的酸性改性技术。这一过程通过降低沸石的酸性，有利于提高丙烯的选择性，从而有助于优化催化性能。相比之下，起始AlBeta沸石的高酸性促进丙烷裂解为更轻的烃类，这是不那么理想的。在选择和实施不同类型的沸石作为支撑材料的这些策略时，主要考虑因素包括特定反应所需的酸性水平、沸石在脱铝条件下的稳定性以及改性沸石与活性金属物种的兼容性。

Dealumination and weakening methods are used to modify the acidity of zeolites. Dealumination, which involves the removal of aluminum from the zeolite structure, can significantly impact the catalytic properties of the zeolite. The low acidity of SiBeta zeolite, obtained through dealumination, is suitable for achieving high selectivity to propene, while the high acidity of AlBeta zeolite promotes propane cracking to lighter hydrocarbons. The key considerations in selecting and implementing these strategies for different types of zeolites used as supports include the desired catalytic activity, selectivity, and stability under reaction conditions.

1.沸石，尤其是Beta沸石，是CO2-ODHP催化剂有希望的支撑材料，因为它们具有三维结构，孔径大于ZSM-5，高热稳定性和酸稳定性，以及大比表面积，这是高分散铬物种所必需的。脱铝和弱化方法用于修改沸石的酸性。脱铝，涉及从沸石结构中去除铝，可以显著影响沸石的催化性能。通过脱铝获得的SiBeta沸石的低酸性适合于实现高丙烯选择性，而AlBeta沸石的高酸性促进丙烷裂解为更轻的烃类。在选择和实施这些策略用于不同类型的沸石作为支撑时，主要考虑因素包括所需的催化活性，选择性和在反应条件下的稳定性。

Dealumination, a method of removing aluminum from the zeolite structure, can significantly modify the acidity of the zeolite. This process, when applied to TEABeta zeolite, results in an aluminium-free SiBeta support with a high Si/Al ratio, which is beneficial for the dispersion of chromium species. The acidity of the zeolite support plays a crucial role in the catalytic performance. Low acidity, as seen in SiBeta, is advantageous for achieving high selectivity to propene, while high acidity, as in AlBeta, promotes the cracking of propane to lighter hydrocarbons, which is less desirable. The choice and implementation of acidity modification strategies, such as dealumination, should be carefully considered based on the specific type of zeolite used as a support and the desired catalytic outcome.
