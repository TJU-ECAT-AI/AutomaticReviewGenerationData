[1] "Beta zeolite was applied due to a three-dimensional structure,the pores larger than those of ZSM-5 with 12-membered ring openings (0.75 by 0.57 nm for linear and 0.65 by 0.56 nm for tortuous channels),a high thermal and acid stability and a large specific surface area needed for high chromium species dispersion."
[2] "The Cr-containing SiBeta zeolite catalysts were ob- tained by two-step postsynthesis preparation procedure which consist, in the first step, removal of aluminum from TEABeta zeolite with Si/Al of 17 by treatment with nitric acid solution to obtain an aluminium-free SiBeta support with Si/Al ratio of 1000 and, in the second step, various amounts of Cr were introduced into the siliceous SiBeta zeolite structure by wet impregnation."
[3] "Low acidity of SiBeta is suitable for achieving high selectivity to propene (above 80 %) while high acidity of starting AlBeta promotes propane cracking to lighter hydrocarbons."

1.Zeolites, especially Beta zeolites, are promising support materials for CO2-ODHP catalysts due to their three-dimensional structure, larger pore size compared to ZSM-5, high thermal and acid stability, and large specific surface area, which is essential for the high dispersion of chromium species. Dealumination, a method of removing aluminum from zeolites, can significantly modify the acidity of the support. By treating TEABeta zeolite with nitric acid, an aluminium-free SiBeta support with a high Si/Al ratio can be obtained. This process reduces the acidity of the zeolite, which is beneficial for achieving high selectivity to propene in the CO2-ODHP process. In contrast, the high acidity of the starting AlBeta zeolite promotes the cracking of propane to lighter hydrocarbons, which is less desirable. The choice and implementation of acidity modification strategies, such as dealumination, should consider the specific properties of the zeolite and the desired catalytic performance for the CO2-ODHP process.

1.沸石，尤其是Beta沸石，由于其三维结构、与ZSM-5相比更大的孔径、高热稳定性和酸稳定性以及大比表面积，是CO2-ODHP催化剂的有希望的支撑材料，大比表面积对于铬物种的高分散至关重要。脱铝，一种从沸石中去除铝的方法，可以显着改变支撑材料的酸性。通过用硝酸处理TEABeta沸石，可以获得无铝的SiBeta支撑材料，其Si/Al比值高。该过程降低了沸石的酸性，这对CO2-ODHP过程中提高丙烯的选择性有利。相比之下，起始AlBeta沸石的高酸性促进了丙烷裂解为更轻的烃类，这是不那么理想的。选择和实施酸性改性策略（如脱铝）时，应考虑沸石的具体性质和CO2-ODHP过程所需的催化性能。
