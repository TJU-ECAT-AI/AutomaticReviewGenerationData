[1] "Beta zeolite was applied due to a three-dimensional structure,the pores larger than those of ZSM-5 with 12-membered ring openings (0.75 by 0.57 nm for linear and 0.65 by 0.56 nm for tortuous channels),a high thermal and acid stability and a large specific surface area needed for high chromium species dispersion [3335]."
[2] "The Cr-containing SiBeta zeolite catalysts were ob- tained by two-step postsynthesis preparation procedure which consist, in the first step, removal of aluminum from TEABeta zeolite with Si/Al of 17 by treatment with nitric acid solution to obtain an aluminium-free SiBeta support with Si/Al ratio of 1000 and, in the second step, various amounts of Cr were introduced into the siliceous SiBeta zeolite structure by wet impregnation."
[3] "Low acidity of SiBeta is suitable for achieving high selectivity to propene (above 80 %) while high acidity of starting AlBeta promotes propane cracking to lighter hydrocarbons."

1.Zeolites, particularly Beta zeolites, are promising support materials for CO2-ODHP catalysts due to their three-dimensional structure, larger pore sizes compared to ZSM-5, high thermal and acid stability, and large specific surface area, which is essential for the high dispersion of chromium species. Dealumination, a process that removes aluminum from the zeolite structure, can be used to modify the acidity of zeolites. This technique contributes to optimizing catalytic performance by creating a support with low acidity, which is suitable for achieving high selectivity to propene. In contrast, high acidity in the starting AlBeta zeolite promotes propane cracking to lighter hydrocarbons, which is less desirable. The key considerations in selecting and implementing these strategies for different types of zeolites used as supports include the desired acidity level for the specific reaction and the compatibility of the modification technique with the zeolite's structure and stability.

1.沸石，特别是Beta沸石，由于其三维结构、与ZSM-5相比更大的孔径、高热稳定性和酸稳定性以及大比表面积，是CO2-ODHP催化剂有希望的支撑材料，大比表面积对于铬物种的高分散至关重要。脱铝，即从沸石结构中去除铝的过程，可用于修改沸石的酸性。该技术通过创建低酸性的支撑，有助于优化催化性能，适用于实现高丙烯选择性。相比之下，起始AlBeta沸石的高酸性促进丙烷裂解为更轻的烃类，这是不那么理想的。在选择和实施用于不同类型的沸石支撑材料的这些策略时，主要考虑因素包括特定反应所需的酸性水平以及修改技术与沸石结构和稳定性的兼容性。
