[1] "Beta zeolite was applied due to a three-dimensional structure,the pores larger than those of ZSM-5 with 12-membered ring openings (0.75 by 0.57 nm for linear and 0.65 by 0.56 nm for tortuous channels),a high thermal and acid stability and a large specific surface area needed for high chromium species dispersion [3335]."
[2] "The Cr-containing SiBeta zeolite catalysts were ob- tained by two-step postsynthesis preparation procedure which consist, in the first step, removal of aluminum from TEABeta zeolite with Si/Al of 17 by treatment with nitric acid solution to obtain an aluminium-free SiBeta support with Si/Al ratio of 1000 and, in the second step, various amounts of Cr were introduced into the siliceous SiBeta zeolite structure by wet impregnation."
[3] "Comparing of catalytic activity of Cr-containing Beta zeolite catalysts with the identical Cr content (2 wt % of Cr) supported on SiBeta and AlBeta revealed that the dealumination has great impact on catalytic properties."
[4] "Low acidity of SiBeta is suitable for achieving high selectivity to propene (above 80 %) while high acidity of starting AlBeta promotes propane cracking to lighter hydrocarbons."

1.Zeolites, especially Beta zeolites, are promising support materials for CO2-ODHP catalysts due to their three-dimensional structure, larger pore size than ZSM-5, high thermal and acid stability, and large specific surface area, which is necessary for high dispersion of chromium species. Dealumination and weakening methods are used to modify the acidity of zeolites. Dealumination, which involves the removal of aluminum from the zeolite structure, can significantly impact the catalytic properties of the zeolite. The low acidity of SiBeta zeolite, obtained through dealumination, is suitable for achieving high selectivity to propene, while the high acidity of AlBeta zeolite promotes propane cracking to lighter hydrocarbons. The key considerations in selecting and implementing these strategies for different types of zeolites used as supports include the desired catalytic activity, selectivity, and stability under reaction conditions.

1.沸石，尤其是Beta沸石，是CO2-ODHP催化剂有希望的支撑材料，因为它们具有三维结构，孔径大于ZSM-5，高热稳定性和酸稳定性，以及大比表面积，这是高分散铬物种所必需的。脱铝和弱化方法用于修改沸石的酸性。脱铝，涉及从沸石结构中去除铝，可以显著影响沸石的催化性能。通过脱铝获得的SiBeta沸石的低酸性适合于实现高丙烯选择性，而AlBeta沸石的高酸性促进丙烷裂解为更轻的烃类。在选择和实施这些策略用于不同类型的沸石作为支撑时，主要考虑因素包括所需的催化活性，选择性和在反应条件下的稳定性。
