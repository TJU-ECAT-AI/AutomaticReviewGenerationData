[1] "As discussed in section 3.1.1.3, the nature of the support has a crucial role in affecting metal dispersion and preserving redox Cr species; therefore, it strongly influences catalytic performance in CO2ODHP."
[2] "In addition to the aforementioned mesoporous silica and various metal oxides, zeolites are also promising support materials because of their microporosity with large surface area, tunable acidity, and excellent thermostability."
[3] "Dealumination is widely used to eliminate the surface acidity, and approaches include acid treatment (22) and steaming treatments at temperatures."
[4] "Weakening acidity is an alternative to control the surface acidity and can be achieved by tuning the Al amount (143) and incorporating another element into the framework of zeolite to displace the original strong Brnsted acid sites."
[5] "Therefore, a balance of such a trade-off can optimize the catalytic performance on Ga2O3/HZSM-5 treated at 700 C (Table 6)."
[6] "Differently, Ren et al. tune the Si/Al molar ratio (i.e., 60242) of ZnO/HZSM-5 by varying the amount of Al source, namely, NaAlO2, during preparation."
[7] "Clearly, reducing the number of acid sites on HZSM-5 is a more effective approach to boost C3H8 dehydrogenation to C3H6 than weakening the acidity."

1.Zeolites are promising support materials for CO2-ODHP catalysts due to their microporosity, large surface area, tunable acidity, and excellent thermostability. Dealumination and weakening methods are used to modify the acidity of zeolites, which is crucial for optimizing catalytic performance. Dealumination, achieved through acid treatment or steaming treatments, eliminates surface acidity, while weakening acidity can be controlled by tuning the Al amount or incorporating another element into the zeolite framework. The balance between reducing and weakening acidity is essential for optimizing catalytic performance, as reducing the number of acid sites on HZSM-5 is more effective for boosting C3H8 dehydrogenation to C3H6 than weakening the acidity. The selection and implementation of these strategies depend on the specific type of zeolite used as support, with considerations for the desired reaction pathway and stability.

1.沸石作为CO2-ODHP催化剂的支撑材料具有微孔性、大表面积、可调酸性和优异的热稳定性，因此很有前景。通过脱铝和减弱方法来修改沸石的酸性，这对优化催化性能至关重要。脱铝通过酸处理或蒸汽处理实现，消除了表面酸性，而减弱酸性可以通过调整Al含量或在沸石框架中引入另一种元素来控制。减少和减弱酸性之间的平衡对于优化催化性能至关重要，因为减少HZSM-5上的酸性位点数量比减弱酸性更有效地促进C3H8脱氢生成C3H6。这些策略的选择和实施取决于用作支撑的具体沸石类型，需要考虑所需的反应途径和稳定性。
