[1] "As discussed in section 3.1.1.3, the nature of the support has a crucial role in affecting metal dispersion and preserving redox Cr species; therefore, it strongly influences catalytic performance in CO2ODHP."
[2] "In addition to the aforementioned mesoporous silica and various metal oxides, zeolites are also promising support materials because of their microporosity with large surface area, tunable acidity, and excellent thermostability."
[3] "Dealumination is widely used to eliminate the surface acidity, and approaches include acid treatment (22) and steaming treatments at temperatures."
[4] "Weakening acidity is an alternative to control the surface acidity and can be achieved by tuning the Al amount (143) and incorporating another element into the framework of zeolite to displace the original strong Brnsted acid sites."
[5] "Therefore, a balance of such a trade-off can optimize the catalytic performance on Ga2O3/HZSM-5 treated at 700 C (Table 6)."
[6] "Despite high selectivity, Ga2O3/HZSM-48 has worse stability than the HZSM-5-supported counterpart. This can be ascribed to weak-acid-induced side reactions, through which the formed coke clogs the 2D channels."
[7] "Therefore, an optimal Si/Al ratio is obtained at 160 with the highest C3H6 yield (Table 6)."
[8] "Introducing phosphorus into HZSM-5 is another option to displace the original strong Brnsted acid sites by newly created weakened Brnsted acid sites, as well as to improve hydrothermal stability."
[9] "Clearly, reducing the number of acid sites on HZSM-5 is a more effective approach to boost C3H8 dehydrogenation to C3H6 than weakening the acidity."

Zeolites are promising support materials for CO2-ODHP catalysts due to their microporosity, large surface area, tunable acidity, and excellent thermostability. Dealumination, including acid treatment and steaming treatments, is used to eliminate surface acidity, which can promote C3H8 cracking and the formation of C2H6, C2H4, and CH4. Weakening acidity by tuning the Al amount or incorporating another element into the zeolite framework can control surface acidity. The balance between eliminating and weakening acidity is crucial for optimizing catalytic performance. For example, Ga2O3/HZSM-5 treated at 700 C shows optimized performance. However, weak-acid-induced side reactions can lead to coke formation and clog the 2D channels, affecting stability. An optimal Si/Al ratio can be achieved to maximize C3H6 yield. Introducing phosphorus into HZSM-5 can displace strong Brnsted acid sites and improve hydrothermal stability. Reducing the number of acid sites on HZSM-5 is more effective than weakening acidity for boosting C3H8 dehydrogenation to C3H6.

沸石作为CO2-ODHP催化剂的支撑材料具有微孔性、大表面积、可调酸性和优异的热稳定性。脱铝，包括酸处理和蒸汽处理，用于消除表面酸性，这可以促进C3H8的裂解和C2H6、C2H4和CH4的形成。通过调整Al含量或在沸石框架中引入另一种元素来减弱酸性，可以控制表面酸性。消除和减弱酸性之间的平衡对于优化催化性能至关重要。例如，700 C处理的Ga2O3/HZSM-5显示出优化的性能。然而，弱酸诱导的副反应会导致焦炭的形成和堵塞2D通道，影响稳定性。可以通过优化Si/Al比来最大化C3H6的产量。将磷引入HZSM-5可以置换强布氏酸位点并提高水热稳定性。减少HZSM-5上的酸位点数量比减弱酸性更有效地促进C3H8脱氢为C3H6。
