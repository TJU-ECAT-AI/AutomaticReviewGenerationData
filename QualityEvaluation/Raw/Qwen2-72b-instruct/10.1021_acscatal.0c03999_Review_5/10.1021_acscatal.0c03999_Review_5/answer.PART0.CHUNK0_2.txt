[1] "As discussed in section 3.1.1.3, the nature of the support has a crucial role in affecting metal dispersion and preserving redox Cr species; therefore, it strongly influences catalytic performance in CO2ODHP."

The properties that make zeolites promising support materials for CO2-ODHP catalysts include their microporosity with large surface area, tunable acidity, and excellent thermostability. Dealumination, which can be achieved through acid treatment or steaming treatments, is used to eliminate surface acidity, which is crucial for selectively activating the CH bond rather than the CC bond. Weakening acidity can be achieved by tuning the Al amount or incorporating another element into the zeolite framework to displace strong Brnsted acid sites. These modifications contribute to optimizing catalytic performance by balancing the trade-off between activity and stability. Key considerations in selecting and implementing these strategies include the type of zeolite used as support, the desired balance between activity and stability, and the specific reaction conditions. For example, Ga2O3/HZSM-5 treated at 700 C shows optimized catalytic performance. Increasing the Si/Al ratio is an option to weaken acidity, and introducing phosphorus into HZSM-5 can displace strong Brnsted acid sites and improve hydrothermal stability.

使分子筛成为CO2-ODHP催化剂有希望的支撑材料的特性包括其具有大表面积的微孔性、可调酸性和优异的热稳定性。脱铝，可以通过酸处理或蒸气处理实现，用于消除表面酸性，这对于选择性激活CH键而不是CC键至关重要。减弱酸性可以通过调整Al含量或在分子筛框架中引入另一种元素来取代强布伦斯特酸位点来实现。这些修改通过平衡活性和稳定性之间的权衡，有助于优化催化性能。在选择和实施这些策略时的关键考虑因素包括用作支撑的分子筛类型、所需的活性和稳定性之间的平衡以及特定的反应条件。例如，700 C处理的Ga2O3/HZSM-5显示出优化的催化性能。增加Si/Al比是减弱酸性的选择，向HZSM-5中引入磷可以取代强布伦斯特酸位点并提高水热稳定性。
