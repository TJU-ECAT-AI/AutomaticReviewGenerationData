          [1] "As discussed in section 3.1.1.3, the nature of the support has a crucial role in affecting metal dispersion and preserving redox Cr species; therefore, it strongly influences catalytic performance in CO2ODHP."
          [2] "In addition to the aforementioned mesoporous silica and various metal oxides, zeolites are also promising support materials because of their microporosity with large surface area, tunable acidity, and excellent thermostability."
          [3] "Dealumination is widely used to eliminate the surface acidity, and approaches include acid treatment (22) and steaming treatments at temperatures."
          [4] "Weakening acidity is an alternative to control the surface acidity and can be achieved by tuning the Al amount (143) and incorporating another element into the framework of zeolite to displace the original strong Brnsted acid sites."
          [5] "Therefore, a balance of such a trade-off can optimize the catalytic performance on Ga2O3/HZSM-5 treated at 700 C (Table 6)."
          [6] "Increasing Si/Al ratios is an option to weaken the acidity."
          [7] "Differently, Ren et al. tune the Si/Al molar ratio (i.e., 60242) of ZnO/HZSM-5 by varying the amount of Al source, namely, NaAlO2, during preparation."
          [8] "Introducing phosphorus into HZSM-5 is another option to displace the original strong Brnsted acid sites by newly created weakened Brnsted acid sites, as well as to improve hydrothermal stability."
          [9] "Clearly, reducing the number of acid sites on HZSM-5 is a more effective approach to boost C3H8 dehydrogenation to C3H6 than weakening the acidity."

          The properties that make zeolites promising support materials for CO2-ODHP catalysts include their microporosity with a large surface area, tunable acidity, and excellent thermostability. Dealumination, achieved through acid treatment or steaming treatments, is used to eliminate surface acidity, which can lead to the cracking of C3H8 and the formation of undesired products. Weakening acidity by tuning the Al amount or incorporating another element into the zeolite framework to displace strong Brnsted acid sites is an alternative approach to control surface acidity. The balance between the number of acid sites and their strength is crucial for optimizing catalytic performance. Increasing the Si/Al ratio is an option to weaken acidity, and introducing phosphorus into HZSM-5 can displace strong Brnsted acid sites with weaker ones, improving hydrothermal stability. However, reducing the number of acid sites on HZSM-5 is more effective for boosting C3H8 dehydrogenation to C3H6 than simply weakening the acidity.

          使分子筛成为CO2-ODHP催化剂有希望的支撑材料的特性包括其微孔性，具有大的表面积，可调的酸度和优异的热稳定性。脱铝，通过酸处理或蒸汽处理实现，用于消除表面酸性，这可能导致C3H8的裂解和不希望产物的形成。通过调整Al含量或在分子筛框架中引入另一种元素来置换强布伦斯特酸位点，以减弱酸性，是控制表面酸性的另一种方法。酸位点数量和强度之间的平衡对于优化催化性能至关重要。增加Si/Al比是减弱酸性的一种选择，而在HZSM-5中引入磷可以置换强布伦斯特酸位点，形成较弱的布伦斯特酸位点，同时提高水热稳定性。然而，减少HZSM-5上的酸位点数量对于促进C3H8脱氢至C3H6比仅仅减弱酸性更有效。
