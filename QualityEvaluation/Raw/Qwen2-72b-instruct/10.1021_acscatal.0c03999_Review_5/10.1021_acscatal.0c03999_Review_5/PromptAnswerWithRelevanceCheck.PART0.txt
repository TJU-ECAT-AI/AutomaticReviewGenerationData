[1] "As discussed in section 3.1.1.3, the nature of the support has a crucial role in affecting metal dispersion and preserving redox Cr species; therefore, it strongly influences catalytic performance in CO2ODHP."
[2] "In addition to the aforementioned mesoporous silica and various metal oxides, zeolites are also promising support materials because of their microporosity with large surface area, tunable acidity, and excellent thermostability."
[3] "Dealumination is widely used to eliminate the surface acidity, and approaches include acid treatment (22) and steaming treatments at temperatures."
[4] "Weakening acidity is an alternative to control the surface acidity and can be achieved by tuning the Al amount (143) and incorporating another element into the framework of zeolite to displace the original strong Brnsted acid sites."
[5] "Therefore, a balance of such a trade-off can optimize the catalytic performance on Ga2O3/HZSM-5 treated at 700 C (Table 6)."
[6] "Despite high selectivity, Ga2O3/HZSM-48 has worse stability than the HZSM-5-supported counterpart. This can be ascribed to weak-acid-induced side reactions, through which the formed coke clogs the 2D channels."
[7] "Therefore, an optimal Si/Al ratio is obtained at 160 with the highest C3H6 yield (Table 6)."
[8] "Introducing phosphorus into HZSM-5 is another option to displace the original strong Brnsted acid sites by newly created weakened Brnsted acid sites, as well as to improve hydrothermal stability."
[9] "Clearly, reducing the number of acid sites on HZSM-5 is a more effective approach to boost C3H8 dehydrogenation to C3H6 than weakening the acidity."

Zeolites are promising support materials for CO2-ODHP catalysts due to their microporosity, large surface area, tunable acidity, and excellent thermostability. Dealumination, including acid treatment and steaming treatments, is used to eliminate surface acidity, which can promote C3H8 cracking and the formation of C2H6, C2H4, and CH4. Weakening acidity by tuning the Al amount or incorporating another element into the zeolite framework can control surface acidity. The balance between eliminating and weakening acidity is crucial for optimizing catalytic performance. For example, Ga2O3/HZSM-5 treated at 700 C shows optimized performance. However, weak-acid-induced side reactions can lead to coke formation and clog the 2D channels, affecting stability. An optimal Si/Al ratio can be achieved to maximize C3H6 yield. Introducing phosphorus into HZSM-5 can displace strong Brnsted acid sites and improve hydrothermal stability. Reducing the number of acid sites on HZSM-5 is more effective than weakening acidity for boosting C3H8 dehydrogenation to C3H6.

沸石作为CO2-ODHP催化剂的支撑材料具有微孔性、大表面积、可调酸性和优异的热稳定性。脱铝，包括酸处理和蒸汽处理，用于消除表面酸性，这可以促进C3H8的裂解和C2H6、C2H4和CH4的形成。通过调整Al含量或在沸石框架中引入另一种元素来减弱酸性，可以控制表面酸性。消除和减弱酸性之间的平衡对于优化催化性能至关重要。例如，700 C处理的Ga2O3/HZSM-5显示出优化的性能。然而，弱酸诱导的副反应会导致焦炭的形成和堵塞2D通道，影响稳定性。可以通过优化Si/Al比来最大化C3H6的产量。将磷引入HZSM-5可以置换强布氏酸位点并提高水热稳定性。减少HZSM-5上的酸位点数量比减弱酸性更有效地促进C3H8脱氢为C3H6。

1.Zeolites are promising support materials for CO2-ODHP catalysts due to their microporosity, large surface area, tunable acidity, and excellent thermostability. Dealumination and weakening methods are used to modify the acidity of zeolites, which is crucial for optimizing catalytic performance. Dealumination, achieved through acid treatment or steaming treatments, eliminates surface acidity, while weakening acidity can be controlled by tuning the Al amount or incorporating another element into the zeolite framework. The balance between reducing and weakening acidity is essential for optimizing catalytic performance, as reducing the number of acid sites on HZSM-5 is more effective for boosting C3H8 dehydrogenation to C3H6 than weakening the acidity. The selection and implementation of these strategies depend on the specific type of zeolite used as support, with considerations for the desired reaction pathway and stability.

1.沸石作为CO2-ODHP催化剂的支撑材料具有微孔性、大表面积、可调酸性和优异的热稳定性，因此很有前景。通过脱铝和减弱方法来修改沸石的酸性，这对优化催化性能至关重要。脱铝通过酸处理或蒸汽处理实现，消除了表面酸性，而减弱酸性可以通过调整Al含量或在沸石框架中引入另一种元素来控制。减少和减弱酸性之间的平衡对于优化催化性能至关重要，因为减少HZSM-5上的酸性位点数量比减弱酸性更有效地促进C3H8脱氢生成C3H6。这些策略的选择和实施取决于用作支撑的具体沸石类型，需要考虑所需的反应途径和稳定性。

The properties that make zeolites promising support materials for CO2-ODHP catalysts include their microporosity with large surface area, tunable acidity, and excellent thermostability. Dealumination, which can be achieved through acid treatment or steaming treatments, is used to eliminate surface acidity, which is crucial for selectively activating the CH bond rather than the CC bond. Weakening acidity can be achieved by tuning the Al amount or incorporating another element into the zeolite framework to displace strong Brnsted acid sites. These modifications contribute to optimizing catalytic performance by balancing the trade-off between activity and stability. Key considerations in selecting and implementing these strategies include the type of zeolite used as support, the desired balance between activity and stability, and the specific reaction conditions. For example, Ga2O3/HZSM-5 treated at 700 C shows optimized catalytic performance. Increasing the Si/Al ratio is an option to weaken acidity, and introducing phosphorus into HZSM-5 can displace strong Brnsted acid sites and improve hydrothermal stability.

使分子筛成为CO2-ODHP催化剂有希望的支撑材料的特性包括其具有大表面积的微孔性、可调酸性和优异的热稳定性。脱铝，可以通过酸处理或蒸气处理实现，用于消除表面酸性，这对于选择性激活CH键而不是CC键至关重要。减弱酸性可以通过调整Al含量或在分子筛框架中引入另一种元素来取代强布伦斯特酸位点来实现。这些修改通过平衡活性和稳定性之间的权衡，有助于优化催化性能。在选择和实施这些策略时的关键考虑因素包括用作支撑的分子筛类型、所需的活性和稳定性之间的平衡以及特定的反应条件。例如，700 C处理的Ga2O3/HZSM-5显示出优化的催化性能。增加Si/Al比是减弱酸性的选择，向HZSM-5中引入磷可以取代强布伦斯特酸位点并提高水热稳定性。

Dealumination, achieved through acid treatment or steaming treatments, is used to eliminate surface acidity, which can lead to the cracking of C3H8 and the formation of undesired products. Weakening acidity by tuning the Al amount or incorporating another element into the zeolite framework to displace strong Brnsted acid sites is an alternative approach to control surface acidity. The balance between the number of acid sites and their strength is crucial for optimizing catalytic performance. Increasing the Si/Al ratio is an option to weaken acidity, and introducing phosphorus into HZSM-5 can displace strong Brnsted acid sites with weaker ones, improving hydrothermal stability. However, reducing the number of acid sites on HZSM-5 is more effective for boosting C3H8 dehydrogenation to C3H6 than simply weakening the acidity.
