The properties that make zeolites promising support materials for CO2-ODHP catalysts include their microporosity with a large surface area, tunable acidity, and excellent thermostability. Dealumination, which can be achieved through acid treatment or steaming treatments, is used to eliminate surface acidity, which is crucial for selectively activating the CH bond rather than the CC bond. Weakening acidity by tuning the Al amount or incorporating another element into the zeolite framework to displace strong Brnsted acid sites is an alternative approach to control surface acidity. These modifications contribute to optimizing catalytic performance by balancing the trade-off between activity and stability. For instance, Ga2O3/HZSM-5 treated at 700 C shows optimized catalytic performance. The selection and implementation of these strategies for different types of zeolites used as supports should consider the balance between activity and stability, as well as the specific requirements of the reaction. Reducing the number of acid sites on HZSM-5 is more effective than weakening the acidity for boosting C3H8 dehydrogenation to C3H6.

使分子筛成为CO2-ODHP催化剂有希望的支撑材料的特性包括其微孔性，具有大的表面积，可调的酸性和优异的热稳定性。脱铝，可以通过酸处理或蒸气处理实现，用于消除表面酸性，这对于选择性地激活CH键而不是CC键至关重要。通过调整Al含量或在分子筛框架中引入另一种元素来置换强布伦斯特酸位点，以减弱酸性，是控制表面酸性的另一种方法。这些修改通过平衡活性和稳定性的权衡，有助于优化催化性能。例如，700 C处理的Ga2O3/HZSM-5显示出优化的催化性能。对于用作支撑的不同类型的分子筛，选择和实施这些策略时应考虑活性和稳定性之间的平衡，以及反应的具体要求。减少HZSM-5上的酸位点数量比减弱酸性更有效地促进C3H8脱氢至C3H6。
