[1] "ZSM-5, a typical MFI-type zeolite, has been widely used in the petrochemical industry. Owing to the tri-dimensional micropore structure, large specific surface area, high thermal and hydrothermal stability,the ZSM-5 zeolite is considered to be a good catalyst or support. Moreover, medium pore size and pore channel structure render ZSM-5 zeolite resistant to coking."
[2] "The acidity of various HZSM-5 supports was measured using cumene cracking as a model reaction, and the results are listed in Table 2. It can be seen that the activ- ity decreases markedly after steaming treatment. This is indicative of the removal of some framework Al atoms in the HZSM-5 zeolite upon steaming treatment, since cumene cracking is catalyzed only by the Brnsted acid sites."
[3] "The acidity of various HZSM-5 supports was also measured by the NH3-TPD method, and the results are summarized in Table 2. As presented in Table 2, the number of weak acid sites (expressed as the amount of NH3 desorbed at 120350 ), strong acid sites (ex- pressed as the amount of NH3 desorbed at 350600 ) and total acid sites of the steaming-treated HZSM-5 are evidently lower than those of the parent HZSM-5. The severer the steaming condition, the lower the acidity."
[4] "The above results suggest that too many and too few Brnsted acidic sites on HZSM-5 are both not favored to the dehydrogenation reaction, and appro- priate density of Brnsted acidic sites on HZSM-5 is crucial to the catalytic performance of ZnO/HZSM-5."

1.Zeolites, especially MFI-type zeolites like ZSM-5, are promising support materials for CO2-ODHP catalysts due to their tri-dimensional micropore structure, large specific surface area, high thermal and hydrothermal stability, and medium pore size and pore channel structure that make them resistant to coking. Dealumination and weakening methods, such as steaming treatment, can modify the acidity of zeolites by removing some framework Al atoms, reducing the number of Brnsted acid sites. This contributes to optimizing catalytic performance by achieving an appropriate density of Brnsted acidic sites on the zeolite support, which is crucial for the dehydrogenation reaction. The key considerations in selecting and implementing these strategies for different types of zeolites used as supports include the severity of the steaming condition, which affects the acidity of the zeolite, and the balance between the number of acid sites and the dispersion of the active metal component on the support.

1.沸石，特别是MFI型沸石如ZSM-5，是CO2-ODHP催化剂有希望的支撑材料，因为它们具有三维微孔结构、大比表面积、高热稳定性和水热稳定性，以及中等孔径和孔道结构，使它们具有抗焦炭性能。脱铝和弱化方法，如蒸汽处理，可以通过去除一些框架Al原子来改变沸石的酸性，减少Brnsted酸位的数量。这通过在沸石支撑上实现适当的Brnsted酸位密度，对优化催化性能有贡献，这对脱氢反应至关重要。在选择和实施这些策略时，为不同类型的用作支撑的沸石考虑的关键因素包括蒸汽条件的严重性，这会影响沸石的酸性，以及酸位数量和活性金属组分在支撑上的分散之间的平衡。
