[1] "ZSM-5, a typical MFI-type zeolite, has been widely used in the petrochemical industry. Owing to the tri-dimensional micropore structure, large specific surface area, high thermal and hydrothermal stability,the ZSM-5 zeolite is considered to be a good catalyst or support. Moreover, medium pore size and pore channel structure render ZSM-5 zeolite resistant to coking."
[2] "The acidity of various HZSM-5 supports was measured using cumene cracking as a model reaction, and the results are listed in Table 2. It can be seen that the activ- ity decreases markedly after steaming treatment. This is indicative of the removal of some framework Al atoms in the HZSM-5 zeolite upon steaming treatment, since cumene cracking is catalyzed only by the Brnsted acid sites."
[3] "The acidity of various HZSM-5 supports was also measured by the NH3-TPD method, and the results are summarized in Table 2. As presented in Table 2, the number of weak acid sites (expressed as the amount of NH3 desorbed at 120350 ), strong acid sites (ex- pressed as the amount of NH3 desorbed at 350600 ) and total acid sites of the steaming-treated HZSM-5 are evidently lower than those of the parent HZSM-5. The severer the steaming condition, the lower the acidity."
[4] "The above results suggest that too many and too few Brnsted acidic sites on HZSM-5 are both not favored to the dehydrogenation reaction, and appro- priate density of Brnsted acidic sites on HZSM-5 is crucial to the catalytic performance of ZnO/HZSM-5."

1.Zeolites, such as ZSM-5, are promising support materials for CO2-ODHP catalysts due to their tri-dimensional micropore structure, large specific surface area, high thermal and hydrothermal stability, and resistance to coking. Dealumination and weakening methods, such as steaming treatment, can modify the acidity of zeolites by removing framework Al atoms and reducing the number of Brnsted acid sites. These modifications contribute to optimizing catalytic performance by providing an appropriate density of Brnsted acidic sites, which is crucial for the dehydrogenation reaction. When selecting and implementing these strategies for different types of zeolites used as supports, key considerations include the specific properties of the zeolite, the desired acidity level for the reaction, and the potential impact on catalyst stability and selectivity.

1.沸石，如ZSM-5，是CO2-ODHP催化剂有希望的支撑材料，因为它们具有三维微孔结构、大比表面积、高热稳定性和水热稳定性，以及抗焦化性。脱铝和削弱方法，如蒸汽处理，可以通过去除框架Al原子和减少Brnsted酸位的数量来改变沸石的酸性。这些修改通过提供适当的Brnsted酸性位密度，对优化催化性能有贡献，这对脱氢反应至关重要。在为不同类型的用作支撑的沸石选择和实施这些策略时，关键考虑因素包括沸石的具体性质、反应所需的酸度水平，以及对催化剂稳定性和选择性可能的影响。
