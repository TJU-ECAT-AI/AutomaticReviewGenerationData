1.The literature does not provide specific information on the primary challenges in current propylene production methods, the advantages and limitations of oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP), or the challenges associated with using oxygen as an oxidant. However, it does mention that propylene is an important raw material in the production of various chemicals, and the conventional manufacturing methods such as catalytic and steam cracking do not meet the increasing demand. Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) has received much attention as an alternative method. The process is endothermic and thermodynamically limited, requiring temperatures above 800 K for commercially feasible conversions. At these temperatures, undesirable side reactions limit the propylene yield and coke formation necessitates frequent catalyst regeneration. The use of too high contact time or temperature causes cracking as a side reaction. To reduce catalyst deactivation, cokeremoving agents such as steam and hydrogen have been used as cofeeds in certain commercial processes. Steam controls the reaction temperature, serving as a heat sink and enhancing selectivity. The literature also discusses the use of carbon dioxide (CO2) as a potential alternative oxidant in the oxidative conversions of hydrocarbons, as it is a greenhouse gas and can be used as a coke removing agent.

1.文献没有提供关于当前丙烯生产方法的主要挑战、氧化脱氢丙烷(ODHP)的优点和局限性，以及使用氧气作为氧化剂的具体挑战的具体信息。但是，它确实提到丙烯是生产各种化学品的重要原料，传统的制造方法如催化裂解和蒸汽裂解无法满足日益增长的需求。丙烷脱氢(PDH)作为一种替代方法受到了广泛关注。该过程是吸热的，受到热力学限制，需要800 K以上的温度才能实现商业上可行的转化率。在这些温度下，不希望的副反应限制了丙烯的产量，焦炭的形成需要频繁的催化剂再生。使用过高的接触时间或温度会导致裂解作为副反应。为了减少催化剂失活，已经将除焦剂如蒸汽和氢气作为共进料用于某些商业过程。蒸汽控制反应温度，作为热阱并增强选择性。文献还讨论了二氧化碳(CO2)作为潜在的替代氧化剂在烃类氧化转化中的应用，因为它是温室气体，可以作为除焦剂使用。
