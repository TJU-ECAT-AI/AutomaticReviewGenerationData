1.The primary challenges in current propylene production methods, such as catalytic and steam cracking, are that they produce propylene as a byproduct and do not meet the increasing demand. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by directly converting propane to propylene, which can potentially meet the demand more efficiently. However, ODHP presents its own set of advantages and limitations, particularly in the context of oxidant selection. Oxygen is an attractive oxidant because ODHP is an exothermic and non-thermodynamically limited reaction. However, the propylene selectivity of the reaction remains a challenge due to the risk of over-oxidation of propane. Carbon dioxide, on the other hand, appears as a potential alternative oxidant because it is a milder oxidant and can also serve as a cokeremoving agent. However, the use of carbon dioxide in ODHP is characterized by rapid catalyst deactivation due to coke formation, which limits the practical application of this process.

1.当前丙烯生产方法的主要挑战,如催化裂化和蒸汽裂化,是它们将丙烯作为副产品生产,无法满足日益增长的需求。丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)通过直接将丙烷转化为丙烯,潜在地更有效地满足需求,解决了这些问题。然而,ODHP在氧化剂选择方面有其自身的一系列优势和局限性。氧气是一种有吸引力的氧化剂,因为ODHP是一种放热的、非热力学限制的反应。然而,由于丙烷过度氧化的风险,反应的丙烯选择性仍然是一个挑战。另一方面,二氧化碳似乎是一种潜在的替代氧化剂,因为它是一种温和的氧化剂,也可以作为去除焦炭的剂。然而,在ODHP中使用二氧化碳的特点是催化剂因焦炭形成而迅速失活,这限制了该过程的实际应用。
