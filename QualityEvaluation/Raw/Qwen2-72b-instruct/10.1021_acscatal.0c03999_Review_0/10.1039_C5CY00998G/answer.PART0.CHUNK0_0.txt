[1] "Propene (C3H6) is among the foundation feedstock for large volume commodities and specialty chemicals, such as cumene, acrylonitrile,propylene oxide and high-purity polypropylene, and its demand is expected to increase significantly in the near future.1 At present, its industrial production is based on non-oxidative processing of petroleum-based materials, via steam cracking, fluid-catalytic- cracking and catalytic dehydrogenation.2 As far as the catalytic dehydrogenation is concerned,commercial processes use Cr2O3/Al2O3 (18-20 Cr wt%; Catofin press) or Pt(<1 wt%),Sn (1-2 wt%)/Al2O3 (Oleflex process).3 Possible replacements with lower costs and sustainable alternatives is attracting a rising interest since many years, and the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of propane appeared among the most promising, because of the higher energy efficiency (ODH is exothermic, while dehydrogenation and cracking are endothermic processes), and process simplicity."
[2] "A review on the catalysts for propane ODH was compiled by Cavani et al. in 2007,2 who considered the performances in ODH of propane with O2 as oxidant of almost 100 catalysts, with different active phases,reported in literature over the 2000-2006 period, and concluded that the best propylene yields resulting from propane ODH (ca. 30%) were still far from being interesting for industrial implementation, as well as the information concerning catalyst lifetime appeared quite limited."
[3] "Moreover, in that review the set-up of catalytic materials and/or reactor configurations capable of maintaining high selectivity to propylene under conditions leading to high propane conversion was addressed as main direction for future development."
[4] "Later on, an initial yield in C3H6 as high as ca. 47%, decreasing to ca. 33% after 8 h on stream were reported for propane dehydrogenation over GaOx based catalysts.4 More recently, the kinetics for the ODH of C3H8 on VOx catalysts was reviewed by Carrero et al., and for the systems considered the combination of reported conversions and selectivities resulted in yields in C3H6 not exceeding 30%.5 Conversely, Ovsitser et al.,reported the attainment of a yield in propene of ca. 40% for the oxidative dehydrogenation of C3H8 under O2 lean-conditions over VOx/SiO2 catalysts, even a quite long reaction time.6 Similar results were obtained by these authors for the oxydative dehydrogenation of iso-C4H10 to iso-C4H8.7"
[5] "In this respect, the attainment of high selectivity to olefins via ODH of alkanes is basically limited, from a chemical point of view, by the use of O2 as oxidant, because of the occurrence of the over- oxidation to carbon oxides of both fed paraffins and produced olefins."
[6] "Although ODH of propane in the presence of CO2 is an endothermic process (H298K= + 166.6 kJ/mol), the addition of a small amount of oxygen can turn the process towards an exothermic character, and additional positive effects towards the catalyst coking might be expected."

1. The primary challenges in current propylene production methods, which are based on non-oxidative processing of petroleum-based materials, include high energy consumption and the need for sustainable alternatives. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by offering higher energy efficiency due to its exothermic nature, as opposed to the endothermic processes of dehydrogenation and cracking. ODHP also presents the advantage of process simplicity. However, the use of oxygen as an oxidant in ODHP presents its own set of challenges, particularly in maintaining high selectivity to propylene under conditions that lead to high propane conversion. The over-oxidation to carbon oxides of both the feed paraffins and produced olefins is a significant limitation when using oxygen as an oxidant. The use of CO2 as a mild oxidant has attracted attention due to its potential to mitigate these issues and reduce the likelihood of over-oxidation.

1. 当前丙烯生产方法的主要挑战在于，基于非氧化处理石油基材料的生产方法能耗高，并且需要可持续的替代方案。丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)通过其放热性质提高了能源效率，解决了这些问题，与吸热的脱氢和裂解过程相比，ODHP提供了更高的能源效率。ODHP还具有工艺简单的优势。然而，使用氧气作为ODHP的氧化剂，其自身也存在一系列挑战，特别是在维持高丙烯选择性的同时，实现高丙烷转化率的条件下。当使用氧气作为氧化剂时，原料石蜡和产生的烯烃过度氧化为碳氧化物是一个显著的限制。由于其潜在能够缓解这些问题并降低过度氧化的可能性，二氧化碳作为温和氧化剂的使用引起了人们的关注。
