[1] "Propene (C3H6) is among the foundation feedstock for large volume commodities and specialty chemicals, such as cumene, acrylonitrile,propylene oxide and high-purity polypropylene, and its demand is expected to increase significantly in the near future."
[2] "At present, its industrial production is based on non-oxidative processing of petroleum-based materials, via steam cracking, fluid-catalytic- cracking and catalytic dehydrogenation."
[3] "Possible replacements with lower costs and sustainable alternatives is attracting a rising interest since many years, and the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of propane appeared among the most promising, because of the higher energy efficiency (ODH is exothermic, while dehydrogenation and cracking are endothermic processes), and process simplicity."
[4] "A review on the catalysts for propane ODH was compiled by Cavani et al. in 2007,2 who considered the performances in ODH of propane with O2 as oxidant of almost 100 catalysts, with different active phases,reported in literature over the 2000-2006 period, and concluded that the best propylene yields resulting from propane ODH (ca. 30%) were still far from being interesting for industrial implementation, as well as the information concerning catalyst lifetime appeared quite limited."
[5] "Moreover, in that review the set-up of catalytic materials and/or reactor configurations capable of maintaining high selectivity to propylene under conditions leading to high propane conversion was addressed as main direction for future development."
[6] "On such a basis, the use of CO2 as mild oxidant has attracted attention after the successful use in other partial oxidation reactions such as dry reforming8,9 and oxidative coupling of methane.10, 11 Although ODH of propane in the presence of CO2 is an endothermic process (H298K= + 166.6 kJ/mol), the addition of a small amount of oxygen can turn the process towards an exothermic character, and additional positive effects towards the catalyst coking might be expected."

1.Current propylene production methods, which rely on non-oxidative processing of petroleum-based materials through steam cracking, fluid-catalytic cracking, and catalytic dehydrogenation, are facing challenges due to the expected significant increase in demand for propene in the near future. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) is seen as a promising alternative due to its higher energy efficiency and process simplicity. However, the use of oxygen as an oxidant in ODHP presents challenges, as the best propylene yields (around 30%) are still not high enough for industrial implementation, and information on catalyst lifetime is limited. The development of catalytic materials and reactor configurations capable of maintaining high selectivity to propylene under conditions leading to high propane conversion is a main direction for future development. The use of CO2 as a mild oxidant has attracted attention due to its potential to turn the process towards an exothermic character and to have positive effects on catalyst coking.

1.当前丙烯生产方法，依赖于通过蒸汽裂解、流化催化裂解和催化脱氢等非氧化处理石油基材料，正面临挑战，因为预计未来丙烯需求将大幅增加。丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）被视为一种有前景的替代方案，因为它具有更高的能源效率和过程简单性。然而，使用氧气作为ODHP中的氧化剂存在挑战，因为最好的丙烯产量（约30%）仍然不足以用于工业实施，关于催化剂寿命的信息也相当有限。开发能够在高丙烷转化率条件下保持高丙烯选择性的催化材料和反应器配置是未来发展的主要方向。使用二氧化碳作为温和氧化剂已引起关注，因为它有可能将过程转向放热性质，并对催化剂焦化产生积极影响。
