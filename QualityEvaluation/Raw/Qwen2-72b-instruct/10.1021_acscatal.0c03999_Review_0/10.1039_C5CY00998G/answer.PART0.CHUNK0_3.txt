[1] "Propene (C3H6) is among the foundation feedstock for large volume commodities and specialty chemicals, such as cumene, acrylonitrile,propylene oxide and high-purity polypropylene, and its demand is expected to increase significantly in the near future."
[2] "At present, its industrial production is based on non-oxidative processing of petroleum-based materials, via steam cracking, fluid-catalytic- cracking and catalytic dehydrogenation."
[3] "Possible replacements with lower costs and sustainable alternatives is attracting a rising interest since many years, and the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of propane appeared among the most promising, because of the higher energy efficiency (ODH is exothermic, while dehydrogenation and cracking are endothermic processes), and process simplicity."
[4] "A review on the catalysts for propane ODH was compiled by Cavani et al. in 2007,2 who considered the performances in ODH of propane with O2 as oxidant of almost 100 catalysts, with different active phases,reported in literature over the 2000-2006 period, and concluded that the best propylene yields resulting from propane ODH (ca. 30%) were still far from being interesting for industrial implementation, as well as the information concerning catalyst lifetime appeared quite limited."
[5] "Moreover, in that review the set-up of catalytic materials and/or reactor configurations capable of maintaining high selectivity to propylene under conditions leading to high propane conversion was addressed as main direction for future development."
[6] "On such a basis, the use of CO2 as mild oxidant has attracted attention after the successful use in other partial oxidation reactions such as dry reforming8,9 and oxidative coupling of methane.10, 11 Although ODH of propane in the presence of CO2 is an endothermic process (H298K= + 166.6 kJ/mol), the addition of a small amount of oxygen can turn the process towards an exothermic character, and additional positive effects towards the catalyst coking might be expected."

1.Current methods of propylene production, such as steam cracking, fluid-catalytic cracking, and catalytic dehydrogenation, are based on non-oxidative processing of petroleum-based materials. These methods are energy-intensive and have high costs. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) is considered a promising alternative due to its higher energy efficiency and process simplicity. However, the best propylene yields from ODHP (around 30%) are still not high enough for industrial implementation, and information about catalyst lifetime is limited. The development of catalytic materials and reactor configurations that can maintain high selectivity to propylene under conditions leading to high propane conversion is a major direction for future research. The use of CO2 as a mild oxidant in ODHP has attracted attention due to its potential to turn the process towards an exothermic character and reduce catalyst coking.

1.目前的丙烯生产方法，如蒸汽裂解、流化催化裂解和催化脱氢，都是基于非氧化处理石油基材料。这些方法能耗高，成本高。丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)由于其更高的能效和工艺简单性，被认为是一种有前景的替代方法。然而，ODHP的最佳丙烯产量(约30%)仍然不足以用于工业实施，关于催化剂寿命的信息也有限。开发能在高丙烷转化率条件下保持高丙烯选择性的催化材料和反应器配置是未来研究的主要方向。在ODHP中使用CO2作为温和氧化剂因其有可能将过程转向放热性质并减少催化剂焦化而受到关注。
