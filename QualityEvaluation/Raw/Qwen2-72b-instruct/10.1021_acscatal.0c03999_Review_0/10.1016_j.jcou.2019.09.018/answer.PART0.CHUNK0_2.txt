1.The literature does not provide specific information on the primary challenges in current propylene production methods, nor does it detail how oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues. However, it does mention that the demand for propene is growing and that current sources, such as steam cracking and catalytic cracking, may not meet this demand without negatively impacting the production of other valuable co-products. The literature suggests that selective processes dedicated solely to propene synthesis, such as propane dehydrogenation, could gain significance. It also notes that oxidative dehydrogenation processes, including ODHP, typically offer higher per-pass conversion of propane and yield of propene compared to non-oxidative dehydrogenation. The use of CO2 in the process is seen as an attractive alternative to traditional PDH due to its potential to remove thermodynamic limits and increase production through hydrogen binding in consecutive reactions. The literature does not explicitly discuss the limitations of ODHP or the specific challenges associated with using oxygen as an oxidant.

1.文献没有提供当前丙烯生产方法的主要挑战的具体信息，也没有详细说明丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)如何解决这些问题。但是，它确实提到丙烯的需求正在增长，而目前的来源，如蒸汽裂解和催化裂解，可能无法满足这一需求，而不对其他有价值的副产品的生产产生负面影响。文献建议，专门用于丙烯合成的精选过程，如丙烷脱氢，可能会变得越来越重要。它还指出，氧化脱氢过程，包括ODHP，通常提供比非氧化脱氢更高的丙烷单程转化率和丙烯产量。使用CO2的过程被视为传统PDH的有吸引力的替代方案，因为它有可能通过连续反应中的氢结合去除热力学限制并增加产量。文献没有明确讨论ODHP的局限性或使用氧气作为氧化剂的具体挑战。
