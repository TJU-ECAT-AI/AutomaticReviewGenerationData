A B S T R A C T
New active and selective catalysts for propane to propene dehydrogenation in assistance of CO2 (CO2-PDH) were prepared by chromium incorporation in siliceous SiBeta. The Cr-containing SiBeta zeolite catalysts were ob- tained by two-step postsynthesis preparation procedure which consist, in the first step, removal of aluminum from TEABeta zeolite with Si/Al of 17 by treatment with nitric acid solution to obtain an aluminium-free SiBeta support with Si/Al ratio of 1000 and, in the second step, various amounts of Cr were introduced into the siliceous SiBeta zeolite structure by wet impregnation. The well correlation between the number of redox Cr sites and propene yield up to 2 wt % of Cr has been determined. Comparing of catalytic activity of Cr-containing Beta zeolite catalysts with the identical Cr content (2 wt % of Cr) supported on SiBeta and AlBeta revealed that the dealumination has great impact on catalytic properties. Low acidity of SiBeta is suitable for achieving high selectivity to propene (above 80 %) while high acidity of starting AlBeta promotes propane cracking to lighter hydrocarbons. Moreover, in switch operation mode between propane dehydrogenation in presence and absence of CO2 the formation rate of propene raises in mode with CO2 only over Cr-containing SiBeta zeolite catalyst,while over Cr-containing AlBeta zeolite catalyst a negative effect on the rate of propene formation was observed.
1. Introduction
Nowadays unsaturated hydrocarbons are basic and most important intermediates for chemical industry. Particularly, the demand for pro- pene has been growing since it has found an assured position on the chemical raw material and monomers market due to its numerous uses.
Worldwide demand for propene currently reaches 90 million tonnes per year and at an estimated growth rate of about 5 % annually, will reach a value of around 130 million tonnes by 2023 [1]. It is estimated that such high demand for propene wont be satisfied by its current two most important sources, that is, steam cracking and catalytic cracking, in which propene is obtained as co-products. Attempts at increasing pro- pene production, e.g. through optimisation of conditions of these pro- cesses, will negatively influence the production of other important co- products. Thus, selective processes dedicated solely to propene synth- esis, such as propane dehydrogenation, olefin metathesis, and propene synthesis using methanol (e.g. MTP - methanol-to-propene), will gain significance with time.
Concerns connected to meeting demand for propene without si- multaneously decreasing production of remaining valuable products also favour intensification of fundamental research. One of the crucial research directions is the development of a new selective process of obtaining propene from propane that could replace propane dehy- drogenation process
(PDH)
currently used for industrial needs.
However, this process has disadvantages such as reversibility and en- dothermalness. An attractive alternative for the traditional PDH is propane oxidative dehydrogenation in the presence of O2 (ODH) or propane dehydrogenation in the presence of CO2 (CO2-PDH). A shared characteristic of all the aforementioned processes is utilising a co-re- agent that either removes PDH thermodynamic limits or increases production through hydrogen binding in consecutive reactions.
Typically in this process per-pass conversion of propane and yield of propene are higher than in commercial non-oxidative dehydrogenation.
Moreover, due to large scale propene production the process can be attractive way for chemical CO2 utilisation, because in addition to propene, hydrogen and carbon monoxide (syngas) are produced as the main products. Some possibility of CO2-PDH integration with syngas or propene required processes are proposed previously [2].
Many different catalysts were investigated in CO2-PDH containing Pt [3], Ni-Fe [4] Cr [516], Ga [1720], In-Al [2123], Fe [24] or V https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcou.2019.09.018 Received 23 July 2019; Received in revised form 12 September 2019; Accepted 25 September 2019 Corresponding authors.

[25,26]. Among them, the chromium oxide-based materials are con- sidered as a very promising for CO2-PDH due to high activity and se- lectivity. The mechanism of propane dehydrogenation in presence of CO2 is complex. Various possible scenarios of the CO2-PDH in which propene is produced either by non-oxidative dehydrogenation with participation of Cr(II) or/and Cr(III) species or by various redox me- chanisms with participation of carbon dioxide as a mild oxidant in an oxidative dehydrogenation pathway have been proposed [10,2731]. In the oxidative pathway various redox cycles between the oxidised/re- duced forms of Cr sites, such as Cr(III)/Cr(II), Cr(VI)/Cr(III) or Cr(V)/Cr (III) has been suggested. It has been recognized that high dispersion and presence of redox chromium species are important factors for achieving high catalytic performance in CO2-PDH [18,27,28]. From above reasons chromium is typically dispersed on a support. Very good support en- suring high chromium dispersion is silica, particularly of ordered me- soporous structure. Due to large specific surface area (in the most cases above 1000 m2 g1) of mesoporous materials like MCM-41, SBA-1, SBA-15 or MSUx a high dispersion and concentration of chromium oxide species can be obtained in comparison to unordered silica support [6,9,10,14,18,27,28]. Others tested support, for instance γ-Al2O3,which is commercially used for chromium dispersion in PDH catalyst (CATOFIN Process) or active carbon are less useful. Over γ-Al2O3 sup- ported chromium oxide catalysts CO2 addition exerts poisoning effect while in the case of active carbon supported catalyst an application in CO2-PDH is limited by period regeneration with air [5,11,32].
In this work Cr-containing Beta zeolites were investigated as a catalysts for propane dehydrogenation in the presence of carbon di- oxide. Beta zeolite was applied due to a three-dimensional structure,the pores larger than those of ZSM-5 with 12-membered ring openings (0.75 by 0.57 nm for linear and 0.65 by 0.56 nm for tortuous channels),a high thermal and acid stability and a large specific surface area needed for high chromium species dispersion [3335]. We have shown that dealumination of Beta and subsequently chromium dispersion by simple impregnation procedure give excellent catalysts for CO2-PDH.
2. Experimental
2.1. Materials preparation
The AlBeta support with a Si/Al atomic ratio of 17 was obtained by calcination of tetraethylammonium Beta (TEABeta) parent zeolite in air at 550 C for 15 h. The SiBeta support with a Si/Al atomic ratio of 1000 was obtained by a treatment of TEABeta with 13 mol L1 HNO3 solu- tion at 80 C for 4 h, washed with distilled water and dried at 95 C overnight.
Chromium-containing SiBeta catalysts were obtained by two-step postsynthesis methodwet impregnation. In typical procedure, the SiBeta was contacted with an aqueous chromium nitrate solutions containing from 0.8 to 15.2·103 mol L1 Cr(NO3)3·9H2O and AlBeta was con- tacted with solution containing 3.2·103 mol L1 Cr(NO3)3·9H2O.
Then, the separation of the solids from the suspensions were done in evaporator under vacuum of a membrane pump for 2 h in air at 60 C.
Finally, all materials were calcined at 550 C for 6 h. The sample with SiBeta contained 0.5, 1, 2, 5 and 7 wt % of Cr were labelled as Cr0.5SiBeta, Cr1.0SiBeta, Cr2.0SiBeta, Cr5.0SiBeta and Cr7.0SiBeta and this with AlBeta, containing 2 wt % of Cr was labelled as Cr2.0AlBeta.
2.2. Materials characterization
Textural properties of supports and catalysts were determined from the low-temperature adsorption/desorption isotherms using the Micromeritics (ASAP 2020). Priori to measurements the samples were degassed under vacuum at 350 C for 12 h. Total pore volume were measured for the value of p/p0 = 0,98 and the surface area of the samples were calculated from nitrogen isotherm data using BET and Langmuir models. The micropore volume was determined using the t- plot method.
Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis of supports and catalysts were performed on a Bruker D8 ADVANCE using Cu Kα radiation (λ = 154,05 pm) in 2θ range of 545.
Analysis of the acidic properties of samples was performed by ad- sorption of pyridine (Py) followed by infrared spectroscopy. Before analysis, the samples were pressed at 1 ton cm2 into thin wafers of ca. 10 mg cm2 and placed inside the IR cell. Then, the wafers were activated by calcination in static conditions at 723 K for 3 h in O2 (1.6·104 Pa) andoutgassed at 573 K (103 Pa) for 1 h. After the wafers were contacted at room temperature with gaseous Py (133 Pa). The IR spectra were recorded after desorption at room temperature and 423 K for 1 h with a Bruker Vector 22 spectrometer (resolution 2 cm1, 128 scans). The reported spectra were obtained after subtraction of the spectrum recorded before Py adsorption. 29Si MAS NMR spectra were recorded at 99.3 MHz with Bruker AVANCE 500 spectrometer and 7 mm zirconia rotors spinning at 5 kHz.
Tetramethylsilane was used as reference. 29Si MAS NMR spectra were recorded with a 4.2 μs excitation pulse and a 10 s recycle delay. 27Al and 1H MAS NMR experiments were performed using a 4 mm zirconia rotors spinning at 12 kHz. The resonance frequency of
500.16 MHz and 130.33 MHz were used for recording of 1H and 27Al,
respectively. An aqueous Al(NO3)3 1 N solution was used as second
