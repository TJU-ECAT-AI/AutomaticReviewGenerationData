1.The literature does not provide specific information on the primary challenges in current propylene production methods or how oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues. However, it does mention that the demand for propene is growing and that current sources, such as steam cracking and catalytic cracking, may not meet this demand without negatively impacting the production of other valuable co-products. The literature suggests that selective processes dedicated solely to propene synthesis, such as propane dehydrogenation, may gain significance. It also notes that oxidative dehydrogenation of propane in the presence of CO2 (CO2-PDH) is an attractive alternative to traditional propane dehydrogenation (PDH) due to its ability to remove thermodynamic limits and increase production through hydrogen binding in consecutive reactions. The use of CO2 as an oxidant in CO2-PDH is advantageous because it can potentially increase the conversion of propane and yield of propene compared to non-oxidative dehydrogenation, and it can be an attractive way for chemical CO2 utilisation.

1.文献没有提供关于当前丙烯生产方法的主要挑战或丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)如何解决这些问题的具体信息。然而,它确实提到丙烯的需求正在增长,而目前的来源,如蒸汽裂解和催化裂解,可能无法满足这一需求,而不对其他有价值的副产品的生产产生负面影响。文献建议,专门用于丙烯合成的精选过程,如丙烷脱氢,可能会变得越来越重要。它还指出,在CO2存在下丙烷的氧化脱氢(CO2-PDH)是传统丙烷脱氢(PDH)的一个有吸引力的替代方案,因为它能够消除热力学限制,并通过连续反应中的氢结合增加产量。在CO2-PDH中使用CO2作为氧化剂的优势在于,与非氧化脱氢相比,它可能增加丙烷的转化率和丙烯的产量,并且可以成为化学CO2利用的一种有吸引力的方式。
