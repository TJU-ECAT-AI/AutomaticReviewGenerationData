1.The literature does not provide specific information on the primary challenges in current propylene production methods, nor does it detail how oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues. However, it does mention that the demand for propene is growing and that current sources, such as steam cracking and catalytic cracking, may not meet future demand. The literature suggests that selective processes dedicated solely to propene synthesis, such as propane dehydrogenation, could gain significance. It also notes that the traditional propane dehydrogenation process has disadvantages such as reversibility and endothermicity, and that oxidative dehydrogenation using co-reactants like CO2 could potentially overcome these limitations by removing thermodynamic limits or increasing production through hydrogen binding in consecutive reactions. The use of oxygen in oxidative dehydrogenation is not discussed in detail, but it is mentioned that CO2-PDH can lead to higher per-pass conversion of propane and yield of propene compared to commercial non-oxidative dehydrogenation, and that CO2-PDH can be an attractive way for chemical CO2 utilisation.

1.文献没有提供当前丙烯生产方法的主要挑战的具体信息，也没有详细说明丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)如何解决这些问题。但是，它确实提到丙烯的需求正在增长，而目前的来源，如蒸汽裂解和催化裂解，可能无法满足未来的需求。文献建议，专门用于丙烯合成的精选过程，如丙烷脱氢，可能会变得越来越重要。它还指出，传统的丙烷脱氢过程有可逆性和吸热性的缺点，而使用CO2等共反应物的氧化脱氢可能通过去除热力学限制或通过连续反应中的氢结合增加产量，从而克服这些限制。关于在氧化脱氢中使用氧气的详细讨论没有提及，但提到CO2-PDH与商业非氧化脱氢相比，可以导致更高的丙烷转化率和丙烯产量，而且CO2-PDH可以成为化学利用CO2的一种有吸引力的方式。
