[1] "Steam cracking, Fluid Cat- alytic Cracking (FCC) and dehydrogenation (DH) are the primary methods to obtain olefins. Although these methods are commonly used to produce alkenes, they have some disadvantages: they are endothermic and suffer from the production of coke. In case of DH, alkane conversion is limited by thermodynamic constraints [15]."
[2] "An attractive alternative to this approach is the oxidative dehy- drogenation of propane (ODP) by molecular oxygen, which enables lower reaction temperatures and more effective inhibition of sur- face coke formation. The primary drawback of this process is a low propylene selectivity due to total oxidation of propane and propylene at high conversion. Thus there is an ongoing search for a selective catalyst in this process."

1. The primary challenges in current propylene production methods include endothermic reactions, coke production, and thermodynamic constraints limiting alkane conversion in dehydrogenation (DH). Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODP) addresses these issues by enabling lower reaction temperatures and more effective inhibition of surface coke formation. However, ODP presents its own set of advantages and limitations, particularly in the context of oxidant selection. Using oxygen as an oxidant in ODP allows for lower reaction temperatures and reduced coke formation, but it also results in low propylene selectivity due to the total oxidation of propane and propylene at high conversion rates. This highlights the need for a selective catalyst in the ODP process.

1. 当前丙烯生产方法的主要挑战包括吸热反应、焦炭生成以及脱氢(DH)过程中热力学约束限制了烷烃转化。丙烷氧化脱氢(ODP)通过分子氧解决了这些问题，它使反应温度降低，更有效地抑制了表面焦炭的形成。然而，ODP在氧化剂选择方面有其自身的一系列优势和局限性。在ODP中使用氧气作为氧化剂，虽然可以降低反应温度，减少焦炭的形成，但也会导致丙烯选择性降低，因为在高转化率下，丙烷和丙烯会被完全氧化。这突显了在ODP过程中需要一种选择性催化剂。
