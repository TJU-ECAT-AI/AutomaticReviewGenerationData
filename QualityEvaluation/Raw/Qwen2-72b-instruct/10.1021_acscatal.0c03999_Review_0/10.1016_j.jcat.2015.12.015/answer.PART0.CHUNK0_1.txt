[1] "Steam cracking, Fluid Cat- alytic Cracking (FCC) and dehydrogenation (DH) are the primary methods to obtain olefins. Although these methods are commonly used to produce alkenes, they have some disadvantages: they are endothermic and suffer from the production of coke. In case of DH, alkane conversion is limited by thermodynamic constraints [15]."
[2] "An attractive alternative to this approach is the oxidative dehy- drogenation of propane (ODP) by molecular oxygen, which enables lower reaction temperatures and more effective inhibition of sur- face coke formation. The primary drawback of this process is a low propylene selectivity due to total oxidation of propane and propylene at high conversion. Thus there is an ongoing search for a selective catalyst in this process."

1. The primary challenges in current propylene production methods include endothermic reactions, coke production, and thermodynamic constraints limiting alkane conversion in dehydrogenation (DH). Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODP) using molecular oxygen allows for lower reaction temperatures and better inhibition of surface coke formation. However, ODP presents its own limitations, such as low propylene selectivity due to the total oxidation of propane and propylene at high conversion rates. The selection of oxygen as an oxidant in ODP processes can lead to issues with selectivity and over-oxidation, necessitating the search for more selective catalysts.

1. 当前丙烯生产方法的主要挑战包括吸热反应、焦炭生成以及脱氢(DH)过程中热力学约束限制了烷烃的转化。使用分子氧的丙烷氧化脱氢(ODP)允许较低的反应温度和更好的表面焦炭抑制。然而，ODP也有其自身的局限性，例如由于在高转化率下丙烷和丙烯的完全氧化，导致丙烯选择性较低。在ODP过程中选择氧气作为氧化剂会导致选择性和过度氧化的问题，这需要寻找更具有选择性的催化剂。
