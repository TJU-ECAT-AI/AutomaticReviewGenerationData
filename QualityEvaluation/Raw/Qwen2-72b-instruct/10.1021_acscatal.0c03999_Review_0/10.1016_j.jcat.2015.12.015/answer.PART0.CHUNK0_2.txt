[1] "Steam cracking, Fluid Cat- alytic Cracking (FCC) and dehydrogenation (DH) are the primary methods to obtain olefins. Although these methods are commonly used to produce alkenes, they have some disadvantages: they are endothermic and suffer from the production of coke. In case of DH, alkane conversion is limited by thermodynamic constraints [15]."
[2] "An attractive alternative to this approach is the oxidative dehy- drogenation of propane (ODP) by molecular oxygen, which enables lower reaction temperatures and more effective inhibition of sur- face coke formation. The primary drawback of this process is a low propylene selectivity due to total oxidation of propane and propylene at high conversion. Thus there is an ongoing search for a selective catalyst in this process."

1. The primary challenges in current propylene production methods include endothermic reactions, coke production, and thermodynamic constraints limiting alkane conversion in dehydrogenation (DH). Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODP) using molecular oxygen allows for lower reaction temperatures and better inhibition of surface coke formation. However, ODP has a low propylene selectivity due to the total oxidation of propane and propylene at high conversion rates, leading to a search for more selective catalysts.

1. 当前丙烯生产方法的主要挑战包括吸热反应、焦炭生产以及脱氢(DH)过程中热力学约束限制了烷烃的转化。使用分子氧的丙烷氧化脱氢(ODP)允许较低的反应温度和更好的表面焦炭形成的抑制。然而，ODP由于在高转化率下丙烷和丙烯的完全氧化，导致丙烯选择性较低，因此正在寻找更选择性的催化剂。
