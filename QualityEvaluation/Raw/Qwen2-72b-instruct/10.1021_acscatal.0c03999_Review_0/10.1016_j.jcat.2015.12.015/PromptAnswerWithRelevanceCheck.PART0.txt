[1] "The demand for olefins, especially propylene, is expected to increase significantly in the near future. Steam cracking, Fluid Cat- alytic Cracking (FCC) and dehydrogenation (DH) are the primary methods to obtain olefins. Although these methods are commonly used to produce alkenes, they have some disadvantages: they are endothermic and suffer from the production of coke. In case of DH, alkane conversion is limited by thermodynamic constraints [15]."
[2] "An attractive alternative to this approach is the oxidative dehy- drogenation of propane (ODP) by molecular oxygen, which enables lower reaction temperatures and more effective inhibition of sur- face coke formation. The primary drawback of this process is a low propylene selectivity due to total oxidation of propane and propylene at high conversion. Thus there is an ongoing search for a selective catalyst in this process."

1.The primary challenges in current propylene production methods, such as steam cracking, Fluid Catalytic Cracking (FCC), and dehydrogenation (DH), include being endothermic processes and the production of coke. In the case of DH, alkane conversion is limited by thermodynamic constraints. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODP) using molecular oxygen addresses these issues by enabling lower reaction temperatures and more effective inhibition of surface coke formation. However, ODP presents its own set of advantages and limitations, particularly in the context of oxidant selection. Using oxygen as an oxidant in ODP results in a low propylene selectivity due to the total oxidation of propane and propylene at high conversion rates. This highlights the need for a selective catalyst in the ODP process.

1.当前丙烯生产方法的主要挑战，如蒸汽裂解、流化催化裂化（FCC）和脱氢（DH），包括它们是吸热过程，以及产生焦炭。在DH的情况下，烷烃的转化受到热力学约束的限制。使用分子氧进行丙烷氧化脱氢（ODP）通过实现较低的反应温度和更有效的抑制表面焦炭形成来解决这些问题。然而，ODP本身具有一系列优势和局限性，特别是在氧化剂选择的背景下。在ODP中使用氧气作为氧化剂导致丙烯选择性较低，因为在高转化率下，丙烷和丙烯会发生完全氧化。这突显了在ODP过程中需要一种选择性催化剂。

1. The primary challenges in current propylene production methods include endothermic reactions, coke production, and thermodynamic constraints limiting alkane conversion in dehydrogenation (DH). Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODP) using molecular oxygen allows for lower reaction temperatures and better inhibition of surface coke formation. However, ODP presents its own limitations, such as low propylene selectivity due to the total oxidation of propane and propylene at high conversion rates. The selection of oxygen as an oxidant in ODP processes can lead to issues with selectivity and over-oxidation, necessitating the search for more selective catalysts.
