Read the questions and answers provided below. First, critically assess the overall relevance of the answers provided to the set of questions asked.

If, upon your assessment, you find that the answers do not contain information that is relevant to the questions asked, stop your review process immediately and respond with a single sentence: "※※※※※※※The provided answers are not relevant to the questions.※※※※※※※". Do not provide any additional explanation or background information, only this sentence should be given as a response in case of irrelevant answers.

If, however, the answers are relevant to the questions asked, proceed to compile answers for each question according to the instructions below. Ensure to aggregate all the relevant answers from the multiple answer results provided in the document, and organize them sequentially by their order number, compiling the corresponding quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question.

If the provided answers' quotes are not differentiated by question, ensure to break them down and assign the quotes to each respective question, outputting them separately within each question's section.

To provide a comprehensive review, differentiate the responses into quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question based on the details given in the 'Answer' XML tags. Structure your review using the XML format showcased below if the answers are relevant to the questions asked:

[1] "The co-production of propylene from steam and fluidized crackers is anticipated to be insufficient to satisfy the rapidly growing demand1. Consequently, there is a need for the development of economic on-purpose production techniques to produce additional propylene."
[2] "The direct dehydrogenation of propane (DDP) is ther- modynamically limited and is highly endothermic (ΔHr = 29.70 kcal/mol), requiring temperatures that may exceed 973 K for sig- nificant propylene yields2."
[3] "In principle, the introduction of CO2 as a mild oxidant into the feed alters the dehydrogenation pathway by oxidizing the abstracted hydrogen from the alkane and conse- quently releasing the heat of reaction that reduces operating temperatures2,3."
[4] "The presence of CO2 can also increase the equili- brium conversion of propane by consuming H2 through the reverse water gas shift reaction (RWGS), as seen in the thermo- dynamic calculations in Fig. 1a."
[5] "Additionally, unlike regular oxi- dative dehydrogenation with molecular oxygen, CO2 as a mild oxidant suppresses over-oxidation and thus minimizes the pro- duction of carbon oxides."

1.当前的丙烯生产方法，主要依赖于蒸汽和流化裂解，预计无法满足迅速增长的需求。这需要开发经济的、有针对性的生产技术来生产额外的丙烯。丙烷直接脱氢（DDP）在热力学上受到限制，且高度吸热（ΔHr = 29.70 kcal/mol），为了获得显著的丙烯产量，可能需要超过973 K的温度。原则上，将二氧化碳作为温和的氧化剂引入原料中，通过氧化从烷烃中提取的氢，从而释放反应热，降低了操作温度。二氧化碳的存在还可以通过消耗H2通过逆向水煤气变换反应（RWGS）增加丙烷的平衡转化率。此外，与使用分子氧的常规氧化脱氢不同，二氧化碳作为温和的氧化剂抑制了过度氧化，从而最小化了碳氧化物的产生。
