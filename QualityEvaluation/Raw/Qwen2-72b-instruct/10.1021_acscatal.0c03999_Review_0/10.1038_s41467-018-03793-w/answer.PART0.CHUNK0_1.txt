[1] "The co-production of propylene from steam and fluidized crackers is anticipated to be insufficient to satisfy the rapidly growing demand1. Consequently, there is a need for the development of economic on-purpose production techniques to produce additional propylene."
[2] "The direct dehydrogenation of propane (DDP) is ther- modynamically limited and is highly endothermic (ΔHr = 29.70 kcal/mol), requiring temperatures that may exceed 973 K for sig- nificant propylene yields2."

1.Current propylene production methods, primarily through steam and fluidized crackers, are expected to be insufficient to meet the rapidly growing demand for propylene. This necessitates the development of more economic and purposeful production techniques. Direct dehydrogenation of propane (DDP) is thermodynamically limited and highly endothermic, requiring temperatures that may exceed 973 K for significant propylene yields. The introduction of CO2 as a mild oxidant in the feedstock can alter the dehydrogenation pathway by oxidizing the abstracted hydrogen from the alkane, releasing the heat of reaction and reducing operating temperatures. CO2 can also increase the equilibrium conversion of propane by consuming H2 through the reverse water gas shift reaction (RWGS). Unlike regular oxidative dehydrogenation with molecular oxygen, CO2 as a mild oxidant suppresses over-oxidation and minimizes the production of carbon oxides.

1.当前丙烯生产方法，主要通过蒸汽和流化裂解，预计无法满足丙烯需求的快速增长。这需要开发更经济、更有目的性的生产技术。丙烷直接脱氢（DDP）在热力学上受到限制，且高度吸热，为了获得显著的丙烯产量，可能需要超过973 K的温度。在原料中引入二氧化碳作为温和的氧化剂，可以改变脱氢途径，通过氧化从烷烃中提取的氢，释放反应的热量，从而降低操作温度。二氧化碳还可以通过消耗H2的逆向水煤气变换反应（RWGS）增加丙烷的平衡转化率。与使用氧气的常规氧化脱氢不同，二氧化碳作为温和的氧化剂可以抑制过度氧化，从而最小化碳氧化物的产生。
