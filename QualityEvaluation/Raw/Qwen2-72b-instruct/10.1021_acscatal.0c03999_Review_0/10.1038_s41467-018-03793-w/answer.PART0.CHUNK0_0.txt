1.Current propylene production methods, primarily relying on steam and fluidized crackers, are anticipated to be insufficient to meet the rapidly growing demand. This necessitates the development of economic on-purpose production techniques to produce additional propylene. Direct dehydrogenation of propane (DDP) is thermodynamically limited and highly endothermic, requiring temperatures that may exceed 973 K for significant propylene yields. The introduction of CO2 as a mild oxidant into the feed alters the dehydrogenation pathway by oxidizing the abstracted hydrogen from the alkane, releasing the heat of reaction that reduces operating temperatures. The presence of CO2 can also increase the equilibrium conversion of propane by consuming H2 through the reverse water gas shift reaction (RWGS). Unlike regular oxidative dehydrogenation with molecular oxygen, CO2 as a mild oxidant suppresses over-oxidation and minimizes the production of carbon oxides.

1.当前的丙烯生产方法，主要依赖于蒸汽和流化裂解，预计无法满足迅速增长的需求。这需要开发经济的、有针对性的生产技术来生产额外的丙烯。丙烷直接脱氢（DDP）在热力学上受到限制，且高度吸热（ΔHr = 29.70 kcal/mol），为了获得显著的丙烯产量，可能需要超过973 K的温度。原则上，将二氧化碳作为温和的氧化剂引入原料中，通过氧化从烷烃中提取的氢，从而释放反应热，降低了操作温度。二氧化碳的存在还可以通过消耗H2通过逆向水煤气变换反应（RWGS）增加丙烷的平衡转化率。此外，与使用分子氧的常规氧化脱氢不同，二氧化碳作为温和的氧化剂抑制了过度氧化，从而最小化了碳氧化物的产生。
