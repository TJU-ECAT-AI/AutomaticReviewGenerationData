[1] "Most of the current propylene production is performed by steam cracking (SC) and fluidic catalytic cracking (FCC).1 However, in both the SC and FCC processes, propylene is produced as a by-product and the selectivity and yields are always low.2"
[2] "Theoretically, introducing an oxidant can drive the reaction to be more thermodynamically favorable. However, the highest propylene yield reported for propane oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) is only about 30%, owing mainly to the consecutive oxidation of propylene to oxygenated products.2,5"
[3] "Although many different catalysts, promoters and alternative oxidants have been studied,2,5,6 a commercially viable breakthrough has yet to be achieved."

1.Current propylene production methods, primarily steam cracking (SC) and fluidic catalytic cracking (FCC), have low selectivity and yields for propylene as it is produced as a by-product. The introduction of an oxidant in propane oxidative dehydrogenation (ODHP) can theoretically make the reaction more thermodynamically favorable, but the highest reported propylene yield is only about 30% due to the consecutive oxidation of propylene to oxygenated products. Despite extensive research on catalysts, promoters, and alternative oxidants, a commercially viable breakthrough in ODHP has not yet been achieved.

1.当前的丙烯生产方法，主要是蒸汽裂解（SC）和流体催化裂解（FCC），由于丙烯是副产品，其选择性和产量总是很低。理论上，在丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）中引入氧化剂可以使反应在热力学上更有利，但由于丙烯连续氧化为含氧产物，报告的最高丙烯产量仅为30%左右。尽管对催化剂、促进剂和替代氧化剂进行了大量研究，但在ODHP中尚未实现商业上可行的突破。
