1.The primary challenges in current propylene production methods, such as steam cracking (SC) and fluidic catalytic cracking (FCC), are the low selectivity and yields for propylene, as it is produced as a by-product. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) can potentially address these issues by driving the reaction to be more thermodynamically favorable. However, ODHP presents its own set of limitations, particularly in the context of oxidant selection. The highest reported yield for propylene from propane oxidative dehydrogenation is only about 30%, mainly due to the consecutive oxidation of propylene to oxygenated products. Despite extensive research on different catalysts, promoters, and alternative oxidants, a commercially viable breakthrough in ODHP has yet to be achieved.

1.当前丙烯生产方法的主要挑战，如蒸汽裂解（SC）和流体催化裂解（FCC），是丙烯的低选择性和产量，因为它是副产品。丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）可以通过推动反应更有利于热力学来潜在地解决这些问题。然而，ODHP在氧化剂选择方面有其自身的局限性。从丙烷氧化脱氢得到的丙烯最高报告产量仅为30%左右，主要是由于丙烯连续氧化为含氧化合物。尽管对不同的催化剂、促进剂和替代氧化剂进行了广泛的研究，但在ODHP方面尚未实现商业上可行的突破。
