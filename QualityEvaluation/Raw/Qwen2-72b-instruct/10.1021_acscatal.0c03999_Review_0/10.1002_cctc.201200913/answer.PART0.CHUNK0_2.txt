1.The primary challenges in current propylene production methods, which are mainly steam cracking (SC) and fluidic catalytic cracking (FCC), are low selectivity and yields, as propylene is produced as a by-product. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) can theoretically drive the reaction to be more thermodynamically favorable by introducing an oxidant. However, the highest propylene yield reported for propane oxidative dehydrogenation is only about 30%, mainly due to the consecutive oxidation of propylene to oxygenated products. Despite extensive research on different catalysts, promoters, and alternative oxidants, a commercially viable breakthrough in ODHP has yet to be achieved.

1.当前丙烯生产的主要方法，即蒸汽裂解（SC）和流化催化裂化（FCC），的主要挑战是选择性和产量低，因为丙烯是副产品。理论上，通过引入氧化剂，丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）可以使反应更有利于热力学。然而，丙烷氧化脱氢的最高丙烯产量报告仅为30%左右，主要是由于丙烯连续氧化为含氧化合物。尽管对不同的催化剂、促进剂和替代氧化剂进行了广泛的研究，但在ODHP中尚未实现商业上可行的突破。
