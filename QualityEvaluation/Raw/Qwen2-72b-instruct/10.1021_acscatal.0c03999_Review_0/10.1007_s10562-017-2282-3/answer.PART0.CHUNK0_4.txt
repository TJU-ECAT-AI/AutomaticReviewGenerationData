[1] "On the other hand, oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) provides a favorable alternative due to its low energy requirement, no catalyst regeneration obligation, and the elimination of thermodynamic limitations [4, 5]. However, the presence of O2 in the ODH process may lead to the process flammability and the production of carbon oxides due to over-oxidation resulting in poor process selectivity [6, 7]. This problem can be solved by employing a much safer, milder, and readily available carbon dioxide as a soft oxidant."

1.Oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of propane offers several advantages over traditional propylene production methods, including lower energy requirements, no need for catalyst regeneration, and the elimination of thermodynamic limitations. However, the use of oxygen as an oxidant in ODH can lead to process flammability and the production of carbon oxides due to over-oxidation, resulting in poor selectivity. Using carbon dioxide as a soft oxidant addresses these issues by providing a safer, milder, and more readily available alternative.

1.丙烷的氧化脱氢(ODH)与传统的丙烯生产方法相比,具有较低的能量需求、无需催化剂再生以及消除热力学限制等优势。然而,在ODH中使用氧气作为氧化剂可能导致过程易燃性,并由于过度氧化产生碳氧化物,导致选择性差。使用二氧化碳作为软氧化剂解决了这些问题,提供了一个更安全、更温和、更易获得的替代方案。
