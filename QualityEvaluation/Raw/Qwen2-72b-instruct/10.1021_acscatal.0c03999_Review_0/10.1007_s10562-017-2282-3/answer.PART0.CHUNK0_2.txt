[1] "Propylene is one of the most important feed stocks in the chemical and petrochemical industries. It is a versatile starting material for synthesis of numerous commodity chemicals ranging from small molecules (isopropanol, acrylonitrile, acrylic acid, propylene oxide, butyraldehyde, and cumene) to very complex molecules (polypropylene, plastics, and paints). It is produced mostly by steam cracking and propane dehydrogenation [1,2,3]. On the other hand, oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) provides a favorable alternative due to its low energy requirement, no catalyst regeneration obligation, and the elimination of thermodynamic limitations [4, 5]. However, the presence of O2 in the ODH process may lead to the process flammability and the production of carbon oxides due to over-oxidation resulting in poor process selectivity [6, 7]. This problem can be solved by employing a much safer, milder, and readily available carbon dioxide as a soft oxidant."

1.The primary challenges in current propylene production methods, such as steam cracking and propane dehydrogenation, include high energy requirements, the need for catalyst regeneration, and thermodynamic limitations. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by requiring less energy, not needing catalyst regeneration, and overcoming thermodynamic limitations. However, the use of oxygen as an oxidant in ODHP can lead to process flammability and the production of carbon oxides due to over-oxidation, resulting in poor process selectivity. Carbon dioxide, as a soft oxidant, is safer, milder, and more readily available, and its use can solve the problems associated with oxygen.

1.当前丙烯生产方法的主要挑战，如蒸汽裂解和丙烷脱氢，包括高能耗、需要催化剂再生和热力学限制。丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)通过降低能耗、不需要催化剂再生和克服热力学限制来解决这些问题。然而，ODHP中使用氧气作为氧化剂会导致工艺易燃和由于过度氧化产生碳氧化物，导致工艺选择性差。二氧化碳作为一种温和的氧化剂，更安全、更温和、更易获得，其使用可以解决与氧气相关的问题。
