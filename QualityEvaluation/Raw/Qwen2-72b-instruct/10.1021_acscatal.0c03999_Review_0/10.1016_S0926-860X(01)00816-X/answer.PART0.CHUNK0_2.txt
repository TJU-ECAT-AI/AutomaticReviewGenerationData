[1] "Propane oxydehydrogenation combining high propane conversion and high propylene selectivity has proved an elusive goal, and propane oxydehydrogenation as a route to propylene appears to be far from realizing its commercialization potential."
[2] "One difficulty is that propylene is more easily oxidized than is propane, so that selectivity tends to decline rapidly with conversion."
[3] "Another is that at temperatures above about 700 C, propane cracking becomes significant, and a variety of products other than propylene are produced."
[4] "Efforts to increase propylene selectivity have centered in the areas of more selective catalysts at temperatures below 700 C, more selective catalysts and conditions at high temperatures, membrane reactors, and cyclic-operation reactors."

1.The primary challenges in current propylene production methods include the difficulty in achieving both high propane conversion and high propylene selectivity simultaneously. Propane oxydehydrogenation, as a route to propylene, has not yet reached its commercial potential. Propylene is more susceptible to oxidation than propane, leading to a rapid decline in selectivity as conversion increases. At temperatures above 700 degrees Celsius, propane cracking becomes significant, resulting in the production of various products other than propylene. Efforts to improve propylene selectivity have focused on developing more selective catalysts at lower temperatures, optimizing catalysts and conditions at higher temperatures, utilizing membrane reactors, and employing cyclic-operation reactors.

1.当前丙烯生产方法的主要挑战包括难以同时实现高丙烷转化率和高丙烯选择性。作为生产丙烯的途径，丙烷氧化脱氢尚未实现其商业化潜力。丙烯比丙烷更容易氧化，导致随着转化率的增加，选择性迅速下降。在700摄氏度以上的温度下，丙烷裂解变得显著，导致产生各种除丙烯以外的产品。提高丙烯选择性的努力集中在开发在较低温度下更具选择性的催化剂，优化在较高温度下的催化剂和条件，利用膜反应器，以及采用循环操作反应器。
