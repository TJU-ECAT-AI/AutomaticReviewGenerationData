[1] "Propane oxydehydrogenation combining high propane conversion and high propylene selectivity has proved an elusive goal, and propane oxydehydrogenation as a route to propylene appears to be far from realizing its commercialization potential. One difficulty is that propylene is more easily oxidized than is propane, so that selectivity tends to decline rapidly with conversion. Another is that at temperatures above about 700 C, propane cracking becomes significant, and a variety of products other than propylene are produced."

1.The primary challenges in current propylene production methods include the difficulty in achieving both high propane conversion and high propylene selectivity in propane oxydehydrogenation. Propylene is more prone to oxidation than propane, leading to a rapid decline in selectivity as conversion increases. Additionally, at temperatures above 700°C, propane cracking becomes significant, resulting in the production of various products other than propylene. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by potentially offering higher conversion and selectivity, but it presents its own set of challenges, particularly in the context of oxidant selection. Using oxygen as an oxidant can lead to safety concerns and process upsets, as well as the potential for dangerous mixtures of propane and oxidant. The use of carbon dioxide as an oxidant has been investigated as a potential way to reduce these negative impacts and achieve higher selectivity.

1.当前丙烯生产方法的主要挑战包括在丙烷氧化脱氢中难以同时实现高丙烷转化率和高丙烯选择性。丙烯比丙烷更容易氧化，导致随着转化率的增加，选择性迅速下降。此外，在700°C以上的温度下，丙烷裂解变得显著，导致产生各种丙烯以外的产品。丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)通过潜在地提供更高的转化率和选择性来解决这些问题，但它在氧化剂选择方面提出了自己的挑战集。使用氧气作为氧化剂可能导致安全问题和工艺中断，以及潜在的危险的丙烷和氧化剂混合物。已经研究了使用二氧化碳作为氧化剂，作为一种潜在的方法来减少这些负面影响并实现更高的选择性。
