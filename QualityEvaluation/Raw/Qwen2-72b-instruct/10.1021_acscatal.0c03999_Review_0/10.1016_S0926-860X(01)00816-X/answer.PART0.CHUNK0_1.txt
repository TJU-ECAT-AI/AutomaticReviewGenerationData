[1] "Propane oxydehydrogenation combining high propane conversion and high propylene selectivity has proved an elusive goal, and propane oxydehydrogenation as a route to propylene appears to be far from realizing its commercialization potential. One difficulty is that propylene is more easily oxidized than is propane, so that selectivity tends to decline rapidly with conversion. Another is that at temperatures above about 700 C, propane cracking becomes significant, and a variety of products other than propylene are produced."

1.The primary challenges in current propylene production methods include the difficulty in achieving both high propane conversion and high propylene selectivity simultaneously. Propane oxydehydrogenation (ODHP) addresses these issues by potentially offering higher conversion levels and selectivity to propylene compared to traditional dehydrogenation methods. However, ODHP presents its own set of challenges, particularly in maintaining selectivity as conversion increases, due to the higher reactivity of propylene compared to propane. Additionally, at higher temperatures, propane cracking becomes more significant, leading to the production of various by-products other than propylene. The selection of oxidant is also a critical factor, with oxygen presenting safety concerns and process upsets that need to be addressed.

1.当前丙烯生产方法的主要挑战包括难以同时实现高丙烷转化率和高丙烯选择性。丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)通过可能提供比传统脱氢方法更高的转化率和丙烯选择性来解决这些问题。然而，ODHP本身也存在一系列挑战，特别是在转化率增加时保持选择性，因为丙烯的反应性比丙烷更高。此外，在较高温度下，丙烷裂解变得更加显著，导致产生各种副产品，而不仅仅是丙烯。氧化剂的选择也是一个关键因素，氧气存在安全问题和需要解决的工艺事故。
