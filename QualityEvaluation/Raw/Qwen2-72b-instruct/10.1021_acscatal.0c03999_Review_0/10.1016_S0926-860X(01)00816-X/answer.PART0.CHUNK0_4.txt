[1] "Propane oxydehydrogenation combining high propane conversion and high propylene selectivity has proved an elusive goal, and propane oxydehydrogenation as a route to propylene appears to be far from realizing its commercialization potential."
[2] "One difficulty is that propylene is more easily oxidized than is propane, so that selectivity tends to decline rapidly with conversion."
[3] "Another is that at temperatures above about 700 C, propane cracking becomes significant, and a variety of products other than propylene are produced."
[4] "Efforts to increase propylene selectivity have centered in the areas of more selective catalysts at temperatures below 700 C, more selective catalysts and conditions at high temperatures, membrane reactors, and cyclic-operation reactors."

1.The primary challenges in current propylene production methods include the difficulty in achieving both high propane conversion and high propylene selectivity simultaneously. Propylene is more susceptible to oxidation than propane, leading to a rapid decline in selectivity as conversion increases. At temperatures above 700 degrees Celsius, propane cracking becomes significant, resulting in the production of various products other than propylene. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by offering a potential route to propylene production with higher selectivity at lower temperatures. However, it presents its own set of challenges, particularly in the selection of an appropriate oxidant. Oxygen is a highly reactive oxidant that can lead to undesirable partial or total oxidation to carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide. The use of oxygen requires careful control of the reaction conditions to prevent the formation of these byproducts. The development of highly active and selective catalysts for ODHP is crucial to overcome these challenges and achieve efficient and selective conversion of propane to propylene.

1.当前丙烯生产方法的主要挑战包括难以同时实现高丙烷转化率和高丙烯选择性。丙烯比丙烷更容易氧化，导致随着转化率的增加，选择性迅速下降。在700摄氏度以上的温度下，丙烷裂解变得显著，导致产生除丙烯以外的各种产品。丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)通过提供在较低温度下具有更高选择性的丙烯生产途径来解决这些问题。然而，它也带来了一系列挑战，特别是在选择合适的氧化剂方面。氧气是一种高度反应性的氧化剂，可能导致不希望的碳氧化物和二氧化碳的部分或完全氧化。使用氧气需要仔细控制反应条件，以防止这些副产品的形成。开发高效且选择性的ODHP催化剂对于克服这些挑战并实现丙烷到丙烯的有效和选择性转化至关重要。
