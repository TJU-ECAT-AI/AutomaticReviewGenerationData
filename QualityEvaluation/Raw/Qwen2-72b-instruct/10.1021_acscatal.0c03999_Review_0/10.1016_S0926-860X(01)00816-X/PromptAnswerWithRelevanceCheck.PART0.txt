[1] "Propane oxydehydrogenation combining high propane conversion and high propylene selectivity has proved an elusive goal, and propane oxydehydrogenation as a route to propylene appears to be far from realizing its commercialization potential. One difficulty is that propylene is more easily oxidized than is propane, so that selectivity tends to decline rapidly with conversion. Another is that at temperatures above about 700 C, propane cracking becomes significant, and a variety of products other than propylene are produced."

1.The primary challenges in current propylene production methods include the difficulty in achieving both high propane conversion and high propylene selectivity in propane oxydehydrogenation. Propylene is more prone to oxidation than propane, leading to a rapid decline in selectivity as conversion increases. Additionally, at temperatures above 700°C, propane cracking becomes significant, resulting in the production of various products other than propylene. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by potentially offering higher conversion and selectivity, but it presents its own set of challenges, particularly in the context of oxidant selection. Using oxygen as an oxidant can lead to safety concerns and process upsets, as well as the potential for dangerous mixtures of propane and oxidant. The use of carbon dioxide as an oxidant has been investigated as a potential way to reduce these negative impacts and achieve higher selectivity.

1.当前丙烯生产方法的主要挑战包括在丙烷氧化脱氢中难以同时实现高丙烷转化率和高丙烯选择性。丙烯比丙烷更容易氧化，导致随着转化率的增加，选择性迅速下降。此外，在700°C以上的温度下，丙烷裂解变得显著，导致产生各种丙烯以外的产品。丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)通过潜在地提供更高的转化率和选择性来解决这些问题，但它在氧化剂选择方面提出了自己的挑战集。使用氧气作为氧化剂可能导致安全问题和工艺中断，以及潜在的危险的丙烷和氧化剂混合物。已经研究了使用二氧化碳作为氧化剂，作为一种潜在的方法来减少这些负面影响并实现更高的选择性。

1.The primary challenges in current propylene production methods include the difficulty in achieving both high propane conversion and high propylene selectivity simultaneously. Propane oxydehydrogenation (ODHP) addresses these issues by potentially offering higher conversion levels and selectivity to propylene compared to traditional dehydrogenation methods. However, ODHP presents its own set of challenges, particularly in maintaining selectivity as conversion increases, due to the higher reactivity of propylene compared to propane. Additionally, at higher temperatures, propane cracking becomes more significant, leading to the production of various by-products other than propylene. The selection of oxidant is also a critical factor, with oxygen presenting safety concerns and process upsets that need to be addressed.

1.当前丙烯生产方法的主要挑战包括难以同时实现高丙烷转化率和高丙烯选择性。丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)通过可能提供比传统脱氢方法更高的转化率和丙烯选择性来解决这些问题。然而，ODHP本身也存在一系列挑战，特别是在转化率增加时保持选择性，因为丙烯的反应性比丙烷更高。此外，在较高温度下，丙烷裂解变得更加显著，导致产生各种副产品，而不仅仅是丙烯。氧化剂的选择也是一个关键因素，氧气存在安全问题和需要解决的工艺事故。

1.The primary challenges in current propylene production methods include the difficulty in achieving both high propane conversion and high propylene selectivity simultaneously. Propane oxydehydrogenation, as a route to propylene, has not yet reached its commercial potential. Propylene is more susceptible to oxidation than propane, leading to a rapid decline in selectivity as conversion increases. At temperatures above 700 degrees Celsius, propane cracking becomes significant, resulting in the production of various products other than propylene. Efforts to improve propylene selectivity have focused on developing more selective catalysts at lower temperatures, optimizing catalysts and conditions at higher temperatures, utilizing membrane reactors, and employing cyclic-operation reactors.

At temperatures above 700 degrees Celsius, propane cracking becomes significant, resulting in the production of various products other than propylene. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by offering a potential route to propylene production with higher selectivity at lower temperatures. However, it presents its own set of challenges, particularly in the selection of an appropriate oxidant. Oxygen is a highly reactive oxidant that can lead to undesirable partial or total oxidation to carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide. The use of oxygen requires careful control of the reaction conditions to prevent the formation of these byproducts. The development of highly active and selective catalysts for ODHP is crucial to overcome these challenges and achieve efficient and selective conversion of propane to propylene.
