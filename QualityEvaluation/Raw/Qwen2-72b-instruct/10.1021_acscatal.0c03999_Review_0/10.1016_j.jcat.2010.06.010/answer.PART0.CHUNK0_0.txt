1.The primary challenges in current propylene production methods, such as steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking, include high energy consumption, significant greenhouse gas emissions, and the production of a wide range of co-products, which can dilute the efficiency of propylene production. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by offering a more direct route to propylene production with potentially lower energy requirements and fewer co-products. However, ODHP presents its own set of advantages and limitations, particularly in the context of oxidant selection. Using oxygen as an oxidant in ODHP can lead to higher propylene yields due to the direct conversion of propane to propylene and carbon dioxide. However, the use of oxygen also presents challenges, such as the risk of deep oxidation to carbon dioxide and the need for oxygen separation from air, which can be energy-intensive. The selection of oxygen as an oxidant must balance the advantages of higher propylene yields with the limitations of potential over-oxidation and the energy costs associated with oxygen production.

1.当前丙烯生产方法的主要挑战，如蒸汽裂解和流化催化裂解，包括高能耗、大量温室气体排放以及产生大量副产品，这会降低丙烯生产的效率。丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)通过提供一条更直接的丙烯生产途径，可能具有较低的能源需求和较少的副产品，从而解决了这些问题。然而，ODHP在氧化剂选择方面有其自身的一系列优势和局限性。在ODHP中使用氧气作为氧化剂，由于直接将丙烷转化为丙烯和二氧化碳，可以导致更高的丙烯产量。然而，使用氧气也带来了挑战，如深氧化至二氧化碳的风险以及需要从空气中分离氧气，这可能是能源密集型的。选择氧气作为氧化剂必须在更高的丙烯产量优势与潜在的过度氧化局限性和与氧气生产相关的能源成本之间取得平衡。
