1.The primary challenges in current propylene production methods, such as steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking, include high energy consumption, significant greenhouse gas emissions, and the production of a wide range of co-products, which can dilute the efficiency of propylene production. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by offering a more direct route to propylene production with potentially lower energy requirements and fewer co-products. However, ODHP presents its own set of advantages and limitations, particularly in the context of oxidant selection. Using oxygen as an oxidant in ODHP can lead to higher propylene yields due to the direct conversion of propane to propylene and carbon dioxide. However, the use of oxygen also presents challenges, such as the risk of deep oxidation to carbon dioxide and the need for oxygen separation from air, which can be energy-intensive. The selection of oxygen as an oxidant must balance the advantages of higher propylene yields with the limitations of potential over-oxidation and the energy costs associated with oxygen production.

1.当前丙烯生产方法的主要挑战，如蒸汽裂解和流化催化裂解，包括高能耗、大量温室气体排放以及产生大量副产品，这会降低丙烯生产的效率。丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)通过提供一条更直接的丙烯生产途径，可能具有较低的能源需求和较少的副产品，从而解决了这些问题。然而，ODHP在氧化剂选择方面有其自身的一系列优势和局限性。在ODHP中使用氧气作为氧化剂，由于直接将丙烷转化为丙烯和二氧化碳，可以导致更高的丙烯产量。然而，使用氧气也带来了挑战，如深氧化至二氧化碳的风险以及需要从空气中分离氧气，这可能是能源密集型的。选择氧气作为氧化剂必须在更高的丙烯产量优势与潜在的过度氧化局限性和与氧气生产相关的能源成本之间取得平衡。

In contrast, using nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant can improve propene selectivity and reduce the risk of deep oxidation, but it may result in lower activity due to slower reoxidation of the catalyst.

1.当前丙烯生产方法的主要挑战，如蒸汽裂解和流化催化裂化，包括高能耗、大量温室气体排放以及产生一系列副产品，这会稀释丙烯的产量。丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)通过提供一条直接的丙烯生产途径，可能具有较低的能源需求和排放，从而解决了这些问题。然而，ODHP本身具有一系列优势和局限性，特别是在氧化剂选择的背景下。在ODHP中使用氧气作为氧化剂可以导致更高的丙烯产量，因为丙烷可以直接转化为丙烯和二氧化碳。然而，使用氧气也带来了挑战，如深氧化至二氧化碳的风险以及从空气中分离氧气的需要，这可能是能源密集型的。相比之下，使用一氧化二氮(N2O)作为氧化剂可以提高丙烯的选择性，降低深度氧化的风险，但可能会导致活性降低，因为催化剂的再氧化速度较慢。

1.The primary challenges in current propylene production methods, such as steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking, include high energy consumption, significant greenhouse gas emissions, and the requirement for large-scale infrastructure. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by offering a more energy-efficient and potentially cleaner alternative. However, ODHP presents its own set of advantages and limitations, particularly in the context of oxidant selection. Using oxygen as an oxidant in ODHP can lead to higher propylene yields due to its higher reactivity compared to other oxidants. However, oxygen also poses challenges, such as the risk of deep oxidation, resulting in the formation of carbon dioxide and water instead of the desired propylene. Oxygen's high reactivity can also lead to the rapid deactivation of catalysts, necessitating the development of robust and selective catalysts. The selection of the oxidant is crucial in ODHP, as it significantly influences the reaction pathway, product selectivity, and catalyst stability. Nitrous oxide (N2O) has been shown to be a promising alternative oxidant, offering higher propylene selectivity and lower catalyst deactivation rates compared to oxygen. However, the use of N2O also presents its own challenges, such as higher production costs and potential environmental concerns due to its greenhouse gas properties.

1.当前丙烯生产方法的主要挑战，如蒸汽裂解和流化催化裂解，包括高能耗、大量温室气体排放和对大规模基础设施的需求。丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)通过提供更节能和潜在更清洁的替代方案，解决了这些问题。然而，ODHP在氧化剂选择的背景下，有其自身的一系列优势和局限性。在ODHP中使用氧气作为氧化剂，由于其与其它氧化剂相比更高的反应性，可以导致更高的丙烯产量。然而，氧气也带来了挑战，如深度氧化的风险，导致二氧化碳和水的形成，而不是所需的丙烯。氧气的高反应性也可能导致催化剂的快速失活，需要开发稳健和选择性的催化剂。氧化剂的选择在ODHP中是至关重要的，因为它显著影响反应途径、产品选择性和催化剂稳定性。一氧化二氮(N2O)已被证明是一种有前景的替代氧化剂，与氧气相比，它提供了更高的丙烯选择性和更低的催化剂失活率。然而，使用N2O也带来了自身的挑战，如更高的生产成本和由于其温室气体性质而可能产生的环境问题。
