1.The primary challenges in current propylene production methods, such as steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking, include high energy consumption, complex processes, and the production of by-products. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by offering a more energy-efficient and direct route to propylene. However, ODHP presents its own set of advantages and limitations, particularly in the context of oxidant selection. The use of oxygen as an oxidant in ODHP can lead to deep oxidation reactions, resulting in the formation of CO and CO2, which reduces the selectivity to propylene. Oxygen also poses safety concerns due to its reactivity with hydrocarbons, necessitating the use of diluents and careful control of reaction conditions. The specific challenges associated with using oxygen include the need for oxygen separation from air, which increases the cost of the process, and the risk of side reactions that can lead to the formation of undesired products.

1.当前丙烯生产方法的主要挑战，如蒸汽裂解和流化催化裂解，包括高能耗、复杂工艺和副产品的产生。丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)通过提供更节能和直接的丙烯路线来解决这些问题。然而，ODHP在氧化剂选择的背景下有其自身的一系列优势和局限性。在ODHP中使用氧气作为氧化剂会导致深度氧化反应，导致CO和CO2的形成，从而降低丙烯的选择性。氧气还会因与碳氢化合物的反应而带来安全问题，需要使用稀释剂和仔细控制反应条件。使用氧气的具体挑战包括从空气中分离氧气，这会增加过程成本，以及可能导致不期望产物形成的副反应的风险。
