1.The primary challenges in current propylene production methods, such as steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking, include high energy consumption, complex processes, and the production of by-products. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by offering a more energy-efficient and direct route to propylene. However, ODHP presents its own set of advantages and limitations, particularly in the context of oxidant selection. Using oxygen as an oxidant in ODHP can lead to deep oxidation reactions, resulting in the formation of CO and CO2, which reduces the selectivity to propylene. Oxygen also poses safety concerns due to its reactivity with hydrocarbons, necessitating the use of diluents and careful control of reaction conditions to prevent runaway reactions and ensure process safety.

1.当前丙烯生产方法的主要挑战包括能耗高、工艺复杂和产生副产品。丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)通过提供更节能和直接的丙烯生产途径来解决这些问题。然而,ODHP在氧化剂选择方面有其自身的一系列优势和局限性。在ODHP中使用氧气作为氧化剂会导致深度氧化反应,产生CO和CO2,从而降低丙烯的选择性。氧气还由于其与碳氢化合物的反应性而带来安全问题,需要使用稀释剂并仔细控制反应条件,以防止失控反应并确保过程安全。
