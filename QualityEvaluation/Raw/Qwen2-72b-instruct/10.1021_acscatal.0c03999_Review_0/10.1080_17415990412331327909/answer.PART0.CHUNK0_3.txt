1.The primary challenges in current propylene production methods, such as cracking and dehydrogenation, include high energy consumption, significant carbon dioxide emissions, and the formation of coke, which can lead to catalyst deactivation. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by operating at lower temperatures, which reduces energy consumption and carbon dioxide emissions. Additionally, the presence of oxygen inhibits coke formation, extending catalyst life. However, ODHP presents its own set of advantages and limitations, particularly in the context of oxidant selection. Oxygen is a highly effective oxidant for ODHP, promoting high propylene yields. However, the use of oxygen also presents challenges, including the risk of explosive mixtures and the potential for over-oxidation, leading to the formation of carbon oxides. The introduction of H2S in the feed mixture has been shown to enhance the selectivity for propylene, likely by modifying the reaction pathway and suppressing over-oxidation.

1.当前丙烯生产方法的主要挑战，如裂解和脱氢，包括高能耗、大量二氧化碳排放以及焦炭的形成，后者可能导致催化剂失活。丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)通过在较低温度下运行，减少了能耗和二氧化碳排放，从而解决了这些问题。此外，氧气的存在抑制了焦炭的形成，延长了催化剂的寿命。然而，ODHP在氧化剂选择方面有其自身的一系列优势和局限性。氧气是ODHP的有效氧化剂，可以促进高丙烯产量。然而，氧气的使用也带来了挑战，包括爆炸混合物的风险和过度氧化的可能，导致碳氧化物的形成。在进料混合物中引入H2S已被证明可以提高丙烯的选择性，这可能是通过改变反应途径和抑制过度氧化来实现的。
