1.The primary challenges in current propylene production methods, such as cracking and dehydrogenation, include high energy consumption, significant coke formation, and the need for high temperatures. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by operating at lower temperatures due to the exothermic nature of the reaction, which reduces energy consumption. The presence of oxygen inhibits coke formation, leading to longer catalyst lifetimes. However, ODHP presents its own set of advantages and limitations, particularly in the context of oxidant selection. Oxygen is a highly effective oxidant for ODHP, but its use can lead to unselective combustion reactions, limiting alkene selectivities. The specific challenges associated with using oxygen include the need to balance the reaction conditions to favor dehydrogenation over combustion and the potential for safety concerns due to the explosive nature of oxygen-hydrocarbon mixtures.

1.当前丙烯生产方法的主要挑战,如裂解和脱氢,包括高能耗、大量焦炭形成和需要高温。丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)通过在较低温度下运行来解决这些问题,因为反应是放热的,这减少了能耗。氧气的存在抑制了焦炭的形成,导致催化剂寿命更长。然而,ODHP有其自身的一系列优势和局限性,特别是在氧化剂选择的背景下。氧气是ODHP的有效氧化剂,但其使用会导致非选择性燃烧反应,限制了烯烃的选择性。使用氧气的具体挑战包括需要平衡反应条件,以利于脱氢而不是燃烧,以及由于氧气-碳氢化合物混合物的爆炸性质而可能存在的安全问题。
