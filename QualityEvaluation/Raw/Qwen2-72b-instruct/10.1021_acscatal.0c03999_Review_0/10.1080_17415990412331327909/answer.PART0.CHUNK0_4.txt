1.The primary challenges in current propylene production methods, such as cracking and dehydrogenation, include high energy consumption, significant coke formation, and the need for high temperatures. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by operating at lower temperatures due to the presence of oxygen, which inhibits coke formation. However, ODHP presents its own set of advantages and limitations, particularly in the context of oxidant selection. Oxygen is a preferred oxidant due to its ability to promote selectivity for propene, but the unselective combustion reactions limit alkene selectivities. The use of oxygen also leads to extensive selectivity losses with increasing conversion, due to propene re-adsorption and subsequent oxidation to carbon oxides, resulting in propene yields lower than 30%. The addition of H2S to the feed gas has been shown to significantly enhance the yield of propene in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane, providing a promising route for improving propene yield.

1.当前丙烯生产方法的主要挑战,如裂解和脱氢,包括高能耗、大量焦炭形成和需要高温。丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)通过在较低温度下运行来解决这些问题,这是因为氧气的存在抑制了焦炭的形成。然而,ODHP在氧化剂选择方面有其自身的一系列优势和局限性。氧气是首选的氧化剂,因为它能促进丙烯的选择性,但非选择性燃烧反应限制了烯烃的选择性。氧气的使用也会导致随着转化率的增加,选择性损失严重,这是由于丙烯的再吸附和随后氧化为一氧化碳和二氧化碳,导致丙烯产量低于30%。在进料气体中添加H2S已被证明能显著提高丙烷氧化脱氢中丙烯的产量,为提高丙烯产量提供了一条有希望的途径。
