1.The primary challenges in current propylene production methods, such as cracking and dehydrogenation, include high energy consumption, significant coke formation, and the need for high temperatures. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by operating at lower temperatures due to the presence of oxygen, which inhibits coke formation. However, ODHP presents its own set of advantages and limitations, particularly in the context of oxidant selection. Oxygen is a preferred oxidant due to its ability to promote selectivity for propene, but the unselective combustion reactions limit alkene selectivities. The presence of oxygen can lead to the oxidation of propene to carbon oxides, reducing propene yields. The use of oxygen also requires careful control of reaction conditions to prevent over-oxidation and ensure high propene selectivity.

1.当前丙烯生产方法的主要挑战，如裂解和脱氢，包括高能耗、大量焦炭形成和需要高温。丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）通过在较低温度下运行，由于氧气的存在抑制了焦炭的形成，解决了这些问题。然而，ODHP在氧化剂选择的背景下有其自身的一系列优势和局限性。氧气是首选的氧化剂，因为它能促进丙烯的选择性，但非选择性的燃烧反应限制了烯烃的选择性。氧气的存在会导致丙烯氧化为碳氧化物，降低丙烯的产量。氧气的使用还需要仔细控制反应条件，以防止过度氧化，确保高丙烯选择性。
