1.The primary challenges in current propylene production methods, such as cracking and dehydrogenation, include high energy consumption, significant coke formation, and the need for high temperatures. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by operating at lower temperatures due to the presence of oxygen, which inhibits coke formation. However, ODHP presents its own set of advantages and limitations, particularly in the context of oxidant selection. Oxygen is a preferred oxidant due to its ability to promote selectivity for propene, but the unselective combustion reactions limit alkene selectivities. The presence of oxygen can lead to the oxidation of propene to carbon oxides, reducing propene yields. The use of oxygen also requires careful control of reaction conditions to prevent over-oxidation and ensure high propene selectivity.

1.当前丙烯生产方法的主要挑战，如裂解和脱氢，包括高能耗、大量焦炭形成和需要高温。丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）通过在较低温度下运行，由于氧气的存在抑制了焦炭的形成，解决了这些问题。然而，ODHP在氧化剂选择的背景下有其自身的一系列优势和局限性。氧气是首选的氧化剂，因为它能促进丙烯的选择性，但非选择性的燃烧反应限制了烯烃的选择性。氧气的存在会导致丙烯氧化为碳氧化物，降低丙烯的产量。氧气的使用还需要仔细控制反应条件，以防止过度氧化，确保高丙烯选择性。

1.The primary challenges in current propylene production methods, such as cracking and dehydrogenation, include high energy consumption, significant coke formation, and the need for high temperatures. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by operating at lower temperatures due to the exothermic nature of the reaction, which reduces energy consumption. The presence of oxygen inhibits coke formation, leading to longer catalyst lifetimes. However, ODHP presents its own set of advantages and limitations, particularly in the context of oxidant selection. Oxygen is a highly effective oxidant for ODHP, but its use can lead to unselective combustion reactions, limiting alkene selectivities. The specific challenges associated with using oxygen include the need to balance the reaction conditions to favor dehydrogenation over combustion and the potential for safety concerns due to the explosive nature of oxygen-hydrocarbon mixtures.

1.当前丙烯生产方法的主要挑战,如裂解和脱氢,包括高能耗、大量焦炭形成和需要高温。丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)通过在较低温度下运行来解决这些问题,因为反应是放热的,这减少了能耗。氧气的存在抑制了焦炭的形成,导致催化剂寿命更长。然而,ODHP有其自身的一系列优势和局限性,特别是在氧化剂选择的背景下。氧气是ODHP的有效氧化剂,但其使用会导致非选择性燃烧反应,限制了烯烃的选择性。使用氧气的具体挑战包括需要平衡反应条件,以利于脱氢而不是燃烧,以及由于氧气-碳氢化合物混合物的爆炸性质而可能存在的安全问题。

1.The primary challenges in current propylene production methods, such as cracking and dehydrogenation, include high energy consumption, significant carbon dioxide emissions, and the formation of coke, which can lead to catalyst deactivation. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by operating at lower temperatures, which reduces energy consumption and carbon dioxide emissions. Additionally, the presence of oxygen inhibits coke formation, extending catalyst life. However, ODHP presents its own set of advantages and limitations, particularly in the context of oxidant selection. Oxygen is a highly effective oxidant for ODHP, promoting high propylene yields. However, the use of oxygen also presents challenges, including the risk of explosive mixtures and the potential for over-oxidation, leading to the formation of carbon oxides. The introduction of H2S in the feed mixture has been shown to enhance the selectivity for propylene, likely by modifying the reaction pathway and suppressing over-oxidation.

Oxygen is a preferred oxidant due to its ability to promote selectivity for propene, but the unselective combustion reactions limit alkene selectivities. The use of oxygen also leads to extensive selectivity losses with increasing conversion, due to propene re-adsorption and subsequent oxidation to carbon oxides, resulting in propene yields lower than 30%. The addition of H2S to the feed gas has been shown to significantly enhance the yield of propene in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane, providing a promising route for improving propene yield.
