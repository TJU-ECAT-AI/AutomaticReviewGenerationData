[1] "Propane direct dehydrogenation (DH) as well as oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) have attracted worldwide academic and industrial interests, but both suffer from limitations that have been reviewed extensively elsewhere1-3."
[2] "Propane DH is an endothermic reaction and thus high temperatures are required to achieve acceptable olefin yields."
[3] "The CATOFIN dehydrogenation process4-5 provides 850000 MTA (million metric tons annually) of propylene with minimum of 99.5% purity and is based on chromium oxide supported on activated alumina."
[4] "The Oleflex dehydrogenation process4-5 relies on the traditional Pt/Sn catalytic system to produce polymer grade propylene."
[5] "The high operating temperature as well as the cost of the Pt catalysts comprise the main drawbacks."
[6] "In addition,the reaction is usually accompanied by catalyst deactivation due to coke formation and spatial separation of Pt-Sn species thus highlighting the stability of catalysts used among the major botlenecks6-7."
[7] "On the other hand, although the exothermic character of propane ODH with O2 has the potential to significantly reduce the reaction temperature, the fate of the desired propylene is difficult to be controlled due to unavoidable combustion of propane as well as of propylene to carbon monoxide and/or dioxide thus significantly lowering propylene selectivity."
[8] "The use of CO2 as, alternative to oxygen, soft oxidant has the potential to i) avoid deep oxidation of alkanes/alkenes, ii) reduce coke formation and iii) favor propane conversion due to participation of the produced hydrogen in the reverse water- gas shift reaction (RWGS)."

1.Current propylene production methods, such as fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) and steam cracking, have limitations, including high operating temperatures, high costs of precious metal catalysts, and catalyst deactivation due to coke formation and spatial separation of Pt-Sn species. Propane oxidative dehydrogenation (ODHP) has the potential to significantly reduce the reaction temperature due to its exothermic nature, but it also presents challenges in controlling the fate of the desired propylene due to the combustion of propane and propylene to carbon monoxide and/or dioxide, which significantly lowers propylene selectivity. The use of carbon dioxide as an alternative to oxygen as a soft oxidant can potentially avoid deep oxidation of alkanes/alkenes, reduce coke formation, and favor propane conversion due to the participation of the produced hydrogen in the reverse water-gas shift reaction.

1.当前的丙烯生产方法，如流体催化裂化（FCC）和蒸汽裂解，存在局限性，包括高温操作、贵金属催化剂的高成本以及由于焦炭形成和Pt-Sn物种的空间分离导致的催化剂失活。丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）由于其放热性质，有可能显著降低反应温度，但同时也存在控制所需丙烯命运的挑战，因为丙烷和丙烯的燃烧会转化为一氧化碳和/或二氧化碳，这会显著降低丙烯的选择性。使用二氧化碳作为氧气的替代品，作为一种温和的氧化剂，有可能避免烷烃/烯烃的深度氧化，减少焦炭的形成，并由于产生的氢气参与逆向水煤气转换反应而有利于丙烷的转化。

1.当前的丙烯生产方法，如流化催化裂化（FCC）和蒸汽裂解，存在局限性。丙烷直接脱氢（DH）和氧化脱氢（ODH）是引起全球学术和工业界关注的替代方法，但它们也有自己的挑战。丙烷DH是吸热反应，需要高温才能获得可接受的烯烃产量。CATOFIN脱氢工艺使用负载在活性氧化铝上的铬氧化物，而Oleflex脱氢工艺依赖于传统的Pt/Sn催化系统来生产聚合级丙烯，但它们的缺点是高操作温度和Pt催化剂的成本。催化剂失活是由于焦炭形成和Pt-Sn物种的空间分离，这是主要的瓶颈之一。另一方面，尽管丙烷ODH与O2的放热特性有可能显著降低反应温度，但由于丙烷和丙烯不可避免地燃烧成一氧化碳和/或二氧化碳，导致丙烯选择性显著降低，因此很难控制所需的丙烯的命运。使用CO2作为替代氧气的软氧化剂，有可能避免烷烃/烯烃的深度氧化，减少焦炭形成，并由于产生的氢参与逆向水煤气转换反应（RWGS）而有利于丙烷转化。

1.Current propylene production methods, such as fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) and steam cracking, have limitations, including high operating temperatures, high costs of precious metal catalysts, and catalyst deactivation due to coke formation and spatial separation of active species. Propane oxidative dehydrogenation (ODHP) addresses these issues by potentially reducing the reaction temperature due to its exothermic nature. However, ODHP presents its own set of challenges, particularly in controlling the fate of propylene due to the risk of overoxidation to carbon monoxide and dioxide, which significantly lowers propylene selectivity. The selection of oxidant is crucial, with carbon dioxide (CO2) being a preferred alternative to oxygen due to its potential to avoid deep oxidation, reduce coke formation, and favor propane conversion.
