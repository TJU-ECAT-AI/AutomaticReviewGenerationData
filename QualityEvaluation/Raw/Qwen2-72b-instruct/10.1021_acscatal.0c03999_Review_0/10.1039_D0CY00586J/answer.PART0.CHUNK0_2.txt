[1] "Propane direct dehydrogenation (DH) as well as oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) have attracted worldwide academic and industrial interests, but both suffer from limitations that have been reviewed extensively elsewhere1-3."
[2] "Propane DH is an endothermic reaction and thus high temperatures are required to achieve acceptable olefin yields."
[3] "The CATOFIN dehydrogenation process4-5 provides 850000 MTA (million metric tons annually) of propylene with minimum of 99.5% purity and is based on chromium oxide supported on activated alumina."
[4] "The Oleflex dehydrogenation process4-5 relies on the traditional Pt/Sn catalytic system to produce polymer grade propylene."
[5] "The high operating temperature as well as the cost of the Pt catalysts comprise the main drawbacks."
[6] "In addition,the reaction is usually accompanied by catalyst deactivation due to coke formation and spatial separation of Pt-Sn species thus highlighting the stability of catalysts used among the major botlenecks6-7."
[7] "On the other hand, although the exothermic character of propane ODH with O2 has the potential to significantly reduce the reaction temperature, the fate of the desired propylene is difficult to be controlled due to unavoidable combustion of propane as well as of propylene to carbon monoxide and/or dioxide thus significantly lowering propylene selectivity."
[8] "The use of CO2 as, alternative to oxygen, soft oxidant has the potential to i) avoid deep oxidation of alkanes/alkenes, ii) reduce coke formation and iii) favor propane conversion due to participation of the produced hydrogen in the reverse water- gas shift reaction (RWGS)."

1.Current propylene production methods, such as fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) and steam cracking, have limitations. Propane direct dehydrogenation (DH) and oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) are alternatives that have attracted attention, but they also have their own challenges. Propane DH is endothermic, requiring high temperatures for acceptable olefin yields. The CATOFIN and Oleflex dehydrogenation processes, which use chromium oxide and Pt/Sn catalytic systems respectively, are limited by high operating temperatures, the cost of Pt catalysts, and catalyst deactivation due to coke formation and spatial separation of Pt-Sn species. Propane ODH with O2 can reduce the reaction temperature due to its exothermic nature, but it is difficult to control the fate of propylene due to the combustion of propane and propylene to carbon monoxide and/or dioxide, significantly lowering propylene selectivity. The use of CO2 as a soft oxidant in propane ODH can avoid deep oxidation of alkanes/alkenes, reduce coke formation, and favor propane conversion due to the participation of the produced hydrogen in the reverse water-gas shift reaction (RWGS).

1.当前丙烯生产方法，如流化催化裂化（FCC）和蒸汽裂解，存在局限性。丙烷直接脱氢（DH）和氧化脱氢（ODH）是引起关注的替代方法，但它们也有自己的挑战。丙烷DH是吸热反应，需要高温才能获得可接受的烯烃产量。CATOFIN和Oleflex脱氢过程，分别使用铬氧化物和Pt/Sn催化系统，受到高温操作、Pt催化剂成本以及由于焦炭形成和Pt-Sn物种空间分离导致的催化剂失活的限制。丙烷与O2的ODH由于其放热性质可以降低反应温度，但由于丙烷和丙烯燃烧为一氧化碳和/或二氧化碳，难以控制丙烯的命运，显著降低了丙烯的选择性。在丙烷ODH中使用CO2作为软氧化剂可以避免烷烃/烯烃的深度氧化，减少焦炭形成，并由于产生的氢参与逆向水煤气转换反应（RWGS）而有利于丙烷转化。
