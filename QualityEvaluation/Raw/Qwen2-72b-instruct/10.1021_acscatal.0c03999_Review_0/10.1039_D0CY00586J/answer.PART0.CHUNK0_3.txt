[1] "Propane direct dehydrogenation (DH) as well as oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) have attracted worldwide academic and industrial interests, but both suffer from limitations that have been reviewed extensively elsewhere1-3."
[2] "Propane DH is an endothermic reaction and thus high temperatures are required to achieve acceptable olefin yields."
[3] "The CATOFIN dehydrogenation process4-5 provides 850000 MTA (million metric tons annually) of propylene with minimum of 99.5% purity and is based on chromium oxide supported on activated alumina."
[4] "The Oleflex dehydrogenation process4-5 relies on the traditional Pt/Sn catalytic system to produce polymer grade propylene."
[5] "The high operating temperature as well as the cost of the Pt catalysts comprise the main drawbacks."
[6] "In addition,the reaction is usually accompanied by catalyst deactivation due to coke formation and spatial separation of Pt-Sn species thus highlighting the stability of catalysts used among the major botlenecks6-7."
[7] "On the other hand, although the exothermic character of propane ODH with O2 has the potential to significantly reduce the reaction temperature, the fate of the desired propylene is difficult to be controlled due to unavoidable combustion of propane as well as of propylene to carbon monoxide and/or dioxide thus significantly lowering propylene selectivity."
[8] "The use of CO2 as, alternative to oxygen, soft oxidant has the potential to i) avoid deep oxidation of alkanes/alkenes, ii) reduce coke formation and iii) favor propane conversion due to participation of the produced hydrogen in the reverse water- gas shift reaction (RWGS)."

1.Current propylene production methods, such as fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) and steam cracking, have limitations. Propane direct dehydrogenation (DH) and oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) are alternatives that have attracted interest, but they also have challenges. Propane DH is endothermic, requiring high temperatures for acceptable yields. The CATOFIN process, using chromium oxide on activated alumina, and the Oleflex process, using a Pt/Sn catalytic system, are examples of DH methods. However, high operating temperatures and catalyst costs are drawbacks. Catalyst deactivation due to coke formation and spatial separation of Pt-Sn species is a major issue. Propane ODH with O2 can reduce reaction temperatures but makes it difficult to control the fate of propylene due to combustion to CO and CO2, lowering selectivity. Using CO2 as a soft oxidant can avoid deep oxidation, reduce coke formation, and favor propane conversion due to the reverse water-gas shift reaction.

1.当前的丙烯生产方法，如流化催化裂化（FCC）和蒸汽裂解，存在局限性。丙烷直接脱氢（DH）和氧化脱氢（ODH）是引起全球学术和工业兴趣的替代方法，但它们也存在挑战。丙烷DH是吸热反应，需要高温才能获得可接受的产率。CATOFIN过程，使用铬氧化物在活性氧化铝上，以及Oleflex过程，使用Pt/Sn催化系统，是DH方法的例子。然而，高操作温度和催化剂成本是缺点。由于焦炭形成和Pt-Sn物种的空间分离导致的催化剂失活是一个主要问题。丙烷ODH与O2可以降低反应温度，但很难控制所需丙烯的命运，因为丙烷和丙烯不可避免地燃烧成CO和CO2，从而显著降低丙烯的选择性。使用CO2作为软氧化剂，可以避免深度氧化，减少焦炭形成，并由于逆向水煤气转换反应而有利于丙烷转化。
