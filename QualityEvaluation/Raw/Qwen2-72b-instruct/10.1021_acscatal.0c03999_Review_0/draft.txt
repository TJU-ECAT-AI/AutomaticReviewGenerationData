1. Challenges in propylene production and the potential of oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) as an alternative method: advantages, limitations, and the role of oxidants

The escalating demand for propylene, particularly in Western Europe, and the limitations of current production methods like steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) [\[10.1016/j.cattod.2007.05.009\]]. These traditional processes are energy-intensive, emit greenhouse gases, and are constrained by thermodynamic limitations and catalyst deactivation [\[10.1016/j.jcat.2010.06.010\]]. Dehydrogenation methods, while theoretically advantageous, are hindered by equilibrium constraints and coking issues [\[10.1016/0021-9517(77)90228-7\]]. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP), an emerging alternative, directly addresses these challenges by offering a more exothermal and energy-efficient process that aligns better with market needs [\[10.1016/j.cattod.2007.05.009\]]. However, the use of oxygen in ODHP increases energy losses and fixed costs due to CO2 production [\[10.1016/j.cattod.2007.05.009\]]. Despite this, ODHP presents a promising alternative for propylene production, offering improved energy efficiency and process simplicity [\[10.1016/j.cattod.2007.05.009\]].

The choice of oxidant in ODHP is pivotal, impacting reaction pathway, product selectivity, and catalyst stability [\[10.1016/j.jcat.2010.06.010\]]. Oxygen, though effective, risks deep oxidation to CO2, reducing propylene selectivity and posing safety hazards due to its reactivity [\[10.1134/S0023158418060010\]]. N2O as an oxidant enhances propene selectivity and mitigates deep oxidation, though it may lower activity and has higher costs [\[10.1016/j.jcat.2010.06.010\]]. The use of SO2 as an oxidant in ODHP enhances selectivity per pass at high temperatures, though it increases propane conversion at the expense of reduced propylene selectivity compared to pure propane feed [\[10.1016/0021-9517(77)90228-7\]]. CO2, as a mild oxidant, reduces operating temperatures by oxidizing hydrogen from propane and releasing heat, unlike molecular oxygen which promotes over-oxidation [\[10.1038/s41467-018-03793-w\]]. 

Catalysts, especially vanadium-based and mixed-metal oxides, improve selectivity and conversion while curbing overoxidation, though they haven't yet matched established methods' yields [\[10.1021/jp410750c\]]. Recent studies suggest using CO2 as a mild oxidant could mitigate over-oxidation, potentially making the process exothermic and improving catalyst performance [\[10.1039/C5CY00998G\]]. Despite promising yields, ODHP's results are below industrial interest, indicating a need for catalyst and reactor configuration advancements to maintain high selectivity under high conversion conditions [\[10.1039/C5CY00998G\]].

Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: Considering the advancements and findings discussed, there lies an opportunity to explore emerging fields and innovative methodologies. Future research endeavors might focus on the development of novel catalysts that can enhance propylene selectivity while suppressing overoxidation. The use of CO2 as a mild oxidant in ODHP presents a promising direction, potentially turning the process exothermic and reducing catalyst coking. This approach could not only improve the efficiency of propylene production but also contribute to CO2 utilization and reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. Additionally, the design of advanced reactor configurations that can optimize the performance of these catalysts under high conversion conditions is crucial for the commercial viability of ODHP. The integration of process intensification techniques, such as membrane reactors or catalytic distillation, could further enhance the selectivity and efficiency of the ODHP process. Moreover, the exploration of alternative oxidants, beyond oxygen and CO2, that can offer higher selectivity and stability under ODHP conditions is a promising avenue for future research. The development of predictive models and computational tools to guide the design and optimization of ODHP processes could also significantly accelerate the discovery of new catalysts and process configurations. Overall, the future of propylene production through ODHP is bright, with the potential for significant advancements in catalyst design, reactor engineering, and process intensification.
