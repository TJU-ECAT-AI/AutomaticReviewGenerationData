Abstract: The catalytic oxidative coupling of methane (OCM) to C2 hydrocarbons with oxygen (O2-OCM) has garnered renewed worldwide interest in the past decade due to the emergence of enormous new shale gas resources. However, the C2 selectivity of typical OCM processes is significantly challenged by overoxidation to COx products. Other gaseous reagents such as N2O, CO2, and S2 have been investigated to a far lesser extent as alternative, milder oxidants to replace O2. Although several authoritative review articles have summarized OCM research progress in depth, recent oxidative coupling developments using alternative oxidants (X-OCM) have not been overviewed in detail. In this perspective, we review and analyze OCM research results reporting the implementation of N2O, CO2, S2,and other non-O2 oxidants, highlighting the unique chemistries of these systems and their advantages/challenges compared to O2-
OCM. Current outlook and potential areas for future study are also
discussed.
1. Introduction
Methane is an abundant hydrocarbon and the principal component of natural gas. Currently, over 90% of the methane in natural gas is flared or combusted for energy generation instead of being used as an inexpensive carbon feedstock.[1] The rise of shale gas in the past decade has led to a renewed interest in upgrading methane to value-added chemicals.
Methane reforming to syngas, CO and H2, can serve as a source of methanol,[1] or followed by the Fischer-Tropsch oligomerization process, as a source of  liquid hydrocarbons. These are the most widely utilized approaches to methane-derived chemicals  on the industrial scale.[2] However, the direct catalytic conversion of methane into higher hydrocarbons such as ethylene would be highly desirable. Oxidative coupling of methane with O2 (O2-OCM),is one such approach in which methane molecules can be coupled to form C2 products (equations 1-2).

These OCM reactions are generally thought to involve the formation of methyl radicals (CH3·) on the surface of metal oxide catalysts.[1, 3] The radicals desorb and couple in the gas phase to form ethane, which can be further dehydrogenated to ethylene.[4] Unfortunately, in the presence of an oxidant, the ethane and ethylene also undergo facile oxidation to CO and CO2, reflecting the pronounced thermodynamic stability of these over-oxidation products (Table 1). Mechanistically, COx may derive from a number of pathways. For example, C2 products such as ethane and ethylene may be further activated on the catalyst surface.[5] Alternatively, surface or gas phase oxygen species may react with methyl radicals.[4, 6] The high temperatures of O2-OCM may also facilitate hydrocarbon combustion in the gas phase.[6] Since the discovery of O2-OCM by Keller and Bhasin in 1982,[7] there have been over 2000 publications on the topic. As shown in Figure 1, there was an initial surge in publications in the decade and a half following the original 1982 report. In the past several years, the hydrocarbon catalysis community has witnessed a second surge in OCM research due to the current shale gas revolution. However, despite the abundance of OCM research findings, achieving a high yield of C2 products (ethane and ethylene) remains a major challenge. It has been estimated that a C2 yield of at least 30% will be necessary for OCM commercialization, yet few catalytic systems are able to approach this benchmark.[8] The main limiting factor is the formation of the aforementioned COx byproducts. Thus, approaches that seek to suppress the formation of CO2 and CO from methane or C2 products will be necessary to achieve high yields of the desired products.

The blue bars represent publications utilizing O2 as the oxidant (O2-OCM), while the red bars correspond to publications using other oxidants (X-OCM).
One conceivable strategy to enhance OCM selectivity is to control the types of active oxidizing species that are present under reaction conditions. The replacement of O2 with other oxidants is one possible approach to achieve this goal. In fact, substituting O2 with less aggressive, softer oxidants such as CO2 or N2O has been a frequent strategy for light alkane partial oxidations.[9] As shown in Figure 1, a small fraction (about 3%) of OCM publications have also pursued this strategy, making use of N2O, CO2, S2, and other milder oxidants (X-OCM). Alternative oxidants may improve selectivity to desired products by decreasing the thermodynamic driving force for overoxidation processes, forming more selective active oxygen species, or a combination of these factors.

Although there have been several recent reviews summarizing the OCM literature, many do not address research on alternative oxidants.[1, 10] Those that do often only mention them briefly or only discuss one potential oxidant. However, X-
OCM
systems often exhibit unique,under-investigated chemistries and promising C2 selectivities compared to traditional O2-OCM. As such, this article will, for the first time, review recent developments in X-OCM research, focusing on the oxidants N2O, CO2, S2, and others. We will compare and contrast the potential advantages and limitations of each oxidant, summarize the results that have been achieved to date, and critically assess current challenges and areas of interest for further study.

2. N2O as an Oxidant (N2O-OCM)
2.1. Motivation
N2O is one possible alternative oxidant for OCM and related partial oxidation reactions. Like CH4, N2O is a greenhouse gas,and its use in the production of value-added chemicals is desired.[11] It has been frequently investigated as an oxidant for methane partial oxidation to oxygenates such as methanol and formaldehyde over zeolite catalysts.[12] As such, N2O can also act as the oxidant for OCM (N2O-OCM) to form C2 products via equations 3-4. ΔG of the ethane-forming reaction is -279 kJ/mol
2 CH4 + N2O  C2H6 + H2O + N2

at 800 C, compared to -114 kJ/mol for the same coupling reaction with O2 (Table 1).[13] Note that although N2O-OCM is thermodynamically more downhill than O2-OCM, the kinetic tendency of the catalyst to activate the oxidant is also an important parameter that influences reactivity.
Utilizing N2O as an oxidant could conceivably lead to enhanced C2 selectivity in OCM due to its relatively mild oxidizing tendency compared to O2.[14] In particular, N2O can only provide a monoatomic oxygen species, such as O-·.[15] Dioxygen, in contrast, can form peroxo species under OCM reaction conditions that are precursors to CO2.[16] Furthermore, N2O decomposes on the catalyst surface, leading to the release of N2 gas and the formation of surface oxygen sites.[15] It has generally been observed in the OCM literature that monoatomic surface oxygen species (O*) are responsible for selective C2 formation, whereas molecular or gas phase oxygen species facilitate overoxidation.[17] In fact, it has been estimated that there is an upper limit of 28% single pass C2 yield for OCM in the presence of gas phase O2 under typical O2/CH4 cofeed conditions.[17a] Thus, if N2O preferentially forms selective O* sites, with limited to no competing diatomic or gas phase oxygen formation, a high C2 selectivity might be achieved. Additionally, the range of possible oxidant/CH4 ratios is far wider when using N2O, as there is no threat of explosion or runaway CH4 combustion as with O2.[18]
2.2. N2O-OCM Scope and Mechanism
The literature reports for each different alternative oxidant for X- OCM systems tend to highlight very different aspects of the catalytic reaction. For example, studies of OCM with N2O as the oxidant have focused primarily on comparing N2O-OCM to O2- OCM systems, activation of the oxidant, and mechanistic insights.
As such, our discussion in this section will emphasize these aspects and end with a brief description of some nontraditional N2O-OCM catalysts.
Catalysts for N2O-OCM are frequently irreducible, basic, or rare earth metal oxides. For most of these catalysts, the use of N2O leads to reduced methane conversions, but improved C2 selectivities versus O2 as the oxidant.[18-19] Even at approximately equal CH4 conversion levels, the C2 selectivity has been observed to be significantly higher using N2O than O2.[19f, 20] For example, Hutchings et. al showed that the total C2 selectivity over a Sm2O3-based catalyst was 75% with N2O compared to about 50% using O2 at similar CH4 conversions. More recently, a 2012 publication from Schomcker et. al compared the OCM performance of a series of literature catalysts and catalysts prepared via cellulose templating (CT) using both N2O and O2 as oxidants.[20b] The CT synthesis method had previously been applied to perovskite O2-OCM catalysts in order to cheaply produce bulk materials with high surface area.[21] In the CH4 conversion range of 25-35%, the C2 selectivity on average is 11% higher when using N2O compared to O2. This trend can be visualized graphically in Figure 2.
The observed higher C2 selectivity with N2O has been attributed to the preferential formation of surface O or O  sites,which catalyze the formation of ·CH3 radicals.[18, 20a, 22] A series of publications investigated the nature of defects in Li/CaO catalysts following both O2-OCM and N2O-OCM.[23] The authors observed that N2O-OCM leads to decreased CO production and greater yields of C2 products. Electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy (EPR) was used to determine the concentrations of various defect centers, such as O3-·, CO2-·, LiCO3-· and O-·. In the presence of an O2/CH4 mixture, predominately O3-·, CO2-·, and LiCO3-· defects were detected. However, in an N2O/CH4 reaction medium, the concentration of O-· increased significantly, providing evidence that O-· species are derived from N2O and lead to selective C2 formation.[23a, 23b]

From the above discussion, the activation of N2O on oxide catalysts to release N2 and O* is presumably an important step in an N2O-OCM process. The reduction of N2O with CH4 over Fe- exchanged zeolites may provide additional insight into this process.[11a, 24] Such studies have reported the formation of adsorbed monatomic oxygen species (O*) after N2O treatment as assessed via techniques such as O2-TPD and
FT-IR
spectroscopy. Additionally, results from pulse reactions of N2O and CH4 suggest that N2O decomposition releases N2 and creates 0 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 45 50 55 60 0 20 40 60 80 100 LiMg(lit) NaWSi(lit) Yield = 10%

O* species which then oxidize methane to CO, CO2, or C2 products.[24d, 25] Several reports using N2O as an oxidant also investigated the mechanism of N2O decomposition on the surface of metal oxide OCM catalysts.[25-26] Many of these studies attempted to differentiate between two possible
N2O
decomposition pathways.[26] In Pathway 1 (equations 5-6), N2O is activated at a coordination-unsaturated cation to form N2 gas and an O* species.
A second N2O molecule then interacts with O* to regenerate the active center. In Pathway 2, N2O decomposes into N2 and O* over anion vacancies, and two O* species may come together to release molecular oxygen (equations 7-8).
Pathway 1:
N2O + *  O* + N2
(5)
N2O + O*  O2 + N2 + *
(6)
* = coordinately unsaturated cation
Pathway 2:
N2O + *  O* + N2
(7)
O* + O*  O2 + 2 *
(8)
* = anion vacancy
These pathways can be distinguished by measuring the effect of cofed O2 during N2O-OCM. Since Pathway 2 involves a reversible O2 adsorption step, the addition of O2 to the reactant stream should inhibit N2O decomposition on catalysts that follow this route. In contrast, added O2 should have no effect on the decomposition rate for catalysts that follow Pathway 1.[26a, 26c] In Pathway 1, the active centers for N2O decomposition are suggested to be coordinately unsaturated transition metal or redox active cations. Oxides such as undoped Bi2O3 or CaO catalysts with Fe impurities fall under this category.[26a-c] Contrarily,catalysts such as SrO and Li or Er-doped Bi2O3 proceed via Pathway 2. Here, the active sites for N2O decomposition are anion vacancies, and O2 addition inhibits the decomposition rate by competing for the same sites.[26a, 27] In a comparative study of SrO (Pathway 2) and Na/CaO (Pathway 1), SrO exhibits significantly higher N2O-OCM activity and selectivity.[26a] Thus, it can be argued that anion vacancies are the more desirable active sites for N2O-OCM compared to redox sites such as under-coordinated cations.
Kinetic measurements on N2O-OCM reactions have also provided insight into the role of N2O. Lunsford measured the KIE and reaction rate orders of N2O-OCM over Li/MgO and found that the kinetics depend on the N2O concentration.[18] At low concentrations, the N2O-OCM reaction is first order in oxidant and the measured KIE is near unity, suggesting that oxygen incorporation on the catalyst surface due to N2O decomposition is rate determining. The CH4 reaction order is zero under these conditions, consistent with previous studies by Otsuka that claimed the N2O decomposition activation barrier was unchanged in the presence of CH4.[22] However, under excess N2O, the KIE increases to 1.9 and the reaction becomes first order in CH4,suggesting that C-H activation becomes rate-limiting. Kinetic analyses over Pb/MgO revealed an N2O order that transitioned from 1 to 0 as the oxidant partial pressure was increased,although CH4 remained first order across all N2O/CH4 ratios.[19d] In traditional O2-OCM, C-H activation is typically the rate-limiting step, even at low O2 concentrations.[28] However, N2O decomposition is slow on oxide surfaces compared to that of O2,plausibly accounting for the mechanistic differences.[19h] Another important factor to consider is how the catalyst properties affect the activity of N2O-OCM processes. Branco and coworkers studied a series of Ca/actinide oxide and Ca/lanthanide oxide catalysts for N2O-OCM in order to determine how basicity and reducibility affected the product distribution.[29] They found that catalyst basicity, as measured by CO2-TPD and probe reactions, correlated with high C2 yields over lanthanide and actinide oxides. Furthermore, greater catalyst reducibility and more labile lattice oxygen species lead to increased activity but lower C2 yields.[29b] These trends are depicted in Figure 3.
Interestingly, the authors observed that the catalysts are more active under N2O than under O2, contrary to most other systems.
They attributed this result to a cooperative effect between Ca and the f block elements.
In addition to traditional alkaline and rare earth-based oxides,a number of other catalyst systems have proven to be effective for N2O-OCM. For example, Sugiyama examined hydroxyapatite catalysts for N2O-OCM and observed that the selectivity displays little to no dependence on the N2O partial pressure.[30] In contrast, O2-OCM selectivity often falls significantly as more O2 is added due to overoxidation reactions in the gas phase.[31] It was proposed that CH4 is activated by surface O species, which are replenished by N2O decomposition.[30a] The addition of tetrachloromethane (TCM) to the reactant mixture was observed to suppress total oxidation in N2O-OCM by replacing surface OH groups with Cl.[30b]

Chlorine is also present in other effective N2O-OCM catalysts,such as KCl-LnCl3 molten salts.[20c] The La catalyst displays stable 75% C2 selectivity at about 10% conversion for 48 hours, while the same catalyst only achieves 40% C2 selectivity with O2 at isoconversion. After reaction, the presence of oxides and oxychlorides was confirmed via XPS and XRD, and catalysts with greater concentrations of these oxygen functionalities generally display increased activity but decreased C2 yield.

also been used as a dopant for perovskite catalysts.[32] The authors used
O2-TPD
to show that Cl-doped Ba0.5Sr0.5Fe0.2Co0.8O3-δ can attain a greater density of adsorbed O* species than the undoped structure, leading to higher activity and C2 selectivity in N2O-OCM. This catalyst achieved a remarkable 30.7% C2 yield (66.8% CH4 conversion, 46% C2 selectivity). Additionally, the major C2 product was ethylene (ethylene/ethane = 2.6), whereas many OCM catalysts produce primarily ethane.[5a, 33]

Many similarities can be drawn between O2 and N2O-OCM systems. Research on both oxidants has predominantly focused on basic, alkaline earth, or rare earth oxides. Surface basicity and oxygen content/lability are important factors affecting reactivity and selectivity for both systems.[10b, 29] Furthermore, the role of both O2 and N2O in replenishing/forming active oxygen species on the surface has been emphasized.[27, 34] However, the nature of these active species may differ. While O2 can form peroxo species that act as COx precursors, N2O can only initially form monoatomic O or O species and does not cause gas phase combustion reactions. These oxygen species can be formed via N2O decomposition, releasing N2. Figure 4 summarizes the mechanistic steps of N2O-OCM that have been proposed by various authors.[18, 19d, 22, 32] The higher C2 selectivity with N2O as an oxidant in turn has afforded promising yields. In fact, several catalysts achieve C2 yields greater than 10%, which is greater than or on par with numerous O2-OCM systems.[35] Figure 5 depicts the conversion and C2 selectivity of the top-performing N2O-OCM catalysts. These high C2 yields highlight that N2O- OCM is an approach that merits further study during this shale gas age.
3. CO2 as an Oxidant (N2O-OCM)
3.1. Motivation
Carbon dioxide is another greenhouse gas that has been investigated frequently as a softer oxidant for light alkane partial oxidation reactions.[36] Its use as an oxygen source for light alkane activation is currently especially attractive due to the high content of CO2 that is found in some shale gas reservoirs. For example,the New Albany Shale in Illinois and Kentucky contains up to 10%
CO2.[37]  For OCM with CO2 as an oxidant (CO2-OCM), ethane and
ethylene may be produced according to equations 9-10.  ΔG of
2 CH4 + CO2  C2H6 + H2O + CO
(9)
2 CH4 + 2 CO2  C2H4 + 2 H2O + 2 CO
(10)
the reaction in equation 10 (ethylene) is +71 kJ/mol at 800 C,compared to -307 kJ/mol with O2 (Table 1).[38] The endergonic nature of CO2-OCM, coupled with the inherent stability of the CO2 molecule implies that CO2-OCM is a more challenging reaction to drive forward then the O2 variant. However, employing CO2 as the oxidant alleviates heat management issues that challenge the highly exothermic O2-OCM. Furthermore, ethylene forms via thermal dehydrogenation of ethane in the gas phase in many OCM systems according to equation 11.[34, 39]
C2H6  C2H4 + H2
(11)
The addition of CO2 could help shift the equilibrium of this process towards the more valuable ethylene by consuming H2 via the reverse water-gas shift reaction (equation 12).
CO2 + H2  CO + H2O
(12)
Likewise, other side reactions between CH4 and CO2 to form CO (equations 13-14) such as dry reforming may occur, although they are less common over metal oxide catalysts compared to supported metallic catalysts. However, unlike O2-OCM where
CH4 + CO2  2 CO + 2 H2
(13)
CH4 + 3 CO2  4 CO + 2 H2O
(14)
both CO and CO2 are formed, CO will be the only carbon- containing byproduct when CO2 is the oxidant.
Furthermore, CO2-OCM can plausibly improve the C2 selectivity owing to the nature of active oxygen species. Like N2O, CO2 can only deliver monoatomic oxygen species to activate CH4 on the catalyst surface, preventing the formation of surface peroxo and gas phase oxygen that lead to overoxidation.
Moreover, unlike O2, CO2 is unlikely to interact with ·CH3 radicals in the gas phase.[40] Thermodynamic analyses place equilibrium CH4 conversions in the range of 10-30% in the temperature range
