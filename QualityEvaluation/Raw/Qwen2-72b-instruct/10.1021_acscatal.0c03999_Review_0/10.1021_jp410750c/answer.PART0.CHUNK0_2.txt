[1] "Olefins can also be produced from dehydrogenation reactions of alkane feedstocks; however, simple dehydrogenation reactions suffer from numerous limitations that restrict their extensive applications. The limitations include possible side reactions, thermodynamic constraints on selectivity and conversion, the endothermic nature of the process, which necessitates a high energy input, and coke formation resulting in catalytic deactivation."
[2] "One modification that may overcome many of these problems is oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH), in which an oxidant is added to the reaction feed of a thermal dehydrogenation unit, thereby initiating the reaction via the oxidant rather than high temperature alone."
[3] "Despite the desirable exothermic nature and the limited coke formation, ODH based on oxygen is confronted with the challenge of over oxidation of olefins to CO and CO2, as well as the possibility of reaction runaway."
[4] "To suppress the complete oxidation of alkane to COx to ensure a reasonable selectivity while maintaining good conversion of the ODH reactions, application of catalysts has been investigated, and many catalytic systems were found to be active for the process."
[5] "Another approach of reducing the overoxdiation of alkane and olefins in the ODH reactions is the use of an additive or a milder oxidant. Species such as halogens, sulfur-containing compounds, N2O, and CO2 have been tested respectively."

1.The primary challenges in current propylene production methods, particularly through simple dehydrogenation reactions, include side reactions, thermodynamic constraints on selectivity and conversion, the endothermic nature of the process requiring high energy input, and coke formation leading to catalytic deactivation. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by adding an oxidant to the reaction feed, initiating the reaction through the oxidant rather than solely relying on high temperatures. This modification can potentially overcome many of the limitations of simple dehydrogenation. However, when using oxygen as the oxidant in ODHP, there are challenges such as over oxidation of olefins to CO and CO2 and the possibility of reaction runaway. To mitigate these issues, catalysts have been applied, and various catalytic systems have been found to be active in the process. Another strategy to reduce overoxidation is the use of additives or milder oxidants, such as halogens, sulfur-containing compounds, N2O, and CO2.

1.当前丙烯生产方法的主要挑战，特别是在通过简单的脱氢反应生产时，包括副反应、选择性和转化率的热力学限制、需要高能量输入的吸热过程性质，以及导致催化剂失活的焦炭形成。丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)通过向反应进料中添加氧化剂，通过氧化剂而非仅依赖高温来引发反应，解决了这些问题。这种修改有可能克服简单脱氢的许多限制。然而，当在ODHP中使用氧气作为氧化剂时，存在将烯烃过度氧化为CO和CO2以及反应失控的可能性等挑战。为了缓解这些问题，已经应用了催化剂，并且在过程中发现了各种活性催化系统。另一种减少烯烃过度氧化的策略是使用添加剂或温和的氧化剂，如卤素、含硫化合物、N2O和CO2。
