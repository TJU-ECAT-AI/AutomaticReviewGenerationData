[1] "Olefins can also be produced from dehydrogenation reactions of alkane feedstocks; however, simple dehydrogenation reactions suffer from numerous limitations that restrict their extensive applications. The limitations include possible side reactions, thermodynamic constraints on selectivity and conversion, the endothermic nature of the process, which necessitates a high energy input, and coke formation resulting in catalytic deactivation."
[2] "One modification that may overcome many of these problems is oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH), in which an oxidant is added to the reaction feed of a thermal dehydrogenation unit, thereby initiating the reaction via the oxidant rather than high temperature alone."
[3] "Despite the desirable exothermic nature and the limited coke formation, ODH based on oxygen is confronted with the challenge of over oxidation of olefins to CO and CO2, as well as the possibility of reaction runaway."
[4] "To suppress the complete oxidation of alkane to COx to ensure a reasonable selectivity while maintaining good conversion of the ODH reactions, application of catalysts has been investigated, and many catalytic systems were found to be active for the process."
[5] "Supported vanadium-based oxides and mixed-metal oxides are among the most extensively studied because of their high thermal stability, large surface areas, and the favored reducibility and basicity that promote the ODH activity and selectivity."
[6] "Nevertheless, to date, none of these systems has shown product yields comparable to those obtained by the current industrial technologies of olefin production."

1.The primary challenges in current propylene production methods, such as cracking of hydrocarbons, include thermodynamic constraints on selectivity and conversion, the endothermic nature of the process requiring high energy input, and coke formation leading to catalytic deactivation. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by initiating the reaction via an oxidant rather than relying solely on high temperatures, which can help overcome limitations such as side reactions and thermodynamic constraints. However, ODHP presents its own set of challenges, particularly when using oxygen as the oxidant. Oxygen-based ODHP faces the issue of overoxidation of olefins to CO and CO2, as well as the risk of reaction runaway. To mitigate these challenges, the application of catalysts has been explored, with supported vanadium-based oxides and mixed-metal oxides being extensively studied due to their high thermal stability, large surface areas, and favorable reducibility and basicity. Despite these efforts, no catalytic system has yet demonstrated product yields comparable to those achieved by current industrial technologies for olefin production.

1.当前丙烯生产方法的主要挑战，如烃类裂解，包括选择性和转化率的热力学限制、需要高能量输入的吸热过程性质以及导致催化剂失活的焦炭形成。丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)通过氧化剂而非仅依赖高温来引发反应，解决了这些问题，这有助于克服诸如副反应和热力学限制等限制。然而，使用氧气作为氧化剂的ODHP也存在其自身的一系列挑战，特别是氧气基ODHP面临将烯烃过度氧化为CO和CO2的问题，以及反应失控的风险。为了缓解这些挑战，已经探索了催化剂的应用，其中基于钒的氧化物和混合金属氧化物因其高热稳定性、大表面积和有利的还原性和碱性而被广泛研究。尽管做出了这些努力，但到目前为止，没有催化系统显示出与当前工业技术用于烯烃生产的产品产量相当的水平。
