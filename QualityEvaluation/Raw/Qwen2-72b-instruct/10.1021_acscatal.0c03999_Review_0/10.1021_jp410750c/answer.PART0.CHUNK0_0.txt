[1] "Olefins can also be produced from dehydrogenation reactions of alkane feedstocks; however, simple dehydrogenation reactions suffer from numerous limitations that restrict their extensive applications. The limitations include possible side reactions, thermodynamic constraints on selectivity and conversion, the endothermic nature of the process, which necessitates a high energy input, and coke formation resulting in catalytic deactivation."
[2] "One modification that may overcome many of these problems is oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH), in which an oxidant is added to the reaction feed of a thermal dehydrogenation unit, thereby initiating the reaction via the oxidant rather than high temperature alone."
[3] "Despite the desirable exothermic nature and the limited coke formation, ODH based on oxygen is confronted with the challenge of over oxidation of olefins to CO and CO2, as well as the possibility of reaction runaway."
[4] "To suppress the complete oxidation of alkane to COx to ensure a reasonable selectivity while maintaining good conversion of the ODH reactions, application of catalysts has been investigated, and many catalytic systems were found to be active for the process."
[5] "Supported vanadium-based oxides and mixed-metal oxides are among the most extensively studied because of their high thermal stability, large surface areas, and the favored reducibility and basicity that promote the ODH activity and selectivity."
[6] "Nevertheless, to date, none of these systems has shown product yields comparable to those obtained by the current industrial technologies of olefin production."

1.The primary challenges in current propylene production methods, such as cracking of hydrocarbons, include thermodynamic constraints on selectivity and conversion, high energy input due to the endothermic nature of the process, and coke formation leading to catalytic deactivation. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by adding an oxidant to the reaction feed, which can initiate the reaction without relying solely on high temperatures. This modification can potentially overcome limitations such as side reactions and thermodynamic constraints. However, using oxygen as an oxidant presents its own set of challenges, including the overoxidation of olefins to CO and CO2 and the possibility of reaction runaway. To mitigate these issues, catalysts have been investigated, with vanadium-based oxides and mixed-metal oxides being extensively studied due to their high thermal stability, large surface areas, and favorable reducibility and basicity. Despite these advantages, current catalytic systems have not yet achieved product yields comparable to those of current industrial technologies for olefin production.

1.当前丙烯生产方法的主要挑战，如烃类裂解，包括选择性和转化率的热力学限制、由于过程的吸热性质导致的高能量输入，以及导致催化剂失活的焦炭形成。丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)通过向反应进料中添加氧化剂，可以不完全依赖高温来引发反应，从而解决了这些问题。这种修改可以潜在地克服诸如副反应和热力学限制等限制。然而，使用氧气作为氧化剂带来了自己的挑战，包括将烯烃过度氧化为CO和CO2，以及反应失控的可能性。为了缓解这些问题，已经研究了催化剂，其中基于钒的氧化物和混合金属氧化物由于其高热稳定性、大表面积和有利的还原性和碱性而被广泛研究。尽管有这些优势，目前的催化系统尚未达到与当前工业烯烃生产技术相当的产品产量。
