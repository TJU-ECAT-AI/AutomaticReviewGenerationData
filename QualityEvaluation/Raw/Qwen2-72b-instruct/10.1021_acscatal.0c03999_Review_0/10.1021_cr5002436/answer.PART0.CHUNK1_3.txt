1.The primary challenges in current propylene production methods, such as steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking, include high energy consumption, high capital costs, and the production of a wide range of co-products, which can lead to market saturation and reduced profitability. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by offering a more energy-efficient and selective route to propylene. However, ODHP presents its own set of advantages and limitations, particularly in the context of oxidant selection. Oxygen is an attractive oxidant for ODHP due to its ability to lower the reaction temperature to around 400°C and make the dehydrogenation reaction exothermic. However, the use of oxygen also introduces new challenges, such as the need to avoid overoxidation of the hydrocarbons in the feed to maintain high olefin selectivity. Carbon dioxide (CO2) is another oxidant that has been investigated for ODHP. CO2 can effectively consume hydrogen under dehydrogenation conditions, but it does not provide enough heat to compensate for the endothermic nature of the dehydrogenation reaction. The cofeeding of CO2 can also result in additional coke deposition due to the increased CO and decreased H2 partial pressures brought about by the reverse water-gas shift reaction. Moreover, CO2 competitively adsorbs on the surface, specifically on the basic sites of the catalyst materials, which can negatively affect their performance.

1.当前丙烯生产方法，如蒸汽裂解和流化催化裂化，主要面临高能耗、高资本成本以及副产品种类繁多的挑战，这可能导致市场饱和和盈利能力下降。丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)通过提供更节能、更选择性的丙烯生产途径，解决了这些问题。然而，ODHP在氧化剂选择方面具有自身的优势和局限性。氧气作为ODHP的氧化剂，因其能够将反应温度降低至约400°C并使脱氢反应放热而受到关注。然而，使用氧气也带来了新的挑战，例如需要避免原料中烃类的过度氧化，以保持高烯烃选择性。二氧化碳(CO2)是另一种用于ODHP的氧化剂。CO2可以在脱氢条件下有效消耗氢，但不能提供足够的热量来补偿脱氢反应的吸热性质。CO2的共进料还可能导致额外的焦炭沉积，这是由于逆向水煤气变换反应导致的CO增加和H2分压降低。此外，CO2在表面上竞争性吸附，特别是在催化剂材料的碱性位点，这可能对它们的性能产生负面影响。
