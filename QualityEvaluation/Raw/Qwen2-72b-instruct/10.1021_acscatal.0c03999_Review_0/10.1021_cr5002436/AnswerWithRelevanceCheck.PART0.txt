          The primary challenges in current propylene production methods, such as steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking (FCC), include high energy demands, low selectivity towards propylene, dwindling petroleum reserves, and rising oil prices. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by offering a more economical feedstock (propane) and potentially more efficient conversion technologies. However, ODHP presents its own set of advantages and limitations, particularly in the context of oxidant selection. The use of oxygen as an oxidant risks combusting the hydrocarbon reactants and products, making it challenging to control side reactions such as cracking and excessive oxidation. Mild oxidants like CO2 are preferred as they can improve catalyst activity without the risk of over-oxidation. Oxygen is an attractive oxidant for ODHP due to its ability to lower the reaction temperature to around 400°C and make the dehydrogenation reaction exothermic. However, the use of oxygen also introduces new challenges, such as the need to avoid overoxidation of the hydrocarbons in the feed to maintain high olefin selectivity. Carbon dioxide (CO2) is another oxidant that has been investigated for ODHP. CO2 can effectively consume hydrogen under dehydrogenation conditions, but it does not provide enough heat to compensate for the endothermic nature of the dehydrogenation reaction. The cofeeding of CO2 can also result in additional coke deposition due to the increased CO and decreased H2 partial pressures brought about by the reverse water-gas shift reaction. Moreover, CO2 competitively adsorbs on the surface, specifically on the basic sites of the catalyst materials, which can negatively affect their performance.

          当前丙烯生产方法，如蒸汽裂解和流化催化裂化（FCC），主要挑战包括高能耗、对丙烯的低选择性、石油储备的减少和油价上涨。丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）通过提供更经济的原料（丙烷）和可能更有效的转化技术来解决这些问题。然而，ODHP在氧化剂选择方面有其自身的一系列优势和局限性，尤其是在使用氧气作为氧化剂时，存在燃烧烃类反应物和产物的风险，使得控制裂解和过度氧化等副反应变得困难。温和的氧化剂如二氧化碳更受欢迎，因为它们可以提高催化剂活性，同时不会带来过度氧化的风险。氧气作为ODHP的氧化剂，因其能够将反应温度降低至约400°C并使脱氢反应放热而受到关注。然而，使用氧气也带来了新的挑战，例如需要避免原料中烃类的过度氧化，以保持高烯烃选择性。二氧化碳(CO2)是另一种用于ODHP的氧化剂。CO2可以在脱氢条件下有效消耗氢，但不能提供足够的热量来补偿脱氢反应的吸热性质。CO2的共进料还可能导致额外的焦炭沉积，这是由于逆向水煤气变换反应导致的CO增加和H2分压降低。此外，CO2在表面上竞争性吸附，特别是在催化剂材料的碱性位点，这可能对它们的性能产生负面影响。
