1.The primary challenges in current propylene production methods, such as steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking, include high energy consumption, high capital and operating costs, and the production of a wide range of co-products, which can lead to market saturation and reduced profitability. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by offering a more energy-efficient and selective process for propylene production. The use of oxygen as an oxidant in ODHP can lower the reaction temperature to around 400°C and make the dehydrogenation reaction exothermic, which can reduce energy consumption. However, the use of oxygen also presents challenges, such as the need to avoid overoxidation of hydrocarbons in the feed to maintain high olefin selectivity. Oxygen is a strong oxidant that can lead to the complete oxidation of hydrocarbons to carbon dioxide and water, which is undesirable in the context of propylene production. Therefore, the selection of a suitable catalyst and reaction conditions is crucial to achieve high propylene yield and selectivity in ODHP.

1.当前丙烯生产方法，如蒸汽裂解和流化催化裂化，主要面临高能耗、高资本和运营成本的挑战，以及副产品种类繁多，可能导致市场饱和和盈利能力下降。丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)通过提供更节能、更选择性的丙烯生产过程来解决这些问题。在ODHP中使用氧气作为氧化剂可以将反应温度降低到约400°C，并使脱氢反应成为放热反应，从而降低能耗。然而，使用氧气也带来了挑战，如需要避免原料中烃类的过度氧化，以保持高烯烃选择性。氧气是一种强氧化剂，可能导致烃类完全氧化为二氧化碳和水，这在丙烯生产中是不希望的。因此，在ODHP中实现高丙烯产率和选择性，选择合适的催化剂和反应条件至关重要。
