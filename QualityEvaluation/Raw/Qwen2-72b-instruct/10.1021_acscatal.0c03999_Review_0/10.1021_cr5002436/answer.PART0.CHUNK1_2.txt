1.The primary challenges in current propylene production methods, such as steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking, include high energy consumption, complex separation processes, and the production of a wide range of co-products, which can lead to fluctuations in propylene supply and price. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by offering a more direct route to propylene production, with the potential for lower energy consumption and simpler separation processes. However, ODHP presents its own set of advantages and limitations, particularly in the context of oxidant selection. Oxygen is an attractive oxidant for ODHP due to its ability to completely combust hydrogen, which can help to overcome the thermodynamic limitations of non-oxidative dehydrogenation. However, the use of oxygen also introduces new challenges, such as the need to avoid overoxidation of the hydrocarbons in the feed to maintain high olefin selectivity. Oxygen can also lead to increased coke deposition, which can negatively impact catalyst stability and performance. Additionally, the use of oxygen requires careful control of the reaction conditions to prevent safety hazards, such as the risk of explosion.

1.当前丙烯生产方法，如蒸汽裂解和流化催化裂化，主要挑战包括高能耗、复杂的分离过程以及大量副产品的产生，这可能导致丙烯供应和价格的波动。丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)通过提供更直接的丙烯生产途径，有可能降低能耗和简化分离过程，从而解决了这些问题。然而，ODHP在氧化剂选择方面具有自身的优势和局限性，尤其是在使用氧气的背景下。氧气作为ODHP的氧化剂具有吸引力，因为它能够完全燃烧氢气，这有助于克服非氧化脱氢的热力学限制。然而，使用氧气也带来了新的挑战，如需要避免原料中烃类的过度氧化，以保持高烯烃选择性。氧气还可能导致焦炭沉积增加，这可能对催化剂稳定性和性能产生负面影响。此外，使用氧气需要仔细控制反应条件，以防止安全风险，如爆炸风险。
