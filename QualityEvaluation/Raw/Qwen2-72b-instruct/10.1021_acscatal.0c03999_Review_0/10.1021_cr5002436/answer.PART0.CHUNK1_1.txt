1.The primary challenges in current propylene production methods, such as steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking, include high energy consumption, high capital costs, and the production of a wide range of co-products, which can lead to overproduction of certain hydrocarbons. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by offering a more direct route to propylene production, with potentially lower energy consumption and capital costs. However, ODHP presents its own set of advantages and limitations, particularly in the context of oxidant selection. Oxygen is an attractive oxidant for ODHP due to its ability to completely combust hydrogen, which can help to overcome the thermodynamic limitations of non-oxidative dehydrogenation. However, the use of oxygen also presents challenges, such as the need to avoid overoxidation of the hydrocarbons in the feed to maintain high olefin selectivity. Oxygen can also lead to increased coke deposition, which can negatively impact catalyst performance and stability. Therefore, finding a suitable combination of catalyst material and oxidizing agent will be pivotal in the development of an effective reaction system for the oxidative dehydrogenation of paraffins.

1.当前丙烯生产方法，如蒸汽裂解和流化催化裂化，主要挑战包括高能耗、高资本成本以及产生广泛的副产品，这可能导致某些烃类的过量生产。丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)通过提供一条更直接的丙烯生产途径，可能具有较低的能耗和资本成本，从而解决了这些问题。然而，ODHP在氧化剂选择方面，特别是使用氧气方面，也存在一系列优势和局限性。氧气作为ODHP的氧化剂具有吸引力，因为它能够完全燃烧氢气，这有助于克服非氧化脱氢的热力学限制。然而，使用氧气也带来了挑战，如需要避免原料中烃类的过度氧化，以保持高烯烃选择性。氧气还可能导致焦炭沉积增加，这可能对催化剂性能和稳定性产生负面影响。因此，找到合适的催化剂材料和氧化剂组合，对于开发有效的丙烷氧化脱氢反应系统至关重要。
