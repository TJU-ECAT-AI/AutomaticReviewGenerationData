1.The primary challenges in current propylene production methods, such as steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking, include high energy consumption, high capital costs, and the production of a wide range of co-products, which can lead to market saturation and reduced profitability. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by offering a more energy-efficient and selective process for propylene production. However, ODHP presents its own set of advantages and limitations, particularly in the context of oxidant selection. Oxygen is an attractive oxidant for ODHP due to its ability to lower the reaction temperature to around 400°C and make the dehydrogenation reaction exothermic. However, new challenges arise as overoxidation of the hydrocarbons in the feed must be avoided to maintain high olefin selectivity. CO2, being a much milder oxidant, can effectively consume H2 under dehydrogenation conditions, although it is not reactive enough to oxidize the hydrocarbons in the reaction mixture. However, much less heat is formed when CO2 is used, so the dehydrogenation reaction remains endothermic. The cofeeding of CO2 may result in additional coke deposition, due to the increased CO and decreased H2 partial pressures brought about by the reverse watergas shift reaction. On the other hand, coke may be gasified by CO2. Finally, CO2 competitively adsorbs on the surface, specifically on the basic sites of the catalyst materials, which can negatively affect their performance.

1.当前丙烯生产方法，如蒸汽裂解和流化催化裂解，主要面临高能耗、高资本成本以及副产品种类繁多的挑战，这可能导致市场饱和和盈利能力下降。丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)通过提供更节能和选择性的丙烯生产过程来解决这些问题。然而，ODHP在氧化剂选择方面具有自身的一系列优势和局限性。氧气作为ODHP的氧化剂，由于其能够将反应温度降低至约400°C，并使脱氢反应成为放热反应，因此具有吸引力。然而，新的挑战也随之产生，必须避免原料中烃类的过度氧化，以保持高烯烃选择性。二氧化碳作为一种温和的氧化剂，可以在脱氢条件下有效地消耗H2，尽管它不足以氧化反应混合物中的烃类。然而，当使用二氧化碳时，形成的热量要少得多，因此脱氢反应仍然是吸热的。二氧化碳的共给可能会导致额外的焦炭沉积，这是由于逆向水煤气变换反应导致的CO增加和H2分压降低。另一方面，焦炭可以通过二氧化碳气化。最后，二氧化碳在表面上竞争性吸附，特别是催化剂材料上的碱性位点，这可能对它们的性能产生负面影响。

1.The primary challenges in current propylene production methods, such as steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking (FCC), include high energy demands, low selectivity toward propylene, dwindling petroleum reserves, and rising oil prices. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by offering a more economical feedstock (propane) and potentially more efficient conversion technologies. However, ODHP presents its own set of advantages and limitations, particularly in the context of oxidant selection. The use of oxygen as an oxidant risks combusting the hydrocarbon reactants and products, making it challenging to control side reactions such as cracking and excessive oxidation of reaction products. Relatively mild oxidants, such as CO2, are preferred as they can improve the activity of chromium dehydrogenation catalysts by removing the evolved hydrogen through the reverse water gas shift reaction, effectively shifting the equilibrium toward product formation, without oxidizing catalytically active Cr3+ species to catalytically inactive Cr5+ or Cr6+ species.

1.当前丙烯生产方法，如蒸汽裂解和流化催化裂化（FCC），主要挑战包括高能耗、对丙烯的选择性低、石油储备减少和油价上涨。丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）通过提供更经济的原料（丙烷）和潜在更高效的转化技术来解决这些问题。然而，ODHP在氧化剂选择方面具有自身的优势和局限性，特别是使用氧气作为氧化剂时，可能会燃烧烃类反应物和产物，使得控制裂解和反应产物过度氧化等副反应变得具有挑战性。相对温和的氧化剂，如CO2，被优选使用，因为它们可以提高铬脱氢催化剂的活性，通过逆向水煤气变换反应去除产生的氢气，有效地将平衡向产物形成的方向移动，而不会将催化活性Cr3+物种氧化为催化不活性的Cr5+或Cr6+物种。

1.The primary challenges in current propylene production methods, such as steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking, include high energy consumption, high capital costs, and the production of a wide range of co-products, which can lead to overproduction of certain hydrocarbons. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by offering a more direct route to propylene production, with potentially lower energy consumption and capital costs. However, ODHP presents its own set of advantages and limitations, particularly in the context of oxidant selection. Oxygen is an attractive oxidant for ODHP due to its ability to completely combust hydrogen, which can help to overcome the thermodynamic limitations of non-oxidative dehydrogenation. However, the use of oxygen also presents challenges, such as the need to avoid overoxidation of the hydrocarbons in the feed to maintain high olefin selectivity. Oxygen can also lead to increased coke deposition, which can negatively impact catalyst performance and stability. Therefore, finding a suitable combination of catalyst material and oxidizing agent will be pivotal in the development of an effective reaction system for the oxidative dehydrogenation of paraffins.

1.当前丙烯生产方法，如蒸汽裂解和流化催化裂化，主要挑战包括高能耗、高资本成本以及产生广泛的副产品，这可能导致某些烃类的过量生产。丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)通过提供一条更直接的丙烯生产途径，可能具有较低的能耗和资本成本，从而解决了这些问题。然而，ODHP在氧化剂选择方面，特别是使用氧气方面，也存在一系列优势和局限性。氧气作为ODHP的氧化剂具有吸引力，因为它能够完全燃烧氢气，这有助于克服非氧化脱氢的热力学限制。然而，使用氧气也带来了挑战，如需要避免原料中烃类的过度氧化，以保持高烯烃选择性。氧气还可能导致焦炭沉积增加，这可能对催化剂性能和稳定性产生负面影响。因此，找到合适的催化剂材料和氧化剂组合，对于开发有效的丙烷氧化脱氢反应系统至关重要。

Carbon dioxide (CO2) is another oxidant that has been investigated for ODHP. CO2 can effectively consume hydrogen under dehydrogenation conditions, but it does not provide enough heat to compensate for the endothermic nature of the dehydrogenation reaction. The cofeeding of CO2 can also result in additional coke deposition due to the increased CO and decreased H2 partial pressures brought about by the reverse water-gas shift reaction. Moreover, CO2 competitively adsorbs on the surface, specifically on the basic sites of the catalyst materials, which can negatively affect their performance.
