1.The literature does not provide specific information on the primary challenges in current propylene production methods, the advantages and limitations of oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP), or the specific challenges associated with using oxygen as an oxidant. However, it does mention that propene (C3H6) is mainly produced by the steam cracking of oil-derived naphtha or the direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH). As a promising alternative, the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP), has gathered significant attention owing to its thermodynamic favorability characterized by low reaction temperatures and suppression of coking. However, the commercialization of the ODHP process has not been achieved because of the runaway over-oxidation of olefins leading to significant amounts of COx.

1.文献没有提供关于当前丙烯生产方法的主要挑战、氧化脱氢丙烷(ODHP)的优势和局限性，以及使用氧气作为氧化剂的具体挑战的具体信息。但是，它确实提到丙烯(C3H6)主要由石油衍生的石脑油的蒸汽裂解或丙烷的直接脱氢(PDH)产生。作为一种有前景的替代方案，丙烷的氧化脱氢(ODHP)因其热力学上的有利性而受到广泛关注，其特征是低反应温度和抑制焦化。然而，由于烯烃的过度氧化导致大量COx的产生，ODHP工艺的商业化尚未实现。
