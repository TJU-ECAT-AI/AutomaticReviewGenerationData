Abstract 
Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane in the presence of carbon dioxide (ODPC) is a sustainable 
approach and an attractive catalytic route for propylene production with less environmental 
footprint than the conventional oxidative dehydrogenation path with oxygen. Researchers have 
considered CO2 as a mild oxidant that can overcome the problems of over-oxidation and low 
propylene selectivity. This article provides a critical review on the current mechanistic 
understanding of three different catalyst types used in the ODPC reaction based on experimental 
studies; (i) zeolites with different frameworks, (ii) porous materials-supported metal oxides, and 
(iii) transition metal oxides and other metal catalysts. A detailed review of the literature 
compares the framework, pore structure, nature of active sites, reducibility, and the role of 
promoters and supports for each type of catalytic materials in the absence and presence of CO2, 
and is followed by a thorough discussion on the promotional effects of CO2 as a soft oxidant on 
C–H bond scission. Future directions with respect to materials design, synthesis and reaction 
conditions are also discussed.

1. Introduction and motivation 
Selective dehydrogenation of propane to propylene is one of the major challenges for 
production of valuable and versatile chemical feedstocks. The current industrial on-purpose 
propylene production through dehydrogenation of ethane and propane is non-oxidative in nature 
and is contributing to quick catalyst deactivation, low conversion and selectivity, and high 
reaction temperatures [1]. The current state-of-the-art research has primary focused on 
investigating the synergistic effects between gas phase oxidants and alkanes in order to 
overcome the hindrances in current industrial dehydrogenation reactions [2–5]. It is established 
that catalytic oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) reactions are sensitive to specific oxidants [6,7]. 
A number of oxidants such as oxygen [6,8], nitrous oxide [6,9] and carbon dioxide [10,11] have 
been considered as co-feed in propane dehydrogenation reactions. Although, oxidative 
dehydrogenation of propane (ODP) in the presence of molecular O2, as an oxidizing agent, 
favors low temperature reactions and is exothermic with no thermodynamic limitations [12,13], 
deep oxidation of propane and propylene to COx is a major drawback, which often results in loss 
of propylene selectivity and yield [13–15]. To address these issues, an alternative approach has 
been proposed by which O2 is replaced with a milder oxidant such as CO2 to convert propane to 
propylene over various heterogeneous catalysts.  
Most experts studying the global ecosystem and climate suggest that rising anthropogenic 
CO2 emissions have contributed to significant global climate change in the last half-century [16–
21]. The development of effective strategies that convert such CO2 emissions into energy, fuels, 
and chemicals are greatly preferable to oceanic or geologic sequestration options because they 
offer the potential to create new commercially-viable products from renewable carbon feedstock 
in a sustainable manner [2,22–24]. However, CO2 is a thermodynamically stable molecule 
4 
 
(ΔGf = -394 kJmol−1) with a high oxidation state, hence, reactions of CO2 must be combined 
with a high-energy reactant, effective catalysts and reaction conditions to gain a thermodynamic 
driving force [24,25]. 
The objective of this paper is to provide a critical review of the state-of-the-art materials that 
have been investigated for catalyzing the ODP reaction with CO2 (ODPC) in order to establish a 
useful guideline for extrapolating and normalizing the reported ODPC reaction data to identify 
correlations between catalyst properties and performance. Among heterogeneous catalysts 
studied for the ODPC reaction so far, zeolites with the MFI and CHA frameworks, chromium-
[26,27], platinum-[28,29], vanadium-[6,30] and gallium-based catalysts [31,32] are found to be 
the most efficient materials mainly due to their high activity and easy regeneration [33,34]. 
Literature shows that the catalytic activity of these materials depends upon various factors 
including the nature of support [10], promoters [35], and the synthesis procedures [36,37]. 
Therefore, in this review, we will focus on reviewing the effects of CO2 partial pressure, acid-
based properties and porosity of different zeolites, metal oxides reducibility and bifunctional 
catalysts (i.e., metal-supported zeolites) on the conversion of propane, selectivity of propylene, 
and the kinetics of the ODPC reaction. In addition, the effect of process conditions on the ODPC 
reaction is discussed and future research directions are provided.  
2. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane with O2 and CO2  
Despite the extra ordinary effect of molecular O2 (exothermicity and equilibrium support 
effect), deep oxidation of products has been confirmed even at small doses of O2, resulting in 
reduced selectivity to propylene. Aside from this deep oxidation, the high exothermicity of O2 
generates great amount of energy that must be removed [1,13,31]. In general, the major 
drawback of ODP with O2 is that the propylene yield is typically low on a laboratory scale, as 
5 
 
stated above, and that the role of catalysts and their fast deactivation in the presence of O2 are not 
well-understood [12,13,38]. For instance, by reviewing the literature in the period of 1995–2017, 
the best propylene yield of 40% has been reported for ODP with O2 which is still far from 
industrial implementation and the information concerning the catalyst lifetime appeares quite 
limited [1,13,27,39–42]. The scale-up of catalytic materials and/or reactor configurations capable 
of maintaining high selectivity to propylene under conditions leading to high propane conversion 
is another aspect that has been often overlooked.  
A comprehensive review of the literature on the dehydrogenation of light alkanes that covers 
exclusively metal and metal-oxide catalysts has been undertaken by Sattler et al. [1]. Their 
review provided a summary of parameters including nature of active sites, type of supports and 
promoters, and feed composition, affecting the catalytic properties and lifetime of systems based 
on GaOx, VOx, MoOx, Pt and Pt-Sn, and CrOx supported catalysts [1]. In other reviews, Pt-based 
catalysts have been discussed from the perspective of catalyst design [43], mass transfer 
limitations, and the influence of hydrogen combustion on olefin yield [44]. Albonetti et al. [45] 
discussed the chemistry of vanadium in ODP reaction in their review. Cavani et al. [38] 
compiled a review on over 100 catalysts with different active phases for the ODP reaction with 
O2 as a co-feed. In that review, features of catalysts with remarkable performance, reaction 
network of partial and total oxidation, and the influence of homogenous gas phase reactions on 
the formation of olefins in ODH of alkanes were covered [38]. Recently, Carrero et al. [13] 
reviewed the kinetics of ODP over VOx catalysts with the focus on the effects of catalyst 
synthesis method, molecular structure of supported vanadium oxide species, reaction 
mechanism, and structure-activity relationship of the vanadium-based catalysts.

Several other reviews exist on the ODH of alkanes with CO2. For instance, Krylov et al. [46] 
reviewed the oxidation of hydrocarbons and alcohols with CO2 over manganese oxide catalysts 
in 1995. The authors concluded that manganese oxide-based catalysts are active, selective, and 
do not form a carbon layer during the reaction in dry reforming of methane and oxidative 
dehydrogenation of C2–C7 hydrocarbons and the lower alcohols. Another mini-review by Wang 
et al. [40] discussed dry reforming of methane and dehydrogenation of light alkanes in the 
presence of CO2, more than a decade and half ago. The information in that review was limited to 
CH4, with no in-depth discussion on C2H6 and C3H8 conversion and no consideration of 
microporous materials such as zeolites [40]. Other notable reviews on the use of CO2 as a mild 
oxidant for the dehydrogenation of alkanes, especially ethylbenzene and methane in the presence 
of CO2 have been provided by Ansari and Park [2] and Kawi et al. [24].   
3. Thermodynamic analysis of dehydrogenation of light alkanes with CO2 
Recently, the use of CO2 in oxidative dehydrognation of light alkanes has received 
significant attention as it has been shown to shift the ODH reaction toward more olefin 
production compared to molecular O2 by preventing deep oxidation of the reaction products and 
as a coke removal agent from the catalyst [47,48]. As shown in Fig. 1, the Gibbs free energy 
changes of CO2 (ΔrGθm) reaction becomes increasingly favorable by moving towards higher alkanes.  
 
Recently, Edwards et al. [25] investigated the effect of temperature and CO2 on the Gibbs free 
energy for dehydrogenation of light alkanes from 300-500 °C and reported that although all ODH 
reactions of light alkanes with CO2 show a similar trend, ethane dehydrogenation displays the 
highest ΔrGθm (Fig. 1), indicating that it is much harder to operate this reaction as compared to 
propane and butane dehydrogenation reactions at 300-500 °C. Furthermore, the dehydrogenation of 
7 
 
propane with CO2 was more favorable than n-butane but less feasible than i-butane, as shown in Fig. 
2. The butane has multiple curves because of its constituent isomers. Therefore, ΔrGθm does not keep 
falling as the carbon number of alkane increases and lower value of ΔrGθm indicates a higher 
possibility of cracking. The authors also studied the ΔrGθm of light alkanes and olefins cracking to 
generate carbon and H2 and found that (i) olefins show a much higher cracking possibility than 
alkanes, (ii) propylene has a much higher resistance to cracking than any isomers of butane, (ii) the 
selectivity of the target products is significantly affected by further cracking of the olefin. As can be 
seen from Fig. 3a, although ethylene has higher resistance to subsequent cracking compared to 
propylene, it is more difficult for ethane to be activated with CO2 when the temperature is kept below 
500 °C (Fig. 3a). Therefore, from thermodynamics perspective, the ODPC is the best 
dehydrogenation pathway below 500 °C in comparison to other alkanes. 
  
In general, alkanes dehydrogenation reactions with CO2 are very complicated because they 
are thermodynamically limited at low temperatures and high pressures. Much of the discussion is 
presented in terms of ODPC since the dehydrogenation mechanisms and kinetics of other alkanes 
such as ethane, butanes and ethylbenzene are not quite different [2,4,5,24,37,46]. Propane 
interaction with CO2 can proceed on different catalysts by various reaction pathways and 
associated side reactions, as presented in eqs. 1-9. The production of hydrogen in the non-
oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (eq. 1) limits the conversion of the propane by shifting the 
thermodynamic equilibrium to the reactant side [49,50]. However, by coupling this reaction with 
CO2 through the reverse water-gas shift (RWGS) reaction (eq. 2) [36,51,52] the imposed 
limitation is removed by shifting the equilibrium position to the product side, thereby increasing 
the yield of propylene [10,27,36]. Moreover, the RWGS reaction accelerates the formation of the 
8 
 
dehydrogenation products by transforming H2 with CO2 into CO and H2O, while promoting 
desorption of ethylene from the catalyst surface [53,54]. It has also been accepted that CO2 
directly participates in the ODP reaction (eq. 3) which further enhances the propylene formation 
(ODPC). In addition, CO2 can stabilize the catalyst by eliminating coke through the reverse 
Boudouard reaction (eq. 4) [54,55]. Nonetheless, dry reforming of propane (eq. 5) which 
produces syngas (CO/H2) may take place as a competing side reaction, although such a reaction 
is highly endothermic (ΔH298K = + 620 kJmol−1) and preferentially takes place at high 
temperatures [56–58]. In addition, depending on the type of catalyst used, other side reactions 
such as propane cracking and hydrogenolysis reactions (eqs. 6-9) become dominant at high 
temperatures where thermodynamics favor conversions, and thus selectivity toward the desired 
product (i.e. propylene) decreases [54,59–61].

Although ODPC reaction is endothermic in nature (ΔH298K = + 164 kJmol−1) as opposed to 
ODP with O2 (ΔH298K = - 120 kJmol−1), in this reaction CO2 will be a great co-feed from both an 
economic and ecological point of view. This is mainly because CO2 can serve myriad purposes by 
enhancing equilibrium conversion of light alkanes by removing hydrogen through the RWGS 
reaction (eq. 2) [62], acting as an agent for coke removal through the reverse Boudouard reaction 
(eq. 4) [31,62], and ensuring recycling of greenhouse gas, and eliminating deep oxidation 
[14,27,34,36,63].  
Through thermodynamic calculations, Michorczyk et al. [37] noted that the syngas 
composition (CO/H2 molar ratio) and the yield of C3H6 can be manipulated by changing the 
molar ratio of CO2 to C3H8 in the feed and reaction temperature, as shown in Fig. 4a-b. It is 
apparent from Fig. 4a that the equilibrium CO/H2 ratio increases significantly with the amount of 
CO2 in the feed, but decreases approximately linearly with temperature, except for the CO2/C3H8 
ratio of 5 where the equilibrium syngas ratio demonstrates a nearly quadratic relationship with 
temperature. However, as shown in Fig. 4b, the yield of C3H6 increases drastically with both 
temperature and CO2/C3H8 molar ratio, with significantly higher yields at a feed ratio of 5. One 
can therefore expect to achieve higher C3H6 yield in the ODPC reaction at low temperatures by 
10 
 
simply varying the CO2/C3H8 feed molar ratio. Nonetheless, the negative effect of CO2 
displacing ethane adsorbed on the catalyst surface has also been reported [53].  
 
4. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane with CO2 (ODPC)  
With the expected high future demand for propylene, commercialization of oxidative 
dehydrogenation reactions that uses CO2 will not only meet the demand for propylene, it will 
also go a long way to support combatting climate change. As pointed out earlier, the nature of 
CO2 interaction differs from catalyst to catalyst. The RWGS reaction can proceed only when 
both H2 and CO2 are adsorbed on the catalyst surface. Therefore, an effective catalyst for ODPC 
should have affinity for both CO2 and C-H over C-C bond cleavage to avoid side reactions. 
Moreover, as CO2 is slightly acidic, it would preferentially adsorb onto the basic sites of catalyst 
while propane and H2 adsorb on the acidic sites, thus a balance of acidity and basicity is required 
to avoid unwanted side and secondary reactions including propane hydrogenolysis, thermos and 
catalytic cracking, and isomerization reaction.  
To date, unusual contrasting effects of CO2 on the performance of catalyst supports used in 
ODP have been reported. These contrasting effects are not clarified and researchers have not yet 
reached a conclusion on the exact role of CO2 in the propane dehydrogenation reaction. For 
instance, Nakagawa et al. [31] proposed that CO2 promotes desorption of propylene product 
from the catalyst surface while Michorczyk et al. [64] found that CO2 consumes H2 via the 
RWGS reaction. For Ga2O3/TiO2, CO2 is consumed mainly through the RWGS reaction, which 
may account for the enhancement of the dehydrogenation activity, whereas for Ga2O3/ZrO2, the 
main role of CO2 is the elimination of coke, which may account for the enhancement of stability 
of the catalyst after the addition of CO2 [56,65]. This can be attributed to the higher density of 
11 
 
surface basicity due to terminal hydroxyl groups (strong Lewis acidity of Zr4+ and the Lewis 
basicity of O2- pairs) on ZrO2 structure that results in higher CO2 adsorption and consequently 
coke elimination through reverse Boudourd reaction [66,67]. Contrary observations were made 
in the case of Al2O3 [66,67]. Therefore, in the design and development of new materials for the 
ODPC reaction, the interaction of CO2 with catalyst active sites should be thoroughly 
investigated through in-situ or ex-situ experimental measurements and/or theoretical studies. In 
this section, we will review the ODPC reaction over various heterogeneous catalysts. 
4.1. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane with CO2 over zeolites  
The catalytic performance of a zeolite is largely dictated by its framework topology, particle 
size, and acidity [68–73]. Mass transport to and from the active sites located within the 
micropores of the zeolite is usually slow, which results  in longer residence time that could 
increase propylene oligomerization and coke formation [74,75]. It is a wide consensus that 
propane dehydrogenation activities occur on acid sites of zeolite. Also, the SiO2/Al2O3 ratio 
plays a major role in both the zeolite physicochemical and reactivity properties [76–80]. The 
inverted mordenite framework (MFI) zeolites such as HZSM-5 and mesoporous silica materials 
(e.g. MCM-41 [81], SBA-1 [26], SBA-15 [73] and MSU-x [82]) provide a two-dimensional 
channel network intersecting microchannels with a 5-6 Å size. These materials have been widely 
evaluated in ODH of light alkanes with CO2. Zhang et al. [83] prepared Na-HZSM-5 with 400 
nm (HZSM-5-S) and 2 μm (HZSM-5-L) crystal sizes impregnated with chromium oxide and 
utilized for ODPC reaction at 550 oC. The sub-microsize catalyst (ca. 400 nm) exhibited 
substantially higher activity than HZSM-5 with larger crystal size (ca. 2 μm). In addition, the 
authors studied the promotional effect of promoters such as Cr+6 in the presence and absence of 
CO2 over HZSM-5 catalysts for the ODP reaction. The initial propane conversion and propylene 
12 
 
selectivity were 48.3% and 86.0% over Cr/HZSM-5-S and 11.3% and 92.8% over and Cr/ 
HZSM-5-L, respectively. After 8 h on stream, these values decreased to 30.1% and 91.8% for the 
former catalyst and 8.4% and 94.1% for the later catalyst, respectively. Combined Raman, 
diffuse reflectance UV–Vis, XPS, and H2-TPR results demonstrated that the sub-microsize 
catalyst has much higher concentration of surface Cr6+ species than the microsize catalyst, which 
accounts for its superior catalytic performance. In addition to the coke formation, the reduction 
of monochromate Cr6+ to polychromates Cr3+ affected the catalyst deactivation and that the 
catalyst can be regenerated by re-oxidizing Cr3+ and burning carbon deposits. 
The effect of surface acidity on the performance of zeolites in the ODPC reaction has been 
investigated by several research groups. As shown in Fig. 5, with increasing Si/Al ratio of 
HZSM-5 supported Ga2O3, the activity of the catalyst decreased but the selectivity increased 
comparably [84]. The decrease in BrØnsted acidity was much higher than that of Lewis acidity 
due to the fact that Lewis acidity is associated with Ga2O3 while BrØnsted acidity is associated 
with HZSM-5, thus removing the aluminum from HZSM-5 consequently decreases the BrØnsted 
acidity. In the same study, Ren et al. [84] reported the catalytic performance of Ga2O3 supported 
HZSM-48 catalysts for ODPC reaction. The performance with changing Si/Al ratio was similar 
to the above observations, however, Ga2O3/HZSM-48 with Si/Al ratio of 130 showed the best 
propylene yield of 22.2%. The selectivity of propylene on Ga2O3/HZSM-48 was higher than that 
over Ga2O3/HZSM-5, especially at low propane conversion, due to its weaker acidity. However, 
the stability on Ga2O3/HZSM-48 was lower compared to Ga2O3/HZSM-5, which may be caused 
by its abundant weak acid sites and unidimensional pore structure. 
 
13 
 
In another investigation, Ren et al. [26] reported similar observations for the effect of Si/Al 
ratio on the behavior of HZSM-5 supported ZnO catalysts in ODPC reaction. The initial activity 
of ZnO/HZSM-5 catalysts decreased with increasing the Si/Al ratio, while stability and 
propylene selectivity were both enhanced during ODPC reaction (Fig. 6). The ZnO/HZSM-5 
with Si/Al = 160 displayed the best performance with a propane conversion of 41.5% and 
propylene yield of 25.8% at steady state reaction. The enhancement of the catalyst stability with 
increasing the Si/Al ratio of the HZSM-5 support was ascribed to the decrease of the acidity of 
the catalysts, which led to the suppression of the side reactions such as cracking, 
oligomerization, and aromatization.  
 
In another study, Zhu et al. [85] evaluated the ODPC reaction over a series of Cr-based 
catalysts supported on MFI zeolitic materials. The catalysts Cr/silicalite-1 and Cr/H[B]MFI were 
prepared by the impregnation method, while Cr/H[B]MFI was further treated by steaming. 
Significantly higher activity was obtained for Cr/H[B]MFI than Cr/silicalite-1, and steamed 
Cr/H[B]MFI was superior in the reaction stability to Cr/H[B]MFI. It was suggested that the 
boron present in the framework modified the nature of introduced Cr species and the steaming 
process resulted in auto-reduction of some Cr6+ to Cr3+ on Cr/H[B]MFI. The enhanced stability 
of the steam-treated catalyst was associated to Cr3+ oxide species, which are perceived to be 
more reactive than Cr3+ from reduced Cr6+. The list of metal supported MFI catalysts for ODPC 
reaction as well as the catalytic evaluation results and the corresponding reference papers are 
summarized in Table 1.  
 
Several recent investigations have indicated that Cr-containing mesoporous sieves have 
excellent catalytic activity in ODPC reaction [26,88,89]. Michorczyk et al. [26,88] incorporated 
14 
 
various amounts of chromium (1-15wt%) into SBA-1 to make a series of Cr/SBA-1 catalysts 
with highly ordered cubic structure and high specific surface area (SBET > 900 m2g-1) up to Cr/Si 
= 0.06 atomic ratio. Their observations and that of Baek et al. [89] confirmed that activity of the 
catalysts increased with Cr content to an optimum loading of 4.3 wt%, as shown in Fig. 7. 
Unlike the regular wet impregnation process in which the Cr sits on the surface and pore mouths 
of the support, the incorporation method enhanced the distribution of the Cr species within the 
channels and framework of the catalyst, thereby increasing the BET surface area. The 
dehydrogenation activity was shown to be proportional to the number of redox chromium 
species. Michorczyk’s group [26] further investigated the characteristics of Cr/SBA-1 using in-
situ UV–vis DR analysis. Results obtained during ODPC reaction revealed that the Cr6+ species 
were already reduced rapidly at the beginning of the process. On the basis of their obtained 
results, the authors concluded that the resultant Cr2+ and Cr3+ species trigger redox cycles 
responsible for high catalytic activity of the Cr/SBA-1 materials.  
  
Digging deeper into the effect of metal promoters on catalytic performance of zeolites, 
researchers have found that Sn added to Pt-HZSM-5 reduces coke formation by suppressing side 
reactions [90]. As a consequence, it increases catalyst stability, dispersion of Pt by its 
geometrical effect and the catalyst activity. As shown in Table 2, the addition of Na, La, and Mg 
can neutralize the strong acid sites on the surface of the catalysts and improve the synergy 
between the metals and the zeolite support [91]. Zhang et al. [60] confirmed these claims in their 
work where they co-impregnated Pt and Sn in HZSM-5 and further impregnated it with different 
amounts of K for propane dehydrogenation in the absence of CO2. Characterization results 
confirmed that the addition of K improved the dispersion of Pt and the interaction between Pt 
15 
 
and Sn, while decreased the amount of acid sites in the catalyst. This led to improved activity, 
selectivity, and stability of the catalysts, but the performance was deteriorated past an optimum 
composition (ca. 0.8 wt% K), after which the activity and stability of the catalyst began to 
dwindle. At this composition of K, conversion as high as 33% with yield and selectivity of 30% 
and 91.43%, respectively, were obtained, which were higher than those over PtSn/HZSM-5 with 
27.5% conversion, 12% yield and 37.3% selectivity after 8 h time on stream.  Ren et al. [86] 
observed similar effects of Si/Al ratio in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane in the absence of 
CO2 using Ga2O3 supported ZSM-5 catalysts. The initial activity of Ga2O3/M-HZSM-5 catalysts 
decreased with increasing the Si/Al ratio, while enhancing stability and propylene selectivity 
during ODP reaction (Fig. 8). The Ga2O3/M-HZSM-5 with Si/Al = 240 catalyst exhibited the 
best performance with a propane conversion of 54% and propylene selectivity of 41% at steady 
state reaction. The list of metal supported MFI materials for ODP reaction as well as the catalytic 
evaluation results and the corresponding reference papers are summarized in Table 2. 
Zhang et al. [93] recently incorporated Zn into the framework of HZSM-5 by hydrothermal 
synthesis and used it as a support for Pt catalysts. Interestingly, the use of this Zn containing 
HZSM-5 resulted in the strong interactions between Pt and the support, thus leading to higher 
resistance towards reduction. PtNa/Zn (1.0%)-HZSM-5 exhibited the highest catalytic behavior 
with initial activity of 40.60% and the lowest deactivation parameter (7.3%) after reaction time 
of 10 h. However, with the increasing content of Zn. The formation of the PtZn alloy decreased 
the Pt dispersion and modified the metallic phase, which led to the decreased reaction activity 
and stability. Furthermore, the impregnation process decreased the surface area of zeolite 
catalysts due to pore blockages by the metal precursors [93]. Moreover, the introduction of metal 
into the framework of zeolites increased the surface area of zeolite support due to the formation 
16 
 
of small crystal sizes. The same group [98] had earlier reported similar behavior of isomorphous 
substitution of Sn in HZSM-5 and used it as a support for dispersing PtNa metals catalysts. In 
comparison with the conventional impregnated PtNa/HZSM-5 and PtSnNa/HZSM-5 catalysts, 
the Sn-modified HZSM-5-based Pt catalyst exhibited higher propane reaction activity and 
stability. Furthermore, it showed the lowest deactivation parameter (6.2%) and exhibited a 
selectivity to propylene higher than 98% with the corresponding propane conversion of about 
39.0% after the reaction for 9 h [98]. At time on stream of l75 h, selectivity of 98.6% and yield 
of 30% were reported [98]. In a later investigation by the same group [97], it was demonstrated 
that calcining a La-doped PtSnNa/HZSM-5 can reduce dealumination of the HZSM-5 support 
and strengthen the interaction between Pt and Sn oxide, thereby resulting in improved 
performance of the catalyst in dehydrogenation of propane to propylene. In contrast to the 
catalyst without the calcination of La, the treatments in the range of 500-650 oC resulted in the 
strong interaction between La species and the support, thus suppressing the dealumination of the 
support and increasing interactions between Sn species and the support as well as Pt and Sn 
oxides. In the propane dehydrogenation test, the catalyst calcined at 650 oC of La showed the 
best reaction activity and stability. The average yield of propylene was about 34.3% over 82 h 
for the reaction of propane dehydrogenation at 590 oC. However, after the thermal treatment of 
La at 700 oC, a sharp decrease in catalyst acidity due to severe dealumination was observed. 
Meanwhile, sintering of Pt particles and the formation of Sn0 species were found, which resulted 
in the deactivation of catalyst. In another investigation, the effect of CO2 on the conversion of 
propane over Cr/MCM-41 catalysts was reported by Takehira et al [36]. It was found that both 
C3H8 conversion and C3H6 yield increased two folds in presence of CO2 (Fig. 9). The catalyst 
17 
 
activity gradually decreased in presence and absence of CO2 during the reaction over the Cr-
MCM-41, indicating catalyst deactivation. 
 
 
Nawaz and coworkers [92] compared the effect of Sn and Pt on the dehydrogenation 
properties of SAPO-34, a silicoaluminophosphate having chabazite (CHA) pore topology, and 
HZSM-5. Pt-Sn/SAPO-34 showed improved performance with propylene selectivity > 94% and 
23% yield, whereas PtSn/HZSM-5 displayed high conversion but low selectivity to propylene 
(about 40 wt%) due to strong BrØnsted acidity and its large pore sizes, which favor cracking. 
The high activity of HZSM-5 was attributed to high surface acidity, which makes it active for 
propane dehydrogenation. Deactivation of HZSM-5 was more than 30% greater than SAPO-34 
for the ODPC reaction. In addition, regeneration of HZSM-5 supported catalyst led to 
dealumination because its structure is aluminum-based while SAPO-34 is hydrothermally stable 
and its structure is Si-based with pore size comparable to propylene, favoring selectivity. In 
another study, Nawaz et al. [99] found that the concentration of Pt active sites was higher at the 
calcination temperature of 500 oC, which they indicated has superior activity. However, with 
calcination at 400 oC, directly anchored Pt sites increased, while with a calcination at 600 oC, 
metal sintering and reduction in Pt-Sn and Sn-support interactions resulted in lower 
dehydrogenation activity. Propane dehydrogenation over various SAPO-34 supported metal 
catalysts is listed in Table 3. 
Recently, Kim et al. [100] grew micrometer-thin SAPO-34 zeolite membranes on α-alumina 
tubular supports and used them for propane dehydrogenation reaction at 600 °C. Propylene 
selectivities greater than 80% and propane conversions of 65−75% at weight hourly space 
18 
 
velocities of 0.1-0.5 h-1 were reported (Fig. 10). The efficient removal of produced hydrogen in 
the ODP reaction by the membranes was responsible for the high performance.  
 
It is generally believed that the access to active sites of zeolites differs considerably due to 
various crystal structures but this class of porous materials can also be used as metal oxide 
supports in development of bifunctional catalysts (metals and zeolite composite) for ODPC 
reaction. In order to avoid side reactions, the acidity and oxidizing ability of the bifunctional 
catalysts should be optimized. The motivation for replacing aluminum in MFI or CHA zeolite 
structures by other elements arose from the need to adjust acid-base and redox properties to 
intended applications as well as mechanical properties, however, this type of composite materials 
have not been studied in detail for ODPC reaction. Furthermore, the dynamics of non-framework 
species under reaction conditions that involve redox process, adsorption of reactants/products, 
and electrical conductivity variations, that are affecting the reaction mechanism and subsequently 
the way they contribute to catalytic reactions are not yet fully understood. With the ability to 
fine-tune the structural, topological, and surface properties, the zeolitic materials appear to offer 
a great opportunity for developing advanced bifunctional materials that overcome the problems 
of current materials and show high activity and stability in the ODPC reaction. Indeed, this 
should be considered as one of the central issues of future research in this field. 
4.2. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane with CO2 over metal oxide-based catalysts  
To date, several metal oxides such as CrOx, VOx, FeOx, MoOx, GaOx, and InOx deposited on 
the surface of various mesoporous and/or microporous supports including SiO2, Al2O3, TiO2, 
ZrO2, CeO, NbO5, MgO, zeolites, and carboneous materials have been most frequently reported 
as dehydrogenation catalysts for paraffinic C-H bond activation [29,36,38,101–116]. The 
19 
 
relatively high catalytic activity of transition metal oxides is attributed to their reducible nature 
and their ability to easily change their oxidation state. Apart from structural and physicochemical 
properties, the method in which the metal oxide is deposited onto a support and metal-support 
interaction can have significant influence on the performance of the final catalyst in the ODH of 
light alkanes. In the following sections, we will review the catalytic behavior of chromium-, 
vanadium-, gallium-, and indium-based oxide catalysts in OPDC reaction. 
    
4.2.1. Chromium-based catalysts 
It is a broad consensus that the ODP reaction over chromium-based catalysts follows the 
Mars-Van Krevelen mechanism [38,112,113]. During this phase of the reaction process, Cr6+ 
reduces to Cr3+ or Cr2+ species that are responsible for the ODH reaction [33,117]. The fraction 
of the reducible species depends primarily on the support type, coverage level and chromium 
dispersion [90]. At a low Cr content, where a high dispersion is expected, migration of Cr3+ 
species to stable Cr2O3 clusters is slow, therefore Cr3+ may be further reduced to Cr2+ [117]. 
However, the dispersion is lower at a high Cr content, therefore the reduction stops at Cr2O3 
[117]. Shishido and his colleagues [36] used Cr K-edge XAFS spectra and TPR profiles to 
confirm that the redox cycle between Cr6+ and Cr(VI)O4 has an important role in the 
dehydrogenation of C3H8 over both Cr/SiO2 and Cr/Al2O3 catalysts, regardless of the support. 
According to their study, CO2 oxidizes a part of Cr3+ to Cr6+ species under the reaction 
conditions. As a result, in the case of Cr/SiO2, the oxidative dehydrogenation of C3H8 over Cr6+ 
species takes place in addition to the simple dehydrogenation over Cr3+ species. Fig. 11 shows 
the proposed mechanism for dehydrogenation over chromium-based catalysts. The Cr6+ species 
was found to be crucial for high activity in the ODPC reaction. The rate of propylene formation 
20 
 
increased almost proportionally with the concentration of Cr6+ species in the calcined catalysts. 
According to this mechanism, at the beginning of the ODP reaction, the reduction of Cr6+ species 
generates dispersed Cr3+ and Cr2+ sites that participate in non-oxidative pathway of propylene 
formation. In the presence of CO2, Cr3+ and Cr2+ sites may participate additionally in an 
alternative oxidative pathway of propylene formation and in a consumption of hydrogen 
produced in the ODP by RWGS reaction.  
 
Wu et al. [33] recently investigated a series of Cr2O3–ZrO2 mixed oxides prepared by the  
hydrothermal method at 180 oC for ODPC reaction. The reaction was carried out at 550 oC with 
2.5 vol% C3H8, 5 vol% CO2, and a balance of N2. The catalyst prepared from a hydrothermal 
treatment gave rise to an initial propane conversion of 53.3%, which was 1.6 times that of the 
conventional Cr2O3-ZrO2. The enhanced activity of the hydrothermally prepared catalysts was 
attributed to higher surface area and higher concentration of Cr6+ than Cr3+ since Cr6+ species are 
more active in the reaction. In the absence of CO2, conversion of 76.5%, selectivity of 60.3%, 
and turn over frequency (TOF) of 14.8×104 s-1 were obtained within 10 min, but both conversion 
and TOF values quickly dropped to 3% and 0.6×104 s-1, respectively, while selectivity reached 
97.4% within 6 h reaction time with 9 wt% coke deposition. In the presence of CO2 however, the 
same behavior was observed in which initial conversion and TOF experienced a dropped from 
53.3% and 10.3×104 s-1 to 27.7% and 5.4×104 s-1 respectively, while selectivity showed an 
enhancement from 79% to 90.8% in the same 6 h reaction time 2.7 wt% coking [33]. The lower 
initial conversion of C3H8 in the presence of CO2 was correlated to competitive adsorption of 
CO2 and C3H8 on the catalyst. Moreover, the enhanced catalyst stability was associated to a 
21 
 
decreased amount of carbon deposited on the catalyst surface according to the reverse Bourdard 
reaction.  
Agafonov et al. [112] studied the effect of synthesis conditions (e.g. solution pH, support 
calcination, and Cr loading) on the activity of CrOx/SiO2 catalysts for ODPC reaction. It was 
shown that changes in preparation procedure dramatically affects the activity and stability of the 
catalysts in the ODPC reaction. The catalytic test was carried out at 1 atm, 600 oC, and a space 
velocity of 200 h-1 using a feed composition of C3H8:CO2:N2 = 15:30:55, vol%. As Fig. 12a 
demonstrates, the propylene yield varied with the chromium solution pH, exhibiting enhanced 
catalytic activity and stability up to pH of 5 while beyond this value, the precipitation of 
chromium hydroxide took place. Generally, the acidity increases the number of sites responsible 
for adsorption and polymerization of olefins. CrOx/SiO2 catalysts are well-established 
polymerization catalysts and increasing acidity favors the formation of CrO particles on the 
support surface. CrO easily reduces to low oxidation states during dehydrogenation. Moreover, 
the authors prepared different series of catalysts (A, B, C) and showed that calcination of the 
support makes it possible to attain a more uniform distribution of active phases on the surface, 
hence a higher propylene yield, as illustrated in Fig. 12b. It was also shown that the catalytic 
activity of Cr increased with increased Cr loading, reaching a maximum at 5 wt%. Above 5 wt% 
loading, significant decrease in activity of the catalysts was observed for ODPC reaction.  
 
In another investigation, Botavina and coworkers [39] reported encouraging results at 5 wt% 
loading of Cr on SiO2, but the catalyst deactivated quickly due to agglomeration of chromium 
species. In a later study [27], the same authors used direct hydrothermal synthesis to improve the 
dispersion of chromium species on the support for ODP reaction in CO2 or CO2 + O2 
22 
 
environment under conditions close to industrial conditions. The initial C3H8 conversion in ODP 
with CO2 as the oxidant increased from ca. 40% for 0.25-Cr/SiO2 to a maximum ca. 70% at 2.0 
wt% Cr/SiO2 and remained at 50% after 6 h for 2.0 wt% Cr/SiO2. Thermodynamic calculations 
indicated that the equilibrium conversion of ODPC reaction (eq.3) at 873 K is 67%. As a result 
of the different mechanisms and other possible simultaneous beneficial effects, the initial C3H8 
conversion values obtained for the ODP in the presence of CO2, O2, or CO2 + O2 were 70, 75, 
and 80%, respectively, which decreased to 50, 65, and 70% after 900 min of reaction. When the 
catalyst was tested under non-oxidative conditions, the initial conversion was low at 60% and 
dropped to 40% within 6 h TOS. In addition, propane yield of 47% was attained over 2.0 wt% 
Cr/SiO2 when CO2 was used as the oxidant and remained up to 40% after 1000 min (among the 
highest reported so far). For ODP with O2 + CO2 as oxidant, C2H4 was found to be the main 
product after 300 min TOS due to enhanced cracking of propane in the presence of O2, which 
was also responsible for the production of a larger excess of CH4. The authors therefore 
suggested investigating the possibility of tuning the O2/CO2 ratio in order to obtain a desired 
composition of the olefin mixture for applications in C2H4/C3H6 copolymerization processes 
[27,112]. 
In summary, catalytic performance of chromium-based catalysts is drastically affected by the 
synthesis method, nature of the support, structure of the catalyst, nature of promoter-support 
interaction, active sites present in the catalyst, and the reaction conditions. To this effect, 
different authors have reported different chromium catalytic systems for ODPC reaction. 
Although chromium-based catalysts have exhibited promising results, however, due to potential 
environmental and health risks associated with the use of chromium, alternative catalysts should 
be designed and developed to enable a more sustainable process technology.

4.2.2. Vanadium-based oxide catalysts 
Vanadium-based materials are one of the most active, selective, and well investigated 
catalysts for the ODH of light alkanes [8,31,101,118,119]. Supported vanadium oxide catalysts 
have typically been found to be more selective than the unsupported bulk V2O5 mainly because 
of the interactions of VOx species with the oxide supports (e.g. Al2O3, Nb2O5, TiO2, ZrO2, SiO2, 
etc.) [116,119,120]. It has been reported that the interaction between the oxide support and the 
deposited vanadium oxide determines the structure of the resulting surface VOx species 
[6,109,114]. Dehydrated surface VOx species have been found to possess VO4 coordination with 
one terminal V= O bond and varying degrees of polymerization on different supports [105,110]. 
At high-surface vanadium oxide coverage, crystalline V2O5 nanoparticles also exist. This bulky 
vanadium pentoxide demonstrates a relatively low catalytic performance for selective alkane 
oxidation [8,102,111,121]. The catalytic activity of vanadium in ODP and the propylene 
selectivity are considered to be a function of the ratio of different vanadium oxide species, 
loading, calcination temperature, additives, and the specific support used. The factors that govern 
the catalytic performance of the surface VOx species, however, are still being debated 
[6,30,121]. 
The reaction of both supported and unsupported vanadium catalysts follow the Mars-Van 
Krevelen redox mechanism involving lattice oxygen in C–H bond activation and that each 
reaction turnover requires a two-electron reduction of high-valent M+n cations to form one Mn-2 
or two Mn-1 cations [8,38,119]. This is the kinetically relevant step for both ODP and combustion 
reactions involving the activation of methylene C–H bonds in propane [8,36,38]. The alkyl 
24 
 
species produced desorb as propylene and the remaining hydroxyl (OH) groups recombine with 
neighboring groups to form water molecules and reduced vanadium centers [8]. The addition of 
CO2 could promote desorption of the water formed. The reduced vanadium centers can be re-
oxidized by dissociative chemisorption of O2 [38]. On VOx- and MoOx-based catalysts, the rate 
constants for re-oxidation of reduced centers using O2 are greater than that for their re-reduction 
by C-H bond activation steps [36]. Some researchers have proposed that ODP rates increase as 
active metal oxides become more reducible [15,36,119,122]. The main reactive intermediates 
during ODP reaction over VOx domains are surface oxygen, O–H groups, and oxygen vacancies 
[39]. Iglesia et al. [119] have explored the electron transfer processes required for C–H bond 
activation steps and the factors responsible for the redox processes involved in each propane 
turnover. In that work, ODP turnover rates were reported on active oxides (VOx, MoOx, NbOx, 
and WOx) that were dispersed as isolated or two-dimensional species on the surface of inactive 
Al2O3, ZrO2, or MgO supports. Their findings showed that both turnover rates and H2-reduction 
rates increase with increasing MOx (where M = metal) surface density, as indicated in Fig. 12.  
 
Du et al. [123] also explained that the methylene C–H bonds in a propane molecule are 
weaker than the methyl bonds. These weaker bonds first interact with lattice oxygen as a propane 
molecule adsorbs weakly on the oxide surface [119,123,124]. The adsorbed propane reacts with 
a vicinal lattice oxygen atom to form an isopropoxide species and an OH group [119,125].  
Zhang et al.[87] examined a series of V-Cr/SBA-15/Al2O3/FeCrAl metal monolithic catalysts 
with V content of 10 wt% and Cr contents from 0 to 12.5 wt% for ODPC reaction. The catalysts 
were tested in a fixed-bed reactor at 1 atm, 450-700 oC, C3H8/CO2 space velocity of GHSV = 
14400 ml/g.h, and VCO2/VC3H8 molar ratio of 3. Using XPS analysis, it was confirmed that the 
25 
 
oxidation states of V were +5 and +4. With the addition of Cr species, the relative content and 
total amount of V5+ species increased and reached a maximum at 10 wt% Cr content. By further 
increase in Cr content to 12.5%, the relative content of V5+ species dropped remarebly. This was 
attributed to the formation of more Cr3+ species that hamper the formation of dispersed 
tetrahedral V5+ species. Similarly, Cr3+ and Cr6+ species were present in the catalysts and the 
amount of Cr6+ increased to a maximum at 10 wt% Cr. The V-Cr/SBA-15/Al2O3/FeCrAl catalyst 
with 10 wt% V and 10 wt% Cr exhibited the best activity with a propane conversion of 49.9%, 
propylene selectivity of 86.5% and a yield of 42.5% at 650 oC. Above these loadings, the yield of 
propylene decreased and the selectivity to minor products such as methane and ethane increased. 
The tetrahedral vanadium (V5+) species were the main active species in the ODP reaction. The 
strong interaction between vanadium oxide and chromium oxide was believed to be accounted 
for changing the redox properties and enhancing the catalytic activity of the catalysts [162].  
Moreover, hydrogenolysis reactions (eqs. 8-9) are typically promoted by low coordination 
site defects such as Steps and Kinks [126,127]. These side reactions can be hindered by using 
nano-size materials in the case of Pt-based catalysts. Jibril and his colleagues [126] employed the 
synergistic effect of promoter, support, and additives, and the influence of nano-size catalysts to 
test VMgO-based nanowires (Mg0.15V2O5 2.4H2O) mechanically mixed with either Al2O3 or 
SiO2 for the ODP reaction. The catalyst was prepared by the aqueous method and tested at 500, 
550 and 600 oC with gas flow of 70 cm3/min (C3H8:Ar ratio of 2:5) at 1 atm. The active species 
were V2O5 and MgV2O6, resulting from decomposition of layered nanowires of Mg0.15V2O5 
2.4H2O at high temperature. Their results indicated that both supports enhance the conversion 
and selectivity to propylene, however, Al2O3 support performed much better with higher 
conversion and selectivity compared to SiO2. The better performance of Al2O3 support is 
26 
 
explained to be caused by a higher rate of propylene desorption, whereas on the SiO2 surface, 
there is high electrophilic attack on propylene, thereby reducing its selectivity.  
Typically, selectivity is enhanced by the presence of sites that remove hydrogen. Further 
removal of hydrogen leads to olefins or cracking products. After hydrogen is produced, the rate 
of desorption is important. Otherwise, it combines with alkenes and/or alkyl species to produce 
alkanes [126,128]. Cracking reaction results in lower alkanes, hydrogen, and carbon deposits 
[126,128,129]. 
In continuation of the search for higher performing vanadium catalysts, Kootenaei et al. 
[121] investigated vanadia loading and calcination temperature effects on morphology and 
catalytic performance of vanadia supported on titanate nanostructures in ODPC reaction. The 
wet impregnation method was used to prepare 5 wt% V2O5 supported on TiO2 and VTNT-x (x 
wt% V2O5 supported on titanate nanotube) and tested in a fixed-bed reactor at 500 oC and 1 atm 
using equal flows of air and propane with total flow rate of 100 mLmin-1. The BET surface area 
of TiO2 support was higher in the case of nanotubes. The molecular structures of supported 
vanadia catalysts under dehydrated conditions transformed from monodispersed vanadia species 
to polyvanadate species as vanadia loading increased. Higher loadings above monolayer 
coverage of support led to a tendency to develop a crystalline phase [121,130]. It has been 
reported that complete coverage of the support surface with vanadium oxide is established with 
4.98 × 1014 molecules of V2O5 cm−2 [121]. Besides propylene, H2O, CO, and CO2 were recorded 
as products with CH4 and C2H6 appearing at high temperatures. Relatively higher conversions 
and TOF values were obtained for titanium nanotubes compared to titanium oxide with similar 
loadings. The lower performance of the oxide is due to the rutile phase titanium oxide, while 
anatase polymorph of titanium accounted for higher conversions in the nanotubes. Titanium 
27 
 
oxide normally exists as rutile and anatase polymorphs. However, the anatase is usually unstable 
and easily converts to the stable rutile phase with an accompanied loss in surface area [121,131]. 
This irreversible phase transition is the major cause of deactivation in titanium-based catalysts. 
This transformation is influenced by particle size, rutile content, surface area, calcination 
temperature and time, atmosphere, additives and impurities, and redox cycle [121,132].  
In summary, the performance of the active components in a vanadium-based catalyst has 
been shown to depend primarily on the type of support/template and promoter that affect catalyst 
redox and surface acidic properties. Due to susceptibility of the electron-rich centers to ODPC 
reaction, acidic sites promote cracking of olefins products or propyl species and formation of 
coke. Moreover, the nano-size particles tend to exhibit higher catalytic activity and selectivity 
than the bulk catalyst, implying that propane molecules have a greater chance to interact with 
active sites that abstract hydrogen. Thus, the design strategy should take into consideration all 
these factors simultaneously for improving the performance of vanadium catalysts. The future 
prospects of vanadium-based catalysts is bright, and there is a potential in ODPC industry to 
market the utilization of CO2 as a soft oxidant over this class of materials. 
 
4.2.3. Gallium and indium-based oxide catalysts  
Gallium-based catalysts became a subject of investigation after Nakagawa reported 
exceptional activity of commercial Ga2O3 catalysts for ethane dehydrogenation to ethylene in the 
presence of CO2  [31,133]. Studies have shown that Ga2O3 can be active and stable in the ODH 
of light alkanes, and outperform Cr2O3 and V2O5 catalysts [31,133]. It has been proven that the 
activity of gallium-based catalysts is dictated by the coordination state and reducibility of 
gallium species, nature of the support, acid-base properties, and gallium content [84,133–135]. 
28 
 
Typically, activities correlate positively with medium–strong acidity (BrØnsted acidity). 
However, in the case of GaxAl10-xO15 oxides, activities correspond with weak (Lewis) acidity 
[64,133]. Since tetrahedrally coordinated Ga3+ species are responsible for Lewis acidity, they are 
assumed as central components for the ODP reaction [133]. Sattler et al. [84] made similar 
analyses in which unsaturated Ga3+ species were deemed  responsible for C–H bond activation. 
In their study, Pt was used as an additive to kindle the distribution and tetrahedral coordination 
of Ga3+ species on the surface of the catalyst and help in the recombination of hydrogen adsorbed 
on the catalyst. Encouraging results have been achieved with Ga2O3 dispersed on inert supports 
such as TiO2 and Al2O3 for ODP reaction at 500 oC [136][133]. Many different forms of gallium-
based catalysts such as spinel-like gallium solid solutions [133], ternary mixtures of Ga/In/Al 
[136], and polymorphs of gallium[134] have been investigated for ODP reaction. Chen et al. 
[133] synthesized a series of mixed GaxAl10-xO15 oxide (with x varying from 0 to 10) catalysts 
using the alcoholic co-precipitation method for propane dehydrogenation under different 
environments (CO2 and without CO2). Within this series of catalysts, the maximum activity was 
reported for x = 8 while the highest stability was achieved for Ga2O3–Al2O3 with higher 
aluminum content. Moreover, linking the activities with the NH3-TPD profiles, it was disclosed 
that high population of surface acid sites is connected to tetrahedral Ga3+ cations (responsible for 
Lewis acidity). The fraction of Ga3+ ions found in tetrahedral sites increased inversely with 
Ga/Al ratio, signifying that the Ga3+ ions preferentially occupied the tetrahedral sites of the 
defect spinel structure of the γ-Ga2O3–Al2O3 solid solution [133].  
The thermodynamics of the propane dehydrogenation reaction designates that extent of 
reaction can be improved by coupling it with the RWGS reaction [37]. However, for some 
gallium-based catalysts, CO2 does not stimulate all the catalysts for propane dehydrogenation 
29 
 
due to the decrease in propane adsorption [32,133]. For instance, for Ga2Al8O15 catalyst, the 
conversion was shown to decrease quickly with time in the presence of CO2, whereas enhanced 
catalyst stability with relatively higher conversions with time were reported for γ-Ga2O3, 
Ga8Al2O15, and Ga5Al5O15. This boost to stability is suggested to be influenced by CO2. 
Meanwhile, for Ga2Al8O15, the poor catalytic performance was attributed to competitive 
adsorption between propane and CO2 [133]. Michorczyk and Ogonowski [32] further reported 
propane conversion of 92% at 873 K (50 K lower than without CO2) and CO2/C3H8 molar ratio 
of 5 when the reaction was performed over Ga2O3 catalysts. 
Chen’s group [133] observed that for simple γ-Ga2O3 catalyst, the activity in the presence of 
CO2 retards quickly from 33.7% to 2.1% within 16 h. On the other hand, Ga5Al5O15 activity 
retardation was much slower, losing only 2.4% (from 33.7 to 26.5%) in 16 h. Conversion as high 
as 22.5% after 50 h TOS was reported. Quick deactivation with time in both the presence and 
absence of CO2 was linked to catalyst coking [133]. Michorczyk et al. [64] clarified that the 
carbon deposition is associated with unsaturated hydrocarbons (olefins) and not saturated 
hydrocarbons (alkanes), and results from substrate–product reactivity. This explains the 
chemistry behind the higher coke deposition associated with higher conversion. By pulse 
reaction study, it was found that desorption of propylene from the catalyst surface was conducive 
on gallia–alumina mixed oxide catalyst surfaces and that accounted for the higher stability of 
those catalysts [84,133].  
Sattler et al. [137] synthesized a stable catalyst that was more resistant to deactivation by 
depositing 1000 ppm Pt, 1.5% or 3 wt% Ga, and 0.25 wt% K on an alumina support. The catalyst 
were tested in ODPC reaction for eight successive dehydrogenation–regeneration cycles with 15 
min dehydrogenation at 620 oC and 30 min regeneration at 750 oC in air. By combining Pt and 
30 
 
Ga, conversions of 42% (close to the equilibrium conversion of 55% at 620 oC and 1 atm) and 
selectivity of about 96% were achieved. It was also reported that adding additives of alkali 
metals like K enhances the selectivity and reduces coking by poisoning the acid sites. Catalyst 
stability of 14 days at 31.1% conversion and 92.6% selectivity was established. The synergy 
between Ga and Pt species overrode the usual sintering deactivation associated with Pt catalysts. 
Using Operando Raman spectra study, it was confirmed that Pt only hydrogenates the carbon 
deposits, thereby improving the life of the catalysts while Ga does the actual dehydrogenation 
reaction  [133]. 
In another investigation, Xu et al. [56] investigated the performance of a series of supported 
gallium oxide catalysts in ODPC reaction. As shown in Fig. 13, CO2 promoted the catalytic 
dehydrogenation activity of Ga2O3/TiO2 but suppressed those of Ga2O3/ZrO2 and Ga2O3/Al2O3. 
Propane conversions of 32, 26, and 30% were obtained over Ga2O3/TiO2, Ga2O3/Al2O3, and 
Ga2O3/ZrO2 catalysts, respectively. Through XPS analysis of the catalysts, the authors 
hypothesized that the different behavior of the five supported Ga2O3 catalysts may stem from the 
difference in interactions between the support and the Ga2O3 species. However, through H2 and 
propane pulse chemisorption tests, it was pointed out that two antagonistic roles of CO2 exist in 
the reaction; the constructive role which is achieved by removing dissociatively adsorbed H2 
from catalyst surface by the RWGS reaction, and the damaging role which is achieved by 
displacing adsorbed propane on basic sites of catalyst.  
  
Recently, Michorczyk et al. [64] carried out ODPC reaction over thermally stable 
mesoporous Ga2O3 and Ga2O3-Al2O3 oxides prepared by nanocasting method. Mesoporous 
Ga2O3 catalysts with large specific surface areas (231-322 m2g-1), uniform mesopores (3-14 nm), 
31 
 
and pore architecture similar to that of SBA-15 (hexagonal structure) were obtained with this 
synthesis approach. It was further confirmed that high surface gallium species associated with 
Lewis acidity were responsible for higher conversions while the amount of coke deposited 
increased with the gallium species intensity. Mesoporous Ga2O3 showed better selectivity (91-
95%) than Ga2O3-Al2O3 (85-92%) as a result of uniform mesopore structure and pore size 
distribution. The conversion of propane was almost low and constant (at 8%) for catalysts with 
Al2O3 support, implying that the support does not have much effect in conversions. It has been 
established that the selectivity to propylene in ODPC reaction over gallium is influenced by two 
factors; the acidity of the catalyst which is dependent on Ga2O3 phase composition or 
characteristics of support [56,84,134], and pore geometry of the catalysts [84]. Higher propylene 
selectivity was attained by α- and β-Ga2O3 than with δ- and γ-Ga2O3 phase catalysts [138].  
In the same investigation [64], it was reported that higher temperatures promotes 
hydrocracking, cracking and dehydrocyclization, leading to production of light alkanes (methane 
and ethane), toluene, and benzene. The usual reverse Boudouard reaction that would normally 
occur in the presence of CO2 did not take place at high reaction temperatures. Xu et al. [56] 
studied gallium supported on a series of metal oxide catalysts such as ZrO2, TiO2, SiO2, Al2O3, 
SiO2  and MgO for ODPC reaction. Their observations follow the heterolytic dissociative 
mechanism and the authors proposed the following steps (eqs. 10-15) in ODPC reaction over 
Ga2O3 catalyst.

It was found that the major pathway of the removal of the dissociatively adsorbed H2 depends 
on the relative rate of steps 12 and 15 [56]. Liu et al. [139] studied the mechanism of propane 
activation over Ga (100) using DFT calculations. From their study, it was found that initial 
activation of C–H bond can occur in two ways: heterolytic dissociation mechanism (eq. 16 and 
17), where the acid-base pairs (Ga–O) polarize and then break the C–H bond, and homolytic 
dissociation mechanism (eq. 18 and 19), where active site pairs consist of two O or Ga active 
sites and the C–H bond is polarized and activated by O or Ga sites. 
C3H8 + O-Ga → OH + C3H7Ga

The above reactions could also be explained in terms of propylene formation. One pathway is 
H abstraction from physically adsorbed propyl radical (eq. 16), and the other is H abstraction 
from propoxide (eq. 17 and 18) or propylgallium intermediates (eq. 19). For both pathways, 
propylene formation on O(2) sites has lower energy barrier. On the other hand, surface hydroxyl 
groups formed are stable since formation of either H2 or H2O from them is difficult. Also, 
propylene adsorbed on these hydroxyl groups is difficult to desorb and prone to further 
dehydrogenation or oligomerization. As a consequence, catalytic activity decreases quickly when 
surface oxygen sites are covered by hydrogen and the surface is partially reduced. Furthermore, 
it was found that gallium sites are less active than oxygen sites, thus hydrogen abstraction would 
more often occur on oxygen sites. Nonetheless, when the surface oxygen sites are consumed, H 
abstraction from various propyl intermediates would occur on Ga sites to form propylene. Even 
though H abstraction by Ga has to overcome high energy barriers, the formation of H2 from GaH 
and O(2)H or O(3)H hydroxyl groups is much easier than the formation of H2 or H2O from GaH 
or hydroxyl groups, implying a change in rate-determining step from H abstraction by oxygen 
sites at the initial stage of reaction to H abstraction by Ga sites to form GaH species 
[32,124,135]. Thus, applying oxidants like CO2 and steam would remove the surface covering 
hydrogen and coke deposit, and suppress the equilibrium to form gaseous H2O [139]. Contrary to 
34 
 
the finding from theoretical DFT calculations, by using the MAS NMR study of propane 
interaction with Ga2O3 supported on zeolite, Gabrienko et al. [140] showed that the interaction of 
small alkanes with Ga2O3 or Ga-modified zeolite results in dissociative adsorption of alkane 
forming Ga-alkyl intermediate species rather than the alkoxy species. 
 
Besides Cr-, V- and Ga-based materials, In2O3-basded catalysts have also demonstrated 
auspicious catalytic performance in ODP reaction [14,141]. Like gallium-based analogues, 
dehydrogenation reaction over indium-based catalysts in the presence of CO2 follow a two-step 
process; the non-oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (eq. 1) followed by the RWGS reaction 
(eq. 2) [14,141]. However, unlike gallium-based catalysts which have been shown to have poor 
redox properties [133,137], indium-based materials exhibit good redox characteristics with 
highly dispersed and bulk In2O3 reducing from In3+ to In0 [14,142]. Nevertheless, the reduced In0 
(active centers for dehydrogenation) species cannot be re-oxidized by CO2 [14]. Indium reduced 
at low temperatures is associated with α-phase, whereas high temperature reduction is associated 
with β-phase [142]. The amount of dispersed In2O3 species was found to be dependent on the 
type of support in the order of In/Al > In/Zr >> In/Si. The period of indium reduction (lasting 3 
h), normally called the induction period, is accompanied by low conversions and selectivies, 
after which improved conversion and selectivities are obtained  [141], suggesting the reduced 
metallic In0 are the active species, unlike gallium-based catalysts in which Ga3+ are the active 
species. The reduced indium species are thought to have come from highly dispersed In2O3, thus 
designing a catalyst that can effectively disperse indium promoter may be a key factor in 
achieving higher performance. For high indium loadings on SiO2 support, the induction period 
does not take place. This was suggested to be due to overpopulation of In2O3, probably resulting 
from less interaction of In2O3 with the silica support [14].  
35 
 
Chen et al. [141] demonstrated that a bifunctional In2O3–Al2O3 catalyst is more stable and 
active, with indium species and In2O3 playing a major role in In2O3–Al2O3 system’s activity for 
CO2-incorporated reactions (Fig. 14). In that study, a series of catalysts were prepared with 
different indium promoter loadings on Al2O3, ZrO2, and SiO2 supports using the wet 
impregnation method, and the acid-base properties of the supports and their interactions with 
In2O3 were examined for ODPC reaction. On the issue of acidity, indium indicated a divergent 
effect on acidity, whereas the support paralleled the degree of acidity in the order of ZrO2 > 
Al2O3 > SiO2 [14]. On the contrary, both promoter and support showed positive synergy in 
basicity of the catalysts. 
Catalytic activities positively correlate with the amount of In0 species and the acidity on the 
surface of the catalysts. The yield of propane were in the order of In/Zr > In/Al > In/Si, testifying 
to the importance of the support acidity effect. Without CO2 however, the catalytic activity 
varied, with In2O3-Al2O3 displaying the best performance. This change in catalytic activity could 
imply that the support has an effect on the RWGS reaction, which is important for breaking the 
thermodynamic equilibrium barrier. Generally, acidic gases would adsorb onto basic sites, thus 
the high basicity of In2O3-ZrO2 catalysts could account for their superior performance in the 
presence of CO2.  
Despite the fact that acidity is necessary for better catalytic performance, it is also known that 
acidity higher than optimum promotes side reactions and quick deactivation, leading to low 
selectivity to the desired product. Thus, to achieve selectively high conversion of propane for the 
supported In2O3 samples, well dispersion of In2O3 and balanced acid-base properties are crucial 
rudiments. Furthermore, it has been suggested that the acid-base properties and the abundance of 
surface dispersed indium species are responsible for propane dehydrogenation. The dispersion of 
36 
 
the active species and electronic properties of dispersed active species are influenced by the type 
of support. These together with the acid-base properties of the support affect the selectivity to 
propylene. Therefore, indium will be one of the suitable elements to use as dopant for 
engineering the catalysts properties. The ODP reaction parameters for metal oxide catalysts in 
the presence and absence of CO2 are given in Table 4 and Table 5, respectively. 
In summary, the conversion of propane to propylene in the presence of CO2 involves 
simultaneous occurrence of both non-oxidative dehydrogenation and oxidative dehydrogenation 
pathways, depending on whether the metal is reduced or not and/or the nature of the active sites. 
In the presence of redox metal oxide catalysts (e.g. Cr, V, Fe, Mo etc.), the reaction is mostly 
through one-step oxidative route with CO2 re-oxidizing the reduced metals (eq. 3) in 
concomitance with the Mars–Van Krevelen mechanism. Some of these redox catalysts were 
discussed above.  However, in the case of non-redox catalysts (e.g. Ga, In), the reaction proceeds 
via two-step non-oxidative route. The first reaction is non-oxidative dehydrogenation (eq. 1) and 
the second is CO2 participation in RWGS reaction (eq. 2) by removing the produced H2 and 
shifting the equilibrium position towards higher conversions of propane. For catalysts that cannot 
be reduced at dehydrogenation temperatures, the redox mechanism is not applicable and propane 
is heterolytically dissociatively adsorbed on metal oxide, forming metal hydride and metal 
alkoxy species. Therefore, in the development of metal-oxide materials with advanced catalytic 
performance for ODPC reaction, it is necessary to adjust their redox properties by judicious 
selection of promoters, supports, and additives. High thermally stable support with large surface 
area allows uniform distribution of reducible and active species on the surface, which further 
prevents aggregation and sintering of the catalyst particles and enhances the stability of the 
catalyst.     
37 
 
5. Effect of process conditions on ODPC reaction 
Another important area of interest in every chemical process is the conditions under which 
the reaction occurs. A significant portion of expenditure in almost all chemical industries goes 
into the energy required for the process, which is normally tied to the temperatures and pressures 
under which the process occurs. This is not different from oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. 
It is in fact one of the barriers needed to differentiate it from non-oxidative dehydrogenation 
reactions of propane to propylene. In general, the rates of C–H and C–C cleavage will be 
enhanced by increasing the reaction temperature, therefore both temperature and pressure should 
be controlled to achieve high olefin yields. 
It should be noted that process conditions are not limited to just temperature and pressure, 
other parameters such as feed composition, feed flow rate and reactor configuration are of equal 
importance. For example, micoporous membrane reactors coated with V-Mg-O and Ni 
nanoparticles have been shown to improve the propene yield at low C3H8/O2 ratio under separate 
feeding configuration, in comparison to conventional fixed-bed reactors [144]. Moreover, the 
effect of CO2 partial pressure on the conversion of propane is widely examined by various 
researchers. The general trend is that the increase in the partial pressure of CO2 increases the 
conversion of propane and the formation of CO and H2O, whereas reduces the formation of H2 
[26,51,56,58,145,146]. In ODPC reaction, about 50% of the H2 formed is converted by the CO2 
[58]. Fig. 15 represents data reported for the effect of CO2 partial pressure on the conversion of 
propane over Cr/MCM-41 catalysts prepared by direct hydrothermal method [36]. As can be 
seen, the rate of C3H6 and CO formation increased with increasing the partial pressure of CO2, 
while the rate of H2 formation showed no signiﬁcant change. The selectivity toward C3H6 was 
always around 95% and small amounts of C2H6, C2H4, and CH4 were formed as well. This 
38 
 
further confirms the essential role of CO2 partial pressure in the propane dehydrogenation 
process. 
 
The effect of CO2 partial pressure on the activity of Cr/SiO2 and Cr/Al2O3 was further 
investigated by Shishido et al. [36]. The activity of Cr/SiO2 was enhanced with increasing the 
partial pressure of CO2, while the activity of Cr/Al2O3 was remarkably reduced by adding a small 
amount of CO2. Kinetic analyses suggested that CO2 adsorbed on Al2O3 inhibites the adsorption 
of C3H8, thereby reducing the activity of Cr/Al2O3. Similar observation and explanation were 
offered by Michorczyk’s group [37] for investigated Cr/SiO2 and Cr/Al2O3 catalysts. More coke 
deposits were observed in the CO2 environment than that in the N2, highlighting that coke 
suppression was not the main role of CO2. Nonetheless, CO formed from CO2 during the 
dehydrogenation of C3H8 over Cr/SiO2 and Cr/Al2O3. This could have resulted from the RWGS 
or reverse Boudouard reactions, but since more coke accompanied CO2 addition, it may not be 
wrong to exclude the reverse Boudouard reactions in this case. The authors further investigated 
the possibility of optimizing CO and H2 produced from ODPC reaction based on catalysis and 
thermodynamics analyses. A reaction mixture of propane at 14.5 kPa partial pressure and a 
varying amount of CO2 with N2 at flow rate of 30 cm3min-1 with varying reaction temperature 
were selected as the reaction conditions. Their results indicated that the equilibrium yield of 
propylene is much higher in the presence of CO2 than in its absence, and similar yield as the 
commercialized dehydrogenation processes can be obtained at lower temperatures. 
Thermodynamic considerations pointed out that temperature has a much smaller effect on the 
equilibrium molar ratio of CO/H2 compared to the initial feed composition of C3H8 and CO2 with 
the higher ratio obtained at CO2/C3H8 > 1. Over the investigated catalysts, propane conversion 
and propylene yield increased with increasing reaction temperature, while the selectivity to 
39 
 
propylene dropped. Conversion was found to be significantly lower at temperatures below 823 
K, whereas side reactions dominated above 873 K, leading to quick catalyst deactivation. The 
differences in results were accounted for by the interaction of CO2 molecules with the catalysts.  
The investigation of the influence of CO2 partial pressure on the dehydrogenation reaction 
has suggested two roles of CO2: a positive role of transforming H2 into CO and H2O through the 
RWGS reaction, and a negative role by blocking the dissociative adsorption of propane on the 
catalyst surface. The catalytic stability is also expected to improve by the addition of CO2 to the 
feed gas due to the suppression of coke formation through the Bourdard reaction [86]. Aside 
from the transformation of H2 and removal of coke, Ren et al. [86] reported that CO2 promotes 
desorption of propylene. In another study [88], it was found that increase in molar ratio of 
CO2/C3H8 results in the enhancement of the yield and selectivity to propylene and molar ratio of 
H2/CO. The authors attributed this positive effect to direct oxidation of propane to propylene (eq. 
3) in addition to the hydrogen consumption by the RWGS reaction (eq. 2), which shifts the 
propane dehydrogenation equilibrium. In effect, the use of CO2 generates useful syngas whose 
amount can be controlled by regulating the feed gas composition. 
Fig. 16 shows the performance of 0.04 wt% Cr/SBA-1 catalyst as a function of temperature 
in the presence of CO2 [88]. Raising temperature from 550 to 650 °C increased the conversion of 
both propane and CO2, and yield of propylene. However, the values decreased with time at each 
temperature. Except for activity loss, the rest of these parameters decreased when the catalyst 
was tested at 550 oC in the absence of CO2 as indicated by the step in each line. The loss in 
activity with increase in temperature is attributed to coking (reversible deactivation) and loss of 
textural parameters (irreversible) of the Cr-catalyst. In addition, lattice oxygen consumption 
40 
 
during ODPC reaction contributes to the deactivation of the catalyst. Coking often easily comes 
from propylene than propane, which could be the reason for the loss in selectivity [36].  
Baek et al. [89] reported similar observations on temperature dependency of catalyst activity 
in ODPC reaction. The activity of catalysts increased with temperature, but selectivity dropped 
remarkably at 700 oC. Although higher temperature favors propylene formation, it also promotes 
catalyst sintering, agglomeration, and carbon deposition on active sites, thereby resulting in 
catalyst deactivation. High activity and acceptable selectivity were achieved at 600 °C, which 
was the most suitable reaction temperature for the reaction. The performance of dehydrogenation 
catalysts deteriorates with reaction time, so it is necessary to regenerate the catalysts frequently 
to retain sufficient activity. Therefore, optimum distribution and interaction of metal oxide 
particles with support as well as support with relatively large surface area and pore size are 
required to prevent sintering and aggregation after harsh hydrothermal conditions that the 
materials are exposed during regeneration process. 
 
In summary, the effect of CO2 partial pressure in promoting dehydrogenation of propane 
varies with catalyst type and nature of metal used. For easily oxidized metals such as Cr and V, 
CO2 basically re-oxidizes the reduced active species in the reaction process, whereas for metal 
species like Ga and In that are difficult to reduce even under oxidative conditions, the normal 
non-oxidative dehydrogenation occurs and CO2 basically consumes the H2 produced and hence 
induces positive equilibrium effect [35,36,62,64,83,129]. The role of CO2 in ODP reaction 
including consumption of H2, removal of coke, and desorption of propylene, has been consistent 
in the works published by many other researchers using different catalysts [35,36,84]. With 
respect to temperature, alkane dehydrogenation reactions are very complicated because they are 
41 
 
thermodynamically limited at low temperatures and high pressures. At high temperatures where 
thermodynamics favor conversions, side reactions become dominant and selectivity to desired 
products decreases significantly. To enable an energy-efficient ODPC process with high 
efficiency, it is imperative to consider process conditions in addition to catalysts properties. In 
other words, a design platform should be established through which the design and creation of 
catalyst materials are informed by the process parameters and vise versa.  
5. Summary and outlook 
In this critical review, the current challenges and future opportunities of CO2 utilization as a 
soft oxidant foe selective dehydrogenation of propane was presented and discussed. Oxidative 
dehydrogenation of light alkanes with CO2 is a vibrant field that so far has not yielded 
commercially viable catalytic technology. Several types of catalysts (zeolites, zeolite-supported 
metal oxides, and mixed-metal oxides) have been extensively explored for ODPC reaction with 
some promising results that could bring the process one step closer to the commercialization. 
However, the role of CO2 and the mechanism of the dehydrogenation reaction are not clearly 
documented over these heterogeneous catalysts and are much dependent on the nature of the 
catalyst and support material used. The coupling effect of dehydrogenation with the RWGS 
reaction has advanced the performance of some catalysts, while adversely affected the 
performance of others. Such opposing roles are not clearly explained in the reported literature. 
Catalyst deactivation by catalyst sintering and coke deposition represents additional challenges, 
as catalyst aggregation and coke deposition increase at higher reaction temperature and lower H2 
partial pressure, respectively. Redox catalyst deactivation is also caused by reduction of metal 
oxides, in which case CO2 becomes a viable means of reactivating those catalysts. Other means 
42 
 
include phase transformation of active phases to more stable ones and surface coverage by 
adsorbed hydrogen. 
By reviewing the literature data, it appears that zeolite-supported metal oxide catalysts 
(bifunctional materials) will offer promising performance in the ODPC reaction through 
cooperative interaction between acid sites on zeolite and active metal centers which leads to 
improved stability and selectivity. Even though some work has been done on zeolite-supported 
reducible transition metals, more work is still needed to promote this cooperative interaction. 
Despite significant progress within the past few years, the ODPC process still has a long way 
to go to become a commercially available technology. It appears that a bridge between catalyst 
chemists and engineers is crucial to fill the gap between characteristics of the catalysts and 
process performance. Future targets of research should focus on the advantageous properties of 
composite materials and breakthrough processes. Understanding the thermodynamics and 
kinetics of the ODPC reaction as well as RWGS pathways is necessary to enable the design of 
new catalysts with advanced catalytic properties. Progress is anticipated in the research areas of 
(i) bifunctional acid-base or acid-redox catalysis, and (ii) membrane reactors. Since the ODPC is 
an equilibrium-limited reaction, such thermodynamic constraint can be partially alleviated by 
employing membrane reactors by which the catalyst is introduced to a membrane system with 
high thermal stability to remove molecules with smaller kinetic diameter from the reaction 
mixture and hence shifts the equilibrium for production of pure propylene. Currently, such 
systems have been comparatively less explored. Furthermore, a combination of in-situ 
characterization techniques and theoretical studies (e.g. DFT and kinetics energy) is necessary to 
identify and evaluate key reaction intermediates.
