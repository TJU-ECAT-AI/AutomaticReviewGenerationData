a b s t r a c t
The structure and population of ion-exchanged Fe ions, Fe-oxo species, and Fe-oxo oligomers and Fe2O3
oxide particles and the concentration of acid sites in non-steamed and steamed Fe-ZSM-5 were
elucidated using semi-quantitative Mössbauer and FTIR analysis supplemented by UV–Vis and H2-TPR.
Differences in the concentration of the individual Fe species and acid sites were related to the activity
and time-on-stream behavior of Fe-zeolites in decomposition of N2O and oxidative dehydrogenation of
propane to propene with N2O. The evacuated non-steamed FeH-ZSM-5 contained high concentration
of Brønsted sites and predominantly bare Fe(II) ions (72%), and less mono- and dinuclear Fe(III)
(16–19%) and oligomeric Fe(III)-oxo species (9–12%). The steamed Fe(H)-ZSM-5st zeolites were greatly
reorganized, resulting in a low concentration of both the Brønsted sites and bare Fe(II) ions, and the
Td-coordinated Fe(III) ions in the FeAAlASi extra-framework species (43–47%) and Fe-oxide-like particles
(30–33%) prevailed. The redox state of Fe in both non-steamed and steamed Fe-ZSM-5 was strongly inﬂu-
enced by the reaction conditions of N2O decomposition and C3H8/N2O. Bare counter Fe ions balanced by
AlASiASiAAl sequences in 6MRs of the framework undergo reversible redox Fe(III)O/Fe(II) cycle during
N2O/evacuation treatments and represent the most active site in the decomposition of N2O to molecular
components. In contrast, both mono-, dinuclear Fe(III)-oxo and Fe(III)-oxo oligomers are reduced by
propane to Fe(II) at conditions of the C3H8/N2O reaction. The reduced Fe(II) species with N2O form
Fe(III)AO and facilitate transfer of atomic oxygen to propane with formation of propanol dehydrated
to propene. Thus, all dispersed Fe species represent highly active sites in oxidative dehydrogenation of
propane to propene with N2O. The presence of high concentration of Brønsted sites and large crystal size
of FeH-ZSM-5 stimulated oligomerization of formed propene decreasing its yield and increasing retention
of polyoleﬁns up to polyaromatic coke. Thus, high concentration of counter Fe(III)-oxo species easily
reducible to Fe(II) is critical for high activity in N2O decomposition, whereas high yield of propene in
C3H8/N2O is achieved regardless of population of the individual dispersed Fe species. The low concentra-
tion of protonic sites and small crystallites of zeolites, not supporting propene oligomerization, accumu-
lation of polyoleﬁns in the pores and their easy oxidation to CO/CO2, are necessary conditions for selective
oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propene over Fe-ZSM-5.

1. Introduction
The interaction between N2O and Fe(II) ions stabilized in the
extra-framework sites of high-silica zeolites results in N2O dissoci-
ation and formation of the so-called a-oxygen bound to Fe ions and
gaseous nitrogen. These a-oxygen atoms either recombine or inter-
act with an additional N2O molecule with formation of molecular
oxygen [1] or can be used for highly selective oxidations of hydro-
carbons, such as benzene to phenol [2–7], methane to methanol
[8,9], and propane to propene via propanol [10–14] according to
the following pathways:
FeðIIÞ þ N2O ! FeðIIIÞAO þ N2
ð1Þ
FeðIIIÞAO þ FeðIIIÞAO ! 2FeðIIÞ þ O2
ð2Þ
FeðIIIÞAO þ N2O ! FeðIIÞ þ N2 þ O2

or
FeðIIIÞAO þ C3H8 ! FeðIIÞ þ C3H7OH ! FeðIIÞ þ C3H6 þ H2O
ð4Þ
The high reactivity of this atomic oxygen bound to Fe(III) ions sug-
gests the radical-type character of the Fe(III)AO species, although
there is so far no direct experimental evidence for it. In addition to
investigation into the reactivity of a-oxygen itself [7,15–18], there
is continuous interest in analysis of the structures of Fe sites,
particularly in ZSM-5 and ferrierite, responsible for the activity in

selective oxidation of hydrocarbons as well as N2O decomposition
to molecular components. Accordingly, two competitive processes,
N2O decomposition to molecular products, employed for N2O abate-
ment at end-of-pipe gases of nitric acid plants and selective oxida-
tion of hydrocarbons of low reactivity exploiting the high reactivity
of oxygen bound on Fe sites, are at the center of attention.
Dinuclear l-oxo Fe complexes in ZSM-5, formed by high-tem-
perature calcination or steaming of the originally isomorphously
substituted [Fe]ZSM-5 with Fe ions removed from the framework
or introduced by ion exchange, were suggested to be the active sites
in the hydroxylation of benzene [1,19–26]. This suggestion was
based mainly on the Mössbauer spectra of the iron-exchanged
Fe-ZSM-5 and steamed isomorphously substituted [Fe]ZSM-5
zeolites yielding similar Mössbauer parameters to those of the
dinuclear Fe-oxo complexes of methane monooxygenase [1,27].
EXAFS experiments also indicated the presence of dinuclear Fe
complexes mostly in the highly loaded Fe-zeolites with Fe/Al com-
position 1 [20,26–30]. Later, it was shown that both the Fe ions of
the dinuclear complex and single Fe(II) ions in cationic sites of ZSM-
5 and ferrierite bind one a-oxygen, thus forming an Fe(III)AO
entity [1]. On the other hand, structurally undeﬁned (but related
to the Al presence) FeASiAAlAO species [31] formed in the pores
of steamed [FeAl]ZSM-5 were also suggested as the highly active
centers for oxidation of benzene to phenol. Although the steaming
of both the isomorphously substituted H-[Fe]ZSM-5 and the ion-
exchanged FeH-ZSM-5 appeared to be accompanied by substantial
changes in the structure of the Fe species and to be beneﬁcial for
yields of phenol and also resulted in a lower rate of catalyst deacti-
vation [2,3], the elucidation of the structure of the active Fe sites in
the steamed FeH-zeolites is still far from being resolved.
Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propene by nitrous
oxide over the ion-exchanged FeH-ZSM-5 with interesting yields
of propene has also been reported [11,19,32]. The importance of
the Fe ions balanced by the negative framework charge was
pointed out [33], but no conclusion was drawn on the structure
of the active Fe sites, except for the statement that the highest
TOF values are reached at the lowest (even trace) concentrations
of Fe. On the other hand, with N2O decomposition, in addition to
the dinuclear Fe-oxo complexes, the exchanged single Fe(II) ions
were clearly shown to be the active sites [34,35]. Different dis-
tances of the Fe(II) ions at deﬁned cationic sites for low concentra-
tions of Fe in MFI, FER, and BEA zeolite structures have been
indicated to control the rate of decomposition of nitrous oxide to
molecular products [34]. Very speciﬁc complex structure in the
low-loaded Fe-FER including two Fe ions facing each other in the
opposite b-type cationic sites was proposed for N2O decomposition
[36]. As this thus-deﬁne distance could not be realized in ZSM-5
structure due to different arrangement of the b-type six-member
rings (6MRs) coordinated Fe(II) ions, the N2O decomposition activ-
ity of Fe-ZSM-5 compared to Fe-FER is lower [34]. These sugges-
tions
were
supported
by
the
results
of
DFT
calculations
describing the individual steps of N2O interaction with two Fe(II)
ions located in cationic sites. The recombination of oxygen atoms
or their reaction with additional N2O was suggested as the rate-
determining step [7,37].
The structural chemistry of iron in high-silica zeolites is very
complex. Single, di,- and trivalent Fe ions, mono- and dinuclear
oxo- and hydroxo-complexes, oligomeric oxo species and iron
oxide particles coexist in various proportions depending on the
Fe loading, methods of Fe introduction and also the zeolite struc-
ture [25,34,38–41]. Fe-zeolites with highly predominant single Fe
ions in cationic sites were prepared only at low loadings, while
higher loadings immediately exhibit a variety of Fe species [42].
XANES and EXAFS studies of the highly loaded Fe-ZSM-5 prepared
by sublimation of FeCl3 clearly evidenced presence of dinuclear Fe-
oxo complexes [29,30,43]. All types of Fe species can be found in a
diverse set of oxidation states and stereochemical conformations
(tetrahedral, ﬁve-coordinated, trigonal bipyramid and six-coordi-
nated [44], and the formation of oxo-bridged and di-oxo-bridged
dimeric and oligomeric species up to bulk-like a-FeO(OH) and
a-Fe2O3 [45,46]). The most complex view of the state of Fe is pro-
vided by Mössbauer spectroscopy whose parameters distinguish
Fe(II) and Fe(III) ions and are sensitive to their coordination with
oxygen-containing ligands [35,47–54]. Nevertheless, necessity of
ﬁtting the Mössbauer parameters from the complex spectra of
the individual Fe(II)/Fe(III) species with different coordination
makes the analysis of Fe complexes in Fe-zeolites only semi-quan-
titative. Pirngruber et al. [26] analyzing the monomeric, dimeric,
and oligomeric Fe species in zeolites by UV–Vis, EXAFS, and mag-
netic susceptibility measurements, critically stressed the short-
comings of the individual methods. They concluded that the
magnetic measurements supplemented by UV–Vis might provide
semi-quantitative information on the nuclearity of the Fe sites,
and they were skeptical about the use of EXAFS for quantitative
analysis of mono- and dimeric Fe species.
The present work is focused on the structural analysis of two Fe
ion-exchanged FeH-ZSM-5 zeolites of different crystal size with
comparable low Fe concentrations (Fe/Al  0.15 at Si/Al  22)
and their steamed forms by following their auto-reduction and
interaction with molecular oxygen, N2O, and propane/N2O at the
reaction temperature. The analysis of Fe-zeolites with respect to
Fe species and acid sites is based on the 57Fe Mössbauer (Fe(II)/
Fe(III)) and FTIR spectroscopy of acid and Fe(II) sites, supported
by temperature-programmed reduction by hydrogen (TPR-H2)
and the UV–Vis spectra of the Fe(III) ions. The activity of Fe-zeolites
in competitive reactions of N2O decomposition to molecular prod-
ucts and oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propene with
N2O were related to the concentration of the Fe(II)/Fe(III) sites,
the protonic sites, and the crystal size.
2. Experimental
2.1. Structure of parent zeolites
Parent Na-ZSM-5 zeolites with Si/Al molar ratio of 21.9 and
21.6, and crystal size 0.15 and 2 lm were designated as Z1 and
Z2, respectively. The crystal size of the samples was estimated
from the SEM micrographs (JEOL JSM-5500LV scanning electron
microscope) given in Supplement I. The zeolite samples of different
crystal size were selected to follow the accumulation of polyoleﬁns
inside pores during propane oxidation. Zeolites crystallinity was
checked by XRD using a Bruker D8 (Bruker AXS, USA) diffractome-
ter, and N2 physisorption isotherms (77 K) were obtained by an
ASAP2020 Micromeritics apparatus. The XRD patterns of parent
zeolites were characteristic for the structure of ZSM-5 (Supplement
II). N2 adsorption isotherms indicated a well-developed micropore
volume (0.15–0.16 cm3 g1) and an external surface area corre-
sponding to the crystal size (Supplement III and Table 1). 27Al
MAS NMR spectra of the parent zeolites were measured by a Bru-
ker Avance 500 MHz (11.7 T) Wide Bore spectrometer using 4 mm
o.d. ZrO2 rotors with a rotation speed of 12 kHz. Proton high-power
decoupling pulse sequences with p/6 (1.4 ls) excitation pulses
were employed to allow quantitative evolution of the 27Al MAS
NMR spectra. The 27Al MAS NMR spectra of hydrated Na-ZSM-5
zeolites (Supplement IV) exhibited strong resonance with a chem-
ical shift of about 55 ppm corresponding to the tetrahedrally coor-
dinated Al atoms in the zeolite framework. Octahedral Al with a
resonance of about 0 ppm was not observed. Table 1 gives the
characteristics of NH4-ZSM-5 obtained by the three-fold ion ex-
change of Na-zeolites with 0.5 M NH4NO3 at RT, and their steamed
forms, (H)-ZSM-5st.

2.2. Preparation of Fe-zeolites
Fe was introduced into NH4-zeolites by their impregnation with
anhydrous FeCl3 in acetylacetone, following calcination and hydro-
lysis (for details see Ref. [34]). The samples are referred to as FeH-
Z1 and FeH-Z2 (Table 2). Parts of the calcined Fe-samples were
steamed at 600 C for 4 h in a stream of 30% water vapor and
35% O2 in He and denoted as Fe(H)-Z1st and Fe(H)-Z2st (Table 2).
The Fe-zeolites for the Mössbauer spectroscopy measurement of
the same chemical composition (57FeH-Z1 and 57FeH-Z2) were pre-
pared from identical parent NH4-zeolites using the same procedure
employing isotopically enriched 57FeCl3 (>96%). Steaming of the
isotopically enriched 57Fe-zeolites was also performed under the
same conditions.
2.3. Structural analysis of Fe-zeolites
The chemical compositions of the Fe-zeolites were determined
by X-ray ﬂuorescence spectroscopy using a PW 1404 (Philips)
instrument. The FTIR spectra of the zeolites evacuated at 450 C
were recorded at RT on a Nicolet Nexus 670 FTIR spectrometer
equipped with a MCT-B detector operating at 2 cm1 resolution
by collecting 200 scans for a single spectrum. The concentration
of acidic Brønsted and Lewis sites in H-ZSM-5 and Fe(II) sites in
Fe-zeolites was determined by the adsorption of d3-acetonitrile
at RT on the evacuated zeolites from the intensities of the charac-
teristic IR bands of the C„N vibrations. The extinction coefﬁcients
for the corresponding C„N vibrations were taken from Ref. [55].
The UV–Vis spectra of the dehydrated Fe-zeolites were measured
in the range from 4000 to 50,000 cm1 using a Perkin-Elmer Lamb-
da 950 spectrometer equipped with a Spectralon™integration
sphere, also used as a reference. The samples were dehydrated at
100 C for 30 min and evacuated at 450 C for 3 h. The spectra were
processed according to the Schuster–Kubelka–Munk equation:
F(R1) = (1  F(R1))2/2R1. H2-TPR experiments were carried out
using an Altamira AMI 200 instrument. Prior to the H2-TPR analy-
sis, the Fe-zeolites were dehydrated in a stream of air at 450 C for
1 h. The N2O pre-treatment, if employed, was performed at 200 or
400 C on the dehydrated zeolites. The reduction in Fe-zeolites by
hydrogen was carried out in an H2/Ar stream (9.44 vol.% H2) at a to-
tal ﬂow rate of 30 ml min1 and linear heating rate of 10 C min1
up to 800 C. Mössbauer spectroscopy measurements were carried
out on 100 mg self-supporting pellets (10 mm in diameter) of
57Fe-ZSM-5 placed in a laboratory-made chamber. Mössbauer
spectra were collected at RT on samples after (i) evacuation at
450 C for 3 h, following interaction with (ii) O2 at 450 C for
30 min and evacuation at 450 C for 5 min, or (iii) N2O at 400 C
for 30 min and evacuation at 400 C for 5 min, or (iv) with pro-
pane/N2O (1:1 molar) followed by evacuation at 400 C for 5 min.
57Co in an Rh matrix was used as a source of c rays. The maximum
velocity of the source was 12 mm s1; the velocity scale was
calibrated by a-Fe. The spectra were deconvoluted into Lorentz-
ian-shaped components using the MossWinn software. The com-
ponents were characterized by the Mössbauer parameters, the
isomer shift (IS), and quadrupole splitting (QS) providing for the
valence state and coordination, respectively.
2.4. Catalytic experiments
Oxidation of propane with nitrous oxide over Fe-zeolites was
carried out in a bed-plug ﬂow-through quartz micro-reactor
(I.D. = 4 mm) with 50 mg of the catalyst (grains of 0.3–0.6 mm)
pre-treated at 450 C in a stream of He (50 ml min1) for 30 min.
The reaction mixture, consisting of 1.5% N2O and 1.5% C3H8 in
He, was maintained at a total ﬂow rate of 100 ml min1 with cor-
responding WHSV 3.5 h1. The reactant and product gas composi-
tions were analyzed using a combination of an online-connected
GC (HP 6890) and a quadrupole mass spectrometer (Pfeiffer Omni-
Star, GSD 301 C). Two gaseous samples were simultaneously in-
jected
through
10-port
valves
into
two
branches
of
a
GC
equipped with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD) and a ﬂame
ionization detector (FID). In the ﬁrst branch, an HP-PLOT Q capil-
lary column (30 m, 0.53 mm  40 lm ﬁlm thickness) and an FID
were used for analysis of the hydrocarbons. A TCD and Hysep
column (packed column), a HP-Plot Q column (30 m, 0.53 mm
 40 lm ﬁlm thickness), and a molecular sieve 5A column (30 m,
0.53 mm  25 lm ﬁlm thickness) were used for the analysis of
O2, N2, N2O, CO, and CO2 in the second branch. The Hysep column
was used for the retention and removal of organic compounds and
water. In addition to propene, CO and CO2 as the major products,
small quantities of methane, ethane, ethene, traces of butanes, bu-
tenes, and benzene were found. As the yields of these products

Temperature-programmed oxidation (TPO) was used for analysis
of the hydrocarbon deposits on the catalysts during the reaction
after time-on-stream (TOS) of 4 h. A mixture of 50% O2 in He with
a total ﬂow rate of 50 ml min1 was employed at an increasing
temperature yielding CO, CO2, and H2O continuously monitored
by an online-connected mass spectrometer (Pfeiffer OmniStar,
GSD 301 C). The carbon balance based on the mass of propane con-
verted and the sum of the products (C1AC6 hydrocarbons, CO, CO2
and coke deposits) was within the 10% uncertainty interval. The
nature and amount of hydrocarbon residues deposited on the
catalysts after TOS of 240 min were estimated by temperature-
programmed oxidation in an oxygen stream from 25 to 650 C.
The N2O decomposition was followed at 400 and 425 C using a
U-shaped ﬂow-through reactor. Before the test, the catalyst
(50 mg, 0.3–0.6 mm) was pre-treated in situ in a helium stream
at 450 C for 2 h, followed by its treatment in an oxygen stream
for 1 h at the same temperature. The ﬂow rate of nitrous oxide
(1000 ppm) in He as a carrier gas was 300 cm3 min1, correspond-
ing to GHSV of 180,000 h1. Analysis of the gas composition at the
reactor outlet was performed using an Advance Optima IR analyzer
(ABB Co., Germany).
To check if the reactions take place in a kinetic regime, a
catalyst weight of 17 mg, carrier gas ﬂow of 100 cm3 min1, and
N2O concentration of 1000 ppm, that is, the identical GHSV
180,000 h1 were used. The obtained N2O conversions over FeH-
Z2 (2.1% and 4.8% at 400 and 425 C, cf. Table 6) showed absence
of external mass and heat transfer. As for the mass transfer inside
the crystals, the close values of TOF per Fe for N2O decomposition
(7.2  104 and 9.3  104 s1, respectively) and propane oxida-
tion (0.054 and 0.064 s1, resp.) at 400 C, and similar distribution
of Fe species in Fe-HZ1 and FeH-Z2 samples (see the structure anal-
ysis in Section 3.3) excluded signiﬁcant effect of intra-crystalline
diffusion.
3. Results
3.1. FTIR spectra of FeH-ZSM-5 and Fe(H)-ZSM-5st
Fig. 1 shows the FTIR spectra in the region of hydroxyl group
vibrations of H-ZSM-5 and FeH-ZSM-5 and after their steaming
(all evacuated at 450 C). The variable light scattering on crystals
of different size could affect the intensities of the spectral compo-
nents. Nevertheless, comparison of the band intensity of the indi-
vidual samples before and after the Fe introduction and after the
steaming enabled the analysis of the structural changes with re-
spect to Fe and Al-related acid sites. The coordination of Fe ions
to bridging oxygen atoms of the framework is documented by an
intensity decrease in the band at 3610 cm1 of the stretching vibra-
tion of the bridging hydroxyls, while the band of terminal silanols at
3745 cm1 was unchanged (Fig. 1A). Steaming of FeH-zeolites at
600 C at 30% water vapor produced a considerable loss of the
bridging hydroxyls and partial loss of the terminal silanols. The
decreased concentration of hydroxyls is consistent with the
removal of Al from the framework with formation of extra-
framework Al species and condensation of silanol groups. Low-
intensity bands appearing at 3660 and 3786 cm1 were ascribed
to OH groups bound to perturbed framework Al atoms and extra-
framework Al atoms or Fe ions and to OH groups on agglomerated
Al2O3-type species [56,57]. As all these groups easily dehydroxy-
late, they cannot be used as a measure of the concentration of
extra-framework Al and Fe species [57,58].
Adsorption of d3-acetonitrile on the H-ZSM-5 and their steamed
forms resulted in the complete disappearance of the band at
3610 cm1 with the appearance of the bands at 2298 and
2325 cm1 of the stretching vibrations of C„N groups interacting
with Brønsted and Al-Lewis sites, respectively (Fig. 1B). Their
quantitative analysis using the extinction coefﬁcients from Ref.
[55] is given in Table 1. Parent H-ZSM-5 exhibited highly predom-
inant Brønsted sites with low concentration of Lewis sites. The
steaming at 600 C led to a substantial decrease in the concentra-
tion of the Brønsted sites consistent with the release of Al from
the framework.
d3-Acetonitrile adsorbed on FeH-ZSM-5 and Fe(H)-ZSM-5st
resembled Al-Lewis sites at 2325 cm1 and the band with maxi-
mum around 2300 cm1 (Fig. 1B), which was shifted to lower or
higher frequencies depending on the relative concentration of the
bridging
SiOHAl
groups
and
Fe
ions.
While
the
band
at
2325 cm1 reﬂected exclusively Al-Lewis sites, the band around
2300 cm1 represented an overlap of the C„N vibrations interact-
ing with the Brønsted sites (2298 cm1) and Fe(II) ions behaving as
electron-acceptor Lewis sites (2303 cm1). The individual frequencies
were determined by the step-by-step desorption of d3-acetonitrile
occurring at increasing temperature preferably from the Brønsted
SiOHAl sites (not shown). Supplement V shows deconvolution of
the IR bands of the C„N groups on Fe-zeolites. Both steamed
Fe(H)-ZSM-5st zeolites exhibited a shift in the absorption maxi-
mum from 2300 to 2303 cm1 and its much lower intensity com-
pared to the FeH-zeolites. Thus, much lower concentrations of
structural OH groups and bare Fe(II) ions were found in the
Fe(H)-ZSM-5st
in
comparison
with
FeH-ZSM-5
zeolites.
The
estimated concentrations of SiOHAl, Fe(II) ions and Al-Lewis sites
are given in Table 2; note that the extinction coefﬁcients of C„N
interacting with Fe(II) and Al-Lewis sites are roughly twice those
for compounds with Brønsted sites [59].
3.2. H2-TPR
Figs. 2 and 3 compare the H2-TPR proﬁles of the FeH-ZSM-5 and
steamed Fe(H)-ZSM-5st zeolites pre-treated in a stream of air
(450 C) and after their interaction with N2O at 200 and 400 C.
All FeH-ZSM-5 oxidized at 450 C exhibited broad non-symmetri-
cal hydrogen consumption from 250 up to 450 C with maximum
at about 400 C. For both the steamed Fe(H)-ZSM-5st zeolites com-
pared to FeH-ZSM-5, approximately twice as much hydrogen was
consumed, and the reduction maximum was shifted from 400 to
460 C. Both FeH-ZSM-5 after interaction with N2O at temperatures
as low as 200 C (but not the steamed samples) exhibited a sharp
peak at 230 C, which was increased after N2O interaction at
400 C, and also appeared for the steamed zeolites (Fig. 2). At the
same time, the hydrogen consumption in a broad region from
250 to 450 C was practically not changed for the FeH-zeolites,
but was considerably higher for steamed zeolites (Fig. 3). Never-
theless, the steamed zeolites exhibited lower intensity of the peak
at 230 C. These results indicate that various types of Fe species are
present differing in their reactivity toward N2O.
The Fe(II) ions coordinated in the cationic sites to framework
oxygen atoms present in FeH-ZSM-5 (see the Mössbauer spectra
analysis in Section 3.1.3) are highly stabilized and did not undergo
reduction by hydrogen up to approximately 700 C, and conse-
quently, they are not reﬂected in the H2-TPR experiments. The
sharp reduction peak at 230 C is attributed to the reduction in
monoatomic oxygen from the Fe(III)AO species reduced to Fe(II)
[34]. The signiﬁcant reduction in Fe species in the broad region
250–450 C was also observed for low-loaded Fe-FER and Fe-MFI
with the Fe ions predominantly in cationic sites [34,60,61] This
corresponds to the structural conditions for their oxidation by
molecular oxygen, probably forming some di- and polynuclear
Fe-oxo species. Hydrogen consumption in a broad temperature
range indicates a variety in bonding of the Fe(III) species.

The shift in the temperature of hydrogen consumption to higher
temperatures (max. 460 C) and its doubling after the steaming of
FeH-zeolites showed an increase in the concentration of the Fe(III)
species with a lower tendency to be reduced (a decrease in the
range of 300–400 C). The broader range of reduction indicated a
change in the Fe-oxo species nuclearity. A reduction temperature
of up to 600 C by hydrogen was also found by others for Fe-
ZSM-5 with high Fe loading (Fe/Al 1), presumably containing
small Fe-oxide particles and Fe-loaded silica with supported Fe-
oxo oligomers and dispersed Fe-oxide species [60].
It follows that the reduction peak of FeH-ZSM-5 zeolites at
230 C reﬂects originally Fe(II) ions stabilizing monoatomic oxygen
(Fe(III)AO) and the reductions at 300–400 C of the Fe(III)-oxo
ions in cationic sites, forming dinuclear Fe(III)AOnAFe(III) and

small oligomeric Fe-oxo species. The zeolite steaming results in
fewer Fe(II) ions capable of binding an oxygen atom from N2O
(Fe(III)AO) and also in a decrease in the population of Fe(III)AOn-
AFe(III) species connected with the cationic sites (300–400 C), and
an increase in polynuclear oligomeric Fe-oxo species and Fe-oxide-
like species, reduced above 450 C.
3.3. Mössbauer spectra
In the Mössbauer spectra of Fe-zeolites, the isomer shift (IS) and
quadrupole splitting (QS) reﬂect the valence state and coordination
of
the
high
spin
Fe(III)
and
Fe(II)
complexes,
respectively
[1,35,47,52–54,62]. The Mössbauer spectra of the dehydrated
(evacuated at 450 C) FeH-ZSM-5 zeolites are presented in Supple-
ment VI. The IS and QS parameters obtained by the spectral decon-
volution using Lorentzian curves are listed in Table 3. The
parameters with the best ﬁt were obtained after the spectral
decomposition into four components. Similar parameters obtained
for two FeH-ZSM-5 samples of similar Fe/Al and Si/Al composition,
differing only in the crystal size support the validity of the decon-
volution. IS values between 0.7 and 1.4 mm s1 were assigned to
Fe(II), whereas those from 0.1 to 0.6 mm s1 were suggested to cor-
respond to Fe(III) ions [1,35,51,63,64]. Two components (D1, D2)
exhibiting IS > 0.9 mm s1 were attributed to Fe(II) ions. Their
sum represents a dominant fraction of the total Fe content (72%
for both FeH-Z1 and FeH-Z2). As the concentration of Fe in zeolites
is low (Fe/Al 0.15), and the Mössbauer spectra of the dehydrated
Fe-ferrierites
with
low
Fe
concentration
yielded
similar
parameters for the Fe(II) ions (IS = 1.02 mm s1, QS = 2.02 mm s1;
IS = 0.92 mm s1
QS = 0.44 mm s1;
IS = 0.94 mm s1
QS =
0.70 mm s1), see Ref. [54], we assigned the D1 and D2 compo-
nents in FeH-ZSM-5 (IS = 1.02 mm s1 and QS = 2.35, 2.37 mm s1
and IS = 0.92–0.93 mm s1 and QS = 0.78 mm s1) to the Fe(II) ions
in cationic sites balanced by two AlO
4 tetrahedra in the ring. Most
of the bare Fe(II) ions can be expected to be coordinated to the b-
type 6MRs containing two Al atoms at the intersection of the main
and sinusoidal channels of ZSM-5 and less at the a-type cationic
site (note that here, the a-type 6MR does not mean the a-type oxy-
gen atom of Panov) at the wall of the straight channel (for details
on the siting of divalent cations in ZSM-5, see Ref. [65], and on
the distribution of Al atoms in the framework controlling siting
of divalent cations, see Ref. [66]). The D1 doublet with the higher
QS (IS = 1.02 mm s1 and QS = 2.37 and 2.35 mm s1), indicating
lower symmetry of the Fe coordination, could be connected either
with the bare Fe(II) ions located above the a-type 6MRs or more
probably with some dinuclear oxygen bridged Fe(II)AOAFe(II) spe-
cies. The IS and QS parameters of the main D1 and D2 components
of Fe(II) ions reported here (Table 3) are close to the Mössbauer
parameters of Dubkov et al. [1] for Fe-ZSM-5 and to those of the
Fe(II) ions in ferrierite, where the Fe(II) ions are coordinated to
similar framework rings [35,67]. The low IS values of the D3 and
D4 components (0.31 and 0.47 mm s1) correspond to the presence
of Fe(III) species [1,51,53]. The high QS value of the D4 component
(QS = 2.16 mm s1) indicates the presence of the low-symmetry
Fe(III) species [35,51]. QS values ranging from 0.76 to 2.4 mm s1
are characteristic for l-oxo dinuclear Fe(III) complexes [1,35,68].
Therefore, the D3 component in FeH-ZSM-5 could be tentatively
attributed to two Fe(III) ions each located in the cationic site coor-
dinated to three or four oxygen atoms of the 6MR (containing two
Al atoms) and bridged by extra-framework oxygen atom(s) and
possibly also to Fe(III)O+ charge balanced by single AlO
4 species.
The D4 component was attributed to Fe(III) species in the close
to Oh-like structure of the Fe(III)-oxo oligomers [51]. The broad
absorption in the RT experiment (sextuplet at N2-temperature,
Refs. [20,51]), characteristic for large Fe-oxide species, was not ob-
served with FeH-zeolites; see also, absence of absorption in the
12,000–25,000 cm1 region of the Vis spectra (cf. Fig. 5).
The Mössbauer spectra of the steamed evacuated Fe(H)-ZSM-
5st zeolites were deconvoluted into ﬁve components (D1, D2, D3,
D5, D7) (Table 3). The IS and QS parameters of the D1 and D2 com-
ponents of the steamed zeolites were very similar to those of the
FeH-ZSM-5, and thus correspond to the Fe(II) ions in cationic sites.
But their intensities substantially decreased from 72% to 15% for
Fe(H)-ZSM-5st. The parameters of the D3 component, assigned to
the Fe(III)-oxo species with each located in a cationic site, changed
only slightly (IS = 0.35–0.36 mm s1 and QS = 1.94–1.98 mm s1)
as did their intensities. While the D4 component of the Fe(III) olig-
omers with Oh-like structure was found in the non-steamed zeo-
lites, two new components (D5 and D7) of the Fe(III) species
were characteristic for the steamed zeolites. The D5 component
(IS = 0.33 mm s1 and QS = 1.38 or 1.42 mm s1) suggested the
presence of Fe(III) in a distorted Td coordination, as proposed by
Lazar et al. [69], but Panov et al. assigned it to Fe(III) oligomers
[1]. Nevertheless, the IS and QS values of the D5 component found
in the steamed zeolites indicate lower symmetry of the close-
to-Td-coordinated Fe(III), in contrast to the Oh-coordinated Fe(III)
of the D4 component. This large difference in the occurrence of
oligomeric Fe(III) species in FeH-zeolites and Td-coordinated Fe(III)

ions in the steamed zeolites reﬂects not only a dramatic reorgani-
zation of the Fe(II) ions in cationic sites (a decrease in the concen-
tration of the Fe(II) species), but also a decrease in the oligomeric
Fe(III) structures and formation of a new type of Td-coordinated
Fe(III) in FeAAlASi extra-framework species. The intensity of the
D5 component of the Fe(III) Td species was estimated to be nearly
half of the total iron in Fe(H)-ZSM-5st. The broad background
(poorly resolved sextet) reﬂecting magnetic D7 component (IS
0.50 mm s1 and Bfh 40 and 41 T) could originate from the interac-
tion of paramagnetic Fe(III) species. It can be attributed to small
Fe-oxide particles, not to isolated Fe(III) oxo complexes or small
oligomers bound via cationic sites [1,62,70,71]. Thus, while Fe-
oxide particles were not present in FeH-ZSM-5, they represented
about one third of the total Fe in the steamed zeolites. Both the
Td-coordinated Fe(III) species (D5 component) and the Fe-oxide-
like species in the steamed zeolites appeared predominantly at
the expense of the bare Fe(II) ions in cationic sites and oligomeric
Fe(III) Oh species, while the dinuclear Fe(III)AOnAFe(III) species
were less affected (from 19% to 8% and 16% to 8% for Fe-Z1 and
Fe-Z2, respectively). Of particular interest is the massive formation
of close-to-Td-Fe(III) ions in FeAAlASi extra-framework species
and Fe-oxide-like particles in the both steamed Fe(H)-ZSM-5st zeo-
lites, not present in FeH-ZSM-5. Thus substantial changes were ob-
served in the state and coordination of the Fe ions after the zeolite
steaming by semi-quantitative analysis of the Mössbauer spectra.
In order to analyze the redox behavior of Fe centers, the
Mössbauer spectra of FeH-Z1 and Fe(H)-Z1st samples after their
interaction with O2 at 450 C, with N2O at 400 C, and propane/
N2O (1:1) at 400 C (followed by evacuation at 400 C in all cases)
were recorded (Fig. 4). Although we had in mind a rough approxi-
mation of the coordination of Fe(II) and Fe(III) ions obtained from
the spectral parameters, these experiments attempted to simulate
the state of Fe species under conditions close to those for N2O
decomposition and propane oxidation. The individual Fe species
in both the non-steamed and steamed zeolites exhibited a similar
type of reactivity toward O2, N2O and propane/N2O, but the popu-
lation of the individual Fe products was different (see Tables 4 and
5). The evacuated FeH-ZSM-5 zeolites mostly contained Fe(II)
species and only part of the Fe(II) ions in the cationic sites was oxi-
dized by molecular oxygen; roughly, 20% of the Fe(II) ions was oxi-
dized
(72–56%)
to
Fe(III)AOnAFe(III)
and
oligomeric
Fe-oxo
species. The oxidation of the bare Fe(II) ions in cationic sites was
already induced by N2O at 200 C (nearly, complete oxidation of
the Fe(II) ions was attained at 400 C). New D6 and D7 components
appeared, but practically, none of the Fe(III)AOnAFe(III) in the cat-
ionic sites (D3 component) were affected, and only a slight increase
in the concentration of oligomeric Fe(III)-oxo species (D4) was
observed. The parameters of the D6 component with IS = 0.38
and 0.32 mm s1 and QS = 1.09 and 0.94 mm s1 (for the non-
and steamed Fe-zeolites, respectively, see Tables 4 and 5), are close
to those assigned by Dubkov et al. [1] to Fe(III)AO species bearing
highly active oxygen. The D7 component represents the magnetic
features reﬂecting the mutually interacting Fe(III)AO species
[35,50,52]. The relaxation feature appears due to spin–spin interac-
tions within the Fe(III)AO complex. In total, 75% of the Fe(III)AO
species (D6 + D7 components) were formed in FeH-zeolites.
After FeH-Z1 interaction with propane/N2O at 400 C, the Fe
species mostly exhibited a divalent state (Fig. 4A and Table 4). D1
and D2 components predominated, especially in Fe(II)AOAFe(II)
species. Thus, the propane/N2O mixture represents a reducing
atmosphere for Fe species, and only a small amount of Fe(III) was
present. The ﬁtting procedure showed the presence of Fe(III) ions
in cationic sites but, as the oligomeric Oh Fe(III) possess close IS
and QS parameters, we can hardly quantify these Fe(III) species at
low concentrations. It should be pointed out that no D6 component
of Fe(III)AO was observed. An additional new D8 component

(IS = 1.50 mm s1, QS = 2.40 mm s1) appearing after the propane/
N2O interaction clearly showed divalent Fe(II) Td-coordinated spe-
cies [72]. We would not like to speculate on the type of these species,
as they might also represent the Fe(II)-ligand complexes originating
from the reactants. Further study is needed in this respect.
All these Mössbauer features in the oxidation of Fe-zeolites
were also observed for the steamed ones (Fig. 4B and Table 5),
but in different proportions. After evacuation, Fe(H)-Z1st contained
a much lower concentration (15%) of bare Fe(II) ions in the cationic
sites (D1, D2) and already contained Fe-oxide species exhibiting a
magnetic component. Most of the bare Fe(II) ions in the cationic
sites were oxidized by dioxygen into Fe(III)AOnAFe(III) and Fe-oxides.
The interaction of the Fe(II) ions with N2O at a lower temperature
(200 C) did not yield the D5 component of the Fe(III)AO species,
and these species appeared only at a higher temperature (400 C)
of interaction. Although the Fe(III)AO species yield characteristic
IS and QS parameters (D6 and D7 components), their quantitative
analysis could not be performed for the steamed zeolites, as the
magnetic component reﬂects not only the Fe(III)AO species, but
also other, not well-deﬁned Fe-oxides present.
Simulation of the in situ conditions of propane/N2O reaction at
400 C over the steamed Fe(H)-Z1st zeolite showed a predominant
concentration of Fe(II) ions (55%) in Mössbauer analysis, close to
the D1 component of the Fe(II)AOAFe(II) species, although the
evacuated steamed zeolite contained only 15% Fe(II) in the cationic
sites (see Tables 3 and 5). This ﬁnding together with a substantial
decrease in the concentration of Td-coordinated Fe(III) and dimin-
ishing of Fe(III)AOnAFe(III) in the cationic sites indicates that the
latter two species were reduced to Fe(II) and appeared as a D8
component in the spectrum. It is to be noted that even Fe-oxide
type species were mostly reduced in propane/N2O at 400 C as
no signiﬁcant intensity of D7 component was observed.
3.4. UV–Vis–NIR spectra
Fig. 5 compares the UV–Vis–NIR spectra of the FeH-ZSM-5 and
steamed Fe(H)-ZSM5st zeolites evacuated at 450 C. Both FeH-
ZSM-5 samples exhibited an intense broad absorption starting
from
approximately
28,000 cm1
with
maximum
around
40,000 cm1
with
a
distinct
shoulder
at
approximately
47,000 cm1, and well-resolved absorption at 30,500 cm1. The
band at 30,500 cm1 is observed for the hydrated FeH-ZSM-5 at
28,000 cm1 and has previously been ascribed to dinuclear Fe-
oxo complexes [73]. However, Pirngruber et al. [26] suggested that
it reﬂects larger Fe-oxo species as followed from the magnetic sus-
ceptibility measurements of hydrated Fe-zeolites. As shown by
Mössbauer spectral analysis (Section 3.3), the evacuated FeH-
ZSM-5 zeolites contained a predominant concentration of Fe(II)
and also Fe(III) species. The d–d transitions of the Fe(III) ions are
symmetry- and spin-forbidden [74], and the d–d transitions of
Fe(II) ions exhibit very weak transitions between 7000 and
10,000 cm1, reported only at high Fe concentrations in A-type
zeolites [75]. Albeit the spectral monitoring was performed here
with high sensitivity, we did not observe absorptions correspond-
ing to the d–d transitions of the Fe(II) ions. The observed intense
absorption bands of FeH-ZSM-5 could generally reﬂect O ? Fe(III)
ligand to metal charge-transfer transitions originating from both
extra-framework oxygen and framework oxygen atoms, although
a contribution of O?Fe(II) LMCT cannot be excluded.
High-energy absorptions of Fe ions above 33,000 cm1 have
been attributed to isolated Fe(III) ions with a frequency reﬂecting
their coordination as analyzed in Fe(III) isomorphously substituted
in silicalite [76]. The absorptions at 33,000–50,000 cm1, attrib-
uted to isolated Fe(III) [76], could reﬂect Fe(III)O+ species in FeH-
ZSM-5, but not bare Fe(III) ions (see the Discussion part). The
absorptions below 33,000 cm1 have been assigned to polynuclear
Fe-oxo complexes and those below 25,000 cm1 to Fe-oxide-like
particles [76]. The shift in the energy of the O ? Fe(III) CT transi-
tion to lower values might reﬂect an increasing number of FeAO
bonds in the di- and polynuclear Fe-oxo species like for that of
the
WOx
clusters
[77,78].
A
clear
absorption
maximum
at
30,500 cm1
could
thus
be
connected
with
the
dinuclear
Fe(III)AOnAFe(III) complex or another deﬁned polynuclear Fe(III)-
oxo complex, accompanied by the presence of polynuclear Fe-oxo
species reﬂected in lower energy of absorption [26,73,79]. A mini-
mum absorption intensity observed below 25,000 cm1 [79] as
well as the absence of the energy edge of bulk-like Fe2O3 (occurring
at 18,500 cm1 [73]) indicate the absence of larger particles of Fe-
oxide in any of the FeH-ZSM-5 zeolites. It should be mentioned
that the bare Fe(II) ions in the cationic sites predominating in
FeH-ZSM-5 might also exhibit a CT O ? Fe(II) transition from the
framework oxygen atoms, as observed for divalent bare Co(II) cat-
ions [59]. Moreover, some of the O ? Fe(III)/Fe(II) CT transitions
can occur outside the range of the UV–Vis spectrometers. There-
fore, it is concluded that all these uncertainties in the attribution
of the UV–Vis spectra to the individual Fe ion species in zeolites,
and the lack of knowledge of the extinction coefﬁcients of the CT
absorptions prevents their complete analysis.
In agreement with the results of Mössbauer spectroscopy, the
steaming of both FeH-zeolites was accompanied by changes in
the state of the Fe ions reﬂected in broadening of the CT absorption
of the Fe(III) ions. A signiﬁcant increase in the intensity around
33,000 and 47,000 cm1 and in the 18,000–25,000 cm1 region
was accompanied by an intensity decrease around 40,000 cm1,
while the absorption intensity around 30,500 cm1 was not greatly
changed. These ﬁndings reﬂect substantial reorganization of the Fe
species during zeolite steaming, particularly the formation of olig-
omeric entities and small Fe-oxide-like species (from approxi-
mately 28,000 cm1 down to 15,000 cm1) and Td-coordinated
Fe(III) species (absorptions around 47,000 cm1). The changes in
the UV–Vis spectra of Fe(III) species under zeolite steaming are re-
lated to a release of framework aluminum into extra-framework
sites, reﬂected in the decreased intensity of the IR vibration of

The above results of H2-TPR, FTIR, Mössbauer and UV–Vis
spectroscopy reﬂected substantial changes in the character and
concentration of the acid sites and Fe species after steaming of
FeH-zeolites under oxidizing conditions. Thus, two quite different
couples of samples (i) FeH-ZSM-5 with predominant concentration
of Fe(II) and less Fe(III) ions in the cationic sites and containing
strongly acidic structural OH groups, and (ii) the steamed Fe(H)-
ZSM-5st zeolites with low concentration of acidic protons, low
concentration of Fe(II) in cationic sites and high population of
Td-coordinated Fe(III) ions in the FeAAlASi extra-framework spe-
cies and small Fe-oxide particles have been obtained for investiga-
tion into their behavior in reactions of nitrous oxide (for summary
see Fig. 7). All these speciﬁc features of Fe counter-ion species re-
lated to changes in the structure and population of the Fe species,
their redox behavior, and population of acid sites during Fe-zeolite
steaming were observed for both FeH-ZSM-5 samples regardless of
the crystal size.
3.5. Nitrous oxide decomposition
Conversion of N2O to molecular elements and the turn-over-fre-
quency values per total Fe (TOF s1) at 400 and 425 C over FeH-
ZSM-5 and Fe(H)-ZSM-5st are given in Table 6. The TOF were
slightly lower for the nano-crystallites of FeH-Z1 sample exhibiting
larger portion of Al-Lewis sites, indicating slightly less developed
crystals (see Table 1) compared to FeH-Z2. A marked (ca three-
times) decrease in TOF at both temperatures was observed after
the steaming of both FeH-zeolites showing partial elimination of
Fe active sites for N2O decomposition.
3.6. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propene with N2O
Compared to N2O decomposition, the behavior of the non-
steamed and steamed Fe-zeolites in propane/N2O reaction was
more complex and reﬂected crystal size and changes occurring un-
der steaming with respect to acid sites. Fig. 6 depicts progressive
changes with TOS in the propane conversion, yield of propene
and CO/CO2 (COx), and the ratio of converted N2O/C3H8 at 400 C
over the FeH-ZSM-5 and Fe(H)-ZSM-5st zeolites. The correspond-
ing TOF per Fe with respect to the converted propane and formed
propene and COx for TOS of 5, 120, and 240 min are given in Table 7.
The initial (at TOS 5 min) TOFC3H8 of both FeH-ZSM-5 zeolites,
regardless of the crystal size, were similar and exhibited similar
decrease with TOS. These initial values were also not signiﬁcantly
affected by the steaming of both zeolites, although the structure of
Fe species was markedly changed as reported in Sections 3.1–3.4.
But the TOFC3H8 and propane conversion (Fig. 6A) over FeH-ZSM-
5 decreased with TOS much more compared to the steamed zeo-
lites. On contrary, the initial propene yields (and TOFC3H6) were
substantially higher for the steamed zeolites compared to non-
steamed ones, and moreover, much more stable values with TOS
were found. This ﬁnding might indicate much lower propene olig-
omerization/aromatization and oxidation of these side products as
a result of much lower concentration of Brønsted sites (decreased
of ca 80%, see Table 2) in the steamed zeolites. The development of
the selectivity of propane oxidation over FeH-zeolites with TOS
was namely found with larger crystals (2 vs. 0.15 lm); see
Fig. 6C and D. The initial ratio of consumed N2O to propane was
close to 2 for long TOS, but it together with the yield of COx much
more raised up, moreover at shorter TOS for FeH-Z2 (2 lm, 60 min)
compared to FeH-Z1 (0.15 lm, 180 min). Contrary to these obser-
vations, such development of converted N2O/propane ratio and
COx yield with TOS up to 240 min was not observed with both
the steamed Fe(H)-zeolites, where the yield of propene only
slightly decreased.
These results imply enhanced oligomerization of the formed
propene over both non-steamed zeolites owing to high concentra-
tion of acidic particularly Brønsted sites and accumulation of more
reactive polyoleﬁns and various oxygenates in TOS namely inside
the pores of larger (2 lm) crystals of FeH-Z2. As for low concentra-
tion of Lewis sites present, their contribution to oligomerization
processes cannot be excluded [80]. Beside propene oligomeriza-
tion, hydrogen transfer reactions leading to parafﬁns, cyclo-oleﬁns
and aromatics, up to coke-like polyaromatic compounds occurs. All
these reactions lead to partial blocking of zeolite pore and increas-
ing residence time of reaction products supporting non-selective
oxidation.
The concentration and character of the accumulated hydrocar-
bon products in the pores of FeH- and Fe(H)-ZSM-5st zeolites after
TOS of 240 min was estimated by the TPO of the spent catalyst
(Table 8). Two distinct maxima of the temperature of release of
COx (sum of CO and CO2) at about 470 and 525 C indicated two
major families of deposits, low temperature (LTC) and high-tem-
perature ‘‘coke’’ (HTC). The HTC could be mainly associated with

poly-condensed aromatic hydrocarbons, while LTC could represent
more reactive polyoleﬁns or some oxygenates, oxidized at lower
temperatures [81–83]. The total amount of deposits was substan-
tially lower (2–3 times) for the steamed Fe-zeolites (even at a com-
parable amount of converted propane) containing a higher portion
of ‘‘oleﬁnic’’ and ‘‘oxygenate’’ coke (LTC) in comparison with the
non-steamed zeolites, where aromatic coke (HTC) predominated.
It can be summarized that the role of the structure of Fe species
is not dominant for propane to propene oxidation, while the pres-
ence of acid sites and longer contact time in the pores of larger
crystals support oligomerization/aromatization of propene formed.
The accumulated polyoleﬁnic hydrocarbons in the pores are also
readily oxidized ﬁnally to COx by nitrous oxide and decrease the
selectivity to and propene yield (Fig. 6).
4. Discussion
4.1. Structure of Fe species in FeH-ZSM-5
As the counter Fe species in [Al]-substituted zeolites systemat-
ically exhibit much higher activity in reactions of N2O compared to
well-dispersed oligomeric and Fe-oxide species supported on silica
or silicalite as well as to extra-framework Fe originating from [Fe]-
substituted zeolites [31,33], the high N2O oxidation activity has to
be connected with the counter Fe ion species balanced by the neg-
ative charge of the framework AlO
4 tetrahedra. While in metal oxi-
des and aqueous metal salt solutions, the trivalent state of Fe ions
is thermodynamically preferred to a divalent one, the negative
charge of framework AlO

4 tetrahedra greatly stabilizes the Fe(II)
ions. High TOF values of oxidation of benzene to phenol [3] and
propane to propene by N2O [33] at low Fe concentration indicate
that the most active sites are well-dispersed Fe ions, probably Fe(II)
in cationic sites.
The interaction of H-zeolites with FeCl3 followed by hydrolysis,
with formation of a wide range of hydrolytic products, and calcina-
tion [42,84] can lead to the formation of various Fe species, such as
bare Fe(II) ions, monomeric, dimeric, and oligomeric Fe(III)-oxo
species, and small Fe-oxide-like species up to bulk Fe-oxides. The
populations of these species depend on the degree and conditions
of Fe incorporation on the one hand, and the AlO
4 distribution in
the parent zeolite framework governing the local negative charge
at the framework rings, on the other hand. In general, the Al atoms
in the ZSM-5 framework are predominantly (>95%) distributed
among (i) AlAOA(SiAO)2AAl sequences in the framework rings
of cationic sites (denoted as Al pairs) and (ii) distant single Al
atoms
occurring
in
different
rings
(AlAOA(SiAO)n>2AAl
sequences). The distribution of Al atoms in high-silica zeolites is
discussed in details in Ref. [66]. Although we did not investigate
here the effect of the distribution of framework Al atoms in the
presented zeolites on the structure of the incorporated Fe species,
the existing local negative charge should be considered to affect
the structure of the stabilized counter Fe ion species. At the low
Fe loadings of FeH-ZSM-5 (Fe/Al 0.15) reported here, the Fe species
are represented by counter-ion Fe species, predominantly by bare
Fe(II) ions, as also reported in Refs. [34,35,42,68,85], necessarily
charge balanced by Al pairs in the framework rings of cationic sites
(72% for both FeH-Z1 and FeH-Z2). As the ZSM-5 zeolites of Si/
Al > 12 do not contain AlAOASiAOAAl sequences in their frame-
work, as obtained by 29Si MAS NMR analysis (see Refs. [66,86]),
the absence of the latter SiAAl sequences implies the absence of
three Al atoms in the 6MRs of the cationic sites, and thus the
inability of ZSM-5 to coordinate bare Fe(III) ions. The Fe(III)-oxo
species represent a lower fraction in dehydrated auto-reduced zeo-
lites (see Table 3), where Fe ions of dimeric Fe(III)AOnAFe(III) are
balanced either by two Al pairs or presumably in oligomeric
Fe(III)-oxo species by single Al atoms. The bonding of Fe ion species
in cationic sites also follows from a decrease in the concentration
of the structural SiOHAl groups of FeH-ZSM-5 compared to the par-
ent zeolites (Fig. 1A and Table 2). The presence of bare Fe(II) ions
was demonstrated by their interaction with the C„N group of ad-
sorbed d3-acetonitrile, yielding a vibration frequency at 2303 cm1
(Fig. 1B and Table 2). The Fe(II)/Fe(III) distribution in FeH-ZSM-5 is
sensitive to the conditions of the zeolite treatment. While FeH-
zeolites evacuated at 450 C resulted predominantly in Fe(II) spe-
cies (72% Fe(II); see Fig. 4 and Tables 3 and 4), only a small fraction
of Fe(II) in FeH-ZSM-5 is oxidized by molecular oxygen at 450 C to
Fe(III). This shows high stabilization of the bare Fe(II) ions by
framework rings of the cationic sites containing two Al atoms (Al
pairs) as reﬂected in the D2 component of the Mössbauer spectra
(Table 3). The dinuclear Fe(II)AOAFe(II) species (D1 component
in Table 3) might represent Fe ions each coordinated to a frame-
work ring containing a single Al atom.
A possible model solution for the isolated Fe(III) ion would be
coordination of the OH ligand with a total complex charge of
(2+), as suggested, for example, in Refs. [42,87]. But such hydroxyls
dehydroxylate above 350 C with participation of skeletal protons
and are converted to Fe(II) ions. Fe(II) ions balanced by an Al pair
in the framework 6MR have a highly stabilized valence, not re-
duced to metallic Fe and with difﬁculty oxidized to Fe(III). Accord-
ingly, the hydroxy [Fe(III)OH]2+ species, if charge balanced by two
AlO
4 , can be either transformed to bare Fe(II) ions in cationic sites
or might form dinuclear Fe(III)AOnAFe(III) complexes with each of
the Fe(III) ions coordinated in the cationic site. Another possible

complex charge balanced by a single AlO

formed after dehydration into isolated Fe(III)O+. However, we have
no straightforward spectral evidence for the presence of these
complexes, which might be reﬂected in the UV–Vis spectra in the
region from 33,000 to 50,000 cm1. It is concluded that the single
Fe(II) ions and various Fe(III)-oxo and Fe(II)/Fe(III)-oxo oligomeric

complexes, and charge balanced by framework AlO

For illustration of the population of the individual Fe species, see
Fig. 7.
The formation of dinuclear Fe(II) or Fe(III) complexes bridged by
one or two oxygen atoms also depends on the distances between
the respective Fe ions and extra-framework oxygen atoms accept-
able for the formation of the FeAO bond. The dinuclear Fe(III)-oxo
complexes consisting of Fe(III) or Fe(II)/Fe(III) ions have been found
speciﬁcally at higher Fe loadings [2,20,88]. At Fe loadings (Fe/
Al  1) mostly prepared by FeCl3 sublimation, the presence of
dinuclear Fe-oxo complexes was clearly indicated by XANES, EX-
AFS [43] and magnetic susceptibility measurements [26], but their
quantitative analysis is not unambiguous [26].
Oxidation of FeH-ZSM-5 by N2O transforms Fe(II) to the
Fe(III)AO entities with the characteristic D6 (IS = 0.38 mm s1
and QS = 1.09 mm s1) and broad D7 magnetic relaxation compo-
nents, reﬂecting spin–spin interactions of the d1 and s1 electrons
within the Fe(III)AO complex (Fig. 4, Tables 4 and 5). A suggestion
on the radical character of the a-oxygen bound to the Fe(III) ions
given by Panov [1,9,89] is supported by its high reactivity, but no
direct experimental evidence has been reported. It should be
stressed that the concentration of the formed Fe(III)AO species
depends on the state of the Fe ions. Divalent Fe ions with an open
coordination sphere are candidates for binding oxygen atoms from
N2O. The temperature of Fe-zeolite evacuation [27,29] and temper-
ature and composition of NOx/CxHy/O2 and NOx/NH3/O2 reactant
mixtures [30,53,90,91] or propane/N2O reported here (Tables 4
and 5), are shown to highly affect the concentration of Fe(III)/Fe(II)
ions.
The estimation of the population of Fe(III)AO and Fe(III)-oxo
species based on the individual IS and QS parameters of the
Mössbauer spectra (Tables 4 and 5) is supported by the H2-TPR
of FeH-ZSM-5 (Figs. 2 and 3). While the Fe(III)AOnAFe(III) and olig-
omeric Fe(III)-oxo species are reduced at higher temperatures in a
broad temperature range from 300 to 500 C, the N2O already at
200 C produces a sharp peak at 230 C in the TPR, reﬂecting reduc-
tion in Fe(III)AO species. This very reactive Fe(III)AO species
[34], increases in concentration with increasing temperature of
the N2O interaction up to 400 C (Fig. 2), implying existence of
Fe(II) species of various reactivity with respect to N2O. The
Fe(III)AO entities formed from Fe(II) in the cationic sites, corre-
sponding to Panov’s a-sites [1], have been suggested as the most
active sites for hydroxylation of hydrocarbons. The high reactivity
of the Fe(III)AO entities and presence of a spectrum of Fe species
of various reducibility is also demonstrated by the interaction of
C3H8/N2O (1:1) at 400 C with FeH-Z1 yielding only bare and
bridged Fe(II) ions, oligomeric Fe(II), while only low concentration
of counter Fe(III)-oxo complexes was preserved (Table 4).

dinuclear Fe(III)AOnAFe(III) and small polynuclear Fe-oxo species,
while those down to 25,000 cm1 (Fig. 5) represent oligomeric Fe-
oxo species, as also manifested in H2-TPR. While Fe(III)O+ and
dinuclear Fe(III)AOnAFe(III) entities are reduced from ca 250 to
400 C, oligomeric Fe-oxo species consumed hydrogen at 400–
500 C (Figs. 2 and 3). The oligomeric Fe-oxo species (D4 compo-
nent, Table 3) might be connected with the rings containing single
Al atoms. The changes in the relative concentrations of the individ-
ual Fe(II) and Fe(III) species with the zeolite calcination in dioxy-
gen indicates transformation of part of the Fe(II) ions into Fe(III)
ions
in
the
cationic
sites
and
oligomeric
Fe-oxo
species
[26,73,79], while only N2O yields a very reactive Fe(III)AO entity
reﬂected in the D6 and D7 relaxation component (Table 4). How-
ever, the Fe(III)-oxo species themselves, if not previously reduced
to Fe(II) ions, could not contribute to the formation of Fe(III)AO,
as occurs with Fe(II) ions in cationic sites. On the other hand, the
Fe(III)-oxo species participates in redox-type reactions of hydro-
carbons occurring with molecular oxygen or NO/NO2 in their selec-
tive
catalytic
reduction

ammonia
or
hydrocarbons
[30,41,42,45,92].
4.2. Effect of the steaming on the acid sites and Fe ion species
It is well known that the steaming of H-zeolites is accompanied
by a release of the framework Al atoms into the extra-framework
sites, resulting in a substantial decrease in the concentration of
bridging OH groups, formation of Al-electron-acceptor sites and
alumina or aluminosilicate species in the pores, as observed in par-
ent H-zeolites (Fig. 1 and Table 1). The presence of Fe ions in cat-
ionic sites (like any other metal ions) stabilizes the adjacent
framework Al atoms [87]. But Al released into the pores mostly
from the framework Al atoms balanced by protons interacts with
Fe ions in the cationic sites (bare Fe(II) ions) and much less with
dinuclear Fe(II)AOAFe(II) and Fe(III)AOnAFe(III) species, as indi-
cated by the Mössbauer spectra (see Table 3). Thus, the steaming
results in major reorganization of Fe(II) in the cationic sites as well
as oligomeric Fe-oxo species, and in the appearance of a high con-
centration of Td-coordinated Fe(III) ions (component D5), accom-
panied by small Fe-oxide particles (magnetic D7 component,
Table 3). It can be speculated that Al atoms released from the
framework under steaming in an oxidizing atmosphere form some
aluminosilicate species, which encapsulate oxidized Fe(II) ions
originally located in cationic sites and Fe(III) oligomeric species.
In both steamed Fe-samples (dehydrated under vacuum), about
75% of Fe is in the form of Td-Fe(III) and small Fe-oxide particles,
while Fe(II) ions in cationic sites are low populated (15%), in con-
trast to the non-steamed FeH-ZSM-5 containing predominantly
Fe(II) ions (72%) as schematically summarized in Fig. 7.
The dramatic reorganization of the bare Fe(II) ions, induced by
the release of Al from the framework under steaming, is supported
by (i) the shift in the broad band with around 40,000–35,000 cm1,
(ii) its broadening below 25,000 cm1 and the appearance of the
energy edge at 18,500 cm1 in the UV–Vis spectra (Fig. 5), thus
reﬂecting an increase in the concentration of oligomeric species

and formation of Fe-oxide particles, and (iii) the shift in the reduc-
tion in Fe(H)-ZSM-5st zeolites by hydrogen to around 460 C, and
almost two-fold increase in hydrogen consumption, characteristic
for larger Fe(III)-oligomeric or oxide species (Figs. 2 and 3). These
ﬁndings indicate clustering of Fe(III)-oxo species to Fe-oxide parti-
cles, in agreement with Refs. [61,87,92,93], and binding of Fe(III)
species in an alumina or aluminosilicate amorphous particles.
The changes in the valence and structure of Fe complexes in-
voked by steaming are also reﬂected in the Fe(II)/Fe(III) transfor-
mations under evacuation, and interaction with dioxygen, N2O
and propane/N2O at the reaction temperature of 400 C (Table 5
Fig. 4B). All the remaining Fe(II) ions in the steamed Fe(H)-ZSM-
5st zeolites were oxidized by oxygen at 450 C. Practically no
Fe(III)AO entities were formed at 200 C under Fe(H)-Z1st interac-
tion with N2O, and 400 C was required for the Fe(III)AO formation
(component D6 and D7 in Table 5), as also indicated by the H2-TPR
results (Figs. 2 and 3). Although quantitative analysis of the
Fe(III)AO species by Mössbauer spectra in the steamed zeolites
was not possible (Table 5 and Fig. 4B), we can conclude that most
of the Fe(III) species (90%) present, that is, the Td-coordinated
Fe(III) associated with the FeAAlASi extra-framework species and
small Fe-oxide particles, were reduced in a propane/N2O (1:1) mix-
ture at 400 C (Table 5). Thus, the steamed Fe-zeolites interacting
with N2O yielded lower concentrations of Fe(III)AO compared to

FeH-ZSM-5, but in the presence of propane gave a comparable de-
gree of reduction in Fe(III) to Fe(II) regardless of the fact that the
original Fe species possessed a quite different structure (see
Fig. 7). This implies existence of a spectrum of Fe species, which
under suitable conditions for their reduction can provide Fe(II) ions
with an open coordination sphere available for the interaction with
N2O.
4.3. The effect of Fe species and acid sites in FeH- and Fe(H)-ZSM-5st
on nitrous oxide decomposition and propane oxidation by N2O
It is assumed that, in the transformation of N2O to molecular
products, the formation of a-oxygen of the Fe(III)AO complex is
very fast, while the rate-determining step is the formation of
molecular oxygen by recombination of two a-oxygen atoms or
their interaction with an additional N2O molecule [1,37]. Kapteijn
et al. [37] reported TOF per Fe equal to 1.7  102 s1 at 400 C
for the reaction of Fe site with N2O, and TOF 2.8  104 s1 for
the reaction of Fe(III)AO complex with N2O, as obtained from
the kinetics analysis. The TOF values per total Fe reported here
for
N2O
decomposition
over
both
FeH-zeolites
are
higher
(7.2  104 and 9.3  104 s1) indicating that more active or high-
er portion of the most active Fe sites are present in these zeolites.
The ﬁnding that the interaction of Fe site with N2O yielding
Fe(III)AO complex is faster is also proven here by the simulated
in situ reaction conditions at 400 C (monitored by Mössbauer
analysis at RT). It showed nearly quantitative transformation of
Fe(II) ions in the cationic sites of FeH-Z1 into Fe(III)AO complexes
(75% of Fe ions, see Table 4).
The steaming of FeH-zeolites, dramatically changing the struc-
ture of Fe species and resulting in that only approximately 20%
of the Fe(II) species originally present (see Table 3), yielded a sig-
niﬁcant decrease in TOF to 30% of the original value (to
2.2  104 and 3.0  104 s1). This ﬁnding might also be sup-
ported by a lower concentration of isolated Fe(III)AO in the
steamed Fe-zeolites, as shown by Mössbauer analysis (Table 5;
note that the population of Fe(III)AO can hardly be determined
due to relaxation component) and H2-TPR experiments (Figs. 2
and 3). It is to be mentioned that some contribution of the defective
sites [93] or adjacent Al-Lewis sites in the steamed zeolites [94]
(very low concentration here) to the recombination of a-oxygen

atoms to dioxygen or their reaction with N2O molecule cannot be
excluded.
It can be concluded that a clear and similar decrease in TOF of
N2O decomposition and concentration of Fe(II) in cationic sites
from FeH- to steamed Fe(H)-ZSM-5st zeolites (compared on evac-
uated samples), and an increased population of Fe(III)-oxo species,
particularly of Td-coordinated Fe(III) (Tables 3 and 5) indicate that
the most active sites for N2O decomposition are Fe(II) ions in cat-
ionic sites coordinated to framework rings containing an Al pair.
The reaction rate is controlled by the reaction step of the
Fe(III)AO complex with N2O transformed into molecular compo-
nents, while the ﬁrst step, the complex formation is very fast. High
TOF values were reached in this study as Fe-zeolites contained pre-
vailing concentration of bare Fe ions in cationic sites.
Conversion of propane with N2O occurs through its hydroxyl-
ation to propanol over an Fe(III)AO complex, followed by imme-
diate dehydration to propene (Eq. (4)), which could be further
transformed over acid sites to various oligomers, aromatics, and
to low hydrocarbons by their cracking, and on redox Fe sites to var-
ious oxygenates of polyoleﬁns, and carbon oxides.
The TOS analysis of conversion of propane, yields of propene
and CO/CO2, and relative consumption of N2O and character of
deposits formed compared over FeH- and steamed Fe(H)-zeolites
(Fig. 6 and Table 8) showed detrimental effect of the high concen-
tration of Brønsted sites on the propene yield and a decrease in
propane conversion. This is owing to oligomerization of propene
up to polyaromatics and enhanced oxidation of more reactive poly-
oleﬁns by N2O to oxygenates up to CO/CO2. This is in line with the
absence of this behavior in the steamed Fe(H)-zeolites containing a
very low concentration of Brønsted acid sites (Table 2). A sharp in-
crease in COx yield after 60 min of TOS for FeH-Z2 with larger crys-
tals (without signiﬁcant changes in propane conversion, see Fig. 6A
and C) and simultaneous increase in the ratio of converted N2O/
C3H8 in contrast to nano-size FeH-Z1 suggests longer residence
time of reactants in the restricted pores and accumulation of highly
reactive polyoleﬁns. It implies that beside the presence of active Fe
sites, the important conditions for selective oxidative dehydroge-
nation of propane with N2O is low concentration of Brønsted sites
and small crystallites enabling fast removal of propene from the
pores and thus suppressing its oligomerization.
The oxidation of propane by nitrous oxide over the individual
Fe species undoubtedly proceeds via the ‘‘a-oxygen’’ of the
Fe(III)AO complex formed by the interaction of Fe(II) ions with
N2O. Albeit the steamed Fe(H)-ZSM-5st exhibited much lower
concentration of bare Fe(II) ions in the cationic sites compared to
FeH-ZSM-5 (as analyzed after vacuum or oxygen heat pre-treatment,
cf. Tables 3–5), under the ‘‘in situ’’ conditions of propane/N2O/
400 C, about 90% of the Fe species for both FeH- and steamed
Fe(H)-Z1 was in a divalent state (Tables 4 and 5). The comparable
initial TOFC3H8 for non-steamed and steamed Fe-zeolites and the
higher TOFC3H6 for both steamed zeolites (Table 7), and reduction
in the most of Fe ions under reaction condition (Tables 4 and 5)
to a divalent state indicates that the concentration of Fe active sites
in non- and steamed zeolites was not signiﬁcantly different. It
suggests that, under the C3H8/N2O feed at the more reducing
conditions compared to those at N2O decomposition (see Tables
4 and 5), also the Fe(III)O+ and Fe(III)-oxo species attached to rings
with Al pairs or single Al atoms (dinuclear and oligomeric) in
FeH-zeolites as well as the Td-coordinated Fe(III) in the steamed
Fe-zeolites
connected
with
the
FeAAlASi
extra-framework
species are both reduced to Fe(II) ions. Thereafter these even less
reactive divalent Fe species could take part in the formation of
Fe(III)AO species, especially at temperature of 400 C.
There remains the question of the structure of the Fe sites active
in propane oxidation in the steamed Fe-zeolites, with highly
populated Td-coordinated Fe(III) connected with in the FeAAlASi
extra-framework species in the steamed zeolites. The high TOF
values per Fe observed at very low Fe loadings over Fe-ZSM-5 indi-
cated that the most active sites in benzene oxidation to phenol and
propane to propene are atomically dispersed Fe ions [3,31,33,95], but
a comparable activity of the non-steamed and steamed Fe-zeolites
(substantially differing in the concentration of bare Fe(II) ions in
cationic sites) indicates that, in propane/N2O, other Fe sites also
contribute to the reaction. This assumption is supported by the
much higher TOF for conversion of N2O in propane/N2O to propene
(ca 75 for FeH-Z1 and ca 270 for Fe(H)-Z1) compared to N2O
decomposition (cf. Tables 6 and 7). Pirutko et al. [7] also showed
that under the same concentration conditions over Fe-ZSM-5, the
N2O decomposition is approximately 100 times slower compared
to benzene/N2O reaction. We assume that the N2O decomposition
requires the presence of Fe(II) ions highly stabilized in the oxidiz-
ing atmosphere of this reaction, which is satisﬁed only by Fe(II)
ions in cationic sites balanced by two framework Al atoms. On con-
trary under the reducing conditions of the propane/N2O reaction,
the Fe species possessing lower reducing potential are also reduced
to Fe(II), like Fe(III)-oxo species balanced by single Al atoms and
even
Td-coordinated
Fe(III)
ions
bound
to
the
FeAAlASi
extra-framework species. All these Fe(II) sites form Fe(III)AO enti-
ties. Presumably, the activity of these Fe(II) species is lower
compared to Fe(II) in cationic sites, and they need a temperature
of 400 C for their interaction with N2O to form highly reactive
Fe(III)AO (cf. H2-TPR in Figs. 2 and 3, and Mössbauer analysis re-
sults). A signiﬁcant increase in the yield of selective products over
the steamed Fe-zeolites was also reported for benzene to phenol
[3,22,96] and propane to propene [95]. Our suggestion on the
activity of Td-coordinated Fe(III) species in propane oxidation in
the steamed Fe(H)-zeolites is in agreement with the reports of
Hensen et al. [22] and Ates et al. [97], who explained the increased
activity of steamed zeolites by the formation of an undeﬁned
Fe(III)-oxo species (‘‘FeAAlAO’’ species), closely connected with
Al present in the steamed zeolites. Nevertheless, beside the contri-
bution of these Fe species to the hydrocarbon oxidation, the con-
centration of Brønsted sites should be taken seriously into account.
From the above results we conclude that under the conditions
of propane/N2O, majority of Fe species in both FeH- and steamed
Fe(H)-ZSM-5 are reduced to Fe(II), while at N2O decomposition
Fe(III)AO highly prevail. It can be supposed that the rate-deter-
mining step of the propane oxidative dehydrogenation by nitrous
oxide is formation of Fe(III)AO from Fe(II) and N2O, contrary to
N2O decomposition, where the reaction is determined by the
Fe(III)AO recombination or its reaction with additional N2O mol-
ecule. The Fe(III)AO complex rapidly reacts with propane to
propanol dehydrated to propene. A further non-selective transfor-
mation of propene is controlled by the concentration of Brønsted
acid sites leading to propene oligomerization, and more reactive
oligomers are readily oxidized to various oxygenates and ﬁnally
to carbon oxides.
5. Conclusion
The critical function of the structure of Fe counter-ion species,
Brønsted sites and crystal size of Fe-ZSM-5 for propane oxidative
dehydrogenation to propene and N2O decomposition was eluci-
dated by using two series of Fe-zeolites with crystal size 0.15
and 2 lm differing in population of the individual Fe and Brønsted
sites. Firstly, FeH-ZSM-5 with predominant abundance of Fe(II)
ions in the cationic sites (72%), a minor part of the ion-exchanged
Fe(III)-oxo species (16–19%) and without an excessive formation of
oligomeric Fe(III) species (9–12%) and large oxide species were
prepared. Steaming of these Fe-zeolites at 600 C resulted in a
low concentration of Fe(II) ions and Fe-oxo species in the cationic
P. Sazama et al. / Journal of Catalysis 299 (2013) 188–203
201
sites. Predominant part of Fe was Td-coordinated Fe(III) (43–47%)
bound within extra-framework FeAAlASi species, and as Fe-oxide
particles (30–33%). It has been shown that the N2O decomposition
over Fe-zeolites is governed by the concentration of Fe(II) balanced
by Al pairs in the framework cationic sites. Formation of Fe(III)A
O by the reaction of Fe(II) with N2O is very fast and the rate-
determining step is the transformation of Fe(III)AO to molecular
oxygen. Under the reducing conditions of propane/N2O reaction
at 400 C not only Fe in cationic sites, but also Td-coordinated
Fe(III) in extra-framework FeAAlASi were reduced to Fe(II) ions
(90% of total Fe) in both the non-steamed and steamed Fe-zeolites.
Beside Fe(II) ions highly stabilized by framework rings with two
AlO
4 charges, also other Fe(III)-oxo species reduced to Fe(II) under
the conditions of propane/N2O reaction provide opportunity to
form Fe(III)AO, which immediately interacts with propane. The
turn-over-frequencies of propane/N2O reaction were of two orders
higher compared to those of N2O decomposition for both FeH- and
steamed Fe(H)-ZSM-5st zeolites. Therefore, the rate-determining
step in propane/N2O is suggested to be formation of Fe(III)A
O complex, immediately interacting with propane. Beside the
Fe(II) sites formed at the reaction conditions protonic sites contrib-
ute to the overall process of propane oxidation. The higher and sta-
ble yields of propene were achieved over the steamed Fe-zeolites.
That was mainly caused by the low concentration of protonic sites
limiting propene oligomerization. On contrary, with FeH-ZSM-5
and particularly of larger crystals, retention of more reactive poly-
oleﬁns in the pores in TOS increases their oxidation to CO/CO2.
