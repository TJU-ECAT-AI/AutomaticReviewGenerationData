Fe-ZSM-5 was prepared via solid-state exchange method using ferrocene as iron precursor and applied as
a model catalyst to investigate the reaction and deactivation mechanisms of the oxidative dehydrogena-
tion of propane (ODHP) with nitrous oxide. Characterization results reveal that after severe calcination
highly isolated Fe–O–Al species are the only exposed iron sites detectable, which account for ca. 60%
of the total iron species in Fe-ZSM-5. Results from temperature-programmed experiments and in situ
DRIFT spectroscopy suggest that the chemisorption of nitrous oxide on Fe–O–Al species leads to the for-
mation of stable mono-oxygen species, which can react with gaseous propane to produce propylene with
high selectivity. The accumulation of organic species in the catalyst is observed during the reaction, and
the major organic species are determined to be alkylbenzenes. The accumulation rate and the speciﬁc
constitution of alkylbenzenes are found to depend on the relative partial pressures of propane and nitrous
oxide: lower N2O/C3H8 ratios result in formation of aromatics with smaller kinetic diameter, which are
accumulated at a lower rate. This leads to lower deactivation rates and longer catalyst lifetimes. Remark-
ably, a superior stable propane conversion rate of ca. 13 mmol gcat
1 h1 and a propylene production rate of
ca. 6 mmol gcat
1 h1 can be kept for >40 h with a N2O/C3H8 ratio of 1:2.

1. Introduction
Light oleﬁns are very important components for the petrochem-
ical industry with increasing market demands in recent years. The
oxidative dehydrogenation of light alkanes provides a promising
route to produce light oleﬁns, and has therefore been widely stud-
ied. During the oxidative dehydrogenation of light alkanes with
dioxygen, carbon oxides (CO and CO2) are extensively formed by
over-oxidation even at moderate alkane conversions, resulting in
low oleﬁn selectivity and oleﬁn yield [1]. Recently, it has been pro-
posed to use nitrous oxide instead of dioxygen as oxidant, and the
oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes with N2O has attracted con-
siderable attention [2–13]. Iron-zeolites have been developed as
unique catalysts for the oxidative dehydrogenation of light alkanes
with N2O, especially the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to
propylene (ODHP).
Despite considerable research effort with respect to ODHP with
N2O over iron-zeolites, some problems are still to be solved before
the further development of this reaction. First of all, the reaction
mechanism of the ODHP with N2O is not quite clear yet. In the past
decades, activation and conversion of nitrous oxide on iron-zeo-
lites have been extensively investigated [14–19]. In the case of
the ODHP with N2O, the presence of the propane reductant in
the reaction system makes the conversion of nitrous oxide on
iron-zeolites much more complicated. For the design of effective
catalysts, it is important to know the different pathways for the
formation of the dehydrogenation product propylene and of by-
products. Another essential problem is the deactivation mecha-
nism of catalysts in the ODHP with N2O. Catalyst deactivation is
a key issue in the reaction of oxidative dehydrogenation, no matter
whether dioxygen or nitrous oxide is used as oxidant. In a general
sense, formation and deposition of coke on the catalyst surface are
responsible for catalyst deactivation. However, the speciﬁcation of
coke and its origin are not fully understood. Accordingly, there is
no effective means to prevent the deposition of coke and to
increase the catalyst lifetime in the ODHP with N2O.
In our previous work, Fe-ZSM-5 prepared via a solid-state
exchange method using ferrocene as iron precursor has been found
to exhibit superior performance for the ODHP with N2O after a
severe calcination. A maximal initial propylene yield of 30% at a
high turnover frequency of 0.037 s1 could be obtained [20].
Fe–O–Al species were identiﬁed as the active sites. Their simple

constitution and the almost complete absence of Brønsted acid
sites make this Fe-ZSM-5 material an ideal model catalyst for
studying the ODHP with N2O. The present work aims to present
a detailed study on this reaction over Fe-ZSM-5, with emphasis
on the reaction and deactivation mechanism.
2. Experimental
2.1. Sample preparation
ZSM-5 zeolite in its H-form (Sinopec, Si/Al = 24, Fe impurity:
60 ppm) was employed as host for iron species. Fe-ZSM-5 was
prepared by solid-state exchange using ferrocene as iron source
[21]. In a typical experiment, ca. 3 g of the zeolite was placed in
a quartz reaction chamber connected to a vacuum line and treated
at 5 * 102 Pa and 573 K for 4 h. After cooling to 323 K, the reaction
chamber was transferred into a glove box and 0.5 g ferrocene was
dumped onto the dried zeolite. Subsequently, the chamber was
heated to 423 K and kept at this temperature under vacuum for
24 h to insure the complete surface reaction between ferrocene
and the zeolite Brønsted acid sites. The resulting solid was calcined
in ﬂowing air (H2O level of 200 ppm) at 1073 K for 6 h. It will be
denoted as Fe-ZSM-5-G. For reference, Fe-ZSM-5 was also prepared
by conventional solid-state ion exchange using FeCl3 as iron pre-
cursor. In a typical experiment, 1 g zeolite sample was mechani-
cally mixed with 0.5 g FeCl3 in the glove box and the mixture
was placed in a sealed reactor. The reactor was heated to 573 K
at 10 K/min and kept at this temperature for 2 h. The resulting
solid was thoroughly washed with deionized water, dried at
353 K overnight and calcined in ﬂowing air at 1073 K for 6 h. The
product will be denoted as Fe-ZSM-5-E.
2.2. Sample characterization
FTIR spectra in diffuse reﬂection mode, i.e. DRIFTS, with the
probe molecule NO were collected on a Bruker Tensor 27 spec-
trometer (64 scans, resolution – 2 cm1). A self-supporting pellet
made of the catalyst sample was placed in the reaction chamber
(Harrick, Praying Mantis CHC-CHA-3) and pretreated in ﬂowing
He at 773 K for 1 h. After cooling to room temperature in ﬂowing
He, the He stream was switched to 1%NO/He and a series of
time-dependent DRIFT spectra were recorded, which will be
reported in terms of the Kubelka–Munk (K–M) function below.
Si, Al and Fe contents in the samples were analyzed by a Perkin
Elmer Optima 2000 inductively coupled plasma optical emission
spectrometer (ICP-OES). The samples were dissolved in hot aqua
regia with the addition of several drops of HF. Before ICP analysis,
the excess acid in solution was removed by heating at constant
temperature of 453 K.
The amounts of organic compounds deposited on Fe-ZSM-5 cat-
alyst after ODHP with N2O were analyzed by thermogravimetry
(TG) on a Setram Setsys 16/18 thermogravimetric analyzer. In a
typical measurement, 0.1 g of Fe-ZSM-5 after 400 min time-
on-stream in ODHP was pretreated at 373 K in an Al2O3 crucible
to remove the physisorbed water/organic and then heated to
1273 K at a constant rate of 10 K min1 and under ﬂowing syn-
thetic air of 30 mL min1.
The

organic
compounds
occluded
in
the
channels of Fe-ZSM-5-G catalyst after ODHP with N2O was ana-
lyzed by gas chromatography with mass-spectrometric detection
(GC–MS). Typically, 0.3 g catalyst sample after reaction was care-
fully dissolved in 10 mL 1 M HF solution. The solution was treated
with 10 mL CH2Cl2 to extract the organic compounds and the resid-
ual water was removed by the addition of sufﬁcient sodium sulfate
solid. Then, 1.0 lL CH2Cl2 organic extract was analyzed by GC–MS
(Agilent 7890A/5975 MSD) with a DB-5 MS column (30 m,
0.25 mm i.d., stationary phase thickness 0.25 lm). The following
temperature program was employed: isothermal at 313 K for
6 min, heating to 553 K with a rate of 10 K min1, and isothermal
at 553 K for 10 min.
2.3. Isothermal transient response experiments
Isothermal transient response experiments were performed in a
quartz plug-ﬂow reactor at atmosphere pressure. Pure He was fed
to the reactor loaded with a Fe-ZSM-5 sample (pretreated in ﬂow-
ing He at 773 K for 1 h) at 20 mL min1 and transient pulses of pure
nitrous oxide (100 lL per pulse) were injected into the feed stream
via an electronic six-port valve. The reactor outlet was on-line ana-
lyzed by using a quadrupole mass spectrometer (Pfeiffer Omnistar
QIC 20).
2.4. Temperature-programmed experiments
Temperature-programmed desorption
and surface
reaction
(abbreviated as TPD and TPSR, respectively) experiments were per-
formed in a quartz plug-ﬂow reactor at atmospheric pressure. Gen-
erally, the inlet gas mixture was fed to the reactor through four
mass-ﬂow controllers (Seven Star D-07) and the reactor outlet
was analyzed by using a quadrupole mass spectrometer (MS) in
the multiple-ion detection mode. The following main mass frag-
ments (m/e) were recorded: 4 (He), 18 (H2O), 28 (N2, N2O, CO),
30 (N2O), 32 (O2), 40 (Ar), 43 (C3H6), 44 (N2O, CO2), 45 (C3H8), 56
(acrolein), 58 (allyl alcohol), 91 (toluene, MB), 105 (xylene, DMB)
and 106 (ethylbenzene, EB). The presence of NO and NO2 under
our reaction conditions could be excluded according to the results
from a chemiluminescence NOx analyzer (Ecotech EC 9841).
Calibration was carried out with mixtures of known gas composi-
tion. If more than one component contributed to a mass fragment,
a second mass was used to distinguish the different components.
For TPSR, the catalyst sample was pretreated in He at 773 K for
1 h and cooled to 473 K in ﬂowing He. The catalyst was then con-
tacted with the reactant gas mixture (N2O/He or N2O/C3H8/He) for
30 min, subsequently TPSR was performed from 473 to 873 K at a
heating rate of 10 K min1 and the reaction outlet was monitored
by an on-line MS. For TPD, the catalyst sample was also pretreated
in He at 773 K for 1 h and cooled to 473 K in ﬂowing He. After the
saturated adsorption of N2O/He or O2/He at 473 K, the sample was
cooled to 373 K and purged with He for 30 min. Finally, TPD was
performed in ﬂowing He from 473 to 873 K at a heating rate of
10 K min1 and the outlet was monitored by on-line MS.
2.5. In situ DRIFTS study
In situ DRIFT spectra were recorded on the Bruker Tensor 27
spectrometer, equipped with a liquid N2 cooled MCT detector.
The catalyst samples of ca. 25 mg were ﬁnely ground and placed
in the reaction chamber (Harrick, Praying Mantis CHC-CHA-3).
Prior to each experiment, the sample was pretreated in He at
773 K for 1 h and cooled to the desired temperature for taking a
reference spectrum. Then, the designed reaction gas mixture was
fed to the sample and DRIFT spectra were recorded (128 scans at
a resolution of 4 cm1).
2.6. Steady-state catalytic reaction
The catalytic evaluation was performed in a ﬁxed-bed ﬂow
micro-reactor at atmospheric pressure. Typically, 0.2 g catalyst
sample (sieve fraction of 0.17–0.25 mm, ca. 0.2 mL) was placed in
a quartz reactor (4 mm i.d.) and pretreated in He at 773 K for 1 h.
After cooling to designed temperature, the reactant gas mixture
(C3H8 + N2O = 22.5%, He balance, realized by three independent

mass-ﬂow controllers for C3H8, N2O and He) was fed to a total ﬂow
rate of 50 mL min1, corresponding to a gas hourly space velocity
(GHSV) of 15,000 h1. The reaction was conducted isothermally
and the gas products were analyzed by using two on-line gas chro-
matographs. One of them was equipped with a Plot Q capillary col-
umn and a FID detector for the analysis of organic products, the
other with two packed columns (Porapak Q and Carbon Molecular
Sieve TDX) and a TCD detector for the analysis of N2O, N2, O2 and
COx. The water was removed from the gas products before the
chromatograph inlet and a possible small change of the reaction
volume was neglected in the formulas used for conversion, selec-
tivity and yield calculations.
3. Results
3.1. Characterization of active iron sites
The physicochemical properties of Fe-ZSM-5 employed in this
study have been characterized by a series of techniques, e.g. XRD,
27Al-MAS-NMR and NH3-TPD, and the Fe sites have been studied
by means of UV–Vis, TEM, and H2-TPR. For conciseness, some char-
acterization results are shown in the Supporting information
(Figs. S1–S6), and detailed analysis of results can be found in our
previous work [20]. Brieﬂy, framework Al species dominate in Fe-
ZSM-5-G (27Al-MAS-NMR, Fig. S2) and the almost complete
absence of Brønsted acid sites (NH3-TPD, Fig. S3) indicates the
attachment of iron species to aluminum via oxygen. The iron spe-
cies in Fe-ZSM-5-G exist in the form of isolated ferric ions or oligo-
nuclear FexOy clusters (UV–Vis, Fig. S4), which are almost invisible
in the TEM (Fig. S5). This is also conﬁrmed by the reduction of fer-
ric ions to ferrous ions by hydrogen (H/Fe = 1.2) in the temperature
range of 400–900 K (H2-TPR, Fig. S6). A summary of relevant phys-
icochemical properties of Fe-ZSM-5 under study is displayed in
Table 1.
FTIR spectroscopy with NO probe is an efﬁcient technique for
the characterization of exposed iron sites in zeolites. It is sensitive
to ferrous ions due to the preferential interaction of NO with Fe2+
[22–24]. Therefore, our Fe-MFI samples previously calcined in air
were further treated at elevated temperature (773 K) under inert
atmosphere to induce the auto-reduction of ferric ions to ferrous
ions (No obvious adsorption of NO on iron sites was observed with-
out auto-reduction pre-treatment) [25,26]. Fig. 1 shows the DRIFT
spectra of NO adsorption on Fe-ZSM-5 samples at room tempera-
ture. NO adsorption on Fe-ZSM-5-G results in an obvious IR band
at 1875 cm1, which has been ascribed to mono-nitrosyls on
Fe2+–O–Al nanoparticles in literature [27]. However, considering
that nanoparticles are scarce in our Fe-ZSM-5-G sample (UV–Vis,
Fig. S4; TEM, Fig. S5), we prefer to ascribe the band at 1875 cm1
to mono-nitrosyls on rather isolated Fe2+–O–Al species. The inten-
sity of this band increases dramatically at the initial stage up to
3 min, and then decreases gradually with the further extension of
adsorption time. Meanwhile, several IR bands at 1645, 1615 and
1580 cm1 corresponding to nitro and nitrate species [22,28]
appear due to the oxidation of mono-nitrosyls by residual oxygen,
either from NO gas or from the Fe-ZSM-5 sample, and their
intensities gradually increase with the extension of adsorption
time. Obviously, Fe2+–O–Al species are present as exclusive detect-
able iron species in Fe-ZSM-5-G after treatment in He at 773 K. NO
molecules are initially adsorbed on Fe2+–O–Al species in the form
of nitrosyls and then gradually transformed into nitro and nitrate
species (see Table 2).
In the case of Fe-ZSM-5-E, NO adsorption results in two IR
bands at 1875 and 1845 cm1 in the nitrosyl region. While the
band at 1875 cm1 arises from the Fe2+–O–Al species just men-
tioned [24,27], the band at 1845 cm1 has been assigned to
mono-nitrosyls on ferrous ions in the straight channels of ZSM-5
[29,30]. Since the latter band is rather broad in shape, we prefer
to attribute it to mono-nitrosyls on ferrous ions in oligonuclear
FexOy clusters in the straight channels of ZSM-5 [27]. With the
duration of adsorption, mono-nitrosyls on Fe2+–O–Al species grad-
ually transform into nitro and nitrate species (IR bands at 1675,
1640, 1605 and 1580 cm1) and mono-nitrosyls on oligonuclear
clusters accumulate to some extent. Based on the DRIFT spectra
of NO adsorption on Fe-ZSM-5-G and Fe-ZSM-5-E, it is quite evi-
dent that different iron sites are formed in Fe-ZSM-5 prepared by
solid-state ion exchange using different iron precursors, i.e. ferro-
cene and FeCl3.
The amount of ferrous sites in Fe-ZSM-5 accessible to the gas
phase was quantitatively analyzed by pulse adsorption of N2O on
activated samples, based on the method employed in literature
[31–33]. Fig. 2 shows that N2O and N2 signals can be observed in
the outlet when nitrous oxide pulses were administered to the
Fe-ZSM-5 sample at 473 K, while no molecular dioxygen was
detected at the outlet during the whole process. The concentration
of accessible iron sites can be measured from both the amount of
N2 released and the amount of N2O consumed. The density of
accessible iron sites was estimated to be 4.3 * 1019 and 5.2 *
1019 g1for Fe-ZSM-5-G and Fe-ZSM-5-E, respectively. Related to
the total iron contents, ca. 60% of total iron species are accessible
ferrous sites in Fe-ZSM-5-G, while only ca. 20% total iron species
are accessible ferrous sites in Fe-ZSM-5-E. This conﬁrms that the
iron species in Fe-ZSM-5-G are extremely disperse, i.e. isolated
Fe–O–Al species.
3.2. TPSR and TPD results
Fig. S7 shows the TPSR results of N2O decomposition over
Fe-ZSM-5. It is seen that both Fe-ZSM-5-E and Fe-ZSM-5-G are
active catalysts for this reaction. Typically, N2O conversion starts
at 650 and 700 K for Fe-ZSM-5-E and Fe-ZSM-5-G, respectively,
and the overall decomposition of nitrous oxide can be obtained
at ca. 800 K for both catalysts.
The TPSR results of ODHP with N2O over Fe-ZSM-5 catalysts are
shown in Fig. 3. The presence of propane in the reaction system
greatly promotes N2O conversion at relative low temperatures of
<650 K. Propane conversion over Fe-ZSM-5 ﬁrst increases with
the reaction temperature, reaches a maximum at ca. 725 K, and
then begins to decrease. Propylene and COx (CO and CO2) are
observed as the main products from the oxidation of propane cat-
alyzed by both Fe-ZSM-5-E and Fe-ZSM-5-G. A much higher per-
centage of propylene is observed over Fe-ZSM-5-G than that over
Fe-ZSM-5-E, indicating the higher propylene selectivity in the
ODHP with N2O over Fe-ZSM-5-G. This should be due to the
absence of Brønsted acid sites and FexOy nanoparticles, which con-
tribute to the deep oxidation of propane to COx.
Besides the desired product propylene and main by-products
COx, traces of other by-products can be detected from the ODHP
with N2O, as shown in Fig. 4. Aromatics (MB, DMB and EB), allyl
alcohol and acrolein are detected over Fe-ZSM-5-G, while aromat-
ics (MB, DMB and EB) and acrolein are found over Fe-ZSM-5-E. The
aromatics should originate from an aromatization reaction, and

they will probably contribute to coke formation on the catalyst.
Allyl alcohol and acrolein should originate from the further oxida-
tion of the reaction product propylene [34,35].
The proﬁles of O2-TPD from Fe-ZSM-5-G and Fe-ZSM-5-E previ-
ously oxidized with O2 or with N2O are shown in Fig. 5. Although
the proﬁles provide us with a very complicated and even distorted
picture due to the secondary transformation of adsorbed oxygen
species, some very important issues can be explored. For Fe-ZSM-
5-E, multiple desorption peaks are observed in the 700–1050 K
temperature range from the sample oxidized in O2 (O/Fe = 0.09),
while the sample reoxidized in N2O produces desorption peaks in
a wider temperature range (550–1150 K, O/Fe = 0.11). These
results are consistent with those reported by Kunimori et al. [36],
and the O2 desorption peak below 700 K obtained after contact
with N2O might be related to the highly reactive so-called
a-oxygen species [37]. For Fe-ZSM-5-G oxidized in O2, desorption
peaks are observed in the 750–1050 K temperature range as well
(O/Fe = 0.10), similar to those on Fe-ZSM-5-E. Surprisingly, the O2
signals obtained after reoxidation of this sample in N2O are very
weak: O/Fe was just 0.035. The oxygen species adsorbed by the fer-
rous sites in Fe-ZSM-5-G upon interaction with N2O should be con-
sumed in the reoxidation of iron sites, but apparently it transforms
to an oxygen species with surprising stability.
To further examine this phenomenon, DRIFT spectra of NO
adsorbed on Fe-ZSM-5-G after reoxidation by N2O and another
auto-reduction treatment (N2O treatment at 773 K for 1 h followed
by He treatment at 773 K for 1 h) were measured, and the results
are given in Fig. S8. Again the signal at 1875 cm1 corresponding
to mono-nitrosyls on Fe2+–O–Al species is dominant, similar to
those observed for Fe-ZSM-5-G with simple auto-reduction treat-
ment (Fig. 1). However, the relative intensity of signal, reﬂected
by the signal/noise ratio, is much lower, indicating that a large pro-
portion of the iron species oxidized by nitrous oxide could not be
reduced through treatment in He at 773 K, consistent with the
TPD result. Obviously, the newly formed oxygen species could sur-
vive the high temperature auto-reduction process to a large extent.
Based on literature reports, two types of oxygen species have
been identiﬁed for nitrous oxide activation over iron-zeolite:
highly active a-O and thermally stable mono-oxygen [5,38]. In

the present study, the oxygen species deposited on the iron sites in
Fe-ZSM-5-G should be thermally stable mono-oxygen based on
their origin and properties [37,39]. However, the oxygen species
are somewhat different to those reported in literature [5,38]. On
the one side, they are stable and can survive the high temperature
treatment to a large extent, probably due to the reduced mobility
of oxygen species on highly isolated iron sites. On the other side,
they are reactive towards propane and can lead to oxidative dehy-

The evolution of IR bands observed on Fe-ZSM-5-G under reac-
tion conditions of ODHP with N2O is shown in Fig. 6. At low tem-
perature of 473 K, where the ODHP reaction does not yet
proceed, a series of IR bands in the region of 4000–1000 cm1
can be observed. Typically, the bands at 3495, 3465, 2580, 2550,
2235, 2205, 1305 and 1270 cm1 should be attributed to gas-phase
nitrous oxide [40]. The multiple bands at 2970 cm1 (2970, 2930
and 2875 cm1) are due to C–H stretching vibrations of –CHx spe-
cies while the band at 1470 cm1 is due to the bending vibration of
–CHx species [40,41]. At high temperature of 748 K, where propyl-
ene is produced at a signiﬁcant rate, all of the above-mentioned IR
bands can be observed as well. In addition, a weak negative band at
3740 cm1, a strong broad band centered at 3450 cm1 and a band
at 1605 cm1appear. The band at 3740 cm1 is due to the O–H
stretching vibration of Si–OH [42]. Its negative intensity suggests
that Si–OH groups are interacting with adsorbates, which in turn
results in the appearance of a broad band of interacting OH groups
centered at 3450 cm1. The band at 1605 cm1 could be due to the
C–O stretching vibration of bicarbonate anions [43].
To obtain further information on the reaction process of ODHP
with N2O, activation and conversion of nitrous oxide and propane
on Fe-ZSM-5-G at 748 K are examined individually by means of
in situ DRIFT spectroscopy, as shown in Fig. 7. During N2O adsorp-
tion on Fe-ZSM-5-G at 748 K only the signals of gas-phase N2O

(at 3495, 3465, 2580, 2550, 2235, 2205, 1305, and 1270 cm1) can
be detected During subsequent propane purging, the signals of gas-
phase N2O disappear and new bands originated from the activation
of propane, i.e. R–CHx and bicarbonates, appear. Initial propane
adsorption on Fe-ZSM-5-G leads to the formation of R–CHx (IR
bands at 2970 and 1470 cm1) and bicarbonates (IR band at
1605 cm1), accompanied by the consumption of Si–OH (IR band
at 3740 cm1). Subsequent purging by N2O results in the disap-
pearance of all these species and gas-phase N2O can be observed
instead.
Based on these results, it is easily concluded that propane can
adsorb on Fe-ZSM-5-G in the form of R–CHx, which can be further
oxidized to bicarbonates at 748 K. During this process, the ferric
ions could be reduced to ferrous ions. At low temperature of
473 K, propane can also adsorb on Fe-ZSM-5-G in the form of R–
CHx while it could not reduce ferric ions to ferrous ions (Fig. S9).
3.4. Steady-state reaction results
Due to its superior performance in TPSR (Fig. 3), the discussion
will be focused on Fe-ZSM-5-G in this section. The time-on-stream
behavior of Fe-ZSM-5-G in ODHP with N2O at different tempera-
tures is shown in Fig. 8. It is clearly seen that Fe-ZSM-5-G suffers
from severe deactivation during ODHP: propane conversion rate
falls gradually from the very beginning of the reaction, consistent
with literature reports [4,5,8]. In the 698–773 K temperature
range, higher propane conversion is obtained at higher reaction
temperature after 100 min time-on-stream. Meanwhile, the pro-
pylene selectivity ﬁrst increases with time-on-stream and then
reaches steady states. Higher propylene selectivity is ob served at
lower reaction temperature. As a balance of propane conversion
and propylene selectivity, the propylene yield ﬁrst increases to a
maximal value and then begins to drop with time-on-stream.
The time-on-stream behavior of Fe-ZSM-5-G in ODHP with N2O
at different N2O/C3H8 ratios is shown for 748 K in Fig. 9. Higher ini-
tial propane conversion rate is obtained at higher N2O/C3H8 ratio.
At the same time, however, higher N2O/C3H8 ratio results in more
severe deactivation. It is interesting to note that the propane con-
version rates with N2O/C3H8 ratio of 1:2 (propane conversion:
14.1%) and 2:3 (propane conversion: 16.9%) are very stable and
no deactivation can be observed within 400 min time-on-stream.
In addition, higher propene selectivity is obtained at lower N2O/
C3H8 ratios. Typically, volcanic type curves are observed with
N2O/C3H8 ratio of 1:1, 3:2 and 2:1. In contrast, stable propylene
selectivity is obtained with N2O/C3H8 ratio of 1:2 and 2:3. As a
whole, a maximal propylene production rate of ca. 6 mmol gcat
1 h1
can be obtained on Fe-ZSM-5-G at 748 K with a N2O/C3H8 ratio of
1:2, and this value can be kept unchanged for as long as 400 min.
We further tested the deactivation and regeneration of Fe-ZSM-
5-G under optimized reaction conditions, i.e. at a temperature of
748 K and with N2O/C3H8 ratio of 1:2. As shown in Fig. 10, superior
stable propane conversion rate of ca. 13 mmol gcat
1 h1 and propyl-
ene production rate of ca. 6 mmol gcat
1 h1 can be kept for over 40 h.
Afterwards, both the propane conversion rate and the propylene
production rate begin to drop slightly. A loss of 60% propylene
production rate is observed at 64 h time-on-stream. After regener-
ation in 7.5% N2O/He at 973 K for 3 h, the catalytic activity of
Fe-ZSM-5-G in ODHP with N2O can recover to the initial level.
The regenerated catalyst exhibits similar deactivation behavior as
the fresh catalyst, indicating that the Fe-ZSM-5-G catalyst can be
continuously regenerated for ODHP with N2O. To the best of our
knowledge, Fe-ZSM-5-G exhibits the highest up-to-date stability
in ODHP with N2O under comparable reaction conditions. Since
the deactivation is the most important issue for ODHP, it is reason-
able to believe that Fe-ZSM-5-G is good candidate for further
research.
3.5. Nature of coke deposited on catalysts
The total amounts of organic species formed on Fe-ZSM-5-G in
ODHP with N2O were analyzed by TG in the temperature range
from 323 to 1273 K. More organic species are deposited on the
Fe-ZSM-5-G sample at higher N2O/C3H8 ratios (Fig. 11). In the
temperature range from 400 to 900 K, the weight losses for
Fe-ZSM-5-G
are
5.9
wt.%
(N2O/C3H8 = 1:2),
7.4
wt.%
(N2O/
C3H8 = 2:3), 9.6 wt.% (N2O/C3H8 = 1:1), 10.7 wt.% (N2O/C3H8 = 3:2)
and 11.8 wt.% (N2O/C3H8 = 2:1), respectively. Considering that
more propane is fed to Fe-ZSM-5-G during the 400 min time-
on-stream at lower N2O/C3H8 ratio, the rate of ‘‘coke’’ accumula-
tion is distinctly lower with lower N2O/C3H8 ratio. As it is well

known that coke formation will cause catalyst deactivation in
ODHP, the best catalytic stability and the longest lifetime are
expected to be obtained with a N2O/C3H8 ratio of 1:2.
The exact constitution of the bulky organic deposits occluded in
the channels of the spent catalyst samples after 400 min time-on-
stream has been analyzed by GC–MS after dissolution of catalyst
framework and extraction of the organics [44,45]. The peak assign-
ments are made by comparing the related mass spectra with the
NIST database [46]. As shown in Fig. 12, mostly alkylbenzene
species are formed during ODHP with N2O over Fe-ZSM-5-G, and
these species should come from the aromatization of reactant pro-
pane or product propylene [47]. The amount of alkylbenzene spe-
cies,
judged
from
their
relative
intensities,
increases
with
increasing N2O/C3H8 ratio, consistent with TG analysis results.
Moreover, the speciﬁc constitution of alkylbenzene species varies
with the N2O/C3H8 ratio. Toluene is formed at the N2O/C3H8 ratio
of 1:2, while xylene and ethylbenzene are formed at the N2O/
C3H8 ratio of 2:1. Obviously, the kinetic diameter of aromatics
occluded in the channels of Fe-ZSM-5-G increases with increasing
N2O/C3H8 ratio, i.e. from ca. 0.59 nm (toluene and p-xylene) to ca.
0.62 nm (ethylbenzene) and ca. 0.68 nm (o-xylene and m-xylene).
It is well known that toluene and p-xylene could diffuse through
the channels of MFI structure (0.51  0.57 nm), while o-xylene
and m-xylene could not [48,49]. Therefore, o-xylene and m-xylene
with large kinetic diameter have to be conﬁned within the inter-
section of the straight and sinusoidal channels, which results in
the blocking of channels and accelerates the accumulation of
organic species.

In the present study, highly isolated Fe–O-Al species are
detected as in Fe-ZSM-5-G, and, therefore, the Eley–Rideal mecha-
nism (R3) should be the dominating process for nitrous oxide
decomposition over Fe-ZSM-5-G. More speciﬁcally, the Fe3+–Fe2+
cycle operates and N2O decomposes to N2 and O2 continuously
(R4, R5, R6, R7).

For the ODHP with nitrous oxide, the circumstances are some-
what more complicated. The direct reaction between propane
and gaseous oxygen results in the formation of COx as main prod-
ucts [13,51], so propane should react with adsorbed oxygen species
to produce propylene with high selectivity. Indeed, when Fe-ZSM-
5-G was subjected to an oxidation pretreatment in nitrous oxide at
773 K, it exhibited higher initial propene selectivity than that with-
out such pretreatment, as shown in Fig. S10. The oxidation
pretreatment can eliminate the induction period of Fe-ZSM-5-G
in ODHP by the introduction of the thermally stable oxygen species

O, which conﬁrms the involvement of these species in the reac-
tion. Moreover, the formation of oxygen species, i.e. O, appears
to be relatively slow in the reaction. Considering that the chemi-
sorption of nitrous oxide on Fe-ZSM-5-G is a very fast step, the
oxidation of ferrous sites to ferric sites by deposited oxygen species
(R5) might be the rate determining step in the whole reaction
process.
However, it is very difﬁcult to judge how propane participates
in the reaction. The results from in situ DRIFT spectroscopy (Figs. 6
and 7) reveal that similar organic species are formed upon propane
activation on clean ferrous sites (Fe2+) and ferrous sites pre-treated
with nitrous oxide at 748 K (Fe3+–O) or under in situ reaction con-
ditions (C3H8–N2O co-feeding). Therefore, we propose that gaseous
propane directly reacts with adsorbed O via a simple Eley–Rideal
mechanism (R8), similar to the reaction between adsorbed O and
gaseous nitrous oxide.

The propylene product can further react with adsorbed oxygen
species to form COx (R9), most probably via allyl alcohol, acrolein
and bicarbonate as reaction intermediates (TPSR results in Fig. 4
and DRIFT spectra in Figs. 6 and 7).

4.2. Deactivation mechanism for ODHP with nitrous oxide
Catalyst deactivation is a vital issue in ODHP with N2O and it
has been proposed to be related with the formation of coke during
reaction. In the present study, the formation of organic species is
indeed observed and the color of catalyst samples gradually
changes from light yellow to dark gray with reaction progress.
TG analysis results (Fig. 10) reveal that the accumulation rate of
organic species (‘‘coke’’) is very much dependent on the relative
partial pressure of propane and nitrous oxide, i.e. the N2O/C3H8
ratio. Lower N2O/C3H8 ratios result in lower accumulation rates
of organic species and subsequent lower deactivation rates
(Fig. 8). Results from in situ DRIFT spectroscopy indicate that the
adsorbates present during ODHP with N2O are quite similar with
different N2O/C3H8 ratios (Fig. S11). In literature reports on ODHP
with N2O, reaction conditions of N2O/C3H8 = 1 [4–8,12] or N2O/
C3H8 > 1 [9,10] were employed. Notably, we ﬁnd that a very stable
propylene yield can be obtained with N2O/C3H8 ratio of <1 in the
present study. Generally, excess oxidant, i.e. nitrous oxide, is help-
ful to suppress the deposition of coke species on the surface of cat-
alyst and to increase the lifetime of catalyst. However, excess
nitrous oxide will decompose to oxygen and nitrogen at elevated
temperature, probably via another pathway since the formation
of Fe2+ might be slow. The decomposition product oxygen will
non-selectively oxidize propane to COx and then damage the pro-
pylene yield. The oxygen can also react with the desired product
propylene, which not only damages the propylene yield but also
accelerates the apparent deactivation of catalyst. Taking all these
factors into consideration, a low N2O/C3H8 ratio of <1 is believed
to be more suitable for our Fe-ZSM-5-G catalyst and under our
reaction conditions. Typically, extraordinary stability in ODHP with
nitrous oxide (40 h) is obtained over Fe-ZSM-5-G with a N2O/
C3H8 ratio of 1:2 (Fig. 10).
During the reaction of ODHP with nitrous oxide over Fe-ZSM-
5-G, traces of aromatics (MB, DMB and EB) can be detected in
the product outlet (Fig. 4). Results from GC–MS analysis of

occluded organic species in the spent catalyst conﬁrm the deposi-
tion of aromatics as main coke species during ODHP with nitrous
oxide. It is very interesting to note that the kinetic diameter of
organic species signiﬁcantly increases with the N2O/C3H8 ratio
(Fig. 12). Undoubtedly, the deposition of organic species with lar-
ger kinetic diameter on the catalyst will lead to more signiﬁcant
blocking of the channels, and therefore, accelerate the coking rate,
as conﬁrmed by the TG analysis results (Fig. 11). Herein, the forma-
tion of organic species with diameter larger than that of MFI chan-
nels, e.g. o-xylene and m-xylene, should be a key point for the
deactivation. After 400 min time-on-stream, signiﬁcant catalyst
deactivation is observed with N2O/C3H8 ratios of 1:1, 3:2 and 2:1,
wherein o-xylene and m-xylene could be detected as occluded
organic species in the channels of Fe-ZSM-5-G. In contrast, no sig-
niﬁcant catalyst deactivation is ob served with N2O/C3H8 ratios of
2:3 and 1:2 after 400 min time-on-stream, wherein toluene and
p-xylene are detected as dominant occluded organic species. Only
in the deactivated state obtained after 72 h time-on-stream at a
N2O/C3H8 ratio of 1:2 (cf. Fig. 10), organic species with diameter
larger than the channels of MFI structure, i.e. o-xylene, m-xylene
and durene, were detected in the Fe-ZSM-5-G catalyst (Fig. S12).
5. Conclusions
In the present study, Fe-ZSM-5 is prepared via solid-state
exchange method using ferrocene as iron precursor and employed
as a model catalyst to investigate the reaction and deactivation
mechanism of the ODHP with nitrous oxide. The iron species are
well characterized by a series of techniques, and highly isolated
Fe–O–Al species, accounting for ca. 60% of the total iron species,
were detected in Fe-ZSM-5 after calcination at 1073 K. The reaction
mechanism of the ODHP with nitrous oxide over this Fe-ZSM-5
model catalyst is investigated by means of temperature-pro-
grammed experiments and in situ DRIFT spectroscopy. The reac-
tion between adsorbed oxygen species and gaseous propane is
the key step leading to propylene production, and the simpliﬁed
reaction pathway is proposed as follows.
Fe2þ þ N2O ! N2 þ Fe2þ  O
Fe2þ  O ! Fe3þ  O
Fe3þ  O þ C3H8 ! Fe2þ þ C3H6 þ H2O
The oxygen species O resulting from the reoxidation of
Fe2+–O–Al sites with N2O is surprisingly stable and highly
selective.
The deposition of organic species in Fe-ZSM-5 catalyst during
the ODHP with nitrous oxide is conﬁrmed by TG analysis and the
dominant organic species are determined to be alkylbenzenes by
GC–MS analysis. For the ﬁrst time, it is found that the accumula-
tion rate and the speciﬁc constitution of alkylbenzene species are
very much dependent on the N2O/C3H8 ratio, which subsequently
inﬂuences the deactivation behavior of Fe-ZSM-5 catalyst in the
ODHP with nitrous oxide. Under our reaction conditions, lower
N2O/C3H8 ratio is advantageous to get longer catalyst lifetime.
The formation of alkylbenzenes with diameter larger than the
channels of MFI structure, e.g. o-xylene and m-xylene, is observed
as the direct reason for the catalytic deactivation.
