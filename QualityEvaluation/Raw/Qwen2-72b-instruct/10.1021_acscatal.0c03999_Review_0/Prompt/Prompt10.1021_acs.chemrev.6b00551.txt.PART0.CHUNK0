Chemical ReviewsVol 117/Issue 5Article Cite Share Jump to Expand REVIEWFebruary 2, 2017 Halogen-Mediated Conversion of Hydrocarbons to Commodities Ronghe LinAmol P. AmruteJavier Prez-Ramrez* View Author Information View Author Information Open PDF Abstract Halogen chemistry plays a central role in the industrial manufacture of various important chemicals, pharmaceuticals, and polymers. It involves the reaction of halogens or halides with hydrocarbons, leading to intermediate compounds which are readily converted to valuable commodities. These transformations, predominantly mediated by heterogeneous catalysts, have long been successfully applied in the production of polymers. Recent discoveries of abundant conventional and unconventional natural gas reserves have revitalized strong interest in these processes as the most cost-effective gas-to-liquid technologies. This review provides an in-depth analysis of the fundamental understanding and applied relevance of halogen chemistry in polymer industries (polyvinyl chloride, polyurethanes, and polycarbonates) and in the activation of light hydrocarbons. The reactions of particular interest include halogenation and oxyhalogenation of alkanes and alkenes, dehydrogenation of alkanes, conversion of alkyl halides, and oxidation of hydrogen halides, with emphasis on the catalyst, reactor, and process design. Perspectives on the challenges and directions for future development in this exciting field are provided.

1.1 Relevance of Halogen Chemistry
Sustainable developments for building modern society rely on the availability of raw materials and the technologies for the efficient utilization of the latter for energy and chemical production. With time, there is a clear shift in both energy resources and feedstocks for chemical industry, from coal at the beginning of the 20th century to oil in the mid-20th century, and since the 1980s, natural gas is becoming a more important resource, while oil is dropping (Figure 1). (1-3) These transitions are primarily driven by the steadily rising demands, the industrial revolution, and the access to a particular resource in that time frame. The recent discovery of huge volumes of unconventional natural gas (4) is particularly worth mentioning as it is changing the picture of our basic raw materials, and it is projected that around 2035 all the three resources will contribute equally as feedstocks. (1) This scenario at first glance seems to make us less dependent on oil; however, the conversion of natural gas to valuable products is challenging due to inertness of its predominant constituent, methane. Halogen chemistry has played and is expected to play a prominent role in enabling the transformation of these different resources to commodities. The use of chlorine for the manufacture of a wide range of products, as summarized in the chlorine tree, is exemplary (Figure 2). (5) It is estimated that over 50% of all the industrial chemicals and polymers, (6) 20% of pharmaceutical small molecule drugs, and ca. 30% of all the active compounds in agrochemistry (7) depend on chlorine chemistry. Consequently, the production of this key building block of modern chemical industry has witnessed a strong growth from 18 Mton in 1965 to 75 Mton in recent times. (8, 9) The major application of chlorine is associated with the polymer industry [polyvinyl chloride (PVC), polyurethanes (PU), and polycarbonates (PC)], which accounts for 57% of the overall Cl2 demand worldwide (Figure 3). (10) Bromine is the second most widely used halogen (0.8 Mton per annum), being largely applied in the manufacture of flame retardants and drilling fluids. (11) The demands for both fluorine and iodine are less than 0.03 Mton per annum. Fluorine is predominantly consumed in the manufacture of UF6 and SF6, (12) while iodine is extensively employed in pharmaceuticals, as a contrast agent in medical imaging, and as catalysts. (13) The differences in the applications of each halogen, as also reflected in their global demands, can be partly attributed to their different chemical properties.

Halogen chemistry, in a broad sense, encompasses the reaction of halogens or halides with a substrate leading to intermediate compounds that are readily converted to commodities. The reactivity of halogens in these transformations is largely determined by the valence electrons in the outermost electron shell. Belonging to the same group in the periodic table, the general electronic configuration of halogens can be presented as ns2np5. The potential to hold one more electron in a p orbital makes them strong oxidizers, the reactivity of which weakening in the order of F > Cl > Br > I, with the increasing bond length between XX (X represents a halogen atom). Thanks to this key aspect of halogens, the electron affinity for the hydrogen atom is pronounced, (14) rendering them ideal mediators in the functionalization of various hydrocarbon molecules. The term mediator is exclusively used hereafter for halogen or halogen-containing compounds employed in hydrocarbon functionalization as they can be recovered after reaction and reused. The section below provides a chronological overview on the catalyst and process developments in halogen chemistry.
1.2 Chronology of Halogen-Mediated Processes
The halogen-mediated routes are not new, and since the discovery of halogens in the late 18th and early 19th centuries, they are constantly employed in industrial manufacturing. Thus, it is interesting to examine the key milestones leading to a foundational basis for the current research activities in the field of hydrocarbon upgrading. The chronological developments of halogen-related discoveries and large-scale manufacturing technologies are summarized in the timeline presented in Figure 4. Chlorine represents the first halogen discovered in the lab by Carl Wilhelm Scheele in 1774 by heating pyrolusite (MnO2-based mineral) with HCl. (15) However, its industrial production was realized a century after when Henry Deacon and Ferdinand Hunter discovered a catalytic process in the 1870s for HCl oxidation to Cl2, (16) which was superseded by the electrochemical route in 1920s. (17, 18) The latter was in fact discovered by William Cruickshank as early as 1800 but implemented only with the development of suitable generators by Siemens and by Acheson and Castner in 1892. The manufacture of iodine, the second discovered halogen, followed a decade after its identification in 1811 by Bernard Courtois, (19) while those of bromine (1826, Carl Jacob Lwig and Antoine Jrme Balard) (20) and fluorine (1886, Henri Moissan) (21) took more than five decades after their discoveries (Figure 4). The Leblanc process, named after the French chemist Nicolas Leblanc, was developed in 1791 that represents the first halogen-aided industrial process utilizing sodium chloride to produce sodium sulfate. (22) However, the pivotal role of halogens in the chemical industry was realized with the commercialization of chlorine production processes, which lays a solid foundation for the extensive exploration for their applications. This is especially exemplified in the development of several polymer industries that are heavily relying on chlorine.

Events associated with fluorine, chlorine, bromine, and iodine are represented by blue, green, brown, and purple lines, respectively. Black lines display processes involving interhalogen compounds (i.e., BrCl or ICl).
As one of the oldest synthetic materials, PVC was accidentally discovered from the exposure of vinyl chloride monomer (VCM) to light by Henri Victor in 1838. (23) However, its importance was not noted until 1912 when Fritz Klatte found the basis for the synthesis of VCM by the hydrochlorination of acetylene in the presence of a metal chloride catalyst. (24) Since then, increasingly recognized applications of PVC have been found following the commercialization of the technology in the 1930s. (25) With the huge boost of petrochemical industry in the 1950s, cheap ethylene became available. Consequently, the pure acetylene-based route for PVC production was gradually shifted to the balanced ethylene-acetylene process, and later to the modern balanced process relying fully on ethylene since the mid-1960s. (26) The desire of capitalizing on even low-cost natural gas resource stimulated great interest in the one-step VCM synthesis via ethane oxychlorination after the late 1960s, (27, 28) which ultimately culminated with a pilot project in Germany by EVC (now INEOS) in 1999. (29) In the meantime, PU and PC have been commercially manufactured by Bayer using phosgene chemistry around the mid-1950s. (30, 31) On the other hand, halogen-mediated functionalization of hydrocarbons to chemicals and fuels has a long history. The first gas-phase halogenation, more precisely chlorination, of an alkane dates back more than 150 years. Jean-Baptiste Dumas first synthesized tetrachloromethane by the chlorination of marsh gas (consisting predominantly of methane) in 1840 and is often credited for the discovery of the gas-phase halogenation of alkanes. (32-34) Berthelot isolated methyl chloride from the above process in 1858, (32) which can be readily hydrolyzed to methanol and thus providing an opportunity to utilize methane as a feedstock for chemicals and fuels. Accordingly, companies such as Roessler & Hasslacher and Hoechst patented the process. (35, 36) A commercial facility for methane chlorination was first started by Farbwerke Hoechst in 1923. (32, 36) However, the contemporary development of high-pressure methanol synthesis from syngas diverted the focus of methane activation from gas-phase chlorination. (37) The basic difficulty associated with direct gas-phase chlorination is the underutilization of chlorine, where 50% of the Cl2 used is reduced as an HCl byproduct which did not have a stable market by then. (38) This stimulated a search for new chemistry and in the late 1920s resulted in the demonstration of a reaction (later known as oxychlorination) of hydrocarbons with HCl and O2 in the presence of heterogeneous catalysts based principally on copper and iron chlorides, (39, 40) which allowed chlorine use with 100% atom efficiency. These processes however were associated with methane combustion and incomplete hydrogen chloride conversion. (38) This is substantiated by performing the process in two steps: (i) chlorination of hydrocarbons by copper chloride, employed as the chlorinating agent, and (ii) regeneration of the reduced copper chloride by reacting with HCl and O2 or air. (38, 41, 42) Although the process was claimed to be very effective for selective halogenation of hydrocarbons, the commercialization was not reached.
Interest in the single-stage halogenation and oxyhalogenation continued owing to the simplicity of operation. (38, 43) Since the 1960s, several new concepts and processes have emerged, including halogen-mediated alkane dehydrogenation, (44-46) halogenation of alkanes by interhalogen compounds, (47-49) zeolite-catalyzed coupling of methyl halides (CH3X) to higher hydrocarbons, (50, 51) high-temperature pyrolysis of methyl halides to chemicals, (52) superacid-aided selective alkane halogenation, (53, 54) FeBr3-based methane-to-methanol, (55) and integrated bromine-mediated light alkane transformation to chemicals and fuels. (56, 57) Catalyzed oxybromination of light alkanes regained much research interest in recent years. (58-62) Among these, only the bromine-aided upgrading process was demonstrated at a pilot scale. (63, 64) It should be emphasized that the implementation of a halogen-mediated process relies on a number of factors, such as the availability and efficiency of utilization of feedstocks, halogen recycling technologies, management of corrosion issues, etc. The renaissance in this well-known area could be ascribed to the recent developments in the above-mentioned field.
1.3 Scope of the Review
Since halogen-mediated routes are very relevant in the industrial manufacture of an array of valuable products and offer exceptional potential to capitalize on emerging vast natural gas reserves, we aim to provide the reader with a complete overview of the catalytic processes and reaction chemistry developed so far, with possible directions for future development. First, we will introduce the progress made in commercial polymer (PVC, PU, and PC) manufacture technologies through halogen chemistry, considering catalysts, reactors, and process aspects. The focus will be placed on understanding the structurefunction relationships and the stability aspects of the catalysts. Next, we will discuss the halogen-mediated functionalization of light alkanes, covering direct halogenation, oxyhalogenation, and halogen-assisted dehydrogenation with related catalysts, mechanisms, and processes. The catalytic chlorine and bromine recycling technologies, which are highly relevant in the polymer manufacture and natural gas valorization, will also be discussed in sections 2 and 3, respectively. Finally, we will examine the advances in the transformation of alkyl halides (i.e., functionalized alkanes in the previous step) to commodities with emphasis on differences and parallels with respect to methanol-to-hydrocarbons (MTH), catalysts, and mechanisms. We will also devote a subsection to the hazards and safe handling of halogen-containing compounds. To the best of our knowledge, no such comprehensive review of the topic has emerged during the last two decades. These processes have been only briefly alluded to in previous reviews focusing on methane activation. For example, Egloff et al. wrote a review in 1931 on processes for the halogenation of hydrocarbons. (65) A review article by Treger et al. published in 1988 targeted the oxidative chlorination of aliphatic hydrocarbons (C1C3) on copper chloride-based catalysts, covering thermodynamics, kinetics, catalysts, and briefly the reactors. (66) A recent review of Over in 2012, concentrating on surface chemistry of RuO2 in heterogeneous catalysis and electrocatalysis, has a concise section on HCl oxidation. (67) Olsbye et al. in 2012 reviewed the MTH process emphasizing zeolites topology on product selectivity, with brief attention to methyl halides conversion. (68) Other two reviews by Guo et al. (2014), (69) and Horn and Schlgl (2015) (70) on selective oxidation catalysis for alkanes, CO, and alcohols conversions and catalytic methane activation, respectively, discussed the concept of halogen-mediated activation with limited details. A more recent perspective article by Gascon et al. (2016) analyzed the mechanistic aspects of direct methane activation with emphasis on both the CH bond cleavage and oxidant activation on heterogeneous catalysts, with only a short discussion on the halogenation route. (71) 2 Halogen Chemistry in Polymer Manufacture Synthetic polymers came into prominence in the early 20th century, and nowadays they are playing important roles in almost every aspect of our modern life. Halogen chemistry is crucial in the manufacture of different polymers, such as PVC, polytetrafluoroethylene, PU, and PC. PVC is a representative example where chlorine is consumed and ends up in the product. Among plastics, PVC ranks number three in terms of global production after polyethylene and polypropylene. (72) Owing to its excellent properties such as being lightweight and chemical resistance, PVC is widely used in construction, piping, and many other industries. Thanks to its versatility, the PVC demand reached 43.6 Mton in 2015 (Figure 5) and is expected to grow with an annual rate of 3.2% in the future. (73) PU and PC are the most representative chlorine-free end materials obtained using chlorine chemistry. They possess unique characteristics, such as good tensile strength and high impact-resistance, making them useful in fast-growing sectors like construction, transportation, electronics, etc. and, thus, leading to fast annual growth rates (6.3% for PU and 6.2% for PC) than that of PVC. (72, 74, 75) Figure 5 Figure 5. Annual global demand of PVC, PU, and PC with projections (dashed line) up to 2020. Data taken from refs 72, 74, and 75.
The synthesis of PVC is achieved by the polymerization of VCM, a chemical intermediate manufactured predominantly for the purpose of PVC. Processes and chemistry for the production of VCM vary according to the feedstocks and catalysts (Figure 6). An industrial VCM production originally started in the 1920s through acetylene hydrochlorination over mercuric chloride catalysts, (76) which is still used in countries, such as China, where acetylene can be obtained cost-effectively from abundant coal. However, the increasing demand of PVC and rising prices of acetylene coupled to the toxicity of mercury-based catalysts prompted a shift of feedstock in the 1950s to more economic ethylene from petroleum in Europe and the U.S. (77) This resulted in the development of a new alternative route for VCM manufacture, entailing ethylene chlorination to ethylene dichloride (EDC) followed by the thermal cracking of EDC to VCM. Acetylene was still used to make the chlorine balance by recycling HCl from the cracking step to the hydrochlorination unit. The first breakthrough in VCM manufacture was achieved with the establishment of the modern balanced process (Figure 6, dashed box), which includes ethylene chlorination and oxychlorination. The latter process involves the reaction of ethylene with O2 and the HCl byproduct of the cracking step to produce EDC and thus close the chlorine loop in VCM manufacture from ethylene. Today, more than 90% of the vinyl chloride produced in the western world is exclusively based on the ethylene route encompassing the balanced process. With the incentive of further economizing the PVC production, industry has undertaken considerable effort to replace ethylene by ethane as the key feedstock and to obtain VCM by oxychlorination of ethane in one step and thus to bypass the EDC cracking step. (27, 78) Figure 6 Figure 6. Production of vinyl chloride from acetylene, ethylene, and ethane via hydrochlorination, chlorination, or oxychlorination.
The current production of PU and PC is based on the use of phosgene. PU was originally synthesized from aliphatic diisocyanate and diamine forming polyuria, until interesting properties of PU obtained from diisocyanate and glycol were discovered. The commercial scale production of PU however was realized using toluene diisocyanate (TDI) and polyester polyols, where the precursor TDI is obtained by the reaction of toluene diamine and phosgene. (31) The original method to prepare PC was based on the transesterification of bisphenol A monomer with diphenyl carbonate. (79) This process was later surpassed by the polymerization of bisphenol A with phosgene, a modernized route for the manufacture of PC.
In pursuit of the way from acetylene to ethane as a feedstock for PVC and establishment of PU and PC manufacturing technologies, several improvements in terms of process chemistries, catalysts, and reactors have been achieved. These aspects are tackled herein chronologically first for PVC followed by PU and PC business, with special attention paid to the catalyst developments in each case. The chlorine recycling technologies, which are key in PU and PC manufactures, based on catalytic oxidation of hydrogen chloride to molecular chlorine, are also discussed.
2.1 Acetylene Hydrochlorination for VCM Production
The acetylene hydrochlorination process based on mercuric chloride catalysts still holds importance in the developing countries having abundant coal but a shortage of oil and gas (e.g., China), where 80% of VCM is produced from acetylene. (80) The low-cost and good activity of the catalyst make this process still attractive. However, the toxicity of mercury and stringent government policies for the use of such materials triggered scientists to hunt for alternative catalytic technologies, which resulted in the identification of interesting catalyst families based on gold, ruthenium, bismuth, copper, and carbon-based materials. (81-85) These developments are recently reviewed by Hutchings et al., (86) presenting a comprehensive overview on the gold-based catalysts, and Dai et al., (87) discussing the development of nonmercury catalysts. Therefore, key aspects, such as catalyst design criteria, synthesis, mechanism, deactivation, and pilot evaluations of important systems are discussed in the following sections.
2.1.1 Mercuric Chloride-Based Catalysts
The current acetylene-based industrial process for the manufacture of VCM is catalyzed by activated carbon (AC) supported mercuric chloride, typically operated at 373433 K and 12 bar. (88) The preparation of the catalysts includes impregnation of the support with an aqueous solution of metal precursor to obtain a high HgCl2 loading of 1015 wt %. (87) The choice of high surface area AC carrier was based on the following characteristics: (i) its robustness under the harsh conditions of hydrochlorination, (ii) the attainment of high dispersion of active components, and (iii) the plausible strong metalsupport interaction leading to enhanced catalyst stability. (89) The mechanism of acetylene hydrochlorination over HgCl2/AC based on kinetic studies remains controversial. (90-94) Wesselhoft et al. proposed that a LangmuirHinshelwood (LH) rate expression gave the best fit of the experimental results from a differential reactor, assuming that acetylene and HCl were adsorbed at different sites and the formation of VCM from the two adsorbed molecules was the rate-determining step. (90) Bremer and Lieske argued that the previous kinetic models cannot explain well their results from a differential circulation flow reactor. They concluded an EleyRideal (ER) mechanism with a more complicated model, including at least two parallel partial reactions on the presumed active sites of HgCl2, HgCl2·HCl, and HgCl2·2HCl. (93) Agnew and co-workers assessed the steady-state and transient kinetic data from continuous stirred-tank reactor in a wide temperature range of 348513 K. (91, 94) They found that while the low-temperature results fitted well with the previous kinetic models, there is an abrupt change of slope at ca. 413 K for the Arrhenius plot in both studies. These deviations cannot be ascribed to catalyst deactivation encountered at elevated temperature as the authors claimed the decay has been corrected. (94) Comparing the parameter values of an LH model at different temperatures reveals significant decrease in the equilibrium constant of acetylene adsorption above 453 K. This indicates the acetylene surface coverage becomes much lower at high temperatures. Therefore, the reaction appears to proceed by collision between the adsorbed HCl, and the gas-phase acetylene (i.e., E-R mechanism) prevails in this case.
Albeit industrially used for several decades, the HgCl2-catalyzed hydrochlorination reaction suffers from a number of major drawbacks, including the pulverization of AC, catalyst deactivation due to the leaching of active components, and the toxicity of mercury. (86, 87) Besides, the reaction is highly exothermic. Insufficient heat removal can lead to hot spots of 140200 K in a commercial reactor, which causes the volatilization of HgCl2 and consequently the catalyst deactivation. (91) The statistics from China shows that the manufacture of 1 ton of PVC requires 1.021.41 kg of HgCl2 catalyst (1015 wt % HgCl2 loading), a quarter of which is not possible to recycle. (95) This issue, to some extent, can be alleviated with the usage of a low-mercury catalyst with different metal promoters and appropriate process engineering such as absorbing the lost mercury with AC. (80, 96) However, the potential harms of the heavy metal pollution and toxicity are not eliminated. Thus, developing nonmercury catalysts is the only way for a sustainable application of the acetylene route.
2.1.2 Gold-Based Catalysts
Discovery Screening of nonmercury catalysts and the identification of descriptors for a good hydrochlorination catalyst have been the major objectives in the early research activities since the 1960s. (97-100) Smith et al. studied the adsorption of acetylene and its hydrochlorination over silica-supported metal chlorides catalysts with divalent cations. (97) They observed bigger shifts of the adsorption bands of propyne CC and acetylene CH vibrations to lower frequencies with increasing electron affinity of the metal cations. The first correlation between the electron affinity and activity was reported by Shinoda based on the screening of 30 metal chlorides supported on AC (Figure 7a). (98) The data were fitted with two opposite trends: (i) increase of acetylene conversion with electron affinity and (ii) drop of acetylene conversion with electron affinity over metal chlorides of FriedelCrafts type catalysts. Thus, electron affinity seems to be not able to predict an appropriate catalyst formulation, which might be due to the mismatch of electrons between electron affinity (one-electron addition) and the hydrochlorination reaction (two-electron addition). Using this hint, Hutchings proposed a new correlation between the standard electrode potential of cations involving two-electron addition (e.g., M2+ + 2e  M and M3+ + 2e  M+) and the hydrochlorination activity (Figure 7b), (99) which suggests that the higher the standard electrode potential of a metal cation, the higher will be its hydrochlorination activity. Thus, gold with its highest standard electrode potential would lead to the highest hydrochlorination rate. This prediction was later experimentally proved to be viable (Figure 7c). However, considering the empirical nature of this correlation, the standard electrode potential should be used cautiously to predict a good acetylene hydrochlorination catalyst.

Reaction conditions: C2H2:HCl = 1:1.1, gas hourly space velocity (GHSV) = 1080 h1 and T = 453 K.
Hydrochlorination Mechanism The reaction mechanism over gold catalysts has been probed by replacing symmetric C2H2 molecules with longer-chain alkynes such as hex-1-yne and ethynylbenzene. (101) It was found that both reactions gave high selectivity to the Markovnikov products. The stereochemistry of acetylene hydrochlorination over Au/AC catalyst was further confirmed by density functional theory (DFT) calculations. (101) It is suggested that HCl adds in an anticonfiguration to the alkyne, following the Markovnikov rule. The size of gold clusters has been found to affect the position of the active sites, namely the active sites could be at the top (in the Au4,6,8,9 clusters) or bridge sites (in the Au3,5,7,10 clusters) depending on the number of gold atoms in the cluster. (102) In either case, the gold catalysts act as a bridge for electron transfer from the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) Aun-C2H2 complexes to the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) of HCl. It should be noted that these conclusions were derived from neutral gold clusters, while it was suggested that the most active catalysts contain gold cations. Hutchings et al. inferred that the redox pair of Au3+ and Au+ could be responsible for the activation of HCl and C2H2 molecules, respectively, which also explains the correlation between the catalyst activity and the standard electrode potential. (86) Deactivation and Regeneration Although AuCl3/AC showed the highest initial activity, the biggest drawback hindering its large-scale commercialization is the inadequate long-term stability at a minimal Au loading. This is generally caused by a combination of several factors. Among these, the reduction of Au3+ or Au+ to Au0 was suggested to be the main reason for the deactivation. (103) Another reason could be the aggregation of gold clusters, as it is well-known that the gold catalysis is closely associated with the particle size. Both the reduction of gold cations and the growth in particle size have been observed in the deactivated catalysts indeed. (104, 105) Hutchings et al. suggested that the size effect might not contribute significantly to the overall catalyst deactivation since the mean size only increased moderately while the surface Au3+ was almost totally reduced to metallic Au (Figure 8, panels a and b). (101) It could also be possible that metallic gold nanoparticles are more prone to aggregation. The deposition of carbonaceous residuals has been occasionally identified in the spent catalysts. (103, 106) Acetylene polymerization at strong acid sites generated by aqua regia treatment can lead to the formation of carbon-containing nanotubes. (107) As a consequence, the catalysts need to be regenerated so as to recover the activity. A treatment of the spent catalysts with aqua regia can reoxidize Au0 to Au3+ and fully restore the activity. (108) Recently, Yuan et al. reported a new method by using iodohydrocarbon as the medium for ex situ catalyst regeneration. (104) This treatment not only reoxidized Au0 but also led to the redispersion of the gold particles in a controllable way, both accounting for the restored activity in five consecutive runs. Alternatively, the regeneration can be attained during the process by introducing strong oxidants. For instance, coke residuals can be removed by flowing air, whereas Cl2, NO, and N2O can oxidize Au0 to Au+ and Au3+. (85) Figure 8 Figure 8.

Preparation The performance of gold-based catalysts has been shown to be greatly affected by the way they are prepared. It was found that the catalysts synthesized in water or dilute acid solvents were less active than those obtained using aqua regia, which enabled the ionic forms of gold species to be maintained during the impregnation step. (107) This finding clearly demonstrates the importance of stabilizing gold cations during the preparation. Ideally, the use of environmentally benign solvents such as water would be a better choice for the scale up purpose. This seemingly simple solution has been realized only recently, which includes the addition of different ligands containing soft donor atoms (cyanides, thiourea, thiosulfate, and thiocyanate, etc.) in the impregnation step. (109) The suitable ligands with high stability constants of the resulting Au complexes are shown to be beneficial for maintaining the higher oxidation states of gold during the hydrochlorination reaction. In addition, Wei et al. found that the electric potential was greatly reduced for these complexes, and they obviously disobeyed the correlation between activity and standard electrode potential discussed above. (105) This reduced electric potential would probably weaken the interaction with C2H2, thus preventing the reduction of Au cations. Furthermore, modification of carbon support has also been attempted to improve the catalytic performance. For instance, N-doping on both multiwalled carbon nanotubes and AC was proven to enhance the adsorption of HCl and stabilize Au cations. (110, 111) Incorporation of phosphorus groups (PO43 and PO3) on carbon can improve the dispersion of the active site and reduce coke deposition on the catalyst surface. (112) Pilot-Scale Demonstrations Several pilot trials have been conducted on these highly efficient catalytic entities. (86, 105, 113) A sulfur-containing gold catalyst (0.1 wt % Au) with 2 kg was loaded in a single tube reactor of 3000 × 50 mm (length × diameter). (86) The operation was run at the temperature range of 383403 K with a feed rate of 0.6 kg h1. Hotspots were observed with the highest temperature approaching 498 K, and the exothermic region migrated continuously down the catalyst bed with time-on-stream. The catalyst performed for ca. 18 months with stable acetylene conversion (>85%) and VCM selectivity (>99%) (Figure 8c). Another pilot trial with a 4 ton of VCM per annum scale was evaluated in a single tube fixed-bed reactor packed with 4.6 L of the thiocyanate-modified catalyst with 0.25 wt % gold loading. (105) After 3000 h evaluation, the acetylene conversion and VCM selectivity remained >95% and >99%, respectively, at a GHSV of 60 h1. Furthermore, it is found that the deactivation rate of the catalysts was relevant to the packed positions, which accelerated from the top to the bottom of the catalyst bed. This is in line with the gradual migration of hot spots along the reactor. Although no studies mentioned the loss of gold after such long-term stability test, results in a lab suggested that the leaching of gold was indistinguishable. (103) These exciting results therefore represent a giant step toward the commercialization of Au-based catalysts and will pave the way to revolutionize the current acetylene hydrochlorination process.
2.1.3 Bimetallic Catalysts
AuM Catalysts It is well-established in catalysis that the performance of a catalyst can be tuned by the addition of an auxiliary metal component, whether functioning as structural and/or electronic promoters. Bimetallic gold catalysts for acetylene hydrochlorination have been studied mainly to reduce the gold content and to enhance the structural stability. The first attempt to examine the effect of a series of AuM bimetallic catalysts (M = Pd, Pt, Ir, Ru, and Rh) was made by Hutchings et al. (114) Slightly higher activity was observed over AuIr and AuRh, while AuRu showed no apparent improvements, and a significant loss in the selectivity together with rapid deactivation were found over AuPd and AuPt. Therefore, they inferred that there is no synergistic effect in these bimetallic catalysts, and any improvement in the activity is possibly due to the increase in the dispersion of gold by the second metal. (86) These arguments are rooted in the previously discussed activity-standard electrode potential relationships, which predicted that the monometallic gold could be among the best candidate for the hydrochlorination reaction. A decrease of standard electrode potential will occur when the AuM bimetallic system is present in a homogeneous alloy form, thus leading to a poor activity. However, this is not always the case. Wei et al. demonstrated the presence of a synergy in AuBi/AC, which outperformed the monometallic Au/AC or Bi/AC catalysts and the mechanical mixture of the two. (95) They reported that the bimetallic catalyst with Bi:Au = 3 (0.3 wt % Au) can give a comparable activity to the 1 wt % Au counterpart [turnover frequency (TOF), ca. 3 s1] and a significantly improved stability. The promotional effect of bismuth was ascribed to its ability to stabilize Au+ by inhibiting the reduction to metallic Au. Besides, there is a large number of research devoted to the study of other non-noble metal promoters (Ba, Sr, Co, Cu, Sn, and Ce, etc.) for Au-based catalysts. (83, 113, 115-118) Although the synergistic effect is not clear in these systems, probably because of the use of a relatively high loading of gold (ca. 1 wt %), beneficial aspects in suppressing coke deposition and in stabilizing the cationic gold species were claimed, which ultimately enhanced the catalyst stability.
RuM Catalysts As expected from its low standard electrode potential (Figure 7c), the ruthenium-based catalysts are less active than Au/AC. (100) However, a significant increase in the hydrochlorination activity of Ru catalysts was achieved when they were doped with an additive. For instance, the addition of a small amount of K or Co to Ru/AC (1 wt %) increased the conversion of acetylene and reduced the coke formation. (119, 120) The enhanced performance was partly attributed to the increased RuO2 species in the catalyst. In contrast, Cu doping favored RuCl3 formation and, therefore, caused a decrease in the activity. (120) Nonetheless, Li et al. reported RuCu supported on carbon nanotubes with 400 ppm Ru as an efficient catalyst for the hydrochlorination reaction, the TOF of which was even higher than that of the HgCl2 catalyst. (121) The promotional phenomenon has not been well-assessed though, likely because of the low Ru content.
BiCu Catalysts Developing efficient non-noble metal catalysts for the hydrochlorination process is demanding. Wei et al. evaluated the performance of silica-supported BiCu catalysts in a fluidized-bed reactor. (122) An industrial trial of a 10 ton VCM per annum scale was conducted for 700 h with the replenishing of catalysts after 400 h. A stable performance in the first 200 h was observed under the conditions of 360 h1 and 473 K [X(C2H2)  80%, S(VCM) > 99%]. After that a continuous drop in activity was evidenced. The inferior stability of the catalysts can be ascribed to the severe leaching of bismuth (>85% Bi loss in 700 h).
2.1.4 Process Design Aspects
The catalytic acetylene hydrochlorination can be operated either in the gas- or liquid-phase, while the gas-phase reaction is preferred in industrial manufactures. A simplified flowsheet for the VCM production via the acetylene-based route is presented in Figure 9. (123) The gaseous reactants, with over stoichiometric HCl:C2H2, are well-mixed before being fed to the hydrochlorination reactor. Fixed-bed multitubular reactors are exclusively used and equipped with external cooling systems for reaction heat removal. The reaction effluent was separated in a distillation column, where the unreacted feed gases (C2H2 and HCl) as the light ends can be recycled. Crude VCM from the bottom of the column is directed into another tower for purification. The heavies from the bottom of the second column was stripped with the underflow of a washing tower and removed for further use or for incineration. With dependence on the catalyst performance, acetylene conversions of 95100% at almost quantitative yields can be achieved with an average space time yield (STY) of 7080 kg h1 m3 in fixed-bed reactor systems. (123) The hydrochlorination is known to be strongly exothermic with generation of hot spots above 100 K in fixed-bed reactors. (86, 91) Thus, the reaction heat management is critical to avoid temperature runaway and catalyst deactivation. Even though the fluidized-bed reactor technology can offer high heat transfer efficiency, it has rarely been employed. One possible reason could be that the carbon materials are by far the most suitable support for the best performing hydrochlorination catalysts, but they are easily prone to pulverization in the high velocity regime during fluidization.

2.2 Ethylene Chlorination for VCM Production
VCM can be prepared from ethylene through a two-step process involving ethylene chlorination to EDC, followed by the thermal cracking of EDC to VCM. The direct chlorination of ethylene is performed in the gasliquid or liquid phase where chlorine and pure ethylene are reacted in the presence of Lewis acid type catalysts, such as FeCl3. (124) The reaction follows a typical electrophilic addition mechanism, yielding a high purity EDC that, sometimes, can be immediately used for cracking. The most important byproduct is 1,1,2-trichlorethane, likely originating from the further chlorination of EDC. The reaction can be carried out at either low (323343 K) or high (363423 K) temperatures. In the low-temperature process, the reactor is a simple gasliquid contact column, operated at temperatures below the boiling point of EDC. The produced EDC is discharged continuously in the liquid phase. Heat removal can be managed by using either an internal heat transfer device such as a cooling coil or an external heat exchanger with recycling of cold EDC. This route possesses the advantage of low byproduct formation but requires more energy to recover the EDC. Another major drawback arises from the separation of the catalyst from the liquid EDC produced that inevitably increases the operation costs. In contrast, the high-temperature process, operated at the boiling point of EDC at 1.55 bar, utilizes the reaction heat for the distillation of EDC, leading to substantial energy savings. (125) The chlorination reactor may be integrated as a reboiler of a distillation column or designed as an independent equipment. Since the EDC leaves the reactor in the gas phase, there is no catalyst consumption, hence the catalyst refill is not required.
2.3 Ethylene Oxychlorination for VCM Production
The oxychlorination method, involving the reaction of ethylene with HCl and O2, comprises the key technology in the contemporary VCM manufactures to close the chlorine loop by consuming the HCl byproduct released from the EDC cracking step. The process is applied in parallel with chlorination, and they together are referred as a balanced process (Figure 6). The reaction is exclusively practiced in the gas phase over a heterogeneous catalyst at 473773 K and 15 bar. The oxychlorination reaction network is rather complex as numerous routes, such as substitution, addition, elimination, and oxidation, leading to a series of chlorinated and oxidized products, can take place (Figure 10). (126) Therefore, the product distribution is strongly dependent on the nature of catalyst and conditions. Industrial oxychlorination catalysts consist of CuCl2 supported on γ-Al2O3 and promoted with various dopants, which lead to excellently EDC yield (ca. 9099%) in the typical temperature range of 473733 K (Table 1). Albeit being used for several decades, the copper catalysts suffer from deactivation due to volatilization and/or agglomeration of active phase. Very few studies were attempted to find stable copper-free systems, advantageously leading to VCM formation. Herein, we first systematically review the copper chloride-based catalysts with emphasis on the reaction mechanism and the role of different dopants, taking into account recent findings acquired by advanced characterization techniques. A short discussion is then made on the emerging processes and catalysts for the dehydrochlorination of EDC to VCM. This is followed by examining the direct VCM production from ethylene over noncopper catalysts. The last section is dedicated to discuss the reactor technology and processes.
Figure 10 Figure 10. Multiple products of ethylene oxychlorination emphasize the key importance of the selectivity in the design of an optimal catalytic process. (126) The desired product, ethylene dichloride, can be irreversibly overchlorinated through addition, substitution, and elimination reactions leading to a wide range of chlorohydrocarbons. In addition, ethylene and the chlorinated compounds can be overoxidized to CO and CO2.

2.3.1 Copper Chloride-Based Catalysts for EDC Production
The copper-based catalysts are of predominant interest for both academia and industry in ethylene oxychlorination. The developments in this field will be assessed form the aspects of choice of support, reaction mechanism, side reactions, and the role of promoters.
Choice of Support The most commonly used support is γ-alumina, though in rare cases, other inert carriers such as α-alumina, silica, silica-magnesia, and natural pumice were also reported. (134-136) The unique role of γ-alumina can be generalized as follows. First, γ-alumina influences the reducibility and mobility of the copper chloride phase. Rouco found that a stronger salt-support interaction occurred in γ-alumina, compared with SiO2- and α-alumina-supported catalysts, and the mobility of copper chloride was only confirmed on γ-alumina rather than on the other two supports. (137) The author indicated the mobile copper species was cuprous chloride, but no further efforts were made to study the influence on the catalytic performance. Second, the formation of various copper species was at least partially influenced by the nature of alumina. Lamberti et al. have found that different copper species can be formed, namely, surface aluminate (isolated Cu2+ ions occupying octahedral vacancies on the alumina surface), amorphous CuCl2·2H2O, and insoluble copper hydroxychloride, depending on the copper content. (138, 139) Reaction Mechanism A molecular level understanding of the reaction mechanism, kinetics on solid surfaces, and the determination of structure-performance relationships hold fundamental importance in the rational development of any heterogeneously catalyzed process. Such knowledge is limited in the oxychlorination of ethylene. (140-144) In depth investigation of the chemistry has been hampered by the demanding experimental conditions involving corrosive, flammable, and toxic compounds, which make it extremely difficult to apply suitable techniques to tackle mechanistic investigations. There have been several speculations on the chemistry of an alkene oxychlorination reaction. Due to the similarity between HCl oxidation and oxychlorination reaction, a Deacon mechanism was conceived involving the formation of chlorine over catalyst surface and gas-phase alkene addition. (145) Disadvantageously, the hypothesis cannot well-explain the high EDC selectivity in view of radical reactions. A LH mechanism was proposed by Carruba and Spencer to explain their kinetic model. (145) They suggested that oxygen and ethylene were adsorbed on the surface sites and the formation of ethylene oxide was the rate-determining step. However, this proposal is not in line with the findings of Lamberti et al., who carried out a thorough study on the fresh, aged, as well as ethylene, oxygen, or HCl treated catalysts by using ex situ X-ray absorption spectroscopy. (138, 139, 143, 144, 146) They pointed out that the oxychlorination of ethylene is catalyzed by a highly dispersed CuCl2 phase following a three-step redox mechanism: (i) ethylene chlorination with CuCl2 which was reduced to CuCl, (ii) oxidation of CuCl to an oxychlorides (Cu2OCl2), and (iii) chlorination of oxychloride to regenerate CuCl2. Both cupric and cuprous chlorides have been experimentally confirmed by X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES), while the oxychloride was not detected which is explained by its fast chlorination (Figure 11a). The reoxidation of CuCl was shown to be the rate-determining step for the undoped CuCl2, which is further delayed in the presence of HCl. (144) In this mechanism, cupric chloride was supposed to act as the chlorinating agent rather than the molecular chlorine, which may reasonably explain the high selectivity to EDC. It should be noted that these conclusions are based on transient experiments (138, 139, 143, 146) or the temperature-programmed reactions. (144) Therefore, they allow a limited extrapolation to the industrial process for which steady-state mechanistic information is crucial. This highlights the need of developing novel experimental and theoretical approaches to unravel the oxychlorination chemistry.

The presence of two isosbestic points at 8984 and 8995 eV is direct proof for only two species being present on the catalyst in significant amounts: CuCl2 and CuCl in mutual transformation.

Side Reaction In ethylene oxychlorination, a series of side reactions can accompany, leading to the production of chlorocarbons and carbon oxides (Figure 10), thus inevitably decreasing EDC selectivity. On the basis of pulse reactor studies and in situ infrared spectroscopy (IR), Busca et al. demonstrated that the free alumina surface could play a negative role in ethylene oxychlorination, due to its ability to dehydrochlorinate EDC and other chloroalkanes. (147) Among others, VCM and 1,1,2-trichloroethane (TCE) were the predominant byproducts, which were suggested to originate from the dehydrochlorination and rechlorination of EDC, respectively. An early literature by Shalygin et al. reported that EDC dehydrochlorination to VCM occurred on the Lewis acid sites of the alumina surface. (148) This agrees with a recent report by Lamberti et al., who studied various promoted copper chloride catalysts supported on γ-alumina for ethylene oxychlorination, and found a positive trend between the density of Lewis acid sites and byproduct selectivity in the temperature range of 503573 K. (149) However, such correlation was not found for the density and strength of Brnsted acid sites. Muddada et al. (150) further proposed that TCE can be produced from VCM by interacting with cupric chloride sites through π-complexation and extracting two chloride ions from copper chloride, and VCM can be further halogenated to 1,1-dichloroethane by adsorbed HCl. These findings are consistent with the speculation of Feijen-Jeurissen et al. (151) based on the investigation of the destruction mechanism of C2-chlorinated hydrocarbons on alumina and alumina-supported chromium and palladium catalysts. As a relatively less-pronounced byproduct, ethyl chloride (EC) was believed to be produced by the direct addition of HCl to ethylene. (152) Carbon oxides were suggested to result from ethylene oxidation since the combustion of haloalkanes requires higher reaction temperatures. (153) Role of Promoter Pristine CuClx/γ-Al2O3 is rarely used in the oxychlorination reaction due to the poor stability of cupric chloride. (133, 144) The addition of promoters can reduce the metal loss and/or influence the activity and selectivity. (140, 154, 155) The most commonly applied dopants are alkali metals (Li, Na, and K), alkaline earth metals (Mg, Ca, and Cs), and rare earth metals (La and Ce). These metals can exert various effects on the physicochemical properties of the catalysts and improve the catalytic performance. A summary of the impacts of different promoters on the modification of alumina-supported copper chloride catalysts is presented in Table 2. KCl is the most widely used and studied additive, especially for the catalyst used in fixed-bed reactor technologies. The presence of KCl was reported to cause structural change in KCl-CuCl2/fumed silica and in KCl-CuCl2/Al2O3 catalyst. (144, 156) Probe molecule FTIR spectroscopy was applied as the suitable method to detect these subtle structural differences. For instance, a new mixed chloride phase KxCuCl2+x was found for the KCl-promoted CuCl2/Al2O3 catalyst when reduced in ethylene. This was suggested based on the blue shift of υ(CO) due to the formation of Cu+···CO adducts. (144) In another study, UVvis-NIR was used to identify the effect of KCl promotion. It was found that a significant fraction of Cu2+ was located at the strongly distorted octahedral sites induced by the modification of potassium. (140, 154, 155) Generally, addition of KCl led to a decrease of the overall activity, as evidenced by the pulse experiments, and a higher apparent activation energy for the doped catalyst. (137, 140, 154, 155) This might be related to the decreased reducibility of KxCuCl2+x, which eventually altered the rate-determining step of the reaction. The direct evidence comes from Fourier-transformed XANES spectroscopy, indicating that the doping with KCl favors the Cu2+ valence state of the catalyst (Figure 11 panels b and c). From the technological viewpoint, the copper catalyst in the Cu2+ valence state is beneficial for minimizing Cu loss from the volatilization of cuprous species, albeit a fully oxidized copper catalyst was suggested to be inactive for ethylene oxychlorination. (140, 154, 155) Additionally, KCl doping can greatly diminish Lewis acid sites of alumina, which is deemed to be responsible for the enhanced EDC selectivity. (149, 150) Table 2.

A systematic investigation of various effects of promoters on the alumina-supported copper chloride catalysts was carried out by Lamberti and co-workers. (149, 154, 155) Some major conclusions were summarized in Table 2 and drawn as follows: (i) Promoters competed with copper ions to occupy the octahedral vacancy sites of γ-Al2O3 in the order: K < Cs < Li  Mg < La. (154) (ii) Cu dispersion increased with the doping of Li, La, and Mg, whereas it decreased with the presence of K and Cs. (154) (iii) A cation mixed phase CuMxCl2+x formed with the addition of KCl and CsCl2, whereas it did not form in the presence of MgCl2 and LaCl3, no mixed halides were formed, and the formation depended on the treatment temperature for LiCl. (140, 154, 155) (iv) The overall reducibility of doped catalysts by ethylene followed the order: La > Mg > Li > undoped > K > Cs. (154) (v) Lewis acid sites were masked by doping with LiCl, MgCl2, CaCl2, and LaCl3, while new Lewis acid sites related to the doping cations emerged; Brnsted acid sites increased remarkably with the presence of all the dopants, except CsCl. (149) The physical changes (attrition and stickiness) of the catalysts applied in the fluidized-bed reactors are scarcely studied. CuCl2/γ-Al2O3 catalysts are prone to become sticky in fluidization. Addition of different promoters such as Li, K, Cs, Ba, La, and Ce can suppress the catalyst stickiness. (157) It is important to emphasize that the additive approach can bring only incremental improvements and does not eliminate the intrinsic drawbacks of copper chloride associated with its poor chemical and mechanical stability under reaction conditions. Virtually little research is devoted to the development of copper-free catalysts with a superior EDC selectivity and lifetime. Industrial conservatism and the deterrence of academia to undertake studies due to the high demands associated with this reaction can be postulated as the main reasons for the lack of new catalysts in this area.
2.3.2 Catalytic Dehydrochlorination of EDC to VCM
The predominant use of EDC is to prepare VCM by the gas-phase pyrolysis at 773823 K and 2535 bar. The existing cracking route has the intrinsic disadvantages such as low single-pass EDC conversions (5060%) and the formation of byproducts and cokes at elevated temperatures. Alternative methods have been explored in order to overcome these drawbacks, which include the low-temperature catalytic dehydrochlorination of EDC to VCM. Earlier results showed that polyacrylonitrile-based active carbon fiber (PAN-ACF) catalyzes the reaction at 573623 K with 99.9% VCM selectivity at 2163% conversions. (158) More recently, Zhang et al. reported a more effective N-doped coconut activated carbon (N-AC) catalyst with a VCM yield above 80% at 523 K. (159) Different zeolites have also been studied. An initial total conversion of EDC with a VCM yield of 92% was achieved over ZnO/HZSM-5 at 670 K. (160) A full VCM selectivity was attained with a hydrogen-assisted dehydrochlorination route over Ni-modified BEA zeolites. (161) All the above zeolite-based catalytic systems show comparable or even superior conversion rates than the pyrolysis process. However, a gradual decline in the activity is observed on all the catalysts during a long-term stability assessment, although the high selectivity was maintained. Additionally, the coke deposition has been commonly identified in these materials, which might block the active sites and cause the deactivation. (159, 161, 162) Recently, a novel approach was reported by De Vos et al. based on the vapor phase dehydrochlorination reaction in tetrabutylphosphonium chlorides (C4444P+Cl) ionic liquid. (163) A remarkable EDC conversion of 95% with a > 99.6% VCM selectivity was obtained at 513 K with a stable activity over 50 h by conducting the reaction with four chain reactors. However, long-term stability test on the phosphonium cations at relevant conditions is required in order to make this process applicable in industry. Another new route from EDC to VCM has been demonstrated by reacting EDC with acetylene (eq 1). (164) The nitrogen-doped activated carbon-supported Ru catalyst (Ru/N-AC) gave a VCM yield above 90% during 180 h time on stream at 523 K. (165) This route, using both acetylene and ethylene (for EDC synthesis) as the feedstocks, can overcome the drawbacks of EDC pyrolysis and avoid the current pollution-causing acetylene hydrochlorination step. Therefore, those regions where the PVC industries are still heavily relying on the acetylene-based process can take advantage of this method.

2.3.3 CeO2-Based Catalysts for VCM Production
The development of advanced technologies in chemical industry depends heavily on the discovery of multifunctional catalytic materials and innovative processes. The current ethylene-to-VCM route relies on the two-step process, entailing ethylene oxychlorination to EDC, followed by EDC thermal cracking to VCM. One-step VCM production is highly desirable in light of the greatly simplified process. However, this goal has not been achieved yet due to the lack of a suitable catalyst to perform the above-mentioned two reactions on the same surface. The copper chloride-based catalysts, exclusively employed in industry nowadays, cannot bridge the temperature gap between the two steps. Namely, the pyrolysis occurs at a higher temperature of 773823 K at which the volatilization of active metal components becomes remarkable. Palladium and rhodium chloride-based catalysts with different promoters have been disclosed in earlier patents, showing appreciable initial activity and selectivity to VCM (Table 1). (130, 131) However, the stability should be assessed for practical considerations of these systems. LaOCl has also been reported to produce VCM with a high selectivity of 78%; however, the intrinsic low activity of LaOCl requiring a long residence time of 3.68.7 s1, might restrict the productivity in large-scale implementation. (132) A recent study demonstrated an exceptional performance of ceria for the direct VCM production in a high yield (Figure 12a). (133) An investigation of representative HCl oxidation catalysts, in comparison to CuKLaClx/Al2O3, was conducted (Figure 12b). The results revealed a full EDC selectivity at ca. 12% C2H4 conversion, as expected, over copper catalysts at 473 K. However, this sample exhibited a significant copper and lanthanum loss during the reaction. The oxide catalysts required higher temperatures to reach the similar conversion levels as that of the copper system. Both IrO2 and RuO2 led to a significant combustion forming CO and CO2 at 673 K, whereas a high selectivity to chlorinated products (92% EDC, 6% VCM) at similar conversion levels was obtained over CeO2 at 623 K. This difference was substantiated based on the strong redox properties of the former two oxides, which are modulated over CeO2 under oxychlorination environment, enabling it to suppress the over oxidation causing COx formation. The high selectivity to chlorinated products was also maintained at 673 K over CeO2. Under these conditions, 35% of C2H4 conversion was obtained with 85% EDC and 13% VCM selectivity. Besides, CeO2 preserved its textural and bulk properties and demonstrated a stable activity for more than 10 h on stream with no hint for the metal loss. (133) The formation of VCM was noteworthy over this system. On the basis of this outstanding results on CeO2, efforts were made to improve the VCM yields through the optimization of reaction conditions and material properties. (133) It was found that high residence times are beneficial to increase the VCM selectivity and yield, but this also leads to the formation of unwanted COx. HCl-rich conditions were evidenced to further suppress the COx formation and enhance the EDC production, while the VCM selectivity remained unaltered. (133) Tuning of properties of ceria demonstrated that nanocrystalline, high surface area materials lead to the highest VCM yield of 25% at a residence time of 0.14 s, which is much higher than that reported for lanthanum-based systems (1118%) at a contact time of 3.68.7 s. (132) Furthermore, mixed ceria-zirconia catalysts were shown to improve the conversion while maintaining the same high selectivity of chlorinated products in a 30 h on stream test. (133) Figure 12 Figure 12. (a) The bifunctional ceria catalyst integrates both oxychlorination catalyzed by redox sites and dehydrochlorination led by acid sites on a single surface, thereby leading to intensified VCM production.

The origin of VCM formation on ceria was understood by different experiments. It was revealed that VCM comes consecutively from in situ EDC dehydrochlorination, which was hinted by experiments involving the variation of residence time, which evidenced an increase of VCM selectivity at the expense of EDC formation. To support this, separate EDC dehydrochlorination tests and acidity characterization of sample prior to (fresh) and after (used) the oxychlorination tests were conducted. Feeding of only EDC over ceria showed no VCM generation until 723 K, while addition of HCl+O2 to EDC feed (i.e., mimicking the reaction conditions) evidenced ca. 90% yield of VCM at 673 K (Figure 12c). This is explained on the basis of acidity characterization by temperature-programmed desorption of ammonia (NH3-TPD) on these two samples (Figure 12d). While fresh CeO2 showed very few acid centers at 523 K, the used sample displayed a huge increase in acid sites density and their strength. Thus, the unique performance of CeO2 for one-step VCM production was explained by its bifunctional character: redox centers oxychlorinate ethylene to EDC, which is subsequently dehydrochlorinated to VCM over in situ generated strong acid sites. These findings open new doors for the optimization and the intensification of the current two-step process within PVC production involving CuCl2-catalyzed oxychlorination and thermal cracking
2.3.4 Reactors and Processes
Reactor Technologies The highly exothermic ethylene oxychlorination reaction is carried out in staged multitubular fixed-bed or fluidized-bed reactors over promoted copper chloride catalysts, MCuClx/γ-Al2O3 (M = alkali metal, alkaline earth metal, and rare earth metal), at 493573 K and 214 bar. (16, 166) Both reactor technologies have their own advantages and disadvantages (Figure 13). Operation in fixed-bed reactors, hosting a bundle of tubes of 23 cm inner diameter and filled with millimeter-sized catalyst bodies, brings the heat removal issue due to the inevitable formation of hot spots at some location in the reactor tube. The temperature rise, that can exceed 100 K, (167) has two dramatic consequences: (i) a decreased catalyst lifetime due to the volatilization of copper chlorides and (ii) a decreased EDC selectivity arising from the total oxidation of ethylene, and/or the formation of undesired chlorinated compounds. (126) Therefore, the control of reaction temperatures is of utmost importance for the operation in fixed-bed reactors which directly determines the catalyst performance. Several approaches can be employed in order to eliminate the hot spots. The dilution of the catalyst bed, the grading of catalyst activity, and the staging of air or oxygen feed in reactor cascades can be applied to flatten the temperature profile and allow improved temperature control. In this sense, fluidized-bed reactors are preferred as they offer better temperature control of the catalyst bed. Due to the enhanced heat transfer efficiency, more uniform temperature profiles are attained in fluidized-bed reactors using micron-sized catalyst particles. However, there are a number of intrinsic drawbacks, such as unsteady operation, poor selectivity owing to the gas and catalyst solids back mixing, loss of heat transfer due to fouling of the cooler bundle, and the limit in reagent velocity imposed by the need to avoid catalyst loss by elutriation from the reactor. On top of these, the fluidization is particularly critical. A declining fluidization quality gradually occurs due to the progressive enlargement of catalyst particles, especially when the Cl:C ratio is close to 1. Under these conditions, the excess of HCl induces the formation of interparticle CuClx bridges, a phenomenon commonly referred to as stickiness, and leads to bigger agglomerates which settle and cause operating setbacks and even reactor shutdowns. (166) Figure 13 Figure 13. (a) Fluidized- and (b) multitubular fixed-bed reactor technologies in ethylene oxychlorination.
Processes Ethylene oxychlorination is at the heart of the modern balanced VCM process. To date, many distinctive processes have been developed by different companies with regard to two distinguished characteristics: oxygen feed (pure oxygen or air) and reactors (fixed- and fluidized-bed reactors). Herein, we examine the representative processes based on fixed- and fluidized-bed reactors technologies, developed by Stauffer/EVC and B.F. Goodrich (now Geon), respectively.
Stauffer/EVC Processes In the Stauffer process, the reactants (C2H4, HCl) are preheated to 403458 K before entering the reactors, while oxygen is divided into three equal portions and introduced, respectively, into three consecutive tubular reactors. (168) The reactors comprising multiple nickel tubes were stacked together within a single coolant jacket in which steam at ca. 483 K is used to control the temperature of the reaction. Besides, the catalyst loading is crucial for temperature control. Within each reactor, the catalyst bed is split into two stages: the upper catalyst bed containing a less active KCl-CuCl2/γ-Al2O3 catalyst and the below one comprising a more active one, differing in metal loading and the Cu/K ratio (shown in Figure 13b by color gradient from light showing less active to dark showing the more active one). The hot spots are typically managed within 613 K. In the EVC process, a KCl-CuCl2/γ-Al2O3 catalyst in the form of hollow cylinders are packed in the reactors in a manner of multiple layers (first an active catalyst layer, followed by a less active one and then again a highly active one). (169) In this way, the number of reactors were reduced to two, but the same EDC productivity was maintained with a better temperature control (Tmax < 558 K). In these processes, the HCl and oxygen conversions are typically above 98% and 99%, respectively, and the EDC selectivity is above 99% with only a few combustion products (<1%) and halogenated hydrocarbons in the ppm level.Geon Process For the Geon process, compressed air, ethylene, and HCl from the EDC cracking section are pretreated to ca. 423443 K and introduced into the bottom of the reactor to fluidize the catalyst. (26) Stoichiometric excess of ethylene and air are used to maximize the HCl conversion. Temperature is controlled by internal cooling coils directly submerged in the fluid bed and maintained in the range of 493498 K. Pressures are slightly elevated (1.72.4 bar) to increase the reaction efficiency and to aid the downstream EDC condensation. To recover the catalyst, the effluents leaving the reactor are directed into a cyclone where catalyst powders are separated and returned to the reactor. The rest stream is further directed to two sequential hot and cold quench columns, where all the HCl and some of the water are condensed in the first column while the remaining water and most of the EDC are captured in the second one. The EDC-containing mixtures are further separated in a decanter. A small amount of EDC (5%) from the gas stream of the cold quench column is absorbed by solvent extraction. With another separation step, the solvent can be recycled to the absorber, while the wet EDC from both sections should be dried and purified before cracking. The oxychlorination reaction is very selective, with EDC yields of >98% based on HCl and 96% based on ethylene and only minor amount of chlorinated hydrocarbon byproducts.
2.4 Ethane Oxychlorination for VCM Production
The strong incentive to use economic feedstocks triggered continued interests in the exploration of new technologies. Developing an ethane-based oxychlorination technology for VCM production would be another breakthrough in the vinyl chloride industry after the establishment of the balanced process and exerts a profound impact on the PVC manufacture in the future. Ethane is principally obtained from abundant natural gas, the quantity of which has been increasing enormously due to the widespread commercialization of hydraulic fracturing combined with the horizontal drilling technology. The price advantage of ethane over ethylene can be understood by the fact that its major large-scale commercialized chemical use is to produce ethylene by steam cracking. (170) Thus, devising a one-step ethane-to-VCM process will be an ideal solution to further complement the ever-increasing PVC demand by utilizing the low-cost natural gas. For these reasons, tremendous efforts from both academia and industry have been devoted to the development of novel catalysts and processes. (27, 78, 132, 171-173)
2.4.1 Catalysts
The oxychlorination of ethane has been investigated extensively over both copper-based and noncopper catalysts. Regardless of the catalysts employed, this reaction is generally conducted at much higher temperatures (ca. 713 K for 90% alkane conversion), owing to the difficulty of activating the strong CH bond in the ethane molecule. (174-177) At these temperatures, the formation of undesired overchlorinated compounds (both saturated and unsaturated) and carbon oxides is observed. Results in a laboratory fixed-bed reactor showed the low selectivity to VCM (ca. 50%), with ethylene being the major byproduct. (176, 178) In general, ethylene, ethyl chloride, and VCM are the major products of this reaction. Copper-based catalysts usually show a better selectivity to VCM, while ethyl chloride and ethylene are the predominant products over noncopper catalysts (Table 3). Exceptions have also been reported in both cases. An exceptionally high EDC yield of 90% over CuCl2/desiccant catalysts was claimed in an early patent. (78) On the other hand, a porous LaOCl catalyst (179) demonstrated to be highly selective for VCM production.

Copper-Based Catalysts Pure copper chloride catalysts are scarcely utilized for ethane oxychlorination due to the inferior stability at high temperatures needed for this reaction. Different dopants have been added to improve the thermal stability. However, it is inappropriate to simply consider these dopants as structural promoters (e.g., improved melting temperature and higher dispersion), since in many cases, electronic effects (e.g., acidbase and redox properties) are more prominent, which can lead to enhanced hydrochlorination performance.
Different dopants such as alkali (K and Li) and rare-earth (La, Ce, and Pr) metals have been studied (Figure 14a). Results from an early patent show that pure alkali metal-doped catalysts were not selective for VCM (33% selectivity at 753 K over CuKClx/Al2O3), leading to a spectrum of polychlorinated compounds. (172) These dopants are thus almost exclusively used together with other additives instead of alone to further enhance the stability and selectivity. As mentioned earlier, the stability is a big issue for the Cu-based catalysts. A study on LaKCuClx/γ-Al2O3 revealed gradual catalyst deactivation with decreased VCM selectivity due to severe copper leaching (24% Cu loss after 100 h) and coke deposition. The latter was confirmed by the sharp weight loss accompanied by an exothermic peak from TGA/DTA profiles (Figure 14b). (174) To date, the highest yield of VCM (88% at 823 K) was obtained over CuLiPtClx-K3PO4/α-Al2O3 catalysts reported by the researchers in Monsanto Company. (184) The catalysts were prepared by sequential impregnation of first a mixture of metal chlorides and then K3PO4 and tested in a fluidized-bed reactor. Ethyl chloride and VCM are observed to be the main products in the temperature range of 623873 K, while higher temperature is apparently more favorable for higher selectivity of VCM irrespective of contact times. Acidbase property of catalysts can be an important factor for the selective formation of VCM. An improved VCM selectivity was observed on CeO2-doped CuKClx/MgO-γ-Al2O3 catalysts compared to that on the undoped sample (Figure 14a). (176) The addition of CeO2 led to increased intensity of acidic sites (Figure 14c), probably attributed to the generation of surface capping oxygen species (O and O2). These acidic sites might facilitate the dehydrochlorination of EDC to VCM. As the most crucial component, the dispersion and redox properties of copper chlorides can directly influence the catalytic performance. For example, the H2 consumption corresponding to the reduction of Cu2+ to Cu0 was greatly increased over praseodymium-promoted CuKClx/MgO-γ-Al2O3 catalysts (Figure 14d). (178) Calculation of the surface Cu content from the above results showed two times enhanced copper dispersion with an addition of 5 wt % Pr. Consequently, a higher ethane conversion and a higher VCM selectivity were achieved over the Pr-doped catalysts. Chromium has been recognized as an electronic promoter to CuKClx-CeO2/γ-Al2O3 catalysts. Comparison of the Cu 2p XPS spectra of fresh and used catalysts revealed that the redox capacity of Cu2+/Cu+ can be facilitated by Cr addition (Figure 14e). Consequently, an improved performance was obtained over the catalyst with 3 wt % Cr addition. (181) Figure 14 Figure 14.

Promoters for Cu-based catalysts in ethane oxychlorination are generally introduced in the form of metal chlorides or oxides by impregnation. Recently, Hu et al. reported a striking promotional effect of a perovskite compound, La2NiMnO6, on the performance of CuCl2/γ-Al2O3 catalyst. (183) After further modification with potassium, the catalyst afforded a total ethane conversion with a VCM yield of ca. 40% at 773 K during 95 h on stream (Figure 15a). The main side-product was ethylene. The promotional effects of both K and La2NiMnO6 were demonstrated by comparing the performance of relevant catalysts (Figure 15b). The K promoter can further modify the electronic properties of the catalyst, as demonstrated by XPS and H2-TPR techniques, leading to higher amounts of surface Mn4+ and adsorbed oxygen species (Figure 15c), as well as higher reducibility of Cu2+ (Figure 15d). All these factors contribute to the better VCM selectivity and catalyst stability.

Noncopper Catalysts The failures in ethane oxychlorination might be explained by the approach which is based on the extrapolation of Cu-based catalysts applied in ethylene oxychlorination. (174, 176, 184, 189, 190) These systems are not suitable in the case of ethane because the operating temperature of alkane oxychlorination is much higher than that of alkene oxychlorination and thus compromises the stability of copper catalysts. (174, 191) While Cu-based catalysts usually provide appreciable VCM selectivity, the product distribution differs significantly over noncopper catalysts. Instead of VCM, ethylene and ethyl chloride might dominate in the products. For example, a study on silica-supported iron pyrophosphates doped with various metal cations showed that ethyl chloride and ethylene were the main products. (27) Higher temperature facilitates the dehydrochlorination of ethyl chloride and leads to an enhanced selectivity of ethylene. Balzhinimaev et al. investigated a novel K4Ru2OCl10/TiO2 catalyst for the low-temperature ethane oxychlorination (523573 K). (188) An ethyl chloride selectivity of 80% at 13% ethane conversion was achieved at 573 K. However, above this temperature, the formation of carbon oxides prevailed and the selectivity to ethyl chloride dropped drastically. It was reported that nanosized CeO2 was suitable for ethane oxychlorination, giving ethylene as the only predominant product [S(C2H4) = 67%, T = 723 K]. (187) A solution catalyst containing iron cations, used in a fluidized-bed reactor technology, showed a high ethane conversion (9298%) with 2335% selectivity to VCM, but the serious leaching of iron led to drastic catalyst deactivation. (171) Doping with La was suggested to alleviate the iron leaching and thus improved the catalyst lifetime. (192) To date, the highest VCM selectivity of 79% was achieved over LaOCl catalysts among noncopper materials (Table 3), operated at 673 K in a fluidized-bed reactor. (179, 185, 193) The porous LaOCl catalysts, obtained by a precipitation method, was used as the precursor, which after activation by a gas mixture of 5% HCl/N2 at 623 K can be converted to a highly active LaCl3 form.
Reaction Mechanism With regard to the reaction mechanism of ethane oxychlorination, it is expected that there will be a competition among chlorination (both addition and substitution), oxidation, and dehydrochlorination. The specific reaction routes can be fundamentally different depending on the catalysts applied. The mechanism over Cu-based catalysts has been proposed which mimics that in ethylene oxychlorination. (180) The activation of ethane can be initiated by free chlorine radicals, with the formation of chloroethanes. The Cu2+/Cu+ redox pair was acknowledged to manipulate the release of Cl2 by the decomposition of CuCl2 to Cu2Cl2. (176, 183) Ethyl chloride was regarded as the primary product, and ethylene was obtained by its dehydrochlorination. The rest of the reaction network follows roughly the same paths as in ethylene oxychlorination. Another two different reaction mechanisms, emphasizing the role of surface or lattice chloride, have been proposed over K4Ru2OCl10/TiO2 (188) and LaOCl (179) catalysts. Ethane oxychlorination over both catalysts can take place readily below 673 K. Besides, the valence states of Ru and La were stable after these catalysts were subjected to oxychlorination ambience. The ruthenium oxychloride species in K4Ru2OCl10/TiO2 were believed to be the active sites for ethane activation. Experiments on a reference RuO2/TiO2 catalyst showed a poor ethyl chloride selectivity (30%), and large amounts of EDC and combustion products were present. (188) In situ IR experiments further confirmed the immediate formation of ethoxy groups after the K4Ru2OCl10/TiO2 catalysts were exposed to the reaction feeds. It is suggested that the surface-bound ethoxy groups can release ethylene or ethyl chloride by HCl addition (Figure 16a). For LaOCl catalysts, hydrocarbon chlorination was supposed to occur through lattice chlorine based on reactive pulse techniques, as the presence of gas phase HCl or Cl2 was not necessary. (194) The surface chlorination level of the catalysts played a vital role in regulating the product distribution, with the highest chlorination rates and selectivity observed on fully chlorinated catalysts. (179) A specific reaction pathway was proposed for the LaOCl catalysts, where VCM was deemed to be the dehydrochlorination product of EDC while carbon oxides were formed solely by the oxidation of hydrocarbons (Figure 16b).

2.4.2 Accounts of Developing Processes
Devising alternative routes to VCM and C2 compounds from ethane has long been an objective of the chemical industry. Among these, ethane oxychlorination to VCM has been actively explored for more than half a century. To date, a number of processes have been disclosed in patents, but none has been commercialized yet. (29, 195-198) Since ethane oxychlorination is highly demanding in terms of selective formation of VCM, the role of catalysts is extremely prominent. This is because the reactor technologies and process design are closely related to the catalysts used. Thus, it is of our interest to compare the developing processes based on different catalysts and point to the main hurdles constraining their implementation.
Lummus Process An earlier fixed-bed reactor technology developed by Lummus using conventional CuClx/Cu2OCl2 catalysts yielded a VCM selectivity of 37% at 28% ethane conversion (Figure 17). (29, 195) In this process, three consecutive reactors were operated in a temperature range of 643923 K. Ethane oxychlorination occurred in the first reactor, where the effluents, after a separation section, were split: ethyl chloride was recycled to the first reactor, while EDC was directed to dehydrochlorination to VCM in the second reactor with the same melt salt catalysts. In order to recover chlorine, the other chlorinated hydrocarbons from the first two reactors were combusted to enrich the chlorine/hydrogen chloride-rich effluent. The recovered catalysts from the first two reactors, after passing a heat exchange vessel, were directed into the regeneration reactor to contact with the effluent from the combustion reactor. The molten salt catalysts can adsorb chlorine/hydrogen chloride from the effluent, and after partially oxidized, convert to the original mixture components (CuClx/Cu2OCl2). Since these melt catalysts can easily volatilize at such high temperatures, a quench system inside each reactor, with an external cyclone separator, was installed to ease the supply of fresh catalysts. Apparently, the low catalyst efficiency and energy-intensive nature due to continuous catalysts cycling render this process unattractive.
Figure 17 Figure 17. A simplified scheme of the Lummus process for ethane oxychlorination over CuClx-based catalysts relied on the fixed-bed reactor technology, comprising ethane oxychlorination, dehydrochlorination of EDC to VCM, combustion of chlorinated hydrocarbons to enrich chloride-rich effluent, and the regeneration of used melt salt catalysts with the effluent from combustion. The three reactors with catalysts loaded were installed with an internal quench system and an external cyclone separator to ease catalyst volatilization. The catalysts were recovered (blue lines) to regenerate in a separate reactor and cycled to replenish the catalyst beds (red lines). Adapted from ref 195.
EVC Process EVC made a breakthrough for VCM production from ethane via an integrated multistep process whose viability was assessed by a pilot plant in 1999 (1000 ton per annum). (29) In this process (Figure 18a), the oxychlorination was catalyzed by Cu/K/Ce components supported on fluidizable low-surface area Al2O3 and operated in a fluidized-bed reactor at 723743 K. (196) VCM and anhydrous HCl in the effluent were separated, and the latter was directly cycled in the oxychlorination reactor. The other stream first passed by a chlorinator, where chlorine was introduced, to convert ethylene into EDC. Then the effluents containing both saturated and unsaturated chlorinated hydrocarbons were further directed to a trickle bed reactor where unsaturated products were hydrogenated over precious metal catalysts (Pt, Pd, and Rh) and directed into the oxychlorination reactor for VCM production. In this way, all the organic compounds are finally dehydrochlorinated to VCM, except CCl4. (197) In the oxychlorination reactor, an excess of recycled HCl suppresses ethane combustion and enables one to decrease the reaction temperature below 723 K with acceptable conversion and selectivity. By recycling the byproducts, a very high overall VCM yield >90% was claimed. The pilot test over 2000 h has shown no corrosion problems, and the catalyst has been observed to be stable. EVC claimed this novel process reduces the production cost over the PVC chain by 2030%. (199) Figure 18 Figure 18. Simplified schemes of processes of VCM production from ethane. (a) The EVC process based on ethane oxychlorination over CuKCeClx/Al2O3 in a fluidized-bed reactor. (197) HCl from the separation was recycled in the oxychlorination reactor. Ethylene from the oxychlorination reactor was converted to EDC in a vapor-phase chlorinator where chlorine was introduced as the halogen source. All the Cl-containing unsaturated hydrocarbons (C2H4nCln) were further hydrogenated to saturated ones (C2H6nCln) and fed back to the oxychlorination reactor to generate VCM by dehydrochlorination. HCl was cycled in the oxychlorination reactor. (b) An envisioned VCM production process based on the fluidized-bed reactor technology via oxychlorination of ethane over the LaOCl catalyst, developed by the Dow Chemical Company. Elemental chlorine together with the cycled HCl was directed into the oxychlorination reactor. The mixture of C2 hydrocarbons were also recycled after separation, while the rest of the chlorinated compounds were converted to EDC in a hydrogenation unit and then merged with the cycled hydrocarbons and HCl. Adapted from ref 179. Copyright 2010 American Chemical Society. (c) The ethane-to-VCM process developed by BASF that integrates essentially the dehydrogenation of ethane to ethylene, subsequent oxychlorination to EDC, and a cracking step, (198) where n = 06, l = 4 or 6.
