1. Introduction
The catalytic dehydrogenation of alkanes is a process of con- siderable importance, because it represents a route for obtaining alkenes from poorly reactive and low-cost saturated feedstocks [13]. In this respect, an important reaction is the dehydrogenation of propane to propylene [46]. This process is of increasing signif- icance due to the limited capabilities of steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking to meet the increasing demands of the propy- lene market [79]. In this sense, chromium oxide-based catalysts have been used for the dehydrogenation of propane in the absence of hydrogen as a co-feed gas [1012], and platinum-based cata- lysts have been used for the dehydrogenation of propane in the presence of hydrogen [1316]. From environmental and practical standpoints, however, chromium-free catalysts are highly desirable for the dehydrogenation of propane in the absence of hydrogen [5].
In recent years, Ga2O3-based catalysts have attracted interest as potential candidates for alkane dehydrogenation processes [5,1721]. This was prompted by Nakagawas reports of exceptionally high activity of the commercial Ga2O3 for the dehydrogenation of ethane to ethylene in the presence of CO2 [20]. Although commer- cial Ga2O3 has been shown to be far superior for the ethane de- hydrogenation reaction compared with Cr2O3 and V2O5 catalysts,some recent studies have demonstrated that supported gallium oxides can be more active and stable for the dehydrogenation of light alkanes [5,2123]. In particular, promising results have been * Corresponding author. Fax: +86 21 55665287.

Other Ga2O3-based systems evaluated in the recent literature as alkane dehydrogenation cat- alysts include different polymorphs of Ga2O3, such as α-, β-, γ -,and δ-Ga2O3 [24].
Despite extensive efforts dedicated to the reaction mechanism and the factors that control activity, the aforementioned Ga2O3- based catalysts all deactivate drastically within a few hours [21,23,24], because a high density of medium-strong acid sites on the surface of the Ga2O3-based materials favors considerable coke for- mation under alkane dehydrogenation conditions [21,23,25]. Neu- tralizing the acid sites by introducing potassium to the gallium oxide system has been used in propane dehydrogenation in an ef- fort to suppress coke deposition [4]; however, this leads only to a drastic drop in catalytic activity. In the continuing search for more effective technologies for propylene production [46], there is a definite need for new, improved gallia-based catalysts that can allow efficient and stable dehydrogenation of propane in the pres- ence of carbon dioxide under mild conditions.
Based on their superior ability to activate hydrocarbon species,galliaalumina solid solutions have attracted considerable recent attention as excellent materials for the selective catalytic reduction (SCR) of NOx by hydrocarbons owing to their unique surface acidity properties [2630]. To the best of our knowledge, however, the use of Ga2O3Al2O3 solid solutions as catalysts in the alkane dehydro- genation reaction has not yet been reported. In the present study,we investigated the development of a new, efficient Ga2O3Al2O3 solid solution system exhibiting significantly enhanced activity and 0021-9517/$  see front matter  2008 Elsevier Inc.

stability for the catalytic dehydrogenation of propane. Our results demonstrate that the formation of galliaalumina solid solution between Ga2O3 and Al2O3 can allow the favorable creation of a higher population of surface gallium sites with weak Lewis acidity,which makes the Ga2O3-based catalysts highly active and stable for the reaction.
2. Experimental
2.1. Catalyst preparation
A series of mixed Ga2O3Al2O3 oxide catalysts with various compositions as well as the simple oxide of Al2O3 and Ga2O3 were prepared through an alcoholic coprecipitation pathway [31]. In a typical synthesis, concentrated aqueous ammonia (28 wt%) and ethanol (50:50 in volume) was added dropwise to the ethanol so- lution of gallium nitrate hydrate (Aldrich, 99.99%) and aluminum nitrate hydrate (Fluka, 99.9%) with different Ga:Al molar ratio un- til pH ca. 8.5 and no further precipitation occurred. The resulting gel was quickly filtered and thoroughly washed by ethanol, dried at 373 K overnight, and finally calcined at 773 K for 6 h.
2.2. Catalyst characterization
The BET specific surface areas of the samples were determined by adsorptiondesorption of nitrogen at liquid nitrogen tempera- ture using a Micromeritics TriStar 3000 instrument. Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) of the catalysts was carried out on a Germany Bruker D8Advance X-ray diffractometer using nickel-filtered CuKα radiation at 40 kV and 20 mA. The acidic property of each cata- lyst was characterized by NH3-TPD. NH3 was adsorbed at 393 K after pretreatment at 773 K in a He stream. The desorbed NH3 in flowing He gas was quantified (NH2 fragment of mass number 16) by mass spectroscopy (Balzers OmniStar) at 393873 K (ramp rate, 10 K min1). To characterize the nature of the acid sites, spec- tra of chemisorbed pyridine were obtained with a Bruker Vector 22 spectrometer using self-supporting wafers in a heatable IR gas cell. The samples were pretreated at 773 K for 1 h under vac- uum before pyridine adsorption. Pyridine was adsorbed at room temperature from an argon flow containing 2 vol% pyridine, after which the samples were heated to 373 K and evacuated to remove physisorbed and weakly chemisorbed pyridine. Each spectrum was obtained by subtracting the background (base spectrum) of the un- loaded sample.
The XPS spectra of the samples were obtained with a Perkin Elmer PHI 5000C spectrometer working in the constant analyzer energy mode with MgKα radiation as the excitation source. The carbonaceous C 1s line (284.6 eV) was used as the reference to calibrate the binding energies (BEs). Elemental analysis was performed using ion-coupled plasma (ICP) atomic emission spec- troscopy on a Thermo Electron IRIS Intrepid II XSP spectrometer.
Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was conducted on a Perkin Elmer TGA-7 analyzer to determine the amount of coke deposited on the catalyst after the reaction. Twenty milligrams of sample was heated from room temperature to 873 K at a heating rate of 10 K min1 in flowing air. 71Ga MAS NMR measurements were performed on a Bruker Avance DMX-500 spectrometer operating at 152.5 MHz, equipped with a 2.5-mm double-bearing MAS probe head spinning at 30 kHz. Approximately 40,000 transients were accumulated for each sample with a 0.1-s recycling delay. The chemical shifts were referenced to 1 mol L1 Ga(NO3)3 solution.
2.3. Catalytic activity tests
Catalytic tests were performed in a fixed-bed flow microreactor at atmospheric pressure, with a catalyst load of 200 mg. Nitrogen was used as the carrier gas at a flow rate of 10 mL min1. The cat- alysts were pretreated at 773 K for 1 h in nitrogen flow, and the reaction temperature was 773 K. For dehydrogenation of propane in the absence of CO2, the gas reactant contained 2.5 vol% propane and the balance nitrogen (N2). For dehydrogenation of propane in the presence of carbon dioxide, the gas reactant contained 2.5 vol% propane, 5 vol% CO2, and the balance nitrogen. The hydrocarbon reaction products were analyzed with an online gas chromatograph (Type GC-122, Shanghai) equipped with a 6-m packed column of Porapak Q and a flame ionization detector. The gas products, in- cluding N2, CO, and CO2, were analyzed online by another gas chromatograph equipped with a TDX-01 column and a TCD.
2.4. Transient response of the pulsed reactions
Transient response measurements of pulsed reactions were car- ried out at 773 K using a U-shaped quartz reactor (4 mm i.d.,400 mm long), with 100 mg of the catalyst charged into the re- actor. A pulse of propylene gas was introduced through a six-port gas-sampling valve equipped with measuring tubes under a stream of CO2 carrier gas. The signals of C3H6 (M/e = 41), CO (M/e = 28),and H2 (M/e = 2), were recorded simultaneously by a Balzers Om- niStar quadrupole mass spectrometer. Measured intensities were corrected for the relative sensitivities of the respective ions.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Structural characterization
The powder XRD patterns of mixed Ga2O3Al2O3 oxides with nominal Ga:Al ratios of 4:1, 1:1, and 1:4 closely resembled those of simple oxides of γ -Ga2O3 and γ -Al2O3. No diffraction lines as- signed to other polymorphs of Ga2O3 were observed for all mixed Ga2O3Al2O3 oxide samples, although several phases of gallium oxide (e.g., α-, β-, and δ-Ga2O3) are known to be present de- pending on the treatment conditions [32]. As shown in Fig. 1, all diffraction lines were very broad, demonstrating a low crystallinity of all of the samples. This low crystallinity is a common feature of the metastable γ -variety of both alumina and gallia polymorphs [31] and was expected due to the high surface area of the mixed Ga2O3Al2O3 samples, for which nitrogen adsorption isotherms at 77 K gave BET surface area values ranging from 119 m2 g1 for the sample with a nominal Ga:Al ratio of 4:1 to 147 m2 g1 for Ga:Al = 1:4 (Table 1). Within this range of end values, specific surface area was found to increase monotonously with increasing aluminum content of the mixed galliaalumina oxides.
Despite the broadness, the diffraction maxima evidenced in the XRD patterns of the galliaalumina samples could be assigned to a single phase having the cubic spinel-type structure (space group Fd3m) [33], as shown by the indexing in Fig. 1. The position of the diffraction angle (2θ value) was found to decrease with in- creasing aluminum content of the samples, thus suggesting solid solution formation [24,31,34]. From the measured d(440) spacings,corresponding values of the cubic lattice parameter, a0, were de- termined; these values are plotted in the inset of Fig. 1 as a function of gallium content of the mixed oxides. The a0 values of
0.790 nm for pure γ -Al2O3 and 0.832 nm for pure γ -Ga2O3 are
in good accordance with the values reported in the literature [31].
The a0 value for the galliaalumina mixed oxides showed an ap- proximately linear dependence on the chemical composition. This result, taken together with the absence of any diffraction line not assignable to a single cubic phase in the corresponding XRD pat- terns, gives strong evidence of the formation of a series of spinel- type solid solutions with the chemical composition GaxAl10xO15 (0 < x < 10).

The 71Ga MAS NMR chemical shift is known to reflect the coor- dination state of the Ga3+ ion in oxide compounds [31,34]. Fig. 2 shows the 71Ga MAS NMR spectra of the mixed Ga2O3Al2O3 sam- ples and the γ -Ga2O3 sample. Two asymmetric bands, split into at least four spinning sidebands, with chemical shifts of about 180 and 10 ppm [referred to Ga(NO3)3] appeared in the NMR spec- tra of the GaxAl10xO15 samples. According to the literature [31,3437], these bands are assigned to the central transition of the Ga3+ ion occupying tetrahedral (GaIV) and octahedral (GaVI) sites,respectively. With increasing aluminum content, a progressively increasing intensity of the line due to the tetrahedral Ga3+ ion (180 ppm) was observed for the GaxAl10xO15 samples, as op- posed to the trend for the octahedral Ga3+ ion (10 ppm). A peak deconvolution of the NMR GaIV and GaVI bands provides more information about the Ga3+ distribution (among tetrahedral and octahedral sites) in the spinel structure. As shown in Table 1, the percentage of Ga3+ ions (referred to the total Ga content of the mixed oxides) found in tetrahedral sites increased markedly with decreasing Ga/Al ratio, indicating that the Ga3+ ions preferentially Fig. 2. 71Ga MAS NMR spectra of GaAl catalysts: (a) Ga2O3; (b) Ga8Al2O15;(c) Ga5Al5O15; (d) Ga2Al8O15. Asterisks denote spinning sidebands. occupied the tetrahedral sites of the defect spinel structure of the γ -Ga2O3Al2O3 solid solution [3537]. The tetrahedral preference of Ga3+, also found for many other spinels containing gallium [30,31,38,39], can be explained in terms of a covalent contribution to the metaloxygen bond, which is strongly developed in closed- shell d10 ions, such as Ga3+.
3.2. Surface acidity measurements
The surface acidity of the mixed Ga2O3Al2O3 oxides, as well as simple oxides of γ -Ga2O3 and γ -Al2O3, was measured by the NH3-TPD method. Because of the sites low density and moderate strength, the samples were flushed with nitrogen after ammonia 296

All of the samples exhibited two desorption peaks: a broad peak at 393623 K and a smaller peak at 673800 K, correspond- ing to acid sites of weak and medium strength, respectively [23].
The relative acid values obtained from the NH3-TPD measurements are given in Table 2. Because no obvious relationship between the surface acidity of the oxides and the composition of the mixed oxides was observed, we correlated the specific acid site density (expressed in terms of μmol m2) and the Ga3+ distribution based on the 71Ga NMR data. The results, given in Fig. 3, show that the weak acid site density for the galliaalumina mixed oxides is an approximately linear function of the tetrahedral Ga3+ population.
This result, in conjunction with much higher population of weak acid sites relative to medium sites, suggests the essential role of tetrahedral surface Ga3+ sites in creating the surface acidity of the mixed oxides [40,41].
Additional insight into the acid nature of the catalysts was gained from the pyridine adsorption coupled with FTIR measure- ments reported in Fig. 4. The results show that pyridine adsorption on fresh catalysts at room temperature, followed by evacuation at 423 K, gave rise to three characteristic IR bands at 1614 cm1 (ν8a),1490 cm+1 (ν19a), and ca. 1452 cm1 (ν19b), which can be assigned to pyridine species interacting with Lewis acid sites [34,40,42]. Ac- cording to the literature data, these Lewis acid sites are related to coordinatively unsaturated (cus) Ga3+ or Al3+ ions in the tetrahe- dral position [40]. No bands were observed at 1640 or 1545 cm1 in the spectra corresponding to pyridinium ions, indicating that the material under study has no Brnsted acid sites of sufficient strength to protonate the adsorbed molecule [42]. It is notewor- thy that an appreciable increase in the intensity of the ν19b band of adsorbed pyridine also has been identified for the mixed-oxide Fig. 4.

3.3. Dehydrogenation of propane
The dehydrogenation of propane to propylene over the five mixed- or single-oxide catalysts in the presence or absence of CO2 was investigated at 773 K. The major product formed in the reac- tion was propylene, and the minor products were ethane, ethylene,and methane. Note that the aromatization of propane occurring predominantly over Ga-ZSM-5 systems [43] was not identified in the present study, possibly due to the absence of Gaδ+ (δ < 2) species on XPS measurements (not shown). The results, reported in Table 3, point to a marked composition effect on the catalytic performance of the GaxAl10xO15 samples. The simple oxide of γ -Al2O3 demonstrated very low activity, consistent with the in- ferior activity of alumina and other metal oxides reported in the literature [20], indicating that the presence of Ga species is in- dispensable to the genesis of catalytically active sites for alkane dehydrogenation. For all of the Ga-containing materials, the selec- tivity to propylene was always high (>91%), whereas the highest conversion of propane was 51.7%. The initial conversion of propane on the catalysts decreased in the order Ga8Al2O15 > γ -Ga2O3 > Ga5Al5O15 > Ga2Al8O15, with the same tendency observed for the specific activity normalized by BET surface area. This demonstrates that despite its lower Ga2O3 content, a γ -Ga2O3Al2O3 solid solu-

Moreover, the promoting role of carbon dioxide in the dehydrogenation of propane was not observed in all samples. Such a negative effect was previously reported by Xu et al. over Al2O3- and ZrO2-supported gallium oxide catalysts [23]. This unexpected phenomenon has been attributed to the greatly reduced propane adsorption capacity when CO2 is introduced into these systems [21,23].
Fig. 5 characterizes the catalytic performance in both processes as a function of reaction time. For all of the catalysts, propane con- version decreased with increasing reaction time. Thus decreased propene yield can be attributed to carbon deposition on the sur- face of Ga2O3-based materials, as suggested in previous work [24,25]. With the γ -Ga2O3 catalyst, rapid deactivation of the cata- lyst in both the presence and absence of carbon dioxide was seen,and conversion of propane decreased from 35.9 to 17% and from
41.3 to 11.6% within 8 h, respectively. In contrast, the propylene
yields were increased markedly by the introduction of aluminum in both the presence and absence of carbon dioxide in the runs for 8 h. In addition, propane conversion of the GaxAl10xO15 catalysts at steady state were considerably higher in the presence of carbon dioxide than in the absence of carbon dioxide, indicating remark- able stability as a function of time on stream. The amounts of coke deposited on the four Ga-containing catalysts in both processes evaluated by TGA, given in Table 1, indicate that the markedly en- hanced stability of the GaxAl10xO15 catalysts in the presence of CO2 may be due to their low coking tendency as a function of time on stream, which appears to be rather unique in this type of application.
Previous investigations of the use of Ga2O3-based catalysts for ethane or propane dehydrogenation have found that various pa- rameters, including the nature of the support, the coordination state and reducibility of gallium species, and the acid/base prop- erties and gallium content of the catalysts, must be considered to account for the observed catalytic behavior in the dehydrogenation of light alkanes [4,2125]. Generally, a catalyst with a high surface acid site density performs better in the dehydrogenation of alka- nes [24]. To clarify the dependence of the catalytic activity on in- corporation of aluminum, Fig. 6 illustrates the correlation between the initial activity of the GaxAl10xO15 catalysts in the presence of CO2 and the density of both weak and medium-strong acid sites as determined by NH3-TPD. Whereas the variation of surface weak acid site density demonstrated excellent correlation with the cor- responding propane conversion rates, a negative correlation was identified between activity and medium-strong acid site density.This indicates that weak surface acidity (specifically, weak Lewis acid site density of the surface), not medium-strong surface acid- ity, is crucial to achieving high activity and stability. This result,298

Fig. 6. Acid site amount per surface area versus conversion of propane at 0.25 h for GaxAl10xO15 catalysts in the presence of carbon dioxide. along with the essential nature of tetrahedral Ga3+ population in contributing to weak surface acidity, provides strong evidence of the key role of surface tetrahedral Ga3+ sites in propane dehydro- genation.
The participation of surface Ga3+ Lewis sites in gallia-based cat- alysts for hydrocarbon activation has been reported [30]. In this context, it has been suggested that hydrocarbon activation pro- ceeds on low-coordinated Ga3+ cations, which may play a role in the chemical activation of propane by proton abstraction, leading to the formation of propyl-gallium adspecies [23,24]. The dehydro- genation products are formed by subsequent decomposition of the resulting propyl-Ga species. A recent spectroscopic investigation by Kazansky et al. [44] found that the low-coordinated Ga3+ Lewis sites over gallium oxide were highly effective in the heterolytic dissociative adsorption of ethane even at room temperature. This unusual alkane activation behavior was linked to a very strong po- larizability of the CH bonds resulting from perturbation of ethane by the low-coordinated Ga3+ cations [44]. This may well account for the markedly improved propane dehydrogenation activity of the Ga2O3Al2O3 solid solution materials compared with simple gallium oxide. In this respect, it appears that more active cata- lysts for propane dehydrogenation can be obtained by achieving a higher population of low-coordinated surface Ga3+ sites in the Ga2O3-based catalysts.
3.4. Stability and regeneration test
One of the main problems when using Ga2O3-based catalysts in the dehydrogenation of propane is their deactivation with time on stream [25]. To examine the likely long-term behavior of the galliaalumina solid solution catalysts under reaction conditions,an extended 50-h on-stream operation for dehydrogenation of propane in the presence of CO2 was carried out on the Ga5Al5O15 and γ -Ga2O3 catalysts. As shown in Fig. 7, despite the presence of CO2, rapid deactivation of the catalyst performance was observed for the simple oxide of γ -Ga2O3. After 16 h, propane conver- sion decreased significantly, to 2.1%. This significant decrease in propane conversion is consistent with the poor stability of Ga2O3- based catalysts reported in the literature [24]. Compared with the γ -Ga2O3 catalyst, the Ga5Al5O15 sample exhibited significantly en- hanced stability despite being slightly inferior to γ -Ga2O3 at the initial stage of the reaction. The Ga5Al5O15 catalyst deactivated Fig. 7. Conversions of propane as a function of time on stream for Ga5Al5O15 and Ga2O3 in the presence of carbon dioxide at 773 K. from an initial propane conversion value of 33.7 to 26.5% after 16 h on stream, corresponding to an activity loss of 17.2%. This loss of activity compares favorably with that of 94% for γ -Ga2O3 from an initial conversion of 35.9 to 2.1% after the same period of opera- tion. It is noteworthy that even after 50 h on stream, high conver- sion of propane (up to 22.5%) was still maintained for Ga5Al5O15.
To the best of our knowledge, simple Ga2O3 as a dehydrogena- tion catalyst is inclined to deactivate rapidly, a problem that needs to be addressed [21,24]. Remarkable stability for propane dehydro- genation was recently reported for an HZSM-5-supported Ga2O3 catalyst at 873 K, but at the expense of marked side reactions,such as propane aromatization [25]. With high selectivity to propy- lene, such outstanding stability for the gallia-containing catalysts has never before been reported.
To gain more insight into the dehydrogenation of propane in the presence of CO2 over GaxAl10xO15 catalysts, a pulsed reac- tion technique was used to measure propylene adsorption over the catalyst [21]. Fig. 8 shows the transient response of propylene adsorption over various Ga2O3-based catalysts against a pulsed in- troduction of propylene at 773 K under a steady flow of CO2.
Nearly the same response of propylene with a similar propylene area relative to the blank runs was observed for the Ga2Al8O15 cat- alyst; however, the propylene response was lower for the γ -Ga2O3, Ga8Al2O15, and Ga5Al5O15 catalysts than for the blank runs. In ad- dition, the higher the gallium content, the smaller the propylene signals. It is interesting to note that although the simple oxide γ - Ga2O3 catalyst is characterized by a lower surface Lewis acidity, as evidenced by the NH3-TPD and pyridine adsorption measurements,the desorption of propylene from the catalyst surface appeared to be favored on the surface of the galliaalumina mixed oxide cata- lysts. Although more work is needed to clarify the unusual adsorp- tion behavior of propylene on the weak surface Lewis acid sites,we believe that factors other than surface acidity, such as compet- itive adsorption due to the presence of CO2, may play a role in determining the unique adsorption capability of the GaAl mixed oxide materials. Therefore, in conjunction with the coking forma- tion data derived from TGA of the spent catalyst (Table 1), the results seem to indicate that the increased desorption of propy- lene from the catalyst surface is responsible for enhanced stability of the GaxAl10xO15 catalysts during the catalytic dehydrogenation of propane [4547].
Another issue of practical importance is the stability of the de- hydrogenation catalyst after repeated regeneration cycles. Attempts were made to regenerate the deactivated γ -Ga2O3, Ga8Al2O15, and Ga5Al5O15 catalysts subjected to 8 h of reaction in the absence of

CO2 by recalcinating the used catalyst in flowing air at 823 K for 4 h, followed by subsequent purging with N2. This procedure was found to be sufficient to burn off all carbon species deposited on the deactivated catalysts. As shown in Fig. 9, the Ga5Al5O15 cata- lyst was much more stable than the other two samples. Clearly, the original activity of the Ga5Al5O15 catalyst could be fully restored,with no noticeable deactivation detected even after the second re- generation. The Ga8Al2O15 catalyst was deactivated from an initial conversion value of propane of 51.7% at 773 K to 45.5% after two successive reactionregeneration cycles, corresponding to an activ- ity loss of 11.9%. This loss of activity compares favorably with that of γ -Ga2O3, which exhibited poor aging properties in terms of a
26.9% loss from the initial steady conversion of 41.3 to 30.2% after
completing the cycling process.
Given the thermally metastable nature of the γ -type gallium oxide materials [32,34,48], to gain further insight into the affect of repeated regeneration on the phase structure in relation to the catalytic behavior of the mixed Ga2O3Al2O3 oxides, the phase structure of the twice-regenerated catalysts (Fig. 9) was evaluated by XRD, as shown in Fig. 10. For the γ -Ga2O3 sample, the major Fig. 10. Powder XRD patterns of GaxAl10xO15 catalysts after three-cycle deactivation and regeneration: (a) Ga2O3; (b) Ga8Al2O15; (c) Ga5Al5O15. 300

phase after repeated regeneration was confirmed to be β-Ga2O3,which is the only stable form of Ga2O3 known [32,34,48]. Along with such significant phase transformation, the BET surface area of the γ -Ga2O3 sample also dropped dramatically to 58 m2 g1 (as shown in Table 1), which may explain the poor performance of the simple oxide of γ -Ga2O3 after repeated regeneration cycles. It is noteworthy that for GaxAl10xO15, no significant differences were seen in the diffraction patterns obtained before (Figs. 1b, 1c) and after (Figs. 10b, 10c) the repeated regeneration, demonstrating the improved thermal stability achievable over the mixed Ga2O3Al2O3 oxide materials. The maintenance of the γ -phase of the solid solu- tion materials on repeated thermal treatment is further supported by the N2 adsorption data given in Table 1. Although repeated re- generation led to a general decrease in the specific surface area,higher surface areas (>100 m2 g1) were always found for the mixed-oxide materials. Similar improved thermal stability was re- ported by Horiuchi et al. for aluminagallia aerogel materials [49].
Thus, it can be concluded that the remarkable heat-tolerant nature of the Ga2O3Al2O3 materials with favorable surface and textural properties is responsible for these materials superior activity and stability in propane dehydrogenation.
4. Conclusion
The present work studied the catalytic dehydrogenation of propane in the presence or absence of CO2 over a series of GaxAl10xO15 mixed oxides. Among the various compositions of GaxAl10xO15, the maximum initial activity and propylene yield were observed at x = 8. The most interesting finding of this study is the significantly enhanced stability at high conversion levels for Ga5Al5O15. The enhanced catalytic activity of GaxAl10xO15 mixed oxides can be linked to the abundant specific surface acid sites re- lated to tetrahedral surface Ga3+ sites resulting from the formation of Ga2O3Al2O3 solid solution in the mixed-oxide systems. Com- paring the NH3-TPD results and propane dehydrogenation activity reveals that weak surface acidity (specifically, the weak Lewis acid site density of the surface), not medium-strong surface acidity, is important for achieving high activity and stability.
