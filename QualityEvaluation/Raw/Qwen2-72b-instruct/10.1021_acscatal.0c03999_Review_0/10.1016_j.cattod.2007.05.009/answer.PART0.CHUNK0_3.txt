[1] "In steam cracking, ethylene is the preferred product, but the demand for propylene is growing faster than that for ethylene, especially in Western Europe [1]. Also, in the case of FCC, smaller amounts of propylene are produced."
[2] "Dehydrogenations thermodynamic constraints limit alkane conversion; furthermore, a major problem is coking, which causes rapid catalyst deactivation."
[3] "Therefore, the need exists for new technologies devoted to the production of specific olefins, which have none of the disadvantages characterizing dehydrogenation."
[4] "In fact, the production of chemicals starting from alkanes by means of oxidative processes has been one of the most studied topics in recent decades."
[5] "The effectiveness of the catalyst, that is the activity for alkane conversion and the selectivity to desired products, will ultimately determine the economic attractiveness of an alkane-based chemical process."
[6] "The successful commercial technologies will be those that link catalyst performance characteristics with innovative process designs."
[7] "However, in the case of alkenes produced from alkanes, the lower cost of the feedstock is not a real incentive, since current commercial technologies for olefin production already use fuel-grade feedstocks."
[8] "In this case, conversely, the improved energy efficiency (ODH is exothermal, while dehydrogenation and cracking are endothermal), and process simplicity are effective incentives."
[9] "This implies that while in the production of, say, acrylonitrile from propane a yield of 60% is sufficient to obtain a cost equivalency with the current technology from propylene (due to the difference in cost between propane and propylene), in the case of propylene synthesis by propane ODH, better olefin yields are needed than those obtained with current technologies."
[10] "Furthermore, Lange [3] underlined that more exothermal reactions imply higher energy losses (i.e., the difference between the combustion heat of feed and that of the product) and, hence, higher fixed costs, especially if the production of CO2, the main by-product in alkane ODH, is taken into account."

1.The primary challenges in current propylene production methods, such as steam cracking and fluid-catalytic-cracking (FCC), include the preference for ethylene production over propylene, especially in Western Europe, and the lower yield of propylene in FCC. Dehydrogenation processes are limited by thermodynamic constraints and suffer from rapid catalyst deactivation due to coking. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by offering a new technology for the production of specific olefins without the disadvantages of dehydrogenation. The effectiveness of the catalyst in ODHP, including its activity for alkane conversion and selectivity to desired products, is crucial for the economic attractiveness of the process. The improved energy efficiency of ODHP, as it is exothermal compared to the endothermal nature of dehydrogenation and cracking, and the simplicity of the process are significant advantages. However, the lower cost of feedstock in ODHP is not a real incentive since current commercial technologies already use fuel-grade feedstocks. To compete with current technologies, ODHP must achieve better olefin yields. The use of oxygen as an oxidant in ODHP leads to higher energy losses and higher fixed costs, particularly when considering the production of CO2 as a by-product.

1.当前丙烯生产方法的主要挑战，如蒸汽裂解和流体催化裂解（FCC），包括在西欧等地区，乙烯生产优先于丙烯，以及FCC中丙烯产量较低。脱氢过程受到热力学约束的限制，并且由于积碳导致催化剂快速失活。丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）通过提供一种没有脱氢缺点的生产特定烯烃的新技术来解决这些问题。在ODHP中，催化剂的有效性，包括其对烷烃转化的活性和对所需产品的选择性，对于过程的经济吸引力至关重要。ODHP的改进能源效率，因为它与脱氢和裂解的吸热性质相比是放热的，以及过程的简单性是重要的优势。然而，ODHP中原料的较低成本并不是真正的激励，因为当前的商业技术已经使用燃料级原料。为了与当前技术竞争，ODHP必须实现更好的烯烃产量。在ODHP中使用氧气作为氧化剂会导致更高的能源损失和更高的固定成本，特别是在考虑二氧化碳作为副产品生产的情况下。
