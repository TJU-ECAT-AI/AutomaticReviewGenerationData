[1] "In steam cracking, ethylene is the preferred product, but the demand for propylene is growing faster than that for ethylene, especially in Western Europe [1]. Also, in the case of FCC, smaller amounts of propylene are produced."
[2] "Dehydrogenations thermodynamic constraints limit alkane conversion; furthermore, a major problem is coking, which causes rapid catalyst deactivation."
[3] "Therefore, the need exists for new technologies devoted to the production of specific olefins, which have none of the disadvantages characterizing dehydrogenation."
[4] "In fact, the production of chemicals starting from alkanes by means of oxidative processes has been one of the most studied topics in recent decades."
[5] "The successful commercial technologies will be those that link catalyst performance characteristics with innovative process designs."
[6] "However, in the case of alkenes produced from alkanes, the lower cost of the feedstock is not a real incentive, since current commercial technologies for olefin production already use fuel-grade feedstocks."
[7] "In this case, conversely, the improved energy efficiency (ODH is exothermal, while dehydrogenation and cracking are endothermal), and process simplicity are effective incentives."
[8] "Furthermore, Lange [3] underlined that more exothermal reactions imply higher energy losses (i.e., the difference between the combustion heat of feed and that of the product) and, hence, higher fixed costs, especially if the production of CO2, the main by-product in alkane ODH, is taken into account."

1.The primary challenges in current propylene production methods, such as steam cracking and fluid-catalytic-cracking (FCC), include the preference for ethylene production over propylene, especially in Western Europe, and the lower production of propylene in FCC. Dehydrogenation processes are limited by thermodynamic constraints and suffer from rapid catalyst deactivation due to coking. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by offering a route to produce specific olefins without the disadvantages of traditional dehydrogenation processes. The production of chemicals from alkanes through oxidative processes has been extensively studied. Successful commercial technologies will combine catalyst performance with innovative process designs. However, the lower cost of feedstock for alkane-based processes is not a significant incentive, as current olefin production technologies already use fuel-grade feedstocks. The advantages of ODHP include improved energy efficiency (as ODH is exothermal, unlike endothermal dehydrogenation and cracking) and process simplicity. The selection of oxidants in ODHP is crucial, with oxygen being a common choice. However, the use of oxygen presents challenges, including higher energy losses due to the exothermal nature of the reaction and higher fixed costs, particularly when considering the production of CO2, a main by-product of alkane ODH.

1.当前丙烯生产方法的主要挑战，如蒸汽裂解和流化催化裂化（FCC），包括在西欧等地，乙烯生产优先于丙烯，以及FCC中丙烯产量较低。脱氢过程受到热力学约束的限制，并且由于积碳导致催化剂快速失活。丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）通过提供一条生产特定烯烃的途径，解决了这些问题，而没有传统脱氢过程的缺点。从烷烃生产化学品的氧化过程已经得到了广泛的研究。成功的商业技术将结合催化剂性能与创新的工艺设计。然而，烷烃基过程的原料成本较低并不是一个重要的激励因素，因为当前的烯烃生产技术已经使用燃料级原料。ODHP的优势包括提高能源效率（因为ODH是放热的，而脱氢和裂解是吸热的）和工艺的简单性。在ODHP中选择氧化剂是至关重要的，氧气是一个常见的选择。然而，使用氧气带来了挑战，包括由于反应的放热性质导致的更高能量损失和更高的固定成本，特别是在考虑CO2的生产时，CO2是烷烃ODH的主要副产品。
