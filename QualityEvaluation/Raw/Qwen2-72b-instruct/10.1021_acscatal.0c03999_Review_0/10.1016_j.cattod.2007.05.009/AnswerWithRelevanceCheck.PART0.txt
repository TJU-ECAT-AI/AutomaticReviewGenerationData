          [1] "In steam cracking, ethylene is the preferred product, but the demand for propylene is growing faster than that for ethylene, especially in Western Europe [1]. Also, in the case of FCC, smaller amounts of propylene are produced."
          [2] "Dehydrogenations thermodynamic constraints limit alkane conversion; furthermore, a major problem is coking, which causes rapid catalyst deactivation."
          [3] "Therefore, the need exists for new technologies devoted to the production of specific olefins, which have none of the disadvantages characterizing dehydrogenation."
          [4] "In fact, the production of chemicals starting from alkanes by means of oxidative processes has been one of the most studied topics in recent decades."
          [5] "The effectiveness of the catalyst, that is the activity for alkane conversion and the selectivity to desired products, will ultimately determine the economic attractiveness of an alkane-based chemical process."
          [6] "The successful commercial technologies will be those that link catalyst performance characteristics with innovative process designs."
          [7] "However, in the case of alkenes produced from alkanes, the lower cost of the feedstock is not a real incentive, since current commercial technologies for olefin production already use fuel-grade feedstocks."
          [8] "In this case, conversely, the improved energy efficiency (ODH is exothermal, while dehydrogenation and cracking are endothermal), and process simplicity are effective incentives."
          [9] "A large number of reviews dealing with the ODH of light alkanes have been published since the early 1990s [421]."
          [10] "In the present review, we attempt to offer an answer to the following questions on the scientific and technological aspects of ethane and propane ODH: Which key factors are the chief determinants of the performance of metal oxide-based catalysts?"
          [11] "Have research efforts led to catalysts that can oxidize alkanes to olefins with yields comparable to those obtained with current technologies for alkenes production?"
          [12] "Does the use of either peculiar reactor configurations (e.g.,membrane-type reactors) or non-conventional methods for the conduction of reactions (e.g., cyclic feeding of reactants) make it possible to improve performances as compared to the traditional configurations?"
          [13] "Furthermore, Lange [3] underlined that more exothermal reactions imply higher energy losses (i.e., the difference between the combustion heat of feed and that of the product) and, hence, higher fixed costs, especially if the production of CO2, the main by-product in alkane ODH, is taken into account."

          The primary challenges in current propylene production methods, such as steam cracking and fluid-catalytic-cracking (FCC), include the mismatch between the growing demand for propylene, especially in Western Europe, and the production capacity that favors ethylene over propylene. Additionally, dehydrogenation processes are limited by thermodynamic constraints that restrict alkane conversion, and coking can cause rapid catalyst deactivation. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by offering a route to produce propylene directly from propane, which can potentially match the market demand more closely. The process is exothermal, which improves energy efficiency compared to endothermal dehydrogenation and cracking processes. However, ODHP also presents its own set of advantages and limitations. The use of oxygen as an oxidant in ODHP can lead to higher energy losses due to the difference in combustion heat between the feed and the product, resulting in higher fixed costs. Moreover, the production of CO2, a main by-product in alkane ODH, adds to the environmental and economic considerations.

          当前丙烯生产方法的主要挑战，如蒸汽裂解和流化催化裂化（FCC），包括丙烯需求，特别是在西欧，与生产能力倾向于生产乙烯而非丙烯之间的不匹配。此外，脱氢过程受到热力学约束的限制，限制了烷烃的转化，而焦化可能会导致催化剂迅速失活。丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）通过直接从丙烷生产丙烯的途径解决了这些问题，这可能更紧密地匹配市场需求。该过程是放热的，与吸热的脱氢和裂解过程相比，提高了能源效率。然而，ODHP也有一系列优势和局限性。在ODHP中使用氧气作为氧化剂会导致由于进料和产品之间的燃烧热差异导致更高的能量损失，从而导致更高的固定成本。此外，CO2，烷烃ODH的主要副产品，的生产增加了环境和经济考虑。
