[1] "In steam cracking, ethylene is the preferred product, but the demand for propylene is growing faster than that for ethylene, especially in Western Europe [1]. Also, in the case of FCC, smaller amounts of propylene are produced."
[2] "Dehydrogenations thermodynamic constraints limit alkane conversion; furthermore, a major problem is coking, which causes rapid catalyst deactivation."
[3] "Therefore, the need exists for new technologies devoted to the production of specific olefins, which have none of the disadvantages characterizing dehydrogenation."
[4] "In fact, the production of chemicals starting from alkanes by means of oxidative processes has been one of the most studied topics in recent decades."
[5] "The effectiveness of the catalyst, that is the activity for alkane conversion and the selectivity to desired products, will ultimately determine the economic attractiveness of an alkane-based chemical process."
[6] "The successful commercial technologies will be those that link catalyst performance characteristics with innovative process designs."
[7] "However, in the case of alkenes produced from alkanes, the lower cost of the feedstock is not a real incentive, since current commercial technologies for olefin production already use fuel-grade feedstocks."
[8] "In this case, conversely, the improved energy efficiency (ODH is exothermal, while dehydrogenation and cracking are endothermal), and process simplicity are effective incentives."
[9] "A large number of reviews dealing with the ODH of light alkanes have been published since the early 1990s [421]."
[10] "In the present review, we attempt to offer an answer to the following questions on the scientific and technological aspects of ethane and propane ODH: Which key factors are the chief determinants of the performance of metal oxide-based catalysts?"
[11] "Have research efforts led to catalysts that can oxidize alkanes to olefins with yields comparable to those obtained with current technologies for alkenes production?"
[12] "Does the use of either peculiar reactor configurations (e.g.,membrane-type reactors) or non-conventional methods for the conduction of reactions (e.g., cyclic feeding of reactants) make it possible to improve performances as compared to the traditional configurations?"
[13] "Furthermore, Lange [3] underlined that more exothermal reactions imply higher energy losses (i.e., the difference between the combustion heat of feed and that of the product) and, hence, higher fixed costs, especially if the production of CO2, the main by-product in alkane ODH, is taken into account."

1.Current methods of propylene production, such as steam cracking and fluid-catalytic-cracking (FCC), face challenges. Steam cracking primarily produces ethylene, while the demand for propylene is growing faster, especially in Western Europe. FCC produces smaller amounts of propylene. Dehydrogenation is limited by thermodynamic constraints and faces issues with coking, leading to rapid catalyst deactivation. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by offering a new technology for the production of specific olefins without the disadvantages of dehydrogenation. The production of chemicals from alkanes through oxidative processes has been a major focus of research in recent decades. The effectiveness of the catalyst, including its activity for alkane conversion and selectivity to desired products, is crucial for the economic viability of an alkane-based chemical process. Successful commercial technologies will combine catalyst performance with innovative process designs. For alkenes produced from alkanes, the lower cost of the feedstock is not a significant incentive, as current technologies already use fuel-grade feedstocks. However, improved energy efficiency and process simplicity are incentives for ODHP, as it is exothermal, unlike endothermal dehydrogenation and cracking. Many reviews on the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of light alkanes have been published since the early 1990s. Research has focused on identifying the key factors determining the performance of metal oxide-based catalysts, developing catalysts that can oxidize alkanes to olefins with yields comparable to current technologies, and exploring the potential of unconventional reactor configurations or reaction methods to improve performance. However, more exothermal reactions, such as ODHP, result in higher energy losses and higher fixed costs, especially when considering the production of CO2, a main by-product of alkane ODH.

1.当前丙烯生产方法，如蒸汽裂解和流化催化裂化（FCC），面临挑战。蒸汽裂解主要生产乙烯，而丙烯的需求增长更快，尤其是在西欧。FCC产生的丙烯量较小。脱氢反应受到热力学约束的限制，并且面临焦化问题，导致催化剂迅速失活。丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）通过提供一种没有脱氢反应缺点的新技术来解决这些问题，用于生产特定的烯烃。从烷烃生产化学品的氧化过程在近几十年来一直是研究的重点。催化剂的有效性，包括其对烷烃转化的活性和对所需产品的选择性，对于基于烷烃的化学过程的经济可行性至关重要。成功的商业技术将结合催化剂性能与创新的工艺设计。对于从烷烃生产的烯烃，原料成本较低并不是一个重要的激励因素，因为当前技术已经使用燃料级原料。然而，提高能源效率和简化工艺是ODHP的激励因素，因为它是一种放热反应，与吸热的脱氢和裂解反应不同。自20世纪90年代初以来，已经发表了大量关于轻烷烃氧化脱氢（ODH）的综述。研究集中在确定金属氧化物基催化剂性能的关键因素，开发可以将烷烃氧化为烯烃且产率与当前技术相当的催化剂，以及探索非常规反应器配置或反应方法的潜力以提高性能。然而，更放热的反应，如ODHP，会导致更高的能量损失和更高的固定成本，尤其是在考虑CO2的生产时，CO2是烷烃ODH的主要副产品。
