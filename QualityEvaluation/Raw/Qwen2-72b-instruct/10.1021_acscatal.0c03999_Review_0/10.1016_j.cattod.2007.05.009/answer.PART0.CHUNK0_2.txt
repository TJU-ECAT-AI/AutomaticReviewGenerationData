[1] "In steam cracking, ethylene is the preferred product, but the demand for propylene is growing faster than that for ethylene, especially in Western Europe [1]. Also, in the case of FCC, smaller amounts of propylene are produced."
[2] "Dehydrogenations thermodynamic constraints limit alkane conversion; furthermore, a major problem is coking, which causes rapid catalyst deactivation."
[3] "Therefore, the need exists for new technologies devoted to the production of specific olefins, which have none of the disadvantages characterizing dehydrogenation."
[4] "In fact, the production of chemicals starting from alkanes by means of oxidative processes has been one of the most studied topics in recent decades."
[5] "The successful commercial technologies will be those that link catalyst performance characteristics with innovative process designs."
[6] "However, in the case of alkenes produced from alkanes, the lower cost of the feedstock is not a real incentive, since current commercial technologies for olefin production already use fuel-grade feedstocks."
[7] "In this case, conversely, the improved energy efficiency (ODH is exothermal, while dehydrogenation and cracking are endothermal), and process simplicity are effective incentives."
[8] "Furthermore, Lange [3] underlined that more exothermal reactions imply higher energy losses (i.e., the difference between the combustion heat of feed and that of the product) and, hence, higher fixed costs, especially if the production of CO2, the main by-product in alkane ODH, is taken into account."

1.The primary challenges in current propylene production methods, such as steam cracking and fluid-catalytic-cracking (FCC), include the mismatch between the growing demand for propylene, especially in Western Europe, and the production of smaller amounts of propylene compared to ethylene. Additionally, dehydrogenation processes are limited by thermodynamic constraints and suffer from rapid catalyst deactivation due to coking. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by offering a route to produce propylene without the disadvantages of traditional dehydrogenation processes. The use of oxidative processes for alkane conversion has been extensively studied. Successful commercial technologies will require a combination of catalyst performance and innovative process designs. However, the lower cost of feedstock in ODHP is not a significant incentive, as current olefin production technologies already use fuel-grade feedstocks. Instead, the improved energy efficiency and process simplicity of ODHP, as an exothermal process, are attractive incentives. The selection of oxidants in ODHP is critical, with oxygen being a common choice. However, the use of oxygen presents challenges, including higher energy losses and increased fixed costs due to the production of CO2, the main by-product in alkane ODH.

1.当前丙烯生产方法的主要挑战，如蒸汽裂解和流化催化裂化（FCC），包括丙烯需求，特别是在西欧，与乙烯相比，丙烯的产量较小之间的不匹配。此外，脱氢过程受到热力学约束的限制，并且由于积碳导致催化剂快速失活。丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）通过提供一条生产丙烯的途径，解决了这些问题，而没有传统脱氢过程的缺点。使用氧化过程进行烷烃转化已经得到了广泛的研究。成功的商业技术将需要催化剂性能和创新工艺设计的结合。然而，ODHP中原料成本较低并不是一个重要的激励因素，因为当前的烯烃生产技术已经使用燃料级原料。相反，ODHP作为放热过程，其改进的能量效率和工艺简单性是吸引人的激励。在ODHP中选择氧化剂是关键的，氧气是一个常见的选择。然而，使用氧气带来了挑战，包括更高的能量损失和由于CO2的产生而增加的固定成本，CO2是烷烃ODH的主要副产品。
