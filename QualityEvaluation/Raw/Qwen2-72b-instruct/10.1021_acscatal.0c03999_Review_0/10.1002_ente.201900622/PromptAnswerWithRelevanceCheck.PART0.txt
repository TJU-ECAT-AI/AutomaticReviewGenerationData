1.The primary challenges in current propylene production methods, such as steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking, are their high energy consumption and the requirement for large-scale centralized plants, which limits the utilization of natural gas reserves in remote areas. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by offering a potentially more energy-efficient and decentralized process. However, ODHP presents its own set of advantages and limitations, particularly in the context of oxidant selection. Using oxygen as an oxidant can lead to side reactions such as cracking and combustion, which can limit the selectivity to propylene. The specific challenges associated with using oxygen include the need for catalysts that can control the reactivity and selectivity towards propylene while minimizing the formation of byproducts.

1.当前丙烯生产方法，如蒸汽裂解和流化催化裂解，主要挑战在于高能耗和对大型集中化工厂的需求，这限制了偏远地区天然气储量的利用。丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)通过提供可能更节能和分散化的工艺来解决这些问题。然而，ODHP有其自身的一系列优势和局限性，特别是在氧化剂选择的背景下。使用氧气作为氧化剂会导致裂解和燃烧等副反应，这会限制丙烯的选择性。使用氧气的具体挑战包括需要催化剂来控制反应性和选择性，以向丙烯倾斜，同时尽量减少副产品的形成。

1.The primary challenges in current propylene production methods, such as steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking, are their high energy consumption and the requirement for large-scale centralized plants, which limits their economic feasibility for natural gas reserves in remote areas. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by offering a potentially more energy-efficient and decentralized process for propylene production. However, ODHP presents its own set of advantages and limitations, particularly in the context of oxidant selection. Using oxygen as an oxidant can lead to side reactions such as cracking and combustion, which can limit the selectivity and yield of propylene. The literature does not specifically address the challenges associated with using oxygen in ODHP, but it does highlight the importance of controlling selectivity in alkane oxychlorination reactions, which can be similarly challenging due to the weaker CH and CC bonds in propane and butane compared to ethane.

1.当前丙烯生产方法的主要挑战,如蒸汽裂解和流化催化裂解,是其高能耗和对大规模集中化工厂的需求,这限制了其对偏远地区天然气储备的经济可行性。丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)通过提供一种潜在上更节能和分散化的丙烯生产工艺来解决这些问题。然而,ODHP有其自身的一系列优势和局限性,特别是在氧化剂选择的背景下。使用氧气作为氧化剂可能导致裂解和燃烧等副反应,这会限制丙烯的选择性和产量。文献没有具体讨论在ODHP中使用氧气的挑战,但它确实强调了在烷氧氯化反应中控制选择性的重要性,这同样具有挑战性,因为丙烷和丁烷中的CH和CC键比乙烷中的键弱。

1.The primary challenges in current propylene production methods, such as steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking, are their high energy consumption and the requirement for large-scale centralized plants, which limits the use of natural gas reserves in remote areas due to high shipping costs. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by offering a potentially more energy-efficient and decentralized process for propylene production. However, ODHP presents its own set of advantages and limitations, particularly in the context of oxidant selection. Using oxygen as an oxidant can lead to side cracking and combustion pathways, resulting in lower yields of propylene. The weaker CH and CC bonds in propane compared to ethane make selectivity control a greater challenge in ODHP.
