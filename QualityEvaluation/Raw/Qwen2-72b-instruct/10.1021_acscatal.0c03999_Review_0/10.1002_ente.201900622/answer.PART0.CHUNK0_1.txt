1.The primary challenges in current propylene production methods, such as steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking, are their high energy consumption and the requirement for large-scale centralized plants, which limits the utilization of natural gas reserves in remote areas. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by offering a potentially more energy-efficient and decentralized process. However, ODHP presents its own set of advantages and limitations, particularly in the context of oxidant selection. Using oxygen as an oxidant can lead to side reactions such as cracking and combustion, which can limit the selectivity to propylene. The specific challenges associated with using oxygen include the need for catalysts that can efficiently activate propane under mild conditions while suppressing over-oxidation and side reactions.

1.当前丙烯生产方法的主要挑战，如蒸汽裂解和流化催化裂解，是其高能耗和对大型集中化工厂的需求，这限制了对偏远地区天然气储备的利用。丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)通过提供可能更节能和分散化的工艺解决了这些问题。然而，ODHP有其自身的一系列优势和局限性，特别是在氧化剂选择的背景下。使用氧气作为氧化剂会导致裂解和燃烧等副反应，这会限制丙烯的选择性。使用氧气的具体挑战包括需要催化剂在温和条件下有效激活丙烷，同时抑制过度氧化和副反应。
