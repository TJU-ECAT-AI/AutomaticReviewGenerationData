1.The primary challenges in current propylene production methods, such as steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking, include high energy consumption, low selectivity towards propylene, and reliance on dwindling petroleum reserves. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by offering a more energy-efficient process with higher selectivity for propylene production. However, ODHP presents its own set of advantages and limitations, particularly in the context of oxidant selection. Using oxygen as an oxidant can lead to overoxidation and the formation of undesired carbon oxides, while using molecular oxygen can result in higher selectivity but also higher costs. The specific challenges associated with using oxygen include the need for oxygen separation from air, which can be energy-intensive, and the risk of overoxidation, which can reduce the yield of propylene.

1.当前丙烯生产方法，如蒸汽裂解和流化催化裂解，主要面临高能耗、丙烯选择性低以及对日益减少的石油储备的依赖等问题。丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)通过提供更节能的工艺和更高的丙烯生产选择性来解决这些问题。然而，ODHP也有其自身的优势和局限性，特别是在氧化剂选择方面。使用氧气作为氧化剂可能导致过度氧化和不希望的碳氧化物的形成，而使用分子氧虽然可以提高选择性，但成本也更高。使用氧气的具体挑战包括需要从空气中分离氧气，这可能消耗大量能源，以及过度氧化的风险，这会降低丙烯的产量。

1.The primary challenges in current propylene production methods, such as steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking, include high energy consumption, low selectivity towards propylene, and reliance on dwindling petroleum reserves. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by offering a more energy-efficient and selective route for propylene production. The use of oxygen as an oxidant in ODHP presents its own set of advantages and limitations. Oxygen is a cheap and abundant oxidant, but its use can lead to overoxidation and the formation of undesired byproducts such as carbon oxides. The presence of oxygen can also cause hotspots in the catalyst bed, leading to temperature control issues. To mitigate these challenges, the development of suitable catalysts and reactor designs is crucial for the successful implementation of ODHP.
