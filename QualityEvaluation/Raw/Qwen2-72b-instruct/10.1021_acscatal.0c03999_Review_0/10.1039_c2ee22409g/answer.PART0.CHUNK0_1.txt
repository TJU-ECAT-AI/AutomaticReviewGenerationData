1.The primary challenges in current propylene production methods, such as steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking, include high energy consumption, high operating temperatures, and the production of byproducts that decrease propylene yield. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by offering a potentially more energy-efficient route to propylene, as the reaction is exothermic and avoids the thermodynamic constraints of non-oxidative routes by forming water as a byproduct. The use of carbon dioxide as an oxidant in ODHP can further reduce energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions compared to traditional steam cracking methods. However, the selection of oxidant in ODHP presents its own set of challenges. Oxygen can lead to significant loss of propylene selectivity due to the over-oxidation of propane to carbon dioxide. Carbon dioxide, on the other hand, can poison the centers responsible for propane activation, decreasing conversion. The challenge is to find a balance that maximizes propylene yield while minimizing byproduct formation and energy consumption.

1.当前丙烯生产方法的主要挑战包括高能耗、高操作温度以及副产品的产生，这会降低丙烯的产量。丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)通过提供一条潜在的更节能的丙烯生产途径来解决这些问题，因为该反应是放热的，通过形成水作为副产品避免了非氧化途径的热力学限制。在ODHP中使用二氧化碳作为氧化剂可以进一步降低能耗和温室气体排放，与传统的蒸汽裂解方法相比。然而，ODHP中氧化剂的选择带来了自己的挑战。氧气会导致丙烯选择性显著降低，因为丙烷过度氧化为二氧化碳。另一方面，二氧化碳会毒害负责丙烷活化的中心，降低转化率。挑战在于找到平衡，最大化丙烯产量，同时最小化副产品形成和能耗。
