1.The primary challenges in current propylene production methods, such as steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking, include high energy consumption, high capital costs, and the production of byproducts that reduce the overall yield of propylene. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by offering a more energy-efficient and selective process for propylene production. However, ODHP presents its own set of challenges, particularly in the selection of an appropriate oxidant. Oxygen is a strong oxidant that can lead to over-oxidation and the formation of undesired byproducts, such as carbon dioxide and water. Carbon dioxide, on the other hand, is a milder oxidant that can promote selective dehydrogenation, but its low reactivity requires the use of specific catalysts to activate it. The choice of oxidant is crucial in determining the selectivity and yield of propylene in ODHP processes.

1.当前丙烯生产方法，如蒸汽裂解和流化催化裂化，主要面临高能耗、高资本成本和副产品生成导致丙烯总产量降低等挑战。丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)通过提供更节能、更选择性的丙烯生产过程来解决这些问题。然而，ODHP在选择合适的氧化剂方面存在其自身的挑战，尤其是氧气作为强氧化剂可能导致过度氧化和二氧化碳、水等不期望副产品的形成。另一方面，二氧化碳是一种较温和的氧化剂，可以促进选择性脱氢，但其低反应性需要使用特定催化剂来激活。氧化剂的选择对于确定ODHP过程中丙烯的选择性和产量至关重要。
