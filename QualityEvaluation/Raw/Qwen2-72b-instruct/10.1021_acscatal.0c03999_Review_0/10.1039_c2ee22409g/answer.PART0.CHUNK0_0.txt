1.The primary challenges in current propylene production methods, such as steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking, include high energy consumption, high capital costs, and the production of by-products that reduce the overall yield of propylene. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by offering a more energy-efficient and selective process for propylene production. However, ODHP presents its own set of challenges, particularly in the selection of an appropriate oxidant. Oxygen is a strong oxidant that can lead to over-oxidation and the formation of undesired by-products, such as carbon dioxide and water, which can decrease the selectivity for propylene. Carbon dioxide, on the other hand, is a milder oxidant that can promote the selective dehydrogenation of propane to propylene without significant over-oxidation. However, the use of carbon dioxide as an oxidant requires the development of catalysts that can effectively activate CO2 and transfer oxygen to the propane molecule.

1.当前丙烯生产方法，如蒸汽裂解和流化催化裂化，主要面临高能耗、高资本成本以及副产品生成导致丙烯总产量降低等问题。丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)通过提供更节能、更选择性的丙烯生产过程来解决这些问题。然而，ODHP在选择合适的氧化剂方面存在其自身的挑战，尤其是氧气作为强氧化剂，可能导致过度氧化和二氧化碳、水等不期望副产品的形成，从而降低丙烯的选择性。相比之下，二氧化碳是一种较温和的氧化剂，可以促进丙烷选择性脱氢生成丙烯，而不会显著过度氧化。然而，使用二氧化碳作为氧化剂需要开发能够有效活化CO2并将氧转移到丙烷分子的催化剂。
