1.The primary challenges in current propylene production methods, such as steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking, include high energy consumption, high capital costs, and the production of by-products that reduce the overall yield of propylene. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by offering a more energy-efficient and selective process for propylene production. However, ODHP presents its own set of challenges, particularly in the selection of an appropriate oxidant. Oxygen is a strong oxidant that can lead to over-oxidation and the formation of undesired by-products, such as carbon dioxide and water, which can decrease the selectivity for propylene. Carbon dioxide, on the other hand, is a milder oxidant that can promote the selective dehydrogenation of propane to propylene without significant over-oxidation. However, the use of carbon dioxide as an oxidant requires the development of catalysts that can effectively activate CO2 and transfer oxygen to the propane molecule.

1.当前丙烯生产方法，如蒸汽裂解和流化催化裂化，主要面临高能耗、高资本成本以及副产品生成导致丙烯总产量降低等问题。丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)通过提供更节能、更选择性的丙烯生产过程来解决这些问题。然而，ODHP在选择合适的氧化剂方面存在其自身的挑战，尤其是氧气作为强氧化剂，可能导致过度氧化和二氧化碳、水等不期望副产品的形成，从而降低丙烯的选择性。相比之下，二氧化碳是一种较温和的氧化剂，可以促进丙烷选择性脱氢生成丙烯，而不会显著过度氧化。然而，使用二氧化碳作为氧化剂需要开发能够有效活化CO2并将氧转移到丙烷分子的催化剂。

1.The primary challenges in current propylene production methods, such as steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking, include high energy consumption, high operating temperatures, and the production of byproducts that decrease propylene yield. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by offering a potentially more energy-efficient route to propylene, as the reaction is exothermic and avoids the thermodynamic constraints of non-oxidative routes by forming water as a byproduct. The use of carbon dioxide as an oxidant in ODHP can further reduce energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions compared to traditional steam cracking methods. However, the selection of oxidant in ODHP presents its own set of challenges. Oxygen can lead to significant loss of propylene selectivity due to the over-oxidation of propane to carbon dioxide. Carbon dioxide, on the other hand, can poison the centers responsible for propane activation, decreasing conversion. The challenge is to find a balance that maximizes propylene yield while minimizing byproduct formation and energy consumption.

1.当前丙烯生产方法的主要挑战包括高能耗、高操作温度以及副产品的产生，这会降低丙烯的产量。丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)通过提供一条潜在的更节能的丙烯生产途径来解决这些问题，因为该反应是放热的，通过形成水作为副产品避免了非氧化途径的热力学限制。在ODHP中使用二氧化碳作为氧化剂可以进一步降低能耗和温室气体排放，与传统的蒸汽裂解方法相比。然而，ODHP中氧化剂的选择带来了自己的挑战。氧气会导致丙烯选择性显著降低，因为丙烷过度氧化为二氧化碳。另一方面，二氧化碳会毒害负责丙烷活化的中心，降低转化率。挑战在于找到平衡，最大化丙烯产量，同时最小化副产品形成和能耗。

However, the use of carbon dioxide as an oxidant can also result in lower conversion rates and may require higher temperatures and pressures to achieve comparable yields of propylene.

1.The primary challenges in current propylene production methods, such as steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking, include high energy consumption, high capital and operating costs, and environmental issues due to greenhouse gas emissions. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by offering a potentially more energy-efficient and cost-effective route to propylene. The use of carbon dioxide (CO2) as an oxidant in ODHP can further reduce costs, lower greenhouse gas emissions, and save energy compared to traditional steam cracking. However, the use of oxygen as an oxidant in ODHP presents challenges due to the over-oxidation of propane to carbon dioxide, which decreases the selectivity for propylene. The answer to this problem may be the use of CO2 as an oxidant, which avoids the over-oxidation issue and maintains high selectivity for propylene.
