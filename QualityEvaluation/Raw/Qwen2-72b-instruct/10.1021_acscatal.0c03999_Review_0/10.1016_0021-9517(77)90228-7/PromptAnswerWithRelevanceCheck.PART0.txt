Read the questions and answers provided below. First, critically assess the overall relevance of the answers provided to the set of questions asked.

If, upon your assessment, you find that the answers do not contain information that is relevant to the questions asked, stop your review process immediately and respond with a single sentence: "※※※※※※※The provided answers are not relevant to the questions.※※※※※※※". Do not provide any additional explanation or background information, only this sentence should be given as a response in case of irrelevant answers.

If, however, the answers are relevant to the questions asked, proceed to compile answers for each question according to the instructions below. Ensure to aggregate all the relevant answers from the multiple answer results provided in the document, and organize them sequentially by their order number, compiling the corresponding quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question.

If the provided answers' quotes are not differentiated by question, ensure to break them down and assign the quotes to each respective question, outputting them separately within each question's section.

To provide a comprehensive review, differentiate the responses into quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question based on the details given in the 'Answer' XML tags. Structure your review using the XML format showcased below if the answers are relevant to the questions asked:

1.The primary challenges in current propylene production methods are not explicitly stated in the literature. However, oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) is presented as an alternative method to overcome the equilibrium limitation of the dehydrogenation reaction. The use of SO2 as an oxidant in ODHP offers an advantage over conventional methods, particularly at high temperatures where there is an appreciable increase in selectivity per pass. However, the addition of SO2 to the feed increases the conversion of propane, but the selectivities to propylene are lower than those obtained with pure propane feed. The literature does not discuss the specific challenges associated with using oxygen as an oxidant in ODHP.

1.当前丙烯生产方法的主要挑战在文献中没有明确说明。然而，丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)被作为克服脱氢反应平衡限制的替代方法提出。在ODHP中使用SO2作为氧化剂与传统方法相比，特别是在高温下，每通过一次的选择性有显著增加，具有优势。然而，向进料中添加SO2虽然增加了丙烷的转化率，但丙烯的选择性低于仅使用丙烷进料时获得的选择性。文献没有讨论在ODHP中使用氧气作为氧化剂的具体挑战。
