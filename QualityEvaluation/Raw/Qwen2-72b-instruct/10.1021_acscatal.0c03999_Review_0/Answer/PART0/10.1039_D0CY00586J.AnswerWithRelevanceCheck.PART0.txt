          [1] "Propane direct dehydrogenation (DH) as well as oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) have attracted worldwide academic and industrial interests, but both suffer from limitations that have been reviewed extensively elsewhere1-3."
          [2] "Propane DH is an endothermic reaction and thus high temperatures are required to achieve acceptable olefin yields."
          [3] "The CATOFIN dehydrogenation process4-5 provides 850000 MTA (million metric tons annually) of propylene with minimum of 99.5% purity and is based on chromium oxide supported on activated alumina."
          [4] "The Oleflex dehydrogenation process4-5 relies on the traditional Pt/Sn catalytic system to produce polymer grade propylene."
          [5] "The high operating temperature as well as the cost of the Pt catalysts comprise the main drawbacks."
          [6] "In addition,the reaction is usually accompanied by catalyst deactivation due to coke formation and spatial separation of Pt-Sn species thus highlighting the stability of catalysts used among the major botlenecks6-7."
          [7] "On the other hand, although the exothermic character of propane ODH with O2 has the potential to significantly reduce the reaction temperature, the fate of the desired propylene is difficult to be controlled due to unavoidable combustion of propane as well as of propylene to carbon monoxide and/or dioxide thus significantly lowering propylene selectivity."
          [8] "The use of CO2 as, alternative to oxygen, soft oxidant has the potential to i) avoid deep oxidation of alkanes/alkenes, ii) reduce coke formation and iii) favor propane conversion due to participation of the produced hydrogen in the reverse water- gas shift reaction (RWGS)."

          Current propylene production methods, such as fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) and steam cracking, have limitations, including high operating temperatures, high costs of precious metal catalysts, and catalyst deactivation due to coke formation and spatial separation of active species. Propane oxidative dehydrogenation (ODHP) addresses these issues by potentially reducing the reaction temperature due to its exothermic nature. However, ODHP presents its own set of challenges, particularly in controlling the fate of propylene due to the risk of overoxidation to carbon monoxide and dioxide, which significantly lowers propylene selectivity. The selection of oxidant is crucial, with carbon dioxide (CO2) being a preferred alternative to oxygen due to its potential to avoid deep oxidation, reduce coke formation, and favor propane conversion.

          当前的丙烯生产方法，如流化催化裂化（FCC）和蒸汽裂解，存在局限性，包括高温操作、贵金属催化剂的高成本以及由于焦炭形成和活性物种的空间分离导致的催化剂失活。丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）通过其放热性质潜在地降低了反应温度，从而解决了这些问题。然而，ODHP本身也存在一系列挑战，特别是在控制丙烯的命运方面，由于丙烷和丙烯不可避免地氧化为一氧化碳和二氧化碳，这大大降低了丙烯的选择性。氧化剂的选择至关重要，二氧化碳（CO2）作为氧气的优选替代品，具有避免深度氧化、减少焦炭形成和有利于丙烷转化的潜力。
