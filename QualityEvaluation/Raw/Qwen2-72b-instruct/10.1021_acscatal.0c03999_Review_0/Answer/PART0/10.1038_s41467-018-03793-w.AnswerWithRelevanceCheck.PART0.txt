          [1] "The co-production of propylene from steam and fluidized crackers is anticipated to be insufficient to satisfy the rapidly growing demand1. Consequently, there is a need for the development of economic on-purpose production techniques to produce additional propylene."
          [2] "The direct dehydrogenation of propane (DDP) is ther- modynamically limited and is highly endothermic (ΔHr = 29.70 kcal/mol), requiring temperatures that may exceed 973 K for sig- nificant propylene yields2."
          [3] "In principle, the introduction of CO2 as a mild oxidant into the feed alters the dehydrogenation pathway by oxidizing the abstracted hydrogen from the alkane and conse- quently releasing the heat of reaction that reduces operating temperatures2,3."
          [4] "The presence of CO2 can also increase the equili- brium conversion of propane by consuming H2 through the reverse water gas shift reaction (RWGS), as seen in the thermo- dynamic calculations in Fig. 1a."
          [5] "Additionally, unlike regular oxi- dative dehydrogenation with molecular oxygen, CO2 as a mild oxidant suppresses over-oxidation and thus minimizes the pro- duction of carbon oxides."

          Current propylene production methods, primarily through steam and fluidized crackers, are expected to be insufficient to meet the rapidly growing demand for propylene. This necessitates the development of more economic and purposeful production techniques. Direct dehydrogenation of propane (DDP) is thermodynamically limited and highly endothermic, requiring temperatures that may exceed 973 K for significant propylene yields. The introduction of CO2 as a mild oxidant in the feedstock can alter the dehydrogenation pathway by oxidizing the abstracted hydrogen from the alkane, releasing the heat of reaction and thus reducing operating temperatures. CO2 can also increase the equilibrium conversion of propane by consuming H2 through the reverse water gas shift reaction. Unlike regular oxidative dehydrogenation with molecular oxygen, CO2 as a mild oxidant suppresses over-oxidation, minimizing the production of carbon oxides.

          当前丙烯生产方法，主要通过蒸汽和流化裂解，预计无法满足丙烯需求的快速增长。这需要开发更经济、更有针对性的生产技术。丙烷直接脱氢（DDP）在热力学上受到限制，且高度吸热（ΔHr = 29.70 kcal/mol），需要超过973 K的温度才能获得显著的丙烯产量。原则上，将CO2作为温和氧化剂引入原料中，可以改变脱氢途径，通过氧化从烷烃中提取的氢，进而释放反应热，从而降低操作温度。CO2的存在还可以通过消耗H2来增加丙烷的平衡转化率，这在图1a的热力学计算中可以看到。此外，与常规使用分子氧的氧化脱氢不同，CO2作为温和氧化剂可以抑制过度氧化，从而最小化碳氧化物的产生。
