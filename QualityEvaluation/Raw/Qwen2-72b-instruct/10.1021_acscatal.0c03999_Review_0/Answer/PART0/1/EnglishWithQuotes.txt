Direct catalytic dehydrogenation of hydrocarbons has low conversion per pass and low yields due to equilibrium limitations. The process is endothermic and the thermodynamic equilibrium is unfavorable. Temperatures above 800 K are required for commercially feasible conversions. At these temperatures, undesirable side reactions limit the propylene yield and coke formation necessitates frequent catalyst regeneration. Catalytic oxidative dehydrogenation of propane by oxygen is an attractive alternative because it is an exothermic and nonthermodynamically limited reaction. However, the propylene selectivity of the reaction remains an unsolved problem owing to the over oxidation of propane. On the other hand, soft oxidants such as carbon dioxide appear as potential alternatives. The PDH in the presence of carbon dioxide (CO2PDH) is also of interest because it utilizes the greenhouse gas CO2. CO2 is a coke removing agent as well. The promoting effect of CO2 is explained either by consumption of the hydrogen in the reverse watergas shift reaction, which shifts the equilibrium of propane dehydrogenation to completion (twostep pathway) or its participation in direct oxidation of propane to propylene (onestep pathway).

{"Quotes": "", "English": "The primary challenges in current propylene production methods, such as steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking (FCC), include high energy demands, low selectivity towards propylene, dwindling petroleum reserves, and rising oil prices. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by offering a more economical feedstock (propane) and potentially more efficient conversion technologies. However, ODHP presents its own set of advantages and limitations, particularly in the context of oxidant selection. The use of oxygen as an oxidant risks combusting the hydrocarbon reactants and products, making it challenging to control side reactions such as cracking and excessive oxidation. Mild oxidants like CO2 are preferred as they can improve catalyst activity without the risk of over-oxidation. Oxygen is an attractive oxidant for ODHP due to its ability to lower the reaction temperature to around 400°C and make the dehydrogenation reaction exothermic. However, the use of oxygen also introduces new challenges, such as the need to avoid overoxidation of the hydrocarbons in the feed to maintain high olefin selectivity. Carbon dioxide (CO2) is another oxidant that has been investigated for ODHP. CO2 can effectively consume hydrogen under dehydrogenation conditions, but it does not provide enough heat to compensate for the endothermic nature of the dehydrogenation reaction. The cofeeding of CO2 can also result in additional coke deposition due to the increased CO and decreased H2 partial pressures brought about by the reverse water-gas shift reaction. Moreover, CO2 competitively adsorbs on the surface, specifically on the basic sites of the catalyst materials, which can negatively affect their performance.", "Doi": "10.1021/cr5002436"},
