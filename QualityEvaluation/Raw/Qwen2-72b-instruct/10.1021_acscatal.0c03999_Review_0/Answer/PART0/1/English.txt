The primary challenges in current propylene production methods, such as steam cracking and fluid-catalytic-cracking (FCC), include the mismatch between the growing demand for propylene, especially in Western Europe, and the production capacity that favors ethylene over propylene. Additionally, dehydrogenation processes are limited by thermodynamic constraints that restrict alkane conversion, and coking can cause rapid catalyst deactivation. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by offering a route to produce propylene directly from propane, which can potentially match the market demand more closely. The process is exothermal, which improves energy efficiency compared to endothermal dehydrogenation and cracking processes. However, ODHP also presents its own set of advantages and limitations. The use of oxygen as an oxidant in ODHP can lead to higher energy losses due to the difference in combustion heat between the feed and the product, resulting in higher fixed costs. Moreover, the production of CO2, a main by-product in alkane ODH, adds to the environmental and economic considerations.

Nitrous oxide (N2O) has been shown to be a promising alternative oxidant, offering higher propylene selectivity and lower catalyst deactivation rates compared to oxygen. However, the use of N2O also presents its own challenges, such as higher production costs and potential environmental concerns due to its greenhouse gas properties.

The primary challenges in current propylene production methods are not explicitly stated in the literature. However, oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) is presented as an alternative method to overcome the equilibrium limitation of the dehydrogenation reaction. The use of SO2 as an oxidant in ODHP offers an advantage over conventional methods, particularly at high temperatures where there is an appreciable increase in selectivity per pass. However, the addition of SO2 to the feed increases the conversion of propane, but the selectivities to propylene are lower than those obtained with pure propane feed. The literature does not discuss the specific challenges associated with using oxygen as an oxidant in ODHP.

Current propylene production methods, primarily through steam and fluidized crackers, are expected to be insufficient to meet the rapidly growing demand for propylene. This necessitates the development of more economic and purposeful production techniques. Direct dehydrogenation of propane (DDP) is thermodynamically limited and highly endothermic, requiring temperatures that may exceed 973 K for significant propylene yields. The introduction of CO2 as a mild oxidant in the feedstock can alter the dehydrogenation pathway by oxidizing the abstracted hydrogen from the alkane, releasing the heat of reaction and thus reducing operating temperatures. CO2 can also increase the equilibrium conversion of propane by consuming H2 through the reverse water gas shift reaction. Unlike regular oxidative dehydrogenation with molecular oxygen, CO2 as a mild oxidant suppresses over-oxidation, minimizing the production of carbon oxides.

The primary challenges in current propylene production methods, particularly through the dehydrogenation of propane, include side reactions, thermodynamic constraints on selectivity and conversion, the endothermic nature of the process requiring high energy input, and coke formation leading to catalytic deactivation. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by adding an oxidant to the reaction feed, initiating the reaction through the oxidant rather than solely relying on high temperatures. This modification can potentially overcome limitations such as endothermic nature and coke formation. However, using oxygen as an oxidant presents its own set of challenges, including the overoxidation of olefins to CO and CO2 and the possibility of reaction runaway. To mitigate these issues, catalysts have been investigated, with supported vanadium-based oxides and mixed-metal oxides being extensively studied due to their high thermal stability, large surface areas, and favorable reducibility and basicity. Despite these efforts, no catalytic system has yet achieved product yields comparable to current industrial technologies for olefin production.

ODHP presents advantages over non-oxidative propane dehydrogenation due to favorable thermodynamics, including exothermic reactions at lower temperatures, and enhanced catalyst stability by preventing coke deposition on the catalyst surface. However, ODHP also presents the challenge of preventing the over-oxidation of propene to CO and CO2, which are more thermodynamically stable.

The primary challenges in current propylene production methods, such as steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking, include high energy consumption, low selectivity towards propylene, and reliance on dwindling petroleum reserves. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by offering a more energy-efficient process with higher selectivity for propylene production. However, ODHP presents its own set of advantages and limitations, particularly in the context of oxidant selection. Using oxygen as an oxidant can lead to overoxidation and the formation of undesired carbon oxides, while using molecular oxygen can result in higher selectivity but also higher costs. The specific challenges associated with using oxygen include the need for oxygen separation from air, which can be energy-intensive, and the risk of overoxidation, which can reduce the yield of propylene.

Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by operating at lower temperatures due to the presence of oxygen, which inhibits coke formation. However, ODHP presents its own set of advantages and limitations, particularly in the context of oxidant selection. Oxygen is a preferred oxidant due to its ability to promote selectivity for propene, but the unselective combustion reactions limit alkene selectivities. The presence of oxygen can lead to the over-oxidation of propene to carbon oxides, which decreases propene yields. The use of oxygen also requires careful control of reaction conditions to prevent explosive mixtures and manage the exothermic nature of the reaction.

Oxygen is a preferred oxidant due to its ability to promote selectivity for propene, but the unselective combustion reactions limit alkene selectivities. The use of oxygen also leads to extensive selectivity losses with increasing conversion, due to propene re-adsorption and subsequent oxidation to carbon oxides, resulting in propene yields lower than 30%.

The primary challenges in current propylene production methods, such as steam cracking (SC) and fluidic catalytic cracking (FCC), include low selectivity and yields for propylene, as it is produced as a by-product. The increasing use of ethane in steam crackers has led to a decline in the propylene/ethylene production ratio, while the demand for propylene is increasing due to the expanding polypropylene market. Propane dehydrogenation is limited by thermodynamics, requiring very high reaction temperatures for high single-pass propane conversion, which complicates the separation of hydrogen and unreacted propane from propylene. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by potentially offering higher propylene yields and selectivity, but it is limited by the consecutive oxidation of propylene to oxygenated products, resulting in a maximum reported yield of about 30%. The selection of oxidants is crucial, as F2 is inappropriate due to its high reactivity and unfavorable thermodynamics, Cl2 reactions are fast and non-selective, and I2 reactions are selective but slow and only thermodynamically favorable at high temperatures. Bromine reactions with propane are more feasible, but resolving the polyhalogenation selectivity issue requires a higher propane to bromine ratio, limiting single-pass propane conversion.

The primary challenges in current propylene production methods, such as steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking, are their high energy consumption and the requirement for large-scale centralized plants, which limits the utilization of natural gas reserves in remote areas. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by offering a potentially more energy-efficient and decentralized process. However, ODHP presents its own set of advantages and limitations, particularly in the context of oxidant selection. Using oxygen as an oxidant can lead to side reactions such as cracking and combustion, which can limit the selectivity and yield of propylene. The specific challenges associated with using oxygen include the need for catalysts that can efficiently activate propane under mild conditions while suppressing over-oxidation and side reactions, control selectivity, as well as the management of the exothermic nature of the reaction to prevent overheating and ensure safety. The weaker CH and CC bonds in propane compared to ethane make selectivity control a greater challenge in ODHP.

The demand for propene is growing, and current sources such as steam cracking and catalytic cracking may not meet this demand without negatively impacting the production of other valuable co-products. Selective processes dedicated solely to propene synthesis, such as propane dehydrogenation, may gain significance. Oxidative dehydrogenation processes, including ODHP, can offer higher per-pass conversion of propane and yield of propene compared to non-oxidative dehydrogenation. The use of CO2 in the process can be an attractive way for chemical CO2 utilisation, producing hydrogen and carbon monoxide (syngas) as by-products. However, the literature does not delve into the specific challenges associated with using oxygen as an oxidant in ODHP.

The primary challenges in current propylene production methods include the difficulty in achieving both high propane conversion and high propylene selectivity simultaneously. Propylene is more susceptible to oxidation than propane, leading to a rapid decline in selectivity as conversion increases. At temperatures above 700 degrees Celsius, propane cracking becomes significant, resulting in the production of various products other than propylene. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by potentially offering higher conversion levels and selectivity to propylene compared to traditional dehydrogenation methods. However, ODHP presents its own set of challenges, particularly in maintaining selectivity as conversion increases, due to the higher reactivity of propylene compared to propane. Additionally, at higher temperatures, propane cracking becomes more significant, leading to the production of various by-products other than propylene. The selection of oxidant is also a critical factor, with oxygen presenting safety concerns and process upsets that need to be addressed.

The primary challenges in current propylene production methods, such as steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking, include high energy consumption, high capital and operating costs, environmental issues due to greenhouse gas emissions, and the production of byproducts that reduce the overall yield of propylene. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by offering a potentially more energy-efficient, cost-effective, and selective process for propylene production. The use of carbon dioxide (CO2) as an oxidant in ODHP can further reduce costs, lower greenhouse gas emissions, save energy compared to traditional steam cracking, and promote selective dehydrogenation without the risk of over-oxidation. However, the use of oxygen as an oxidant in ODHP presents challenges due to the over-oxidation of propane to carbon dioxide, which decreases the selectivity for propylene. The choice of oxidant is crucial in determining the selectivity and yield of propylene in ODHP processes.

The current methods of propylene production, such as steam cracking, fluid catalytic cracking, and direct dehydrogenation of propane, face challenges including a supply deficit due to high market demand, endothermicity-induced thermodynamic limits for propane conversion, and rapid catalyst deactivation due to coke formation. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) is advantageous because it is exothermic, which eliminates thermodynamic constraints at lower temperatures. However, the use of oxygen as an oxidant in ODHP can lead to overoxidation of olefins to carbon oxides, resulting in inefficient reactant use and low process selectivity.

The primary challenges in current propylene production methods, such as steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking (FCC), include high energy demands, low selectivity towards propylene, dwindling petroleum reserves, and rising oil prices. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by offering a more economical feedstock (propane) and potentially more efficient conversion technologies. However, ODHP presents its own set of advantages and limitations, particularly in the context of oxidant selection. The use of oxygen as an oxidant risks combusting the hydrocarbon reactants and products, making it challenging to control side reactions such as cracking and excessive oxidation. Mild oxidants like CO2 are preferred as they can improve catalyst activity without the risk of over-oxidation. Oxygen is an attractive oxidant for ODHP due to its ability to lower the reaction temperature to around 400°C and make the dehydrogenation reaction exothermic. However, the use of oxygen also introduces new challenges, such as the need to avoid overoxidation of the hydrocarbons in the feed to maintain high olefin selectivity. Carbon dioxide (CO2) is another oxidant that has been investigated for ODHP. CO2 can effectively consume hydrogen under dehydrogenation conditions, but it does not provide enough heat to compensate for the endothermic nature of the dehydrogenation reaction. The cofeeding of CO2 can also result in additional coke deposition due to the increased CO and decreased H2 partial pressures brought about by the reverse water-gas shift reaction. Moreover, CO2 competitively adsorbs on the surface, specifically on the basic sites of the catalyst materials, which can negatively affect their performance.

Current propylene production methods, such as fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) and steam cracking, have limitations, including high operating temperatures, high costs of precious metal catalysts, and catalyst deactivation due to coke formation and spatial separation of active species. Propane oxidative dehydrogenation (ODHP) addresses these issues by potentially reducing the reaction temperature due to its exothermic nature. However, ODHP presents its own set of challenges, particularly in controlling the fate of propylene due to the risk of overoxidation to carbon monoxide and dioxide, which significantly lowers propylene selectivity. The selection of oxidant is crucial, with carbon dioxide (CO2) being a preferred alternative to oxygen due to its potential to avoid deep oxidation, reduce coke formation, and favor propane conversion.

The primary challenges in current propylene production methods include endothermic reactions, coke production, and thermodynamic constraints limiting alkane conversion in dehydrogenation (DH). Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODP) addresses these issues by enabling lower reaction temperatures and more effective inhibition of surface coke formation. However, ODP presents its own set of advantages and limitations, particularly in the context of oxidant selection. Using oxygen as an oxidant in ODP allows for lower reaction temperatures and reduced coke formation, but it also results in low propylene selectivity due to the total oxidation of propane and propylene at high conversion rates. This highlights the need for a selective catalyst in the ODP process.

The conventional methods of producing propylene, such as catalytic and steam cracking, do not meet the increasing demand for propylene. Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is receiving attention as an alternative method. Direct catalytic dehydrogenation of hydrocarbons has low conversion per pass and low yields due to equilibrium limitations. The process is endothermic and the thermodynamic equilibrium is unfavorable. Temperatures above 800 K are required for commercially feasible conversions. At these temperatures, undesirable side reactions limit the propylene yield and coke formation necessitates frequent catalyst regeneration. Catalytic oxidative dehydrogenation of propane by oxygen is an attractive alternative because it is an exothermic and nonthermodynamically limited reaction. However, the propylene selectivity of the reaction remains an unsolved problem owing to the over oxidation of propane. On the other hand, soft oxidants such as carbon dioxide appear as potential alternatives. The PDH in the presence of carbon dioxide (CO2PDH) is also of interest because it utilizes the greenhouse gas CO2. CO2 is a coke removing agent as well. The promoting effect of CO2 is explained either by consumption of the hydrogen in the reverse watergas shift reaction, which shifts the equilibrium of propane dehydrogenation to completion (twostep pathway) or its participation in direct oxidation of propane to propylene (onestep pathway). The oxide catalysts which are active in the nonoxidative dehydrogenation of propane are also active in the process with CO2. Propane dehydrogenation with carbon dioxide is characterized by rapid catalyst deactivation due to coke formation.

The primary challenges in current propylene production methods, such as steam cracking and propane dehydrogenation, include high energy requirements, catalyst regeneration needs, and thermodynamic limitations. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by requiring less energy, not needing catalyst regeneration, and overcoming thermodynamic limitations. However, the use of oxygen as an oxidant in ODHP can lead to process flammability and over-oxidation, resulting in poor selectivity. Carbon dioxide, as a soft oxidant, is safer, milder, and more readily available, and its use can mitigate these challenges.

Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by offering a potentially more energy-efficient and decentralized process. However, ODHP presents its own set of advantages and limitations, particularly in the context of oxidant selection. Using oxygen as an oxidant can lead to side reactions such as cracking and combustion, which can limit the selectivity and yield of propylene. The specific challenges associated with using oxygen include the need for catalysts that can efficiently activate propane under mild conditions while suppressing over-oxidation and side reactions, control selectivity, as well as the management of the exothermic nature of the reaction to prevent overheating and ensure safety. The weaker CH and CC bonds in propane compared to ethane make selectivity control a greater challenge in ODHP.

The demand for propene is growing, and current sources such as steam cracking and catalytic cracking may not meet this demand without negatively impacting the production of other valuable co-products. Selective processes dedicated solely to propene synthesis, such as propane dehydrogenation, may gain significance. Oxidative dehydrogenation processes, including ODHP, can offer higher per-pass conversion of propane and yield of propene compared to non-oxidative dehydrogenation. The use of CO2 in the process can be an attractive way for chemical CO2 utilisation, producing hydrogen and carbon monoxide (syngas) as by-products. However, the literature does not delve into the specific challenges associated with using oxygen as an oxidant in ODHP.

The primary challenges in current propylene production methods include the difficulty in achieving both high propane conversion and high propylene selectivity simultaneously. Propylene is more susceptible to oxidation than propane, leading to a rapid decline in selectivity as conversion increases. At temperatures above 700 degrees Celsius, propane cracking becomes significant, resulting in the production of various products other than propylene. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by potentially offering higher conversion levels and selectivity to propylene compared to traditional dehydrogenation methods. However, ODHP presents its own set of challenges, particularly in maintaining selectivity as conversion increases, due to the higher reactivity of propylene compared to propane. Additionally, at higher temperatures, propane cracking becomes more significant, leading to the production of various by-products other than propylene. The selection of oxidant is also a critical factor, with oxygen presenting safety concerns and process upsets that need to be addressed.

The primary challenges in current propylene production methods, such as steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking, include high energy consumption, high capital and operating costs, environmental issues due to greenhouse gas emissions, and the production of byproducts that reduce the overall yield of propylene. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by offering a potentially more energy-efficient, cost-effective, and selective process for propylene production. The use of carbon dioxide (CO2) as an oxidant in ODHP can further reduce costs, lower greenhouse gas emissions, save energy compared to traditional steam cracking, and promote selective dehydrogenation without the risk of over-oxidation. However, the use of oxygen as an oxidant in ODHP presents challenges due to the over-oxidation of propane to carbon dioxide, which decreases the selectivity for propylene. The choice of oxidant is crucial in determining the selectivity and yield of propylene in ODHP processes.

The current methods of propylene production, such as steam cracking, fluid catalytic cracking, and direct dehydrogenation of propane, face challenges including a supply deficit due to high market demand, endothermicity-induced thermodynamic limits for propane conversion, and rapid catalyst deactivation due to coke formation. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) is advantageous because it is exothermic, which eliminates thermodynamic constraints at lower temperatures. However, the use of oxygen as an oxidant in ODHP can lead to overoxidation of olefins to carbon oxides, resulting in inefficient reactant use and low process selectivity.

The primary challenges in current propylene production methods, such as steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking (FCC), include high energy demands, low selectivity towards propylene, dwindling petroleum reserves, and rising oil prices. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by offering a more economical feedstock (propane) and potentially more efficient conversion technologies. However, ODHP presents its own set of advantages and limitations, particularly in the context of oxidant selection. The use of oxygen as an oxidant risks combusting the hydrocarbon reactants and products, making it challenging to control side reactions such as cracking and excessive oxidation. Mild oxidants like CO2 are preferred as they can improve catalyst activity without the risk of over-oxidation. Oxygen is an attractive oxidant for ODHP due to its ability to lower the reaction temperature to around 400°C and make the dehydrogenation reaction exothermic. However, the use of oxygen also introduces new challenges, such as the need to avoid overoxidation of the hydrocarbons in the feed to maintain high olefin selectivity. Carbon dioxide (CO2) is another oxidant that has been investigated for ODHP. CO2 can effectively consume hydrogen under dehydrogenation conditions, but it does not provide enough heat to compensate for the endothermic nature of the dehydrogenation reaction. The cofeeding of CO2 can also result in additional coke deposition due to the increased CO and decreased H2 partial pressures brought about by the reverse water-gas shift reaction. Moreover, CO2 competitively adsorbs on the surface, specifically on the basic sites of the catalyst materials, which can negatively affect their performance.

Current propylene production methods, such as fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) and steam cracking, have limitations, including high operating temperatures, high costs of precious metal catalysts, and catalyst deactivation due to coke formation and spatial separation of active species. Propane oxidative dehydrogenation (ODHP) addresses these issues by potentially reducing the reaction temperature due to its exothermic nature. However, ODHP presents its own set of challenges, particularly in controlling the fate of propylene due to the risk of overoxidation to carbon monoxide and dioxide, which significantly lowers propylene selectivity. The selection of oxidant is crucial, with carbon dioxide (CO2) being a preferred alternative to oxygen due to its potential to avoid deep oxidation, reduce coke formation, and favor propane conversion.

The primary challenges in current propylene production methods include endothermic reactions, coke production, and thermodynamic constraints limiting alkane conversion in dehydrogenation (DH). Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODP) addresses these issues by enabling lower reaction temperatures and more effective inhibition of surface coke formation. However, ODP presents its own set of advantages and limitations, particularly in the context of oxidant selection. Using oxygen as an oxidant in ODP allows for lower reaction temperatures and reduced coke formation, but it also results in low propylene selectivity due to the total oxidation of propane and propylene at high conversion rates. This highlights the need for a selective catalyst in the ODP process.

The conventional methods of producing propylene, such as catalytic and steam cracking, do not meet the increasing demand for propylene. Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is receiving attention as an alternative method. Direct catalytic dehydrogenation of hydrocarbons has low conversion per pass and low yields due to equilibrium limitations. The process is endothermic and the thermodynamic equilibrium is unfavorable. Temperatures above 800 K are required for commercially feasible conversions. At these temperatures, undesirable side reactions limit the propylene yield and coke formation necessitates frequent catalyst regeneration. Catalytic oxidative dehydrogenation of propane by oxygen is an attractive alternative because it is an exothermic and nonthermodynamically limited reaction. However, the propylene selectivity of the reaction remains an unsolved problem owing to the over oxidation of propane. On the other hand, soft oxidants such as carbon dioxide appear as potential alternatives. The PDH in the presence of carbon dioxide (CO2PDH) is also of interest because it utilizes the greenhouse gas CO2. CO2 is a coke removing agent as well. The promoting effect of CO2 is explained either by consumption of the hydrogen in the reverse watergas shift reaction, which shifts the equilibrium of propane dehydrogenation to completion (twostep pathway) or its participation in direct oxidation of propane to propylene (onestep pathway). The oxide catalysts which are active in the nonoxidative dehydrogenation of propane are also active in the process with CO2. Propane dehydrogenation with carbon dioxide is characterized by rapid catalyst deactivation due to coke formation.

The primary challenges in current propylene production methods, such as steam cracking and propane dehydrogenation, include high energy requirements, catalyst regeneration needs, and thermodynamic limitations. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by requiring less energy, not needing catalyst regeneration, and overcoming thermodynamic limitations. However, the use of oxygen as an oxidant in ODHP can lead to process flammability and over-oxidation, resulting in poor selectivity. Carbon dioxide, as a soft oxidant, is safer, milder, and more readily available, and its use can mitigate these challenges.

The primary challenges in current propylene production methods, such as steam cracking and fluid-catalytic-cracking (FCC), include the mismatch between the growing demand for propylene, especially in Western Europe, and the production capacity that favors ethylene over propylene. Additionally, dehydrogenation processes are limited by thermodynamic constraints that restrict alkane conversion, and coking can cause rapid catalyst deactivation. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by offering a route to produce propylene directly from propane, which can potentially match the market demand more closely. The process is exothermal, which improves energy efficiency compared to endothermal dehydrogenation and cracking processes. However, ODHP also presents its own set of advantages and limitations. The use of oxygen as an oxidant in ODHP can lead to higher energy losses due to the difference in combustion heat between the feed and the product, resulting in higher fixed costs. Moreover, the production of CO2, a main by-product in alkane ODH, adds to the environmental and economic considerations.

The primary challenges in current propylene production methods, such as steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking, include high energy consumption, significant greenhouse gas emissions, and the production of a wide range of co-products, which can dilute the efficiency of propylene production. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by offering a more direct route to propylene production with potentially lower energy requirements and fewer co-products. However, ODHP presents its own set of advantages and limitations, particularly in the context of oxidant selection. Using oxygen as an oxidant in ODHP can lead to higher propylene yields due to the direct conversion of propane to propylene and carbon dioxide. However, the use of oxygen also presents challenges, such as the risk of deep oxidation to carbon dioxide and the need for oxygen separation from air, which can be energy-intensive. The selection of oxygen as an oxidant must balance the advantages of higher propylene yields with the limitations of potential over-oxidation and the energy costs associated with oxygen production.

However, ODHP presents its own set of advantages and limitations, particularly in the context of oxidant selection. Using oxygen as an oxidant in ODHP can lead to higher propylene yields due to its higher reactivity compared to other oxidants. However, oxygen also poses challenges, such as the risk of deep oxidation, resulting in the formation of carbon dioxide and water instead of the desired propylene. Oxygen's high reactivity can also lead to the rapid deactivation of catalysts, necessitating the development of robust and selective catalysts. The selection of the oxidant is crucial in ODHP, as it significantly influences the reaction pathway, product selectivity, and catalyst stability. Nitrous oxide (N2O) has been shown to be a promising alternative oxidant, offering higher propylene selectivity and lower catalyst deactivation rates compared to oxygen. However, the use of N2O also presents its own challenges, such as higher production costs and potential environmental concerns due to its greenhouse gas properties.

The primary challenges in current propylene production methods are not explicitly stated in the literature. However, oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) is presented as an alternative method to overcome the equilibrium limitation of the dehydrogenation reaction. The use of SO2 as an oxidant in ODHP offers an advantage over conventional methods, particularly at high temperatures where there is an appreciable increase in selectivity per pass. However, the addition of SO2 to the feed increases the conversion of propane, but the selectivities to propylene are lower than those obtained with pure propane feed. The literature does not discuss the specific challenges associated with using oxygen as an oxidant in ODHP.

Current propylene production methods, primarily through steam and fluidized crackers, are expected to be insufficient to meet the rapidly growing demand for propylene. This necessitates the development of more economic and purposeful production techniques. Direct dehydrogenation of propane (DDP) is thermodynamically limited and highly endothermic, requiring temperatures that may exceed 973 K for significant propylene yields. The introduction of CO2 as a mild oxidant in the feedstock can alter the dehydrogenation pathway by oxidizing the abstracted hydrogen from the alkane, releasing the heat of reaction and thus reducing operating temperatures. CO2 can also increase the equilibrium conversion of propane by consuming H2 through the reverse water gas shift reaction. Unlike regular oxidative dehydrogenation with molecular oxygen, CO2 as a mild oxidant suppresses over-oxidation, minimizing the production of carbon oxides.

The primary challenges in current propylene production methods, particularly through the dehydrogenation of propane, include side reactions, thermodynamic constraints on selectivity and conversion, the endothermic nature of the process requiring high energy input, and coke formation leading to catalytic deactivation. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by adding an oxidant to the reaction feed, initiating the reaction through the oxidant rather than solely relying on high temperatures. This modification can potentially overcome limitations such as endothermic nature and coke formation. However, using oxygen as an oxidant presents its own set of challenges, including the overoxidation of olefins to CO and CO2 and the possibility of reaction runaway. To mitigate these issues, catalysts have been investigated, with supported vanadium-based oxides and mixed-metal oxides being extensively studied due to their high thermal stability, large surface areas, and favorable reducibility and basicity. Despite these efforts, no catalytic system has yet achieved product yields comparable to current industrial technologies for olefin production.

The primary challenges in current propylene production methods, which are based on non-oxidative processing of petroleum-based materials, include high costs and sustainability issues. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by offering higher energy efficiency, as it is an exothermic process, unlike dehydrogenation and cracking which are endothermic. ODHP also presents process simplicity as an advantage. However, ODHP presents its own set of challenges, particularly in the context of oxidant selection. The use of oxygen as an oxidant can lead to over-oxidation to carbon oxides of both the fed paraffins and produced olefins, limiting the selectivity to olefins. The use of CO2 as a mild oxidant has been proposed to mitigate this issue, as it can turn the process towards an exothermic character and potentially have positive effects on catalyst coking.

The primary challenges in current propylene production methods, such as steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking, include high energy consumption, complex processes, and the production of by-products. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by offering a more energy-efficient and direct route to propylene. However, ODHP presents its own set of advantages and limitations, particularly in the context of oxidant selection. Using oxygen as an oxidant in ODHP can lead to deep oxidation reactions, resulting in the formation of CO and CO2, which reduces the selectivity to propylene. Oxygen also poses safety concerns due to its reactivity with hydrocarbons, necessitating the use of diluents and careful control of reaction conditions to prevent runaway reactions and ensure process safety. The specific challenges associated with using oxygen include the need for oxygen separation from air, which increases the cost of the process, and the requirement for precise oxygen dosing to avoid over-oxidation.

The primary challenges in current propylene production methods, which rely on steam cracking of large hydrocarbons, include a gap between demand and supply of propene and other higher olefins due to the increased availability of low-cost ethene from shale gas. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by offering a potential on-purpose propene technology. ODHP presents advantages over non-oxidative propane dehydrogenation due to favorable thermodynamics, including exothermic reactions at lower temperatures, and enhanced catalyst stability by preventing coke deposition on the catalyst surface. However, ODHP also presents the challenge of preventing the over-oxidation of propene to CO and CO2, which are more thermodynamically stable.

Oxygen is a preferred oxidant due to its ability to promote selectivity for propene, but the unselective combustion reactions limit alkene selectivities. The use of oxygen also leads to extensive selectivity losses with increasing conversion, due to propene re-adsorption and subsequent oxidation to carbon oxides, resulting in propene yields lower than 30%.

The primary challenges in current propylene production methods, such as steam cracking (SC) and fluidic catalytic cracking (FCC), include low selectivity and yields for propylene, as it is produced as a by-product. The increasing use of ethane in steam crackers has led to a decline in the propylene/ethylene production ratio, while the demand for propylene is increasing due to the expanding polypropylene market. Propane dehydrogenation is limited by thermodynamics, requiring very high reaction temperatures for high single-pass propane conversion, which complicates the separation of hydrogen and unreacted propane from propylene. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by potentially offering higher propylene yields and selectivity, but it is limited by the consecutive oxidation of propylene to oxygenated products, resulting in a maximum reported yield of about 30%.

However, the addition of SO2 to the feed increases the conversion of propane, but the selectivities to propylene are lower than those obtained with pure propane feed. The literature does not discuss the specific challenges associated with using oxygen as an oxidant in ODHP.

Current propylene production methods, primarily through steam and fluidized crackers, are expected to be insufficient to meet the rapidly growing demand for propylene. This necessitates the development of more economic and purposeful production techniques. Direct dehydrogenation of propane (DDP) is thermodynamically limited and highly endothermic, requiring temperatures that may exceed 973 K for significant propylene yields. The introduction of CO2 as a mild oxidant in the feedstock can alter the dehydrogenation pathway by oxidizing the abstracted hydrogen from the alkane, releasing the heat of reaction and thus reducing operating temperatures. CO2 can also increase the equilibrium conversion of propane by consuming H2 through the reverse water gas shift reaction. Unlike regular oxidative dehydrogenation with molecular oxygen, CO2 as a mild oxidant suppresses over-oxidation, minimizing the production of carbon oxides.

The primary challenges in current propylene production methods, particularly through the dehydrogenation of propane, include side reactions, thermodynamic constraints on selectivity and conversion, the endothermic nature of the process requiring high energy input, and coke formation leading to catalytic deactivation. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by adding an oxidant to the reaction feed, initiating the reaction through the oxidant rather than solely relying on high temperatures. This modification can potentially overcome limitations such as endothermic nature and coke formation. However, using oxygen as an oxidant presents its own set of challenges, including the overoxidation of olefins to CO and CO2 and the possibility of reaction runaway. To mitigate these issues, catalysts have been investigated, with supported vanadium-based oxides and mixed-metal oxides being extensively studied due to their high thermal stability, large surface areas, and favorable reducibility and basicity. Despite these efforts, no catalytic system has yet achieved product yields comparable to current industrial technologies for olefin production.

ODHP also presents process simplicity as an advantage. However, ODHP presents its own set of challenges, particularly in the context of oxidant selection. The use of oxygen as an oxidant can lead to over-oxidation to carbon oxides of both the fed paraffins and produced olefins, limiting the selectivity to olefins. The use of CO2 as a mild oxidant has been proposed to mitigate this issue, as it can turn the process towards an exothermic character and potentially have positive effects on catalyst coking.

However, ODHP presents its own set of advantages and limitations, particularly in the context of oxidant selection. Using oxygen as an oxidant in ODHP can lead to deep oxidation reactions, resulting in the formation of CO and CO2, which reduces the selectivity to propylene. Oxygen also poses safety concerns due to its reactivity with hydrocarbons, necessitating the use of diluents and careful control of reaction conditions to prevent runaway reactions and ensure process safety. The specific challenges associated with using oxygen include the need for oxygen separation from air, which increases the cost of the process, and the requirement for precise oxygen dosing to avoid over-oxidation.

The primary challenges in current propylene production methods, which rely on steam cracking of large hydrocarbons, include a gap between demand and supply of propene and other higher olefins due to the increased availability of low-cost ethene from shale gas. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by offering a potential on-purpose propene technology. ODHP presents advantages over non-oxidative propane dehydrogenation due to favorable thermodynamics, including exothermic reactions at lower temperatures, and enhanced catalyst stability by preventing coke deposition on the catalyst surface. However, ODHP also presents the challenge of preventing the over-oxidation of propene to CO and CO2, which are more thermodynamically stable.

The primary challenges in current propylene production methods, such as steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking, include high energy consumption, low selectivity towards propylene, and reliance on dwindling petroleum reserves. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by offering a more energy-efficient process with higher selectivity for propylene production. However, ODHP presents its own set of advantages and limitations, particularly in the context of oxidant selection. Using oxygen as an oxidant can lead to overoxidation and the formation of undesired carbon oxides, while using molecular oxygen can result in higher selectivity but also higher costs. The specific challenges associated with using oxygen include the need for oxygen separation from air, which can be energy-intensive, and the risk of overoxidation, which can reduce the yield of propylene.

Oxygen is a preferred oxidant due to its ability to promote selectivity for propene, but the unselective combustion reactions limit alkene selectivities. The use of oxygen also leads to extensive selectivity losses with increasing conversion, due to propene re-adsorption and subsequent oxidation to carbon oxides, resulting in propene yields lower than 30%.

The primary challenges in current propylene production methods, such as steam cracking (SC) and fluidic catalytic cracking (FCC), include low selectivity and yields for propylene, as it is produced as a by-product. The increasing use of ethane in steam crackers has led to a decline in the propylene/ethylene production ratio, while the demand for propylene is increasing due to the expanding polypropylene market. Propane dehydrogenation is limited by thermodynamics, requiring very high reaction temperatures for high single-pass propane conversion, which complicates the separation of hydrogen and unreacted propane from propylene. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by potentially offering higher propylene yields and selectivity, but it is limited by the consecutive oxidation of propylene to oxygenated products, resulting in a maximum reported yield of about 30%. The selection of oxidants is crucial, as F2 is inappropriate due to its high reactivity and unfavorable thermodynamics, Cl2 reactions are fast and non-selective, and I2 reactions are selective but slow and only thermodynamically favorable at high temperatures. Bromine reactions with propane are more feasible, but resolving the polyhalogenation selectivity issue requires a higher propane to bromine ratio, limiting single-pass propane conversion.

The primary challenges in current propylene production methods, such as steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking, are their high energy consumption and the requirement for large-scale centralized plants, which limits the utilization of natural gas reserves in remote areas.

However, ODHP presents its own set of advantages and limitations, particularly in the context of oxidant selection. Using oxygen as an oxidant can lead to side reactions such as cracking and combustion, which can limit the selectivity and yield of propylene. The specific challenges associated with using oxygen include the need for catalysts that can efficiently activate propane under mild conditions while suppressing over-oxidation and side reactions, control selectivity, as well as the management of the exothermic nature of the reaction to prevent overheating and ensure safety. The weaker CH and CC bonds in propane compared to ethane make selectivity control a greater challenge in ODHP.

The demand for propene is growing, and current sources such as steam cracking and catalytic cracking may not meet this demand without negatively impacting the production of other valuable co-products. Selective processes dedicated solely to propene synthesis, such as propane dehydrogenation, may gain significance. Oxidative dehydrogenation processes, including ODHP, can offer higher per-pass conversion of propane and yield of propene compared to non-oxidative dehydrogenation. The use of CO2 in the process can be an attractive way for chemical CO2 utilisation, producing hydrogen and carbon monoxide (syngas) as by-products. However, the literature does not delve into the specific challenges associated with using oxygen as an oxidant in ODHP.

The primary challenges in current propylene production methods include the difficulty in achieving both high propane conversion and high propylene selectivity simultaneously. Propylene is more susceptible to oxidation than propane, leading to a rapid decline in selectivity as conversion increases. At temperatures above 700 degrees Celsius, propane cracking becomes significant, resulting in the production of various products other than propylene. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by potentially offering higher conversion levels and selectivity to propylene compared to traditional dehydrogenation methods. However, ODHP presents its own set of challenges, particularly in maintaining selectivity as conversion increases, due to the higher reactivity of propylene compared to propane. Additionally, at higher temperatures, propane cracking becomes more significant, leading to the production of various by-products other than propylene. The selection of oxidant is also a critical factor, with oxygen presenting safety concerns and process upsets that need to be addressed.

The primary challenges in current propylene production methods, such as steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking, include high energy consumption, high capital and operating costs, environmental issues due to greenhouse gas emissions, and the production of byproducts that reduce the overall yield of propylene. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by offering a potentially more energy-efficient, cost-effective, and selective process for propylene production. The use of carbon dioxide (CO2) as an oxidant in ODHP can further reduce costs, lower greenhouse gas emissions, save energy compared to traditional steam cracking, and promote selective dehydrogenation without the risk of over-oxidation. However, the use of oxygen as an oxidant in ODHP presents challenges due to the over-oxidation of propane to carbon dioxide, which decreases the selectivity for propylene. The choice of oxidant is crucial in determining the selectivity and yield of propylene in ODHP processes.

The current methods of propylene production, such as steam cracking, fluid catalytic cracking, and direct dehydrogenation of propane, face challenges including a supply deficit due to high market demand, endothermicity-induced thermodynamic limits for propane conversion, and rapid catalyst deactivation due to coke formation. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) is advantageous because it is exothermic, which eliminates thermodynamic constraints at lower temperatures. However, the use of oxygen as an oxidant in ODHP can lead to overoxidation of olefins to carbon oxides, resulting in inefficient reactant use and low process selectivity.

The primary challenges in current propylene production methods, such as steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking (FCC), include high energy demands, low selectivity towards propylene, dwindling petroleum reserves, and rising oil prices. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by offering a more economical feedstock (propane) and potentially more efficient conversion technologies. However, ODHP presents its own set of advantages and limitations, particularly in the context of oxidant selection. The use of oxygen as an oxidant risks combusting the hydrocarbon reactants and products, making it challenging to control side reactions such as cracking and excessive oxidation. Mild oxidants like CO2 are preferred as they can improve catalyst activity without the risk of over-oxidation. Oxygen is an attractive oxidant for ODHP due to its ability to lower the reaction temperature to around 400°C and make the dehydrogenation reaction exothermic. However, the use of oxygen also introduces new challenges, such as the need to avoid overoxidation of the hydrocarbons in the feed to maintain high olefin selectivity. Carbon dioxide (CO2) is another oxidant that has been investigated for ODHP. CO2 can effectively consume hydrogen under dehydrogenation conditions, but it does not provide enough heat to compensate for the endothermic nature of the dehydrogenation reaction. The cofeeding of CO2 can also result in additional coke deposition due to the increased CO and decreased H2 partial pressures brought about by the reverse water-gas shift reaction. Moreover, CO2 competitively adsorbs on the surface, specifically on the basic sites of the catalyst materials, which can negatively affect their performance.

Current propylene production methods, such as fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) and steam cracking, have limitations, including high operating temperatures, high costs of precious metal catalysts, and catalyst deactivation due to coke formation and spatial separation of active species. Propane oxidative dehydrogenation (ODHP) addresses these issues by potentially reducing the reaction temperature due to its exothermic nature. However, ODHP presents its own set of challenges, particularly in controlling the fate of propylene due to the risk of overoxidation to carbon monoxide and dioxide, which significantly lowers propylene selectivity. The selection of oxidant is crucial, with carbon dioxide (CO2) being a preferred alternative to oxygen due to its potential to avoid deep oxidation, reduce coke formation, and favor propane conversion.

The primary challenges in current propylene production methods include endothermic reactions, coke production, and thermodynamic constraints limiting alkane conversion in dehydrogenation (DH). Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODP) addresses these issues by enabling lower reaction temperatures and more effective inhibition of surface coke formation. However, ODP presents its own set of advantages and limitations, particularly in the context of oxidant selection. Using oxygen as an oxidant in ODP allows for lower reaction temperatures and reduced coke formation, but it also results in low propylene selectivity due to the total oxidation of propane and propylene at high conversion rates. This highlights the need for a selective catalyst in the ODP process.

The conventional methods of producing propylene, such as catalytic and steam cracking, do not meet the increasing demand for propylene. Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is receiving attention as an alternative method. Direct catalytic dehydrogenation of hydrocarbons has low conversion per pass and low yields due to equilibrium limitations. The process is endothermic and the thermodynamic equilibrium is unfavorable. Temperatures above 800 K are required for commercially feasible conversions. At these temperatures, undesirable side reactions limit the propylene yield and coke formation necessitates frequent catalyst regeneration. Catalytic oxidative dehydrogenation of propane by oxygen is an attractive alternative because it is an exothermic and nonthermodynamically limited reaction. However, the propylene selectivity of the reaction remains an unsolved problem owing to the over oxidation of propane. On the other hand, soft oxidants such as carbon dioxide appear as potential alternatives. The PDH in the presence of carbon dioxide (CO2PDH) is also of interest because it utilizes the greenhouse gas CO2. CO2 is a coke removing agent as well. The promoting effect of CO2 is explained either by consumption of the hydrogen in the reverse watergas shift reaction, which shifts the equilibrium of propane dehydrogenation to completion (twostep pathway) or its participation in direct oxidation of propane to propylene (onestep pathway). The oxide catalysts which are active in the nonoxidative dehydrogenation of propane are also active in the process with CO2. Propane dehydrogenation with carbon dioxide is characterized by rapid catalyst deactivation due to coke formation.

The primary challenges in current propylene production methods, such as steam cracking and propane dehydrogenation, include high energy requirements, catalyst regeneration needs, and thermodynamic limitations. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by requiring less energy, not needing catalyst regeneration, and overcoming thermodynamic limitations. However, the use of oxygen as an oxidant in ODHP can lead to process flammability and over-oxidation, resulting in poor selectivity. Carbon dioxide, as a soft oxidant, is safer, milder, and more readily available, and its use can mitigate these challenges.

The primary challenges in current propylene production methods, such as steam cracking and fluid-catalytic-cracking (FCC), include the mismatch between the growing demand for propylene, especially in Western Europe, and the production capacity that favors ethylene over propylene. Additionally, dehydrogenation processes are limited by thermodynamic constraints that restrict alkane conversion, and coking can cause rapid catalyst deactivation. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by offering a route to produce propylene directly from propane, which can potentially match the market demand more closely. The process is exothermal, which improves energy efficiency compared to endothermal dehydrogenation and cracking processes. However, ODHP also presents its own set of advantages and limitations. The use of oxygen as an oxidant in ODHP can lead to higher energy losses due to the difference in combustion heat between the feed and the product, resulting in higher fixed costs. Moreover, the production of CO2, a main by-product in alkane ODH, adds to the environmental and economic considerations.

The primary challenges in current propylene production methods, such as steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking, include high energy consumption, significant greenhouse gas emissions, and the production of a wide range of co-products, which can dilute the efficiency of propylene production.

However, the use of oxygen also presents challenges, such as the risk of deep oxidation to carbon dioxide and the need for oxygen separation from air, which can be energy-intensive.

The selection of the oxidant is crucial in ODHP, as it significantly influences the reaction pathway, product selectivity, and catalyst stability. Nitrous oxide (N2O) has been shown to be a promising alternative oxidant, offering higher propylene selectivity and lower catalyst deactivation rates compared to oxygen. However, the use of N2O also presents its own challenges, such as higher production costs and potential environmental concerns due to its greenhouse gas properties.

Mild oxidants like CO2 are preferred as they can improve catalyst activity without the risk of over-oxidation. Oxygen is an attractive oxidant for ODHP due to its ability to lower the reaction temperature to around 400°C and make the dehydrogenation reaction exothermic. However, the use of oxygen also introduces new challenges, such as the need to avoid overoxidation of the hydrocarbons in the feed to maintain high olefin selectivity. Carbon dioxide (CO2) is another oxidant that has been investigated for ODHP. CO2 can effectively consume hydrogen under dehydrogenation conditions, but it does not provide enough heat to compensate for the endothermic nature of the dehydrogenation reaction. The cofeeding of CO2 can also result in additional coke deposition due to the increased CO and decreased H2 partial pressures brought about by the reverse water-gas shift reaction. Moreover, CO2 competitively adsorbs on the surface, specifically on the basic sites of the catalyst materials, which can negatively affect their performance.

Current propylene production methods, such as fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) and steam cracking, have limitations, including high operating temperatures, high costs of precious metal catalysts, and catalyst deactivation due to coke formation and spatial separation of active species. Propane oxidative dehydrogenation (ODHP) addresses these issues by potentially reducing the reaction temperature due to its exothermic nature. However, ODHP presents its own set of challenges, particularly in controlling the fate of propylene due to the risk of overoxidation to carbon monoxide and dioxide, which significantly lowers propylene selectivity. The selection of oxidant is crucial, with carbon dioxide (CO2) being a preferred alternative to oxygen due to its potential to avoid deep oxidation, reduce coke formation, and favor propane conversion.

The primary challenges in current propylene production methods include endothermic reactions, coke production, and thermodynamic constraints limiting alkane conversion in dehydrogenation (DH). Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODP) addresses these issues by enabling lower reaction temperatures and more effective inhibition of surface coke formation. However, ODP presents its own set of advantages and limitations, particularly in the context of oxidant selection. Using oxygen as an oxidant in ODP allows for lower reaction temperatures and reduced coke formation, but it also results in low propylene selectivity due to the total oxidation of propane and propylene at high conversion rates. This highlights the need for a selective catalyst in the ODP process.

The conventional methods of producing propylene, such as catalytic and steam cracking, do not meet the increasing demand for propylene. Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is receiving attention as an alternative method. Direct catalytic dehydrogenation of hydrocarbons has low conversion per pass and low yields due to equilibrium limitations. The process is endothermic and the thermodynamic equilibrium is unfavorable. Temperatures above 800 K are required for commercially feasible conversions. At these temperatures, undesirable side reactions limit the propylene yield and coke formation necessitates frequent catalyst regeneration. Catalytic oxidative dehydrogenation of propane by oxygen is an attractive alternative because it is an exothermic and nonthermodynamically limited reaction. However, the propylene selectivity of the reaction remains an unsolved problem owing to the over oxidation of propane. On the other hand, soft oxidants such as carbon dioxide appear as potential alternatives. The PDH in the presence of carbon dioxide (CO2PDH) is also of interest because it utilizes the greenhouse gas CO2. CO2 is a coke removing agent as well. The promoting effect of CO2 is explained either by consumption of the hydrogen in the reverse watergas shift reaction, which shifts the equilibrium of propane dehydrogenation to completion (twostep pathway) or its participation in direct oxidation of propane to propylene (onestep pathway). The oxide catalysts which are active in the nonoxidative dehydrogenation of propane are also active in the process with CO2. Propane dehydrogenation with carbon dioxide is characterized by rapid catalyst deactivation due to coke formation.

The primary challenges in current propylene production methods, such as steam cracking and propane dehydrogenation, include high energy requirements, catalyst regeneration needs, and thermodynamic limitations. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by requiring less energy, not needing catalyst regeneration, and overcoming thermodynamic limitations. However, the use of oxygen as an oxidant in ODHP can lead to process flammability and over-oxidation, resulting in poor selectivity. Carbon dioxide, as a soft oxidant, is safer, milder, and more readily available, and its use can mitigate these challenges.

The primary challenges in current propylene production methods, such as steam cracking and fluid-catalytic-cracking (FCC), include the mismatch between the growing demand for propylene, especially in Western Europe, and the production capacity that favors ethylene over propylene. Additionally, dehydrogenation processes are limited by thermodynamic constraints that restrict alkane conversion, and coking can cause rapid catalyst deactivation. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by offering a route to produce propylene directly from propane, which can potentially match the market demand more closely. The process is exothermal, which improves energy efficiency compared to endothermal dehydrogenation and cracking processes. However, ODHP also presents its own set of advantages and limitations. The use of oxygen as an oxidant in ODHP can lead to higher energy losses due to the difference in combustion heat between the feed and the product, resulting in higher fixed costs. Moreover, the production of CO2, a main by-product in alkane ODH, adds to the environmental and economic considerations.

The primary challenges in current propylene production methods, such as steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking, include high energy consumption, significant greenhouse gas emissions, and the production of a wide range of co-products, which can dilute the efficiency of propylene production. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by offering a more direct route to propylene production with potentially lower energy requirements and fewer co-products. However, ODHP presents its own set of advantages and limitations, particularly in the context of oxidant selection. Using oxygen as an oxidant in ODHP can lead to higher propylene yields due to the direct conversion of propane to propylene and carbon dioxide. However, the use of oxygen also presents challenges, such as the risk of deep oxidation to carbon dioxide and the need for oxygen separation from air, which can be energy-intensive. The selection of oxygen as an oxidant must balance the advantages of higher propylene yields with the limitations of potential over-oxidation and the energy costs associated with oxygen production.

Using oxygen as an oxidant in ODHP can lead to higher propylene yields due to its higher reactivity compared to other oxidants. However, oxygen also poses challenges, such as the risk of deep oxidation, resulting in the formation of carbon dioxide and water instead of the desired propylene. Oxygen's high reactivity can also lead to the rapid deactivation of catalysts, necessitating the development of robust and selective catalysts. The selection of the oxidant is crucial in ODHP, as it significantly influences the reaction pathway, product selectivity, and catalyst stability. Nitrous oxide (N2O) has been shown to be a promising alternative oxidant, offering higher propylene selectivity and lower catalyst deactivation rates compared to oxygen. However, the use of N2O also presents its own challenges, such as higher production costs and potential environmental concerns due to its greenhouse gas properties.

The primary challenges in current propylene production methods are not explicitly stated in the literature. However, oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) is presented as an alternative method to overcome the equilibrium limitation of the dehydrogenation reaction. The use of SO2 as an oxidant in ODHP offers an advantage over conventional methods, particularly at high temperatures where there is an appreciable increase in selectivity per pass. However, the addition of SO2 to the feed increases the conversion of propane, but the selectivities to propylene are lower than those obtained with pure propane feed. The literature does not discuss the specific challenges associated with using oxygen as an oxidant in ODHP.

Current propylene production methods, primarily through steam and fluidized crackers, are expected to be insufficient to meet the rapidly growing demand for propylene. This necessitates the development of more economic and purposeful production techniques. Direct dehydrogenation of propane (DDP) is thermodynamically limited and highly endothermic, requiring temperatures that may exceed 973 K for significant propylene yields. The introduction of CO2 as a mild oxidant in the feedstock can alter the dehydrogenation pathway by oxidizing the abstracted hydrogen from the alkane, releasing the heat of reaction and thus reducing operating temperatures. CO2 can also increase the equilibrium conversion of propane by consuming H2 through the reverse water gas shift reaction. Unlike regular oxidative dehydrogenation with molecular oxygen, CO2 as a mild oxidant suppresses over-oxidation, minimizing the production of carbon oxides.

The primary challenges in current propylene production methods, particularly through the dehydrogenation of propane, include side reactions, thermodynamic constraints on selectivity and conversion, the endothermic nature of the process requiring high energy input, and coke formation leading to catalytic deactivation. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by adding an oxidant to the reaction feed, initiating the reaction through the oxidant rather than solely relying on high temperatures. This modification can potentially overcome limitations such as endothermic nature and coke formation. However, using oxygen as an oxidant presents its own set of challenges, including the overoxidation of olefins to CO and CO2 and the possibility of reaction runaway. To mitigate these issues, catalysts have been investigated, with supported vanadium-based oxides and mixed-metal oxides being extensively studied due to their high thermal stability, large surface areas, and favorable reducibility and basicity. Despite these efforts, no catalytic system has yet achieved product yields comparable to current industrial technologies for olefin production.

The primary challenges in current propylene production methods, which are based on non-oxidative processing of petroleum-based materials, include high costs and sustainability issues. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by offering higher energy efficiency, as it is an exothermic process, unlike dehydrogenation and cracking which are endothermic. ODHP also presents process simplicity as an advantage. However, ODHP presents its own set of challenges, particularly in the context of oxidant selection. The use of oxygen as an oxidant can lead to over-oxidation to carbon oxides of both the fed paraffins and produced olefins, limiting the selectivity to olefins. The use of CO2 as a mild oxidant has been proposed to mitigate this issue, as it can turn the process towards an exothermic character and potentially have positive effects on catalyst coking.

The primary challenges in current propylene production methods, such as steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking, include high energy consumption, complex processes, and the production of by-products.

However, ODHP presents its own set of advantages and limitations, particularly in the context of oxidant selection. Using oxygen as an oxidant in ODHP can lead to deep oxidation reactions, resulting in the formation of CO and CO2, which reduces the selectivity to propylene. Oxygen also poses safety concerns due to its reactivity with hydrocarbons, necessitating the use of diluents and careful control of reaction conditions to prevent runaway reactions and ensure process safety. The specific challenges associated with using oxygen include the need for oxygen separation from air, which increases the cost of the process, and the requirement for precise oxygen dosing to avoid over-oxidation.

The primary challenges in current propylene production methods, which rely on steam cracking of large hydrocarbons, include a gap between demand and supply of propene and other higher olefins due to the increased availability of low-cost ethene from shale gas. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by offering a potential on-purpose propene technology. ODHP presents advantages over non-oxidative propane dehydrogenation due to favorable thermodynamics, including exothermic reactions at lower temperatures, and enhanced catalyst stability by preventing coke deposition on the catalyst surface. However, ODHP also presents the challenge of preventing the over-oxidation of propene to CO and CO2, which are more thermodynamically stable.

The primary challenges in current propylene production methods, such as steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking, include high energy consumption, low selectivity towards propylene, and reliance on dwindling petroleum reserves. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by offering a more energy-efficient process with higher selectivity for propylene production. However, ODHP presents its own set of advantages and limitations, particularly in the context of oxidant selection. Using oxygen as an oxidant can lead to overoxidation and the formation of undesired carbon oxides, while using molecular oxygen can result in higher selectivity but also higher costs. The specific challenges associated with using oxygen include the need for oxygen separation from air, which can be energy-intensive, and the risk of overoxidation, which can reduce the yield of propylene. Oxygen is a cheap and abundant oxidant, but its use can lead to overoxidation and the formation of undesired byproducts such as carbon oxides. The presence of oxygen can also cause hotspots in the catalyst bed, leading to temperature control issues. To mitigate these challenges, the development of suitable catalysts and reactor designs is crucial for the successful implementation of ODHP.

Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by operating at lower temperatures due to the presence of oxygen, which inhibits coke formation. However, ODHP presents its own set of advantages and limitations, particularly in the context of oxidant selection. Oxygen is a preferred oxidant due to its ability to promote selectivity for propene, but the unselective combustion reactions limit alkene selectivities. The presence of oxygen can lead to the over-oxidation of propene to carbon oxides, which decreases propene yields. The use of oxygen also requires careful control of reaction conditions to prevent explosive mixtures and manage the exothermic nature of the reaction. Oxygen is a highly effective oxidant for ODHP, promoting high propylene yields. However, the use of oxygen also presents challenges, including the risk of explosive mixtures and the potential for over-oxidation, leading to the formation of carbon oxides. The introduction of H2S in the feed mixture has been shown to enhance the selectivity for propylene, likely by modifying the reaction pathway and suppressing over-oxidation. Oxygen is a preferred oxidant due to its ability to promote selectivity for propene, but the unselective combustion reactions limit alkene selectivities. The use of oxygen also leads to extensive selectivity losses with increasing conversion, due to propene re-adsorption and subsequent oxidation to carbon oxides, resulting in propene yields lower than 30%.

The primary challenges in current propylene production methods, such as steam cracking (SC) and fluidic catalytic cracking (FCC), include low selectivity and yields for propylene, as it is produced as a by-product. The increasing use of ethane in steam crackers has led to a decline in the propylene/ethylene production ratio, while the demand for propylene is increasing due to the expanding polypropylene market. Propane dehydrogenation is limited by thermodynamics, requiring very high reaction temperatures for high single-pass propane conversion, which complicates the separation of hydrogen and unreacted propane from propylene. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by potentially offering higher propylene yields and selectivity, but it is limited by the consecutive oxidation of propylene to oxygenated products, resulting in a maximum reported yield of about 30%. The selection of oxidants is crucial, as F2 is inappropriate due to its high reactivity and unfavorable thermodynamics, Cl2 reactions are fast and non-selective, and I2 reactions are selective but slow and only thermodynamically favorable at high temperatures. Bromine reactions with propane are more feasible, but resolving the polyhalogenation selectivity issue requires a higher propane to bromine ratio, limiting single-pass propane conversion.

The primary challenges in current propylene production methods, such as steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking, are their high energy consumption and the requirement for large-scale centralized plants, which limits the utilization of natural gas reserves in remote areas. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by offering a potentially more energy-efficient and decentralized process. However, ODHP presents its own set of advantages and limitations, particularly in the context of oxidant selection. Using oxygen as an oxidant can lead to side reactions such as cracking and combustion, which can limit the selectivity and yield of propylene. The specific challenges associated with using oxygen include the need for catalysts that can efficiently activate propane under mild conditions while suppressing over-oxidation and side reactions, control selectivity, as well as the management of the exothermic nature of the reaction to prevent overheating and ensure safety. The weaker CH and CC bonds in propane compared to ethane make selectivity control a greater challenge in ODHP.

The demand for propene is growing, and current sources such as steam cracking and catalytic cracking may not meet this demand without negatively impacting the production of other valuable co-products. Selective processes dedicated solely to propene synthesis, such as propane dehydrogenation, may gain significance. Oxidative dehydrogenation processes, including ODHP, can offer higher per-pass conversion of propane and yield of propene compared to non-oxidative dehydrogenation. The use of CO2 in the process can be an attractive way for chemical CO2 utilisation, producing hydrogen and carbon monoxide (syngas) as by-products. However, the literature does not delve into the specific challenges associated with using oxygen as an oxidant in ODHP.

The primary challenges in current propylene production methods include the difficulty in achieving both high propane conversion and high propylene selectivity simultaneously. Propylene is more susceptible to oxidation than propane, leading to a rapid decline in selectivity as conversion increases. At temperatures above 700 degrees Celsius, propane cracking becomes significant, resulting in the production of various products other than propylene. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by potentially offering higher conversion levels and selectivity to propylene compared to traditional dehydrogenation methods. However, ODHP presents its own set of challenges, particularly in maintaining selectivity as conversion increases, due to the higher reactivity of propylene compared to propane. Additionally, at higher temperatures, propane cracking becomes more significant, leading to the production of various by-products other than propylene.

Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by offering a more energy-efficient process with higher selectivity for propylene production. However, ODHP presents its own set of advantages and limitations, particularly in the context of oxidant selection. Using oxygen as an oxidant can lead to overoxidation and the formation of undesired carbon oxides, while using molecular oxygen can result in higher selectivity but also higher costs. The specific challenges associated with using oxygen include the need for oxygen separation from air, which can be energy-intensive, and the risk of overoxidation, which can reduce the yield of propylene. Oxygen is a cheap and abundant oxidant, but its use can lead to overoxidation and the formation of undesired byproducts such as carbon oxides. The presence of oxygen can also cause hotspots in the catalyst bed, leading to temperature control issues. To mitigate these challenges, the development of suitable catalysts and reactor designs is crucial for the successful implementation of ODHP.

However, ODHP presents its own set of advantages and limitations, particularly in the context of oxidant selection. Oxygen is a preferred oxidant due to its ability to promote selectivity for propene, but the unselective combustion reactions limit alkene selectivities. The presence of oxygen can lead to the over-oxidation of propene to carbon oxides, which decreases propene yields. The use of oxygen also requires careful control of reaction conditions to prevent explosive mixtures and manage the exothermic nature of the reaction. Oxygen is a highly effective oxidant for ODHP, promoting high propylene yields. However, the use of oxygen also presents challenges, including the risk of explosive mixtures and the potential for over-oxidation, leading to the formation of carbon oxides.

The primary challenges in current propylene production methods, such as steam cracking (SC) and fluidic catalytic cracking (FCC), include low selectivity and yields for propylene, as it is produced as a by-product. The increasing use of ethane in steam crackers has led to a decline in the propylene/ethylene production ratio, while the demand for propylene is increasing due to the expanding polypropylene market. Propane dehydrogenation is limited by thermodynamics, requiring very high reaction temperatures for high single-pass propane conversion, which complicates the separation of hydrogen and unreacted propane from propylene. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by potentially offering higher propylene yields and selectivity, but it is limited by the consecutive oxidation of propylene to oxygenated products, resulting in a maximum reported yield of about 30%.

The specific challenges associated with using oxygen include the need for catalysts that can efficiently activate propane under mild conditions while suppressing over-oxidation and side reactions, control selectivity, as well as the management of the exothermic nature of the reaction to prevent overheating and ensure safety. The weaker CH and CC bonds in propane compared to ethane make selectivity control a greater challenge in ODHP.

The demand for propene is growing, and current sources such as steam cracking and catalytic cracking may not meet this demand without negatively impacting the production of other valuable co-products. Selective processes dedicated solely to propene synthesis, such as propane dehydrogenation, may gain significance. Oxidative dehydrogenation processes, including ODHP, can offer higher per-pass conversion of propane and yield of propene compared to non-oxidative dehydrogenation. The use of CO2 in the process can be an attractive way for chemical CO2 utilisation, producing hydrogen and carbon monoxide (syngas) as by-products. However, the literature does not delve into the specific challenges associated with using oxygen as an oxidant in ODHP.

The primary challenges in current propylene production methods include the difficulty in achieving both high propane conversion and high propylene selectivity simultaneously. Propylene is more susceptible to oxidation than propane, leading to a rapid decline in selectivity as conversion increases. At temperatures above 700 degrees Celsius, propane cracking becomes significant, resulting in the production of various products other than propylene. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by potentially offering higher conversion levels and selectivity to propylene compared to traditional dehydrogenation methods. However, ODHP presents its own set of challenges, particularly in maintaining selectivity as conversion increases, due to the higher reactivity of propylene compared to propane. Additionally, at higher temperatures, propane cracking becomes more significant, leading to the production of various by-products other than propylene.

However, the use of oxygen as an oxidant in ODHP presents challenges due to the over-oxidation of propane to carbon dioxide, which decreases the selectivity for propylene. The choice of oxidant is crucial in determining the selectivity and yield of propylene in ODHP processes.

The current methods of propylene production, such as steam cracking, fluid catalytic cracking, and direct dehydrogenation of propane, face challenges including a supply deficit due to high market demand, endothermicity-induced thermodynamic limits for propane conversion, and rapid catalyst deactivation due to coke formation. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) is advantageous because it is exothermic, which eliminates thermodynamic constraints at lower temperatures. However, the use of oxygen as an oxidant in ODHP can lead to overoxidation of olefins to carbon oxides, resulting in inefficient reactant use and low process selectivity.

The primary challenges in current propylene production methods, such as steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking (FCC), include high energy demands, low selectivity towards propylene, dwindling petroleum reserves, and rising oil prices. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by offering a more economical feedstock (propane) and potentially more efficient conversion technologies. However, ODHP presents its own set of advantages and limitations, particularly in the context of oxidant selection. The use of oxygen as an oxidant risks combusting the hydrocarbon reactants and products, making it challenging to control side reactions such as cracking and excessive oxidation. Mild oxidants like CO2 are preferred as they can improve catalyst activity without the risk of over-oxidation. Oxygen is an attractive oxidant for ODHP due to its ability to lower the reaction temperature to around 400°C and make the dehydrogenation reaction exothermic. However, the use of oxygen also introduces new challenges, such as the need to avoid overoxidation of the hydrocarbons in the feed to maintain high olefin selectivity. Carbon dioxide (CO2) is another oxidant that has been investigated for ODHP. CO2 can effectively consume hydrogen under dehydrogenation conditions, but it does not provide enough heat to compensate for the endothermic nature of the dehydrogenation reaction. The cofeeding of CO2 can also result in additional coke deposition due to the increased CO and decreased H2 partial pressures brought about by the reverse water-gas shift reaction. Moreover, CO2 competitively adsorbs on the surface, specifically on the basic sites of the catalyst materials, which can negatively affect their performance.

Current propylene production methods, such as fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) and steam cracking, have limitations, including high operating temperatures, high costs of precious metal catalysts, and catalyst deactivation due to coke formation and spatial separation of active species. Propane oxidative dehydrogenation (ODHP) addresses these issues by potentially reducing the reaction temperature due to its exothermic nature. However, ODHP presents its own set of challenges, particularly in controlling the fate of propylene due to the risk of overoxidation to carbon monoxide and dioxide, which significantly lowers propylene selectivity. The selection of oxidant is crucial, with carbon dioxide (CO2) being a preferred alternative to oxygen due to its potential to avoid deep oxidation, reduce coke formation, and favor propane conversion.

The primary challenges in current propylene production methods include endothermic reactions, coke production, and thermodynamic constraints limiting alkane conversion in dehydrogenation (DH). Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODP) addresses these issues by enabling lower reaction temperatures and more effective inhibition of surface coke formation. However, ODP presents its own set of advantages and limitations, particularly in the context of oxidant selection. Using oxygen as an oxidant in ODP allows for lower reaction temperatures and reduced coke formation, but it also results in low propylene selectivity due to the total oxidation of propane and propylene at high conversion rates. This highlights the need for a selective catalyst in the ODP process.

The conventional methods of producing propylene, such as catalytic and steam cracking, do not meet the increasing demand for propylene. Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is receiving attention as an alternative method. Direct catalytic dehydrogenation of hydrocarbons has low conversion per pass and low yields due to equilibrium limitations. The process is endothermic and the thermodynamic equilibrium is unfavorable. Temperatures above 800 K are required for commercially feasible conversions. At these temperatures, undesirable side reactions limit the propylene yield and coke formation necessitates frequent catalyst regeneration. Catalytic oxidative dehydrogenation of propane by oxygen is an attractive alternative because it is an exothermic and nonthermodynamically limited reaction. However, the propylene selectivity of the reaction remains an unsolved problem owing to the over oxidation of propane. On the other hand, soft oxidants such as carbon dioxide appear as potential alternatives. The PDH in the presence of carbon dioxide (CO2PDH) is also of interest because it utilizes the greenhouse gas CO2. CO2 is a coke removing agent as well. The promoting effect of CO2 is explained either by consumption of the hydrogen in the reverse watergas shift reaction, which shifts the equilibrium of propane dehydrogenation to completion (twostep pathway) or its participation in direct oxidation of propane to propylene (onestep pathway). The oxide catalysts which are active in the nonoxidative dehydrogenation of propane are also active in the process with CO2. Propane dehydrogenation with carbon dioxide is characterized by rapid catalyst deactivation due to coke formation.

Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by requiring less energy, not needing catalyst regeneration, and overcoming thermodynamic limitations. However, the use of oxygen as an oxidant in ODHP can lead to process flammability and over-oxidation, resulting in poor selectivity. Carbon dioxide, as a soft oxidant, is safer, milder, and more readily available, and its use can mitigate these challenges.

The primary challenges in current propylene production methods, such as steam cracking and fluid-catalytic-cracking (FCC), include the mismatch between the growing demand for propylene, especially in Western Europe, and the production capacity that favors ethylene over propylene. Additionally, dehydrogenation processes are limited by thermodynamic constraints that restrict alkane conversion, and coking can cause rapid catalyst deactivation. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by offering a route to produce propylene directly from propane, which can potentially match the market demand more closely. The process is exothermal, which improves energy efficiency compared to endothermal dehydrogenation and cracking processes. However, ODHP also presents its own set of advantages and limitations. The use of oxygen as an oxidant in ODHP can lead to higher energy losses due to the difference in combustion heat between the feed and the product, resulting in higher fixed costs. Moreover, the production of CO2, a main by-product in alkane ODH, adds to the environmental and economic considerations.

The primary challenges in current propylene production methods, such as steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking, include high energy consumption, significant greenhouse gas emissions, and the production of a wide range of co-products, which can dilute the efficiency of propylene production. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by offering a more direct route to propylene production with potentially lower energy requirements and fewer co-products. However, ODHP presents its own set of advantages and limitations, particularly in the context of oxidant selection. Using oxygen as an oxidant in ODHP can lead to higher propylene yields due to the direct conversion of propane to propylene and carbon dioxide. However, the use of oxygen also presents challenges, such as the risk of deep oxidation to carbon dioxide and the need for oxygen separation from air, which can be energy-intensive. The selection of oxygen as an oxidant must balance the advantages of higher propylene yields with the limitations of potential over-oxidation and the energy costs associated with oxygen production.

However, oxygen also poses challenges, such as the risk of deep oxidation, resulting in the formation of carbon dioxide and water instead of the desired propylene. Oxygen's high reactivity can also lead to the rapid deactivation of catalysts, necessitating the development of robust and selective catalysts. The selection of the oxidant is crucial in ODHP, as it significantly influences the reaction pathway, product selectivity, and catalyst stability. Nitrous oxide (N2O) has been shown to be a promising alternative oxidant, offering higher propylene selectivity and lower catalyst deactivation rates compared to oxygen. However, the use of N2O also presents its own challenges, such as higher production costs and potential environmental concerns due to its greenhouse gas properties.

The primary challenges in current propylene production methods are not explicitly stated in the literature. However, oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) is presented as an alternative method to overcome the equilibrium limitation of the dehydrogenation reaction. The use of SO2 as an oxidant in ODHP offers an advantage over conventional methods, particularly at high temperatures where there is an appreciable increase in selectivity per pass. However, the addition of SO2 to the feed increases the conversion of propane, but the selectivities to propylene are lower than those obtained with pure propane feed. The literature does not discuss the specific challenges associated with using oxygen as an oxidant in ODHP.

Current propylene production methods, primarily through steam and fluidized crackers, are expected to be insufficient to meet the rapidly growing demand for propylene. This necessitates the development of more economic and purposeful production techniques. Direct dehydrogenation of propane (DDP) is thermodynamically limited and highly endothermic, requiring temperatures that may exceed 973 K for significant propylene yields. The introduction of CO2 as a mild oxidant in the feedstock can alter the dehydrogenation pathway by oxidizing the abstracted hydrogen from the alkane, releasing the heat of reaction and thus reducing operating temperatures. CO2 can also increase the equilibrium conversion of propane by consuming H2 through the reverse water gas shift reaction. Unlike regular oxidative dehydrogenation with molecular oxygen, CO2 as a mild oxidant suppresses over-oxidation, minimizing the production of carbon oxides.

The primary challenges in current propylene production methods, particularly through the dehydrogenation of propane, include side reactions, thermodynamic constraints on selectivity and conversion, the endothermic nature of the process requiring high energy input, and coke formation leading to catalytic deactivation. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by adding an oxidant to the reaction feed, initiating the reaction through the oxidant rather than solely relying on high temperatures. This modification can potentially overcome limitations such as endothermic nature and coke formation. However, using oxygen as an oxidant presents its own set of challenges, including the overoxidation of olefins to CO and CO2 and the possibility of reaction runaway. To mitigate these issues, catalysts have been investigated, with supported vanadium-based oxides and mixed-metal oxides being extensively studied due to their high thermal stability, large surface areas, and favorable reducibility and basicity. Despite these efforts, no catalytic system has yet achieved product yields comparable to current industrial technologies for olefin production.

ODHP also presents process simplicity as an advantage. However, ODHP presents its own set of challenges, particularly in the context of oxidant selection. The use of oxygen as an oxidant can lead to over-oxidation to carbon oxides of both the fed paraffins and produced olefins, limiting the selectivity to olefins. The use of CO2 as a mild oxidant has been proposed to mitigate this issue, as it can turn the process towards an exothermic character and potentially have positive effects on catalyst coking.

The primary challenges in current propylene production methods, such as steam cracking and fluid-catalytic-cracking (FCC), include the mismatch between the growing demand for propylene, especially in Western Europe, and the production capacity that favors ethylene over propylene. Additionally, dehydrogenation processes are limited by thermodynamic constraints that restrict alkane conversion, and coking can cause rapid catalyst deactivation. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by offering a route to produce propylene directly from propane, which can potentially match the market demand more closely. The process is exothermal, which improves energy efficiency compared to endothermal dehydrogenation and cracking processes. However, ODHP also presents its own set of advantages and limitations. The use of oxygen as an oxidant in ODHP can lead to higher energy losses due to the difference in combustion heat between the feed and the product, resulting in higher fixed costs. Moreover, the production of CO2, a main by-product in alkane ODH, adds to the environmental and economic considerations.

The primary challenges in current propylene production methods are not explicitly stated in the literature. However, oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) is presented as an alternative method to overcome the equilibrium limitation of the dehydrogenation reaction. The use of SO2 as an oxidant in ODHP offers an advantage over conventional methods, particularly at high temperatures where there is an appreciable increase in selectivity per pass. However, the addition of SO2 to the feed increases the conversion of propane, but the selectivities to propylene are lower than those obtained with pure propane feed. The literature does not discuss the specific challenges associated with using oxygen as an oxidant in ODHP.

Current propylene production methods, primarily through steam and fluidized crackers, are expected to be insufficient to meet the rapidly growing demand for propylene. This necessitates the development of more economic and purposeful production techniques. Direct dehydrogenation of propane (DDP) is thermodynamically limited and highly endothermic, requiring temperatures that may exceed 973 K for significant propylene yields. The introduction of CO2 as a mild oxidant in the feedstock can alter the dehydrogenation pathway by oxidizing the abstracted hydrogen from the alkane, releasing the heat of reaction and thus reducing operating temperatures. CO2 can also increase the equilibrium conversion of propane by consuming H2 through the reverse water gas shift reaction. Unlike regular oxidative dehydrogenation with molecular oxygen, CO2 as a mild oxidant suppresses over-oxidation, minimizing the production of carbon oxides.

The primary challenges in current propylene production methods, particularly through the dehydrogenation of propane, include side reactions, thermodynamic constraints on selectivity and conversion, the endothermic nature of the process requiring high energy input, and coke formation leading to catalytic deactivation. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by adding an oxidant to the reaction feed, initiating the reaction through the oxidant rather than solely relying on high temperatures. This modification can potentially overcome limitations such as endothermic nature and coke formation. However, using oxygen as an oxidant presents its own set of challenges, including the overoxidation of olefins to CO and CO2 and the possibility of reaction runaway. To mitigate these issues, catalysts have been investigated, with supported vanadium-based oxides and mixed-metal oxides being extensively studied due to their high thermal stability, large surface areas, and favorable reducibility and basicity. Despite these efforts, no catalytic system has yet achieved product yields comparable to current industrial technologies for olefin production.

ODHP presents advantages over non-oxidative propane dehydrogenation due to favorable thermodynamics, including exothermic reactions at lower temperatures, and enhanced catalyst stability by preventing coke deposition on the catalyst surface. However, ODHP also presents the challenge of preventing the over-oxidation of propene to CO and CO2, which are more thermodynamically stable.

The primary challenges in current propylene production methods, such as steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking, include high energy consumption, low selectivity towards propylene, and reliance on dwindling petroleum reserves.

Oxygen is a preferred oxidant due to its ability to promote selectivity for propene, but the unselective combustion reactions limit alkene selectivities. The use of oxygen also leads to extensive selectivity losses with increasing conversion, due to propene re-adsorption and subsequent oxidation to carbon oxides, resulting in propene yields lower than 30%.

The primary challenges in current propylene production methods, such as steam cracking (SC) and fluidic catalytic cracking (FCC), include low selectivity and yields for propylene, as it is produced as a by-product. The increasing use of ethane in steam crackers has led to a decline in the propylene/ethylene production ratio, while the demand for propylene is increasing due to the expanding polypropylene market. Propane dehydrogenation is limited by thermodynamics, requiring very high reaction temperatures for high single-pass propane conversion, which complicates the separation of hydrogen and unreacted propane from propylene. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by potentially offering higher propylene yields and selectivity, but it is limited by the consecutive oxidation of propylene to oxygenated products, resulting in a maximum reported yield of about 30%. The selection of oxidants is crucial, as F2 is inappropriate due to its high reactivity and unfavorable thermodynamics, Cl2 reactions are fast and non-selective, and I2 reactions are selective but slow and only thermodynamically favorable at high temperatures. Bromine reactions with propane are more feasible, but resolving the polyhalogenation selectivity issue requires a higher propane to bromine ratio, limiting single-pass propane conversion.

The primary challenges in current propylene production methods, such as steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking, are their high energy consumption and the requirement for large-scale centralized plants, which limits the utilization of natural gas reserves in remote areas. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by offering a potentially more energy-efficient and decentralized process. However, ODHP presents its own set of advantages and limitations, particularly in the context of oxidant selection. Using oxygen as an oxidant can lead to side reactions such as cracking and combustion, which can limit the selectivity and yield of propylene. The specific challenges associated with using oxygen include the need for catalysts that can efficiently activate propane under mild conditions while suppressing over-oxidation and side reactions, control selectivity, as well as the management of the exothermic nature of the reaction to prevent overheating and ensure safety. The weaker CH and CC bonds in propane compared to ethane make selectivity control a greater challenge in ODHP.

The demand for propene is growing, and current sources such as steam cracking and catalytic cracking may not meet this demand without negatively impacting the production of other valuable co-products. Selective processes dedicated solely to propene synthesis, such as propane dehydrogenation, may gain significance. Oxidative dehydrogenation processes, including ODHP, can offer higher per-pass conversion of propane and yield of propene compared to non-oxidative dehydrogenation. The use of CO2 in the process can be an attractive way for chemical CO2 utilisation, producing hydrogen and carbon monoxide (syngas) as by-products. However, the literature does not delve into the specific challenges associated with using oxygen as an oxidant in ODHP.

The primary challenges in current propylene production methods include the difficulty in achieving both high propane conversion and high propylene selectivity simultaneously. Propylene is more susceptible to oxidation than propane, leading to a rapid decline in selectivity as conversion increases. At temperatures above 700 degrees Celsius, propane cracking becomes significant, resulting in the production of various products other than propylene. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by potentially offering higher conversion levels and selectivity to propylene compared to traditional dehydrogenation methods. However, ODHP presents its own set of challenges, particularly in maintaining selectivity as conversion increases, due to the higher reactivity of propylene compared to propane. Additionally, at higher temperatures, propane cracking becomes more significant, leading to the production of various by-products other than propylene. The selection of oxidant is also a critical factor, with oxygen presenting safety concerns and process upsets that need to be addressed.

The primary challenges in current propylene production methods, such as steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking, include high energy consumption, high capital and operating costs, environmental issues due to greenhouse gas emissions, and the production of byproducts that reduce the overall yield of propylene. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by offering a potentially more energy-efficient, cost-effective, and selective process for propylene production. The use of carbon dioxide (CO2) as an oxidant in ODHP can further reduce costs, lower greenhouse gas emissions, save energy compared to traditional steam cracking, and promote selective dehydrogenation without the risk of over-oxidation. However, the use of oxygen as an oxidant in ODHP presents challenges due to the over-oxidation of propane to carbon dioxide, which decreases the selectivity for propylene. The choice of oxidant is crucial in determining the selectivity and yield of propylene in ODHP processes.

The current methods of propylene production, such as steam cracking, fluid catalytic cracking, and direct dehydrogenation of propane, face challenges including a supply deficit due to high market demand, endothermicity-induced thermodynamic limits for propane conversion, and rapid catalyst deactivation due to coke formation. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) is advantageous because it is exothermic, which eliminates thermodynamic constraints at lower temperatures. However, the use of oxygen as an oxidant in ODHP can lead to overoxidation of olefins to carbon oxides, resulting in inefficient reactant use and low process selectivity.

The primary challenges in current propylene production methods, such as steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking (FCC), include high energy demands, low selectivity towards propylene, dwindling petroleum reserves, and rising oil prices. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by offering a more economical feedstock (propane) and potentially more efficient conversion technologies. However, ODHP presents its own set of advantages and limitations, particularly in the context of oxidant selection. The use of oxygen as an oxidant risks combusting the hydrocarbon reactants and products, making it challenging to control side reactions such as cracking and excessive oxidation. Mild oxidants like CO2 are preferred as they can improve catalyst activity without the risk of over-oxidation. Oxygen is an attractive oxidant for ODHP due to its ability to lower the reaction temperature to around 400°C and make the dehydrogenation reaction exothermic. However, the use of oxygen also introduces new challenges, such as the need to avoid overoxidation of the hydrocarbons in the feed to maintain high olefin selectivity. Carbon dioxide (CO2) is another oxidant that has been investigated for ODHP. CO2 can effectively consume hydrogen under dehydrogenation conditions, but it does not provide enough heat to compensate for the endothermic nature of the dehydrogenation reaction. The cofeeding of CO2 can also result in additional coke deposition due to the increased CO and decreased H2 partial pressures brought about by the reverse water-gas shift reaction. Moreover, CO2 competitively adsorbs on the surface, specifically on the basic sites of the catalyst materials, which can negatively affect their performance.

Current propylene production methods, such as fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) and steam cracking, have limitations, including high operating temperatures, high costs of precious metal catalysts, and catalyst deactivation due to coke formation and spatial separation of active species. Propane oxidative dehydrogenation (ODHP) addresses these issues by potentially reducing the reaction temperature due to its exothermic nature. However, ODHP presents its own set of challenges, particularly in controlling the fate of propylene due to the risk of overoxidation to carbon monoxide and dioxide, which significantly lowers propylene selectivity. The selection of oxidant is crucial, with carbon dioxide (CO2) being a preferred alternative to oxygen due to its potential to avoid deep oxidation, reduce coke formation, and favor propane conversion.

The primary challenges in current propylene production methods include endothermic reactions, coke production, and thermodynamic constraints limiting alkane conversion in dehydrogenation (DH). Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODP) addresses these issues by enabling lower reaction temperatures and more effective inhibition of surface coke formation. However, ODP presents its own set of advantages and limitations, particularly in the context of oxidant selection. Using oxygen as an oxidant in ODP allows for lower reaction temperatures and reduced coke formation, but it also results in low propylene selectivity due to the total oxidation of propane and propylene at high conversion rates. This highlights the need for a selective catalyst in the ODP process.

The conventional methods of producing propylene, such as catalytic and steam cracking, do not meet the increasing demand for propylene. Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is receiving attention as an alternative method. Direct catalytic dehydrogenation of hydrocarbons has low conversion per pass and low yields due to equilibrium limitations. The process is endothermic and the thermodynamic equilibrium is unfavorable. Temperatures above 800 K are required for commercially feasible conversions. At these temperatures, undesirable side reactions limit the propylene yield and coke formation necessitates frequent catalyst regeneration. Catalytic oxidative dehydrogenation of propane by oxygen is an attractive alternative because it is an exothermic and nonthermodynamically limited reaction. However, the propylene selectivity of the reaction remains an unsolved problem owing to the over oxidation of propane. On the other hand, soft oxidants such as carbon dioxide appear as potential alternatives. The PDH in the presence of carbon dioxide (CO2PDH) is also of interest because it utilizes the greenhouse gas CO2. CO2 is a coke removing agent as well. The promoting effect of CO2 is explained either by consumption of the hydrogen in the reverse watergas shift reaction, which shifts the equilibrium of propane dehydrogenation to completion (twostep pathway) or its participation in direct oxidation of propane to propylene (onestep pathway). The oxide catalysts which are active in the nonoxidative dehydrogenation of propane are also active in the process with CO2. Propane dehydrogenation with carbon dioxide is characterized by rapid catalyst deactivation due to coke formation.

The primary challenges in current propylene production methods, such as steam cracking and propane dehydrogenation, include high energy requirements, catalyst regeneration needs, and thermodynamic limitations. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by requiring less energy, not needing catalyst regeneration, and overcoming thermodynamic limitations.

The primary challenges in current propylene production methods, such as steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking, are their high energy consumption and the requirement for large-scale centralized plants, which limits the utilization of natural gas reserves in remote areas. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by offering a potentially more energy-efficient and decentralized process. However, ODHP presents its own set of advantages and limitations, particularly in the context of oxidant selection. Using oxygen as an oxidant can lead to side reactions such as cracking and combustion, which can limit the selectivity and yield of propylene. The specific challenges associated with using oxygen include the need for catalysts that can efficiently activate propane under mild conditions while suppressing over-oxidation and side reactions, control selectivity, as well as the management of the exothermic nature of the reaction to prevent overheating and ensure safety. The weaker CH and CC bonds in propane compared to ethane make selectivity control a greater challenge in ODHP.

The demand for propene is growing, and current sources such as steam cracking and catalytic cracking may not meet this demand without negatively impacting the production of other valuable co-products. Selective processes dedicated solely to propene synthesis, such as propane dehydrogenation, may gain significance. Oxidative dehydrogenation processes, including ODHP, can offer higher per-pass conversion of propane and yield of propene compared to non-oxidative dehydrogenation. The use of CO2 in the process can be an attractive way for chemical CO2 utilisation, producing hydrogen and carbon monoxide (syngas) as by-products. However, the literature does not delve into the specific challenges associated with using oxygen as an oxidant in ODHP.

The primary challenges in current propylene production methods include the difficulty in achieving both high propane conversion and high propylene selectivity simultaneously. Propylene is more susceptible to oxidation than propane, leading to a rapid decline in selectivity as conversion increases. At temperatures above 700 degrees Celsius, propane cracking becomes significant, resulting in the production of various products other than propylene. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by potentially offering higher conversion levels and selectivity to propylene compared to traditional dehydrogenation methods. However, ODHP presents its own set of challenges, particularly in maintaining selectivity as conversion increases, due to the higher reactivity of propylene compared to propane. Additionally, at higher temperatures, propane cracking becomes more significant, leading to the production of various by-products other than propylene. The selection of oxidant is also a critical factor, with oxygen presenting safety concerns and process upsets that need to be addressed.

The primary challenges in current propylene production methods, such as steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking, include high energy consumption, high capital and operating costs, environmental issues due to greenhouse gas emissions, and the production of byproducts that reduce the overall yield of propylene. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by offering a potentially more energy-efficient, cost-effective, and selective process for propylene production. The use of carbon dioxide (CO2) as an oxidant in ODHP can further reduce costs, lower greenhouse gas emissions, save energy compared to traditional steam cracking, and promote selective dehydrogenation without the risk of over-oxidation. However, the use of oxygen as an oxidant in ODHP presents challenges due to the over-oxidation of propane to carbon dioxide, which decreases the selectivity for propylene. The choice of oxidant is crucial in determining the selectivity and yield of propylene in ODHP processes.

The current methods of propylene production, such as steam cracking, fluid catalytic cracking, and direct dehydrogenation of propane, face challenges including a supply deficit due to high market demand, endothermicity-induced thermodynamic limits for propane conversion, and rapid catalyst deactivation due to coke formation. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) is advantageous because it is exothermic, which eliminates thermodynamic constraints at lower temperatures. However, the use of oxygen as an oxidant in ODHP can lead to overoxidation of olefins to carbon oxides, resulting in inefficient reactant use and low process selectivity.

The primary challenges in current propylene production methods, such as steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking (FCC), include high energy demands, low selectivity towards propylene, dwindling petroleum reserves, and rising oil prices. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by offering a more economical feedstock (propane) and potentially more efficient conversion technologies. However, ODHP presents its own set of advantages and limitations, particularly in the context of oxidant selection. The use of oxygen as an oxidant risks combusting the hydrocarbon reactants and products, making it challenging to control side reactions such as cracking and excessive oxidation. Mild oxidants like CO2 are preferred as they can improve catalyst activity without the risk of over-oxidation. Oxygen is an attractive oxidant for ODHP due to its ability to lower the reaction temperature to around 400°C and make the dehydrogenation reaction exothermic. However, the use of oxygen also introduces new challenges, such as the need to avoid overoxidation of the hydrocarbons in the feed to maintain high olefin selectivity. Carbon dioxide (CO2) is another oxidant that has been investigated for ODHP. CO2 can effectively consume hydrogen under dehydrogenation conditions, but it does not provide enough heat to compensate for the endothermic nature of the dehydrogenation reaction. The cofeeding of CO2 can also result in additional coke deposition due to the increased CO and decreased H2 partial pressures brought about by the reverse water-gas shift reaction. Moreover, CO2 competitively adsorbs on the surface, specifically on the basic sites of the catalyst materials, which can negatively affect their performance.

Current propylene production methods, such as fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) and steam cracking, have limitations, including high operating temperatures, high costs of precious metal catalysts, and catalyst deactivation due to coke formation and spatial separation of active species. Propane oxidative dehydrogenation (ODHP) addresses these issues by potentially reducing the reaction temperature due to its exothermic nature. However, ODHP presents its own set of challenges, particularly in controlling the fate of propylene due to the risk of overoxidation to carbon monoxide and dioxide, which significantly lowers propylene selectivity. The selection of oxidant is crucial, with carbon dioxide (CO2) being a preferred alternative to oxygen due to its potential to avoid deep oxidation, reduce coke formation, and favor propane conversion.

The primary challenges in current propylene production methods include endothermic reactions, coke production, and thermodynamic constraints limiting alkane conversion in dehydrogenation (DH). Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODP) addresses these issues by enabling lower reaction temperatures and more effective inhibition of surface coke formation. However, ODP presents its own set of advantages and limitations, particularly in the context of oxidant selection. Using oxygen as an oxidant in ODP allows for lower reaction temperatures and reduced coke formation, but it also results in low propylene selectivity due to the total oxidation of propane and propylene at high conversion rates. This highlights the need for a selective catalyst in the ODP process.

The conventional methods of producing propylene, such as catalytic and steam cracking, do not meet the increasing demand for propylene. Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is receiving attention as an alternative method. Direct catalytic dehydrogenation of hydrocarbons has low conversion per pass and low yields due to equilibrium limitations. The process is endothermic and the thermodynamic equilibrium is unfavorable. Temperatures above 800 K are required for commercially feasible conversions. At these temperatures, undesirable side reactions limit the propylene yield and coke formation necessitates frequent catalyst regeneration. Catalytic oxidative dehydrogenation of propane by oxygen is an attractive alternative because it is an exothermic and nonthermodynamically limited reaction. However, the propylene selectivity of the reaction remains an unsolved problem owing to the over oxidation of propane. On the other hand, soft oxidants such as carbon dioxide appear as potential alternatives. The PDH in the presence of carbon dioxide (CO2PDH) is also of interest because it utilizes the greenhouse gas CO2. CO2 is a coke removing agent as well. The promoting effect of CO2 is explained either by consumption of the hydrogen in the reverse watergas shift reaction, which shifts the equilibrium of propane dehydrogenation to completion (twostep pathway) or its participation in direct oxidation of propane to propylene (onestep pathway). The oxide catalysts which are active in the nonoxidative dehydrogenation of propane are also active in the process with CO2. Propane dehydrogenation with carbon dioxide is characterized by rapid catalyst deactivation due to coke formation.

The primary challenges in current propylene production methods, such as steam cracking and propane dehydrogenation, include high energy requirements, catalyst regeneration needs, and thermodynamic limitations. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by requiring less energy, not needing catalyst regeneration, and overcoming thermodynamic limitations. However, the use of oxygen as an oxidant in ODHP can lead to process flammability and over-oxidation, resulting in poor selectivity. Carbon dioxide, as a soft oxidant, is safer, milder, and more readily available, and its use can mitigate these challenges.

The primary challenges in current propylene production methods, such as steam cracking and fluid-catalytic-cracking (FCC), include the mismatch between the growing demand for propylene, especially in Western Europe, and the production capacity that favors ethylene over propylene. Additionally, dehydrogenation processes are limited by thermodynamic constraints that restrict alkane conversion, and coking can cause rapid catalyst deactivation. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by offering a route to produce propylene directly from propane, which can potentially match the market demand more closely. The process is exothermal, which improves energy efficiency compared to endothermal dehydrogenation and cracking processes. However, ODHP also presents its own set of advantages and limitations. The use of oxygen as an oxidant in ODHP can lead to higher energy losses due to the difference in combustion heat between the feed and the product, resulting in higher fixed costs. Moreover, the production of CO2, a main by-product in alkane ODH, adds to the environmental and economic considerations.

The primary challenges in current propylene production methods, such as steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking, include high energy consumption, significant greenhouse gas emissions, and the production of a wide range of co-products, which can dilute the efficiency of propylene production. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by offering a more direct route to propylene production with potentially lower energy requirements and fewer co-products. However, ODHP presents its own set of advantages and limitations, particularly in the context of oxidant selection. Using oxygen as an oxidant in ODHP can lead to higher propylene yields due to the direct conversion of propane to propylene and carbon dioxide. However, the use of oxygen also presents challenges, such as the risk of deep oxidation to carbon dioxide and the need for oxygen separation from air, which can be energy-intensive. The selection of oxygen as an oxidant must balance the advantages of higher propylene yields with the limitations of potential over-oxidation and the energy costs associated with oxygen production.

However, the use of oxygen also poses challenges, such as the risk of deep oxidation to carbon dioxide and the need for oxygen separation from air, which can be energy-intensive. In contrast, using nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant can improve propene selectivity and reduce the risk of deep oxidation, but it may result in lower activity due to slower reoxidation of the catalyst. The primary challenges in current propylene production methods, such as steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking, include high energy consumption, significant greenhouse gas emissions, and the requirement for large-scale infrastructure. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by offering a more energy-efficient and potentially cleaner alternative. However, ODHP presents its own set of advantages and limitations, particularly in the context of oxidant selection. Using oxygen as an oxidant in ODHP can lead to higher propylene yields due to its higher reactivity compared to other oxidants. However, oxygen also poses challenges, such as the risk of deep oxidation, resulting in the formation of carbon dioxide and water instead of the desired propylene. Oxygen's high reactivity can also lead to the rapid deactivation of catalysts, necessitating the development of robust and selective catalysts. The selection of the oxidant is crucial in ODHP, as it significantly influences the reaction pathway, product selectivity, and catalyst stability. Nitrous oxide (N2O) has been shown to be a promising alternative oxidant, offering higher propylene selectivity and lower catalyst deactivation rates compared to oxygen. However, the use of N2O also presents its own challenges, such as higher production costs and potential environmental concerns due to its greenhouse gas properties.

The primary challenges in current propylene production methods are not explicitly stated in the literature. However, oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) is presented as an alternative method to overcome the equilibrium limitation of the dehydrogenation reaction. The use of SO2 as an oxidant in ODHP offers an advantage over conventional methods, particularly at high temperatures where there is an appreciable increase in selectivity per pass. However, the addition of SO2 to the feed increases the conversion of propane, but the selectivities to propylene are lower than those obtained with pure propane feed. The literature does not discuss the specific challenges associated with using oxygen as an oxidant in ODHP.

Current propylene production methods, primarily through steam and fluidized crackers, are expected to be insufficient to meet the rapidly growing demand for propylene. This necessitates the development of more economic and purposeful production techniques. Direct dehydrogenation of propane (DDP) is thermodynamically limited and highly endothermic, requiring temperatures that may exceed 973 K for significant propylene yields. The introduction of CO2 as a mild oxidant in the feedstock can alter the dehydrogenation pathway by oxidizing the abstracted hydrogen from the alkane, releasing the heat of reaction and thus reducing operating temperatures. CO2 can also increase the equilibrium conversion of propane by consuming H2 through the reverse water gas shift reaction. Unlike regular oxidative dehydrogenation with molecular oxygen, CO2 as a mild oxidant suppresses over-oxidation, minimizing the production of carbon oxides.

The primary challenges in current propylene production methods, particularly through the dehydrogenation of propane, include side reactions, thermodynamic constraints on selectivity and conversion, the endothermic nature of the process requiring high energy input, and coke formation leading to catalytic deactivation. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by adding an oxidant to the reaction feed, initiating the reaction through the oxidant rather than solely relying on high temperatures. This modification can potentially overcome limitations such as endothermic nature and coke formation. However, using oxygen as an oxidant presents its own set of challenges, including the overoxidation of olefins to CO and CO2 and the possibility of reaction runaway. To mitigate these issues, catalysts have been investigated, with supported vanadium-based oxides and mixed-metal oxides being extensively studied due to their high thermal stability, large surface areas, and favorable reducibility and basicity. Despite these efforts, no catalytic system has yet achieved product yields comparable to current industrial technologies for olefin production.

The primary challenges in current propylene production methods, which are based on non-oxidative processing of petroleum-based materials, include high costs and sustainability issues. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by offering higher energy efficiency, as it is an exothermic process, unlike dehydrogenation and cracking which are endothermic. ODHP also presents process simplicity as an advantage. However, ODHP presents its own set of challenges, particularly in the context of oxidant selection. The use of oxygen as an oxidant can lead to over-oxidation to carbon oxides of both the fed paraffins and produced olefins, limiting the selectivity to olefins. The use of CO2 as a mild oxidant has been proposed to mitigate this issue, as it can turn the process towards an exothermic character and potentially have positive effects on catalyst coking.
