[1] "The oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) is a contemporary example of such a challenging reaction. While propene is conventionally produced via steam cracking of large hydrocarbons in naphtha, the more recent trend to use shale gas as feeds to steam cracker units greatly increases the availability of low-cost ethene but also results in a gap between demand and supply of propene, as well as other higher olefins (2, 3). This disparity motivates the exploration of on-purpose propene technologies."
          [2] "Despite non-oxidative propane dehydrogenation being the emerging technology used today, ODHP has the potential to improve reaction efficiency over its non-oxidative counterpart because of favorable thermodynamics (exothermic, lower reaction temperatures) and enhanced catalyst stability (prevention of coke deposition on the catalyst surface)."
          [3] "The key scientific challenge that must be overcome remains,however, the prevention of the facile over-oxidation of propene product into more thermodynamically stable CO and CO2 (COx)."

[1] "Most of the current propylene production is performed by steam cracking (SC) and fluidic catalytic cracking (FCC).1 However, in both the SC and FCC processes, propylene is produced as a by-product and the selectivity and yields are always low.2 The availability of ethane as a major component of natural gas at natural gas prices has attracted many ethylene producers to utilize ethane instead of naphtha as the feedstock in steam crackers. As a result, the ratio of propylene/ethylene produced from steam crackers continues to decline. At the same time, driven by the expanding polypropylene market, the demand ratio of propylene/ethylene is increasing. For these reasons, it becomes increasingly important to develop on-purpose propylene production technologies that offer higher propylene/ethylene production ratios.1 Propane dehydrogenation has long been thought to be an ideal route for propylene production because of the theoretical high propylene selectivity and low capital investment, as well as the independence of the propylene production cost to naphtha price."
          [2] "Propane dehydrogenation is limited by thermodynamics, so that very high reaction temperatures on the order of 1000K are required to give a high single-pass propane conversion.2,4 Hence, the separation of the resulting hydrogen and unreacted propane from propylene becomes an issue."
          [3] "Theoretically, introducing an oxidant can drive the reaction to be more thermodynamically favorable. However, the highest propylene yield reported for propane oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) is only about 30%, owing mainly to the consecutive oxidation of propylene to oxygenated products.2,5 The oxidative dehydrogenation pathways to produce diolefins and aromatics suffer from the same issue."
          [4] "Although many different catalysts, promoters and alternative oxidants have been studied,2,5,6 a commercially viable breakthrough has yet to be achieved."
          [5] "Among the halogens, F2 is inappropriate because of its high reactivity and the unfavorable thermodynamics for its use in a halogenationdehydrohalogenation process. Similarly, Cl2 reactions with alkanes are always fast and non-selective, and under some conditions an explosion may occur.9 I2 reacts selectively, but relatively slowly, with propane at low temperatures to produce propyl iodides and propylene. High propylene yields can be achieved with stoichiometric I2 and propane feeding.10 However, this reaction is only thermodynamically favorable at high temperatures (FigureS1). Furthermore, as a stoichiometric reaction of I2 with propane is needed, the recycling efficiency of the relatively expensive I2 greatly limits the potential industrial application of this process.11"
          [6] "Compared to chlorine and iodine, reactions of bromine with propane are more feasible. However, to resolve the polyhalogenation selectivity issue in gaseous alkane bromination processes, a higher propane to bromine ratio is required to avoid the formation of 2,2-C3H6Br2.7 Consequently, single-pass propane conversion, using present technology, has limited utility."





Propane oxydehydrogenation combining high propane conversion and high propylene selectivity has proved an elusive goal, and propane oxydehydrogenation as a route to propylene appears to be far from realizing its commercialization potential. One difficulty is that propylene is more easily oxidized than is propane, so that selectivity tends to decline rapidly with conversion. Another is that at temperatures above about 700 C, propane cracking becomes significant, and a variety of products other than propylene are produced.

[1] "Propane direct dehydrogenation (DH) as well as oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) have attracted worldwide academic and industrial interests, but both suffer from limitations that have been reviewed extensively elsewhere1-3."
          [2] "Propane DH is an endothermic reaction and thus high temperatures are required to achieve acceptable olefin yields."
          [3] "The CATOFIN dehydrogenation process4-5 provides 850000 MTA (million metric tons annually) of propylene with minimum of 99.5% purity and is based on chromium oxide supported on activated alumina."
          [4] "The Oleflex dehydrogenation process4-5 relies on the traditional Pt/Sn catalytic system to produce polymer grade propylene."
          [5] "The high operating temperature as well as the cost of the Pt catalysts comprise the main drawbacks."
          [6] "In addition,the reaction is usually accompanied by catalyst deactivation due to coke formation and spatial separation of Pt-Sn species thus highlighting the stability of catalysts used among the major botlenecks6-7."
          [7] "On the other hand, although the exothermic character of propane ODH with O2 has the potential to significantly reduce the reaction temperature, the fate of the desired propylene is difficult to be controlled due to unavoidable combustion of propane as well as of propylene to carbon monoxide and/or dioxide thus significantly lowering propylene selectivity."
          [8] "The use of CO2 as, alternative to oxygen, soft oxidant has the potential to i) avoid deep oxidation of alkanes/alkenes, ii) reduce coke formation and iii) favor propane conversion due to participation of the produced hydrogen in the reverse water- gas shift reaction (RWGS)."

[1] "The demand for olefins, especially propylene, is expected to increase significantly in the near future. Steam cracking, Fluid Cat- alytic Cracking (FCC) and dehydrogenation (DH) are the primary methods to obtain olefins. Although these methods are commonly used to produce alkenes, they have some disadvantages: they are endothermic and suffer from the production of coke. In case of DH, alkane conversion is limited by thermodynamic constraints [15]."
          [2] "An attractive alternative to this approach is the oxidative dehy- drogenation of propane (ODP) by molecular oxygen, which enables lower reaction temperatures and more effective inhibition of sur- face coke formation. The primary drawback of this process is a low propylene selectivity due to total oxidation of propane and propylene at high conversion. Thus there is an ongoing search for a selective catalyst in this process."

[1] "Propylene is an important raw material in the production of polypropylene,polyacrylonitrile, acrolein, and acrylic acid. The conventional manufacturing methods such as catalytic and steam cracking which produce propylene as a byproduct do not meet the everincreasing demand. Therefore, propane dehydrogenation (PDH) has received much attention (HeinritzAdrian et al., 2008):"
          [2] "Direct catalytic dehydrogenation of hydrocarbons is characterized by low conversion per pass and low yields due to equilibrium limitation. The process is endothermic and the thermodynamic equilibrium is unfavorable (Olah and Molnar, 2003). Temperatures above 800 K are required for commercially feasible conversions. At these temperatures,undesirable side reactions limit the propylene yield and coke formation necessitates frequent catalyst regeneration."
          [3] "Catalytic oxidative dehydrogenation of propane by oxygen is an attractive alternative because it is an exothermic and nonthermodynamically limited reaction. However, the propylene selectivity of the reaction remains an unsolved problem owing to the over oxidation of propane (Xu et al., 2006)."
          [4] "On the other hand, soft oxidants such as carbon dioxide appear as potential alternatives. The PDH in the presence of carbon dioxide (CO2PDH) is also of interest because it utilizes the greenhouse gas CO2 (Zangeneh et al., 2011)."
          [5] "CO2 is a coke removing agent as well. Bartholomew (1984) reported that oxidizability in the gasification of coke was in the following order: O2(105) > H2O(3) > CO2(1) > H2(0.003), where numbers in parentheses indicate the relative ratios of the gasification with oxidants."
          [6] "The promoting effect of CO2 is explained either by consumption of the hydrogen in the reverse watergas shift reaction  RWGS (reaction 2), which shifts the equilibrium of propane dehydrogenation to completion (twostep pathway) or its participation in direct oxidation of propane to propylene (reaction 3) (onestep pathway):"
          [7] "The oxide catalysts which are active in the nonoxidative dehydrogenation of propane are also active in the process with CO2. Many bulk and supported oxidebased materials containing active species, such as Cr (Michorczyk and Ogonowski, 2003; Michorczyk et al., 2008; Michorczyk et al., 2010; Michorczyk et al., 2011), Ga (Michorczyk et al., 2003; Xu et al., 2006), V (Takahara et al., 2005; Ogonowski and Skrzynska, 2008) and Fe (Michorczyk et al., 2004) have been studied as catalysts for dehydrogenation of propane in the presence of CO2. Among the investigated materials, those containing Cr or Ga were found to be the most active and selective (Michorczyk et al., 2011)."
          [8] "Propane dehydrogenation with carbon dioxide is characterized by rapid catalyst deactivation due to coke formation. Ga2O3 showed drastic deactivation during a few hours on stream (Zheng et al., 2005). Besides coke formation, the reduction of Cr(VI) to Cr(III) is responsible for deactivation of chromium based catalysts (Zhang et al., 2011)."

[1] "On the other hand, oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) provides a favorable alternative due to its low energy requirement, no catalyst regeneration obligation, and the elimination of thermodynamic limitations [4, 5]. However, the presence of O2 in the ODH process may lead to the process flammability and the production of carbon oxides due to over-oxidation resulting in poor process selectivity [6, 7]. This problem can be solved by employing a much safer, milder, and readily available carbon dioxide as a soft oxidant."

While propene is conventionally produced via steam cracking of large hydrocarbons in naphtha, the more recent trend to use shale gas as feeds to steam cracker units greatly increases the availability of low-cost ethene but also results in a gap between demand and supply of propene, as well as other higher olefins (2, 3). This disparity motivates the exploration of on-purpose propene technologies."
          [2] "Despite non-oxidative propane dehydrogenation being the emerging technology used today, ODHP has the potential to improve reaction efficiency over its non-oxidative counterpart because of favorable thermodynamics (exothermic, lower reaction temperatures) and enhanced catalyst stability (prevention of coke deposition on the catalyst surface)."
          [3] "The key scientific challenge that must be overcome remains,however, the prevention of the facile over-oxidation of propene product into more thermodynamically stable CO and CO2 (COx)."

[1] "Most of the current propylene production is performed by steam cracking (SC) and fluidic catalytic cracking (FCC).1 However, in both the SC and FCC processes, propylene is produced as a by-product and the selectivity and yields are always low.2 The availability of ethane as a major component of natural gas at natural gas prices has attracted many ethylene producers to utilize ethane instead of naphtha as the feedstock in steam crackers. As a result, the ratio of propylene/ethylene produced from steam crackers continues to decline. At the same time, driven by the expanding polypropylene market, the demand ratio of propylene/ethylene is increasing. For these reasons, it becomes increasingly important to develop on-purpose propylene production technologies that offer higher propylene/ethylene production ratios.1 Propane dehydrogenation has long been thought to be an ideal route for propylene production because of the theoretical high propylene selectivity and low capital investment, as well as the independence of the propylene production cost to naphtha price."
          [2] "Propane dehydrogenation is limited by thermodynamics, so that very high reaction temperatures on the order of 1000K are required to give a high single-pass propane conversion.2,4 Hence, the separation of the resulting hydrogen and unreacted propane from propylene becomes an issue."
          [3] "Theoretically, introducing an oxidant can drive the reaction to be more thermodynamically favorable. However, the highest propylene yield reported for propane oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) is only about 30%, owing mainly to the consecutive oxidation of propylene to oxygenated products.2,5 The oxidative dehydrogenation pathways to produce diolefins and aromatics suffer from the same issue."
          [4] "Although many different catalysts, promoters and alternative oxidants have been studied,2,5,6 a commercially viable breakthrough has yet to be achieved."
          [5] "Among the halogens, F2 is inappropriate because of its high reactivity and the unfavorable thermodynamics for its use in a halogenationdehydrohalogenation process. Similarly, Cl2 reactions with alkanes are always fast and non-selective, and under some conditions an explosion may occur.9 I2 reacts selectively, but relatively slowly, with propane at low temperatures to produce propyl iodides and propylene. High propylene yields can be achieved with stoichiometric I2 and propane feeding.10 However, this reaction is only thermodynamically favorable at high temperatures (FigureS1). Furthermore, as a stoichiometric reaction of I2 with propane is needed, the recycling efficiency of the relatively expensive I2 greatly limits the potential industrial application of this process.11"
          [6] "Compared to chlorine and iodine, reactions of bromine with propane are more feasible. However, to resolve the polyhalogenation selectivity issue in gaseous alkane bromination processes, a higher propane to bromine ratio is required to avoid the formation of 2,2-C3H6Br2.7 Consequently, single-pass propane conversion, using present technology, has limited utility."





Propane oxydehydrogenation combining high propane conversion and high propylene selectivity has proved an elusive goal, and propane oxydehydrogenation as a route to propylene appears to be far from realizing its commercialization potential. One difficulty is that propylene is more easily oxidized than is propane, so that selectivity tends to decline rapidly with conversion. Another is that at temperatures above about 700 C, propane cracking becomes significant, and a variety of products other than propylene are produced.



[1] "At present, propylene is mainly produced by steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) of naphtha, light diesel, and other oil byproducts, as well as direct dehydrogenation of propane (DHP)."
          [2] "Yet, the dehydrogenation process suffers from two inherent drawbacks: (i) the endothermicity-induced thermodynamic limit for C3H8 conversion that demands high-energy input and (ii) the rapid catalyst deactivation because of coke formation."

[1] "Propane direct dehydrogenation (DH) as well as oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) have attracted worldwide academic and industrial interests, but both suffer from limitations that have been reviewed extensively elsewhere1-3."
          [2] "Propane DH is an endothermic reaction and thus high temperatures are required to achieve acceptable olefin yields."
          [3] "The CATOFIN dehydrogenation process4-5 provides 850000 MTA (million metric tons annually) of propylene with minimum of 99.5% purity and is based on chromium oxide supported on activated alumina."
          [4] "The Oleflex dehydrogenation process4-5 relies on the traditional Pt/Sn catalytic system to produce polymer grade propylene."
          [5] "The high operating temperature as well as the cost of the Pt catalysts comprise the main drawbacks."
          [6] "In addition,the reaction is usually accompanied by catalyst deactivation due to coke formation and spatial separation of Pt-Sn species thus highlighting the stability of catalysts used among the major botlenecks6-7."
          [7] "On the other hand, although the exothermic character of propane ODH with O2 has the potential to significantly reduce the reaction temperature, the fate of the desired propylene is difficult to be controlled due to unavoidable combustion of propane as well as of propylene to carbon monoxide and/or dioxide thus significantly lowering propylene selectivity."
          [8] "The use of CO2 as, alternative to oxygen, soft oxidant has the potential to i) avoid deep oxidation of alkanes/alkenes, ii) reduce coke formation and iii) favor propane conversion due to participation of the produced hydrogen in the reverse water- gas shift reaction (RWGS)."

[1] "The demand for olefins, especially propylene, is expected to increase significantly in the near future. Steam cracking, Fluid Cat- alytic Cracking (FCC) and dehydrogenation (DH) are the primary methods to obtain olefins. Although these methods are commonly used to produce alkenes, they have some disadvantages: they are endothermic and suffer from the production of coke. In case of DH, alkane conversion is limited by thermodynamic constraints [15]."
          [2] "An attractive alternative to this approach is the oxidative dehy- drogenation of propane (ODP) by molecular oxygen, which enables lower reaction temperatures and more effective inhibition of sur- face coke formation. The primary drawback of this process is a low propylene selectivity due to total oxidation of propane and propylene at high conversion. Thus there is an ongoing search for a selective catalyst in this process."

[1] "Propylene is an important raw material in the production of polypropylene,polyacrylonitrile, acrolein, and acrylic acid. The conventional manufacturing methods such as catalytic and steam cracking which produce propylene as a byproduct do not meet the everincreasing demand. Therefore, propane dehydrogenation (PDH) has received much attention (HeinritzAdrian et al., 2008):"
          [2] "Direct catalytic dehydrogenation of hydrocarbons is characterized by low conversion per pass and low yields due to equilibrium limitation. The process is endothermic and the thermodynamic equilibrium is unfavorable (Olah and Molnar, 2003). Temperatures above 800 K are required for commercially feasible conversions. At these temperatures,undesirable side reactions limit the propylene yield and coke formation necessitates frequent catalyst regeneration."
          [3] "Catalytic oxidative dehydrogenation of propane by oxygen is an attractive alternative because it is an exothermic and nonthermodynamically limited reaction. However, the propylene selectivity of the reaction remains an unsolved problem owing to the over oxidation of propane (Xu et al., 2006)."
          [4] "On the other hand, soft oxidants such as carbon dioxide appear as potential alternatives. The PDH in the presence of carbon dioxide (CO2PDH) is also of interest because it utilizes the greenhouse gas CO2 (Zangeneh et al., 2011)."
          [5] "CO2 is a coke removing agent as well. Bartholomew (1984) reported that oxidizability in the gasification of coke was in the following order: O2(105) > H2O(3) > CO2(1) > H2(0.003), where numbers in parentheses indicate the relative ratios of the gasification with oxidants."
          [6] "The promoting effect of CO2 is explained either by consumption of the hydrogen in the reverse watergas shift reaction  RWGS (reaction 2), which shifts the equilibrium of propane dehydrogenation to completion (twostep pathway) or its participation in direct oxidation of propane to propylene (reaction 3) (onestep pathway):"
          [7] "The oxide catalysts which are active in the nonoxidative dehydrogenation of propane are also active in the process with CO2. Many bulk and supported oxidebased materials containing active species, such as Cr (Michorczyk and Ogonowski, 2003; Michorczyk et al., 2008; Michorczyk et al., 2010; Michorczyk et al., 2011), Ga (Michorczyk et al., 2003; Xu et al., 2006), V (Takahara et al., 2005; Ogonowski and Skrzynska, 2008) and Fe (Michorczyk et al., 2004) have been studied as catalysts for dehydrogenation of propane in the presence of CO2. Among the investigated materials, those containing Cr or Ga were found to be the most active and selective (Michorczyk et al., 2011)."
          [8] "Propane dehydrogenation with carbon dioxide is characterized by rapid catalyst deactivation due to coke formation. Ga2O3 showed drastic deactivation during a few hours on stream (Zheng et al., 2005). Besides coke formation, the reduction of Cr(VI) to Cr(III) is responsible for deactivation of chromium based catalysts (Zhang et al., 2011)."

[1] "On the other hand, oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) provides a favorable alternative due to its low energy requirement, no catalyst regeneration obligation, and the elimination of thermodynamic limitations [4, 5]. However, the presence of O2 in the ODH process may lead to the process flammability and the production of carbon oxides due to over-oxidation resulting in poor process selectivity [6, 7]. This problem can be solved by employing a much safer, milder, and readily available carbon dioxide as a soft oxidant."

[1] "In steam cracking, ethylene is the preferred product, but the demand for propylene is growing faster than that for ethylene, especially in Western Europe [1]. Also, in the case of FCC, smaller amounts of propylene are produced."
          [2] "Dehydrogenations thermodynamic constraints limit alkane conversion; furthermore, a major problem is coking, which causes rapid catalyst deactivation."
          [3] "Therefore, the need exists for new technologies devoted to the production of specific olefins, which have none of the disadvantages characterizing dehydrogenation."
          [4] "In fact, the production of chemicals starting from alkanes by means of oxidative processes has been one of the most studied topics in recent decades."
          [5] "The effectiveness of the catalyst, that is the activity for alkane conversion and the selectivity to desired products, will ultimately determine the economic attractiveness of an alkane-based chemical process."
          [6] "The successful commercial technologies will be those that link catalyst performance characteristics with innovative process designs."
          [7] "However, in the case of alkenes produced from alkanes, the lower cost of the feedstock is not a real incentive, since current commercial technologies for olefin production already use fuel-grade feedstocks."
          [8] "In this case, conversely, the improved energy efficiency (ODH is exothermal, while dehydrogenation and cracking are endothermal), and process simplicity are effective incentives."
          [9] "A large number of reviews dealing with the ODH of light alkanes have been published since the early 1990s [421]."
          [10] "In the present review, we attempt to offer an answer to the following questions on the scientific and technological aspects of ethane and propane ODH: Which key factors are the chief determinants of the performance of metal oxide-based catalysts?"
          [11] "Have research efforts led to catalysts that can oxidize alkanes to olefins with yields comparable to those obtained with current technologies for alkenes production?"
          [12] "Does the use of either peculiar reactor configurations (e.g.,membrane-type reactors) or non-conventional methods for the conduction of reactions (e.g., cyclic feeding of reactants) make it possible to improve performances as compared to the traditional configurations?"
          [13] "Furthermore, Lange [3] underlined that more exothermal reactions imply higher energy losses (i.e., the difference between the combustion heat of feed and that of the product) and, hence, higher fixed costs, especially if the production of CO2, the main by-product in alkane ODH, is taken into account."





[1] "The co-production of propylene from steam and fluidized crackers is anticipated to be insufficient to satisfy the rapidly growing demand1. Consequently, there is a need for the development of economic on-purpose production techniques to produce additional propylene."
          [2] "The direct dehydrogenation of propane (DDP) is ther- modynamically limited and is highly endothermic (Î”Hr = 29.70 kcal/mol), requiring temperatures that may exceed 973 K for sig- nificant propylene yields2."
          [3] "In principle, the introduction of CO2 as a mild oxidant into the feed alters the dehydrogenation pathway by oxidizing the abstracted hydrogen from the alkane and conse- quently releasing the heat of reaction that reduces operating temperatures2,3."
          [4] "The presence of CO2 can also increase the equili- brium conversion of propane by consuming H2 through the reverse water gas shift reaction (RWGS), as seen in the thermo- dynamic calculations in Fig. 1a."
          [5] "Additionally, unlike regular oxi- dative dehydrogenation with molecular oxygen, CO2 as a mild oxidant suppresses over-oxidation and thus minimizes the pro- duction of carbon oxides."

[1] "Olefins can also be produced from dehydrogenation reactions of alkane feedstocks; however, simple dehydrogenation reactions suffer from numerous limitations that restrict their extensive applications. The limitations include possible side reactions, thermodynamic constraints on selectivity and conversion, the endothermic nature of the process, which necessitates a high energy input, and coke formation resulting in catalytic deactivation."
          [2] "One modification that may overcome many of these problems is oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH), in which an oxidant is added to the reaction feed of a thermal dehydrogenation unit, thereby initiating the reaction via the oxidant rather than high temperature alone."
          [3] "Despite the desirable exothermic nature and the limited coke formation, ODH based on oxygen is confronted with the challenge of over oxidation of olefins to CO and CO2, as well as the possibility of reaction runaway."
          [4] "To suppress the complete oxidation of alkane to COx to ensure a reasonable selectivity while maintaining good conversion of the ODH reactions, application of catalysts has been investigated, and many catalytic systems were found to be active for the process."
          [5] "Supported vanadium-based oxides and mixed-metal oxides are among the most extensively studied because of their high thermal stability, large surface areas, and the favored reducibility and basicity that promote the ODH activity and selectivity."
          [6] "Nevertheless, to date, none of these systems has shown product yields comparable to those obtained by the current industrial technologies of olefin production."

[1] "Propene (C3H6) is among the foundation feedstock for large volume commodities and specialty chemicals, such as cumene, acrylonitrile,propylene oxide and high-purity polypropylene, and its demand is expected to increase significantly in the near future.1 At present, its industrial production is based on non-oxidative processing of petroleum-based materials, via steam cracking, fluid-catalytic- cracking and catalytic dehydrogenation.2 As far as the catalytic dehydrogenation is concerned,commercial processes use Cr2O3/Al2O3 (18-20 Cr wt%; Catofin press) or Pt(<1 wt%),Sn (1-2 wt%)/Al2O3 (Oleflex process).3 Possible replacements with lower costs and sustainable alternatives is attracting a rising interest since many years, and the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of propane appeared among the most promising, because of the higher energy efficiency (ODH is exothermic, while dehydrogenation and cracking are endothermic processes), and process simplicity."
          [2] "A review on the catalysts for propane ODH was compiled by Cavani et al. in 2007,2 who considered the performances in ODH of propane with O2 as oxidant of almost 100 catalysts, with different active phases,reported in literature over the 2000-2006 period, and concluded that the best propylene yields resulting from propane ODH (ca. 30%) were still far from being interesting for industrial implementation, as well as the information concerning catalyst lifetime appeared quite limited."
          [3] "Moreover, in that review the set-up of catalytic materials and/or reactor configurations capable of maintaining high selectivity to propylene under conditions leading to high propane conversion was addressed as main direction for future development."
          [4] "Later on, an initial yield in C3H6 as high as ca. 47%, decreasing to ca. 33% after 8 h on stream were reported for propane dehydrogenation over GaOx based catalysts.4 More recently, the kinetics for the ODH of C3H8 on VOx catalysts was reviewed by Carrero et al., and for the systems considered the combination of reported conversions and selectivities resulted in yields in C3H6 not exceeding 30%.5 Conversely, Ovsitser et al.,reported the attainment of a yield in propene of ca. 40% for the oxidative dehydrogenation of C3H8 under O2 lean-conditions over VOx/SiO2 catalysts, even a quite long reaction time.6 Similar results were obtained by these authors for the oxydative dehydrogenation of iso-C4H10 to iso-C4H8.7 In this respect, the attainment of high selectivity to olefins via ODH of alkanes is basically limited, from a chemical point of view, by the use of O2 as oxidant, because of the occurrence of the over- oxidation to carbon oxides of both fed paraffins and produced olefins."
          [5] "On such a basis, the use of CO2 as mild oxidant has attracted attention after the successful use in other partial oxidation reactions such as dry reforming8,9 and oxidative coupling of methane.10, 11 Although ODH of propane in the presence of CO2 is an endothermic process (H298K= + 166.6 kJ/mol), the addition of a small amount of oxygen can turn the process towards an exothermic character, and additional positive effects towards the catalyst coking might be expected."

          [7] "On the other hand, although the exothermic character of propane ODH with O2 has the potential to significantly reduce the reaction temperature, the fate of the desired propylene is difficult to be controlled due to unavoidable combustion of propane as well as of propylene to carbon monoxide and/or dioxide thus significantly lowering propylene selectivity."
          [8] "The use of CO2 as, alternative to oxygen, soft oxidant has the potential to i) avoid deep oxidation of alkanes/alkenes, ii) reduce coke formation and iii) favor propane conversion due to participation of the produced hydrogen in the reverse water- gas shift reaction (RWGS)."

Although these methods are commonly used to produce alkenes, they have some disadvantages: they are endothermic and suffer from the production of coke. In case of DH, alkane conversion is limited by thermodynamic constraints [15]."
          [2] "An attractive alternative to this approach is the oxidative dehy- drogenation of propane (ODP) by molecular oxygen, which enables lower reaction temperatures and more effective inhibition of sur- face coke formation.

          [4] "On the other hand, soft oxidants such as carbon dioxide appear as potential alternatives. The PDH in the presence of carbon dioxide (CO2PDH) is also of interest because it utilizes the greenhouse gas CO2 (Zangeneh et al., 2011)."
          [5] "CO2 is a coke removing agent as well. Bartholomew (1984) reported that oxidizability in the gasification of coke was in the following order: O2(105) > H2O(3) > CO2(1) > H2(0.003), where numbers in parentheses indicate the relative ratios of the gasification with oxidants."

          [7] "The oxide catalysts which are active in the nonoxidative dehydrogenation of propane are also active in the process with CO2.

Among the investigated materials, those containing Cr or Ga were found to be the most active and selective (Michorczyk et al., 2011)."
          [8] "Propane dehydrogenation with carbon dioxide is characterized by rapid catalyst deactivation due to coke formation. Ga2O3 showed drastic deactivation during a few hours on stream (Zheng et al., 2005). Besides coke formation, the reduction of Cr(VI) to Cr(III) is responsible for deactivation of chromium based catalysts (Zhang et al., 2011)."

[1] "On the other hand, oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) provides a favorable alternative due to its low energy requirement, no catalyst regeneration obligation, and the elimination of thermodynamic limitations [4, 5]. However, the presence of O2 in the ODH process may lead to the process flammability and the production of carbon oxides due to over-oxidation resulting in poor process selectivity [6, 7]. This problem can be solved by employing a much safer, milder, and readily available carbon dioxide as a soft oxidant."

[1] "In steam cracking, ethylene is the preferred product, but the demand for propylene is growing faster than that for ethylene, especially in Western Europe [1]. Also, in the case of FCC, smaller amounts of propylene are produced."
          [2] "Dehydrogenations thermodynamic constraints limit alkane conversion; furthermore, a major problem is coking, which causes rapid catalyst deactivation."
          [3] "Therefore, the need exists for new technologies devoted to the production of specific olefins, which have none of the disadvantages characterizing dehydrogenation."
          [4] "In fact, the production of chemicals starting from alkanes by means of oxidative processes has been one of the most studied topics in recent decades."
          [5] "The effectiveness of the catalyst, that is the activity for alkane conversion and the selectivity to desired products, will ultimately determine the economic attractiveness of an alkane-based chemical process."
          [6] "The successful commercial technologies will be those that link catalyst performance characteristics with innovative process designs."
          [7] "However, in the case of alkenes produced from alkanes, the lower cost of the feedstock is not a real incentive, since current commercial technologies for olefin production already use fuel-grade feedstocks."
          [8] "In this case, conversely, the improved energy efficiency (ODH is exothermal, while dehydrogenation and cracking are endothermal), and process simplicity are effective incentives."
          [9] "A large number of reviews dealing with the ODH of light alkanes have been published since the early 1990s [421]."
          [10] "In the present review, we attempt to offer an answer to the following questions on the scientific and technological aspects of ethane and propane ODH: Which key factors are the chief determinants of the performance of metal oxide-based catalysts?"
          [11] "Have research efforts led to catalysts that can oxidize alkanes to olefins with yields comparable to those obtained with current technologies for alkenes production?"
          [12] "Does the use of either peculiar reactor configurations (e.g.,membrane-type reactors) or non-conventional methods for the conduction of reactions (e.g., cyclic feeding of reactants) make it possible to improve performances as compared to the traditional configurations?"
          [13] "Furthermore, Lange [3] underlined that more exothermal reactions imply higher energy losses (i.e., the difference between the combustion heat of feed and that of the product) and, hence, higher fixed costs, especially if the production of CO2, the main by-product in alkane ODH, is taken into account."





[1] "The co-production of propylene from steam and fluidized crackers is anticipated to be insufficient to satisfy the rapidly growing demand1. Consequently, there is a need for the development of economic on-purpose production techniques to produce additional propylene."
          [2] "The direct dehydrogenation of propane (DDP) is ther- modynamically limited and is highly endothermic (Î”Hr = 29.70 kcal/mol), requiring temperatures that may exceed 973 K for sig- nificant propylene yields2."
          [3] "In principle, the introduction of CO2 as a mild oxidant into the feed alters the dehydrogenation pathway by oxidizing the abstracted hydrogen from the alkane and conse- quently releasing the heat of reaction that reduces operating temperatures2,3."
          [4] "The presence of CO2 can also increase the equili- brium conversion of propane by consuming H2 through the reverse water gas shift reaction (RWGS), as seen in the thermo- dynamic calculations in Fig. 1a."
          [5] "Additionally, unlike regular oxi- dative dehydrogenation with molecular oxygen, CO2 as a mild oxidant suppresses over-oxidation and thus minimizes the pro- duction of carbon oxides."

[1] "Olefins can also be produced from dehydrogenation reactions of alkane feedstocks; however, simple dehydrogenation reactions suffer from numerous limitations that restrict their extensive applications. The limitations include possible side reactions, thermodynamic constraints on selectivity and conversion, the endothermic nature of the process, which necessitates a high energy input, and coke formation resulting in catalytic deactivation."
          [2] "One modification that may overcome many of these problems is oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH), in which an oxidant is added to the reaction feed of a thermal dehydrogenation unit, thereby initiating the reaction via the oxidant rather than high temperature alone."
          [3] "Despite the desirable exothermic nature and the limited coke formation, ODH based on oxygen is confronted with the challenge of over oxidation of olefins to CO and CO2, as well as the possibility of reaction runaway."
          [4] "To suppress the complete oxidation of alkane to COx to ensure a reasonable selectivity while maintaining good conversion of the ODH reactions, application of catalysts has been investigated, and many catalytic systems were found to be active for the process."
          [5] "Supported vanadium-based oxides and mixed-metal oxides are among the most extensively studied because of their high thermal stability, large surface areas, and the favored reducibility and basicity that promote the ODH activity and selectivity."
          [6] "Nevertheless, to date, none of these systems has shown product yields comparable to those obtained by the current industrial technologies of olefin production."

[1] "Propene (C3H6) is among the foundation feedstock for large volume commodities and specialty chemicals, such as cumene, acrylonitrile,propylene oxide and high-purity polypropylene, and its demand is expected to increase significantly in the near future.1 At present, its industrial production is based on non-oxidative processing of petroleum-based materials, via steam cracking, fluid-catalytic- cracking and catalytic dehydrogenation.2 As far as the catalytic dehydrogenation is concerned,commercial processes use Cr2O3/Al2O3 (18-20 Cr wt%; Catofin press) or Pt(<1 wt%),Sn (1-2 wt%)/Al2O3 (Oleflex process).3 Possible replacements with lower costs and sustainable alternatives is attracting a rising interest since many years, and the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of propane appeared among the most promising, because of the higher energy efficiency (ODH is exothermic, while dehydrogenation and cracking are endothermic processes), and process simplicity."
          [2] "A review on the catalysts for propane ODH was compiled by Cavani et al. in 2007,2 who considered the performances in ODH of propane with O2 as oxidant of almost 100 catalysts, with different active phases,reported in literature over the 2000-2006 period, and concluded that the best propylene yields resulting from propane ODH (ca. 30%) were still far from being interesting for industrial implementation, as well as the information concerning catalyst lifetime appeared quite limited."
          [3] "Moreover, in that review the set-up of catalytic materials and/or reactor configurations capable of maintaining high selectivity to propylene under conditions leading to high propane conversion was addressed as main direction for future development."
          [4] "Later on, an initial yield in C3H6 as high as ca. 47%, decreasing to ca. 33% after 8 h on stream were reported for propane dehydrogenation over GaOx based catalysts.4 More recently, the kinetics for the ODH of C3H8 on VOx catalysts was reviewed by Carrero et al., and for the systems considered the combination of reported conversions and selectivities resulted in yields in C3H6 not exceeding 30%.5 Conversely, Ovsitser et al.,reported the attainment of a yield in propene of ca. 40% for the oxidative dehydrogenation of C3H8 under O2 lean-conditions over VOx/SiO2 catalysts, even a quite long reaction time.6 Similar results were obtained by these authors for the oxydative dehydrogenation of iso-C4H10 to iso-C4H8.7 In this respect, the attainment of high selectivity to olefins via ODH of alkanes is basically limited, from a chemical point of view, by the use of O2 as oxidant, because of the occurrence of the over- oxidation to carbon oxides of both fed paraffins and produced olefins."
          [5] "On such a basis, the use of CO2 as mild oxidant has attracted attention after the successful use in other partial oxidation reactions such as dry reforming8,9 and oxidative coupling of methane.10, 11 Although ODH of propane in the presence of CO2 is an endothermic process (H298K= + 166.6 kJ/mol), the addition of a small amount of oxygen can turn the process towards an exothermic character, and additional positive effects towards the catalyst coking might be expected."



[1] "The oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) is a contemporary example of such a challenging reaction. While propene is conventionally produced via steam cracking of large hydrocarbons in naphtha, the more recent trend to use shale gas as feeds to steam cracker units greatly increases the availability of low-cost ethene but also results in a gap between demand and supply of propene, as well as other higher olefins (2, 3). This disparity motivates the exploration of on-purpose propene technologies."
          [2] "Despite non-oxidative propane dehydrogenation being the emerging technology used today, ODHP has the potential to improve reaction efficiency over its non-oxidative counterpart because of favorable thermodynamics (exothermic, lower reaction temperatures) and enhanced catalyst stability (prevention of coke deposition on the catalyst surface)."
          [3] "The key scientific challenge that must be overcome remains,however, the prevention of the facile over-oxidation of propene product into more thermodynamically stable CO and CO2 (COx)."

[1] "Most of the current propylene production is performed by steam cracking (SC) and fluidic catalytic cracking (FCC).1 However, in both the SC and FCC processes, propylene is produced as a by-product and the selectivity and yields are always low.2 The availability of ethane as a major component of natural gas at natural gas prices has attracted many ethylene producers to utilize ethane instead of naphtha as the feedstock in steam crackers. As a result, the ratio of propylene/ethylene produced from steam crackers continues to decline. At the same time, driven by the expanding polypropylene market, the demand ratio of propylene/ethylene is increasing. For these reasons, it becomes increasingly important to develop on-purpose propylene production technologies that offer higher propylene/ethylene production ratios.1 Propane dehydrogenation has long been thought to be an ideal route for propylene production because of the theoretical high propylene selectivity and low capital investment, as well as the independence of the propylene production cost to naphtha price."
          [2] "Propane dehydrogenation is limited by thermodynamics, so that very high reaction temperatures on the order of 1000K are required to give a high single-pass propane conversion.2,4 Hence, the separation of the resulting hydrogen and unreacted propane from propylene becomes an issue."
          [3] "Theoretically, introducing an oxidant can drive the reaction to be more thermodynamically favorable. However, the highest propylene yield reported for propane oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) is only about 30%, owing mainly to the consecutive oxidation of propylene to oxygenated products.2,5 The oxidative dehydrogenation pathways to produce diolefins and aromatics suffer from the same issue."
          [4] "Although many different catalysts, promoters and alternative oxidants have been studied,2,5,6 a commercially viable breakthrough has yet to be achieved."
          [5] "Among the halogens, F2 is inappropriate because of its high reactivity and the unfavorable thermodynamics for its use in a halogenationdehydrohalogenation process. Similarly, Cl2 reactions with alkanes are always fast and non-selective, and under some conditions an explosion may occur.9 I2 reacts selectively, but relatively slowly, with propane at low temperatures to produce propyl iodides and propylene. High propylene yields can be achieved with stoichiometric I2 and propane feeding.10 However, this reaction is only thermodynamically favorable at high temperatures (FigureS1). Furthermore, as a stoichiometric reaction of I2 with propane is needed, the recycling efficiency of the relatively expensive I2 greatly limits the potential industrial application of this process.11"
          [6] "Compared to chlorine and iodine, reactions of bromine with propane are more feasible. However, to resolve the polyhalogenation selectivity issue in gaseous alkane bromination processes, a higher propane to bromine ratio is required to avoid the formation of 2,2-C3H6Br2.7 Consequently, single-pass propane conversion, using present technology, has limited utility."





Propane oxydehydrogenation combining high propane conversion and high propylene selectivity has proved an elusive goal, and propane oxydehydrogenation as a route to propylene appears to be far from realizing its commercialization potential. One difficulty is that propylene is more easily oxidized than is propane, so that selectivity tends to decline rapidly with conversion. Another is that at temperatures above about 700 C, propane cracking becomes significant, and a variety of products other than propylene are produced.

[1] "The co-production of propylene from steam and fluidized crackers is anticipated to be insufficient to satisfy the rapidly growing demand1. Consequently, there is a need for the development of economic on-purpose production techniques to produce additional propylene."
          [2] "The direct dehydrogenation of propane (DDP) is ther- modynamically limited and is highly endothermic (Î”Hr = 29.70 kcal/mol), requiring temperatures that may exceed 973 K for sig- nificant propylene yields2."

[1] "Olefins can also be produced from dehydrogenation reactions of alkane feedstocks; however, simple dehydrogenation reactions suffer from numerous limitations that restrict their extensive applications. The limitations include possible side reactions, thermodynamic constraints on selectivity and conversion, the endothermic nature of the process, which necessitates a high energy input, and coke formation resulting in catalytic deactivation."
          [2] "One modification that may overcome many of these problems is oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH), in which an oxidant is added to the reaction feed of a thermal dehydrogenation unit, thereby initiating the reaction via the oxidant rather than high temperature alone."

[1] "Propene (C3H6) is among the foundation feedstock for large volume commodities and specialty chemicals, such as cumene, acrylonitrile,propylene oxide and high-purity polypropylene, and its demand is expected to increase significantly in the near future.1 At present, its industrial production is based on non-oxidative processing of petroleum-based materials, via steam cracking, fluid-catalytic- cracking and catalytic dehydrogenation.2 As far as the catalytic dehydrogenation is concerned,commercial processes use Cr2O3/Al2O3 (18-20 Cr wt%; Catofin press) or Pt(<1 wt%),Sn (1-2 wt%)/Al2O3 (Oleflex process).3 Possible replacements with lower costs and sustainable alternatives is attracting a rising interest since many years, and the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of propane appeared among the most promising, because of the higher energy efficiency (ODH is exothermic, while dehydrogenation and cracking are endothermic processes), and process simplicity."
          [2] "A review on the catalysts for propane ODH was compiled by Cavani et al. in 2007,2 who considered the performances in ODH of propane with O2 as oxidant of almost 100 catalysts, with different active phases,reported in literature over the 2000-2006 period, and concluded that the best propylene yields resulting from propane ODH (ca. 30%) were still far from being interesting for industrial implementation, as well as the information concerning catalyst lifetime appeared quite limited."
          [3] "Moreover, in that review the set-up of catalytic materials and/or reactor configurations capable of maintaining high selectivity to propylene under conditions leading to high propane conversion was addressed as main direction for future development."
          [4] "Later on, an initial yield in C3H6 as high as ca. 47%, decreasing to ca. 33% after 8 h on stream were reported for propane dehydrogenation over GaOx based catalysts.4 More recently, the kinetics for the ODH of C3H8 on VOx catalysts was reviewed by Carrero et al., and for the systems considered the combination of reported conversions and selectivities resulted in yields in C3H6 not exceeding 30%.5 Conversely, Ovsitser et al.,reported the attainment of a yield in propene of ca. 40% for the oxidative dehydrogenation of C3H8 under O2 lean-conditions over VOx/SiO2 catalysts, even a quite long reaction time.6 Similar results were obtained by these authors for the oxydative dehydrogenation of iso-C4H10 to iso-C4H8.7 In this respect, the attainment of high selectivity to olefins via ODH of alkanes is basically limited, from a chemical point of view, by the use of O2 as oxidant, because of the occurrence of the over- oxidation to carbon oxides of both fed paraffins and produced olefins."
          [5] "On such a basis, the use of CO2 as mild oxidant has attracted attention after the successful use in other partial oxidation reactions such as dry reforming8,9 and oxidative coupling of methane.10, 11 Although ODH of propane in the presence of CO2 is an endothermic process (H298K= + 166.6 kJ/mol), the addition of a small amount of oxygen can turn the process towards an exothermic character, and additional positive effects towards the catalyst coking might be expected."



[1] "The oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) is a contemporary example of such a challenging reaction. While propene is conventionally produced via steam cracking of large hydrocarbons in naphtha, the more recent trend to use shale gas as feeds to steam cracker units greatly increases the availability of low-cost ethene but also results in a gap between demand and supply of propene, as well as other higher olefins (2, 3). This disparity motivates the exploration of on-purpose propene technologies."
          [2] "Despite non-oxidative propane dehydrogenation being the emerging technology used today, ODHP has the potential to improve reaction efficiency over its non-oxidative counterpart because of favorable thermodynamics (exothermic, lower reaction temperatures) and enhanced catalyst stability (prevention of coke deposition on the catalyst surface)."

[1] "Most of the current propylene production is performed by steam cracking (SC) and fluidic catalytic cracking (FCC).1 However, in both the SC and FCC processes, propylene is produced as a by-product and the selectivity and yields are always low.2 The availability of ethane as a major component of natural gas at natural gas prices has attracted many ethylene producers to utilize ethane instead of naphtha as the feedstock in steam crackers. As a result, the ratio of propylene/ethylene produced from steam crackers continues to decline. At the same time, driven by the expanding polypropylene market, the demand ratio of propylene/ethylene is increasing. For these reasons, it becomes increasingly important to develop on-purpose propylene production technologies that offer higher propylene/ethylene production ratios.1 Propane dehydrogenation has long been thought to be an ideal route for propylene production because of the theoretical high propylene selectivity and low capital investment, as well as the independence of the propylene production cost to naphtha price."
          [2] "Propane dehydrogenation is limited by thermodynamics, so that very high reaction temperatures on the order of 1000K are required to give a high single-pass propane conversion.2,4 Hence, the separation of the resulting hydrogen and unreacted propane from propylene becomes an issue."
          [3] "Theoretically, introducing an oxidant can drive the reaction to be more thermodynamically favorable. However, the highest propylene yield reported for propane oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) is only about 30%, owing mainly to the consecutive oxidation of propylene to oxygenated products.2,5 The oxidative dehydrogenation pathways to produce diolefins and aromatics suffer from the same issue."
          [4] "Although many different catalysts, promoters and alternative oxidants have been studied,2,5,6 a commercially viable breakthrough has yet to be achieved."
          [5] "Among the halogens, F2 is inappropriate because of its high reactivity and the unfavorable thermodynamics for its use in a halogenationdehydrohalogenation process. Similarly, Cl2 reactions with alkanes are always fast and non-selective, and under some conditions an explosion may occur.9 I2 reacts selectively, but relatively slowly, with propane at low temperatures to produce propyl iodides and propylene. High propylene yields can be achieved with stoichiometric I2 and propane feeding.10 However, this reaction is only thermodynamically favorable at high temperatures (FigureS1). Furthermore, as a stoichiometric reaction of I2 with propane is needed, the recycling efficiency of the relatively expensive I2 greatly limits the potential industrial application of this process.11"
          [6] "Compared to chlorine and iodine, reactions of bromine with propane are more feasible. However, to resolve the polyhalogenation selectivity issue in gaseous alkane bromination processes, a higher propane to bromine ratio is required to avoid the formation of 2,2-C3H6Br2.7 Consequently, single-pass propane conversion, using present technology, has limited utility."





Propane oxydehydrogenation combining high propane conversion and high propylene selectivity has proved an elusive goal, and propane oxydehydrogenation as a route to propylene appears to be far from realizing its commercialization potential. One difficulty is that propylene is more easily oxidized than is propane, so that selectivity tends to decline rapidly with conversion. Another is that at temperatures above about 700 C, propane cracking becomes significant, and a variety of products other than propylene are produced.



[1] "At present, propylene is mainly produced by steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) of naphtha, light diesel, and other oil byproducts, as well as direct dehydrogenation of propane (DHP)."
          [2] "Yet, the dehydrogenation process suffers from two inherent drawbacks: (i) the endothermicity-induced thermodynamic limit for C3H8 conversion that demands high-energy input and (ii) the rapid catalyst deactivation because of coke formation."

[1] "Propane direct dehydrogenation (DH) as well as oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) have attracted worldwide academic and industrial interests, but both suffer from limitations that have been reviewed extensively elsewhere1-3."
          [2] "Propane DH is an endothermic reaction and thus high temperatures are required to achieve acceptable olefin yields."
          [3] "The CATOFIN dehydrogenation process4-5 provides 850000 MTA (million metric tons annually) of propylene with minimum of 99.5% purity and is based on chromium oxide supported on activated alumina."
          [4] "The Oleflex dehydrogenation process4-5 relies on the traditional Pt/Sn catalytic system to produce polymer grade propylene."
          [5] "The high operating temperature as well as the cost of the Pt catalysts comprise the main drawbacks."
          [6] "In addition,the reaction is usually accompanied by catalyst deactivation due to coke formation and spatial separation of Pt-Sn species thus highlighting the stability of catalysts used among the major botlenecks6-7."
          [7] "On the other hand, although the exothermic character of propane ODH with O2 has the potential to significantly reduce the reaction temperature, the fate of the desired propylene is difficult to be controlled due to unavoidable combustion of propane as well as of propylene to carbon monoxide and/or dioxide thus significantly lowering propylene selectivity."
          [8] "The use of CO2 as, alternative to oxygen, soft oxidant has the potential to i) avoid deep oxidation of alkanes/alkenes, ii) reduce coke formation and iii) favor propane conversion due to participation of the produced hydrogen in the reverse water- gas shift reaction (RWGS)."

[1] "The demand for olefins, especially propylene, is expected to increase significantly in the near future. Steam cracking, Fluid Cat- alytic Cracking (FCC) and dehydrogenation (DH) are the primary methods to obtain olefins. Although these methods are commonly used to produce alkenes, they have some disadvantages: they are endothermic and suffer from the production of coke. In case of DH, alkane conversion is limited by thermodynamic constraints [15]."
          [2] "An attractive alternative to this approach is the oxidative dehy- drogenation of propane (ODP) by molecular oxygen, which enables lower reaction temperatures and more effective inhibition of sur- face coke formation. The primary drawback of this process is a low propylene selectivity due to total oxidation of propane and propylene at high conversion. Thus there is an ongoing search for a selective catalyst in this process."

[1] "Propylene is an important raw material in the production of polypropylene,polyacrylonitrile, acrolein, and acrylic acid. The conventional manufacturing methods such as catalytic and steam cracking which produce propylene as a byproduct do not meet the everincreasing demand. Therefore, propane dehydrogenation (PDH) has received much attention (HeinritzAdrian et al., 2008):"
          [2] "Direct catalytic dehydrogenation of hydrocarbons is characterized by low conversion per pass and low yields due to equilibrium limitation. The process is endothermic and the thermodynamic equilibrium is unfavorable (Olah and Molnar, 2003). Temperatures above 800 K are required for commercially feasible conversions. At these temperatures,undesirable side reactions limit the propylene yield and coke formation necessitates frequent catalyst regeneration."
          [3] "Catalytic oxidative dehydrogenation of propane by oxygen is an attractive alternative because it is an exothermic and nonthermodynamically limited reaction. However, the propylene selectivity of the reaction remains an unsolved problem owing to the over oxidation of propane (Xu et al., 2006)."
          [4] "On the other hand, soft oxidants such as carbon dioxide appear as potential alternatives. The PDH in the presence of carbon dioxide (CO2PDH) is also of interest because it utilizes the greenhouse gas CO2 (Zangeneh et al., 2011)."
          [5] "CO2 is a coke removing agent as well. Bartholomew (1984) reported that oxidizability in the gasification of coke was in the following order: O2(105) > H2O(3) > CO2(1) > H2(0.003), where numbers in parentheses indicate the relative ratios of the gasification with oxidants."
          [6] "The promoting effect of CO2 is explained either by consumption of the hydrogen in the reverse watergas shift reaction  RWGS (reaction 2), which shifts the equilibrium of propane dehydrogenation to completion (twostep pathway) or its participation in direct oxidation of propane to propylene (reaction 3) (onestep pathway):"
          [7] "The oxide catalysts which are active in the nonoxidative dehydrogenation of propane are also active in the process with CO2. Many bulk and supported oxidebased materials containing active species, such as Cr (Michorczyk and Ogonowski, 2003; Michorczyk et al., 2008; Michorczyk et al., 2010; Michorczyk et al., 2011), Ga (Michorczyk et al., 2003; Xu et al., 2006), V (Takahara et al., 2005; Ogonowski and Skrzynska, 2008) and Fe (Michorczyk et al., 2004) have been studied as catalysts for dehydrogenation of propane in the presence of CO2. Among the investigated materials, those containing Cr or Ga were found to be the most active and selective (Michorczyk et al., 2011)."
          [8] "Propane dehydrogenation with carbon dioxide is characterized by rapid catalyst deactivation due to coke formation. Ga2O3 showed drastic deactivation during a few hours on stream (Zheng et al., 2005). Besides coke formation, the reduction of Cr(VI) to Cr(III) is responsible for deactivation of chromium based catalysts (Zhang et al., 2011)."

[1] "On the other hand, oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) provides a favorable alternative due to its low energy requirement, no catalyst regeneration obligation, and the elimination of thermodynamic limitations [4, 5]. However, the presence of O2 in the ODH process may lead to the process flammability and the production of carbon oxides due to over-oxidation resulting in poor process selectivity [6, 7]. This problem can be solved by employing a much safer, milder, and readily available carbon dioxide as a soft oxidant."

[1] "In steam cracking, ethylene is the preferred product, but the demand for propylene is growing faster than that for ethylene, especially in Western Europe [1]. Also, in the case of FCC, smaller amounts of propylene are produced."
          [2] "Dehydrogenations thermodynamic constraints limit alkane conversion; furthermore, a major problem is coking, which causes rapid catalyst deactivation."
          [3] "Therefore, the need exists for new technologies devoted to the production of specific olefins, which have none of the disadvantages characterizing dehydrogenation."
          [4] "In fact, the production of chemicals starting from alkanes by means of oxidative processes has been one of the most studied topics in recent decades."
          [5] "The effectiveness of the catalyst, that is the activity for alkane conversion and the selectivity to desired products, will ultimately determine the economic attractiveness of an alkane-based chemical process."
          [6] "The successful commercial technologies will be those that link catalyst performance characteristics with innovative process designs."

[1] "Most of the current propylene production is performed by steam cracking (SC) and fluidic catalytic cracking (FCC).1 However, in both the SC and FCC processes, propylene is produced as a by-product and the selectivity and yields are always low.2 The availability of ethane as a major component of natural gas at natural gas prices has attracted many ethylene producers to utilize ethane instead of naphtha as the feedstock in steam crackers. As a result, the ratio of propylene/ethylene produced from steam crackers continues to decline. At the same time, driven by the expanding polypropylene market, the demand ratio of propylene/ethylene is increasing. For these reasons, it becomes increasingly important to develop on-purpose propylene production technologies that offer higher propylene/ethylene production ratios.1 Propane dehydrogenation has long been thought to be an ideal route for propylene production because of the theoretical high propylene selectivity and low capital investment, as well as the independence of the propylene production cost to naphtha price."
          [2] "Propane dehydrogenation is limited by thermodynamics, so that very high reaction temperatures on the order of 1000K are required to give a high single-pass propane conversion.2,4 Hence, the separation of the resulting hydrogen and unreacted propane from propylene becomes an issue."
          [3] "Theoretically, introducing an oxidant can drive the reaction to be more thermodynamically favorable. However, the highest propylene yield reported for propane oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) is only about 30%, owing mainly to the consecutive oxidation of propylene to oxygenated products.2,5 The oxidative dehydrogenation pathways to produce diolefins and aromatics suffer from the same issue."
          [4] "Although many different catalysts, promoters and alternative oxidants have been studied,2,5,6 a commercially viable breakthrough has yet to be achieved."
          [5] "Among the halogens, F2 is inappropriate because of its high reactivity and the unfavorable thermodynamics for its use in a halogenationdehydrohalogenation process. Similarly, Cl2 reactions with alkanes are always fast and non-selective, and under some conditions an explosion may occur.9 I2 reacts selectively, but relatively slowly, with propane at low temperatures to produce propyl iodides and propylene. High propylene yields can be achieved with stoichiometric I2 and propane feeding.10 However, this reaction is only thermodynamically favorable at high temperatures (FigureS1). Furthermore, as a stoichiometric reaction of I2 with propane is needed, the recycling efficiency of the relatively expensive I2 greatly limits the potential industrial application of this process.11"
          [6] "Compared to chlorine and iodine, reactions of bromine with propane are more feasible. However, to resolve the polyhalogenation selectivity issue in gaseous alkane bromination processes, a higher propane to bromine ratio is required to avoid the formation of 2,2-C3H6Br2.7 Consequently, single-pass propane conversion, using present technology, has limited utility."





Propane oxydehydrogenation combining high propane conversion and high propylene selectivity has proved an elusive goal, and propane oxydehydrogenation as a route to propylene appears to be far from realizing its commercialization potential. One difficulty is that propylene is more easily oxidized than is propane, so that selectivity tends to decline rapidly with conversion. Another is that at temperatures above about 700 C, propane cracking becomes significant, and a variety of products other than propylene are produced.



[1] "At present, propylene is mainly produced by steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) of naphtha, light diesel, and other oil byproducts, as well as direct dehydrogenation of propane (DHP)."

[1] "Propane direct dehydrogenation (DH) as well as oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) have attracted worldwide academic and industrial interests, but both suffer from limitations that have been reviewed extensively elsewhere1-3."
          [2] "Propane DH is an endothermic reaction and thus high temperatures are required to achieve acceptable olefin yields."
          [3] "The CATOFIN dehydrogenation process4-5 provides 850000 MTA (million metric tons annually) of propylene with minimum of 99.5% purity and is based on chromium oxide supported on activated alumina."
          [4] "The Oleflex dehydrogenation process4-5 relies on the traditional Pt/Sn catalytic system to produce polymer grade propylene."
          [5] "The high operating temperature as well as the cost of the Pt catalysts comprise the main drawbacks."
          [6] "In addition,the reaction is usually accompanied by catalyst deactivation due to coke formation and spatial separation of Pt-Sn species thus highlighting the stability of catalysts used among the major botlenecks6-7."
          [7] "On the other hand, although the exothermic character of propane ODH with O2 has the potential to significantly reduce the reaction temperature, the fate of the desired propylene is difficult to be controlled due to unavoidable combustion of propane as well as of propylene to carbon monoxide and/or dioxide thus significantly lowering propylene selectivity."
          [8] "The use of CO2 as, alternative to oxygen, soft oxidant has the potential to i) avoid deep oxidation of alkanes/alkenes, ii) reduce coke formation and iii) favor propane conversion due to participation of the produced hydrogen in the reverse water- gas shift reaction (RWGS)."

[1] "The demand for olefins, especially propylene, is expected to increase significantly in the near future. Steam cracking, Fluid Cat- alytic Cracking (FCC) and dehydrogenation (DH) are the primary methods to obtain olefins. Although these methods are commonly used to produce alkenes, they have some disadvantages: they are endothermic and suffer from the production of coke. In case of DH, alkane conversion is limited by thermodynamic constraints [15]."
          [2] "An attractive alternative to this approach is the oxidative dehy- drogenation of propane (ODP) by molecular oxygen, which enables lower reaction temperatures and more effective inhibition of sur- face coke formation. The primary drawback of this process is a low propylene selectivity due to total oxidation of propane and propylene at high conversion. Thus there is an ongoing search for a selective catalyst in this process."

[1] "Propylene is an important raw material in the production of polypropylene,polyacrylonitrile, acrolein, and acrylic acid. The conventional manufacturing methods such as catalytic and steam cracking which produce propylene as a byproduct do not meet the everincreasing demand. Therefore, propane dehydrogenation (PDH) has received much attention (HeinritzAdrian et al., 2008):"
          [2] "Direct catalytic dehydrogenation of hydrocarbons is characterized by low conversion per pass and low yields due to equilibrium limitation. The process is endothermic and the thermodynamic equilibrium is unfavorable (Olah and Molnar, 2003). Temperatures above 800 K are required for commercially feasible conversions. At these temperatures,undesirable side reactions limit the propylene yield and coke formation necessitates frequent catalyst regeneration."
          [3] "Catalytic oxidative dehydrogenation of propane by oxygen is an attractive alternative because it is an exothermic and nonthermodynamically limited reaction. However, the propylene selectivity of the reaction remains an unsolved problem owing to the over oxidation of propane (Xu et al., 2006)."
          [4] "On the other hand, soft oxidants such as carbon dioxide appear as potential alternatives. The PDH in the presence of carbon dioxide (CO2PDH) is also of interest because it utilizes the greenhouse gas CO2 (Zangeneh et al., 2011)."
          [5] "CO2 is a coke removing agent as well. Bartholomew (1984) reported that oxidizability in the gasification of coke was in the following order: O2(105) > H2O(3) > CO2(1) > H2(0.003), where numbers in parentheses indicate the relative ratios of the gasification with oxidants."
          [6] "The promoting effect of CO2 is explained either by consumption of the hydrogen in the reverse watergas shift reaction  RWGS (reaction 2), which shifts the equilibrium of propane dehydrogenation to completion (twostep pathway) or its participation in direct oxidation of propane to propylene (reaction 3) (onestep pathway):"
          [7] "The oxide catalysts which are active in the nonoxidative dehydrogenation of propane are also active in the process with CO2. Many bulk and supported oxidebased materials containing active species, such as Cr (Michorczyk and Ogonowski, 2003; Michorczyk et al., 2008; Michorczyk et al., 2010; Michorczyk et al., 2011), Ga (Michorczyk et al., 2003; Xu et al., 2006), V (Takahara et al., 2005; Ogonowski and Skrzynska, 2008) and Fe (Michorczyk et al., 2004) have been studied as catalysts for dehydrogenation of propane in the presence of CO2. Among the investigated materials, those containing Cr or Ga were found to be the most active and selective (Michorczyk et al., 2011)."
          [8] "Propane dehydrogenation with carbon dioxide is characterized by rapid catalyst deactivation due to coke formation. Ga2O3 showed drastic deactivation during a few hours on stream (Zheng et al., 2005). Besides coke formation, the reduction of Cr(VI) to Cr(III) is responsible for deactivation of chromium based catalysts (Zhang et al., 2011)."

[1] "On the other hand, oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) provides a favorable alternative due to its low energy requirement, no catalyst regeneration obligation, and the elimination of thermodynamic limitations [4, 5]. However, the presence of O2 in the ODH process may lead to the process flammability and the production of carbon oxides due to over-oxidation resulting in poor process selectivity [6, 7]. This problem can be solved by employing a much safer, milder, and readily available carbon dioxide as a soft oxidant."

[1] "In steam cracking, ethylene is the preferred product, but the demand for propylene is growing faster than that for ethylene, especially in Western Europe [1]. Also, in the case of FCC, smaller amounts of propylene are produced."
          [2] "Dehydrogenations thermodynamic constraints limit alkane conversion; furthermore, a major problem is coking, which causes rapid catalyst deactivation."
          [3] "Therefore, the need exists for new technologies devoted to the production of specific olefins, which have none of the disadvantages characterizing dehydrogenation."
          [4] "In fact, the production of chemicals starting from alkanes by means of oxidative processes has been one of the most studied topics in recent decades."
          [5] "The effectiveness of the catalyst, that is the activity for alkane conversion and the selectivity to desired products, will ultimately determine the economic attractiveness of an alkane-based chemical process."
          [6] "The successful commercial technologies will be those that link catalyst performance characteristics with innovative process designs."
          [7] "However, in the case of alkenes produced from alkanes, the lower cost of the feedstock is not a real incentive, since current commercial technologies for olefin production already use fuel-grade feedstocks."
          [8] "In this case, conversely, the improved energy efficiency (ODH is exothermal, while dehydrogenation and cracking are endothermal), and process simplicity are effective incentives."
          [9] "A large number of reviews dealing with the ODH of light alkanes have been published since the early 1990s [421]."
          [10] "In the present review, we attempt to offer an answer to the following questions on the scientific and technological aspects of ethane and propane ODH: Which key factors are the chief determinants of the performance of metal oxide-based catalysts?"
          [11] "Have research efforts led to catalysts that can oxidize alkanes to olefins with yields comparable to those obtained with current technologies for alkenes production?"
          [12] "Does the use of either peculiar reactor configurations (e.g.,membrane-type reactors) or non-conventional methods for the conduction of reactions (e.g., cyclic feeding of reactants) make it possible to improve performances as compared to the traditional configurations?"
          [13] "Furthermore, Lange [3] underlined that more exothermal reactions imply higher energy losses (i.e., the difference between the combustion heat of feed and that of the product) and, hence, higher fixed costs, especially if the production of CO2, the main by-product in alkane ODH, is taken into account."





[1] "The co-production of propylene from steam and fluidized crackers is anticipated to be insufficient to satisfy the rapidly growing demand1. Consequently, there is a need for the development of economic on-purpose production techniques to produce additional propylene."
          [2] "The direct dehydrogenation of propane (DDP) is ther- modynamically limited and is highly endothermic (Î”Hr = 29.70 kcal/mol), requiring temperatures that may exceed 973 K for sig- nificant propylene yields2."
          [3] "In principle, the introduction of CO2 as a mild oxidant into the feed alters the dehydrogenation pathway by oxidizing the abstracted hydrogen from the alkane and conse- quently releasing the heat of reaction that reduces operating temperatures2,3."
          [4] "The presence of CO2 can also increase the equili- brium conversion of propane by consuming H2 through the reverse water gas shift reaction (RWGS), as seen in the thermo- dynamic calculations in Fig. 1a."
          [5] "Additionally, unlike regular oxi- dative dehydrogenation with molecular oxygen, CO2 as a mild oxidant suppresses over-oxidation and thus minimizes the pro- duction of carbon oxides."

[1] "Olefins can also be produced from dehydrogenation reactions of alkane feedstocks; however, simple dehydrogenation reactions suffer from numerous limitations that restrict their extensive applications. The limitations include possible side reactions, thermodynamic constraints on selectivity and conversion, the endothermic nature of the process, which necessitates a high energy input, and coke formation resulting in catalytic deactivation."
          [2] "One modification that may overcome many of these problems is oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH), in which an oxidant is added to the reaction feed of a thermal dehydrogenation unit, thereby initiating the reaction via the oxidant rather than high temperature alone."
          [3] "Despite the desirable exothermic nature and the limited coke formation, ODH based on oxygen is confronted with the challenge of over oxidation of olefins to CO and CO2, as well as the possibility of reaction runaway."
          [4] "To suppress the complete oxidation of alkane to COx to ensure a reasonable selectivity while maintaining good conversion of the ODH reactions, application of catalysts has been investigated, and many catalytic systems were found to be active for the process."
          [5] "Supported vanadium-based oxides and mixed-metal oxides are among the most extensively studied because of their high thermal stability, large surface areas, and the favored reducibility and basicity that promote the ODH activity and selectivity."
          [6] "Nevertheless, to date, none of these systems has shown product yields comparable to those obtained by the current industrial technologies of olefin production."

[1] "Propene (C3H6) is among the foundation feedstock for large volume commodities and specialty chemicals, such as cumene, acrylonitrile,propylene oxide and high-purity polypropylene, and its demand is expected to increase significantly in the near future.1 At present, its industrial production is based on non-oxidative processing of petroleum-based materials, via steam cracking, fluid-catalytic- cracking and catalytic dehydrogenation.2 As far as the catalytic dehydrogenation is concerned,commercial processes use Cr2O3/Al2O3 (18-20 Cr wt%; Catofin press) or Pt(<1 wt%),Sn (1-2 wt%)/Al2O3 (Oleflex process).3 Possible replacements with lower costs and sustainable alternatives is attracting a rising interest since many years, and the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of propane appeared among the most promising, because of the higher energy efficiency (ODH is exothermic, while dehydrogenation and cracking are endothermic processes), and process simplicity."
          [2] "A review on the catalysts for propane ODH was compiled by Cavani et al. in 2007,2 who considered the performances in ODH of propane with O2 as oxidant of almost 100 catalysts, with different active phases,reported in literature over the 2000-2006 period, and concluded that the best propylene yields resulting from propane ODH (ca. 30%) were still far from being interesting for industrial implementation, as well as the information concerning catalyst lifetime appeared quite limited."
          [3] "Moreover, in that review the set-up of catalytic materials and/or reactor configurations capable of maintaining high selectivity to propylene under conditions leading to high propane conversion was addressed as main direction for future development."
          [4] "Later on, an initial yield in C3H6 as high as ca. 47%, decreasing to ca. 33% after 8 h on stream were reported for propane dehydrogenation over GaOx based catalysts.4 More recently, the kinetics for the ODH of C3H8 on VOx catalysts was reviewed by Carrero et al., and for the systems considered the combination of reported conversions and selectivities resulted in yields in C3H6 not exceeding 30%.5 Conversely, Ovsitser et al.,reported the attainment of a yield in propene of ca. 40% for the oxidative dehydrogenation of C3H8 under O2 lean-conditions over VOx/SiO2 catalysts, even a quite long reaction time.6 Similar results were obtained by these authors for the oxydative dehydrogenation of iso-C4H10 to iso-C4H8.7 In this respect, the attainment of high selectivity to olefins via ODH of alkanes is basically limited, from a chemical point of view, by the use of O2 as oxidant, because of the occurrence of the over- oxidation to carbon oxides of both fed paraffins and produced olefins."
          [5] "On such a basis, the use of CO2 as mild oxidant has attracted attention after the successful use in other partial oxidation reactions such as dry reforming8,9 and oxidative coupling of methane.10, 11 Although ODH of propane in the presence of CO2 is an endothermic process (H298K= + 166.6 kJ/mol), the addition of a small amount of oxygen can turn the process towards an exothermic character, and additional positive effects towards the catalyst coking might be expected."



[1] "The oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) is a contemporary example of such a challenging reaction. While propene is conventionally produced via steam cracking of large hydrocarbons in naphtha, the more recent trend to use shale gas as feeds to steam cracker units greatly increases the availability of low-cost ethene but also results in a gap between demand and supply of propene, as well as other higher olefins (2, 3). This disparity motivates the exploration of on-purpose propene technologies."
          [2] "Despite non-oxidative propane dehydrogenation being the emerging technology used today, ODHP has the potential to improve reaction efficiency over its non-oxidative counterpart because of favorable thermodynamics (exothermic, lower reaction temperatures) and enhanced catalyst stability (prevention of coke deposition on the catalyst surface)."
          [3] "The key scientific challenge that must be overcome remains,however, the prevention of the facile over-oxidation of propene product into more thermodynamically stable CO and CO2 (COx)."

[1] "On the other hand, oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) provides a favorable alternative due to its low energy requirement, no catalyst regeneration obligation, and the elimination of thermodynamic limitations [4, 5]. However, the presence of O2 in the ODH process may lead to the process flammability and the production of carbon oxides due to over-oxidation resulting in poor process selectivity [6, 7]. This problem can be solved by employing a much safer, milder, and readily available carbon dioxide as a soft oxidant."

          [6] "The successful commercial technologies will be those that link catalyst performance characteristics with innovative process designs."
          [7] "However, in the case of alkenes produced from alkanes, the lower cost of the feedstock is not a real incentive, since current commercial technologies for olefin production already use fuel-grade feedstocks."
          [8] "In this case, conversely, the improved energy efficiency (ODH is exothermal, while dehydrogenation and cracking are endothermal), and process simplicity are effective incentives."
          [9] "A large number of reviews dealing with the ODH of light alkanes have been published since the early 1990s [421]."

          [13] "Furthermore, Lange [3] underlined that more exothermal reactions imply higher energy losses (i.e., the difference between the combustion heat of feed and that of the product) and, hence, higher fixed costs, especially if the production of CO2, the main by-product in alkane ODH, is taken into account."





[1] "The co-production of propylene from steam and fluidized crackers is anticipated to be insufficient to satisfy the rapidly growing demand1. Consequently, there is a need for the development of economic on-purpose production techniques to produce additional propylene."
          [2] "The direct dehydrogenation of propane (DDP) is ther- modynamically limited and is highly endothermic (Î”Hr = 29.70 kcal/mol), requiring temperatures that may exceed 973 K for sig- nificant propylene yields2."
          [3] "In principle, the introduction of CO2 as a mild oxidant into the feed alters the dehydrogenation pathway by oxidizing the abstracted hydrogen from the alkane and conse- quently releasing the heat of reaction that reduces operating temperatures2,3."
          [4] "The presence of CO2 can also increase the equili- brium conversion of propane by consuming H2 through the reverse water gas shift reaction (RWGS), as seen in the thermo- dynamic calculations in Fig. 1a."
          [5] "Additionally, unlike regular oxi- dative dehydrogenation with molecular oxygen, CO2 as a mild oxidant suppresses over-oxidation and thus minimizes the pro- duction of carbon oxides."

[1] "Olefins can also be produced from dehydrogenation reactions of alkane feedstocks; however, simple dehydrogenation reactions suffer from numerous limitations that restrict their extensive applications. The limitations include possible side reactions, thermodynamic constraints on selectivity and conversion, the endothermic nature of the process, which necessitates a high energy input, and coke formation resulting in catalytic deactivation."
          [2] "One modification that may overcome many of these problems is oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH), in which an oxidant is added to the reaction feed of a thermal dehydrogenation unit, thereby initiating the reaction via the oxidant rather than high temperature alone."
          [3] "Despite the desirable exothermic nature and the limited coke formation, ODH based on oxygen is confronted with the challenge of over oxidation of olefins to CO and CO2, as well as the possibility of reaction runaway."
          [4] "To suppress the complete oxidation of alkane to COx to ensure a reasonable selectivity while maintaining good conversion of the ODH reactions, application of catalysts has been investigated, and many catalytic systems were found to be active for the process."
          [5] "Supported vanadium-based oxides and mixed-metal oxides are among the most extensively studied because of their high thermal stability, large surface areas, and the favored reducibility and basicity that promote the ODH activity and selectivity."
          [6] "Nevertheless, to date, none of these systems has shown product yields comparable to those obtained by the current industrial technologies of olefin production."

[1] "Propene (C3H6) is among the foundation feedstock for large volume commodities and specialty chemicals, such as cumene, acrylonitrile,propylene oxide and high-purity polypropylene, and its demand is expected to increase significantly in the near future.1 At present, its industrial production is based on non-oxidative processing of petroleum-based materials, via steam cracking, fluid-catalytic- cracking and catalytic dehydrogenation.2 As far as the catalytic dehydrogenation is concerned,commercial processes use Cr2O3/Al2O3 (18-20 Cr wt%; Catofin press) or Pt(<1 wt%),Sn (1-2 wt%)/Al2O3 (Oleflex process).3 Possible replacements with lower costs and sustainable alternatives is attracting a rising interest since many years, and the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of propane appeared among the most promising, because of the higher energy efficiency (ODH is exothermic, while dehydrogenation and cracking are endothermic processes), and process simplicity."
          [2] "A review on the catalysts for propane ODH was compiled by Cavani et al. in 2007,2 who considered the performances in ODH of propane with O2 as oxidant of almost 100 catalysts, with different active phases,reported in literature over the 2000-2006 period, and concluded that the best propylene yields resulting from propane ODH (ca. 30%) were still far from being interesting for industrial implementation, as well as the information concerning catalyst lifetime appeared quite limited."
          [3] "Moreover, in that review the set-up of catalytic materials and/or reactor configurations capable of maintaining high selectivity to propylene under conditions leading to high propane conversion was addressed as main direction for future development."
          [4] "Later on, an initial yield in C3H6 as high as ca. 47%, decreasing to ca. 33% after 8 h on stream were reported for propane dehydrogenation over GaOx based catalysts.4 More recently, the kinetics for the ODH of C3H8 on VOx catalysts was reviewed by Carrero et al., and for the systems considered the combination of reported conversions and selectivities resulted in yields in C3H6 not exceeding 30%.5 Conversely, Ovsitser et al.,reported the attainment of a yield in propene of ca. 40% for the oxidative dehydrogenation of C3H8 under O2 lean-conditions over VOx/SiO2 catalysts, even a quite long reaction time.6 Similar results were obtained by these authors for the oxydative dehydrogenation of iso-C4H10 to iso-C4H8.7 In this respect, the attainment of high selectivity to olefins via ODH of alkanes is basically limited, from a chemical point of view, by the use of O2 as oxidant, because of the occurrence of the over- oxidation to carbon oxides of both fed paraffins and produced olefins."
          [5] "On such a basis, the use of CO2 as mild oxidant has attracted attention after the successful use in other partial oxidation reactions such as dry reforming8,9 and oxidative coupling of methane.10, 11 Although ODH of propane in the presence of CO2 is an endothermic process (H298K= + 166.6 kJ/mol), the addition of a small amount of oxygen can turn the process towards an exothermic character, and additional positive effects towards the catalyst coking might be expected."



[1] "The oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) is a contemporary example of such a challenging reaction. While propene is conventionally produced via steam cracking of large hydrocarbons in naphtha, the more recent trend to use shale gas as feeds to steam cracker units greatly increases the availability of low-cost ethene but also results in a gap between demand and supply of propene, as well as other higher olefins (2, 3). This disparity motivates the exploration of on-purpose propene technologies."
          [2] "Despite non-oxidative propane dehydrogenation being the emerging technology used today, ODHP has the potential to improve reaction efficiency over its non-oxidative counterpart because of favorable thermodynamics (exothermic, lower reaction temperatures) and enhanced catalyst stability (prevention of coke deposition on the catalyst surface)."
          [3] "The key scientific challenge that must be overcome remains,however, the prevention of the facile over-oxidation of propene product into more thermodynamically stable CO and CO2 (COx)."

[1] "Most of the current propylene production is performed by steam cracking (SC) and fluidic catalytic cracking (FCC).1 However, in both the SC and FCC processes, propylene is produced as a by-product and the selectivity and yields are always low.2 The availability of ethane as a major component of natural gas at natural gas prices has attracted many ethylene producers to utilize ethane instead of naphtha as the feedstock in steam crackers. As a result, the ratio of propylene/ethylene produced from steam crackers continues to decline. At the same time, driven by the expanding polypropylene market, the demand ratio of propylene/ethylene is increasing. For these reasons, it becomes increasingly important to develop on-purpose propylene production technologies that offer higher propylene/ethylene production ratios.1 Propane dehydrogenation has long been thought to be an ideal route for propylene production because of the theoretical high propylene selectivity and low capital investment, as well as the independence of the propylene production cost to naphtha price."
          [2] "Propane dehydrogenation is limited by thermodynamics, so that very high reaction temperatures on the order of 1000K are required to give a high single-pass propane conversion.2,4 Hence, the separation of the resulting hydrogen and unreacted propane from propylene becomes an issue."
          [3] "Theoretically, introducing an oxidant can drive the reaction to be more thermodynamically favorable. However, the highest propylene yield reported for propane oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) is only about 30%, owing mainly to the consecutive oxidation of propylene to oxygenated products.2,5 The oxidative dehydrogenation pathways to produce diolefins and aromatics suffer from the same issue."
          [4] "Although many different catalysts, promoters and alternative oxidants have been studied,2,5,6 a commercially viable breakthrough has yet to be achieved."
          [5] "Among the halogens, F2 is inappropriate because of its high reactivity and the unfavorable thermodynamics for its use in a halogenationdehydrohalogenation process. Similarly, Cl2 reactions with alkanes are always fast and non-selective, and under some conditions an explosion may occur.9 I2 reacts selectively, but relatively slowly, with propane at low temperatures to produce propyl iodides and propylene. High propylene yields can be achieved with stoichiometric I2 and propane feeding.10 However, this reaction is only thermodynamically favorable at high temperatures (FigureS1). Furthermore, as a stoichiometric reaction of I2 with propane is needed, the recycling efficiency of the relatively expensive I2 greatly limits the potential industrial application of this process.11"
          [6] "Compared to chlorine and iodine, reactions of bromine with propane are more feasible. However, to resolve the polyhalogenation selectivity issue in gaseous alkane bromination processes, a higher propane to bromine ratio is required to avoid the formation of 2,2-C3H6Br2.7 Consequently, single-pass propane conversion, using present technology, has limited utility."





Propane oxydehydrogenation combining high propane conversion and high propylene selectivity has proved an elusive goal, and propane oxydehydrogenation as a route to propylene appears to be far from realizing its commercialization potential. One difficulty is that propylene is more easily oxidized than is propane, so that selectivity tends to decline rapidly with conversion. Another is that at temperatures above about 700 C, propane cracking becomes significant, and a variety of products other than propylene are produced.

          [2] "The direct dehydrogenation of propane (DDP) is ther- modynamically limited and is highly endothermic (Î”Hr = 29.70 kcal/mol), requiring temperatures that may exceed 973 K for sig- nificant propylene yields2."

[1] "Olefins can also be produced from dehydrogenation reactions of alkane feedstocks; however, simple dehydrogenation reactions suffer from numerous limitations that restrict their extensive applications. The limitations include possible side reactions, thermodynamic constraints on selectivity and conversion, the endothermic nature of the process, which necessitates a high energy input, and coke formation resulting in catalytic deactivation."
          [2] "One modification that may overcome many of these problems is oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH), in which an oxidant is added to the reaction feed of a thermal dehydrogenation unit, thereby initiating the reaction via the oxidant rather than high temperature alone."

          [2] "A review on the catalysts for propane ODH was compiled by Cavani et al. in 2007,2 who considered the performances in ODH of propane with O2 as oxidant of almost 100 catalysts, with different active phases,reported in literature over the 2000-2006 period, and concluded that the best propylene yields resulting from propane ODH (ca. 30%) were still far from being interesting for industrial implementation, as well as the information concerning catalyst lifetime appeared quite limited."
          [3] "Moreover, in that review the set-up of catalytic materials and/or reactor configurations capable of maintaining high selectivity to propylene under conditions leading to high propane conversion was addressed as main direction for future development."
          [4] "Later on, an initial yield in C3H6 as high as ca. 47%, decreasing to ca. 33% after 8 h on stream were reported for propane dehydrogenation over GaOx based catalysts.4 More recently, the kinetics for the ODH of C3H8 on VOx catalysts was reviewed by Carrero et al., and for the systems considered the combination of reported conversions and selectivities resulted in yields in C3H6 not exceeding 30%.5 Conversely, Ovsitser et al.,reported the attainment of a yield in propene of ca. 40% for the oxidative dehydrogenation of C3H8 under O2 lean-conditions over VOx/SiO2 catalysts, even a quite long reaction time.6 Similar results were obtained by these authors for the oxydative dehydrogenation of iso-C4H10 to iso-C4H8.7 In this respect, the attainment of high selectivity to olefins via ODH of alkanes is basically limited, from a chemical point of view, by the use of O2 as oxidant, because of the occurrence of the over- oxidation to carbon oxides of both fed paraffins and produced olefins."

[1] "The oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) is a contemporary example of such a challenging reaction. While propene is conventionally produced via steam cracking of large hydrocarbons in naphtha, the more recent trend to use shale gas as feeds to steam cracker units greatly increases the availability of low-cost ethene but also results in a gap between demand and supply of propene, as well as other higher olefins (2, 3). This disparity motivates the exploration of on-purpose propene technologies."
          [2] "Despite non-oxidative propane dehydrogenation being the emerging technology used today, ODHP has the potential to improve reaction efficiency over its non-oxidative counterpart because of favorable thermodynamics (exothermic, lower reaction temperatures) and enhanced catalyst stability (prevention of coke deposition on the catalyst surface)."

[1] "Most of the current propylene production is performed by steam cracking (SC) and fluidic catalytic cracking (FCC).1 However, in both the SC and FCC processes, propylene is produced as a by-product and the selectivity and yields are always low.2 The availability of ethane as a major component of natural gas at natural gas prices has attracted many ethylene producers to utilize ethane instead of naphtha as the feedstock in steam crackers. As a result, the ratio of propylene/ethylene produced from steam crackers continues to decline. At the same time, driven by the expanding polypropylene market, the demand ratio of propylene/ethylene is increasing. For these reasons, it becomes increasingly important to develop on-purpose propylene production technologies that offer higher propylene/ethylene production ratios.1 Propane dehydrogenation has long been thought to be an ideal route for propylene production because of the theoretical high propylene selectivity and low capital investment, as well as the independence of the propylene production cost to naphtha price."
          [2] "Propane dehydrogenation is limited by thermodynamics, so that very high reaction temperatures on the order of 1000K are required to give a high single-pass propane conversion.2,4 Hence, the separation of the resulting hydrogen and unreacted propane from propylene becomes an issue."
          [3] "Theoretically, introducing an oxidant can drive the reaction to be more thermodynamically favorable. However, the highest propylene yield reported for propane oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) is only about 30%, owing mainly to the consecutive oxidation of propylene to oxygenated products.2,5 The oxidative dehydrogenation pathways to produce diolefins and aromatics suffer from the same issue."
          [4] "Although many different catalysts, promoters and alternative oxidants have been studied,2,5,6 a commercially viable breakthrough has yet to be achieved."
          [5] "Among the halogens, F2 is inappropriate because of its high reactivity and the unfavorable thermodynamics for its use in a halogenationdehydrohalogenation process. Similarly, Cl2 reactions with alkanes are always fast and non-selective, and under some conditions an explosion may occur.9 I2 reacts selectively, but relatively slowly, with propane at low temperatures to produce propyl iodides and propylene. High propylene yields can be achieved with stoichiometric I2 and propane feeding.10 However, this reaction is only thermodynamically favorable at high temperatures (FigureS1). Furthermore, as a stoichiometric reaction of I2 with propane is needed, the recycling efficiency of the relatively expensive I2 greatly limits the potential industrial application of this process.11"
          [6] "Compared to chlorine and iodine, reactions of bromine with propane are more feasible. However, to resolve the polyhalogenation selectivity issue in gaseous alkane bromination processes, a higher propane to bromine ratio is required to avoid the formation of 2,2-C3H6Br2.7 Consequently, single-pass propane conversion, using present technology, has limited utility."





Propane oxydehydrogenation combining high propane conversion and high propylene selectivity has proved an elusive goal, and propane oxydehydrogenation as a route to propylene appears to be far from realizing its commercialization potential. One difficulty is that propylene is more easily oxidized than is propane, so that selectivity tends to decline rapidly with conversion. Another is that at temperatures above about 700 C, propane cracking becomes significant, and a variety of products other than propylene are produced.



[1] "At present, propylene is mainly produced by steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) of naphtha, light diesel, and other oil byproducts, as well as direct dehydrogenation of propane (DHP)."
          [2] "Yet, the dehydrogenation process suffers from two inherent drawbacks: (i) the endothermicity-induced thermodynamic limit for C3H8 conversion that demands high-energy input and (ii) the rapid catalyst deactivation because of coke formation."

[1] "Propane direct dehydrogenation (DH) as well as oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) have attracted worldwide academic and industrial interests, but both suffer from limitations that have been reviewed extensively elsewhere1-3."
          [2] "Propane DH is an endothermic reaction and thus high temperatures are required to achieve acceptable olefin yields."
          [3] "The CATOFIN dehydrogenation process4-5 provides 850000 MTA (million metric tons annually) of propylene with minimum of 99.5% purity and is based on chromium oxide supported on activated alumina."
          [4] "The Oleflex dehydrogenation process4-5 relies on the traditional Pt/Sn catalytic system to produce polymer grade propylene."
          [5] "The high operating temperature as well as the cost of the Pt catalysts comprise the main drawbacks."
          [6] "In addition,the reaction is usually accompanied by catalyst deactivation due to coke formation and spatial separation of Pt-Sn species thus highlighting the stability of catalysts used among the major botlenecks6-7."
          [7] "On the other hand, although the exothermic character of propane ODH with O2 has the potential to significantly reduce the reaction temperature, the fate of the desired propylene is difficult to be controlled due to unavoidable combustion of propane as well as of propylene to carbon monoxide and/or dioxide thus significantly lowering propylene selectivity."
          [8] "The use of CO2 as, alternative to oxygen, soft oxidant has the potential to i) avoid deep oxidation of alkanes/alkenes, ii) reduce coke formation and iii) favor propane conversion due to participation of the produced hydrogen in the reverse water- gas shift reaction (RWGS)."

[1] "The demand for olefins, especially propylene, is expected to increase significantly in the near future. Steam cracking, Fluid Cat- alytic Cracking (FCC) and dehydrogenation (DH) are the primary methods to obtain olefins. Although these methods are commonly used to produce alkenes, they have some disadvantages: they are endothermic and suffer from the production of coke. In case of DH, alkane conversion is limited by thermodynamic constraints [15]."
          [2] "An attractive alternative to this approach is the oxidative dehy- drogenation of propane (ODP) by molecular oxygen, which enables lower reaction temperatures and more effective inhibition of sur- face coke formation. The primary drawback of this process is a low propylene selectivity due to total oxidation of propane and propylene at high conversion. Thus there is an ongoing search for a selective catalyst in this process."

[1] "Propylene is an important raw material in the production of polypropylene,polyacrylonitrile, acrolein, and acrylic acid. The conventional manufacturing methods such as catalytic and steam cracking which produce propylene as a byproduct do not meet the everincreasing demand. Therefore, propane dehydrogenation (PDH) has received much attention (HeinritzAdrian et al., 2008):"
          [2] "Direct catalytic dehydrogenation of hydrocarbons is characterized by low conversion per pass and low yields due to equilibrium limitation. The process is endothermic and the thermodynamic equilibrium is unfavorable (Olah and Molnar, 2003). Temperatures above 800 K are required for commercially feasible conversions. At these temperatures,undesirable side reactions limit the propylene yield and coke formation necessitates frequent catalyst regeneration."
          [3] "Catalytic oxidative dehydrogenation of propane by oxygen is an attractive alternative because it is an exothermic and nonthermodynamically limited reaction. However, the propylene selectivity of the reaction remains an unsolved problem owing to the over oxidation of propane (Xu et al., 2006)."
          [4] "On the other hand, soft oxidants such as carbon dioxide appear as potential alternatives. The PDH in the presence of carbon dioxide (CO2PDH) is also of interest because it utilizes the greenhouse gas CO2 (Zangeneh et al., 2011)."
          [5] "CO2 is a coke removing agent as well. Bartholomew (1984) reported that oxidizability in the gasification of coke was in the following order: O2(105) > H2O(3) > CO2(1) > H2(0.003), where numbers in parentheses indicate the relative ratios of the gasification with oxidants."
          [6] "The promoting effect of CO2 is explained either by consumption of the hydrogen in the reverse watergas shift reaction  RWGS (reaction 2), which shifts the equilibrium of propane dehydrogenation to completion (twostep pathway) or its participation in direct oxidation of propane to propylene (reaction 3) (onestep pathway):"
          [7] "The oxide catalysts which are active in the nonoxidative dehydrogenation of propane are also active in the process with CO2. Many bulk and supported oxidebased materials containing active species, such as Cr (Michorczyk and Ogonowski, 2003; Michorczyk et al., 2008; Michorczyk et al., 2010; Michorczyk et al., 2011), Ga (Michorczyk et al., 2003; Xu et al., 2006), V (Takahara et al., 2005; Ogonowski and Skrzynska, 2008) and Fe (Michorczyk et al., 2004) have been studied as catalysts for dehydrogenation of propane in the presence of CO2. Among the investigated materials, those containing Cr or Ga were found to be the most active and selective (Michorczyk et al., 2011)."
          [8] "Propane dehydrogenation with carbon dioxide is characterized by rapid catalyst deactivation due to coke formation. Ga2O3 showed drastic deactivation during a few hours on stream (Zheng et al., 2005). Besides coke formation, the reduction of Cr(VI) to Cr(III) is responsible for deactivation of chromium based catalysts (Zhang et al., 2011)."

[1] "On the other hand, oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) provides a favorable alternative due to its low energy requirement, no catalyst regeneration obligation, and the elimination of thermodynamic limitations [4, 5]. However, the presence of O2 in the ODH process may lead to the process flammability and the production of carbon oxides due to over-oxidation resulting in poor process selectivity [6, 7]. This problem can be solved by employing a much safer, milder, and readily available carbon dioxide as a soft oxidant."

[1] "In steam cracking, ethylene is the preferred product, but the demand for propylene is growing faster than that for ethylene, especially in Western Europe [1]. Also, in the case of FCC, smaller amounts of propylene are produced."
          [2] "Dehydrogenations thermodynamic constraints limit alkane conversion; furthermore, a major problem is coking, which causes rapid catalyst deactivation."
          [3] "Therefore, the need exists for new technologies devoted to the production of specific olefins, which have none of the disadvantages characterizing dehydrogenation."
          [4] "In fact, the production of chemicals starting from alkanes by means of oxidative processes has been one of the most studied topics in recent decades."
          [5] "The effectiveness of the catalyst, that is the activity for alkane conversion and the selectivity to desired products, will ultimately determine the economic attractiveness of an alkane-based chemical process."
          [6] "The successful commercial technologies will be those that link catalyst performance characteristics with innovative process designs."
          [7] "However, in the case of alkenes produced from alkanes, the lower cost of the feedstock is not a real incentive, since current commercial technologies for olefin production already use fuel-grade feedstocks."
          [8] "In this case, conversely, the improved energy efficiency (ODH is exothermal, while dehydrogenation and cracking are endothermal), and process simplicity are effective incentives."
          [9] "A large number of reviews dealing with the ODH of light alkanes have been published since the early 1990s [421]."
          [10] "In the present review, we attempt to offer an answer to the following questions on the scientific and technological aspects of ethane and propane ODH: Which key factors are the chief determinants of the performance of metal oxide-based catalysts?"

          [2] "Propane dehydrogenation is limited by thermodynamics, so that very high reaction temperatures on the order of 1000K are required to give a high single-pass propane conversion.2,4 Hence, the separation of the resulting hydrogen and unreacted propane from propylene becomes an issue."
          [3] "Theoretically, introducing an oxidant can drive the reaction to be more thermodynamically favorable. However, the highest propylene yield reported for propane oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) is only about 30%, owing mainly to the consecutive oxidation of propylene to oxygenated products.2,5 The oxidative dehydrogenation pathways to produce diolefins and aromatics suffer from the same issue."
          [4] "Although many different catalysts, promoters and alternative oxidants have been studied,2,5,6 a commercially viable breakthrough has yet to be achieved."
          [5] "Among the halogens, F2 is inappropriate because of its high reactivity and the unfavorable thermodynamics for its use in a halogenationdehydrohalogenation process. Similarly, Cl2 reactions with alkanes are always fast and non-selective, and under some conditions an explosion may occur.9 I2 reacts selectively, but relatively slowly, with propane at low temperatures to produce propyl iodides and propylene. High propylene yields can be achieved with stoichiometric I2 and propane feeding.10 However, this reaction is only thermodynamically favorable at high temperatures (FigureS1). Furthermore, as a stoichiometric reaction of I2 with propane is needed, the recycling efficiency of the relatively expensive I2 greatly limits the potential industrial application of this process.11"
          [6] "Compared to chlorine and iodine, reactions of bromine with propane are more feasible. However, to resolve the polyhalogenation selectivity issue in gaseous alkane bromination processes, a higher propane to bromine ratio is required to avoid the formation of 2,2-C3H6Br2.7 Consequently, single-pass propane conversion, using present technology, has limited utility."





Propane oxydehydrogenation combining high propane conversion and high propylene selectivity has proved an elusive goal, and propane oxydehydrogenation as a route to propylene appears to be far from realizing its commercialization potential. One difficulty is that propylene is more easily oxidized than is propane, so that selectivity tends to decline rapidly with conversion. Another is that at temperatures above about 700 C, propane cracking becomes significant, and a variety of products other than propylene are produced.



[1] "At present, propylene is mainly produced by steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) of naphtha, light diesel, and other oil byproducts, as well as direct dehydrogenation of propane (DHP)."
          [2] "Yet, the dehydrogenation process suffers from two inherent drawbacks: (i) the endothermicity-induced thermodynamic limit for C3H8 conversion that demands high-energy input and (ii) the rapid catalyst deactivation because of coke formation."
          [3] "Alternatively, oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) is attractive because of its exothermicity, which makes it free from the thermodynamic restraint at lower temperatures."
          [4] "Though major progress has been made by using redox-active transition metal oxide catalysts, such as vanadium (1,6) and molybdenum, the presence of O2 can cause overoxidation of olefins to carbon oxides (COx), resulting in the inefficient use of the reactant and low process selectivity."

[1] "Propane direct dehydrogenation (DH) as well as oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) have attracted worldwide academic and industrial interests, but both suffer from limitations that have been reviewed extensively elsewhere1-3."
          [2] "Propane DH is an endothermic reaction and thus high temperatures are required to achieve acceptable olefin yields."
          [3] "The CATOFIN dehydrogenation process4-5 provides 850000 MTA (million metric tons annually) of propylene with minimum of 99.5% purity and is based on chromium oxide supported on activated alumina."
          [4] "The Oleflex dehydrogenation process4-5 relies on the traditional Pt/Sn catalytic system to produce polymer grade propylene."
          [5] "The high operating temperature as well as the cost of the Pt catalysts comprise the main drawbacks."
          [6] "In addition,the reaction is usually accompanied by catalyst deactivation due to coke formation and spatial separation of Pt-Sn species thus highlighting the stability of catalysts used among the major botlenecks6-7."
          [7] "On the other hand, although the exothermic character of propane ODH with O2 has the potential to significantly reduce the reaction temperature, the fate of the desired propylene is difficult to be controlled due to unavoidable combustion of propane as well as of propylene to carbon monoxide and/or dioxide thus significantly lowering propylene selectivity."
          [8] "The use of CO2 as, alternative to oxygen, soft oxidant has the potential to i) avoid deep oxidation of alkanes/alkenes, ii) reduce coke formation and iii) favor propane conversion due to participation of the produced hydrogen in the reverse water- gas shift reaction (RWGS)."

[1] "The demand for olefins, especially propylene, is expected to increase significantly in the near future. Steam cracking, Fluid Cat- alytic Cracking (FCC) and dehydrogenation (DH) are the primary methods to obtain olefins. Although these methods are commonly used to produce alkenes, they have some disadvantages: they are endothermic and suffer from the production of coke. In case of DH, alkane conversion is limited by thermodynamic constraints [15]."
          [2] "An attractive alternative to this approach is the oxidative dehy- drogenation of propane (ODP) by molecular oxygen, which enables lower reaction temperatures and more effective inhibition of sur- face coke formation. The primary drawback of this process is a low propylene selectivity due to total oxidation of propane and propylene at high conversion. Thus there is an ongoing search for a selective catalyst in this process."

[1] "Propylene is an important raw material in the production of polypropylene,polyacrylonitrile, acrolein, and acrylic acid. The conventional manufacturing methods such as catalytic and steam cracking which produce propylene as a byproduct do not meet the everincreasing demand. Therefore, propane dehydrogenation (PDH) has received much attention (HeinritzAdrian et al., 2008):"
          [2] "Direct catalytic dehydrogenation of hydrocarbons is characterized by low conversion per pass and low yields due to equilibrium limitation. The process is endothermic and the thermodynamic equilibrium is unfavorable (Olah and Molnar, 2003). Temperatures above 800 K are required for commercially feasible conversions. At these temperatures,undesirable side reactions limit the propylene yield and coke formation necessitates frequent catalyst regeneration."
          [3] "Catalytic oxidative dehydrogenation of propane by oxygen is an attractive alternative because it is an exothermic and nonthermodynamically limited reaction. However, the propylene selectivity of the reaction remains an unsolved problem owing to the over oxidation of propane (Xu et al., 2006)."
          [4] "On the other hand, soft oxidants such as carbon dioxide appear as potential alternatives. The PDH in the presence of carbon dioxide (CO2PDH) is also of interest because it utilizes the greenhouse gas CO2 (Zangeneh et al., 2011)."
          [5] "CO2 is a coke removing agent as well. Bartholomew (1984) reported that oxidizability in the gasification of coke was in the following order: O2(105) > H2O(3) > CO2(1) > H2(0.003), where numbers in parentheses indicate the relative ratios of the gasification with oxidants."
          [6] "The promoting effect of CO2 is explained either by consumption of the hydrogen in the reverse watergas shift reaction  RWGS (reaction 2), which shifts the equilibrium of propane dehydrogenation to completion (twostep pathway) or its participation in direct oxidation of propane to propylene (reaction 3) (onestep pathway):"
          [7] "The oxide catalysts which are active in the nonoxidative dehydrogenation of propane are also active in the process with CO2. Many bulk and supported oxidebased materials containing active species, such as Cr (Michorczyk and Ogonowski, 2003; Michorczyk et al., 2008; Michorczyk et al., 2010; Michorczyk et al., 2011), Ga (Michorczyk et al., 2003; Xu et al., 2006), V (Takahara et al., 2005; Ogonowski and Skrzynska, 2008) and Fe (Michorczyk et al., 2004) have been studied as catalysts for dehydrogenation of propane in the presence of CO2. Among the investigated materials, those containing Cr or Ga were found to be the most active and selective (Michorczyk et al., 2011)."
          [8] "Propane dehydrogenation with carbon dioxide is characterized by rapid catalyst deactivation due to coke formation. Ga2O3 showed drastic deactivation during a few hours on stream (Zheng et al., 2005). Besides coke formation, the reduction of Cr(VI) to Cr(III) is responsible for deactivation of chromium based catalysts (Zhang et al., 2011)."

[1] "On the other hand, oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) provides a favorable alternative due to its low energy requirement, no catalyst regeneration obligation, and the elimination of thermodynamic limitations [4, 5]. However, the presence of O2 in the ODH process may lead to the process flammability and the production of carbon oxides due to over-oxidation resulting in poor process selectivity [6, 7]. This problem can be solved by employing a much safer, milder, and readily available carbon dioxide as a soft oxidant."

[1] "In steam cracking, ethylene is the preferred product, but the demand for propylene is growing faster than that for ethylene, especially in Western Europe [1]. Also, in the case of FCC, smaller amounts of propylene are produced."
          [2] "Dehydrogenations thermodynamic constraints limit alkane conversion; furthermore, a major problem is coking, which causes rapid catalyst deactivation."
          [3] "Therefore, the need exists for new technologies devoted to the production of specific olefins, which have none of the disadvantages characterizing dehydrogenation."
          [4] "In fact, the production of chemicals starting from alkanes by means of oxidative processes has been one of the most studied topics in recent decades."
          [5] "The effectiveness of the catalyst, that is the activity for alkane conversion and the selectivity to desired products, will ultimately determine the economic attractiveness of an alkane-based chemical process."
          [6] "The successful commercial technologies will be those that link catalyst performance characteristics with innovative process designs."
          [7] "However, in the case of alkenes produced from alkanes, the lower cost of the feedstock is not a real incentive, since current commercial technologies for olefin production already use fuel-grade feedstocks."
          [8] "In this case, conversely, the improved energy efficiency (ODH is exothermal, while dehydrogenation and cracking are endothermal), and process simplicity are effective incentives."
          [9] "A large number of reviews dealing with the ODH of light alkanes have been published since the early 1990s [421]."
          [10] "In the present review, we attempt to offer an answer to the following questions on the scientific and technological aspects of ethane and propane ODH: Which key factors are the chief determinants of the performance of metal oxide-based catalysts?"
          [11] "Have research efforts led to catalysts that can oxidize alkanes to olefins with yields comparable to those obtained with current technologies for alkenes production?"
          [12] "Does the use of either peculiar reactor configurations (e.g.,membrane-type reactors) or non-conventional methods for the conduction of reactions (e.g., cyclic feeding of reactants) make it possible to improve performances as compared to the traditional configurations?"
          [13] "Furthermore, Lange [3] underlined that more exothermal reactions imply higher energy losses (i.e., the difference between the combustion heat of feed and that of the product) and, hence, higher fixed costs, especially if the production of CO2, the main by-product in alkane ODH, is taken into account."





[1] "The co-production of propylene from steam and fluidized crackers is anticipated to be insufficient to satisfy the rapidly growing demand1. Consequently, there is a need for the development of economic on-purpose production techniques to produce additional propylene."
          [2] "The direct dehydrogenation of propane (DDP) is ther- modynamically limited and is highly endothermic (Î”Hr = 29.70 kcal/mol), requiring temperatures that may exceed 973 K for sig- nificant propylene yields2."
          [3] "In principle, the introduction of CO2 as a mild oxidant into the feed alters the dehydrogenation pathway by oxidizing the abstracted hydrogen from the alkane and conse- quently releasing the heat of reaction that reduces operating temperatures2,3."
          [4] "The presence of CO2 can also increase the equili- brium conversion of propane by consuming H2 through the reverse water gas shift reaction (RWGS), as seen in the thermo- dynamic calculations in Fig. 1a."
          [5] "Additionally, unlike regular oxi- dative dehydrogenation with molecular oxygen, CO2 as a mild oxidant suppresses over-oxidation and thus minimizes the pro- duction of carbon oxides."

[1] "Olefins can also be produced from dehydrogenation reactions of alkane feedstocks; however, simple dehydrogenation reactions suffer from numerous limitations that restrict their extensive applications. The limitations include possible side reactions, thermodynamic constraints on selectivity and conversion, the endothermic nature of the process, which necessitates a high energy input, and coke formation resulting in catalytic deactivation."
          [2] "One modification that may overcome many of these problems is oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH), in which an oxidant is added to the reaction feed of a thermal dehydrogenation unit, thereby initiating the reaction via the oxidant rather than high temperature alone."
          [3] "Despite the desirable exothermic nature and the limited coke formation, ODH based on oxygen is confronted with the challenge of over oxidation of olefins to CO and CO2, as well as the possibility of reaction runaway."
          [4] "To suppress the complete oxidation of alkane to COx to ensure a reasonable selectivity while maintaining good conversion of the ODH reactions, application of catalysts has been investigated, and many catalytic systems were found to be active for the process."
          [5] "Supported vanadium-based oxides and mixed-metal oxides are among the most extensively studied because of their high thermal stability, large surface areas, and the favored reducibility and basicity that promote the ODH activity and selectivity."
          [6] "Nevertheless, to date, none of these systems has shown product yields comparable to those obtained by the current industrial technologies of olefin production."

[1] "Propene (C3H6) is among the foundation feedstock for large volume commodities and specialty chemicals, such as cumene, acrylonitrile,propylene oxide and high-purity polypropylene, and its demand is expected to increase significantly in the near future.1 At present, its industrial production is based on non-oxidative processing of petroleum-based materials, via steam cracking, fluid-catalytic- cracking and catalytic dehydrogenation.2 As far as the catalytic dehydrogenation is concerned,commercial processes use Cr2O3/Al2O3 (18-20 Cr wt%; Catofin press) or Pt(<1 wt%),Sn (1-2 wt%)/Al2O3 (Oleflex process).3 Possible replacements with lower costs and sustainable alternatives is attracting a rising interest since many years, and the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of propane appeared among the most promising, because of the higher energy efficiency (ODH is exothermic, while dehydrogenation and cracking are endothermic processes), and process simplicity."
          [2] "A review on the catalysts for propane ODH was compiled by Cavani et al. in 2007,2 who considered the performances in ODH of propane with O2 as oxidant of almost 100 catalysts, with different active phases,reported in literature over the 2000-2006 period, and concluded that the best propylene yields resulting from propane ODH (ca. 30%) were still far from being interesting for industrial implementation, as well as the information concerning catalyst lifetime appeared quite limited."
          [3] "Moreover, in that review the set-up of catalytic materials and/or reactor configurations capable of maintaining high selectivity to propylene under conditions leading to high propane conversion was addressed as main direction for future development."
          [4] "Later on, an initial yield in C3H6 as high as ca. 47%, decreasing to ca. 33% after 8 h on stream were reported for propane dehydrogenation over GaOx based catalysts.4 More recently, the kinetics for the ODH of C3H8 on VOx catalysts was reviewed by Carrero et al., and for the systems considered the combination of reported conversions and selectivities resulted in yields in C3H6 not exceeding 30%.5 Conversely, Ovsitser et al.,reported the attainment of a yield in propene of ca. 40% for the oxidative dehydrogenation of C3H8 under O2 lean-conditions over VOx/SiO2 catalysts, even a quite long reaction time.6 Similar results were obtained by these authors for the oxydative dehydrogenation of iso-C4H10 to iso-C4H8.7 In this respect, the attainment of high selectivity to olefins via ODH of alkanes is basically limited, from a chemical point of view, by the use of O2 as oxidant, because of the occurrence of the over- oxidation to carbon oxides of both fed paraffins and produced olefins."
          [5] "On such a basis, the use of CO2 as mild oxidant has attracted attention after the successful use in other partial oxidation reactions such as dry reforming8,9 and oxidative coupling of methane.10, 11 Although ODH of propane in the presence of CO2 is an endothermic process (H298K= + 166.6 kJ/mol), the addition of a small amount of oxygen can turn the process towards an exothermic character, and additional positive effects towards the catalyst coking might be expected."



[1] "The oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) is a contemporary example of such a challenging reaction. While propene is conventionally produced via steam cracking of large hydrocarbons in naphtha, the more recent trend to use shale gas as feeds to steam cracker units greatly increases the availability of low-cost ethene but also results in a gap between demand and supply of propene, as well as other higher olefins (2, 3). This disparity motivates the exploration of on-purpose propene technologies."
          [2] "Despite non-oxidative propane dehydrogenation being the emerging technology used today, ODHP has the potential to improve reaction efficiency over its non-oxidative counterpart because of favorable thermodynamics (exothermic, lower reaction temperatures) and enhanced catalyst stability (prevention of coke deposition on the catalyst surface)."
          [3] "The key scientific challenge that must be overcome remains,however, the prevention of the facile over-oxidation of propene product into more thermodynamically stable CO and CO2 (COx)."

[1] "Most of the current propylene production is performed by steam cracking (SC) and fluidic catalytic cracking (FCC).1 However, in both the SC and FCC processes, propylene is produced as a by-product and the selectivity and yields are always low.2 The availability of ethane as a major component of natural gas at natural gas prices has attracted many ethylene producers to utilize ethane instead of naphtha as the feedstock in steam crackers. As a result, the ratio of propylene/ethylene produced from steam crackers continues to decline. At the same time, driven by the expanding polypropylene market, the demand ratio of propylene/ethylene is increasing. For these reasons, it becomes increasingly important to develop on-purpose propylene production technologies that offer higher propylene/ethylene production ratios.1 Propane dehydrogenation has long been thought to be an ideal route for propylene production because of the theoretical high propylene selectivity and low capital investment, as well as the independence of the propylene production cost to naphtha price."

          [7] "On the other hand, although the exothermic character of propane ODH with O2 has the potential to significantly reduce the reaction temperature, the fate of the desired propylene is difficult to be controlled due to unavoidable combustion of propane as well as of propylene to carbon monoxide and/or dioxide thus significantly lowering propylene selectivity."
          [8] "The use of CO2 as, alternative to oxygen, soft oxidant has the potential to i) avoid deep oxidation of alkanes/alkenes, ii) reduce coke formation and iii) favor propane conversion due to participation of the produced hydrogen in the reverse water- gas shift reaction (RWGS)."

[1] "The demand for olefins, especially propylene, is expected to increase significantly in the near future. Steam cracking, Fluid Cat- alytic Cracking (FCC) and dehydrogenation (DH) are the primary methods to obtain olefins. Although these methods are commonly used to produce alkenes, they have some disadvantages: they are endothermic and suffer from the production of coke. In case of DH, alkane conversion is limited by thermodynamic constraints [15]."
          [2] "An attractive alternative to this approach is the oxidative dehy- drogenation of propane (ODP) by molecular oxygen, which enables lower reaction temperatures and more effective inhibition of sur- face coke formation. The primary drawback of this process is a low propylene selectivity due to total oxidation of propane and propylene at high conversion. Thus there is an ongoing search for a selective catalyst in this process."

[1] "Propylene is an important raw material in the production of polypropylene,polyacrylonitrile, acrolein, and acrylic acid. The conventional manufacturing methods such as catalytic and steam cracking which produce propylene as a byproduct do not meet the everincreasing demand. Therefore, propane dehydrogenation (PDH) has received much attention (HeinritzAdrian et al., 2008):"
          [2] "Direct catalytic dehydrogenation of hydrocarbons is characterized by low conversion per pass and low yields due to equilibrium limitation. The process is endothermic and the thermodynamic equilibrium is unfavorable (Olah and Molnar, 2003). Temperatures above 800 K are required for commercially feasible conversions. At these temperatures,undesirable side reactions limit the propylene yield and coke formation necessitates frequent catalyst regeneration."
          [3] "Catalytic oxidative dehydrogenation of propane by oxygen is an attractive alternative because it is an exothermic and nonthermodynamically limited reaction. However, the propylene selectivity of the reaction remains an unsolved problem owing to the over oxidation of propane (Xu et al., 2006)."
          [4] "On the other hand, soft oxidants such as carbon dioxide appear as potential alternatives. The PDH in the presence of carbon dioxide (CO2PDH) is also of interest because it utilizes the greenhouse gas CO2 (Zangeneh et al., 2011)."
          [5] "CO2 is a coke removing agent as well. Bartholomew (1984) reported that oxidizability in the gasification of coke was in the following order: O2(105) > H2O(3) > CO2(1) > H2(0.003), where numbers in parentheses indicate the relative ratios of the gasification with oxidants."
          [6] "The promoting effect of CO2 is explained either by consumption of the hydrogen in the reverse watergas shift reaction  RWGS (reaction 2), which shifts the equilibrium of propane dehydrogenation to completion (twostep pathway) or its participation in direct oxidation of propane to propylene (reaction 3) (onestep pathway):"
          [7] "The oxide catalysts which are active in the nonoxidative dehydrogenation of propane are also active in the process with CO2. Many bulk and supported oxidebased materials containing active species, such as Cr (Michorczyk and Ogonowski, 2003; Michorczyk et al., 2008; Michorczyk et al., 2010; Michorczyk et al., 2011), Ga (Michorczyk et al., 2003; Xu et al., 2006), V (Takahara et al., 2005; Ogonowski and Skrzynska, 2008) and Fe (Michorczyk et al., 2004) have been studied as catalysts for dehydrogenation of propane in the presence of CO2. Among the investigated materials, those containing Cr or Ga were found to be the most active and selective (Michorczyk et al., 2011)."
          [8] "Propane dehydrogenation with carbon dioxide is characterized by rapid catalyst deactivation due to coke formation. Ga2O3 showed drastic deactivation during a few hours on stream (Zheng et al., 2005). Besides coke formation, the reduction of Cr(VI) to Cr(III) is responsible for deactivation of chromium based catalysts (Zhang et al., 2011)."

[1] "On the other hand, oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) provides a favorable alternative due to its low energy requirement, no catalyst regeneration obligation, and the elimination of thermodynamic limitations [4, 5]. However, the presence of O2 in the ODH process may lead to the process flammability and the production of carbon oxides due to over-oxidation resulting in poor process selectivity [6, 7]. This problem can be solved by employing a much safer, milder, and readily available carbon dioxide as a soft oxidant."
