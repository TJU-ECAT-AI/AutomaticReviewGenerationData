          The primary challenges in current propylene production methods, such as cracking and dehydrogenation, include high energy consumption, significant coke formation, and the need for high temperatures. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by operating at lower temperatures due to the presence of oxygen, which inhibits coke formation. However, ODHP presents its own set of advantages and limitations, particularly in the context of oxidant selection. Oxygen is a preferred oxidant due to its ability to promote selectivity for propene, but the unselective combustion reactions limit alkene selectivities. The presence of oxygen can lead to the over-oxidation of propene to carbon oxides, which decreases propene yields. The use of oxygen also requires careful control of reaction conditions to prevent explosive mixtures and manage the exothermic nature of the reaction. Oxygen is a highly effective oxidant for ODHP, promoting high propylene yields. However, the use of oxygen also presents challenges, including the risk of explosive mixtures and the potential for over-oxidation, leading to the formation of carbon oxides. The introduction of H2S in the feed mixture has been shown to enhance the selectivity for propylene, likely by modifying the reaction pathway and suppressing over-oxidation. Oxygen is a preferred oxidant due to its ability to promote selectivity for propene, but the unselective combustion reactions limit alkene selectivities. The use of oxygen also leads to extensive selectivity losses with increasing conversion, due to propene re-adsorption and subsequent oxidation to carbon oxides, resulting in propene yields lower than 30%.

          当前丙烯生产方法的主要挑战，如裂解和脱氢，包括高能耗、大量焦炭形成和需要高温。丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）通过在较低温度下运行来解决这些问题，这是因为氧气的存在抑制了焦炭的形成。然而，ODHP在氧化剂选择方面具有自身的一系列优势和局限性。氧气是首选的氧化剂，因为它能够促进丙烯的选择性，但非选择性燃烧反应限制了烯烃的选择性。氧气的存在可能导致丙烯过度氧化为碳氧化物，从而降低丙烯的产量。氧气的使用还需要仔细控制反应条件，以防止爆炸性混合物的形成，并管理反应的放热性质。氧气是ODHP的有效氧化剂，可以促进高丙烯产量。然而，氧气的使用也带来了挑战，包括爆炸混合物的风险和过度氧化的可能，导致碳氧化物的形成。在进料混合物中引入H2S已被证明可以提高丙烯的选择性，这可能是通过改变反应途径和抑制过度氧化来实现的。氧气是首选的氧化剂，因为它能促进丙烯的选择性，但非选择性燃烧反应限制了烯烃的选择性。氧气的使用也会导致随着转化率的增加，选择性损失严重，这是由于丙烯的再吸附和随后氧化为一氧化碳和二氧化碳，导致丙烯产量低于30%。
