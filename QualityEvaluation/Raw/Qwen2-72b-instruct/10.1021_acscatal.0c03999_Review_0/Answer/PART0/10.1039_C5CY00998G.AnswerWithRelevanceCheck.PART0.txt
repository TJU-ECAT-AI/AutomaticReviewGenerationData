          [1] "Propene (C3H6) is among the foundation feedstock for large volume commodities and specialty chemicals, such as cumene, acrylonitrile,propylene oxide and high-purity polypropylene, and its demand is expected to increase significantly in the near future.1 At present, its industrial production is based on non-oxidative processing of petroleum-based materials, via steam cracking, fluid-catalytic- cracking and catalytic dehydrogenation.2 As far as the catalytic dehydrogenation is concerned,commercial processes use Cr2O3/Al2O3 (18-20 Cr wt%; Catofin press) or Pt(<1 wt%),Sn (1-2 wt%)/Al2O3 (Oleflex process).3 Possible replacements with lower costs and sustainable alternatives is attracting a rising interest since many years, and the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of propane appeared among the most promising, because of the higher energy efficiency (ODH is exothermic, while dehydrogenation and cracking are endothermic processes), and process simplicity."
          [2] "A review on the catalysts for propane ODH was compiled by Cavani et al. in 2007,2 who considered the performances in ODH of propane with O2 as oxidant of almost 100 catalysts, with different active phases,reported in literature over the 2000-2006 period, and concluded that the best propylene yields resulting from propane ODH (ca. 30%) were still far from being interesting for industrial implementation, as well as the information concerning catalyst lifetime appeared quite limited."
          [3] "Moreover, in that review the set-up of catalytic materials and/or reactor configurations capable of maintaining high selectivity to propylene under conditions leading to high propane conversion was addressed as main direction for future development."
          [4] "Later on, an initial yield in C3H6 as high as ca. 47%, decreasing to ca. 33% after 8 h on stream were reported for propane dehydrogenation over GaOx based catalysts.4 More recently, the kinetics for the ODH of C3H8 on VOx catalysts was reviewed by Carrero et al., and for the systems considered the combination of reported conversions and selectivities resulted in yields in C3H6 not exceeding 30%.5 Conversely, Ovsitser et al.,reported the attainment of a yield in propene of ca. 40% for the oxidative dehydrogenation of C3H8 under O2 lean-conditions over VOx/SiO2 catalysts, even a quite long reaction time.6 Similar results were obtained by these authors for the oxydative dehydrogenation of iso-C4H10 to iso-C4H8.7 In this respect, the attainment of high selectivity to olefins via ODH of alkanes is basically limited, from a chemical point of view, by the use of O2 as oxidant, because of the occurrence of the over- oxidation to carbon oxides of both fed paraffins and produced olefins."
          [5] "On such a basis, the use of CO2 as mild oxidant has attracted attention after the successful use in other partial oxidation reactions such as dry reforming8,9 and oxidative coupling of methane.10, 11 Although ODH of propane in the presence of CO2 is an endothermic process (H298K= + 166.6 kJ/mol), the addition of a small amount of oxygen can turn the process towards an exothermic character, and additional positive effects towards the catalyst coking might be expected."

          The primary challenges in current propylene production methods, which are based on non-oxidative processing of petroleum-based materials, include high costs and sustainability issues. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by offering higher energy efficiency, as it is an exothermic process, unlike dehydrogenation and cracking which are endothermic. ODHP also presents process simplicity as an advantage. However, ODHP presents its own set of challenges, particularly in the context of oxidant selection. The use of oxygen as an oxidant can lead to over-oxidation to carbon oxides of both the fed paraffins and produced olefins, limiting the selectivity to olefins. The use of CO2 as a mild oxidant has been proposed to mitigate this issue, as it can turn the process towards an exothermic character and potentially have positive effects on catalyst coking.

          当前丙烯生产方法的主要挑战是基于非氧化处理的石油基材料的成本高和可持续性问题。丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)通过提供更高的能源效率解决了这些问题，因为它是一个放热过程，与吸热的脱氢和裂解过程不同。ODHP还提供了过程简单性的优势。然而，ODHP在氧化剂选择方面存在其自身的挑战。使用氧气作为氧化剂会导致喂入的石蜡和产生的烯烃过度氧化为碳氧化物，限制了对烯烃的选择性。已经提出使用二氧化碳作为温和的氧化剂来缓解这个问题，因为它可以使过程转向放热特性，并可能对催化剂焦化产生积极影响。
