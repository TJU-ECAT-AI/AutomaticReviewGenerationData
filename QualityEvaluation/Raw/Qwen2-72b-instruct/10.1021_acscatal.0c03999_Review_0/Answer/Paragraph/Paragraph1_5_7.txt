                    The escalating demand for propylene, coupled with the thermodynamic constraints and rapid catalyst deactivation in current production methods like steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) \[10.1016/j.cattod.2007.05.009\], has prompted the exploration of alternative methods. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP), a process that directly converts propane to propylene, offers improved energy efficiency as an exothermal reaction \[10.1016/j.cattod.2007.05.009\]. However, the use of oxygen as an oxidant in ODHP introduces challenges, including increased energy losses and fixed costs due to CO2 production \[10.1016/j.cattod.2007.05.009\]. New technologies focusing on catalyst performance and innovative designs are needed to address these issues \[10.1016/j.cattod.2007.05.009\].

                    Propylene production by traditional methods is energy-intensive, emitting greenhouse gases and producing diluting co-products \[10.1016/j.jcat.2010.06.010\]. ODHP offers a more direct, energy-efficient, and cleaner route, with oxygen boosting propylene yields but risking deep oxidation and requiring energy-intensive separation \[10.1016/j.jcat.2010.06.010\]. N2O improves propene selectivity and reduces deep oxidation risk, albeit with lower activity and higher costs \[10.1016/j.jcat.2010.06.010\]. The choice of oxidant is critical, affecting reaction pathway, product selectivity, and catalyst stability \[10.1016/j.jcat.2010.06.010\].

                    Propylene production is constrained by equilibrium limitations, which ODHP seeks to overcome \[10.1016/0021-9517(77)90228-7\]. Using SO2 as an oxidant in ODHP boosts selectivity per pass at high temperatures, offering an advantage over traditional methods \[10.1016/0021-9517(77)90228-7\]. However, SO2 increases propane conversion at the expense of lower propylene selectivity compared to pure propane feed \[10.1016/0021-9517(77)90228-7\].

                    Rising propylene demand outpaces production, necessitating efficient on-purpose methods \[10.1038/s41467-018-03793-w\]. Direct dehydrogenation of propane (DDP) is energy-intensive, requiring temperatures above 973 K for substantial yields \[10.1038/s41467-018-03793-w\]. ODHP using CO2 as a mild oxidant reduces operating temperatures by oxidizing hydrogen and releasing heat \[10.1038/s41467-018-03793-w\]. CO2 boosts propane conversion by consuming H2 and prevents over-oxidation, reducing carbon oxide production compared to molecular oxygen \[10.1038/s41467-018-03793-w\].

                    Propylene production via propane dehydrogenation encounters challenges like side reactions, thermodynamic constraints, high energy needs, and catalyst deactivation \[10.1021/jp410750c\]. ODHP, using an oxidant, addresses some issues but introduces overoxidation and reaction instability, especially with oxygen \[10.1021/jp410750c\]. Catalysts, particularly vanadium-based oxides, improve selectivity and conversion, facilitating controlled reactions in ODHP \[10.1021/jp410750c\].

                    Propylene production faces challenges due to high costs and sustainability issues with current non-oxidative methods \[10.1039/C5CY00998G\]. ODHP offers higher energy efficiency and process simplicity, addressing these challenges \[10.1039/C5CY00998G\]. However, ODHP's use of oxygen as an oxidant can lead to over-oxidation, limiting selectivity to olefins \[10.1039/C5CY00998G\]. The use of CO2 as a mild oxidant is proposed to mitigate this issue, potentially turning the process exothermic and benefiting catalyst coking \[10.1039/C5CY00998G\].

                    Current propylene production methods are energy-intensive and complex, with by-product formation \[10.1134/S0023158418060010\]. ODHP offers a more direct and energy-efficient route to propylene \[10.1134/S0023158418060010\]. However, using oxygen can lead to deep oxidation, reducing propylene selectivity and forming CO and CO2 \[10.1134/S0023158418060010\]. Oxygen's reactivity with hydrocarbons necessitates controlled conditions to prevent runaway reactions, and oxygen separation from air increases costs \[10.1134/S0023158418060010\]. Precise dosing is required to avoid over-oxidation \[10.1134/S0023158418060010\].

                    Propylene production faces a supply-demand gap due to increased low-cost ethene from shale gas \[10.1126/science.aaf7885\]. ODHP offers thermodynamic benefits and enhanced catalyst stability over non-oxidative methods \[10.1126/science.aaf7885\]. However, it must overcome the challenge of preventing propene's over-oxidation to CO and CO2 \[10.1126/science.aaf7885\].

                    Current propylene production methods are energy-intensive and have low selectivity, relying on diminishing petroleum reserves \[10.1021/acs.chemrev.6b00551\]. ODHP offers higher efficiency and selectivity but faces challenges, notably in oxidant choice \[10.1021/acs.chemrev.6b00551\]. Oxygen, while cheap and abundant, risks overoxidation and complicates temperature control, crucial for preventing product combustion \[10.1021/acs.chemrev.6b00551\]. Suitable catalysts and reactor designs are essential for ODHP's success \[10.1021/acs.chemrev.6b00551\].

                    Current propylene production methods, including cracking and dehydrogenation, face challenges like high energy consumption and coke formation \[10.1080/17415990412331327909\]. ODHP addresses these by operating at lower temperatures, reducing coke formation \[10.1080/17415990412331327909\]. Oxygen, a preferred oxidant, enhances propene selectivity but risks over-oxidation to carbon oxides, limiting yields \[10.1080/17415990412331327909\]. The use of oxygen balances high propylene yields with the risk of explosive mixtures and over-oxidation \[10.1080/17415990412331327909\]. H2S in the feedstock improves propylene selectivity by altering the reaction pathway and preventing over-oxidation \[10.1080/17415990412331327909\].

                    Current propylene production via steam cracking and fluidic catalytic cracking faces low yields and selectivity, exacerbated by the shift to ethane use, reducing propylene output \[10.1002/cctc.201200913\]. Propane dehydrogenation, while theoretically ideal for high propylene selectivity and low investment, is constrained by thermodynamics, requiring high temperatures that complicate product separation \[10.1002/cctc.201200913\]. ODHP could enhance yields but is limited by propylene's oxidation to oxygenated products, capping yields at 30% \[10.1002/cctc.201200913\]. Oxidant selection is critical: F2 is too reactive, Cl2 reactions are non-selective and potentially explosive, I2 reactions are slow and require high temperatures, and bromine, though more feasible, necessitates a high propane-to-bromine ratio to avoid polyhalogenation, limiting conversion \[10.1002/cctc.201200913\].

                    Current propylene production methods, like steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking, are energy-intensive and centralized, limiting natural gas reserve use in remote areas \[10.1002/ente.201900622\]. ODHP offers a more energy-efficient, decentralized alternative \[10.1002/ente.201900622\]. However, it faces limitations, notably in oxidant selection; oxygen can trigger side reactions, affecting propylene yield \[10.1002/ente.201900622\]. Efficient catalysts are vital for propane activation under mild conditions while preventing over-oxidation \[10.1002/ente.201900622\]. Managing the exothermic reaction to avoid overheating is critical \[10.1002/ente.201900622\]. The use of oxygen in ODHP complicates selectivity control due to propane's weaker CH and CC bonds \[10.1002/ente.201900622\].

                    Growing propene demand highlights the potential of ODHP for higher propane conversion and propene yield, with CO2 utilisation as a by-product \[10.1016/j.jcou.2019.09.018\]. However, using oxygen as an oxidant presents challenges, limiting the method's effectiveness \[10.1016/j.jcou.2019.09.018\].

                    Propylene production struggles with achieving high propane conversion and selectivity due to propylene's higher reactivity and propane cracking at temperatures over 700 degrees Celsius, leading to various by-products \[10.1016/S0926-860X(01)00816-X\]. ODHP offers improvements but faces selectivity and propane cracking challenges \[10.1016/S0926-860X(01)00816-X\]. Oxidant selection, particularly oxygen, presents safety and process issues \[10.1016/S0926-860X(01)00816-X\].

                    Current propylene production methods, like steam cracking, are energy-intensive and costly \[10.1039/c2ee22409g\]. ODHP presents a more efficient and selective process, potentially lowering costs and emissions \[10.1039/c2ee22409g\]. Using CO2 as an oxidant in ODHP enhances selectivity and avoids over-oxidation risks, unlike oxygen, which can decrease propylene yield by over-oxidizing to CO2 \[10.1039/c2ee22409g\]. The choice of oxidant is pivotal for propylene yield and selectivity in ODHP processes \[10.1039/c2ee22409g\].

                    Propylene production faces challenges including supply deficits due to high demand \[10.1021/acscatal.0c03999_0\]. Current methods like dehydrogenation have drawbacks: thermodynamic limits requiring high energy and catalyst deactivation from coke formation \[10.1021/acscatal.0c03999_0\]. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) is advantageous due to its exothermic nature, eliminating thermodynamic constraints at lower temperatures \[10.1021/acscatal.0c03999_0\]. However, using oxygen as an oxidant in ODHP can cause overoxidation to carbon oxides, leading to inefficient reactant use and low selectivity \[10.1021/acscatal.0c03999_0\].

                    Current propylene production methods face challenges including high energy consumption, low selectivity, and economic constraints \[10.1021/cr5002436\]. ODHP offers an economical propane feedstock and potentially more efficient conversion \[10.1021/cr5002436\]. However, selecting an oxidant is critical: oxygen can lower reaction temperatures and make the process exothermic, but risks overoxidation; CO2 is safer but lacks sufficient heat and can cause additional coke deposition and competitive adsorption on catalyst surfaces, impacting performance \[10.1021/cr5002436\].

                    Traditional propylene production methods, like fluid catalytic cracking and steam cracking, face challenges including high temperatures, costly catalysts, and catalyst deactivation due to coke formation \[10.1039/D0CY00586J\]. Propane oxidative dehydrogenation (ODHP) offers a solution by potentially lowering reaction temperatures due
