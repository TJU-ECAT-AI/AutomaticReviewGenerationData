                    The current landscape of propylene production is marked by significant challenges, particularly in meeting the growing demand while addressing environmental concerns and energy efficiency. Traditional methods, such as steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking (FCC), are energy-intensive and often result in low selectivity and yields, especially in Western Europe where ethylene production is favored \[10.1016/j.cattod.2007.05.009\]. Dehydrogenation processes, although theoretically ideal, are limited by thermodynamics and coking issues, leading to catalyst deactivation \[10.1016/j.cattod.2007.05.009\]. In this context, oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) emerges as a promising alternative, offering an exothermal, direct route to propylene production that improves energy efficiency over endothermal dehydrogenation \[10.1016/j.cattod.2007.05.009\]. However, the use of oxygen in ODHP increases energy losses and fixed costs due to CO2 production \[10.1016/j.cattod.2007.05.009\].

                    ODHP presents a cleaner, more efficient alternative to traditional methods, with oxygen as an oxidant boosting yields but risking deep oxidation and requiring energy-intensive separation \[10.1016/j.jcat.2010.06.010\]. Nitrous oxide (N2O), while potentially more costly, improves propene selectivity and reduces catalyst deactivation \[10.1016/j.jcat.2010.06.010\]. The choice of oxidant is critical, influencing reaction pathway, product selectivity, and catalyst stability \[10.1016/j.jcat.2010.06.010\]. Using SO2 as an oxidant in ODHP boosts selectivity at high temperatures but sacrifices propylene selectivity compared to pure propane feed \[10.1016/0021-9517(77)90228-7\].

                    ODHP using CO2 as a mild oxidant reduces operating temperatures, boosts propane conversion by consuming H2, and curbs carbon oxide production compared to molecular oxygen \[10.1038/s41467-018-03793-w\]. This process, unlike molecular oxygen, prevents over-oxidation and minimizes carbon oxides production \[10.1038/s41467-018-03793.w\]. Propylene production via propane dehydrogenation faces challenges including side reactions, thermodynamic constraints, high energy demands, and catalytic deactivation due to coke formation \[10.1021/jp410750c\]. ODHP, using an oxidant to initiate reactions, aims to overcome these issues \[10.1021/jp410750c\]. However, oxygen as an oxidant risks overoxidation to CO and CO2 and reaction instability \[10.1021/jp410750c\]. Catalysts, notably vanadium-based and mixed-metal oxides, enhance ODHP activity and selectivity \[10.1021/jp410750c\].

                    Propylene production, traditionally using costly and unsustainable non-oxidative processing of petroleum, faces significant challenges. ODHP offers higher energy efficiency and process simplicity, addressing these issues. However, ODHP's use of oxygen as an oxidant can lead to over-oxidation, limiting selectivity to olefins. The use of CO2 as a mild oxidant is proposed to mitigate this issue, potentially turning the process exothermic and reducing catalyst coking \[10.1039/C5CY00998G\].

                    Propylene production via steam cracking is energy-intensive and complex. ODHP offers a more efficient route but faces limitations, notably in oxidant selection. Oxygen, while effective, can lead to CO and CO2 formation, reducing propylene selectivity, and poses safety risks due to its reactivity with hydrocarbons, adding to costs and requiring precise dosing to prevent over-oxidation \[10.1134/S0023158418060010\].

                    Increased low-cost ethene from shale gas widens the propylene supply-demand gap, necessitating on-purpose technologies. ODHP offers thermodynamic advantages and enhanced catalyst stability, but must overcome the challenge of avoiding propene's over-oxidation to CO and CO2 \[10.1126/science.aaf7885\].

                    Current propylene production methods are energy-intensive, lack selectivity, and depend on depleting oil reserves. ODHP offers a more efficient and selective alternative. However, it faces limitations, especially in oxidant selection. Oxygen, while cost-effective, risks overoxidation to carbon oxides and creates temperature control issues, threatening product quality. Suitable catalysts and reactor designs are critical for ODHP's success \[10.1021/acs.chemrev.6b00551\].

                    Current propylene production faces challenges including high energy consumption, coke formation, and high operational temperatures. ODHP addresses these by operating at lower temperatures and minimizing coke. Oxygen, a preferred oxidant, enhances propene selectivity but risks over-oxidation, reducing yields. Careful control is vital to prevent explosive mixtures and manage exothermic reactions. H2S in the feedstock boosts propylene selectivity by altering the reaction pathway and curbing over-oxidation \[10.1080/17415990412331327909\].

                    Current propylene production methods are energy-intensive and centralized, limiting the use of remote gas reserves. ODHP offers a more energy-efficient and decentralized alternative but faces challenges, notably in oxidant selection. Oxygen can cause side reactions, affecting propylene yield. Efficient catalysts are essential for activating propane under mild conditions, suppressing over-oxidation, and managing the exothermic nature of the reaction to prevent overheating and ensure safety \[10.1002/ente.201900622\].

                    Growing propene demand highlights the need for improved production methods, making ODHP attractive due to higher propane conversion and propene yield. However, using oxygen as an oxidant in ODHP presents unique challenges, underscoring the need for careful oxidant selection \[10.1016/j.jcou.2019.09.018\].

                    Propylene production struggles with achieving high propane conversion and selectivity due to propylene's higher oxidation susceptibility and propane cracking at temperatures above 700 degrees Celsius. ODHP aims to address these issues but faces challenges in maintaining selectivity and managing propane cracking. Oxygen selection in ODHP raises safety and process issues. Achieving high conversion and selectivity in propane oxydehydrogenation remains elusive, impacting its commercialization potential \[10.1016/S0926-860X(01)00816-X\].

                    Propylene production via steam cracking is energy-intensive, costly, and environmentally problematic. ODHP offers a more efficient and economical solution, with CO2 as an oxidant further reducing costs and emissions. However, using oxygen can lead to over-oxidation, decreasing propylene selectivity, underscoring the critical role of oxidant choice in ODHP's success \[10.1039/c2ee22409g\].

                    Propylene, a critical petrochemical feedstock, faces a supply deficit due to high demand. Current production methods, including steam cracking, fluid catalytic cracking, and direct dehydrogenation of propane, are constrained by thermodynamic limits and catalyst deactivation. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP), an exothermic process, overcomes these constraints at lower temperatures, making it an attractive alternative. However, using oxygen as an oxidant in ODHP can lead to overoxidation, resulting in carbon oxides and low process selectivity \[10.1021/acscatal.0c03999_0\].

                    Current propylene production methods face high energy demands, low selectivity, and rising costs. ODHP, using propane, offers a more economical solution with efficient conversion. However, it struggles with oxidant selection. Oxygen, while lowering reaction temperatures and making the process exothermic, risks over-oxidation and affects olefin selectivity. CO2, as a milder oxidant, can enhance catalyst activity without over-oxidation risks but may not provide enough heat and can lead to additional coke deposition and competitive adsorption, impacting performance \[10.1021/cr5002436\].

                    Propylene production faces challenges including high temperatures, costly catalysts, and catalyst deactivation. ODHP potentially mitigates these by lowering temperatures due to its exothermic nature, but selectivity issues arise from overoxidation risks. Using CO2 as an oxidant in ODHP avoids deep oxidation, reduces coke formation, and enhances propane conversion, offering advantages over oxygen \[10.1039/D0CY00586J\].

                    Current propylene production methods, including steam cracking, FCC, and DH, face challenges like endothermic reactions, coke formation, and thermodynamic constraints. ODHP offers a solution by enabling lower reaction temperatures and reducing coke formation. However, it has a low propylene selectivity due to total oxidation at high conversion rates, highlighting the need for a selective catalyst \[10.1016/j.jcat.2015.12.015\].

                    Conventional propylene production via catalytic and steam cracking is limited by low yields and thermodynamic constraints, prompting interest in propane dehydrogenation (PDH). Direct dehydrogenation is endothermic and limited by equilibrium, requiring high temperatures that promote side reactions and coke formation. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) is exothermic and not thermodynamically limited but struggles with propylene selectivity due to over-oxidation. Carbon dioxide (CO2) as a soft oxidant in PDH is advantageous for utilizing CO2, removing coke, and promoting hydrogen consumption in the reverse water-gas shift reaction or direct propane oxidation. However, PDH with CO2 faces challenges like catalyst deactivation from coke and chromium reduction \[10.1080/00986445.2015.1017638\].

                    Propylene production via steam cracking faces challenges like high energy use, catalyst regeneration, and thermodynamic limits. ODHP offers lower energy consumption, no catalyst regeneration, and overcomes thermodynamic constraints. However, O2 in ODHP can cause flammability and poor selectivity. Using CO2 as a safer oxidant mitigates these issues, making it a preferred choice \[10.1007/s10562-017-2282-3\].

                    Propylene production faces challenges due to ethylene preference and dehydrogenation's thermodynamic limits and coking. ODHP offers an exothermal, energy-efficient alternative to endothermal methods. However, using oxygen increases energy losses and costs due to CO2 production. Catalyst performance and innovative process designs are crucial for ODHP's commercial success \[10.1016/j.cattod.2007.05.009\].

                    Current propylene production methods are energy-intensive, emit pollutants, and produce diluting co-products. ODHP presents a cleaner, more efficient alternative, with oxygen enhancing yields but risking deep oxidation and demanding energy for separation. N2O boosts propene selectivity and mitigates deep oxidation, though it may reduce activity and has higher costs. The choice of oxidant significantly affects product selectivity and catalyst stability \[10.1016/j.jcat.2010.06.010\].

                    Propylene production is constrained by equilibrium limitations, which ODHP seeks to overcome. Using SO2 as an oxidant in ODHP enhances selectivity per pass at high temperatures, an advantage over conventional methods. However, adding SO2 increases propane conversion but decreases propylene selectivities compared to pure propane feed, illustrating a trade-off \[10.1016/0021-9517(77)90228-7\].

                    Rising propylene demand outpaces production, necessitating efficient methods. Direct dehydrogenation of propane (DDP) is energy-intensive, requiring high temperatures for significant yields. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) with CO2 as a mild oxidant reduces operating temperatures and increases propane conversion through the reverse water gas shift reaction, unlike molecular oxygen, which promotes over-oxidation and carbon oxides production \[10.1038/s41467-018-03793.w\].

                    Propylene production from propane dehydrogenation is hindered by side reactions, thermodynamic limits, high energy demands, and catalytic deactivation due to coke formation. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP), using an oxidant to initiate the reaction, aims to address these issues. However, oxygen as an oxidant risks overoxidation and reaction runaway. Catalysts, notably vanadium-based and mixed-metal oxides, are explored to suppress complete oxidation, ensuring selectivity and conversion in ODHP reactions \[10.1021/jp410750c\].

                    Propylene production via non-oxidative processing of petroleum is costly and unsustainable. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) offers higher energy efficiency and process simplicity. However, using oxygen as an oxidant in ODHP can lead to over-oxidation, limiting selectivity to olefins. The use of CO2 as a mild oxidant could mitigate this issue, potentially making the process exothermic and improving catalyst coking, as seen in other partial oxidation reactions \[10.1039/C5CY00998G\].

                    Propylene production via steam cracking is energy-intensive and complex. ODHP offers an energy-efficient alternative, but using oxygen can lead to deep oxidation, reducing propylene selectivity and posing safety risks. Oxygen separation from air adds to costs, and precise dosing is crucial to prevent over-oxidation \[10.1134/S0023158418060010\].

                    Propylene production's supply-demand gap, exacerbated by shale gas, drives interest in on-purpose technologies. ODHP, offering thermodynamic advantages and enhanced catalyst stability, competes with non-oxidative methods but faces the challenge of preventing propene's over-oxidation \[10.1126/science.aaf7885\].
