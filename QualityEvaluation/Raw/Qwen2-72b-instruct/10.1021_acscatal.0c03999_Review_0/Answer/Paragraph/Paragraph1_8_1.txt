                    The current landscape of propylene production is dominated by energy-intensive methods like steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking (FCC), which struggle to meet the growing demand, especially in Western Europe, where ethylene production is favored \[10.1016/j.cattod.2007.05.009\]. These methods are constrained by thermodynamics and coking, leading to catalyst deactivation. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) presents an exothermal, direct route to propylene, improving energy efficiency over endothermal dehydrogenation \[10.1016/j.cattod.2007.05.009\]. However, using oxygen in ODHP increases energy losses and fixed costs due to CO2 production \[10.1016/j.cattod.2007.05.009\]. Catalyst performance and innovative process designs are crucial for ODHP's commercial success \[10.1016/j.cattod.2007.05.009\].

                    Current propylene production methods are energy-intensive and environmentally impactful \[10.1016/j.jcat.2010.06.010\]. ODHP offers a cleaner, more efficient alternative, with oxygen as an oxidant boosting yields but risking deep oxidation and requiring energy-intensive separation \[10.1016/j.jcat.2010.06.010\]. N2O, while potentially more costly, improves propene selectivity and reduces catalyst deactivation \[10.1016/j.jcat.2010.06.010\]. The oxidant choice is critical, influencing reaction pathway, product selectivity, and catalyst stability \[10.1016/j.jcat.2010.06.010\].

                    Current propylene production faces equilibrium constraints, which ODHP aims to overcome \[10.1016/0021-9517(77)90228-7\]. Using SO2 as an oxidant in ODHP boosts selectivity at high temperatures and increases propane conversion, illustrating its potential \[10.1016/0021-9517(77)90228-7\]. However, this results in lower propylene selectivities compared to pure propane feed, highlighting ODHP's limitations \[10.1016/0021-9517(77)90228-7\].

                    Propylene demand outpaces production, driving the need for efficient methods \[10.1038/s41467-018-03793-w\]. Direct dehydrogenation of propane (DDP) is limited by high-temperature requirements. ODHP, using CO2 as a mild oxidant, reduces operating temperatures, boosts propane conversion by consuming H2, and curbs carbon oxide production compared to molecular oxygen \[10.1038/s41467-018-03793-w\].

                    Propylene production via propane dehydrogenation encounters issues like side reactions, thermodynamic constraints, high energy demands, and catalytic deactivation \[10.1021/jp410750c\]. ODHP, using an oxidant, aims to mitigate these by offering an exothermic process with reduced coke formation. However, oxygen use risks overoxidation to CO and CO2 \[10.1021/jp410750c\]. Catalysts, notably vanadium-based and mixed-metal oxides, enhance selectivity and conversion while suppressing complete oxidation \[10.1021/jp410750c\].

                    Propylene production, traditionally using costly and unsustainable petroleum-based methods, faces challenges \[10.1039/C5CY00998G\]. ODHP offers higher energy efficiency and simpler processes, addressing these issues. However, using oxygen as an oxidant in ODHP can lead to over-oxidation, limiting selectivity to olefins \[10.1039/C5CY00998G\]. Recent studies propose using CO2 as a mild oxidant to mitigate this limitation, potentially turning the process exothermic and benefiting catalyst coking \[10.1039/C5CY00998G\].

                    Propylene production methods, like steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking, are energy-intensive and produce by-products \[10.1126/science.aaf7885\].

However, using oxygen as an oxidant in ODHP can lead to deep oxidation, reducing selectivity to propylene and posing safety risks due to its reactivity with hydrocarbons \[10.1126/science.aaf7885\].

                    Propylene production's supply-demand gap highlights the need for on-purpose technologies \[10.1126/science.aaf7885\]. ODHP, offering thermodynamic benefits and enhanced catalyst stability, addresses this need. However, it must overcome the challenge of preventing propene's over-oxidation to CO and CO2, a key scientific hurdle \[10.1126/science.aaf7885\].

                    Current propylene production methods face challenges like high energy use, low selectivity, and dependency on dwindling oil \[10.1021/acs.chemrev.6b00551\]. ODHP, using propane, offers a more efficient conversion but faces limitations, notably in oxidant selection. Oxygen, while lowering reaction temperatures and making dehydrogenation exothermic, risks over-oxidation and side reactions, impacting olefin selectivity \[10.1021/acs.chemrev.6b00551\]. CO2, as a milder oxidant, enhances catalyst activity without over-oxidation risks but provides insufficient heat and can lead to additional coke deposition and competitive adsorption, affecting performance \[10.1021/acs.chemrev.6b00551\].

                    Propylene production faces challenges including high temperatures, costly catalysts, and catalyst deactivation \[10.1039/D0CY00586J\]. ODHP reduces reaction temperatures but struggles with propylene selectivity. Using CO2 as an oxidant in ODHP avoids deep oxidation, reduces coke formation, and enhances propane conversion, offering an advantage over oxygen \[10.1039/D0CY00586J\].

                    Propylene production via steam cracking confronts high energy consumption, costs, and reduced yields \[10.1039/c2ee22409g\].

However, using oxygen risks over-oxidation, impacting propylene selectivity. The choice of oxidant is pivotal for yield and selectivity in ODHP \[10.1039/c2ee22409g\].

                    Propylene production struggles with achieving high propane conversion and selectivity due to propylene's higher oxidation susceptibility, leading to declining selectivity with increased conversion \[10.1016/S0926-860X(01)00816-X\]. At temperatures above 700 degrees Celsius, propane cracking increases, producing undesired by-products. ODHP, while offering potential improvements, faces challenges in maintaining selectivity and managing propane cracking, with oxidant selection adding safety concerns \[10.1016/S0926-860X(01)00816-X\].

                    Propylene production, a vital petrochemical feedstock, faces a supply deficit due to high demand \[10.1021/acscatal.0c03999_0\]. Current production methods, including dehydrogenation, are limited by thermodynamic constraints and catalyst deactivation. ODHP, an exothermic process, overcomes these issues by operating at lower temperatures. However, using oxygen as an oxidant in ODHP can cause overoxidation to carbon oxides, leading to inefficient reactant use and low selectivity \[10.1021/acscatal.0c03999_0\].

                    Current propylene production methods, like steam cracking and FCC, face challenges such as high energy consumption, low selectivity, and reliance on dwindling oil reserves \[10.1021/cr5002436\]. ODHP offers a cost-effective feedstock and potentially efficient conversion, but selecting the right oxidant is crucial. Oxygen can lower reaction temperatures and make dehydrogenation exothermic, but risks overoxidation and side reactions, impacting olefin selectivity \[10.1021/cr5002436\]. CO2, while not providing enough heat, effectively consumes hydrogen but may lead to additional coke deposition and negatively affect catalyst performance through competitive adsorption on basic sites \[10.1021/cr5002436\].

                    Propylene production faces challenges including high temperatures, costly catalysts, and catalyst deactivation \[10.1016/j.jcat.2015.12.015\]. ODHP could mitigate temperature requirements but risks overoxidation, impacting propylene selectivity. Oxygen as an oxidant can lead to deep oxidation, while CO2 offers benefits in avoiding overoxidation and reducing coke formation \[10.1016/j.jcat.2015.12.015\].

                    Propylene demand exceeds conventional production capacities, spotlighting propane dehydrogenation (PDH) \[10.1080/00986445.2015.1017638\]. Direct dehydrogenation faces low yields and equilibrium constraints, necessitating high temperatures that spur side reactions and coke formation. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) is exothermic but struggles with selectivity due to over-oxidation. Carbon dioxide (CO2), a soft oxidant, emerges as a viable PDH alternative, facilitating coke removal and PDH equilibrium shift \[10.1080/00986445.2015.1017638\].

                    Propylene production via steam cracking faces challenges like high energy use, catalyst regeneration, and thermodynamic limits \[10.1007/s10562-017-2282-3\]. ODHP offers lower energy consumption, no catalyst regeneration, and overcomes thermodynamic constraints. However, oxygen in ODHP can cause flammability and poor selectivity. Using CO2 as a safer, milder oxidant mitigates these issues, enhancing ODHP's potential \[10.1007/s10562-017-2282-3\].

                    Propylene production faces challenges due to ethylene preference and dehydrogenation's thermodynamic limits and coking \[10.1016/j.cattod.2007.05.009\]. ODHP offers an exothermal, energy-efficient alternative to endothermal methods. However, using oxygen increases energy losses and costs due to CO2 production. Catalyst performance and innovative process designs are crucial for ODHP's commercial success \[10.1016/j.cattod.2007.05.009\].

                    Current propylene production methods are energy-intensive, emit pollutants, and produce diluting co-products \[10.1016/j.jcat.2010.06.010\]. ODHP presents a cleaner, more efficient alternative, with oxygen enhancing yields but risking deep oxidation and demanding energy for separation \[10.1016/j.jcat.2010.06.010\]. N2O boosts propene selectivity and mitigates deep oxidation, though it may reduce activity and has higher costs \[10.1016/j.jcat.2010.06.010\]. The choice of oxidant significantly affects product selectivity and catalyst stability \[10.1016/j.jcat.2010.06.010\].

                    Propylene production is constrained by equilibrium limitations, which ODHP seeks to overcome \[10.1016/0021-9517(77)90228-7\]. Using SO2 as an oxidant in ODHP enhances selectivity per pass at high temperatures, an advantage over conventional methods \[10.1016/0021-9517(77)90228-7\]. However, adding SO2 increases propane conversion but decreases propylene selectivities compared to pure propane feed, illustrating a trade-off \[10.1016/0021-9517(77)90228-7\].

                    Rising propylene demand outpaces production, necessitating efficient methods \[10.1038/s41467-018-03793-w\]. Direct dehydrogenation of propane (DDP) is energy-intensive, requiring high temperatures for significant yields. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) with CO2 as a mild oxidant reduces operating temperatures and increases propane conversion through the reverse water gas shift reaction, unlike molecular oxygen, which promotes over-oxidation and carbon oxides production \[10.1038/s41467-018-03793-w\].

                    Propylene production from propane dehydrogenation is hindered by side reactions, thermodynamic limits, high energy demands, and catalytic deactivation due to coke formation \[10.1021/jp410750c\]. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP), using an oxidant to initiate the reaction, aims to address these issues \[10.1021/jp410750c\]. However, oxygen as an oxidant poses risks of overoxidation to CO and CO2 and reaction instability \[10.1021/jp410750c\]. Catalysts, notably vanadium-based and mixed-metal oxides, are being studied for their ability to promote ODHP activity and selectivity, though they have yet to match the yields of current industrial methods \[10.1021/jp410
