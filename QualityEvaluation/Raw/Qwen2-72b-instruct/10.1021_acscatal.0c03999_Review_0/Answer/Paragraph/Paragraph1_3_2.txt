                    The escalating demand for propylene has exposed the limitations of traditional production methods, such as steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) [\[10.1016/j.cattod.2007.05.009\]]. These processes are energy-intensive and often favor the production of ethylene over propylene, leading to a supply-demand gap [\[10.1016/j.cattod.2007.05.009\]]. Dehydrogenation methods, while theoretically advantageous, are hindered by thermodynamic constraints and coking issues, which limit efficiency [\[10.1016/j.cattod.2007.05.009\]]. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP), as an alternative, offers a more exothermal and energy-efficient process, aligning better with market needs [\[10.1016/j.cattod.2007.05.009\]]. However, the use of oxygen in ODHP increases energy losses and fixed costs due to CO2 production [\[10.1016/j.cattod.2007.05.009\]]. Despite this, ODHP presents a promising alternative for propylene production, offering improved energy efficiency and process simplicity [\[10.1016/j.cattod.2007.05.009\]].

                    Current propylene production methods, including steam cracking, are energy-intensive and emit greenhouse gases [\[10.1016/j.jcat.2010.06.010\]]. ODHP offers a more direct and potentially cleaner route, with oxygen boosting propylene yields but risking deep oxidation to CO2 [\[10.1016/j.jcat.2010.06.010\]]. N2O as an oxidant enhances propene selectivity but is less active and more costly [\[10.1016/j.jcat.2010.06.010\]]. The oxidant choice is pivotal, impacting reaction pathway, product selectivity, and catalyst stability [\[10.1016/j.jcat.2010.06.010\]].

                    Propylene production faces equilibrium limitations in dehydrogenation [\[10.1016/0021-9517(77)90228-7\]]. ODHP, using SO2 as an oxidant, enhances selectivity and propane conversion at high temperatures [\[10.1016/0021-9517(77)90228-7\]]. However, SO2 increases propane conversion at the expense of reduced propylene selectivity compared to pure propane feed [\[10.1016/0021-9517(77)90228-7\]].

                    Rising propylene demand outpaces current production [\[10.1038/s41467-018-03793-w\]]. Direct dehydrogenation of propane (DDP) is limited by high temperatures for significant yields [\[10.1038/s41467-018-03793-w\]]. ODHP using CO2 as a mild oxidant reduces operating temperatures by oxidizing hydrogen from propane and releasing heat [\[10.1038/s41467-018-03793-w\]]. This method also boosts propane conversion by consuming H2 through the reverse water gas shift reaction [\[10.1038/s41467-018-03793-w\]].

                    Propylene production from propane dehydrogenation faces issues like side reactions, thermodynamic limits, high energy needs, and catalyst deactivation [\[10.1021/jp410750c\]]. ODHP, using an oxidant to initiate reactions, aims to mitigate these issues [\[10.1021/jp410750c\]]. However, oxygen as an oxidant poses risks of overoxidation and reaction instability [\[10.1021/jp410750c\]]. Catalysts, notably vanadium-based and mixed-metal oxides, improve selectivity and conversion while curbing overoxidation [\[10.1021/jp410750c\]].

                    Propylene production, traditionally using non-oxidative processing of petroleum, faces sustainability and cost challenges [\[10.1039/C5CY00998G\]]. ODHP offers higher energy efficiency and process simplicity, addressing these issues [\[10.1039/C5CY00998G\]]. However, ODHP's use of oxygen as an oxidant can lead to over-oxidation, limiting selectivity to olefins [\[10.1039/C5CY00998G\]]. Recent studies suggest using CO2 as a mild oxidant could mitigate this issue [\[10.1039/C5CY00998G\]].

                    Current propylene production methods are energy-intensive and complex [\[10.1134/S0023158418060010\]]. ODHP offers a more efficient alternative but faces challenges, notably in oxidant selection [\[10.1134/S0023158418060010\]]. Oxygen, though effective, risks deep oxidation, reducing propylene selectivity and posing safety hazards due to its reactivity [\[10.1134/S0023158418060010\]].

                    Propylene production faces a supply-demand gap due to shale gas increasing low-cost ethene [\[10.1126/science.aaf7885\]]. ODHP offers an alternative, leveraging exothermic reactions at lower temperatures and enhanced catalyst stability [\[10.1126/science.aaf7885\]].

                    Current propylene production methods are energy-intensive and complex [\[10.1021/acs.chemrev.6b00551\]]. ODHP offers a more efficient route but faces limitations, notably in oxidant selection [\[10.1021/acs.chemrev.6b00551\]]. Oxygen, while effective, risks overoxidation and temperature control issues, impacting catalysts [\[10.1021/acs.chemrev.6b00551\]].

                    Current propylene production methods are energy-intensive and prone to coke formation [\[10.1080/17415990412331327909\]]. ODHP operates at lower temperatures, reducing coke formation [\[10.1080/17415990412331327909\]]. Oxygen, a preferred ODHP oxidant, boosts propene selectivity but risks over-oxidation to carbon oxides, limiting alkene selectivities [\[10.1080/17415990412331327909\]].

                    Current propylene production via steam cracking and fluidic catalytic cracking faces low selectivity and yields [\[10.1002/cctc.201200913\]]. Propane dehydrogenation, while theoretically advantageous, is thermodynamically limited, requiring high temperatures that complicate product separation [\[10.1002/cctc.201200913\]]. ODHP can enhance propylene yields but is capped at around 30% due to propylene's oxidation to oxygenated products [\[10.1002/cctc.201200913\]].

                    Current propylene production methods are energy-intensive and centralized [\[10.1002/ente.201900622\]]. ODHP offers a decentralized, potentially more energy-efficient alternative [\[10.1002/ente.201900622\]]. However, using oxygen as an oxidant in ODHP can lead to side reactions, affecting propylene yield and selectivity [\[10.1002/ente.201900622\]].

                    Growing propene demand strains current production methods [\[10.1016/j.jcou.2019.09.018\]]. ODHP offers higher propane conversion and propene yield [\[10.1016/j.jcou.2019.09.018\]]. However, using oxygen as an oxidant in ODHP presents specific challenges [\[10.1016/j.jcou.2019.09.018\]].

                    Propylene production struggles with achieving high propane conversion and selectivity [\[10.1016/S0926-860X(01)00816-X\]]. ODHP aims to address these issues but faces challenges in maintaining selectivity and avoiding propane cracking [\[10.1016/S0926-860X(01)00816-X\]]. Oxygen selection as an oxidant raises safety concerns [\[10.1016/S0926-860X(01)00816-X\]].

                    Propylene production via steam cracking is costly and energy-intensive [\[10.1039/c2ee22409g\]]. ODHP presents a more efficient and cost-effective solution [\[10.1039/c2ee22409g\]]. Using CO2 as an oxidant in ODHP further reduces costs and emissions [\[10.1039/c2ee22409g\]]. However, using oxygen risks over-oxidation, decreasing propylene selectivity [\[10.1039/c2ee22409g\]].

                    Propylene production faces challenges including supply deficits due to high demand [\[10.1021/acscatal.0c03999_0\]]. ODHP is advantageous due to its exothermic nature, eliminating thermodynamic constraints at lower temperatures [\[10.1021/acscatal.0c03999_0\]]. However, using oxygen as an oxidant in ODHP can cause overoxidation to carbon oxides, leading to inefficient reactant use and low process selectivity [\[10.1021/acscatal.0c03999_0\]].

                    Current propylene production methods are energy-intensive and have low selectivity [\[10.1021/cr5002436\]]. ODHP presents an economical feedstock and potentially efficient conversion [\[10.1021/cr5002436\]]. However, it encounters limitations, notably in oxidant selection [\[10.1021/cr5002436\]]. Oxygen, while lowering reaction temperatures and making the process exothermic, risks over-oxidation and side reactions [\[10.1021/cr5002436\]]. CO2, as a milder oxidant, boosts catalyst activity without over-oxidation risks [\[10.1021/cr5002436\]].

                    Propylene production faces challenges including high temperatures and costly catalysts [\[10.1039/D0CY00586J\]]. ODHP could reduce temperatures but struggles with propylene selectivity [\[10.1039/D0CY00586J\]]. Using CO2 as an oxidant in ODHP mitigates deep oxidation, reduces coke formation, and enhances propane conversion [\[10.1039/D0CY00586J\]].

                    Propylene production faces challenges like endothermic reactions, coke formation, and thermodynamic constraints [\[10.1016/j.jcat.2015.12.015\]]. ODHP offers lower reaction temperatures and reduced coke formation [\[10.1016/j.jcat.2015.12.015\]]. However, it has low propylene selectivity due to total oxidation at high conversion rates [\[10.1016/j.jcat.2015.12.015\]].

                    Conventional propylene production methods, like catalytic and steam cracking, struggle to meet demand due to low yields and equilibrium limitations [\[10.1080/00986445.2015.1017638\]]. ODHP is an exothermic process not limited by thermodynamics [\[10.1080/00986445.2015.1017638\]]. However, it faces selectivity issues due to over-oxidation [\[10.1080/00986445.2015.1017638\]]. Carbon dioxide (CO2), a soft oxidant, aids in coke removal and shifts the equilibrium, promoting propane dehydrogenation (PDH) [\[10.1080/00986445.2015.1017638\]].

                    Propylene production's challenges include high energy consumption, catalyst regeneration, and thermodynamic constraints [\[10.1007/s10562-017-2282-3\]]. ODHP offers lower energy use, eliminates catalyst regeneration, and overcomes thermodynamic limits [\[10.1007/s10562-017-2282-3\]]. Oxygen in ODHP can cause flammability and poor selectivity due to over-oxidation [\[10.1007/s10562-017-2282-3\]]. Using CO2 as a soft oxidant provides a safer, milder alternative [\[10.1007/s10562-017-2282-3\]].

                    Propylene production via steam cracking and FCC faces growing demand and thermodynamic constraints [\[10.1016/j.cattod.2007.05.009\]]. ODHP offers a direct, exothermal route to propylene, improving energy efficiency [\[10.1016/j.cattod.2007.05.009\]]. However, using oxygen increases energy losses and costs due to CO2 production [\[10.1016/j.cattod.2007.05.009\]]. Catalyst performance and innovative process designs are vital for ODHP's commercial viability [\[10.1016/j.cattod.2007.05.009\]].
