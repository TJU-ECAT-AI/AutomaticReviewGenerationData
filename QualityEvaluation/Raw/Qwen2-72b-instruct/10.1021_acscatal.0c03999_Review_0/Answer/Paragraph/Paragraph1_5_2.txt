                    Propylene production via traditional methods, such as steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking (FCC), faces growing demand and thermodynamic constraints, leading to rapid catalyst deactivation \[10.1016/j.cattod.2007.05.009\]. ODHP directly produces propylene from propane, offering improved energy efficiency as an exothermal process, contrasting with the endothermal nature of dehydrogenation and cracking \[10.1016/j.cattod.2007.05.009\]. However, using oxygen in ODHP increases energy losses and fixed costs due to CO2 production \[10.1016/j.cattod.2007.05.009\]. New technologies focusing on catalyst performance and innovative designs are needed to address these issues, aiming to achieve yields comparable to current olefin production methods \[10.1016/j.cattod.2007.05.009\].

                    Propylene production by steam cracking and FCC is energy-intensive, emits greenhouse gases, and produces diluting co-products \[10.1016/j.jcat.2010.06.010\]. ODHP offers a more direct, energy-efficient, and cleaner route \[10.1016/j.jcat.2010.06.010\]. Oxygen boosts propylene yields but risks deep oxidation and requires energy-intensive separation \[10.1016/j.jcat.2010.06.010\]. N2O improves propene selectivity and reduces deep oxidation risk, albeit with lower activity and higher costs \[10.1016/j.jcat.2010.06.010\]. Oxidant choice is critical, affecting reaction pathway, product selectivity, and catalyst stability \[10.1016/j.jcat.2010.06.010\].

                    Propylene production is constrained by equilibrium limitations, which ODHP seeks to overcome \[10.1016/0021-9517(77)90228-7\]. Using SO2 as an oxidant in ODHP boosts selectivity per pass at high temperatures, offering an advantage over traditional methods \[10.1016/0021-9517(77)90228-7\]. However, SO2 increases propane conversion at the expense of lower propylene selectivity compared to pure propane feed, illustrating a key limitation \[10.1016/0021-9517(77)90228-7\].

                    Rising propylene demand outpaces production, necessitating efficient on-purpose methods \[10.1038/s41467-018-03793-w\]. DDP's thermal constraints require high temperatures for significant yields \[10.1038/s41467-018-03793-w\]. ODHP, using CO2 as a mild oxidant, lowers operating temperatures by oxidizing hydrogen and releasing heat \[10.1038/s41467-018-03793-w\]. CO2 boosts propane conversion by consuming H2 and prevents over-oxidation, reducing carbon oxide production compared to molecular oxygen \[10.1038/s41467-018-03793-w\].

                    Propylene production via propane dehydrogenation encounters challenges like side reactions, thermodynamic constraints, high energy needs, and catalyst deactivation \[10.1021/jp410750c\]. ODHP, using an oxidant, addresses some issues but introduces overoxidation and reaction instability, especially with oxygen \[10.1021/jp410750c\]. Catalysts, particularly vanadium-based oxides, improve selectivity and conversion, facilitating controlled reactions in ODHP \[10.1021/jp410750c\].

                    Propylene production faces challenges due to high costs and sustainability issues with current non-oxidative methods \[10.1039/C5CY00998G\]. ODHP offers higher energy efficiency and process simplicity, addressing these challenges \[10.1039/C5CY00998G\]. However, ODHP's use of oxygen as an oxidant can lead to over-oxidation, limiting selectivity to olefins \[10.1039/C5CY00998G\]. The use of CO2 as a mild oxidant is proposed to mitigate this issue, potentially turning the process exothermic and benefiting catalyst coking \[10.1039/C5CY00998G\].

                    Current propylene production methods are energy-intensive and complex, with by-product formation \[10.1134/S0023158418060010\]. ODHP offers a more direct and energy-efficient route to propylene \[10.1134/S0023158418060010\]. However, ODHP's limitations, especially with oxidant selection, are significant \[10.1134/S0023158418060010\]. Using oxygen can lead to deep oxidation, reducing propylene selectivity and forming CO and CO2 \[10.1134/S0023158418060010\]. Oxygen's reactivity with hydrocarbons necessitates controlled conditions to prevent runaway reactions, and oxygen separation from air increases costs \[10.1134/S0023158418060010\]. Precise dosing is required to avoid over-oxidation \[10.1134/S0023158418060010\].

                    Propylene production faces a supply-demand gap due to shale gas's low-cost ethene \[10.1126/science.aaf7885\]. ODHP offers thermodynamic benefits and enhanced catalyst stability over non-oxidative methods \[10.1126/science.aaf7885\]. However, it must overcome the challenge of preventing propene's over-oxidation to CO and CO2 \[10.1126/science.aaf7885\].

                    Current propylene production methods are energy-intensive, lack selectivity, and depend on depleting oil reserves \[10.1021/acs.chemrev.6b00551\]. ODHP offers a more efficient and selective alternative \[10.1021/acs.chemrev.6b00551\]. However, it faces limitations in oxidant selection, notably oxygen, which can lead to overoxidation and catalyst deactivation \[10.1021/acs.chemrev.6b00551\]. Suitable catalysts and reactor designs are crucial for ODHP's success \[10.1021/acs.chemrev.6b00551\].

                    Current propylene production methods, including cracking and dehydrogenation, face challenges like high energy consumption, coke formation, and high temperature requirements \[10.1080/17415990412331327909\]. ODHP offers a solution by operating at lower temperatures, reducing coke formation \[10.1080/17415990412331327909\]. Oxygen, a preferred oxidant, enhances propene selectivity but risks over-oxidation to carbon oxides, limiting yields \[10.1080/17415990412331327909\]. The use of oxygen balances high propylene yields with the risk of explosive mixtures and over-oxidation \[10.1080/17415990412331327909\]. H2S in the feedstock improves propylene selectivity by altering the reaction pathway and preventing over-oxidation \[10.1080/17415990412331327909\].

                    Current propylene production via SC and FCC faces low yields and selectivity, exacerbated by the shift to ethane use, reducing propylene output \[10.1002/cctc.201200913\]. Propane dehydrogenation, though theoretically advantageous, is hindered by thermodynamics, requiring high temperatures for conversion and complicating product separation \[10.1002/cctc.201200913\]. ODHP could enhance yields but is limited by propylene's oxidation to oxygenated products, capping yields at 30% \[10.1002/cctc.201200913\]. Oxidant selection is critical: F2 is too reactive, Cl2 reactions are non-selective and potentially explosive, I2 reactions are slow and require high temperatures, and bromine, though more feasible, necessitates a high propane-to-bromine ratio to address polyhalogenation selectivity, limiting conversion \[10.1002/cctc.201200913\].

                    Current propylene production methods, like steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking, are energy-intensive and centralized, limiting natural gas reserve utilization in remote areas \[10.1002/ente.201900622\]. ODHP offers a potentially more energy-efficient and decentralized alternative \[10.1002/ente.201900622\]. However, it faces challenges, notably in oxidant selection; oxygen use can lead to side reactions, impacting propylene yield \[10.1002/ente.201900622\]. Efficient catalysts are crucial for propane activation under mild conditions while suppressing over-oxidation \[10.1002/ente.201900622\]. Managing the exothermic nature of the reaction is vital for safety, and controlling selectivity is more challenging due to propane's weaker CH and CC bonds \[10.1002/ente.201900622\].

                    Growing demand for propene highlights issues with current production methods, making ODHP an attractive alternative \[10.1016/j.jcou.2019.09.018\]. ODHP offers higher propane conversion and propene yield compared to non-oxidative dehydrogenation \[10.1016/j.jcou.2019.09.018\]. However, using oxygen as an oxidant introduces uncharted challenges, impacting the method's viability \[10.1016/j.jcou.2019.09.018\].

                    Propylene production struggles with achieving high propane conversion and selectivity due to propylene's higher oxidation susceptibility and propane cracking at temperatures above 700 degrees Celsius \[10.1016/S0926-860X(01)00816-X\]. ODHP, while offering potential improvements, faces challenges in maintaining selectivity and is hindered by safety issues related to oxidant selection, notably oxygen, affecting its commercial viability \[10.1016/S0926-860X(01)00816-X\].

                    Propylene production via steam cracking confronts high energy use, costs, and environmental concerns \[10.1039/c2ee22409g\]. ODHP offers a more energy-efficient and cost-effective solution, with CO2 as an oxidant further reducing costs and emissions \[10.1039/c2ee22409g\]. However, using oxygen risks over-oxidation, decreasing propylene selectivity, underlining the significance of oxidant choice in ODHP's success \[10.1039/c2ee22409g\].

                    Propylene faces a supply deficit due to high demand \[10.1021/acscatal.0c03999_0\]. Current production methods, like dehydrogenation, are limited by thermodynamic constraints for propane conversion and catalyst deactivation from coke formation \[10.1021/acscatal.0c03999_0\]. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) is advantageous due to its exothermic nature, avoiding thermodynamic limits at lower temperatures \[10.1021/acscatal.0c03999_0\]. However, using oxygen as an oxidant in ODHP can lead to overoxidation to carbon oxides, causing inefficient reactant use and low selectivity \[10.1021/acscatal.0c03999_0\].

                    Current propylene production faces high energy consumption, low selectivity, and economic pressures \[10.1021/cr5002436\]. ODHP offers efficiency and cost benefits by using propane \[10.1021/cr5002436\]. Oxidant choice is pivotal: oxygen reduces reaction temperatures but risks overoxidation, while CO2, safer, contends with endothermic dehydrogenation, potentially increasing coke and competitive adsorption, affecting catalysts \[10.1021/cr5002436\].

                    Propylene production faces challenges including high temperatures, expensive catalysts, and catalyst deactivation \[10.1039/D0CY00586J\]. ODHP reduces reaction temperatures but has issues with propylene selectivity due to overoxidation \[10.1039/D0CY00586J\]. Using CO2 as an oxidant avoids deep oxidation, minimizes coke formation
