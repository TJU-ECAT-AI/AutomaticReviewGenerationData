                    The escalating demand for propylene, coupled with the thermodynamic constraints and rapid catalyst deactivation in current production methods like steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) \[10.1016/j.cattod.2007.05.009\], has prompted the exploration of oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) as a viable alternative. ODHP directly produces propylene from propane, offering improved energy efficiency as an exothermal process \[10.1016/j.cattod.2007.05.009\]. However, using oxygen in ODHP increases energy losses and fixed costs due to CO2 production \[10.1016/j.cattod.2007.05.009\]. New technologies focusing on catalyst performance and innovative designs are needed to address these issues, aiming to achieve yields comparable to current olefin production methods \[10.1016/j.cattod.2007.05.009\].

                    Propylene production by steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking is energy-intensive, emits greenhouse gases, and produces diluting co-products \[10.1016/j.jcat.2010.06.010\]. ODHP offers a more direct, energy-efficient, and cleaner route. Oxygen boosts propylene yields but risks deep oxidation and requires energy-intensive separation \[10.1016/j.jcat.2010.06.010\]. N2O improves propene selectivity and reduces deep oxidation risk, albeit with lower activity and higher costs \[10.1016/j.jcat.2010.06.010\]. Oxidant choice is critical, affecting reaction pathway, product selectivity, and catalyst stability \[10.1016/j.jcat.2010.06.010\].

                    Propylene production is constrained by equilibrium limitations, which ODHP seeks to overcome \[10.1016/0021-9517(77)90228-7\]. Using SO2 as an oxidant in ODHP boosts selectivity per pass at high temperatures, offering an advantage over traditional methods \[10.1016/0021-9517(77)90228-7\]. However, SO2 increases propane conversion at the expense of lower propylene selectivity compared to pure propane feed, illustrating a key limitation \[10.1016/0021-9517(77)90228-7\].

                    Rising propylene demand outpaces production, necessitating efficient on-purpose methods \[10.1038/s41467-018-03793-w\]. Direct dehydrogenation of propane (DDP) is thermally constrained, requiring high temperatures for significant yields \[10.1038/s41467-018-03793-w\]. ODHP, using CO2 as a mild oxidant, reduces operating temperatures by oxidizing hydrogen and releasing heat \[10.1038/s41467-018-03793-w\]. CO2 boosts propane conversion by consuming H2 and prevents over-oxidation, reducing carbon oxide production compared to molecular oxygen \[10.1038/s41467-018-03793-w\].

                    Propylene production via propane dehydrogenation encounters challenges like side reactions, thermodynamic constraints, high energy needs, and catalyst deactivation \[10.1021/jp410750c\]. ODHP, using an oxidant, addresses some issues but introduces overoxidation and reaction instability, especially with oxygen \[10.1021/jp410750c\]. Catalysts, particularly vanadium-based oxides, improve selectivity and conversion, facilitating controlled reactions in ODHP \[10.1021/jp410750c\].

                    Propylene production faces challenges due to high costs and sustainability issues with current non-oxidative methods \[10.1039/C5CY00998G\]. ODHP offers higher energy efficiency and process simplicity, addressing these challenges \[10.1039/C5CY00998G\]. However, ODHP's use of oxygen as an oxidant can lead to over-oxidation, limiting selectivity to olefins \[10.1039/C5CY00998G\]. The use of CO2 as a mild oxidant is proposed to mitigate this issue, potentially turning the process exothermic and benefiting catalyst coking \[10.1039/C5CY00998G\].

                    Current propylene production methods are energy-intensive and complex, with by-product formation \[10.1134/S0023158418060010\]. ODHP offers a more direct and energy-efficient route to propylene. However, using oxygen can lead to deep oxidation, reducing propylene selectivity and forming CO and CO2 \[10.1134/S0023158418060010\]. Oxygen's reactivity with hydrocarbons necessitates controlled conditions to prevent runaway reactions, and oxygen separation from air increases costs \[10.1134/S0023158418060010\]. Precise dosing is required to avoid over-oxidation \[10.1134/S0023158418060010\].

                    Propylene production faces a supply-demand gap due to shale gas's low-cost ethene \[10.1126/science.aaf7885\]. ODHP offers an alternative, leveraging exothermic reactions at lower temperatures and enhanced catalyst stability to address this gap \[10.1126/science.aaf7885\]. A key challenge is preventing propene's over-oxidation to CO and CO2, which threatens the efficiency of the ODHP process \[10.1126/science.aaf7885\].

                    Current propylene production methods are energy-intensive and have low selectivity, relying on diminishing petroleum reserves \[10.1021/acs.chemrev.6b00551\]. ODHP offers a more energy-efficient and selective alternative. However, it faces limitations, especially in oxidant selection. Oxygen, while cheap and abundant, risks overoxidation and complicates temperature control, crucial for preventing product combustion \[10.1021/acs.chemrev.6b00551\]. Suitable catalysts and reactor designs are essential for ODHP's success \[10.1021/acs.chemrev.6b00551\].

                    Current propylene production struggles with coke formation. ODHP operates at lower temperatures, mitigating this issue \[10.1080/17415990412331327909\]. Oxygen, a preferred oxidant, enhances propene selectivity but risks over-oxidation, limiting propene yields to below 30% \[10.1080/17415990412331327909\]. H2S in the feed boosts propylene selectivity by suppressing over-oxidation \[10.1080/17415990412331327909\].

                    Current propylene production via SC and FCC suffers from low yields and selectivity, exacerbated by the shift to ethane use, which further reduces propylene output \[10.1002/cctc.201200913\]. Propane dehydrogenation, while theoretically ideal for high propylene selectivity and low investment, is constrained by thermodynamics, requiring high temperatures that complicate product separation \[10.1002/cctc.201200913\]. ODHP could enhance yields but is limited by propylene's oxidation to oxygenated products, capping yields at 30% \[10.1002/cctc.201200913\]. Oxidant selection is critical: F2 is too reactive, Cl2 reactions are non-selective and potentially explosive, I2 reactions are slow and require high temperatures, and bromine, though more feasible, necessitates a high propane-to-bromine ratio to avoid polyhalogenation, limiting conversion \[10.1002/cctc.201200913\].

                    Current propylene production, like steam cracking, is energy-intensive and centralized, limiting gas reserve use in remote areas \[10.1002/ente.201900622\]. ODHP offers a more energy-efficient, decentralized alternative. However, it faces challenges, notably in oxidant selection; oxygen can trigger side reactions, affecting propylene yield \[10.1002/ente.201900622\]. Efficient catalysts are vital for propane activation under mild conditions while preventing over-oxidation, and managing the exothermic reaction to avoid overheating is critical \[10.1002/ente.201900622\]. The use of oxygen in ODHP complicates selectivity control due to propane's weaker CH and CC bonds \[10.1002/ente.201900622\].

                    Propylene production faces challenges in achieving high propane conversion and selectivity, as propylene oxidizes more easily than propane and propane cracking occurs at high temperatures \[10.1016/S0926-860X(01)00816-X\]. ODHP aims to address these issues but encounters similar obstacles, particularly with selectivity decline and propane cracking \[10.1016/S0926-860X(01)00816-X\]. Oxygen selection as an oxidant introduces safety concerns \[10.1016/S0926-860X(01)00816-X\]. Despite these, ODHP shows potential for commercial propylene production, though combining high propane conversion and selectivity remains elusive \[10.1016/S0926-860X(01)00816-X\].

                    Current propylene production methods have high energy consumption, costs, and environmental issues, with reduced yield due to byproducts \[10.1039/c2ee22409g\]. ODHP presents a more efficient and selective process, potentially lowering costs and emissions \[10.1039/c2ee22409g\]. Using CO2 as an oxidant in ODHP enhances selectivity and avoids over-oxidation risks, unlike oxygen, which can decrease propylene yield by over-oxidizing to CO2 \[10.1039/c2ee22409g\]. The choice of oxidant is pivotal for propylene yield and selectivity in ODHP processes \[10.1039/c2ee22409g\].

                    Propylene production faces challenges including supply deficits due to high demand, thermodynamic limits in propane conversion, and catalyst deactivation from coke formation \[10.1021/acscatal.0c03999_0\]. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) is advantageous due to its exothermic nature, eliminating thermodynamic constraints at lower temperatures \[10.1021/acscatal.0c03999_0\]. However, using oxygen as an oxidant in ODHP can cause overoxidation to carbon oxides, leading to inefficient reactant use and low selectivity \[10.1021/acscatal.0c03999_0\].

                    Current propylene production methods face challenges including high energy consumption, low selectivity, and economic constraints \[10.1021/cr5002436\]. ODHP offers an economical propane feedstock and potentially more efficient conversion. However, selecting an oxidant is critical: oxygen can lower reaction temperatures and make the process exothermic, but risks overoxidation; CO2 is safer but lacks sufficient heat and can cause additional coke deposition and competitive adsorption on catalyst surfaces, impacting performance \[10.1021/cr5002436\].

                    Traditional propylene production methods, like fluid catalytic cracking and steam cracking, face challenges including high temperatures, costly catalysts, and catalyst deactivation due to coke formation \[10.1039/D0CY00586J\]. Propane oxidative dehydrogenation (ODHP) offers a solution by potentially lowering reaction temperatures due to its exothermic nature \[10.1039/D0CY00586J\]. However, ODHP introduces the challenge of controlling propylene selectivity, as overoxidation to carbon monoxide and dioxide is a risk \[10.1039/D0CY00586J\]. Carbon dioxide (CO2) emerges as a preferred oxidant in ODHP, as it can prevent deep oxidation, reduce coke formation, and promote propane conversion, addressing the limitations of traditional methods \[10.1039/D0CY00586J\].

                    Propylene production faces challenges including endothermic reactions, coke formation, and thermodynamic limitations \[10.1016/j.jcat.2015.12.015\]. ODHP, using oxygen as an oxidant, offers benefits such as lower reaction temperatures and reduced coke formation \[10.1016/j.jcat.2015.12.015\]. However, it has a drawback of low propylene selectivity due to total oxidation at high conversion rates, emphasizing the need for a selective catalyst \[10.1016/j.jcat.2015.12
