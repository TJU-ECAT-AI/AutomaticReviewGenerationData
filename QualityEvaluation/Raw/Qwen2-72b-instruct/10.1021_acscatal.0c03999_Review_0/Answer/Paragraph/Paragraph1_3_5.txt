                    The primary challenges in current propylene production methods, dominated by steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking (FCC), include meeting growing demand, especially due to ethylene preference, and addressing thermodynamic limits and coking issues in dehydrogenation processes \[10.1016/j.cattod.2007.05.009\]. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) directly addresses these challenges by offering a more exothermal and energy-efficient process, aligning better with market needs \[10.1016/j.cattod.2007.05.009\]. However, using oxygen in ODHP increases energy losses and fixed costs due to CO2 production \[10.1016/j.cattod.2007.05.009\]. Despite this, ODHP presents a promising alternative for propylene production, offering improved energy efficiency and process simplicity \[10.1016/j.cattod.2007.05.009\].

                    Current propylene production methods, like steam cracking, are energy-intensive and emit greenhouse gases. ODHP offers a more direct and potentially cleaner route, with oxygen boosting propylene yields but risking deep oxidation to CO2 \[10.1016/j.jcat.2010.06.010\]. N2O as an oxidant enhances propene selectivity but is less active and more costly \[10.1016/j.jcat.2010.06.010\]. The oxidant choice is pivotal, impacting reaction pathway, product selectivity, and catalyst stability \[10.1016/j.jcat.2010.06.010\].

                    Propylene production faces equilibrium limitations in dehydrogenation. ODHP, using SO2 as an oxidant, enhances selectivity and propane conversion at high temperatures, though it reduces propylene selectivity compared to pure propane feed \[10.1016/0021-9517(77)90228-7\].

                    Rising propylene demand outpaces current production, necessitating efficient methods. DDP's thermodynamic constraints and high temperature requirements for significant yields are addressed by ODHP using CO2 as a mild oxidant. This reduces operating temperatures, enhances propane conversion via the reverse water gas shift reaction, and minimizes carbon oxide production, unlike oxidative dehydrogenation with molecular oxygen \[10.1038/s41467-018-03793-w\].

                    Propylene production from propane dehydrogenation faces issues like side reactions, thermodynamic limits, high energy needs, and catalyst deactivation. ODHP, using an oxidant to initiate reactions, aims to mitigate these issues but introduces risks of overoxidation and reaction instability. Catalysts, notably vanadium-based and mixed-metal oxides, improve selectivity and conversion while curbing overoxidation, though they haven't yet matched established methods' yields \[10.1021/jp410750c\].

                    Propylene production, traditionally using non-oxidative processing of petroleum, faces sustainability and cost challenges.
