                    Propylene production's escalating demand, particularly in Western Europe, and the limitations of current methods like steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking (FCC), which are constrained by thermodynamics and catalyst deactivation, highlight the necessity for innovative technologies \[10.1016/j.cattod.2007.05.009\]. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) presents a direct route to propylene production, offering improved energy efficiency as an exothermal process compared to endothermal dehydrogenation and cracking \[10.1016/j.cattod.2007.05.009\]. However, using oxygen as an oxidant in ODHP can result in higher energy losses and fixed costs due to CO2 production \[10.1016/j.cattod.2007.05.009\]. The effectiveness of the catalyst is crucial for economic viability, and successful technologies will integrate innovative process designs with catalyst performance \[10.1016/j.cattod.2007.05.009\].

                    Current propylene production faces high energy consumption, greenhouse gas emissions, and co-product dilution \[10.1016/j.jcat.2010.06.010\]. ODHP offers a cleaner, more energy-efficient route, with oxygen boosting propylene yields but risking deep oxidation and requiring energy-intensive separation \[10.1016/j.jcat.2010.06.010\].
