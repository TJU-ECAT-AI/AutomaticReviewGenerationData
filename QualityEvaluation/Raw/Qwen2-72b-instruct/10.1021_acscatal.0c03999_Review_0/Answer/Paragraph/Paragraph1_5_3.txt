                    Challenges in propylene production and the potential of oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) as an alternative method: advantages, limitations, and the role of oxidants. Propylene production via steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) [\[10.1016/j.cattod.2007.05.009\]] faces growing demand and thermodynamic constraints, leading to rapid catalyst deactivation. ODHP directly produces propylene from propane, offering improved energy efficiency as an exothermal process [\[10.1016/j.cattod.2007.05.009\]]. However, using oxygen in ODHP increases energy losses and fixed costs due to CO2 production [\[10.1016/j.cattod.2007.05.009\]]. New technologies focusing on catalyst performance and innovative designs are needed to address these issues, aiming to achieve yields comparable to current olefin production methods [\[10.1016/j.cattod.2007.05.009\]].

                    Propylene production by steam cracking and FCC is energy-intensive, emits greenhouse gases, and produces diluting co-products [\[10.1016/j.jcat.2010.06.010\]]. ODHP offers a more direct, energy-efficient, and cleaner route [\[10.1016/j.jcat.2010.06.010\]]. Oxygen boosts propylene yields but risks deep oxidation and requires energy-intensive separation [\[10.1016/j.jcat.2010.06.010\]]. N2O improves propene selectivity and reduces deep oxidation risk, albeit with lower activity and higher costs [\[10.1016/j.jcat.2010.06.010\]]. Oxidant choice is critical, affecting reaction pathway, product selectivity, and catalyst stability [\[10.1016/j.jcat.2010.06.010\]].

                    Propylene production is constrained by equilibrium limitations, which ODHP seeks to overcome [\[10.1016/0021-9517(77)90228-7\]]. Using SO2 as an oxidant in ODHP boosts selectivity per pass at high temperatures, offering an advantage over traditional methods [\[10.1016/0021-9517(77)90228-7\]]. However, SO2 increases propane conversion at the expense of lower propylene selectivity compared to pure propane feed [\[10.1016/0021-9517(77)90228-7\]], illustrating a key limitation.

                    Rising propylene demand outpaces production, necessitating efficient on-purpose methods [\[10.1038/s41467-018-03793-w\]]. Direct dehydrogenation of propane (DDP) is thermally constrained, requiring high temperatures for significant yields [\[10.1038/s41467-018-03793-w\]]. ODHP using CO2 as a mild oxidant reduces operating temperatures by oxidizing hydrogen and releasing heat [\[10.1038/s41467-018-03793-w\]]. CO2 boosts propane conversion by consuming H2 and prevents over-oxidation, reducing carbon oxide production compared to molecular oxygen [\[10.1038/s41467-018-03793-w\]].

                    Propylene production via propane dehydrogenation encounters challenges like side reactions, thermodynamic constraints, high energy needs, and catalyst deactivation [\[10.1021/jp410750c\]]. ODHP, using an oxidant, addresses some issues but introduces overoxidation and reaction instability, especially with oxygen [\[10.1021/jp410750c\]]. Catalysts, particularly vanadium-based oxides, improve selectivity and conversion, facilitating controlled reactions in ODHP [\[10.1021/jp410750c\]].

                    Propylene production faces challenges due to high costs and sustainability issues with current non-oxidative methods [\[10.1039/C5CY00998G\]]. ODHP offers higher energy efficiency and process simplicity, addressing these challenges [\[10.1039/C5CY00998G\]]. However, ODHP's use of oxygen as an oxidant can lead to over-oxidation, limiting selectivity to olefins [\[10.1039/C5CY00998G\]]. The use of CO2 as a mild oxidant is proposed to mitigate this issue, potentially turning the process exothermic and benefiting catalyst coking [\[10.1039/C5CY00998G\]].

                    Current propylene production methods are energy-intensive and complex, with by-product formation [\[10.1134/S0023158418060010\]]. ODHP offers a more direct and energy-efficient route to propylene [\[10.1134/S0023158418060010\]]. However, using oxygen can lead to deep oxidation, reducing selectivity and posing safety risks [\[10.1134/S0023158418060010\]]. Oxygen's reactivity with hydrocarbons necessitates controlled conditions to prevent runaway reactions [\[10.1134/S0023158418060010\]].

                    Propylene production faces a supply-demand gap due to shale gas's low-cost ethene [\[10.1126/science.aaf7885\]]. ODHP offers an alternative, leveraging exothermic reactions at lower temperatures and enhanced catalyst stability to address this gap [\[10.1126/science.aaf7885\]]. A key challenge is preventing propene's over-oxidation to CO and CO2 [\[10.1126/science.aaf7885\]].

                    Current propylene production methods are energy-intensive and have low selectivity, relying on diminishing petroleum reserves [\[10.1021/acs.chemrev.6b00551\]]. ODHP offers a more efficient process with higher propylene yield but faces challenges, notably in oxidant choice [\[10.1021/acs.chemrev.6b00551\]]. Oxygen, though cheap and abundant, risks overoxidation, leading to byproducts and temperature control issues [\[10.1021/acs.chemrev.6b00551\]]. Suitable catalysts and reactor designs are crucial for ODHP's success [\[10.1021/acs.chemrev.6b00551\]].

                    Propylene production struggles with high energy consumption, coke formation, and high temperatures [\[10.1080/17415990412331327909\]]. ODHP mitigates these by operating at lower temperatures, reducing coke [\[10.1080/17415990412331327909\]]. Oxygen, a preferred oxidant, enhances propene selectivity but risks over-oxidation and explosive mixtures [\[10.1080/17415990412331327909\]]. H2S in the feedstock improves propylene selectivity by altering the reaction pathway [\[10.1080/17415990412331327909\]].

                    Current propylene production via SC and FCC faces low selectivity and yields, exacerbated by ethane preference and growing polypropylene demand [\[10.1002/cctc.201200913\]]. Propane dehydrogenation, though theoretically ideal, is thermodynamically limited, requiring high temperatures for conversion [\[10.1002/cctc.201200913\]]. ODHP could enhance yields but is capped at around 30% due to further propylene oxidation [\[10.1002/cctc.201200913\]]. Oxidant selection is critical: F2 is unsuitable due to reactivity and thermodynamics [\[10.1002/cctc.201200913\]]; Cl2 lacks selectivity [\[10.1002/cctc.201200913\]]; I2 is slow and favorable only at high temperatures [\[10.1002/cctc.201200913\]]; bromine, though more feasible, still faces polyhalogenation selectivity issues [\[10.1002/cctc.201200913\]].

                    Current propylene production methods are energy-intensive and centralized, limiting their use in remote areas [\[10.1002/ente.201900622\]]. ODHP offers a decentralized, more energy-efficient alternative [\[10.1002/ente.201900622\]]. However, it faces challenges, especially with oxidant selection; oxygen use can cause side reactions, impacting propylene yield [\[10.1002/ente.201900622\]]. Efficient catalysts are crucial to manage the exothermic reaction and prevent overheating [\[10.1002/ente.201900622\]].

                    Growing propene demand highlights the appeal of propane dehydrogenation, particularly ODHP, which offers higher conversion and yield, acting as a CO2 utilisation method [\[10.1016/j.jcou.2019.09.018\]]. However, using oxygen as an oxidant in ODHP presents unique challenges [\[10.1016/j.jcou.2019.09.018\]].

                    Propylene production faces challenges in achieving high propane conversion and selectivity, exacerbated by propylene's higher reactivity and propane cracking at temperatures above 700 C [\[10.1016/S0926-860X(01)00816-X\]]. ODHP aims to address these issues but struggles to combine high conversion with selectivity, hindering its commercial potential [\[10.1016/S0926-860X(01)00816-X\]]. Oxidant selection, particularly using oxygen, introduces safety concerns [\[10.1016/S0926-860X(01)00816-X\]].

                    Propylene production via steam cracking faces high energy consumption, costs, and environmental impacts [\[10.1039/c2ee22409g\]]. ODHP presents a more energy-efficient and cost-effective solution, with CO2 as an oxidant reducing costs and emissions [\[10.1039/c2ee22409g\]]. However, using oxygen risks over-oxidation, decreasing propylene selectivity [\[10.1039/c2ee22409g\]], underscoring the importance of oxidant choice for yield and selectivity in ODHP processes [\[10.1039/c2ee22409g\]].

                    Propylene production faces challenges including a supply deficit due to high demand, thermodynamic limits for propane conversion, and catalyst deactivation from coke formation [\[10.1021/acscatal.0c03999_0\]]. ODHP, an exothermic process, overcomes thermodynamic constraints at lower temperatures, making it an attractive alternative [\[10.1021/acscatal.0c03999_0\]]. However, using oxygen as an oxidant in ODHP can cause overoxidation to carbon oxides, leading to inefficient reactant use and low process selectivity [\[10.1021/acscatal.0c03999_0\]].

                    Current propylene production methods suffer from high energy use, low selectivity, dwindling reserves, and rising costs [\[10.1021/cr5002436\]]. ODHP presents an economical propane feedstock and potentially more efficient conversion [\[10.1021/cr5002436\]]. However, it faces limitations, notably in oxidant selection. Oxygen can lower reaction temperatures and make the process exothermic, but it risks overoxidation and side reactions, affecting olefin selectivity [\[10.1021/cr5002436\]]. CO2 is safer but provides insufficient heat and can increase coke deposition and competitive adsorption on catalyst surfaces, affecting performance [\[10.1021/cr5002436\]].

                    Propylene production faces challenges including high temperatures, costly catalysts, and catalyst deactivation due to coke [\[10.1039/D0CY00586J\]]. ODHP can lower reaction temperatures due to its exothermic nature but struggles with controlling propylene selectivity due to unavoidable combustion [\[10.1039/D0CY00586J\]]. Using CO2 as an oxidant over oxygen can prevent deep oxidation, reduce coke formation, and enhance propane conversion, addressing key limitations of ODHP [\[10.1039/D0CY00586J\]].

                    Current propylene production methods, like steam cracking and dehydrogenation, face challenges including endothermic reactions, coke production, and thermodynamic constraints [\[10.1016/j.jcat.2015.12.015\]]. ODHP, using oxygen, offers lower reaction temperatures
