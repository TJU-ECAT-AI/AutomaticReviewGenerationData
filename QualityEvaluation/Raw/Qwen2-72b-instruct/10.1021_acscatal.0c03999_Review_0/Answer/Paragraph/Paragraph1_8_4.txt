                    Challenges in propylene production, particularly in Western Europe, are exacerbated by the preference for ethylene production and the limitations of current methods like steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) \[10.1016/j.cattod.2007.05.009\]. These methods struggle to meet growing demand due to thermodynamic constraints and coking issues, leading to catalyst deactivation. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP), a direct route to propylene, offers an exothermal, energy-efficient process compared to endothermal dehydrogenation and cracking \[10.1016/j.cattod.2007.05.009\]. However, using oxygen as an oxidant in ODHP increases energy losses and fixed costs due to CO2 production \[10.1016/j.cattod.2007.05.009\]. Catalyst performance and innovative process designs are crucial for ODHP's commercial success, as they determine economic attractiveness and link to process efficiency \[10.1016/j.cattod.2007.05.009\].

                    Current propylene production methods, like steam cracking, are energy-intensive and environmentally impactful \[10.1016/j.jcat.2010.06.010\]. ODHP offers a cleaner, more efficient alternative, with oxygen as an oxidant boosting yields but risking deep oxidation and requiring energy-intensive separation \[10.1016/j.jcat.2010.06.010\]. N2O, while potentially more costly, improves propene selectivity and reduces catalyst deactivation \[10.1016/j.jcat.2010.06.010\]. The oxidant choice is critical, influencing reaction pathway, product selectivity, and catalyst stability \[10.1016/j.jcat.2010.06.010\].

                    Propylene production faces equilibrium constraints in dehydrogenation \[10.1016/0021-9517(77)90228-7\]. ODHP, using SO2 as an oxidant, improves propane conversion at high temperatures but sacrifices propylene selectivity compared to pure propane feed \[10.1016/0021-9517(77)90228-7\]. The literature lacks focus on the specific challenges of using oxygen as an ODHP oxidant \[10.1016/0021-9517(77)90228-7\].

                    Rising propylene demand outpaces current production methods \[10.1038/s41467-018-03793-w\]. Direct dehydrogenation of propane (DDP) is limited by high energy requirements, requiring temperatures above 973 K for significant yields \[10.1038/s41467-018-03793-w\]. ODHP using CO2 as a mild oxidant reduces operating temperatures and increases propane conversion through the reverse water gas shift reaction, unlike molecular oxygen, which prevents over-oxidation and reduces carbon oxide production \[10.1038/s41467-018-03793-w\].

                    Propylene production via propane dehydrogenation encounters issues like side reactions, thermodynamic constraints, high energy demands, and catalytic deactivation \[10.1021/jp410750c\]. ODHP, using an oxidant, offers an exothermic process with reduced coke formation \[10.1021/jp410750c\]. However, using oxygen risks overoxidation to CO and CO2 \[10.1021/jp410750c\]. Catalysts, notably vanadium-based and mixed-metal oxides, enhance selectivity and conversion while suppressing complete oxidation \[10.1021/jp410750c\].

                    Propylene production, traditionally using costly and unsustainable petroleum-based methods, faces challenges \[10.1039/C5CY00998G\]. ODHP offers higher energy efficiency and process simplicity, addressing these issues \[10.1039/C5CY00998G\]. However, using oxygen as an oxidant in ODHP can lead to over-oxidation, limiting selectivity to olefins \[10.1039/C5CY00998G\]. Recent studies propose using CO2 as a mild oxidant to mitigate this limitation, potentially turning the process exothermic and benefiting catalyst coking \[10.1039/C5CY00998G\].

                    Propylene production via steam cracking is energy-intensive and complex \[10.1134/S0023158418060010\]. ODHP offers a more efficient alternative but faces limitations, particularly in oxidant selection \[10.1134/S0023158418060010\]. Using oxygen can lead to deep oxidation, reducing propylene selectivity and posing safety risks due to its reactivity \[10.1134/S0023158418060010\]. Oxygen separation adds to costs, and precise dosing is crucial to prevent over-oxidation \[10.1134/S0023158418060010\].

                    Shale gas's surge in low-cost ethene widens the propylene supply-demand gap, spotlighting ODHP as a promising technology \[10.1126/science.aaf7885\]. ODHP, with its thermodynamic benefits and enhanced catalyst stability, could outperform non-oxidative methods \[10.1126/science.aaf7885\]. Yet, it must tackle the hurdle of over-oxidation of propene to CO and CO2, a significant hurdle \[10.1126/science.aaf7885\].

                    Current propylene production methods have high energy demands, low selectivity, and rely on diminishing oil reserves \[10.1021/acs.chemrev.6b00551\]. ODHP offers a more energy-efficient and selective alternative, but using oxygen can cause overoxidation, leading to unwanted carbon oxides and necessitating costly oxygen separation \[10.1021/acs.chemrev.6b00551\]. Oxygen's presence complicates temperature control, reducing propylene yield and causing catalyst deactivation through coke formation \[10.1021/acs.chemrev.6b00551\]. Suitable catalysts and reactor designs are essential for ODHP's success \[10.1021/acs.chemrev.6b00551\].

                    Current propylene production methods are energy-intensive and prone to coke formation at high temperatures \[10.1080/17415990412331327909\]. ODHP addresses these issues by operating at lower temperatures, reducing coke \[10.1080/17415990412331327909\]. Oxygen, as an oxidant, enhances propene selectivity but limits alkene selectivities due to unselective combustion \[10.1080/17415990412331327909\]. Over-oxidation to carbon oxides reduces propene yields, and oxygen's use requires strict control to prevent explosions \[10.1080/17415990412331327909\]. Increased conversion with oxygen leads to selectivity losses, resulting in propene yields below 30% \[10.1080/17415990412331327909\].

                    Propylene production via steam cracking and fluidic catalytic cracking faces low yields and selectivity, exacerbated by the shift to ethane use, reducing the propylene/ethylene ratio \[10.1002/cctc.201200913\]. Propane dehydrogenation, though theoretically advantageous, is limited by thermodynamics, requiring high temperatures that complicate product separation \[10.1002/cctc.201200913\]. ODHP offers higher yields but is constrained by the consecutive oxidation of propylene, limiting yields to around 30% \[10.1002/cctc.201200913\]. Oxidant selection is critical: F2 is unsuitable due to its high reactivity and unfavorable thermodynamics; Cl2 reactions are non-selective and potentially explosive; I2 reactions are slow and only favorable at high temperatures, with recycling efficiency limiting industrial application; bromine, though more feasible, requires a high propane to bromine ratio to address polyhalogenation selectivity, limiting single-pass conversion \[10.1002/cctc.201200913\].

                    Current propylene production methods are energy-intensive and centralized, limiting the use of remote gas reserves \[10.1002/ente.201900622\]. ODHP offers a more energy-efficient and decentralized alternative but faces challenges, particularly with oxidant selection \[10.1002/ente.201900622\]. Oxygen use can lead to side reactions, affecting propylene yield \[10.1002/ente.201900622\]. Efficient catalysts are vital for propane activation under mild conditions, suppressing over-oxidation and managing the exothermic reaction to prevent overheating \[10.1002/ente.201900622\].

                    Growing propene demand highlights ODHP's potential for higher propane conversion and propene yield than non-oxidative methods, with added benefits of CO2 utilisation and syngas by-products \[10.1016/j.jcou.2019.09.018\]. However, using oxygen as an oxidant in ODHP presents specific challenges, underscoring the complexity of this method \[10.1016/j.jcou.2019.09.018\].

                    Propylene production struggles with achieving high propane conversion and selectivity due to propylene's higher oxidation susceptibility and propane cracking at temperatures above 700 degrees Celsius \[10.1016/S0926-860X(01)00816-X\]. ODHP aims to address these issues but faces challenges in maintaining selectivity and managing propane cracking \[10.1016/S0926-860X(01)00816-X\]. Oxygen selection in ODHP raises safety and process stability concerns, hindering its commercial potential \[10.1016/S0926-860X(01)00816-X\].

                    Propylene production via steam cracking is energy-intensive, costly, and environmentally problematic \[10.1039/c2ee22409g\]. ODHP offers a more efficient and economical solution, with CO2 as an oxidant further reducing costs and emissions \[10.1039/c2ee22409g\]. However, using oxygen can lead to over-oxidation, decreasing propylene selectivity, underscoring the critical role of oxidant choice in ODHP's success \[10.1039/c2ee22409g\].

                    Propylene, a vital petrochemical feedstock, faces a supply deficit due to high demand \[10.1021/acscatal.0c03999_0\]. Current production methods, including steam cracking, fluid catalytic cracking, and direct dehydrogenation of propane (DHP), are constrained by thermodynamic limits and catalyst deactivation from coke formation \[10.1021/acscatal.0c03999_0\]. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP), an exothermic process, overcomes these constraints at lower temperatures, making it an attractive alternative \[10.1021/acscatal.0c03999_0\]. However, using oxygen as an oxidant in ODHP can cause overoxidation, reducing process efficiency and selectivity \[10.1021/acscatal.0c03999_0\].

                    Current propylene production methods suffer from high energy demands, low selectivity, and rising costs \[10.1021/cr5002436\]. ODHP, using propane, offers a more economical solution with efficient conversion \[10.1021/cr5002436\]. However, it struggles with oxidant selection \[10.1021/cr5002436\]. Oxygen, while lowering reaction temperatures and making the process exothermic, risks overoxidation and affects olefin selectivity \[10.1021/cr5002436\]. CO2, as a milder oxidant, can enhance catalyst activity without overoxidation risks but may not provide enough heat and can lead to additional coke deposition and competitive adsorption, impacting performance \[10.1021/cr5002436\].

                    Propylene production faces challenges including high temperatures, costly catalysts, and catalyst deactivation \[10.1039/D0CY00586J\]. ODHP potentially mitigates these by lowering temperatures due to its exothermic nature, but selectivity issues arise from overoxidation risks \[10.1039/D0CY00586J\]. Using CO2 as an oxidant in ODHP avoids deep oxidation, reduces coke formation, and enhances propane conversion, offering advantages over oxygen \[10.1039/D0CY00586J\].

                    Current propylene production methods, including steam cracking, FCC, and DH, face challenges like endothermic reactions, coke formation, and thermodynamic constraints \[10.101
