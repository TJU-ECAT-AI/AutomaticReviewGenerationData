                    The escalating demand for propylene, coupled with the thermodynamic constraints and rapid catalyst deactivation in current production methods, has prompted an urgent need for alternatives. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP), a process that directly converts propane to propylene, offers improved energy efficiency as an exothermal reaction, contrasting with the endothermal nature of traditional dehydrogenation and cracking methods \[10.1016/j.cattod.2007.05.009\]. However, the use of oxygen in ODHP introduces additional energy losses and fixed costs, primarily due to CO2 production \[10.1016/j.cattod.2007.05.009\]. 

                    ODHP presents a more direct, energy-efficient, and cleaner route to propylene production compared to traditional methods, which are energy-intensive, emit greenhouse gases, and produce diluting co-products \[10.1016/j.jcat.2010.06.010\]. Oxygen boosts propylene yields but risks deep oxidation and requires energy-intensive separation \[10.1016/j.jcat.2010.06.010\]. N2O improves propene selectivity and reduces deep oxidation risk, albeit with lower activity and higher costs \[10.1016/j.jcat.2010.06.010\]. The choice of oxidant is critical, affecting reaction pathway, product selectivity, and catalyst stability \[10.1016/j.jcat.2010.06.010\].

                    Propylene production is constrained by equilibrium limitations, which ODHP seeks to overcome by using SO2 as an oxidant, enhancing selectivity per pass at high temperatures \[10.1016/0021-9517(77)90228-7\]. However, SO2 increases propane conversion at the expense of lower propylene selectivity compared to pure propane feed \[10.1016/0021-9517(77)90228-7\]. 

                    Rising propylene demand outpaces production, necessitating efficient on-purpose methods. Direct dehydrogenation of propane (DDP) is energy-intensive, requiring temperatures above 973 K for substantial yields. ODHP, using CO2 as a mild oxidant, reduces operating temperatures by oxidizing hydrogen and releasing heat \[10.1038/s41467-018-03793-w\]. CO2 boosts propane conversion by consuming H2 and prevents over-oxidation, reducing carbon oxide production compared to molecular oxygen \[10.1038/s41467-018-03793.w\].

                    Propylene production via propane dehydrogenation encounters challenges like side reactions, thermodynamic constraints, high energy needs, and catalyst deactivation. ODHP, using an oxidant, addresses some issues but introduces overoxidation and reaction instability, especially with oxygen \[10.1021/jp410750c\]. Catalysts, particularly vanadium-based oxides, improve selectivity and conversion, facilitating controlled reactions in ODHP \[10.1021/jp410750c\].

                    Propylene production faces challenges due to high costs and sustainability issues with current non-oxidative methods. ODHP offers higher energy efficiency and process simplicity, addressing these challenges. However, ODHP's use of oxygen as an oxidant can lead to over-oxidation, limiting selectivity to olefins. The use of CO2 as a mild oxidant is proposed to mitigate this issue, potentially turning the process exothermic and benefiting catalyst coking \[10.1039/C5CY00998G\].

                    Current propylene production methods are energy-intensive and complex, with by-product formation. ODHP offers a more direct and energy-efficient route to propylene. However, using oxygen can lead to deep oxidation, reducing selectivity and posing safety risks, necessitating precise dosing to prevent over-oxidation \[10.1134/S0023158418060010\].

                    Propylene production faces a supply-demand gap due to shale gas's low-cost ethene. ODHP offers an alternative, leveraging exothermic reactions at lower temperatures and enhanced catalyst stability to address this gap \[10.1126/science.aaf7885\].

                    Current propylene production methods are energy-intensive and have low selectivity, relying on diminishing petroleum reserves. ODHP offers a more energy-efficient and selective alternative. However, it faces limitations, especially in oxidant selection. Oxygen, while cheap and abundant, risks overoxidation and complicates temperature control, crucial for preventing product combustion \[10.1021/acs.chemrev.6b00551\].

                    Current propylene production struggles with coke formation. ODHP operates at lower temperatures, mitigating this issue. Oxygen, a preferred oxidant, enhances propene selectivity but risks over-oxidation, limiting propene yields to below 30%. H2S in the feed boosts propylene selectivity by suppressing over-oxidation \[10.1080/17415990412331327909\].

                    Current propylene production via SC and FCC faces low yields and selectivity, exacerbated by the shift to ethane use, which further reduces propylene output. Propane dehydrogenation, while theoretically ideal for high propylene selectivity and low investment, is constrained by thermodynamics, requiring high temperatures that complicate product separation. ODHP could enhance yields but is limited by propylene's oxidation to oxygenated products, capping yields at 30% \[10.1002/cctc.201200913\].

                    Current propylene production methods, like steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking, are energy-intensive and centralized, limiting gas reserve use in remote areas. ODHP offers a more energy-efficient, decentralized alternative. However, it faces challenges, notably in oxidant selection; oxygen can trigger side reactions, affecting propylene yield. Efficient catalysts are vital for propane activation under mild conditions while preventing over-oxidation \[10.1002/ente.201900622\].

                    Growing propene demand highlights the potential of ODHP for higher propane conversion and propene yield, with CO2 utilisation as a by-product. However, using oxygen as an oxidant presents challenges, limiting the method's effectiveness \[10.1016/j.jcou.2019.09.018\].

                    Propylene production struggles with achieving high propane conversion and selectivity, as propylene oxidizes more easily than propane and propane cracking occurs at high temperatures. ODHP aims to address these issues but encounters similar obstacles, particularly with selectivity decline and propane cracking. Oxygen selection as an oxidant introduces safety concerns. Despite these, ODHP shows potential for commercial propylene production, though combining high propane conversion and selectivity remains elusive \[10.1016/S0926-860X(01)00816-X\].

                    Current propylene production methods have high energy consumption, costs, and environmental issues, with reduced yield due to byproducts. ODHP offers a more energy-efficient, cost-effective, and selective process. Using CO2 as an oxidant in ODHP further reduces costs, emissions, and energy use, promoting selective dehydrogenation without over-oxidation risks. However, using oxygen can decrease propylene selectivity due to over-oxidation to CO2 \[10.1039/c2ee22409g\].

                    Propylene production faces challenges including supply deficits due to high demand, thermodynamic limits in propane conversion, and catalyst deactivation from coke formation. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) is advantageous due to its exothermic nature, eliminating thermodynamic constraints at lower temperatures. However, using oxygen as an oxidant in ODHP can cause overoxidation to carbon oxides, leading to inefficient reactant use and low selectivity \[10.1021/acscatal.0c03999_0\].

                    Current propylene production methods face challenges including high energy consumption, low selectivity, and economic constraints. ODHP offers an economical propane feedstock and potentially more efficient conversion. However, selecting an oxidant is critical: oxygen can lower reaction temperatures and make the process exothermic, but risks overoxidation; CO2 is safer but lacks sufficient heat and can cause additional coke deposition and competitive adsorption on catalyst surfaces, impacting performance \[10.1021/cr5002436\].

                    Traditional propylene production methods, like fluid catalytic cracking and steam cracking, face challenges including high temperatures, costly catalysts, and catalyst deactivation due to coke formation. Propane oxidative dehydrogenation (ODHP) offers a solution by potentially lowering reaction temperatures due to its exothermic nature. However, ODHP introduces the challenge of controlling propylene selectivity, as overoxidation to carbon monoxide and dioxide is a risk. Carbon dioxide (CO2) emerges as a preferred oxidant in ODHP, as it can prevent deep oxidation, reduce coke formation, and promote propane conversion, addressing the limitations of traditional methods \[10.1039/D0CY00586J\].

                    Current propylene production methods, including steam cracking, FCC, and DH, face challenges like endothermic reactions, coke formation, and thermodynamic limitations. ODHP, using oxygen as an oxidant, offers benefits such as lower reaction temperatures and reduced coke formation. However, it has a drawback of low propylene selectivity due to total oxidation at high conversion rates, emphasizing the need for a selective catalyst \[10.1016/j.jcat.2015.12.015\].

                    Propylene demand exceeds conventional production capacities, highlighting propane dehydrogenation (PDH). Direct dehydrogenation is limited by low yields, high temperatures, and side reactions. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) is exothermic and non-thermodynamically limited, yet struggles with propylene selectivity due to over-oxidation. Carbon dioxide (CO2) is a promising soft oxidant for PDH, aiding in coke removal and utilizing CO2. However, catalyst deactivation from coke and Cr(VI) reduction presents ongoing challenges \[10.1080/00986445.2015.1017638\].

                    Propylene production's challenges include high energy use, catalyst regeneration, and thermodynamic limits. ODHP offers lower energy consumption, eliminates catalyst regeneration, and avoids thermodynamic constraints. However, O2 in ODHP can cause flammability and poor selectivity. Using CO2 as a soft oxidant in ODHP is safer and more readily available, mitigating these issues \[10.1007/s10562-017-2282-3\].

                    Growing propylene demand and limitations in current methods, including coking and thermodynamic constraints, underscore the need for alternatives. ODHP offers an exothermic route to propylene, improving energy efficiency over endothermal dehydrogenation and cracking. However, using oxygen in ODHP increases energy losses and fixed costs due to CO2 production, a by-product of alkane ODH \[10.1016/j.cattod.2007.05.009\].

                    Current propylene production, like steam cracking, is energy-intensive and emits greenhouse gases. ODHP offers a more efficient route with lower energy use and fewer byproducts. Oxygen boosts propylene yields but risks deep oxidation and requires costly separation. N2O enhances propene selectivity and mitigates deep oxidation, albeit with lower activity and higher costs \[10.1016/j.jcat.2010.06.010\].

                    Propylene production is constrained by equilibrium limitations in dehydrogenation. ODHP, using SO2 as an oxidant, enhances selectivity per pass at high temperatures, a significant advantage. However, SO2 addition boosts propane conversion at the expense of propylene selectivity, illustrating ODHP's inherent trade-offs \[10.1016/0021-9517(77)90228-7\].

                    Rising propylene demand outpaces production, highlighting the need for efficient methods. Direct dehydrogenation of propane (DDP) is thermally constrained, requiring high temperatures for significant yields. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) using CO2 as a mild oxidant reduces temperatures by oxidizing hydrogen from propane, releasing heat, and increasing propane conversion by consuming H2. Unlike oxidative dehydrogenation with molecular oxygen, CO2 suppresses over-oxidation, minimizing carbon oxide production \[10.1038/s41467-018-03793.w\].

                    Propylene production from propane dehydrogenation faces challenges like side reactions, thermodynamic constraints, high energy demand, and catalytic deactivation due to coke formation. ODHP, using an oxidant to initiate the reaction, aims to mitigate these issues. However, oxygen as an oxidant risks overoxidation to CO and CO2 and reaction instability. Catalysts, notably vanadium-based and mixed-metal oxides, are studied to control complete oxidation and enhance ODH activity and selectivity. Despite progress, no catalyst system has yet matched the efficiency of current industrial olefin production methods \[10.1021/jp410750c\].

                    Propylene production, traditionally based on non-oxidative processing of petroleum, faces high costs and sustainability issues. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) offers higher energy efficiency and process simplicity, addressing these challenges. However, ODHP's use of oxygen as an oxidant can lead to over-oxidation, limiting selectivity to olefins. The use of CO2 as a mild oxidant is proposed to mitigate this issue, potentially turning the process exothermic and benefiting catalyst coking, as evidenced by successful applications in other partial oxidation reactions \[10.1039/C5CY00998G\].

                    Propylene production via steam cracking is energy-intensive and complex. ODHP offers a more efficient route but faces limitations, especially in oxidant selection. Oxygen use in ODHP can reduce propylene selectivity by forming CO and CO2,
