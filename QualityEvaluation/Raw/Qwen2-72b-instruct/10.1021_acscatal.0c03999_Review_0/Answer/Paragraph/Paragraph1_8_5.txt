                    The current landscape of propylene production is dominated by energy-intensive methods like steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking (FCC), which struggle to meet the growing demand, particularly in Western Europe \[10.1016/j.cattod.2007.05.009\]. These methods are constrained by thermodynamics and coking issues, leading to catalyst deactivation. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP), an exothermal process, offers an alternative route to propylene production, improving energy efficiency over endothermal dehydrogenation and cracking. However, using oxygen as an oxidant in ODHP increases energy losses and fixed costs due to CO2 production \[10.1016/j.cattod.2007.05.009\]. Catalyst performance and innovative process designs are crucial for ODHP's commercial success.
