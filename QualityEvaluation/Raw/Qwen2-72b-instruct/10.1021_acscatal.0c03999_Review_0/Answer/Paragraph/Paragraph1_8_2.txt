                    Challenges in propylene production, particularly in Western Europe, are exacerbated by the preference for ethylene production and the limitations of current methods like steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) \[10.1016/j.cattod.2007.05.009\]. These methods struggle to meet growing demand due to thermodynamic constraints and coking issues, leading to catalyst deactivation. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) directly addresses these challenges by producing propylene more efficiently, thanks to its exothermal nature, which contrasts with endothermal dehydrogenation and cracking. However, using oxygen as an oxidant in ODHP increases energy losses and fixed costs due to CO2 production \[10.1016/j.cattod.2007.05.009\]. Catalyst performance and innovative process designs are crucial for successful commercial technologies.

                    Current propylene production methods are energy-intensive and emit greenhouse gases, whereas ODHP offers a cleaner, more energy-efficient route \[10.1016/j.jcat.2010.06.010\]. Oxygen boosts propylene yields but risks deep oxidation and necessitates energy-intensive separation. Nitrous oxide (N2O) enhances selectivity and reduces catalyst deactivation, though it may decrease activity, has higher costs, and raises environmental concerns. The oxidant choice significantly impacts the reaction pathway, product selectivity, and catalyst stability.

                    Propylene production faces equilibrium limitations in dehydrogenation. ODHP, using SO2 as an oxidant, improves selectivity at high temperatures but sacrifices propylene selectivity for increased propane conversion compared to pure propane feed \[10.1016/0021-9517(77)90228-7\]. This highlights the inherent trade-offs in ODHP's performance.

                    Rising propylene demand outpaces current production, necessitating efficient methods. Direct dehydrogenation of propane (DDP) is energy-intensive, requiring high temperatures for significant yields. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) using CO2 as a mild oxidant addresses this by lowering operating temperatures and enhancing propane conversion through the reverse water gas shift reaction, while also preventing over-oxidation and minimizing carbon oxides production compared to molecular oxygen \[10.1038/s41467-018-03793-w\].

                    Propylene production via propane dehydrogenation faces challenges including side reactions, thermodynamic constraints, high energy demands, and catalytic deactivation due to coke formation \[10.1021/jp410750c\]. ODHP, using an oxidant to initiate reactions, aims to mitigate these problems. However, oxygen as an oxidant risks overoxidation to CO and CO2 and reaction instability. Catalysts, notably vanadium-based and mixed-metal oxides, enhance ODHP activity and selectivity, though current yields fall short of industrial standards.

                    Propylene production via non-oxidative processing of petroleum is costly and unsustainable. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) offers higher energy efficiency and process simplicity, addressing these issues \[10.1039/C5CY00998G\]. However, ODHP's use of oxygen as an oxidant can lead to over-oxidation, limiting selectivity to olefins. Literature indicates that while ODHP can achieve propylene yields up to 40%, these are still insufficient for industrial implementation. The use of CO2 as a mild oxidant is proposed to mitigate over-oxidation, potentially turning the process exothermic and reducing catalyst coking.

                    Propylene production by steam cracking is energy-intensive and complex. ODHP offers a more efficient alternative, but using oxygen as an oxidant risks deep oxidation, reducing propylene selectivity, and poses safety hazards due to its reactivity with hydrocarbons \[10.1134/S0023158418060010\]. Oxygen separation adds to costs, and precise dosing is critical to prevent over-oxidation.

                    Shale gas increases low-cost ethene, widening the propylene supply-demand gap, driving interest in on-purpose technologies. ODHP, exothermic and operating at lower temperatures, enhances catalyst stability compared to non-oxidative methods, addressing challenges in propylene production \[10.1126/science.aaf7885\]. However, it must overcome the significant challenge of preventing propene's over-oxidation to CO and CO2.

                    Current propylene production methods have high energy demands, low selectivity, and rely on diminishing oil reserves. ODHP offers a more energy-efficient and selective alternative, but using oxygen can cause overoxidation, leading to unwanted carbon oxides and necessitating costly oxygen separation \[10.1021/acs.chemrev.6b00551\]. Oxygen's presence complicates temperature control, reducing propylene yield and causing catalyst deactivation through coke formation. Suitable catalysts and reactor designs are essential for ODHP's success.

                    Propylene production faces challenges including high energy consumption, coke formation, and high operational temperatures. ODHP addresses these issues by operating at lower temperatures, reducing coke. Oxygen, as an oxidant, enhances propene selectivity but limits alkene selectivities due to unselective combustion, risking over-oxidation to carbon oxides and decreasing propene yields \[10.1080/17415990412331327909\]. Oxygen's use requires careful control to prevent explosive mixtures and leads to selectivity losses with increased conversion, resulting in yields below 30%.

                    Propylene production via SC and FCC faces low yields and selectivity, exacerbated by the shift to ethane use, which reduces propylene output. Propane dehydrogenation, though theoretically ideal, is thermodynamically limited, requiring high temperatures that complicate product separation. ODHP offers higher propylene yields but is capped at about 30% due to propylene's oxidation to oxygenated products \[10.1002/cctc.201200913\]. Oxidant choice is critical: F2 is unsuitable due to reactivity and thermodynamics, Cl2 reactions are non-selective, I2 reactions, while selective, are slow and require high temperatures. Bromine offers a more feasible option, but polyhalogenation selectivity requires a higher propane to bromine ratio, limiting conversion.

                    Propylene production methods are energy-intensive and centralized, limiting efficiency. ODHP offers a decentralized, more energy-efficient alternative but faces challenges, notably in oxidant selection. Oxygen, while an attractive oxidant, can cause side reactions, impacting propylene selectivity and yield \[10.1002/ente.201900622\]. Efficient catalysts are crucial for propane activation under mild conditions while preventing over-oxidation. Managing the exothermic nature of the reaction is essential for safety and efficiency.

                    Growing propene demand strains current production methods, which ODHP addresses by boosting propane conversion and propene yield. However, using oxygen as an oxidant in ODHP presents unexplored challenges, indicating a research gap \[10.1016/j.jcou.2019.09.018\]. ODHP demonstrates potential for chemical CO2 utilisation, but this aspect is secondary to the core discussion of production challenges and oxidant selection.

                    Propylene production struggles with achieving high propane conversion and selectivity, as propylene oxidizes easily and propane cracking occurs at high temperatures. ODHP aims to improve this but faces challenges in maintaining selectivity at higher conversion rates and managing propane cracking. Oxygen's use as an oxidant in ODHP raises safety concerns, impacting commercial viability \[10.1016/S0926-860X(01)00816-X\].

                    Propylene production via steam cracking is energy-intensive, costly, and environmentally concerning. ODHP offers a more efficient and economical solution with potential emission reductions. Selecting CO2 as an oxidant in ODHP enhances benefits, whereas oxygen can cause over-oxidation, reducing propylene selectivity. The oxidant choice is pivotal for propylene yield and selectivity in ODHP processes \[10.1039/c2ee22409g\].

                    Propylene, a critical petrochemical feedstock, faces a supply deficit due to high demand. Current production methods, including steam cracking, fluid catalytic cracking, and direct dehydrogenation of propane, are limited by thermodynamic constraints and catalyst deactivation. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP), an exothermic process, overcomes these limitations at lower temperatures. However, using oxygen as an oxidant in ODHP can lead to overoxidation, causing inefficient reactant use and low process selectivity \[10.1021/acscatal.0c03999_0\].

                    Current propylene production methods suffer from high energy consumption, low selectivity, and reliance on dwindling oil reserves. ODHP, using propane, offers a more efficient conversion but faces challenges in oxidant selection. Oxygen, while lowering reaction temperatures and making reactions exothermic, risks over-oxidation and side reactions, affecting olefin selectivity. CO2, as a milder oxidant, enhances catalyst activity without over-oxidation risks but may lead to additional coke deposition and competitive adsorption, impacting catalyst performance \[10.1021/cr5002436\].

                    Propylene production faces challenges including high temperatures, costly catalysts, and catalyst deactivation. Propane oxidative dehydrogenation (ODHP) reduces reaction temperatures due to its exothermic nature but struggles with controlling propylene selectivity. Using CO2 as an oxidant in ODHP avoids deep oxidation, reduces coke formation, and favors propane conversion, addressing the limitations of current methods and ODHP \[10.1039/D0CY00586J\].

                    Propylene production via steam cracking, FCC, and DH faces challenges like endothermic reactions, coke formation, and thermodynamic constraints. ODHP, using molecular oxygen, addresses these by offering lower reaction temperatures and reduced coke formation. However, it has low propylene selectivity due to total oxidation at high conversion rates, highlighting the need for a selective catalyst \[10.1016/j.jcat.2015.12.015\].

                    Propylene demand exceeds conventional production methods, leading to interest in propane dehydrogenation (PDH). Direct dehydrogenation is limited by low yields and high temperatures, promoting side reactions and requiring catalyst regeneration. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) is exothermic and not thermodynamically limited, but struggles with propylene selectivity due to over-oxidation. Carbon dioxide (CO2), a soft oxidant, enhances PDH by shifting equilibrium and directly oxidizing propane, while also removing coke \[10.1080/00986445.2015.1017638\]. However, PDH with CO2 faces catalyst deactivation from coke and Cr reduction.

                    Propylene production's challenges include high energy consumption, catalyst regeneration, and thermodynamic constraints. ODHP mitigates these by reducing energy needs, eliminating catalyst regeneration, and overcoming thermodynamic limits. Oxygen use in ODHP can cause flammability and poor selectivity due to over-oxidation. Carbon dioxide, a safer oxidant, addresses these issues, enhancing process safety and selectivity \[10.1007/s10562-017-2282-3\].

                    Growing demand for propylene, particularly in Western Europe, exceeds production by conventional methods like steam cracking and FCC, which are constrained by thermodynamics and catalyst deactivation. ODHP presents a direct, exothermal route to propylene, enhancing energy efficiency. However, using oxygen as an oxidant in ODHP increases energy losses and fixed costs, with CO2 production posing environmental and economic challenges \[10.1016/j.cattod.2007.05.009\].

                    Current propylene production methods are energy-intensive and emit greenhouse gases. ODHP offers a cleaner, more energy-efficient route. Oxygen boosts propylene yields but risks over-oxidation to CO2 and requires costly separation. N2O enhances propene selectivity, reducing over-oxidation risk, though it may lower activity and has higher costs. Oxidant choice significantly affects the reaction pathway, product selectivity, and catalyst stability \[10.1016/j.jcat.2010.06.010\].

                    Propylene production is constrained by equilibrium limitations, which ODHP seeks to overcome. Using SO2 as an oxidant in ODHP enhances selectivity per pass at high temperatures, an advantage over conventional methods. However, adding SO2 increases propane conversion but decreases propylene selectivities compared to pure propane feed \[10.1016/0021-9517(77)90228-7\].

                    Rising propylene demand outpaces production, necessitating efficient methods. Direct dehydrogenation of propane (DDP) is energy-intensive. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) using CO2 as a mild oxidant mitigates this by reducing operating temperatures and increasing propane conversion by consuming H2. Unlike molecular oxygen, CO2 prevents over-oxidation, minimizing carbon oxide production \[10.1038/s41467-018-03793-w\].

                    Propylene production via propane dehydrogenation faces challenges including side reactions, thermodynamic constraints, high energy demands, and catalytic deactivation. ODHP, by introducing an oxidant, aims to mitigate these issues. However, using oxygen as an oxidant risks overoxidation to CO and CO2, and reaction runaway. Catalysts, notably vanadium-based and mixed-metal oxides, are studied to enhance selectivity and conversion while controlling complete oxidation. Despite progress, current catalytic systems have yet to achieve yields comparable to industrial olefin production methods \[10.1021/jp410750c\].

                    Propylene production, traditionally costly and unsustainable, faces challenges with non-oxidative processing. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) offers higher energy efficiency and simpler processes, addressing these issues. However, ODHP's use of oxygen as an oxidant can lead to over-oxidation, limiting selectivity to olefins. Studies suggest using CO2 as a mild oxidant could mitigate this, potentially turning the process exothermic and reducing catalyst coking, as seen in propane and iso-C4H10 ODH experiments \[10.1039/C5CY00998G\].
