Propylene production is currently marred by demand-supply mismatches and the thermodynamic constraints of dehydrogenation, leading to catalyst deactivation \[10.1016/j.cattod.2007.05.009\]. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) directly produces propylene with improved energy efficiency due to its exothermal nature \[10.1016/j.cattod.2007.05.009\]. However, ODHP's use of oxygen results in higher energy losses and fixed costs, with CO2 production adding environmental and economic concerns \[10.1016/j.cattod.2007.05.009\]. Current propylene production methods are energy-intensive, emit greenhouse gases, and suffer from co-product dilution. ODHP offers a cleaner, more direct route, with oxygen boosting propylene yields but risking deep oxidation and requiring costly oxygen separation \[10.1016/j.jcat.2010.06.010\]. The oxidant choice is pivotal, affecting reaction pathway, product selectivity, and catalyst stability \[10.1016/j.jcat.2010.06.010\].
                    
                    Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: Considering the advancements and findings discussed in the file, there lies an opportunity to explore emerging fields and innovative methodologies. Future research endeavors might focus on the development of novel catalysts that can suppress over-oxidation while enhancing propylene selectivity. The exploration of alternative oxidants, such as nitrous oxide (N2O) and carbon dioxide (CO2), presents a promising direction for mitigating the challenges associated with oxygen use. Additionally, the design of advanced reactor systems that can precisely control reaction conditions and optimize the use of oxidants could significantly enhance the efficiency and selectivity of ODHP processes. The integration of ODHP with other chemical processes, such as CO2 utilization and hydrogen production, could also offer synergistic benefits and further improve the overall sustainability of propylene production.

The escalating demand for propylene, particularly in Western Europe, and the constraints of current production methods, such as coking and thermodynamic limitations, underscore the necessity for alternative approaches [\[10.1016/j.cattod.2007.05.009\]]. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP), an exothermal process, presents an improved energy efficiency over endothermal dehydrogenation. However, the use of oxygen as an oxidant in ODHP can escalate energy losses and fixed costs due to CO2 production [\[10.1016/j.cattod.2007.05.009\]]. Current propylene production methods are energy-intensive and emit greenhouse gases, whereas ODHP offers a cleaner, more efficient route with higher yields [\[10.1016/j.jcat.2010.06.010\]]. Oxygen boosts ODHP yields but risks deep oxidation and necessitates costly separation [\[10.1016/j.jcat.2010.06.010\]]. Propylene production's equilibrium limitations are addressed by ODHP, which uses SO2 as an oxidant to enhance selectivity and propane conversion at high temperatures [\[10.1016/0021-9517(77)90228-7\]]. Rising propylene demand outpaces current production, necessitating efficient methods. DDP's limitations, including high temperatures for significant yields, are mitigated by ODHP. Using CO2 as a mild oxidant in ODHP reduces operating temperatures by oxidizing hydrogen and releasing heat, enhancing propane conversion by consuming H2 [\[10.1038/s41467-018-03793-w\]].
                    
                    Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: The exploration of ODHP as an alternative to current propylene production methods reveals its potential to address energy efficiency, environmental impact, and thermodynamic constraints. The use of CO2 as a mild oxidant in ODHP not only reduces energy consumption and emissions but also enhances the process's selectivity and efficiency. Future research endeavors might focus on developing catalysts that can further suppress over-oxidation and improve propylene selectivity, while also exploring the integration of ODHP with renewable energy sources to further reduce its carbon footprint. Additionally, the optimization of reactor designs and operating conditions could lead to more efficient and economically viable ODHP processes.
