Challenges in propylene production and the potential of oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) as an alternative method: advantages, limitations, and the role of oxidants [10.1016/j.cattod.2007.05.009]. Propylene production via steam cracking and dehydrogenation struggles to meet growing demand, especially in regions favoring ethylene [10.1016/j.cattod.2007.05.009]. Dehydrogenation's thermodynamic limits and coking issues hinder efficiency [10.1021/jp410750c]. ODHP, an exothermal process, enhances energy efficiency over endothermal methods [10.1016/j.cattod.2007.05.009]. However, using oxygen in ODHP boosts energy losses and fixed costs due to CO2 production, affecting economic and environmental aspects [10.1016/j.cattod.2007.05.009]. Catalyst performance, including activity and selectivity, is pivotal for the economic feasibility of alkane-based chemical processes [10.1021/jp410750c].
                    
                    Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: Considering the advancements and findings discussed in the file, there lies an opportunity to explore emerging fields and innovative methodologies. Future research endeavors might focus on developing catalysts with enhanced selectivity and activity, particularly in the context of ODHP using CO2 as an oxidant [10.1038/s41467-018-03793-w]. This could potentially mitigate the over-oxidation issues associated with oxygen use and offer a more sustainable and efficient route to propylene production. Additionally, the exploration of alternative oxidants, such as N2O, which improves propene selectivity and reduces catalyst deactivation [10.1016/j.jcat.2010.06.010], could provide new avenues for process optimization. The development of reactor designs that can better manage the exothermic nature of ODHP and prevent overheating is also a critical area for future investigation [10.1002/ente.201900622]. Moreover, the integration of ODHP with other processes, such as CO2 utilization and syngas production [10.1016/j.jcou.2019.09.018], could offer synergistic benefits and enhance the overall efficiency of propylene production. Lastly, the investigation of novel catalysts that can withstand the harsh conditions of ODHP and maintain high activity and selectivity over extended periods is essential for the commercial viability of this process [10.1021/cr5002436].

Propylene production, a cornerstone of the petrochemical industry, faces significant challenges due to growing demand and the limitations of current methods like steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) [\[10.1016/j.cattod.2007.05.009\]]. These traditional processes are energy-intensive, emit greenhouse gases, and are constrained by thermodynamic limitations and catalyst deactivation [\[10.1016/j.jcat.2010.06.010\]]. Dehydrogenation methods, while theoretically advantageous, are hindered by equilibrium constraints and coking issues [\[10.1016/0021-9517(77)90228-7\]]. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP), an emerging alternative, directly addresses these challenges by offering a more exothermal and energy-efficient process that aligns better with market needs [\[10.1016/j.cattod.2007.05.009\]]. However, the use of oxygen in ODHP increases energy losses and fixed costs due to CO2 production [\[10.1016/j.cattod.2007.05.009\]]. Despite this, ODHP presents a promising alternative for propylene production, offering improved energy efficiency and process simplicity [\[10.1016/j.cattod.2007.05.009\]].

                    The choice of oxidant in ODHP is pivotal, impacting reaction pathway, product selectivity, and catalyst stability [\[10.1016/j.jcat.2010.06.010\]]. Oxygen, though effective, risks deep oxidation to CO2, reducing propylene selectivity and posing safety hazards due to its reactivity [\[10.1134/S0023158418060010\]]. N2O as an oxidant enhances propene selectivity and mitigates deep oxidation, though it may lower activity and has higher costs [\[10.1016/j.jcat.2010.06.010\]]. The use of SO2 as an oxidant in ODHP enhances selectivity per pass at high temperatures, though it increases propane conversion at the expense of reduced propylene selectivity compared to pure propane feed [\[10.1016/0021-9517(77)90228-7\]]. CO2, as a mild oxidant, reduces operating temperatures by oxidizing hydrogen from propane and releasing heat, unlike molecular oxygen which promotes over-oxidation [\[10.1038/s41467-018-03793-w\]]. 

                    Catalysts, especially vanadium-based and mixed-metal oxides, improve selectivity and conversion while curbing overoxidation, though they haven't yet matched established methods' yields [\[10.1021/jp410750c\]]. Recent studies suggest using CO2 as a mild oxidant could mitigate over-oxidation, potentially making the process exothermic and improving catalyst performance [\[10.1039/C5CY00998G\]]. Despite promising yields, ODHP's results are below industrial interest, indicating a need for catalyst and reactor configuration advancements to maintain high selectivity under high conversion conditions [\[10.1039/C5CY00998G\]].

                    
                    Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: Considering the advancements and findings discussed, there lies an opportunity to explore emerging fields and innovative methodologies. Future research endeavors might focus on the development of novel catalysts that can enhance propylene selectivity while suppressing overoxidation. The use of CO2 as a mild oxidant in ODHP presents a promising direction, potentially turning the process exothermic and reducing catalyst coking. This approach could not only improve the efficiency of propylene production but also contribute to CO2 utilization and reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. Additionally, the design of advanced reactor configurations that can optimize the performance of these catalysts under high conversion conditions is crucial for the commercial viability of ODHP. The integration of process intensification techniques, such as membrane reactors or catalytic distillation, could further enhance the selectivity and efficiency of the ODHP process. Moreover, the exploration of alternative oxidants, beyond oxygen and CO2, that can offer higher selectivity and stability under ODHP conditions is a promising avenue for future research. The development of predictive models and computational tools to guide the design and optimization of ODHP processes could also significantly accelerate the discovery of new catalysts and process configurations. Overall, the future of propylene production through ODHP is bright, with the potential for significant advancements in catalyst design, reactor engineering, and process intensification.
