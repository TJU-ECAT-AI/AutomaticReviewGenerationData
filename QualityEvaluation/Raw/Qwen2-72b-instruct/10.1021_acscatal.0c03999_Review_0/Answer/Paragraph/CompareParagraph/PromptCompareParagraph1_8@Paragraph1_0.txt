Challenges in propylene production, such as high energy consumption and low selectivity, are addressed by oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP), offering a more energy-efficient and selective process \[10.1021/acs.chemrev.6b00551\]. However, using oxygen as an oxidant in ODHP can cause overoxidation, necessitating precise temperature control to prevent catalyst deactivation and coke formation \[10.1021/acs.chemrev.6b00551\]. Oxygen's abundance and low cost are advantageous, but its use requires careful management. Suitable catalysts and reactor designs are critical for ODHP's success \[10.1021/acs.chemrev.6b00551\].

                    ODHP presents an exothermal, direct route to propylene, improving energy efficiency over endothermal dehydrogenation \[10.1016/j.cattod.2007.05.009\]. However, using oxygen in ODHP increases energy losses and fixed costs due to CO2 production \[10.1016/j.cattod.2007.05.009\]. Catalyst performance and innovative process designs are crucial for ODHP's commercial success \[10.1016/j.cattod.2007.05.009\].

                    ODHP offers a cleaner, more efficient alternative to current propylene production methods, which are energy-intensive and emit greenhouse gases \[10.1016/j.jcat.2010.06.010\]. Oxygen boosts propylene yields but risks deep oxidation and requires costly oxygen separation \[10.1016/j.jcat.2010.06.010\]. Nitrous oxide (N2O) enhances propene selectivity and reduces deep oxidation risk, albeit with lower activity and higher costs \[10.1016/j.jcat.2010.06.010\]. The oxidant choice significantly impacts the reaction pathway, product selectivity, and catalyst stability \[10.1016/j.jcat.2010.06.010\].

                    
                    Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: The challenges in propylene production, including high energy consumption, low selectivity, and environmental concerns, highlight the potential of ODHP as an alternative method. ODHP's exothermal nature and improved energy efficiency offer a promising route to propylene production. However, the use of oxygen as an oxidant presents limitations, including overoxidation and increased costs due to CO2 production. The choice of oxidant is critical, with N2O offering enhanced selectivity but at higher costs. Future research should focus on developing catalysts that can suppress overoxidation and improve selectivity, as well as exploring alternative oxidants that offer higher efficiency and lower environmental impact. Innovative reactor designs and process optimization are also essential for ODHP's commercial success.

The escalating demand for propylene, particularly in Western Europe, and the limitations of current production methods like steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking (FCC), which are constrained by thermodynamics and catalyst deactivation, underscore the need for innovative technologies\[10.1016/j.cattod.2007.05.009\]. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) presents an exothermal, energy-efficient alternative to endothermal dehydrogenation, addressing the challenges of current methods\[10.1016/j.cattod.2007.05.009\]. However, using oxygen as an oxidant in ODHP increases energy losses and fixed costs due to CO2 production\[10.1016/j.cattod.2007.05.009\]. The effectiveness of the catalyst is crucial for economic viability, and successful technologies will integrate innovative process designs with catalyst performance\[10.1016/j.cattod.2007.05.009\].

                    Current propylene production faces high energy consumption, greenhouse gas emissions, and co-product dilution\[10.1016/j.jcat.2010.06.010\]. ODHP offers a cleaner, more energy-efficient route\[10.1016/j.jcat.2010.06.010\]. Oxygen boosts propylene yields but risks deep oxidation and requires energy-intensive separation\[10.1016/j.jcat.2010.06.010\]. N2O improves propene selectivity, reducing deep oxidation risk, though it may lower activity and has higher costs and environmental concerns\[10.1016/j.jcat.2010.06.010\]. The oxidant choice significantly impacts reaction pathway, product selectivity, and catalyst stability\[10.1016/j.jcat.2010.06.010\].

                    Propylene production faces challenges including side reactions, thermodynamic constraints, high energy needs, and catalytic deactivation due to coke\[10.1021/jp410750c\]. ODHP, using an oxidant, addresses these by potentially avoiding endothermic issues and coke formation\[10.1021/jp410750c\]. However, oxygen as an oxidant risks overoxidation to CO and CO2 and reaction instability\[10.1021/jp410750c\]. Catalysts, particularly vanadium-based and mixed-metal oxides, are explored to control oxidation and enhance ODHP efficiency\[10.1021/jp410750c\], though none have achieved yields comparable to current industrial methods\[10.1021/jp410750c\].

                    Propylene production, critical for various chemicals, faces high costs and sustainability issues with current non-oxidative methods\[10.1039/C5CY00998G\]. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) offers higher energy efficiency and process simplicity, addressing these challenges\[10.1039/C5CY00998G\]. However, ODHP's use of oxygen can lead to over-oxidation, limiting selectivity to olefins\[10.1039/C5CY00998G\]. The use of CO2 as a mild oxidant is proposed to mitigate this issue, potentially turning the process exothermic and reducing catalyst coking\[10.1039/C5CY00998G\].
                    
                    Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: Considering the advancements and findings discussed in the file, there lies an opportunity to explore emerging fields and innovative methodologies. Future research endeavors might focus on the development of novel catalysts that can enhance the selectivity and efficiency of ODHP while minimizing over-oxidation. The exploration of alternative oxidants, such as CO2, offers a promising direction for mitigating the environmental impact and improving the economic viability of propylene production. Additionally, the integration of ODHP with other processes, such as CO2 capture and utilization, could lead to a more sustainable and efficient production method. The optimization of reactor designs and process conditions to better control the exothermic nature of ODHP and prevent overheating is also a critical area for future investigation. Lastly, the development of advanced monitoring and control systems could enhance the safety and reliability of ODHP processes, particularly in managing the risks associated with oxygen use.
