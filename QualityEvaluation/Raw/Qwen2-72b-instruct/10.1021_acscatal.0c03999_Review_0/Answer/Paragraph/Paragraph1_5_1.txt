                    Challenges in propylene production and the potential of oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) as an alternative method: advantages, limitations, and the role of oxidants. Propylene production via steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) [10.1016/j.cattod.2007.05.009] faces growing demand and thermodynamic constraints, leading to rapid catalyst deactivation. ODHP directly produces propylene from propane, offering improved energy efficiency as an exothermal process [10.1016/j.cattod.2007.05.009]. However, using oxygen in ODHP increases energy losses and fixed costs due to CO2 production [10.1016/j.cattod.2007.05.009]. New technologies focusing on catalyst performance and innovative designs are needed to address these issues [10.1016/j.cattod.2007.05.009].

                    Propylene production by steam cracking and FCC is energy-intensive, emits greenhouse gases, and produces diluting co-products [10.1016/j.jcat.2010.06.010]. ODHP offers a more direct, energy-efficient, and cleaner route [10.1016/j.jcat.2010.06.010]. Oxygen boosts propylene yields but risks deep oxidation and requires energy-intensive separation [10.1016/j.jcat.2010.06.010]. N2O improves propene selectivity and reduces deep oxidation risk, albeit with lower activity and higher costs [10.1016/j.jcat.2010.06.010]. Oxidant choice is critical, affecting reaction pathway, product selectivity, and catalyst stability [10.1016/j.jcat.2010.06.010].

                    Propylene production is constrained by equilibrium limitations [10.1016/0021-9517(77)90228-7]. ODHP seeks to overcome these constraints. Using SO2 as an oxidant in ODHP boosts selectivity per pass at high temperatures [10.1016/0021-9517(77)90228-7], offering an advantage over traditional methods [10.1016/0021-9517(77)90228-7]. However, SO2 increases propane conversion at the expense of lower propylene selectivity compared to pure propane feed [10.1016/0021-9517(77)90228-7], illustrating a key limitation [10.1016/0021-9517(77)90228-7].

                    Rising propylene demand outpaces production [10.1038/s41467-018-03793-w]. DDP's thermal constraints require high temperatures for significant yields [10.1038/s41467-018-03793-w]. ODHP, using CO2 as a mild oxidant, lowers operating temperatures by oxidizing hydrogen and releasing heat [10.1038/s41467-018-03793-w]. CO2 boosts propane conversion by consuming H2 and prevents over-oxidation [10.1038/s41467-018-03793-w], reducing carbon oxide production compared to molecular oxygen [10.1038/s41467-018-03793-w].

                    Propylene production via propane dehydrogenation encounters challenges like side reactions, thermodynamic constraints, high energy needs, and catalyst deactivation [10.1021/jp410750c]. ODHP, using an oxidant, addresses some issues but introduces overoxidation and reaction instability [10.1021/jp410750c]. Catalysts, particularly vanadium-based oxides, improve selectivity and conversion [10.1021/jp410750c], facilitating controlled reactions in ODHP [10.1021/jp410750c].

                    Propylene production faces challenges due to high costs and sustainability issues with current non-oxidative methods [10.1039/C5CY00998G]. ODHP offers higher energy efficiency and process simplicity, addressing these challenges [10.1039/C5CY00998G]. However, ODHP's use of oxygen as an oxidant can lead to over-oxidation, limiting selectivity to olefins [10.1039/C5CY00998G]. The use of CO2 as a mild oxidant is proposed to mitigate this issue [10.1039/C5CY00998G], potentially turning the process exothermic and benefiting catalyst coking [10.1039/C5CY00998G].

                    Current propylene production methods are energy-intensive and complex, with by-product formation [10.1134/S0023158418060010]. ODHP offers a more direct and energy-efficient route [10.1134/S0023158418060010]. However, using oxygen can lead to deep oxidation, reducing selectivity and posing safety risks [10.1134/S0023158418060010]. Oxygen separation from air increases costs [10.1134/S0023158418060010], and precise dosing is required to prevent over-oxidation [10.1134/S0023158418060010].

                    Propylene production faces a supply-demand gap due to shale gas's low-cost ethene [10.1126/science.aaf7885]. ODHP offers an alternative, leveraging exothermic reactions at lower temperatures and enhanced catalyst stability to address this gap [10.1126/science.aaf7885]. A key challenge is preventing propene's over-oxidation to CO and CO2 [10.1126/science.aaf7885], which threatens the efficiency of the ODHP process [10.1126/science.aaf7885].

                    Propylene production via steam cracking is energy-intensive and reliant on depleting oil reserves [10.1021/acs.chemrev.6b00551]. ODHP offers a more efficient process with higher propylene selectivity [10.1021/acs.chemrev.6b00551]. However, it faces challenges with oxidant selection, notably oxygen, which can lead to overoxidation and temperature control issues [10.1021/acs.chemrev.6b00551], affecting propylene yield and catalyst stability [10.1021/acs.chemrev.6b00551]. Suitable catalysts and reactor designs are crucial to overcome these limitations [10.1021/acs.chemrev.6b00551].

                    Current propylene production struggles with high energy consumption, coke formation, and high temperatures [10.1080/17415990412331327909]. ODHP addresses these by operating at lower temperatures and minimizing coke [10.1080/17415990412331327909]. Oxygen, a preferred oxidant, enhances propene selectivity but risks over-oxidation [10.1080/17415990412331327909], limiting yields [10.1080/17415990412331327909]. Its use requires careful control to prevent explosive mixtures [10.1080/17415990412331327909] and manage the exothermic reaction [10.1080/17415990412331327909]. H2S in the feed enhances propylene selectivity by altering the reaction pathway and suppressing over-oxidation [10.1080/17415990412331327909]. Despite oxygen's benefits, increased conversion leads to selectivity losses [10.1080/17415990412331327909].

                    Current propylene production via SC and FCC faces low selectivity and yields, exacerbated by ethane preference and rising demand [10.1002/cctc.201200913]. Propane dehydrogenation, though theoretically advantageous, is hindered by thermodynamics, requiring high temperatures and complicating product separation [10.1002/cctc.201200913]. ODHP could enhance yields but is limited to around 30% due to further propylene oxidation [10.1002/cctc.201200913]. Oxidant selection is critical: F2 is unsuitable due to reactivity and thermodynamics [10.1002/cctc.201200913], Cl2 lacks selectivity [10.1002/cctc.201200913], I2 is slow and favorable only at high temperatures [10.1002/cctc.201200913], and bromine, though more feasible, still faces polyhalogenation selectivity issues [10.1002/cctc.201200913].

                    Current propylene production methods are energy-intensive and centralized, limiting their use in remote areas [10.1002/ente.201900622]. ODHP offers a decentralized, more energy-efficient alternative [10.1002/ente.201900622]. However, it faces challenges, especially with oxidant selection [10.1002/ente.201900622]; oxygen use can lead to side reactions [10.1002/ente.201900622], impacting propylene yield [10.1002/ente.201900622]. Efficient catalysts are crucial to manage the exothermic reaction and prevent overheating [10.1002/ente.201900622].

                    Growing propene demand highlights the appeal of propane dehydrogenation, particularly ODHP [10.1016/j.jcou.2019.09.018]. This method offers higher conversion and yield [10.1016/j.jcou.2019.09.018], acting as a CO2 utilisation method [10.1016/j.jcou.2019.09.018]. However, using oxygen as an oxidant in ODHP presents unique challenges [10.1016/j.jcou.2019.09.018], emphasizing the need for further research [10.1016/j.jcou.2019.09.018].

                    Propylene production struggles with achieving high propane conversion and selectivity, exacerbated by propylene's higher reactivity and propane cracking at temperatures above 700 C [10.1016/S0926-860X(01)00816-X]. ODHP aims to address these issues but struggles to combine high conversion with selectivity [10.1016/S0926-860X(01)00816-X], hindering its commercial potential [10.1016/S0926-860X(01)00816-X]. Oxidant selection, particularly using oxygen, introduces safety concerns [10.1016/S0926-860X(01)00816-X].

                    Current propylene production methods are energy-intensive, costly, and environmentally problematic due to greenhouse gas emissions [10.1039/c2ee22409g]. ODHP offers a more energy-efficient and cost-effective solution, with CO2 as an oxidant reducing emissions and enabling selective dehydrogenation [10.1039/c2ee22409g]. However, using oxygen in ODHP can cause over-oxidation, affecting propylene selectivity [10.1039/c2ee22409g]. The oxidant choice is critical for propylene yield and selectivity in ODHP [10.1039/c2ee22409g].

                    Propylene production faces challenges including a supply deficit due to high demand [10.1021/acscatal.0c03999_0]. Current methods like dehydrogenation have drawbacks: thermodynamic limits requiring high energy and catalyst deactivation from coke formation [10.1021/acscatal.0c03999_0]. ODHP is advantageous due to its exothermic nature, eliminating thermodynamic constraints at lower temperatures [10.1021/acscatal.0c03999_0]. However, using oxygen as an oxidant in ODHP can cause overoxidation to carbon oxides [10.1021/acscatal.0c03999_0], leading to inefficient reactant use and low process selectivity [10.1021/acscatal.0c03999_0].
