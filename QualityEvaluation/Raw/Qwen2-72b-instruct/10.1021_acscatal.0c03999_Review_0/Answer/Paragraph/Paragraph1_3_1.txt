                    The escalating demand for propylene has exposed the limitations of traditional production methods, such as steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) \[10.1016/j.cattod.2007.05.009\]. These processes are energy-intensive and often favor the production of ethylene over propylene, leading to a supply-demand gap. Dehydrogenation methods, while theoretically promising, are hindered by thermodynamic constraints and coking issues \[10.1016/j.cattod.2007.05.009\]. In this context, oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) emerges as a viable alternative, offering a more exothermal and energy-efficient process that aligns better with market needs \[10.1016/j.cattod.2007.05.009\]. However, the use of oxygen in ODHP increases energy losses and fixed costs due to CO2 production \[10.1016/j.cattod.2007.05.009\].

                    Current propylene production methods, including steam cracking, are energy-intensive and emit greenhouse gases \[10.1016/j.jcat.2010.06.010\]. ODHP offers a cleaner, more direct route to propylene production by directly converting propane to propylene. Oxygen as an oxidant in ODHP increases propylene yields but risks deep oxidation to CO2 and requires costly oxygen separation \[10.1016/j.jcat.2010.06.010\]. N2O as an oxidant enhances propene selectivity and mitigates deep oxidation, though it may reduce activity and has higher production costs \[10.1016/j.jcat.2010.06.010\]. The choice of oxidant is pivotal, impacting reaction pathway, product selectivity, and catalyst stability \[10.1016/j.jcat.2010.06.010\].

                    Propylene production faces equilibrium limitations in dehydrogenation reactions \[10.1016/0021-9517(77)90228-7\]. ODHP, notably with SO2 as an oxidant, offers an alternative by enhancing selectivity at high temperatures. However, adding SO2 increases propane conversion at the cost of reduced propylene selectivity compared to a pure propane feed \[10.1016/0021-9517(77)90228-7\].

                    Rising propylene demand outpaces current production methods \[10.1038/s41467-018-03793-w\]. Direct dehydrogenation of propane (DDP) is limited by high energy requirements. ODHP using CO2 as a mild oxidant reduces operating temperatures by oxidizing hydrogen from propane, releasing heat, and boosting propane conversion by consuming H2 \[10.1038/s41467-018-03793-w\]. CO2 in ODHP prevents over-oxidation, minimizing carbon oxide production, unlike oxidative dehydrogenation with molecular oxygen \[10.1038/s41467-018-03793-w\].

                    Propylene production from propane dehydrogenation encounters issues like side reactions, thermodynamic constraints, high energy demands, and catalytic deactivation \[10.1021/jp410750c\]. ODHP, using an oxidant to initiate reactions, aims to mitigate these issues but introduces risks of overoxidation and reaction instability \[10.1021/jp410750c\]. Catalysts, notably vanadium-based and mixed-metal oxides, improve selectivity and conversion while controlling complete oxidation \[10.1021/jp410750c\].

                    Propylene production, traditionally using non-oxidative processing of petroleum, faces sustainability and cost challenges \[10.1039/C5CY00998G\]. ODHP offers higher energy efficiency and process simplicity, addressing these issues. However, using oxygen as an oxidant in ODHP can lead to over-oxidation, limiting selectivity to olefins \[10.1039/C5CY00998G\]. Recent studies suggest using CO2 as a mild oxidant could mitigate this issue, potentially making the process exothermic and improving catalyst coking \[10.1039/C5CY00998G\].

                    Propylene production methods are energy-intensive and complex \[10.1134/S0023158418060010\]. ODHP offers a more efficient alternative but faces challenges, notably in oxidant selection. Oxygen, while effective, risks deep oxidation, reducing propylene selectivity and posing safety hazards due to its reactivity \[10.1134/S0023158418060010\]. Oxygen's use requires diluents, careful control to prevent runaway reactions, and increased costs from air separation, necessitating precise dosing to avoid over-oxidation \[10.1134/S0023158418060010\].

                    Propylene production faces a supply-demand gap due to shale gas increasing low-cost ethene \[10.1126/science.aaf7885\]. ODHP offers an alternative, leveraging exothermic reactions at lower temperatures and enhanced catalyst stability \[10.1126/science.aaf7885\]. However, it must overcome the challenge of over-oxidizing propene to CO and CO2 \[10.1126/science.aaf7885\].

                    Current propylene production methods are energy-intensive and complex \[10.1021/acs.chemrev.6b00551\]. ODHP offers a more efficient route but faces limitations, notably in oxidant selection. Oxygen, though effective, risks deep oxidation, reducing propylene selectivity and posing safety and process concerns \[10.1021/acs.chemrev.6b00551\]. Oxygen complicates temperature control, potentially reducing propylene yield and deactivating catalysts \[10.1021/acs.chemrev.6b00551\].

                    Current propylene production methods are energy-intensive, prone to coke formation, and require high temperatures \[10.1080/17415990412331327909\]. ODHP addresses these by operating at lower temperatures and reducing coke. Oxygen, a preferred ODHP oxidant, boosts propene selectivity but risks over-oxidation to carbon oxides, limiting yields \[10.1080/17415990412331327909\]. H2S in the feed enhances propylene selectivity by modifying the reaction pathway \[10.1080/17415990412331327909\]. Oxygen's use requires careful control to prevent explosive mixtures and manage the exothermic reaction, impacting propene yields \[10.1080/17415990412331327909\].

                    Current propylene production via steam cracking and fluidic catalytic cracking faces low selectivity and yields, exacerbated by the shift to ethane use \[10.1002/cctc.201200913\]. Propane dehydrogenation, while theoretically advantageous, is constrained by thermodynamics, requiring high temperatures that complicate product separation \[10.1002/cctc.201200913\]. ODHP can enhance propylene yields but is limited to around 30% due to propylene's oxidation to oxygenated products \[10.1002/cctc.201200913\]. Oxidant selection is pivotal: F2 is unsuitable due to high reactivity and unfavorable thermodynamics; Cl2 reactions are non-selective and potentially explosive; I2 reactions are selective but slow and only favorable at high temperatures; bromine reactions, though more feasible, necessitate a high propane-to-bromine ratio to prevent polyhalogenation, limiting single-pass conversion \[10.1002/cctc.201200913\].

                    Current propylene production methods are energy-intensive and centralized, limiting their use in remote areas \[10.1002/ente.201900622\]. ODHP offers a more energy-efficient and decentralized alternative. However, using oxygen as an oxidant in ODHP can lead to side reactions, affecting propylene yield and selectivity \[10.1002/ente.201900622\]. Efficient catalysts are needed to activate propane under mild conditions while suppressing over-oxidation \[10.1002/ente.201900622\].

                    Growing propene demand strains current production methods, potentially affecting co-product yields \[10.1016/j.jcou.2019.09.018\]. ODHP offers higher propane conversion and propene yield, addressing CO2 utilisation. However, using oxygen as an oxidant in ODHP presents specific, less-documented challenges \[10.1016/j.jcou.2019.09.018\].

                    Propylene production struggles with achieving high propane conversion and selectivity due to propylene's higher oxidation susceptibility \[10.1016/S0926-860X(01)00816-X\]. At temperatures above 700 degrees Celsius, propane cracking becomes significant, leading to various by-products \[10.1016/S0926-860X(01)00816-X\]. ODHP, while offering potential improvements, must overcome challenges in maintaining selectivity and managing propane cracking \[10.1016/S0926-860X(01)00816-X\]. Oxygen selection as an oxidant raises safety concerns, hindering propane oxydehydrogenation's commercial potential \[10.1016/S0926-860X(01)00816-X\].

                    Propylene production via steam cracking is costly, energy-intensive, and yields are reduced by byproducts \[10.1039/c2ee22409g\]. ODHP presents as a more efficient, selective, and cost-effective alternative with lower emissions. Selecting CO2 as an oxidant in ODHP enhances energy savings and selectivity, unlike oxygen, which risks over-oxidation, thus decreasing propylene yield \[10.1039/c2ee22409g\]. Oxidant choice is critical for propylene selectivity and yield in ODHP processes \[10.1039/c2ee22409g\].

                    Propylene production faces challenges including supply deficits due to high demand, thermodynamic limits in propane conversion, and catalyst deactivation from coke formation \[10.1021/acscatal.0c03999_0\]. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP), an exothermic process, overcomes thermodynamic constraints at lower temperatures, making it an attractive alternative. However, using oxygen as an oxidant in ODHP can lead to overoxidation to carbon oxides, causing inefficient reactant use and low process selectivity \[10.1021/acscatal.0c03999_0\].

                    Current propylene production faces challenges including high energy consumption, low selectivity, and reliance on dwindling oil reserves \[10.1021/cr5002436\]. ODHP presents a cost-effective propane feedstock and efficient conversion, yet struggles with oxidant selection. Oxygen, while lowering reaction temperatures and making the process exothermic, risks over-oxidation and side reactions, affecting olefin selectivity \[10.1021/cr5002436\]. CO2, as a milder oxidant, boosts catalyst activity without over-oxidation risks but may lead to additional coke deposition and competitive adsorption, impacting catalyst performance \[10.1021/cr5002436\].

                    Propylene production faces challenges including high temperatures, costly catalysts, and catalyst deactivation \[10.1039/D0CY00586J\]. ODHP could lower temperatures due to its exothermic nature, but controlling propylene selectivity is tricky due to overoxidation. Using CO2 as an oxidant in ODHP can prevent deep oxidation, reduce coke formation, and enhance propane conversion, offering a promising alternative to oxygen \[10.1039/D0CY00586J\].

                    Propylene production faces challenges like endothermic reactions, coke formation, and thermodynamic constraints \[10.1016/j.jcat.2015.12.015\]. ODHP offers lower reaction temperatures and reduced coke formation, addressing these issues. However, it has low propylene selectivity due to total oxidation at high conversion rates, highlighting the need for a selective catalyst \[10.1016/j.jcat.2015.12.015\].

                    Propylene demand outstrips supply from conventional methods, necessitating alternatives like PDH \[10.1080/00986445.2015.1017638\]. Direct dehydrogenation faces low yields and high temperatures, causing side reactions and coke formation. ODHP with oxygen is exothermic but struggles with propylene selectivity. CO2, as a soft oxidant in PDH, utilizes greenhouse gas, mitigates coke formation, and enhances propylene yield by shifting the PDH equilibrium \[10.1080/00986445.2015.1017638\]. Oxide catalysts, notably Cr and Ga, are active in PDH with CO2 but face rapid deactivation from coke and Cr reduction \[10.1080/00986445.2015.1017638\].

                    Propylene production's challenges include high energy consumption, catalyst regeneration, and thermodynamic constraints \[10.1007/s10562-017-2282-3\]. ODHP offers lower energy use, eliminates catalyst regeneration, and overcomes thermodynamic limits. Oxygen in ODHP can cause flammability and poor selectivity due to over-oxidation. Using CO2 as a soft oxidant provides a safer, milder solution, addressing these issues effectively \[10.1007/s10562-017-2282-3\].
