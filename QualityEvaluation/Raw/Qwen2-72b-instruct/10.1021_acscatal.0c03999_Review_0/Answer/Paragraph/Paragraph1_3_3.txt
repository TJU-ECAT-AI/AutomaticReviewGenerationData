                    The escalating demand for propylene, coupled with the limitations of traditional production methods like steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) [\[10.1016/j.cattod.2007.05.009\]], has prompted the exploration of alternative routes. Dehydrogenation methods, while thermodynamically constrained and prone to coking [\[10.1016/j.cattod.2007.05.009\]], have been augmented by oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP), which offers a more exothermal and energy-efficient process [\[10.1016/j.cattod.2007.05.009\]]. However, the use of oxygen in ODHP introduces energy losses and increased fixed costs due to CO2 production [\[10.1016/j.cattod.2007.05.009\]]. Despite this, ODHP presents a promising alternative for propylene production, offering improved energy efficiency and process simplicity [\[10.1016/j.cattod.2007.05.009\]].

                    Current propylene production methods, including steam cracking and FCC, are energy-intensive and emit greenhouse gases [\[10.1016/j.jcat.2010.06.010\]]. ODHP offers a cleaner, more direct route to propylene, with oxygen boosting propylene yields but risking deep oxidation to CO2 [\[10.1016/j.jcat.2010.06.010\]]. N2O as an oxidant enhances propene selectivity and mitigates deep oxidation, though it may reduce activity and has higher production costs [\[10.1016/j.jcat.2010.06.010\]]. The oxidant choice is pivotal, impacting reaction pathway, product selectivity, and catalyst stability [\[10.1016/j.jcat.2010.06.010\]].

                    Propylene production faces equilibrium limitations in dehydrogenation [\[10.1016/0021-9517(77)90228-7\]]. ODHP, notably with SO2 as an oxidant, enhances selectivity per pass at high temperatures [\[10.1016/0021-9517(77)90228-7\]]. However, adding SO2 increases propane conversion at the expense of reduced propylene selectivity compared to pure propane feed [\[10.1016/0021-9517(77)90228-7\]].

                    Rising propylene demand outpaces current production [\[10.1038/s41467-018-03793-w\]]. Direct dehydrogenation of propane (DDP) is limited by high temperatures for significant yields [\[10.1038/s41467-018-03793-w\]]. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) using CO2 as a mild oxidant reduces operating temperatures by oxidizing hydrogen from propane and releasing heat [\[10.1038/s41467-018-03793-w\]]. CO2 also boosts propane conversion by consuming H2 through the reverse water gas shift reaction [\[10.1038/s41467-018-03793-w\]].

                    Propylene production from propane dehydrogenation faces issues like side reactions, thermodynamic limits, high energy needs, and catalytic deactivation [\[10.1021/jp410750c\]]. ODHP, using an oxidant to initiate reactions, aims to mitigate these issues [\[10.1021/jp410750c\]]. However, oxygen as an oxidant poses risks of overoxidation and reaction instability [\[10.1021/jp410750c\]]. Catalysts, notably vanadium-based and mixed-metal oxides, improve selectivity and conversion while curbing overoxidation [\[10.1021/jp410750c\]].

                    Propylene production, traditionally using non-oxidative processing of petroleum, faces sustainability and cost challenges [\[10.1039/C5CY00998G\]]. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) offers higher energy efficiency and process simplicity, addressing these issues [\[10.1039/C5CY00998G\]]. However, ODHP's use of oxygen as an oxidant can lead to over-oxidation, limiting selectivity to olefins [\[10.1039/C5CY00998G\]]. Recent studies suggest using CO2 as a mild oxidant could mitigate this issue, potentially making the process exothermic and reducing catalyst coking [\[10.1039/C5CY00998G\]].

                    Current propylene production methods are energy-intensive and complex [\[10.1134/S0023158418060010\]]. ODHP offers a more efficient alternative but faces challenges, notably in oxidant selection [\[10.1134/S0023158418060010\]]. Oxygen, though effective, risks deep oxidation, reducing propylene selectivity and posing safety hazards due to its reactivity [\[10.1134/S0023158418060010\]]. Its use requires diluents, careful control to prevent runaway reactions, and increased costs from air separation [\[10.1134/S0023158418060010\]].

                    Propylene production faces a supply-demand gap due to shale gas increasing low-cost ethene [\[10.1126/science.aaf7885\]]. ODHP offers an alternative, leveraging exothermic reactions at lower temperatures and enhanced catalyst stability [\[10.1126/science.aaf7885\]]. However, it must overcome the challenge of over-oxidizing propene to CO and CO2 [\[10.1126/science.aaf7885\]].

                    Current propylene production methods are energy-intensive and complex [\[10.1021/acs.chemrev.6b00551\]]. ODHP offers a more efficient route but faces limitations, notably in oxidant selection [\[10.1021/acs.chemrev.6b00551\]]. Oxygen, though effective, risks overoxidation and temperature control issues, impacting catalyst stability [\[10.1021/acs.chemrev.6b00551\]].

                    Current propylene production methods are energy-intensive and prone to coke formation [\[10.1080/17415990412331327909\]]. ODHP operates at lower temperatures, reducing coke formation [\[10.1080/17415990412331327909\]]. Oxygen, a preferred ODHP oxidant, boosts propene selectivity but risks over-oxidation to carbon oxides, limiting alkene selectivities [\[10.1080/17415990412331327909\]]. H2S in the feed enhances propylene selectivity by modifying the reaction pathway [\[10.1080/17415990412331327909\]].

                    Current propylene production via steam cracking and fluidic catalytic cracking faces low selectivity and yields, exacerbated by ethane preference in steam crackers [\[10.1002/cctc.201200913\]]. Propane dehydrogenation, though theoretically advantageous, is thermodynamically limited, requiring high temperatures that complicate product separation [\[10.1002/cctc.201200913\]]. ODHP could enhance propylene yields but is capped at about 30% due to propylene's oxidation to oxygenated products [\[10.1002/cctc.201200913\]]. Oxidant selection is pivotal: F2 is unsuitable due to high reactivity and unfavorable thermodynamics; Cl2 reactions are non-selective and potentially explosive; I2 reactions are slow, favorable at high temperatures, but recycling efficiency limits industrial application; bromine offers more feasibility but necessitates a high propane-to-bromine ratio to prevent polyhalogenation [\[10.1002/cctc.201200913\]].

                    Current propylene production methods are energy-intensive and centralized, limiting their use in remote areas [\[10.1002/ente.201900622\]]. ODHP offers a more energy-efficient and decentralized alternative [\[10.1002/ente.201900622\]]. However, using oxygen as an oxidant in ODHP can lead to side reactions, affecting propylene yield and selectivity [\[10.1002/ente.201900622\]]. Efficient catalysts are needed to activate propane under mild conditions while suppressing over-oxidation [\[10.1002/ente.201900622\]].

                    Growing propene demand strains current production methods, potentially affecting co-product yields [\[10.1016/j.jcou.2019.09.018\]]. ODHP offers higher propane conversion and propene yield, addressing CO2 utilisation [\[10.1016/j.jcou.2019.09.018\]]. However, ODHP's use of oxygen as an oxidant presents specific challenges [\[10.1016/j.jcou.2019.09.018\]].

                    Propylene production struggles with achieving high propane conversion and selectivity due to propylene's higher reactivity and propane cracking at high temperatures [\[10.1016/S0926-860X(01)00816-X\]]. ODHP aims to address these issues but faces challenges in maintaining selectivity and avoiding propane cracking [\[10.1016/S0926-860X(01)00816-X\]]. Oxygen selection as an oxidant raises safety concerns, hindering propane oxydehydrogenation's commercial potential [\[10.1016/S0926-860X(01)00816-X\]].

                    Propylene production via steam cracking is costly, energy-intensive, and yields are reduced by byproducts [\[10.1039/c2ee22409g\]]. ODHP presents as a more efficient, selective, and cost-effective alternative with lower emissions [\[10.1039/c2ee22409g\]]. Selecting CO2 as an oxidant in ODHP enhances energy savings and selectivity, unlike oxygen, which risks over-oxidation, thus decreasing propylene yield [\[10.1039/c2ee22409g\]].

                    Propylene, a critical petrochemical feedstock, faces production challenges including supply deficits due to high demand [\[10.1021/acscatal.0c03999_0\]]. Current production methods, including steam cracking, fluid catalytic cracking, and direct dehydrogenation of propane, are constrained by thermodynamic limits and catalyst deactivation [\[10.1021/acscatal.0c03999_0\]]. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP), an exothermic process, overcomes these thermodynamic constraints at lower temperatures [\[10.1021/acscatal.0c03999_0\]]. However, using oxygen as an oxidant in ODHP can lead to overoxidation to carbon oxides, causing inefficient reactant use and low process selectivity [\[10.1021/acscatal.0c03999_0\]].

                    Current propylene production faces challenges including high energy consumption, low selectivity, and reliance on dwindling oil reserves [\[10.1021/cr5002436\]]. ODHP presents a cost-effective propane feedstock and potentially efficient conversion [\[10.1021/cr5002436\]]. However, it encounters limitations, notably in oxidant selection [\[10.1021/cr5002436\]]. Oxygen, while lowering reaction temperatures and making the process exothermic, risks over-oxidation and side reactions, affecting olefin selectivity [\[10.1021/cr5002436\]]. CO2, as a milder oxidant, boosts catalyst activity without over-oxidation risks but may lead to additional coke deposition and competitive adsorption, impacting catalyst performance [\[10.1021/cr5002436\]].

                    Propylene production faces challenges including high temperatures, costly catalysts, and catalyst deactivation [\[10.1039/D0CY00586J\]]. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP), an exothermic process, could mitigate high temperatures but risks overoxidation, decreasing propylene selectivity [\[10.1039/D0CY00586J\]]. Using CO2 as an oxidant in ODHP avoids deep oxidation, reduces coke formation, and enhances propane conversion [\[10.1039/D0CY00586J\]].

                    Rising propylene demand highlights issues with current production methods: endothermic reactions, coke formation, and thermodynamic constraints [\[10.1016/j.jcat.2015.12.015\]]. ODHP, using molecular oxygen, offers lower temperatures and reduced coke formation but faces low propylene selectivity due to total oxidation [\[10.1016/j.jcat.2015.12.015\]].

                    Propylene demand outstrips supply from conventional methods, necessitating alternatives like PDH [\[10.1080/00986445.2015.1017638\]]. Direct dehydrogenation faces low yields and high temperatures, leading to side reactions and coke formation [\[10.1080/00986445.2015.1017638\]]. ODHP with oxygen is exothermic but struggles with propylene selectivity [\[10.1080/00986445.2015.1017638\]]. CO2, as a soft oxidant in PDH,
