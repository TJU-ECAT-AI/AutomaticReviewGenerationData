                    Propylene production via traditional methods like steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) faces growing demand and thermodynamic constraints, leading to rapid catalyst deactivation \[10.1016/j.cattod.2007.05.009\]. ODHP directly produces propylene from propane, offering improved energy efficiency as an exothermal process, contrasting with the endothermal nature of dehydrogenation and cracking \[10.1016/j.cattod.2007.05.009\]. However, using oxygen in ODHP increases energy losses and fixed costs due to CO2 production \[10.1016/j.cattod.2007.05.009\]. New technologies focusing on catalyst performance and innovative designs are needed to address these issues, aiming to achieve yields comparable to current olefin production methods \[10.1016/j.cattod.2007.05.009\].

                    Oxygen boosts propylene yields but risks deep oxidation and requires energy-intensive separation \[10.1016/j.jcat.2010.06.010\]. N2O improves propene selectivity and reduces deep oxidation risk, albeit with lower activity and higher costs \[10.1016/j.jcat.2010.06.010\]. Oxidant choice is critical, affecting reaction pathway, product selectivity, and catalyst stability \[10.1016/j.jcat.2010.06.010\].

                    Propylene production is constrained by equilibrium limitations, which ODHP seeks to overcome \[10.1016/0021-9517(77)90228-7\]. Using SO2 as an oxidant in ODHP boosts selectivity per pass at high temperatures, offering an advantage over traditional methods \[10.1016/0021-9517(77)90228-7\]. However, SO2 increases propane conversion at the expense of lower propylene selectivity compared to pure propane feed \[10.1016/0021-9517(77)90228-7\].

                    Rising propylene demand outpaces production, necessitating efficient on-purpose methods \[10.1038/s41467-018-03793-w\]. DDP's thermal constraints require high temperatures for significant yields \[10.1038/s41467-018-03793.w\]. ODHP, using CO2 as a mild oxidant, lowers operating temperatures by oxidizing hydrogen and releasing heat \[10.1038/s41467-018-03793.w\]. CO2 boosts propane conversion by consuming H2 and prevents over-oxidation, reducing carbon oxide production compared to molecular oxygen \[10.1038/s41467-018-03793.w\].

                    Propylene production via propane dehydrogenation encounters challenges like side reactions, thermodynamic constraints, high energy needs, and catalyst deactivation \[10.1021/jp410750c\]. ODHP, using an oxidant, addresses some issues but introduces overoxidation and reaction instability, especially with oxygen \[10.1021/jp410750c\]. Catalysts, particularly vanadium-based oxides, improve selectivity and conversion, facilitating controlled reactions in ODHP \[10.1021/jp410750c\].

                    Propylene production faces challenges due to high costs and sustainability issues with current non-oxidative methods \[10.1039/C5CY00998G\]. ODHP offers higher energy efficiency and process simplicity, addressing these challenges \[10.1039/C5CY00998G\]. However, ODHP's use of oxygen as an oxidant can lead to over-oxidation, limiting selectivity to olefins \[10.1039/C5CY00998G\]. The use of CO2 as a mild oxidant is proposed to mitigate this issue, potentially turning the process exothermic and benefiting catalyst coking \[10.1039/C5CY00998G\].

                    Propylene production via steam cracking is energy-intensive and complex, with by-product formation \[10.1134/S0023158418060010\]. ODHP offers a more direct and energy-efficient route to propylene \[10.1134/S0023158418060010\]. However, using oxygen can lead to deep oxidation, reducing propylene selectivity and forming CO and CO2 \[10.1134/S0023158418060010\]. Oxygen's reactivity with hydrocarbons necessitates controlled conditions to prevent runaway reactions, and oxygen separation from air increases costs \[10.1134/S0023158418060010\]. Precise dosing is required to avoid over-oxidation \[10.1134/S0023158418060010\].

                    Propylene production faces a supply-demand gap due to shale gas's low-cost ethene \[10.1126/science.aaf7885\]. ODHP offers an alternative, leveraging exothermic reactions at lower temperatures and enhanced catalyst stability to address this gap \[10.1126/science.aaf7885\]. A key challenge is preventing propene's over-oxidation to CO and CO2 \[10.1126/science.aaf7885\].

                    Current propylene production methods are energy-intensive and have low selectivity, relying on diminishing petroleum reserves \[10.1021/acs.chemrev.6b00551\]. ODHP offers a more efficient and selective alternative \[10.1021/acs.chemrev.6b00551\]. However, it faces challenges with oxidant selection, notably oxygen, which can lead to overoxidation and temperature control issues, affecting propylene yield and catalyst stability \[10.1021/acs.chemrev.6b00551\]. Suitable catalysts and reactor designs are crucial to overcome these limitations \[10.1021/acs.chemrev.6b00551\].

                    Propylene production struggles with high energy consumption, coke formation, and high temperatures \[10.1080/17415990412331327909\]. ODHP addresses these by operating at lower temperatures and reducing coke \[10.1080/17415990412331327909\]. Oxygen, a preferred oxidant, enhances propene selectivity but risks over-oxidation and explosive mixtures \[10.1080/17415990412331327909\]. H2S in the feed enhances propylene selectivity by altering the reaction pathway and suppressing over-oxidation \[10.1080/17415990412331327909\]. Despite oxygen's benefits, increased conversion leads to selectivity losses \[10.1080/17415990412331327909\].

                    Current propylene production via SC and FCC faces low selectivity and yields, exacerbated by ethane preference and growing polypropylene demand \[10.1002/cctc.201200913\]. Propane dehydrogenation, though theoretically ideal, is hindered by thermodynamics, requiring high temperatures for conversion and complicating product separation \[10.1002/cctc.201200913\]. ODHP could enhance yields but is limited to around 30% due to further propylene oxidation \[10.1002/cctc.201200913\]. Oxidant selection is critical: F2 is unsuitable due to reactivity and thermodynamics, Cl2 lacks selectivity, I2 is slow and favorable only at high temperatures, and bromine, though more feasible, still faces polyhalogenation selectivity issues \[10.1002/cctc.201200913\].

                    Current propylene production methods are energy-intensive and centralized, limiting their use in remote areas \[10.1002/ente.201900622\]. ODHP offers a decentralized, more energy-efficient alternative \[10.1002/ente.201900622\]. However, it faces challenges, especially with oxidant selection; oxygen use can cause side reactions, affecting propylene yield \[10.1002/ente.201900622\]. Efficient catalysts are crucial to manage the exothermic reaction and prevent overheating \[10.1002/ente.201900622\].

                    Growing propene demand highlights the appeal of propane dehydrogenation, particularly ODHP, which offers higher conversion and yield, acting as a CO2 utilisation method \[10.1016/j.jcou.2019.09.018\]. However, using oxygen as an oxidant in ODHP presents unique challenges \[10.1016/j.jcou.2019.09.018\].

                    Propylene production struggles with achieving high propane conversion and selectivity, exacerbated by propylene's higher reactivity and propane cracking at temperatures above 700 C \[10.1016/S0926-860X(01)00816-X\]. ODHP aims to address these issues but faces similar challenges, especially with selectivity at higher conversion rates and increased propane cracking at high temperatures \[10.1016/S0926-860X(01)00816-X\]. Oxidant selection, notably oxygen use, impacts ODHP's commercial viability, posing safety concerns \[10.1016/S0926-860X(01)00816-X\].

                    Current propylene production methods are energy-intensive, costly, and environmentally problematic due to greenhouse gas emissions \[10.1039/c2ee22409g\]. ODHP offers a more energy-efficient and cost-effective solution, with CO2 as an oxidant reducing emissions and enabling selective dehydrogenation \[10.1039/c2ee22409g\]. However, using oxygen risks over-oxidation, affecting propylene selectivity \[10.1039/c2ee22409g\]. The oxidant choice is critical for propylene yield and selectivity in ODHP \[10.1039/c2ee22409g\].

                    Propylene production faces challenges including a supply deficit due to high demand, thermodynamic limits for propane conversion, and catalyst deactivation from coke formation \[10.1021/acscatal.0c03999_0\]. ODHP, an exothermic process, overcomes thermodynamic constraints at lower temperatures, making it an attractive alternative \[10.1021/acscatal.0c03999_0\]. However, using oxygen as an oxidant in ODHP can cause overoxidation to carbon oxides, leading to inefficient reactant use and low process selectivity \[10.1021/acscatal.0c03999_0\].

                    Current propylene production methods suffer from high energy use, low selectivity, dwindling reserves, and rising costs \[10.1021/cr5002436\]. ODHP presents an economical feedstock and potentially more efficient conversion \[10.1021/cr5002436\]. However, it faces limitations, notably in oxidant selection. Oxygen can lower reaction temperatures and make the process exothermic, but it risks overoxidation and side reactions, affecting olefin selectivity \[10.1021/cr5002436\]. CO2 is safer but provides insufficient heat and can increase coke deposition and competitive adsorption on catalyst surfaces, affecting performance \[10.1021/cr5002436\].

                    Propylene production faces challenges including high temperatures, costly catalysts, and catalyst deactivation due to coke \[10.1039/D0CY00586J\]. ODHP can mitigate high temperature requirements but struggles with controlling propylene selectivity due to overoxidation \[10.1039/D0CY00586J\]. Using CO2 as an oxidant in ODHP avoids deep oxidation, reduces coke formation, and enhances propane conversion, offering significant advantages over oxygen \[10.1039/D0CY00586J\].

                    Propylene production via steam cracking, FCC, and DH faces challenges: endothermic reactions, coke formation, and thermodynamic constraints \[10.1016/j.jcat.2015.12.015\]. ODHP, using oxygen, offers lower temperatures and reduced coke formation, addressing these issues \[10.1016/j.jcat.2015.12.015\]. However, it has low propylene selectivity due to total oxidation at high conversion rates, highlighting the need for a selective catalyst \[10.1016/j.jcat.2015.12.015\].
