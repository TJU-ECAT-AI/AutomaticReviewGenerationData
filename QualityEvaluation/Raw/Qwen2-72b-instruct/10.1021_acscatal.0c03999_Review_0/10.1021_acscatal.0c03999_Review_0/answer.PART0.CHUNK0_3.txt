[1] "Propylene is mainly produced by steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) of naphtha, light diesel, and other oil byproducts, as well as direct dehydrogenation of propane (DHP)."
[2] "the dehydrogenation process suffers from two inherent drawbacks: (i) the endothermicity-induced thermodynamic limit for C3H8 conversion that demands high-energy input and (ii) the rapid catalyst deactivation because of coke formation."
[3] "Alternatively, oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) is attractive because of its exothermicity, which makes it free from the thermodynamic restraint at lower temperatures."
[4] "the presence of O2 can cause overoxidation of olefins to carbon oxides (COx), resulting in the inefficient use of the reactant and low process selectivity."

1.The current methods of propylene production, including steam cracking, fluid catalytic cracking, and direct dehydrogenation of propane, have limitations. Direct dehydrogenation of propane is endothermic, requiring high energy input, and suffers from rapid catalyst deactivation due to coke formation. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane is advantageous because it is exothermic, making it free from thermodynamic constraints at lower temperatures. However, the use of oxygen as an oxidant can lead to overoxidation of olefins to carbon oxides, resulting in inefficient use of reactants and low process selectivity.

1.当前丙烯生产方法，包括蒸汽裂解、流化催化裂化和丙烷直接脱氢，存在局限性。丙烷直接脱氢是吸热的，需要高能量输入，并且由于焦炭形成导致催化剂快速失活。丙烷氧化脱氢具有优势，因为它是放热的，使其在较低温度下不受热力学限制。然而，使用氧气作为氧化剂会导致烯烃过度氧化为二氧化碳，导致反应物使用效率低下和过程选择性低。
