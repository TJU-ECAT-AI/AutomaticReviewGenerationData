          The current methods of propylene production, such as steam cracking, fluid catalytic cracking, and direct dehydrogenation of propane, face challenges including a supply deficit due to high market demand, endothermicity-induced thermodynamic limits for propane conversion, and rapid catalyst deactivation due to coke formation. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) is advantageous because it is exothermic, which eliminates thermodynamic constraints at lower temperatures. However, the use of oxygen as an oxidant in ODHP can lead to overoxidation of olefins to carbon oxides, resulting in inefficient reactant use and low process selectivity.

          当前丙烯生产方法，如蒸汽裂解、流化催化裂化和丙烷直接脱氢，面临供应短缺的挑战，这是由于市场对丙烯衍生物的高需求，以及丙烷转化的热力学限制和催化剂因焦炭形成而迅速失活。丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）具有优势，因为它是放热的，这消除了在较低温度下的热力学限制。然而，使用氧气作为ODHP的氧化剂会导致烯烃过度氧化为碳氧化物，导致反应物使用效率低下和过程选择性低。
