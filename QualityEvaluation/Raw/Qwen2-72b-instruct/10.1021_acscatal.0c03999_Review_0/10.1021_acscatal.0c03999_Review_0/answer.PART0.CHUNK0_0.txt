[1] "At present, propylene is mainly produced by steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) of naphtha, light diesel, and other oil byproducts, as well as direct dehydrogenation of propane (DHP)."
[2] "Yet, the dehydrogenation process suffers from two inherent drawbacks: (i) the endothermicity-induced thermodynamic limit for C3H8 conversion that demands high-energy input and (ii) the rapid catalyst deactivation because of coke formation."
[3] "Alternatively, oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) is attractive because of its exothermicity, which makes it free from the thermodynamic restraint at lower temperatures."
[4] "Though major progress has been made by using redox-active transition metal oxide catalysts, such as vanadium (1,6) and molybdenum, the presence of O2 can cause overoxidation of olefins to carbon oxides (COx), resulting in the inefficient use of the reactant and low process selectivity."

1.Current propylene production methods, such as steam cracking, fluid catalytic cracking, and direct dehydrogenation of propane, face challenges including high-energy demands and rapid catalyst deactivation due to coke formation. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by being exothermic, which eliminates thermodynamic constraints at lower temperatures. However, using oxygen as an oxidant in ODHP can lead to overoxidation of olefins to carbon oxides, resulting in inefficient reactant use and low process selectivity.

1.目前的丙烯生产方法，如蒸汽裂解、流化催化裂化和直接丙烷脱氢，面临着高能耗和催化剂因焦炭形成而迅速失活的挑战。丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）通过其放热性解决了这些问题，这在较低温度下消除了热力学限制。然而，在ODHP中使用氧气作为氧化剂会导致烯烃过度氧化为碳氧化物，导致反应物使用效率低下和过程选择性低。
