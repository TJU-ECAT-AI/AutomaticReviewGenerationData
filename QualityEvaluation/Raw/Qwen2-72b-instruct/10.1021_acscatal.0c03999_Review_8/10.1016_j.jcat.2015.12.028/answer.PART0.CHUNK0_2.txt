[1] "The application of N2O as an oxidant for propane ODH, despite resulting in lower propane conversion,allows higher propene selectivity and lower selectivity to carbon oxides [15]."
[2] "According to the quoted authors [15], propane- to-propene oxydehydrogenation occurs on vanadyl groups with oxygen removal and subsequent vanadium reduction. Oxidants (O2 or N2O) are responsible for vanadium reoxidation. Reoxidation of vanadium species by oxygen is very fast and results in the temporary formation of peroxovanadates, highly reactive to subsequent propene oxidation. The ability of N2O to reoxidize the reduced vanadium species is less and occurs without the formation of peroxovanadates [16]."
[3] "It was noted that the higher the reaction temperature the faster the deactivation. The very small amount of coke deposit in the spent catalyst would indicate that the vanadium reduction is responsible for catalyst deactivation."
[4] "The ability of N2O to reoxidize the reduced vanadium species is less and occurs without the formation of peroxovanadates [16]."
[5] "Accordingly, it seems that carbonaceous deposit formation may influence catalyst deactivation only slightly and that the reduction of vanadium species is mainly responsible for catalyst deactivation."
[6] "Regeneration of the catalyst by heating under N2O at 753 K partly restores the activity, and only reoxidation in the presence of oxygen restores the initial activity (Fig. 4S, Supplementary Materials)."

1.Nitrous oxide (N2O) is used as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) due to its ability to achieve higher propene selectivity compared to other oxidants, despite lower propane conversion. This is attributed to the fact that N2O reoxidizes the reduced vanadium species without forming peroxovanadates, which are highly reactive and can lead to the formation of carbon oxides. The use of N2O as an oxidant results in a slower reoxidation process, which allows for a higher selectivity towards propene. However, the catalyst deactivation is a critical challenge in this process, as it is mainly caused by the reduction of vanadium species rather than the formation of carbonaceous deposits. The regeneration of the catalyst by heating under N2O at high temperatures can partly restore its activity, but complete restoration requires reoxidation in the presence of oxygen. To address these limitations and make N2O-ODHP a more feasible option for practical implementation, research directions could focus on developing more stable catalysts that can maintain their activity over longer periods, optimizing the reaction conditions to minimize vanadium reduction, and exploring alternative regeneration methods that can effectively restore the catalyst's activity without the need for high-temperature treatments.

1.一氧化二氮(N2O)作为氧化脱氢丙烷(ODHP)的氧化剂,由于其能够实现比其他氧化剂更高的丙烯选择性,尽管丙烷转化率较低。这归因于N2O能够还原钒物种而不形成过氧钒酸盐,过氧钒酸盐具有高反应性,可导致碳氧化物的形成。使用N2O作为氧化剂导致较慢的再氧化过程,这允许更高的丙烯选择性。然而,催化剂失活是该过程中的一个关键挑战,因为它主要是由钒物种的还原引起的,而不是碳质沉积物的形成。通过在高温下在N2O下加热催化剂,可以部分恢复其活性,但完全恢复需要在氧气存在下进行再氧化。为了解决这些限制,使N2O-ODHP成为更可行的实践实施选项,研究方向可以集中在开发更稳定的催化剂,这些催化剂可以在更长的时间内保持其活性,优化反应条件以最小化钒还原,并探索可以有效恢复催化剂活性而无需高温处理的替代再生方法。
