[1] "The application of N2O as an oxidant for propane ODH, despite resulting in lower propane conversion,allows higher propene selectivity and lower selectivity to carbon oxides [15]."
[2] "According to the quoted authors [15], propane- to-propene oxydehydrogenation occurs on vanadyl groups with oxygen removal and subsequent vanadium reduction. Oxidants (O2 or N2O) are responsible for vanadium reoxidation. Reoxidation of vanadium species by oxygen is very fast and results in the temporary formation of peroxovanadates, highly reactive to subsequent propene oxidation. The ability of N2O to reoxidize the reduced vanadium species is less and occurs without the formation of peroxovanadates [16]."
[3] "It was noted that the higher the reaction temperature the faster the deactivation. The very small amount of coke deposit in the spent catalyst would indicate that the vanadium reduction is responsible for catalyst deactivation."
[4] "Accordingly, it seems that carbonaceous deposit formation may influence catalyst deactivation only slightly and that the reduction of vanadium species is mainly responsible for catalyst deactivation."

1.Nitrous oxide (N2O) is used as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) because it allows higher propene selectivity and lower selectivity to carbon oxides compared to other oxidants. This is due to the fact that N2O reoxidizes the reduced vanadium species without the formation of peroxovanadates, which are highly reactive to subsequent propene oxidation. However, the use of N2O as an oxidant also presents challenges in terms of catalyst deactivation and stability. Catalyst deactivation is mainly caused by the reduction of vanadium species, which is more pronounced at higher reaction temperatures. Carbonaceous deposit formation may also contribute to catalyst deactivation, but to a lesser extent. Strategies to address these limitations could include the development of more stable vanadium-based catalysts, the optimization of reaction conditions to minimize vanadium reduction, and the use of regeneration techniques to restore catalyst activity.

1.一氧化二氮(N2O)被用作丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)的氧化剂,因为它允许更高的丙烯选择性,并且对碳氧化物的选择性较低,与其他氧化剂相比。这是由于N2O在没有形成过氧化钒的情况下重新氧化还原的钒物种,而过氧化钒对随后的丙烯氧化具有高度反应性。然而,使用N2O作为氧化剂也存在催化剂失活和稳定性方面的挑战。催化剂失活主要是由钒物种的还原引起的,在较高的反应温度下更为明显。碳沉积物的形成也可能导致催化剂失活,但程度较小。解决这些限制的策略可能包括开发更稳定的基于钒的催化剂,优化反应条件以最小化钒还原,以及使用再生技术来恢复催化剂活性。
