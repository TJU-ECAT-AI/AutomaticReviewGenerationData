[1] "The application of N2O as an oxidant for propane ODH, despite resulting in lower propane conversion,allows higher propene selectivity and lower selectivity to carbon oxides [15]."
[2] "According to the quoted authors [15], propane- to-propene oxydehydrogenation occurs on vanadyl groups with oxygen removal and subsequent vanadium reduction. Oxidants (O2 or N2O) are responsible for vanadium reoxidation. Reoxidation of vanadium species by oxygen is very fast and results in the temporary formation of peroxovanadates, highly reactive to subsequent propene oxidation. The ability of N2O to reoxidize the reduced vanadium species is less and occurs without the formation of peroxovanadates [16]."
[3] "It was noted that the higher the reaction temperature the faster the deactivation. The very small amount of coke deposit in the spent catalyst would indicate that the vanadium reduction is responsible for catalyst deactivation."

1.Nitrous oxide (N2O) is used as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) due to its ability to achieve higher propene selectivity compared to other oxidants. This is attributed to the fact that N2O allows for higher propene selectivity and lower selectivity to carbon oxides. The process of propane-to-propene oxydehydrogenation occurs on vanadyl groups with oxygen removal and subsequent vanadium reduction. While oxidants like oxygen (O2) and N2O are responsible for vanadium reoxidation, the reoxidation of vanadium species by oxygen is very fast and results in the temporary formation of peroxovanadates, which are highly reactive to subsequent propene oxidation. In contrast, N2O has a lesser ability to reoxidize the reduced vanadium species and does not result in the formation of peroxovanadates.
2.The catalysts employed in this process include vanadium catalysts supported on mesoporous silica supports. These catalysts are known for their activity in propane ODH and propene-to-PO oxidation. However, they undergo deactivation with time on stream, which is more pronounced at higher reaction temperatures. The deactivation is primarily attributed to vanadium reduction rather than the formation of significant amounts of coke deposit.
3.The critical challenges associated with catalyst deactivation and stability in N2O-ODHP include the reduction of vanadium species, which is responsible for the observed catalyst deactivation. Strategies to address these limitations could involve the development of more stable vanadium-based catalysts that can maintain their oxidized state under reaction conditions. Research directions could focus on modifying the catalyst structure, such as increasing the dispersion of vanadium species or incorporating stabilizing agents that can prevent vanadium reduction. Additionally, optimizing the reaction conditions, such as temperature and contact time, could help mitigate the deactivation rate and improve catalyst stability.
4.Potential strategies to address the limitations of N2O-ODHP and make it a more feasible option for practical implementation include the development of more efficient and stable catalysts, optimization of reaction conditions, and the exploration of alternative oxidants that can provide better reoxidation capabilities for vanadium species. Research efforts could also focus on understanding the fundamental mechanisms of vanadium reduction and reoxidation to design catalysts that can maintain their activity over extended periods. Furthermore, the integration of in situ regeneration techniques, such as the use of oxygen or other reoxidizing agents, could help restore catalyst activity and prolong its operational lifetime.

1.一氧化二氮(N2O)作为氧化脱氢丙烷(ODHP)的氧化剂,由于其能够实现比其他氧化剂更高的丙烯选择性而被使用。这归因于N2O允许更高的丙烯选择性和较低的碳氧化物选择性。丙烷至丙烯氧脱氢过程发生在钒基团上,伴随着氧气的去除和随后的钒还原。虽然氧化剂如氧气(O2)和N2O负责钒的再氧化,但钒物种通过氧气的再氧化非常快,并导致临时形成过氧化钒,对随后的丙烯氧化具有高度反应性。相比之下,N2O再氧化还原钒物种的能力较弱,并且不会导致过氧化钒的形成。
2.在这一过程中使用的催化剂包括支持在介孔二氧化硅载体上的钒催化剂。这些催化剂在丙烷ODH和丙烯至PO氧化中表现出活性。然而,它们在流上时间上经历失活,在较高反应温度下更为明显。失活主要归因于钒还原,而不是形成大量焦炭沉积。
3.N2O-ODHP中催化剂失活和稳定性相关的关键挑战包括钒物种的还原,这是观察到的催化剂失活的原因。解决这些限制的策略可能涉及开发更稳定的基于钒的催化剂,这些催化剂可以在反应条件下保持其氧化状态。研究方向可以集中在修改催化剂结构上,例如增加钒物种的分散度或掺入稳定剂,以防止钒还原。此外,优化反应条件,如温度和接触时间,可以帮助减缓失活速率并提高催化剂稳定性。
4.解决N2O-ODHP限制并使其成为更可行的实用实施选项的潜在策略包括开发更高效和稳定的催化剂、优化反应条件以及探索可以为钒物种提供更好再氧化能力的替代氧化剂。研究工作还可以集中在理解钒还原和再氧化的基本机制上,以设计可以在延长时期内保持其活性的催化剂。此外,在位再生技术的集成,如使用氧气或其他再氧化剂,可以帮助恢复催化剂活性并延长其运行寿命。

[5] "To discuss the probable reaction paths of hydrocarbon oxidation, both propane and propene oxidation were conducted at different contact times (1, 1.5, 2.1, and 2.5 s)."
[6] "The decrease in the contribution of acrolein to propene oxidation products with a prolongation of contact time supports this explanation (Fig. 10). A longer contact time results in an elongated time of interaction of formed acrolein with the surface centers, which results in carbonaceous deposit formation. This may explain the lower selectivity to acrolein. Formation of significant amounts of carbonaceous deposit was confirmed by elemental analysis indicating 1.8% of carbon in the catalyst after 1 h on stream."

1.Nitrous oxide (N2O) is used as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) due to its ability to achieve higher propene selectivity compared to other oxidants, despite lower propane conversion. This is attributed to the fact that N2O reoxidizes the reduced vanadium species without forming peroxovanadates, which are highly reactive and can lead to the formation of carbon oxides. The use of N2O as an oxidant results in a slower reoxidation process, which allows for a higher selectivity towards propene. However, the catalyst deactivation is a critical challenge in this process, as it is mainly caused by the reduction of vanadium species rather than the formation of carbonaceous deposits. The regeneration of the catalyst by heating under N2O at high temperatures can partly restore its activity, but complete restoration requires reoxidation in the presence of oxygen. To address these limitations and make N2O-ODHP a more feasible option for practical implementation, research directions could focus on developing more stable catalysts that can maintain their activity over longer periods, optimizing the reaction conditions to minimize vanadium reduction, and exploring alternative regeneration methods that can effectively restore the catalyst's activity without the need for high-temperature treatments.
