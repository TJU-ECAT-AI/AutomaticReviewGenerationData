[1] "The application of N2O as an oxidant for propane ODH, despite resulting in lower propane conversion,allows higher propene selectivity and lower selectivity to carbon oxides [15]."
[2] "According to the quoted authors [15], propane- to-propene oxydehydrogenation occurs on vanadyl groups with oxygen removal and subsequent vanadium reduction. Oxidants (O2 or N2O) are responsible for vanadium reoxidation. Reoxidation of vanadium species by oxygen is very fast and results in the temporary formation of peroxovanadates, highly reactive to subsequent propene oxidation. The ability of N2O to reoxidize the reduced vanadium species is less and occurs without the formation of peroxovanadates [16]."
[3] "It was noted that the higher the reaction temperature the faster the deactivation. The very small amount of coke deposit in the spent catalyst would indicate that the vanadium reduction is responsible for catalyst deactivation."
[4] "Accordingly, it seems that carbonaceous deposit formation may influence catalyst deactivation only slightly and that the reduction of vanadium species is mainly responsible for catalyst deactivation."
[5] "To discuss the probable reaction paths of hydrocarbon oxidation, both propane and propene oxidation were conducted at different contact times (1, 1.5, 2.1, and 2.5 s)."
[6] "The decrease in the contribution of acrolein to propene oxidation products with a prolongation of contact time supports this explanation (Fig. 10). A longer contact time results in an elongated time of interaction of formed acrolein with the surface centers, which results in carbonaceous deposit formation. This may explain the lower selectivity to acrolein. Formation of significant amounts of carbonaceous deposit was confirmed by elemental analysis indicating 1.8% of carbon in the catalyst after 1 h on stream."

1.Nitrous oxide (N2O) is used as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) because it allows higher propene selectivity and lower selectivity to carbon oxides compared to other oxidants. The process occurs on vanadyl groups with oxygen removal and subsequent vanadium reduction. The reoxidation of vanadium species by oxygen is very fast and results in the temporary formation of peroxovanadates, which are highly reactive to subsequent propene oxidation. However, the ability of N2O to reoxidize the reduced vanadium species is less and occurs without the formation of peroxovanadates. The main catalysts employed in this process are vanadium-based catalysts supported on mesoporous silica. The critical challenges associated with catalyst deactivation and stability are the reduction of vanadium species and the formation of carbonaceous deposits. Strategies or research directions that could address these limitations include the development of more stable vanadium-based catalysts, the use of alternative oxidants that can more effectively reoxidize the reduced vanadium species, and the optimization of reaction conditions to minimize the formation of carbonaceous deposits.

1.一氧化二氮（N2O）被用作丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）的氧化剂，因为它允许更高的丙烯选择性，并且与其它氧化剂相比，对碳氧化物的选择性较低。该过程发生在钒基团上，氧气被移除，随后是钒的还原。通过氧气重新氧化钒物种的速度非常快，并导致暂时形成过氧钒酸盐，这些过氧钒酸盐对随后的丙烯氧化具有高度反应性。然而，N2O重新氧化还原的钒物种的能力较低，并且不会形成过氧钒酸盐。该过程的主要催化剂是支撑在介孔二氧化硅上的钒基催化剂。与催化剂失活和稳定性相关的关键挑战是钒物种的还原和碳沉积物的形成。可以解决这些限制的策略或研究方向包括开发更稳定的钒基催化剂，使用可以更有效地重新氧化还原的钒物种的替代氧化剂，以及优化反应条件以最小化碳沉积物的形成。
