[1] "The application of N2O as an oxidant for propane ODH, despite resulting in lower propane conversion,allows higher propene selectivity and lower selectivity to carbon oxides [15]."
[2] "According to the quoted authors [15], propane- to-propene oxydehydrogenation occurs on vanadyl groups with oxygen removal and subsequent vanadium reduction. Oxidants (O2 or N2O) are responsible for vanadium reoxidation. Reoxidation of vanadium species by oxygen is very fast and results in the temporary formation of peroxovanadates, highly reactive to subsequent propene oxidation. The ability of N2O to reoxidize the reduced vanadium species is less and occurs without the formation of peroxovanadates [16]."
[3] "It was noted that the higher the reaction temperature the faster the deactivation. The very small amount of coke deposit in the spent catalyst would indicate that the vanadium reduction is responsible for catalyst deactivation."
[4] "The ability of N2O to reoxidize the reduced vanadium species is less and occurs without the formation of peroxovanadates [16]."
[5] "Accordingly, it seems that carbonaceous deposit formation may influence catalyst deactivation only slightly and that the reduction of vanadium species is mainly responsible for catalyst deactivation."

1.Nitrous oxide (N2O) is used as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) due to its ability to provide higher propene selectivity compared to other oxidants, despite lower propane conversion. This is attributed to the fact that N2O reoxidizes the reduced vanadium species without forming peroxovanadates, which are highly reactive and can lead to the formation of carbon oxides. The use of N2O as an oxidant results in a slower reoxidation process, which allows for a more selective conversion of propane to propene. However, the higher reaction temperature leads to faster catalyst deactivation, which is mainly attributed to the reduction of vanadium species rather than the formation of carbonaceous deposits. Strategies to address these limitations could include developing catalysts with improved thermal stability and reactivity towards N2O, as well as optimizing reaction conditions to minimize vanadium reduction while maintaining high propene selectivity.

1.一氧化二氮(N2O)作为氧化剂在丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)中的应用,是由于它能够提供比其他氧化剂更高的丙烯选择性,尽管丙烷转化率较低。这归因于N2O能够还原的钒物种重新氧化,而不会形成过氧钒酸盐,过氧钒酸盐具有高反应性,可导致二氧化碳的形成。使用N2O作为氧化剂导致较慢的再氧化过程,这允许更选择性地将丙烷转化为丙烯。然而,较高的反应温度导致催化剂失活速度加快,这主要归因于钒物种的还原,而不是碳沉积物的形成。解决这些限制的策略可能包括开发具有改进的热稳定性和对N2O反应性的催化剂,以及优化反应条件,以最小化钒还原,同时保持高丙烯选择性。
