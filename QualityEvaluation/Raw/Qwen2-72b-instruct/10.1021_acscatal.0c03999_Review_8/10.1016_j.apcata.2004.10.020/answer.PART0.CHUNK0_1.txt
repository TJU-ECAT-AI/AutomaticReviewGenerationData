[1] "Much research effort is currently devoted to the selective activation and functionalization of light alkanes (methane,ethane, propane, and butane) for obtaining petrochemicals directly or their respective olefinic feedstocks. Many studies have explored the catalytic oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) to propylene, a key building block in the petrochemical industry."
[2] "As recently reported by three independent research groups [25], a promising alternative system for ODHP arises from the application of iron zeolites using N2O as the oxidant, leading to remarkable propylene yields at a substantially lower operation temperature (643773 K) in comparison with the mixed metal oxides (823923 K)."
[3] "The applied experimental condi- tions in [25] markedly differ with respect to temperature,feed composition, space velocity, and total pressure, so that a proper comparison between the various catalysts cannot be established."
[4] "Besides, iron zeolites strongly deactivate during ODHP with N2O due to coke formation and it is unclear from these publications whether activities have been reported at a similar degree of deactivation and/or the same reaction time."
[5] "The highest propylene yield was obtained over steam-activated Fe-ZSM-5 (22%), followed by the iron zeolites prepared by liquid-ion exchange (16%) and chemical vapor deposition (9%)."
[6] "The positive effect of steaming on the catalytic performance of iron zeolites for different conver- sions involving N2O, including direct decomposition [15],benzene hydroxylation [14,16,17], and propane oxidation [4,5] has been previously reported."
[7] "The time and degree of deactivation in Fig. 2 depend on the catalyst in question."
[8] "The relatively fast deactivation of lie-Fe-Z can be attributed to the presence of a relatively high number of Brnsted acid sites in the sample."
[9] "The samples prepared by liquid-ion exchange and chemical vapor deposition contain high iron loadings and a marked contribution of large iron oxide particles, where the total combustion of reaction intermediates leading to the olefin appears to be favored."
[10] "The C3H8 and N2O conversions over st-H-Z are much lower than over st-Fe-Z, and the same observation holds true when comparing c-H-Z and lie-Fe-Z."
[11] "This striking result strongly suggests that an extremely low number of iron sites is responsible of the observed performance."
[12] "The decrease in TOF is steepest at molar Fe/Al ratios <0.5. This result further emphasizes the severe Fe- underutilization in the synthesized iron zeolites and that iron impurities in H-ZSM-5 play a decisive role in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (OHDP) with N2O."
[13] "The vital role of iron impurities in the catalytic performance of H-ZSM-5 for the oxidation of benzene to phenol (BTOP) with N2O has been extensively examined in the literature, originally by the group of Panov [17], and more recently in excellent works of Kuba nek et al. [16] and Jia et al. [14]."
[14] "This differs from ODHP, further evincing the sensitivity of the specific catalytic process and its intrinsic mechanism to the form(s) of active iron [20]."
[15] "The current work has not specifically touched upon the role of acidity on the ODHP reaction, which may be important not only for the initial performance but also to understand and minimize catalyst deactivation."

1.N2O is a promising oxidant for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) to produce propylene, a key petrochemical feedstock. Compared to other oxidants, N2O allows for higher propylene yields at lower operating temperatures. However, the experimental conditions for N2O-ODHP vary widely, making it difficult to compare the performance of different catalysts. Iron zeolites, when used with N2O, can achieve high propylene yields, but they suffer from significant deactivation due to coke formation. The deactivation rate and extent depend on the specific catalyst, with liquid-ion exchanged iron zeolites deactivating faster due to their high acidity. Catalysts prepared by chemical vapor deposition, containing large iron oxide particles, favor the total oxidation of intermediates, leading to lower propylene selectivity. Steam-activated iron zeolites show better resistance to deactivation and higher propylene yields. Commercial zeolites with trace amounts of iron, after steam treatment, exhibit exceptional performance in N2O-ODHP, suggesting that isolated iron sites are crucial for the reaction. The turnover frequency for propylene production decreases sharply with increasing iron content, highlighting the importance of iron dispersion. Strategies to address catalyst deactivation and improve stability in N2O-ODHP include optimizing the preparation method to minimize iron clustering, controlling the acidity of the catalyst, and understanding the role of extraframework aluminum species. Research is needed to elucidate the role of acidity in ODHP and to develop catalysts with the right balance of iron species and acidity for improved selectivity and stability.

1.N2O作为氧化剂在丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）中用于生产丙烯，一种关键的石化原料，显示出巨大潜力。与其它氧化剂相比，N2O能在较低的操作温度下实现更高的丙烯产量。然而，N2O-ODHP的实验条件差异很大，这使得难以比较不同催化剂的性能。使用N2O的铁沸石催化剂可以达到高丙烯产量，但它们因焦炭形成而遭受显著失活。失活速率和程度取决于特定的催化剂，通过液相离子交换制备的铁沸石失活更快，因为它们的酸性较高。通过化学气相沉积制备的催化剂，含有大铁氧化物颗粒，有利于中间体的完全氧化，导致丙烯选择性降低。蒸汽活化的铁沸石显示出更好的抗失活能力和更高的丙烯产量。经过蒸汽处理的商业沸石，含有微量铁，表现出在N2O-ODHP中卓越的性能，表明孤立的铁位点对反应至关重要。丙烯生产的周转频率随着铁含量的增加而急剧下降，突出了铁分散的重要性。解决N2O-ODHP中催化剂失活和提高稳定性的策略包括优化制备方法以最小化铁聚团，控制催化剂的酸性，以及理解框架外铝物种的作用。需要研究来阐明ODHP中酸性的作用，并开发具有正确铁物种和酸性平衡的催化剂，以提高选择性和稳定性。
