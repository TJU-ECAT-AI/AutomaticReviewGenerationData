1.Nitrous oxide (N2O) has been identified as a promising oxidant for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) to produce propylene, a key petrochemical feedstock. Compared to traditional oxidants like oxygen, N2O allows for the production of propylene at lower temperatures, which can improve the efficiency and selectivity of the process. The use of N2O as an oxidant in ODHP has been shown to achieve remarkable propylene yields, particularly when iron zeolites are used as catalysts. These catalysts have been found to be effective at lower temperatures than those required for mixed metal oxide catalysts, which typically operate at higher temperatures. However, the performance of iron zeolites can vary significantly depending on the method of iron incorporation and the preparation technique. Steam activation of iron-substituted ZSM-5 zeolites has been shown to result in superior propylene yields compared to other preparation methods. Iron impurities in steamed commercial H-ZSM-5 zeolites have also been found to induce high propylene selectivity, leading to low COx formation. A major challenge in the use of N2O for ODHP is the deactivation of iron zeolite catalysts due to coke formation, which can limit the stability and lifetime of the catalyst. Strategies to address this limitation could include the development of more stable catalyst formulations, optimization of reaction conditions to minimize coke formation, and the use of in situ regeneration techniques to maintain catalyst activity. Research directions that could potentially make N2O-ODHP a more feasible option for practical implementation include the exploration of alternative iron sources and incorporation methods, the design of catalysts with enhanced resistance to deactivation, and the development of integrated process designs that incorporate catalyst regeneration steps.

1.一氧化二氮(N2O)已被确定为一种有前景的氧化剂,用于丙烷的氧化脱氢(ODHP)以生产丙烯,丙烯是关键的石化原料。与氧气等传统氧化剂相比,N2O允许在较低温度下生产丙烯,这可以提高过程的效率和选择性。N2O作为氧化剂在ODHP中的应用已被证明能够实现显著的丙烯产量,尤其是在使用铁沸石作为催化剂时。这些催化剂已被发现能在比混合金属氧化物催化剂所需的温度低得多的温度下有效,混合金属氧化物催化剂通常在较高温度下运行。然而,铁沸石在ODHP中的性能可能因铁的掺入方法和制备技术而显著不同。铁取代的ZSM-5沸石的蒸汽活化已被证明与其它制备方法相比,能产生更优的丙烯产量。在蒸馏的商业H-ZSM-5沸石中发现的铁杂质也被发现能诱导高丙烯选择性,导致低COx形成。在N2O用于ODHP时的一个主要挑战是由于焦炭形成导致的铁沸石催化剂失活,这可能限制催化剂的稳定性和寿命。解决这一局限性的策略可能包括开发更稳定的催化剂配方、优化反应条件以最小化焦炭形成,以及使用原位再生技术以维持催化剂活性。可能使N2O-ODHP成为更可行的实用实施选项的研究方向包括探索替代铁源和掺入方法、设计具有增强抗失活性的催化剂,以及开发整合过程设计,将催化剂再生步骤纳入其中。

1.N2O is a promising oxidant for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) to produce propylene, a key petrochemical feedstock. Compared to other oxidants, N2O allows for higher propylene yields at lower operating temperatures. However, the experimental conditions for N2O-ODHP vary widely, making it difficult to compare the performance of different catalysts. Iron zeolites, when used with N2O, can achieve high propylene yields, but they suffer from significant deactivation due to coke formation. The deactivation rate and extent depend on the specific catalyst, with liquid-ion exchanged iron zeolites deactivating faster due to their high acidity. Catalysts prepared by chemical vapor deposition, containing large iron oxide particles, favor the total oxidation of intermediates, leading to lower propylene selectivity. Steam-activated iron zeolites show better resistance to deactivation and higher propylene yields. Commercial zeolites with trace amounts of iron, after steam treatment, exhibit exceptional performance in N2O-ODHP, suggesting that isolated iron sites are crucial for the reaction. The turnover frequency for propylene production decreases sharply with increasing iron content, highlighting the importance of iron dispersion. Strategies to address catalyst deactivation and improve stability in N2O-ODHP include optimizing the preparation method to minimize iron clustering, controlling the acidity of the catalyst, and understanding the role of extraframework aluminum species. Research is needed to elucidate the role of acidity in ODHP and to develop catalysts with the right balance of iron species and acidity for improved selectivity and stability.

1.N2O作为氧化剂在丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）中用于生产丙烯，一种关键的石化原料，显示出巨大潜力。与其它氧化剂相比，N2O能在较低的操作温度下实现更高的丙烯产量。然而，N2O-ODHP的实验条件差异很大，这使得难以比较不同催化剂的性能。使用N2O的铁沸石催化剂可以达到高丙烯产量，但它们因焦炭形成而遭受显著失活。失活速率和程度取决于特定的催化剂，通过液相离子交换制备的铁沸石失活更快，因为它们的酸性较高。通过化学气相沉积制备的催化剂，含有大铁氧化物颗粒，有利于中间体的完全氧化，导致丙烯选择性降低。蒸汽活化的铁沸石显示出更好的抗失活能力和更高的丙烯产量。经过蒸汽处理的商业沸石，含有微量铁，表现出在N2O-ODHP中卓越的性能，表明孤立的铁位点对反应至关重要。丙烯生产的周转频率随着铁含量的增加而急剧下降，突出了铁分散的重要性。解决N2O-ODHP中催化剂失活和提高稳定性的策略包括优化制备方法以最小化铁聚团，控制催化剂的酸性，以及理解框架外铝物种的作用。需要研究来阐明ODHP中酸性的作用，并开发具有正确铁物种和酸性平衡的催化剂，以提高选择性和稳定性。

1.据报道，使用N2O作为氧化剂在丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）中，可以在比混合金属氧化物显著更低的操作温度下获得优异的丙烯产率。这些研究的实验条件在温度、进料组成、空间速度和总压力方面存在显著差异，因此很难比较各种催化剂。铁沸石在N2O-ODHP过程中由于焦炭形成而强烈失活，不清楚这些报道的活性是否在相似的失活程度和/或相同的反应时间下获得。蒸汽活化Fe-ZSM-5显示出最高的丙烯产率，其次是通过液体离子交换和化学气相沉积制备的铁沸石。c-H-Z的丙烯产率是所有样品中最低的，但令人惊讶地接近在铁含量丰富的cvd-Fe-Z上获得的产率。蒸汽处理对涉及N2O的不同转化的铁沸石催化性能有积极影响。失活的时间和程度取决于催化剂。st-Fe-Z沸石表现出显著的抗失活性。lie-Fe-Z的快速失活可归因于样品中存在相对大量的Brnsted酸位点。通过液体离子交换和化学气相沉积制备的样品含有高铁含量和大量铁氧化物颗粒，其中丙烯前体的完全氧化似乎被优先考虑。煅烧和蒸汽处理的商业沸石的焦炭形成曲线非常相似，最终焦炭量约为5%。st-H-Z的丙烯产率显著高于c-H-Z，尽管两种样品的丙烷转化率相当。极低数量的铁位点负责观察到的性能。TOF的下降在Fe/Al摩尔比<0.5时最陡。H-ZSM-5中的铁杂质在N2O-ODHP中起决定性作用。H-ZSM-5中铁杂质在N2O氧化苯制酚（BTOP）中的催化性能的决定性作用已在文献中广泛研究。这种推理可以推广到丙烷的氧化脱氢。酸性在ODHP反应中的作用可能不仅对初始性能很重要，而且对于理解和最小化催化剂失活也很重要。失活在蒸汽活化沸石上较慢，这是蒸汽处理导致Brnsted位点显著减少的结果。大量质子酸位点应催化焦炭形成，从而加速沸石失活。很可能一定量的酸性基团与框架外铁物种共存对反应有利。需要进一步研究来阐明酸性在ODHP中的作用。

1.N2O as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) has been reported by three independent research groups to lead to remarkable propylene yields at a substantially lower operation temperature compared to mixed metal oxides. However, the experimental conditions in these studies differ significantly, making it difficult to compare the various catalysts. Iron zeolites deactivate strongly during ODHP with N2O due to coke formation, and it is unclear whether activities have been reported at a similar degree of deactivation and/or the same reaction time. Steam-activated Fe-ZSM-5 showed the highest propylene yield, followed by iron zeolites prepared by liquid-ion exchange and chemical vapor deposition. The propylene yield over c-H-Z was the lowest among the samples investigated but surprisingly approached that obtained over the iron-rich cvd-Fe-Z. The positive effect of steaming on the catalytic performance of iron zeolites for different conversions involving N2O has been previously reported. The time and degree of deactivation depend on the catalyst in question. The st-Fe-Z zeolite exhibits a remarkable resistance towards deactivation, showing an increase in propylene yield from 22% to 25% during the first 20 min on stream, which is maintained during 75 min. The relatively fast deactivation of lie-Fe-Z can be attributed to the presence of a relatively high number of Brnsted acid sites in the sample. The samples prepared by liquid-ion exchange and chemical vapor deposition contain high iron loadings and a marked contribution of large iron oxide particles, where the total combustion of reaction intermediates leading to the olefin appears to be favored. The coking profiles of the calcined and steamed commercial zeolites are very similar, leading to a final coke amount of ca. 5%. The propylene yield is significantly higher in st-H-Z than in c-H-Z, although the propane conversion over both samples is rather similar. This striking result strongly suggests that an extremely low number of iron sites is responsible for the observed performance. The decrease in TOF is steepest at molar Fe/Al ratios <0.5. This result further emphasizes the severe Fe- underutilization in the synthesized iron zeolites and that iron impurities in H-ZSM-5 play a decisive role in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (OHDP) with N2O. The vital role of iron impurities in the catalytic performance of H-ZSM-5 for the oxidation of benzene to phenol (BTOP) with N2O has been extensively examined in the literature. This reasoning can be extrapolated to the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane. The current work has not specifically touched upon the role of acidity on the ODHP reaction, which may be important not only for the initial performance but also to understand and minimize catalyst deactivation. Our results show that deactivation is slower over the steam- activated zeolites, with a significantly reduced number of Brnsted sites as a consequence of the steam treatment. A high number of protonic acid sites should catalyze coke formation, thus accelerating the zeolite deactivation. It is likely that the presence of a certain amount of acidic groups coexisting with extraframework iron species is beneficial for the reaction. Further research is required to elucidate the role of acidity in ODHP.

1.据报道，使用N2O作为氧化剂在丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）中，与混合金属氧化物相比，可以在显著较低的操作温度下获得优异的丙烯产率。然而，这些研究中的实验条件差异显著，使得难以比较各种催化剂。铁沸石在N2O-ODHP过程中由于焦炭形成而强烈失活，不清楚是否在相似的失活程度和/或相同的反应时间下报告了活性。蒸汽活化Fe-ZSM-5显示出最高的丙烯产率，其次是通过液相离子交换和化学气相沉积制备的铁沸石。c-H-Z的丙烯产率是所有样品中最低的，但令人惊讶地接近在铁含量丰富的cvd-Fe-Z上获得的产率。之前的研究已经报道了蒸汽对涉及N2O的不同转化中铁沸石催化性能的积极影响。失活的时间和程度取决于所用的催化剂。st-Fe-Z沸石对失活表现出显著的抵抗力，在前20分钟内丙烯产率从22%增加到25%，并且在75分钟内保持不变。lie-Fe-Z的快速失活可归因于样品中存在相对大量的Brnsted酸位点。通过液相离子交换和化学气相沉积制备的样品含有高铁含量和大量铁氧化物颗粒的显著贡献，其中反应中间体向烯烃的完全燃烧似乎受到青睐。煅烧和蒸汽处理的商业沸石的焦化曲线非常相似，导致最终焦炭量约为5%。在st-H-Z中，丙烯产率显著高于c-H-Z，尽管在两种样品上，丙烷转化率相当。这一惊人结果强烈表明，极低数量的铁位点对观察到的性能负责。TOF的下降在Fe/Al摩尔比<0.5时最陡。这一结果进一步强调了在合成铁沸石中Fe的严重利用不足，以及H-ZSM-5中的铁杂质在N2O-ODHP中起决定性作用。H-ZSM-5中铁杂质在N2O氧化苯到酚（BTOP）的催化性能中的关键作用已在文献中广泛研究。这一推理可以推广到丙烷的氧化脱氢，也解释了Bula nek等人在铁浓度为300-1200 ppm的Fe-ZSM-5上获得的高丙烯产率。目前的工作没有具体涉及酸性在ODHP反应中的作用，这可能不仅对初始性能很重要，而且对于理解和最小化催化剂失活也很重要。我们的结果显示，失活在蒸汽活化沸石上较慢，由于蒸汽处理，Brnsted位点的数量显著减少。大量质子酸位点应催化焦炭形成，从而加速沸石失活。很可能存在一定量的酸性基团与框架外铁物种共存对反应是有益的。需要进一步的研究来阐明酸性在ODHP中的作用。
