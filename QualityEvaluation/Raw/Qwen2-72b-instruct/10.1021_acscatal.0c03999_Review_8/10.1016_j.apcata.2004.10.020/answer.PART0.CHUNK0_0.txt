[1] "Much research effort is currently devoted to the selective activation and functionalization of light alkanes (methane,ethane, propane, and butane) for obtaining petrochemicals directly or their respective olefinic feedstocks."
[2] "Many studies have explored the catalytic oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) to propylene, a key building block in the petrochemical industry."
[3] "Relatively complex multimetallic mixed oxides based on Vand Mo are considered as the most efficient catalysts in this reaction, with propene yields in the range of 1030% using O2 as the oxidant [1]."
[4] "As recently reported by three independent research groups [25], a promising alternative system for ODHP arises from the application of iron zeolites using N2O as the oxidant, leading to remarkable propylene yields at a substantially lower operation temperature (643773 K) in comparison with the mixed metal oxides (823923 K)."
[5] "The applied experimental condi- tions in [25] markedly differ with respect to temperature,feed composition, space velocity, and total pressure, so that a proper comparison between the various catalysts cannot be established."
[6] "Besides, iron zeolites strongly deactivate during ODHP with N2O due to coke formation and it is unclear from these publications whether activities have been reported at a similar degree of deactivation and/or the same reaction time."
[7] "The method of incorporation of iron in ZSM-5 zeolites plays an essential role on the performance for propylene production via oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) with N2O."
[8] "Activation in steam of the isomor- phously substituted iron zeolite leads to superior propylene yields as compared to iron zeolites prepared by post- synthesis methods (liquid-ion exchange and chemical vapor deposition)."
[9] "Iron impurities in steamed commercial H-ZSM- 5 induce relatively low conversions of propene and N2O,but leads to a propylene selectivity of 90% and thus to very low COx formation."
[10] "Our results indicate the extraordinary quality of iron traces in the commercial zeolite sample for the ODHP reaction particularly after steam treatment."
[11] "The isolated nature of the iron species in this sample can be envisaged in view of the high dilution of iron in the zeolite matrix."
[12] "This lends credence to the model where mononuclear Fe sites are vital for propylene production via ODHP, in good agreement with the N2O-mediated oxidation of benzene to phenol over iron zeolites."
[13] "Association of iron species into large clusters, typically observed in synthesized iron zeolites enhances deep oxidation of important reaction intermediates leading to COx."

1.Nitrous oxide (N2O) has been identified as a promising oxidant for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) to produce propylene, a key petrochemical feedstock. Compared to traditional oxidants like oxygen, N2O allows for the production of propylene at lower temperatures, which can improve the efficiency and selectivity of the process. The use of N2O as an oxidant in ODHP has been shown to achieve remarkable propylene yields, particularly when iron zeolites are used as catalysts. These catalysts have been found to be effective at lower temperatures than those required for mixed metal oxide catalysts, which typically operate at higher temperatures. However, the performance of iron zeolites can vary significantly depending on the method of iron incorporation and the preparation technique. Steam activation of iron-substituted ZSM-5 zeolites has been shown to result in superior propylene yields compared to other preparation methods. Iron impurities in steamed commercial H-ZSM-5 zeolites have also been found to induce high propylene selectivity, leading to low COx formation. A major challenge in the use of N2O for ODHP is the deactivation of iron zeolite catalysts due to coke formation, which can limit the stability and lifetime of the catalyst. Strategies to address this limitation could include the development of more stable catalyst formulations, optimization of reaction conditions to minimize coke formation, and the use of in situ regeneration techniques to maintain catalyst activity. Research directions that could potentially make N2O-ODHP a more feasible option for practical implementation include the exploration of alternative iron sources and incorporation methods, the design of catalysts with enhanced resistance to deactivation, and the development of integrated process designs that incorporate catalyst regeneration steps.

1.一氧化二氮(N2O)已被确定为一种有前景的氧化剂,用于丙烷的氧化脱氢(ODHP)以生产丙烯,丙烯是关键的石化原料。与氧气等传统氧化剂相比,N2O允许在较低温度下生产丙烯,这可以提高过程的效率和选择性。N2O作为氧化剂在ODHP中的应用已被证明能够实现显著的丙烯产量,尤其是在使用铁沸石作为催化剂时。这些催化剂已被发现能在比混合金属氧化物催化剂所需的温度低得多的温度下有效,混合金属氧化物催化剂通常在较高温度下运行。然而,铁沸石在ODHP中的性能可能因铁的掺入方法和制备技术而显著不同。铁取代的ZSM-5沸石的蒸汽活化已被证明与其它制备方法相比,能产生更优的丙烯产量。在蒸馏的商业H-ZSM-5沸石中发现的铁杂质也被发现能诱导高丙烯选择性,导致低COx形成。在N2O用于ODHP时的一个主要挑战是由于焦炭形成导致的铁沸石催化剂失活,这可能限制催化剂的稳定性和寿命。解决这一局限性的策略可能包括开发更稳定的催化剂配方、优化反应条件以最小化焦炭形成,以及使用原位再生技术以维持催化剂活性。可能使N2O-ODHP成为更可行的实用实施选项的研究方向包括探索替代铁源和掺入方法、设计具有增强抗失活性的催化剂,以及开发整合过程设计,将催化剂再生步骤纳入其中。
