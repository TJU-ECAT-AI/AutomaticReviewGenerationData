[1] "As recently reported by three independent research groups [25], a promising alternative system for ODHP arises from the application of iron zeolites using N2O as the oxidant, leading to remarkable propylene yields at a substantially lower operation temperature (643773 K) in comparison with the mixed metal oxides (823923 K)."
[2] "The applied experimental condi- tions in [25] markedly differ with respect to temperature,feed composition, space velocity, and total pressure, so that a proper comparison between the various catalysts cannot be established."
[3] "Besides, iron zeolites strongly deactivate during ODHP with N2O due to coke formation and it is unclear from these publications whether activities have been reported at a similar degree of deactivation and/or the same reaction time."
[4] "The highest propylene yield was obtained over steam-activated Fe-ZSM-5 (22%), followed by the iron zeolites prepared by liquid-ion exchange (16%) and chemical vapor deposition (9%)."
[5] "The propylene yield over c-H-Z was the lowest among the samples investigated (7%), but surprisingly approaches that obtained over the iron-rich cvd-Fe-Z."
[6] "The positive effect of steaming on the catalytic performance of iron zeolites for different conver- sions involving N2O, including direct decomposition [15],benzene hydroxylation [14,16,17], and propane oxidation [4,5] has been previously reported."
[7] "The time and degree of deactivation in Fig. 2 depend on the catalyst in question."
[8] "The st-Fe-Z zeolite exhibits a remarkable resistance towards deactivation, showing an increase in propylene yield from 22% to 25% during the first 20 min on stream, which is maintained during 75 min."
[9] "The relatively fast deactivation of lie-Fe-Z can be attributed to the presence of a relatively high number of Brnsted acid sites in the sample."
[10] "The samples prepared by liquid-ion exchange and chemical vapor deposition contain high iron loadings and a marked contribution of large iron oxide particles, where the total combustion of reaction intermediates leading to the olefin appears to be favored."
[11] "The coking profiles of the calcined and steamed commercial zeolites are very similar, leading to a final coke amount of ca. 5% (Fig. 2)."
[12] "The propylene yield is significantly higher in st-H-Z than in c-H-Z, although the propane conversion over both samples is rather similar (especially after 40 min on stream)."
[13] "This striking result strongly suggests that an extremely low number of iron sites is responsible of the observed performance."
[14] "The decrease in TOF is steepest at molar Fe/Al ratios <0.5."

1.N2O as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) has been reported by three independent research groups to lead to remarkable propylene yields at a substantially lower operation temperature compared to mixed metal oxides. However, the experimental conditions in these studies differ significantly, making it difficult to compare the various catalysts. Iron zeolites deactivate strongly during ODHP with N2O due to coke formation, and it is unclear whether activities have been reported at a similar degree of deactivation and/or the same reaction time. Steam-activated Fe-ZSM-5 showed the highest propylene yield, followed by iron zeolites prepared by liquid-ion exchange and chemical vapor deposition. The propylene yield over c-H-Z was the lowest among the samples investigated but surprisingly approached that obtained over the iron-rich cvd-Fe-Z. The positive effect of steaming on the catalytic performance of iron zeolites for different conversions involving N2O has been previously reported. The time and degree of deactivation depend on the catalyst in question. The st-Fe-Z zeolite exhibits a remarkable resistance towards deactivation, showing an increase in propylene yield from 22% to 25% during the first 20 min on stream, which is maintained during 75 min. The relatively fast deactivation of lie-Fe-Z can be attributed to the presence of a relatively high number of Brnsted acid sites in the sample.

1.据报道，使用N2O作为氧化剂在丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）中，与混合金属氧化物相比，可以在显著较低的操作温度下获得优异的丙烯产率。然而，这些研究中的实验条件差异显著，使得难以比较各种催化剂。铁沸石在N2O-ODHP过程中由于焦炭形成而强烈失活，不清楚是否在相似的失活程度和/或相同的反应时间下报告了活性。蒸汽活化Fe-ZSM-5显示出最高的丙烯产率，其次是通过液相离子交换和化学气相沉积制备的铁沸石。c-H-Z的丙烯产率是所有样品中最低的，但令人惊讶地接近在铁含量丰富的cvd-Fe-Z上获得的产率。之前的研究已经报道了蒸汽对涉及N2O的不同转化中铁沸石催化性能的积极影响。失活的时间和程度取决于所用的催化剂。st-Fe-Z沸石对失活表现出显著的抵抗力，在前20分钟内丙烯产率从22%增加到25%，并且在75分钟内保持不变。lie-Fe-Z的快速失活可归因于样品中存在相对大量的Brnsted酸位点。通过液相离子交换和化学气相沉积制备的样品含有高铁含量和大量铁氧化物颗粒的显著贡献，其中反应中间体向烯烃的完全燃烧似乎受到青睐。煅烧和蒸汽处理的商业沸石的焦化曲线非常相似，导致最终焦炭量约为5%。在st-H-Z中，丙烯产率显著高于c-H-Z，尽管在两种样品上，丙烷转化率相当。这一惊人结果强烈表明，极低数量的铁位点对观察到的性能负责。TOF的下降在Fe/Al摩尔比<0.5时最陡。这一结果进一步强调了在合成铁沸石中Fe的严重利用不足，以及H-ZSM-5中的铁杂质在N2O-ODHP中起决定性作用。H-ZSM-5中铁杂质在N2O氧化苯到酚（BTOP）的催化性能中的关键作用已在文献中广泛研究。这一推理可以推广到丙烷的氧化脱氢，也解释了Bula nek等人在铁浓度为300-1200 ppm的Fe-ZSM-5上获得的高丙烯产率。目前的工作没有具体涉及酸性在ODHP反应中的作用，这可能不仅对初始性能很重要，而且对于理解和最小化催化剂失活也很重要。我们的结果显示，失活在蒸汽活化沸石上较慢，由于蒸汽处理，Brnsted位点的数量显著减少。大量质子酸位点应催化焦炭形成，从而加速沸石失活。很可能存在一定量的酸性基团与框架外铁物种共存对反应是有益的。需要进一步的研究来阐明酸性在ODHP中的作用。
