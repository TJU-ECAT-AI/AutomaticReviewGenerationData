[1] "As recently reported by three independent research groups [25], a promising alternative system for ODHP arises from the application of iron zeolites using N2O as the oxidant, leading to remarkable propylene yields at a substantially lower operation temperature (643773 K) in comparison with the mixed metal oxides (823923 K)."
[2] "The applied experimental condi- tions in [25] markedly differ with respect to temperature,feed composition, space velocity, and total pressure, so that a proper comparison between the various catalysts cannot be established."
[3] "Besides, iron zeolites strongly deactivate during ODHP with N2O due to coke formation and it is unclear from these publications whether activities have been reported at a similar degree of deactivation and/or the same reaction time."
[4] "The highest propylene yield was obtained over steam-activated Fe-ZSM-5 (22%), followed by the iron zeolites prepared by liquid-ion exchange (16%) and chemical vapor deposition (9%)."
[5] "The propylene yield over c-H-Z was the lowest among the samples investigated (7%), but surprisingly approaches that obtained over the iron-rich cvd-Fe-Z."
[6] "The positive effect of steaming on the catalytic performance of iron zeolites for different conver- sions involving N2O, including direct decomposition [15],benzene hydroxylation [14,16,17], and propane oxidation [4,5] has been previously reported."
[7] "The time and degree of deactivation in Fig. 2 depend on the catalyst in question."
[8] "The st-Fe-Z zeolite exhibits a remarkable resistance towards deactivation, showing an increase in propylene yield from 22% to 25% during the first 20 min on stream, which is maintained during 75 min."
[9] "The relatively fast deactivation of lie-Fe-Z can be attributed to the presence of a relatively high number of Brnsted acid sites in the sample."
[10] "The samples prepared by liquid-ion exchange and chemical vapor deposition contain high iron loadings and a marked contribution of large iron oxide particles, where the total combustion of reaction intermediates leading to the olefin appears to be favored."
[11] "The coking profiles of the calcined and steamed commercial zeolites are very similar, leading to a final coke amount of ca. 5% (Fig. 2)."
[12] "The propylene yield is significantly higher in st-H-Z than in c-H-Z, although the propane conversion over both samples is rather similar (especially after 40 min on stream)."
[13] "This striking result strongly suggests that an extremely low number of iron sites is responsible of the observed performance."
[14] "The decrease in TOF is steepest at molar Fe/Al ratios <0.5."
[15] "This result further emphasizes the severe Fe- underutilization in the synthesized iron zeolites and that iron impurities in H-ZSM-5 play a decisive role in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (OHDP) with N2O."
[16] "The vital role of iron impurities in the catalytic performance of H-ZSM-5 for the oxidation of benzene to phenol (BTOP) with N2O has been extensively examined in the literature, originally by the group of Panov [17], and more recently in excellent works of Kuba nek et al. [16] and Jia et al. [14]."
[17] "This reasoning can be extrapolated to the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane,as also explains the high propylene yields obtained by Bula nek et al. [5] over Fe-ZSM-5 with iron concentrations of 3001200 ppm."
[18] "The current work has not specifically touched upon the role of acidity on the ODHP reaction, which may be important not only for the initial performance but also to understand and minimize catalyst deactivation."
[19] "Our results show that deactivation is slower over the steam- activated zeolites (Fig. 2), with a significantly reduced number of Brnsted sites as a consequence of the steam treatment [21]."
[20] "A high number of protonic acid sites should catalyze coke formation, thus accelerating the zeolite deactivation, as suggested from the results over lie- Fe-Z."
[21] "It is likely that the presence of a certain amount of acidic groups coexisting with extraframework iron species is beneficial for the reaction."
[22] "Further research is required to elucidate the role of acidity in ODHP."

1.N2O as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) has been reported by three independent research groups to lead to remarkable propylene yields at a substantially lower operation temperature compared to mixed metal oxides. The experimental conditions for these studies differ significantly, making it difficult to compare the various catalysts. Iron zeolites deactivate strongly during ODHP with N2O due to coke formation, and it is unclear whether activities have been reported at a similar degree of deactivation and/or the same reaction time. Steam-activated Fe-ZSM-5 shows the highest propylene yield, followed by iron zeolites prepared by liquid-ion exchange and chemical vapor deposition. The propylene yield over c-H-Z is the lowest among the samples investigated but surprisingly approaches that obtained over the iron-rich cvd-Fe-Z. Steaming has a positive effect on the catalytic performance of iron zeolites for different conversions involving N2O. The time and degree of deactivation depend on the catalyst. The st-Fe-Z zeolite exhibits a remarkable resistance towards deactivation. The relatively fast deactivation of lie-Fe-Z can be attributed to the presence of a relatively high number of Brnsted acid sites in the sample. The samples prepared by liquid-ion exchange and chemical vapor deposition contain high iron loadings and a marked contribution of large iron oxide particles, where the total combustion of reaction intermediates leading to the olefin appears to be favored. The coking profiles of the calcined and steamed commercial zeolites are very similar, leading to a final coke amount of ca. 5%.

1.据报道，使用N2O作为氧化剂在丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）中，可以在比混合金属氧化物显著更低的操作温度下获得优异的丙烯产率。这些研究的实验条件在温度、进料组成、空间速度和总压力方面存在显著差异，因此很难比较各种催化剂。铁沸石在N2O-ODHP过程中由于焦炭形成而强烈失活，不清楚这些报道的活性是否在相似的失活程度和/或相同的反应时间下获得。蒸汽活化Fe-ZSM-5显示出最高的丙烯产率，其次是通过液体离子交换和化学气相沉积制备的铁沸石。c-H-Z的丙烯产率是所有样品中最低的，但令人惊讶地接近在铁含量丰富的cvd-Fe-Z上获得的产率。蒸汽处理对涉及N2O的不同转化的铁沸石催化性能有积极影响。失活的时间和程度取决于催化剂。st-Fe-Z沸石表现出显著的抗失活性。lie-Fe-Z的快速失活可归因于样品中存在相对大量的Brnsted酸位点。通过液体离子交换和化学气相沉积制备的样品含有高铁含量和大量铁氧化物颗粒，其中丙烯前体的完全氧化似乎被优先考虑。煅烧和蒸汽处理的商业沸石的焦炭形成曲线非常相似，最终焦炭量约为5%。st-H-Z的丙烯产率显著高于c-H-Z，尽管两种样品的丙烷转化率相当。极低数量的铁位点负责观察到的性能。TOF的下降在Fe/Al摩尔比<0.5时最陡。H-ZSM-5中的铁杂质在N2O-ODHP中起决定性作用。H-ZSM-5中铁杂质在N2O氧化苯制酚（BTOP）中的催化性能的决定性作用已在文献中广泛研究。这种推理可以推广到丙烷的氧化脱氢。酸性在ODHP反应中的作用可能不仅对初始性能很重要，而且对于理解和最小化催化剂失活也很重要。失活在蒸汽活化沸石上较慢，这是蒸汽处理导致Brnsted位点显著减少的结果。大量质子酸位点应催化焦炭形成，从而加速沸石失活。很可能一定量的酸性基团与框架外铁物种共存对反应有利。需要进一步研究来阐明酸性在ODHP中的作用。
