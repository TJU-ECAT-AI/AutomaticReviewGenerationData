[1] "N2O improves selectivity, probably by: (i) inhibiting the adsorption of O2 and/or (ii) increasing reduction rate of the catalysts."
[2] "In presence of N2O, catalytic sites work in a more reduced state."
[3] "N2O inhibits the adsorption of O2, so limiting the formation of non-selective oxygen species (from O2) and/or the oxidation rate of the catalysts."
[4] "The Oproduced by dissociation of N2O can oxidise propane to propene."
[5] "Adjusting the concentration of promoters could be an useful tool to modulate selectivity during the catalytic reaction."

1.N2O improves the selectivity of the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) process by inhibiting the adsorption of O2 and increasing the reduction rate of the catalysts. This results in catalytic sites working in a more reduced state, which limits the formation of non-selective oxygen species and the oxidation rate of the catalysts. The dissociated oxygen from N2O can also directly oxidize propane to propene. Adjusting the concentration of N2O could be a useful strategy to modulate selectivity during the catalytic reaction.

1.N2O通过抑制O2的吸附和提高催化剂的还原速率，提高了丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)过程的选择性。这导致催化位点处于更还原的状态，限制了非选择性氧物种的形成和催化剂的氧化速率。N2O分解产生的氧可以直接将丙烷氧化为丙烯。调整N2O的浓度可能是一种在催化反应中调节选择性的有用策略。
