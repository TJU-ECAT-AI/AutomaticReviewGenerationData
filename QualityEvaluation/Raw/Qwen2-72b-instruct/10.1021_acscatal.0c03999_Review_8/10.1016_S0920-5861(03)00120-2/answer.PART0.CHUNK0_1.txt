1.N2O can improve the selectivity of propylene production in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane by inhibiting the adsorption of O2 and increasing the reduction rate of the catalysts. The oxygen produced by the dissociation of N2O can also oxidize propane to propene. In the presence of N2O, catalytic sites work in a more reduced state, which can lead to higher selectivity. N2O has been used as a pure oxidant in various reactions, including the oxidative coupling of methane to ethane, the transformation of benzene to phenol, and the oxidation of ethylene to epoxide. However, the document does not provide detailed information on the specific catalysts used in the N2O-ODHP process or the challenges associated with catalyst deactivation and stability. Strategies to address these limitations could include developing more stable catalysts, optimizing reaction conditions to minimize deactivation, and exploring alternative reaction pathways that are less prone to catalyst degradation.

1.在丙烷氧化脱氢反应中，N2O可以通过抑制O2的吸附和提高催化剂的还原速率来提高丙烯的选择性。N2O分解产生的氧气也可以将丙烷氧化为丙烯。在N2O存在下，催化位点处于更还原的状态，这可能导致更高的选择性。N2O已被用作各种反应中的纯氧化剂，包括甲烷氧化偶联为乙烷、苯转化为酚以及乙烯氧化为环氧乙烷。然而，文件没有提供N2O-ODHP过程中使用的特定催化剂的详细信息，也没有提供与催化剂失活和稳定性相关的挑战。解决这些限制的策略可能包括开发更稳定的催化剂，优化反应条件以最小化失活，以及探索不太容易导致催化剂降解的替代反应途径。
