1.Nitrous oxide (N2O) can improve the selectivity of the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) process by inhibiting the adsorption of O2 and/or increasing the reduction rate of the catalysts. The oxygen produced by the dissociation of N2O can oxidize propane to propene. In the presence of N2O, catalytic sites work in a more reduced state. N2O has been used as a pure oxidant in various reactions, including the oxidative coupling of methane to ethane, the transformation of benzene to phenol, and the oxidation of ethylene to epoxide. The use of N2O in ODHP can potentially lead to higher propylene selectivity compared to other oxidants by controlling the oxidation state of the catalyst and limiting the formation of non-selective oxygen species.

1.一氧化二氮（N2O）可以通过抑制O2的吸附和/或增加催化剂的还原速率来提高丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）过程的选择性。N2O分解产生的氧可以将丙烷氧化为丙烯。在N2O存在下，催化位点处于更还原的状态。N2O已被用作各种反应中的纯氧化剂，包括甲烷氧化偶联为乙烷、苯转化为酚以及乙烯氧化为环氧乙烷。在ODHP中使用N2O可以通过控制催化剂的氧化状态和限制非选择性氧物种的形成，从而与其它氧化剂相比，可能产生更高的丙烯选择性。
