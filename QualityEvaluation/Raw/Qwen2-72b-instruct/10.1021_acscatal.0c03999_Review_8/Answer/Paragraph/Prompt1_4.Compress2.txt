{"DOC": "N2O boosts propylene selectivity in ODHP, reducing propane and oxygen conversion while increasing propylene yield, as evidenced by a 300 ppm N2O addition increasing propylene selectivity (Quote [2]). N2O promotes a more reduced state in catalytic sites, enhancing selectivity (Quote [3]). At higher concentrations, N2O-derived oxygen species can induce ODHP, albeit less oxidatively than O2 (Quote [5]). However, pure N2O use is inadvisable due to rapid catalyst deactivation without molecular oxygen for regeneration (Quote [17]). N2O inhibits non-selective sites, and the synergistic effect of O2 and N2O in modulating the catalyst's oxidation state for improved selectivity is crucial (Quote [19]). These findings highlight the need for advanced research to address catalyst stability and deactivation, making N2O-ODHP a more feasible option.", "Doi": "10.1016/j.cattod.2004.09.043"},
{"DOC": "N2O in ODHP enhances propylene selectivity by limiting catalyst reoxidation, promoting VOx dispersion, and favoring selective oxidation over COx formation. Its lower reoxidation ability increases catalyst reduction, spatially separating active lattice oxygen. Propylene selectivity improves over V/g-Al2O3 materials with well-dispersed VOx species, and N2O tunes selectivity further. Reduced steady-state concentration of active surface lattice oxygen favors selective propane oxidation to propene over COx formation. Active sites with more than two lattice oxygen species favor waste product formation. Addressing catalyst deactivation and stability is crucial for practical N2O-ODHP implementation.", "Doi": "10.1016/j.cattod.2005.11.028"},
{"DOC": "N2O's role as an oxidant in propane's oxidative dehydrogenation (ODHP) over FeZSM-5 yields up to 25% propene at 723 K, attributed to its monooxygen donor specificity and iron's coordination of reactive oxygen species. However, coke formation deactivates the catalyst, reducing propene yield. Higher temperatures mitigate this, with FeZSM-5 showing slower deactivation at 773 K due to higher N2O conversion. O2 presence drastically lowers C3H6 yields and increases COx, negatively impacting propene intermediates. Strategies include optimizing temperatures, developing coke-resistant catalysts, and improving regeneration methods. Research should focus on understanding coke formation and identifying active sites less prone to deactivation, aiming to develop cost-effective, selective catalysts for low-temperature NH3 oxidation to N2O for a pure N2O source, enhancing N2O-ODHP's practicality.", "Doi": "10.1021/ie0493863"},
{"DOC": "N2O, as an ODHP oxidant, excels in propylene selectivity over molecular oxygen, as evidenced by its performance in other oxidation reactions. Nickel molybdate catalysts, when used with N2O, enhance propylene yield and selectivity, reduce oxygen consumption and CO2 production at low N2O concentrations. However, higher N2O concentrations decrease propylene selectivity and form carbonaceous products. Adjusting N2O concentration modulates the oxidation state of oxide catalysts, improving catalytic performance. Challenges in catalyst deactivation and stability require advanced research for practical N2O-ODHP implementation.", "Doi": "10.1016/S0926-860X(03)00103-0"},
{"DOC": "N2O as an oxidant in ODHP yields higher propylene selectivity than dioxygen, which over-oxidizes propane to CO and CO2. Iron-zeolites, notably Fe-ZSM-5, are effective catalysts for N2O-ODHP. However, catalyst deactivation and the complex conversion of N2O on iron-zeolites in the presence of propane pose significant challenges. Research is essential to understand deactivation mechanisms, develop more stable catalysts, and optimize conditions to reduce coke formation and enhance catalyst lifetime, making N2O-ODHP more practical.", "Doi": "10.1016/j.micromeso.2014.07.032"},
{"DOC": "N2O in ODHP boosts propylene selectivity by minimizing active sites due to less favorable decomposition, as per [1] and [2]. High selectivity is achieved with fully covered vanadia species [3]. Optimizing active lattice oxygen concentration with N2O [4] controls selective oxidation and addresses catalyst stability and deactivation.", "Doi": "10.1016/S0926-860X(01)00836-5"},
{"DOC": "N2O as an ODHP oxidant enhances propylene selectivity over O2, inhibiting direct propane and consecutive propene oxidation to COx. Its weaker oxidizing potential reduces catalytic activity by less effectively re-oxidizing reduced VOx sites. Propylene selectivity is consistent between dispersed VOx and crystalline V2O5 nanoparticles with N2O, unlike O2's selectivity with V2O5. N2O's advantage stems from reduced surface density of active lattice oxygen in VOx, favoring propylene formation over combustion at lower densities.", "Doi": "10.1016/j.jcat.2005.05.025"},
{"DOC": "N2O as an oxidant in ODHP enhances propylene selectivity up to three times compared to O2, particularly with bulk-like V2O5 catalysts. This is attributed to N2O's reduced ability to re-oxidize VOx species, leading to higher catalyst reduction. N2O significantly reduces direct propane combustion and consecutive propene oxidation to COx, improving initial propene selectivity. The nature of oxygen species from O2 and N2O plays a critical role in catalyst selectivity and activity.", "Doi": "10.1016/j.apcata.2006.11.021"},
{"DOC": "N2O as an oxidant in ODHP enhances propylene selectivity over vanadia catalysts, attributed to the higher reduction degree of VOx species. N2O's lower reoxidation ability reduces ODP activity but suppresses nonselective propene oxidation to COx. Unlike O2, N2O doesn't produce nonselective adsorbed oxygen species. Catalyst deactivation and stability are challenges, requiring controlled active oxygen species and prevention of nonselective species. Strategies include optimized catalysts for stability and selectivity, regeneration methods, and alternative oxidants. Advanced research is needed to define oxygen species from O2 and N2O over VOx species and understand their role in selectivity.", "Doi": "10.1021/jp070747c"},

{"DOC": "N2O is an efficient oxidant for ODHP over steam-activated Fe-zeolites (MFI, BEA), achieving high initial propylene yields. Catalyst deactivation due to coke formation is a challenge, with FeZSM-5 showing higher resistance than FeBEA. Extraframework iron species, generated during steam treatment, are crucial for activity. The TEOM, offering real-time monitoring of mass changes, presents advantages over conventional microbalances. Steam activation is essential for high catalytic activities. The more open structure of FeZSM-5 reduces pore blocking by coke and improves reactant/product transport, slowing deactivation. Highly active Fe-zeolite catalysts in direct N2O decomposition may have increased resistance to coke deactivation in ODHP with N2O.", "Doi": "10.1016/j.jcat.2004.02.005"},
