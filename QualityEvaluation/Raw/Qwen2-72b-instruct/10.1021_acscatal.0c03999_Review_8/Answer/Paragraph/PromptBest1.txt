The utilization of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) has garnered significant attention due to its ability to enhance propylene selectivity compared to traditional oxidants [\[10.1016/j.jcat.2010.06.010\]]. N2O's role in ODHP is multifaceted, as it slows the reoxidation of vanadium oxides (VOx), thereby reducing the formation of active oxygen species and curtailing the conversion of propene to carbon oxides [\[10.1016/j.jcat.2010.06.010\]]. This effect is particularly pronounced when the vanadium coverage is below a monolayer, with selectivity plummeting as V2O5 nanocrystallites dominate [\[10.1016/j.jcat.2010.06.010\]]. Non-lattice oxygen from O2 is more conducive to COx formation than N2O, which aids in maintaining higher propene selectivity [\[10.1016/j.jcat.2010.06.010\]]. 

When employing iron-zeolites as catalysts in propane ODHP, N2O's monooxygen role and iron's reactive oxygen coordination have been shown to boost propene selectivity, achieving yields comparable to top-performing vanadium and molybdenum catalysts [\[10.1016/j.ces.2004.07.035\]]. However, coke-induced deactivation, particularly in Fe-beta zeolites, significantly curbs the yield [\[10.1016/j.ces.2004.07.035\]]. Deactivation stems from the loss of active sites, a decline in site quality, and restricted pore access [\[10.1016/j.ces.2004.07.035\]]. 

In situ FTIR spectroscopy and temperature-programmed oxidation mass spectrometry (TEOMGC) have been instrumental in gaining insights into deactivation mechanisms [\[10.1016/j.jcat.2007.04.010\]]. Advanced research is imperative to address the limitations of N2O-ODHP, focusing on catalyst stability and deactivation [\[10.1016/j.ces.2004.07.035\], \[10.1016/j.jcat.2007.04.010\]].

※※※

Integrative Understanding and Prospective Outlook: The use of N2O in ODHP presents a promising avenue for enhancing propylene selectivity, yet the challenges of catalyst deactivation and stability remain significant hurdles. To advance the practical implementation of N2O-ODHP, future research should concentrate on developing catalysts with enhanced stability and resistance to coke formation. This could involve the synthesis of novel catalysts with tailored active sites and improved pore structures to prevent the accumulation of coke [\[10.1016/j.ces.2004.07.035\]]. 

Moreover, the optimization of reaction conditions, such as temperature and N2O concentration, is crucial for maximizing propylene yield while minimizing deactivation [\[10.1016/j.jcat.2010.06.010\]]. Advanced in situ spectroscopic techniques, such as FTIR and TEOMGC, should be employed to gain deeper insights into the deactivation mechanisms and guide the design of more robust catalysts [\[10.1016/j.jcat.2007.04.010\]]. 

Additionally, the exploration of alternative regeneration methods, such as the use of N2O for partial regeneration and oxygen for full activity restoration, could offer a pathway to mitigate catalyst deactivation [\[10.1016/j.jcat.2015.12.028\]]. Lastly, the development of cost-effective and scalable N2O sources is essential for the economic viability of N2O-ODHP [\[10.1016/j.cattod.2004.03.005\]]. By addressing these challenges, N2O-ODHP could potentially become a more feasible and sustainable alternative for propylene production.

The utilization of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) significantly enhances propylene selectivity compared to traditional oxidants like O2 \[10.1016/j.jcat.2010.06.010\]. This is attributed to N2O's ability to curb O2 adsorption, enhance catalyst reduction, and control the oxidation states of active sites, thereby limiting the formation of COx and propene over-oxidation \[10.1016/S0920-5861(03)00120-2\]. N2O's slower reoxidation of VOx species, compared to O2, reduces the density of active lattice oxygen, favoring propene over COx formation \[10.1016/j.jcat.2005.05.025\]. However, catalyst deactivation and stability remain critical challenges, often due to coke deposition, which hinders the performance of iron-zeolite catalysts \[10.1016/j.ces.2004.07.035\]. Advanced in situ studies, such as FTIR spectroscopy, are crucial for real-time monitoring of carbon deposits and surface changes, aiding in the understanding of hydrocarbon conversion \[10.1016/j.jcat.2007.04.010\]. Research gaps exist in the selective oxidation with N2O over iron zeolites and the reusability of catalysts post-regeneration \[10.1016/j.jcat.2007.04.010\]. Steam activation has been shown to mitigate deactivation by reducing the formation of coke \[10.1016/j.apcata.2004.10.020\]. Strategies to optimize conditions, enhance stability, and inhibit oxygen adsorption on catalysts like NiMoO4 are essential for practical implementation \[10.1016/j.cattod.2004.03.005\].
                ※※※
                Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: The use of N2O in ODHP presents a promising avenue for propylene production, offering higher selectivity and reduced COx formation. However, the challenges of catalyst deactivation and stability, particularly due to coke deposition, necessitate innovative research directions. Advanced in situ techniques, such as FTIR and EPR spectroscopy, offer insights into the mechanisms of deactivation and the nature of oxygen species, which are critical for catalyst design and optimization. The development of coke-resistant catalysts and efficient regeneration methods, possibly involving steam activation, could significantly enhance the practicality of N2O-ODHP. Moreover, exploring the synergistic effects of N2O with other promoters and optimizing the N2O:O2 ratio could lead to more stable and selective ODHP processes. Future research should also focus on the development of cost-effective N2O sources and the integration of N2O production from ammonia decomposition, which could potentially address the economic and environmental concerns associated with N2O use. Additionally, the exploration of new catalyst structures and the stabilization of vanadium species could mitigate the issues of catalyst deactivation and enhance the overall efficiency of the N2O-ODHP process.

The utilization of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) significantly enhances propylene selectivity compared to traditional oxidants, such as molecular oxygen (O2) \[10.1016/j.jcat.2010.06.010\]. This enhancement is attributed to the slower reoxidation of vanadia (VOx) species, which reduces the density of active oxygen sites and curbs the conversion of propene to carbon oxides (COx) \[10.1016/j.jcat.2010.06.010\]. Moreover, N2O facilitates the reduction of the catalyst, thereby promoting a selective oxidation pathway that favors propylene production over combustion \[10.1016/j.jcat.2005.05.025\]. However, the use of N2O in ODHP is not without challenges. Catalyst deactivation, primarily due to coke deposition, is a significant hurdle that limits the practicality of this process \[10.1016/j.ces.2004.07.035\]. This deactivation is exacerbated by the agglomeration of VOx species, which increases the oxidation of propene to COx, leading to a drop in propylene selectivity \[10.1016/j.jcat.2010.06.010\]. Furthermore, the stability of the catalyst under N2O conditions is a critical issue that requires advanced research for the practical implementation of N2O-ODHP \[10.1016/j.jcat.2007.04.010\].

                    Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: The advancements in utilizing N2O as an oxidant in ODHP have illuminated a promising pathway for enhancing propylene selectivity. However, the challenges of catalyst deactivation and stability, particularly in the context of coke formation and VOx agglomeration, demand innovative solutions. Future research endeavors might focus on developing coke-resistant catalysts, optimizing regeneration techniques, and understanding the mechanisms of coke formation and VOx agglomeration. Additionally, the exploration of alternative oxidants that can synergize with N2O to improve selectivity and stability could be a fruitful area of investigation. Advanced in situ studies, such as real-time monitoring of coke deposition and catalyst regeneration, are essential for gaining deeper insights into the deactivation processes. Moreover, the development of cost-effective and selective catalysts for the conversion of ammonia (NH3) to N2O could provide a sustainable source of N2O for ODHP, further enhancing the practicality of this process.
