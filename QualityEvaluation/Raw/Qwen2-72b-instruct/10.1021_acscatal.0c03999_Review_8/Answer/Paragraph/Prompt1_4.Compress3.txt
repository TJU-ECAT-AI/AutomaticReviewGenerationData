Iron-zeolites, particularly Fe-ZSM-5, are effective catalysts for N2O-ODHP. However, catalyst deactivation and the complex conversion of N2O on iron-zeolites in the presence of propane pose significant challenges. Research is essential to understand deactivation mechanisms, develop more stable catalysts, and optimize conditions to reduce coke formation and enhance catalyst lifetime, making N2O-ODHP more practical.", "Doi": "10.1016/j.micromeso.2014.07.032"},
{"DOC": "N2O in ODHP enhances propylene selectivity by reducing active sites due to its less favorable decomposition, as per [1] and [2]. High selectivity is achieved with well-dispersed vanadia species [3]. Optimizing active lattice oxygen concentration with N2O [4] controls selective oxidation, addressing catalyst stability and deactivation challenges.", "Doi": "10.1016/S0926-860X(01)00836-5"},
{"DOC": "N2O as an ODHP oxidant boosts propylene selectivity over O2, curbing direct propane and consecutive propene oxidation to COx. Its milder oxidizing strength diminishes catalytic activity by less efficiently re-oxidizing reduced VOx sites. Propylene selectivity is uniform between dispersed VOx and crystalline V2O5 nanoparticles with N2O, unlike O2's selectivity with V2O5. N2O's edge originates from decreased surface density of active lattice oxygen in VOx, favoring propylene formation over combustion at lower densities.", "Doi": "10.1016/j.jcat.2005.05.025"},
{"DOC": "N2O as an oxidant in ODHP boosts propylene selectivity by up to three times compared to O2, especially with bulk-like V2O5 catalysts. This enhancement is attributed to N2O's lower re-oxidation ability, leading to a higher degree of catalyst reduction. Direct propane combustion and consecutive propene oxidation to COx are significantly reduced in the presence of N2O, improving initial propene selectivity. The nature of oxygen species from O2 and N2O plays a critical role in catalyst selectivity and activity. However, catalyst deactivation and stability remain challenges. Advanced research is needed to understand and mitigate these limitations, potentially making N2O-ODHP a more practical industrial process.", "Doi": "10.1016/j.apcata.2006.11.021"},
{"DOC": "N2O as an oxidant in ODHP enhances propylene selectivity over vanadia catalysts, attributed to the higher reduction degree of VOx species. N2O's lower reoxidation ability reduces ODP activity but suppresses nonselective propene oxidation to COx. Unlike O2, N2O doesn't produce nonselective adsorbed oxygen species, which are formed from O2 and catalyze nonselective consecutive propene oxidation to COx. Catalyst deactivation and stability are challenges, requiring controlled active oxygen species and prevention of nonselective species. Strategies include optimized catalysts for stability and selectivity, regeneration methods, and alternative oxidants. Advanced research is needed to define oxygen species from O2 and N2O over VOx species and understand their role in selectivity.", "Doi": "10.1021/jp070747c"},
{"DOC": "N2O in ODHP boosts propylene selectivity, evidenced by reduced CO2 yield and oxygen conversion, as per quotes 2, 5, and 6. It promotes molybdenum reduction, enhancing catalyst selectivity (quotes 7 and 10). Challenges include decreased propane conversion and CO2 yield, impacting practicality. Research must focus on stable catalysts, optimized conditions, and new catalysts with higher activity and selectivity. N2O inhibits oxygen adsorption on NiMoO4 and promotes molybdenum reduction, indicating a mechanism for selectivity control.", "Doi": "10.1016/j.cattod.2004.03.005"},
{"DOC": "N2O is an efficient oxidant for ODHP over steam-activated Fe-zeolites (MFI, BEA), achieving high initial propylene yields. Catalyst deactivation due to coke formation is a challenge, with FeZSM-5 showing higher resistance than FeBEA. Extraframework iron species, generated during steam treatment, are crucial for activity. The TEOM, offering real-time monitoring of mass changes, presents advantages over conventional microbalances. Steam activation is essential for high catalytic activities. The more open structure of FeZSM-5 reduces pore blocking by coke and improves reactant/product transport, slowing deactivation. Highly active Fe-zeolite catalysts in direct N2O decomposition may have increased resistance to coke deactivation in ODHP with N2O.", "Doi": "10.1016/j.jcat.2004.02.005"},
{"DOC": "N2O in ODHP boosts propene selectivity by efficiently reoxidizing vanadium without forming reactive peroxovanadates, minimizing carbon oxide production. Catalyst deactivation, primarily due to vanadium reduction, poses a significant challenge. Partial regeneration through N2O heating and full restoration with oxygen reoxidation are promising strategies. Research should concentrate on developing stable catalysts, optimizing conditions to prevent vanadium reduction, and enhancing regeneration techniques to make N2O-ODHP a viable industrial process.", "Doi": "10.1016/j.jcat.2015.12.028"}
