Nitrous oxide (N2O) has emerged as a promising oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) process, offering significant advantages in terms of propylene selectivity. Unlike traditional oxidants, N2O can enhance the selectivity towards propylene by minimizing the formation of undesired byproducts such as carbon dioxide and water. This is particularly advantageous in the petrochemical industry, where propylene is a key intermediate in the production of various plastics and chemicals. However, the use of N2O in ODHP also presents significant challenges, primarily related to catalyst stability and deactivation. The harsh reaction conditions can lead to the rapid deactivation of the catalyst, necessitating frequent regeneration or replacement, which can be costly and inefficient. Moreover, the decomposition of N2O can lead to the formation of nitrogen and oxygen, which can further complicate the reaction mechanism and reduce the overall efficiency of the process. To overcome these limitations and enable the practical implementation of N2O in ODHP, advanced research is needed to develop more stable and efficient catalysts, optimize reaction conditions, and improve the overall process economics. This includes the development of new catalyst formulations, the use of advanced reactor designs, and the integration of process intensification strategies to enhance the overall efficiency and sustainability of the process.
