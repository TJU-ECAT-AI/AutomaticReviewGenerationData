{"DOC": "N2O as an oxidant in ODHP enhances propylene selectivity over vanadia catalysts, attributed to a higher degree of VOx species reduction, crucial for high propylene yield. N2O's lower reoxidation ability reduces ODP activity but suppresses nonselective propene oxidation to COx. Unlike O2, N2O doesn't produce nonselective adsorbed oxygen species, enhancing selectivity. Catalysts like VOx/SiO2, VOx/MCM-41, and VOx/MCM-48 show that VOx species' polymerization degree influences consecutive propene oxidation. Primary C3H6 selectivity is higher with N2O, and consecutive C3H6 oxidation to COx is reduced. Catalyst deactivation and stability are challenges, requiring strategies to control active oxygen species and optimize conditions for selective species formation. Advanced research is essential to overcome limitations and make N2O-ODHP practical.", "Doi": "10.1021/jp070747c"},
{"DOC": "N2O as an oxidant in ODHP significantly enhances propylene selectivity and reduces CO2 yield, as evidenced by studies. Catalysts like NiMoO4 + -Sb2O4 and palladium on Zr-Ce-O oxides are employed, with N2O promoting molybdenum reduction and selectivity. Challenges include catalyst deactivation and stability, limiting practical application. Research should focus on developing stable catalysts, optimizing conditions, and understanding the role of -Sb2O4 and N2O in controlling selectivity and inhibiting non-selective sites, as suggested by studies showing similar effects on selectivity modulation.", "Doi": "10.1016/j.cattod.2004.03.005"},
{"DOC": "N2O is an efficient oxidant for ODHP over steam-activated Fe-zeolites (MFI, BEA), achieving initial propylene yields up to 25% at 723 K. Extraframework iron species, essential for activity, lead to deactivation by coke formation. FeZSM-5 exhibits high resistance to deactivation, unlike FeBEA, which deactivates rapidly. Steam activation is crucial for high catalytic activities. Highly active Fe-zeolites in N2O decomposition may have increased resistance to coke deactivation. Research should focus on enhancing catalyst stability and reducing deactivation for practical N2O-ODHP implementation.", "Doi": "10.1016/j.jcat.2004.02.005"},
{"DOC": "N2O in ODHP boosts propylene selectivity by preventing peroxovanadate formation, which reduces carbon oxide production. Catalyst deactivation, primarily due to vanadium reduction rather than carbon deposit, poses a significant challenge. Partial regeneration through N2O heating aids catalyst recovery, but full activity restoration requires oxygen reoxidation. Research should focus on developing stable catalysts, minimizing vanadium reduction, and optimizing regeneration techniques.", "Doi": "10.1016/j.jcat.2015.12.028"}
