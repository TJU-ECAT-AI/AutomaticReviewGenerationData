{"DOC": "N2O in ODHP enhances propylene selectivity vs. dioxygen, reducing over-oxidation. Iron-zeolites, notably calcined Fe-ZSM-5, are effective catalysts. Challenges include catalyst deactivation, exacerbated by propane's impact on N2O conversion, and coke deposition, limiting catalyst lifespan. Advanced research is needed to elucidate deactivation mechanisms and develop stable catalysts to optimize conditions and minimize coke formation.", "Doi": "10.1016/j.micromeso.2014.07.032"},
{"DOC": "N2O in ODHP boosts propylene selectivity by its less favorable decomposition compared to O2, reducing active sites and enhancing selectivity. High selectivity is achieved with fully covered vanadia species on the support. Optimizing active lattice oxygen concentration, crucial for selective oxidation, is better with N2O than O2, supporting its use in propylene production.", "Doi": "10.1016/S0926-860X(01)00836-5"},
{"DOC": "N2O in ODHP boosts propylene selectivity over O2, due to its weaker oxidizing potential that curbs direct propane and consecutive propene oxidation to COx. This results in lower catalytic activity as N2O less effectively re-oxidizes surface VOx species. Propylene selectivity is consistent between dispersed VOx and crystalline V2O5 nanoparticles with N2O, unlike with O2. N2O's benefit stems from reduced surface density of active lattice oxygen in VOx species, favoring propene formation over combustion at lower densities.", "Doi": "10.1016/j.jcat.2005.05.025"},
{"DOC": "N2O as an oxidant in ODHP boosts propylene selectivity up to three times compared to O2, particularly with bulk-like V2O5 catalysts. This is due to N2O's reduced ability to re-oxidize VOx species, leading to higher catalyst reduction. N2O minimizes direct propane combustion and consecutive propene oxidation to COx, enhancing initial propene selectivity. The nature of oxygen species from O2 and N2O significantly impacts selectivity and activity. Challenges in catalyst deactivation and stability necessitate advanced research for practical implementation.", "Doi": "10.1016/j.apcata.2006.11.021"},
{"DOC": "N2O as an oxidant in ODHP boosts propylene selectivity over O2, as studies on vanadia catalysts on alumina and silica show. N2O's ability to achieve a higher degree of reduction of vanadium species is key for high propene selectivity, though it results in lower ODP activity. The nature of oxygen species impacts COx formation, with N2O not producing nonselective adsorbed oxygen species that catalyze nonselective consecutive propene oxidation to COx. Catalysts like VOx/SiO2, VOx/MCM-41, and VOx/MCM-48 reveal that the degree of polymerization of VOx species affects consecutive propene oxidation. Challenges include catalyst deactivation and stability, which can be addressed by developing catalysts with controlled surface density of active oxygen species and optimizing reaction conditions. Research should focus on understanding oxygen species formation mechanisms and developing new catalyst formulations for high activity and selectivity under N2O-ODHP conditions.", "Doi": "10.1021/jp070747c"},
{"DOC": "N2O in ODHP significantly boosts propylene selectivity by 32% for pure NiMoO4 catalysts, as per quote 6, while reducing propane conversion. Molybdenum reduction under N2O, noted in quote 7, enhances selectivity. Challenges include decreased propane conversion and catalyst deactivation, limiting practical implementation. Research should focus on enhancing catalyst stability and activity, possibly through new catalysts or optimized reaction conditions, addressing the limitations highlighted in the context, as suggested by quote 11.", "Doi": "10.1016/j.cattod.2004.03.005"},
{"DOC": "N2O as an oxidant in ODHP over steam-activated Fe-zeolites (MFI, BEA) achieves high initial propylene yields. Catalyst deactivation, primarily due to coke formation, is a significant challenge. FeZSM-5 exhibits resistance to deactivation, unlike FeBEA. Extraframework iron species, generated by steam treatment, are essential for activity. Steam activation is crucial for high catalytic activities. FeZSM-5's mesopores, resulting from dealumination, may reduce pore blocking and improve reactant/product transport, slowing deactivation. Highly active Fe-zeolites in N2O decomposition may have increased resistance to coke deactivation. Advanced research is needed to address catalyst stability and deactivation for practical N2O-ODHP implementation.", "Doi": "10.1016/j.jcat.2004.02.005"},
{"DOC": "N2O in ODHP boosts propene selectivity by reoxidizing vanadium without forming reactive peroxovanadates, unlike O2. Catalyst deactivation, primarily due to vanadium reduction, is a major challenge. Partial activity restoration is possible through regeneration under N2O at high temperatures, with full recovery requiring O2. Research should focus on developing stable catalysts, optimizing conditions to prevent vanadium reduction, and refining regeneration techniques to make N2O-ODHP more practical.", "Doi": "10.1016/j.jcat.2015.12.028"}
