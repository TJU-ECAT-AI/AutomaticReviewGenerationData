<file-attachment-contents filename="Review A.txt"> 
The utilization of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) has been extensively studied, demonstrating its superiority in propylene selectivity over traditional oxidants like O2 \[10.1016/j.jcat.2010.06.010\]. N2O's unique properties, such as its ability to slow VOx reoxidation, limit COx formation, and promote selective oxidation, have been pivotal in enhancing propylene yield \[10.1016/j.cattod.2005.11.028\]. However, catalyst deactivation, primarily due to coke formation, remains a significant challenge \[10.1016/j.jcat.2004.02.005\]. Iron-zeolites, particularly Fe-ZSM-5, have shown promise in ODHP with N2O, achieving high propylene yields \[10.1016/j.ces.2004.07.035\]. Yet, the stability and reusability of these catalysts under N2O conditions require further investigation \[10.1016/j.jcat.2007.04.010\]. Advanced research is essential to address these limitations and make N2O-ODHP a more feasible option for practical implementation \[10.1021/acscatal.0c03999\_8\].
                    
                    Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: The use of N2O in ODHP presents a promising avenue for propylene production, offering higher selectivity and reduced COx formation compared to conventional oxidants. However, the challenge of catalyst deactivation, particularly through coke formation, necessitates innovative strategies for catalyst regeneration and stability enhancement. Future research should focus on developing catalysts with improved coke resistance and exploring methods for efficient regeneration under N2O conditions. Additionally, the optimization of N2O concentration and the integration of in situ regeneration techniques could significantly improve the practicality of N2O-ODHP. Advanced catalyst design, incorporating insights from mechanistic studies and utilizing advanced characterization techniques, is crucial for achieving stable and selective N2O-ODHP processes.

The utilization of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) has garnered significant attention due to its ability to boost propylene selectivity compared to traditional oxidants like molecular oxygen (O2) \[10.1016/j.jcat.2010.06.010\]. N2O's unique properties, such as its ability to inhibit O2 adsorption and promote catalyst reduction, make it a promising alternative for propylene production \[10.1016/S0920-5861(03)00120-2\]. The selective nature of N2O in ODHP is attributed to its capacity to dissociate oxygen in a manner that is less oxidizing than O2, thereby enhancing propylene yield \[10.1016/j.cattod.2004.09.043\]. This selectivity is further optimized by adjusting the concentration of N2O and incorporating promoters that can modulate the catalyst's performance \[10.1016/S0920-5861(03)00120-2\].

A variety of catalysts have been employed in N2O-ODHP, including iron-zeolites \[10.1016/j.ces.2004.07.035\], vanadia-based catalysts \[10.1016/j.jcat.2010.06.010\], and molybdenum-based catalysts \[10.1016/S0926-860X(03)00103-0\]. Among these, iron-zeolites have shown exceptional promise due to their ability to activate N2O and coordinate reactive oxygen species, leading to high propylene yields \[10.1016/j.ces.2004.07.035\]. However, the rapid deactivation of these catalysts, particularly due to coke formation, poses a significant challenge \[10.1016/j.jcat.2007.04.010\]. The deactivation rates vary among different iron-zeolites, with Fe-beta showing the highest susceptibility \[10.1016/j.ces.2004.07.035\]. Catalyst stability and deactivation are critical issues that need to be addressed for the practical implementation of N2O-ODHP \[10.1016/j.jcat.2010.06.010\].

To overcome these limitations, strategies such as temperature optimization, the development of coke-resistant catalysts, and efficient regeneration methods are being explored \[10.1021/ie0493863\]. Research is also focusing on understanding the mechanisms of coke formation and the role of active sites in the deactivation process \[10.1016/j.jcat.2007.04.010\]. The use of in situ techniques like temperature-programmed oxidation mass spectrometry (TEOM) and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) can provide insights into the deactivation pathways and aid in the design of more stable catalysts \[10.1016/j.jcat.2007.04.010\].

Moreover, the exploration of alternative oxidants and the optimization of N2O sources, such as the conversion of ammonia (NH3) to N2O, could potentially enhance the practicality of N2O-ODHP \[10.1021/ie0493863\]. Advanced research is needed to develop stable, selective catalysts that can withstand the harsh conditions of N2O-ODHP while maintaining high propylene selectivity \[10.1016/j.cattod.2004.09.043\].



Integrative Understanding and Prospective Outlook: The use of N2O in ODHP presents a promising avenue for propylene production, offering enhanced selectivity and reduced COx formation compared to traditional oxidants. However, the challenges of catalyst deactivation and stability, particularly due to coke formation, hinder its practical implementation. Advanced research is essential to address these limitations, focusing on the development of coke-resistant catalysts, efficient regeneration methods, and a deeper understanding of the deactivation mechanisms. The exploration of alternative oxidants and the optimization of N2O sources could also contribute to the feasibility of N2O-ODHP. Future research efforts might concentrate on the design of novel catalysts that can maintain high propylene selectivity under N2O conditions while exhibiting improved stability and reusability. Additionally, the integration of in situ techniques for real-time monitoring of catalyst performance and the development of cost-effective N2O sources could significantly advance the practicality of N2O-ODHP for industrial applications.
