The utilization of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) has been extensively studied, demonstrating its ability to boost propylene yield and selectivity compared to traditional oxidants like oxygen (O2) \[10.1016/S0920-5861(03)00120-2\]. N2O's unique properties, such as its capacity to curb O2 adsorption and aid in catalyst reduction, have been pivotal in enhancing the efficiency of ODHP processes \[10.1016/S0920-5861(03)00120-2\]. Across various catalysts, N2O has shown to significantly increase propylene selectivity, particularly by slowing down the reoxidation of vanadium oxides (VOx), which in turn reduces the formation of undesired COx byproducts \[10.1016/j.jcat.2010.06.010\]. This is particularly evident when using VOx/MCM-41, where N2O halves propane conversion while doubling propene selectivity compared to O2 at 10% conversion \[10.1016/j.jcat.2010.06.010\].

                    Despite these advantages, the use of N2O in ODHP is not without challenges. Catalyst deactivation, often due to coke formation, is a significant hurdle that limits the practical implementation of N2O-ODHP \[10.1016/j.ces.2004.07.035\]. Iron-based zeolites, such as Fe-ZSM-5, have been shown to excel in N2O-ODHP, yielding up to 24% propene, but they are also prone to rapid deactivation by coke, which impacts the overall yield \[10.1016/j.ces.2004.07.035\]. The deactivation process involves the loss of active sites, a decline in site quality, and reduced pore accessibility, all of which are detrimental to the catalyst's performance \[10.1016/j.ces.2004.07.035\]. Advanced research is thus essential to address these limitations and make N2O-ODHP a more viable option for industrial applications.

                    In situ studies, such as FTIR and TEOMGC, have been crucial in understanding the mechanisms of catalyst deactivation and regeneration \[10.1016/j.jcat.2007.04.010\]. These techniques have provided insights into the real-time monitoring of coke formation and have been instrumental in the development of strategies to enhance catalyst reusability \[10.1016/j.jcat.2007.04.010\]. However, there is still a need for further research to optimize the selective oxidation of propane over iron zeolites and to improve catalyst reusability post-regeneration \[10.1016/j.jcat.2007.04.010\].

                    
                    Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: The use of N2O in ODHP presents a promising avenue for enhancing propylene selectivity and yield, but the challenges of catalyst deactivation and stability must be addressed. Advanced research should focus on developing catalysts that are resistant to coke formation and optimizing conditions for selective oxidation. In situ regeneration techniques, such as those utilizing N2O, should be further explored to enhance catalyst reusability. Additionally, the development of novel catalysts that can maintain high activity and selectivity over extended periods is crucial. The optimization of N2O concentration and the synergistic use of N2O and O2 could also be investigated to improve the efficiency of the ODHP process. Future research should aim to understand the mechanisms of oxygen species formation from N2O and O2 and their impact on catalyst performance. This knowledge could lead to the design of more stable and selective catalysts for N2O-ODHP, potentially making it a more practical and economically viable process for propylene production.

The utilization of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) has garnered significant attention due to its ability to enhance propylene selectivity compared to traditional oxidants [\[10.1016/j.jcat.2010.06.010\]]. N2O's role in ODHP is multifaceted, as it slows the reoxidation of vanadium oxides (VOx), thereby reducing the formation of active oxygen species and curtailing the conversion of propene to carbon oxides [\[10.1016/j.jcat.2010.06.010\]]. This effect is particularly pronounced when the vanadium coverage is below a monolayer, with selectivity plummeting as V2O5 nanocrystallites dominate [\[10.1016/j.jcat.2010.06.010\]]. Non-lattice oxygen from O2 is more conducive to COx formation than N2O, which aids in maintaining higher propene selectivity [\[10.1016/j.jcat.2010.06.010\]]. 

When employing iron-zeolites as catalysts in propane ODHP, N2O's monooxygen role and iron's reactive oxygen coordination have been shown to boost propene selectivity, achieving yields comparable to top-performing vanadium and molybdenum catalysts [\[10.1016/j.ces.2004.07.035\]]. However, coke-induced deactivation, particularly in Fe-beta zeolites, significantly curbs the yield [\[10.1016/j.ces.2004.07.035\]]. Deactivation stems from the loss of active sites, a decline in site quality, and restricted pore access [\[10.1016/j.ces.2004.07.035\]]. 

In situ FTIR spectroscopy and temperature-programmed oxidation mass spectrometry (TEOMGC) have been instrumental in gaining insights into deactivation mechanisms [\[10.1016/j.jcat.2007.04.010\]]. Advanced research is imperative to address the limitations of N2O-ODHP, focusing on catalyst stability and deactivation [\[10.1016/j.ces.2004.07.035\], \[10.1016/j.jcat.2007.04.010\]].



Integrative Understanding and Prospective Outlook: The use of N2O in ODHP presents a promising avenue for enhancing propylene selectivity, yet the challenges of catalyst deactivation and stability remain significant hurdles. To advance the practical implementation of N2O-ODHP, future research should concentrate on developing catalysts with enhanced stability and resistance to coke formation. This could involve the synthesis of novel catalysts with tailored active sites and improved pore structures to prevent the accumulation of coke [\[10.1016/j.ces.2004.07.035\]]. 

Moreover, the optimization of reaction conditions, such as temperature and N2O concentration, is crucial for maximizing propylene yield while minimizing deactivation [\[10.1016/j.jcat.2010.06.010\]]. Advanced in situ spectroscopic techniques, such as FTIR and TEOMGC, should be employed to gain deeper insights into the deactivation mechanisms and guide the design of more robust catalysts [\[10.1016/j.jcat.2007.04.010\]]. 

Additionally, the exploration of alternative regeneration methods, such as the use of N2O for partial regeneration and oxygen for full activity restoration, could offer a pathway to mitigate catalyst deactivation [\[10.1016/j.jcat.2015.12.028\]]. Lastly, the development of cost-effective and scalable N2O sources is essential for the economic viability of N2O-ODHP [\[10.1016/j.cattod.2004.03.005\]]. By addressing these challenges, N2O-ODHP could potentially become a more feasible and sustainable alternative for propylene production.
