N2O avoids the production of nonselective adsorbed oxygen species that can catalyze nonselective consecutive propene oxidation to COx. The degree of polymerization of VOx species affects consecutive propene oxidation. Catalyst deactivation and stability, particularly with the formation of nonselective oxygen species, are challenges. Strategies to address these could involve optimizing catalyst structure for enhanced stability and selectivity, developing methods for catalyst regeneration, and exploring alternative oxidants that maintain high selectivity and activity while ensuring catalyst stability.", "Doi": "10.1021/jp070747c"},
{"DOC": "N2O as an oxidant in ODHP boosts propylene selectivity, reduces propane conversion and CO2 yield, and promotes molybdenum reduction for improved catalyst selectivity. Challenges involve catalyst deactivation and stability. Research suggests N2O inhibits oxygen adsorption on NiMoO4, promoting reduction and selectivity, which could be key to enhancing N2O-ODHP's practicality.", "Doi": "10.1016/j.cattod.2004.03.005"},
{"DOC": "N2O as an oxidant in ODHP over steam-activated Fe-zeolites (MFI, BEA) yields initial propylene up to 25%. Extraframework iron species, crucial for activity, lead to deactivation by coke formation. FeZSM-5 shows resistance against deactivation, unlike FeBEA. Initial propene yields over FeZSM-5 and FeBEA are higher than commercial zeolites, despite similar residual activities. Steam activation is essential for high catalytic activities. FeZSM-5's more open structure reduces pore blocking and improves reactant/product transport, slowing deactivation. Highly active Fe-zeolites in N2O decomposition have increased resistance to coke deactivation. Research is needed to address catalyst deactivation and improve stability for practical implementation.", "Doi": "10.1016/j.jcat.2004.02.005"},
{"DOC": "N2O in ODHP boosts propylene selectivity by avoiding peroxovanadate formation, which increases carbon oxide production. Catalyst deactivation, primarily due to vanadium reduction, is a significant issue, with carbon deposits playing a minor role. Partial regeneration is possible through N2O heating, but full activity restoration requires oxygen. Research should focus on developing stable catalysts, minimizing vanadium reduction, and optimizing regeneration techniques, as indicated by studies showing vanadium's reoxidation mechanism and the role of carbon deposits in deactivation.", "Doi": "10.1016/j.jcat.2015.12.028"}
