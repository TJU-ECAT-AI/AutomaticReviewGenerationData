                    The utilization of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) has been extensively studied, demonstrating its ability to boost propylene yield and selectivity compared to traditional oxidants like oxygen (O2) \[10.1016/S0920-5861(03)00120-2\]. N2O's unique properties, such as its capacity to curb O2 adsorption and aid in catalyst reduction, have been pivotal in enhancing the efficiency of ODHP processes \[10.1016/S0920-5861(03)00120-2\]. Across various catalysts, N2O has shown to significantly increase propylene selectivity, particularly by slowing down the reoxidation of vanadium oxides (VOx), which in turn reduces the formation of undesired COx byproducts \[10.1016/j.jcat.2010.06.010\]. This is particularly evident when using VOx/MCM-41, where N2O halves propane conversion while doubling propene selectivity compared to O2 at 10% conversion \[10.1016/j.jcat.2010.06.010\].

                    Despite these advantages, the use of N2O in ODHP is not without challenges. Catalyst deactivation, often due to coke formation, is a significant hurdle that limits the practical implementation of N2O-ODHP \[10.1016/j.ces.2004.07.035\]. Iron-based zeolites, such as Fe-ZSM-5, have been shown to excel in N2O-ODHP, yielding up to 24% propene, but they are also prone to rapid deactivation by coke, which impacts the overall yield \[10.1016/j.ces.2004.07.035\]. The deactivation process involves the loss of active sites, a decline in site quality, and reduced pore accessibility, all of which are detrimental to the catalyst's performance \[10.1016/j.ces.2004.07.035\]. Advanced research is thus essential to address these limitations and make N2O-ODHP a more viable option for industrial applications.

                    In situ studies, such as FTIR and TEOMGC, have been crucial in understanding the mechanisms of catalyst deactivation and regeneration \[10.1016/j.jcat.2007.04.010\]. These techniques have provided insights into the real-time monitoring of coke formation and have been instrumental in the development of strategies to enhance catalyst reusability \[10.1016/j.jcat.2007.04.010\]. However, there is still a need for further research to optimize the selective oxidation of propane over iron zeolites and to improve catalyst reusability post-regeneration \[10.1016/j.jcat.2007.04.010\].

                    Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: The use of N2O in ODHP presents a promising avenue for enhancing propylene selectivity and yield, but the challenges of catalyst deactivation and stability must be addressed. Advanced research should focus on developing catalysts that are resistant to coke formation and optimizing conditions for selective oxidation. In situ regeneration techniques, such as those utilizing N2O, should be further explored to enhance catalyst reusability. Additionally, the development of novel catalysts that can maintain high activity and selectivity over extended periods is crucial. The optimization of N2O concentration and the synergistic use of N2O and O2 could also be investigated to improve the efficiency of the ODHP process. Future research should aim to understand the mechanisms of oxygen species formation from N2O and O2 and their impact on catalyst performance. This knowledge could lead to the design of more stable and selective catalysts for N2O-ODHP, potentially making it a more practical and economically viable process for propylene production.

                    利用一氧化二氮（N2O）作为氧化剂在丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）中的应用已被广泛研究，显示出其与传统氧化剂如氧气（O2）相比，能够显著提高丙烯产量和选择性\[10.1016/S0920-5861(03)00120-2\]。N2O的独特性质，如其抑制O2吸附和辅助催化剂还原的能力，对于提高ODHP过程的效率至关重要\[10.1016/S0920-5861(03)00120-2\]。在各种催化剂中，N2O显著提高了丙烯选择性，特别是通过减缓五氧化二钒（VOx）的再氧化，从而减少了不希望的COx副产品的形成\[10.1016/j.jcat.2010.06.010\]。这一点在使用VOx/MCM-41时尤为明显，N2O将丙烷转化率减半，而丙烯选择性则翻倍，与O2在10%转化率下的效果相比\[10.1016/j.jcat.2010.06.010\]。

                    尽管有这些优势，但在ODHP中使用N2O并非没有挑战。催化剂失活，通常由于焦炭形成，是限制N2O-ODHP实际应用的重大障碍\[10.1016/j.ces.2004.07.035\]。基于铁的沸石，如Fe-ZSM-5，在N2O-ODHP中表现出色，丙烯产量高达24%，但它们也容易因焦炭快速失活，影响整体产量\[10.1016/j.ces.2004.07.035\]。失活过程涉及活性位点的损失、位点质量的下降和孔隙可及性的减少，所有这些都对催化剂性能有害\[10.1016/j.ces.2004.07.035\]。因此，进行高级研究以解决这些限制并使N2O-ODHP成为工业应用的更可行选择至关重要。

                    原位研究，如FTIR和TEOMGC，对于理解催化剂失活和再生机制至关重要\[10.1016/j.jcat.2007.04.010\]。这些技术为实时监测焦炭形成提供了见解，并在开发增强催化剂可重用性的策略中发挥了关键作用\[10.1016/j.jcat.2007.04.010\]。然而，仍需进一步研究以优化铁沸石上丙烷的有选择性氧化，并改善催化剂再生后的可重用性\[10.1016/j.jcat.2007.04.010\]。

                    ※※※
                    综合理解与未来展望：在ODHP中使用N2O为提高丙烯选择性和产量提供了一条有希望的途径，但必须解决催化剂失活和稳定性的问题。高级研究应侧重于开发抗焦炭形成的催化剂和优化选择性氧化条件。应进一步探索利用N2O的原位再生技术，以增强催化剂的可重用性。此外，开发能够在长时间内保持高活性和选择性的新型催化剂至关重要。优化N2O浓度和N2O与O2的协同使用也可以被调查，以提高ODHP过程的效率。未来的研究应旨在理解从N2O和O2形成的氧物种机制及其对催化剂性能的影响。这种知识可以导致设计更稳定和选择性的催化剂用于N2O-ODHP，可能使它成为丙烯生产中更实用和经济上可行的过程。
