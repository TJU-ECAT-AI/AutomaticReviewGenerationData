Strategies to address the limitations of catalyst deactivation and stability in N2O-ODHP include tailoring catalyst properties such as active phase, texture, diffusion length, and reaction conditions. The addition of a low amount of oxygen to the reaction mixture can minimize or suppress the formation of carbonaceous deposits. Chemical reaction engineering solutions, such as using dedicated reactors with catalyst moving from a reaction zone to a regeneration zone, can also be applied. A cyclically-operated process with parallel fixed-bed reactors has been demonstrated to maintain propene yields above 20% for extended periods by alternation of reaction and regeneration cycles. Further research is needed to understand the mechanism, nature, and location of coke formation to design measures to maintain the stability of the catalyst.

Various catalysts have been employed in the ODHP process with N2O as the oxidant, including vanadium oxides (V2O3, VO2, and V2O5) and vanadia-based materials supported on gamma-alumina (VOx/g-Al2O3) and MCM-41 (VOx/MCM-41). These catalysts show improved propylene selectivity when N2O is used instead of O2. The bulk and surface composition of the catalysts are influenced by the oxidant, with a higher degree of reduction observed in the presence of N2O.
