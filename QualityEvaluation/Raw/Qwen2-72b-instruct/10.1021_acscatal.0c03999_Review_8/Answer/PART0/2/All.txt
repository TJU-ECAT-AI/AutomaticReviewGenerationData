Based on this observation and taking into account the small change of CO2 selectivity with varying degree of propane conversion in Fig. 2(b), it is concluded that carbon dioxide is mainly formed via direct propane combustion but not via consecutive propene oxidation. The latter reaction contributes to the total CO2 production only at high degrees of propane conversion. When O2 is replaced by N2O, CO2 selectivity decreases in the studied range of propane conversions (Fig. 2(b)). The decrease in CO2 selectivity is explained by a reduced tendency towards direct propane combustion. This conclusion is based on the fact, that a near-to-zero CO2 selectivity is expected for a zero degree of propane conversion in the presence of N2O (Fig. 2(b)).

CO selectivity is very low (<5%) at zero C3H8 conversion but strongly increases with C3H8 conversion for both oxidants (N2O and O2). The obtained relationship indicates the secondary nature of CO formation,i.e. CO is formed via consecutive C3H6 oxidation. From Fig. 2(c) it is concluded that CO formation with O2 is stronger influenced by the degree of C3H8 conversion as compared to the tests with N2O. For an O2-containing feed, a relative difference in CO selectivity is 60% upon increasing C3H8 conversion from 0.6 to 9%, while the respective differencewith N2O is 20%.\"\n          [10] \"Summarizing the above discussion, it is concluded that catalytic performance and general scheme of the ODP reaction are determined by the applied oxidizing agent (O2 and N2O),but not by the initial composition of individual vanadium oxides.\"\n          [11] \"The results of steady-state ODP studies in Fig. 2 suggest a complex reaction scheme of parallel and consecutive steps for the ODP reaction using either O2 or N2O.

When O2 is replaced by N2O, CO2 selectivity decreases in the studied range of propane conversions (Fig. 2(b)). The decrease in CO2 selectivity is explained by a reduced tendency towards direct propane combustion. This conclusion is based on the fact, that a near-to-zero CO2 selectivity is expected for a zero degree of propane conversion in the presence of N2O (Fig. 2(b)). Upon increasing C3H8 conversion, CO2 selectivity increases, hence, CO2 is mainly formed via consecutive C3H6 oxidation when N2O is used as oxidizing agent.\"\n          [9] \"The selectivityconversion plot in Fig. 2(c) evidences that CO formation is stronger influenced by the degree of C3H8 conversion than CO2 formation. CO selectivity is very low (<5%) at zero C3H8 conversion but strongly increases with C3H8 conversion for both oxidants (N2O and O2). The obtained relationship indicates the secondary nature of CO formation,i.e. CO is formed via consecutive C3H6 oxidation. From Fig. 2(c) it is concluded that CO formation with O2 is stronger influenced by the degree of C3H8 conversion as compared to the tests with N2O. For an O2-containing feed, a relative difference in CO selectivity is 60% upon increasing C3H8 conversion from 0.6 to 9%, while the respective differencewith N2O is 20%.\"\n          [10] \"Summarizing the above discussion, it is concluded that catalytic performance and general scheme of the ODP reaction are determined by the applied oxidizing agent (O2 and N2O),but not by the initial composition of individual vanadium oxides.\"\n          [11] \"The results of steady-state ODP studies in Fig. 2 suggest a complex reaction scheme of parallel and consecutive steps for the ODP reaction using either O2 or N2O.

According to this scheme, the importance of direct (not via consecutive propene oxidation) propane oxidation to COx (mainly to CO2) is significantly higher in the presence of O2 than in N2O.

This is due to a consecutive C3H6 oxidation to CO and CO2. However, these non-selective reaction pathways are influenced by the nature of oxidizing agent. From the results in Fig. 2(a) it is clear that propene selectivity decreases with an increase in the degree of propane conversion stronger with O2 than with N2O. For an O2- containing reaction feed, C3H6 selectivity decreases from 77 to 15% upon increasing C3H8 conversion from 0.6 to 9%. For similar changes in the degree of C3H8 conversion in the presence of N2O, C3H6 selectivity drops only from 86 to 60%.\"\n          [8] \"The reaction pathways of CO and CO2 formation are also influenced by the nature of oxidizing agent. It is clearly seen from the selectivityconversion plot in Fig. 2(b) that CO2 selectivity only slightly changes with varying degree of C3H8 conversion when O2 is used as oxidizing agent. It increases from 15 to 20% upon increasing C3H8 conversion from 0.6 to 9%. About 13% CO2 selectivity is expected upon extrapolation to a zero degree of propane conversion. Based on this observation and taking into account the small change of CO2 selectivity with varying degree of propane conversion in Fig. 2(b), it is concluded that carbon dioxide is mainly formed via direct propane combustion but not via consecutive propene oxidation. The latter reaction contributes to the total CO2 production only at high degrees of propane conversion. When O2 is replaced by N2O, CO2 selectivity decreases in the studied range of propane conversions (Fig. 2(b)). The decrease in CO2 selectivity is explained by a reduced tendency towards direct propane combustion. This conclusion is based on the fact, that a near-to-zero CO2 selectivity is expected for a zero degree of propane conversion in the presence of N2O (Fig. 2(b)). Upon increasing C3H8 conversion, CO2 selectivity increases, hence, CO2 is mainly formed via consecutive C3H6 oxidation when N2O is used as oxidizing agent.\"\n          [9] \"The selectivityconversion plot in Fig. 2(c) evidences that CO formation is stronger influenced by the degree of C3H8 conversion than CO2 formation. CO selectivity is very low (<5%) at zero C3H8 conversion but strongly increases with C3H8 conversion for both oxidants (N2O and O2). The obtained relationship indicates the secondary nature of CO formation,i.e. CO is formed via consecutive C3H6 oxidation. From Fig. 2(c) it is concluded that CO formation with O2 is stronger influenced by the degree of C3H8 conversion as compared to the tests with N2O. For an O2-containing feed, a relative difference in CO selectivity is 60% upon increasing C3H8 conversion from 0.6 to 9%, while the respective differencewith N2O is 20%.\"\n          [10] \"Summarizing the above discussion, it is concluded that catalytic performance and general scheme of the ODP reaction are determined by the applied oxidizing agent (O2 and N2O),but not by the initial composition of individual vanadium oxides.\"\n          [11] \"The results of steady-state ODP studies in Fig. 2 suggest a complex reaction scheme of parallel and consecutive steps for the ODP reaction using either O2 or N2O. The scheme is presented in Fig. 8. According to this scheme, the importance of direct (not via consecutive propene oxidation) propane oxidation to COx (mainly to CO2) is significantly higher in the presence of O2 than in N2O. Hence, the catalytic performance is determined by the oxidant activation, since this is a necessary stage for the heterogeneous reactions of partial oxidation [8,26].\"\n          [12] \"Based on the above discussion, the degree of reduction of vanadium species (bulk and surface) is suggested to be a key factor influencing initial propene selectivity. However, the reduction degree is not the only catalyst property, which determines the catalyst ability for consecutive propene oxidation to COx. This conclusion is based on the fact that the reduction degree of vanadium species in V2O5 after the ODP reaction using C3H8/N2O/Ne = 40/40/20 and C3H8/O2/ Ne = 40/10/50 feeds is similar (Table 3) but the catalytic performance is different (Fig. 9, Table 4). The difference between O2- and N2O-containing ODP feeds in the catalytic performance of vanadium oxides (Fig. 2, Table 4) may be partially related to the nature of active oxygen species originating from O2. To support this assumption, we performed transient experiments with isotopically labeled 18O2 using a SSITKA (steady-state isotopic transient kinetic analysis) technique. The idea is to follow distribution of non-labeled (16O) oxygen (lattice oxygen of vanadium oxides) and labeled (18O) oxygen (adsorbed oxygen) in carbon dioxide. The results are presented and discussed below.\"\n          [13] \"The oxidizing agent tunes the catalytic performance of the studied vanadium oxides.
