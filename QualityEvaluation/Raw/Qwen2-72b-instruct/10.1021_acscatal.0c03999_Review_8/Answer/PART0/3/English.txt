Catalyst deactivation and stability are critical challenges in the ODHP process with N2O as the oxidant. The higher degree of reduction of vanadium species in the presence of N2O can lead to changes in the catalyst structure and composition, which may affect its stability and activity over time. Strategies to address these limitations include optimizing the catalyst formulation, improving the catalyst regeneration process, and developing more stable and active catalysts. Research directions could focus on understanding the role of different vanadium species in the ODHP reaction and developing catalysts with controlled reduction states to enhance propylene selectivity and stability.
