          [1] "Much research effort is currently devoted to the selective activation and functionalization of light alkanes (methane,ethane, propane, and butane) for obtaining petrochemicals directly or their respective olefinic feedstocks."
          [2] "Many studies have explored the catalytic oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) to propylene, a key building block in the petrochemical industry."
          [3] "Relatively complex multimetallic mixed oxides based on Vand Mo are considered as the most efficient catalysts in this reaction, with propene yields in the range of 1030% using O2 as the oxidant [1]."
          [4] "As recently reported by three independent research groups [25], a promising alternative system for ODHP arises from the application of iron zeolites using N2O as the oxidant, leading to remarkable propylene yields at a substantially lower operation temperature (643773 K) in comparison with the mixed metal oxides (823923 K)."
          [5] "The applied experimental condi- tions in [25] markedly differ with respect to temperature,feed composition, space velocity, and total pressure, so that a proper comparison between the various catalysts cannot be established."
          [6] "Besides, iron zeolites strongly deactivate during ODHP with N2O due to coke formation and it is unclear from these publications whether activities have been reported at a similar degree of deactivation and/or the same reaction time."
          [7] "The highest propylene yield was obtained over steam-activated Fe-ZSM-5 (22%), followed by the iron zeolites prepared by liquid-ion exchange (16%) and chemical vapor deposition (9%)."
          [8] "The positive effect of steaming on the catalytic performance of iron zeolites for different conver- sions involving N2O, including direct decomposition [15],benzene hydroxylation [14,16,17], and propane oxidation [4,5] has been previously reported."
          [9] "The time and degree of deactivation in Fig. 2 depend on the catalyst in question."
          [10] "The relatively fast deactivation of lie-Fe-Z can be attributed to the presence of a relatively high number of Brnsted acid sites in the sample."
          [11] "The samples prepared by liquid-ion exchange and chemical vapor deposition contain high iron loadings and a marked contribution of large iron oxide particles, where the total combustion of reaction intermediates leading to the olefin appears to be favored."
          [12] "The coking profiles of the calcined and steamed commercial zeolites are very similar, leading to a final coke amount of ca. 5% (Fig. 2)."
          [13] "The propylene yield is significantly higher in st-H-Z than in c-H-Z, although the propane conversion over both samples is rather similar (especially after 40 min on stream)."
          [14] "This striking result strongly suggests that an extremely low number of iron sites is responsible of the observed performance."
          [15] "The decrease in TOF is steepest at molar Fe/Al ratios <0.5."
          [16] "This result further emphasizes the severe Fe- underutilization in the synthesized iron zeolites and that iron impurities in H-ZSM-5 play a decisive role in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (OHDP) with N2O."
          [17] "The vital role of iron impurities in the catalytic performance of H-ZSM-5 for the oxidation of benzene to phenol (BTOP) with N2O has been extensively examined in the literature, originally by the group of Panov [17], and more recently in excellent works of Kuba nek et al. [16] and Jia et al. [14]."
          [18] "This reasoning can be extrapolated to the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane,as also explains the high propylene yields obtained by Bula nek et al. [5] over Fe-ZSM-5 with iron concentrations of 3001200 ppm."
          [19] "The current work has not specifically touched upon the role of acidity on the ODHP reaction, which may be important not only for the initial performance but also to understand and minimize catalyst deactivation."
          [20] "Our results show that deactivation is slower over the steam- activated zeolites (Fig. 2), with a significantly reduced number of Brnsted sites as a consequence of the steam treatment [21]."
          [21] "A high number of protonic acid sites should catalyze coke formation, thus accelerating the zeolite deactivation, as suggested from the results over lie- Fe-Z."
          [22] "It is likely that the presence of a certain amount of acidic groups coexisting with extraframework iron species is beneficial for the reaction."
          [23] "Further research is required to elucidate the role of acidity in ODHP."

          Nitrous oxide (N2O) has been identified as a promising oxidant for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) to produce propylene, a key petrochemical feedstock. Compared to traditional oxidants like oxygen, N2O allows for the production of propylene at lower temperatures, which can improve the efficiency and selectivity of the process. The use of N2O as an oxidant in ODHP has been shown to achieve remarkable propylene yields, particularly when iron zeolites are used as catalysts. These catalysts have been found to be effective at lower temperatures than those required for mixed metal oxide catalysts, which typically operate at higher temperatures. However, the performance of iron zeolites can vary significantly depending on the method of iron incorporation and the preparation technique. Steam activation of iron-substituted ZSM-5 zeolites has been shown to result in superior propylene yields compared to other preparation methods. Iron impurities in steamed commercial H-ZSM-5 zeolites have also been found to induce high propylene selectivity, leading to low COx formation. A major challenge in the use of N2O for ODHP is the deactivation of iron zeolite catalysts due to coke formation, which can limit the stability and lifetime of the catalyst. Strategies to address this limitation could include the development of more stable catalyst formulations, optimization of reaction conditions to minimize coke formation, and the use of in situ regeneration techniques to maintain catalyst activity. Research directions that could potentially make N2O-ODHP a more feasible option for practical implementation include the exploration of alternative iron sources and incorporation methods, the design of catalysts with enhanced resistance to deactivation, and the development of integrated process designs that incorporate catalyst regeneration steps.

          一氧化二氮(N2O)已被确定为一种有前景的氧化剂,用于丙烷的氧化脱氢(ODHP)以生产丙烯,丙烯是关键的石化原料。与氧气等传统氧化剂相比,N2O允许在较低温度下生产丙烯,这可以提高过程的效率和选择性。N2O作为氧化剂在ODHP中的应用已被证明能够实现显著的丙烯产量,尤其是在使用铁沸石作为催化剂时。这些催化剂已被发现能在比混合金属氧化物催化剂所需的温度低得多的温度下有效,混合金属氧化物催化剂通常在较高温度下运行。然而,铁沸石在ODHP中的性能可能因铁的掺入方法和制备技术而显著不同。铁取代的ZSM-5沸石的蒸汽活化已被证明与其它制备方法相比,能产生更优的丙烯产量。在蒸馏的商业H-ZSM-5沸石中发现的铁杂质也被发现能诱导高丙烯选择性,导致低COx形成。在N2O用于ODHP时的一个主要挑战是由于焦炭形成导致的铁沸石催化剂失活,这可能限制催化剂的稳定性和寿命。解决这一局限性的策略可能包括开发更稳定的催化剂配方、优化反应条件以最小化焦炭形成,以及使用原位再生技术以维持催化剂活性。可能使N2O-ODHP成为更可行的实用实施选项的研究方向包括探索替代铁源和掺入方法、设计具有增强抗失活性的催化剂,以及开发整合过程设计,将催化剂再生步骤纳入其中。
