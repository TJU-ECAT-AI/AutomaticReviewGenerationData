The remarkable performance of iron zeolites in ODHP is attributed to the specificity of N2O as a monooxygen donor and the capability of iron forms in the zeolite to coordinate reactive atomic oxygen species for efficient dehydrogenation of propane. However, a major drawback is the deactivation by coke formation, leading to a rapid decrease in propene yield. The rate of deactivation is reduced with an increase in temperature, and the relatively slow deactivation of FeZSM-5 at 773 K is associated with high N2O conversion. The use of O2 as an oxidant in ODHP over FeZSM-5 leads to very low C3H6 yields (<5%) compared to N2O. The addition of small amounts of O2 to the C3H8+N2O mixture results in a decrease in C3H6 selectivity and an increase in COx production. The intermediates essential for propene production are negatively impacted by the presence of O2, severely deteriorating the performance of FeZSM-5 in N2O-mediated ODHP of propane. Strategies to address the limitations of catalyst deactivation and stability in N2O-ODHP include optimizing the reaction temperature to reduce deactivation rates, developing catalysts with improved resistance to coke formation, and exploring methods to regenerate the catalysts more efficiently. Research directions could focus on understanding the mechanisms of coke formation and identifying catalysts with active sites that are less susceptible to deactivation.

The nature of oxygen species, whether adsorbed (nonlattice) or lattice, also influences COx formation. Adsorbed oxygen species are considered nonselective for the ODP reaction over certain catalysts. The redox dynamics of VOx species have been studied using in-situ UV/vis analysis, and the catalytic performance of different VOx/SiO2, VOx/MCM-41, and VOx/MCM-48 materials in the ODP reaction has been characterized. Nitrous oxide (N2O) has been found to be advantageous as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) compared to other oxidants like oxygen (O2). This is due to its ability to achieve higher propylene selectivity. The study of VOx/MCM-41, VOx/SiO2, and VOx/MCM-48 materials has shown that N2O can lead to a higher degree of reduction of vanadium species, which is essential for achieving high primary propylene selectivity and suppressing consecutive propylene oxidation to CO and CO2. The higher polymerized VOx species have a higher activity for consecutive propene oxidation, and the importance of direct propane oxidation and consecutive propene oxidation to COx is significantly higher in the presence of O2 than in N2O. The catalytic performance is determined by the oxidant activation, and N2O's lower oxidizing ability tunes the degree of reduction of vanadium species, leading to a higher reduction degree of VOx species. This effect is related to the spatial separation of active lattice oxygen species, reducing the surface density of active oxygen species. However, the degree of reduction of VOx species is not the only reason for the superior performance of N2O compared to O2. The nature of oxygen species also influences COx formation, with adsorbed (nonlattice) oxygen species being nonselective for the ODP reaction over certain catalytic materials. In contrast, N2O decomposition over reducible metal oxides yields mononuclear oxygen species, which are considered selective. The critical challenges associated with catalyst deactivation and stability in N2O-ODHP include the need for a high degree of reduction of vanadium species and the prevention of nonselective oxygen species formation. Strategies to address these limitations could involve the development of catalysts with controlled surface density of active oxygen species and the optimization of reaction conditions to favor selective oxygen species formation. Research directions could focus on understanding the mechanisms of oxygen species formation and their role in the selectivity of the ODHP process, as well as the development of new catalyst formulations that can maintain high activity and selectivity under N2O-ODHP conditions. Nitrous oxide (N2O) has been shown to have advantages over other oxidants in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP), particularly in terms of propylene selectivity. The use of N2O as an oxidant results in higher propylene selectivity compared to oxygen (O2) over a broad range of propane conversions. This effect is more pronounced for catalysts with microcrystalline V2O5. The improved selectivity is attributed to the ability of N2O to achieve a higher primary propene selectivity and to lower the activity for consecutive propene oxidation. N2O reoxidizes reduced VOx species slower than O2, which is essential for suppressing nonselective consecutive propene oxidation to COx. The nature of oxygen species also plays a role, with N2O not producing nonselective adsorbed oxygen species that can catalyze nonselective consecutive propene oxidation to COx. A variety of catalysts have been employed in the ODHP process, including VOx/SiO2, VOx/MCM-41, and VOx/MCM-48. These catalysts have been characterized using various techniques such as transmission electron microscopy (TEM), temperature-programmed reduction (TPR), UV/vis, Raman, and X-ray diffraction (XRD). The specific surface area of the catalysts decreases with vanadium loading, and the degree of polymerization of VOx species is influenced by the support material. The catalytic activity of the VOx(2.7)/MCM-41 catalyst is slightly higher than that of the VOx(2.8)/SiO2 and VOx(3.4)/MCM-48 samples, possibly due to a lower degree of polymerization of VOx species. The lowest activity was observed over the VOx(11.2)/MCM-41 sample, which possesses microcrystalline V2O5. Catalyst deactivation and stability are critical challenges in the ODHP process. The use of N2O as an oxidant can help mitigate these issues by reducing the formation of nonselective adsorbed oxygen species that can lead to catalyst deactivation. However, the lower activity of N2O compared to O2 can also be a limitation. Strategies to address these challenges include optimizing the catalyst structure and composition to enhance stability and selectivity, developing methods to regenerate deactivated catalysts, and exploring alternative oxidants that can provide high selectivity and activity while maintaining catalyst stability.", "Doi": "10.1021/jp070747c"},

oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) over alumina- and silica-supported vanadia catalysts compared to O2. However, the ODP activity with N2O is lower than with O2. The degree of reduction of VOx species is suggested to be important for achieving high propene selectivity. The nature of oxygen species, whether adsorbed (nonlattice) or lattice, also influences COx formation. Adsorbed oxygen species are considered nonselective for the ODP reaction over certain catalysts. The redox dynamics of VOx species have been studied using in-situ UV/vis analysis, and the catalytic performance of different VOx/SiO2, VOx/MCM-41, and VOx/MCM-48 materials in the ODP reaction has been characterized. Nitrous oxide (N2O) has been found to be advantageous as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) compared to other oxidants like oxygen (O2). This is due to its ability to achieve higher propylene selectivity. The study of VOx/MCM-41, VOx/SiO2, and VOx/MCM-48 materials has shown that N2O can lead to a higher degree of reduction of vanadium species, which is essential for achieving high primary propylene selectivity and suppressing consecutive propylene oxidation to CO and CO2. The higher polymerized VOx species have a higher activity for consecutive propene oxidation, and the importance of direct propane oxidation and consecutive propene oxidation to COx is significantly higher in the presence of O2 than in N2O. The catalytic performance is determined by the oxidant activation, and N2O's lower oxidizing ability tunes the degree of reduction of vanadium species, leading to a higher reduction degree of VOx species. This effect is related to the spatial separation of active lattice oxygen species, reducing the surface density of active oxygen species. However, the degree of reduction of VOx species is not the only reason for the superior performance of N2O compared to O2. The nature of oxygen species also influences COx formation, with adsorbed (nonlattice) oxygen species being nonselective for the ODP reaction over certain catalytic materials. In contrast, N2O decomposition over reducible metal oxides yields mononuclear oxygen species, which are considered selective. The critical challenges associated with catalyst deactivation and stability in N2O-ODHP include the need for a high degree of reduction of vanadium species and the prevention of nonselective oxygen species formation. Strategies to address these limitations could involve the development of catalysts with controlled surface density of active oxygen species and the optimization of reaction conditions to favor selective oxygen species formation. Research directions could focus on understanding the mechanisms of oxygen species formation and their role in the selectivity of the ODHP process, as well as the development of new catalyst formulations that can maintain high activity and selectivity under N2O-ODHP conditions. Nitrous oxide (N2O) has been shown to have advantages over other oxidants in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP), particularly in terms of propylene selectivity. The use of N2O as an oxidant results in higher propylene selectivity compared to oxygen (O2) over a broad range of propane conversions. This effect is more pronounced for catalysts with microcrystalline V2O5. The improved selectivity is attributed to the ability of N2O to achieve a higher primary propene selectivity and to lower the activity for consecutive propene oxidation. N2O reoxidizes reduced VOx species slower than O2, which is essential for suppressing nonselective consecutive propene oxidation to COx. The nature of oxygen species also plays a role, with N2O not producing nonselective adsorbed oxygen species that can catalyze nonselective consecutive propene oxidation to COx. A variety of catalysts have been employed in the ODHP process, including VOx/SiO2, VOx/MCM-41, and VOx/MCM-48. These catalysts have been characterized using various techniques such as transmission electron microscopy (TEM), temperature-programmed reduction (TPR), UV/vis, Raman, and X-ray diffraction (XRD). The specific surface area of the catalysts decreases with vanadium loading, and the degree of polymerization of VOx species is influenced by the support material. The catalytic activity of the VOx(2.7)/MCM-41 catalyst is slightly higher than that of the VOx(2.8)/SiO2 and VOx(3.4)/MCM-48 samples, possibly due to a lower degree of polymerization of VOx species. The lowest activity was observed over the VOx(11.2)/MCM-41 sample, which possesses microcrystalline V2O5. Catalyst deactivation and stability are critical challenges in the ODHP process. The use of N2O as an oxidant can help mitigate these issues by reducing the formation of nonselective adsorbed oxygen species that can lead to catalyst deactivation. However, the lower activity of N2O compared to O2 can also be a limitation. Strategies to address these challenges include optimizing the catalyst structure and composition to enhance stability and selectivity, developing methods to regenerate deactivated catalysts, and exploring alternative oxidants that can provide high selectivity and activity while maintaining catalyst stability.", "Doi": "10.1021/jp070747c"},

For an O2- containing reaction feed, C3H6 selectivity decreases from 77 to 15% upon increasing C3H8 conversion from 0.6 to 9%. For similar changes in the degree of C3H8 conversion in the presence of N2O, C3H6 selectivity drops only from 86 to 60%.\"\n          [8] \"The reaction pathways of CO and CO2 formation are also influenced by the nature of oxidizing agent.

It increases from 15 to 20% upon increasing C3H8 conversion from 0.6 to 9%. About 13% CO2 selectivity is expected upon extrapolation to a zero degree of propane conversion. Based on this observation and taking into account the small change of CO2 selectivity with varying degree of propane conversion in Fig. 2(b), it is concluded that carbon dioxide is mainly formed via direct propane combustion but not via consecutive propene oxidation. The latter reaction contributes to the total CO2 production only at high degrees of propane conversion. When O2 is replaced by N2O, CO2 selectivity decreases in the studied range of propane conversions (Fig. 2(b)). The decrease in CO2 selectivity is explained by a reduced tendency towards direct propane combustion. This conclusion is based on the fact, that a near-to-zero CO2 selectivity is expected for a zero degree of propane conversion in the presence of N2O (Fig. 2(b)). Upon increasing C3H8 conversion, CO2 selectivity increases, hence, CO2 is mainly formed via consecutive C3H6 oxidation when N2O is used as oxidizing agent.\"\n          [9] \"The selectivityconversion plot in Fig. 2(c) evidences that CO formation is stronger influenced by the degree of C3H8 conversion than CO2 formation. CO selectivity is very low (<5%) at zero C3H8 conversion but strongly increases with C3H8 conversion for both oxidants (N2O and O2). The obtained relationship indicates the secondary nature of CO formation,i.e. CO is formed via consecutive C3H6 oxidation. From Fig. 2(c) it is concluded that CO formation with O2 is stronger influenced by the degree of C3H8 conversion as compared to the tests with N2O. For an O2-containing feed, a relative difference in CO selectivity is 60% upon increasing C3H8 conversion from 0.6 to 9%, while the respective differencewith N2O is 20%.\"\n          [10] \"Summarizing the above discussion, it is concluded that catalytic performance and general scheme of the ODP reaction are determined by the applied oxidizing agent (O2 and N2O),but not by the initial composition of individual vanadium oxides.\"\n          [11] \"The results of steady-state ODP studies in Fig. 2 suggest a complex reaction scheme of parallel and consecutive steps for the ODP reaction using either O2 or N2O.

The difference between O2- and N2O-containing ODP feeds in the catalytic performance of vanadium oxides (Fig. 2, Table 4) may be partially related to the nature of active oxygen species originating from O2. To support this assumption, we performed transient experiments with isotopically labeled 18O2 using a SSITKA (steady-state isotopic transient kinetic analysis) technique.

to precisely define the nature of oxygen species originating from O2 and N2O over reduced VOx species.\"", "English": "Nitrous oxide (N2O) has been shown to increase propene selectivity in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) over alumina- and silica-supported vanadia catalysts compared to O2. However, the ODP activity with N2O is lower than with O2. The degree of reduction of VOx species is suggested to be important for achieving high propene selectivity. The nature of oxygen species, whether adsorbed (nonlattice) or lattice, also influences COx formation. Adsorbed oxygen species are considered nonselective for the ODP reaction over certain catalysts. The redox dynamics of VOx species have been studied using in-situ UV/vis analysis, and the catalytic performance of different VOx/SiO2, VOx/MCM-41, and VOx/MCM-48 materials in the ODP reaction has been characterized. Nitrous oxide (N2O) has been found to be advantageous as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) compared to other oxidants like oxygen (O2). This is due to its ability to achieve higher propylene selectivity. The study of VOx/MCM-41, VOx/SiO2, and VOx/MCM-48 materials has shown that N2O can lead to a higher degree of reduction of vanadium species, which is essential for achieving high primary propylene selectivity and suppressing consecutive propylene oxidation to CO and CO2. The higher polymerized VOx species have a higher activity for consecutive propene oxidation, and the importance of direct propane oxidation and consecutive propene oxidation to COx is significantly higher in the presence of O2 than in N2O. The catalytic performance is determined by the oxidant activation, and N2O's lower oxidizing ability tunes the degree of reduction of vanadium species, leading to a higher reduction degree of VOx species. This effect is related to the spatial separation of active lattice oxygen species, reducing the surface density of active oxygen species. However, the degree of reduction of VOx species is not the only reason for the superior performance of N2O compared to O2. The nature of oxygen species also influences COx formation, with adsorbed (nonlattice) oxygen species being nonselective for the ODP reaction over certain catalytic materials. In contrast, N2O decomposition over reducible metal oxides yields mononuclear oxygen species, which are considered selective. The critical challenges associated with catalyst deactivation and stability in N2O-ODHP include the need for a high degree of reduction of vanadium species and the prevention of nonselective oxygen species formation. Strategies to address these limitations could involve the development of catalysts with controlled surface density of active oxygen species and the optimization of reaction conditions to favor selective oxygen species formation. Research directions could focus on understanding the mechanisms of oxygen species formation and their role in the selectivity of the ODHP process, as well as the development of new catalyst formulations that can maintain high activity and selectivity under N2O-ODHP conditions. Nitrous oxide (N2O) has been shown to have advantages over other oxidants in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP), particularly in terms of propylene selectivity. The use of N2O as an oxidant results in higher propylene selectivity compared to oxygen (O2) over a broad range of propane conversions. This effect is more pronounced for catalysts with microcrystalline V2O5. The improved selectivity is attributed to the ability of N2O to achieve a higher primary propene selectivity and to lower the activity for consecutive propene oxidation. N2O reoxidizes reduced VOx species slower than O2, which is essential for suppressing nonselective consecutive propene oxidation to COx. The nature of oxygen species also plays a role, with N2O not producing nonselective adsorbed oxygen species that can catalyze nonselective consecutive propene oxidation to COx. A variety of catalysts have been employed in the ODHP process, including VOx/SiO2, VOx/MCM-41, and VOx/MCM-48. These catalysts have been characterized using various techniques such as transmission electron microscopy (TEM), temperature-programmed reduction (TPR), UV/vis, Raman, and X-ray diffraction (XRD). The specific surface area of the catalysts decreases with vanadium loading, and the degree of polymerization of VOx species is influenced by the support material. The catalytic activity of the VOx(2.7)/MCM-41 catalyst is slightly higher than that of the VOx(2.8)/SiO2 and VOx(3.4)/MCM-48 samples, possibly due to a lower degree of polymerization of VOx species. The lowest activity was observed over the VOx(11.2)/MCM-41 sample, which possesses microcrystalline V2O5. Catalyst deactivation and stability are critical challenges in the ODHP process. The use of N2O as an oxidant can help mitigate these issues by reducing the formation of nonselective adsorbed oxygen species that can lead to catalyst deactivation. However, the lower activity of N2O compared to O2 can also be a limitation. Strategies to address these challenges include optimizing the catalyst structure and composition to enhance stability and selectivity, developing methods to regenerate deactivated catalysts, and exploring alternative oxidants that can provide high selectivity and activity while maintaining catalyst stability.", "Doi": "10.1021/jp070747c"},

For an O2- containing reaction feed, C3H6 selectivity decreases from 77 to 15% upon increasing C3H8 conversion from 0.6 to 9%. For similar changes in the degree of C3H8 conversion in the presence of N2O, C3H6 selectivity drops only from 86 to 60%.\"\n          [8] \"The reaction pathways of CO and CO2 formation are also influenced by the nature of oxidizing agent.

It increases from 15 to 20% upon increasing C3H8 conversion from 0.6 to 9%. About 13% CO2 selectivity is expected upon extrapolation to a zero degree of propane conversion. Based on this observation and taking into account the small change of CO2 selectivity with varying degree of propane conversion in Fig. 2(b), it is concluded that carbon dioxide is mainly formed via direct propane combustion but not via consecutive propene oxidation. The latter reaction contributes to the total CO2 production only at high degrees of propane conversion. When O2 is replaced by N2O, CO2 selectivity decreases in the studied range of propane conversions (Fig. 2(b)). The decrease in CO2 selectivity is explained by a reduced tendency towards direct propane combustion. This conclusion is based on the fact, that a near-to-zero CO2 selectivity is expected for a zero degree of propane conversion in the presence of N2O (Fig. 2(b)). Upon increasing C3H8 conversion, CO2 selectivity increases, hence, CO2 is mainly formed via consecutive C3H6 oxidation when N2O is used as oxidizing agent.\"\n          [9] \"The selectivityconversion plot in Fig. 2(c) evidences that CO formation is stronger influenced by the degree of C3H8 conversion than CO2 formation. CO selectivity is very low (<5%) at zero C3H8 conversion but strongly increases with C3H8 conversion for both oxidants (N2O and O2). The obtained relationship indicates the secondary nature of CO formation,i.e. CO is formed via consecutive C3H6 oxidation. From Fig. 2(c) it is concluded that CO formation with O2 is stronger influenced by the degree of C3H8 conversion as compared to the tests with N2O. For an O2-containing feed, a relative difference in CO selectivity is 60% upon increasing C3H8 conversion from 0.6 to 9%, while the respective differencewith N2O is 20%.\"\n          [10] \"Summarizing the above discussion, it is concluded that catalytic performance and general scheme of the ODP reaction are determined by the applied oxidizing agent (O2 and N2O),but not by the initial composition of individual vanadium oxides.\"\n          [11] \"The results of steady-state ODP studies in Fig. 2 suggest a complex reaction scheme of parallel and consecutive steps for the ODP reaction using either O2 or N2O.

The difference between O2- and N2O-containing ODP feeds in the catalytic performance of vanadium oxides (Fig. 2, Table 4) may be partially related to the nature of active oxygen species originating from O2. To support this assumption, we performed transient experiments with isotopically labeled 18O2 using a SSITKA (steady-state isotopic transient kinetic analysis) technique.

to precisely define the nature of oxygen species originating from O2 and N2O over reduced VOx species.\"", "English": "Nitrous oxide (N2O) has been shown to increase propene selectivity in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) over alumina- and silica-supported vanadia catalysts compared to O2. However, the ODP activity with N2O is lower than with O2. The degree of reduction of VOx species is suggested to be important for achieving high propene selectivity. The nature of oxygen species, whether adsorbed (nonlattice) or lattice, also influences COx formation. Adsorbed oxygen species are considered nonselective for the ODP reaction over certain catalysts. The redox dynamics of VOx species have been studied using in-situ UV/vis analysis, and the catalytic performance of different VOx/SiO2, VOx/MCM-41, and VOx/MCM-48 materials in the ODP reaction has been characterized. Nitrous oxide (N2O) has been found to be advantageous as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) compared to other oxidants like oxygen (O2). This is due to its ability to achieve higher propylene selectivity. The study of VOx/MCM-41, VOx/SiO2, and VOx/MCM-48 materials has shown that N2O can lead to a higher degree of reduction of vanadium species, which is essential for achieving high primary propylene selectivity and suppressing consecutive propylene oxidation to CO and CO2. The higher polymerized VOx species have a higher activity for consecutive propene oxidation, and the importance of direct propane oxidation and consecutive propene oxidation to COx is significantly higher in the presence of O2 than in N2O. The catalytic performance is determined by the oxidant activation, and N2O's lower oxidizing ability tunes the degree of reduction of vanadium species, leading to a higher reduction degree of VOx species. This effect is related to the spatial separation of active lattice oxygen species, reducing the surface density of active oxygen species. However, the degree of reduction of VOx species is not the only reason for the superior performance of N2O compared to O2. The nature of oxygen species also influences COx formation, with adsorbed (nonlattice) oxygen species being nonselective for the ODP reaction over certain catalytic materials. In contrast, N2O decomposition over reducible metal oxides yields mononuclear oxygen species, which are considered selective. The critical challenges associated with catalyst deactivation and stability in N2O-ODHP include the need for a high degree of reduction of vanadium species and the prevention of nonselective oxygen species formation. Strategies to address these limitations could involve the development of catalysts with controlled surface density of active oxygen species and the optimization of reaction conditions to favor selective oxygen species formation. Research directions could focus on understanding the mechanisms of oxygen species formation and their role in the selectivity of the ODHP process, as well as the development of new catalyst formulations that can maintain high activity and selectivity under N2O-ODHP conditions. Nitrous oxide (N2O) has been shown to have advantages over other oxidants in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP), particularly in terms of propylene selectivity. The use of N2O as an oxidant results in higher propylene selectivity compared to oxygen (O2) over a broad range of propane conversions. This effect is more pronounced for catalysts with microcrystalline V2O5. The improved selectivity is attributed to the ability of N2O to achieve a higher primary propene selectivity and to lower the activity for consecutive propene oxidation. N2O reoxidizes reduced VOx species slower than O2, which is essential for suppressing nonselective consecutive propene oxidation to COx. The nature of oxygen species also plays a role, with N2O not producing nonselective adsorbed oxygen species that can catalyze nonselective consecutive propene oxidation to COx. A variety of catalysts have been employed in the ODHP process, including VOx/SiO2, VOx/MCM-41, and VOx/MCM-48. These catalysts have been characterized using various techniques such as transmission electron microscopy (TEM), temperature-programmed reduction (TPR), UV/vis, Raman, and X-ray diffraction (XRD). The specific surface area of the catalysts decreases with vanadium loading, and the degree of polymerization of VOx species is influenced by the support material. The catalytic activity of the VOx(2.7)/MCM-41 catalyst is slightly higher than that of the VOx(2.8)/SiO2 and VOx(3.4)/MCM-48 samples, possibly due to a lower degree of polymerization of VOx species. The lowest activity was observed over the VOx(11.2)/MCM-41 sample, which possesses microcrystalline V2O5. Catalyst deactivation and stability are critical challenges in the ODHP process. The use of N2O as an oxidant can help mitigate these issues by reducing the formation of nonselective adsorbed oxygen species that can lead to catalyst deactivation. However, the lower activity of N2O compared to O2 can also be a limitation. Strategies to address these challenges include optimizing the catalyst structure and composition to enhance stability and selectivity, developing methods to regenerate deactivated catalysts, and exploring alternative oxidants that can provide high selectivity and activity while maintaining catalyst stability.", "Doi": "10.1021/jp070747c"},

For an O2- containing reaction feed, C3H6 selectivity decreases from 77 to 15% upon increasing C3H8 conversion from 0.6 to 9%. For similar changes in the degree of C3H8 conversion in the presence of N2O, C3H6 selectivity drops only from 86 to 60%.\"\n          [8] \"The reaction pathways of CO and CO2 formation are also influenced by the nature of oxidizing agent.

It increases from 15 to 20% upon increasing C3H8 conversion from 0.6 to 9%. About 13% CO2 selectivity is expected upon extrapolation to a zero degree of propane conversion. Based on this observation and taking into account the small change of CO2 selectivity with varying degree of propane conversion in Fig. 2(b), it is concluded that carbon dioxide is mainly formed via direct propane combustion but not via consecutive propene oxidation. The latter reaction contributes to the total CO2 production only at high degrees of propane conversion. When O2 is replaced by N2O, CO2 selectivity decreases in the studied range of propane conversions (Fig. 2(b)). The decrease in CO2 selectivity is explained by a reduced tendency towards direct propane combustion. This conclusion is based on the fact, that a near-to-zero CO2 selectivity is expected for a zero degree of propane conversion in the presence of N2O (Fig. 2(b)). Upon increasing C3H8 conversion, CO2 selectivity increases, hence, CO2 is mainly formed via consecutive C3H6 oxidation when N2O is used as oxidizing agent.\"\n          [9] \"The selectivityconversion plot in Fig. 2(c) evidences that CO formation is stronger influenced by the degree of C3H8 conversion than CO2 formation. CO selectivity is very low (<5%) at zero C3H8 conversion but strongly increases with C3H8 conversion for both oxidants (N2O and O2). The obtained relationship indicates the secondary nature of CO formation,i.e. CO is formed via consecutive C3H6 oxidation. From Fig. 2(c) it is concluded that CO formation with O2 is stronger influenced by the degree of C3H8 conversion as compared to the tests with N2O. For an O2-containing feed, a relative difference in CO selectivity is 60% upon increasing C3H8 conversion from 0.6 to 9%, while the respective differencewith N2O is 20%.\"\n          [10] \"Summarizing the above discussion, it is concluded that catalytic performance and general scheme of the ODP reaction are determined by the applied oxidizing agent (O2 and N2O),but not by the initial composition of individual vanadium oxides.\"\n          [11] \"The results of steady-state ODP studies in Fig. 2 suggest a complex reaction scheme of parallel and consecutive steps for the ODP reaction using either O2 or N2O.

The difference between O2- and N2O-containing ODP feeds in the catalytic performance of vanadium oxides (Fig. 2, Table 4) may be partially related to the nature of active oxygen species originating from O2. To support this assumption, we performed transient experiments with isotopically labeled 18O2 using a SSITKA (steady-state isotopic transient kinetic analysis) technique.

to precisely define the nature of oxygen species originating from O2 and N2O over reduced VOx species.\"", "English": "Nitrous oxide (N2O) has been shown to increase propene selectivity in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) over alumina- and silica-supported vanadia catalysts compared to O2. However, the ODP activity with N2O is lower than with O2. The degree of reduction of VOx species is suggested to be important for achieving high propene selectivity. The nature of oxygen species, whether adsorbed (nonlattice) or lattice, also influences COx formation. Adsorbed oxygen species are considered nonselective for the ODP reaction over certain catalysts. The redox dynamics of VOx species have been studied using in-situ UV/vis analysis, and the catalytic performance of different VOx/SiO2, VOx/MCM-41, and VOx/MCM-48 materials in the ODP reaction has been characterized. Nitrous oxide (N2O) has been found to be advantageous as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) compared to other oxidants like oxygen (O2). This is due to its ability to achieve higher propylene selectivity. The study of VOx/MCM-41, VOx/SiO2, and VOx/MCM-48 materials has shown that N2O can lead to a higher degree of reduction of vanadium species, which is essential for achieving high primary propylene selectivity and suppressing consecutive propylene oxidation to CO and CO2. The higher polymerized VOx species have a higher activity for consecutive propene oxidation, and the importance of direct propane oxidation and consecutive propene oxidation to COx is significantly higher in the presence of O2 than in N2O. The catalytic performance is determined by the oxidant activation, and N2O's lower oxidizing ability tunes the degree of reduction of vanadium species, leading to a higher reduction degree of VOx species. This effect is related to the spatial separation of active lattice oxygen species, reducing the surface density of active oxygen species. However, the degree of reduction of VOx species is not the only reason for the superior performance of N2O compared to O2. The nature of oxygen species also influences COx formation, with adsorbed (nonlattice) oxygen species being nonselective for the ODP reaction over certain catalytic materials. In contrast, N2O decomposition over reducible metal oxides yields mononuclear oxygen species, which are considered selective. The critical challenges associated with catalyst deactivation and stability in N2O-ODHP include the need for a high degree of reduction of vanadium species and the prevention of nonselective oxygen species formation. Strategies to address these limitations could involve the development of catalysts with controlled surface density of active oxygen species and the optimization of reaction conditions to favor selective oxygen species formation. Research directions could focus on understanding the mechanisms of oxygen species formation and their role in the selectivity of the ODHP process, as well as the development of new catalyst formulations that can maintain high activity and selectivity under N2O-ODHP conditions. Nitrous oxide (N2O) has been shown to have advantages over other oxidants in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP), particularly in terms of propylene selectivity. The use of N2O as an oxidant results in higher propylene selectivity compared to oxygen (O2) over a broad range of propane conversions. This effect is more pronounced for catalysts with microcrystalline V2O5. The improved selectivity is attributed to the ability of N2O to achieve a higher primary propene selectivity and to lower the activity for consecutive propene oxidation. N2O reoxidizes reduced VOx species slower than O2, which is essential for suppressing nonselective consecutive propene oxidation to COx. The nature of oxygen species also plays a role, with N2O not producing nonselective adsorbed oxygen species that can catalyze nonselective consecutive propene oxidation to COx. A variety of catalysts have been employed in the ODHP process, including VOx/SiO2, VOx/MCM-41, and VOx/MCM-48. These catalysts have been characterized using various techniques such as transmission electron microscopy (TEM), temperature-programmed reduction (TPR), UV/vis, Raman, and X-ray diffraction (XRD). The specific surface area of the catalysts decreases with vanadium loading, and the degree of polymerization of VOx species is influenced by the support material. The catalytic activity of the VOx(2.7)/MCM-41 catalyst is slightly higher than that of the VOx(2.8)/SiO2 and VOx(3.4)/MCM-48 samples, possibly due to a lower degree of polymerization of VOx species. The lowest activity was observed over the VOx(11.2)/MCM-41 sample, which possesses microcrystalline V2O5. Catalyst deactivation and stability are critical challenges in the ODHP process. The use of N2O as an oxidant can help mitigate these issues by reducing the formation of nonselective adsorbed oxygen species that can lead to catalyst deactivation. However, the lower activity of N2O compared to O2 can also be a limitation. Strategies to address these challenges include optimizing the catalyst structure and composition to enhance stability and selectivity, developing methods to regenerate deactivated catalysts, and exploring alternative oxidants that can provide high selectivity and activity while maintaining catalyst stability.", "Doi": "10.1021/jp070747c"},

For an O2- containing reaction feed, C3H6 selectivity decreases from 77 to 15% upon increasing C3H8 conversion from 0.6 to 9%. For similar changes in the degree of C3H8 conversion in the presence of N2O, C3H6 selectivity drops only from 86 to 60%.\"\n          [8] \"The reaction pathways of CO and CO2 formation are also influenced by the nature of oxidizing agent.

It increases from 15 to 20% upon increasing C3H8 conversion from 0.6 to 9%. About 13% CO2 selectivity is expected upon extrapolation to a zero degree of propane conversion. Based on this observation and taking into account the small change of CO2 selectivity with varying degree of propane conversion in Fig. 2(b), it is concluded that carbon dioxide is mainly formed via direct propane combustion but not via consecutive propene oxidation. The latter reaction contributes to the total CO2 production only at high degrees of propane conversion. When O2 is replaced by N2O, CO2 selectivity decreases in the studied range of propane conversions (Fig. 2(b)). The decrease in CO2 selectivity is explained by a reduced tendency towards direct propane combustion. This conclusion is based on the fact, that a near-to-zero CO2 selectivity is expected for a zero degree of propane conversion in the presence of N2O (Fig. 2(b)). Upon increasing C3H8 conversion, CO2 selectivity increases, hence, CO2 is mainly formed via consecutive C3H6 oxidation when N2O is used as oxidizing agent.\"\n          [9] \"The selectivityconversion plot in Fig. 2(c) evidences that CO formation is stronger influenced by the degree of C3H8 conversion than CO2 formation. CO selectivity is very low (<5%) at zero C3H8 conversion but strongly increases with C3H8 conversion for both oxidants (N2O and O2). The obtained relationship indicates the secondary nature of CO formation,i.e. CO is formed via consecutive C3H6 oxidation. From Fig. 2(c) it is concluded that CO formation with O2 is stronger influenced by the degree of C3H8 conversion as compared to the tests with N2O. For an O2-containing feed, a relative difference in CO selectivity is 60% upon increasing C3H8 conversion from 0.6 to 9%, while the respective differencewith N2O is 20%.\"\n          [10] \"Summarizing the above discussion, it is concluded that catalytic performance and general scheme of the ODP reaction are determined by the applied oxidizing agent (O2 and N2O),but not by the initial composition of individual vanadium oxides.\"\n          [11] \"The results of steady-state ODP studies in Fig. 2 suggest a complex reaction scheme of parallel and consecutive steps for the ODP reaction using either O2 or N2O.

The difference between O2- and N2O-containing ODP feeds in the catalytic performance of vanadium oxides (Fig. 2, Table 4) may be partially related to the nature of active oxygen species originating from O2. To support this assumption, we performed transient experiments with isotopically labeled 18O2 using a SSITKA (steady-state isotopic transient kinetic analysis) technique.

to precisely define the nature of oxygen species originating from O2 and N2O over reduced VOx species.\"", "English": "Nitrous oxide (N2O) has been shown to increase propene selectivity in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) over alumina- and silica-supported vanadia catalysts compared to O2. However, the ODP activity with N2O is lower than with O2. The degree of reduction of VOx species is suggested to be important for achieving high propene selectivity. The nature of oxygen species, whether adsorbed (nonlattice) or lattice, also influences COx formation. Adsorbed oxygen species are considered nonselective for the ODP reaction over certain catalysts. The redox dynamics of VOx species have been studied using in-situ UV/vis analysis, and the catalytic performance of different VOx/SiO2, VOx/MCM-41, and VOx/MCM-48 materials in the ODP reaction has been characterized. Nitrous oxide (N2O) has been found to be advantageous as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) compared to other oxidants like oxygen (O2). This is due to its ability to achieve higher propylene selectivity. The study of VOx/MCM-41, VOx/SiO2, and VOx/MCM-48 materials has shown that N2O can lead to a higher degree of reduction of vanadium species, which is essential for achieving high primary propylene selectivity and suppressing consecutive propylene oxidation to CO and CO2. The higher polymerized VOx species have a higher activity for consecutive propene oxidation, and the importance of direct propane oxidation and consecutive propene oxidation to COx is significantly higher in the presence of O2 than in N2O. The catalytic performance is determined by the oxidant activation, and N2O's lower oxidizing ability tunes the degree of reduction of vanadium species, leading to a higher reduction degree of VOx species. This effect is related to the spatial separation of active lattice oxygen species, reducing the surface density of active oxygen species. However, the degree of reduction of VOx species is not the only reason for the superior performance of N2O compared to O2. The nature of oxygen species also influences COx formation, with adsorbed (nonlattice) oxygen species being nonselective for the ODP reaction over certain catalytic materials. In contrast, N2O decomposition over reducible metal oxides yields mononuclear oxygen species, which are considered selective. The critical challenges associated with catalyst deactivation and stability in N2O-ODHP include the need for a high degree of reduction of vanadium species and the prevention of nonselective oxygen species formation. Strategies to address these limitations could involve the development of catalysts with controlled surface density of active oxygen species and the optimization of reaction conditions to favor selective oxygen species formation. Research directions could focus on understanding the mechanisms of oxygen species formation and their role in the selectivity of the ODHP process, as well as the development of new catalyst formulations that can maintain high activity and selectivity under N2O-ODHP conditions. Nitrous oxide (N2O) has been shown to have advantages over other oxidants in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP), particularly in terms of propylene selectivity. The use of N2O as an oxidant results in higher propylene selectivity compared to oxygen (O2) over a broad range of propane conversions. This effect is more pronounced for catalysts with microcrystalline V2O5. The improved selectivity is attributed to the ability of N2O to achieve a higher primary propene selectivity and to lower the activity for consecutive propene oxidation. N2O reoxidizes reduced VOx species slower than O2, which is essential for suppressing nonselective consecutive propene oxidation to COx. The nature of oxygen species also plays a role, with N2O not producing nonselective adsorbed oxygen species that can catalyze nonselective consecutive propene oxidation to COx. A variety of catalysts have been employed in the ODHP process, including VOx/SiO2, VOx/MCM-41, and VOx/MCM-48. These catalysts have been characterized using various techniques such as transmission electron microscopy (TEM), temperature-programmed reduction (TPR), UV/vis, Raman, and X-ray diffraction (XRD). The specific surface area of the catalysts decreases with vanadium loading, and the degree of polymerization of VOx species is influenced by the support material. The catalytic activity of the VOx(2.7)/MCM-41 catalyst is slightly higher than that of the VOx(2.8)/SiO2 and VOx(3.4)/MCM-48 samples, possibly due to a lower degree of polymerization of VOx species. The lowest activity was observed over the VOx(11.2)/MCM-41 sample, which possesses microcrystalline V2O5. Catalyst deactivation and stability are critical challenges in the ODHP process. The use of N2O as an oxidant can help mitigate these issues by reducing the formation of nonselective adsorbed oxygen species that can lead to catalyst deactivation. However, the lower activity of N2O compared to O2 can also be a limitation. Strategies to address these challenges include optimizing the catalyst structure and composition to enhance stability and selectivity, developing methods to regenerate deactivated catalysts, and exploring alternative oxidants that can provide high selectivity and activity while maintaining catalyst stability.", "Doi": "10.1021/jp070747c"},

For an O2- containing reaction feed, C3H6 selectivity decreases from 77 to 15% upon increasing C3H8 conversion from 0.6 to 9%. For similar changes in the degree of C3H8 conversion in the presence of N2O, C3H6 selectivity drops only from 86 to 60%.\"\n          [8] \"The reaction pathways of CO and CO2 formation are also influenced by the nature of oxidizing agent.

It increases from 15 to 20% upon increasing C3H8 conversion from 0.6 to 9%. About 13% CO2 selectivity is expected upon extrapolation to a zero degree of propane conversion. Based on this observation and taking into account the small change of CO2 selectivity with varying degree of propane conversion in Fig. 2(b), it is concluded that carbon dioxide is mainly formed via direct propane combustion but not via consecutive propene oxidation. The latter reaction contributes to the total CO2 production only at high degrees of propane conversion. When O2 is replaced by N2O, CO2 selectivity decreases in the studied range of propane conversions (Fig. 2(b)). The decrease in CO2 selectivity is explained by a reduced tendency towards direct propane combustion. This conclusion is based on the fact, that a near-to-zero CO2 selectivity is expected for a zero degree of propane conversion in the presence of N2O (Fig. 2(b)). Upon increasing C3H8 conversion, CO2 selectivity increases, hence, CO2 is mainly formed via consecutive C3H6 oxidation when N2O is used as oxidizing agent.\"\n          [9] \"The selectivityconversion plot in Fig. 2(c) evidences that CO formation is stronger influenced by the degree of C3H8 conversion than CO2 formation. CO selectivity is very low (<5%) at zero C3H8 conversion but strongly increases with C3H8 conversion for both oxidants (N2O and O2). The obtained relationship indicates the secondary nature of CO formation,i.e. CO is formed via consecutive C3H6 oxidation. From Fig. 2(c) it is concluded that CO formation with O2 is stronger influenced by the degree of C3H8 conversion as compared to the tests with N2O. For an O2-containing feed, a relative difference in CO selectivity is 60% upon increasing C3H8 conversion from 0.6 to 9%, while the respective differencewith N2O is 20%.\"\n          [10] \"Summarizing the above discussion, it is concluded that catalytic performance and general scheme of the ODP reaction are determined by the applied oxidizing agent (O2 and N2O),but not by the initial composition of individual vanadium oxides.\"\n          [11] \"The results of steady-state ODP studies in Fig. 2 suggest a complex reaction scheme of parallel and consecutive steps for the ODP reaction using either O2 or N2O.

The difference between O2- and N2O-containing ODP feeds in the catalytic performance of vanadium oxides (Fig. 2, Table 4) may be partially related to the nature of active oxygen species originating from O2. To support this assumption, we performed transient experiments with isotopically labeled 18O2 using a SSITKA (steady-state isotopic transient kinetic analysis) technique.

to precisely define the nature of oxygen species originating from O2 and N2O over reduced VOx species.\"", "English": "Nitrous oxide (N2O) has been shown to increase propene selectivity in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) over alumina- and silica-supported vanadia catalysts compared to O2. However, the ODP activity with N2O is lower than with O2. The degree of reduction of VOx species is suggested to be important for achieving high propene selectivity. The nature of oxygen species, whether adsorbed (nonlattice) or lattice, also influences COx formation. Adsorbed oxygen species are considered nonselective for the ODP reaction over certain catalysts. The redox dynamics of VOx species have been studied using in-situ UV/vis analysis, and the catalytic performance of different VOx/SiO2, VOx/MCM-41, and VOx/MCM-48 materials in the ODP reaction has been characterized. Nitrous oxide (N2O) has been found to be advantageous as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) compared to other oxidants like oxygen (O2). This is due to its ability to achieve higher propylene selectivity. The study of VOx/MCM-41, VOx/SiO2, and VOx/MCM-48 materials has shown that N2O can lead to a higher degree of reduction of vanadium species, which is essential for achieving high primary propylene selectivity and suppressing consecutive propylene oxidation to CO and CO2. The higher polymerized VOx species have a higher activity for consecutive propene oxidation, and the importance of direct propane oxidation and consecutive propene oxidation to COx is significantly higher in the presence of O2 than in N2O. The catalytic performance is determined by the oxidant activation, and N2O's lower oxidizing ability tunes the degree of reduction of vanadium species, leading to a higher reduction degree of VOx species. This effect is related to the spatial separation of active lattice oxygen species, reducing the surface density of active oxygen species. However, the degree of reduction of VOx species is not the only reason for the superior performance of N2O compared to O2. The nature of oxygen species also influences COx formation, with adsorbed (nonlattice) oxygen species being nonselective for the ODP reaction over certain catalytic materials. In contrast, N2O decomposition over reducible metal oxides yields mononuclear oxygen species, which are considered selective. The critical challenges associated with catalyst deactivation and stability in N2O-ODHP include the need for a high degree of reduction of vanadium species and the prevention of nonselective oxygen species formation. Strategies to address these limitations could involve the development of catalysts with controlled surface density of active oxygen species and the optimization of reaction conditions to favor selective oxygen species formation. Research directions could focus on understanding the mechanisms of oxygen species formation and their role in the selectivity of the ODHP process, as well as the development of new catalyst formulations that can maintain high activity and selectivity under N2O-ODHP conditions. Nitrous oxide (N2O) has been shown to have advantages over other oxidants in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP), particularly in terms of propylene selectivity. The use of N2O as an oxidant results in higher propylene selectivity compared to oxygen (O2) over a broad range of propane conversions. This effect is more pronounced for catalysts with microcrystalline V2O5. The improved selectivity is attributed to the ability of N2O to achieve a higher primary propene selectivity and to lower the activity for consecutive propene oxidation. N2O reoxidizes reduced VOx species slower than O2, which is essential for suppressing nonselective consecutive propene oxidation to COx. The nature of oxygen species also plays a role, with N2O not producing nonselective adsorbed oxygen species that can catalyze nonselective consecutive propene oxidation to COx. A variety of catalysts have been employed in the ODHP process, including VOx/SiO2, VOx/MCM-41, and VOx/MCM-48. These catalysts have been characterized using various techniques such as transmission electron microscopy (TEM), temperature-programmed reduction (TPR), UV/vis, Raman, and X-ray diffraction (XRD). The specific surface area of the catalysts decreases with vanadium loading, and the degree of polymerization of VOx species is influenced by the support material. The catalytic activity of the VOx(2.7)/MCM-41 catalyst is slightly higher than that of the VOx(2.8)/SiO2 and VOx(3.4)/MCM-48 samples, possibly due to a lower degree of polymerization of VOx species. The lowest activity was observed over the VOx(11.2)/MCM-41 sample, which possesses microcrystalline V2O5. Catalyst deactivation and stability are critical challenges in the ODHP process. The use of N2O as an oxidant can help mitigate these issues by reducing the formation of nonselective adsorbed oxygen species that can lead to catalyst deactivation. However, the lower activity of N2O compared to O2 can also be a limitation. Strategies to address these challenges include optimizing the catalyst structure and composition to enhance stability and selectivity, developing methods to regenerate deactivated catalysts, and exploring alternative oxidants that can provide high selectivity and activity while maintaining catalyst stability.", "Doi": "10.1021/jp070747c"},

For an O2- containing reaction feed, C3H6 selectivity decreases from 77 to 15% upon increasing C3H8 conversion from 0.6 to 9%. For similar changes in the degree of C3H8 conversion in the presence of N2O, C3H6 selectivity drops only from 86 to 60%.\"\n          [8] \"The reaction pathways of CO and CO2 formation are also influenced by the nature of oxidizing agent.

It increases from 15 to 20% upon increasing C3H8 conversion from 0.6 to 9%. About 13% CO2 selectivity is expected upon extrapolation to a zero degree of propane conversion. Based on this observation and taking into account the small change of CO2 selectivity with varying degree of propane conversion in Fig. 2(b), it is concluded that carbon dioxide is mainly formed via direct propane combustion but not via consecutive propene oxidation. The latter reaction contributes to the total CO2 production only at high degrees of propane conversion. When O2 is replaced by N2O, CO2 selectivity decreases in the studied range of propane conversions (Fig. 2(b)). The decrease in CO2 selectivity is explained by a reduced tendency towards direct propane combustion. This conclusion is based on the fact, that a near-to-zero CO2 selectivity is expected for a zero degree of propane conversion in the presence of N2O (Fig. 2(b)). Upon increasing C3H8 conversion, CO2 selectivity increases, hence, CO2 is mainly formed via consecutive C3H6 oxidation when N2O is used as oxidizing agent.\"\n          [9] \"The selectivityconversion plot in Fig. 2(c) evidences that CO formation is stronger influenced by the degree of C3H8 conversion than CO2 formation. CO selectivity is very low (<5%) at zero C3H8 conversion but strongly increases with C3H8 conversion for both oxidants (N2O and O2). The obtained relationship indicates the secondary nature of CO formation,i.e. CO is formed via consecutive C3H6 oxidation. From Fig. 2(c) it is concluded that CO formation with O2 is stronger influenced by the degree of C3H8 conversion as compared to the tests with N2O. For an O2-containing feed, a relative difference in CO selectivity is 60% upon increasing C3H8 conversion from 0.6 to 9%, while the respective differencewith N2O is 20%.\"\n          [10] \"Summarizing the above discussion, it is concluded that catalytic performance and general scheme of the ODP reaction are determined by the applied oxidizing agent (O2 and N2O),but not by the initial composition of individual vanadium oxides.\"\n          [11] \"The results of steady-state ODP studies in Fig. 2 suggest a complex reaction scheme of parallel and consecutive steps for the ODP reaction using either O2 or N2O.

The difference between O2- and N2O-containing ODP feeds in the catalytic performance of vanadium oxides (Fig. 2, Table 4) may be partially related to the nature of active oxygen species originating from O2. To support this assumption, we performed transient experiments with isotopically labeled 18O2 using a SSITKA (steady-state isotopic transient kinetic analysis) technique.

to precisely define the nature of oxygen species originating from O2 and N2O over reduced VOx species.\"", "English": "Nitrous oxide (N2O) has been shown to increase propene selectivity in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) over alumina- and silica-supported vanadia catalysts compared to O2. However, the ODP activity with N2O is lower than with O2. The degree of reduction of VOx species is suggested to be important for achieving high propene selectivity. The nature of oxygen species, whether adsorbed (nonlattice) or lattice, also influences COx formation. Adsorbed oxygen species are considered nonselective for the ODP reaction over certain catalysts. The redox dynamics of VOx species have been studied using in-situ UV/vis analysis, and the catalytic performance of different VOx/SiO2, VOx/MCM-41, and VOx/MCM-48 materials in the ODP reaction has been characterized. Nitrous oxide (N2O) has been found to be advantageous as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) compared to other oxidants like oxygen (O2). This is due to its ability to achieve higher propylene selectivity. The study of VOx/MCM-41, VOx/SiO2, and VOx/MCM-48 materials has shown that N2O can lead to a higher degree of reduction of vanadium species, which is essential for achieving high primary propylene selectivity and suppressing consecutive propylene oxidation to CO and CO2. The higher polymerized VOx species have a higher activity for consecutive propene oxidation, and the importance of direct propane oxidation and consecutive propene oxidation to COx is significantly higher in the presence of O2 than in N2O. The catalytic performance is determined by the oxidant activation, and N2O's lower oxidizing ability tunes the degree of reduction of vanadium species, leading to a higher reduction degree of VOx species. This effect is related to the spatial separation of active lattice oxygen species, reducing the surface density of active oxygen species. However, the degree of reduction of VOx species is not the only reason for the superior performance of N2O compared to O2. The nature of oxygen species also influences COx formation, with adsorbed (nonlattice) oxygen species being nonselective for the ODP reaction over certain catalytic materials. In contrast, N2O decomposition over reducible metal oxides yields mononuclear oxygen species, which are considered selective. The critical challenges associated with catalyst deactivation and stability in N2O-ODHP include the need for a high degree of reduction of vanadium species and the prevention of nonselective oxygen species formation. Strategies to address these limitations could involve the development of catalysts with controlled surface density of active oxygen species and the optimization of reaction conditions to favor selective oxygen species formation. Research directions could focus on understanding the mechanisms of oxygen species formation and their role in the selectivity of the ODHP process, as well as the development of new catalyst formulations that can maintain high activity and selectivity under N2O-ODHP conditions. Nitrous oxide (N2O) has been shown to have advantages over other oxidants in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP), particularly in terms of propylene selectivity. The use of N2O as an oxidant results in higher propylene selectivity compared to oxygen (O2) over a broad range of propane conversions. This effect is more pronounced for catalysts with microcrystalline V2O5. The improved selectivity is attributed to the ability of N2O to achieve a higher primary propene selectivity and to lower the activity for consecutive propene oxidation. N2O reoxidizes reduced VOx species slower than O2, which is essential for suppressing nonselective consecutive propene oxidation to COx. The nature of oxygen species also plays a role, with N2O not producing nonselective adsorbed oxygen species that can catalyze nonselective consecutive propene oxidation to COx. A variety of catalysts have been employed in the ODHP process, including VOx/SiO2, VOx/MCM-41, and VOx/MCM-48. These catalysts have been characterized using various techniques such as transmission electron microscopy (TEM), temperature-programmed reduction (TPR), UV/vis, Raman, and X-ray diffraction (XRD). The specific surface area of the catalysts decreases with vanadium loading, and the degree of polymerization of VOx species is influenced by the support material. The catalytic activity of the VOx(2.7)/MCM-41 catalyst is slightly higher than that of the VOx(2.8)/SiO2 and VOx(3.4)/MCM-48 samples, possibly due to a lower degree of polymerization of VOx species. The lowest activity was observed over the VOx(11.2)/MCM-41 sample, which possesses microcrystalline V2O5. Catalyst deactivation and stability are critical challenges in the ODHP process. The use of N2O as an oxidant can help mitigate these issues by reducing the formation of nonselective adsorbed oxygen species that can lead to catalyst deactivation. However, the lower activity of N2O compared to O2 can also be a limitation. Strategies to address these challenges include optimizing the catalyst structure and composition to enhance stability and selectivity, developing methods to regenerate deactivated catalysts, and exploring alternative oxidants that can provide high selectivity and activity while maintaining catalyst stability.", "Doi": "10.1021/jp070747c"},

For an O2- containing reaction feed, C3H6 selectivity decreases from 77 to 15% upon increasing C3H8 conversion from 0.6 to 9%. For similar changes in the degree of C3H8 conversion in the presence of N2O, C3H6 selectivity drops only from 86 to 60%.\"\n          [8] \"The reaction pathways of CO and CO2 formation are also influenced by the nature of oxidizing agent.

It increases from 15 to 20% upon increasing C3H8 conversion from 0.6 to 9%. About 13% CO2 selectivity is expected upon extrapolation to a zero degree of propane conversion. Based on this observation and taking into account the small change of CO2 selectivity with varying degree of propane conversion in Fig. 2(b), it is concluded that carbon dioxide is mainly formed via direct propane combustion but not via consecutive propene oxidation. The latter reaction contributes to the total CO2 production only at high degrees of propane conversion. When O2 is replaced by N2O, CO2 selectivity decreases in the studied range of propane conversions (Fig. 2(b)). The decrease in CO2 selectivity is explained by a reduced tendency towards direct propane combustion. This conclusion is based on the fact, that a near-to-zero CO2 selectivity is expected for a zero degree of propane conversion in the presence of N2O (Fig. 2(b)). Upon increasing C3H8 conversion, CO2 selectivity increases, hence, CO2 is mainly formed via consecutive C3H6 oxidation when N2O is used as oxidizing agent.\"\n          [9] \"The selectivityconversion plot in Fig. 2(c) evidences that CO formation is stronger influenced by the degree of C3H8 conversion than CO2 formation. CO selectivity is very low (<5%) at zero C3H8 conversion but strongly increases with C3H8 conversion for both oxidants (N2O and O2). The obtained relationship indicates the secondary nature of CO formation,i.e. CO is formed via consecutive C3H6 oxidation. From Fig. 2(c) it is concluded that CO formation with O2 is stronger influenced by the degree of C3H8 conversion as compared to the tests with N2O. For an O2-containing feed, a relative difference in CO selectivity is 60% upon increasing C3H8 conversion from 0.6 to 9%, while the respective differencewith N2O is 20%.\"\n          [10] \"Summarizing the above discussion, it is concluded that catalytic performance and general scheme of the ODP reaction are determined by the applied oxidizing agent (O2 and N2O),but not by the initial composition of individual vanadium oxides.\"\n          [11] \"The results of steady-state ODP studies in Fig. 2 suggest a complex reaction scheme of parallel and consecutive steps for the ODP reaction using either O2 or N2O.

The difference between O2- and N2O-containing ODP feeds in the catalytic performance of vanadium oxides (Fig. 2, Table 4) may be partially related to the nature of active oxygen species originating from O2. To support this assumption, we performed transient experiments with isotopically labeled 18O2 using a SSITKA (steady-state isotopic transient kinetic analysis) technique.

to precisely define the nature of oxygen species originating from O2 and N2O over reduced VOx species.\"", "English": "Nitrous oxide (N2O) has been shown to increase propene selectivity in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) over alumina- and silica-supported vanadia catalysts compared to O2. However, the ODP activity with N2O is lower than with O2. The degree of reduction of VOx species is suggested to be important for achieving high propene selectivity. The nature of oxygen species, whether adsorbed (nonlattice) or lattice, also influences COx formation. Adsorbed oxygen species are considered nonselective for the ODP reaction over certain catalysts. The redox dynamics of VOx species have been studied using in-situ UV/vis analysis, and the catalytic performance of different VOx/SiO2, VOx/MCM-41, and VOx/MCM-48 materials in the ODP reaction has been characterized. Nitrous oxide (N2O) has been found to be advantageous as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) compared to other oxidants like oxygen (O2). This is due to its ability to achieve higher propylene selectivity. The study of VOx/MCM-41, VOx/SiO2, and VOx/MCM-48 materials has shown that N2O can lead to a higher degree of reduction of vanadium species, which is essential for achieving high primary propylene selectivity and suppressing consecutive propylene oxidation to CO and CO2. The higher polymerized VOx species have a higher activity for consecutive propene oxidation, and the importance of direct propane oxidation and consecutive propene oxidation to COx is significantly higher in the presence of O2 than in N2O. The catalytic performance is determined by the oxidant activation, and N2O's lower oxidizing ability tunes the degree of reduction of vanadium species, leading to a higher reduction degree of VOx species. This effect is related to the spatial separation of active lattice oxygen species, reducing the surface density of active oxygen species. However, the degree of reduction of VOx species is not the only reason for the superior performance of N2O compared to O2. The nature of oxygen species also influences COx formation, with adsorbed (nonlattice) oxygen species being nonselective for the ODP reaction over certain catalytic materials. In contrast, N2O decomposition over reducible metal oxides yields mononuclear oxygen species, which are considered selective. The critical challenges associated with catalyst deactivation and stability in N2O-ODHP include the need for a high degree of reduction of vanadium species and the prevention of nonselective oxygen species formation. Strategies to address these limitations could involve the development of catalysts with controlled surface density of active oxygen species and the optimization of reaction conditions to favor selective oxygen species formation. Research directions could focus on understanding the mechanisms of oxygen species formation and their role in the selectivity of the ODHP process, as well as the development of new catalyst formulations that can maintain high activity and selectivity under N2O-ODHP conditions. Nitrous oxide (N2O) has been shown to have advantages over other oxidants in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP), particularly in terms of propylene selectivity. The use of N2O as an oxidant results in higher propylene selectivity compared to oxygen (O2) over a broad range of propane conversions. This effect is more pronounced for catalysts with microcrystalline V2O5. The improved selectivity is attributed to the ability of N2O to achieve a higher primary propene selectivity and to lower the activity for consecutive propene oxidation. N2O reoxidizes reduced VOx species slower than O2, which is essential for suppressing nonselective consecutive propene oxidation to COx. The nature of oxygen species also plays a role, with N2O not producing nonselective adsorbed oxygen species that can catalyze nonselective consecutive propene oxidation to COx. A variety of catalysts have been employed in the ODHP process, including VOx/SiO2, VOx/MCM-41, and VOx/MCM-48. These catalysts have been characterized using various techniques such as transmission electron microscopy (TEM), temperature-programmed reduction (TPR), UV/vis, Raman, and X-ray diffraction (XRD). The specific surface area of the catalysts decreases with vanadium loading, and the degree of polymerization of VOx species is influenced by the support material. The catalytic activity of the VOx(2.7)/MCM-41 catalyst is slightly higher than that of the VOx(2.8)/SiO2 and VOx(3.4)/MCM-48 samples, possibly due to a lower degree of polymerization of VOx species. The lowest activity was observed over the VOx(11.2)/MCM-41 sample, which possesses microcrystalline V2O5. Catalyst deactivation and stability are critical challenges in the ODHP process. The use of N2O as an oxidant can help mitigate these issues by reducing the formation of nonselective adsorbed oxygen species that can lead to catalyst deactivation. However, the lower activity of N2O compared to O2 can also be a limitation. Strategies to address these challenges include optimizing the catalyst structure and composition to enhance stability and selectivity, developing methods to regenerate deactivated catalysts, and exploring alternative oxidants that can provide high selectivity and activity while maintaining catalyst stability.", "Doi": "10.1021/jp070747c"},

For an O2- containing reaction feed, C3H6 selectivity decreases from 77 to 15% upon increasing C3H8 conversion from 0.6 to 9%. For similar changes in the degree of C3H8 conversion in the presence of N2O, C3H6 selectivity drops only from 86 to 60%.\"\n          [8] \"The reaction pathways of CO and CO2 formation are also influenced by the nature of oxidizing agent.

It increases from 15 to 20% upon increasing C3H8 conversion from 0.6 to 9%. About 13% CO2 selectivity is expected upon extrapolation to a zero degree of propane conversion. Based on this observation and taking into account the small change of CO2 selectivity with varying degree of propane conversion in Fig. 2(b), it is concluded that carbon dioxide is mainly formed via direct propane combustion but not via consecutive propene oxidation. The latter reaction contributes to the total CO2 production only at high degrees of propane conversion. When O2 is replaced by N2O, CO2 selectivity decreases in the studied range of propane conversions (Fig. 2(b)). The decrease in CO2 selectivity is explained by a reduced tendency towards direct propane combustion. This conclusion is based on the fact, that a near-to-zero CO2 selectivity is expected for a zero degree of propane conversion in the presence of N2O (Fig. 2(b)). Upon increasing C3H8 conversion, CO2 selectivity increases, hence, CO2 is mainly formed via consecutive C3H6 oxidation when N2O is used as oxidizing agent.\"\n          [9] \"The selectivityconversion plot in Fig. 2(c) evidences that CO formation is stronger influenced by the degree of C3H8 conversion than CO2 formation. CO selectivity is very low (<5%) at zero C3H8 conversion but strongly increases with C3H8 conversion for both oxidants (N2O and O2). The obtained relationship indicates the secondary nature of CO formation,i.e. CO is formed via consecutive C3H6 oxidation. From Fig. 2(c) it is concluded that CO formation with O2 is stronger influenced by the degree of C3H8 conversion as compared to the tests with N2O. For an O2-containing feed, a relative difference in CO selectivity is 60% upon increasing C3H8 conversion from 0.6 to 9%, while the respective differencewith N2O is 20%.\"\n          [10] \"Summarizing the above discussion, it is concluded that catalytic performance and general scheme of the ODP reaction are determined by the applied oxidizing agent (O2 and N2O),but not by the initial composition of individual vanadium oxides.\"\n          [11] \"The results of steady-state ODP studies in Fig. 2 suggest a complex reaction scheme of parallel and consecutive steps for the ODP reaction using either O2 or N2O.

The difference between O2- and N2O-containing ODP feeds in the catalytic performance of vanadium oxides (Fig. 2, Table 4) may be partially related to the nature of active oxygen species originating from O2. To support this assumption, we performed transient experiments with isotopically labeled 18O2 using a SSITKA (steady-state isotopic transient kinetic analysis) technique.

to precisely define the nature of oxygen species originating from O2 and N2O over reduced VOx species.\"", "English": "Nitrous oxide (N2O) has been shown to increase propene selectivity in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) over alumina- and silica-supported vanadia catalysts compared to O2. However, the ODP activity with N2O is lower than with O2. The degree of reduction of VOx species is suggested to be important for achieving high propene selectivity. The nature of oxygen species, whether adsorbed (nonlattice) or lattice, also influences COx formation. Adsorbed oxygen species are considered nonselective for the ODP reaction over certain catalysts. The redox dynamics of VOx species have been studied using in-situ UV/vis analysis, and the catalytic performance of different VOx/SiO2, VOx/MCM-41, and VOx/MCM-48 materials in the ODP reaction has been characterized. Nitrous oxide (N2O) has been found to be advantageous as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) compared to other oxidants like oxygen (O2). This is due to its ability to achieve higher propylene selectivity. The study of VOx/MCM-41, VOx/SiO2, and VOx/MCM-48 materials has shown that N2O can lead to a higher degree of reduction of vanadium species, which is essential for achieving high primary propylene selectivity and suppressing consecutive propylene oxidation to CO and CO2. The higher polymerized VOx species have a higher activity for consecutive propene oxidation, and the importance of direct propane oxidation and consecutive propene oxidation to COx is significantly higher in the presence of O2 than in N2O. The catalytic performance is determined by the oxidant activation, and N2O's lower oxidizing ability tunes the degree of reduction of vanadium species, leading to a higher reduction degree of VOx species. This effect is related to the spatial separation of active lattice oxygen species, reducing the surface density of active oxygen species. However, the degree of reduction of VOx species is not the only reason for the superior performance of N2O compared to O2. The nature of oxygen species also influences COx formation, with adsorbed (nonlattice) oxygen species being nonselective for the ODP reaction over certain catalytic materials. In contrast, N2O decomposition over reducible metal oxides yields mononuclear oxygen species, which are considered selective. The critical challenges associated with catalyst deactivation and stability in N2O-ODHP include the need for a high degree of reduction of vanadium species and the prevention of nonselective oxygen species formation. Strategies to address these limitations could involve the development of catalysts with controlled surface density of active oxygen species and the optimization of reaction conditions to favor selective oxygen species formation. Research directions could focus on understanding the mechanisms of oxygen species formation and their role in the selectivity of the ODHP process, as well as the development of new catalyst formulations that can maintain high activity and selectivity under N2O-ODHP conditions. Nitrous oxide (N2O) has been shown to have advantages over other oxidants in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP), particularly in terms of propylene selectivity. The use of N2O as an oxidant results in higher propylene selectivity compared to oxygen (O2) over a broad range of propane conversions. This effect is more pronounced for catalysts with microcrystalline V2O5. The improved selectivity is attributed to the ability of N2O to achieve a higher primary propene selectivity and to lower the activity for consecutive propene oxidation. N2O reoxidizes reduced VOx species slower than O2, which is essential for suppressing nonselective consecutive propene oxidation to COx. The nature of oxygen species also plays a role, with N2O not producing nonselective adsorbed oxygen species that can catalyze nonselective consecutive propene oxidation to COx. A variety of catalysts have been employed in the ODHP process, including VOx/SiO2, VOx/MCM-41, and VOx/MCM-48. These catalysts have been characterized using various techniques such as transmission electron microscopy (TEM), temperature-programmed reduction (TPR), UV/vis, Raman, and X-ray diffraction (XRD). The specific surface area of the catalysts decreases with vanadium loading, and the degree of polymerization of VOx species is influenced by the support material. The catalytic activity of the VOx(2.7)/MCM-41 catalyst is slightly higher than that of the VOx(2.8)/SiO2 and VOx(3.4)/MCM-48 samples, possibly due to a lower degree of polymerization of VOx species. The lowest activity was observed over the VOx(11.2)/MCM-41 sample, which possesses microcrystalline V2O5. Catalyst deactivation and stability are critical challenges in the ODHP process. The use of N2O as an oxidant can help mitigate these issues by reducing the formation of nonselective adsorbed oxygen species that can lead to catalyst deactivation. However, the lower activity of N2O compared to O2 can also be a limitation. Strategies to address these challenges include optimizing the catalyst structure and composition to enhance stability and selectivity, developing methods to regenerate deactivated catalysts, and exploring alternative oxidants that can provide high selectivity and activity while maintaining catalyst stability.", "Doi": "10.1021/jp070747c"},

For an O2- containing reaction feed, C3H6 selectivity decreases from 77 to 15% upon increasing C3H8 conversion from 0.6 to 9%. For similar changes in the degree of C3H8 conversion in the presence of N2O, C3H6 selectivity drops only from 86 to 60%.\"\n          [8] \"The reaction pathways of CO and CO2 formation are also influenced by the nature of oxidizing agent.

It increases from 15 to 20% upon increasing C3H8 conversion from 0.6 to 9%. About 13% CO2 selectivity is expected upon extrapolation to a zero degree of propane conversion. Based on this observation and taking into account the small change of CO2 selectivity with varying degree of propane conversion in Fig. 2(b), it is concluded that carbon dioxide is mainly formed via direct propane combustion but not via consecutive propene oxidation. The latter reaction contributes to the total CO2 production only at high degrees of propane conversion. When O2 is replaced by N2O, CO2 selectivity decreases in the studied range of propane conversions (Fig. 2(b)). The decrease in CO2 selectivity is explained by a reduced tendency towards direct propane combustion. This conclusion is based on the fact, that a near-to-zero CO2 selectivity is expected for a zero degree of propane conversion in the presence of N2O (Fig. 2(b)). Upon increasing C3H8 conversion, CO2 selectivity increases, hence, CO2 is mainly formed via consecutive C3H6 oxidation when N2O is used as oxidizing agent.\"\n          [9] \"The selectivityconversion plot in Fig. 2(c) evidences that CO formation is stronger influenced by the degree of C3H8 conversion than CO2 formation. CO selectivity is very low (<5%) at zero C3H8 conversion but strongly increases with C3H8 conversion for both oxidants (N2O and O2). The obtained relationship indicates the secondary nature of CO formation,i.e. CO is formed via consecutive C3H6 oxidation. From Fig. 2(c) it is concluded that CO formation with O2 is stronger influenced by the degree of C3H8 conversion as compared to the tests with N2O. For an O2-containing feed, a relative difference in CO selectivity is 60% upon increasing C3H8 conversion from 0.6 to 9%, while the respective differencewith N2O is 20%.\"\n          [10] \"Summarizing the above discussion, it is concluded that catalytic performance and general scheme of the ODP reaction are determined by the applied oxidizing agent (O2 and N2O),but not by the initial composition of individual vanadium oxides.\"\n          [11] \"The results of steady-state ODP studies in Fig. 2 suggest a complex reaction scheme of parallel and consecutive steps for the ODP reaction using either O2 or N2O.

The difference between O2- and N2O-containing ODP feeds in the catalytic performance of vanadium oxides (Fig. 2, Table 4) may be partially related to the nature of active oxygen species originating from O2. To support this assumption, we performed transient experiments with isotopically labeled 18O2 using a SSITKA (steady-state isotopic transient kinetic analysis) technique.

to precisely define the nature of oxygen species originating from O2 and N2O over reduced VOx species.\"", "English": "Nitrous oxide (N2O) has been shown to increase propene selectivity in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) over alumina- and silica-supported vanadia catalysts compared to O2. However, the ODP activity with N2O is lower than with O2. The degree of reduction of VOx species is suggested to be important for achieving high propene selectivity. The nature of oxygen species, whether adsorbed (nonlattice) or lattice, also influences COx formation. Adsorbed oxygen species are considered nonselective for the ODP reaction over certain catalysts. The redox dynamics of VOx species have been studied using in-situ UV/vis analysis, and the catalytic performance of different VOx/SiO2, VOx/MCM-41, and VOx/MCM-48 materials in the ODP reaction has been characterized. Nitrous oxide (N2O) has been found to be advantageous as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) compared to other oxidants like oxygen (O2). This is due to its ability to achieve higher propylene selectivity. The study of VOx/MCM-41, VOx/SiO2, and VOx/MCM-48 materials has shown that N2O can lead to a higher degree of reduction of vanadium species, which is essential for achieving high primary propylene selectivity and suppressing consecutive propylene oxidation to CO and CO2. The higher polymerized VOx species have a higher activity for consecutive propene oxidation, and the importance of direct propane oxidation and consecutive propene oxidation to COx is significantly higher in the presence of O2 than in N2O. The catalytic performance is determined by the oxidant activation, and N2O's lower oxidizing ability tunes the degree of reduction of vanadium species, leading to a higher reduction degree of VOx species. This effect is related to the spatial separation of active lattice oxygen species, reducing the surface density of active oxygen species. However, the degree of reduction of VOx species is not the only reason for the superior performance of N2O compared to O2. The nature of oxygen species also influences COx formation, with adsorbed (nonlattice) oxygen species being nonselective for the ODP reaction over certain catalytic materials. In contrast, N2O decomposition over reducible metal oxides yields mononuclear oxygen species, which are considered selective. The critical challenges associated with catalyst deactivation and stability in N2O-ODHP include the need for a high degree of reduction of vanadium species and the prevention of nonselective oxygen species formation. Strategies to address these limitations could involve the development of catalysts with controlled surface density of active oxygen species and the optimization of reaction conditions to favor selective oxygen species formation. Research directions could focus on understanding the mechanisms of oxygen species formation and their role in the selectivity of the ODHP process, as well as the development of new catalyst formulations that can maintain high activity and selectivity under N2O-ODHP conditions. Nitrous oxide (N2O) has been shown to have advantages over other oxidants in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP), particularly in terms of propylene selectivity. The use of N2O as an oxidant results in higher propylene selectivity compared to oxygen (O2) over a broad range of propane conversions. This effect is more pronounced for catalysts with microcrystalline V2O5. The improved selectivity is attributed to the ability of N2O to achieve a higher primary propene selectivity and to lower the activity for consecutive propene oxidation. N2O reoxidizes reduced VOx species slower than O2, which is essential for suppressing nonselective consecutive propene oxidation to COx. The nature of oxygen species also plays a role, with N2O not producing nonselective adsorbed oxygen species that can catalyze nonselective consecutive propene oxidation to COx. A variety of catalysts have been employed in the ODHP process, including VOx/SiO2, VOx/MCM-41, and VOx/MCM-48. These catalysts have been characterized using various techniques such as transmission electron microscopy (TEM), temperature-programmed reduction (TPR), UV/vis, Raman, and X-ray diffraction (XRD). The specific surface area of the catalysts decreases with vanadium loading, and the degree of polymerization of VOx species is influenced by the support material. The catalytic activity of the VOx(2.7)/MCM-41 catalyst is slightly higher than that of the VOx(2.8)/SiO2 and VOx(3.4)/MCM-48 samples, possibly due to a lower degree of polymerization of VOx species. The lowest activity was observed over the VOx(11.2)/MCM-41 sample, which possesses microcrystalline V2O5. Catalyst deactivation and stability are critical challenges in the ODHP process. The use of N2O as an oxidant can help mitigate these issues by reducing the formation of nonselective adsorbed oxygen species that can lead to catalyst deactivation. However, the lower activity of N2O compared to O2 can also be a limitation. Strategies to address these challenges include optimizing the catalyst structure and composition to enhance stability and selectivity, developing methods to regenerate deactivated catalysts, and exploring alternative oxidants that can provide high selectivity and activity while maintaining catalyst stability.", "Doi": "10.1021/jp070747c"},

This is attributed to the fact that N2O reoxidizes the reduced vanadium species without forming peroxovanadates, which are highly reactive and can lead to the formation of carbon oxides. The use of N2O as an oxidant results in a slower reoxidation process, which allows for a higher selectivity towards propene. However, the catalyst deactivation is a critical challenge in this process, as it is mainly caused by the reduction of vanadium species rather than the formation of carbonaceous deposits. The regeneration of the catalyst by heating under N2O at high temperatures can partly restore its activity, but complete restoration requires reoxidation in the presence of oxygen. To address these limitations and make N2O-ODHP a more feasible option for practical implementation, research directions could focus on developing more stable catalysts that can maintain their activity over longer periods, optimizing the reaction conditions to minimize vanadium reduction, and exploring alternative regeneration methods that can effectively restore the catalyst's activity without the need for high-temperature treatments.", "Doi": "10.1016/j.jcat.2015.12.028"},
