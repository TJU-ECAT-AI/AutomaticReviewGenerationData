Nitrous oxide (N2O) can improve the selectivity of the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) process by inhibiting the adsorption of O2 and/or increasing the reduction rate of the catalysts. The oxygen produced by the dissociation of N2O can oxidize propane to propene. In the presence of N2O, catalytic sites work in a more reduced state. N2O has been used as a pure oxidant in various reactions, including the oxidative coupling of methane to ethane, the transformation of benzene to phenol, and the oxidation of ethylene to epoxide. The use of N2O in ODHP can potentially lead to higher propylene selectivity compared to other oxidants by controlling the oxidation state of the catalyst and limiting the formation of non-selective oxygen species. Adjusting the concentration of N2O could be a useful strategy to modulate selectivity during the catalytic reaction.

Nitrous oxide (N2O) has been shown to significantly improve propene selectivity in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) compared to molecular oxygen (O2) when used as an oxidant. This improvement has been observed over various catalysts, including steam-activated iron-containing zeolites, bulk vanadium oxides, and supported vanadium-containing materials. A similar effect of N2O has also been reported for the oxidative dehydrogenation of n-butane over vanadium magnesium oxide catalysts. The positive effect of N2O on the ODHP reaction is attributed to the slower reoxidation of reduced VOx species compared to O2, resulting in a lower steady-state concentration of active lattice oxygen sites and thus suppressing the consecutive oxidation of propene to carbon oxides. However, the activity of VOx sites for consecutive propene oxidation increases with rising agglomerization degree. Propene selectivities do not differ much as long as the vanadium surface concentration remains below monolayer coverage, with only isolated VOx sites and small two-dimensional VxOy clusters present. When V2O5 nanocrystallites dominate, there is a dramatic drop in propene selectivity and direct total oxidation of propane occurs with both oxidants, although this detrimental effect is less pronounced in the presence of N2O. A recent study suggested that compared to N2O, other oxygen species (non-lattice oxygen of VOx species) are formed from gas-phase O2 and participate in COx formation. However, there is limited experimental information on the nature of active oxygen species formed from O2 and N2O upon reoxidation of reduced VOx species. The aim of this study is to obtain experimental evidence on the nature and structure of oxygen species formed upon reoxidation of reduced highly dispersed VOx species supported over MCM-41 with O2 and N2O. The same VOx/MCM-41 catalyst used in this work has previously been thoroughly characterized and tested in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane. A turnover frequency of propane conversion of 0.016 molC3H8 mol1 V s1 has been measured with O2 used as an oxidizing agent. In comparison, the respective value with N2O was only half as high, while the propene selectivity was higher, amounting to 80% with N2O but only to 50% with O2 at propane conversion of approximately 10%. Since several of the previously postulated oxygen species were paramagnetic, EPR spectroscopy under controlled atmosphere conditions was applied to experimentally identify oxygen species formed from gaseous N2O and O2 over VOx/MCM-41 and to explore the reactivity of these species towards oxidation of C3H8, C3H6, and CO.

Nitrous oxide (N2O) has been shown to be a superior oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) compared to other oxidants like oxygen (O2). Steam-activated iron zeolites (Fe-zeolites) have demonstrated high initial propene yields of 24% at temperatures between 773 and 798 K, which are comparable to the highest yields reported over vanadium (V) and molybdenum (Mo)-based catalysts using O2. The essential role of N2O in this process is highlighted by the fact that propene production does not occur when propane interacts with iron zeolites in the absence of N2O. The remarkable performance of Fe-zeolites is attributed to the specificity of N2O as a monooxygen donor and the capability of iron forms in the zeolite to coordinate reactive atomic oxygen species for efficient propane dehydrogenation. However, a major drawback is the deactivation by coke, causing a rapid decrease in propene yield. The rate of deactivation varies among the zeolites studied, with Fe-beta deactivating the fastest, followed by Fe-silicalite and FeZSM-5. The deactivation behavior of FeZSM-5 suggests the presence of active iron sites with different sensitivity for coke deactivation. Catalyst deactivation is a complex process that can be caused by a decrease in the number of active sites, a decrease in the quality of active sites, or a decrease in accessibility of the pore space.

N2O is a mono-oxygen donor that can efficiently dehydrogenate propane due to the ability of certain iron species to coordinate reactive atomic oxygen species. This specificity of N2O contributes to the remarkable performance of iron zeolites in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP). However, a major drawback of iron zeolites in ODHP with N2O is the deactivation by coke, which leads to a rapid decrease in propylene yield. The tapered element oscillating microbalance (TEOM) technique coupled with gas chromatography (GC) analysis has been used to correlate deactivation and mass changes due to coking. While TEOM provides detailed and accurate in situ investigation of coke formation, it does not provide information on the deactivation mechanism at the catalyst surface level. To gain a better understanding of the deactivation of iron-containing zeolites in the C3H8 + N2O reaction and the subsequent regeneration in air, complementary spectroscopic studies under reaction conditions are needed. In situ FTIR spectroscopy is suitable for assessing coke deactivation of zeolite catalysts in hydrocarbon conversion by monitoring the formation of carbonaceous deposits and changes in vibrations associated with the surface acidity and framework of the microporous material. Observing the evolution of the working catalyst under true process conditions is useful for an improved understanding of the ODHP reaction. However, in situ investigations of selective oxidation of hydrocarbons with N2O over iron-containing zeolites have not been reported. Moreover, the reusability of the regenerated catalysts has not yet been addressed in detail. Infrared results were complemented by TEOMGC experiments over the catalysts at the same conditions. The degree of catalyst reversibility on reaction and regeneration is evaluated and discussed on the basis of these analyses and characterization of the fresh, coked, and regenerated samples by X-ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and nitrogen adsorption.

Nitrous oxide (N2O) has been identified as a promising oxidant for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) to produce propylene, a key petrochemical feedstock. Compared to traditional oxidants like oxygen, N2O allows for the production of propylene at lower temperatures, which can improve the efficiency and selectivity of the process. The use of N2O as an oxidant in ODHP has been shown to achieve remarkable propylene yields, particularly when iron zeolites are used as catalysts. These catalysts have been found to be effective at lower temperatures than those required for mixed metal oxide catalysts, which typically operate at higher temperatures. However, the performance of iron zeolites can vary significantly depending on the method of iron incorporation and the preparation technique. Steam activation of iron-substituted ZSM-5 zeolites has been shown to result in superior propylene yields compared to other preparation methods. Iron impurities in steamed commercial H-ZSM-5 zeolites have also been found to induce high propylene selectivity, leading to low COx formation. A major challenge in the use of N2O for ODHP is the deactivation of iron zeolite catalysts due to coke formation, which can limit the stability and lifetime of the catalyst. Strategies to address this limitation could include the development of more stable catalyst formulations, optimization of reaction conditions to minimize coke formation, and the use of in situ regeneration techniques to maintain catalyst activity. Research directions that could potentially make N2O-ODHP a more feasible option for practical implementation include the exploration of alternative iron sources and incorporation methods, the design of catalysts with enhanced resistance to deactivation, and the development of integrated process designs that incorporate catalyst regeneration steps.

The use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) presents several advantages, particularly in terms of propylene selectivity compared to other oxidants. N2O, being a strong greenhouse gas, can be effectively utilized in this process, potentially offering environmental benefits. The substitution of N2O for oxygen leads to a significant increase in propylene selectivity across various catalysts, including iron-containing zeolites and vanadium-based catalysts. Iron-based materials, such as Fe-ZSM-5, have been identified as particularly effective in yielding high propylene (C3H6) in ODHP using N2O. Other redox metal catalysts, such as vanadium and molybdenum, have also been explored for this purpose. However, a critical challenge associated with the use of N2O in ODHP is the rapid deactivation of catalysts, primarily due to coke formation. This issue significantly limits the feasibility of N2O as an oxidant compared to softer oxidants like CO2. The quick deactivation of catalysts under N2O conditions necessitates further research to improve catalyst stability and to gain a clearer understanding of the deactivation mechanisms. Addressing these limitations could potentially make N2O-ODHP a more viable option for practical implementation. Strategies to overcome these limitations might include the development of more stable catalyst formulations, the optimization of reaction conditions to minimize coke formation, and the engineering of catalysts with enhanced resistance to deactivation. Additionally, in-depth studies to elucidate the precise mechanisms of deactivation could guide the design of more robust catalysts for N2O-ODHP processes.

Nitrous oxide (N2O) has been shown to modify the catalytic performances of the same catalyst in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODP) reaction. Principally, it decreases the conversion of propane and oxygen, increases the yield and selectivity to propylene, and decreases the yield and selectivity to CO2. In the presence of N2O, catalytic sites work in a more reduced state, leading to a more selective reaction. When the amount of N2O is higher than 300 ppm, oxygen species coming from N2O dissociation could also play a role, suggesting that N2O is also able to induce the ODP, although less oxidant than O2. However, the use of pure N2O to perform the ODP is not advisable as molecular oxygen is necessary to oxidize and regenerate the catalysts in the presence of N2O, otherwise the catalyst deactivates quickly. N2O reduces the catalysts (molybdenum), explaining the high carbon formation. It is the presence of both O2 and N2O (as promoter) that can fully explain the better selectivity of the catalysts in ODP, due to the modulation of their adequate oxidation state during the reaction.

The use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) has several advantages in terms of propylene selectivity compared to other oxidants. N2O's lower ability for catalyst reoxidation leads to an increase in the degree of catalyst reduction, which spatially separates active lattice oxygen in surface VOx species. This separation favors selective oxidation over the formation of COx. Propylene selectivity over V/g-Al2O3 materials can be improved by fully covering the support with well-dispersed VOx species. The selectivity can be further tuned by using N2O as an alternative oxidizing agent. The lower activity of N2O is due to its reduced ability to reoxidize reduced VOx sites, which enhances propene selectivity. This effect is attributed to the less favorable reoxidation of the catalyst by N2O compared to O2. The decrease in the steady-state concentration of active surface lattice oxygen of VOx species favors selective propane oxidation to propene over COx formation, as only one to two lattice oxygen are necessary for the former reaction. Active sites with more than two lattice oxygen species favor the formation of waste products like CO and CO2. The effect of the oxidizing agent on the catalytic performance is also related to the nature of oxygen species originating from O2 and N2O. It has been suggested that atomic oxygen species are responsible for selective oxidation, while polyatomic oxygen species take part in COx formation. However, direct experimental evidence is not available at this stage.

N2O is a highly efficient oxidant for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) over steam-activated FeZSM-5, achieving propene yields up to 25% at 723 K. The remarkable performance of iron zeolites in ODHP is attributed to the specificity of N2O as a monooxygen donor and the capability of iron forms in the zeolite to coordinate reactive atomic oxygen species for efficient dehydrogenation of propane. However, a major drawback is the deactivation by coke formation, leading to a rapid decrease in propene yield. The rate of deactivation is reduced with an increase in temperature, and the relatively slow deactivation of FeZSM-5 at 773 K is associated with high N2O conversion. The use of O2 as an oxidant in ODHP over FeZSM-5 leads to very low C3H6 yields (<5%) compared to N2O. The addition of small amounts of O2 to the C3H8+N2O mixture results in a decrease in C3H6 selectivity and an increase in COx production. The intermediates essential for propene production are negatively impacted by the presence of O2, severely deteriorating the performance of FeZSM-5 in N2O-mediated ODHP of propane. Strategies to address the limitations of catalyst deactivation and stability in N2O-ODHP include optimizing the reaction temperature to reduce deactivation rates, developing catalysts with improved resistance to coke formation, and exploring methods to regenerate the catalysts more efficiently. Research directions could focus on understanding the mechanisms of coke formation and identifying catalysts with active sites that are less susceptible to deactivation. Additionally, the development of cheap and selective catalyst systems for the low-temperature NH3 oxidation to N2O could provide a low-cost and reasonably pure source of N2O, making the process more feasible for practical implementation.

The literature does not provide a direct comparison of N2O as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) with other oxidants in terms of propylene selectivity. However, it does state that N2O is more selective than molecular oxygen in other oxidation reactions. The literature discusses the use of nickel molybdate catalysts in the ODHP process and the effects of adding N2O as a gas dope on the catalytic performance. The addition of N2O modifies the catalytic performances, with a decrease in propane conversion, an increase in propylene yield and selectivity, and a decrease in oxygen consumption and CO2 yield at low concentrations of N2O. At higher concentrations of N2O, the selectivity in propylene decreases, and carbonaceous products are formed. The literature does not address the critical challenges associated with catalyst deactivation and stability in the N2O-ODHP process. However, it does suggest that adjusting the concentration of promoters like N2O could be a useful tool to modulate the oxidation state of oxide catalysts and improve their catalytic performances.

The use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) has gained significant attention as an alternative to dioxygen. The primary advantage of N2O is its ability to produce propylene with higher selectivity compared to dioxygen, which tends to over-oxidize propane, leading to the formation of carbon oxides (CO and CO2) and lower olefin yields. Iron-zeolites, particularly Fe-ZSM-5, have been developed as unique catalysts for this process, with Fe-ZSM-5 exhibiting superior performance for ODHP with N2O after severe calcination. However, catalyst deactivation remains a critical challenge in the ODHP process, regardless of the oxidant used. The presence of propane as a reductant complicates the conversion of nitrous oxide on iron-zeolites, and the deactivation mechanism of catalysts in ODHP with N2O is not fully understood. Strategies to address these limitations could include further research into the deactivation mechanisms, development of more stable catalysts, and optimization of reaction conditions to minimize coke formation and maximize catalyst lifetime. These efforts could potentially make N2O-ODHP a more feasible option for practical implementation.

The use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) has the advantage of increasing propylene selectivity compared to other oxidants. This is because N2O decomposition is less favorable than O2 activation, leading to a decrease in the steady-state concentration of active sites and an increase in propene selectivity. The efficiency of isolated VOx species for selective ODHP is superimposed by non-selective oxidation over the naked surface of the acidic support, which is not covered by active vanadia. To achieve high performance in ODHP, it is desirable to design catalytic surfaces that are fully covered by well-dispersed vanadia species to avoid the strong adsorption of propene on the support surface. The steady-state concentration of active lattice oxygen, which takes part in propane and propene activation, should be optimized to control selective oxidation and combustion reactions. Using N2O instead of O2 can achieve this optimization.

Nitrous oxide (N2O) has been found to be advantageous as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) due to its ability to achieve higher propene selectivity compared to molecular oxygen (O2) at similar degrees of propane conversion. This is attributed to the weaker oxidizing potential of N2O, which inhibits the direct oxidation of propane and the consecutive oxidation of propene to carbon oxides (COx). The use of N2O as an oxidant results in a lower catalytic activity due to its weaker ability to re-oxidize the reduced surface vanadium oxide (VOx) species. However, there is no significant difference in propene selectivity between highly dispersed surface VOx species and crystalline V2O5 nanoparticles when N2O is used as an oxidant. In contrast, crystalline V2O5 nanoparticles are not selective for the ODHP reaction in the presence of O2. The positive effect of N2O on propene selectivity is related to the reduction in surface density (spatial separation) of active surface lattice oxygen in VOx species, as N2O is a weaker oxidant for re-oxidation of reduced VOx species compared to O2. From a stoichiometric point of view, selective propene formation is favored over combustion reactions at lower surface densities.

Nitrous oxide (N2O) has been shown to increase propylene selectivity in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) compared to other oxidants like oxygen (O2). This improvement is attributed to the lower ability of N2O to re-oxidize reduced vanadium oxide (VOx) species, leading to a higher degree of catalyst reduction. The use of N2O can result in up to three times higher propylene selectivity compared to O2, especially when the catalyst contains bulk-like V2O5 species. N2O reduces the tendency for direct propane combustion and consecutive propene oxidation to COx, leading to improved initial propene selectivity. The nature of oxygen species originating from O2 and N2O also plays a role in the selectivity and activity of the catalyst.

Nitrous oxide (N2O) has been shown to increase propene selectivity in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) over alumina- and silica-supported vanadia catalysts compared to O2. However, the ODP activity with N2O is lower than with O2. The degree of reduction of VOx species is suggested to be important for achieving high propene selectivity. The nature of oxygen species, whether adsorbed (nonlattice) or lattice, also influences COx formation. Adsorbed oxygen species are considered nonselective for the ODP reaction over certain catalysts. The redox dynamics of VOx species have been studied using in-situ UV/vis analysis, and the catalytic performance of different VOx/SiO2, VOx/MCM-41, and VOx/MCM-48 materials in the ODP reaction has been characterized. Nitrous oxide (N2O) has been found to be advantageous as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) compared to other oxidants like oxygen (O2). This is due to its ability to achieve higher propylene selectivity. The study of VOx/MCM-41, VOx/SiO2, and VOx/MCM-48 materials has shown that N2O can lead to a higher degree of reduction of vanadium species, which is essential for achieving high primary propylene selectivity and suppressing consecutive propylene oxidation to CO and CO2. The higher polymerized VOx species have a higher activity for consecutive propene oxidation, and the importance of direct propane oxidation and consecutive propene oxidation to COx is significantly higher in the presence of O2 than in N2O. The catalytic performance is determined by the oxidant activation, and N2O's lower oxidizing ability tunes the degree of reduction of vanadium species, leading to a higher reduction degree of VOx species. This effect is related to the spatial separation of active lattice oxygen species, reducing the surface density of active oxygen species. However, the degree of reduction of VOx species is not the only reason for the superior performance of N2O compared to O2. The nature of oxygen species also influences COx formation, with adsorbed (nonlattice) oxygen species being nonselective for the ODP reaction over certain catalytic materials. In contrast, N2O decomposition over reducible metal oxides yields mononuclear oxygen species, which are considered selective. The critical challenges associated with catalyst deactivation and stability in N2O-ODHP include the need for a high degree of reduction of vanadium species and the prevention of nonselective oxygen species formation. Strategies to address these limitations could involve the development of catalysts with controlled surface density of active oxygen species and the optimization of reaction conditions to favor selective oxygen species formation. Research directions could focus on understanding the mechanisms of oxygen species formation and their role in the selectivity of the ODHP process, as well as the development of new catalyst formulations that can maintain high activity and selectivity under N2O-ODHP conditions. Nitrous oxide (N2O) has been shown to have advantages over other oxidants in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP), particularly in terms of propylene selectivity. The use of N2O as an oxidant results in higher propylene selectivity compared to oxygen (O2) over a broad range of propane conversions. This effect is more pronounced for catalysts with microcrystalline V2O5. The improved selectivity is attributed to the ability of N2O to achieve a higher primary propene selectivity and to lower the activity for consecutive propene oxidation. N2O reoxidizes reduced VOx species slower than O2, which is essential for suppressing nonselective consecutive propene oxidation to COx. The nature of oxygen species also plays a role, with N2O not producing nonselective adsorbed oxygen species that can catalyze nonselective consecutive propene oxidation to COx. A variety of catalysts have been employed in the ODHP process, including VOx/SiO2, VOx/MCM-41, and VOx/MCM-48. These catalysts have been characterized using various techniques such as transmission electron microscopy (TEM), temperature-programmed reduction (TPR), UV/vis, Raman, and X-ray diffraction (XRD). The specific surface area of the catalysts decreases with vanadium loading, and the degree of polymerization of VOx species is influenced by the support material. The catalytic activity of the VOx(2.7)/MCM-41 catalyst is slightly higher than that of the VOx(2.8)/SiO2 and VOx(3.4)/MCM-48 samples, possibly due to a lower degree of polymerization of VOx species. The lowest activity was observed over the VOx(11.2)/MCM-41 sample, which possesses microcrystalline V2O5. Catalyst deactivation and stability are critical challenges in the ODHP process. The use of N2O as an oxidant can help mitigate these issues by reducing the formation of nonselective adsorbed oxygen species that can lead to catalyst deactivation. However, the lower activity of N2O compared to O2 can also be a limitation. Strategies to address these challenges include optimizing the catalyst structure and composition to enhance stability and selectivity, developing methods to regenerate deactivated catalysts, and exploring alternative oxidants that can provide high selectivity and activity while maintaining catalyst stability.

Nitrous oxide (N2O) has been used as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) to increase the selectivity to propylene compared to other oxidants. The catalysts employed in this process include a mixture of NiMoO4 and -Sb2O4, and a palladium supported on a mixed Zr-Ce-O oxide catalyst. The addition of N2O in the feed leads to a significant increase in the selectivity to propylene, while the conversion of propane and oxygen and the yield in CO2 decrease. N2O promotes the reduction of molybdenum, which is beneficial for the selectivity of the catalyst. However, the conversion of propane and the yield of CO2 decrease, which may limit the practical application of N2O-ODHP. The challenge of catalyst deactivation and stability is also a critical issue that needs to be addressed. Strategies to improve the stability of the catalysts and reduce the deactivation rate could potentially make N2O-ODHP a more feasible option for practical implementation. For example, the use of more stable catalysts or the development of new catalysts with higher activity and selectivity could be explored. Additionally, the optimization of the reaction conditions, such as temperature, pressure, and feed composition, could also help to improve the stability of the catalysts and reduce the deactivation rate.

Nitrous oxide (N2O) is an efficient oxidant for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) over steam-activated Fe-zeolites (MFI and BEA), achieving initial propylene yields up to 25% at 723 K. However, catalyst deactivation occurs due to coke formation.
          A tapered element oscillating microbalance (TEOM) coupled to GC analysis has been applied to correlate activity and deactivation by simultaneous measurements of reaction and coking.
          Extraframework iron species, generated during steam treatment, are essential for producing active catalysts.
          The nature and distribution of extraframework iron species, the zeolite host, and the catalyst acidity have no significant effect on the initial propene yield, but strongly influence the deactivation behavior.
          FeZSM-5 shows a remarkable resistance against deactivation, while a very rapid and complete deactivation occurred in FeBEA.
          The initial propene yield over FeZSM-5 and FeBEA was remarkably higher than over commercial H-ZSM-5 and H-BEA (with 3040 times lower iron content), although the residual activities after 400 min on stream were very similar.
          Remarkable yields toward propionaldehyde (up to 6%) have been obtained.
          A major drawback of FeMFI zeolites in ODHP with N2O is the deactivation by coke, causing a rapid decrease of the propene yield.
          The TEOM consists of a microreactor with a high-resolution microbalance that generates real-time measurements of mass changes during gas-solid reactions.
          The TEOM presents three main advantages over conventional gravimetric microbalances: a well-defined flow pattern, a very fast response time resolution (0.1 s), and a high mass resolution across the entire range of pressure and temperature.
          Steam activation is essential for achieving high catalytic activities, as concluded from the low conversion of reactants and propene yield obtained over the calcined iron zeolites.
          Extraframework iron species, generated during steam treatment, are responsible for the oxydehydrogenation of propane with nitrous oxide.
          The difference in initial C3H6 yield between ex-FeZSM-5 and ex-Fe-silicalite is marginal if their constitution with respect to iron is taken into account.
          The initial activity of the synthesized Fe-zeolites is significantly higher than over the commercial zeolites, while the former catalysts contain 30 40 times more iron.
          The rapid deactivation observed in ex-FeBEA and ex-H-BEA can be connected to the presence of large cavities with relatively small apertures in the BEA framework, especially at the intersection of the channels.
          The rate of deactivation over the MFI catalysts is significantly lower, and can be related to the absence of large cages in this zeolitic structure, since channels and intersections are of similar size.
          The higher deactivation resistance of steam-activated ex-FeZSM-5 in ODHP with N2O is unclear, but can be tentatively related to the different iron constitutions in both catalysts and/or the different porous structure associated with the presence of aluminum in the original zeolite framework.
          Ex-FeZSM-5 contains mesopores due to dealumination upon steam treatment, which are absent in ex-Fe-silicalite.
          The more open structure of FeZSM-5 may reduce pore blocking by coke and also improve transport of reactants and products, slowing down deactivation.
          The activity of ex-FeZSM-5 in direct N2O decomposition is significantly higher than that of ex-Fe-silicalite.
          N2O activation generates atomic oxygen over certain iron species, which is efficiently utilized for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane.
          However, recombination of atomic oxygen and desorption as O2 may lead to reaction with coke at specific locations of the zeolite at the operating temperature, resulting in COx.
          This function would partially regenerate the catalyst surface.
          This hypothesis would imply that highly active Fe-zeolite catalysts in direct N2O decomposition have an increased resistance toward coke deactivation in ODHP with N2O.

Nitrous oxide (N2O) is used as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) due to its ability to achieve higher propene selectivity compared to other oxidants, despite lower propane conversion. This is attributed to the fact that N2O reoxidizes the reduced vanadium species without forming peroxovanadates, which are highly reactive and can lead to the formation of carbon oxides. The use of N2O as an oxidant results in a slower reoxidation process, which allows for a higher selectivity towards propene. However, the catalyst deactivation is a critical challenge in this process, as it is mainly caused by the reduction of vanadium species rather than the formation of carbonaceous deposits. The regeneration of the catalyst by heating under N2O at high temperatures can partly restore its activity, but complete restoration requires reoxidation in the presence of oxygen. To address these limitations and make N2O-ODHP a more feasible option for practical implementation, research directions could focus on developing more stable catalysts that can maintain their activity over longer periods, optimizing the reaction conditions to minimize vanadium reduction, and exploring alternative regeneration methods that can effectively restore the catalyst's activity without the need for high-temperature treatments.

Nitrous oxide (N2O) can improve the selectivity of the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) process by inhibiting the adsorption of O2 and/or increasing the reduction rate of the catalysts. The oxygen produced by the dissociation of N2O can oxidize propane to propene. In the presence of N2O, catalytic sites work in a more reduced state. N2O has been used as a pure oxidant in various reactions, including the oxidative coupling of methane to ethane, the transformation of benzene to phenol, and the oxidation of ethylene to epoxide. The use of N2O in ODHP can potentially lead to higher propylene selectivity compared to other oxidants by controlling the oxidation state of the catalyst and limiting the formation of non-selective oxygen species. Adjusting the concentration of N2O could be a useful strategy to modulate selectivity during the catalytic reaction.

Nitrous oxide (N2O) has been shown to significantly improve propene selectivity in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) compared to molecular oxygen (O2) when used as an oxidant. This improvement has been observed over various catalysts, including steam-activated iron-containing zeolites, bulk vanadium oxides, and supported vanadium-containing materials. A similar effect of N2O has also been reported for the oxidative dehydrogenation of n-butane over vanadium magnesium oxide catalysts. The positive effect of N2O on the ODHP reaction is attributed to the slower reoxidation of reduced VOx species compared to O2, resulting in a lower steady-state concentration of active lattice oxygen sites and thus suppressing the consecutive oxidation of propene to carbon oxides. However, the activity of VOx sites for consecutive propene oxidation increases with rising agglomerization degree. Propene selectivities do not differ much as long as the vanadium surface concentration remains below monolayer coverage, with only isolated VOx sites and small two-dimensional VxOy clusters present. When V2O5 nanocrystallites dominate, there is a dramatic drop in propene selectivity and direct total oxidation of propane occurs with both oxidants, although this detrimental effect is less pronounced in the presence of N2O. A recent study suggested that compared to N2O, other oxygen species (non-lattice oxygen of VOx species) are formed from gas-phase O2 and participate in COx formation. However, there is limited experimental information on the nature of active oxygen species formed from O2 and N2O upon reoxidation of reduced VOx species. The aim of this study is to obtain experimental evidence on the nature and structure of oxygen species formed upon reoxidation of reduced highly dispersed VOx species supported over MCM-41 with O2 and N2O. The same VOx/MCM-41 catalyst used in this work has previously been thoroughly characterized and tested in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane. A turnover frequency of propane conversion of 0.016 molC3H8 mol1 V s1 has been measured with O2 used as an oxidizing agent. In comparison, the respective value with N2O was only half as high, while the propene selectivity was higher, amounting to 80% with N2O but only to 50% with O2 at propane conversion of approximately 10%. Since several of the previously postulated oxygen species were paramagnetic, EPR spectroscopy under controlled atmosphere conditions was applied to experimentally identify oxygen species formed from gaseous N2O and O2 over VOx/MCM-41 and to explore the reactivity of these species towards oxidation of C3H8, C3H6, and CO.

Nitrous oxide (N2O) has been shown to be a superior oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) compared to other oxidants like oxygen (O2). Steam-activated iron zeolites (Fe-zeolites) have demonstrated high initial propene yields of 24% at temperatures between 773 and 798 K, which are comparable to the highest yields reported over vanadium (V) and molybdenum (Mo)-based catalysts using O2. The essential role of N2O in this process is highlighted by the fact that propene production does not occur when propane interacts with iron zeolites in the absence of N2O. The remarkable performance of Fe-zeolites is attributed to the specificity of N2O as a monooxygen donor and the capability of iron forms in the zeolite to coordinate reactive atomic oxygen species for efficient propane dehydrogenation. However, a major drawback is the deactivation by coke, causing a rapid decrease in propene yield. The rate of deactivation varies among the zeolites studied, with Fe-beta deactivating the fastest, followed by Fe-silicalite and FeZSM-5. The deactivation behavior of FeZSM-5 suggests the presence of active iron sites with different sensitivity for coke deactivation. Catalyst deactivation is a complex process that can be caused by a decrease in the number of active sites, a decrease in the quality of active sites, or a decrease in accessibility of the pore space.

N2O is a mono-oxygen donor that can efficiently dehydrogenate propane due to the ability of certain iron species to coordinate reactive atomic oxygen species. This specificity of N2O contributes to the remarkable performance of iron zeolites in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP). However, a major drawback of iron zeolites in ODHP with N2O is the deactivation by coke, which leads to a rapid decrease in propylene yield. The tapered element oscillating microbalance (TEOM) technique coupled with gas chromatography (GC) analysis has been used to correlate deactivation and mass changes due to coking. While TEOM provides detailed and accurate in situ investigation of coke formation, it does not provide information on the deactivation mechanism at the catalyst surface level. To gain a better understanding of the deactivation of iron-containing zeolites in the C3H8 + N2O reaction and the subsequent regeneration in air, complementary spectroscopic studies under reaction conditions are needed. In situ FTIR spectroscopy is suitable for assessing coke deactivation of zeolite catalysts in hydrocarbon conversion by monitoring the formation of carbonaceous deposits and changes in vibrations associated with the surface acidity and framework of the microporous material. Observing the evolution of the working catalyst under true process conditions is useful for an improved understanding of the ODHP reaction. However, in situ investigations of selective oxidation of hydrocarbons with N2O over iron-containing zeolites have not been reported. Moreover, the reusability of the regenerated catalysts has not yet been addressed in detail. Infrared results were complemented by TEOMGC experiments over the catalysts at the same conditions. The degree of catalyst reversibility on reaction and regeneration is evaluated and discussed on the basis of these analyses and characterization of the fresh, coked, and regenerated samples by X-ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and nitrogen adsorption.

Nitrous oxide (N2O) has been identified as a promising oxidant for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) to produce propylene, a key petrochemical feedstock. Compared to traditional oxidants like oxygen, N2O allows for the production of propylene at lower temperatures, which can improve the efficiency and selectivity of the process. The use of N2O as an oxidant in ODHP has been shown to achieve remarkable propylene yields, particularly when iron zeolites are used as catalysts. These catalysts have been found to be effective at lower temperatures than those required for mixed metal oxide catalysts, which typically operate at higher temperatures. However, the performance of iron zeolites can vary significantly depending on the method of iron incorporation and the preparation technique. Steam activation of iron-substituted ZSM-5 zeolites has been shown to result in superior propylene yields compared to other preparation methods. Iron impurities in steamed commercial H-ZSM-5 zeolites have also been found to induce high propylene selectivity, leading to low COx formation. A major challenge in the use of N2O for ODHP is the deactivation of iron zeolite catalysts due to coke formation, which can limit the stability and lifetime of the catalyst. Strategies to address this limitation could include the development of more stable catalyst formulations, optimization of reaction conditions to minimize coke formation, and the use of in situ regeneration techniques to maintain catalyst activity. Research directions that could potentially make N2O-ODHP a more feasible option for practical implementation include the exploration of alternative iron sources and incorporation methods, the design of catalysts with enhanced resistance to deactivation, and the development of integrated process designs that incorporate catalyst regeneration steps.

The use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) presents several advantages, particularly in terms of propylene selectivity compared to other oxidants. N2O, being a strong greenhouse gas, can be effectively utilized in this process, potentially offering environmental benefits. The substitution of N2O for oxygen leads to a significant increase in propylene selectivity across various catalysts, including iron-containing zeolites and vanadium-based catalysts. Iron-based materials, such as Fe-ZSM-5, have been identified as particularly effective in yielding high propylene (C3H6) in ODHP using N2O. Other redox metal catalysts, such as vanadium and molybdenum, have also been explored for this purpose. However, a critical challenge associated with the use of N2O in ODHP is the rapid deactivation of catalysts, primarily due to coke formation. This issue significantly limits the feasibility of N2O as an oxidant compared to softer oxidants like CO2. The quick deactivation of catalysts under N2O conditions necessitates further research to improve catalyst stability and to gain a clearer understanding of the deactivation mechanisms. Addressing these limitations could potentially make N2O-ODHP a more viable option for practical implementation. Strategies to overcome these limitations might include the development of more stable catalyst formulations, the optimization of reaction conditions to minimize coke formation, and the engineering of catalysts with enhanced resistance to deactivation. Additionally, in-depth studies to elucidate the precise mechanisms of deactivation could guide the design of more robust catalysts for N2O-ODHP processes.

Nitrous oxide (N2O) has been shown to modify the catalytic performances of the same catalyst in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODP) reaction. Principally, it decreases the conversion of propane and oxygen, increases the yield and selectivity to propylene, and decreases the yield and selectivity to CO2. In the presence of N2O, catalytic sites work in a more reduced state, leading to a more selective reaction. When the amount of N2O is higher than 300 ppm, oxygen species coming from N2O dissociation could also play a role, suggesting that N2O is also able to induce the ODP, although less oxidant than O2. However, the use of pure N2O to perform the ODP is not advisable as molecular oxygen is necessary to oxidize and regenerate the catalysts in the presence of N2O, otherwise the catalyst deactivates quickly. N2O reduces the catalysts (molybdenum), explaining the high carbon formation. It is the presence of both O2 and N2O (as promoter) that can fully explain the better selectivity of the catalysts in ODP, due to the modulation of their adequate oxidation state during the reaction.

The use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) has several advantages in terms of propylene selectivity compared to other oxidants. N2O's lower ability for catalyst reoxidation leads to an increase in the degree of catalyst reduction, which spatially separates active lattice oxygen in surface VOx species. This separation favors selective oxidation over the formation of COx. Propylene selectivity over V/g-Al2O3 materials can be improved by fully covering the support with well-dispersed VOx species. The selectivity can be further tuned by using N2O as an alternative oxidizing agent. The lower activity of N2O is due to its reduced ability to reoxidize reduced VOx sites, which enhances propene selectivity. This effect is attributed to the less favorable reoxidation of the catalyst by N2O compared to O2. The decrease in the steady-state concentration of active surface lattice oxygen of VOx species favors selective propane oxidation to propene over COx formation, as only one to two lattice oxygen are necessary for the former reaction. Active sites with more than two lattice oxygen species favor the formation of waste products like CO and CO2. The effect of the oxidizing agent on the catalytic performance is also related to the nature of oxygen species originating from O2 and N2O. It has been suggested that atomic oxygen species are responsible for selective oxidation, while polyatomic oxygen species take part in COx formation. However, direct experimental evidence is not available at this stage.

N2O is a highly efficient oxidant for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) over steam-activated FeZSM-5, achieving propene yields up to 25% at 723 K. The remarkable performance of iron zeolites in ODHP is attributed to the specificity of N2O as a monooxygen donor and the capability of iron forms in the zeolite to coordinate reactive atomic oxygen species for efficient dehydrogenation of propane. However, a major drawback is the deactivation by coke formation, leading to a rapid decrease in propene yield. The rate of deactivation is reduced with an increase in temperature, and the relatively slow deactivation of FeZSM-5 at 773 K is associated with high N2O conversion. The use of O2 as an oxidant in ODHP over FeZSM-5 leads to very low C3H6 yields (<5%) compared to N2O. The addition of small amounts of O2 to the C3H8+N2O mixture results in a decrease in C3H6 selectivity and an increase in COx production. The intermediates essential for propene production are negatively impacted by the presence of O2, severely deteriorating the performance of FeZSM-5 in N2O-mediated ODHP of propane. Strategies to address the limitations of catalyst deactivation and stability in N2O-ODHP include optimizing the reaction temperature to reduce deactivation rates, developing catalysts with improved resistance to coke formation, and exploring methods to regenerate the catalysts more efficiently. Research directions could focus on understanding the mechanisms of coke formation and identifying catalysts with active sites that are less susceptible to deactivation. Additionally, the development of cheap and selective catalyst systems for the low-temperature NH3 oxidation to N2O could provide a low-cost and reasonably pure source of N2O, making the process more feasible for practical implementation.

The literature does not provide a direct comparison of N2O as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) with other oxidants in terms of propylene selectivity. However, it does state that N2O is more selective than molecular oxygen in other oxidation reactions. The literature discusses the use of nickel molybdate catalysts in the ODHP process and the effects of adding N2O as a gas dope on the catalytic performance. The addition of N2O modifies the catalytic performances, with a decrease in propane conversion, an increase in propylene yield and selectivity, and a decrease in oxygen consumption and CO2 yield at low concentrations of N2O. At higher concentrations of N2O, the selectivity in propylene decreases, and carbonaceous products are formed. The literature does not address the critical challenges associated with catalyst deactivation and stability in the N2O-ODHP process. However, it does suggest that adjusting the concentration of promoters like N2O could be a useful tool to modulate the oxidation state of oxide catalysts and improve their catalytic performances.

The use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) has gained significant attention as an alternative to dioxygen. The primary advantage of N2O is its ability to produce propylene with higher selectivity compared to dioxygen, which tends to over-oxidize propane, leading to the formation of carbon oxides (CO and CO2) and lower olefin yields. Iron-zeolites, particularly Fe-ZSM-5, have been developed as unique catalysts for this process, with Fe-ZSM-5 exhibiting superior performance for ODHP with N2O after severe calcination. However, catalyst deactivation remains a critical challenge in the ODHP process, regardless of the oxidant used. The presence of propane as a reductant complicates the conversion of nitrous oxide on iron-zeolites, and the deactivation mechanism of catalysts in ODHP with N2O is not fully understood. Strategies to address these limitations could include further research into the deactivation mechanisms, development of more stable catalysts, and optimization of reaction conditions to minimize coke formation and maximize catalyst lifetime. These efforts could potentially make N2O-ODHP a more feasible option for practical implementation.

The use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) has the advantage of increasing propylene selectivity compared to other oxidants. This is because N2O decomposition is less favorable than O2 activation, leading to a decrease in the steady-state concentration of active sites and an increase in propene selectivity. The efficiency of isolated VOx species for selective ODHP is superimposed by non-selective oxidation over the naked surface of the acidic support, which is not covered by active vanadia. To achieve high performance in ODHP, it is desirable to design catalytic surfaces that are fully covered by well-dispersed vanadia species to avoid the strong adsorption of propene on the support surface. The steady-state concentration of active lattice oxygen, which takes part in propane and propene activation, should be optimized to control selective oxidation and combustion reactions. Using N2O instead of O2 can achieve this optimization.

Nitrous oxide (N2O) has been found to be advantageous as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) due to its ability to achieve higher propene selectivity compared to molecular oxygen (O2) at similar degrees of propane conversion. This is attributed to the weaker oxidizing potential of N2O, which inhibits the direct oxidation of propane and the consecutive oxidation of propene to carbon oxides (COx). The use of N2O as an oxidant results in a lower catalytic activity due to its weaker ability to re-oxidize the reduced surface vanadium oxide (VOx) species. However, there is no significant difference in propene selectivity between highly dispersed surface VOx species and crystalline V2O5 nanoparticles when N2O is used as an oxidant. In contrast, crystalline V2O5 nanoparticles are not selective for the ODHP reaction in the presence of O2. The positive effect of N2O on propene selectivity is related to the reduction in surface density (spatial separation) of active surface lattice oxygen in VOx species, as N2O is a weaker oxidant for re-oxidation of reduced VOx species compared to O2. From a stoichiometric point of view, selective propene formation is favored over combustion reactions at lower surface densities.

Nitrous oxide (N2O) has been shown to increase propylene selectivity in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) compared to other oxidants like oxygen (O2). This improvement is attributed to the lower ability of N2O to re-oxidize reduced vanadium oxide (VOx) species, leading to a higher degree of catalyst reduction. The use of N2O can result in up to three times higher propylene selectivity compared to O2, especially when the catalyst contains bulk-like V2O5 species. N2O reduces the tendency for direct propane combustion and consecutive propene oxidation to COx, leading to improved initial propene selectivity. The nature of oxygen species originating from O2 and N2O also plays a role in the selectivity and activity of the catalyst.

Nitrous oxide (N2O) has been shown to increase propene selectivity in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) over alumina- and silica-supported vanadia catalysts compared to O2. However, the ODP activity with N2O is lower than with O2. The degree of reduction of VOx species is suggested to be important for achieving high propene selectivity. The nature of oxygen species, whether adsorbed (nonlattice) or lattice, also influences COx formation. Adsorbed oxygen species are considered nonselective for the ODP reaction over certain catalysts. The redox dynamics of VOx species have been studied using in-situ UV/vis analysis, and the catalytic performance of different VOx/SiO2, VOx/MCM-41, and VOx/MCM-48 materials in the ODP reaction has been characterized. Nitrous oxide (N2O) has been found to be advantageous as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) compared to other oxidants like oxygen (O2). This is due to its ability to achieve higher propylene selectivity. The study of VOx/MCM-41, VOx/SiO2, and VOx/MCM-48 materials has shown that N2O can lead to a higher degree of reduction of vanadium species, which is essential for achieving high primary propylene selectivity and suppressing consecutive propylene oxidation to CO and CO2. The higher polymerized VOx species have a higher activity for consecutive propene oxidation, and the importance of direct propane oxidation and consecutive propene oxidation to COx is significantly higher in the presence of O2 than in N2O. The catalytic performance is determined by the oxidant activation, and N2O's lower oxidizing ability tunes the degree of reduction of vanadium species, leading to a higher reduction degree of VOx species. This effect is related to the spatial separation of active lattice oxygen species, reducing the surface density of active oxygen species. However, the degree of reduction of VOx species is not the only reason for the superior performance of N2O compared to O2. The nature of oxygen species also influences COx formation, with adsorbed (nonlattice) oxygen species being nonselective for the ODP reaction over certain catalytic materials. In contrast, N2O decomposition over reducible metal oxides yields mononuclear oxygen species, which are considered selective. The critical challenges associated with catalyst deactivation and stability in N2O-ODHP include the need for a high degree of reduction of vanadium species and the prevention of nonselective oxygen species formation. Strategies to address these limitations could involve the development of catalysts with controlled surface density of active oxygen species and the optimization of reaction conditions to favor selective oxygen species formation. Research directions could focus on understanding the mechanisms of oxygen species formation and their role in the selectivity of the ODHP process, as well as the development of new catalyst formulations that can maintain high activity and selectivity under N2O-ODHP conditions. Nitrous oxide (N2O) has been shown to have advantages over other oxidants in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP), particularly in terms of propylene selectivity. The use of N2O as an oxidant results in higher propylene selectivity compared to oxygen (O2) over a broad range of propane conversions. This effect is more pronounced for catalysts with microcrystalline V2O5. The improved selectivity is attributed to the ability of N2O to achieve a higher primary propene selectivity and to lower the activity for consecutive propene oxidation. N2O reoxidizes reduced VOx species slower than O2, which is essential for suppressing nonselective consecutive propene oxidation to COx. The nature of oxygen species also plays a role, with N2O not producing nonselective adsorbed oxygen species that can catalyze nonselective consecutive propene oxidation to COx. A variety of catalysts have been employed in the ODHP process, including VOx/SiO2, VOx/MCM-41, and VOx/MCM-48. These catalysts have been characterized using various techniques such as transmission electron microscopy (TEM), temperature-programmed reduction (TPR), UV/vis, Raman, and X-ray diffraction (XRD). The specific surface area of the catalysts decreases with vanadium loading, and the degree of polymerization of VOx species is influenced by the support material. The catalytic activity of the VOx(2.7)/MCM-41 catalyst is slightly higher than that of the VOx(2.8)/SiO2 and VOx(3.4)/MCM-48 samples, possibly due to a lower degree of polymerization of VOx species. The lowest activity was observed over the VOx(11.2)/MCM-41 sample, which possesses microcrystalline V2O5. Catalyst deactivation and stability are critical challenges in the ODHP process. The use of N2O as an oxidant can help mitigate these issues by reducing the formation of nonselective adsorbed oxygen species that can lead to catalyst deactivation. However, the lower activity of N2O compared to O2 can also be a limitation. Strategies to address these challenges include optimizing the catalyst structure and composition to enhance stability and selectivity, developing methods to regenerate deactivated catalysts, and exploring alternative oxidants that can provide high selectivity and activity while maintaining catalyst stability.

Nitrous oxide (N2O) has been used as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) to increase the selectivity to propylene compared to other oxidants. The catalysts employed in this process include a mixture of NiMoO4 and -Sb2O4, and a palladium supported on a mixed Zr-Ce-O oxide catalyst. The addition of N2O in the feed leads to a significant increase in the selectivity to propylene, while the conversion of propane and oxygen and the yield in CO2 decrease. N2O promotes the reduction of molybdenum, which is beneficial for the selectivity of the catalyst. However, the conversion of propane and the yield of CO2 decrease, which may limit the practical application of N2O-ODHP. The challenge of catalyst deactivation and stability is also a critical issue that needs to be addressed. Strategies to improve the stability of the catalysts and reduce the deactivation rate could potentially make N2O-ODHP a more feasible option for practical implementation. For example, the use of more stable catalysts or the development of new catalysts with higher activity and selectivity could be explored. Additionally, the optimization of the reaction conditions, such as temperature, pressure, and feed composition, could also help to improve the stability of the catalysts and reduce the deactivation rate.

Nitrous oxide (N2O) is an efficient oxidant for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) over steam-activated Fe-zeolites (MFI and BEA), achieving initial propylene yields up to 25% at 723 K. However, catalyst deactivation occurs due to coke formation.
          A tapered element oscillating microbalance (TEOM) coupled to GC analysis has been applied to correlate activity and deactivation by simultaneous measurements of reaction and coking.
          Extraframework iron species, generated during steam treatment, are essential for producing active catalysts.
          The nature and distribution of extraframework iron species, the zeolite host, and the catalyst acidity have no significant effect on the initial propene yield, but strongly influence the deactivation behavior.
          FeZSM-5 shows a remarkable resistance against deactivation, while a very rapid and complete deactivation occurred in FeBEA.
          The initial propene yield over FeZSM-5 and FeBEA was remarkably higher than over commercial H-ZSM-5 and H-BEA (with 3040 times lower iron content), although the residual activities after 400 min on stream were very similar.
          Remarkable yields toward propionaldehyde (up to 6%) have been obtained.
          A major drawback of FeMFI zeolites in ODHP with N2O is the deactivation by coke, causing a rapid decrease of the propene yield.
          The TEOM consists of a microreactor with a high-resolution microbalance that generates real-time measurements of mass changes during gas-solid reactions.
          The TEOM presents three main advantages over conventional gravimetric microbalances: a well-defined flow pattern, a very fast response time resolution (0.1 s), and a high mass resolution across the entire range of pressure and temperature.
          Steam activation is essential for achieving high catalytic activities, as concluded from the low conversion of reactants and propene yield obtained over the calcined iron zeolites.
          Extraframework iron species, generated during steam treatment, are responsible for the oxydehydrogenation of propane with nitrous oxide.
          The difference in initial C3H6 yield between ex-FeZSM-5 and ex-Fe-silicalite is marginal if their constitution with respect to iron is taken into account.
          The initial activity of the synthesized Fe-zeolites is significantly higher than over the commercial zeolites, while the former catalysts contain 30 40 times more iron.
          The rapid deactivation observed in ex-FeBEA and ex-H-BEA can be connected to the presence of large cavities with relatively small apertures in the BEA framework, especially at the intersection of the channels.
          The rate of deactivation over the MFI catalysts is significantly lower, and can be related to the absence of large cages in this zeolitic structure, since channels and intersections are of similar size.
          The higher deactivation resistance of steam-activated ex-FeZSM-5 in ODHP with N2O is unclear, but can be tentatively related to the different iron constitutions in both catalysts and/or the different porous structure associated with the presence of aluminum in the original zeolite framework.
          Ex-FeZSM-5 contains mesopores due to dealumination upon steam treatment, which are absent in ex-Fe-silicalite.
          The more open structure of FeZSM-5 may reduce pore blocking by coke and also improve transport of reactants and products, slowing down deactivation.
          The activity of ex-FeZSM-5 in direct N2O decomposition is significantly higher than that of ex-Fe-silicalite.
          N2O activation generates atomic oxygen over certain iron species, which is efficiently utilized for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane.
          However, recombination of atomic oxygen and desorption as O2 may lead to reaction with coke at specific locations of the zeolite at the operating temperature, resulting in COx.
          This function would partially regenerate the catalyst surface.
          This hypothesis would imply that highly active Fe-zeolite catalysts in direct N2O decomposition have an increased resistance toward coke deactivation in ODHP with N2O.

Nitrous oxide (N2O) is used as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) due to its ability to achieve higher propene selectivity compared to other oxidants, despite lower propane conversion. This is attributed to the fact that N2O reoxidizes the reduced vanadium species without forming peroxovanadates, which are highly reactive and can lead to the formation of carbon oxides. The use of N2O as an oxidant results in a slower reoxidation process, which allows for a higher selectivity towards propene. However, the catalyst deactivation is a critical challenge in this process, as it is mainly caused by the reduction of vanadium species rather than the formation of carbonaceous deposits. The regeneration of the catalyst by heating under N2O at high temperatures can partly restore its activity, but complete restoration requires reoxidation in the presence of oxygen. To address these limitations and make N2O-ODHP a more feasible option for practical implementation, research directions could focus on developing more stable catalysts that can maintain their activity over longer periods, optimizing the reaction conditions to minimize vanadium reduction, and exploring alternative regeneration methods that can effectively restore the catalyst's activity without the need for high-temperature treatments.

Nitrous oxide (N2O) can improve the selectivity of the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) process by inhibiting the adsorption of O2 and/or increasing the reduction rate of the catalysts. The oxygen produced by the dissociation of N2O can oxidize propane to propene. In the presence of N2O, catalytic sites work in a more reduced state. N2O has been used as a pure oxidant in various reactions, including the oxidative coupling of methane to ethane, the transformation of benzene to phenol, and the oxidation of ethylene to epoxide. The use of N2O in ODHP can potentially lead to higher propylene selectivity compared to other oxidants by controlling the oxidation state of the catalyst and limiting the formation of non-selective oxygen species. Adjusting the concentration of N2O could be a useful strategy to modulate selectivity during the catalytic reaction.

Nitrous oxide (N2O) has been shown to significantly improve propene selectivity in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) compared to molecular oxygen (O2) when used as an oxidant. This improvement has been observed over various catalysts, including steam-activated iron-containing zeolites, bulk vanadium oxides, and supported vanadium-containing materials. A similar effect of N2O has also been reported for the oxidative dehydrogenation of n-butane over vanadium magnesium oxide catalysts. The positive effect of N2O on the ODHP reaction is attributed to the slower reoxidation of reduced VOx species compared to O2, resulting in a lower steady-state concentration of active lattice oxygen sites and thus suppressing the consecutive oxidation of propene to carbon oxides. However, the activity of VOx sites for consecutive propene oxidation increases with rising agglomerization degree. Propene selectivities do not differ much as long as the vanadium surface concentration remains below monolayer coverage, with only isolated VOx sites and small two-dimensional VxOy clusters present. When V2O5 nanocrystallites dominate, there is a dramatic drop in propene selectivity and direct total oxidation of propane occurs with both oxidants, although this detrimental effect is less pronounced in the presence of N2O. A recent study suggested that compared to N2O, other oxygen species (non-lattice oxygen of VOx species) are formed from gas-phase O2 and participate in COx formation. However, there is limited experimental information on the nature of active oxygen species formed from O2 and N2O upon reoxidation of reduced VOx species. The aim of this study is to obtain experimental evidence on the nature and structure of oxygen species formed upon reoxidation of reduced highly dispersed VOx species supported over MCM-41 with O2 and N2O. The same VOx/MCM-41 catalyst used in this work has previously been thoroughly characterized and tested in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane. A turnover frequency of propane conversion of 0.016 molC3H8 mol1 V s1 has been measured with O2 used as an oxidizing agent. In comparison, the respective value with N2O was only half as high, while the propene selectivity was higher, amounting to 80% with N2O but only to 50% with O2 at propane conversion of approximately 10%. Since several of the previously postulated oxygen species were paramagnetic, EPR spectroscopy under controlled atmosphere conditions was applied to experimentally identify oxygen species formed from gaseous N2O and O2 over VOx/MCM-41 and to explore the reactivity of these species towards oxidation of C3H8, C3H6, and CO.

Nitrous oxide (N2O) has been shown to be a superior oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) compared to other oxidants like oxygen (O2). Steam-activated iron zeolites (Fe-zeolites) have demonstrated high initial propene yields of 24% at temperatures between 773 and 798 K, which are comparable to the highest yields reported over vanadium (V) and molybdenum (Mo)-based catalysts using O2. The essential role of N2O in this process is highlighted by the fact that propene production does not occur when propane interacts with iron zeolites in the absence of N2O. The remarkable performance of Fe-zeolites is attributed to the specificity of N2O as a monooxygen donor and the capability of iron forms in the zeolite to coordinate reactive atomic oxygen species for efficient propane dehydrogenation. However, a major drawback is the deactivation by coke, causing a rapid decrease in propene yield. The rate of deactivation varies among the zeolites studied, with Fe-beta deactivating the fastest, followed by Fe-silicalite and FeZSM-5. The deactivation behavior of FeZSM-5 suggests the presence of active iron sites with different sensitivity for coke deactivation. Catalyst deactivation is a complex process that can be caused by a decrease in the number of active sites, a decrease in the quality of active sites, or a decrease in accessibility of the pore space.

N2O is a mono-oxygen donor that can efficiently dehydrogenate propane due to the ability of certain iron species to coordinate reactive atomic oxygen species. This specificity of N2O contributes to the remarkable performance of iron zeolites in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP). However, a major drawback of iron zeolites in ODHP with N2O is the deactivation by coke, which leads to a rapid decrease in propylene yield. The tapered element oscillating microbalance (TEOM) technique coupled with gas chromatography (GC) analysis has been used to correlate deactivation and mass changes due to coking. While TEOM provides detailed and accurate in situ investigation of coke formation, it does not provide information on the deactivation mechanism at the catalyst surface level. To gain a better understanding of the deactivation of iron-containing zeolites in the C3H8 + N2O reaction and the subsequent regeneration in air, complementary spectroscopic studies under reaction conditions are needed. In situ FTIR spectroscopy is suitable for assessing coke deactivation of zeolite catalysts in hydrocarbon conversion by monitoring the formation of carbonaceous deposits and changes in vibrations associated with the surface acidity and framework of the microporous material. Observing the evolution of the working catalyst under true process conditions is useful for an improved understanding of the ODHP reaction. However, in situ investigations of selective oxidation of hydrocarbons with N2O over iron-containing zeolites have not been reported. Moreover, the reusability of the regenerated catalysts has not yet been addressed in detail. Infrared results were complemented by TEOMGC experiments over the catalysts at the same conditions. The degree of catalyst reversibility on reaction and regeneration is evaluated and discussed on the basis of these analyses and characterization of the fresh, coked, and regenerated samples by X-ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and nitrogen adsorption.

Nitrous oxide (N2O) has been identified as a promising oxidant for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) to produce propylene, a key petrochemical feedstock. Compared to traditional oxidants like oxygen, N2O allows for the production of propylene at lower temperatures, which can improve the efficiency and selectivity of the process. The use of N2O as an oxidant in ODHP has been shown to achieve remarkable propylene yields, particularly when iron zeolites are used as catalysts. These catalysts have been found to be effective at lower temperatures than those required for mixed metal oxide catalysts, which typically operate at higher temperatures. However, the performance of iron zeolites can vary significantly depending on the method of iron incorporation and the preparation technique. Steam activation of iron-substituted ZSM-5 zeolites has been shown to result in superior propylene yields compared to other preparation methods. Iron impurities in steamed commercial H-ZSM-5 zeolites have also been found to induce high propylene selectivity, leading to low COx formation. A major challenge in the use of N2O for ODHP is the deactivation of iron zeolite catalysts due to coke formation, which can limit the stability and lifetime of the catalyst. Strategies to address this limitation could include the development of more stable catalyst formulations, optimization of reaction conditions to minimize coke formation, and the use of in situ regeneration techniques to maintain catalyst activity. Research directions that could potentially make N2O-ODHP a more feasible option for practical implementation include the exploration of alternative iron sources and incorporation methods, the design of catalysts with enhanced resistance to deactivation, and the development of integrated process designs that incorporate catalyst regeneration steps.

The use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) presents several advantages, particularly in terms of propylene selectivity compared to other oxidants. N2O, being a strong greenhouse gas, can be effectively utilized in this process, potentially offering environmental benefits. The substitution of N2O for oxygen leads to a significant increase in propylene selectivity across various catalysts, including iron-containing zeolites and vanadium-based catalysts. Iron-based materials, such as Fe-ZSM-5, have been identified as particularly effective in yielding high propylene (C3H6) in ODHP using N2O. Other redox metal catalysts, such as vanadium and molybdenum, have also been explored for this purpose. However, a critical challenge associated with the use of N2O in ODHP is the rapid deactivation of catalysts, primarily due to coke formation. This issue significantly limits the feasibility of N2O as an oxidant compared to softer oxidants like CO2. The quick deactivation of catalysts under N2O conditions necessitates further research to improve catalyst stability and to gain a clearer understanding of the deactivation mechanisms. Addressing these limitations could potentially make N2O-ODHP a more viable option for practical implementation. Strategies to overcome these limitations might include the development of more stable catalyst formulations, the optimization of reaction conditions to minimize coke formation, and the engineering of catalysts with enhanced resistance to deactivation. Additionally, in-depth studies to elucidate the precise mechanisms of deactivation could guide the design of more robust catalysts for N2O-ODHP processes.

Nitrous oxide (N2O) has been shown to modify the catalytic performances of the same catalyst in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODP) reaction. Principally, it decreases the conversion of propane and oxygen, increases the yield and selectivity to propylene, and decreases the yield and selectivity to CO2. In the presence of N2O, catalytic sites work in a more reduced state, leading to a more selective reaction. When the amount of N2O is higher than 300 ppm, oxygen species coming from N2O dissociation could also play a role, suggesting that N2O is also able to induce the ODP, although less oxidant than O2. However, the use of pure N2O to perform the ODP is not advisable as molecular oxygen is necessary to oxidize and regenerate the catalysts in the presence of N2O, otherwise the catalyst deactivates quickly. N2O reduces the catalysts (molybdenum), explaining the high carbon formation. It is the presence of both O2 and N2O (as promoter) that can fully explain the better selectivity of the catalysts in ODP, due to the modulation of their adequate oxidation state during the reaction.

The use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) has several advantages in terms of propylene selectivity compared to other oxidants. N2O's lower ability for catalyst reoxidation leads to an increase in the degree of catalyst reduction, which spatially separates active lattice oxygen in surface VOx species. This separation favors selective oxidation over the formation of COx. Propylene selectivity over V/g-Al2O3 materials can be improved by fully covering the support with well-dispersed VOx species. The selectivity can be further tuned by using N2O as an alternative oxidizing agent. The lower activity of N2O is due to its reduced ability to reoxidize reduced VOx sites, which enhances propene selectivity. This effect is attributed to the less favorable reoxidation of the catalyst by N2O compared to O2. The decrease in the steady-state concentration of active surface lattice oxygen of VOx species favors selective propane oxidation to propene over COx formation, as only one to two lattice oxygen are necessary for the former reaction. Active sites with more than two lattice oxygen species favor the formation of waste products like CO and CO2. The effect of the oxidizing agent on the catalytic performance is also related to the nature of oxygen species originating from O2 and N2O. It has been suggested that atomic oxygen species are responsible for selective oxidation, while polyatomic oxygen species take part in COx formation. However, direct experimental evidence is not available at this stage.

N2O is a highly efficient oxidant for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) over steam-activated FeZSM-5, achieving propene yields up to 25% at 723 K. The remarkable performance of iron zeolites in ODHP is attributed to the specificity of N2O as a monooxygen donor and the capability of iron forms in the zeolite to coordinate reactive atomic oxygen species for efficient dehydrogenation of propane. However, a major drawback is the deactivation by coke formation, leading to a rapid decrease in propene yield. The rate of deactivation is reduced with an increase in temperature, and the relatively slow deactivation of FeZSM-5 at 773 K is associated with high N2O conversion. The use of O2 as an oxidant in ODHP over FeZSM-5 leads to very low C3H6 yields (<5%) compared to N2O. The addition of small amounts of O2 to the C3H8+N2O mixture results in a decrease in C3H6 selectivity and an increase in COx production. The intermediates essential for propene production are negatively impacted by the presence of O2, severely deteriorating the performance of FeZSM-5 in N2O-mediated ODHP of propane. Strategies to address the limitations of catalyst deactivation and stability in N2O-ODHP include optimizing the reaction temperature to reduce deactivation rates, developing catalysts with improved resistance to coke formation, and exploring methods to regenerate the catalysts more efficiently. Research directions could focus on understanding the mechanisms of coke formation and identifying catalysts with active sites that are less susceptible to deactivation. Additionally, the development of cheap and selective catalyst systems for the low-temperature NH3 oxidation to N2O could provide a low-cost and reasonably pure source of N2O, making the process more feasible for practical implementation.

The literature does not provide a direct comparison of N2O as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) with other oxidants in terms of propylene selectivity. However, it does state that N2O is more selective than molecular oxygen in other oxidation reactions. The literature discusses the use of nickel molybdate catalysts in the ODHP process and the effects of adding N2O as a gas dope on the catalytic performance. The addition of N2O modifies the catalytic performances, with a decrease in propane conversion, an increase in propylene yield and selectivity, and a decrease in oxygen consumption and CO2 yield at low concentrations of N2O. At higher concentrations of N2O, the selectivity in propylene decreases, and carbonaceous products are formed. The literature does not address the critical challenges associated with catalyst deactivation and stability in the N2O-ODHP process. However, it does suggest that adjusting the concentration of promoters like N2O could be a useful tool to modulate the oxidation state of oxide catalysts and improve their catalytic performances.

The use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) has gained significant attention as an alternative to dioxygen. The primary advantage of N2O is its ability to produce propylene with higher selectivity compared to dioxygen, which tends to over-oxidize propane, leading to the formation of carbon oxides (CO and CO2) and lower olefin yields. Iron-zeolites, particularly Fe-ZSM-5, have been developed as unique catalysts for this process, with Fe-ZSM-5 exhibiting superior performance for ODHP with N2O after severe calcination. However, catalyst deactivation remains a critical challenge in the ODHP process, regardless of the oxidant used. The presence of propane as a reductant complicates the conversion of nitrous oxide on iron-zeolites, and the deactivation mechanism of catalysts in ODHP with N2O is not fully understood. Strategies to address these limitations could include further research into the deactivation mechanisms, development of more stable catalysts, and optimization of reaction conditions to minimize coke formation and maximize catalyst lifetime. These efforts could potentially make N2O-ODHP a more feasible option for practical implementation.

The use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) has the advantage of increasing propylene selectivity compared to other oxidants. This is because N2O decomposition is less favorable than O2 activation, leading to a decrease in the steady-state concentration of active sites and an increase in propene selectivity. The efficiency of isolated VOx species for selective ODHP is superimposed by non-selective oxidation over the naked surface of the acidic support, which is not covered by active vanadia. To achieve high performance in ODHP, it is desirable to design catalytic surfaces that are fully covered by well-dispersed vanadia species to avoid the strong adsorption of propene on the support surface. The steady-state concentration of active lattice oxygen, which takes part in propane and propene activation, should be optimized to control selective oxidation and combustion reactions. Using N2O instead of O2 can achieve this optimization.

Nitrous oxide (N2O) has been found to be advantageous as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) due to its ability to achieve higher propene selectivity compared to molecular oxygen (O2) at similar degrees of propane conversion. This is attributed to the weaker oxidizing potential of N2O, which inhibits the direct oxidation of propane and the consecutive oxidation of propene to carbon oxides (COx). The use of N2O as an oxidant results in a lower catalytic activity due to its weaker ability to re-oxidize the reduced surface vanadium oxide (VOx) species. However, there is no significant difference in propene selectivity between highly dispersed surface VOx species and crystalline V2O5 nanoparticles when N2O is used as an oxidant. In contrast, crystalline V2O5 nanoparticles are not selective for the ODHP reaction in the presence of O2. The positive effect of N2O on propene selectivity is related to the reduction in surface density (spatial separation) of active surface lattice oxygen in VOx species, as N2O is a weaker oxidant for re-oxidation of reduced VOx species compared to O2. From a stoichiometric point of view, selective propene formation is favored over combustion reactions at lower surface densities.

Nitrous oxide (N2O) has been shown to increase propylene selectivity in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) compared to other oxidants like oxygen (O2). This improvement is attributed to the lower ability of N2O to re-oxidize reduced vanadium oxide (VOx) species, leading to a higher degree of catalyst reduction. The use of N2O can result in up to three times higher propylene selectivity compared to O2, especially when the catalyst contains bulk-like V2O5 species. N2O reduces the tendency for direct propane combustion and consecutive propene oxidation to COx, leading to improved initial propene selectivity. The nature of oxygen species originating from O2 and N2O also plays a role in the selectivity and activity of the catalyst.

Nitrous oxide (N2O) has been shown to increase propene selectivity in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) over alumina- and silica-supported vanadia catalysts compared to O2. However, the ODP activity with N2O is lower than with O2. The degree of reduction of VOx species is suggested to be important for achieving high propene selectivity. The nature of oxygen species, whether adsorbed (nonlattice) or lattice, also influences COx formation. Adsorbed oxygen species are considered nonselective for the ODP reaction over certain catalysts. The redox dynamics of VOx species have been studied using in-situ UV/vis analysis, and the catalytic performance of different VOx/SiO2, VOx/MCM-41, and VOx/MCM-48 materials in the ODP reaction has been characterized. Nitrous oxide (N2O) has been found to be advantageous as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) compared to other oxidants like oxygen (O2). This is due to its ability to achieve higher propylene selectivity. The study of VOx/MCM-41, VOx/SiO2, and VOx/MCM-48 materials has shown that N2O can lead to a higher degree of reduction of vanadium species, which is essential for achieving high primary propylene selectivity and suppressing consecutive propylene oxidation to CO and CO2. The higher polymerized VOx species have a higher activity for consecutive propene oxidation, and the importance of direct propane oxidation and consecutive propene oxidation to COx is significantly higher in the presence of O2 than in N2O. The catalytic performance is determined by the oxidant activation, and N2O's lower oxidizing ability tunes the degree of reduction of vanadium species, leading to a higher reduction degree of VOx species. This effect is related to the spatial separation of active lattice oxygen species, reducing the surface density of active oxygen species. However, the degree of reduction of VOx species is not the only reason for the superior performance of N2O compared to O2. The nature of oxygen species also influences COx formation, with adsorbed (nonlattice) oxygen species being nonselective for the ODP reaction over certain catalytic materials. In contrast, N2O decomposition over reducible metal oxides yields mononuclear oxygen species, which are considered selective. The critical challenges associated with catalyst deactivation and stability in N2O-ODHP include the need for a high degree of reduction of vanadium species and the prevention of nonselective oxygen species formation. Strategies to address these limitations could involve the development of catalysts with controlled surface density of active oxygen species and the optimization of reaction conditions to favor selective oxygen species formation. Research directions could focus on understanding the mechanisms of oxygen species formation and their role in the selectivity of the ODHP process, as well as the development of new catalyst formulations that can maintain high activity and selectivity under N2O-ODHP conditions. Nitrous oxide (N2O) has been shown to have advantages over other oxidants in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP), particularly in terms of propylene selectivity. The use of N2O as an oxidant results in higher propylene selectivity compared to oxygen (O2) over a broad range of propane conversions. This effect is more pronounced for catalysts with microcrystalline V2O5. The improved selectivity is attributed to the ability of N2O to achieve a higher primary propene selectivity and to lower the activity for consecutive propene oxidation. N2O reoxidizes reduced VOx species slower than O2, which is essential for suppressing nonselective consecutive propene oxidation to COx. The nature of oxygen species also plays a role, with N2O not producing nonselective adsorbed oxygen species that can catalyze nonselective consecutive propene oxidation to COx. A variety of catalysts have been employed in the ODHP process, including VOx/SiO2, VOx/MCM-41, and VOx/MCM-48. These catalysts have been characterized using various techniques such as transmission electron microscopy (TEM), temperature-programmed reduction (TPR), UV/vis, Raman, and X-ray diffraction (XRD). The specific surface area of the catalysts decreases with vanadium loading, and the degree of polymerization of VOx species is influenced by the support material. The catalytic activity of the VOx(2.7)/MCM-41 catalyst is slightly higher than that of the VOx(2.8)/SiO2 and VOx(3.4)/MCM-48 samples, possibly due to a lower degree of polymerization of VOx species. The lowest activity was observed over the VOx(11.2)/MCM-41 sample, which possesses microcrystalline V2O5. Catalyst deactivation and stability are critical challenges in the ODHP process. The use of N2O as an oxidant can help mitigate these issues by reducing the formation of nonselective adsorbed oxygen species that can lead to catalyst deactivation. However, the lower activity of N2O compared to O2 can also be a limitation. Strategies to address these challenges include optimizing the catalyst structure and composition to enhance stability and selectivity, developing methods to regenerate deactivated catalysts, and exploring alternative oxidants that can provide high selectivity and activity while maintaining catalyst stability.

Nitrous oxide (N2O) has been used as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) to increase the selectivity to propylene compared to other oxidants. The catalysts employed in this process include a mixture of NiMoO4 and -Sb2O4, and a palladium supported on a mixed Zr-Ce-O oxide catalyst. The addition of N2O in the feed leads to a significant increase in the selectivity to propylene, while the conversion of propane and oxygen and the yield in CO2 decrease. N2O promotes the reduction of molybdenum, which is beneficial for the selectivity of the catalyst. However, the conversion of propane and the yield of CO2 decrease, which may limit the practical application of N2O-ODHP. The challenge of catalyst deactivation and stability is also a critical issue that needs to be addressed. Strategies to improve the stability of the catalysts and reduce the deactivation rate could potentially make N2O-ODHP a more feasible option for practical implementation. For example, the use of more stable catalysts or the development of new catalysts with higher activity and selectivity could be explored. Additionally, the optimization of the reaction conditions, such as temperature, pressure, and feed composition, could also help to improve the stability of the catalysts and reduce the deactivation rate.

Nitrous oxide (N2O) is an efficient oxidant for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) over steam-activated Fe-zeolites (MFI and BEA), achieving initial propylene yields up to 25% at 723 K. However, catalyst deactivation occurs due to coke formation.
          A tapered element oscillating microbalance (TEOM) coupled to GC analysis has been applied to correlate activity and deactivation by simultaneous measurements of reaction and coking.
          Extraframework iron species, generated during steam treatment, are essential for producing active catalysts.
          The nature and distribution of extraframework iron species, the zeolite host, and the catalyst acidity have no significant effect on the initial propene yield, but strongly influence the deactivation behavior.
          FeZSM-5 shows a remarkable resistance against deactivation, while a very rapid and complete deactivation occurred in FeBEA.
          The initial propene yield over FeZSM-5 and FeBEA was remarkably higher than over commercial H-ZSM-5 and H-BEA (with 3040 times lower iron content), although the residual activities after 400 min on stream were very similar.
          Remarkable yields toward propionaldehyde (up to 6%) have been obtained.
          A major drawback of FeMFI zeolites in ODHP with N2O is the deactivation by coke, causing a rapid decrease of the propene yield.
          The TEOM consists of a microreactor with a high-resolution microbalance that generates real-time measurements of mass changes during gas-solid reactions.
          The TEOM presents three main advantages over conventional gravimetric microbalances: a well-defined flow pattern, a very fast response time resolution (0.1 s), and a high mass resolution across the entire range of pressure and temperature.
          Steam activation is essential for achieving high catalytic activities, as concluded from the low conversion of reactants and propene yield obtained over the calcined iron zeolites.
          Extraframework iron species, generated during steam treatment, are responsible for the oxydehydrogenation of propane with nitrous oxide.
          The difference in initial C3H6 yield between ex-FeZSM-5 and ex-Fe-silicalite is marginal if their constitution with respect to iron is taken into account.
          The initial activity of the synthesized Fe-zeolites is significantly higher than over the commercial zeolites, while the former catalysts contain 30 40 times more iron.
          The rapid deactivation observed in ex-FeBEA and ex-H-BEA can be connected to the presence of large cavities with relatively small apertures in the BEA framework, especially at the intersection of the channels.
          The rate of deactivation over the MFI catalysts is significantly lower, and can be related to the absence of large cages in this zeolitic structure, since channels and intersections are of similar size.
          The higher deactivation resistance of steam-activated ex-FeZSM-5 in ODHP with N2O is unclear, but can be tentatively related to the different iron constitutions in both catalysts and/or the different porous structure associated with the presence of aluminum in the original zeolite framework.
          Ex-FeZSM-5 contains mesopores due to dealumination upon steam treatment, which are absent in ex-Fe-silicalite.
          The more open structure of FeZSM-5 may reduce pore blocking by coke and also improve transport of reactants and products, slowing down deactivation.
          The activity of ex-FeZSM-5 in direct N2O decomposition is significantly higher than that of ex-Fe-silicalite.
          N2O activation generates atomic oxygen over certain iron species, which is efficiently utilized for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane.
          However, recombination of atomic oxygen and desorption as O2 may lead to reaction with coke at specific locations of the zeolite at the operating temperature, resulting in COx.
          This function would partially regenerate the catalyst surface.
          This hypothesis would imply that highly active Fe-zeolite catalysts in direct N2O decomposition have an increased resistance toward coke deactivation in ODHP with N2O.

Nitrous oxide (N2O) is used as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) due to its ability to achieve higher propene selectivity compared to other oxidants, despite lower propane conversion. This is attributed to the fact that N2O reoxidizes the reduced vanadium species without forming peroxovanadates, which are highly reactive and can lead to the formation of carbon oxides. The use of N2O as an oxidant results in a slower reoxidation process, which allows for a higher selectivity towards propene. However, the catalyst deactivation is a critical challenge in this process, as it is mainly caused by the reduction of vanadium species rather than the formation of carbonaceous deposits. The regeneration of the catalyst by heating under N2O at high temperatures can partly restore its activity, but complete restoration requires reoxidation in the presence of oxygen. To address these limitations and make N2O-ODHP a more feasible option for practical implementation, research directions could focus on developing more stable catalysts that can maintain their activity over longer periods, optimizing the reaction conditions to minimize vanadium reduction, and exploring alternative regeneration methods that can effectively restore the catalyst's activity without the need for high-temperature treatments.

Nitrous oxide (N2O) can improve the selectivity of the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) process by inhibiting the adsorption of O2 and/or increasing the reduction rate of the catalysts. The oxygen produced by the dissociation of N2O can oxidize propane to propene. In the presence of N2O, catalytic sites work in a more reduced state. N2O has been used as a pure oxidant in various reactions, including the oxidative coupling of methane to ethane, the transformation of benzene to phenol, and the oxidation of ethylene to epoxide. The use of N2O in ODHP can potentially lead to higher propylene selectivity compared to other oxidants by controlling the oxidation state of the catalyst and limiting the formation of non-selective oxygen species. Adjusting the concentration of N2O could be a useful strategy to modulate selectivity during the catalytic reaction.

Nitrous oxide (N2O) has been shown to significantly improve propene selectivity in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) compared to molecular oxygen (O2) when used as an oxidant. This improvement has been observed over various catalysts, including steam-activated iron-containing zeolites, bulk vanadium oxides, and supported vanadium-containing materials. A similar effect of N2O has also been reported for the oxidative dehydrogenation of n-butane over vanadium magnesium oxide catalysts. The positive effect of N2O on the ODHP reaction is attributed to the slower reoxidation of reduced VOx species compared to O2, resulting in a lower steady-state concentration of active lattice oxygen sites and thus suppressing the consecutive oxidation of propene to carbon oxides. However, the activity of VOx sites for consecutive propene oxidation increases with rising agglomerization degree. Propene selectivities do not differ much as long as the vanadium surface concentration remains below monolayer coverage, with only isolated VOx sites and small two-dimensional VxOy clusters present. When V2O5 nanocrystallites dominate, there is a dramatic drop in propene selectivity and direct total oxidation of propane occurs with both oxidants, although this detrimental effect is less pronounced in the presence of N2O. A recent study suggested that compared to N2O, other oxygen species (non-lattice oxygen of VOx species) are formed from gas-phase O2 and participate in COx formation. However, there is limited experimental information on the nature of active oxygen species formed from O2 and N2O upon reoxidation of reduced VOx species. The aim of this study is to obtain experimental evidence on the nature and structure of oxygen species formed upon reoxidation of reduced highly dispersed VOx species supported over MCM-41 with O2 and N2O. The same VOx/MCM-41 catalyst used in this work has previously been thoroughly characterized and tested in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane. A turnover frequency of propane conversion of 0.016 molC3H8 mol1 V s1 has been measured with O2 used as an oxidizing agent. In comparison, the respective value with N2O was only half as high, while the propene selectivity was higher, amounting to 80% with N2O but only to 50% with O2 at propane conversion of approximately 10%. Since several of the previously postulated oxygen species were paramagnetic, EPR spectroscopy under controlled atmosphere conditions was applied to experimentally identify oxygen species formed from gaseous N2O and O2 over VOx/MCM-41 and to explore the reactivity of these species towards oxidation of C3H8, C3H6, and CO.

Nitrous oxide (N2O) has been shown to be a superior oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) compared to other oxidants like oxygen (O2). Steam-activated iron zeolites (Fe-zeolites) have demonstrated high initial propene yields of 24% at temperatures between 773 and 798 K, which are comparable to the highest yields reported over vanadium (V) and molybdenum (Mo)-based catalysts using O2. The essential role of N2O in this process is highlighted by the fact that propene production does not occur when propane interacts with iron zeolites in the absence of N2O. The remarkable performance of Fe-zeolites is attributed to the specificity of N2O as a monooxygen donor and the capability of iron forms in the zeolite to coordinate reactive atomic oxygen species for efficient propane dehydrogenation. However, a major drawback is the deactivation by coke, causing a rapid decrease in propene yield. The rate of deactivation varies among the zeolites studied, with Fe-beta deactivating the fastest, followed by Fe-silicalite and FeZSM-5. The deactivation behavior of FeZSM-5 suggests the presence of active iron sites with different sensitivity for coke deactivation. Catalyst deactivation is a complex process that can be caused by a decrease in the number of active sites, a decrease in the quality of active sites, or a decrease in accessibility of the pore space.

N2O is a mono-oxygen donor that can efficiently dehydrogenate propane due to the ability of certain iron species to coordinate reactive atomic oxygen species. This specificity of N2O contributes to the remarkable performance of iron zeolites in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP). However, a major drawback of iron zeolites in ODHP with N2O is the deactivation by coke, which leads to a rapid decrease in propylene yield. The tapered element oscillating microbalance (TEOM) technique coupled with gas chromatography (GC) analysis has been used to correlate deactivation and mass changes due to coking. While TEOM provides detailed and accurate in situ investigation of coke formation, it does not provide information on the deactivation mechanism at the catalyst surface level. To gain a better understanding of the deactivation of iron-containing zeolites in the C3H8 + N2O reaction and the subsequent regeneration in air, complementary spectroscopic studies under reaction conditions are needed. In situ FTIR spectroscopy is suitable for assessing coke deactivation of zeolite catalysts in hydrocarbon conversion by monitoring the formation of carbonaceous deposits and changes in vibrations associated with the surface acidity and framework of the microporous material. Observing the evolution of the working catalyst under true process conditions is useful for an improved understanding of the ODHP reaction. However, in situ investigations of selective oxidation of hydrocarbons with N2O over iron-containing zeolites have not been reported. Moreover, the reusability of the regenerated catalysts has not yet been addressed in detail. Infrared results were complemented by TEOMGC experiments over the catalysts at the same conditions. The degree of catalyst reversibility on reaction and regeneration is evaluated and discussed on the basis of these analyses and characterization of the fresh, coked, and regenerated samples by X-ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and nitrogen adsorption.

Nitrous oxide (N2O) has been identified as a promising oxidant for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) to produce propylene, a key petrochemical feedstock. Compared to traditional oxidants like oxygen, N2O allows for the production of propylene at lower temperatures, which can improve the efficiency and selectivity of the process. The use of N2O as an oxidant in ODHP has been shown to achieve remarkable propylene yields, particularly when iron zeolites are used as catalysts. These catalysts have been found to be effective at lower temperatures than those required for mixed metal oxide catalysts, which typically operate at higher temperatures. However, the performance of iron zeolites can vary significantly depending on the method of iron incorporation and the preparation technique. Steam activation of iron-substituted ZSM-5 zeolites has been shown to result in superior propylene yields compared to other preparation methods. Iron impurities in steamed commercial H-ZSM-5 zeolites have also been found to induce high propylene selectivity, leading to low COx formation. A major challenge in the use of N2O for ODHP is the deactivation of iron zeolite catalysts due to coke formation, which can limit the stability and lifetime of the catalyst. Strategies to address this limitation could include the development of more stable catalyst formulations, optimization of reaction conditions to minimize coke formation, and the use of in situ regeneration techniques to maintain catalyst activity. Research directions that could potentially make N2O-ODHP a more feasible option for practical implementation include the exploration of alternative iron sources and incorporation methods, the design of catalysts with enhanced resistance to deactivation, and the development of integrated process designs that incorporate catalyst regeneration steps.

The use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) presents several advantages, particularly in terms of propylene selectivity compared to other oxidants. N2O, being a strong greenhouse gas, can be effectively utilized in this process, potentially offering environmental benefits. The substitution of N2O for oxygen leads to a significant increase in propylene selectivity across various catalysts, including iron-containing zeolites and vanadium-based catalysts. Iron-based materials, such as Fe-ZSM-5, have been identified as particularly effective in yielding high propylene (C3H6) in ODHP using N2O. Other redox metal catalysts, such as vanadium and molybdenum, have also been explored for this purpose. However, a critical challenge associated with the use of N2O in ODHP is the rapid deactivation of catalysts, primarily due to coke formation. This issue significantly limits the feasibility of N2O as an oxidant compared to softer oxidants like CO2. The quick deactivation of catalysts under N2O conditions necessitates further research to improve catalyst stability and to gain a clearer understanding of the deactivation mechanisms. Addressing these limitations could potentially make N2O-ODHP a more viable option for practical implementation. Strategies to overcome these limitations might include the development of more stable catalyst formulations, the optimization of reaction conditions to minimize coke formation, and the engineering of catalysts with enhanced resistance to deactivation. Additionally, in-depth studies to elucidate the precise mechanisms of deactivation could guide the design of more robust catalysts for N2O-ODHP processes.

Nitrous oxide (N2O) has been shown to modify the catalytic performances of the same catalyst in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODP) reaction. Principally, it decreases the conversion of propane and oxygen, increases the yield and selectivity to propylene, and decreases the yield and selectivity to CO2. In the presence of N2O, catalytic sites work in a more reduced state, leading to a more selective reaction. When the amount of N2O is higher than 300 ppm, oxygen species coming from N2O dissociation could also play a role, suggesting that N2O is also able to induce the ODP, although less oxidant than O2. However, the use of pure N2O to perform the ODP is not advisable as molecular oxygen is necessary to oxidize and regenerate the catalysts in the presence of N2O, otherwise the catalyst deactivates quickly. N2O reduces the catalysts (molybdenum), explaining the high carbon formation. It is the presence of both O2 and N2O (as promoter) that can fully explain the better selectivity of the catalysts in ODP, due to the modulation of their adequate oxidation state during the reaction.

The use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) has several advantages in terms of propylene selectivity compared to other oxidants. N2O's lower ability for catalyst reoxidation leads to an increase in the degree of catalyst reduction, which spatially separates active lattice oxygen in surface VOx species. This separation favors selective oxidation over the formation of COx. Propylene selectivity over V/g-Al2O3 materials can be improved by fully covering the support with well-dispersed VOx species. The selectivity can be further tuned by using N2O as an alternative oxidizing agent. The lower activity of N2O is due to its reduced ability to reoxidize reduced VOx sites, which enhances propene selectivity. This effect is attributed to the less favorable reoxidation of the catalyst by N2O compared to O2. The decrease in the steady-state concentration of active surface lattice oxygen of VOx species favors selective propane oxidation to propene over COx formation, as only one to two lattice oxygen are necessary for the former reaction. Active sites with more than two lattice oxygen species favor the formation of waste products like CO and CO2. The effect of the oxidizing agent on the catalytic performance is also related to the nature of oxygen species originating from O2 and N2O. It has been suggested that atomic oxygen species are responsible for selective oxidation, while polyatomic oxygen species take part in COx formation. However, direct experimental evidence is not available at this stage.

N2O is a highly efficient oxidant for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) over steam-activated FeZSM-5, achieving propene yields up to 25% at 723 K. The remarkable performance of iron zeolites in ODHP is attributed to the specificity of N2O as a monooxygen donor and the capability of iron forms in the zeolite to coordinate reactive atomic oxygen species for efficient dehydrogenation of propane. However, a major drawback is the deactivation by coke formation, leading to a rapid decrease in propene yield. The rate of deactivation is reduced with an increase in temperature, and the relatively slow deactivation of FeZSM-5 at 773 K is associated with high N2O conversion. The use of O2 as an oxidant in ODHP over FeZSM-5 leads to very low C3H6 yields (<5%) compared to N2O. The addition of small amounts of O2 to the C3H8+N2O mixture results in a decrease in C3H6 selectivity and an increase in COx production. The intermediates essential for propene production are negatively impacted by the presence of O2, severely deteriorating the performance of FeZSM-5 in N2O-mediated ODHP of propane. Strategies to address the limitations of catalyst deactivation and stability in N2O-ODHP include optimizing the reaction temperature to reduce deactivation rates, developing catalysts with improved resistance to coke formation, and exploring methods to regenerate the catalysts more efficiently. Research directions could focus on understanding the mechanisms of coke formation and identifying catalysts with active sites that are less susceptible to deactivation. Additionally, the development of cheap and selective catalyst systems for the low-temperature NH3 oxidation to N2O could provide a low-cost and reasonably pure source of N2O, making the process more feasible for practical implementation.

The literature does not provide a direct comparison of N2O as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) with other oxidants in terms of propylene selectivity. However, it does state that N2O is more selective than molecular oxygen in other oxidation reactions. The literature discusses the use of nickel molybdate catalysts in the ODHP process and the effects of adding N2O as a gas dope on the catalytic performance. The addition of N2O modifies the catalytic performances, with a decrease in propane conversion, an increase in propylene yield and selectivity, and a decrease in oxygen consumption and CO2 yield at low concentrations of N2O. At higher concentrations of N2O, the selectivity in propylene decreases, and carbonaceous products are formed. The literature does not address the critical challenges associated with catalyst deactivation and stability in the N2O-ODHP process. However, it does suggest that adjusting the concentration of promoters like N2O could be a useful tool to modulate the oxidation state of oxide catalysts and improve their catalytic performances.

The use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) has gained significant attention as an alternative to dioxygen. The primary advantage of N2O is its ability to produce propylene with higher selectivity compared to dioxygen, which tends to over-oxidize propane, leading to the formation of carbon oxides (CO and CO2) and lower olefin yields. Iron-zeolites, particularly Fe-ZSM-5, have been developed as unique catalysts for this process, with Fe-ZSM-5 exhibiting superior performance for ODHP with N2O after severe calcination. However, catalyst deactivation remains a critical challenge in the ODHP process, regardless of the oxidant used. The presence of propane as a reductant complicates the conversion of nitrous oxide on iron-zeolites, and the deactivation mechanism of catalysts in ODHP with N2O is not fully understood. Strategies to address these limitations could include further research into the deactivation mechanisms, development of more stable catalysts, and optimization of reaction conditions to minimize coke formation and maximize catalyst lifetime. These efforts could potentially make N2O-ODHP a more feasible option for practical implementation.

The use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) has the advantage of increasing propylene selectivity compared to other oxidants. This is because N2O decomposition is less favorable than O2 activation, leading to a decrease in the steady-state concentration of active sites and an increase in propene selectivity. The efficiency of isolated VOx species for selective ODHP is superimposed by non-selective oxidation over the naked surface of the acidic support, which is not covered by active vanadia. To achieve high performance in ODHP, it is desirable to design catalytic surfaces that are fully covered by well-dispersed vanadia species to avoid the strong adsorption of propene on the support surface. The steady-state concentration of active lattice oxygen, which takes part in propane and propene activation, should be optimized to control selective oxidation and combustion reactions. Using N2O instead of O2 can achieve this optimization.

Nitrous oxide (N2O) has been found to be advantageous as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) due to its ability to achieve higher propene selectivity compared to molecular oxygen (O2) at similar degrees of propane conversion. This is attributed to the weaker oxidizing potential of N2O, which inhibits the direct oxidation of propane and the consecutive oxidation of propene to carbon oxides (COx). The use of N2O as an oxidant results in a lower catalytic activity due to its weaker ability to re-oxidize the reduced surface vanadium oxide (VOx) species. However, there is no significant difference in propene selectivity between highly dispersed surface VOx species and crystalline V2O5 nanoparticles when N2O is used as an oxidant. In contrast, crystalline V2O5 nanoparticles are not selective for the ODHP reaction in the presence of O2. The positive effect of N2O on propene selectivity is related to the reduction in surface density (spatial separation) of active surface lattice oxygen in VOx species, as N2O is a weaker oxidant for re-oxidation of reduced VOx species compared to O2. From a stoichiometric point of view, selective propene formation is favored over combustion reactions at lower surface densities.

Nitrous oxide (N2O) has been shown to increase propylene selectivity in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) compared to other oxidants like oxygen (O2). This improvement is attributed to the lower ability of N2O to re-oxidize reduced vanadium oxide (VOx) species, leading to a higher degree of catalyst reduction. The use of N2O can result in up to three times higher propylene selectivity compared to O2, especially when the catalyst contains bulk-like V2O5 species. N2O reduces the tendency for direct propane combustion and consecutive propene oxidation to COx, leading to improved initial propene selectivity. The nature of oxygen species originating from O2 and N2O also plays a role in the selectivity and activity of the catalyst.

Nitrous oxide (N2O) has been shown to increase propene selectivity in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) over alumina- and silica-supported vanadia catalysts compared to O2. However, the ODP activity with N2O is lower than with O2. The degree of reduction of VOx species is suggested to be important for achieving high propene selectivity. The nature of oxygen species, whether adsorbed (nonlattice) or lattice, also influences COx formation. Adsorbed oxygen species are considered nonselective for the ODP reaction over certain catalysts. The redox dynamics of VOx species have been studied using in-situ UV/vis analysis, and the catalytic performance of different VOx/SiO2, VOx/MCM-41, and VOx/MCM-48 materials in the ODP reaction has been characterized. Nitrous oxide (N2O) has been found to be advantageous as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) compared to other oxidants like oxygen (O2). This is due to its ability to achieve higher propylene selectivity. The study of VOx/MCM-41, VOx/SiO2, and VOx/MCM-48 materials has shown that N2O can lead to a higher degree of reduction of vanadium species, which is essential for achieving high primary propylene selectivity and suppressing consecutive propylene oxidation to CO and CO2. The higher polymerized VOx species have a higher activity for consecutive propene oxidation, and the importance of direct propane oxidation and consecutive propene oxidation to COx is significantly higher in the presence of O2 than in N2O. The catalytic performance is determined by the oxidant activation, and N2O's lower oxidizing ability tunes the degree of reduction of vanadium species, leading to a higher reduction degree of VOx species. This effect is related to the spatial separation of active lattice oxygen species, reducing the surface density of active oxygen species. However, the degree of reduction of VOx species is not the only reason for the superior performance of N2O compared to O2. The nature of oxygen species also influences COx formation, with adsorbed (nonlattice) oxygen species being nonselective for the ODP reaction over certain catalytic materials. In contrast, N2O decomposition over reducible metal oxides yields mononuclear oxygen species, which are considered selective. The critical challenges associated with catalyst deactivation and stability in N2O-ODHP include the need for a high degree of reduction of vanadium species and the prevention of nonselective oxygen species formation. Strategies to address these limitations could involve the development of catalysts with controlled surface density of active oxygen species and the optimization of reaction conditions to favor selective oxygen species formation. Research directions could focus on understanding the mechanisms of oxygen species formation and their role in the selectivity of the ODHP process, as well as the development of new catalyst formulations that can maintain high activity and selectivity under N2O-ODHP conditions. Nitrous oxide (N2O) has been shown to have advantages over other oxidants in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP), particularly in terms of propylene selectivity. The use of N2O as an oxidant results in higher propylene selectivity compared to oxygen (O2) over a broad range of propane conversions. This effect is more pronounced for catalysts with microcrystalline V2O5. The improved selectivity is attributed to the ability of N2O to achieve a higher primary propene selectivity and to lower the activity for consecutive propene oxidation. N2O reoxidizes reduced VOx species slower than O2, which is essential for suppressing nonselective consecutive propene oxidation to COx. The nature of oxygen species also plays a role, with N2O not producing nonselective adsorbed oxygen species that can catalyze nonselective consecutive propene oxidation to COx. A variety of catalysts have been employed in the ODHP process, including VOx/SiO2, VOx/MCM-41, and VOx/MCM-48. These catalysts have been characterized using various techniques such as transmission electron microscopy (TEM), temperature-programmed reduction (TPR), UV/vis, Raman, and X-ray diffraction (XRD). The specific surface area of the catalysts decreases with vanadium loading, and the degree of polymerization of VOx species is influenced by the support material. The catalytic activity of the VOx(2.7)/MCM-41 catalyst is slightly higher than that of the VOx(2.8)/SiO2 and VOx(3.4)/MCM-48 samples, possibly due to a lower degree of polymerization of VOx species. The lowest activity was observed over the VOx(11.2)/MCM-41 sample, which possesses microcrystalline V2O5. Catalyst deactivation and stability are critical challenges in the ODHP process. The use of N2O as an oxidant can help mitigate these issues by reducing the formation of nonselective adsorbed oxygen species that can lead to catalyst deactivation. However, the lower activity of N2O compared to O2 can also be a limitation. Strategies to address these challenges include optimizing the catalyst structure and composition to enhance stability and selectivity, developing methods to regenerate deactivated catalysts, and exploring alternative oxidants that can provide high selectivity and activity while maintaining catalyst stability.

Nitrous oxide (N2O) has been used as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) to increase the selectivity to propylene compared to other oxidants. The catalysts employed in this process include a mixture of NiMoO4 and -Sb2O4, and a palladium supported on a mixed Zr-Ce-O oxide catalyst. The addition of N2O in the feed leads to a significant increase in the selectivity to propylene, while the conversion of propane and oxygen and the yield in CO2 decrease. N2O promotes the reduction of molybdenum, which is beneficial for the selectivity of the catalyst. However, the conversion of propane and the yield of CO2 decrease, which may limit the practical application of N2O-ODHP. The challenge of catalyst deactivation and stability is also a critical issue that needs to be addressed. Strategies to improve the stability of the catalysts and reduce the deactivation rate could potentially make N2O-ODHP a more feasible option for practical implementation. For example, the use of more stable catalysts or the development of new catalysts with higher activity and selectivity could be explored. Additionally, the optimization of the reaction conditions, such as temperature, pressure, and feed composition, could also help to improve the stability of the catalysts and reduce the deactivation rate.

Nitrous oxide (N2O) is an efficient oxidant for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) over steam-activated Fe-zeolites (MFI and BEA), achieving initial propylene yields up to 25% at 723 K. However, catalyst deactivation occurs due to coke formation.
          A tapered element oscillating microbalance (TEOM) coupled to GC analysis has been applied to correlate activity and deactivation by simultaneous measurements of reaction and coking.
          Extraframework iron species, generated during steam treatment, are essential for producing active catalysts.
          The nature and distribution of extraframework iron species, the zeolite host, and the catalyst acidity have no significant effect on the initial propene yield, but strongly influence the deactivation behavior.
          FeZSM-5 shows a remarkable resistance against deactivation, while a very rapid and complete deactivation occurred in FeBEA.
          The initial propene yield over FeZSM-5 and FeBEA was remarkably higher than over commercial H-ZSM-5 and H-BEA (with 3040 times lower iron content), although the residual activities after 400 min on stream were very similar.
          Remarkable yields toward propionaldehyde (up to 6%) have been obtained.
          A major drawback of FeMFI zeolites in ODHP with N2O is the deactivation by coke, causing a rapid decrease of the propene yield.
          The TEOM consists of a microreactor with a high-resolution microbalance that generates real-time measurements of mass changes during gas-solid reactions.
          The TEOM presents three main advantages over conventional gravimetric microbalances: a well-defined flow pattern, a very fast response time resolution (0.1 s), and a high mass resolution across the entire range of pressure and temperature.
          Steam activation is essential for achieving high catalytic activities, as concluded from the low conversion of reactants and propene yield obtained over the calcined iron zeolites.
          Extraframework iron species, generated during steam treatment, are responsible for the oxydehydrogenation of propane with nitrous oxide.
          The difference in initial C3H6 yield between ex-FeZSM-5 and ex-Fe-silicalite is marginal if their constitution with respect to iron is taken into account.
          The initial activity of the synthesized Fe-zeolites is significantly higher than over the commercial zeolites, while the former catalysts contain 30 40 times more iron.
          The rapid deactivation observed in ex-FeBEA and ex-H-BEA can be connected to the presence of large cavities with relatively small apertures in the BEA framework, especially at the intersection of the channels.
          The rate of deactivation over the MFI catalysts is significantly lower, and can be related to the absence of large cages in this zeolitic structure, since channels and intersections are of similar size.
          The higher deactivation resistance of steam-activated ex-FeZSM-5 in ODHP with N2O is unclear, but can be tentatively related to the different iron constitutions in both catalysts and/or the different porous structure associated with the presence of aluminum in the original zeolite framework.
          Ex-FeZSM-5 contains mesopores due to dealumination upon steam treatment, which are absent in ex-Fe-silicalite.
          The more open structure of FeZSM-5 may reduce pore blocking by coke and also improve transport of reactants and products, slowing down deactivation.
          The activity of ex-FeZSM-5 in direct N2O decomposition is significantly higher than that of ex-Fe-silicalite.
          N2O activation generates atomic oxygen over certain iron species, which is efficiently utilized for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane.
          However, recombination of atomic oxygen and desorption as O2 may lead to reaction with coke at specific locations of the zeolite at the operating temperature, resulting in COx.
          This function would partially regenerate the catalyst surface.
          This hypothesis would imply that highly active Fe-zeolite catalysts in direct N2O decomposition have an increased resistance toward coke deactivation in ODHP with N2O.

Nitrous oxide (N2O) is used as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) due to its ability to achieve higher propene selectivity compared to other oxidants, despite lower propane conversion. This is attributed to the fact that N2O reoxidizes the reduced vanadium species without forming peroxovanadates, which are highly reactive and can lead to the formation of carbon oxides. The use of N2O as an oxidant results in a slower reoxidation process, which allows for a higher selectivity towards propene. However, the catalyst deactivation is a critical challenge in this process, as it is mainly caused by the reduction of vanadium species rather than the formation of carbonaceous deposits. The regeneration of the catalyst by heating under N2O at high temperatures can partly restore its activity, but complete restoration requires reoxidation in the presence of oxygen. To address these limitations and make N2O-ODHP a more feasible option for practical implementation, research directions could focus on developing more stable catalysts that can maintain their activity over longer periods, optimizing the reaction conditions to minimize vanadium reduction, and exploring alternative regeneration methods that can effectively restore the catalyst's activity without the need for high-temperature treatments.

Nitrous oxide (N2O) can improve the selectivity of the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) process by inhibiting the adsorption of O2 and/or increasing the reduction rate of the catalysts. The oxygen produced by the dissociation of N2O can oxidize propane to propene. In the presence of N2O, catalytic sites work in a more reduced state. N2O has been used as a pure oxidant in various reactions, including the oxidative coupling of methane to ethane, the transformation of benzene to phenol, and the oxidation of ethylene to epoxide. The use of N2O in ODHP can potentially lead to higher propylene selectivity compared to other oxidants by controlling the oxidation state of the catalyst and limiting the formation of non-selective oxygen species. Adjusting the concentration of N2O could be a useful strategy to modulate selectivity during the catalytic reaction.

Nitrous oxide (N2O) has been shown to significantly improve propene selectivity in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) compared to molecular oxygen (O2) when used as an oxidant. This improvement has been observed over various catalysts, including steam-activated iron-containing zeolites, bulk vanadium oxides, and supported vanadium-containing materials. A similar effect of N2O has also been reported for the oxidative dehydrogenation of n-butane over vanadium magnesium oxide catalysts. The positive effect of N2O on the ODHP reaction is attributed to the slower reoxidation of reduced VOx species compared to O2, resulting in a lower steady-state concentration of active lattice oxygen sites and thus suppressing the consecutive oxidation of propene to carbon oxides. However, the activity of VOx sites for consecutive propene oxidation increases with rising agglomerization degree. Propene selectivities do not differ much as long as the vanadium surface concentration remains below monolayer coverage, with only isolated VOx sites and small two-dimensional VxOy clusters present. When V2O5 nanocrystallites dominate, there is a dramatic drop in propene selectivity and direct total oxidation of propane occurs with both oxidants, although this detrimental effect is less pronounced in the presence of N2O. A recent study suggested that compared to N2O, other oxygen species (non-lattice oxygen of VOx species) are formed from gas-phase O2 and participate in COx formation. However, there is limited experimental information on the nature of active oxygen species formed from O2 and N2O upon reoxidation of reduced VOx species. The aim of this study is to obtain experimental evidence on the nature and structure of oxygen species formed upon reoxidation of reduced highly dispersed VOx species supported over MCM-41 with O2 and N2O. The same VOx/MCM-41 catalyst used in this work has previously been thoroughly characterized and tested in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane. A turnover frequency of propane conversion of 0.016 molC3H8 mol1 V s1 has been measured with O2 used as an oxidizing agent. In comparison, the respective value with N2O was only half as high, while the propene selectivity was higher, amounting to 80% with N2O but only to 50% with O2 at propane conversion of approximately 10%. Since several of the previously postulated oxygen species were paramagnetic, EPR spectroscopy under controlled atmosphere conditions was applied to experimentally identify oxygen species formed from gaseous N2O and O2 over VOx/MCM-41 and to explore the reactivity of these species towards oxidation of C3H8, C3H6, and CO.

Nitrous oxide (N2O) has been shown to be a superior oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) compared to other oxidants like oxygen (O2). Steam-activated iron zeolites (Fe-zeolites) have demonstrated high initial propene yields of 24% at temperatures between 773 and 798 K, which are comparable to the highest yields reported over vanadium (V) and molybdenum (Mo)-based catalysts using O2. The essential role of N2O in this process is highlighted by the fact that propene production does not occur when propane interacts with iron zeolites in the absence of N2O. The remarkable performance of Fe-zeolites is attributed to the specificity of N2O as a monooxygen donor and the capability of iron forms in the zeolite to coordinate reactive atomic oxygen species for efficient propane dehydrogenation. However, a major drawback is the deactivation by coke, causing a rapid decrease in propene yield. The rate of deactivation varies among the zeolites studied, with Fe-beta deactivating the fastest, followed by Fe-silicalite and FeZSM-5. The deactivation behavior of FeZSM-5 suggests the presence of active iron sites with different sensitivity for coke deactivation. Catalyst deactivation is a complex process that can be caused by a decrease in the number of active sites, a decrease in the quality of active sites, or a decrease in accessibility of the pore space.

N2O is a mono-oxygen donor that can efficiently dehydrogenate propane due to the ability of certain iron species to coordinate reactive atomic oxygen species. This specificity of N2O contributes to the remarkable performance of iron zeolites in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP). However, a major drawback of iron zeolites in ODHP with N2O is the deactivation by coke, which leads to a rapid decrease in propylene yield. The tapered element oscillating microbalance (TEOM) technique coupled with gas chromatography (GC) analysis has been used to correlate deactivation and mass changes due to coking. While TEOM provides detailed and accurate in situ investigation of coke formation, it does not provide information on the deactivation mechanism at the catalyst surface level. To gain a better understanding of the deactivation of iron-containing zeolites in the C3H8 + N2O reaction and the subsequent regeneration in air, complementary spectroscopic studies under reaction conditions are needed. In situ FTIR spectroscopy is suitable for assessing coke deactivation of zeolite catalysts in hydrocarbon conversion by monitoring the formation of carbonaceous deposits and changes in vibrations associated with the surface acidity and framework of the microporous material. Observing the evolution of the working catalyst under true process conditions is useful for an improved understanding of the ODHP reaction. However, in situ investigations of selective oxidation of hydrocarbons with N2O over iron-containing zeolites have not been reported. Moreover, the reusability of the regenerated catalysts has not yet been addressed in detail. Infrared results were complemented by TEOMGC experiments over the catalysts at the same conditions. The degree of catalyst reversibility on reaction and regeneration is evaluated and discussed on the basis of these analyses and characterization of the fresh, coked, and regenerated samples by X-ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and nitrogen adsorption.

Nitrous oxide (N2O) has been identified as a promising oxidant for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) to produce propylene, a key petrochemical feedstock. Compared to traditional oxidants like oxygen, N2O allows for the production of propylene at lower temperatures, which can improve the efficiency and selectivity of the process. The use of N2O as an oxidant in ODHP has been shown to achieve remarkable propylene yields, particularly when iron zeolites are used as catalysts. These catalysts have been found to be effective at lower temperatures than those required for mixed metal oxide catalysts, which typically operate at higher temperatures. However, the performance of iron zeolites can vary significantly depending on the method of iron incorporation and the preparation technique. Steam activation of iron-substituted ZSM-5 zeolites has been shown to result in superior propylene yields compared to other preparation methods. Iron impurities in steamed commercial H-ZSM-5 zeolites have also been found to induce high propylene selectivity, leading to low COx formation. A major challenge in the use of N2O for ODHP is the deactivation of iron zeolite catalysts due to coke formation, which can limit the stability and lifetime of the catalyst. Strategies to address this limitation could include the development of more stable catalyst formulations, optimization of reaction conditions to minimize coke formation, and the use of in situ regeneration techniques to maintain catalyst activity. Research directions that could potentially make N2O-ODHP a more feasible option for practical implementation include the exploration of alternative iron sources and incorporation methods, the design of catalysts with enhanced resistance to deactivation, and the development of integrated process designs that incorporate catalyst regeneration steps.

The use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) presents several advantages, particularly in terms of propylene selectivity compared to other oxidants. N2O, being a strong greenhouse gas, can be effectively utilized in this process, potentially offering environmental benefits. The substitution of N2O for oxygen leads to a significant increase in propylene selectivity across various catalysts, including iron-containing zeolites and vanadium-based catalysts. Iron-based materials, such as Fe-ZSM-5, have been identified as particularly effective in yielding high propylene (C3H6) in ODHP using N2O. Other redox metal catalysts, such as vanadium and molybdenum, have also been explored for this purpose. However, a critical challenge associated with the use of N2O in ODHP is the rapid deactivation of catalysts, primarily due to coke formation. This issue significantly limits the feasibility of N2O as an oxidant compared to softer oxidants like CO2. The quick deactivation of catalysts under N2O conditions necessitates further research to improve catalyst stability and to gain a clearer understanding of the deactivation mechanisms. Addressing these limitations could potentially make N2O-ODHP a more viable option for practical implementation. Strategies to overcome these limitations might include the development of more stable catalyst formulations, the optimization of reaction conditions to minimize coke formation, and the engineering of catalysts with enhanced resistance to deactivation. Additionally, in-depth studies to elucidate the precise mechanisms of deactivation could guide the design of more robust catalysts for N2O-ODHP processes.

Nitrous oxide (N2O) has been shown to modify the catalytic performances of the same catalyst in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODP) reaction. Principally, it decreases the conversion of propane and oxygen, increases the yield and selectivity to propylene, and decreases the yield and selectivity to CO2. In the presence of N2O, catalytic sites work in a more reduced state, leading to a more selective reaction. When the amount of N2O is higher than 300 ppm, oxygen species coming from N2O dissociation could also play a role, suggesting that N2O is also able to induce the ODP, although less oxidant than O2. However, the use of pure N2O to perform the ODP is not advisable as molecular oxygen is necessary to oxidize and regenerate the catalysts in the presence of N2O, otherwise the catalyst deactivates quickly. N2O reduces the catalysts (molybdenum), explaining the high carbon formation. It is the presence of both O2 and N2O (as promoter) that can fully explain the better selectivity of the catalysts in ODP, due to the modulation of their adequate oxidation state during the reaction.

The use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) has several advantages in terms of propylene selectivity compared to other oxidants. N2O's lower ability for catalyst reoxidation leads to an increase in the degree of catalyst reduction, which spatially separates active lattice oxygen in surface VOx species. This separation favors selective oxidation over the formation of COx. Propylene selectivity over V/g-Al2O3 materials can be improved by fully covering the support with well-dispersed VOx species. The selectivity can be further tuned by using N2O as an alternative oxidizing agent. The lower activity of N2O is due to its reduced ability to reoxidize reduced VOx sites, which enhances propene selectivity. This effect is attributed to the less favorable reoxidation of the catalyst by N2O compared to O2. The decrease in the steady-state concentration of active surface lattice oxygen of VOx species favors selective propane oxidation to propene over COx formation, as only one to two lattice oxygen are necessary for the former reaction. Active sites with more than two lattice oxygen species favor the formation of waste products like CO and CO2. The effect of the oxidizing agent on the catalytic performance is also related to the nature of oxygen species originating from O2 and N2O. It has been suggested that atomic oxygen species are responsible for selective oxidation, while polyatomic oxygen species take part in COx formation. However, direct experimental evidence is not available at this stage.

N2O is a highly efficient oxidant for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) over steam-activated FeZSM-5, achieving propene yields up to 25% at 723 K. The remarkable performance of iron zeolites in ODHP is attributed to the specificity of N2O as a monooxygen donor and the capability of iron forms in the zeolite to coordinate reactive atomic oxygen species for efficient dehydrogenation of propane. However, a major drawback is the deactivation by coke formation, leading to a rapid decrease in propene yield. The rate of deactivation is reduced with an increase in temperature, and the relatively slow deactivation of FeZSM-5 at 773 K is associated with high N2O conversion. The use of O2 as an oxidant in ODHP over FeZSM-5 leads to very low C3H6 yields (<5%) compared to N2O. The addition of small amounts of O2 to the C3H8+N2O mixture results in a decrease in C3H6 selectivity and an increase in COx production. The intermediates essential for propene production are negatively impacted by the presence of O2, severely deteriorating the performance of FeZSM-5 in N2O-mediated ODHP of propane. Strategies to address the limitations of catalyst deactivation and stability in N2O-ODHP include optimizing the reaction temperature to reduce deactivation rates, developing catalysts with improved resistance to coke formation, and exploring methods to regenerate the catalysts more efficiently. Research directions could focus on understanding the mechanisms of coke formation and identifying catalysts with active sites that are less susceptible to deactivation. Additionally, the development of cheap and selective catalyst systems for the low-temperature NH3 oxidation to N2O could provide a low-cost and reasonably pure source of N2O, making the process more feasible for practical implementation.

The literature does not provide a direct comparison of N2O as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) with other oxidants in terms of propylene selectivity. However, it does state that N2O is more selective than molecular oxygen in other oxidation reactions. The literature discusses the use of nickel molybdate catalysts in the ODHP process and the effects of adding N2O as a gas dope on the catalytic performance. The addition of N2O modifies the catalytic performances, with a decrease in propane conversion, an increase in propylene yield and selectivity, and a decrease in oxygen consumption and CO2 yield at low concentrations of N2O. At higher concentrations of N2O, the selectivity in propylene decreases, and carbonaceous products are formed. The literature does not address the critical challenges associated with catalyst deactivation and stability in the N2O-ODHP process. However, it does suggest that adjusting the concentration of promoters like N2O could be a useful tool to modulate the oxidation state of oxide catalysts and improve their catalytic performances.

The use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) has gained significant attention as an alternative to dioxygen. The primary advantage of N2O is its ability to produce propylene with higher selectivity compared to dioxygen, which tends to over-oxidize propane, leading to the formation of carbon oxides (CO and CO2) and lower olefin yields. Iron-zeolites, particularly Fe-ZSM-5, have been developed as unique catalysts for this process, with Fe-ZSM-5 exhibiting superior performance for ODHP with N2O after severe calcination. However, catalyst deactivation remains a critical challenge in the ODHP process, regardless of the oxidant used. The presence of propane as a reductant complicates the conversion of nitrous oxide on iron-zeolites, and the deactivation mechanism of catalysts in ODHP with N2O is not fully understood. Strategies to address these limitations could include further research into the deactivation mechanisms, development of more stable catalysts, and optimization of reaction conditions to minimize coke formation and maximize catalyst lifetime. These efforts could potentially make N2O-ODHP a more feasible option for practical implementation.

The use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) has the advantage of increasing propylene selectivity compared to other oxidants. This is because N2O decomposition is less favorable than O2 activation, leading to a decrease in the steady-state concentration of active sites and an increase in propene selectivity. The efficiency of isolated VOx species for selective ODHP is superimposed by non-selective oxidation over the naked surface of the acidic support, which is not covered by active vanadia. To achieve high performance in ODHP, it is desirable to design catalytic surfaces that are fully covered by well-dispersed vanadia species to avoid the strong adsorption of propene on the support surface. The steady-state concentration of active lattice oxygen, which takes part in propane and propene activation, should be optimized to control selective oxidation and combustion reactions. Using N2O instead of O2 can achieve this optimization.

Nitrous oxide (N2O) has been found to be advantageous as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) due to its ability to achieve higher propene selectivity compared to molecular oxygen (O2) at similar degrees of propane conversion. This is attributed to the weaker oxidizing potential of N2O, which inhibits the direct oxidation of propane and the consecutive oxidation of propene to carbon oxides (COx). The use of N2O as an oxidant results in a lower catalytic activity due to its weaker ability to re-oxidize the reduced surface vanadium oxide (VOx) species. However, there is no significant difference in propene selectivity between highly dispersed surface VOx species and crystalline V2O5 nanoparticles when N2O is used as an oxidant. In contrast, crystalline V2O5 nanoparticles are not selective for the ODHP reaction in the presence of O2. The positive effect of N2O on propene selectivity is related to the reduction in surface density (spatial separation) of active surface lattice oxygen in VOx species, as N2O is a weaker oxidant for re-oxidation of reduced VOx species compared to O2. From a stoichiometric point of view, selective propene formation is favored over combustion reactions at lower surface densities.

Nitrous oxide (N2O) has been shown to increase propylene selectivity in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) compared to other oxidants like oxygen (O2). This improvement is attributed to the lower ability of N2O to re-oxidize reduced vanadium oxide (VOx) species, leading to a higher degree of catalyst reduction. The use of N2O can result in up to three times higher propylene selectivity compared to O2, especially when the catalyst contains bulk-like V2O5 species. N2O reduces the tendency for direct propane combustion and consecutive propene oxidation to COx, leading to improved initial propene selectivity. The nature of oxygen species originating from O2 and N2O also plays a role in the selectivity and activity of the catalyst.

Nitrous oxide (N2O) has been shown to increase propene selectivity in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) over alumina- and silica-supported vanadia catalysts compared to O2. However, the ODP activity with N2O is lower than with O2. The degree of reduction of VOx species is suggested to be important for achieving high propene selectivity. The nature of oxygen species, whether adsorbed (nonlattice) or lattice, also influences COx formation. Adsorbed oxygen species are considered nonselective for the ODP reaction over certain catalysts. The redox dynamics of VOx species have been studied using in-situ UV/vis analysis, and the catalytic performance of different VOx/SiO2, VOx/MCM-41, and VOx/MCM-48 materials in the ODP reaction has been characterized. Nitrous oxide (N2O) has been found to be advantageous as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) compared to other oxidants like oxygen (O2). This is due to its ability to achieve higher propylene selectivity. The study of VOx/MCM-41, VOx/SiO2, and VOx/MCM-48 materials has shown that N2O can lead to a higher degree of reduction of vanadium species, which is essential for achieving high primary propylene selectivity and suppressing consecutive propylene oxidation to CO and CO2. The higher polymerized VOx species have a higher activity for consecutive propene oxidation, and the importance of direct propane oxidation and consecutive propene oxidation to COx is significantly higher in the presence of O2 than in N2O. The catalytic performance is determined by the oxidant activation, and N2O's lower oxidizing ability tunes the degree of reduction of vanadium species, leading to a higher reduction degree of VOx species. This effect is related to the spatial separation of active lattice oxygen species, reducing the surface density of active oxygen species. However, the degree of reduction of VOx species is not the only reason for the superior performance of N2O compared to O2. The nature of oxygen species also influences COx formation, with adsorbed (nonlattice) oxygen species being nonselective for the ODP reaction over certain catalytic materials. In contrast, N2O decomposition over reducible metal oxides yields mononuclear oxygen species, which are considered selective. The critical challenges associated with catalyst deactivation and stability in N2O-ODHP include the need for a high degree of reduction of vanadium species and the prevention of nonselective oxygen species formation. Strategies to address these limitations could involve the development of catalysts with controlled surface density of active oxygen species and the optimization of reaction conditions to favor selective oxygen species formation. Research directions could focus on understanding the mechanisms of oxygen species formation and their role in the selectivity of the ODHP process, as well as the development of new catalyst formulations that can maintain high activity and selectivity under N2O-ODHP conditions. Nitrous oxide (N2O) has been shown to have advantages over other oxidants in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP), particularly in terms of propylene selectivity. The use of N2O as an oxidant results in higher propylene selectivity compared to oxygen (O2) over a broad range of propane conversions. This effect is more pronounced for catalysts with microcrystalline V2O5. The improved selectivity is attributed to the ability of N2O to achieve a higher primary propene selectivity and to lower the activity for consecutive propene oxidation. N2O reoxidizes reduced VOx species slower than O2, which is essential for suppressing nonselective consecutive propene oxidation to COx. The nature of oxygen species also plays a role, with N2O not producing nonselective adsorbed oxygen species that can catalyze nonselective consecutive propene oxidation to COx. A variety of catalysts have been employed in the ODHP process, including VOx/SiO2, VOx/MCM-41, and VOx/MCM-48. These catalysts have been characterized using various techniques such as transmission electron microscopy (TEM), temperature-programmed reduction (TPR), UV/vis, Raman, and X-ray diffraction (XRD). The specific surface area of the catalysts decreases with vanadium loading, and the degree of polymerization of VOx species is influenced by the support material. The catalytic activity of the VOx(2.7)/MCM-41 catalyst is slightly higher than that of the VOx(2.8)/SiO2 and VOx(3.4)/MCM-48 samples, possibly due to a lower degree of polymerization of VOx species. The lowest activity was observed over the VOx(11.2)/MCM-41 sample, which possesses microcrystalline V2O5. Catalyst deactivation and stability are critical challenges in the ODHP process. The use of N2O as an oxidant can help mitigate these issues by reducing the formation of nonselective adsorbed oxygen species that can lead to catalyst deactivation. However, the lower activity of N2O compared to O2 can also be a limitation. Strategies to address these challenges include optimizing the catalyst structure and composition to enhance stability and selectivity, developing methods to regenerate deactivated catalysts, and exploring alternative oxidants that can provide high selectivity and activity while maintaining catalyst stability.

Nitrous oxide (N2O) has been used as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) to increase the selectivity to propylene compared to other oxidants. The catalysts employed in this process include a mixture of NiMoO4 and -Sb2O4, and a palladium supported on a mixed Zr-Ce-O oxide catalyst. The addition of N2O in the feed leads to a significant increase in the selectivity to propylene, while the conversion of propane and oxygen and the yield in CO2 decrease. N2O promotes the reduction of molybdenum, which is beneficial for the selectivity of the catalyst. However, the conversion of propane and the yield of CO2 decrease, which may limit the practical application of N2O-ODHP. The challenge of catalyst deactivation and stability is also a critical issue that needs to be addressed. Strategies to improve the stability of the catalysts and reduce the deactivation rate could potentially make N2O-ODHP a more feasible option for practical implementation. For example, the use of more stable catalysts or the development of new catalysts with higher activity and selectivity could be explored. Additionally, the optimization of the reaction conditions, such as temperature, pressure, and feed composition, could also help to improve the stability of the catalysts and reduce the deactivation rate.

Nitrous oxide (N2O) is an efficient oxidant for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) over steam-activated Fe-zeolites (MFI and BEA), achieving initial propylene yields up to 25% at 723 K. However, catalyst deactivation occurs due to coke formation.
          A tapered element oscillating microbalance (TEOM) coupled to GC analysis has been applied to correlate activity and deactivation by simultaneous measurements of reaction and coking.
          Extraframework iron species, generated during steam treatment, are essential for producing active catalysts.
          The nature and distribution of extraframework iron species, the zeolite host, and the catalyst acidity have no significant effect on the initial propene yield, but strongly influence the deactivation behavior.
          FeZSM-5 shows a remarkable resistance against deactivation, while a very rapid and complete deactivation occurred in FeBEA.
          The initial propene yield over FeZSM-5 and FeBEA was remarkably higher than over commercial H-ZSM-5 and H-BEA (with 3040 times lower iron content), although the residual activities after 400 min on stream were very similar.
          Remarkable yields toward propionaldehyde (up to 6%) have been obtained.
          A major drawback of FeMFI zeolites in ODHP with N2O is the deactivation by coke, causing a rapid decrease of the propene yield.
          The TEOM consists of a microreactor with a high-resolution microbalance that generates real-time measurements of mass changes during gas-solid reactions.
          The TEOM presents three main advantages over conventional gravimetric microbalances: a well-defined flow pattern, a very fast response time resolution (0.1 s), and a high mass resolution across the entire range of pressure and temperature.
          Steam activation is essential for achieving high catalytic activities, as concluded from the low conversion of reactants and propene yield obtained over the calcined iron zeolites.
          Extraframework iron species, generated during steam treatment, are responsible for the oxydehydrogenation of propane with nitrous oxide.
          The difference in initial C3H6 yield between ex-FeZSM-5 and ex-Fe-silicalite is marginal if their constitution with respect to iron is taken into account.
          The initial activity of the synthesized Fe-zeolites is significantly higher than over the commercial zeolites, while the former catalysts contain 30 40 times more iron.
          The rapid deactivation observed in ex-FeBEA and ex-H-BEA can be connected to the presence of large cavities with relatively small apertures in the BEA framework, especially at the intersection of the channels.
          The rate of deactivation over the MFI catalysts is significantly lower, and can be related to the absence of large cages in this zeolitic structure, since channels and intersections are of similar size.
          The higher deactivation resistance of steam-activated ex-FeZSM-5 in ODHP with N2O is unclear, but can be tentatively related to the different iron constitutions in both catalysts and/or the different porous structure associated with the presence of aluminum in the original zeolite framework.
          Ex-FeZSM-5 contains mesopores due to dealumination upon steam treatment, which are absent in ex-Fe-silicalite.
          The more open structure of FeZSM-5 may reduce pore blocking by coke and also improve transport of reactants and products, slowing down deactivation.
          The activity of ex-FeZSM-5 in direct N2O decomposition is significantly higher than that of ex-Fe-silicalite.
          N2O activation generates atomic oxygen over certain iron species, which is efficiently utilized for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane.
          However, recombination of atomic oxygen and desorption as O2 may lead to reaction with coke at specific locations of the zeolite at the operating temperature, resulting in COx.
          This function would partially regenerate the catalyst surface.
          This hypothesis would imply that highly active Fe-zeolite catalysts in direct N2O decomposition have an increased resistance toward coke deactivation in ODHP with N2O.

Nitrous oxide (N2O) is used as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) due to its ability to achieve higher propene selectivity compared to other oxidants, despite lower propane conversion. This is attributed to the fact that N2O reoxidizes the reduced vanadium species without forming peroxovanadates, which are highly reactive and can lead to the formation of carbon oxides. The use of N2O as an oxidant results in a slower reoxidation process, which allows for a higher selectivity towards propene. However, the catalyst deactivation is a critical challenge in this process, as it is mainly caused by the reduction of vanadium species rather than the formation of carbonaceous deposits. The regeneration of the catalyst by heating under N2O at high temperatures can partly restore its activity, but complete restoration requires reoxidation in the presence of oxygen. To address these limitations and make N2O-ODHP a more feasible option for practical implementation, research directions could focus on developing more stable catalysts that can maintain their activity over longer periods, optimizing the reaction conditions to minimize vanadium reduction, and exploring alternative regeneration methods that can effectively restore the catalyst's activity without the need for high-temperature treatments.

Nitrous oxide (N2O) can improve the selectivity of the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) process by inhibiting the adsorption of O2 and/or increasing the reduction rate of the catalysts. The oxygen produced by the dissociation of N2O can oxidize propane to propene. In the presence of N2O, catalytic sites work in a more reduced state. N2O has been used as a pure oxidant in various reactions, including the oxidative coupling of methane to ethane, the transformation of benzene to phenol, and the oxidation of ethylene to epoxide. The use of N2O in ODHP can potentially lead to higher propylene selectivity compared to other oxidants by controlling the oxidation state of the catalyst and limiting the formation of non-selective oxygen species. Adjusting the concentration of N2O could be a useful strategy to modulate selectivity during the catalytic reaction.

Nitrous oxide (N2O) has been shown to significantly improve propene selectivity in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) compared to molecular oxygen (O2) when used as an oxidant. This improvement has been observed over various catalysts, including steam-activated iron-containing zeolites, bulk vanadium oxides, and supported vanadium-containing materials. A similar effect of N2O has also been reported for the oxidative dehydrogenation of n-butane over vanadium magnesium oxide catalysts. The positive effect of N2O on the ODHP reaction is attributed to the slower reoxidation of reduced VOx species compared to O2, resulting in a lower steady-state concentration of active lattice oxygen sites and thus suppressing the consecutive oxidation of propene to carbon oxides. However, the activity of VOx sites for consecutive propene oxidation increases with rising agglomerization degree. Propene selectivities do not differ much as long as the vanadium surface concentration remains below monolayer coverage, with only isolated VOx sites and small two-dimensional VxOy clusters present. When V2O5 nanocrystallites dominate, there is a dramatic drop in propene selectivity and direct total oxidation of propane occurs with both oxidants, although this detrimental effect is less pronounced in the presence of N2O. A recent study suggested that compared to N2O, other oxygen species (non-lattice oxygen of VOx species) are formed from gas-phase O2 and participate in COx formation. However, there is limited experimental information on the nature of active oxygen species formed from O2 and N2O upon reoxidation of reduced VOx species. The aim of this study is to obtain experimental evidence on the nature and structure of oxygen species formed upon reoxidation of reduced highly dispersed VOx species supported over MCM-41 with O2 and N2O. The same VOx/MCM-41 catalyst used in this work has previously been thoroughly characterized and tested in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane. A turnover frequency of propane conversion of 0.016 molC3H8 mol1 V s1 has been measured with O2 used as an oxidizing agent. In comparison, the respective value with N2O was only half as high, while the propene selectivity was higher, amounting to 80% with N2O but only to 50% with O2 at propane conversion of approximately 10%. Since several of the previously postulated oxygen species were paramagnetic, EPR spectroscopy under controlled atmosphere conditions was applied to experimentally identify oxygen species formed from gaseous N2O and O2 over VOx/MCM-41 and to explore the reactivity of these species towards oxidation of C3H8, C3H6, and CO.

Nitrous oxide (N2O) has been shown to be a superior oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) compared to other oxidants like oxygen (O2). Steam-activated iron zeolites (Fe-zeolites) have demonstrated high initial propene yields of 24% at temperatures between 773 and 798 K, which are comparable to the highest yields reported over vanadium (V) and molybdenum (Mo)-based catalysts using O2. The essential role of N2O in this process is highlighted by the fact that propene production does not occur when propane interacts with iron zeolites in the absence of N2O. The remarkable performance of Fe-zeolites is attributed to the specificity of N2O as a monooxygen donor and the capability of iron forms in the zeolite to coordinate reactive atomic oxygen species for efficient propane dehydrogenation. However, a major drawback is the deactivation by coke, causing a rapid decrease in propene yield. The rate of deactivation varies among the zeolites studied, with Fe-beta deactivating the fastest, followed by Fe-silicalite and FeZSM-5. The deactivation behavior of FeZSM-5 suggests the presence of active iron sites with different sensitivity for coke deactivation. Catalyst deactivation is a complex process that can be caused by a decrease in the number of active sites, a decrease in the quality of active sites, or a decrease in accessibility of the pore space.

N2O is a mono-oxygen donor that can efficiently dehydrogenate propane due to the ability of certain iron species to coordinate reactive atomic oxygen species. This specificity of N2O contributes to the remarkable performance of iron zeolites in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP). However, a major drawback of iron zeolites in ODHP with N2O is the deactivation by coke, which leads to a rapid decrease in propylene yield. The tapered element oscillating microbalance (TEOM) technique coupled with gas chromatography (GC) analysis has been used to correlate deactivation and mass changes due to coking. While TEOM provides detailed and accurate in situ investigation of coke formation, it does not provide information on the deactivation mechanism at the catalyst surface level. To gain a better understanding of the deactivation of iron-containing zeolites in the C3H8 + N2O reaction and the subsequent regeneration in air, complementary spectroscopic studies under reaction conditions are needed. In situ FTIR spectroscopy is suitable for assessing coke deactivation of zeolite catalysts in hydrocarbon conversion by monitoring the formation of carbonaceous deposits and changes in vibrations associated with the surface acidity and framework of the microporous material. Observing the evolution of the working catalyst under true process conditions is useful for an improved understanding of the ODHP reaction. However, in situ investigations of selective oxidation of hydrocarbons with N2O over iron-containing zeolites have not been reported. Moreover, the reusability of the regenerated catalysts has not yet been addressed in detail. Infrared results were complemented by TEOMGC experiments over the catalysts at the same conditions. The degree of catalyst reversibility on reaction and regeneration is evaluated and discussed on the basis of these analyses and characterization of the fresh, coked, and regenerated samples by X-ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and nitrogen adsorption.

Nitrous oxide (N2O) has been identified as a promising oxidant for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) to produce propylene, a key petrochemical feedstock. Compared to traditional oxidants like oxygen, N2O allows for the production of propylene at lower temperatures, which can improve the efficiency and selectivity of the process. The use of N2O as an oxidant in ODHP has been shown to achieve remarkable propylene yields, particularly when iron zeolites are used as catalysts. These catalysts have been found to be effective at lower temperatures than those required for mixed metal oxide catalysts, which typically operate at higher temperatures. However, the performance of iron zeolites can vary significantly depending on the method of iron incorporation and the preparation technique. Steam activation of iron-substituted ZSM-5 zeolites has been shown to result in superior propylene yields compared to other preparation methods. Iron impurities in steamed commercial H-ZSM-5 zeolites have also been found to induce high propylene selectivity, leading to low COx formation. A major challenge in the use of N2O for ODHP is the deactivation of iron zeolite catalysts due to coke formation, which can limit the stability and lifetime of the catalyst. Strategies to address this limitation could include the development of more stable catalyst formulations, optimization of reaction conditions to minimize coke formation, and the use of in situ regeneration techniques to maintain catalyst activity. Research directions that could potentially make N2O-ODHP a more feasible option for practical implementation include the exploration of alternative iron sources and incorporation methods, the design of catalysts with enhanced resistance to deactivation, and the development of integrated process designs that incorporate catalyst regeneration steps.

The use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) presents several advantages, particularly in terms of propylene selectivity compared to other oxidants. N2O, being a strong greenhouse gas, can be effectively utilized in this process, potentially offering environmental benefits. The substitution of N2O for oxygen leads to a significant increase in propylene selectivity across various catalysts, including iron-containing zeolites and vanadium-based catalysts. Iron-based materials, such as Fe-ZSM-5, have been identified as particularly effective in yielding high propylene (C3H6) in ODHP using N2O. Other redox metal catalysts, such as vanadium and molybdenum, have also been explored for this purpose. However, a critical challenge associated with the use of N2O in ODHP is the rapid deactivation of catalysts, primarily due to coke formation. This issue significantly limits the feasibility of N2O as an oxidant compared to softer oxidants like CO2. The quick deactivation of catalysts under N2O conditions necessitates further research to improve catalyst stability and to gain a clearer understanding of the deactivation mechanisms. Addressing these limitations could potentially make N2O-ODHP a more viable option for practical implementation. Strategies to overcome these limitations might include the development of more stable catalyst formulations, the optimization of reaction conditions to minimize coke formation, and the engineering of catalysts with enhanced resistance to deactivation. Additionally, in-depth studies to elucidate the precise mechanisms of deactivation could guide the design of more robust catalysts for N2O-ODHP processes.

Nitrous oxide (N2O) has been shown to modify the catalytic performances of the same catalyst in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODP) reaction. Principally, it decreases the conversion of propane and oxygen, increases the yield and selectivity to propylene, and decreases the yield and selectivity to CO2. In the presence of N2O, catalytic sites work in a more reduced state, leading to a more selective reaction. When the amount of N2O is higher than 300 ppm, oxygen species coming from N2O dissociation could also play a role, suggesting that N2O is also able to induce the ODP, although less oxidant than O2. However, the use of pure N2O to perform the ODP is not advisable as molecular oxygen is necessary to oxidize and regenerate the catalysts in the presence of N2O, otherwise the catalyst deactivates quickly. N2O reduces the catalysts (molybdenum), explaining the high carbon formation. It is the presence of both O2 and N2O (as promoter) that can fully explain the better selectivity of the catalysts in ODP, due to the modulation of their adequate oxidation state during the reaction.

The use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) has several advantages in terms of propylene selectivity compared to other oxidants. N2O's lower ability for catalyst reoxidation leads to an increase in the degree of catalyst reduction, which spatially separates active lattice oxygen in surface VOx species. This separation favors selective oxidation over the formation of COx. Propylene selectivity over V/g-Al2O3 materials can be improved by fully covering the support with well-dispersed VOx species. The selectivity can be further tuned by using N2O as an alternative oxidizing agent. The lower activity of N2O is due to its reduced ability to reoxidize reduced VOx sites, which enhances propene selectivity. This effect is attributed to the less favorable reoxidation of the catalyst by N2O compared to O2. The decrease in the steady-state concentration of active surface lattice oxygen of VOx species favors selective propane oxidation to propene over COx formation, as only one to two lattice oxygen are necessary for the former reaction. Active sites with more than two lattice oxygen species favor the formation of waste products like CO and CO2. The effect of the oxidizing agent on the catalytic performance is also related to the nature of oxygen species originating from O2 and N2O. It has been suggested that atomic oxygen species are responsible for selective oxidation, while polyatomic oxygen species take part in COx formation. However, direct experimental evidence is not available at this stage.

N2O is a highly efficient oxidant for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) over steam-activated FeZSM-5, achieving propene yields up to 25% at 723 K. The remarkable performance of iron zeolites in ODHP is attributed to the specificity of N2O as a monooxygen donor and the capability of iron forms in the zeolite to coordinate reactive atomic oxygen species for efficient dehydrogenation of propane. However, a major drawback is the deactivation by coke formation, leading to a rapid decrease in propene yield. The rate of deactivation is reduced with an increase in temperature, and the relatively slow deactivation of FeZSM-5 at 773 K is associated with high N2O conversion. The use of O2 as an oxidant in ODHP over FeZSM-5 leads to very low C3H6 yields (<5%) compared to N2O. The addition of small amounts of O2 to the C3H8+N2O mixture results in a decrease in C3H6 selectivity and an increase in COx production. The intermediates essential for propene production are negatively impacted by the presence of O2, severely deteriorating the performance of FeZSM-5 in N2O-mediated ODHP of propane. Strategies to address the limitations of catalyst deactivation and stability in N2O-ODHP include optimizing the reaction temperature to reduce deactivation rates, developing catalysts with improved resistance to coke formation, and exploring methods to regenerate the catalysts more efficiently. Research directions could focus on understanding the mechanisms of coke formation and identifying catalysts with active sites that are less susceptible to deactivation. Additionally, the development of cheap and selective catalyst systems for the low-temperature NH3 oxidation to N2O could provide a low-cost and reasonably pure source of N2O, making the process more feasible for practical implementation.

The literature does not provide a direct comparison of N2O as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) with other oxidants in terms of propylene selectivity. However, it does state that N2O is more selective than molecular oxygen in other oxidation reactions. The literature discusses the use of nickel molybdate catalysts in the ODHP process and the effects of adding N2O as a gas dope on the catalytic performance. The addition of N2O modifies the catalytic performances, with a decrease in propane conversion, an increase in propylene yield and selectivity, and a decrease in oxygen consumption and CO2 yield at low concentrations of N2O. At higher concentrations of N2O, the selectivity in propylene decreases, and carbonaceous products are formed. The literature does not address the critical challenges associated with catalyst deactivation and stability in the N2O-ODHP process. However, it does suggest that adjusting the concentration of promoters like N2O could be a useful tool to modulate the oxidation state of oxide catalysts and improve their catalytic performances.

The use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) has gained significant attention as an alternative to dioxygen. The primary advantage of N2O is its ability to produce propylene with higher selectivity compared to dioxygen, which tends to over-oxidize propane, leading to the formation of carbon oxides (CO and CO2) and lower olefin yields. Iron-zeolites, particularly Fe-ZSM-5, have been developed as unique catalysts for this process, with Fe-ZSM-5 exhibiting superior performance for ODHP with N2O after severe calcination. However, catalyst deactivation remains a critical challenge in the ODHP process, regardless of the oxidant used. The presence of propane as a reductant complicates the conversion of nitrous oxide on iron-zeolites, and the deactivation mechanism of catalysts in ODHP with N2O is not fully understood. Strategies to address these limitations could include further research into the deactivation mechanisms, development of more stable catalysts, and optimization of reaction conditions to minimize coke formation and maximize catalyst lifetime. These efforts could potentially make N2O-ODHP a more feasible option for practical implementation.

The use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) has the advantage of increasing propylene selectivity compared to other oxidants. This is because N2O decomposition is less favorable than O2 activation, leading to a decrease in the steady-state concentration of active sites and an increase in propene selectivity. The efficiency of isolated VOx species for selective ODHP is superimposed by non-selective oxidation over the naked surface of the acidic support, which is not covered by active vanadia. To achieve high performance in ODHP, it is desirable to design catalytic surfaces that are fully covered by well-dispersed vanadia species to avoid the strong adsorption of propene on the support surface. The steady-state concentration of active lattice oxygen, which takes part in propane and propene activation, should be optimized to control selective oxidation and combustion reactions. Using N2O instead of O2 can achieve this optimization.

Nitrous oxide (N2O) has been found to be advantageous as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) due to its ability to achieve higher propene selectivity compared to molecular oxygen (O2) at similar degrees of propane conversion. This is attributed to the weaker oxidizing potential of N2O, which inhibits the direct oxidation of propane and the consecutive oxidation of propene to carbon oxides (COx). The use of N2O as an oxidant results in a lower catalytic activity due to its weaker ability to re-oxidize the reduced surface vanadium oxide (VOx) species. However, there is no significant difference in propene selectivity between highly dispersed surface VOx species and crystalline V2O5 nanoparticles when N2O is used as an oxidant. In contrast, crystalline V2O5 nanoparticles are not selective for the ODHP reaction in the presence of O2. The positive effect of N2O on propene selectivity is related to the reduction in surface density (spatial separation) of active surface lattice oxygen in VOx species, as N2O is a weaker oxidant for re-oxidation of reduced VOx species compared to O2. From a stoichiometric point of view, selective propene formation is favored over combustion reactions at lower surface densities.

Nitrous oxide (N2O) has been shown to increase propylene selectivity in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) compared to other oxidants like oxygen (O2). This improvement is attributed to the lower ability of N2O to re-oxidize reduced vanadium oxide (VOx) species, leading to a higher degree of catalyst reduction. The use of N2O can result in up to three times higher propylene selectivity compared to O2, especially when the catalyst contains bulk-like V2O5 species. N2O reduces the tendency for direct propane combustion and consecutive propene oxidation to COx, leading to improved initial propene selectivity. The nature of oxygen species originating from O2 and N2O also plays a role in the selectivity and activity of the catalyst.

Nitrous oxide (N2O) has been shown to increase propene selectivity in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) over alumina- and silica-supported vanadia catalysts compared to O2. However, the ODP activity with N2O is lower than with O2. The degree of reduction of VOx species is suggested to be important for achieving high propene selectivity. The nature of oxygen species, whether adsorbed (nonlattice) or lattice, also influences COx formation. Adsorbed oxygen species are considered nonselective for the ODP reaction over certain catalysts. The redox dynamics of VOx species have been studied using in-situ UV/vis analysis, and the catalytic performance of different VOx/SiO2, VOx/MCM-41, and VOx/MCM-48 materials in the ODP reaction has been characterized. Nitrous oxide (N2O) has been found to be advantageous as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) compared to other oxidants like oxygen (O2). This is due to its ability to achieve higher propylene selectivity. The study of VOx/MCM-41, VOx/SiO2, and VOx/MCM-48 materials has shown that N2O can lead to a higher degree of reduction of vanadium species, which is essential for achieving high primary propylene selectivity and suppressing consecutive propylene oxidation to CO and CO2. The higher polymerized VOx species have a higher activity for consecutive propene oxidation, and the importance of direct propane oxidation and consecutive propene oxidation to COx is significantly higher in the presence of O2 than in N2O. The catalytic performance is determined by the oxidant activation, and N2O's lower oxidizing ability tunes the degree of reduction of vanadium species, leading to a higher reduction degree of VOx species. This effect is related to the spatial separation of active lattice oxygen species, reducing the surface density of active oxygen species. However, the degree of reduction of VOx species is not the only reason for the superior performance of N2O compared to O2. The nature of oxygen species also influences COx formation, with adsorbed (nonlattice) oxygen species being nonselective for the ODP reaction over certain catalytic materials. In contrast, N2O decomposition over reducible metal oxides yields mononuclear oxygen species, which are considered selective. The critical challenges associated with catalyst deactivation and stability in N2O-ODHP include the need for a high degree of reduction of vanadium species and the prevention of nonselective oxygen species formation. Strategies to address these limitations could involve the development of catalysts with controlled surface density of active oxygen species and the optimization of reaction conditions to favor selective oxygen species formation. Research directions could focus on understanding the mechanisms of oxygen species formation and their role in the selectivity of the ODHP process, as well as the development of new catalyst formulations that can maintain high activity and selectivity under N2O-ODHP conditions. Nitrous oxide (N2O) has been shown to have advantages over other oxidants in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP), particularly in terms of propylene selectivity. The use of N2O as an oxidant results in higher propylene selectivity compared to oxygen (O2) over a broad range of propane conversions. This effect is more pronounced for catalysts with microcrystalline V2O5. The improved selectivity is attributed to the ability of N2O to achieve a higher primary propene selectivity and to lower the activity for consecutive propene oxidation. N2O reoxidizes reduced VOx species slower than O2, which is essential for suppressing nonselective consecutive propene oxidation to COx. The nature of oxygen species also plays a role, with N2O not producing nonselective adsorbed oxygen species that can catalyze nonselective consecutive propene oxidation to COx. A variety of catalysts have been employed in the ODHP process, including VOx/SiO2, VOx/MCM-41, and VOx/MCM-48. These catalysts have been characterized using various techniques such as transmission electron microscopy (TEM), temperature-programmed reduction (TPR), UV/vis, Raman, and X-ray diffraction (XRD). The specific surface area of the catalysts decreases with vanadium loading, and the degree of polymerization of VOx species is influenced by the support material. The catalytic activity of the VOx(2.7)/MCM-41 catalyst is slightly higher than that of the VOx(2.8)/SiO2 and VOx(3.4)/MCM-48 samples, possibly due to a lower degree of polymerization of VOx species. The lowest activity was observed over the VOx(11.2)/MCM-41 sample, which possesses microcrystalline V2O5. Catalyst deactivation and stability are critical challenges in the ODHP process. The use of N2O as an oxidant can help mitigate these issues by reducing the formation of nonselective adsorbed oxygen species that can lead to catalyst deactivation. However, the lower activity of N2O compared to O2 can also be a limitation. Strategies to address these challenges include optimizing the catalyst structure and composition to enhance stability and selectivity, developing methods to regenerate deactivated catalysts, and exploring alternative oxidants that can provide high selectivity and activity while maintaining catalyst stability.

Nitrous oxide (N2O) has been used as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) to increase the selectivity to propylene compared to other oxidants. The catalysts employed in this process include a mixture of NiMoO4 and -Sb2O4, and a palladium supported on a mixed Zr-Ce-O oxide catalyst. The addition of N2O in the feed leads to a significant increase in the selectivity to propylene, while the conversion of propane and oxygen and the yield in CO2 decrease. N2O promotes the reduction of molybdenum, which is beneficial for the selectivity of the catalyst. However, the conversion of propane and the yield of CO2 decrease, which may limit the practical application of N2O-ODHP. The challenge of catalyst deactivation and stability is also a critical issue that needs to be addressed. Strategies to improve the stability of the catalysts and reduce the deactivation rate could potentially make N2O-ODHP a more feasible option for practical implementation. For example, the use of more stable catalysts or the development of new catalysts with higher activity and selectivity could be explored. Additionally, the optimization of the reaction conditions, such as temperature, pressure, and feed composition, could also help to improve the stability of the catalysts and reduce the deactivation rate.

Nitrous oxide (N2O) is an efficient oxidant for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) over steam-activated Fe-zeolites (MFI and BEA), achieving initial propylene yields up to 25% at 723 K. However, catalyst deactivation occurs due to coke formation.
          A tapered element oscillating microbalance (TEOM) coupled to GC analysis has been applied to correlate activity and deactivation by simultaneous measurements of reaction and coking.
          Extraframework iron species, generated during steam treatment, are essential for producing active catalysts.
          The nature and distribution of extraframework iron species, the zeolite host, and the catalyst acidity have no significant effect on the initial propene yield, but strongly influence the deactivation behavior.
          FeZSM-5 shows a remarkable resistance against deactivation, while a very rapid and complete deactivation occurred in FeBEA.
          The initial propene yield over FeZSM-5 and FeBEA was remarkably higher than over commercial H-ZSM-5 and H-BEA (with 3040 times lower iron content), although the residual activities after 400 min on stream were very similar.
          Remarkable yields toward propionaldehyde (up to 6%) have been obtained.
          A major drawback of FeMFI zeolites in ODHP with N2O is the deactivation by coke, causing a rapid decrease of the propene yield.
          The TEOM consists of a microreactor with a high-resolution microbalance that generates real-time measurements of mass changes during gas-solid reactions.
          The TEOM presents three main advantages over conventional gravimetric microbalances: a well-defined flow pattern, a very fast response time resolution (0.1 s), and a high mass resolution across the entire range of pressure and temperature.
          Steam activation is essential for achieving high catalytic activities, as concluded from the low conversion of reactants and propene yield obtained over the calcined iron zeolites.
          Extraframework iron species, generated during steam treatment, are responsible for the oxydehydrogenation of propane with nitrous oxide.
          The difference in initial C3H6 yield between ex-FeZSM-5 and ex-Fe-silicalite is marginal if their constitution with respect to iron is taken into account.
          The initial activity of the synthesized Fe-zeolites is significantly higher than over the commercial zeolites, while the former catalysts contain 30 40 times more iron.
          The rapid deactivation observed in ex-FeBEA and ex-H-BEA can be connected to the presence of large cavities with relatively small apertures in the BEA framework, especially at the intersection of the channels.
          The rate of deactivation over the MFI catalysts is significantly lower, and can be related to the absence of large cages in this zeolitic structure, since channels and intersections are of similar size.
          The higher deactivation resistance of steam-activated ex-FeZSM-5 in ODHP with N2O is unclear, but can be tentatively related to the different iron constitutions in both catalysts and/or the different porous structure associated with the presence of aluminum in the original zeolite framework.
          Ex-FeZSM-5 contains mesopores due to dealumination upon steam treatment, which are absent in ex-Fe-silicalite.
          The more open structure of FeZSM-5 may reduce pore blocking by coke and also improve transport of reactants and products, slowing down deactivation.
          The activity of ex-FeZSM-5 in direct N2O decomposition is significantly higher than that of ex-Fe-silicalite.
          N2O activation generates atomic oxygen over certain iron species, which is efficiently utilized for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane.
          However, recombination of atomic oxygen and desorption as O2 may lead to reaction with coke at specific locations of the zeolite at the operating temperature, resulting in COx.
          This function would partially regenerate the catalyst surface.
          This hypothesis would imply that highly active Fe-zeolite catalysts in direct N2O decomposition have an increased resistance toward coke deactivation in ODHP with N2O.

Nitrous oxide (N2O) is used as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) due to its ability to achieve higher propene selectivity compared to other oxidants, despite lower propane conversion. This is attributed to the fact that N2O reoxidizes the reduced vanadium species without forming peroxovanadates, which are highly reactive and can lead to the formation of carbon oxides. The use of N2O as an oxidant results in a slower reoxidation process, which allows for a higher selectivity towards propene. However, the catalyst deactivation is a critical challenge in this process, as it is mainly caused by the reduction of vanadium species rather than the formation of carbonaceous deposits. The regeneration of the catalyst by heating under N2O at high temperatures can partly restore its activity, but complete restoration requires reoxidation in the presence of oxygen. To address these limitations and make N2O-ODHP a more feasible option for practical implementation, research directions could focus on developing more stable catalysts that can maintain their activity over longer periods, optimizing the reaction conditions to minimize vanadium reduction, and exploring alternative regeneration methods that can effectively restore the catalyst's activity without the need for high-temperature treatments.

Nitrous oxide (N2O) can improve the selectivity of the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) process by inhibiting the adsorption of O2 and/or increasing the reduction rate of the catalysts. The oxygen produced by the dissociation of N2O can oxidize propane to propene. In the presence of N2O, catalytic sites work in a more reduced state. N2O has been used as a pure oxidant in various reactions, including the oxidative coupling of methane to ethane, the transformation of benzene to phenol, and the oxidation of ethylene to epoxide. The use of N2O in ODHP can potentially lead to higher propylene selectivity compared to other oxidants by controlling the oxidation state of the catalyst and limiting the formation of non-selective oxygen species. Adjusting the concentration of N2O could be a useful strategy to modulate selectivity during the catalytic reaction.

Nitrous oxide (N2O) has been shown to significantly improve propene selectivity in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) compared to molecular oxygen (O2) when used as an oxidant. This improvement has been observed over various catalysts, including steam-activated iron-containing zeolites, bulk vanadium oxides, and supported vanadium-containing materials. A similar effect of N2O has also been reported for the oxidative dehydrogenation of n-butane over vanadium magnesium oxide catalysts. The positive effect of N2O on the ODHP reaction is attributed to the slower reoxidation of reduced VOx species compared to O2, resulting in a lower steady-state concentration of active lattice oxygen sites and thus suppressing the consecutive oxidation of propene to carbon oxides. However, the activity of VOx sites for consecutive propene oxidation increases with rising agglomerization degree. Propene selectivities do not differ much as long as the vanadium surface concentration remains below monolayer coverage, with only isolated VOx sites and small two-dimensional VxOy clusters present. When V2O5 nanocrystallites dominate, there is a dramatic drop in propene selectivity and direct total oxidation of propane occurs with both oxidants, although this detrimental effect is less pronounced in the presence of N2O. A recent study suggested that compared to N2O, other oxygen species (non-lattice oxygen of VOx species) are formed from gas-phase O2 and participate in COx formation. However, there is limited experimental information on the nature of active oxygen species formed from O2 and N2O upon reoxidation of reduced VOx species. The aim of this study is to obtain experimental evidence on the nature and structure of oxygen species formed upon reoxidation of reduced highly dispersed VOx species supported over MCM-41 with O2 and N2O. The same VOx/MCM-41 catalyst used in this work has previously been thoroughly characterized and tested in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane. A turnover frequency of propane conversion of 0.016 molC3H8 mol1 V s1 has been measured with O2 used as an oxidizing agent. In comparison, the respective value with N2O was only half as high, while the propene selectivity was higher, amounting to 80% with N2O but only to 50% with O2 at propane conversion of approximately 10%. Since several of the previously postulated oxygen species were paramagnetic, EPR spectroscopy under controlled atmosphere conditions was applied to experimentally identify oxygen species formed from gaseous N2O and O2 over VOx/MCM-41 and to explore the reactivity of these species towards oxidation of C3H8, C3H6, and CO.

Nitrous oxide (N2O) has been shown to be a superior oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) compared to other oxidants like oxygen (O2). Steam-activated iron zeolites (Fe-zeolites) have demonstrated high initial propene yields of 24% at temperatures between 773 and 798 K, which are comparable to the highest yields reported over vanadium (V) and molybdenum (Mo)-based catalysts using O2. The essential role of N2O in this process is highlighted by the fact that propene production does not occur when propane interacts with iron zeolites in the absence of N2O. The remarkable performance of Fe-zeolites is attributed to the specificity of N2O as a monooxygen donor and the capability of iron forms in the zeolite to coordinate reactive atomic oxygen species for efficient propane dehydrogenation. However, a major drawback is the deactivation by coke, causing a rapid decrease in propene yield. The rate of deactivation varies among the zeolites studied, with Fe-beta deactivating the fastest, followed by Fe-silicalite and FeZSM-5. The deactivation behavior of FeZSM-5 suggests the presence of active iron sites with different sensitivity for coke deactivation. Catalyst deactivation is a complex process that can be caused by a decrease in the number of active sites, a decrease in the quality of active sites, or a decrease in accessibility of the pore space.

N2O is a mono-oxygen donor that can efficiently dehydrogenate propane due to the ability of certain iron species to coordinate reactive atomic oxygen species. This specificity of N2O contributes to the remarkable performance of iron zeolites in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP). However, a major drawback of iron zeolites in ODHP with N2O is the deactivation by coke, which leads to a rapid decrease in propylene yield. The tapered element oscillating microbalance (TEOM) technique coupled with gas chromatography (GC) analysis has been used to correlate deactivation and mass changes due to coking. While TEOM provides detailed and accurate in situ investigation of coke formation, it does not provide information on the deactivation mechanism at the catalyst surface level. To gain a better understanding of the deactivation of iron-containing zeolites in the C3H8 + N2O reaction and the subsequent regeneration in air, complementary spectroscopic studies under reaction conditions are needed. In situ FTIR spectroscopy is suitable for assessing coke deactivation of zeolite catalysts in hydrocarbon conversion by monitoring the formation of carbonaceous deposits and changes in vibrations associated with the surface acidity and framework of the microporous material. Observing the evolution of the working catalyst under true process conditions is useful for an improved understanding of the ODHP reaction. However, in situ investigations of selective oxidation of hydrocarbons with N2O over iron-containing zeolites have not been reported. Moreover, the reusability of the regenerated catalysts has not yet been addressed in detail. Infrared results were complemented by TEOMGC experiments over the catalysts at the same conditions. The degree of catalyst reversibility on reaction and regeneration is evaluated and discussed on the basis of these analyses and characterization of the fresh, coked, and regenerated samples by X-ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and nitrogen adsorption.

Nitrous oxide (N2O) has been identified as a promising oxidant for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) to produce propylene, a key petrochemical feedstock. Compared to traditional oxidants like oxygen, N2O allows for the production of propylene at lower temperatures, which can improve the efficiency and selectivity of the process. The use of N2O as an oxidant in ODHP has been shown to achieve remarkable propylene yields, particularly when iron zeolites are used as catalysts. These catalysts have been found to be effective at lower temperatures than those required for mixed metal oxide catalysts, which typically operate at higher temperatures. However, the performance of iron zeolites can vary significantly depending on the method of iron incorporation and the preparation technique. Steam activation of iron-substituted ZSM-5 zeolites has been shown to result in superior propylene yields compared to other preparation methods. Iron impurities in steamed commercial H-ZSM-5 zeolites have also been found to induce high propylene selectivity, leading to low COx formation. A major challenge in the use of N2O for ODHP is the deactivation of iron zeolite catalysts due to coke formation, which can limit the stability and lifetime of the catalyst. Strategies to address this limitation could include the development of more stable catalyst formulations, optimization of reaction conditions to minimize coke formation, and the use of in situ regeneration techniques to maintain catalyst activity. Research directions that could potentially make N2O-ODHP a more feasible option for practical implementation include the exploration of alternative iron sources and incorporation methods, the design of catalysts with enhanced resistance to deactivation, and the development of integrated process designs that incorporate catalyst regeneration steps.

The use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) presents several advantages, particularly in terms of propylene selectivity compared to other oxidants. N2O, being a strong greenhouse gas, can be effectively utilized in this process, potentially offering environmental benefits. The substitution of N2O for oxygen leads to a significant increase in propylene selectivity across various catalysts, including iron-containing zeolites and vanadium-based catalysts. Iron-based materials, such as Fe-ZSM-5, have been identified as particularly effective in yielding high propylene (C3H6) in ODHP using N2O. Other redox metal catalysts, such as vanadium and molybdenum, have also been explored for this purpose. However, a critical challenge associated with the use of N2O in ODHP is the rapid deactivation of catalysts, primarily due to coke formation. This issue significantly limits the feasibility of N2O as an oxidant compared to softer oxidants like CO2. The quick deactivation of catalysts under N2O conditions necessitates further research to improve catalyst stability and to gain a clearer understanding of the deactivation mechanisms. Addressing these limitations could potentially make N2O-ODHP a more viable option for practical implementation. Strategies to overcome these limitations might include the development of more stable catalyst formulations, the optimization of reaction conditions to minimize coke formation, and the engineering of catalysts with enhanced resistance to deactivation. Additionally, in-depth studies to elucidate the precise mechanisms of deactivation could guide the design of more robust catalysts for N2O-ODHP processes.

Nitrous oxide (N2O) has been shown to modify the catalytic performances of the same catalyst in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODP) reaction. Principally, it decreases the conversion of propane and oxygen, increases the yield and selectivity to propylene, and decreases the yield and selectivity to CO2. In the presence of N2O, catalytic sites work in a more reduced state, leading to a more selective reaction. When the amount of N2O is higher than 300 ppm, oxygen species coming from N2O dissociation could also play a role, suggesting that N2O is also able to induce the ODP, although less oxidant than O2. However, the use of pure N2O to perform the ODP is not advisable as molecular oxygen is necessary to oxidize and regenerate the catalysts in the presence of N2O, otherwise the catalyst deactivates quickly. N2O reduces the catalysts (molybdenum), explaining the high carbon formation. It is the presence of both O2 and N2O (as promoter) that can fully explain the better selectivity of the catalysts in ODP, due to the modulation of their adequate oxidation state during the reaction.

The use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) has several advantages in terms of propylene selectivity compared to other oxidants. N2O's lower ability for catalyst reoxidation leads to an increase in the degree of catalyst reduction, which spatially separates active lattice oxygen in surface VOx species. This separation favors selective oxidation over the formation of COx. Propylene selectivity over V/g-Al2O3 materials can be improved by fully covering the support with well-dispersed VOx species. The selectivity can be further tuned by using N2O as an alternative oxidizing agent. The lower activity of N2O is due to its reduced ability to reoxidize reduced VOx sites, which enhances propene selectivity. This effect is attributed to the less favorable reoxidation of the catalyst by N2O compared to O2. The decrease in the steady-state concentration of active surface lattice oxygen of VOx species favors selective propane oxidation to propene over COx formation, as only one to two lattice oxygen are necessary for the former reaction. Active sites with more than two lattice oxygen species favor the formation of waste products like CO and CO2. The effect of the oxidizing agent on the catalytic performance is also related to the nature of oxygen species originating from O2 and N2O. It has been suggested that atomic oxygen species are responsible for selective oxidation, while polyatomic oxygen species take part in COx formation. However, direct experimental evidence is not available at this stage.

N2O is a highly efficient oxidant for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) over steam-activated FeZSM-5, achieving propene yields up to 25% at 723 K. The remarkable performance of iron zeolites in ODHP is attributed to the specificity of N2O as a monooxygen donor and the capability of iron forms in the zeolite to coordinate reactive atomic oxygen species for efficient dehydrogenation of propane. However, a major drawback is the deactivation by coke formation, leading to a rapid decrease in propene yield. The rate of deactivation is reduced with an increase in temperature, and the relatively slow deactivation of FeZSM-5 at 773 K is associated with high N2O conversion. The use of O2 as an oxidant in ODHP over FeZSM-5 leads to very low C3H6 yields (<5%) compared to N2O. The addition of small amounts of O2 to the C3H8+N2O mixture results in a decrease in C3H6 selectivity and an increase in COx production. The intermediates essential for propene production are negatively impacted by the presence of O2, severely deteriorating the performance of FeZSM-5 in N2O-mediated ODHP of propane. Strategies to address the limitations of catalyst deactivation and stability in N2O-ODHP include optimizing the reaction temperature to reduce deactivation rates, developing catalysts with improved resistance to coke formation, and exploring methods to regenerate the catalysts more efficiently. Research directions could focus on understanding the mechanisms of coke formation and identifying catalysts with active sites that are less susceptible to deactivation. Additionally, the development of cheap and selective catalyst systems for the low-temperature NH3 oxidation to N2O could provide a low-cost and reasonably pure source of N2O, making the process more feasible for practical implementation.

The literature does not provide a direct comparison of N2O as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) with other oxidants in terms of propylene selectivity. However, it does state that N2O is more selective than molecular oxygen in other oxidation reactions. The literature discusses the use of nickel molybdate catalysts in the ODHP process and the effects of adding N2O as a gas dope on the catalytic performance. The addition of N2O modifies the catalytic performances, with a decrease in propane conversion, an increase in propylene yield and selectivity, and a decrease in oxygen consumption and CO2 yield at low concentrations of N2O. At higher concentrations of N2O, the selectivity in propylene decreases, and carbonaceous products are formed. The literature does not address the critical challenges associated with catalyst deactivation and stability in the N2O-ODHP process. However, it does suggest that adjusting the concentration of promoters like N2O could be a useful tool to modulate the oxidation state of oxide catalysts and improve their catalytic performances.

The use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) has gained significant attention as an alternative to dioxygen. The primary advantage of N2O is its ability to produce propylene with higher selectivity compared to dioxygen, which tends to over-oxidize propane, leading to the formation of carbon oxides (CO and CO2) and lower olefin yields. Iron-zeolites, particularly Fe-ZSM-5, have been developed as unique catalysts for this process, with Fe-ZSM-5 exhibiting superior performance for ODHP with N2O after severe calcination. However, catalyst deactivation remains a critical challenge in the ODHP process, regardless of the oxidant used. The presence of propane as a reductant complicates the conversion of nitrous oxide on iron-zeolites, and the deactivation mechanism of catalysts in ODHP with N2O is not fully understood. Strategies to address these limitations could include further research into the deactivation mechanisms, development of more stable catalysts, and optimization of reaction conditions to minimize coke formation and maximize catalyst lifetime. These efforts could potentially make N2O-ODHP a more feasible option for practical implementation.

The use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) has the advantage of increasing propylene selectivity compared to other oxidants. This is because N2O decomposition is less favorable than O2 activation, leading to a decrease in the steady-state concentration of active sites and an increase in propene selectivity. The efficiency of isolated VOx species for selective ODHP is superimposed by non-selective oxidation over the naked surface of the acidic support, which is not covered by active vanadia. To achieve high performance in ODHP, it is desirable to design catalytic surfaces that are fully covered by well-dispersed vanadia species to avoid the strong adsorption of propene on the support surface. The steady-state concentration of active lattice oxygen, which takes part in propane and propene activation, should be optimized to control selective oxidation and combustion reactions. Using N2O instead of O2 can achieve this optimization.

Nitrous oxide (N2O) has been found to be advantageous as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) due to its ability to achieve higher propene selectivity compared to molecular oxygen (O2) at similar degrees of propane conversion. This is attributed to the weaker oxidizing potential of N2O, which inhibits the direct oxidation of propane and the consecutive oxidation of propene to carbon oxides (COx). The use of N2O as an oxidant results in a lower catalytic activity due to its weaker ability to re-oxidize the reduced surface vanadium oxide (VOx) species. However, there is no significant difference in propene selectivity between highly dispersed surface VOx species and crystalline V2O5 nanoparticles when N2O is used as an oxidant. In contrast, crystalline V2O5 nanoparticles are not selective for the ODHP reaction in the presence of O2. The positive effect of N2O on propene selectivity is related to the reduction in surface density (spatial separation) of active surface lattice oxygen in VOx species, as N2O is a weaker oxidant for re-oxidation of reduced VOx species compared to O2. From a stoichiometric point of view, selective propene formation is favored over combustion reactions at lower surface densities.

Nitrous oxide (N2O) has been shown to increase propylene selectivity in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) compared to other oxidants like oxygen (O2). This improvement is attributed to the lower ability of N2O to re-oxidize reduced vanadium oxide (VOx) species, leading to a higher degree of catalyst reduction. The use of N2O can result in up to three times higher propylene selectivity compared to O2, especially when the catalyst contains bulk-like V2O5 species. N2O reduces the tendency for direct propane combustion and consecutive propene oxidation to COx, leading to improved initial propene selectivity. The nature of oxygen species originating from O2 and N2O also plays a role in the selectivity and activity of the catalyst.

Nitrous oxide (N2O) has been shown to increase propene selectivity in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) over alumina- and silica-supported vanadia catalysts compared to O2. However, the ODP activity with N2O is lower than with O2. The degree of reduction of VOx species is suggested to be important for achieving high propene selectivity. The nature of oxygen species, whether adsorbed (nonlattice) or lattice, also influences COx formation. Adsorbed oxygen species are considered nonselective for the ODP reaction over certain catalysts. The redox dynamics of VOx species have been studied using in-situ UV/vis analysis, and the catalytic performance of different VOx/SiO2, VOx/MCM-41, and VOx/MCM-48 materials in the ODP reaction has been characterized. Nitrous oxide (N2O) has been found to be advantageous as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) compared to other oxidants like oxygen (O2). This is due to its ability to achieve higher propylene selectivity. The study of VOx/MCM-41, VOx/SiO2, and VOx/MCM-48 materials has shown that N2O can lead to a higher degree of reduction of vanadium species, which is essential for achieving high primary propylene selectivity and suppressing consecutive propylene oxidation to CO and CO2. The higher polymerized VOx species have a higher activity for consecutive propene oxidation, and the importance of direct propane oxidation and consecutive propene oxidation to COx is significantly higher in the presence of O2 than in N2O. The catalytic performance is determined by the oxidant activation, and N2O's lower oxidizing ability tunes the degree of reduction of vanadium species, leading to a higher reduction degree of VOx species. This effect is related to the spatial separation of active lattice oxygen species, reducing the surface density of active oxygen species. However, the degree of reduction of VOx species is not the only reason for the superior performance of N2O compared to O2. The nature of oxygen species also influences COx formation, with adsorbed (nonlattice) oxygen species being nonselective for the ODP reaction over certain catalytic materials. In contrast, N2O decomposition over reducible metal oxides yields mononuclear oxygen species, which are considered selective. The critical challenges associated with catalyst deactivation and stability in N2O-ODHP include the need for a high degree of reduction of vanadium species and the prevention of nonselective oxygen species formation. Strategies to address these limitations could involve the development of catalysts with controlled surface density of active oxygen species and the optimization of reaction conditions to favor selective oxygen species formation. Research directions could focus on understanding the mechanisms of oxygen species formation and their role in the selectivity of the ODHP process, as well as the development of new catalyst formulations that can maintain high activity and selectivity under N2O-ODHP conditions. Nitrous oxide (N2O) has been shown to have advantages over other oxidants in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP), particularly in terms of propylene selectivity. The use of N2O as an oxidant results in higher propylene selectivity compared to oxygen (O2) over a broad range of propane conversions. This effect is more pronounced for catalysts with microcrystalline V2O5. The improved selectivity is attributed to the ability of N2O to achieve a higher primary propene selectivity and to lower the activity for consecutive propene oxidation. N2O reoxidizes reduced VOx species slower than O2, which is essential for suppressing nonselective consecutive propene oxidation to COx. The nature of oxygen species also plays a role, with N2O not producing nonselective adsorbed oxygen species that can catalyze nonselective consecutive propene oxidation to COx. A variety of catalysts have been employed in the ODHP process, including VOx/SiO2, VOx/MCM-41, and VOx/MCM-48. These catalysts have been characterized using various techniques such as transmission electron microscopy (TEM), temperature-programmed reduction (TPR), UV/vis, Raman, and X-ray diffraction (XRD). The specific surface area of the catalysts decreases with vanadium loading, and the degree of polymerization of VOx species is influenced by the support material. The catalytic activity of the VOx(2.7)/MCM-41 catalyst is slightly higher than that of the VOx(2.8)/SiO2 and VOx(3.4)/MCM-48 samples, possibly due to a lower degree of polymerization of VOx species. The lowest activity was observed over the VOx(11.2)/MCM-41 sample, which possesses microcrystalline V2O5. Catalyst deactivation and stability are critical challenges in the ODHP process. The use of N2O as an oxidant can help mitigate these issues by reducing the formation of nonselective adsorbed oxygen species that can lead to catalyst deactivation. However, the lower activity of N2O compared to O2 can also be a limitation. Strategies to address these challenges include optimizing the catalyst structure and composition to enhance stability and selectivity, developing methods to regenerate deactivated catalysts, and exploring alternative oxidants that can provide high selectivity and activity while maintaining catalyst stability.

Nitrous oxide (N2O) has been used as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) to increase the selectivity to propylene compared to other oxidants. The catalysts employed in this process include a mixture of NiMoO4 and -Sb2O4, and a palladium supported on a mixed Zr-Ce-O oxide catalyst. The addition of N2O in the feed leads to a significant increase in the selectivity to propylene, while the conversion of propane and oxygen and the yield in CO2 decrease. N2O promotes the reduction of molybdenum, which is beneficial for the selectivity of the catalyst. However, the conversion of propane and the yield of CO2 decrease, which may limit the practical application of N2O-ODHP. The challenge of catalyst deactivation and stability is also a critical issue that needs to be addressed. Strategies to improve the stability of the catalysts and reduce the deactivation rate could potentially make N2O-ODHP a more feasible option for practical implementation. For example, the use of more stable catalysts or the development of new catalysts with higher activity and selectivity could be explored. Additionally, the optimization of the reaction conditions, such as temperature, pressure, and feed composition, could also help to improve the stability of the catalysts and reduce the deactivation rate.

Nitrous oxide (N2O) is an efficient oxidant for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) over steam-activated Fe-zeolites (MFI and BEA), achieving initial propylene yields up to 25% at 723 K. However, catalyst deactivation occurs due to coke formation.
          A tapered element oscillating microbalance (TEOM) coupled to GC analysis has been applied to correlate activity and deactivation by simultaneous measurements of reaction and coking.
          Extraframework iron species, generated during steam treatment, are essential for producing active catalysts.
          The nature and distribution of extraframework iron species, the zeolite host, and the catalyst acidity have no significant effect on the initial propene yield, but strongly influence the deactivation behavior.
          FeZSM-5 shows a remarkable resistance against deactivation, while a very rapid and complete deactivation occurred in FeBEA.
          The initial propene yield over FeZSM-5 and FeBEA was remarkably higher than over commercial H-ZSM-5 and H-BEA (with 3040 times lower iron content), although the residual activities after 400 min on stream were very similar.
          Remarkable yields toward propionaldehyde (up to 6%) have been obtained.
          A major drawback of FeMFI zeolites in ODHP with N2O is the deactivation by coke, causing a rapid decrease of the propene yield.
          The TEOM consists of a microreactor with a high-resolution microbalance that generates real-time measurements of mass changes during gas-solid reactions.
          The TEOM presents three main advantages over conventional gravimetric microbalances: a well-defined flow pattern, a very fast response time resolution (0.1 s), and a high mass resolution across the entire range of pressure and temperature.
          Steam activation is essential for achieving high catalytic activities, as concluded from the low conversion of reactants and propene yield obtained over the calcined iron zeolites.
          Extraframework iron species, generated during steam treatment, are responsible for the oxydehydrogenation of propane with nitrous oxide.
          The difference in initial C3H6 yield between ex-FeZSM-5 and ex-Fe-silicalite is marginal if their constitution with respect to iron is taken into account.
          The initial activity of the synthesized Fe-zeolites is significantly higher than over the commercial zeolites, while the former catalysts contain 30 40 times more iron.
          The rapid deactivation observed in ex-FeBEA and ex-H-BEA can be connected to the presence of large cavities with relatively small apertures in the BEA framework, especially at the intersection of the channels.
          The rate of deactivation over the MFI catalysts is significantly lower, and can be related to the absence of large cages in this zeolitic structure, since channels and intersections are of similar size.
          The higher deactivation resistance of steam-activated ex-FeZSM-5 in ODHP with N2O is unclear, but can be tentatively related to the different iron constitutions in both catalysts and/or the different porous structure associated with the presence of aluminum in the original zeolite framework.
          Ex-FeZSM-5 contains mesopores due to dealumination upon steam treatment, which are absent in ex-Fe-silicalite.
          The more open structure of FeZSM-5 may reduce pore blocking by coke and also improve transport of reactants and products, slowing down deactivation.
          The activity of ex-FeZSM-5 in direct N2O decomposition is significantly higher than that of ex-Fe-silicalite.
          N2O activation generates atomic oxygen over certain iron species, which is efficiently utilized for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane.
          However, recombination of atomic oxygen and desorption as O2 may lead to reaction with coke at specific locations of the zeolite at the operating temperature, resulting in COx.
          This function would partially regenerate the catalyst surface.
          This hypothesis would imply that highly active Fe-zeolite catalysts in direct N2O decomposition have an increased resistance toward coke deactivation in ODHP with N2O.

Nitrous oxide (N2O) is used as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) due to its ability to achieve higher propene selectivity compared to other oxidants, despite lower propane conversion. This is attributed to the fact that N2O reoxidizes the reduced vanadium species without forming peroxovanadates, which are highly reactive and can lead to the formation of carbon oxides. The use of N2O as an oxidant results in a slower reoxidation process, which allows for a higher selectivity towards propene. However, the catalyst deactivation is a critical challenge in this process, as it is mainly caused by the reduction of vanadium species rather than the formation of carbonaceous deposits. The regeneration of the catalyst by heating under N2O at high temperatures can partly restore its activity, but complete restoration requires reoxidation in the presence of oxygen. To address these limitations and make N2O-ODHP a more feasible option for practical implementation, research directions could focus on developing more stable catalysts that can maintain their activity over longer periods, optimizing the reaction conditions to minimize vanadium reduction, and exploring alternative regeneration methods that can effectively restore the catalyst's activity without the need for high-temperature treatments.

Nitrous oxide (N2O) can improve the selectivity of the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) process by inhibiting the adsorption of O2 and/or increasing the reduction rate of the catalysts. The oxygen produced by the dissociation of N2O can oxidize propane to propene. In the presence of N2O, catalytic sites work in a more reduced state. N2O has been used as a pure oxidant in various reactions, including the oxidative coupling of methane to ethane, the transformation of benzene to phenol, and the oxidation of ethylene to epoxide. The use of N2O in ODHP can potentially lead to higher propylene selectivity compared to other oxidants by controlling the oxidation state of the catalyst and limiting the formation of non-selective oxygen species. Adjusting the concentration of N2O could be a useful strategy to modulate selectivity during the catalytic reaction.

Nitrous oxide (N2O) has been shown to significantly improve propene selectivity in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) compared to molecular oxygen (O2) when used as an oxidant. This improvement has been observed over various catalysts, including steam-activated iron-containing zeolites, bulk vanadium oxides, and supported vanadium-containing materials. A similar effect of N2O has also been reported for the oxidative dehydrogenation of n-butane over vanadium magnesium oxide catalysts. The positive effect of N2O on the ODHP reaction is attributed to the slower reoxidation of reduced VOx species compared to O2, resulting in a lower steady-state concentration of active lattice oxygen sites and thus suppressing the consecutive oxidation of propene to carbon oxides. However, the activity of VOx sites for consecutive propene oxidation increases with rising agglomerization degree. Propene selectivities do not differ much as long as the vanadium surface concentration remains below monolayer coverage, with only isolated VOx sites and small two-dimensional VxOy clusters present. When V2O5 nanocrystallites dominate, there is a dramatic drop in propene selectivity and direct total oxidation of propane occurs with both oxidants, although this detrimental effect is less pronounced in the presence of N2O. A recent study suggested that compared to N2O, other oxygen species (non-lattice oxygen of VOx species) are formed from gas-phase O2 and participate in COx formation. However, there is limited experimental information on the nature of active oxygen species formed from O2 and N2O upon reoxidation of reduced VOx species. The aim of this study is to obtain experimental evidence on the nature and structure of oxygen species formed upon reoxidation of reduced highly dispersed VOx species supported over MCM-41 with O2 and N2O. The same VOx/MCM-41 catalyst used in this work has previously been thoroughly characterized and tested in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane. A turnover frequency of propane conversion of 0.016 molC3H8 mol1 V s1 has been measured with O2 used as an oxidizing agent. In comparison, the respective value with N2O was only half as high, while the propene selectivity was higher, amounting to 80% with N2O but only to 50% with O2 at propane conversion of approximately 10%. Since several of the previously postulated oxygen species were paramagnetic, EPR spectroscopy under controlled atmosphere conditions was applied to experimentally identify oxygen species formed from gaseous N2O and O2 over VOx/MCM-41 and to explore the reactivity of these species towards oxidation of C3H8, C3H6, and CO.

Nitrous oxide (N2O) has been shown to be a superior oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) compared to other oxidants like oxygen (O2). Steam-activated iron zeolites (Fe-zeolites) have demonstrated high initial propene yields of 24% at temperatures between 773 and 798 K, which are comparable to the highest yields reported over vanadium (V) and molybdenum (Mo)-based catalysts using O2. The essential role of N2O in this process is highlighted by the fact that propene production does not occur when propane interacts with iron zeolites in the absence of N2O. The remarkable performance of Fe-zeolites is attributed to the specificity of N2O as a monooxygen donor and the capability of iron forms in the zeolite to coordinate reactive atomic oxygen species for efficient propane dehydrogenation. However, a major drawback is the deactivation by coke, causing a rapid decrease in propene yield. The rate of deactivation varies among the zeolites studied, with Fe-beta deactivating the fastest, followed by Fe-silicalite and FeZSM-5. The deactivation behavior of FeZSM-5 suggests the presence of active iron sites with different sensitivity for coke deactivation. Catalyst deactivation is a complex process that can be caused by a decrease in the number of active sites, a decrease in the quality of active sites, or a decrease in accessibility of the pore space.

N2O is a mono-oxygen donor that can efficiently dehydrogenate propane due to the ability of certain iron species to coordinate reactive atomic oxygen species. This specificity of N2O contributes to the remarkable performance of iron zeolites in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP). However, a major drawback of iron zeolites in ODHP with N2O is the deactivation by coke, which leads to a rapid decrease in propylene yield. The tapered element oscillating microbalance (TEOM) technique coupled with gas chromatography (GC) analysis has been used to correlate deactivation and mass changes due to coking. While TEOM provides detailed and accurate in situ investigation of coke formation, it does not provide information on the deactivation mechanism at the catalyst surface level. To gain a better understanding of the deactivation of iron-containing zeolites in the C3H8 + N2O reaction and the subsequent regeneration in air, complementary spectroscopic studies under reaction conditions are needed. In situ FTIR spectroscopy is suitable for assessing coke deactivation of zeolite catalysts in hydrocarbon conversion by monitoring the formation of carbonaceous deposits and changes in vibrations associated with the surface acidity and framework of the microporous material. Observing the evolution of the working catalyst under true process conditions is useful for an improved understanding of the ODHP reaction. However, in situ investigations of selective oxidation of hydrocarbons with N2O over iron-containing zeolites have not been reported. Moreover, the reusability of the regenerated catalysts has not yet been addressed in detail. Infrared results were complemented by TEOMGC experiments over the catalysts at the same conditions. The degree of catalyst reversibility on reaction and regeneration is evaluated and discussed on the basis of these analyses and characterization of the fresh, coked, and regenerated samples by X-ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and nitrogen adsorption.

Nitrous oxide (N2O) has been identified as a promising oxidant for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) to produce propylene, a key petrochemical feedstock. Compared to traditional oxidants like oxygen, N2O allows for the production of propylene at lower temperatures, which can improve the efficiency and selectivity of the process. The use of N2O as an oxidant in ODHP has been shown to achieve remarkable propylene yields, particularly when iron zeolites are used as catalysts. These catalysts have been found to be effective at lower temperatures than those required for mixed metal oxide catalysts, which typically operate at higher temperatures. However, the performance of iron zeolites can vary significantly depending on the method of iron incorporation and the preparation technique. Steam activation of iron-substituted ZSM-5 zeolites has been shown to result in superior propylene yields compared to other preparation methods. Iron impurities in steamed commercial H-ZSM-5 zeolites have also been found to induce high propylene selectivity, leading to low COx formation. A major challenge in the use of N2O for ODHP is the deactivation of iron zeolite catalysts due to coke formation, which can limit the stability and lifetime of the catalyst. Strategies to address this limitation could include the development of more stable catalyst formulations, optimization of reaction conditions to minimize coke formation, and the use of in situ regeneration techniques to maintain catalyst activity. Research directions that could potentially make N2O-ODHP a more feasible option for practical implementation include the exploration of alternative iron sources and incorporation methods, the design of catalysts with enhanced resistance to deactivation, and the development of integrated process designs that incorporate catalyst regeneration steps.

The use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) presents several advantages, particularly in terms of propylene selectivity compared to other oxidants. N2O, being a strong greenhouse gas, can be effectively utilized in this process, potentially offering environmental benefits. The substitution of N2O for oxygen leads to a significant increase in propylene selectivity across various catalysts, including iron-containing zeolites and vanadium-based catalysts. Iron-based materials, such as Fe-ZSM-5, have been identified as particularly effective in yielding high propylene (C3H6) in ODHP using N2O. Other redox metal catalysts, such as vanadium and molybdenum, have also been explored for this purpose. However, a critical challenge associated with the use of N2O in ODHP is the rapid deactivation of catalysts, primarily due to coke formation. This issue significantly limits the feasibility of N2O as an oxidant compared to softer oxidants like CO2. The quick deactivation of catalysts under N2O conditions necessitates further research to improve catalyst stability and to gain a clearer understanding of the deactivation mechanisms. Addressing these limitations could potentially make N2O-ODHP a more viable option for practical implementation. Strategies to overcome these limitations might include the development of more stable catalyst formulations, the optimization of reaction conditions to minimize coke formation, and the engineering of catalysts with enhanced resistance to deactivation. Additionally, in-depth studies to elucidate the precise mechanisms of deactivation could guide the design of more robust catalysts for N2O-ODHP processes.

Nitrous oxide (N2O) has been shown to modify the catalytic performances of the same catalyst in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODP) reaction. Principally, it decreases the conversion of propane and oxygen, increases the yield and selectivity to propylene, and decreases the yield and selectivity to CO2. In the presence of N2O, catalytic sites work in a more reduced state, leading to a more selective reaction. When the amount of N2O is higher than 300 ppm, oxygen species coming from N2O dissociation could also play a role, suggesting that N2O is also able to induce the ODP, although less oxidant than O2. However, the use of pure N2O to perform the ODP is not advisable as molecular oxygen is necessary to oxidize and regenerate the catalysts in the presence of N2O, otherwise the catalyst deactivates quickly. N2O reduces the catalysts (molybdenum), explaining the high carbon formation. It is the presence of both O2 and N2O (as promoter) that can fully explain the better selectivity of the catalysts in ODP, due to the modulation of their adequate oxidation state during the reaction.

The use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) has several advantages in terms of propylene selectivity compared to other oxidants. N2O's lower ability for catalyst reoxidation leads to an increase in the degree of catalyst reduction, which spatially separates active lattice oxygen in surface VOx species. This separation favors selective oxidation over the formation of COx. Propylene selectivity over V/g-Al2O3 materials can be improved by fully covering the support with well-dispersed VOx species. The selectivity can be further tuned by using N2O as an alternative oxidizing agent. The lower activity of N2O is due to its reduced ability to reoxidize reduced VOx sites, which enhances propene selectivity. This effect is attributed to the less favorable reoxidation of the catalyst by N2O compared to O2. The decrease in the steady-state concentration of active surface lattice oxygen of VOx species favors selective propane oxidation to propene over COx formation, as only one to two lattice oxygen are necessary for the former reaction. Active sites with more than two lattice oxygen species favor the formation of waste products like CO and CO2. The effect of the oxidizing agent on the catalytic performance is also related to the nature of oxygen species originating from O2 and N2O. It has been suggested that atomic oxygen species are responsible for selective oxidation, while polyatomic oxygen species take part in COx formation. However, direct experimental evidence is not available at this stage.

N2O is a highly efficient oxidant for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) over steam-activated FeZSM-5, achieving propene yields up to 25% at 723 K. The remarkable performance of iron zeolites in ODHP is attributed to the specificity of N2O as a monooxygen donor and the capability of iron forms in the zeolite to coordinate reactive atomic oxygen species for efficient dehydrogenation of propane. However, a major drawback is the deactivation by coke formation, leading to a rapid decrease in propene yield. The rate of deactivation is reduced with an increase in temperature, and the relatively slow deactivation of FeZSM-5 at 773 K is associated with high N2O conversion. The use of O2 as an oxidant in ODHP over FeZSM-5 leads to very low C3H6 yields (<5%) compared to N2O. The addition of small amounts of O2 to the C3H8+N2O mixture results in a decrease in C3H6 selectivity and an increase in COx production. The intermediates essential for propene production are negatively impacted by the presence of O2, severely deteriorating the performance of FeZSM-5 in N2O-mediated ODHP of propane. Strategies to address the limitations of catalyst deactivation and stability in N2O-ODHP include optimizing the reaction temperature to reduce deactivation rates, developing catalysts with improved resistance to coke formation, and exploring methods to regenerate the catalysts more efficiently. Research directions could focus on understanding the mechanisms of coke formation and identifying catalysts with active sites that are less susceptible to deactivation. Additionally, the development of cheap and selective catalyst systems for the low-temperature NH3 oxidation to N2O could provide a low-cost and reasonably pure source of N2O, making the process more feasible for practical implementation.

The literature does not provide a direct comparison of N2O as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) with other oxidants in terms of propylene selectivity. However, it does state that N2O is more selective than molecular oxygen in other oxidation reactions. The literature discusses the use of nickel molybdate catalysts in the ODHP process and the effects of adding N2O as a gas dope on the catalytic performance. The addition of N2O modifies the catalytic performances, with a decrease in propane conversion, an increase in propylene yield and selectivity, and a decrease in oxygen consumption and CO2 yield at low concentrations of N2O. At higher concentrations of N2O, the selectivity in propylene decreases, and carbonaceous products are formed. The literature does not address the critical challenges associated with catalyst deactivation and stability in the N2O-ODHP process. However, it does suggest that adjusting the concentration of promoters like N2O could be a useful tool to modulate the oxidation state of oxide catalysts and improve their catalytic performances.

The use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) has gained significant attention as an alternative to dioxygen. The primary advantage of N2O is its ability to produce propylene with higher selectivity compared to dioxygen, which tends to over-oxidize propane, leading to the formation of carbon oxides (CO and CO2) and lower olefin yields. Iron-zeolites, particularly Fe-ZSM-5, have been developed as unique catalysts for this process, with Fe-ZSM-5 exhibiting superior performance for ODHP with N2O after severe calcination. However, catalyst deactivation remains a critical challenge in the ODHP process, regardless of the oxidant used. The presence of propane as a reductant complicates the conversion of nitrous oxide on iron-zeolites, and the deactivation mechanism of catalysts in ODHP with N2O is not fully understood. Strategies to address these limitations could include further research into the deactivation mechanisms, development of more stable catalysts, and optimization of reaction conditions to minimize coke formation and maximize catalyst lifetime. These efforts could potentially make N2O-ODHP a more feasible option for practical implementation.

The use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) has the advantage of increasing propylene selectivity compared to other oxidants. This is because N2O decomposition is less favorable than O2 activation, leading to a decrease in the steady-state concentration of active sites and an increase in propene selectivity. The efficiency of isolated VOx species for selective ODHP is superimposed by non-selective oxidation over the naked surface of the acidic support, which is not covered by active vanadia. To achieve high performance in ODHP, it is desirable to design catalytic surfaces that are fully covered by well-dispersed vanadia species to avoid the strong adsorption of propene on the support surface. The steady-state concentration of active lattice oxygen, which takes part in propane and propene activation, should be optimized to control selective oxidation and combustion reactions. Using N2O instead of O2 can achieve this optimization.

Nitrous oxide (N2O) has been found to be advantageous as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) due to its ability to achieve higher propene selectivity compared to molecular oxygen (O2) at similar degrees of propane conversion. This is attributed to the weaker oxidizing potential of N2O, which inhibits the direct oxidation of propane and the consecutive oxidation of propene to carbon oxides (COx). The use of N2O as an oxidant results in a lower catalytic activity due to its weaker ability to re-oxidize the reduced surface vanadium oxide (VOx) species. However, there is no significant difference in propene selectivity between highly dispersed surface VOx species and crystalline V2O5 nanoparticles when N2O is used as an oxidant. In contrast, crystalline V2O5 nanoparticles are not selective for the ODHP reaction in the presence of O2. The positive effect of N2O on propene selectivity is related to the reduction in surface density (spatial separation) of active surface lattice oxygen in VOx species, as N2O is a weaker oxidant for re-oxidation of reduced VOx species compared to O2. From a stoichiometric point of view, selective propene formation is favored over combustion reactions at lower surface densities.

Nitrous oxide (N2O) has been shown to increase propylene selectivity in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) compared to other oxidants like oxygen (O2). This improvement is attributed to the lower ability of N2O to re-oxidize reduced vanadium oxide (VOx) species, leading to a higher degree of catalyst reduction. The use of N2O can result in up to three times higher propylene selectivity compared to O2, especially when the catalyst contains bulk-like V2O5 species. N2O reduces the tendency for direct propane combustion and consecutive propene oxidation to COx, leading to improved initial propene selectivity. The nature of oxygen species originating from O2 and N2O also plays a role in the selectivity and activity of the catalyst.

Nitrous oxide (N2O) has been shown to increase propene selectivity in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) over alumina- and silica-supported vanadia catalysts compared to O2. However, the ODP activity with N2O is lower than with O2. The degree of reduction of VOx species is suggested to be important for achieving high propene selectivity. The nature of oxygen species, whether adsorbed (nonlattice) or lattice, also influences COx formation. Adsorbed oxygen species are considered nonselective for the ODP reaction over certain catalysts. The redox dynamics of VOx species have been studied using in-situ UV/vis analysis, and the catalytic performance of different VOx/SiO2, VOx/MCM-41, and VOx/MCM-48 materials in the ODP reaction has been characterized. Nitrous oxide (N2O) has been found to be advantageous as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) compared to other oxidants like oxygen (O2). This is due to its ability to achieve higher propylene selectivity. The study of VOx/MCM-41, VOx/SiO2, and VOx/MCM-48 materials has shown that N2O can lead to a higher degree of reduction of vanadium species, which is essential for achieving high primary propylene selectivity and suppressing consecutive propylene oxidation to CO and CO2. The higher polymerized VOx species have a higher activity for consecutive propene oxidation, and the importance of direct propane oxidation and consecutive propene oxidation to COx is significantly higher in the presence of O2 than in N2O. The catalytic performance is determined by the oxidant activation, and N2O's lower oxidizing ability tunes the degree of reduction of vanadium species, leading to a higher reduction degree of VOx species. This effect is related to the spatial separation of active lattice oxygen species, reducing the surface density of active oxygen species. However, the degree of reduction of VOx species is not the only reason for the superior performance of N2O compared to O2. The nature of oxygen species also influences COx formation, with adsorbed (nonlattice) oxygen species being nonselective for the ODP reaction over certain catalytic materials. In contrast, N2O decomposition over reducible metal oxides yields mononuclear oxygen species, which are considered selective. The critical challenges associated with catalyst deactivation and stability in N2O-ODHP include the need for a high degree of reduction of vanadium species and the prevention of nonselective oxygen species formation. Strategies to address these limitations could involve the development of catalysts with controlled surface density of active oxygen species and the optimization of reaction conditions to favor selective oxygen species formation. Research directions could focus on understanding the mechanisms of oxygen species formation and their role in the selectivity of the ODHP process, as well as the development of new catalyst formulations that can maintain high activity and selectivity under N2O-ODHP conditions. Nitrous oxide (N2O) has been shown to have advantages over other oxidants in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP), particularly in terms of propylene selectivity. The use of N2O as an oxidant results in higher propylene selectivity compared to oxygen (O2) over a broad range of propane conversions. This effect is more pronounced for catalysts with microcrystalline V2O5. The improved selectivity is attributed to the ability of N2O to achieve a higher primary propene selectivity and to lower the activity for consecutive propene oxidation. N2O reoxidizes reduced VOx species slower than O2, which is essential for suppressing nonselective consecutive propene oxidation to COx. The nature of oxygen species also plays a role, with N2O not producing nonselective adsorbed oxygen species that can catalyze nonselective consecutive propene oxidation to COx. A variety of catalysts have been employed in the ODHP process, including VOx/SiO2, VOx/MCM-41, and VOx/MCM-48. These catalysts have been characterized using various techniques such as transmission electron microscopy (TEM), temperature-programmed reduction (TPR), UV/vis, Raman, and X-ray diffraction (XRD). The specific surface area of the catalysts decreases with vanadium loading, and the degree of polymerization of VOx species is influenced by the support material. The catalytic activity of the VOx(2.7)/MCM-41 catalyst is slightly higher than that of the VOx(2.8)/SiO2 and VOx(3.4)/MCM-48 samples, possibly due to a lower degree of polymerization of VOx species. The lowest activity was observed over the VOx(11.2)/MCM-41 sample, which possesses microcrystalline V2O5. Catalyst deactivation and stability are critical challenges in the ODHP process. The use of N2O as an oxidant can help mitigate these issues by reducing the formation of nonselective adsorbed oxygen species that can lead to catalyst deactivation. However, the lower activity of N2O compared to O2 can also be a limitation. Strategies to address these challenges include optimizing the catalyst structure and composition to enhance stability and selectivity, developing methods to regenerate deactivated catalysts, and exploring alternative oxidants that can provide high selectivity and activity while maintaining catalyst stability.

Nitrous oxide (N2O) has been used as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) to increase the selectivity to propylene compared to other oxidants. The catalysts employed in this process include a mixture of NiMoO4 and -Sb2O4, and a palladium supported on a mixed Zr-Ce-O oxide catalyst. The addition of N2O in the feed leads to a significant increase in the selectivity to propylene, while the conversion of propane and oxygen and the yield in CO2 decrease. N2O promotes the reduction of molybdenum, which is beneficial for the selectivity of the catalyst. However, the conversion of propane and the yield of CO2 decrease, which may limit the practical application of N2O-ODHP. The challenge of catalyst deactivation and stability is also a critical issue that needs to be addressed. Strategies to improve the stability of the catalysts and reduce the deactivation rate could potentially make N2O-ODHP a more feasible option for practical implementation. For example, the use of more stable catalysts or the development of new catalysts with higher activity and selectivity could be explored. Additionally, the optimization of the reaction conditions, such as temperature, pressure, and feed composition, could also help to improve the stability of the catalysts and reduce the deactivation rate.

Nitrous oxide (N2O) is an efficient oxidant for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) over steam-activated Fe-zeolites (MFI and BEA), achieving initial propylene yields up to 25% at 723 K. However, catalyst deactivation occurs due to coke formation.
          A tapered element oscillating microbalance (TEOM) coupled to GC analysis has been applied to correlate activity and deactivation by simultaneous measurements of reaction and coking.
          Extraframework iron species, generated during steam treatment, are essential for producing active catalysts.
          The nature and distribution of extraframework iron species, the zeolite host, and the catalyst acidity have no significant effect on the initial propene yield, but strongly influence the deactivation behavior.
          FeZSM-5 shows a remarkable resistance against deactivation, while a very rapid and complete deactivation occurred in FeBEA.
          The initial propene yield over FeZSM-5 and FeBEA was remarkably higher than over commercial H-ZSM-5 and H-BEA (with 3040 times lower iron content), although the residual activities after 400 min on stream were very similar.
          Remarkable yields toward propionaldehyde (up to 6%) have been obtained.
          A major drawback of FeMFI zeolites in ODHP with N2O is the deactivation by coke, causing a rapid decrease of the propene yield.
          The TEOM consists of a microreactor with a high-resolution microbalance that generates real-time measurements of mass changes during gas-solid reactions.
          The TEOM presents three main advantages over conventional gravimetric microbalances: a well-defined flow pattern, a very fast response time resolution (0.1 s), and a high mass resolution across the entire range of pressure and temperature.
          Steam activation is essential for achieving high catalytic activities, as concluded from the low conversion of reactants and propene yield obtained over the calcined iron zeolites.
          Extraframework iron species, generated during steam treatment, are responsible for the oxydehydrogenation of propane with nitrous oxide.
          The difference in initial C3H6 yield between ex-FeZSM-5 and ex-Fe-silicalite is marginal if their constitution with respect to iron is taken into account.
          The initial activity of the synthesized Fe-zeolites is significantly higher than over the commercial zeolites, while the former catalysts contain 30 40 times more iron.
          The rapid deactivation observed in ex-FeBEA and ex-H-BEA can be connected to the presence of large cavities with relatively small apertures in the BEA framework, especially at the intersection of the channels.
          The rate of deactivation over the MFI catalysts is significantly lower, and can be related to the absence of large cages in this zeolitic structure, since channels and intersections are of similar size.
          The higher deactivation resistance of steam-activated ex-FeZSM-5 in ODHP with N2O is unclear, but can be tentatively related to the different iron constitutions in both catalysts and/or the different porous structure associated with the presence of aluminum in the original zeolite framework.
          Ex-FeZSM-5 contains mesopores due to dealumination upon steam treatment, which are absent in ex-Fe-silicalite.
          The more open structure of FeZSM-5 may reduce pore blocking by coke and also improve transport of reactants and products, slowing down deactivation.
          The activity of ex-FeZSM-5 in direct N2O decomposition is significantly higher than that of ex-Fe-silicalite.
          N2O activation generates atomic oxygen over certain iron species, which is efficiently utilized for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane.
          However, recombination of atomic oxygen and desorption as O2 may lead to reaction with coke at specific locations of the zeolite at the operating temperature, resulting in COx.
          This function would partially regenerate the catalyst surface.
          This hypothesis would imply that highly active Fe-zeolite catalysts in direct N2O decomposition have an increased resistance toward coke deactivation in ODHP with N2O.

Nitrous oxide (N2O) is used as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) due to its ability to achieve higher propene selectivity compared to other oxidants, despite lower propane conversion. This is attributed to the fact that N2O reoxidizes the reduced vanadium species without forming peroxovanadates, which are highly reactive and can lead to the formation of carbon oxides. The use of N2O as an oxidant results in a slower reoxidation process, which allows for a higher selectivity towards propene. However, the catalyst deactivation is a critical challenge in this process, as it is mainly caused by the reduction of vanadium species rather than the formation of carbonaceous deposits. The regeneration of the catalyst by heating under N2O at high temperatures can partly restore its activity, but complete restoration requires reoxidation in the presence of oxygen. To address these limitations and make N2O-ODHP a more feasible option for practical implementation, research directions could focus on developing more stable catalysts that can maintain their activity over longer periods, optimizing the reaction conditions to minimize vanadium reduction, and exploring alternative regeneration methods that can effectively restore the catalyst's activity without the need for high-temperature treatments.

Nitrous oxide (N2O) can improve the selectivity of the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) process by inhibiting the adsorption of O2 and/or increasing the reduction rate of the catalysts. The oxygen produced by the dissociation of N2O can oxidize propane to propene. In the presence of N2O, catalytic sites work in a more reduced state. N2O has been used as a pure oxidant in various reactions, including the oxidative coupling of methane to ethane, the transformation of benzene to phenol, and the oxidation of ethylene to epoxide. The use of N2O in ODHP can potentially lead to higher propylene selectivity compared to other oxidants by controlling the oxidation state of the catalyst and limiting the formation of non-selective oxygen species. Adjusting the concentration of N2O could be a useful strategy to modulate selectivity during the catalytic reaction.

Nitrous oxide (N2O) has been shown to significantly improve propene selectivity in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) compared to molecular oxygen (O2) when used as an oxidant. This improvement has been observed over various catalysts, including steam-activated iron-containing zeolites, bulk vanadium oxides, and supported vanadium-containing materials. A similar effect of N2O has also been reported for the oxidative dehydrogenation of n-butane over vanadium magnesium oxide catalysts. The positive effect of N2O on the ODHP reaction is attributed to the slower reoxidation of reduced VOx species compared to O2, resulting in a lower steady-state concentration of active lattice oxygen sites and thus suppressing the consecutive oxidation of propene to carbon oxides. However, the activity of VOx sites for consecutive propene oxidation increases with rising agglomerization degree. Propene selectivities do not differ much as long as the vanadium surface concentration remains below monolayer coverage, with only isolated VOx sites and small two-dimensional VxOy clusters present. When V2O5 nanocrystallites dominate, there is a dramatic drop in propene selectivity and direct total oxidation of propane occurs with both oxidants, although this detrimental effect is less pronounced in the presence of N2O. A recent study suggested that compared to N2O, other oxygen species (non-lattice oxygen of VOx species) are formed from gas-phase O2 and participate in COx formation. However, there is limited experimental information on the nature of active oxygen species formed from O2 and N2O upon reoxidation of reduced VOx species. The aim of this study is to obtain experimental evidence on the nature and structure of oxygen species formed upon reoxidation of reduced highly dispersed VOx species supported over MCM-41 with O2 and N2O. The same VOx/MCM-41 catalyst used in this work has previously been thoroughly characterized and tested in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane. A turnover frequency of propane conversion of 0.016 molC3H8 mol1 V s1 has been measured with O2 used as an oxidizing agent. In comparison, the respective value with N2O was only half as high, while the propene selectivity was higher, amounting to 80% with N2O but only to 50% with O2 at propane conversion of approximately 10%. Since several of the previously postulated oxygen species were paramagnetic, EPR spectroscopy under controlled atmosphere conditions was applied to experimentally identify oxygen species formed from gaseous N2O and O2 over VOx/MCM-41 and to explore the reactivity of these species towards oxidation of C3H8, C3H6, and CO.

Nitrous oxide (N2O) has been shown to be a superior oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) compared to other oxidants like oxygen (O2). Steam-activated iron zeolites (Fe-zeolites) have demonstrated high initial propene yields of 24% at temperatures between 773 and 798 K, which are comparable to the highest yields reported over vanadium (V) and molybdenum (Mo)-based catalysts using O2. The essential role of N2O in this process is highlighted by the fact that propene production does not occur when propane interacts with iron zeolites in the absence of N2O. The remarkable performance of Fe-zeolites is attributed to the specificity of N2O as a monooxygen donor and the capability of iron forms in the zeolite to coordinate reactive atomic oxygen species for efficient propane dehydrogenation. However, a major drawback is the deactivation by coke, causing a rapid decrease in propene yield. The rate of deactivation varies among the zeolites studied, with Fe-beta deactivating the fastest, followed by Fe-silicalite and FeZSM-5. The deactivation behavior of FeZSM-5 suggests the presence of active iron sites with different sensitivity for coke deactivation. Catalyst deactivation is a complex process that can be caused by a decrease in the number of active sites, a decrease in the quality of active sites, or a decrease in accessibility of the pore space.

N2O is a mono-oxygen donor that can efficiently dehydrogenate propane due to the ability of certain iron species to coordinate reactive atomic oxygen species. This specificity of N2O contributes to the remarkable performance of iron zeolites in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP). However, a major drawback of iron zeolites in ODHP with N2O is the deactivation by coke, which leads to a rapid decrease in propylene yield. The tapered element oscillating microbalance (TEOM) technique coupled with gas chromatography (GC) analysis has been used to correlate deactivation and mass changes due to coking. While TEOM provides detailed and accurate in situ investigation of coke formation, it does not provide information on the deactivation mechanism at the catalyst surface level. To gain a better understanding of the deactivation of iron-containing zeolites in the C3H8 + N2O reaction and the subsequent regeneration in air, complementary spectroscopic studies under reaction conditions are needed. In situ FTIR spectroscopy is suitable for assessing coke deactivation of zeolite catalysts in hydrocarbon conversion by monitoring the formation of carbonaceous deposits and changes in vibrations associated with the surface acidity and framework of the microporous material. Observing the evolution of the working catalyst under true process conditions is useful for an improved understanding of the ODHP reaction. However, in situ investigations of selective oxidation of hydrocarbons with N2O over iron-containing zeolites have not been reported. Moreover, the reusability of the regenerated catalysts has not yet been addressed in detail. Infrared results were complemented by TEOMGC experiments over the catalysts at the same conditions. The degree of catalyst reversibility on reaction and regeneration is evaluated and discussed on the basis of these analyses and characterization of the fresh, coked, and regenerated samples by X-ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and nitrogen adsorption.

Nitrous oxide (N2O) has been identified as a promising oxidant for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) to produce propylene, a key petrochemical feedstock. Compared to traditional oxidants like oxygen, N2O allows for the production of propylene at lower temperatures, which can improve the efficiency and selectivity of the process. The use of N2O as an oxidant in ODHP has been shown to achieve remarkable propylene yields, particularly when iron zeolites are used as catalysts. These catalysts have been found to be effective at lower temperatures than those required for mixed metal oxide catalysts, which typically operate at higher temperatures. However, the performance of iron zeolites can vary significantly depending on the method of iron incorporation and the preparation technique. Steam activation of iron-substituted ZSM-5 zeolites has been shown to result in superior propylene yields compared to other preparation methods. Iron impurities in steamed commercial H-ZSM-5 zeolites have also been found to induce high propylene selectivity, leading to low COx formation. A major challenge in the use of N2O for ODHP is the deactivation of iron zeolite catalysts due to coke formation, which can limit the stability and lifetime of the catalyst. Strategies to address this limitation could include the development of more stable catalyst formulations, optimization of reaction conditions to minimize coke formation, and the use of in situ regeneration techniques to maintain catalyst activity. Research directions that could potentially make N2O-ODHP a more feasible option for practical implementation include the exploration of alternative iron sources and incorporation methods, the design of catalysts with enhanced resistance to deactivation, and the development of integrated process designs that incorporate catalyst regeneration steps.

The use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) presents several advantages, particularly in terms of propylene selectivity compared to other oxidants. N2O, being a strong greenhouse gas, can be effectively utilized in this process, potentially offering environmental benefits. The substitution of N2O for oxygen leads to a significant increase in propylene selectivity across various catalysts, including iron-containing zeolites and vanadium-based catalysts. Iron-based materials, such as Fe-ZSM-5, have been identified as particularly effective in yielding high propylene (C3H6) in ODHP using N2O. Other redox metal catalysts, such as vanadium and molybdenum, have also been explored for this purpose. However, a critical challenge associated with the use of N2O in ODHP is the rapid deactivation of catalysts, primarily due to coke formation. This issue significantly limits the feasibility of N2O as an oxidant compared to softer oxidants like CO2. The quick deactivation of catalysts under N2O conditions necessitates further research to improve catalyst stability and to gain a clearer understanding of the deactivation mechanisms. Addressing these limitations could potentially make N2O-ODHP a more viable option for practical implementation. Strategies to overcome these limitations might include the development of more stable catalyst formulations, the optimization of reaction conditions to minimize coke formation, and the engineering of catalysts with enhanced resistance to deactivation. Additionally, in-depth studies to elucidate the precise mechanisms of deactivation could guide the design of more robust catalysts for N2O-ODHP processes.

Nitrous oxide (N2O) has been shown to modify the catalytic performances of the same catalyst in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODP) reaction. Principally, it decreases the conversion of propane and oxygen, increases the yield and selectivity to propylene, and decreases the yield and selectivity to CO2. In the presence of N2O, catalytic sites work in a more reduced state, leading to a more selective reaction. When the amount of N2O is higher than 300 ppm, oxygen species coming from N2O dissociation could also play a role, suggesting that N2O is also able to induce the ODP, although less oxidant than O2. However, the use of pure N2O to perform the ODP is not advisable as molecular oxygen is necessary to oxidize and regenerate the catalysts in the presence of N2O, otherwise the catalyst deactivates quickly. N2O reduces the catalysts (molybdenum), explaining the high carbon formation. It is the presence of both O2 and N2O (as promoter) that can fully explain the better selectivity of the catalysts in ODP, due to the modulation of their adequate oxidation state during the reaction.

The use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) has several advantages in terms of propylene selectivity compared to other oxidants. N2O's lower ability for catalyst reoxidation leads to an increase in the degree of catalyst reduction, which spatially separates active lattice oxygen in surface VOx species. This separation favors selective oxidation over the formation of COx. Propylene selectivity over V/g-Al2O3 materials can be improved by fully covering the support with well-dispersed VOx species. The selectivity can be further tuned by using N2O as an alternative oxidizing agent. The lower activity of N2O is due to its reduced ability to reoxidize reduced VOx sites, which enhances propene selectivity. This effect is attributed to the less favorable reoxidation of the catalyst by N2O compared to O2. The decrease in the steady-state concentration of active surface lattice oxygen of VOx species favors selective propane oxidation to propene over COx formation, as only one to two lattice oxygen are necessary for the former reaction. Active sites with more than two lattice oxygen species favor the formation of waste products like CO and CO2. The effect of the oxidizing agent on the catalytic performance is also related to the nature of oxygen species originating from O2 and N2O. It has been suggested that atomic oxygen species are responsible for selective oxidation, while polyatomic oxygen species take part in COx formation. However, direct experimental evidence is not available at this stage.

N2O is a highly efficient oxidant for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) over steam-activated FeZSM-5, achieving propene yields up to 25% at 723 K. The remarkable performance of iron zeolites in ODHP is attributed to the specificity of N2O as a monooxygen donor and the capability of iron forms in the zeolite to coordinate reactive atomic oxygen species for efficient dehydrogenation of propane. However, a major drawback is the deactivation by coke formation, leading to a rapid decrease in propene yield. The rate of deactivation is reduced with an increase in temperature, and the relatively slow deactivation of FeZSM-5 at 773 K is associated with high N2O conversion. The use of O2 as an oxidant in ODHP over FeZSM-5 leads to very low C3H6 yields (<5%) compared to N2O. The addition of small amounts of O2 to the C3H8+N2O mixture results in a decrease in C3H6 selectivity and an increase in COx production. The intermediates essential for propene production are negatively impacted by the presence of O2, severely deteriorating the performance of FeZSM-5 in N2O-mediated ODHP of propane. Strategies to address the limitations of catalyst deactivation and stability in N2O-ODHP include optimizing the reaction temperature to reduce deactivation rates, developing catalysts with improved resistance to coke formation, and exploring methods to regenerate the catalysts more efficiently. Research directions could focus on understanding the mechanisms of coke formation and identifying catalysts with active sites that are less susceptible to deactivation. Additionally, the development of cheap and selective catalyst systems for the low-temperature NH3 oxidation to N2O could provide a low-cost and reasonably pure source of N2O, making the process more feasible for practical implementation.

The literature does not provide a direct comparison of N2O as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) with other oxidants in terms of propylene selectivity. However, it does state that N2O is more selective than molecular oxygen in other oxidation reactions. The literature discusses the use of nickel molybdate catalysts in the ODHP process and the effects of adding N2O as a gas dope on the catalytic performance. The addition of N2O modifies the catalytic performances, with a decrease in propane conversion, an increase in propylene yield and selectivity, and a decrease in oxygen consumption and CO2 yield at low concentrations of N2O. At higher concentrations of N2O, the selectivity in propylene decreases, and carbonaceous products are formed. The literature does not address the critical challenges associated with catalyst deactivation and stability in the N2O-ODHP process. However, it does suggest that adjusting the concentration of promoters like N2O could be a useful tool to modulate the oxidation state of oxide catalysts and improve their catalytic performances.

The use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) has gained significant attention as an alternative to dioxygen. The primary advantage of N2O is its ability to produce propylene with higher selectivity compared to dioxygen, which tends to over-oxidize propane, leading to the formation of carbon oxides (CO and CO2) and lower olefin yields. Iron-zeolites, particularly Fe-ZSM-5, have been developed as unique catalysts for this process, with Fe-ZSM-5 exhibiting superior performance for ODHP with N2O after severe calcination. However, catalyst deactivation remains a critical challenge in the ODHP process, regardless of the oxidant used. The presence of propane as a reductant complicates the conversion of nitrous oxide on iron-zeolites, and the deactivation mechanism of catalysts in ODHP with N2O is not fully understood. Strategies to address these limitations could include further research into the deactivation mechanisms, development of more stable catalysts, and optimization of reaction conditions to minimize coke formation and maximize catalyst lifetime. These efforts could potentially make N2O-ODHP a more feasible option for practical implementation.

The use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) has the advantage of increasing propylene selectivity compared to other oxidants. This is because N2O decomposition is less favorable than O2 activation, leading to a decrease in the steady-state concentration of active sites and an increase in propene selectivity. The efficiency of isolated VOx species for selective ODHP is superimposed by non-selective oxidation over the naked surface of the acidic support, which is not covered by active vanadia. To achieve high performance in ODHP, it is desirable to design catalytic surfaces that are fully covered by well-dispersed vanadia species to avoid the strong adsorption of propene on the support surface. The steady-state concentration of active lattice oxygen, which takes part in propane and propene activation, should be optimized to control selective oxidation and combustion reactions. Using N2O instead of O2 can achieve this optimization.

Nitrous oxide (N2O) has been found to be advantageous as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) due to its ability to achieve higher propene selectivity compared to molecular oxygen (O2) at similar degrees of propane conversion. This is attributed to the weaker oxidizing potential of N2O, which inhibits the direct oxidation of propane and the consecutive oxidation of propene to carbon oxides (COx). The use of N2O as an oxidant results in a lower catalytic activity due to its weaker ability to re-oxidize the reduced surface vanadium oxide (VOx) species. However, there is no significant difference in propene selectivity between highly dispersed surface VOx species and crystalline V2O5 nanoparticles when N2O is used as an oxidant. In contrast, crystalline V2O5 nanoparticles are not selective for the ODHP reaction in the presence of O2. The positive effect of N2O on propene selectivity is related to the reduction in surface density (spatial separation) of active surface lattice oxygen in VOx species, as N2O is a weaker oxidant for re-oxidation of reduced VOx species compared to O2. From a stoichiometric point of view, selective propene formation is favored over combustion reactions at lower surface densities.

Nitrous oxide (N2O) has been shown to increase propylene selectivity in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) compared to other oxidants like oxygen (O2). This improvement is attributed to the lower ability of N2O to re-oxidize reduced vanadium oxide (VOx) species, leading to a higher degree of catalyst reduction. The use of N2O can result in up to three times higher propylene selectivity compared to O2, especially when the catalyst contains bulk-like V2O5 species. N2O reduces the tendency for direct propane combustion and consecutive propene oxidation to COx, leading to improved initial propene selectivity. The nature of oxygen species originating from O2 and N2O also plays a role in the selectivity and activity of the catalyst.

Nitrous oxide (N2O) has been shown to increase propene selectivity in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) over alumina- and silica-supported vanadia catalysts compared to O2. However, the ODP activity with N2O is lower than with O2. The degree of reduction of VOx species is suggested to be important for achieving high propene selectivity. The nature of oxygen species, whether adsorbed (nonlattice) or lattice, also influences COx formation. Adsorbed oxygen species are considered nonselective for the ODP reaction over certain catalysts. The redox dynamics of VOx species have been studied using in-situ UV/vis analysis, and the catalytic performance of different VOx/SiO2, VOx/MCM-41, and VOx/MCM-48 materials in the ODP reaction has been characterized. Nitrous oxide (N2O) has been found to be advantageous as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) compared to other oxidants like oxygen (O2). This is due to its ability to achieve higher propylene selectivity. The study of VOx/MCM-41, VOx/SiO2, and VOx/MCM-48 materials has shown that N2O can lead to a higher degree of reduction of vanadium species, which is essential for achieving high primary propylene selectivity and suppressing consecutive propylene oxidation to CO and CO2. The higher polymerized VOx species have a higher activity for consecutive propene oxidation, and the importance of direct propane oxidation and consecutive propene oxidation to COx is significantly higher in the presence of O2 than in N2O. The catalytic performance is determined by the oxidant activation, and N2O's lower oxidizing ability tunes the degree of reduction of vanadium species, leading to a higher reduction degree of VOx species. This effect is related to the spatial separation of active lattice oxygen species, reducing the surface density of active oxygen species. However, the degree of reduction of VOx species is not the only reason for the superior performance of N2O compared to O2. The nature of oxygen species also influences COx formation, with adsorbed (nonlattice) oxygen species being nonselective for the ODP reaction over certain catalytic materials. In contrast, N2O decomposition over reducible metal oxides yields mononuclear oxygen species, which are considered selective. The critical challenges associated with catalyst deactivation and stability in N2O-ODHP include the need for a high degree of reduction of vanadium species and the prevention of nonselective oxygen species formation. Strategies to address these limitations could involve the development of catalysts with controlled surface density of active oxygen species and the optimization of reaction conditions to favor selective oxygen species formation. Research directions could focus on understanding the mechanisms of oxygen species formation and their role in the selectivity of the ODHP process, as well as the development of new catalyst formulations that can maintain high activity and selectivity under N2O-ODHP conditions. Nitrous oxide (N2O) has been shown to have advantages over other oxidants in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP), particularly in terms of propylene selectivity. The use of N2O as an oxidant results in higher propylene selectivity compared to oxygen (O2) over a broad range of propane conversions. This effect is more pronounced for catalysts with microcrystalline V2O5. The improved selectivity is attributed to the ability of N2O to achieve a higher primary propene selectivity and to lower the activity for consecutive propene oxidation. N2O reoxidizes reduced VOx species slower than O2, which is essential for suppressing nonselective consecutive propene oxidation to COx. The nature of oxygen species also plays a role, with N2O not producing nonselective adsorbed oxygen species that can catalyze nonselective consecutive propene oxidation to COx. A variety of catalysts have been employed in the ODHP process, including VOx/SiO2, VOx/MCM-41, and VOx/MCM-48. These catalysts have been characterized using various techniques such as transmission electron microscopy (TEM), temperature-programmed reduction (TPR), UV/vis, Raman, and X-ray diffraction (XRD). The specific surface area of the catalysts decreases with vanadium loading, and the degree of polymerization of VOx species is influenced by the support material. The catalytic activity of the VOx(2.7)/MCM-41 catalyst is slightly higher than that of the VOx(2.8)/SiO2 and VOx(3.4)/MCM-48 samples, possibly due to a lower degree of polymerization of VOx species. The lowest activity was observed over the VOx(11.2)/MCM-41 sample, which possesses microcrystalline V2O5. Catalyst deactivation and stability are critical challenges in the ODHP process. The use of N2O as an oxidant can help mitigate these issues by reducing the formation of nonselective adsorbed oxygen species that can lead to catalyst deactivation. However, the lower activity of N2O compared to O2 can also be a limitation. Strategies to address these challenges include optimizing the catalyst structure and composition to enhance stability and selectivity, developing methods to regenerate deactivated catalysts, and exploring alternative oxidants that can provide high selectivity and activity while maintaining catalyst stability.

Nitrous oxide (N2O) has been used as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) to increase the selectivity to propylene compared to other oxidants. The catalysts employed in this process include a mixture of NiMoO4 and -Sb2O4, and a palladium supported on a mixed Zr-Ce-O oxide catalyst. The addition of N2O in the feed leads to a significant increase in the selectivity to propylene, while the conversion of propane and oxygen and the yield in CO2 decrease. N2O promotes the reduction of molybdenum, which is beneficial for the selectivity of the catalyst. However, the conversion of propane and the yield of CO2 decrease, which may limit the practical application of N2O-ODHP. The challenge of catalyst deactivation and stability is also a critical issue that needs to be addressed. Strategies to improve the stability of the catalysts and reduce the deactivation rate could potentially make N2O-ODHP a more feasible option for practical implementation. For example, the use of more stable catalysts or the development of new catalysts with higher activity and selectivity could be explored. Additionally, the optimization of the reaction conditions, such as temperature, pressure, and feed composition, could also help to improve the stability of the catalysts and reduce the deactivation rate.

Nitrous oxide (N2O) is an efficient oxidant for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) over steam-activated Fe-zeolites (MFI and BEA), achieving initial propylene yields up to 25% at 723 K. However, catalyst deactivation occurs due to coke formation.
          A tapered element oscillating microbalance (TEOM) coupled to GC analysis has been applied to correlate activity and deactivation by simultaneous measurements of reaction and coking.
          Extraframework iron species, generated during steam treatment, are essential for producing active catalysts.
          The nature and distribution of extraframework iron species, the zeolite host, and the catalyst acidity have no significant effect on the initial propene yield, but strongly influence the deactivation behavior.
          FeZSM-5 shows a remarkable resistance against deactivation, while a very rapid and complete deactivation occurred in FeBEA.
          The initial propene yield over FeZSM-5 and FeBEA was remarkably higher than over commercial H-ZSM-5 and H-BEA (with 3040 times lower iron content), although the residual activities after 400 min on stream were very similar.
          Remarkable yields toward propionaldehyde (up to 6%) have been obtained.
          A major drawback of FeMFI zeolites in ODHP with N2O is the deactivation by coke, causing a rapid decrease of the propene yield.
          The TEOM consists of a microreactor with a high-resolution microbalance that generates real-time measurements of mass changes during gas-solid reactions.
          The TEOM presents three main advantages over conventional gravimetric microbalances: a well-defined flow pattern, a very fast response time resolution (0.1 s), and a high mass resolution across the entire range of pressure and temperature.
          Steam activation is essential for achieving high catalytic activities, as concluded from the low conversion of reactants and propene yield obtained over the calcined iron zeolites.
          Extraframework iron species, generated during steam treatment, are responsible for the oxydehydrogenation of propane with nitrous oxide.
          The difference in initial C3H6 yield between ex-FeZSM-5 and ex-Fe-silicalite is marginal if their constitution with respect to iron is taken into account.
          The initial activity of the synthesized Fe-zeolites is significantly higher than over the commercial zeolites, while the former catalysts contain 30 40 times more iron.
          The rapid deactivation observed in ex-FeBEA and ex-H-BEA can be connected to the presence of large cavities with relatively small apertures in the BEA framework, especially at the intersection of the channels.
          The rate of deactivation over the MFI catalysts is significantly lower, and can be related to the absence of large cages in this zeolitic structure, since channels and intersections are of similar size.
          The higher deactivation resistance of steam-activated ex-FeZSM-5 in ODHP with N2O is unclear, but can be tentatively related to the different iron constitutions in both catalysts and/or the different porous structure associated with the presence of aluminum in the original zeolite framework.
          Ex-FeZSM-5 contains mesopores due to dealumination upon steam treatment, which are absent in ex-Fe-silicalite.
          The more open structure of FeZSM-5 may reduce pore blocking by coke and also improve transport of reactants and products, slowing down deactivation.
          The activity of ex-FeZSM-5 in direct N2O decomposition is significantly higher than that of ex-Fe-silicalite.
          N2O activation generates atomic oxygen over certain iron species, which is efficiently utilized for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane.
          However, recombination of atomic oxygen and desorption as O2 may lead to reaction with coke at specific locations of the zeolite at the operating temperature, resulting in COx.
          This function would partially regenerate the catalyst surface.
          This hypothesis would imply that highly active Fe-zeolite catalysts in direct N2O decomposition have an increased resistance toward coke deactivation in ODHP with N2O.

Nitrous oxide (N2O) is used as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) due to its ability to achieve higher propene selectivity compared to other oxidants, despite lower propane conversion. This is attributed to the fact that N2O reoxidizes the reduced vanadium species without forming peroxovanadates, which are highly reactive and can lead to the formation of carbon oxides. The use of N2O as an oxidant results in a slower reoxidation process, which allows for a higher selectivity towards propene. However, the catalyst deactivation is a critical challenge in this process, as it is mainly caused by the reduction of vanadium species rather than the formation of carbonaceous deposits. The regeneration of the catalyst by heating under N2O at high temperatures can partly restore its activity, but complete restoration requires reoxidation in the presence of oxygen. To address these limitations and make N2O-ODHP a more feasible option for practical implementation, research directions could focus on developing more stable catalysts that can maintain their activity over longer periods, optimizing the reaction conditions to minimize vanadium reduction, and exploring alternative regeneration methods that can effectively restore the catalyst's activity without the need for high-temperature treatments.

Nitrous oxide (N2O) can improve the selectivity of the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) process by inhibiting the adsorption of O2 and/or increasing the reduction rate of the catalysts. The oxygen produced by the dissociation of N2O can oxidize propane to propene. In the presence of N2O, catalytic sites work in a more reduced state. N2O has been used as a pure oxidant in various reactions, including the oxidative coupling of methane to ethane, the transformation of benzene to phenol, and the oxidation of ethylene to epoxide. The use of N2O in ODHP can potentially lead to higher propylene selectivity compared to other oxidants by controlling the oxidation state of the catalyst and limiting the formation of non-selective oxygen species. Adjusting the concentration of N2O could be a useful strategy to modulate selectivity during the catalytic reaction.

Nitrous oxide (N2O) has been shown to significantly improve propene selectivity in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) compared to molecular oxygen (O2) when used as an oxidant. This improvement has been observed over various catalysts, including steam-activated iron-containing zeolites, bulk vanadium oxides, and supported vanadium-containing materials. A similar effect of N2O has also been reported for the oxidative dehydrogenation of n-butane over vanadium magnesium oxide catalysts. The positive effect of N2O on the ODHP reaction is attributed to the slower reoxidation of reduced VOx species compared to O2, resulting in a lower steady-state concentration of active lattice oxygen sites and thus suppressing the consecutive oxidation of propene to carbon oxides. However, the activity of VOx sites for consecutive propene oxidation increases with rising agglomerization degree. Propene selectivities do not differ much as long as the vanadium surface concentration remains below monolayer coverage, with only isolated VOx sites and small two-dimensional VxOy clusters present. When V2O5 nanocrystallites dominate, there is a dramatic drop in propene selectivity and direct total oxidation of propane occurs with both oxidants, although this detrimental effect is less pronounced in the presence of N2O. A recent study suggested that compared to N2O, other oxygen species (non-lattice oxygen of VOx species) are formed from gas-phase O2 and participate in COx formation. However, there is limited experimental information on the nature of active oxygen species formed from O2 and N2O upon reoxidation of reduced VOx species. The aim of this study is to obtain experimental evidence on the nature and structure of oxygen species formed upon reoxidation of reduced highly dispersed VOx species supported over MCM-41 with O2 and N2O. The same VOx/MCM-41 catalyst used in this work has previously been thoroughly characterized and tested in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane. A turnover frequency of propane conversion of 0.016 molC3H8 mol1 V s1 has been measured with O2 used as an oxidizing agent. In comparison, the respective value with N2O was only half as high, while the propene selectivity was higher, amounting to 80% with N2O but only to 50% with O2 at propane conversion of approximately 10%. Since several of the previously postulated oxygen species were paramagnetic, EPR spectroscopy under controlled atmosphere conditions was applied to experimentally identify oxygen species formed from gaseous N2O and O2 over VOx/MCM-41 and to explore the reactivity of these species towards oxidation of C3H8, C3H6, and CO.

Nitrous oxide (N2O) has been shown to be a superior oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) compared to other oxidants like oxygen (O2). Steam-activated iron zeolites (Fe-zeolites) have demonstrated high initial propene yields of 24% at temperatures between 773 and 798 K, which are comparable to the highest yields reported over vanadium (V) and molybdenum (Mo)-based catalysts using O2. The essential role of N2O in this process is highlighted by the fact that propene production does not occur when propane interacts with iron zeolites in the absence of N2O. The remarkable performance of Fe-zeolites is attributed to the specificity of N2O as a monooxygen donor and the capability of iron forms in the zeolite to coordinate reactive atomic oxygen species for efficient propane dehydrogenation. However, a major drawback is the deactivation by coke, causing a rapid decrease in propene yield. The rate of deactivation varies among the zeolites studied, with Fe-beta deactivating the fastest, followed by Fe-silicalite and FeZSM-5. The deactivation behavior of FeZSM-5 suggests the presence of active iron sites with different sensitivity for coke deactivation. Catalyst deactivation is a complex process that can be caused by a decrease in the number of active sites, a decrease in the quality of active sites, or a decrease in accessibility of the pore space.

N2O is a mono-oxygen donor that can efficiently dehydrogenate propane due to the ability of certain iron species to coordinate reactive atomic oxygen species. This specificity of N2O contributes to the remarkable performance of iron zeolites in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP). However, a major drawback of iron zeolites in ODHP with N2O is the deactivation by coke, which leads to a rapid decrease in propylene yield. The tapered element oscillating microbalance (TEOM) technique coupled with gas chromatography (GC) analysis has been used to correlate deactivation and mass changes due to coking. While TEOM provides detailed and accurate in situ investigation of coke formation, it does not provide information on the deactivation mechanism at the catalyst surface level. To gain a better understanding of the deactivation of iron-containing zeolites in the C3H8 + N2O reaction and the subsequent regeneration in air, complementary spectroscopic studies under reaction conditions are needed. In situ FTIR spectroscopy is suitable for assessing coke deactivation of zeolite catalysts in hydrocarbon conversion by monitoring the formation of carbonaceous deposits and changes in vibrations associated with the surface acidity and framework of the microporous material. Observing the evolution of the working catalyst under true process conditions is useful for an improved understanding of the ODHP reaction. However, in situ investigations of selective oxidation of hydrocarbons with N2O over iron-containing zeolites have not been reported. Moreover, the reusability of the regenerated catalysts has not yet been addressed in detail. Infrared results were complemented by TEOMGC experiments over the catalysts at the same conditions. The degree of catalyst reversibility on reaction and regeneration is evaluated and discussed on the basis of these analyses and characterization of the fresh, coked, and regenerated samples by X-ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and nitrogen adsorption.

Nitrous oxide (N2O) has been identified as a promising oxidant for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) to produce propylene, a key petrochemical feedstock. Compared to traditional oxidants like oxygen, N2O allows for the production of propylene at lower temperatures, which can improve the efficiency and selectivity of the process. The use of N2O as an oxidant in ODHP has been shown to achieve remarkable propylene yields, particularly when iron zeolites are used as catalysts. These catalysts have been found to be effective at lower temperatures than those required for mixed metal oxide catalysts, which typically operate at higher temperatures. However, the performance of iron zeolites can vary significantly depending on the method of iron incorporation and the preparation technique. Steam activation of iron-substituted ZSM-5 zeolites has been shown to result in superior propylene yields compared to other preparation methods. Iron impurities in steamed commercial H-ZSM-5 zeolites have also been found to induce high propylene selectivity, leading to low COx formation. A major challenge in the use of N2O for ODHP is the deactivation of iron zeolite catalysts due to coke formation, which can limit the stability and lifetime of the catalyst. Strategies to address this limitation could include the development of more stable catalyst formulations, optimization of reaction conditions to minimize coke formation, and the use of in situ regeneration techniques to maintain catalyst activity. Research directions that could potentially make N2O-ODHP a more feasible option for practical implementation include the exploration of alternative iron sources and incorporation methods, the design of catalysts with enhanced resistance to deactivation, and the development of integrated process designs that incorporate catalyst regeneration steps.

The use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) presents several advantages, particularly in terms of propylene selectivity compared to other oxidants. N2O, being a strong greenhouse gas, can be effectively utilized in this process, potentially offering environmental benefits. The substitution of N2O for oxygen leads to a significant increase in propylene selectivity across various catalysts, including iron-containing zeolites and vanadium-based catalysts. Iron-based materials, such as Fe-ZSM-5, have been identified as particularly effective in yielding high propylene (C3H6) in ODHP using N2O. Other redox metal catalysts, such as vanadium and molybdenum, have also been explored for this purpose. However, a critical challenge associated with the use of N2O in ODHP is the rapid deactivation of catalysts, primarily due to coke formation. This issue significantly limits the feasibility of N2O as an oxidant compared to softer oxidants like CO2. The quick deactivation of catalysts under N2O conditions necessitates further research to improve catalyst stability and to gain a clearer understanding of the deactivation mechanisms. Addressing these limitations could potentially make N2O-ODHP a more viable option for practical implementation. Strategies to overcome these limitations might include the development of more stable catalyst formulations, the optimization of reaction conditions to minimize coke formation, and the engineering of catalysts with enhanced resistance to deactivation. Additionally, in-depth studies to elucidate the precise mechanisms of deactivation could guide the design of more robust catalysts for N2O-ODHP processes.

Nitrous oxide (N2O) has been shown to modify the catalytic performances of the same catalyst in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODP) reaction. Principally, it decreases the conversion of propane and oxygen, increases the yield and selectivity to propylene, and decreases the yield and selectivity to CO2. In the presence of N2O, catalytic sites work in a more reduced state, leading to a more selective reaction. When the amount of N2O is higher than 300 ppm, oxygen species coming from N2O dissociation could also play a role, suggesting that N2O is also able to induce the ODP, although less oxidant than O2. However, the use of pure N2O to perform the ODP is not advisable as molecular oxygen is necessary to oxidize and regenerate the catalysts in the presence of N2O, otherwise the catalyst deactivates quickly. N2O reduces the catalysts (molybdenum), explaining the high carbon formation. It is the presence of both O2 and N2O (as promoter) that can fully explain the better selectivity of the catalysts in ODP, due to the modulation of their adequate oxidation state during the reaction.

The use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) has several advantages in terms of propylene selectivity compared to other oxidants. N2O's lower ability for catalyst reoxidation leads to an increase in the degree of catalyst reduction, which spatially separates active lattice oxygen in surface VOx species. This separation favors selective oxidation over the formation of COx. Propylene selectivity over V/g-Al2O3 materials can be improved by fully covering the support with well-dispersed VOx species. The selectivity can be further tuned by using N2O as an alternative oxidizing agent. The lower activity of N2O is due to its reduced ability to reoxidize reduced VOx sites, which enhances propene selectivity. This effect is attributed to the less favorable reoxidation of the catalyst by N2O compared to O2. The decrease in the steady-state concentration of active surface lattice oxygen of VOx species favors selective propane oxidation to propene over COx formation, as only one to two lattice oxygen are necessary for the former reaction. Active sites with more than two lattice oxygen species favor the formation of waste products like CO and CO2. The effect of the oxidizing agent on the catalytic performance is also related to the nature of oxygen species originating from O2 and N2O. It has been suggested that atomic oxygen species are responsible for selective oxidation, while polyatomic oxygen species take part in COx formation. However, direct experimental evidence is not available at this stage.

N2O is a highly efficient oxidant for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) over steam-activated FeZSM-5, achieving propene yields up to 25% at 723 K. The remarkable performance of iron zeolites in ODHP is attributed to the specificity of N2O as a monooxygen donor and the capability of iron forms in the zeolite to coordinate reactive atomic oxygen species for efficient dehydrogenation of propane. However, a major drawback is the deactivation by coke formation, leading to a rapid decrease in propene yield. The rate of deactivation is reduced with an increase in temperature, and the relatively slow deactivation of FeZSM-5 at 773 K is associated with high N2O conversion. The use of O2 as an oxidant in ODHP over FeZSM-5 leads to very low C3H6 yields (<5%) compared to N2O. The addition of small amounts of O2 to the C3H8+N2O mixture results in a decrease in C3H6 selectivity and an increase in COx production. The intermediates essential for propene production are negatively impacted by the presence of O2, severely deteriorating the performance of FeZSM-5 in N2O-mediated ODHP of propane. Strategies to address the limitations of catalyst deactivation and stability in N2O-ODHP include optimizing the reaction temperature to reduce deactivation rates, developing catalysts with improved resistance to coke formation, and exploring methods to regenerate the catalysts more efficiently. Research directions could focus on understanding the mechanisms of coke formation and identifying catalysts with active sites that are less susceptible to deactivation. Additionally, the development of cheap and selective catalyst systems for the low-temperature NH3 oxidation to N2O could provide a low-cost and reasonably pure source of N2O, making the process more feasible for practical implementation.

The literature does not provide a direct comparison of N2O as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) with other oxidants in terms of propylene selectivity. However, it does state that N2O is more selective than molecular oxygen in other oxidation reactions. The literature discusses the use of nickel molybdate catalysts in the ODHP process and the effects of adding N2O as a gas dope on the catalytic performance. The addition of N2O modifies the catalytic performances, with a decrease in propane conversion, an increase in propylene yield and selectivity, and a decrease in oxygen consumption and CO2 yield at low concentrations of N2O. At higher concentrations of N2O, the selectivity in propylene decreases, and carbonaceous products are formed. The literature does not address the critical challenges associated with catalyst deactivation and stability in the N2O-ODHP process. However, it does suggest that adjusting the concentration of promoters like N2O could be a useful tool to modulate the oxidation state of oxide catalysts and improve their catalytic performances.

The use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) has gained significant attention as an alternative to dioxygen. The primary advantage of N2O is its ability to produce propylene with higher selectivity compared to dioxygen, which tends to over-oxidize propane, leading to the formation of carbon oxides (CO and CO2) and lower olefin yields. Iron-zeolites, particularly Fe-ZSM-5, have been developed as unique catalysts for this process, with Fe-ZSM-5 exhibiting superior performance for ODHP with N2O after severe calcination. However, catalyst deactivation remains a critical challenge in the ODHP process, regardless of the oxidant used. The presence of propane as a reductant complicates the conversion of nitrous oxide on iron-zeolites, and the deactivation mechanism of catalysts in ODHP with N2O is not fully understood. Strategies to address these limitations could include further research into the deactivation mechanisms, development of more stable catalysts, and optimization of reaction conditions to minimize coke formation and maximize catalyst lifetime. These efforts could potentially make N2O-ODHP a more feasible option for practical implementation.

The use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) has the advantage of increasing propylene selectivity compared to other oxidants. This is because N2O decomposition is less favorable than O2 activation, leading to a decrease in the steady-state concentration of active sites and an increase in propene selectivity. The efficiency of isolated VOx species for selective ODHP is superimposed by non-selective oxidation over the naked surface of the acidic support, which is not covered by active vanadia. To achieve high performance in ODHP, it is desirable to design catalytic surfaces that are fully covered by well-dispersed vanadia species to avoid the strong adsorption of propene on the support surface. The steady-state concentration of active lattice oxygen, which takes part in propane and propene activation, should be optimized to control selective oxidation and combustion reactions. Using N2O instead of O2 can achieve this optimization.

Nitrous oxide (N2O) has been found to be advantageous as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) due to its ability to achieve higher propene selectivity compared to molecular oxygen (O2) at similar degrees of propane conversion. This is attributed to the weaker oxidizing potential of N2O, which inhibits the direct oxidation of propane and the consecutive oxidation of propene to carbon oxides (COx). The use of N2O as an oxidant results in a lower catalytic activity due to its weaker ability to re-oxidize the reduced surface vanadium oxide (VOx) species. However, there is no significant difference in propene selectivity between highly dispersed surface VOx species and crystalline V2O5 nanoparticles when N2O is used as an oxidant. In contrast, crystalline V2O5 nanoparticles are not selective for the ODHP reaction in the presence of O2. The positive effect of N2O on propene selectivity is related to the reduction in surface density (spatial separation) of active surface lattice oxygen in VOx species, as N2O is a weaker oxidant for re-oxidation of reduced VOx species compared to O2. From a stoichiometric point of view, selective propene formation is favored over combustion reactions at lower surface densities.

Nitrous oxide (N2O) has been shown to increase propylene selectivity in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) compared to other oxidants like oxygen (O2). This improvement is attributed to the lower ability of N2O to re-oxidize reduced vanadium oxide (VOx) species, leading to a higher degree of catalyst reduction. The use of N2O can result in up to three times higher propylene selectivity compared to O2, especially when the catalyst contains bulk-like V2O5 species. N2O reduces the tendency for direct propane combustion and consecutive propene oxidation to COx, leading to improved initial propene selectivity. The nature of oxygen species originating from O2 and N2O also plays a role in the selectivity and activity of the catalyst.

Nitrous oxide (N2O) has been shown to increase propene selectivity in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) over alumina- and silica-supported vanadia catalysts compared to O2. However, the ODP activity with N2O is lower than with O2. The degree of reduction of VOx species is suggested to be important for achieving high propene selectivity. The nature of oxygen species, whether adsorbed (nonlattice) or lattice, also influences COx formation. Adsorbed oxygen species are considered nonselective for the ODP reaction over certain catalysts. The redox dynamics of VOx species have been studied using in-situ UV/vis analysis, and the catalytic performance of different VOx/SiO2, VOx/MCM-41, and VOx/MCM-48 materials in the ODP reaction has been characterized. Nitrous oxide (N2O) has been found to be advantageous as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) compared to other oxidants like oxygen (O2). This is due to its ability to achieve higher propylene selectivity. The study of VOx/MCM-41, VOx/SiO2, and VOx/MCM-48 materials has shown that N2O can lead to a higher degree of reduction of vanadium species, which is essential for achieving high primary propylene selectivity and suppressing consecutive propylene oxidation to CO and CO2. The higher polymerized VOx species have a higher activity for consecutive propene oxidation, and the importance of direct propane oxidation and consecutive propene oxidation to COx is significantly higher in the presence of O2 than in N2O. The catalytic performance is determined by the oxidant activation, and N2O's lower oxidizing ability tunes the degree of reduction of vanadium species, leading to a higher reduction degree of VOx species. This effect is related to the spatial separation of active lattice oxygen species, reducing the surface density of active oxygen species. However, the degree of reduction of VOx species is not the only reason for the superior performance of N2O compared to O2. The nature of oxygen species also influences COx formation, with adsorbed (nonlattice) oxygen species being nonselective for the ODP reaction over certain catalytic materials. In contrast, N2O decomposition over reducible metal oxides yields mononuclear oxygen species, which are considered selective. The critical challenges associated with catalyst deactivation and stability in N2O-ODHP include the need for a high degree of reduction of vanadium species and the prevention of nonselective oxygen species formation. Strategies to address these limitations could involve the development of catalysts with controlled surface density of active oxygen species and the optimization of reaction conditions to favor selective oxygen species formation. Research directions could focus on understanding the mechanisms of oxygen species formation and their role in the selectivity of the ODHP process, as well as the development of new catalyst formulations that can maintain high activity and selectivity under N2O-ODHP conditions. Nitrous oxide (N2O) has been shown to have advantages over other oxidants in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP), particularly in terms of propylene selectivity. The use of N2O as an oxidant results in higher propylene selectivity compared to oxygen (O2) over a broad range of propane conversions. This effect is more pronounced for catalysts with microcrystalline V2O5. The improved selectivity is attributed to the ability of N2O to achieve a higher primary propene selectivity and to lower the activity for consecutive propene oxidation. N2O reoxidizes reduced VOx species slower than O2, which is essential for suppressing nonselective consecutive propene oxidation to COx. The nature of oxygen species also plays a role, with N2O not producing nonselective adsorbed oxygen species that can catalyze nonselective consecutive propene oxidation to COx. A variety of catalysts have been employed in the ODHP process, including VOx/SiO2, VOx/MCM-41, and VOx/MCM-48. These catalysts have been characterized using various techniques such as transmission electron microscopy (TEM), temperature-programmed reduction (TPR), UV/vis, Raman, and X-ray diffraction (XRD). The specific surface area of the catalysts decreases with vanadium loading, and the degree of polymerization of VOx species is influenced by the support material. The catalytic activity of the VOx(2.7)/MCM-41 catalyst is slightly higher than that of the VOx(2.8)/SiO2 and VOx(3.4)/MCM-48 samples, possibly due to a lower degree of polymerization of VOx species. The lowest activity was observed over the VOx(11.2)/MCM-41 sample, which possesses microcrystalline V2O5. Catalyst deactivation and stability are critical challenges in the ODHP process. The use of N2O as an oxidant can help mitigate these issues by reducing the formation of nonselective adsorbed oxygen species that can lead to catalyst deactivation. However, the lower activity of N2O compared to O2 can also be a limitation. Strategies to address these challenges include optimizing the catalyst structure and composition to enhance stability and selectivity, developing methods to regenerate deactivated catalysts, and exploring alternative oxidants that can provide high selectivity and activity while maintaining catalyst stability.

Nitrous oxide (N2O) has been used as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) to increase the selectivity to propylene compared to other oxidants. The catalysts employed in this process include a mixture of NiMoO4 and -Sb2O4, and a palladium supported on a mixed Zr-Ce-O oxide catalyst. The addition of N2O in the feed leads to a significant increase in the selectivity to propylene, while the conversion of propane and oxygen and the yield in CO2 decrease. N2O promotes the reduction of molybdenum, which is beneficial for the selectivity of the catalyst. However, the conversion of propane and the yield of CO2 decrease, which may limit the practical application of N2O-ODHP. The challenge of catalyst deactivation and stability is also a critical issue that needs to be addressed. Strategies to improve the stability of the catalysts and reduce the deactivation rate could potentially make N2O-ODHP a more feasible option for practical implementation. For example, the use of more stable catalysts or the development of new catalysts with higher activity and selectivity could be explored. Additionally, the optimization of the reaction conditions, such as temperature, pressure, and feed composition, could also help to improve the stability of the catalysts and reduce the deactivation rate.

Nitrous oxide (N2O) is an efficient oxidant for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) over steam-activated Fe-zeolites (MFI and BEA), achieving initial propylene yields up to 25% at 723 K. However, catalyst deactivation occurs due to coke formation.
          A tapered element oscillating microbalance (TEOM) coupled to GC analysis has been applied to correlate activity and deactivation by simultaneous measurements of reaction and coking.
          Extraframework iron species, generated during steam treatment, are essential for producing active catalysts.
          The nature and distribution of extraframework iron species, the zeolite host, and the catalyst acidity have no significant effect on the initial propene yield, but strongly influence the deactivation behavior.
          FeZSM-5 shows a remarkable resistance against deactivation, while a very rapid and complete deactivation occurred in FeBEA.
          The initial propene yield over FeZSM-5 and FeBEA was remarkably higher than over commercial H-ZSM-5 and H-BEA (with 3040 times lower iron content), although the residual activities after 400 min on stream were very similar.
          Remarkable yields toward propionaldehyde (up to 6%) have been obtained.
          A major drawback of FeMFI zeolites in ODHP with N2O is the deactivation by coke, causing a rapid decrease of the propene yield.
          The TEOM consists of a microreactor with a high-resolution microbalance that generates real-time measurements of mass changes during gas-solid reactions.
          The TEOM presents three main advantages over conventional gravimetric microbalances: a well-defined flow pattern, a very fast response time resolution (0.1 s), and a high mass resolution across the entire range of pressure and temperature.
          Steam activation is essential for achieving high catalytic activities, as concluded from the low conversion of reactants and propene yield obtained over the calcined iron zeolites.
          Extraframework iron species, generated during steam treatment, are responsible for the oxydehydrogenation of propane with nitrous oxide.
          The difference in initial C3H6 yield between ex-FeZSM-5 and ex-Fe-silicalite is marginal if their constitution with respect to iron is taken into account.
          The initial activity of the synthesized Fe-zeolites is significantly higher than over the commercial zeolites, while the former catalysts contain 30 40 times more iron.
          The rapid deactivation observed in ex-FeBEA and ex-H-BEA can be connected to the presence of large cavities with relatively small apertures in the BEA framework, especially at the intersection of the channels.
          The rate of deactivation over the MFI catalysts is significantly lower, and can be related to the absence of large cages in this zeolitic structure, since channels and intersections are of similar size.
          The higher deactivation resistance of steam-activated ex-FeZSM-5 in ODHP with N2O is unclear, but can be tentatively related to the different iron constitutions in both catalysts and/or the different porous structure associated with the presence of aluminum in the original zeolite framework.
          Ex-FeZSM-5 contains mesopores due to dealumination upon steam treatment, which are absent in ex-Fe-silicalite.
          The more open structure of FeZSM-5 may reduce pore blocking by coke and also improve transport of reactants and products, slowing down deactivation.
          The activity of ex-FeZSM-5 in direct N2O decomposition is significantly higher than that of ex-Fe-silicalite.
          N2O activation generates atomic oxygen over certain iron species, which is efficiently utilized for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane.
          However, recombination of atomic oxygen and desorption as O2 may lead to reaction with coke at specific locations of the zeolite at the operating temperature, resulting in COx.
          This function would partially regenerate the catalyst surface.
          This hypothesis would imply that highly active Fe-zeolite catalysts in direct N2O decomposition have an increased resistance toward coke deactivation in ODHP with N2O.

Nitrous oxide (N2O) is used as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) due to its ability to achieve higher propene selectivity compared to other oxidants, despite lower propane conversion. This is attributed to the fact that N2O reoxidizes the reduced vanadium species without forming peroxovanadates, which are highly reactive and can lead to the formation of carbon oxides. The use of N2O as an oxidant results in a slower reoxidation process, which allows for a higher selectivity towards propene. However, the catalyst deactivation is a critical challenge in this process, as it is mainly caused by the reduction of vanadium species rather than the formation of carbonaceous deposits. The regeneration of the catalyst by heating under N2O at high temperatures can partly restore its activity, but complete restoration requires reoxidation in the presence of oxygen. To address these limitations and make N2O-ODHP a more feasible option for practical implementation, research directions could focus on developing more stable catalysts that can maintain their activity over longer periods, optimizing the reaction conditions to minimize vanadium reduction, and exploring alternative regeneration methods that can effectively restore the catalyst's activity without the need for high-temperature treatments.

Nitrous oxide (N2O) can improve the selectivity of the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) process by inhibiting the adsorption of O2 and/or increasing the reduction rate of the catalysts. The oxygen produced by the dissociation of N2O can oxidize propane to propene. In the presence of N2O, catalytic sites work in a more reduced state. N2O has been used as a pure oxidant in various reactions, including the oxidative coupling of methane to ethane, the transformation of benzene to phenol, and the oxidation of ethylene to epoxide. The use of N2O in ODHP can potentially lead to higher propylene selectivity compared to other oxidants by controlling the oxidation state of the catalyst and limiting the formation of non-selective oxygen species. Adjusting the concentration of N2O could be a useful strategy to modulate selectivity during the catalytic reaction.

Nitrous oxide (N2O) has been shown to significantly improve propene selectivity in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) compared to molecular oxygen (O2) when used as an oxidant. This improvement has been observed over various catalysts, including steam-activated iron-containing zeolites, bulk vanadium oxides, and supported vanadium-containing materials. A similar effect of N2O has also been reported for the oxidative dehydrogenation of n-butane over vanadium magnesium oxide catalysts. The positive effect of N2O on the ODHP reaction is attributed to the slower reoxidation of reduced VOx species compared to O2, resulting in a lower steady-state concentration of active lattice oxygen sites and thus suppressing the consecutive oxidation of propene to carbon oxides. However, the activity of VOx sites for consecutive propene oxidation increases with rising agglomerization degree. Propene selectivities do not differ much as long as the vanadium surface concentration remains below monolayer coverage, with only isolated VOx sites and small two-dimensional VxOy clusters present. When V2O5 nanocrystallites dominate, there is a dramatic drop in propene selectivity and direct total oxidation of propane occurs with both oxidants, although this detrimental effect is less pronounced in the presence of N2O. A recent study suggested that compared to N2O, other oxygen species (non-lattice oxygen of VOx species) are formed from gas-phase O2 and participate in COx formation. However, there is limited experimental information on the nature of active oxygen species formed from O2 and N2O upon reoxidation of reduced VOx species. The aim of this study is to obtain experimental evidence on the nature and structure of oxygen species formed upon reoxidation of reduced highly dispersed VOx species supported over MCM-41 with O2 and N2O. The same VOx/MCM-41 catalyst used in this work has previously been thoroughly characterized and tested in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane. A turnover frequency of propane conversion of 0.016 molC3H8 mol1 V s1 has been measured with O2 used as an oxidizing agent. In comparison, the respective value with N2O was only half as high, while the propene selectivity was higher, amounting to 80% with N2O but only to 50% with O2 at propane conversion of approximately 10%. Since several of the previously postulated oxygen species were paramagnetic, EPR spectroscopy under controlled atmosphere conditions was applied to experimentally identify oxygen species formed from gaseous N2O and O2 over VOx/MCM-41 and to explore the reactivity of these species towards oxidation of C3H8, C3H6, and CO.

Nitrous oxide (N2O) has been shown to be a superior oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) compared to other oxidants like oxygen (O2). Steam-activated iron zeolites (Fe-zeolites) have demonstrated high initial propene yields of 24% at temperatures between 773 and 798 K, which are comparable to the highest yields reported over vanadium (V) and molybdenum (Mo)-based catalysts using O2. The essential role of N2O in this process is highlighted by the fact that propene production does not occur when propane interacts with iron zeolites in the absence of N2O. The remarkable performance of Fe-zeolites is attributed to the specificity of N2O as a monooxygen donor and the capability of iron forms in the zeolite to coordinate reactive atomic oxygen species for efficient propane dehydrogenation. However, a major drawback is the deactivation by coke, causing a rapid decrease in propene yield. The rate of deactivation varies among the zeolites studied, with Fe-beta deactivating the fastest, followed by Fe-silicalite and FeZSM-5. The deactivation behavior of FeZSM-5 suggests the presence of active iron sites with different sensitivity for coke deactivation. Catalyst deactivation is a complex process that can be caused by a decrease in the number of active sites, a decrease in the quality of active sites, or a decrease in accessibility of the pore space.

N2O is a mono-oxygen donor that can efficiently dehydrogenate propane due to the ability of certain iron species to coordinate reactive atomic oxygen species. This specificity of N2O contributes to the remarkable performance of iron zeolites in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP). However, a major drawback of iron zeolites in ODHP with N2O is the deactivation by coke, which leads to a rapid decrease in propylene yield. The tapered element oscillating microbalance (TEOM) technique coupled with gas chromatography (GC) analysis has been used to correlate deactivation and mass changes due to coking. While TEOM provides detailed and accurate in situ investigation of coke formation, it does not provide information on the deactivation mechanism at the catalyst surface level. To gain a better understanding of the deactivation of iron-containing zeolites in the C3H8 + N2O reaction and the subsequent regeneration in air, complementary spectroscopic studies under reaction conditions are needed. In situ FTIR spectroscopy is suitable for assessing coke deactivation of zeolite catalysts in hydrocarbon conversion by monitoring the formation of carbonaceous deposits and changes in vibrations associated with the surface acidity and framework of the microporous material. Observing the evolution of the working catalyst under true process conditions is useful for an improved understanding of the ODHP reaction. However, in situ investigations of selective oxidation of hydrocarbons with N2O over iron-containing zeolites have not been reported. Moreover, the reusability of the regenerated catalysts has not yet been addressed in detail. Infrared results were complemented by TEOMGC experiments over the catalysts at the same conditions. The degree of catalyst reversibility on reaction and regeneration is evaluated and discussed on the basis of these analyses and characterization of the fresh, coked, and regenerated samples by X-ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and nitrogen adsorption.

Nitrous oxide (N2O) has been identified as a promising oxidant for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) to produce propylene, a key petrochemical feedstock. Compared to traditional oxidants like oxygen, N2O allows for the production of propylene at lower temperatures, which can improve the efficiency and selectivity of the process. The use of N2O as an oxidant in ODHP has been shown to achieve remarkable propylene yields, particularly when iron zeolites are used as catalysts. These catalysts have been found to be effective at lower temperatures than those required for mixed metal oxide catalysts, which typically operate at higher temperatures. However, the performance of iron zeolites can vary significantly depending on the method of iron incorporation and the preparation technique. Steam activation of iron-substituted ZSM-5 zeolites has been shown to result in superior propylene yields compared to other preparation methods. Iron impurities in steamed commercial H-ZSM-5 zeolites have also been found to induce high propylene selectivity, leading to low COx formation. A major challenge in the use of N2O for ODHP is the deactivation of iron zeolite catalysts due to coke formation, which can limit the stability and lifetime of the catalyst. Strategies to address this limitation could include the development of more stable catalyst formulations, optimization of reaction conditions to minimize coke formation, and the use of in situ regeneration techniques to maintain catalyst activity. Research directions that could potentially make N2O-ODHP a more feasible option for practical implementation include the exploration of alternative iron sources and incorporation methods, the design of catalysts with enhanced resistance to deactivation, and the development of integrated process designs that incorporate catalyst regeneration steps.

The use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) presents several advantages, particularly in terms of propylene selectivity compared to other oxidants. N2O, being a strong greenhouse gas, can be effectively utilized in this process, potentially offering environmental benefits. The substitution of N2O for oxygen leads to a significant increase in propylene selectivity across various catalysts, including iron-containing zeolites and vanadium-based catalysts. Iron-based materials, such as Fe-ZSM-5, have been identified as particularly effective in yielding high propylene (C3H6) in ODHP using N2O. Other redox metal catalysts, such as vanadium and molybdenum, have also been explored for this purpose. However, a critical challenge associated with the use of N2O in ODHP is the rapid deactivation of catalysts, primarily due to coke formation. This issue significantly limits the feasibility of N2O as an oxidant compared to softer oxidants like CO2. The quick deactivation of catalysts under N2O conditions necessitates further research to improve catalyst stability and to gain a clearer understanding of the deactivation mechanisms. Addressing these limitations could potentially make N2O-ODHP a more viable option for practical implementation. Strategies to overcome these limitations might include the development of more stable catalyst formulations, the optimization of reaction conditions to minimize coke formation, and the engineering of catalysts with enhanced resistance to deactivation. Additionally, in-depth studies to elucidate the precise mechanisms of deactivation could guide the design of more robust catalysts for N2O-ODHP processes.

Nitrous oxide (N2O) has been shown to modify the catalytic performances of the same catalyst in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODP) reaction. Principally, it decreases the conversion of propane and oxygen, increases the yield and selectivity to propylene, and decreases the yield and selectivity to CO2. In the presence of N2O, catalytic sites work in a more reduced state, leading to a more selective reaction. When the amount of N2O is higher than 300 ppm, oxygen species coming from N2O dissociation could also play a role, suggesting that N2O is also able to induce the ODP, although less oxidant than O2. However, the use of pure N2O to perform the ODP is not advisable as molecular oxygen is necessary to oxidize and regenerate the catalysts in the presence of N2O, otherwise the catalyst deactivates quickly. N2O reduces the catalysts (molybdenum), explaining the high carbon formation. It is the presence of both O2 and N2O (as promoter) that can fully explain the better selectivity of the catalysts in ODP, due to the modulation of their adequate oxidation state during the reaction.

The use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) has several advantages in terms of propylene selectivity compared to other oxidants. N2O's lower ability for catalyst reoxidation leads to an increase in the degree of catalyst reduction, which spatially separates active lattice oxygen in surface VOx species. This separation favors selective oxidation over the formation of COx. Propylene selectivity over V/g-Al2O3 materials can be improved by fully covering the support with well-dispersed VOx species. The selectivity can be further tuned by using N2O as an alternative oxidizing agent. The lower activity of N2O is due to its reduced ability to reoxidize reduced VOx sites, which enhances propene selectivity. This effect is attributed to the less favorable reoxidation of the catalyst by N2O compared to O2. The decrease in the steady-state concentration of active surface lattice oxygen of VOx species favors selective propane oxidation to propene over COx formation, as only one to two lattice oxygen are necessary for the former reaction. Active sites with more than two lattice oxygen species favor the formation of waste products like CO and CO2. The effect of the oxidizing agent on the catalytic performance is also related to the nature of oxygen species originating from O2 and N2O. It has been suggested that atomic oxygen species are responsible for selective oxidation, while polyatomic oxygen species take part in COx formation. However, direct experimental evidence is not available at this stage.

N2O is a highly efficient oxidant for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) over steam-activated FeZSM-5, achieving propene yields up to 25% at 723 K. The remarkable performance of iron zeolites in ODHP is attributed to the specificity of N2O as a monooxygen donor and the capability of iron forms in the zeolite to coordinate reactive atomic oxygen species for efficient dehydrogenation of propane. However, a major drawback is the deactivation by coke formation, leading to a rapid decrease in propene yield. The rate of deactivation is reduced with an increase in temperature, and the relatively slow deactivation of FeZSM-5 at 773 K is associated with high N2O conversion. The use of O2 as an oxidant in ODHP over FeZSM-5 leads to very low C3H6 yields (<5%) compared to N2O. The addition of small amounts of O2 to the C3H8+N2O mixture results in a decrease in C3H6 selectivity and an increase in COx production. The intermediates essential for propene production are negatively impacted by the presence of O2, severely deteriorating the performance of FeZSM-5 in N2O-mediated ODHP of propane. Strategies to address the limitations of catalyst deactivation and stability in N2O-ODHP include optimizing the reaction temperature to reduce deactivation rates, developing catalysts with improved resistance to coke formation, and exploring methods to regenerate the catalysts more efficiently. Research directions could focus on understanding the mechanisms of coke formation and identifying catalysts with active sites that are less susceptible to deactivation. Additionally, the development of cheap and selective catalyst systems for the low-temperature NH3 oxidation to N2O could provide a low-cost and reasonably pure source of N2O, making the process more feasible for practical implementation.

The literature does not provide a direct comparison of N2O as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) with other oxidants in terms of propylene selectivity. However, it does state that N2O is more selective than molecular oxygen in other oxidation reactions. The literature discusses the use of nickel molybdate catalysts in the ODHP process and the effects of adding N2O as a gas dope on the catalytic performance. The addition of N2O modifies the catalytic performances, with a decrease in propane conversion, an increase in propylene yield and selectivity, and a decrease in oxygen consumption and CO2 yield at low concentrations of N2O. At higher concentrations of N2O, the selectivity in propylene decreases, and carbonaceous products are formed. The literature does not address the critical challenges associated with catalyst deactivation and stability in the N2O-ODHP process. However, it does suggest that adjusting the concentration of promoters like N2O could be a useful tool to modulate the oxidation state of oxide catalysts and improve their catalytic performances.

The use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) has gained significant attention as an alternative to dioxygen. The primary advantage of N2O is its ability to produce propylene with higher selectivity compared to dioxygen, which tends to over-oxidize propane, leading to the formation of carbon oxides (CO and CO2) and lower olefin yields. Iron-zeolites, particularly Fe-ZSM-5, have been developed as unique catalysts for this process, with Fe-ZSM-5 exhibiting superior performance for ODHP with N2O after severe calcination. However, catalyst deactivation remains a critical challenge in the ODHP process, regardless of the oxidant used. The presence of propane as a reductant complicates the conversion of nitrous oxide on iron-zeolites, and the deactivation mechanism of catalysts in ODHP with N2O is not fully understood. Strategies to address these limitations could include further research into the deactivation mechanisms, development of more stable catalysts, and optimization of reaction conditions to minimize coke formation and maximize catalyst lifetime. These efforts could potentially make N2O-ODHP a more feasible option for practical implementation.

The use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) has the advantage of increasing propylene selectivity compared to other oxidants. This is because N2O decomposition is less favorable than O2 activation, leading to a decrease in the steady-state concentration of active sites and an increase in propene selectivity. The efficiency of isolated VOx species for selective ODHP is superimposed by non-selective oxidation over the naked surface of the acidic support, which is not covered by active vanadia. To achieve high performance in ODHP, it is desirable to design catalytic surfaces that are fully covered by well-dispersed vanadia species to avoid the strong adsorption of propene on the support surface. The steady-state concentration of active lattice oxygen, which takes part in propane and propene activation, should be optimized to control selective oxidation and combustion reactions. Using N2O instead of O2 can achieve this optimization.

Nitrous oxide (N2O) has been found to be advantageous as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) due to its ability to achieve higher propene selectivity compared to molecular oxygen (O2) at similar degrees of propane conversion. This is attributed to the weaker oxidizing potential of N2O, which inhibits the direct oxidation of propane and the consecutive oxidation of propene to carbon oxides (COx). The use of N2O as an oxidant results in a lower catalytic activity due to its weaker ability to re-oxidize the reduced surface vanadium oxide (VOx) species. However, there is no significant difference in propene selectivity between highly dispersed surface VOx species and crystalline V2O5 nanoparticles when N2O is used as an oxidant. In contrast, crystalline V2O5 nanoparticles are not selective for the ODHP reaction in the presence of O2. The positive effect of N2O on propene selectivity is related to the reduction in surface density (spatial separation) of active surface lattice oxygen in VOx species, as N2O is a weaker oxidant for re-oxidation of reduced VOx species compared to O2. From a stoichiometric point of view, selective propene formation is favored over combustion reactions at lower surface densities.

Nitrous oxide (N2O) has been shown to increase propylene selectivity in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) compared to other oxidants like oxygen (O2). This improvement is attributed to the lower ability of N2O to re-oxidize reduced vanadium oxide (VOx) species, leading to a higher degree of catalyst reduction. The use of N2O can result in up to three times higher propylene selectivity compared to O2, especially when the catalyst contains bulk-like V2O5 species. N2O reduces the tendency for direct propane combustion and consecutive propene oxidation to COx, leading to improved initial propene selectivity. The nature of oxygen species originating from O2 and N2O also plays a role in the selectivity and activity of the catalyst.

Nitrous oxide (N2O) has been shown to increase propene selectivity in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) over alumina- and silica-supported vanadia catalysts compared to O2. However, the ODP activity with N2O is lower than with O2. The degree of reduction of VOx species is suggested to be important for achieving high propene selectivity. The nature of oxygen species, whether adsorbed (nonlattice) or lattice, also influences COx formation. Adsorbed oxygen species are considered nonselective for the ODP reaction over certain catalysts. The redox dynamics of VOx species have been studied using in-situ UV/vis analysis, and the catalytic performance of different VOx/SiO2, VOx/MCM-41, and VOx/MCM-48 materials in the ODP reaction has been characterized. Nitrous oxide (N2O) has been found to be advantageous as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) compared to other oxidants like oxygen (O2). This is due to its ability to achieve higher propylene selectivity. The study of VOx/MCM-41, VOx/SiO2, and VOx/MCM-48 materials has shown that N2O can lead to a higher degree of reduction of vanadium species, which is essential for achieving high primary propylene selectivity and suppressing consecutive propylene oxidation to CO and CO2. The higher polymerized VOx species have a higher activity for consecutive propene oxidation, and the importance of direct propane oxidation and consecutive propene oxidation to COx is significantly higher in the presence of O2 than in N2O. The catalytic performance is determined by the oxidant activation, and N2O's lower oxidizing ability tunes the degree of reduction of vanadium species, leading to a higher reduction degree of VOx species. This effect is related to the spatial separation of active lattice oxygen species, reducing the surface density of active oxygen species. However, the degree of reduction of VOx species is not the only reason for the superior performance of N2O compared to O2. The nature of oxygen species also influences COx formation, with adsorbed (nonlattice) oxygen species being nonselective for the ODP reaction over certain catalytic materials. In contrast, N2O decomposition over reducible metal oxides yields mononuclear oxygen species, which are considered selective. The critical challenges associated with catalyst deactivation and stability in N2O-ODHP include the need for a high degree of reduction of vanadium species and the prevention of nonselective oxygen species formation. Strategies to address these limitations could involve the development of catalysts with controlled surface density of active oxygen species and the optimization of reaction conditions to favor selective oxygen species formation. Research directions could focus on understanding the mechanisms of oxygen species formation and their role in the selectivity of the ODHP process, as well as the development of new catalyst formulations that can maintain high activity and selectivity under N2O-ODHP conditions. Nitrous oxide (N2O) has been shown to have advantages over other oxidants in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP), particularly in terms of propylene selectivity. The use of N2O as an oxidant results in higher propylene selectivity compared to oxygen (O2) over a broad range of propane conversions. This effect is more pronounced for catalysts with microcrystalline V2O5. The improved selectivity is attributed to the ability of N2O to achieve a higher primary propene selectivity and to lower the activity for consecutive propene oxidation. N2O reoxidizes reduced VOx species slower than O2, which is essential for suppressing nonselective consecutive propene oxidation to COx. The nature of oxygen species also plays a role, with N2O not producing nonselective adsorbed oxygen species that can catalyze nonselective consecutive propene oxidation to COx. A variety of catalysts have been employed in the ODHP process, including VOx/SiO2, VOx/MCM-41, and VOx/MCM-48. These catalysts have been characterized using various techniques such as transmission electron microscopy (TEM), temperature-programmed reduction (TPR), UV/vis, Raman, and X-ray diffraction (XRD). The specific surface area of the catalysts decreases with vanadium loading, and the degree of polymerization of VOx species is influenced by the support material. The catalytic activity of the VOx(2.7)/MCM-41 catalyst is slightly higher than that of the VOx(2.8)/SiO2 and VOx(3.4)/MCM-48 samples, possibly due to a lower degree of polymerization of VOx species. The lowest activity was observed over the VOx(11.2)/MCM-41 sample, which possesses microcrystalline V2O5. Catalyst deactivation and stability are critical challenges in the ODHP process. The use of N2O as an oxidant can help mitigate these issues by reducing the formation of nonselective adsorbed oxygen species that can lead to catalyst deactivation. However, the lower activity of N2O compared to O2 can also be a limitation. Strategies to address these challenges include optimizing the catalyst structure and composition to enhance stability and selectivity, developing methods to regenerate deactivated catalysts, and exploring alternative oxidants that can provide high selectivity and activity while maintaining catalyst stability.

Nitrous oxide (N2O) has been used as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) to increase the selectivity to propylene compared to other oxidants. The catalysts employed in this process include a mixture of NiMoO4 and -Sb2O4, and a palladium supported on a mixed Zr-Ce-O oxide catalyst. The addition of N2O in the feed leads to a significant increase in the selectivity to propylene, while the conversion of propane and oxygen and the yield in CO2 decrease. N2O promotes the reduction of molybdenum, which is beneficial for the selectivity of the catalyst. However, the conversion of propane and the yield of CO2 decrease, which may limit the practical application of N2O-ODHP. The challenge of catalyst deactivation and stability is also a critical issue that needs to be addressed. Strategies to improve the stability of the catalysts and reduce the deactivation rate could potentially make N2O-ODHP a more feasible option for practical implementation. For example, the use of more stable catalysts or the development of new catalysts with higher activity and selectivity could be explored. Additionally, the optimization of the reaction conditions, such as temperature, pressure, and feed composition, could also help to improve the stability of the catalysts and reduce the deactivation rate.

Nitrous oxide (N2O) is an efficient oxidant for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) over steam-activated Fe-zeolites (MFI and BEA), achieving initial propylene yields up to 25% at 723 K. However, catalyst deactivation occurs due to coke formation.
          A tapered element oscillating microbalance (TEOM) coupled to GC analysis has been applied to correlate activity and deactivation by simultaneous measurements of reaction and coking.
          Extraframework iron species, generated during steam treatment, are essential for producing active catalysts.
          The nature and distribution of extraframework iron species, the zeolite host, and the catalyst acidity have no significant effect on the initial propene yield, but strongly influence the deactivation behavior.
          FeZSM-5 shows a remarkable resistance against deactivation, while a very rapid and complete deactivation occurred in FeBEA.
          The initial propene yield over FeZSM-5 and FeBEA was remarkably higher than over commercial H-ZSM-5 and H-BEA (with 3040 times lower iron content), although the residual activities after 400 min on stream were very similar.
          Remarkable yields toward propionaldehyde (up to 6%) have been obtained.
          A major drawback of FeMFI zeolites in ODHP with N2O is the deactivation by coke, causing a rapid decrease of the propene yield.
          The TEOM consists of a microreactor with a high-resolution microbalance that generates real-time measurements of mass changes during gas-solid reactions.
          The TEOM presents three main advantages over conventional gravimetric microbalances: a well-defined flow pattern, a very fast response time resolution (0.1 s), and a high mass resolution across the entire range of pressure and temperature.
          Steam activation is essential for achieving high catalytic activities, as concluded from the low conversion of reactants and propene yield obtained over the calcined iron zeolites.
          Extraframework iron species, generated during steam treatment, are responsible for the oxydehydrogenation of propane with nitrous oxide.
          The difference in initial C3H6 yield between ex-FeZSM-5 and ex-Fe-silicalite is marginal if their constitution with respect to iron is taken into account.
          The initial activity of the synthesized Fe-zeolites is significantly higher than over the commercial zeolites, while the former catalysts contain 30 40 times more iron.
          The rapid deactivation observed in ex-FeBEA and ex-H-BEA can be connected to the presence of large cavities with relatively small apertures in the BEA framework, especially at the intersection of the channels.
          The rate of deactivation over the MFI catalysts is significantly lower, and can be related to the absence of large cages in this zeolitic structure, since channels and intersections are of similar size.
          The higher deactivation resistance of steam-activated ex-FeZSM-5 in ODHP with N2O is unclear, but can be tentatively related to the different iron constitutions in both catalysts and/or the different porous structure associated with the presence of aluminum in the original zeolite framework.
          Ex-FeZSM-5 contains mesopores due to dealumination upon steam treatment, which are absent in ex-Fe-silicalite.
          The more open structure of FeZSM-5 may reduce pore blocking by coke and also improve transport of reactants and products, slowing down deactivation.
          The activity of ex-FeZSM-5 in direct N2O decomposition is significantly higher than that of ex-Fe-silicalite.
          N2O activation generates atomic oxygen over certain iron species, which is efficiently utilized for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane.
          However, recombination of atomic oxygen and desorption as O2 may lead to reaction with coke at specific locations of the zeolite at the operating temperature, resulting in COx.
          This function would partially regenerate the catalyst surface.
          This hypothesis would imply that highly active Fe-zeolite catalysts in direct N2O decomposition have an increased resistance toward coke deactivation in ODHP with N2O.

Nitrous oxide (N2O) is used as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) due to its ability to achieve higher propene selectivity compared to other oxidants, despite lower propane conversion. This is attributed to the fact that N2O reoxidizes the reduced vanadium species without forming peroxovanadates, which are highly reactive and can lead to the formation of carbon oxides. The use of N2O as an oxidant results in a slower reoxidation process, which allows for a higher selectivity towards propene. However, the catalyst deactivation is a critical challenge in this process, as it is mainly caused by the reduction of vanadium species rather than the formation of carbonaceous deposits. The regeneration of the catalyst by heating under N2O at high temperatures can partly restore its activity, but complete restoration requires reoxidation in the presence of oxygen. To address these limitations and make N2O-ODHP a more feasible option for practical implementation, research directions could focus on developing more stable catalysts that can maintain their activity over longer periods, optimizing the reaction conditions to minimize vanadium reduction, and exploring alternative regeneration methods that can effectively restore the catalyst's activity without the need for high-temperature treatments.
