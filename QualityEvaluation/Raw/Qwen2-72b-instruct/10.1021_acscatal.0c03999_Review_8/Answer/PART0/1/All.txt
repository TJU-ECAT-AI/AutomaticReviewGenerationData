This improvement has been observed over various catalysts, including steam-activated iron-containing zeolites, bulk vanadium oxides, and supported vanadium-containing materials. A similar effect of N2O has also been reported for the oxidative dehydrogenation of n-butane over vanadium magnesium oxide catalysts. The positive effect of N2O on the ODHP reaction is attributed to the slower reoxidation of reduced VOx species compared to O2, resulting in a lower steady-state concentration of active lattice oxygen sites and thus suppressing the consecutive oxidation of propene to carbon oxides. However, the activity of VOx sites for consecutive propene oxidation increases with rising agglomerization degree. Propene selectivities do not differ much as long as the vanadium surface concentration remains below monolayer coverage, with only isolated VOx sites and small two-dimensional VxOy clusters present. When V2O5 nanocrystallites dominate, there is a dramatic drop in propene selectivity and direct total oxidation of propane occurs with both oxidants, although this detrimental effect is less pronounced in the presence of N2O. A recent study suggested that compared to N2O, other oxygen species (non-lattice oxygen of VOx species) are formed from gas-phase O2 and participate in COx formation.

In comparison, the respective value with N2O was only half as high, while the propene selectivity was higher, amounting to 80% with N2O but only to 50% with O2 at propane conversion of approximately 10%. Since several of the previously postulated oxygen species were paramagnetic, EPR spectroscopy under controlled atmosphere conditions was applied to experimentally identify oxygen species formed from gaseous N2O and O2 over VOx/MCM-41 and to explore the reactivity of these species towards oxidation of C3H8, C3H6, and CO.", "Chinese": "一氧化二氮(N2O)作为氧化剂在丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)中使用时,与氧气(O2)相比,显著提高了丙烯选择性。这种改善在各种催化剂上都有观察到,包括蒸汽活化铁含沸石、块状钒氧化物和含钒支撑材料。N2O对n-丁烷氧化脱氢的类似效果也已在钒镁氧化物催化剂上报道。N2O对ODHP反应的积极作用归因于与O2相比,VOx物种的还原态的再氧化速率较慢,导致活性晶格氧位点的稳态浓度较低,从而抑制了丙烯向二氧化碳的连续氧化。然而,VOx位点对连续丙烯氧化的活性随着聚集度的增加而增加。只要钒表面浓度保持在单层覆盖以下,丙烯选择性差异不大,只有孤立的VOx位点和小的二维VxOy簇存在。当V2O5纳米晶占主导时,不仅丙烯选择性急剧下降,而且在两种氧化剂存在下,丙烷的直接完全氧化都会发生,尽管在N2O存在下,这种不利影响不那么明显。最近的一项研究指出,与N2O相比,从气相O2中形成的其他氧物种(VOx物种的非晶格氧)参与了COx的形成。然而,关于从O2和N2O还原VOx物种时形成的活性氧物种的性质,只有有限的实验信息。本研究的目的是获得实验证据,证明在O2和N2O存在下,在MCM-41上还原的高分散VOx物种的性质和结构。本研究中使用的VOx/MCM-41催化剂以前已在丙烷氧化脱氢中进行了彻底的表征和测试。使用O2作为氧化剂时,测得的丙烷转化率的周转频率为0.016 molC3H8 mol1 V s1。相比之下,N2O的相应值仅为一半,而丙烯选择性更高,在丙烷转化率约为10%时,丙烯选择性为80%,而O2仅为50%。由于以前假设的几种氧物种具有顺磁性,因此在受控气氛条件下应用了EPR光谱,以实验上识别从气相N2O和O2在VOx/MCM-41上形成的氧物种,并探索这些物种对C3H8、C3H6和CO氧化的反应性。", "Doi": "10.1016/j.jcat.2010.06.010"},

From the results in Fig. 2(a) it is clear that propene selectivity decreases with an increase in the degree of propane conversion stronger with O2 than with N2O. For an O2- containing reaction feed, C3H6 selectivity decreases from 77 to 15% upon increasing C3H8 conversion from 0.6 to 9%. For similar changes in the degree of C3H8 conversion in the presence of N2O, C3H6 selectivity drops only from 86 to 60%.\"\n          [8] \"The reaction pathways of CO and CO2 formation are also influenced by the nature of oxidizing agent.

It increases from 15 to 20% upon increasing C3H8 conversion from 0.6 to 9%. About 13% CO2 selectivity is expected upon extrapolation to a zero degree of propane conversion. Based on this observation and taking into account the small change of CO2 selectivity with varying degree of propane conversion in Fig. 2(b), it is concluded that carbon dioxide is mainly formed via direct propane combustion but not via consecutive propene oxidation. The latter reaction contributes to the total CO2 production only at high degrees of propane conversion. When O2 is replaced by N2O, CO2 selectivity decreases in the studied range of propane conversions (Fig. 2(b)). The decrease in CO2 selectivity is explained by a reduced tendency towards direct propane combustion. This conclusion is based on the fact, that a near-to-zero CO2 selectivity is expected for a zero degree of propane conversion in the presence of N2O (Fig. 2(b)). Upon increasing C3H8 conversion, CO2 selectivity increases, hence, CO2 is mainly formed via consecutive C3H6 oxidation when N2O is used as oxidizing agent.\"\n          [9] \"The selectivityconversion plot in Fig. 2(c) evidences that CO formation is stronger influenced by the degree of C3H8 conversion than CO2 formation. CO selectivity is very low (<5%) at zero C3H8 conversion but strongly increases with C3H8 conversion for both oxidants (N2O and O2). The obtained relationship indicates the secondary nature of CO formation,i.e. CO is formed via consecutive C3H6 oxidation. From Fig. 2(c) it is concluded that CO formation with O2 is stronger influenced by the degree of C3H8 conversion as compared to the tests with N2O. For an O2-containing feed, a relative difference in CO selectivity is 60% upon increasing C3H8 conversion from 0.6 to 9%, while the respective differencewith N2O is 20%.\"\n          [10] \"Summarizing the above discussion, it is concluded that catalytic performance and general scheme of the ODP reaction are determined by the applied oxidizing agent (O2 and N2O),but not by the initial composition of individual vanadium oxides.\"\n          [11] \"The results of steady-state ODP studies in Fig. 2 suggest a complex reaction scheme of parallel and consecutive steps for the ODP reaction using either O2 or N2O.

The difference between O2- and N2O-containing ODP feeds in the catalytic performance of vanadium oxides (Fig. 2, Table 4) may be partially related to the nature of active oxygen species originating from O2. To support this assumption, we performed transient experiments with isotopically labeled 18O2 using a SSITKA (steady-state isotopic transient kinetic analysis) technique.

oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) over alumina- and silica-supported vanadia catalysts compared to O2. However, the ODP activity with N2O is lower than with O2. The degree of reduction of VOx species is suggested to be important for achieving high propene selectivity. The nature of oxygen species, whether adsorbed (nonlattice) or lattice, also influences COx formation. Adsorbed oxygen species are considered nonselective for the ODP reaction over certain catalysts. The redox dynamics of VOx species have been studied using in-situ UV/vis analysis, and the catalytic performance of different VOx/SiO2, VOx/MCM-41, and VOx/MCM-48 materials in the ODP reaction has been characterized. Nitrous oxide (N2O) has been found to be advantageous as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) compared to other oxidants like oxygen (O2). This is due to its ability to achieve higher propylene selectivity. The study of VOx/MCM-41, VOx/SiO2, and VOx/MCM-48 materials has shown that N2O can lead to a higher degree of reduction of vanadium species, which is essential for achieving high primary propylene selectivity and suppressing consecutive propylene oxidation to CO and CO2. The higher polymerized VOx species have a higher activity for consecutive propene oxidation, and the importance of direct propane oxidation and consecutive propene oxidation to COx is significantly higher in the presence of O2 than in N2O. The catalytic performance is determined by the oxidant activation, and N2O's lower oxidizing ability tunes the degree of reduction of vanadium species, leading to a higher reduction degree of VOx species. This effect is related to the spatial separation of active lattice oxygen species, reducing the surface density of active oxygen species. However, the degree of reduction of VOx species is not the only reason for the superior performance of N2O compared to O2. The nature of oxygen species also influences COx formation, with adsorbed (nonlattice) oxygen species being nonselective for the ODP reaction over certain catalytic materials. In contrast, N2O decomposition over reducible metal oxides yields mononuclear oxygen species, which are considered selective. The critical challenges associated with catalyst deactivation and stability in N2O-ODHP include the need for a high degree of reduction of vanadium species and the prevention of nonselective oxygen species formation. Strategies to address these limitations could involve the development of catalysts with controlled surface density of active oxygen species and the optimization of reaction conditions to favor selective oxygen species formation. Research directions could focus on understanding the mechanisms of oxygen species formation and their role in the selectivity of the ODHP process, as well as the development of new catalyst formulations that can maintain high activity and selectivity under N2O-ODHP conditions. Nitrous oxide (N2O) has been shown to have advantages over other oxidants in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP), particularly in terms of propylene selectivity. The use of N2O as an oxidant results in higher propylene selectivity compared to oxygen (O2) over a broad range of propane conversions. This effect is more pronounced for catalysts with microcrystalline V2O5. The improved selectivity is attributed to the ability of N2O to achieve a higher primary propene selectivity and to lower the activity for consecutive propene oxidation. N2O reoxidizes reduced VOx species slower than O2, which is essential for suppressing nonselective consecutive propene oxidation to COx. The nature of oxygen species also plays a role, with N2O not producing nonselective adsorbed oxygen species that can catalyze nonselective consecutive propene oxidation to COx. A variety of catalysts have been employed in the ODHP process, including VOx/SiO2, VOx/MCM-41, and VOx/MCM-48. These catalysts have been characterized using various techniques such as transmission electron microscopy (TEM), temperature-programmed reduction (TPR), UV/vis, Raman, and X-ray diffraction (XRD). The specific surface area of the catalysts decreases with vanadium loading, and the degree of polymerization of VOx species is influenced by the support material. The catalytic activity of the VOx(2.7)/MCM-41 catalyst is slightly higher than that of the VOx(2.8)/SiO2 and VOx(3.4)/MCM-48 samples, possibly due to a lower degree of polymerization of VOx species. The lowest activity was observed over the VOx(11.2)/MCM-41 sample, which possesses microcrystalline V2O5. Catalyst deactivation and stability are critical challenges in the ODHP process. The use of N2O as an oxidant can help mitigate these issues by reducing the formation of nonselective adsorbed oxygen species that can lead to catalyst deactivation. However, the lower activity of N2O compared to O2 can also be a limitation. Strategies to address these challenges include optimizing the catalyst structure and composition to enhance stability and selectivity, developing methods to regenerate deactivated catalysts, and exploring alternative oxidants that can provide high selectivity and activity while maintaining catalyst stability.", "Chinese": "一氧化二氮（N2O）作为氧化剂在丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）中显示出相对于其他氧化剂的优势，特别是在丙烯选择性方面。使用N2O作为氧化剂可导致与氧气（O2）相比，在广泛的丙烷转化率范围内具有更高的丙烯选择性。这种改善的选择性归因于N2O能够实现更高的初始丙烯选择性，并降低连续丙烯氧化的活性。N2O比O2更慢地重新氧化还原的VOx物种，这对于抑制非选择性的连续丙烯氧化至COx至关重要。氧物种的性质也起着作用，N2O不会产生非选择性的吸附氧物种，这些物种可以催化非选择性的连续丙烯氧化至COx。已经使用了各种催化剂，包括VOx/SiO2、VOx/MCM-41和VOx/MCM-48，在ODHP过程中。这些催化剂使用了包括透射电子显微镜（TEM）、温度程序还原（TPR）、UV/vis、拉曼和X射线衍射（XRD）在内的多种技术进行了表征。随着钒负载量的增加，催化剂的比表面积降低，VOx物种的聚合度受支撑材料的影响。VOx(2.7)/MCM-41催化剂的催化活性略高于VOx(2.8)/SiO2和VOx(3.4)/MCM-48样品，这可能归因于VOx物种较低的聚合度。观察到最低活性是在VOx(11.2)/MCM-41样品上，该样品具有微晶V2O5。催化剂失活和稳定性是ODHP过程中的关键挑战。使用N2O作为氧化剂可以通过减少导致催化剂失活的非选择性吸附氧物种的形成来帮助缓解这些问题。然而，N2O的较低活性与O2相比也可能是一个限制。解决这些挑战的策略包括优化催化剂结构和组成以增强稳定性和选择性，开发方法来再生失活的催化剂，以及探索可以提供高选择性和活性同时保持催化剂稳定性的替代氧化剂。", "Doi": "10.1021/jp070747c"},

The essential role of N2O in this process is highlighted by the fact that propene production does not occur when propane interacts with iron zeolites in the absence of N2O.

oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) over alumina- and silica-supported vanadia catalysts compared to O2. However, the ODP activity with N2O is lower than with O2. The degree of reduction of VOx species is suggested to be important for achieving high propene selectivity. The nature of oxygen species, whether adsorbed (nonlattice) or lattice, also influences COx formation. Adsorbed oxygen species are considered nonselective for the ODP reaction over certain catalysts. The redox dynamics of VOx species have been studied using in-situ UV/vis analysis, and the catalytic performance of different VOx/SiO2, VOx/MCM-41, and VOx/MCM-48 materials in the ODP reaction has been characterized. Nitrous oxide (N2O) has been found to be advantageous as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) compared to other oxidants like oxygen (O2). This is due to its ability to achieve higher propylene selectivity. The study of VOx/MCM-41, VOx/SiO2, and VOx/MCM-48 materials has shown that N2O can lead to a higher degree of reduction of vanadium species, which is essential for achieving high primary propylene selectivity and suppressing consecutive propylene oxidation to CO and CO2. The higher polymerized VOx species have a higher activity for consecutive propene oxidation, and the importance of direct propane oxidation and consecutive propene oxidation to COx is significantly higher in the presence of O2 than in N2O. The catalytic performance is determined by the oxidant activation, and N2O's lower oxidizing ability tunes the degree of reduction of vanadium species, leading to a higher reduction degree of VOx species. This effect is related to the spatial separation of active lattice oxygen species, reducing the surface density of active oxygen species. However, the degree of reduction of VOx species is not the only reason for the superior performance of N2O compared to O2. The nature of oxygen species also influences COx formation, with adsorbed (nonlattice) oxygen species being nonselective for the ODP reaction over certain catalytic materials. In contrast, N2O decomposition over reducible metal oxides yields mononuclear oxygen species, which are considered selective. The critical challenges associated with catalyst deactivation and stability in N2O-ODHP include the need for a high degree of reduction of vanadium species and the prevention of nonselective oxygen species formation. Strategies to address these limitations could involve the development of catalysts with controlled surface density of active oxygen species and the optimization of reaction conditions to favor selective oxygen species formation. Research directions could focus on understanding the mechanisms of oxygen species formation and their role in the selectivity of the ODHP process, as well as the development of new catalyst formulations that can maintain high activity and selectivity under N2O-ODHP conditions. Nitrous oxide (N2O) has been shown to have advantages over other oxidants in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP), particularly in terms of propylene selectivity. The use of N2O as an oxidant results in higher propylene selectivity compared to oxygen (O2) over a broad range of propane conversions. This effect is more pronounced for catalysts with microcrystalline V2O5. The improved selectivity is attributed to the ability of N2O to achieve a higher primary propene selectivity and to lower the activity for consecutive propene oxidation. N2O reoxidizes reduced VOx species slower than O2, which is essential for suppressing nonselective consecutive propene oxidation to COx. The nature of oxygen species also plays a role, with N2O not producing nonselective adsorbed oxygen species that can catalyze nonselective consecutive propene oxidation to COx. A variety of catalysts have been employed in the ODHP process, including VOx/SiO2, VOx/MCM-41, and VOx/MCM-48. These catalysts have been characterized using various techniques such as transmission electron microscopy (TEM), temperature-programmed reduction (TPR), UV/vis, Raman, and X-ray diffraction (XRD). The specific surface area of the catalysts decreases with vanadium loading, and the degree of polymerization of VOx species is influenced by the support material. The catalytic activity of the VOx(2.7)/MCM-41 catalyst is slightly higher than that of the VOx(2.8)/SiO2 and VOx(3.4)/MCM-48 samples, possibly due to a lower degree of polymerization of VOx species. The lowest activity was observed over the VOx(11.2)/MCM-41 sample, which possesses microcrystalline V2O5. Catalyst deactivation and stability are critical challenges in the ODHP process. The use of N2O as an oxidant can help mitigate these issues by reducing the formation of nonselective adsorbed oxygen species that can lead to catalyst deactivation. However, the lower activity of N2O compared to O2 can also be a limitation. Strategies to address these challenges include optimizing the catalyst structure and composition to enhance stability and selectivity, developing methods to regenerate deactivated catalysts, and exploring alternative oxidants that can provide high selectivity and activity while maintaining catalyst stability.", "Chinese": "一氧化二氮（N2O）作为氧化剂在丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）中显示出相对于其他氧化剂的优势，特别是在丙烯选择性方面。使用N2O作为氧化剂可导致与氧气（O2）相比，在广泛的丙烷转化率范围内具有更高的丙烯选择性。这种改善的选择性归因于N2O能够实现更高的初始丙烯选择性，并降低连续丙烯氧化的活性。N2O比O2更慢地重新氧化还原的VOx物种，这对于抑制非选择性的连续丙烯氧化至COx至关重要。氧物种的性质也起着作用，N2O不会产生非选择性的吸附氧物种，这些物种可以催化非选择性的连续丙烯氧化至COx。已经使用了各种催化剂，包括VOx/SiO2、VOx/MCM-41和VOx/MCM-48，在ODHP过程中。这些催化剂使用了包括透射电子显微镜（TEM）、温度程序还原（TPR）、UV/vis、拉曼和X射线衍射（XRD）在内的多种技术进行了表征。随着钒负载量的增加，催化剂的比表面积降低，VOx物种的聚合度受支撑材料的影响。VOx(2.7)/MCM-41催化剂的催化活性略高于VOx(2.8)/SiO2和VOx(3.4)/MCM-48样品，这可能归因于VOx物种较低的聚合度。观察到最低活性是在VOx(11.2)/MCM-41样品上，该样品具有微晶V2O5。催化剂失活和稳定性是ODHP过程中的关键挑战。使用N2O作为氧化剂可以通过减少导致催化剂失活的非选择性吸附氧物种的形成来帮助缓解这些问题。然而，N2O的较低活性与O2相比也可能是一个限制。解决这些挑战的策略包括优化催化剂结构和组成以增强稳定性和选择性，开发方法来再生失活的催化剂，以及探索可以提供高选择性和活性同时保持催化剂稳定性的替代氧化剂。", "Doi": "10.1021/jp070747c"},

However, the catalyst deactivation is a critical challenge in this process, as it is mainly caused by the reduction of vanadium species rather than the formation of carbonaceous deposits. The regeneration of the catalyst by heating under N2O at high temperatures can partly restore its activity, but complete restoration requires reoxidation in the presence of oxygen. To address these limitations and make N2O-ODHP a more feasible option for practical implementation, research directions could focus on developing more stable catalysts that can maintain their activity over longer periods, optimizing the reaction conditions to minimize vanadium reduction, and exploring alternative regeneration methods that can effectively restore the catalyst's activity without the need for high-temperature treatments.", "Chinese": "一氧化二氮(N2O)作为氧化脱氢丙烷(ODHP)的氧化剂,由于其能够实现比其他氧化剂更高的丙烯选择性,尽管丙烷转化率较低。这归因于N2O能够还原钒物种而不形成过氧钒酸盐,过氧钒酸盐具有高反应性,可导致碳氧化物的形成。使用N2O作为氧化剂导致较慢的再氧化过程,这允许更高的丙烯选择性。然而,催化剂失活是该过程中的一个关键挑战,因为它主要是由钒物种的还原引起的,而不是碳质沉积物的形成。通过在高温下在N2O下加热催化剂,可以部分恢复其活性,但完全恢复需要在氧气存在下进行再氧化。为了解决这些限制,使N2O-ODHP成为更可行的实践实施选项,研究方向可以集中在开发更稳定的催化剂,这些催化剂可以在更长的时间内保持其活性,优化反应条件以最小化钒还原,并探索可以有效恢复催化剂活性而无需高温处理的替代再生方法。", "Doi": "10.1016/j.jcat.2015.12.028"},

This improvement has been observed over various catalysts, including steam-activated iron-containing zeolites, bulk vanadium oxides, and supported vanadium-containing materials. A similar effect of N2O has also been reported for the oxidative dehydrogenation of n-butane over vanadium magnesium oxide catalysts. The positive effect of N2O on the ODHP reaction is attributed to the slower reoxidation of reduced VOx species compared to O2, resulting in a lower steady-state concentration of active lattice oxygen sites and thus suppressing the consecutive oxidation of propene to carbon oxides. However, the activity of VOx sites for consecutive propene oxidation increases with rising agglomerization degree. Propene selectivities do not differ much as long as the vanadium surface concentration remains below monolayer coverage, with only isolated VOx sites and small two-dimensional VxOy clusters present. When V2O5 nanocrystallites dominate, there is a dramatic drop in propene selectivity and direct total oxidation of propane occurs with both oxidants, although this detrimental effect is less pronounced in the presence of N2O. A recent study suggested that compared to N2O, other oxygen species (non-lattice oxygen of VOx species) are formed from gas-phase O2 and participate in COx formation. However, there is limited experimental information on the nature of active oxygen species formed from O2 and N2O upon reoxidation of reduced VOx species. The aim of this study is to obtain experimental evidence on the nature and structure of oxygen species formed upon reoxidation of reduced highly dispersed VOx species supported over MCM-41 with O2 and N2O.

In comparison, the respective value with N2O was only half as high, while the propene selectivity was higher, amounting to 80% with N2O but only to 50% with O2 at propane conversion of approximately 10%. Since several of the previously postulated oxygen species were paramagnetic, EPR spectroscopy under controlled atmosphere conditions was applied to experimentally identify oxygen species formed from gaseous N2O and O2 over VOx/MCM-41 and to explore the reactivity of these species towards oxidation of C3H8, C3H6, and CO.", "Chinese": "一氧化二氮(N2O)作为氧化剂在丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)中使用时,与氧气(O2)相比,显著提高了丙烯选择性。这种改善在各种催化剂上都有观察到,包括蒸汽活化铁含沸石、块状钒氧化物和含钒支撑材料。N2O对n-丁烷氧化脱氢的类似效果也已在钒镁氧化物催化剂上报道。N2O对ODHP反应的积极作用归因于与O2相比,VOx物种的还原态的再氧化速率较慢,导致活性晶格氧位点的稳态浓度较低,从而抑制了丙烯向二氧化碳的连续氧化。然而,VOx位点对连续丙烯氧化的活性随着聚集度的增加而增加。只要钒表面浓度保持在单层覆盖以下,丙烯选择性差异不大,只有孤立的VOx位点和小的二维VxOy簇存在。当V2O5纳米晶占主导时,不仅丙烯选择性急剧下降,而且在两种氧化剂存在下,丙烷的直接完全氧化都会发生,尽管在N2O存在下,这种不利影响不那么明显。最近的一项研究指出,与N2O相比,从气相O2中形成的其他氧物种(VOx物种的非晶格氧)参与了COx的形成。然而,关于从O2和N2O还原VOx物种时形成的活性氧物种的性质,只有有限的实验信息。本研究的目的是获得实验证据,证明在O2和N2O存在下,在MCM-41上还原的高分散VOx物种的性质和结构。本研究中使用的VOx/MCM-41催化剂以前已在丙烷氧化脱氢中进行了彻底的表征和测试。使用O2作为氧化剂时,测得的丙烷转化率的周转频率为0.016 molC3H8 mol1 V s1。相比之下,N2O的相应值仅为一半,而丙烯选择性更高,在丙烷转化率约为10%时,丙烯选择性为80%,而O2仅为50%。由于以前假设的几种氧物种具有顺磁性,因此在受控气氛条件下应用了EPR光谱,以实验上识别从气相N2O和O2在VOx/MCM-41上形成的氧物种,并探索这些物种对C3H8、C3H6和CO氧化的反应性。", "Doi": "10.1016/j.jcat.2010.06.010"},

oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) over alumina- and silica-supported vanadia catalysts compared to O2. However, the ODP activity with N2O is lower than with O2. The degree of reduction of VOx species is suggested to be important for achieving high propene selectivity. The nature of oxygen species, whether adsorbed (nonlattice) or lattice, also influences COx formation. Adsorbed oxygen species are considered nonselective for the ODP reaction over certain catalysts. The redox dynamics of VOx species have been studied using in-situ UV/vis analysis, and the catalytic performance of different VOx/SiO2, VOx/MCM-41, and VOx/MCM-48 materials in the ODP reaction has been characterized. Nitrous oxide (N2O) has been found to be advantageous as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) compared to other oxidants like oxygen (O2). This is due to its ability to achieve higher propylene selectivity. The study of VOx/MCM-41, VOx/SiO2, and VOx/MCM-48 materials has shown that N2O can lead to a higher degree of reduction of vanadium species, which is essential for achieving high primary propylene selectivity and suppressing consecutive propylene oxidation to CO and CO2. The higher polymerized VOx species have a higher activity for consecutive propene oxidation, and the importance of direct propane oxidation and consecutive propene oxidation to COx is significantly higher in the presence of O2 than in N2O. The catalytic performance is determined by the oxidant activation, and N2O's lower oxidizing ability tunes the degree of reduction of vanadium species, leading to a higher reduction degree of VOx species. This effect is related to the spatial separation of active lattice oxygen species, reducing the surface density of active oxygen species. However, the degree of reduction of VOx species is not the only reason for the superior performance of N2O compared to O2. The nature of oxygen species also influences COx formation, with adsorbed (nonlattice) oxygen species being nonselective for the ODP reaction over certain catalytic materials. In contrast, N2O decomposition over reducible metal oxides yields mononuclear oxygen species, which are considered selective. The critical challenges associated with catalyst deactivation and stability in N2O-ODHP include the need for a high degree of reduction of vanadium species and the prevention of nonselective oxygen species formation. Strategies to address these limitations could involve the development of catalysts with controlled surface density of active oxygen species and the optimization of reaction conditions to favor selective oxygen species formation. Research directions could focus on understanding the mechanisms of oxygen species formation and their role in the selectivity of the ODHP process, as well as the development of new catalyst formulations that can maintain high activity and selectivity under N2O-ODHP conditions. Nitrous oxide (N2O) has been shown to have advantages over other oxidants in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP), particularly in terms of propylene selectivity. The use of N2O as an oxidant results in higher propylene selectivity compared to oxygen (O2) over a broad range of propane conversions. This effect is more pronounced for catalysts with microcrystalline V2O5. The improved selectivity is attributed to the ability of N2O to achieve a higher primary propene selectivity and to lower the activity for consecutive propene oxidation. N2O reoxidizes reduced VOx species slower than O2, which is essential for suppressing nonselective consecutive propene oxidation to COx. The nature of oxygen species also plays a role, with N2O not producing nonselective adsorbed oxygen species that can catalyze nonselective consecutive propene oxidation to COx. A variety of catalysts have been employed in the ODHP process, including VOx/SiO2, VOx/MCM-41, and VOx/MCM-48. These catalysts have been characterized using various techniques such as transmission electron microscopy (TEM), temperature-programmed reduction (TPR), UV/vis, Raman, and X-ray diffraction (XRD). The specific surface area of the catalysts decreases with vanadium loading, and the degree of polymerization of VOx species is influenced by the support material. The catalytic activity of the VOx(2.7)/MCM-41 catalyst is slightly higher than that of the VOx(2.8)/SiO2 and VOx(3.4)/MCM-48 samples, possibly due to a lower degree of polymerization of VOx species. The lowest activity was observed over the VOx(11.2)/MCM-41 sample, which possesses microcrystalline V2O5. Catalyst deactivation and stability are critical challenges in the ODHP process. The use of N2O as an oxidant can help mitigate these issues by reducing the formation of nonselective adsorbed oxygen species that can lead to catalyst deactivation. However, the lower activity of N2O compared to O2 can also be a limitation. Strategies to address these challenges include optimizing the catalyst structure and composition to enhance stability and selectivity, developing methods to regenerate deactivated catalysts, and exploring alternative oxidants that can provide high selectivity and activity while maintaining catalyst stability.", "Chinese": "一氧化二氮（N2O）作为氧化剂在丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）中显示出相对于其他氧化剂的优势，特别是在丙烯选择性方面。使用N2O作为氧化剂可导致与氧气（O2）相比，在广泛的丙烷转化率范围内具有更高的丙烯选择性。这种改善的选择性归因于N2O能够实现更高的初始丙烯选择性，并降低连续丙烯氧化的活性。N2O比O2更慢地重新氧化还原的VOx物种，这对于抑制非选择性的连续丙烯氧化至COx至关重要。氧物种的性质也起着作用，N2O不会产生非选择性的吸附氧物种，这些物种可以催化非选择性的连续丙烯氧化至COx。已经使用了各种催化剂，包括VOx/SiO2、VOx/MCM-41和VOx/MCM-48，在ODHP过程中。这些催化剂使用了包括透射电子显微镜（TEM）、温度程序还原（TPR）、UV/vis、拉曼和X射线衍射（XRD）在内的多种技术进行了表征。随着钒负载量的增加，催化剂的比表面积降低，VOx物种的聚合度受支撑材料的影响。VOx(2.7)/MCM-41催化剂的催化活性略高于VOx(2.8)/SiO2和VOx(3.4)/MCM-48样品，这可能归因于VOx物种较低的聚合度。观察到最低活性是在VOx(11.2)/MCM-41样品上，该样品具有微晶V2O5。催化剂失活和稳定性是ODHP过程中的关键挑战。使用N2O作为氧化剂可以通过减少导致催化剂失活的非选择性吸附氧物种的形成来帮助缓解这些问题。然而，N2O的较低活性与O2相比也可能是一个限制。解决这些挑战的策略包括优化催化剂结构和组成以增强稳定性和选择性，开发方法来再生失活的催化剂，以及探索可以提供高选择性和活性同时保持催化剂稳定性的替代氧化剂。", "Doi": "10.1021/jp070747c"},

The essential role of N2O in this process is highlighted by the fact that propene production does not occur when propane interacts with iron zeolites in the absence of N2O.

oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) over alumina- and silica-supported vanadia catalysts compared to O2. However, the ODP activity with N2O is lower than with O2. The degree of reduction of VOx species is suggested to be important for achieving high propene selectivity. The nature of oxygen species, whether adsorbed (nonlattice) or lattice, also influences COx formation. Adsorbed oxygen species are considered nonselective for the ODP reaction over certain catalysts. The redox dynamics of VOx species have been studied using in-situ UV/vis analysis, and the catalytic performance of different VOx/SiO2, VOx/MCM-41, and VOx/MCM-48 materials in the ODP reaction has been characterized. Nitrous oxide (N2O) has been found to be advantageous as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) compared to other oxidants like oxygen (O2). This is due to its ability to achieve higher propylene selectivity. The study of VOx/MCM-41, VOx/SiO2, and VOx/MCM-48 materials has shown that N2O can lead to a higher degree of reduction of vanadium species, which is essential for achieving high primary propylene selectivity and suppressing consecutive propylene oxidation to CO and CO2. The higher polymerized VOx species have a higher activity for consecutive propene oxidation, and the importance of direct propane oxidation and consecutive propene oxidation to COx is significantly higher in the presence of O2 than in N2O. The catalytic performance is determined by the oxidant activation, and N2O's lower oxidizing ability tunes the degree of reduction of vanadium species, leading to a higher reduction degree of VOx species. This effect is related to the spatial separation of active lattice oxygen species, reducing the surface density of active oxygen species. However, the degree of reduction of VOx species is not the only reason for the superior performance of N2O compared to O2. The nature of oxygen species also influences COx formation, with adsorbed (nonlattice) oxygen species being nonselective for the ODP reaction over certain catalytic materials. In contrast, N2O decomposition over reducible metal oxides yields mononuclear oxygen species, which are considered selective. The critical challenges associated with catalyst deactivation and stability in N2O-ODHP include the need for a high degree of reduction of vanadium species and the prevention of nonselective oxygen species formation. Strategies to address these limitations could involve the development of catalysts with controlled surface density of active oxygen species and the optimization of reaction conditions to favor selective oxygen species formation. Research directions could focus on understanding the mechanisms of oxygen species formation and their role in the selectivity of the ODHP process, as well as the development of new catalyst formulations that can maintain high activity and selectivity under N2O-ODHP conditions. Nitrous oxide (N2O) has been shown to have advantages over other oxidants in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP), particularly in terms of propylene selectivity. The use of N2O as an oxidant results in higher propylene selectivity compared to oxygen (O2) over a broad range of propane conversions. This effect is more pronounced for catalysts with microcrystalline V2O5. The improved selectivity is attributed to the ability of N2O to achieve a higher primary propene selectivity and to lower the activity for consecutive propene oxidation. N2O reoxidizes reduced VOx species slower than O2, which is essential for suppressing nonselective consecutive propene oxidation to COx. The nature of oxygen species also plays a role, with N2O not producing nonselective adsorbed oxygen species that can catalyze nonselective consecutive propene oxidation to COx. A variety of catalysts have been employed in the ODHP process, including VOx/SiO2, VOx/MCM-41, and VOx/MCM-48. These catalysts have been characterized using various techniques such as transmission electron microscopy (TEM), temperature-programmed reduction (TPR), UV/vis, Raman, and X-ray diffraction (XRD). The specific surface area of the catalysts decreases with vanadium loading, and the degree of polymerization of VOx species is influenced by the support material. The catalytic activity of the VOx(2.7)/MCM-41 catalyst is slightly higher than that of the VOx(2.8)/SiO2 and VOx(3.4)/MCM-48 samples, possibly due to a lower degree of polymerization of VOx species. The lowest activity was observed over the VOx(11.2)/MCM-41 sample, which possesses microcrystalline V2O5. Catalyst deactivation and stability are critical challenges in the ODHP process. The use of N2O as an oxidant can help mitigate these issues by reducing the formation of nonselective adsorbed oxygen species that can lead to catalyst deactivation. However, the lower activity of N2O compared to O2 can also be a limitation. Strategies to address these challenges include optimizing the catalyst structure and composition to enhance stability and selectivity, developing methods to regenerate deactivated catalysts, and exploring alternative oxidants that can provide high selectivity and activity while maintaining catalyst stability.", "Chinese": "一氧化二氮（N2O）作为氧化剂在丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）中显示出相对于其他氧化剂的优势，特别是在丙烯选择性方面。使用N2O作为氧化剂可导致与氧气（O2）相比，在广泛的丙烷转化率范围内具有更高的丙烯选择性。这种改善的选择性归因于N2O能够实现更高的初始丙烯选择性，并降低连续丙烯氧化的活性。N2O比O2更慢地重新氧化还原的VOx物种，这对于抑制非选择性的连续丙烯氧化至COx至关重要。氧物种的性质也起着作用，N2O不会产生非选择性的吸附氧物种，这些物种可以催化非选择性的连续丙烯氧化至COx。已经使用了各种催化剂，包括VOx/SiO2、VOx/MCM-41和VOx/MCM-48，在ODHP过程中。这些催化剂使用了包括透射电子显微镜（TEM）、温度程序还原（TPR）、UV/vis、拉曼和X射线衍射（XRD）在内的多种技术进行了表征。随着钒负载量的增加，催化剂的比表面积降低，VOx物种的聚合度受支撑材料的影响。VOx(2.7)/MCM-41催化剂的催化活性略高于VOx(2.8)/SiO2和VOx(3.4)/MCM-48样品，这可能归因于VOx物种较低的聚合度。观察到最低活性是在VOx(11.2)/MCM-41样品上，该样品具有微晶V2O5。催化剂失活和稳定性是ODHP过程中的关键挑战。使用N2O作为氧化剂可以通过减少导致催化剂失活的非选择性吸附氧物种的形成来帮助缓解这些问题。然而，N2O的较低活性与O2相比也可能是一个限制。解决这些挑战的策略包括优化催化剂结构和组成以增强稳定性和选择性，开发方法来再生失活的催化剂，以及探索可以提供高选择性和活性同时保持催化剂稳定性的替代氧化剂。", "Doi": "10.1021/jp070747c"},

However, the catalyst deactivation is a critical challenge in this process, as it is mainly caused by the reduction of vanadium species rather than the formation of carbonaceous deposits. The regeneration of the catalyst by heating under N2O at high temperatures can partly restore its activity, but complete restoration requires reoxidation in the presence of oxygen. To address these limitations and make N2O-ODHP a more feasible option for practical implementation, research directions could focus on developing more stable catalysts that can maintain their activity over longer periods, optimizing the reaction conditions to minimize vanadium reduction, and exploring alternative regeneration methods that can effectively restore the catalyst's activity without the need for high-temperature treatments.", "Chinese": "一氧化二氮(N2O)作为氧化脱氢丙烷(ODHP)的氧化剂,由于其能够实现比其他氧化剂更高的丙烯选择性,尽管丙烷转化率较低。这归因于N2O能够还原钒物种而不形成过氧钒酸盐,过氧钒酸盐具有高反应性,可导致碳氧化物的形成。使用N2O作为氧化剂导致较慢的再氧化过程,这允许更高的丙烯选择性。然而,催化剂失活是该过程中的一个关键挑战,因为它主要是由钒物种的还原引起的,而不是碳质沉积物的形成。通过在高温下在N2O下加热催化剂,可以部分恢复其活性,但完全恢复需要在氧气存在下进行再氧化。为了解决这些限制,使N2O-ODHP成为更可行的实践实施选项,研究方向可以集中在开发更稳定的催化剂,这些催化剂可以在更长的时间内保持其活性,优化反应条件以最小化钒还原,并探索可以有效恢复催化剂活性而无需高温处理的替代再生方法。", "Doi": "10.1016/j.jcat.2015.12.028"},

This improvement has been observed over various catalysts, including steam-activated iron-containing zeolites, bulk vanadium oxides, and supported vanadium-containing materials. A similar effect of N2O has also been reported for the oxidative dehydrogenation of n-butane over vanadium magnesium oxide catalysts. The positive effect of N2O on the ODHP reaction is attributed to the slower reoxidation of reduced VOx species compared to O2, resulting in a lower steady-state concentration of active lattice oxygen sites and thus suppressing the consecutive oxidation of propene to carbon oxides. However, the activity of VOx sites for consecutive propene oxidation increases with rising agglomerization degree. Propene selectivities do not differ much as long as the vanadium surface concentration remains below monolayer coverage, with only isolated VOx sites and small two-dimensional VxOy clusters present. When V2O5 nanocrystallites dominate, there is a dramatic drop in propene selectivity and direct total oxidation of propane occurs with both oxidants, although this detrimental effect is less pronounced in the presence of N2O. A recent study suggested that compared to N2O, other oxygen species (non-lattice oxygen of VOx species) are formed from gas-phase O2 and participate in COx formation. However, there is limited experimental information on the nature of active oxygen species formed from O2 and N2O upon reoxidation of reduced VOx species. The aim of this study is to obtain experimental evidence on the nature and structure of oxygen species formed upon reoxidation of reduced highly dispersed VOx species supported over MCM-41 with O2 and N2O.

In comparison, the respective value with N2O was only half as high, while the propene selectivity was higher, amounting to 80% with N2O but only to 50% with O2 at propane conversion of approximately 10%. Since several of the previously postulated oxygen species were paramagnetic, EPR spectroscopy under controlled atmosphere conditions was applied to experimentally identify oxygen species formed from gaseous N2O and O2 over VOx/MCM-41 and to explore the reactivity of these species towards oxidation of C3H8, C3H6, and CO.", "Chinese": "一氧化二氮(N2O)作为氧化剂在丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)中使用时,与氧气(O2)相比,显著提高了丙烯选择性。这种改善在各种催化剂上都有观察到,包括蒸汽活化铁含沸石、块状钒氧化物和含钒支撑材料。N2O对n-丁烷氧化脱氢的类似效果也已在钒镁氧化物催化剂上报道。N2O对ODHP反应的积极作用归因于与O2相比,VOx物种的还原态的再氧化速率较慢,导致活性晶格氧位点的稳态浓度较低,从而抑制了丙烯向二氧化碳的连续氧化。然而,VOx位点对连续丙烯氧化的活性随着聚集度的增加而增加。只要钒表面浓度保持在单层覆盖以下,丙烯选择性差异不大,只有孤立的VOx位点和小的二维VxOy簇存在。当V2O5纳米晶占主导时,不仅丙烯选择性急剧下降,而且在两种氧化剂存在下,丙烷的直接完全氧化都会发生,尽管在N2O存在下,这种不利影响不那么明显。最近的一项研究指出,与N2O相比,从气相O2中形成的其他氧物种(VOx物种的非晶格氧)参与了COx的形成。然而,关于从O2和N2O还原VOx物种时形成的活性氧物种的性质,只有有限的实验信息。本研究的目的是获得实验证据,证明在O2和N2O存在下,在MCM-41上还原的高分散VOx物种的性质和结构。本研究中使用的VOx/MCM-41催化剂以前已在丙烷氧化脱氢中进行了彻底的表征和测试。使用O2作为氧化剂时,测得的丙烷转化率的周转频率为0.016 molC3H8 mol1 V s1。相比之下,N2O的相应值仅为一半,而丙烯选择性更高,在丙烷转化率约为10%时,丙烯选择性为80%,而O2仅为50%。由于以前假设的几种氧物种具有顺磁性,因此在受控气氛条件下应用了EPR光谱,以实验上识别从气相N2O和O2在VOx/MCM-41上形成的氧物种,并探索这些物种对C3H8、C3H6和CO氧化的反应性。", "Doi": "10.1016/j.jcat.2010.06.010"},

oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) over alumina- and silica-supported vanadia catalysts compared to O2. However, the ODP activity with N2O is lower than with O2. The degree of reduction of VOx species is suggested to be important for achieving high propene selectivity. The nature of oxygen species, whether adsorbed (nonlattice) or lattice, also influences COx formation. Adsorbed oxygen species are considered nonselective for the ODP reaction over certain catalysts. The redox dynamics of VOx species have been studied using in-situ UV/vis analysis, and the catalytic performance of different VOx/SiO2, VOx/MCM-41, and VOx/MCM-48 materials in the ODP reaction has been characterized. Nitrous oxide (N2O) has been found to be advantageous as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) compared to other oxidants like oxygen (O2). This is due to its ability to achieve higher propylene selectivity. The study of VOx/MCM-41, VOx/SiO2, and VOx/MCM-48 materials has shown that N2O can lead to a higher degree of reduction of vanadium species, which is essential for achieving high primary propylene selectivity and suppressing consecutive propylene oxidation to CO and CO2. The higher polymerized VOx species have a higher activity for consecutive propene oxidation, and the importance of direct propane oxidation and consecutive propene oxidation to COx is significantly higher in the presence of O2 than in N2O. The catalytic performance is determined by the oxidant activation, and N2O's lower oxidizing ability tunes the degree of reduction of vanadium species, leading to a higher reduction degree of VOx species. This effect is related to the spatial separation of active lattice oxygen species, reducing the surface density of active oxygen species. However, the degree of reduction of VOx species is not the only reason for the superior performance of N2O compared to O2. The nature of oxygen species also influences COx formation, with adsorbed (nonlattice) oxygen species being nonselective for the ODP reaction over certain catalytic materials. In contrast, N2O decomposition over reducible metal oxides yields mononuclear oxygen species, which are considered selective. The critical challenges associated with catalyst deactivation and stability in N2O-ODHP include the need for a high degree of reduction of vanadium species and the prevention of nonselective oxygen species formation. Strategies to address these limitations could involve the development of catalysts with controlled surface density of active oxygen species and the optimization of reaction conditions to favor selective oxygen species formation. Research directions could focus on understanding the mechanisms of oxygen species formation and their role in the selectivity of the ODHP process, as well as the development of new catalyst formulations that can maintain high activity and selectivity under N2O-ODHP conditions. Nitrous oxide (N2O) has been shown to have advantages over other oxidants in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP), particularly in terms of propylene selectivity. The use of N2O as an oxidant results in higher propylene selectivity compared to oxygen (O2) over a broad range of propane conversions. This effect is more pronounced for catalysts with microcrystalline V2O5. The improved selectivity is attributed to the ability of N2O to achieve a higher primary propene selectivity and to lower the activity for consecutive propene oxidation. N2O reoxidizes reduced VOx species slower than O2, which is essential for suppressing nonselective consecutive propene oxidation to COx. The nature of oxygen species also plays a role, with N2O not producing nonselective adsorbed oxygen species that can catalyze nonselective consecutive propene oxidation to COx. A variety of catalysts have been employed in the ODHP process, including VOx/SiO2, VOx/MCM-41, and VOx/MCM-48. These catalysts have been characterized using various techniques such as transmission electron microscopy (TEM), temperature-programmed reduction (TPR), UV/vis, Raman, and X-ray diffraction (XRD). The specific surface area of the catalysts decreases with vanadium loading, and the degree of polymerization of VOx species is influenced by the support material. The catalytic activity of the VOx(2.7)/MCM-41 catalyst is slightly higher than that of the VOx(2.8)/SiO2 and VOx(3.4)/MCM-48 samples, possibly due to a lower degree of polymerization of VOx species. The lowest activity was observed over the VOx(11.2)/MCM-41 sample, which possesses microcrystalline V2O5. Catalyst deactivation and stability are critical challenges in the ODHP process. The use of N2O as an oxidant can help mitigate these issues by reducing the formation of nonselective adsorbed oxygen species that can lead to catalyst deactivation. However, the lower activity of N2O compared to O2 can also be a limitation. Strategies to address these challenges include optimizing the catalyst structure and composition to enhance stability and selectivity, developing methods to regenerate deactivated catalysts, and exploring alternative oxidants that can provide high selectivity and activity while maintaining catalyst stability.", "Chinese": "一氧化二氮（N2O）作为氧化剂在丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）中显示出相对于其他氧化剂的优势，特别是在丙烯选择性方面。使用N2O作为氧化剂可导致与氧气（O2）相比，在广泛的丙烷转化率范围内具有更高的丙烯选择性。这种改善的选择性归因于N2O能够实现更高的初始丙烯选择性，并降低连续丙烯氧化的活性。N2O比O2更慢地重新氧化还原的VOx物种，这对于抑制非选择性的连续丙烯氧化至COx至关重要。氧物种的性质也起着作用，N2O不会产生非选择性的吸附氧物种，这些物种可以催化非选择性的连续丙烯氧化至COx。已经使用了各种催化剂，包括VOx/SiO2、VOx/MCM-41和VOx/MCM-48，在ODHP过程中。这些催化剂使用了包括透射电子显微镜（TEM）、温度程序还原（TPR）、UV/vis、拉曼和X射线衍射（XRD）在内的多种技术进行了表征。随着钒负载量的增加，催化剂的比表面积降低，VOx物种的聚合度受支撑材料的影响。VOx(2.7)/MCM-41催化剂的催化活性略高于VOx(2.8)/SiO2和VOx(3.4)/MCM-48样品，这可能归因于VOx物种较低的聚合度。观察到最低活性是在VOx(11.2)/MCM-41样品上，该样品具有微晶V2O5。催化剂失活和稳定性是ODHP过程中的关键挑战。使用N2O作为氧化剂可以通过减少导致催化剂失活的非选择性吸附氧物种的形成来帮助缓解这些问题。然而，N2O的较低活性与O2相比也可能是一个限制。解决这些挑战的策略包括优化催化剂结构和组成以增强稳定性和选择性，开发方法来再生失活的催化剂，以及探索可以提供高选择性和活性同时保持催化剂稳定性的替代氧化剂。", "Doi": "10.1021/jp070747c"},

The essential role of N2O in this process is highlighted by the fact that propene production does not occur when propane interacts with iron zeolites in the absence of N2O.

oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) over alumina- and silica-supported vanadia catalysts compared to O2. However, the ODP activity with N2O is lower than with O2. The degree of reduction of VOx species is suggested to be important for achieving high propene selectivity. The nature of oxygen species, whether adsorbed (nonlattice) or lattice, also influences COx formation. Adsorbed oxygen species are considered nonselective for the ODP reaction over certain catalysts. The redox dynamics of VOx species have been studied using in-situ UV/vis analysis, and the catalytic performance of different VOx/SiO2, VOx/MCM-41, and VOx/MCM-48 materials in the ODP reaction has been characterized. Nitrous oxide (N2O) has been found to be advantageous as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) compared to other oxidants like oxygen (O2). This is due to its ability to achieve higher propylene selectivity. The study of VOx/MCM-41, VOx/SiO2, and VOx/MCM-48 materials has shown that N2O can lead to a higher degree of reduction of vanadium species, which is essential for achieving high primary propylene selectivity and suppressing consecutive propylene oxidation to CO and CO2. The higher polymerized VOx species have a higher activity for consecutive propene oxidation, and the importance of direct propane oxidation and consecutive propene oxidation to COx is significantly higher in the presence of O2 than in N2O. The catalytic performance is determined by the oxidant activation, and N2O's lower oxidizing ability tunes the degree of reduction of vanadium species, leading to a higher reduction degree of VOx species. This effect is related to the spatial separation of active lattice oxygen species, reducing the surface density of active oxygen species. However, the degree of reduction of VOx species is not the only reason for the superior performance of N2O compared to O2. The nature of oxygen species also influences COx formation, with adsorbed (nonlattice) oxygen species being nonselective for the ODP reaction over certain catalytic materials. In contrast, N2O decomposition over reducible metal oxides yields mononuclear oxygen species, which are considered selective. The critical challenges associated with catalyst deactivation and stability in N2O-ODHP include the need for a high degree of reduction of vanadium species and the prevention of nonselective oxygen species formation. Strategies to address these limitations could involve the development of catalysts with controlled surface density of active oxygen species and the optimization of reaction conditions to favor selective oxygen species formation. Research directions could focus on understanding the mechanisms of oxygen species formation and their role in the selectivity of the ODHP process, as well as the development of new catalyst formulations that can maintain high activity and selectivity under N2O-ODHP conditions. Nitrous oxide (N2O) has been shown to have advantages over other oxidants in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP), particularly in terms of propylene selectivity. The use of N2O as an oxidant results in higher propylene selectivity compared to oxygen (O2) over a broad range of propane conversions. This effect is more pronounced for catalysts with microcrystalline V2O5. The improved selectivity is attributed to the ability of N2O to achieve a higher primary propene selectivity and to lower the activity for consecutive propene oxidation. N2O reoxidizes reduced VOx species slower than O2, which is essential for suppressing nonselective consecutive propene oxidation to COx. The nature of oxygen species also plays a role, with N2O not producing nonselective adsorbed oxygen species that can catalyze nonselective consecutive propene oxidation to COx. A variety of catalysts have been employed in the ODHP process, including VOx/SiO2, VOx/MCM-41, and VOx/MCM-48. These catalysts have been characterized using various techniques such as transmission electron microscopy (TEM), temperature-programmed reduction (TPR), UV/vis, Raman, and X-ray diffraction (XRD). The specific surface area of the catalysts decreases with vanadium loading, and the degree of polymerization of VOx species is influenced by the support material. The catalytic activity of the VOx(2.7)/MCM-41 catalyst is slightly higher than that of the VOx(2.8)/SiO2 and VOx(3.4)/MCM-48 samples, possibly due to a lower degree of polymerization of VOx species. The lowest activity was observed over the VOx(11.2)/MCM-41 sample, which possesses microcrystalline V2O5. Catalyst deactivation and stability are critical challenges in the ODHP process. The use of N2O as an oxidant can help mitigate these issues by reducing the formation of nonselective adsorbed oxygen species that can lead to catalyst deactivation. However, the lower activity of N2O compared to O2 can also be a limitation. Strategies to address these challenges include optimizing the catalyst structure and composition to enhance stability and selectivity, developing methods to regenerate deactivated catalysts, and exploring alternative oxidants that can provide high selectivity and activity while maintaining catalyst stability.", "Chinese": "一氧化二氮（N2O）作为氧化剂在丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）中显示出相对于其他氧化剂的优势，特别是在丙烯选择性方面。使用N2O作为氧化剂可导致与氧气（O2）相比，在广泛的丙烷转化率范围内具有更高的丙烯选择性。这种改善的选择性归因于N2O能够实现更高的初始丙烯选择性，并降低连续丙烯氧化的活性。N2O比O2更慢地重新氧化还原的VOx物种，这对于抑制非选择性的连续丙烯氧化至COx至关重要。氧物种的性质也起着作用，N2O不会产生非选择性的吸附氧物种，这些物种可以催化非选择性的连续丙烯氧化至COx。已经使用了各种催化剂，包括VOx/SiO2、VOx/MCM-41和VOx/MCM-48，在ODHP过程中。这些催化剂使用了包括透射电子显微镜（TEM）、温度程序还原（TPR）、UV/vis、拉曼和X射线衍射（XRD）在内的多种技术进行了表征。随着钒负载量的增加，催化剂的比表面积降低，VOx物种的聚合度受支撑材料的影响。VOx(2.7)/MCM-41催化剂的催化活性略高于VOx(2.8)/SiO2和VOx(3.4)/MCM-48样品，这可能归因于VOx物种较低的聚合度。观察到最低活性是在VOx(11.2)/MCM-41样品上，该样品具有微晶V2O5。催化剂失活和稳定性是ODHP过程中的关键挑战。使用N2O作为氧化剂可以通过减少导致催化剂失活的非选择性吸附氧物种的形成来帮助缓解这些问题。然而，N2O的较低活性与O2相比也可能是一个限制。解决这些挑战的策略包括优化催化剂结构和组成以增强稳定性和选择性，开发方法来再生失活的催化剂，以及探索可以提供高选择性和活性同时保持催化剂稳定性的替代氧化剂。", "Doi": "10.1021/jp070747c"},

However, the catalyst deactivation is a critical challenge in this process, as it is mainly caused by the reduction of vanadium species rather than the formation of carbonaceous deposits. The regeneration of the catalyst by heating under N2O at high temperatures can partly restore its activity, but complete restoration requires reoxidation in the presence of oxygen. To address these limitations and make N2O-ODHP a more feasible option for practical implementation, research directions could focus on developing more stable catalysts that can maintain their activity over longer periods, optimizing the reaction conditions to minimize vanadium reduction, and exploring alternative regeneration methods that can effectively restore the catalyst's activity without the need for high-temperature treatments.", "Chinese": "一氧化二氮(N2O)作为氧化脱氢丙烷(ODHP)的氧化剂,由于其能够实现比其他氧化剂更高的丙烯选择性,尽管丙烷转化率较低。这归因于N2O能够还原钒物种而不形成过氧钒酸盐,过氧钒酸盐具有高反应性,可导致碳氧化物的形成。使用N2O作为氧化剂导致较慢的再氧化过程,这允许更高的丙烯选择性。然而,催化剂失活是该过程中的一个关键挑战,因为它主要是由钒物种的还原引起的,而不是碳质沉积物的形成。通过在高温下在N2O下加热催化剂,可以部分恢复其活性,但完全恢复需要在氧气存在下进行再氧化。为了解决这些限制,使N2O-ODHP成为更可行的实践实施选项,研究方向可以集中在开发更稳定的催化剂,这些催化剂可以在更长的时间内保持其活性,优化反应条件以最小化钒还原,并探索可以有效恢复催化剂活性而无需高温处理的替代再生方法。", "Doi": "10.1016/j.jcat.2015.12.028"},

This improvement has been observed over various catalysts, including steam-activated iron-containing zeolites, bulk vanadium oxides, and supported vanadium-containing materials. A similar effect of N2O has also been reported for the oxidative dehydrogenation of n-butane over vanadium magnesium oxide catalysts. The positive effect of N2O on the ODHP reaction is attributed to the slower reoxidation of reduced VOx species compared to O2, resulting in a lower steady-state concentration of active lattice oxygen sites and thus suppressing the consecutive oxidation of propene to carbon oxides. However, the activity of VOx sites for consecutive propene oxidation increases with rising agglomerization degree. Propene selectivities do not differ much as long as the vanadium surface concentration remains below monolayer coverage, with only isolated VOx sites and small two-dimensional VxOy clusters present. When V2O5 nanocrystallites dominate, there is a dramatic drop in propene selectivity and direct total oxidation of propane occurs with both oxidants, although this detrimental effect is less pronounced in the presence of N2O. A recent study suggested that compared to N2O, other oxygen species (non-lattice oxygen of VOx species) are formed from gas-phase O2 and participate in COx formation. However, there is limited experimental information on the nature of active oxygen species formed from O2 and N2O upon reoxidation of reduced VOx species. The aim of this study is to obtain experimental evidence on the nature and structure of oxygen species formed upon reoxidation of reduced highly dispersed VOx species supported over MCM-41 with O2 and N2O.

In comparison, the respective value with N2O was only half as high, while the propene selectivity was higher, amounting to 80% with N2O but only to 50% with O2 at propane conversion of approximately 10%. Since several of the previously postulated oxygen species were paramagnetic, EPR spectroscopy under controlled atmosphere conditions was applied to experimentally identify oxygen species formed from gaseous N2O and O2 over VOx/MCM-41 and to explore the reactivity of these species towards oxidation of C3H8, C3H6, and CO.", "Chinese": "一氧化二氮(N2O)作为氧化剂在丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)中使用时,与氧气(O2)相比,显著提高了丙烯选择性。这种改善在各种催化剂上都有观察到,包括蒸汽活化铁含沸石、块状钒氧化物和含钒支撑材料。N2O对n-丁烷氧化脱氢的类似效果也已在钒镁氧化物催化剂上报道。N2O对ODHP反应的积极作用归因于与O2相比,VOx物种的还原态的再氧化速率较慢,导致活性晶格氧位点的稳态浓度较低,从而抑制了丙烯向二氧化碳的连续氧化。然而,VOx位点对连续丙烯氧化的活性随着聚集度的增加而增加。只要钒表面浓度保持在单层覆盖以下,丙烯选择性差异不大,只有孤立的VOx位点和小的二维VxOy簇存在。当V2O5纳米晶占主导时,不仅丙烯选择性急剧下降,而且在两种氧化剂存在下,丙烷的直接完全氧化都会发生,尽管在N2O存在下,这种不利影响不那么明显。最近的一项研究指出,与N2O相比,从气相O2中形成的其他氧物种(VOx物种的非晶格氧)参与了COx的形成。然而,关于从O2和N2O还原VOx物种时形成的活性氧物种的性质,只有有限的实验信息。本研究的目的是获得实验证据,证明在O2和N2O存在下,在MCM-41上还原的高分散VOx物种的性质和结构。本研究中使用的VOx/MCM-41催化剂以前已在丙烷氧化脱氢中进行了彻底的表征和测试。使用O2作为氧化剂时,测得的丙烷转化率的周转频率为0.016 molC3H8 mol1 V s1。相比之下,N2O的相应值仅为一半,而丙烯选择性更高,在丙烷转化率约为10%时,丙烯选择性为80%,而O2仅为50%。由于以前假设的几种氧物种具有顺磁性,因此在受控气氛条件下应用了EPR光谱,以实验上识别从气相N2O和O2在VOx/MCM-41上形成的氧物种,并探索这些物种对C3H8、C3H6和CO氧化的反应性。", "Doi": "10.1016/j.jcat.2010.06.010"},

oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) over alumina- and silica-supported vanadia catalysts compared to O2. However, the ODP activity with N2O is lower than with O2. The degree of reduction of VOx species is suggested to be important for achieving high propene selectivity. The nature of oxygen species, whether adsorbed (nonlattice) or lattice, also influences COx formation. Adsorbed oxygen species are considered nonselective for the ODP reaction over certain catalysts. The redox dynamics of VOx species have been studied using in-situ UV/vis analysis, and the catalytic performance of different VOx/SiO2, VOx/MCM-41, and VOx/MCM-48 materials in the ODP reaction has been characterized. Nitrous oxide (N2O) has been found to be advantageous as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) compared to other oxidants like oxygen (O2). This is due to its ability to achieve higher propylene selectivity. The study of VOx/MCM-41, VOx/SiO2, and VOx/MCM-48 materials has shown that N2O can lead to a higher degree of reduction of vanadium species, which is essential for achieving high primary propylene selectivity and suppressing consecutive propylene oxidation to CO and CO2. The higher polymerized VOx species have a higher activity for consecutive propene oxidation, and the importance of direct propane oxidation and consecutive propene oxidation to COx is significantly higher in the presence of O2 than in N2O. The catalytic performance is determined by the oxidant activation, and N2O's lower oxidizing ability tunes the degree of reduction of vanadium species, leading to a higher reduction degree of VOx species. This effect is related to the spatial separation of active lattice oxygen species, reducing the surface density of active oxygen species. However, the degree of reduction of VOx species is not the only reason for the superior performance of N2O compared to O2. The nature of oxygen species also influences COx formation, with adsorbed (nonlattice) oxygen species being nonselective for the ODP reaction over certain catalytic materials. In contrast, N2O decomposition over reducible metal oxides yields mononuclear oxygen species, which are considered selective. The critical challenges associated with catalyst deactivation and stability in N2O-ODHP include the need for a high degree of reduction of vanadium species and the prevention of nonselective oxygen species formation. Strategies to address these limitations could involve the development of catalysts with controlled surface density of active oxygen species and the optimization of reaction conditions to favor selective oxygen species formation. Research directions could focus on understanding the mechanisms of oxygen species formation and their role in the selectivity of the ODHP process, as well as the development of new catalyst formulations that can maintain high activity and selectivity under N2O-ODHP conditions. Nitrous oxide (N2O) has been shown to have advantages over other oxidants in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP), particularly in terms of propylene selectivity. The use of N2O as an oxidant results in higher propylene selectivity compared to oxygen (O2) over a broad range of propane conversions. This effect is more pronounced for catalysts with microcrystalline V2O5. The improved selectivity is attributed to the ability of N2O to achieve a higher primary propene selectivity and to lower the activity for consecutive propene oxidation. N2O reoxidizes reduced VOx species slower than O2, which is essential for suppressing nonselective consecutive propene oxidation to COx. The nature of oxygen species also plays a role, with N2O not producing nonselective adsorbed oxygen species that can catalyze nonselective consecutive propene oxidation to COx. A variety of catalysts have been employed in the ODHP process, including VOx/SiO2, VOx/MCM-41, and VOx/MCM-48. These catalysts have been characterized using various techniques such as transmission electron microscopy (TEM), temperature-programmed reduction (TPR), UV/vis, Raman, and X-ray diffraction (XRD). The specific surface area of the catalysts decreases with vanadium loading, and the degree of polymerization of VOx species is influenced by the support material. The catalytic activity of the VOx(2.7)/MCM-41 catalyst is slightly higher than that of the VOx(2.8)/SiO2 and VOx(3.4)/MCM-48 samples, possibly due to a lower degree of polymerization of VOx species. The lowest activity was observed over the VOx(11.2)/MCM-41 sample, which possesses microcrystalline V2O5. Catalyst deactivation and stability are critical challenges in the ODHP process. The use of N2O as an oxidant can help mitigate these issues by reducing the formation of nonselective adsorbed oxygen species that can lead to catalyst deactivation. However, the lower activity of N2O compared to O2 can also be a limitation. Strategies to address these challenges include optimizing the catalyst structure and composition to enhance stability and selectivity, developing methods to regenerate deactivated catalysts, and exploring alternative oxidants that can provide high selectivity and activity while maintaining catalyst stability.", "Chinese": "一氧化二氮（N2O）作为氧化剂在丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）中显示出相对于其他氧化剂的优势，特别是在丙烯选择性方面。使用N2O作为氧化剂可导致与氧气（O2）相比，在广泛的丙烷转化率范围内具有更高的丙烯选择性。这种改善的选择性归因于N2O能够实现更高的初始丙烯选择性，并降低连续丙烯氧化的活性。N2O比O2更慢地重新氧化还原的VOx物种，这对于抑制非选择性的连续丙烯氧化至COx至关重要。氧物种的性质也起着作用，N2O不会产生非选择性的吸附氧物种，这些物种可以催化非选择性的连续丙烯氧化至COx。已经使用了各种催化剂，包括VOx/SiO2、VOx/MCM-41和VOx/MCM-48，在ODHP过程中。这些催化剂使用了包括透射电子显微镜（TEM）、温度程序还原（TPR）、UV/vis、拉曼和X射线衍射（XRD）在内的多种技术进行了表征。随着钒负载量的增加，催化剂的比表面积降低，VOx物种的聚合度受支撑材料的影响。VOx(2.7)/MCM-41催化剂的催化活性略高于VOx(2.8)/SiO2和VOx(3.4)/MCM-48样品，这可能归因于VOx物种较低的聚合度。观察到最低活性是在VOx(11.2)/MCM-41样品上，该样品具有微晶V2O5。催化剂失活和稳定性是ODHP过程中的关键挑战。使用N2O作为氧化剂可以通过减少导致催化剂失活的非选择性吸附氧物种的形成来帮助缓解这些问题。然而，N2O的较低活性与O2相比也可能是一个限制。解决这些挑战的策略包括优化催化剂结构和组成以增强稳定性和选择性，开发方法来再生失活的催化剂，以及探索可以提供高选择性和活性同时保持催化剂稳定性的替代氧化剂。", "Doi": "10.1021/jp070747c"},

The essential role of N2O in this process is highlighted by the fact that propene production does not occur when propane interacts with iron zeolites in the absence of N2O.

oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) over alumina- and silica-supported vanadia catalysts compared to O2. However, the ODP activity with N2O is lower than with O2. The degree of reduction of VOx species is suggested to be important for achieving high propene selectivity. The nature of oxygen species, whether adsorbed (nonlattice) or lattice, also influences COx formation. Adsorbed oxygen species are considered nonselective for the ODP reaction over certain catalysts. The redox dynamics of VOx species have been studied using in-situ UV/vis analysis, and the catalytic performance of different VOx/SiO2, VOx/MCM-41, and VOx/MCM-48 materials in the ODP reaction has been characterized. Nitrous oxide (N2O) has been found to be advantageous as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) compared to other oxidants like oxygen (O2). This is due to its ability to achieve higher propylene selectivity. The study of VOx/MCM-41, VOx/SiO2, and VOx/MCM-48 materials has shown that N2O can lead to a higher degree of reduction of vanadium species, which is essential for achieving high primary propylene selectivity and suppressing consecutive propylene oxidation to CO and CO2. The higher polymerized VOx species have a higher activity for consecutive propene oxidation, and the importance of direct propane oxidation and consecutive propene oxidation to COx is significantly higher in the presence of O2 than in N2O. The catalytic performance is determined by the oxidant activation, and N2O's lower oxidizing ability tunes the degree of reduction of vanadium species, leading to a higher reduction degree of VOx species. This effect is related to the spatial separation of active lattice oxygen species, reducing the surface density of active oxygen species. However, the degree of reduction of VOx species is not the only reason for the superior performance of N2O compared to O2. The nature of oxygen species also influences COx formation, with adsorbed (nonlattice) oxygen species being nonselective for the ODP reaction over certain catalytic materials. In contrast, N2O decomposition over reducible metal oxides yields mononuclear oxygen species, which are considered selective. The critical challenges associated with catalyst deactivation and stability in N2O-ODHP include the need for a high degree of reduction of vanadium species and the prevention of nonselective oxygen species formation. Strategies to address these limitations could involve the development of catalysts with controlled surface density of active oxygen species and the optimization of reaction conditions to favor selective oxygen species formation. Research directions could focus on understanding the mechanisms of oxygen species formation and their role in the selectivity of the ODHP process, as well as the development of new catalyst formulations that can maintain high activity and selectivity under N2O-ODHP conditions. Nitrous oxide (N2O) has been shown to have advantages over other oxidants in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP), particularly in terms of propylene selectivity. The use of N2O as an oxidant results in higher propylene selectivity compared to oxygen (O2) over a broad range of propane conversions. This effect is more pronounced for catalysts with microcrystalline V2O5. The improved selectivity is attributed to the ability of N2O to achieve a higher primary propene selectivity and to lower the activity for consecutive propene oxidation. N2O reoxidizes reduced VOx species slower than O2, which is essential for suppressing nonselective consecutive propene oxidation to COx. The nature of oxygen species also plays a role, with N2O not producing nonselective adsorbed oxygen species that can catalyze nonselective consecutive propene oxidation to COx. A variety of catalysts have been employed in the ODHP process, including VOx/SiO2, VOx/MCM-41, and VOx/MCM-48. These catalysts have been characterized using various techniques such as transmission electron microscopy (TEM), temperature-programmed reduction (TPR), UV/vis, Raman, and X-ray diffraction (XRD). The specific surface area of the catalysts decreases with vanadium loading, and the degree of polymerization of VOx species is influenced by the support material. The catalytic activity of the VOx(2.7)/MCM-41 catalyst is slightly higher than that of the VOx(2.8)/SiO2 and VOx(3.4)/MCM-48 samples, possibly due to a lower degree of polymerization of VOx species. The lowest activity was observed over the VOx(11.2)/MCM-41 sample, which possesses microcrystalline V2O5. Catalyst deactivation and stability are critical challenges in the ODHP process. The use of N2O as an oxidant can help mitigate these issues by reducing the formation of nonselective adsorbed oxygen species that can lead to catalyst deactivation. However, the lower activity of N2O compared to O2 can also be a limitation. Strategies to address these challenges include optimizing the catalyst structure and composition to enhance stability and selectivity, developing methods to regenerate deactivated catalysts, and exploring alternative oxidants that can provide high selectivity and activity while maintaining catalyst stability.", "Chinese": "一氧化二氮（N2O）作为氧化剂在丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）中显示出相对于其他氧化剂的优势，特别是在丙烯选择性方面。使用N2O作为氧化剂可导致与氧气（O2）相比，在广泛的丙烷转化率范围内具有更高的丙烯选择性。这种改善的选择性归因于N2O能够实现更高的初始丙烯选择性，并降低连续丙烯氧化的活性。N2O比O2更慢地重新氧化还原的VOx物种，这对于抑制非选择性的连续丙烯氧化至COx至关重要。氧物种的性质也起着作用，N2O不会产生非选择性的吸附氧物种，这些物种可以催化非选择性的连续丙烯氧化至COx。已经使用了各种催化剂，包括VOx/SiO2、VOx/MCM-41和VOx/MCM-48，在ODHP过程中。这些催化剂使用了包括透射电子显微镜（TEM）、温度程序还原（TPR）、UV/vis、拉曼和X射线衍射（XRD）在内的多种技术进行了表征。随着钒负载量的增加，催化剂的比表面积降低，VOx物种的聚合度受支撑材料的影响。VOx(2.7)/MCM-41催化剂的催化活性略高于VOx(2.8)/SiO2和VOx(3.4)/MCM-48样品，这可能归因于VOx物种较低的聚合度。观察到最低活性是在VOx(11.2)/MCM-41样品上，该样品具有微晶V2O5。催化剂失活和稳定性是ODHP过程中的关键挑战。使用N2O作为氧化剂可以通过减少导致催化剂失活的非选择性吸附氧物种的形成来帮助缓解这些问题。然而，N2O的较低活性与O2相比也可能是一个限制。解决这些挑战的策略包括优化催化剂结构和组成以增强稳定性和选择性，开发方法来再生失活的催化剂，以及探索可以提供高选择性和活性同时保持催化剂稳定性的替代氧化剂。", "Doi": "10.1021/jp070747c"},

However, the catalyst deactivation is a critical challenge in this process, as it is mainly caused by the reduction of vanadium species rather than the formation of carbonaceous deposits. The regeneration of the catalyst by heating under N2O at high temperatures can partly restore its activity, but complete restoration requires reoxidation in the presence of oxygen. To address these limitations and make N2O-ODHP a more feasible option for practical implementation, research directions could focus on developing more stable catalysts that can maintain their activity over longer periods, optimizing the reaction conditions to minimize vanadium reduction, and exploring alternative regeneration methods that can effectively restore the catalyst's activity without the need for high-temperature treatments.", "Chinese": "一氧化二氮(N2O)作为氧化脱氢丙烷(ODHP)的氧化剂,由于其能够实现比其他氧化剂更高的丙烯选择性,尽管丙烷转化率较低。这归因于N2O能够还原钒物种而不形成过氧钒酸盐,过氧钒酸盐具有高反应性,可导致碳氧化物的形成。使用N2O作为氧化剂导致较慢的再氧化过程,这允许更高的丙烯选择性。然而,催化剂失活是该过程中的一个关键挑战,因为它主要是由钒物种的还原引起的,而不是碳质沉积物的形成。通过在高温下在N2O下加热催化剂,可以部分恢复其活性,但完全恢复需要在氧气存在下进行再氧化。为了解决这些限制,使N2O-ODHP成为更可行的实践实施选项,研究方向可以集中在开发更稳定的催化剂,这些催化剂可以在更长的时间内保持其活性,优化反应条件以最小化钒还原,并探索可以有效恢复催化剂活性而无需高温处理的替代再生方法。", "Doi": "10.1016/j.jcat.2015.12.028"},

This improvement has been observed over various catalysts, including steam-activated iron-containing zeolites, bulk vanadium oxides, and supported vanadium-containing materials. A similar effect of N2O has also been reported for the oxidative dehydrogenation of n-butane over vanadium magnesium oxide catalysts. The positive effect of N2O on the ODHP reaction is attributed to the slower reoxidation of reduced VOx species compared to O2, resulting in a lower steady-state concentration of active lattice oxygen sites and thus suppressing the consecutive oxidation of propene to carbon oxides. However, the activity of VOx sites for consecutive propene oxidation increases with rising agglomerization degree. Propene selectivities do not differ much as long as the vanadium surface concentration remains below monolayer coverage, with only isolated VOx sites and small two-dimensional VxOy clusters present. When V2O5 nanocrystallites dominate, there is a dramatic drop in propene selectivity and direct total oxidation of propane occurs with both oxidants, although this detrimental effect is less pronounced in the presence of N2O. A recent study suggested that compared to N2O, other oxygen species (non-lattice oxygen of VOx species) are formed from gas-phase O2 and participate in COx formation. However, there is limited experimental information on the nature of active oxygen species formed from O2 and N2O upon reoxidation of reduced VOx species. The aim of this study is to obtain experimental evidence on the nature and structure of oxygen species formed upon reoxidation of reduced highly dispersed VOx species supported over MCM-41 with O2 and N2O.

In comparison, the respective value with N2O was only half as high, while the propene selectivity was higher, amounting to 80% with N2O but only to 50% with O2 at propane conversion of approximately 10%. Since several of the previously postulated oxygen species were paramagnetic, EPR spectroscopy under controlled atmosphere conditions was applied to experimentally identify oxygen species formed from gaseous N2O and O2 over VOx/MCM-41 and to explore the reactivity of these species towards oxidation of C3H8, C3H6, and CO.", "Chinese": "一氧化二氮(N2O)作为氧化剂在丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)中使用时,与氧气(O2)相比,显著提高了丙烯选择性。这种改善在各种催化剂上都有观察到,包括蒸汽活化铁含沸石、块状钒氧化物和含钒支撑材料。N2O对n-丁烷氧化脱氢的类似效果也已在钒镁氧化物催化剂上报道。N2O对ODHP反应的积极作用归因于与O2相比,VOx物种的还原态的再氧化速率较慢,导致活性晶格氧位点的稳态浓度较低,从而抑制了丙烯向二氧化碳的连续氧化。然而,VOx位点对连续丙烯氧化的活性随着聚集度的增加而增加。只要钒表面浓度保持在单层覆盖以下,丙烯选择性差异不大,只有孤立的VOx位点和小的二维VxOy簇存在。当V2O5纳米晶占主导时,不仅丙烯选择性急剧下降,而且在两种氧化剂存在下,丙烷的直接完全氧化都会发生,尽管在N2O存在下,这种不利影响不那么明显。最近的一项研究指出,与N2O相比,从气相O2中形成的其他氧物种(VOx物种的非晶格氧)参与了COx的形成。然而,关于从O2和N2O还原VOx物种时形成的活性氧物种的性质,只有有限的实验信息。本研究的目的是获得实验证据,证明在O2和N2O存在下,在MCM-41上还原的高分散VOx物种的性质和结构。本研究中使用的VOx/MCM-41催化剂以前已在丙烷氧化脱氢中进行了彻底的表征和测试。使用O2作为氧化剂时,测得的丙烷转化率的周转频率为0.016 molC3H8 mol1 V s1。相比之下,N2O的相应值仅为一半,而丙烯选择性更高,在丙烷转化率约为10%时,丙烯选择性为80%,而O2仅为50%。由于以前假设的几种氧物种具有顺磁性,因此在受控气氛条件下应用了EPR光谱,以实验上识别从气相N2O和O2在VOx/MCM-41上形成的氧物种,并探索这些物种对C3H8、C3H6和CO氧化的反应性。", "Doi": "10.1016/j.jcat.2010.06.010"},

oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) over alumina- and silica-supported vanadia catalysts compared to O2. However, the ODP activity with N2O is lower than with O2. The degree of reduction of VOx species is suggested to be important for achieving high propene selectivity. The nature of oxygen species, whether adsorbed (nonlattice) or lattice, also influences COx formation. Adsorbed oxygen species are considered nonselective for the ODP reaction over certain catalysts. The redox dynamics of VOx species have been studied using in-situ UV/vis analysis, and the catalytic performance of different VOx/SiO2, VOx/MCM-41, and VOx/MCM-48 materials in the ODP reaction has been characterized. Nitrous oxide (N2O) has been found to be advantageous as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) compared to other oxidants like oxygen (O2). This is due to its ability to achieve higher propylene selectivity. The study of VOx/MCM-41, VOx/SiO2, and VOx/MCM-48 materials has shown that N2O can lead to a higher degree of reduction of vanadium species, which is essential for achieving high primary propylene selectivity and suppressing consecutive propylene oxidation to CO and CO2. The higher polymerized VOx species have a higher activity for consecutive propene oxidation, and the importance of direct propane oxidation and consecutive propene oxidation to COx is significantly higher in the presence of O2 than in N2O. The catalytic performance is determined by the oxidant activation, and N2O's lower oxidizing ability tunes the degree of reduction of vanadium species, leading to a higher reduction degree of VOx species. This effect is related to the spatial separation of active lattice oxygen species, reducing the surface density of active oxygen species. However, the degree of reduction of VOx species is not the only reason for the superior performance of N2O compared to O2. The nature of oxygen species also influences COx formation, with adsorbed (nonlattice) oxygen species being nonselective for the ODP reaction over certain catalytic materials. In contrast, N2O decomposition over reducible metal oxides yields mononuclear oxygen species, which are considered selective. The critical challenges associated with catalyst deactivation and stability in N2O-ODHP include the need for a high degree of reduction of vanadium species and the prevention of nonselective oxygen species formation. Strategies to address these limitations could involve the development of catalysts with controlled surface density of active oxygen species and the optimization of reaction conditions to favor selective oxygen species formation. Research directions could focus on understanding the mechanisms of oxygen species formation and their role in the selectivity of the ODHP process, as well as the development of new catalyst formulations that can maintain high activity and selectivity under N2O-ODHP conditions. Nitrous oxide (N2O) has been shown to have advantages over other oxidants in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP), particularly in terms of propylene selectivity. The use of N2O as an oxidant results in higher propylene selectivity compared to oxygen (O2) over a broad range of propane conversions. This effect is more pronounced for catalysts with microcrystalline V2O5. The improved selectivity is attributed to the ability of N2O to achieve a higher primary propene selectivity and to lower the activity for consecutive propene oxidation. N2O reoxidizes reduced VOx species slower than O2, which is essential for suppressing nonselective consecutive propene oxidation to COx. The nature of oxygen species also plays a role, with N2O not producing nonselective adsorbed oxygen species that can catalyze nonselective consecutive propene oxidation to COx. A variety of catalysts have been employed in the ODHP process, including VOx/SiO2, VOx/MCM-41, and VOx/MCM-48. These catalysts have been characterized using various techniques such as transmission electron microscopy (TEM), temperature-programmed reduction (TPR), UV/vis, Raman, and X-ray diffraction (XRD). The specific surface area of the catalysts decreases with vanadium loading, and the degree of polymerization of VOx species is influenced by the support material. The catalytic activity of the VOx(2.7)/MCM-41 catalyst is slightly higher than that of the VOx(2.8)/SiO2 and VOx(3.4)/MCM-48 samples, possibly due to a lower degree of polymerization of VOx species. The lowest activity was observed over the VOx(11.2)/MCM-41 sample, which possesses microcrystalline V2O5. Catalyst deactivation and stability are critical challenges in the ODHP process. The use of N2O as an oxidant can help mitigate these issues by reducing the formation of nonselective adsorbed oxygen species that can lead to catalyst deactivation. However, the lower activity of N2O compared to O2 can also be a limitation. Strategies to address these challenges include optimizing the catalyst structure and composition to enhance stability and selectivity, developing methods to regenerate deactivated catalysts, and exploring alternative oxidants that can provide high selectivity and activity while maintaining catalyst stability.", "Chinese": "一氧化二氮（N2O）作为氧化剂在丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）中显示出相对于其他氧化剂的优势，特别是在丙烯选择性方面。使用N2O作为氧化剂可导致与氧气（O2）相比，在广泛的丙烷转化率范围内具有更高的丙烯选择性。这种改善的选择性归因于N2O能够实现更高的初始丙烯选择性，并降低连续丙烯氧化的活性。N2O比O2更慢地重新氧化还原的VOx物种，这对于抑制非选择性的连续丙烯氧化至COx至关重要。氧物种的性质也起着作用，N2O不会产生非选择性的吸附氧物种，这些物种可以催化非选择性的连续丙烯氧化至COx。已经使用了各种催化剂，包括VOx/SiO2、VOx/MCM-41和VOx/MCM-48，在ODHP过程中。这些催化剂使用了包括透射电子显微镜（TEM）、温度程序还原（TPR）、UV/vis、拉曼和X射线衍射（XRD）在内的多种技术进行了表征。随着钒负载量的增加，催化剂的比表面积降低，VOx物种的聚合度受支撑材料的影响。VOx(2.7)/MCM-41催化剂的催化活性略高于VOx(2.8)/SiO2和VOx(3.4)/MCM-48样品，这可能归因于VOx物种较低的聚合度。观察到最低活性是在VOx(11.2)/MCM-41样品上，该样品具有微晶V2O5。催化剂失活和稳定性是ODHP过程中的关键挑战。使用N2O作为氧化剂可以通过减少导致催化剂失活的非选择性吸附氧物种的形成来帮助缓解这些问题。然而，N2O的较低活性与O2相比也可能是一个限制。解决这些挑战的策略包括优化催化剂结构和组成以增强稳定性和选择性，开发方法来再生失活的催化剂，以及探索可以提供高选择性和活性同时保持催化剂稳定性的替代氧化剂。", "Doi": "10.1021/jp070747c"},

The essential role of N2O in this process is highlighted by the fact that propene production does not occur when propane interacts with iron zeolites in the absence of N2O.

oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) over alumina- and silica-supported vanadia catalysts compared to O2. However, the ODP activity with N2O is lower than with O2. The degree of reduction of VOx species is suggested to be important for achieving high propene selectivity. The nature of oxygen species, whether adsorbed (nonlattice) or lattice, also influences COx formation. Adsorbed oxygen species are considered nonselective for the ODP reaction over certain catalysts. The redox dynamics of VOx species have been studied using in-situ UV/vis analysis, and the catalytic performance of different VOx/SiO2, VOx/MCM-41, and VOx/MCM-48 materials in the ODP reaction has been characterized. Nitrous oxide (N2O) has been found to be advantageous as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) compared to other oxidants like oxygen (O2). This is due to its ability to achieve higher propylene selectivity. The study of VOx/MCM-41, VOx/SiO2, and VOx/MCM-48 materials has shown that N2O can lead to a higher degree of reduction of vanadium species, which is essential for achieving high primary propylene selectivity and suppressing consecutive propylene oxidation to CO and CO2. The higher polymerized VOx species have a higher activity for consecutive propene oxidation, and the importance of direct propane oxidation and consecutive propene oxidation to COx is significantly higher in the presence of O2 than in N2O. The catalytic performance is determined by the oxidant activation, and N2O's lower oxidizing ability tunes the degree of reduction of vanadium species, leading to a higher reduction degree of VOx species. This effect is related to the spatial separation of active lattice oxygen species, reducing the surface density of active oxygen species. However, the degree of reduction of VOx species is not the only reason for the superior performance of N2O compared to O2. The nature of oxygen species also influences COx formation, with adsorbed (nonlattice) oxygen species being nonselective for the ODP reaction over certain catalytic materials. In contrast, N2O decomposition over reducible metal oxides yields mononuclear oxygen species, which are considered selective. The critical challenges associated with catalyst deactivation and stability in N2O-ODHP include the need for a high degree of reduction of vanadium species and the prevention of nonselective oxygen species formation. Strategies to address these limitations could involve the development of catalysts with controlled surface density of active oxygen species and the optimization of reaction conditions to favor selective oxygen species formation. Research directions could focus on understanding the mechanisms of oxygen species formation and their role in the selectivity of the ODHP process, as well as the development of new catalyst formulations that can maintain high activity and selectivity under N2O-ODHP conditions. Nitrous oxide (N2O) has been shown to have advantages over other oxidants in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP), particularly in terms of propylene selectivity. The use of N2O as an oxidant results in higher propylene selectivity compared to oxygen (O2) over a broad range of propane conversions. This effect is more pronounced for catalysts with microcrystalline V2O5. The improved selectivity is attributed to the ability of N2O to achieve a higher primary propene selectivity and to lower the activity for consecutive propene oxidation. N2O reoxidizes reduced VOx species slower than O2, which is essential for suppressing nonselective consecutive propene oxidation to COx. The nature of oxygen species also plays a role, with N2O not producing nonselective adsorbed oxygen species that can catalyze nonselective consecutive propene oxidation to COx. A variety of catalysts have been employed in the ODHP process, including VOx/SiO2, VOx/MCM-41, and VOx/MCM-48. These catalysts have been characterized using various techniques such as transmission electron microscopy (TEM), temperature-programmed reduction (TPR), UV/vis, Raman, and X-ray diffraction (XRD). The specific surface area of the catalysts decreases with vanadium loading, and the degree of polymerization of VOx species is influenced by the support material. The catalytic activity of the VOx(2.7)/MCM-41 catalyst is slightly higher than that of the VOx(2.8)/SiO2 and VOx(3.4)/MCM-48 samples, possibly due to a lower degree of polymerization of VOx species. The lowest activity was observed over the VOx(11.2)/MCM-41 sample, which possesses microcrystalline V2O5. Catalyst deactivation and stability are critical challenges in the ODHP process. The use of N2O as an oxidant can help mitigate these issues by reducing the formation of nonselective adsorbed oxygen species that can lead to catalyst deactivation. However, the lower activity of N2O compared to O2 can also be a limitation. Strategies to address these challenges include optimizing the catalyst structure and composition to enhance stability and selectivity, developing methods to regenerate deactivated catalysts, and exploring alternative oxidants that can provide high selectivity and activity while maintaining catalyst stability.", "Chinese": "一氧化二氮（N2O）作为氧化剂在丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）中显示出相对于其他氧化剂的优势，特别是在丙烯选择性方面。使用N2O作为氧化剂可导致与氧气（O2）相比，在广泛的丙烷转化率范围内具有更高的丙烯选择性。这种改善的选择性归因于N2O能够实现更高的初始丙烯选择性，并降低连续丙烯氧化的活性。N2O比O2更慢地重新氧化还原的VOx物种，这对于抑制非选择性的连续丙烯氧化至COx至关重要。氧物种的性质也起着作用，N2O不会产生非选择性的吸附氧物种，这些物种可以催化非选择性的连续丙烯氧化至COx。已经使用了各种催化剂，包括VOx/SiO2、VOx/MCM-41和VOx/MCM-48，在ODHP过程中。这些催化剂使用了包括透射电子显微镜（TEM）、温度程序还原（TPR）、UV/vis、拉曼和X射线衍射（XRD）在内的多种技术进行了表征。随着钒负载量的增加，催化剂的比表面积降低，VOx物种的聚合度受支撑材料的影响。VOx(2.7)/MCM-41催化剂的催化活性略高于VOx(2.8)/SiO2和VOx(3.4)/MCM-48样品，这可能归因于VOx物种较低的聚合度。观察到最低活性是在VOx(11.2)/MCM-41样品上，该样品具有微晶V2O5。催化剂失活和稳定性是ODHP过程中的关键挑战。使用N2O作为氧化剂可以通过减少导致催化剂失活的非选择性吸附氧物种的形成来帮助缓解这些问题。然而，N2O的较低活性与O2相比也可能是一个限制。解决这些挑战的策略包括优化催化剂结构和组成以增强稳定性和选择性，开发方法来再生失活的催化剂，以及探索可以提供高选择性和活性同时保持催化剂稳定性的替代氧化剂。", "Doi": "10.1021/jp070747c"},

However, the catalyst deactivation is a critical challenge in this process, as it is mainly caused by the reduction of vanadium species rather than the formation of carbonaceous deposits. The regeneration of the catalyst by heating under N2O at high temperatures can partly restore its activity, but complete restoration requires reoxidation in the presence of oxygen. To address these limitations and make N2O-ODHP a more feasible option for practical implementation, research directions could focus on developing more stable catalysts that can maintain their activity over longer periods, optimizing the reaction conditions to minimize vanadium reduction, and exploring alternative regeneration methods that can effectively restore the catalyst's activity without the need for high-temperature treatments.", "Chinese": "一氧化二氮(N2O)作为氧化脱氢丙烷(ODHP)的氧化剂,由于其能够实现比其他氧化剂更高的丙烯选择性,尽管丙烷转化率较低。这归因于N2O能够还原钒物种而不形成过氧钒酸盐,过氧钒酸盐具有高反应性,可导致碳氧化物的形成。使用N2O作为氧化剂导致较慢的再氧化过程,这允许更高的丙烯选择性。然而,催化剂失活是该过程中的一个关键挑战,因为它主要是由钒物种的还原引起的,而不是碳质沉积物的形成。通过在高温下在N2O下加热催化剂,可以部分恢复其活性,但完全恢复需要在氧气存在下进行再氧化。为了解决这些限制,使N2O-ODHP成为更可行的实践实施选项,研究方向可以集中在开发更稳定的催化剂,这些催化剂可以在更长的时间内保持其活性,优化反应条件以最小化钒还原,并探索可以有效恢复催化剂活性而无需高温处理的替代再生方法。", "Doi": "10.1016/j.jcat.2015.12.028"},

This improvement has been observed over various catalysts, including steam-activated iron-containing zeolites, bulk vanadium oxides, and supported vanadium-containing materials. A similar effect of N2O has also been reported for the oxidative dehydrogenation of n-butane over vanadium magnesium oxide catalysts. The positive effect of N2O on the ODHP reaction is attributed to the slower reoxidation of reduced VOx species compared to O2, resulting in a lower steady-state concentration of active lattice oxygen sites and thus suppressing the consecutive oxidation of propene to carbon oxides. However, the activity of VOx sites for consecutive propene oxidation increases with rising agglomerization degree. Propene selectivities do not differ much as long as the vanadium surface concentration remains below monolayer coverage, with only isolated VOx sites and small two-dimensional VxOy clusters present. When V2O5 nanocrystallites dominate, there is a dramatic drop in propene selectivity and direct total oxidation of propane occurs with both oxidants, although this detrimental effect is less pronounced in the presence of N2O. A recent study suggested that compared to N2O, other oxygen species (non-lattice oxygen of VOx species) are formed from gas-phase O2 and participate in COx formation. However, there is limited experimental information on the nature of active oxygen species formed from O2 and N2O upon reoxidation of reduced VOx species. The aim of this study is to obtain experimental evidence on the nature and structure of oxygen species formed upon reoxidation of reduced highly dispersed VOx species supported over MCM-41 with O2 and N2O.

In comparison, the respective value with N2O was only half as high, while the propene selectivity was higher, amounting to 80% with N2O but only to 50% with O2 at propane conversion of approximately 10%. Since several of the previously postulated oxygen species were paramagnetic, EPR spectroscopy under controlled atmosphere conditions was applied to experimentally identify oxygen species formed from gaseous N2O and O2 over VOx/MCM-41 and to explore the reactivity of these species towards oxidation of C3H8, C3H6, and CO.", "Chinese": "一氧化二氮(N2O)作为氧化剂在丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)中使用时,与氧气(O2)相比,显著提高了丙烯选择性。这种改善在各种催化剂上都有观察到,包括蒸汽活化铁含沸石、块状钒氧化物和含钒支撑材料。N2O对n-丁烷氧化脱氢的类似效果也已在钒镁氧化物催化剂上报道。N2O对ODHP反应的积极作用归因于与O2相比,VOx物种的还原态的再氧化速率较慢,导致活性晶格氧位点的稳态浓度较低,从而抑制了丙烯向二氧化碳的连续氧化。然而,VOx位点对连续丙烯氧化的活性随着聚集度的增加而增加。只要钒表面浓度保持在单层覆盖以下,丙烯选择性差异不大,只有孤立的VOx位点和小的二维VxOy簇存在。当V2O5纳米晶占主导时,不仅丙烯选择性急剧下降,而且在两种氧化剂存在下,丙烷的直接完全氧化都会发生,尽管在N2O存在下,这种不利影响不那么明显。最近的一项研究指出,与N2O相比,从气相O2中形成的其他氧物种(VOx物种的非晶格氧)参与了COx的形成。然而,关于从O2和N2O还原VOx物种时形成的活性氧物种的性质,只有有限的实验信息。本研究的目的是获得实验证据,证明在O2和N2O存在下,在MCM-41上还原的高分散VOx物种的性质和结构。本研究中使用的VOx/MCM-41催化剂以前已在丙烷氧化脱氢中进行了彻底的表征和测试。使用O2作为氧化剂时,测得的丙烷转化率的周转频率为0.016 molC3H8 mol1 V s1。相比之下,N2O的相应值仅为一半,而丙烯选择性更高,在丙烷转化率约为10%时,丙烯选择性为80%,而O2仅为50%。由于以前假设的几种氧物种具有顺磁性,因此在受控气氛条件下应用了EPR光谱,以实验上识别从气相N2O和O2在VOx/MCM-41上形成的氧物种,并探索这些物种对C3H8、C3H6和CO氧化的反应性。", "Doi": "10.1016/j.jcat.2010.06.010"},

oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) over alumina- and silica-supported vanadia catalysts compared to O2. However, the ODP activity with N2O is lower than with O2. The degree of reduction of VOx species is suggested to be important for achieving high propene selectivity. The nature of oxygen species, whether adsorbed (nonlattice) or lattice, also influences COx formation. Adsorbed oxygen species are considered nonselective for the ODP reaction over certain catalysts. The redox dynamics of VOx species have been studied using in-situ UV/vis analysis, and the catalytic performance of different VOx/SiO2, VOx/MCM-41, and VOx/MCM-48 materials in the ODP reaction has been characterized. Nitrous oxide (N2O) has been found to be advantageous as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) compared to other oxidants like oxygen (O2). This is due to its ability to achieve higher propylene selectivity. The study of VOx/MCM-41, VOx/SiO2, and VOx/MCM-48 materials has shown that N2O can lead to a higher degree of reduction of vanadium species, which is essential for achieving high primary propylene selectivity and suppressing consecutive propylene oxidation to CO and CO2. The higher polymerized VOx species have a higher activity for consecutive propene oxidation, and the importance of direct propane oxidation and consecutive propene oxidation to COx is significantly higher in the presence of O2 than in N2O. The catalytic performance is determined by the oxidant activation, and N2O's lower oxidizing ability tunes the degree of reduction of vanadium species, leading to a higher reduction degree of VOx species. This effect is related to the spatial separation of active lattice oxygen species, reducing the surface density of active oxygen species. However, the degree of reduction of VOx species is not the only reason for the superior performance of N2O compared to O2. The nature of oxygen species also influences COx formation, with adsorbed (nonlattice) oxygen species being nonselective for the ODP reaction over certain catalytic materials. In contrast, N2O decomposition over reducible metal oxides yields mononuclear oxygen species, which are considered selective. The critical challenges associated with catalyst deactivation and stability in N2O-ODHP include the need for a high degree of reduction of vanadium species and the prevention of nonselective oxygen species formation. Strategies to address these limitations could involve the development of catalysts with controlled surface density of active oxygen species and the optimization of reaction conditions to favor selective oxygen species formation. Research directions could focus on understanding the mechanisms of oxygen species formation and their role in the selectivity of the ODHP process, as well as the development of new catalyst formulations that can maintain high activity and selectivity under N2O-ODHP conditions. Nitrous oxide (N2O) has been shown to have advantages over other oxidants in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP), particularly in terms of propylene selectivity. The use of N2O as an oxidant results in higher propylene selectivity compared to oxygen (O2) over a broad range of propane conversions. This effect is more pronounced for catalysts with microcrystalline V2O5. The improved selectivity is attributed to the ability of N2O to achieve a higher primary propene selectivity and to lower the activity for consecutive propene oxidation. N2O reoxidizes reduced VOx species slower than O2, which is essential for suppressing nonselective consecutive propene oxidation to COx. The nature of oxygen species also plays a role, with N2O not producing nonselective adsorbed oxygen species that can catalyze nonselective consecutive propene oxidation to COx. A variety of catalysts have been employed in the ODHP process, including VOx/SiO2, VOx/MCM-41, and VOx/MCM-48. These catalysts have been characterized using various techniques such as transmission electron microscopy (TEM), temperature-programmed reduction (TPR), UV/vis, Raman, and X-ray diffraction (XRD). The specific surface area of the catalysts decreases with vanadium loading, and the degree of polymerization of VOx species is influenced by the support material. The catalytic activity of the VOx(2.7)/MCM-41 catalyst is slightly higher than that of the VOx(2.8)/SiO2 and VOx(3.4)/MCM-48 samples, possibly due to a lower degree of polymerization of VOx species. The lowest activity was observed over the VOx(11.2)/MCM-41 sample, which possesses microcrystalline V2O5. Catalyst deactivation and stability are critical challenges in the ODHP process. The use of N2O as an oxidant can help mitigate these issues by reducing the formation of nonselective adsorbed oxygen species that can lead to catalyst deactivation. However, the lower activity of N2O compared to O2 can also be a limitation. Strategies to address these challenges include optimizing the catalyst structure and composition to enhance stability and selectivity, developing methods to regenerate deactivated catalysts, and exploring alternative oxidants that can provide high selectivity and activity while maintaining catalyst stability.", "Chinese": "一氧化二氮（N2O）作为氧化剂在丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）中显示出相对于其他氧化剂的优势，特别是在丙烯选择性方面。使用N2O作为氧化剂可导致与氧气（O2）相比，在广泛的丙烷转化率范围内具有更高的丙烯选择性。这种改善的选择性归因于N2O能够实现更高的初始丙烯选择性，并降低连续丙烯氧化的活性。N2O比O2更慢地重新氧化还原的VOx物种，这对于抑制非选择性的连续丙烯氧化至COx至关重要。氧物种的性质也起着作用，N2O不会产生非选择性的吸附氧物种，这些物种可以催化非选择性的连续丙烯氧化至COx。已经使用了各种催化剂，包括VOx/SiO2、VOx/MCM-41和VOx/MCM-48，在ODHP过程中。这些催化剂使用了包括透射电子显微镜（TEM）、温度程序还原（TPR）、UV/vis、拉曼和X射线衍射（XRD）在内的多种技术进行了表征。随着钒负载量的增加，催化剂的比表面积降低，VOx物种的聚合度受支撑材料的影响。VOx(2.7)/MCM-41催化剂的催化活性略高于VOx(2.8)/SiO2和VOx(3.4)/MCM-48样品，这可能归因于VOx物种较低的聚合度。观察到最低活性是在VOx(11.2)/MCM-41样品上，该样品具有微晶V2O5。催化剂失活和稳定性是ODHP过程中的关键挑战。使用N2O作为氧化剂可以通过减少导致催化剂失活的非选择性吸附氧物种的形成来帮助缓解这些问题。然而，N2O的较低活性与O2相比也可能是一个限制。解决这些挑战的策略包括优化催化剂结构和组成以增强稳定性和选择性，开发方法来再生失活的催化剂，以及探索可以提供高选择性和活性同时保持催化剂稳定性的替代氧化剂。", "Doi": "10.1021/jp070747c"},
